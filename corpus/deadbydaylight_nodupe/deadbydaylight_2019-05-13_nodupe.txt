There isn't too much to rate since the M1illy was pretty trash and you were obviously better than him
---
Only if there was a way for her to refill them 🤔
---
No, it’s pretty popular. But lullaby is too vulnerable and needs stacks to be good, whereas Ruin works from the start of the game
---
Koochie posting jumping from shitpostcrusaders, to shitpostbydaylight.
---
I did this, i got chewed out by my team. Rightfully deserved :(
---
I haven't seen that once and I've watched him for almost two years.
---
Try throwing on whispers.. that helps a lot. If anything just gen patrol. Youll eventually find someone. Play hag and put traps everywhere. It all comes with time and experience.
---
honestly if someone ever does that to you just DC, especially if they have an item. if they're gonna be a prick then no point in sticking around. games already over if 2 people are sitting in a corner blocking a 3rd person anyway.
---
[removed]
---
Aww, that cute face! This is great :D
---
I’d love to get only leatherfaces
---
Mettle of Man, the current number 1 BS perk for M1 killers to deal with specially against SWF but playing solo it's a life saver from hook farmers.
---
and just to rub it in, before you ask, im a killer main
---
Really? Whys that? I dont think I'll ever speak that sentence in my life haha
---
*nea and the pussycats*
---
He’s weak af and just looks funny as hell to me lol
---
There's already a reply that claims the exact same thing, which was why we got to 'tilting' in the first place. Perhaps learn to read babe.
---
As a victim and perpatrater I can confirm 100%
---
My thing is Dwight I always have problems with dwights. Fuck Dwight
---
Oh no, 1 place with double pallets, whatever will i do?
---
SWF communicates the location of a killer. who'd have seen that coming!  
---
But the whole point of a The Thing-esque killer is it's formless. There's a million ways you could have a shapeshifting killer interact with stuff in DBD if you don't assume that that the only power he could have is turning into a survivor and doing literally nothing.
---
MOM encourages tunneling off hook though.
---
I wish, at the very least, **default** and **default P3** would also be considered outfits.
---
It's more rare for me to find a leatherface that doesnt want to watch me die right before his eyes but I did get one leatherface that was playing without facecamping. Usually I see at least a few other killers tho so I thought it was weird
---
Switchin to fists
---
I guess... but no one was willing to get close enough to run around me for chaser points anyway. They would slowly walk into my view, but far away enough (about 24m) that they could emote/dash for an exit. It’s just this one claudette was audacious enough to go for a chest. I don’t think i would have even known if not for the noises... These guys were probably more concerned about getting an escape than ranking up anyway. (And honestly I don’t think anyone should be concerned about ranking up unless they haven’t done it once for the achievement). Maybe I shouldn’t have used the word greedy though.
---
Eh, I disagree
---
just for having the perk, no , they're not toxic. Now if they have a purple flashlight with the best addons, tbag after every pallet, and dancing at the gate at the end of the game, then hell yeah, toxic
---
I always thought Susie would look cute with this art style, and I was right! 
---
Well done !!
---
**Mental health disclaimer first: It is a game, if that wasn't hyperbole in your title, step back a bit, it is only bits and bytes, it does not matter that much in the end. Maybe talk to a friend or a professional, this is not normal.**
---
Now, if you find you are playing against one of those sweaty SWFs, just tunnel the weakest link as hard as you can.
---
Hook that mofo and stick your face in his/her crotch.
---
Run addons that increase your stalking with Myers.
---
 Suck them dry when they come for the hook. 
---
Be prepared for Borrowed Time and mind the invulnerability frames after unhooking.
---
Down the next, let them dance on the hook.
---
They will tease you, point at you, teabag you and click at your with their tiny little flashlights.
---
Ignore them, get your stalking up again and get ready for the next round.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The important part here is obviously that you need to find the weakest link first. Even at Rank 2, if it is a regular SWF group there will be one guy who is the bad at getting chased. Ignore the guys with flashlights, they want your attention, find the guys with the toolboxes and kill them. Ignore the pro looper, you can't loop a hook. 
---
Make them suffer, make them pay.
---
I got to rank 4 just casually playing killer, I don't ever see why people complain so much about ranking, it's not that hard. I almost double pipped the other day as legion and I killed one person.
---
"I hope you step on a lego" is my goto, but this one is gold as well. \^\^
---
You're gonna get more annoyed playing as survivor, especially if you're low rank. Nothing but terrible teammates and face camping killers who will tunnel the living hell out of you.
---
Essentially. Thanatophobia needs to be changed to Traumaphobia.
---
Then create another perk that functions off of dead survivors ,like Fire Up on Steroids and call it Thanatophillia.
---
Pretty sure it’s nea.
---
Anyone else just drop them like "Well I still need hatchets" and then go hook them
---
yeah the hatch camp was ass and only benefited really the survior, but now its really "who gets there first" and if the survior sees it but then the killer closes it and cucks the survior then it feels real bad 
---
i suppose in the long run it makes some sense since the killer is supposed to be scary and strong and closing the only hope one has to escape definitely fits the criteria (if we're talking lore wise)
---
There was a bug for a little where it would work when a survivor was dead and EVERYONE used it and it was so miserable as survivor.
---
It’s all been on our minds, but this guys said it
---
Before your downvoted to hell let me say, memeing as a killer can be a lot of fun, lots of opportunities to jump scare people with a little bit of thought. Or perhaps try and be the fairness police, hook farmer? Go after them, purposely letting a survivor enter struggle/bleed out? Save them kill the offender. Basement face loves his precious box in.. The basement protect it at all costs, they touch it you hook them, only allow saves in exchange for offerings (items). 
---
Alternatively main Nurse/Billy.
---
Welcome to DBD, where if you want to have fun you have to be low rank. Usually why I only play till I reach red ranks. 
---
Had one SWF group talking shit on the end game because all 4 escape (all 4 went on the hook at least once) I was playing 2 tier 1 perk on spirit with 2 brown addons on my first few games as spirit. I'm like bro, stfu can't I just mess around with different killers and have some fun?
---
Killer: I have to camp bc I have no kills
---
Also killer: just stand there and dont chase anyone
---
Activate windows
---
yes i agree 
---
it was scary the firs couple hours (maybe twenty in) and i was a terribly inmersed person
---
now with the hatch close it feels like a slap of reality 
---
still sucks tho as survior since the killer (such as billy or nurse) can monitor the gates really well
---
mid shut is strange tho
---
thats the only part that confuses me tbh
---
S-H-I-T
---
Identity V has this mode.  Killers normally win.
---
How do you set up a macro?
---
Its a bug i guess..did you go to all 4 boxes?
---
Bamboozle
---
Pretty much what Tuition is.
---
I got it on accident one match in the asylum. Don’t know how the killer didn’t find me, as I did a few gens and had Adept Laurie perks on. Stroke of luck I guess.
---
The devs should fix this
---
It does make sense, and it’s not so bad for the survivor nor the killer since the killer could also camp and before the update, whenever the killer saw the hatch, he couldn’t do nothing besides camping or going away.
---
so if i understand correctly, its kinda like a survivor grab where they have to be a certain amount in before it counts as an escape?
---
does this mean they have to be 100% in or if 99% still counts as a hatch close
---
i wish two people could do kyf to test this stuff out
---
turns out real strangers are a bitttt hard to work with
---
&gt;Dying Light will be reworked  
---
Genuinely wanna see the source of this. Speculation doesn't mean jackshit without proof. Besides, there are other perks that promote tunneling such as Remember Me and (albeit, to a much lesser extent and only during the endgame) Rancor.
---
Dead hard/Balanced Landing, MoM, Adrenaline, Selfcare/Decisive strike. Theres your toxic build(s) enjoy ya little bastards.
---
They aren’t hooks so no.
---
Didn't they call ash a chapter?
---
Does that waste the offering?
---
i cant wait for ds honestly cause it sounds like such a blessing 
---
reality wise i guess someone could always close something on you mid way but if youre in to an extent then it comes down to semantics and who did what first
---
What else are survivors supposed to do?
---
Totally the self-care of killer detection. All of my perk builds have to have it.
---
Why am I not surprised it was a Nea?
---
Was it not already closed by killer?
---
I personally use Razer Synapse. I have only a Deathadder and I actually have the macro set to my M5 button. I lied and said "H" key because it required no potential explanation.
---
Oh, you think survivors are powerful right now? They’ve been nerfed to shit every single update. My suggestion is to proc gens really hard, and play a high mobility killer like nurse/billy. Or just try survivor, so you know what your going to be trying to counter.
---
Let's kill da hoe
---
No, i'm the Kate who cleansed 4 totems, and did 3 gens solo then gets left on the hook and gets NOED camped while the other 3 destroy NOED and leave
---
It is messed. But, devoid of sarcasm, as a relatively small team, I think they did a pretty good job so far. It’s the player base that needs work.
---
So we’re talks of adding Ghostface. It was removed with the Shattered Bloodlines patch and recently appeared again with the DotF patch. Kate was also leaked nearly a year in before she came out.
---
So, having it how it is currently covers any possible confusion from that.
---
Gen times are perfectly fine, it's your fault for not downing survivors fast enough/applying pressure.
---
That "anti gen rush build" you put is HORRIBLE. Why dedicate 4 perks just to slow down generator progression instead of using perks that help you down survivors and get rid of their resources faster such as enduring and spirit fury?
---
Also it'd overlap too much with Dying Light.
---
Yeah and Dying Light covers that area with a specific condition to do it (killing the Obsession).
---
I'm used to this sub hating me for no reason. I can post a video of a SWF group being super toxic and try hard, then get called shit by Reddit for camping and tunnelling them.
---
I couldn't care less about what this sub thinks of me anymore
---
Nah that's bs.. the fact that a killer can close the hatch in a second and open the door in a seconds is dumb af. I played killer the other day to see how it goes and was blown away at how easy both were.
---
The other day a Billy closed the hatch and I had a key so hes on my ass I go to open it and I couldn't. the hatch was on autohaven and the lock was literally facing a row of cars. It was impossible I was mad. Because the way it spawned in was stupid.
---
*and have to diarrhea
---
Minus selfcare bring an instaheal. Now that's fun..
---
Imagine complaining about ruin
---
grahaha
---
Don't think so, everyone returns to main menu with their items/offerings
---
Are you playing killers with high mobility? I rarely use Ruin.
---
I'm not saying it shouldn't happen. I'm saying it's just unfair. Honestly, when the Endgame starts that's when Adrenaline should pump in. Then, maybe the survivor could get far enough away to hide
---
https://youtu.be/0rTtr7pUe-Q
---
The Billy lunged before turning the corner, so had to steer his lunge around the turn, which means he had to turn right very sharply. He steered straight for the pallet because he assumed she was going there, and because if she DID go for the pallet, he couldn't afford to wait any longer or she'd make it (which was why he started the lunge early).
---
But she went into the corner on the left, and so he just sailed around the corner, hugging the right, and missed her.
---
Pretty sure Nurse is indeed fixed
---
I can agree with adrenaline activating.
---
Thats still me on farm lol
---
Y'all have heard of pig + myers, now get ready for pig + freddy.
---
Includes Huntress picture and "I fucked your mother" reference for ultimate mother's day goodness
---
It's important enough that I remembered it this many days later. It's happened to my friends as well. It's just a toxic behavior
---
Just a flesh wound
---
You can't get hit during dead hard, the game basically considers you impossible to hit. 
---
Any hit that gets negated by DH is just considered a miss.
---
Forming an international terrorist organization, infiltrating the government, and orchestrating nuclear apocalypse so that power grids around the world are eliminated and internet infrastructure is ravaged out of existence =  **GALAXY BRAIN**
---
***Bless you, for we need it.***
---
Youu're completely missing what toxic is supposed to mean... what would you consider to be toxic then? Only doing illegal stuff? Because almost everyone I see uses toxic as a behavior that makes most people mad.
---
Even if it doesn't go wrong I don't enjoy mashing my keyboard and wearing it down. I always thought it should be skill checks. Big easy ones like the doctor or pig traps. Every time you fail the meter goes down a bit. 3 fails and you die. Obviously it still goes down slowly over time as well.
---
You’re in luck then ... rank reset is tomorrow 👌
---
It's just a real bummer that Freddy has to take a huge risk to slug. He should be great at it and he used to be until it was continually nerfed for him.
---
3 isn't the max no matter what, so you just got unlucky. The pig can also have 5 boxes to search with an addon so your friend could have been unlucky even after 4. If you didn't search all the boxes then it's not a bug haha. There is plenty of time to search all boxes as long as you're not walking to each of them or something.
---
Dude the worst is fucking corn blindness after you come back from a hiatus.
---
*Survivor found*
---
Me: UWUH WHERE?!
---
Huh, must have been a bug then, honestly cant say for certain because I've only recently started using MoM
---
Oh and I forgot to mention, Ruin every last game when I'm still kind of slow on the skill checks, and full party dc every other game. Not to mention losing all my blood points the one time I properly juke a nurse because she instantly disconnects, the end-of-game scoreboard shows me as gaining 8000+ blood points, but only 200 get added to my pool.
---
Now that was uncalled for lmao
---
SCP 4999 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT
---
You're probably doing something wrong if you get "gen rushed" at rank 10.
---
Freddy has to most numerous and easy to exploit weaknesses. If survivors know how to exploit them it's free wins.
---
I use Deja Vu to prevent my team from trigenning us.

[Lovely post-game chat.](https://i.imgur.com/zhhF24l.png)
---
That's a long time to go without getting ANY hunting points
---
I like it, Leatherface in B, what's your build on him ?
---
r/tworedditorsonecup
---
I will consider someone toxic if they throw the game to make someone else's experience worse. For example if you only go after 1 person all game to make sure they will not get to play the game, or throw down multiple pallets without the killer on you and dc at the start of the game for no reason/sandbag your teammates in an intentional way. Or if you purposefully and intentionally abuse exploits.
---
I will also call someone toxic if they are being toxic in the post-game chat or send them toxic messages.
---
You can say that someone's playstyle is boring, or that they are unfun to go against because they use really strong stuff. Both of these are very valid complaints and i will usually agree with you on those.
---
In-game bm is not toxic, it's been a part of pvp games since forever.
---
Is monitor and abuse good to run? I run bbq, nurse, generator thingy, and noed 
---
Should I replace generator thingy with monitor and abuse or nah? If not I’ll prob run shadowborn
---
That they don't even have the full rights to the game any more cause of a lawsuit.
---
That's why they haven't added content in almost a year.
---
That's very nice of you, thank you! I did study in fine arts but I just dable here and there now. 
---
To answer your other comment, it's a watercolour painting so the original has much more muted tones and I boosted them on the computer but perhaps I should have toned down the saturation.
---
Calling the electric company and telling them to shut down the whole city's power
---
Too many thoughts going when I had a debate, so I wasted five hours of my life making this.
---
Apologies for the initial comment :)
---
If I sense a SWF, it’s Mori + Powerful add-ones. I don’t even think twice. Played yesterday with this kind of SWF, so toxic that they disconnected. Satisfying
---
So tunneling because its viable isn't toxic but doing so because you hate the guy is? You have a very weird concept of toxic to me...
---
Hag in C.. okay
---
I always thought it was weird that they FUCKING NERFED IT AFTER IT'S BUFF. FFS BHVR
---
Yeah I used to run that too but by now I’ve just memorized where all the gens spawn and which ones have been done already so I do gens based off that. Sucks playing solo though cause you can’t tell your team not to do gens all in the same area so they end up giving the killer a three gen strat anyways :/ I try my best though lol
---
Then you'd be stuck in the shithole ranks.
---
No I've been playing for a few hours with 3 teammates who are terrible and have pretty much had nothing but glowing skin try hards who use the best perks in the game or chase anyone who's just been unhooked.  I have a try hard doctor with unnerving presence, hex ruin, distressing, bbq chili which I can swap to an even cheaper build but I keep for the bloodpoints, so it's not hard to be a cheap killer.  I play with survivors most of the time, I try to hook them all twice then I let them go.
---
How about stop pretending this game takes amazing amount of skill and stop trying so hard?  This game is meant to be enjoyed casually with friends.
---
Lol I'm outplaying this nerd so hard
---
Not paying your taxes so you get electricity shut off
---
Monitor can make it so you can blink to them before they even hear your heartbeat. It’s more preference than anything. I’d take ruin over noed personally.
---
If I fuck up the match you best know I'm gonna go hide and act AFK I get the saltiest messages. But who's fault is it really.
---
It's being backed by Sony and Fox.
---
F13 failed because it came from a Kickstarter with not much thought in it. 
---
Also, Illfonic wasn't the game directors either the guys at GUN were, they just designed most of it which F13 looks visually much better than DBD.
---
I'd like to be optimistic about the game at least and not just look at the devs and laugh/sigh cause it has more promise than any of the past games of this nature. 
---
DBD took time to become what it is it didn't start that way.
---
Their should be a perk, it is completely useless. But it allows you to flip the killer off. Maybe gives you more points in boldness if you flip them off during a chase
---
They could do it like Identity V's 2v8 mode. They have two big maps only for 2v8. Instead of 5 gens its 7 and the repair speed is very slow. Survivors take 3 hits to down instead of 2. All debuffs like Thana stack if both killers are running them.
---
I would make a pun arrest, but that’s really good and probably unintentional. Go on son
---
It's not toxic. It's usually not the right way to go if you want to win and it is an incredibly boring playstyle for both sides (I've spoken against it in numerous messages on this forum), but in itself it is not toxic.
---
It is just boring. It's only toxic if you're not doing it to win, it's toxic when you are doing it to ruin someone's day. If you ignore everyone else, not even hit them, just to go after that one person then yes, I think it is toxic.
---
Spirit and Leatherface in the same tier? Oh my, that won’t do. That won’t do at all.
---
I had a survivor tell me I was gen camping. What does that even mean? Guarding generators is literally my objective.
---
r/dbdgonewild is gonna want a *loooong* version of this.
---
My only thing is that it feels insanely powerful(like some of the killers in the game *cough* nurse *cough*) and might need some balance changes. Otherwise sounds awesome. 
---
Also, I could be wrong since I obviously haven't played against it, but still
---
Love when people take the figurative use of "literally" literally to try to strengthen their argument. It doesn't make your argument better: it just makes you look like a smart-ass.
---
Sums up my killer gameplay  pretty well
---
then don't take flashlight :) I am a survivor main and flashlight has never been vital for me.
---
Really cool, a chest closing on my arm while pennywise gets closer to me will make me die.
---
Oh yah, I love just to fuck around and go on looting missions, I wait till I have a bunch of coins saved up and start burning them, I’ve pulled some nice shit out of maps for myself and random solo teammates. I normally left flashlights because I sucked ass at aiming them. 
---
But last night I got on and figured what the Hell I have 19 purple flashlights and enough batteries to keep the energizer bunny running for a year, let’s bring it. Well with the new controller joystick update the poor Shirtless Michael got the shit blinded out of him the hole match. I can’t believe how much easier it is to aim and stay on target. So I might be bringing more in the future. 
---
Also I’m not normally toxic but after the 4th game in a row of being facecamped, I wanted some revenge and got the same killer 2 games in a row. On PS4 btw but the 5th game we all got out alive.
---
I did not blind her I did not oh hi Myers. Memes aside I feel killers consider people with flashlights toxic so they tunnel them so they can get out of the match earlier and not deal with getting blinded
---
But your team mates should still fear death, even more...
---
I mean, it depends on the situation. If you're hovering near me every time I get a down, you can bet I'm going to turn my focus on you.
---
I tried it on legion through a pallet
---
How’d you get ghostface? Data mining maybe?
---
Great idea, beep beep will be way too strong on doc though.
---
Don't mean to sound like a prick, but you prolly shouldn't have tried to learn to play from youtubers. There are some that offer good build advice, but most of what they do in-game, you *can't* learn/replicate from watching their vids.
---
Learning and improving a playstyle that fits *you* is the important part.
---
The world will never be ready, *but we believe in you*
---
No mither main here can confirm
---
I didn't even think it was that outrageous. To be in a situation to complain about Deliverance as the last survivor it typically means the other 3 have been hooked multiple times while avoiding being hooked yourself.  In general this is a bad idea, all 4 players should try to evenly spread the killer's attention to maximize the chances to repair gens. 
---
So when I see people complaining about this very specific scenario, it means they want to be rewarded for playing poorly. That's the last thing DbD needs.
---
I mean if I’m being blinded constantly as a killer by one person and one person only I’m gonna get them out of my way, especially if they’re being toxic
---
Now she's a hentai protagonist
---
What does a onlooker see? Just the thing playing out yeah?
---
Good Billys yeah
---
How old are you that you would think imaginary cool points mean anything?
---
Would have gone with Nyea
---
Ah, yes, more material.
---
I had no idea who  to place him as so I left him as blank.
---
Honestly EGC does nothing to stop teabagging. All it does is stop Survivors from holding the game hostage.
---
Baby steps but it isn't the be-all end-all.
---
Thanks! You too :)
---
I mean looping is literally how the survivors stay alive against competent killers, I don't think there is anything bad about it.
---
Old meme. That being said I actually modded Urban Evasion to Kochi pose, because I had to have the We're Gonna Farm Forever icon as well. :P
---
I usually remember where the easy to spot totems that I see over the course of the game and then check some after exit is powered.
---
It makes sense because the survivor is performing worse because they are afraid of dying.  
---
Turns out dead people.. Aren't afraid of dying..
---
Because they dead.
---
SWF = toxic
---
Playing killer = toxic
---
if only we could dodge every killer
---
Good point
---
So its fine to loop then T Bag in front of them, THEN do it agian and again with a flashlight every time? 
---
Or body block so the killer cant move? 
---
You use tricks to survive, we are allowed to use tricks to get kills
---
Blood warden is now OP.
---
Nope, we will have people force spawning it and waiting 2 minutes for the free key...
---
Dear god...he's advancing...SFM videos now...!
---
Fear of extreme pain/injury seems more accurate
---
I think an interesting idea would be for him to get  the body and weapon of a survivors corresponding killer. For example chaseing nea he will turn into the nurse and against quentin turn into freddy.
---
So you’re saying you’re bad?
---
I played against a SWF last night as Legion. I managed to get one sacrifice, could have been three if two of their players weren’t running Mettle of Man. I played extremely fairly, never tunneled once, had everyone except one player hooked twice before I got my first sacrifice, etc. Still got the teabag at he exit gate. They’re getting Mori’d next time I run into them. 
---
I actually hunted for the them for about 10 mins after the match (I would dodge the lobby if they weren’t in my game). Ended up getting them in a lobby and they dodged me lol.
---
This is why everyone gives Dwight a bad rap
---
And here we see Claudette being a dumbass and fucking her entire team in the process. Or as it's refered to in various parts of upstate New York: "Claudette being Claudette."
---
Dc should be punished once Dedicated are in place. Not because people like you would get punished but because it would lead to many false positives. Also you won't have that excuse once dedicated servers arrive.
---
You aren't entitled to escape freely and easily after your team failed to complete the objective.
---
Nope just got done with a nine hour shift and don't want to deal with that lol
---
You mean Dwight's or Jake's
---
Oh you should put that in your post title it makes you sound like a hypocrite
---
What rank are you at? at my killer rank (10), I typically avoid chasing the flash light, unless i'm convinced i can get them quickly. 
---
At this rank there are people with roles, toolbox = gen rush, flash light = distraction, medkit = flexible. so therefore i put my efforts on those with toolboxes, since they're the ones with the tools and perks to get those done faster, whereas flash lights have escape perks and will try and disctract me for as long as possible.
---
If you're going to run flash light at this rank,  make sure to at least have perks that help you with looping and stuff, and act confident ( use the 1 and 2 emotes, tea bag). This sends the message you want to be chased and people like me will avoid you. 
---
However if you're at a higher tier, killers might not care what items you have yet, but know that flash lighters = bad/unfun moments and want to get rid of you fast.
---
Yes, there is nothing toxic about it.
---
Looping and using your flashlight to try and get an advantage is all fair game. Flashlights are fairly useless as they are already.
---
In-game bm is not toxic.
---
&gt;Or body block so the killer cant move?
---
Then just... hit them?
---
&gt;You use tricks to survive, we are allowed to use tricks to get kills
---
Where did I condemn anything about killers in my message? All I've said is that looping is not toxic.
---
Bitching about camping is tunneling counts. 
---
Hitting them only works so much when there is like 4 of them at once.
---
But I didn't say a word regarding tunneling/camping in my message? All I've said is that looping is not toxic.
---
&gt;Hitting them only works so much when there is like 4 of them at once.
---
Then hit them multiple times?
---
I feel you
---
Bill gates is very poor now, he donated millions to charity. Pretty much the same logic. Survivors are still in the power place, also killers got nerfed hard as hell...
---
Yeah good point I'm still new to reddit
---
I don't see anyone with flashlights, toolboxes or even medkits. Oh my God, they are wearing the same clothes so they HAVE to be toxic, right? It's not like they could just want to have fun, of course not.
---
Rank 15
---
I propose get better at putting pressure on survivors
---
Constant dc’s will get you flagged by the game’s dc system. Idk why you had to post this on Reddit, but you do you.
---
I guess, but if that’s all anyone is doing no gens are going to get done and the game won’t even get to the end
---
don’t feel ashamed about setting up macros for all of that button mashing stupidity.
---
Absolute Unit
---
I just recently played against a killer and was in a chase and the match was lagging so bad that I was waiting next to a pallet to see what the killer was gonna do then I randomly got teleported away from the pallet
---
Gens are indeed pretty fast but only to a coordinated group of half decent survivors. Not usually something you see at rank 10.
---
Cant be scared if your dead
---
I play survivor so I can be the killer
---
Ok, let killers see how long til the Hatch opens, and once it does let them see the aura
---
Maybe a strode of luck perhaps?
---
I'll see myself out now...
---
Face camping is just bad, if he did that he lost the game (or the other survivors didn't deserve to win at all)...
---
That looks familiar lol
---
That’s not going to work as well with the new end game.  They only take a few seconds to do and it’s always better to be safe then dead.
---
Why? Why give survivors more chances to escape? Do your objective... wtf
---
Is that noob3 resolution??
---
Yeah I find jakes do it quite often too lol
---
Holy shit i full ly expected lots of salt from that. Im so proud of this community
---
It's because you aren't afraid of being dead anymore once you are dead
---
Nah, it's Phantom Blood
---
They would in DBD too. Think of something like Trapper and Billy/LF where all the spots you can run them around are trapped, Freddy and Legion where matches would last days, Trapper and Amanda where all the Jigsaw boxes have traps on them
---
I agree with the tunneling thing lol as a survivor main I'm pretty used to a lot of killers being too stupid to understand when it's time to end a chase
---
Ghost gang is probably gonna be a new one considering we're getting ghostface as a killer.
---
“Claudettes, Claudettes everywhere”
---
Ahh you’ve never heard of dying light
---
You're a killer main aren't you? 2 killers would decimate 6 survivors and it wouldn't be remotely fair
---
Flashlight saves can lose a killer a lot of momentum. It’s definitely in their interest to down them early.
---
I smell a repost
---
Reading this, I just imagine in Samination style huntress with Iron Maiden just throwing multiple survivors out of the locker (clown car style) trying to get hatchets.
---
Your username is probably the most vile I've ever seen.
---
EGC is easy for any killer, honestly. Most of the time, the gates are too close to each other for the survivor to do a thing.
---
bruh, thats the best part xD
---
They cant say you tunnel since everybody looks the fucking same xD
---
Yeah I think they should move the gates apart to make it a little more fair for survivors
---
[Haven't we all at some point](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b1xj6v/were_gonna_pose_forever/)
---
Really? Spine Chill and BL prevented me from even getting downed multiple times in a game. On Haddenfield, you can create infinite loops. I survived to the end game because of that. 
---
When at the gate, I can tell if the killer is coming in my direction and I can hide or wait till they check the area and leave for the other gate due to Spine Chill. Spine Chill let’s me know when it is safe to stay on a gen, or if spirit, nurse, Myers, or wraith are coming near. 
---
In the games I play as killer OR survivor, 1 person may get downed by NOED, if it even procs. By that point, it is usually their last hook anyway and everyone else leaves. I have very rarely seen more than 1 down in one of my own games. 
---
The only exception to that was a single Hag game I was in where NOED actually hit. I ended up downing the remaining 3 survivors. That happened once. Nearly every other time, the totems where cleansed first. That is why I don’t run it as killer (unless I don’t have any other perks unlocked), it rarely pays off. When it does proc, everyone was usually in the exit gates by the time I got to them. Running whisperers or Franklins gets me more downs (people coming back for their gear) throughout the game. 
---
Maybe in your games no one cleaned totems and people don’t GTFO after the last gen, then people try to loop the killer like before. I don’t see that. Maybe you do see that and all the survivors suddenly become potatoes after the last gen. That has not been my experience. 
---
In the games I play, either side, NOED will down 1 or maybe 2 people. That is taking away 2 hits. BL and Spine Chill (and other exhaustion perks) save a survivor 2 or 3 times a match. That is 8-12 hits combined. Spine Chill and BL (or other exhaustion perks) make the game easy mode.
---
Adorable. Kitty Nea looks like such a tsundere. :)
---
Then u deserve to be teabagged at the exit gates
---
Can’t teabag from the hook sweaty
---
Never knew there was a ranking system, does higher rank give rewards or is it just a more better matchmaking experience?
---
Yes while I got facecamped my team didnt do gens. Made my death useless lol
---
Not happening and your reasons are lame af. If you messed up that badly just accept the loss.
---
Happened to me twice today. I love embarassing myself.
---
That’s why you hit while your there. 🤔
---
I mean, honestly, it just makes the game more challenging for survivors, which imo isn't bad. I find that the game heavily favors survivors, so this at least cuts down on toxicity at the end of games, as well as lights fires under survivor asses.
---
They nerfed pig but left noed when they added EGC, they really want us to do fucking dulls
---
I come close to double pipping on a pretty regular basis, and even actually achieve it every now and then. I like to win, but I don't play super duper competitively either. For instance I rarely run Ruin. I also like to play a variety of killers too like Spirit, Pig, Huntress, and Plague, but I'll also play the others that I have if I get dailies for them. If I play for the majority of a season before reset I'll usually get to rank 2-4.
---
[MERZBOW INTERVENTION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AguPH0XBxdw&amp;t=2350s)   ^^^the ^^^legions ^^^true ^^^theme
---
And the unhook bar is completely full on your end
---
The fact that you said "In Haddonfield" shows its another in game problem and not a BL problem. NOED can be found or escaped but when it's not a super organised swf it makes it hard and annoying to come against.
---
It wouldn't be an advantage it'd just be impossible for survivors to win at that point. You are bad at balancing, stop trying
---
you've accepted your fate but also "we dont plan on putting dbd on the switch"
---
That's why you gotta let them hit you first so they're recovering from the swing while you get them off lol
---
Wouldn’t be a perfect game without that... same with the wiggle bar
---
You know the killer is supposed to have the upper hand right? Theres a reason its 4 v 1 and not a 1 v 1. The day they added perks that made it so a single survivor could take on a killer is the day they fucked up the game.
---
I've already begun the transformation... soon.
---
OK but in doing that gate progress should also regress when not fully opened. Survivors abuse mechanics just as much by 99ing gates until everyone's safe and healed up to avoid being out on the egc timer until they're good and ready. It's literally going against the entire reason egc exists at all.
---
I didn't think the head shake to be something like that. My apologies. Maybe also give that postgame knowledge in advance too. 
---
But while we're at it, do me a favor and don't ever insinuate something like that. You don't know me, so you shouldn't make such baseless assumptions.
---
Yeah, but I like taking hits for them so they can get a head start, plus that’ll probably end up with me on the hook knowing my luck
---
A life for a life and the whole team lives!
---
I love the chest closing perk! It’d be super creepy just minding my business opening a chest then suddenly it closes shut on my arm and then next thing I know pennywise is standing right behind me ready to yank me off his chests lol
---
The egc exists so that survivors can't hold the match hostage by hiding/not leaving and to put an end to the hatch standoff. It's literally here so that we don't have to waste time and get into another match faster.
---
It is not supposed to give either side an advantage, it is not a killer/survivor buff.
---
If you don't want the gate to be 99'd, you can open it yourself as killer to trigger EGC.
---
Hatch opens for the last survivor regardless of how many gens are done now. If a killer is doing their job well then they just risk the hatch spawning close to the last survivor. The only counterplay is basically what you're complaining about.
---
I try, good luck in your games
---
Ha, I guess... I did that the last game and they all just teabag at the gate until I died. But at least they got out
---
Is your tv in “game” mode?
---
Last Samination's parody (there, we also discover that Plague has bulimia)
---
Youre posting a lot lately huh?
---
Not if they've got two killers on their asses
---
Hope you like Borrowed Time Cutie X3
---
Not bannable though. Even though it ruins  a Killers experience. Sound kinda similar?
---
Double blade was bannable because it could ruin a survivors experience.
---
Hmmmmm
---
Is it bad if I agree?
---
They failed to complete the gens ? They lost, the hatch/gates are meant to be a slim chance of escape not a guaranteed escape.
---
2 distract 1 each
---
Other 4 plow gens
---
Seems pretty simple to me
---
Better grab the monster condom

Then you slugged and back on that hook young buck
---
Me looping the killer for 5 minutes: “WHAT THE HELL IS MY TEAM DOING?”
---
My teammates:
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
I recommend not using STBFL and Nurse's, ruin and m&amp;a are good.
---
Once you get it, use bbq instead of Nurse's and either enduring or whispers instead of STBFL. Enduring will make you better at chases, while Whispers will make it easier to sneak up on people with your non-existant terror radius thanks to your m&amp;a + dead rabbit!
---
Not to say STBFL and Nurse's are bad perks, I just think the ones I've mentioned play better with Mike's kit. If you find them better then there is nothin wrong with that, if you plan to replace any of the with BBQ then I'd choose Nurse's.
---
It would be a mini dying light
---
Definitely.
---
As far as I can tell, that's usually where they hang out anyway.
---
Inc. BW nerf in 3.2.1...
---
Irk why this ISNT a thing already? I literally change outfits every game.
---
Once you're dead there's nothing to fear.
---
Wouldn't this same scenario happen if they had finished all the gens? One survivor left, no chance of getting out because Billy is too fast and the gates are too close.
---
Funny because the guy that actually made this picture is gay.
---
Yep basically said what I typed but better.
---
Finally, I thought I was alone on this one.
---
diiirty
---
I like your flair
---
Well, the 'no nose' was only for Thomas Hewitt from the 2003 film.
---
We never see the original Leatherface, Bubba Sawyer Junior, unmasked.
---
It could a driver conflict, or your connection. Nvidia just released a new driver ... have you downloaded that!  
---
Edit: also try this site and see if you have the specs. It’s safe. Dead by daylight doesn’t show as a whole game just pick one of the chapters 
---
https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/
---
You can do this even better with Tombstone Myers. The insta-kill doesn't count as an offensive action so you can kill the obsession as soon as you get all three stacks and then you'll have all three for the rest of the game.
---
Correct sir; that was Thomas Hewitt in the 2003 remake of TCM (and TCM: The Beginning, if you wanna get technical)
---
Wasn't talking about leaving them, was talking about downing them. Get better at that.
---
And the idea that you could consistently get 4ks with Freddy but are still scared of a single survivor looping you for 5 gens doesn't add up. What rank? 15?
---
Perfect.
---
A good survivor is always better than a good killer. This has been the undeniable truth for a long time my dude
---
All the more reason to not be afraid of death I guess 🤔
---
God's work, son
---
Because in the in game store you can buy characters with shards or leftover auric cells. In the Xbox store BHVR is guaranteed the most money.
---
Ne-Nya
---
This is dope
---
When is High Min
---
Guess you also suck...
---
No they just bad, i honestly like the legion change, makes you think twice before swinging in feral frenzy since you cant spam it, also making him 115% was a great choice
---
&gt; Survivor killer: No SWF allowed for this specific killer. Meaning the game only pulls solo survivors into this killer’s lobby. 
---
Sweet, just queue into the game as this killer and then swap to Billy or Nurse and trash the randoms. All they'd have done with this is waste time giving people who cry "It was SWF!" longer wait times and make them find some other way of saying they got screwed over.
---
&gt; Also the power could involve switching which survivor is cloned, meaning if you know he was Shirtless David the first time you saw him he might have changed into a clone of a different survivor the next time, even a clone of whichever survivor you currently are.
---
That doesn't matter. If you get attacked by another Survivor, you're not going to go near another survivor again. If one starts running towards you, be it Shirtless David or anyone else, you're going to start booking it. Which means the killer either chases you around at 100% speed, or they drop their act and they're at 115% movespeed without an ability.
---
&gt;  You could chase a survivor across the map and maybe they’re too good at looping so you switch and appear back at the basement. Or they could just have the killer switch into the next killer instantaneously and just have different abilities. Maybe one form is faster while the other has better tracking abilities and the only difference survivors see is them morphing into a completely different skin. There’s a lot of possibilities.
---
That sounds like a lot of work that could just go into several different Killers instead of one gimped one.
---
Chess would like to have a word.
---
Already out the gates by then big boy
---
Survivors will still whine but Legion is ultra fair. They get a semi easy first hit but after that they gotta play by the rules. The rules being loops and pallets and more loops and some extra pallets
---
Nurses is t really a good perk as it’s very situational so get rid of nurses.
---
I have an issue with the WHOLE BAR being depleted on a miss, especially with all the other nerfs, maybe missing can take away half instead?
---
Without advice?
---
You tryna say how she just barges in without knocking?
---
No, but you may still get a few dc's from idiotic players.
---
Myers: This party’s over!
---
[Great minds] (http://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b3y5qm/when_you_dont_see_a_survivor_but_the_chase_music/)
---
Hahahahahahahaha no.
---
It could be such an awesome perk, but BHVR is too chickenshit to raise the numbers higher.
---
It is strange, but here's the real kicker... the perk is complete shit anyway.
---
Everyone injured grants a total of 12 seconds to generator completion time, which can be mitigated with great skill checks. It literally does nothing... its all mental on the survivor's side - they see a red bar and go OH MY GAWD ITS MOVING SO SLOW I GOTTA GET RID OF IT!!
---
Just power through it guys, its worthless even at full strength.
---
Honestly that's the joy of the Meta and running of non-Meta perks. 
---
Yeah, it's "Bad", but if you can use it  to win and counter one very specific thing, it's actually quite good. It's not about what it does, but how you use it.
---
Deja Vu is great at preventing yourself from being 3-genned, Detective's Hunch is amazing at finding totems (especially with a map), and Wake Up is pretty good for letting randoms know which door you're opening.
---
Doesn't mean there aren't bad perks (Technician comes to mind for one), but you can get a lot of mileage out of perks very few people use simply because they aren't "meta".
---
I'm so glad I figured this out back in my LoL days. I remember taking Mordekaiser with Heal and Cleanse to the dismay of many back in the day, but ended up getting to the point of running into a 1v5 situation and killing 3 of them before they could take me out.
---
10 minutes? Surprised the killer didn’t come by then
---
Some miscellaneous icons I made. The misc. sets will mostly contain memes, jokes, alternate character cosmetics, etc.

I just really want to play peekaboo around corners.
---
Play like a douche, hard patrol, Sloppy butcher+Nurses calling, Make Your Choice, even NOED. If you know they have flashlights use that to your advantage. A guy always going for flashlight saves is an actual blessing because he'll never be on a gen when you down someone.
---
Lol I was just joking around, solid meme my dude
---
r/F13thegame exists
---
even they have issues with licensing and permissions
---
The amount of times I get the shit scared out of me when I am chainsaw sprinting through corn and hit a random survivor that was hiding is too embarrassing to count
---
They most probably won't if you're the "friendly killer"
---
I usually buy cells in game and never have anything left. I figured via Microsoft store would net Microsoft the money.
---
I was thinking about it. I might swap Nurse's out sometimes but given this add-on combo gives no incentive to go into Tier 3 (in fact I literally save it for the endgame or when I'm in "I'm done messing around!" situations) because that Terror Radius with the Dead Rabbit and Monitor is down to 4 meters. It is downright minuscule, and the amount of times I've actually managed to catch Survivors off guard when they're healing is insane. 
---
However, BBQ isn't without its uses. We all know that. I might wait until the perk is Tier 3 to use and then I'll work on getting used to the aura reading.
---
I also think this build could get a lot out of surveillance as well...
---
[deleted]
---
(Killers can absolutely take advantage of this, as if they leave via the Leave Game button it kicks you out normally, if they pull the plug on their internet it cancels the game instead of having them leave)
---
Aww, that sucks
---
Fair enough
---
I mean you get moved to a lower rank but so does everyone else at your rank. So you'll be up against the same players until it all equals out. If you're purple now you'll be at green with the other purples
---
What I think should be implemented is that the Exit Gate indicator lights should show full regardless of charge on them. Allows more mindgames and less "go look for colored lights, oh look survivor is over here"
---
Why though? I'd rather play and lose a three man than wait 45 minutes just to wait again.
---
*Laughs in Object of Obsession*
---
Billy needs a cool down!!
---
He’d be pretty terrible
---
I thought the term was Squadette. And there is Squadwight too.
---
Mind you, the Pig does have add-ons that make it where more boxes spawn. You could get 4 of them down and still not be able to get it off because it's in the fifth.
---
There's also Amanda's Letter, which reduces it down to two boxes, but almost no one uses that.
---
I think a good Nurse comboed with a basement Leatherface would actually be a scary combo.
---
Both go hunting at the start, then after they get a couple, Leatherface starts camping them all in the basement. Nurse goes hunting, Leatherface guards each kill so Nurse just needs to down them once.
---
Nurse would bring Agitation and perks to help bring to basement and find people, Leatherface would bring passive perks/totems to slow down the game like Ruin.
---
Ehhhh more like killers will stay at the low ranks away from toxic survivors
---
What's hard about using Whispers? You walk towards an area, if it doesn't light up then they aren't there so you ignore the area and go somewhere else till it lights up. Easy as that.
---
Gl in your games!
---
why would killers legitimately not want to use their best perks? the goal of playing killer is to kill, not make sure survivors escape. Try learning and counter playing so you can become better as a survivor and not have as much as a problem as you are now.
---
r/TIHI
---
That's true, but often means leaving any chance of defending the post gens unhook, or getting someone else in their place, as you walk to a gate to force it open so they unhook and scurry out the other 99d one
---
Im definitely not sad about this just to clarify
---
Damnit, Allan!
---
If I get blinded at a pallet stun, I won't tunnel, but you are on my shitlist. It is infuriating to get blinded, or get flashlight clicked at over and over again. So yeah, I totally understand why some killers will tunnel that. If you flashlight click me as a killer I give you a love tap to stop your screaming as a courtesy for both of our ears, and another one to reciprocate the BM. :P
---
If you can't handle someone crouching in a video game, stop playing the game. Problem solved.
---
I can agree to brutal strength. 
---
Let's see, how do I say this? DR+M&amp;A drops EW2 Terror Radius to just 4 meters. It's incredible.
---
Yes it does. In shooter games, even Fornite, I am on an even playing field. I have a gun, they have a gun, we all have access to the same stuff. DBD doesn't have that.
---
God forbid you die, even though you just escaped 7 times in a row.
---
To be fair, Nurse is pretty broken, so that's more about player frustration and imbalance than people being absolute cunts.
---
This is the fucking truth.
---
Great point haha. A normal M1 killer with no terror radius is silly. I would ditch STBFL and keep BS with this. Stalk at pallets as much as I need and then break it quickly. 
---
Another top tier perk is always bamboozle. Them damn windows can cripple a Myers game is played right by survivors.
---
What anime is that?
---
I pretty much run DS and deliverance now as mandatory after so many games of teammates not helping or trying to farm me off hook or me getting tunneled. I don't have mettle of man yet though :(
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Wataten!: An Angel Flew Down to Me
---
wtf is he holding
---
Id say a blunt but that looks more like a twig
---
Yes, that doesn't mean she isn't still one of the better killers against it. Same as old ds, a free hit doesn't buy you anywhere near as much against nurse as an m1 killer.
---
To be fair, it's not like people stack other perks and we *know* their internal meta is vastly different than ours ("Separate all Survivors" is something they think a *killer* wants at the start of the match....), they probably just thought it wasn't something worth worrying about.
---
I do forsee a MoM nerf here pretty quick though. Not because it's overbearing, but because it's keeping the weak killers down.
---
i'm a proud rank 1 Freddy main for over a year now. Legion used to be my go to girl to relax cause freakishly overpowered and broken and didn't require skill or brain to stab stab stab. i don't think i ever lost a chase apart from this one p3 Claudette with Iron Will and No Mither. 
---
but it was a guilty pleasure. such ease to crash swfs. i might miss it a bit tbh cause now when i see obvious toxic swf(and as a red rank PC player you mostly play with same people so you know for a fact who you're facing) i gotta stick to Hag or do a scammy Rin build if i don't feel like being bullied for no good reason(i don't play Billy or Nurse or Huntress)
---
and now Legion is a bit weaker than Rin and obviously not broken so i use her for normal games. and it's really fun. people still dc. even on fukin Ormond(broken ass map way too in favour for survivors). i don't understand why though, Legion is perfectly loopable and mindgameable, weaker than Hag or Spirit(and i don't get many dcs on them, mostly people just kill themselves on hook if teammates suck). 
---
&gt;tldr: no, even with old Legion you could choose to not be toxic and play Legion like you play them right now - with spreading damage and then chasing people down normal way. Legion by itself couldn't make you a toxic player, to be toxic you need to choose to abuse broken mechanics. 
---
people often disagree with me here but i strongly believe that BBQ on Billy is broken and way too much in favour. when even Nurse can only use it to pinpoint the location and from there gotta guess where survivor goes(or be real good at Omega blinks but she still has fatigue), Billy has inbuilt ability to snipe the person they saw with BBQ and apparently it's survivors' fault to be on an opened map. and i know how to deal with BBQ =\ i tricked killers many times by simply changing direction but it's always luck with Billy, that's what i call broken.
---
Oh, I know haha. I remember those matches where I was left with a skillcheck Doc and 1 teammate with 4 gens left. Not fun times lmao
---
Has a Gorillaz vibe.
---
Freddy d tier? His perk that blocks the exit would make him a tier for sure man
---
Sounds like mommy never loved you lol. Chill bud. Its a fucking redit post
---
Thank's 😃
---
The tutorial doesn't teach looping or chases. It will tell you to run and break line of site. I personally want practice modes. A killer just chases you around pallets. A endless generator for skill check practice. A hard mode of that where its constant skill checks but only greats work. A survivor that just loops forever.
---
Id you are shortening her name to Claud, then you say Squad. Otherwise it's Claudette Squadette.
---
Its not and you know its not, its never fair its never even. He could have had better start, better rng, better team mates, he could be cheating... I also gave plenty of other examples where you're NEVER in a even playing field.
---
Nice strawman
---
tks mate &lt;3
---
That’s Dwightist
---
Legion is much weaker now.
---
Not with a 4 meter terror radius it isn't.
---
At chases? Sure. But I know to cleanse totems, to crouch against the Hag, etc.
---
But, you're probably one of the randoms who crouch all game walking in circles and escape with sub 1,000 points, so I don't except you to understand
---
I can get behind this 100%, I love games having some sort of mechanic testing so you can try in less stressful situations, and even see how perks change these.
---
The only time I'll tbag with the other survivors.
---
The greater the risk the greater the reward. But seriously... kill your friends or whatever it’s called is perfect for what your asking. It really is.
---
That's the main thing. I want to see how perks change the skill checks.
---
He was balanced
---
Wait meg how did you get here?
---
No he got nerfed
---
You mean me, the person that just figured it out after doing 3 gens entirely by myself ;-;
---
here's the thing. when you flashlight save only salty killers will consider it toxic cause there's nothing toxic about it and killers can prevent the save.
---
but when you run around, do clicky clicky and flashlight at pallets... mate, get fukin ready to be camped and tunneled cause that shit is god damn annoying and basically you're literally asking to be tunneled with that obnoxious attention seeking. 
---
when this happens to me, i make sure whole team suffers. if some cunt at very start without even checking if i'm a fair killer(cause i am normally) does the clicky clicky and pallet blind... well, get ready for ugly 3 gen strat, slug and all the pleasures of proxy camping. call me camper, noob, whatever you like afterwards, your salt is a seasoning on my steak of your wasted time. i do, however, understand, other people in team are not to blame but it's a sacrifice i'm willing to make in order to not be frustrated after a game. tbh clicky clicky isn't that bad. but pallet blind is the worst. i wouldn't camp/tunnel/play differently than normal for just clicky clicky.
---
I have no friends who play. I've joined a couple of matches from lfg posts but it wasnt exactly a learning experience.
---
I rum BBQ,  ruin,  enduring and thantophobia/sloppy
---
The thighs don't match tho..
---
Yikes
---
Hahahaha youre so pissed about this. Go get laid dude. All that pent up sexual frustration is getting to ya. Its a game. Some people like to play it instead of waiting in lobbies. Everyone can have an opinion about this game jackass. No need to get sweaty over people who disagree with yours
---
i'm officially the dumbest player alive.
---
That really sucks. Look on the bright side, you can say you did it for your team and not for yourself!
---
Can we make this happen pls. Shaun and Ash working together tho.
---
well, yeah. don't do that. cause that's what toxic players do. you're literally taunting and asking to be tunneled. if you can't give a good chase, don't try to be toxic. it's always laughable when shit players try to taunt you with t-bag at pallets they stunned you with when you have Enduring and Spirit Fury as if they did something special and not you made them drop it. lol.
---
basically t-bag, clicky clicky and pallet blind is your way to get a tunnel.
---
LOL I laughed my ass off when you said "to crouch against the Hag" is that like a huge secret you discovered yesterday? Lol...
---
Wait, is this real? Wow. C'mon devs. This is embarrassing.
---
why?
---
Is that a fucking Hitman reference?
---
Well said.
---
Downvote for one reason. Had this happen in purple ranks on ps4 and the nea on my team could've saved me before first state but decided to leave me on hook and die just so everyone else died 2 min later. Most of the time in lower ranks they proxy camp but not to the point they cant save.
---
I have a conspiracy theory on this situation
---
Blatant stealing https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bnslx7/feng_got_a_new_skin/
---
Tbf, there really isn't any NOED equivalent. Mom is close, but nothing else is.
---
Adrenaline can easily be a wasted perk slot
---
The hatch had no benefit to the killer if they found it first, they either stand there and have a stand off or the killer goes looking and the survivor slips buy and escapes. It was boring, this isn’t boring
---
Yep, agreed. But leatherface is an easy escape that's for sure, if the gates are far apart.
---
how about you try playing killer till at least late green ranks and then reread your post. i swear you'll feel stupid. 
---
i play both sides for over a year, rank 1(well, technically 2-4 on survivor and 1-2 on killer after recent pipping change) on both. i know the struggle of being tunneled for literally no reason several games in a row and i know what it's like to get 6 red rank swfs in a row with at least one team being literally mlg. but i consider myself killer main cause it's what i enjoy the most.
---
i'll tell you the difference between mlg players and toxic cunts who mimic OchiDo and old no0b3: they don't bm. the worst i saw from mlg players was pointing for when i mess up. they are not toxic they're just good. they don't try to taunt killers, they rarely carry flashlights or any items cause a good player doesn't need those. i fukin love facing a full mlg team. it's hard but you don't feel frustrated after the game cause they don't disrespect you therefore don't ruin the killer immersion.
---
Oh noooo someone spammed crouch whatever will I do
---
Me too. I mean I'm a decent killer. Sometimes groups are pretty hardcore. Killers can be miles behind a group even if they are decent because tactics get so advanced that you literally have to choose between multiple things you cant guard 3 gens effectively. You can hook someone or run them off but in the meantime objectives are still happening.
---
[**Here you go.Its available here.**](http://21.robindro.host)
---
It's a bug that needs to be fixed immediately because not hearing Ash speak is groundbreaking.
---
It may be a tad annoying but it’s a free 3k at least since they’re busy tbagging and flashlight clicking instead of doing gens. When you down someone just pick them up while looking at a wall. If you arent by a wall just fake a pickup and one of his buddies will be running up to try to flashlight save. Slug and down the other guy.
---
If they hook block you get 3+ free hits. As long as it doesnt always take 2min for you to down someone they wont be able to do it again on your next down.
---
&gt;They only take a few seconds to do and it’s always better to be safe then dead.
---
They take 16 seconds which is a fifth of a gen, not counting time wasted running around looking for them. And if you only do totems that are easy to find/in your path and dont get all 5, noed will spawn on the totems that are harder to locate. 
---
You arent better safe than dead if that time ends up being the difference between powering the exits vs not even reaching end game. It's a frustrating mechanic. From the stats they gave us, killers run noed 12% of the time. It doesn't feel great to know you completely wasted your time cleansing in 88% of your games.
---
Correct, but by itself it means "you want some?" 
---
Thanks High School Spanish
---
Shitty meme.  
---
Great title
---
No joke but the title is a better meme than the meme itself
---
I agree. Getting a 4k and deranking because every survivor died on their first hook is stupid.
---
For fucks sake, its ONE extra hit a killer has to do.
---
What's next, a perk that speeds up gens by 1 second getting nerfed because people are crying about it?
---
I'm sorry if this upsets anyone, but it needs to be said.
---
Also, if a killer is still complaining about BT/DS, just don't camp/tunnel. Problem solved
---
This is correct. This is all correct.

Fun fact is that spine chill also works on vault speeds.
---
have you tried them on ptb? cause i did and playing killer was the worst experience and playing survivor was not much different without dedicated servers. still unpleasant lag and stutter even on late green - early yellow ping. can't tell about early green cause never found a game with less than 80ms.
---
Why not chainsaw the Nea first? Then get Meg.
---
Playing like this = playing like an asshole. Stop.
---
Imo I like it better seeing "Brutal, Ruthless etc" instead because it shows I did something, to me.
---
No, it's just piss easy
---
Well with hitboxes nowadays I need every precious second I can get lol I’ll definitely try it out
---
No we get the "killer teabag" where they juggle us and toy with us before we die to the entity
---
NOED = no one escapes death
---
Basically if all the gens are powered a totem becomes a hex totem and the killer can down in one hit
---
Is the same guy that tried to 360 a myers on haddonfield and then blamed it on the bench
---
Reworked
---
Sorry you don't get your free escape anymore...
---
This is the worst bug for me so far. I legit always forget until I finish repairing a gen and receive no points.
---
Really? Patch notes say this:
---
&gt;Feature - Games that would start with less than 5 players are canceled, and all players still connected to the server will be returned to the tally screen (keeping their items, add-ons and offerings)
---
Sounds like they intended for offerings to not get burned, so it could be bugged.
---
Well that explains why I only had 11000 BP
---
yes you can! also sadly i don’t, i’m not confident enough in posting my art there because my style constantly changes
---
The original BNP was. The 2nd version of it? Perfect.
---
Now it's worse then a Clean Rag.
---
I'm just waiting for the last good ultra rare add on for survivors (syringe) to get nerfed into the ground like the others.
---
Because only killers are allowed to have good ultra rares
---
im unstoppable!

I'd like to see a mousy claudette :3
---
i love the way you color these! tysm!! &lt;3
---
Killers definitely have addons that need to be looked at. I don't want one side to have all the good shit, I want a fun and balanced game. But any time you (god forbid) point out that something one role has may be a bit too powerful and you never hear the end of it.
---
“Oh no”
---
Man I'd be hype to use a set of these as art replacements in game
---
Why not also release a Gale skin for Jane and a Tatum skin for Kate or Laurie?
---
 I've escaped a couple times as a survivor running between gates after hatch was closed. It's more difficult but as someone who plays both sides, I think its definitely more fun and adds some variety to the endgame. The hatch standoff was God awful for both sides
---
YES
---
I'll agree, even though i'm a survivor main. At T3, it slows gens down by like 12 seconds. 
---
And that's with everyone injured.
---
You cant fear death if you're already dead
---
Maybe if he has whispers not so much since he can tell what gate you're headed to, but if there's more than one survivor then hes for sure bad
---
"I have the high ground"
---
Okay, you have Stealth fully charged, you pop it, now your TR is gone, you see a survivor and start stalking them, the survivor sees you, a ping sound is heard and THEN your stealth starts depleting. After it's fully depleted, your outta stealth and you have to wait for it to recharge fully.
---
It yields fuck all points is my problem, let it get you survival points.
---
Save The Best For Last, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Hex Ruin? That's how I run him nowadays.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
DS was also only ONE more hit the killer had to do for the down. It was still unhealthy for the game like MoM.
---
Just like old DS, it can happen four times a game with no recourse for the survivors. It's a free hit, essentially, with no downsides.
---
MoM has no counter play. Therefore it should change. Simple as that.
---
That is in the title, yes. Astute observation
---
While I SOMEWHAT see your point, I think the death debuff should be a static 3/4//5% per person killed
---
you ever had a team with 3+ MoMs as killer? cause i had. and i have worse opinion of it than old ds. old ds you could counter by downing people strategically close to hooks. MoM you can't counter. and i'm not going to play chainsaw bois or bunny mommy exclusively to avoid MoM because i don't enjoy their powers enough. 
---
one or two MoMs in game is bit annoying. third and fourth make you lose. only counters you have - full blown camp or mori. this i'm not doing either cause i want to fukin play the game. 
---
and who in the right mind can bitch about BT or new DS?? as anything, i actually respect players with BT and don't know if anyone has DS cause i don't fukin tunnel.
---
Dont think there honestly is one anymore. Theres iridescent button which can be annoying to pallet loopers and theres the quick cooldown build who can be slightly difficult. I cant think of any toxic perks to run. Bamboozle would be annoying when combined with iridescent button, but not too toxic. Just a good build
---
Might be. Definitely would not surprise me in the least!
---
Agreed. It'd be like the old legion. It would be easy to make 1-2 survivors games a living hell, while the others all escape. I feel like double teaming would work well on some of the near infinite loops, but would be terrible for applying lots of pressure. I also feel like you'd have some games where one killer camps hook, while the other goes hunting for kills. Again, not a great strategy, but it'd be foolish to think some people wouldn't do that. It has a lot of potential to be great, but I can also think of numerous situations where it'd be awful
---
If people get off on doing this in a video game, stop playing the game.  Problem solved.
---
Bloodweb be like "More Purple fog offerings and worthless oaks to increase the number of hooks? Got it!"
---
What’s easy
---
I think the closest you’d see to that would be pinhead.
---
MoM can pop early, and EVEN then, it's ONE extra attack a killer has to do.
---
ONE.
---
And no one fucking cleanses totems anymore for some weird reason. Go ahead, bring Small Game, take out 4 totems, then watch NOED activate 8/10 times at endgame
---
*Cries in Dwight main*
---
Fuck that go, what a asshole.
---
Toss save the best for last..... or nurses. That is a hard one for sure.

Getting a 4K. If you kill 3 people, the 4th is handed to you essentially
---
Just ask ... I’ve had killers ask me many times for help with a daily. As long as they let me farm a little I’m down to help.
---
Woah woah woah. Who said they were getting the gates powered?
---
its at a point where running max cool down now puts you on the same cool down as using no add ons before the Change.
---
TBH Im using all my Iridicent Buttons and Max duration since the rework.....and hope for better times
---
yeah, i know, i read your post and see why you mentioned BT and DS. i replied to the guy who thought you think BT and DS are in any way imbalanced perks. you didn't bitch about it :3 he/she did
---
Alot of killers still bitch about BT/DS
---
The second I hear a heartbeat after a teammate gets an orange bar I just run in a straight line. Eventually I hear a Legion stun noise far off in the distance.
---
Meh, the magic of it will fade.
---
I don't mind at all if killers bring noed. I actively break totems and have prevented it from appearing. Survivors have an obscene amount of second chance perks and items now, so what's wrong with killers bringing their equivalent that has multiple counters?
---
Lord forgive me, for what I must do
---
Joey looking a lil bit like mc ride
---
Ah I see, just misunderstood lol. Yeah those perks are fine. MoM just creates so many problems and I just want to see it adjusted, not nerfed into the ground.
---
People are so black and white in balance discussions like this.
---
Old ds to me was never much. It would be a nouing and cost me a game every once and a while against a good chaser, but I normally just downed then straight away after I ate it. (I am a nurse main though, so that helps). MoM just screws you over though, and needs changed badly
---
DS also stunned a killer for 5 seconds. And MoM does have tons of counter plays.
---
Use your power.
---
Mori.
---
Camp their 2nd hook.
---
Slug.
---
You can chain hits and/or land a double hit w Frenzy to build STBFL a lot faster than other M1 Killers, it affects coming out of Frenzy as well.
---
I mean, he pointed out your dumb logic and your response was to attack him personally rather then go after the point he is making, classic ad hominem. Never change internet, never change.
---
Ikr?
---
First time is usually the only time someone wants to get there lol.
---
Cause he's having a good time
---
*Diamond is not crash
---
I'd be pissed if they added Cindy and pretended she was Sidney.
---
Oh that sounds important, I didn't know that last bit
---
anyone notice how he ran away from a gate when his whispers were clearly going off
---
Doesn't change much, they should fix that before releasing the dedicated servers but thats it.
---
i heard you. and i questioned at least the mend option since old BT is gone. cause they didn't add a single downside to MoM(the aura reveal is barely a downside, not only you counter it by healing 99 you don't even have to hide your aura cause most MoMs happen endgame and killers can't be arsed to "locate" survivors since they will be by few remaining gens anyway and if they're not they're no threat).
---
The first leak could have been an accident. Accidents don't happen twice, unless the people who did it are dumber than a bag of shit.
---
So either this was intentional or BHVR is full of max tier 4Heads.
---
Let's hope. Old legion was strong and a tunneling/exploiting legion was annoying and unfair, but a legion that wasn't doing that was fair.
---
The only real change I think legion needed was the slight add-on rework (because I'm sorry but Frank's mix tape plus cold dirt is almost as bullshit as infinite tombstone myers), and the timer not going down in terror radius. Other than that, he was pretty balanced
---
It doesn’t belong in the game, Susie is a killer and not a playful virgin. If she does get one, it would be a custom one pretty dirty since the pink or white of a unicorn would do a shitty contrast with the rest of the game
---
Oooooh my pussy's flashingggg
---
I wanted them to stay at that area
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
well then they're bad killers and their opinion doesn't matter
---
Would need a big buff to even be close to the same level as baseline BBQ
---
4 man Squadette, Mettle of Man squad with adrenaline, flash lights and insta heals. Mettle of Man is fun :)
---
Idk about Flagellant but... The Collector maybe? Collecting the heads of the survivors to gain power... Idk... 
---
At least he already has the name "The Collector"
---
As long as it's covered in blood and the horn drips blood I don't see why not.
---
"That's not groovy, baby" - Ash, probably
---
&gt; so, if a killer is still complaining about BT/DS, just don't camp/tunnel. Problem solved
---
ok then so what if-
---
&gt; Camp their second hook
---
nice consistency there mate
---
I don’t play as ash, but his perk can help get someone off the hook when the killer is camping or when the gates are open. So to say it’s used by someone who plays badly is nonsensical. 🧂
---
If you had deepwounds debuff on, legion's m1 can down you through MoM
---
Fuck mettle of man
---
I see spine chill I upvoe
---
Can you make a Pig version of this? I would buy it instantly if I wasn't so broke. ;-;
---
But you do agree then that there should be some sort of effect for killing a Survivor on the remaining survivors?
---
it's Reddit, what do you expect? you get downvoted to oblivion pointing out someone used meme template in a wrong way. god knows why they downvote that instead of upping their meme game. it's not even hard. just fukin knowyourmeme it and there you go.
---
I run Mettle of Man and Borrowed Time. I love when Mettle of Man is ready and the killer is camping someone near the gate with NOED. It's like yeaaa.... he's coming with me buddy.
---
I want that freddy as a vinyl sticker so bad!! Love all your stuff man!
---
MoM takes a lot of skill /s
---
Painting your monitor screen black so you can't see the game.
---
EVEN BETTER.

who requested this exactly?
---
i'm so happy someone made the joke
---
Me, trying to get more Pins and Rulers for Legion.
---
Deja Vu in Lery's is magical! I used to just stock pile lery offerings because it's normally a nightmare finding gens. one of the best perk re-works.
---
“All the swf I get” and how do you know that? how do you know whenever you encounter a swf group? not everyone is super coordinated or toxic. unless the devs implements an ability to see if they’re swf, you will never know 100%. they might tell you after the game, maybe they won’t. you can check if they’re all friends but do you do that every game?
---
it might seem like all swf groups are toxic and coordinated but the reality is that you only NOTICE swf groups if they are toxic
---
Protip from me: you need to get the map where there is this big building in the middle that has two floors. You rush the gen on 2nd floor and then hide in there as there is literally 0 cause for killer to go up there if any other survivor doesnt do so. Hide in lockers and run some kind of endgame build with killer vision so you dont bump Into him at the end
---
Sure its totally racist but the 69 at the end makes me think they are just trying to be facetious and edgy.
---
The mental trauma you just gave that poor Billy
---
They now decrease distance between them instead of changing the number of hooks
---
id say its less of a fear when someone you know dies and more of just sadness atleast that was my experience with death. But yea not everything makes complete sense but i would say since 1 stack is 1 survivor in fear the debuff becomes bigger for everyone even bc the fear is like a sickness that spreads if everyone is afraid nothing will work anymore and if some people arent afraid they may calm the others down
---
I thought it was Battle Tendency
---
it...
---
it fucking exists...

---
I honestly dont believe pinhead would be a great killer for the game, due to how his powers work. I couldn't see him chasing people.
---
Why is he tilted in every pic?c
---
I don't even see this, but at rank 15, I get killers running noed bbq and a bunch of teachables for other characters (which are max level btw) when I'm still using my characters teachables. Like, the fuck? Are y'all fake rankers or am I just bad?
---
suffering from success
---
of course its a joke lmfao, do people think im serious?
---
Tier 1 Meyers is immune to stealth perks, otherwise yes.
---
Yeah I'd personally prefer the chatterer since he's supposed to actually be the one to chase down the person who opened the box and sub due them and bring them to pinhead. I can actually see him chasing people
---
nah
---
Your talking mad shit for someone in farming distance
---
"Have you heard of our lord and savior, The Entity?"
---
About as hard as any other killer
---
people will downvote you for anything in this subreddit
---
well it's because people still DC a shitload against legion
---
Nope, that should be Joey or Frank.
---
Definitely something to make the perk worthwhile
---
That's to deal with MoM
---
Oh my god my team is injured, I’m so scared of dying
---
Lol they’re all dead now who cares
---
Seriously, either look away and wait the 2 minutes or just chase them out the gate.
---
I just hate second chance bullshit. You shouldn't be rewarded for failing. NOED, MOM, Adrenaline(kinda), all that rewards you for failing. You fail, you fail. You shouldn't be rewarded a second chance by one perk. That's some bullshit.
---
they bought the license from funworld right? what I don't get is that, people are saying the cloak isn't owned by them so they cant use it, but fun world sells the entire ghostface outfit, cloak and all, so ???
---
Come with me
---
Let me give Bubba a kiss on the cheek for face camping me
---
The white on yellow is tough to read
---
Yeah, as a doc main I feel we get a bad rap
---
yup and I don't really like it
---
Yeah big agree. If you’re not playing someone like hillbilly or huntress, you better bring some really good stuff because MoM just screws you over otherwise. It creates a bad cycle where killers need good stuff always, then survivors not running Meta perks think “wow these killers have op stuff, i better bring MoM and insta heals etc” bad cycle
---
Feels bad man :(
---
I would be happy if Pennywise gets added with the classic version (from the TV series)
---
we get some bad eggs here and there but i've been having a lot of nice games recently. Mostly play killer on PC and most survivors don't really have anything to say.
---
I mean... If you get the bonus for each dead survivor... You still gotta tunnel someone. But you're not forced to tunnel the obsession
---
Me farming memoryals for myers
---
Good thing I'm bad at using flashlights
---
You mean like 2 killers playing simultaneously on separate maps with their own 4 survivors and whoever does better in the end wins? With some type of notifying factors as to how the other killer is doing?
---
a fan made killer with a power that isn't over necessarily complicated? I dig it, the power reminds me of "stop it slender" it would be a cool power, but, I feel like it would make all other stealth killers extremely obsolete, its a direct upgrade from the wraith, I wouldn't mind a powerful stealth killer that could get into a the meta with billy and nurse, but I know the devs would.
---
All of it is bullshit, on both sides. MOM, instaheals, Adrenaline. NOED, even RANCOR, anything that allows you to take a hit or get instant downs without abilities without consequence is bullshit. It all breaks the game. It rewards you for failing. You fail, and you should just take it. But everyone complains on both sides. Its all overpowered and that's why people stick to it, and it gives the other side an excuse to stick with it too.
---
I never really did like mettle of man, I feel like it doesn't really have counter play. It's not as annoying as the original decisive strike, but it is pretty damn powerful as it is considered meta for chase oriented builds, or just general surviving. It's a really powerful perk.
---
So that's why I've only been getting coop actions points when I do a gen with someone else? OH MY.
---
wtf devs. Where's our hot patch?
---
Given the state ghostface was in in the dev build it is possible the sounds were placeholder. Stalking uses the same Myers stalk sound effect, his other 2 teachables are not complete yet, his power icon uses Myers icon, etc.
---
BHVR. Never changes

---
It depends really. Adrenaline can save your ass, basically a second chance, which I feel is bullshit, or it is basically just giving you exhaustion for a 5 second speed boost. Adrenaline doesn't punish you for playing bad, its just overpowered.
---
What does this mean? How is spine chill and vaulting related?
---
I feel like when compared to no-ed though, its nothing. Yes it's a second chance for the survivors, but it either involves them doing gens and not taking advantage of it, or managing to run a killer around and not go down before the gens are done. By itself its overpowered, just not in comparison
---
It should be Algophobia, the fear of pain.
---
de-rank, never rank up D:
---
Not if the survivor either finds or (Having spotted it earlier) gets to the hatch first. Hatch is basically a consolation prize and now it's more on whoever finds the hatch first, and not "If survivor finds it first, he jumps in, if killer finds it first, he sits and waits for the survivor to find it so they can have a standoff"
---
NOED feels like it rewards you for failing, like MOM, but Adrenaline feels like it rewards you and your team for completing your objectives. It is nothing compared to NOED, but both are still overpowered in their own right.
---
what's wrong with it? i rarely get less than 3k as Legion on red ranks. they're pretty strong.
---
Dude, whispers. If you have it, use it. You even check around rocks at one point while it’s dull
---
long Frenzy
---
They should just make multiple killers an official unranked mode. That be the best.
---
ONE PUNCH!!!!!
---
Dude I honestly don’t know what whispers does but my friend was like “put it on it’s good”
---
&gt;The emblems, however, are not tied to the bloodpoints score. 
---
Um....yes they are. Now the Gamekeeper is the only outlier but your other three emblems are directly correlated to your BP scoring. 
---
Hit Events tie to Malicious, Chaser and Brutality. 
---
Hook events tie to Devout and partially Chaser as well. 
---
All of your deviousness score is cause by your power’s usage and interaction with the survivors in most cases (Billy Spirit And Legion are outliers here) 
---
Gatekeeper has always been a weird emblem because in most situations, you’re gonna lose gens due to the nature of the chase and the only way to “save” it is getting a 4K before endgame.
---
Even if the Survivor gets there first (something that almost never happens lately it seems) the killer can still close it WHILE they are jumping in, forcing them out.
---
The Hatch is nothing now, and I always head for a door once the 3rd guy dies, unless of course, i've found the Hatch on the other side of the map from him/her
---
Can someone tag the community manager and ask them to either give all players some points or give us a 2 times bloodpoint event to make up for it.
---
i don't think anything is toxic on them anymore. there is a Spirit Fury+Enduring or Thanatophobia+Sloppy Butcher meta however.
---
I'm laughing way too hard at this.  I bought Susie even with not much intentions of playing Legion just cause she seemed to be really awesome.
---
When whispers is lit up it means there is a survivor wishing a certain range. That range becomes smaller as you level the perk so you can be more accurate. If it isn’t lit up, there’s nobody anywhere near you.
---
i got the 4k lmao
---
Ah! Thank you
---
Question, can MoM be "Re-activated" after you go into Dying State or heal or whatever if you keep getting hit, healing, getting hit again, etc.?
---
Like is it possible to get tokens on it after it procs, you heal, go into Dying State (Which "deactivates" the perk according to the description?) and get another Mettle Of Man proc? I know in a typical match you won't be getting hit and healing that often without being hooked to death, but I'm just curious.
---
nice
---
They literally didn't attack you. They pointed out exactly what you did in response to exactly what they did. You are sealioning now, please stop.
---
Has someone the source to the video of the picture
---
If updated drivers don't work. I'd keep an eye on your thermals and make sure your card or cpu isn't getting too hot and throttling. You can use msi afterburner and look at all the temp and usage info. (And set a custom fan curve) if you need it.
---
Plague could use some quality of life changes I’m with ya brother
---
It does make sense because if the killer is getting off on the fear and becoming more powerful when you're frightened; that would disappear join your death as you are no longer experiencing the emotion when dead.
---
I'd say they'd also be fearful even before they get injured considering who's chasing them but that's another story.
---
Seriously sometimes I just want to play killer. Rank reset needs to start happening every two weeks.
---
Now understand this is last time i used the build, i have no idea if BHVR came in and changed shit since then.
---
i've had this so many times playing both sides.
---
perfectly good killer who only camped when gates were opened gets flamed in chat.
---
perfectly good killer who never tunneled or camped but didn't manage to kill anyone gets t-bag and ez baby killer.
---
newly born baby killer who doesn't know how to use power gets looped and bullied to establish survivor dominance.
---
as survivor i always stand up for killers when survivors are being cunts.
---
Map looks like Groaning Storehouse, as Leatherface i’d AFK too. Survivors have magnets to the broken window.

no, you can buy other characters perks from the shrine thing and it appears in other characters blood web, it might be a case of them just getting lucky and the perks they want appearing there, but idk, could also be rank reset and they just havent played in a while
---
His terror radius goes away when he activates his power and it’s gone for the whole time it’s active. The only caveat is that if a survivor sights him when he’s stealthed his power deactivates immediately.
---
Like, the fuck tho. This shit is broken, like NOED and MOM.
---
Just imagine if it's also saying "Entity Displeased" on his screen and he's equally confused
---
Explain? How is them staying longer, after he’s clearly given up,  not the asshole action. He’s quite literally playing KILLER...
---
He is from The Strangers.
---
survivors don't even need perks or items to escape yet they use perks and items. what is your point here?
---
I don't understand where morals and perk choice intersect. Just equip whatever you like playing and what gets you W's.
---
Top is my teammates doing totems when I’m survivor and the bottom is when I’m killer.
---
To be salty. I made one for survivors too!
---
Isn’t this from the old PTB for spirit - those square things
---
Somehow BHVR creates a new bug we haven’t seen, more embarrassing than the last

Always run this with Huntress it’s very fun &amp; bs. Only thing that can save them from being seen is being close so you know that there’s probably people around you add that with whispers and you’re set. Unless they have distortion even tho it’ll be gone pretty quick
---
Why are you telling people how to play? If someone wants to use NoEd let them.
---
Don't listen to them UwU
---
Bruh this is just salt.
---
lmao painfully true
---
I also made one for survivors!
---
Dr. Decker from nightbreed would make a good killer too.
---
Reposts are fun
---
STBFL because you have faster weapon wipes.
---
I feel like the only time the gates are close is when EGC activates when I close the hatch. If survivors get to the end the gates always end up being across the map.
---
Instead you get dried cherry blossom
---
By that Logic Killers shouldn't run BBQ (learn to track survivors better), NC (learn to listen out or look for blood trails), NOED (a reward for not applying pressure to then give insta downs so you can catch up). The list goes for hoth sides and @PronsYYZ is right, check out Marth for skilled gameplay based on these perk arguments
---
It stops it. You don't even have to chase them out of the exit gates anymore.  Just chill somewhere else until they leave.
---
Looked like the cancel was unintentional, either an accident or he thought she'd sprint into the locker so he went for the grab instead
---
then why the question? i don't want any answer from yoi, i want to do what you did :c for the sake of salt.
---
you need to take a break from the game when its upsetting you this much
---
id hope he has steering addons like billy then
---

---
 I started running STBFL as a means to mitigate this cause I usually get 2 MoM per game anyway so unless I’m feeling particularly Myers, I have to either keep playing Legion or just hit everyone a billion times.
---
go the 4k as the worst killer
---
To test the community. I did this to both sides, don't you see? I want to see how they react to criticism, knowing that I've gone for both sides.
---
It has been mostly bad, and now that I'm revealing it, they will most likely give me negative reactions. But idc.
---
Having lots of fun with where they're at, honestly.
---
Lullaby buff: dont show the notification until at least 1 token is active/person has been hooked. I swear it used to be like this. 
---
If it's not even active on my first skill check with notifications why should it tell me it exists?
---
Imagine if you knew about devour hope at the start of the game or after first unhook.
---
Batman DLC scarecrow as killer, BATMAN AS SURVIVOR LETS GO
---
They should just add a chance to "fall down and break your ankle" after the 2nd crouch-motion in a short time period (that increases with each subsequent crouch)..but tell none about the changes.
---
That would be an homage to almost every horror movie AND hillarious.
---
I was going to do an add-on section, but an add-on section with this level of quality would take fucking ages to make and I decided it was impractical lol. But yeah you could probably have things that effect his charging attack.
---
Yet survivors get extremely salty for being smacked on the hook or tunneled for tbagging.
---
yes, i understand. i made the comment for same reason. most of my comments are provocative to just see how people react and then savour it. but there's no point in getting an answer from you. i was waiting for white knights from both sides to give me something juicy :c
---
Well, your persistence made the experiment be terminated early. I did get some results though.
---
"Chill, it's just a secret census I'm doing, and in immediately revealing it for literally no reason other than to dodge small amounts of Reddit heat, I'm now not culpable of stirring the pot."
---
Alright.
---
Happenned to Me too, Lost a purple flashlight and deranked
---
this is so pretty what the fuck. good job
---
fOnG
---
bullshit. You will have the default benevolence emblem since the killer is going to hit and hook nobody.
---
If all 4 of you are on gens whether it be separate and ESPECIALLY simultaneously it will be impossible to get a high lightbringer across all of you, you alone have to do like 2.5 generators by yourself which isn't going to be the case if you're all cooping gens with no worry of the killer, even less likely if there are no hexes, as only hex totems count towards pipping, not dulls.
---
Evader will get you no points unless like I mentioned, you just stand by the afk killer for a few minutes. You can at BEST get 1 pip in a match like this, but that includes forcing yourself to get extra points.
---
the only possible iridescent you can guarantee is Unbroken, which along with a silver-gold lightbringer, bronze benevolence and non-existent evader isn't enough to double pip.
---
I did it, and now kinda regret it. It was just an idea, but I handled it wrong.
---
Don't worry though, I'm just gonna delete this. It was ultimately pointless anyway.
---
To be honest, me too. In fact I do like them better now with the 115% speed. I usually did not liked to use feral frenzy to put down survivors so the boost in the normal chase was really welcomed for me.
---
Altough I miss using Frank's mixtape to give a lil payback to annoying SWF, I like them where they are now, But I wish they were better, since in the end they fall short in a lot of things, even before the nerf.
---
You sadly don't even get that far into the game
---
Let me guess the last one is getting face camped.
---
Imagine a mechanic were multiple people could hide in a locker, \*scandals intensify\*
---
What was the post game chat?
---
Well, if you're dead you aren't afraid of it anymore..so..
---
why calling a less efficient thing "underrated" when there's a special term which is "inefficient" for it? 
---
&gt;underrate - underestimate the extent, value, or importance of (someone or something).
---
&gt;inefficient - not achieving maximum productivity; wasting or failing to make the best use of time or resources.
---
YIKES
---
I mean, I see Collapse more as a change for when there’s one survivor left and the hatch is open. Making survivors actually leave is nice, but it isn’t really the point.
---
That’s what I do when I give up. If I’m alt tabbed and I come back and my game is still going because somebody wants to loot, after I’ve clearly given up, I’m fucking killing them and everyone else who stayed around. Why is that an asshole thing to do? Should’ve left my game and you would’ve lived, simple enough.
---
Imagin being a huntress going for hatchets then BAM survivor jumps out of the locker stunning/scaring you. Head on have a lot of jumpscare potential.
---
What happened is as soon as I saw her trying to get to the locker i cancelled the chainsaw to get her. I didn't expect it to be already occupied haha!
---
You said you want to be a better killer. Who do you main?
---
Or are you looking to just get well rounded on all killers?
---
Survivors can be dicks and like someone else said it'll be lose lose if you are still learning or if you go try hard. I think the best thing I've done to counteract this is to not give them the satisfaction. Usually, when I get hate mail I'll tell them still learning or GG/WP. And leave it at that. They'll usually take the hint or if they do reply trying to taunt me some more I'll just reply haha. If you don't engage people don't really push it.
---
Thankfully we now have EGC to minimize the t-bagging at the exits. I'll just run at them and most people leave.
---
Sorry you're not getting any fun out of your games.
---
 That leaves 12 people working on gens oh lord
---
When Legion snaps his fingers half of the playerbase will dc
---
They should be thankfull im teabagging, my main is Jane with the white pants. 
---
Don't pretend u don't enjoy it.
---
Tbh the only thing i think legion should have is blood pools in frenzy and nurses on deepwounds mending and he'd be good and not hell to fight
---
Weee ooo weee ooo somebody called the meme police.
---
#SupportFreddyDBD
---
We won't get Pennywise if Last Year gets it
---
Wait what.
---
That makes it literally a downgrade. The thing I want to minimize is, from any random map point X, the distance from X to the closest hook. Decreasing the distance between hooks without adding more hooks would INCREASE that distance for average X.
---
This is so good, can we get a G in the chat for godly
---
Although we're still waiting for deathstare Feng skin tho
---
That games dead no way they get it .
---
Wouldn't dcs count towards a sacrifice   ritual?
---
Speaking from the side who DCs when anything doesn't go according to plan, you really should avoid tribalism.
---
Yeah exactly
---
Well good try. I was sad one time when I was doing it and a third guy playing Detective Tap jumped in to "block" a hit for me.  I was like nooooo Tap you died for nothing! Endgame collapse was seconds from taking everybody too so I had no choice but to go at that point. Sometimes not being able to communicate can be frustrating lol.
---
You literally have no idea how good Ghostface is going to be. Ghostface can only have his exposed effect on one survivor, Myers can have exposed on all survivors for a really long time, even permanent with addons. Pig is still going to be the same as she is right now, not *that* good of a killer and Ghostface won't make her worse or better. She still has her traps and crouching+Charge attack.
---
if ghostface doesnt get overpowered add ons myers can still be a good pick, and the pig still has bear traps making her different from ghostface
---
Nothing lol. Ghostfaces exposed status he puts on you lasts 5 seconds if the survivors see you coming. Also even while ghost is crouching he still has a red stain. People will prob still prefer myers but as for pig ghostface is more powerful
---
slim
---
I think every time I've played huntress the dude gets the MoM proc and just runs straight and deepthroats one of my hatchets seconds later
---
ah, cause you can't wake up? i understand. i was 6 when first time watched Nightmare on Elm Street, by this very day i think i'm asleep and it's some weird long ass game Fred is playing with me.
---
If we're getting goosebumps monster's, I choose slappy.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
He's only weaker if you moonwalked or used franks/cold dirt
---
Down by Daylight.
---
pffft, who uses add ons. (please dont kill me, im just a terrible hoarder)
---
Freddy is underrated. He can do a lot in practiced hands.
---
Feng want Snu Snu.
---
They always screw up something, every patch
---
How'd you get the lil thing next to your name that says We're Gonna Live Forever.
---
Survivor or killer? Feels like its impossible to rank up as killer anymore.
---
And then survivors complain when you get tired of their bullshit and run equally unfun shit like ruin mori ranged nurse.
---
Had a swf teabag and bm when I was letting them live and playing a troll build with bps. Got them again next game and did my nurse revenge. All 4 disconnected.
---
It's pretty sad.
---
*full stack of devoured hope enters the game*
---
That's because it's no use hitting one survivor in Frenzy twice, Linda! He's faster now and their power is no longer exploitable.
---
The should have just fixed hatch standoff with killer and survivor 2 out of 3 rock, paper, scissors...loser commits suicide.
---
I believe pig and Myers are unique enough to not be  completely replaced by ghostface. Ghostface probably won't even beat Myers in a tierlist considering the stalk and one shot time. Plus pig has traps and a long dash outmatching Ghostfaces crouch from what I've seen so yeah screamy boi won't replace Myers and pig.
---
Ranks absolutely don't matter. Do not focus on pips. Don't focus on emblems. They are totally worthless and indicative of nothing. Stop feeding into the bullshit ranking system that is bare bones and won't be built upon until probably 2021 with the rate at which we got servers.
---
Try to escape, and try to kill people. Don't let the game dictate what metric you have to shoehorn into your playstyle to "win".
---
If the human race is wiped out, and life as we know it ceases to exist, did you really lose?
---
Fire up. I like having the survivors complete there objective with consequences
---
Knockout
---
On PS4 more killers hold the game hostage. I actually thought this was because of killers.
---
Camping is just being on the map... everyone knows that
---
oh wow, okay now i know, thank you OP!
---
Feng looks pretty much the same.
---
What did you expect, to tunnel the fuck out of him instead of punishing you for farming him?
---
Jesus Christ.
---
And why would I be wrong?
---
My biggest gripe with the game is i don't have 1000 hours to spend getting every perk on every killer and survivor.
---
He got buffed lol
---

Because you get mad at someone spamming a button in a fucking video game, grow up seriously.

No you just have to be good at DBD now when playing it
---
how do you grief in dbd? did they destroy ur dirt house?
---
He was running up to generators I was on and blowing them up, then he would drop all pallets in the area and start fast vaulting them. As soon as a heartbeat began he would urban evade away. Killer slugged me at one point and the guy came up to me and started tea bagging on me and then ran away. At one point he was just spinning around in the basement. When he got downed he dc'd and stuck around to make fun of us in end game chat.
---
Bamboozle, BBQ, Enduring and 3rd Seal/Spirit Fury is my current build
---
It should be a middle finger to be honest. 
---
What's a bigger middle finger to an evil slasher movie villain than not dying?
---
So what you are saying is you should not get angered when people disrespect you, mock you and bully you just because you are playing a video game. You are arguing about the action while I am arguing about the intentions behind that action and that's what people are talking about here
---
Drop Nurse's for BBQ and STBFL for Enduring.
---
and, you know, my aunt, who literally is a billionaire for like 20 years can't cure her migraines either. cause sometimes females have unidentified migraines that can't be cured and don't let painkillers do their job.
---
I don't think anyone would complain about blood warden... I mean noed sure but blood warden?
---
Yeah :/
---
Ghostface gameplay footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WFlMkkpBOo
---
Shut up lol.
---
I literally never said anything like that. Just because I say I don't like one thing doesn't mean I don't think the equivalent is okay or not an issue. I wasn't even talking about survivors until you brought them up, but okay.
---
i have migraines for 12 years. my aunt has them for over 20. she is, as i said, literally a billionaire, she also tried everything money can provide from Chinese traditional medicine to Israeli latest inventions. and so did i with her cause we have same type. and nothing helps. i left for monastery in north India when i was 16 because of these pains. and you here dare to say someone needs to be patient. fuck you. really. good samaritans like you are disgusting.

TOP 10 MINDBLOWING FACTS🤯
---
Wraith actually get points for stalking too xd
---
I'd say switch stbfl. It's really good but sometimes you'll hit a survivor and they'll stun you with a pallet as you do so, or you'll have to hit the obsession and chase them. Nurse's calling is really good and works especially well with Myers because of his small terror radius.
---
Pro tip:don't run m&amp;a and dead rabbit at the same time. They don't Stack together so use only 1 of them
---
Yeah I mean I get it. Some people have health issues that never go away and it causes suffering. You just enjoy what moments you can. If nothing makes it better keep trying anyways. Dont give up on that. That's what I do.
---
No I don't want to wait 3 hours to get into a match sorry

"Oh no, Dwight got hit by the Nurse, seems like she doesn't want to heal him, this Killer is dangerous!"
---
"Oh shit, Dwight is on the ground, I'm actually scarred."

"Oh fuck, Dwight is on the hook, the entity is about to claim him, please don't take me entity!!!"

---
Why play Legion in the first place?

I do. I have stomach problems and it's a bad pain once it's going. I'll basically be good for weeks at a time and then I'm suddenly not. It kind of dictates my life sometimes but I'm just working around it the best I can.

sorry to hear that, mate, that really sucks. when i get certain stomach problems i get even moodier than i am with migraines
---
If you look closely you'll see the Wraith is standing next to the first tree.
---
really? -karma a joke? okay D:
---
You obviously don't play killer if you think you have a chance of "hunting" survivors who are just standing at the exit gate.
---
Yikes, this guy's serious.
---
Had the same Freddy today. Lagswitched just as I dropped a pallet. It should have been way ahead of him but apparently Freddy can now lunge under pallets and end up on the far side
---
Did you report that bug in the forums yet? I haven't seen it there and they might not even know about it.
---
Toxicity will always remain. But to not address it and say that it's no big deal is just not right. If you are having fun at the expense of someone else's time and unhappiness, that's wrong. Don't give me that bullshit there you say that the losing side is always going to be unhappy. Victory and defeat doesn't necessarily equate to enjoyment. There are many games where the 3 survivors escaped but the game was really fun for me and there are times when survivors get 4K-ed but still enjoy the game
---
Not in DBD but it has in other games, Civ for example has the infamous ghandi meme, that's because of this underflow glitch. He takes an action that lowers his aggressiveness but because he's ghandi it's already at 1 so the action glitches the game and sets his aggressiveness to max
---
Yeah it can make me moody too but I'm getting better with minimizing issues but it's been a bother for about 7 years and it just got managble last year so I'm happy about it being a periodic thing now. So I'm okay.
---
That feeling when you're stupid and actually look for 50000 years
---
if someone doesn't understand definitions you gotta give them example  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  i ain't fukin around with logic.
---
Don't learn from me because a lot of reddit people want to push me down and call me average or a bit above average. But at the end of the day, most killers are as good as each other after a certain skill cap and any of these "tiles tutorials" only take you so far and only work against the basic survivors, not the best. But you will learn as much from me as you would any other good killer, its just cool to belittle me on reddit from some people. Lot of fake narratives and lies, come to my stream and you see how much they lie.
---
did you figure out the diet and stabilized it?
---
Toxics will toxic. Sore losers and sore winners.
---
It's a lot of work, but I'd be down. I select legion whenever I log off just so I get the metal theme when I get back on in the morning.
---
Yeah, but he agreed to disagree. You can just leave it at that.
---
Actually it's not stolen, it was my friend's screenshot and he sent it to me over discord, unbeknownst to me he had already uploaded it so
---
Third Seal. Survs can't save unless they spend time not doing gens &amp; looking for the hooked/downed surv, they cant use OoO(specifically swf users of it) &amp; mmm... that feeling when you see 4 stacks on it.... mmmmmm

"Immunity to corn"
---
oh, yeah, there's always someone feeling worse D: and it doesn't make you happy cause you feel for them and also can't whine normally cause you know they're feeling worse(T_T like i'm on this subreddit for migraine and some girls, women and even men sometimes have a whole fukin month of migraine strike!!! it's insane. i never had a strike that lasted over a week. i actually feel bad i whine so much when i see their posts.
---
Wraith is not top tier just seems people really like him.
---
I wish I found out about this before I spend the whole weekend being a gen jockey
---
Either as exhauation perk or maybe don't give them the speedboost after the MoM hit or apply deep wounds and it shoukd be fine
---
All probably
---
It depends on what perks you decide to run, I would say its least effective on Freddy
---
Allan please upvote post
---
Endgame was designed to stop survivors holding the game hostage, it will never stop BM. If you don't want the survivors to BM you at the exit gate, don't let them get to the exit gate.
---
It will tend to increase the number of hooks, depends on how map gen is feeling.
---
https://youtu.be/fv340yni8Xg
---
Dev stream explaining how it works
---
yeah, cause when you hit first guy, locating immersing in corn survivors is easy peasy with the sound and red lights. no other killer apart from Doctor with madness(can be countered by Calm Spirit) or Freddy with Class Photo can get this effect.
---
4k with 5 gens left as Legion?? Not too shabby!!!
---
B.S barely reduces the action time though.
---
 You could argue, but all you gotta do is look at the numbers. It's not even something like 0.70 milliseconds! Yes, MILLISECONDS. It's so ridiculously weak it's debatable why that perk even exists.
---
Since when could you play as a key? Huh, guess i missed that update
---
They aren't useless at all. I win almost every mind game when I use those two add-ons. Here's a video that shows the passive phasing with and w/o add-ons. \~ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-HLfNwIg4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-HLfNwIg4Q)
---
But you just said "Stop getting pissed off and whine like a little girl and just ignore it, its not a big deal"
---
Depends on the rank. Wraith is extremely popular at lower ranks. Probably because new players think he looks cool and because of the cloaking power. You'll only see a few Wraiths at higher ranks.
---
Have you played killer vs red, even green and purple rank survivors? Survivors don’t even have to try hard to escape, they just have to be smart. If you’re not in Nurse, Spirit, or Hillbilly you can do everything perfectly and still not win. Laugh all you want, any player who’s had enough time on both sides will tell you the same.
---
&gt; You'll only see a few Wraiths at higher ranks.
---
This must be my problem...I'm a scrub of the highest order, no joke.
---
No
---
Killer literally caught her looting, how is that not a mistake on the Claudette? You’re telling me you’d loot right in front of a Leatherface? I’d love to see one of your games lmao
---
Yeah. Then it's "gg ez baby killer"

As a friendly killer myself I'd say you're wrong

Because you said ruin ... what happens if both killers equip ruin? does the effect double? are two totems lit?

can confirm, if t-bagging on the other side of a pallet actually cost me something in gameplay I wouldn't do it
---
It's only powerful if the survivors are stupid enough to actually let the timer run down that much.
---
LMFAO he immediately downed and hooked someone in the basement and I went for the save because he was camping it. Meg got out with BT but I did not
---
okay, so, fully remove dbd from your pc, use ccleaner. then download and install it again. with all the tiny updates and big updates they tend to mess up lots of little coding lines so you gotta do a fresh start every once in a while.
---
Yeah I reported. In pre-game lobby right as the countdown hit 5 and locked us in he said he wasn't going to do anything to help us in the match
---
lol what a cunt.
---
Ah i see. I've just noticed also the perk at the bottom triggered (small game or something?), how come that activated?
---
Tbh I think the same. Or make it so they cant close it. I was in a match with a Fragrant Tuft Myers on Swamp, hatch spawned at the exit Gate, he immediately closed it and camped the doors while endgame collapse was activated. Guaranteed loss so I just threw myself at Him and he said "gG eZ NobZ"
---
Yeah Ik but it is seriously a grind and luck of the dice to get what you want which is so infuriating sometimes like I just want BBQ for more blood points but instead I get monstrous shrine.really wish we had a ticket of some sorts that people could use to upgrade their perks or force them in a blood web that had limited uses before having to wait  every new chapter to do it again to balance it.
---
So uh... A-as a rank 20s killer who just bought the game and the doctor, how should I react when this happens?  
---
You know ... just in case it happens.
---
This also affects the daily that wants you to repair three generators.
---
If possible, I’d rather choose Brenda over Sidney since I’d love more cocky survivor than brave and smart one.
---
Small game activates when there's a totem (hex or dull) , a trapper trap or hag trap are in front of you (I think range is like 2 lying Dwight's in length and 45 degree cone) .
---
I find matches to be harder without Small Game . Lots of killers use Ruin, and NOED and I try to cleanse all 5 totems before the last generator is finished.  It's satisfying to see a bamboozled killer hitting you and expecting you to go down after the last gen is done , but their NOED has not activated.
---
this is the way to use MoM B| It's like the old BT, apart from insta down from healthy dosen't put you in bt state.
---
This is the story of a woman named Claudette.
---
Claudette survived in the realm of the entity where she was survivor #427.
---
Survivor #427's job was simple: she sat at a generator and pushed a button.
---
Skillchecks came in telling her when to press the button.
---
This is what survivor #427 did every day of every month of every year, and altough others might have concidered it soul rending.
---
Claudette relished every moment the skillchecks came in, as tough she had been made exactly for this job.
---
And Claudette was happy.
---
And then one day, something very peculiar happened.
---
Something that would forever change Claudette;
---
Something she would never quite forget.
---
She had been roaming the realm for an hour when she realised there was not a single generator left to repair.
---
No other survivors had shown up to give her instructions. Never in all her years surviving in the realm of the entity had this happened, so she decided to look for clues on what to do.
---
She found the killer, but something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, the killer didn't move for the longest time.
---
But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he walked up to Claudette and revved his chainsaw...
---
Thicc thighs save lives but thigh highs will be my demise.
---
You can still escape, but end of the day you lost if you didnt power the gens
---
Im really surpised at all these people who consider hatch a win before
---
I main nurse and this hasen't really been true from my point of view, I've had way mor DC as doc.
---
All your posts are patronising as hell and were completely dismissive of the OP posting a fun idea, then you call me a smarmy prick.  
---
You seriously need to read your own posts, look at your own behaviour and verbiage before name calling others.
---
Nurse got fixed. However she is one of the best killers against it because she doesn't suffer from one extra hit that much and she benefits greatly from seeing your aura if you decide to heal after MoM.
---
Even with no terror radius it is still the worst out of 4 perks on your build.
---
Monto complained about this exact same thing if I recall correctly
---
I used to be too scared to play killer in case I wasn't good enough and gave survivors a bad game. I recently got sick of worrying about others so much, turned off my messages (ps4) and just went for it. Everyone has to learn and nobody is brilliant straight away. I'm a lot better now I mostly play trapper, but I'm starting to play other killers and yes, I'm total shit when I start with them. It's ridiculous for these die hard players to expect everyone to be great. That's why the ranking system exists.
---
And then you open the menu and hover over the Leave Game button.
---
Hell yeah, I’ve been getting jack shit every game now
---
Thank you so much my dude
---
Yeah I felt kinda bad for him I was still leveling her and Franklins was one of the only good perks I had
---
I'm calling you a smarmy prick, because you're acting like a smarmy prick. Simple as that. Going "Woah a SWF can say where the killer is" is being intentionally ignorant to prove a point.
---
Ah, so you've gone through approx. 10 of the comments in my history, and decided that I'm patronising based on them? Bit ridiculous, that. Especially considering that they aren't even that patronising.
---
It's hardly dismissive to point out the obvious, which is that the idea wouldn't work.
---
Yeah obviously, i meant that i wouldnt say that losing means you dont enjoy the game. Dont know where that came from but that literally has nothing to do with the argument.
---
You won't really be needing Ruin. That's a good swap
---
Killers often body block or leave survivors on the ground in order to draw it out. Also not all survivor mains are he’s.
---
I just don't miss it, so many 20 minute hatch standoffs "just let them go stupid toxic killer GG" that's not how the force works.
---
My buddy said that was happening to him
---
Wow that’s amazing, I love hows she’s flying around hahahaha
---
All three of the strangers would be cool, imo.
---
theres two totems lit up,don't know about double effect though
---
Iron will to shut his ass up, Jeff is so loud when he’s injured.
---
Maybe only placeholders, but maybe they will use it for the next chapter of the game that comes in 1 and a half moths.
---
True he is a bit of a loud lad but I love him. I see myself in Jeff so I main him :)
---
But opening chest gains you nothing. Usually just run around the killer before finishing gens to get escape points
---
What are you talking about hes there just cloaked
---
This community is mega toxic we don’t smile here.
---
Yeah cause tbh imo legion is better and more fun to play than the old one.
---
It's not just rank 20s. I sometimes hear the "found survivor" sound and then a chase starts and I'm like "what? where? how? where the fuck is he?"
---
I can relate this community is certainly unique lol
---
I agree I would change it to 3 hits but the hits would only count if you escaped chase 3 times after getting hit so it would require a little bit of skill
---
Well, teasers would have gotten hundreds of thousands if not millions of views, as well, like they always do, and also lead to people talking and speculating a lot, and so I wouldn't say they necessarily need this type of marketing strategy to hype up their content. I did initially assume that it was an intentional leak, but for another reason: with most things pointing to the likely scenario that this will not be an actual "Scream" Chapter, but rather an original, Scream-based killer design using the Ghostface mask license, it seems to me this "sneak preview" does a lot to dampen the impact of what that would otherwise entail. Imagine they were to release teasers showing the mask, only to later reveal it's not actually the Scream license. With the leaks, the hype that is being built for the content already comes with the idea that this might not be officially set in the Scream franchise, given the lack of much of any franchise-relatedness in it; the hype a "Ghostface" teaser could create on the other hand would obviously build Scream anticipations, to which the ultimate reveal that it's basically a knock-off design would constitute a bigger disappointment among fans.
---
That said, leaking a dev build with all kinds of different things on it seems odd to have been intentional (even if accidentally shipping it also seems odd, to say the least). With the cosmetics that have been extracted from it, as well as the 3rd year anniversary event stuff, it just does not seem worthwhile a decision if it was indeed meant to "dampen the shock of Ghostface being an original design", especially given that the revealed cosmetics are licensed, which not only takes away the grand reveal of BHVR finally having secured licensed cosmetics, but could also possibly not sit well with the license holders.
---
Hey, I'm a bit new. Can u explain what this and how does this glitch happen? I have been playing for like 3 weeks and never encountered 2 killers. I did encounter a lot of AFK killers but never this.
---
BBQ and Chili - I run this on all killers, getting half points feels bad.
---
Sloppy Butcher - This is key. You injure people easily and quickly if you can chain, Sloppy will maximize the time you gain from injuries, and dissuade people from healing.
---
Monitor and Abuse - Since your power only injures, you want to be taking injured survivors by surprise to down them. M&amp;A will give them less warning so you can catch them before they get somewhere safe. It also makes your detection with Killer Instinct longer, good for map awareness, bad for judging when to chain, but the pros outway the cons.
---
Bonus perk of your choice from:
---
Discordance - Map awareness and good for faster start. Tells you where to go for a better chance at a chain.
---
Stridor - Better tracking of injured survivors. Since they'll be injured most of the game, you'll be able to hear them from a massive distance, which means easy surprise downs.
---
Thanataphobia - Make healing harder and slow the game a little extra, but this may encourage them to heal more, which is a good and bad thing.
---
**Playstyle**
---
Prioritize injuring over downing whenever you can't down easily. Injuries are easy for you and they buy bonus time from deep wounds, so 10 seconds to injure someone and leave them is often better than 30 seconds to down someone. You want to injure everyone and force the game to a crawl, then start picking them off while they struggle to heal, while constantly re-wounding and applying pressure. Commit to chases only when you know you have the upper hand in either the loop location, or the map control. (Or when you need the last bbq stack). Remember that there's always someone else who'll be in a much less safe part of the map. If someone never leaves the safest area, they can be the last survivor and then they'll have to move.
---
I am aware of that and it doesn't make it okay. It's still absolutely horrible.
---
If I got a 3vs1 as killer I just left anyway, it’s a dead match.
---
someone uses bitter murmur?
---
Imo it's a paragraph and we won't have a survivor at all.
---
It would seem more deranged and psychopathic to have a cutesy, girly killer racing after you with a knife to stab you in the back. I think we threw out which cosmetics “belong in the game” when we got all the bright ass 90s survivor outfits.
---
It's more so that bugs never change. They're unpredictable little shits.  
---
It's not like BHVR purposely implemented this just to poke the bear.
---
Imagine if end game wasn’t a thing, this game would never end.
---
Yeah. "Leaks Ghostface" "We did it on purpose"
---
I feel you, however 
---
&gt;I just want to get better at the game.
---
If this is what you want, I recommend throwing out NOED.
---
I have read enough to know you don't like using it yourself, don't worry. But just wanted to throw it out there that you'll get better more quickly without NOED
---
Also, if you want to get better at survivor more quickly, might I recomend No Mither?
---
Thanks! :)
---
I think that will stop when ppl see the entity killing animation once or twice. But idk its ussually just two mins so i dont mind.
---
Spine chill has helped me dodge the killer more then a couple of times
---
Exactly like that.
---
Imo, legion is fine and fun to play as how he is now.
---
Prefect answer thank you! I had forgotten it detects totems, although i thought there are 6 in a match but just double checked with Google and it is 5, TIL!
---
&gt;as survivor i always stand up for killers when survivors are being cunts.
---
Same
---
I also stand up for survivors who get flamed by their teammates when I play killer
---
I KNEW it hahahaha, I actually love that mfcking hole in the ground so much ;)
---
I used it once or twice while leveling a new killer. Other than that it’s pretty worthless
---
A Survivor's goal is to escape...
---
Jumping through the hatch is escaping...
---
As others have pointed out, the Whispers + Monitor &amp; Abuse combination is just as viable as it used to be; survivors should not hear heartbeat at any point if you crouch as soon as Whispers procs, especially since base time to crouch has been reduced.
---
If you consider playing sneaky/gen-grab Pig fun, then there's actually two new (or quasi-new) perks that help you do so: new-Surveillance and Discordance let you know which generators survivors are sitting on, allowing you to sneak up and try to grab them.
---
What I think is more fun is using ambush mechanics in chases. The gist of it is that you crouch at pallet loops and then dash around them to try and get hits. If the pallet is not dropped you'd ideally want to do this from the pallet side of the loop. This can also be used on some window tiles, a good example being the cranes on Autohaven maps. And there's some nuance to it, such as faking the direction of the dash first, or faking the dash altogether, immediately uncrouching or making the "dash roar" and then uncrouching, trying to get the survivor to run from the tile expecting a dash and thereby potentially getting a free hit by uncrouching and following them. Enduring and Spirit Fury are the perks to use, then. Save The Best For Last and Unrelenting unfortunately do not affect ambush hits, last I checked.
---
End Game has definitely increased slugging. 
---
And that was always worse than t-bagging. 
---
A fair fix would be take away an End Game kill counting as the killers kill.
---
A killer main complaining about survivors hmmmmm......
---
If you want to get better at killer in general, you should stay away from Nurse. She plays totaly different and the skills you get with her don't help you with other killers
---
Also controversial opinion: Nurse is the easiest killer to learn how to play
---
I never really gave it too much thought before but gotta be real fucking hard to see through that penny sized eye hole
---
Oh so that's what they do! I thought the passive phasing was in relation to when you used her power.
---
This happened to me yesterday. I actually got out of it by healing a friend
---
While I find this greatly enjoyable, could you please mark this nsfw? I don't personally care but I know someone will. Great post though
---
probably cause they have a flashlight
---
Underrated reference
---
With the risk of making internet strangers downvoting my opinion. If a survivor is being toxic and t-bagging at every palet. I will tunnel and make sure they die. I also would let the survivors who tried to rescue them have a fighting chance by letting them Heal up to full and do another gen as compensation. Why? Because why should i have to deal with it? Plus its better than just dcing to not deal with toxic. And its usually just one asshole.
---
The game is about as stable as a schizophrenic on cocaine, that's why.
---
Freddy is only decent with addons. He is still the weakest killer In the game.
---
After 500 hours of gameplay I can say that at the end it doesn't matter if you escaped or died, the important is that you had fun using the perks you like and not using always the same perks otherwise it gets boring
---
Ok, why?
---
LOL hahaha the thing, the blinding literally hurts my eyes so yeah I get triggered. It's like showing a red blanket to a bull.
---
I will tunnel if you keep appearing out of nowhere trying to blind me, then it is getting annoying, or do it after a  pallet, then it is on
---
Unlucky.
---
DBD community is a lot better than League or Dota tbh
---
Just never down them 4Head
---
Please continue
---
Wraith is mid tier, but far away from top tier.
---
A video of it (softcore), literally just blew up on this forum like two days ago with blood warden
---
I mean if you just hide and get hatch I dunno why people feel they did well
---
It says deleted for me but I do strongly believe there needs to be some other way to slow down the game. From a killer and survivor main pov.
---
How About Altruistic AF
---
Do what you want to do :)
---
"So you're the punk my daughter can't stop talking about? Get in and grab a seat, we're gonna speak man-to-man."
---
Yea I didn't know so I thought the ritual was bugged and after like 10 gens i trashed it
---
Well R.I.P
---
Yes
---
Why not
---
So I absolutely should camp the hatch when it's down to 2v1, otherwise I'll have no chance to escape? Cool.
---
*reports*
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
---
Well, this game is all about time. As you see, it was 1 gen left and 3 survivors up. It would be more difficult to catch Nea than a Meg in a locker, so the more rewarding thing was hook up Meg and then continue the chase with Nea.
---
Who’s on the top right?
---
New funky killer !
---
Lmao what
---
Ohhhhh ok this makes me feel better
---
You are the egoistic survivor we don't need.
---
Yeah but like, just announce it
---
"Walk by faith not by sight" makes me think of the old moonwalking legion.
---
Shes cutting the corners so wide it hurts. Forget not being able to hit hatchets and swinging at nothing thats costing her so many loops
---
I dont mind kiddo, i dont owe you a essay of all the things wrong with your "suggestion".
---
Fong Men
---
You do realize DCing is a bannable offense now right? This is why people hate this game now because people like you f**k it up for others
---
CANT WAKE UP
---
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
---
Yeah I know she wasn't good at all...
---
Yep. That loop takes max 3 loops to catch a survivor at.
---
Flashlighting at pallets isn't BM. It is, however, stupid af
---
Agreed. I have had so many killers just slug or close the hatch then just pick you up and drop you over and over. Letting you do the door for a few seconds then just repeating but not letting you get the door. I just dc so they dont get to see the kill. That's 3 mins that I dont need to sit through.
---
It turned from helping killers on that random occasion that someone is hiding to all of the killers being dicks. End of the game is garbage now if you're the only one who survived.
---
I was the altruistic one. DC was my friend
---
Free health boost. That's why I said kinda. It rewards you for getting shit done, but is also a second hit, another chance.
---
Yeah she had to open, hide, open hide, etc. she failed to.
---
But entity mori good...
---
🔄 that’s better
---
I've been in soo many games where some chick with a flashlight will run around the entire map and flashlight me when I'm forced to break pallets to get them. They just love trolling killers so bad.
---
It could be Like legion where you can change comsmetics to change the character
---
Concept: let the new changes settle before requesting change
---
How? When are you else supposed to use flashlights? When a killer stares at a wall when picking up a survivor?
---
Or you know, don't tunnel/slug/gen patrol/Mori.
---
But you right. Hey, why don't we just get rid of perks entirely for Survivors? 
---
Better yet, why don't we double killer speeds, and make them down people in 1 hit!
---
why is it sideways.
---
what the hell??
---
Is this a joke ?
---
Mine says, “don’t you just love it when survivors harass you for not following their made up rules”
---
I believe you need to have the gates powered and endgame shouldn't be in progress. Try that if you haven't already.
---
Ah thanks
---
You can only open them if end game hasn’t started yet, and the gems are complete.
---
For my magnum dong!
---
That’s already how it works. If a killer drops you your wiggle meter progresses like 30%
---
Most of whenever I played Legion before the update, I had already been utilizing the tactics that new-Legion now requires you to - namely, using Frenzy to injure as many survivors as possible, stalling for some time that way forcing them to have to mend (and even better if they decide to heal), and more importantly, doing half a chase's work for you. The other half then is vanilla chase, apart from using Frenzy to close gaps if a survivor has managed to get a big enough distance on you, as well as using it to try and cut survivors off, bodyblocking pallets, windows and pathways.
---
With the increased base movement speed, this way of playing Legion has only improved, given that getting Frenzy-stabs on survivors is still more-or-less guaranteed (albeit with some more room for counterplay). There are however things I'm not a fan of that came with the rework:
---
* increased post-Frenzy fatigue time - the only utility Frenzy now has in chases on survivors that are already afflicted with Deep Wound (or already injured, for that matter) is to use it to close distances or cut survivors off - yet with the 4-second fatigue time, this has turned into too inconsistent a tool: survivors will reguarly make enough distance on you in those 4 seconds that it will barely have mattered, collision in post-Frenzy fatigue seems kind of iffy, making it less reliable to block, and with the "new" - i. e. now-also-applying-to-low-quality-settings - fatigue vision impairment, you even run the risk of losing the survivor altogether. Compare this to Wraith, who not only has just 3 seconds of a slowdown during uncloaking, but also gets the post-uncloaking speed boost, as well as obviously being able to sneak up on survivors. Hell, compare it to Nurse, who also has a shorter fatigue time and better in-fatigue vision. Legion's fatigue time should be reduced to 3 seconds again.
---
* slower vault speeds - this just makes playing Legion feel more clunky and less fun, and I don't see why this change was whatsoever necessary. Depleting some extra Frenzy on vaults would be a better alternative, if forcing Legion to vault is meant to be made a sort of Frenzy counterplay with this change.
---
* not being able to use Frenzy before the meter is full - I understand why this was changed, but it does make Legion play more awkward and less rewarding. If you are chasing a survivor with your bar drained, you are left with the decision whether you want to actually hit them or wait for your meter to be full again, because at that point not only will you also most likely guarantee a hit, but you get a notification on other survivors' positions, with the ability to also go and stab them, and you put them into the Deep Wound state, meaning that they will have to mend, as well as that they do not get a stack for Mettle Of Man, or that if they already have MOM active, it won't proc if they are in Deep Wound... and so what this leads to is you having to stupidly stall even though you could have already hit the survivor, just waiting for your Frenzy to charge back up again.
---
* ending and depleting Frenzy on missed attacks - this just makes Frenzy feel fragile, and punishing in a way that is disproportionate to the utility of the ability. While you can usually make sure that you connect the hit, there are situations where being able to have some room for play would improve the interactiveness of Frenzy gameplay, and other situations where hit detection already screwed you, then being screwed twice. Rather than ending and depleting Frenzy entirely, there should just be a cooldown and slowdown on the Frenzy slashes similar to regular missed attacks, and possibly some extra Frenzy bar depletion.
---
* the add-ons - many of the add-ons are borderline useless now. The add-on reworks are rather uninspired, and some of them basically lack a real purpose, some others a real gameplay impact. Applying Mangled or Broken  status effects with Frenzy is underwhelming, given that not healing against Legion is already something better players will regularly do. Stab Wounds Study and Frank's Mixtape lack purpose with the new Deep Wound functioning. Increasing the detection range of Frenzy's instinct, rather than increasing movement speed, is pretty useless - you will already never catch a survivor at the edge of your current 32m detection range anyway, if they run early enough, so at best what it does is tell you someone is in that direction, while at worst leading you on a wild goose chase away from the survivors you actually did injure with Frenzy, wasting a lot of time.
---
Had someone try to do this, then they died due to the end game.  #Karma
---
Your not meant to run away and survive, your meant to stand still and let her catch you.
---
I really like this.
---
Killers have has 2 and a half years of BM at gates, they are just returning the favour. 
---
But in all seriousness most people just want to see the entity kill.
---
I think Ghost Face can be better than Myers, but it all depends. Myers has a garbage start because of Evil Within 1 and he can be easily gen rushed untill he reach in Evil Within 3, while Ghost Face doesn't have this weaknesses. Also, Ghost Face stalk is much faster than Myers stalk and he has more potential than Myers to gen grab. I hope just that he won't give a audio clue when he enters in stealth, because that would ruin him. Also, 15 seconds of expose status effect might not be enough against good survivors, but thesee things might be changed when he comes out.
---
El buen gramo pre-matanza.
---
it isn't
---
I sincerely hope that this is a joke
---
fake af everything is in the shop already
---
I'm intrigued but this can't be real right? I personally wouldn't mind a premium pass it just seems very odd for the devs to add one at such a time where the game is fucked for everyone.
---
Oof 😂
---
The majority in here said they didn't want any Battle Pass BS in the game but, as always, they just listen to themselves.
---
Bloodwarden before the Endgame release:
---
Me: Sleep
---
Bloodwarden after the Endgame release:
---
Me: REAL SHIT!
---
Exactly!
---
STBFL has no real purpose on Legion. The primary and only reliable utility of STBFL is making chases on healthy survivors potentially last less long, because after hitting them the first time, you can go back to chasing more quickly, due to the reduced time spent in post-hit cooldown/slowdown. But against Legion, survivors should not often be healthy to begin with, and if they are, you want to use Frenzy to injure them.
---
About the "coming out of Frenzy" part - what exactly do you mean with that? STBFL reduces the post-Frenzy fatigue time? Are you sure about that?
---
Ikr
---
Yep. Funny how easy it is when you realize how much information the game gives you.
---
Good question
---
Some people are just dumb with this game. I'll never understand players who just resort to name calling the second they loose. Tunneller, Looper, Camper, Spammer you name it! Toxic cry baby killers and survivors really need to stop messaging people this BS.
---
If they do do it, it might not be too bad honestly- but for gods sake don’t put current cosmetics in. People already bought those for likely much more combined than this stupid pass.
---
this must be a joke.
---
What is it with lagswitchy Freddies? I had one recently where I kept lagging back through a jungle gym, then he lost me &amp; I was on the total opposite side of the Coal Tower building. I could see behind me that he had no idea where I was because he was still checking the jungle gym, then all of a sudden I ricochet backwards nine feet and am downed by a Freddy who somehow crossed the entirety of the building in under two seconds.
---
Just so you know having a style that constantly changes is perfectly fine and many people never stick to one style. Just have fun with it and if you decide to make an instagram account I’d love to follow it ❤️
---
nah chief this cant be it.
---
Looks like you froze time, did some stuff, then unfroze time to watch your actions catch up with the present. Or the game is just buggy, take your pick.
---
The hillbilly is really overpowered, not to mention killers who play him will always run BBQ And have a road map to all survivors once they hook someone. I find the best way to stay alive with him is to make sure ur close when they hook a survivor or run distortion perk and when looping always go around corners and obstacles and turn at the point when you hear him charging with the chainsaw.
---
Right in the feels
---
Oh boy and if you dont do well, then its a whole new set of insults.
---
I had that happen once where a survivor got stuck in a locker and I tried getting him out but the only thing he could really do was dc.
---
Love this new endgame collapse it solves so many problems with 1 mechanic.
---
Stay in safer areas, so he's forced to M1 you.  
---
Drop pallets slightly earlier to counter Spirit Fury.  
---
If the Billy revs at a pallet, they most likely are going to try and break it, try getting another loop(unless they're good).
---
"Can be" is the keyword here. Decisive and dead hard can also be crutch, as well as some other perks
---
Lol don't you dare, you'll get submersed by downvotes and troll responses from the angry killer mains that lurk there.
---
deerstalker, allows to put pressure on more survivors at once
---
 I think skins will be changed to the release
---
I'm 21 thanks and yes you don't owe me nothing.  
---
Neither I will wanted something from a guy that goes and says: That's bad  
---
Without giving an explanation, you sure I'm the kid in this situation? if it's so explain it if you can **which I'm highly doubting by now**
---
It makes sense if all players tryharding to destroy it.
---
TBH that Claudette wasted a lot of occasions to open the gate.
---
Against a somewhat okay Hillbilly, you're pretty much dead if you don't have any safe areas nearby.  
---
(Safe areas have pallets and/or windows)

It's only RNG if you're in tier 3, but the doc is *usually* chasing you when in T3.
---
Not even the survivors got mad with you after the match, this is a nice game.
---
Because your a killer
---
Billy's OP btw.  
---
Yea, sure.
---
Switch?
---
I play the other day whit a 4 man group whit DS/BT/adrenaline/DH and MOM. Sometimes you need to be toxic AF &lt;3
---
Hopefully because if they don't then boy will there  be rage.

New account not even an hour old so I’ll take that with a grain of salt
---
New account so I’m gonna be taking this with a grain of salt
---
Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the playerbase. But this does put a smile on my face.
---
Nope lol
---
I thought it would be a bad idea at first but for the high hours players that pretty much got nothing to gain by playing more, this will make me sink a lot more hours into this game.

Extra BP for late TBag

I've seen either Noob3 or Monto run STBFL on legion as well, there's a video of it.

She was hard to see, but visible.

She was only at 78% camo here.

Is this Spirit without any addons? Because holy shit, she is slow as hell in phase walk!
---
Standing perfectly still.
---
Hey anyone else hear sc
---
Ignorance.
---
I was thinking that same thing! It would be a good way to play as whichever one you find aesthetically pleasing.
---
I agree, body blocking the basement would be considered holding the game hostage. Dropping someone on the floor just puts them on a 4 min timer. 
---
I did not intend to refer to survivors as only male. Thats just a remnant of the generic masculine used in my mother tongue. Sorry for my lacklustre comprehension of the English language.
---
english is not my first language still you are not giving any arguments about why my idea is bad or why I'm a kid
---
Power. c r o n c h

Spine chill, adrenaline, self-care, sprint burst. All red/pink colored, SB with crazy low cooldown, self-care healed way faster, and if you saw spine chill light up for more than 1 second you got the fuck outta town immediately. 2016 had its highlights
---
But the RBT never did killed if you got the hatch
---
Two different companies own the rights to Ghostface and Sydney. Scream isn't owned as one entity. That being said, I hope they pull a sneaky on you final girl fanatics and give us Brenda. The entitlement to certain characters is getting cringey.
---
3 survivors up with no noed? the gates are getting powered lmao.
---
SWF isnt that bad, holy shit, calm it dow
---
Because you act like we are fucking bad and a 4k is easy for us because we are at a green or purple rank. This guy maxed everything with a Freddy, the weakest killer in the game that most of the time has to tunnel or camp in order to get kills but this guy just hooked all of them 3 times. Be nice and say "Nice job" Or "Good job" or idc but don't say

Cool story.

---
&gt; Honestly EGC does nothing to stop teabagging
---
the new killer can tea bag. hopefully they add fortnite dances to the game for survivors to BM a different way.
---
Played against a hag who thought she could hit through dropped pallets today
---
The picture implied three people made it to endgame. I’m implying that the survivors don’t complete enough generators to get there.
---
Wow, how the fuck did they manage to do this?
---
Cabbage Hatch Kids
---
Disabling the Trappers traps by stepping in them
---
Yeah it has quite a few good cosmetics and I wouldn’t mind the bloodpoints and iridescent shards but it better be like $10 bucks or lower
---
I love it when toxic survivors fail at trying to be toxic and insta rage DC LEL. Shows how bad the community of this game is right now when a survivors main intent is to ruin the killers gameplay.
---
There's proof that goes both ways. I'm convinced we will be getting a new map, survivor and killer though. 
---
For one, as streamer (fog whisperer) confirmed there **wouldn't** be any new survivor coming with Ghostface. They haven't gotten into legal trouble though with BHVR for saying that though, so we *could* assume their information was false/a way to surprise us.
---
A new map and new survivor weren't found in the dev build but there also weren't 3 perks for Ghostface. 
---
June 2019 is exactly 3 months after March and would be the first Year 4 chapter of Dead by Daylight. It would open up for a Year 4 roadmap. The devs even said on twitter they accidentally leaked the upcoming **chapter** content (they called it a chapter!). While BHVR can be very inconsistent at times, the person calling a standalone killer release a chapter would be too incompetent.
---
Freddy is only weakest as a Reddit meme, man.
---
Heyyy I think that was me. Were you playing huntress and throwing axes at me after you dropped me by the exit door?
---
Actually it would be the survivors that cry about it then post their tears on reddit, although it's possible the OP is the biggest for actually making a lame meme.
---
Yep. If you re alone and hatch's closed, might at well disconnect. I hope they ll fix it without breaking everything.
---
It doesn't do anything, by the time i break the pallet either A im no longer blind, or B, i swing then recover then the chase continues, it just wastes your flashlight
---
it's not my idea, these are literally word definitions. if you don't want to use them properly that is fine but don't be weirded out people don't agree with them.
---
Issue with the licensed survivors is they get sweet FA when it comes to cosmetics, obviously this is changing but i'd rather spend my time playing a survivor i can customise vs one i can't.
---
That being said i like Quentin.
---
If you ever touch code you will see that this is unfortunately not too uncommon. Fix one bug get 10 new is not only a meme, it's reality zubSMILE.
---
correction: cause you've watched too many OchiDO videos, that's why.
---
I thought this wasn’t a problem because of dedicated servers?
---
What the hell are "meta perks"?
---
Honestly I hate that the killer can close the hatch now. Personally I miss hatch standoffs because I can just make them wait there while I go 99 all the generators, break all the totems, and farm boldness off the camping killer. Then I can go pop all the generators and immediately give him three exits to cover. I never lost a hatch standoff. But since EGC I've never escaped by myself
---
&gt;If you don't want the survivors to BM you at the exit gate, don't let them get to the exit gate.
---
TL;DR: Git gud
---
I’m sorry your ego is tied to being nice in a video game, hope you get better soon.
---
I like to use a flashlight lithe and dance with me to sometimes make a good juke at a vault. Has a decent success rate.
---
I love being a nurse main.
---
No don’t disconnect actually try, I’ve escaped in this scenario before but when someone gives up it makes them look bad
---
He's not finished yet so it's hard to say
---
I honestly thought they just nerfed it with the update.  Didn't even realize it was bugged.  I'm dumb.
---
Im not cheering for any side, It's just that as a  killer, it was his duty to find you, since he went directly towards you, it was gg, he would just have to hear your pain moans.
---
This game is one big learning process.  
---
You don't stop getting better at one point. The more you play and watch people play the game, the better you get.
---
That's not true though in cases I've had. Usually those who do it to me have that extended duration addons going and it lasts a mean few seconds and gets so annoying.
---
Clown = Sus
---
Susie = Mable
---
Legit thought about you the second I saw this post. Ain’t surprised you commented.
---
I love love LOVE when survivors do this, because it's like I get to break the pallet for free, without worrying about them gaining ground. I wear headphones, so I don't even need to see them to know which direction to turn and follow, while I'm blind.
---
EVERY Quentin i see uses Urban Immersion, farms me, and DC's when They get downed for being an idiot.
---
Understatement of the year
---
Better be a cosmetic soon

*laughs in Wraith*
---
Asians do have these cute baby traits.
---
As much as I despise noed, it's not the issue here. Fuckwits will be fuckwits regardless, you could walk in there perkless and would still get abused. I was once given shit by THE KILLER for picking flink instead of dead hard or sprint, just because it's not meta (yet works equally well). I didn't argue because you don't argue with idiots.
---
Was just talking about it in general. It's funny to me when people take offense when others meme on them.

---
Its not that i dont like the game, its the pass. A battle pass on fortnite is ok since its f2p but for DBD you have to pay 20 dollars and some more of you want a battlepass. It just looks like they want to milk more money from us with the 10 dollar skins (wich you dont have to buy, i know) and then a fucking battle pass for a game you already paid for. My point just is that i dont like the direction this would lead to if they would put in a battle pass.
---
That makes sense! I solo'd 4 gens one game and only had like 4000 Objective Points
---
We got a fair idea, but there wasn’t anything to imply no nose; he just likes to wear faces. Which from a psychological point for him, was interesting how he’d use that for “dress up”
---
I'm not even that good at killer I go into every game just hoping to get some bloodpoints not caring if they escaped or not. And some games I'll get maybe one barbecue stack after I hook the guy that looped me for all five generators and at that point I just want to hook his buddies one time so I can double bloodpoints from it. Then instead someone comes up and unhooks him with borrowed time, and then the borrowed time eats a hit so I can't get the savior
---
Killers= easy life
---
That's what reddit's for
---
I think they were buffed
---
Yep, for a new player Spine Chill is huge.
---
Can you imagine if pennywise (or some killer) had the ability to shapeshift into a survivor with like a tiny detail that skilled survivors would be able to spot? Survivors would be panicked unsure if the guy/girl next to him working on the gen was the killer or not
---
u/peanits what do
---
PeepoLove
---
That has happened to other people it's not your pc however I've never had it happen
---
How does a bug like this make it through to production? It seems pretty obvious.
---
yeah, he used bbq to find me which is a valid tactic but as a bitter survivor: how dare he
---
I'm ok with charging for cosmetics that don't change the general gameplay or grind. I'm not ok with mechanics that allow you to pay real money for in-game currency, or in this case to have the priveledge to grind out currency rewards to decrease the grind; a much easier solution would be to simply rework the Bloodpoint economy without the paying extra to lessen the grind part.
---
Every time. Try to take it easy and get stomped(then shit on), try to win and get shit on.
---
Fair enough, it's a huge pain tho I lost so many games bc of it and then survivors complain too bc of it
---
but you still always gotta go for the save
---
Groovy.
---
Devour Hope
---
Everybody here always gives the devs shit for everything, but almost none praises them when they do a good job (which they actually do compared to other studios) - yet they all spent atleast 300h in a game that they probably only paid 10-20$ for.
---
Yes I re-watch it was from stealth.
---
His stealth lasts forever until he is seen
---
This is the only community I regularly look at even during periods when I’m not playing the game anymore.
---
He definitely has fucked up teeth though.
---
I’m one of those wraiths at higher rank 😂😂😂
---
The changes were for the best because it removed the low counterplay gameplay. But people were pissed because we were promised a rework. This isnt a rework. They just removed any potential for feral frenzy to actually down someone and gave them regular movespeed. So now they have to play as a standard movespeed m1 killer to get second hits and down anyone. Standard m1 killers suck. Theres a reason wraith doesnt get much action at rank 1.
---
More like Killer = *End my life* amirite
---
I understand perfectly how leaks work I'm not stupid.
---
I'm saying it can litteely go both ways if it is or not.
---
I won't, trust me.
---
Just a lil bit
---
PressF
---
The perk is a counter to stealth killers, it’s the only point to the perk other than to attract killers cuz you don’t wanna do gens
---
Ok, I reported this and thought I was the only one here
---
Were you planning is a spirit on Haddonfield? I remember getting stuck in a locker on that map while I had one other friend alive. So I basically just let the spirit keep trying to get me out of the locker while he looked for the hatch. And when he found it I just DCed so they could get out
---
Its his first ever Post no way its even close to real
---
Lies. Devs never talked about a Legion rework. McLean talked about changing how Feral Frenzy worked, and thats what they did. You are not supposed to down with Feral Frenzy, FF is supposed to be a tracking, movement and time waster tool.
---
Uff-bay ig-pay

---
I don't think this is meant to be criticising the killer. It's just, "I tried a thing, it didn't work, bummer." Calm down.
---
Ok kiddo
---
I like it
---
is this Agitation
---
Maybe she was trying to break it 😂
---
Farming is always worth it for a killer running BBQ, it's not for a survivor without WGLF because they end up with 15/20k at most, which is basically what they already get on average. While bitching about is was pretty much overreacting, I get why they didn't want to farm.
---
They need to switch to a faster killer until they learn loops a little bit better. Slow killers need to be even better at loops than faster ones. And please don't try to mindgame on a loop with no LOS blockers lol
---
and why isnt that normal lag?
---
Same, whenever I know that Survivors just want to rub it in my face in the Exit Gates I instead go away from the gates and start doing actions that grant me Blood Points, like using the chainsaw as Hillbilly, vomiting on stuff as Plague and ingesting left over fountains, running as Legion etc.
---
Thanks for letting us know. We'll get QA on it right away.
---
thank you so much! 
---
are there any plans to reimburse the survivors that lost points during this bug?
---
Pretty good so far
---
"I'm gonna go look for the Hatch".
---
I didn't even hook anyone, I just chased them and let them stun me. They weren't 100% on board with the farm, most of them did generators.

---
On at least xbox this last week, there's a bug where you get extra bp when using certain offerings. I've been getting way more than I've been losing to gens.
---
Or at least a stack for every two heals. I want some kind of motivation for running a white mage build
---
Nah was Myers.
---
When I play survivor I’ll still dc on a legion. I play the game to have fun and quite simply I don’t have fun in legion games.
---
Really? This subreddit is easily impressed...
---
Lol this happened to me as well
---
Lol
---
That's understandable
---
&amp; Knuckles
---
My bad 😅
---
It was this moment he knew... he fucked up
---
I would not think about it at all. There probably may be a few cheater (the amount should be reaaaally low) but personally i almost never got into a situation where i thought about someone cheating.
---
Legion needs something his power is useless and he's now just an m1 killer there is no reason for you to use ff now, if you miss its gone, if you get stunned its all gone, even if you're outside of ff and hit someone you lose it as well. There is literally no reason to use FF either the vault is slow the speed burst isn't even worth it anymore. If they're grouped up great but 90% of the time they can easily outrun you and you can't get a second stab in. This actually gives you a reason to use FF and encourages you to go after other people and actually allows you too. If we don't get changes like these than at least give us the old FF sprint speed and a faster vault speed. That was the only reason Legion was some what useable before. I am perfectly fine with the deep wound timer now and the same with the multiple stab because as legion you should go after multiple survivors and not just tunnel one . Franks mixtape can stay I never use it and its stupid.... 
---
This is just my personal opinion and I used to be a survivor main and I at first hated the legion but now that I actually play killer and play Legion I learned how annoying it is to actually play em. What makes it worse is that behaviour doesn't know the difference between rework and nerf. Instead of actually re working ff and making it better for the killer and survivor they just nerf it so its literally un useable. I can pull off a 4k here and there but thats only if im going against potato survivors. Like what Monto said a when legion came out (It may have been someone else but I think monto) Feral frenzy is a nuisance it isn't a threat like any other killers ability . Its a nuisance for the killer now.
---
\*\*I hope what I wrote makes sense Im also trying to pay attention to a lesson so ignore the grammer/spelling mistakes if possible\*\*
---
With 600+ hours I can honestly say: I have no doubt there are cheaters (on both sides), but the percentage is so small, that I just don't care. I've seen 2 blatant cheaters in all that time (one killer and one survivor), and can't think of any suspicious games when I was thinking "Why is it so hard for me? Is my opponent cheating?"
---
But maybe it's because I don't think about DbD as a competitive game and have no problems with losing.
---
wtf are you talking about? So they are changing Freddy because he is a Reddit meme? No he is the weakest killer, he isn't insanly hard to play but he is the weakest. Ask anyone to make a killer tier list and Freddy will be in F tier
---
Oh that would be hilarious
---
Can you imagine being the one survivor left, probably just started a gen and hears the hatch opening?
---
It looks like you can even get free rewards. Assuming that the pass will cost $10, you'll get way more cosmetic items than outright buying a $10 outfit in the store.
---
Try thinking and making your own conclusions before jumping on the BaTtLe pAsS BaD bandwagon.
---
First week is fun and then you're at your normal rank again.
---
Sorry to be that guy but could you please get the QA team to take a look at the Father's Glasses add-on for The Spirit? It hasn't been working for a while (not showing blood trails when haunting).
---
I aslo hate it when they say "outplayed" in the end game chat, like no you and your swf team all running MoM against an M1 killer (myers main) isnt outplaying. I dont tunnel so they always heal back up and at this point its tiring to get to end game, think i have someone down, only for them to run away again just to T-bag at the gates. :(
---
I've played quite a bit, and I can say confidently that I've only experienced cheating once or twice. The number of hackers I've dealt with is very slim, easily less than 0.25% of my games
---
The devs could easily set up a premier spawn prevention so totems can’t spawn writhing 20meters of a generator or other objectives.
---
I do love your suggestions for new killers, especially Jacket. The only complaint I have is with The Predator's power. Cloaking and crouching would both remove its terror radius so it seems a bit excessive to give him both of those.
---
It's a glitch but I guess that's a thing too
---
There are a number of ways in which the situation you mentioned could have happened legitimately. I have never seen someone blatantly cheating in my 700+ hours playing killer. If it's any comfort, the anti-cheat Dead by Daylight uses (Easy Anti Cheat) is relatively widely used and, as far as an anti-cheat program is concerned, a subtle cheat is just as east to detect as a major one.
---
Nope. I just kill them during the mid game to prevent any gates getting powered.
---
down syndrome isnt cute
---
E L O N G A T E D  M Y E R S
---
I'm curious about why you think that Plague is one of the weakest killers. Not trying to shitpost, I'm just curious
---
Turned out that was my Devour. Surprisingly managed to get 5 stacks and got 2 moris.
---
I just restarted the game, and it did not save my last progress... again
---
Those cosmetics already exist l, ain't no pass having them
---
That would explain my generator daily, I fixed 3 gens and was soo confused why I didn't get it
---
Does the anti cheat you mentioned actually work during a gameplay? And would you notice a cheater with let's say 1 or 2% movement speed? 
---
I mean I can just report a player postgame if I notice a big difference but not a "hard to tell I'm not sure type of one"
---
You don't have to play, if you think cheating is a big problem.
---
welp, that explains quite a lot for me. ty
---
Do you wanna read the 1138 page tome? That shit is scary.
---
Do you want to play a game?
---
It sure is a big problem for competitive players.
---
Probably Myers considering Laurie’s right next to him
---
If you close the hatch you cant open the gates.
---
If i were you, i will after the Nea hahaha
---
He doesn’t look like death in this model
---
Competitive players? In DbD? Really? Please link me to latest leaderboards or e-sport teams sites. I want to know who's officially the best.
---
Wait, was the survivor a Claudette? With the gray top hat?
---
*A Nightmare On SAW Street*
---
I thought they called Ash DLC a paragraph
---
Ah yes so you follow the survivor’s rules for killers by not patrolling gens, props to you man!
---
I did it once in the lower ranks since i havent played in a while i was playing with complete noobs. Anyways the game starts and the killer was nurse and holy shit these noobs were scared as fuck, I did the first 2 gens then the nurse found me I gave her a looong chase she lost me (lol baby nurse). Then i proceeded to do the other 3 gens since every time she saw me she Noped the fuck out.
---
This... does put a smile on my face
---
it gets you objective blood points, which like I mentioned before chances are you wouldn't have max objective due to everyone cooping gens together unless you have prove thyself, not to mention why not just get a free item in a match like this, AND in this instance Claudette was close enough to Bubba to where she probably was getting evader points sitting there so why not search a chest while doing so.
---
Next to the first tree 5head
---
This explains my low points as someone that is almost always sitting on a Gen.

There were also some bugs (for example: you could abuse clown addons to get movementspeed) a few month ago when patches got released (and back then, patches got released earlier on PC, so it was already fixed on console release)
---
morde isn't basic stuff, if you tell me not getting gold for killing a minion or destroying a tower, then this would be kind of a problem.
---
u can compare morde with things like the spirit and her problems (sound bug, add ons bug).
---
other basic stuff would be windows that people can vault, even tho they supposed to be blocked.
---
but i'm not even sure if u understand the difference. xD
---
Good work! You drew her very pretty
---
It detects alterations done when the .exe boots up. I never seen a cheater in all my time playing this game, witch is 996 hours. I can safely say to you that hacks are very rare and its worth it to change to pc (If you run the game well of course).
---
Yea he does look quite different
---
Not mad in the slightest. But to think that cheating is a really big problem in DbD is... not optimal, let's say. It'll definitely lead to more frustration when you'll play against very good players.
---
Ghostface = upvote
---
Nah the community is just a utter toxic mess
---
Aw thank you!!!!!!
---
Well that’s great. I went from 8-14 on my survivor and 13-17 on my killer. Think the devs did a pretty good job.
---
Billy is fun to just run around the map tho
---
[sorry it’s been a month lmao](https://imgur.com/gallery/tiyB98k)
---
I think it is because of the Extra time it takes plus just being annoying.
---
Much obliged man good to know. I'm still waiting for the dedicated servers, it's gonna be great.
---
this explains a lot. had some games where i got awfully few points, even though i repaired multiple gens...
---
Honestly yeah. DBD and The Big Gay have become 1. Even the Straightest of Straight Men have their panties drop for Myers, I love it.
---
If you don't respect pallets, you'll benefit from this combo.
---
When you get her to p3 you have unlocked the cooking ability, paired with urban evasion it turns in the the invisible perk
---
I just been in this place before
---
That’s what you get for playing legion
---
M1 killers definitely benefit the most because it is easier to loop them. They are good perks to run on any killer though.
---
You were to busy asking if you can do it and not should i do it
---
What perks do people on here consider "meta"? Whenever I play that randoms seem to run a variety of perks.
---
I’m actually glad because I accidentally got into rank 9 and I wasn’t competitive and got GGEZ’d more than not 😂
---
My thoughts exactly, but her idol is Jason and not her father. Thats why Billy is so extremly mad gritty.
---
someone needs to play a match with the donkey kong bongos
---
I would love Shaun
---
Entity confused???
---
Lose. Loose is a bit different
---
Basically anyone that's going to be looping. That really only excludes maybe stealth killer builds (e.g. scratched mirror Myers) and Nurse. Maybe Clown also, since he shortens loops already. Idk about Freddy.
---
it happens at rank 1 too
---
Yup exactly. But I wasnt even like guarding it hard core. I just knew 2 of them saw it and it was the beginning of the match so I was the spirit and stayed nearby lol.  Caught the guy out him on the hook saw 2 people across the map with bbq, and knew the other one was nearby or trying to cleanse it. So went to it, he gets saved I head towards the hook and the guy is selfcaring right near the hook I spirit over there knock him down and he dcs... then sends me a message. Lmaoo.
---
Lol u can't be a "toxic looper" there's literally no such thing. What does she expect u to do? Run in a straight line? Duck in a corner like a ninja Claudette? Idk bout some ppl lol
---
Always get that spelling the wrong way 'round
---
Same reason I've been called toxic for giving a hooked survivor a little slap when they've been a slippery/cheeky bastard. Taunting is now considered toxic. 
---
While tbagging/clicky clicky at pallets can be annoyingly aggravating I recognize taunting is part of the game. The only thing I find truly toxic is end game harassment by messaging/pc chat and refusing to end a game either by killer body blocking or survivors refusing to leave, the latter having been fixed. I consider intentionally throwing games worse than toxic, fuck those people.
---
To me nothing wrong with a bit of taunting as long as you can shake hands and say gg at the end. Frustrating thing is telling apart the person who is honestly trying to playfully taunt you and the fucker that's going to spew shit at you in chat at the end win or lose is pretty impossible until the end, and generally more likely to be the shit spewing...
---
Damn, that commodious tho... RIP
---
Pretty sure I was the wraith here since I had this happen last night on the same map at the same spot.
---
I have seen survivors getting stuck in lockers but getting stuck in a hook was new to me.
---
I think the playbase might be to small to split. It could increase the queue times.
---
Also, with 2x BP in ranked, people would meme there as well since they probably end up with more BP as on casualmode
---
New account btw.

they need to make it that when 2 people dc the killer and suvivors save thier offering, i lost a suvivor puddong cause the same thing happened to me, exept i was freddy and they dc'd cause they got down 2 mins after the match started
---
Finally someone knows of Nightbreed
---
Yeah it's frustrating. A Scream chapter is what I've wanted the 2 years I've played this game, it would be such a let down if it wasn't actually a Scream chapter and turned into some stupid joke.
---
Definitely does make more sense. I just hope it's only cosmetics being delivered
---
That was amazing! That song fits perfectly.
---
But when youre billy it feels good x'D and it feels even more good against a good survivor x3
---
Ok Jimbag
---
If you wait 30 seconds in a lobby eac will kick any cheaters. It's not a big problem. If you see someone suspicious...call them out in post game chat to explain. Then report them. You will need recorded proof of it.
---
It's strong against M1 killers - but it also reveals the person after they heal to full - so stay injured or heal and be revealed if your basically not right infront of them.
---
It has a downside, everyone pretends it doesnt exist. 
---
They should nerf it against m1 killers and buff it against instadowns like billy.
---
Shit your pants instead of save the best for last, thats how i play him now days, i actually love that perk on myers.
---
Yeah that's dumb and really childish of them. I really don't know why killers think looping is toxic lol. It's literally the only way to stay alive. If we run in a straight line they eventually catch us (or if its Huntress throw Axe at us), if we duck in a corner and our cosmetics aren't emersed enough which 80% aren't, then they get us, if we run from pallet to pallet we waste them and every other survivor gets punished for it. Idk lol
---
League of Legends &amp; Sonic would like to have a word.
---
This is racist and sexist
---
He was pretending to be afk. He had been pretending to be afk for a while. It is a scummy tactic. Most survivors would probably think someone would not use such a pathetic tactic.
---
Oof, I'm probably the wrong person to ask since I've actually been fairly absent during the current meta. I do know Mettle of Man is ridiculously popular right now. Adrenaline springs to mind, as does Dead Hard just to name a few. Also consider whatever rank you will play a huge factor in what the Randoms you play with run.
---
The numbers say otherwise, but alright.
---
Yeah, that's why I think she needs changes. Besides add on changes.
---
"Allan please add details" &lt;3
---
I think that they should add to 5th perk for both, but that perk can only be one of their teachable perks (for balance) then the survivors would be more unique and less kinda skin.
---
I mean, I get the t-bags and just being obnoxious, but toxicity never bothered me in Dead by Daylight as much as in other games. If I'm playing Dota or some other game that's way more competetive, then I have to put up with flame all game long in chat, whereas in DBD it's just at the very end. It might be bad, but I think it's easier to ignore than in other games.
---
it's not, but it is quite unnecessary and can be annoying. 
---
Really the only gameplay aspect (on surv side) besides literal exploiting that's straight up toxic is humping OP tiles like Grim Pantry, Ironworks, Crotus etc. there is straight up 0 excuse, people who do that are assholes.
---
Rank reset is almost the only way you can unlock Killer adept achievements anymore thanks to the 2 pip condition and how fucking hard it is to 2 pip past mid ranks.
---
But really. Rank reset is likely because DbD isn't, or doesn't want to be, a competitive game. Either by design or dev failure DbD just can't be balanced well enough to EVER support a proper or lasting ranking system. So the devs didn't bother making a lasting rank system and went with a monthly resetting system.
---
If the devs thought of that ahead, then it's rather smart. Knowing your games limits and building around them to support your vision instead of just forcing the game to be something it isn't. If DbD had a lasting rank system, then it likely wouldn't be DbD at all. Ending up to be just another 4v1 "horror" game like the countless others who all failed within a month or 2.
---
puddong, I don't know why, but it sounds so funny for me... lol
---
Sooo just like any hitboxes in this game?
---
chase points and survival points.
---
Me too! Did a few rounds of gens, yet, scored way less than any of my teammates. So glad they are fixing it!
---
The only boi who actually gets Stalker points
---
&gt; if you tell me not getting gold for killing a minion or destroying a tower, then this would be kind of a problem.
---
There was a bug where you could CS certain special effects and get thousands of gold instantly. You could kill Xerath's Q animation with a Tryndamere E and get thousands of gold for it, literally ruining the game for everyone in it since you'd be so far ahead for free.
---
How about you stop acting like bugs like this are specific to Dead By Daylight when the fact of the matter is they happen in every single multiplayer game out there that gets regular updates? Coding isn't easy and as far as bugs go one that affects your bloodpoints in specific situations like this is hardly one to get pissy over.
---
My favorite thing to do with it is to thwart scratched mirror Myers
---
OINK!!
---
Hell yeah oink
---
I'd be okay with instant down add ons being completely removed as long as instant heal items got removed and survivor healing speeds were doubled.
---
See? I can be unreasonable too.
---
its called a squadette
---
Thanks, i am going to watch it 😀
---
He needs more love in this community in general.
---
As a Quentin main I'm relentlessly bullied in game.
---
Yeah I mean camping is annoying anyway but when killers send you a message after the game "don't play toxic then I don't camp and tunnel you" I'm always like "okay next time I'm not moving so you can get me easy and jump infront of your face into a looker and stay in there.... I really don't get people like that... I mean I'm playing killer too but I'm never like "away don't loop me" I mean of course I'm getting triggered when I'm boosted as fu** and make a mistake after mistake but I would never send the survivors a message like "don't loop me" *cries like a 10 year old* 
---
This community is toxic anyway but on ps even more....
---
Ok, better idea.
---
When you are hit with an attack that would take you into the dying status for the 3rd time, you ignore the hit.
---
The aura thing stays the same.
---
Tada, fixed
---
I am so sick of the default change being deep wounds, when that's a shitty mechanic. At this rate every killer power is going to involve it.
---
The Dark Devotion changes are not okay, silencing the use of the Killer's Power make it so that The Nurse can teleport without screeching to the entire map, The Hillbilly and The Cannibal's chainsaws are completely silent, it's trying to buff a gimmick perk from a killer which, the change suggested alone makes it way stronger than it really needs to be.
---
And I never play survivor.
---
This is blursed
---
Damn, they boned the perk then, but kinda buffed some of the others I guess
---
Yeah billy is a cutie :3
---
Absolutely. I will go 6-8 months without playing, but r/deadbydaylight has somehow had the best memes since it's inception. Honestly, back when DBD was super early access, and infinite looping was something nobody thought would ever get fixed, I never imagined the game would survive this long. 
---
I remember people on the sub claiming the game would be dead as soon as F13 dropped. Hehe.
---
rank 4
---
No it kinda got nerfed along with the ds. So it can be turned off the instant someone uses ds and ita switched to another person.
---
So you have an option: to play, say, Leatherface and get 20k BP, or play harder(?) round and get... 30-40k BP... hmm... hard choice.
---
I mean, there's no way "casual" mode will be so easy that you'll routinely get same BP as in "ranked".
---
Wears Nea
---
I usually play as P3 Claudette and run self care, adrenaline, balanced landing, and empathy.
---
No it doesn’t it stays because when you have an obsession perk as killer the obsession never changes.
---
No, i meant i'm a billy main and i like just running around with the chainsaw ability. I'm an average killer and sometimes i just wanna run around and mess about :P
---
Haven’t been rank 20 since I first booted the game, but I try to stay stay around 4/5/6 unless I switch off my main.
---
I've never seen blatant or slight hackers besides lagswitching. I wouldn't worry about it. It's very easy to blame losing on cheaters (did they do another dead hard ir did I miss?) I think this has a lot to do with how janky hit boxes are. 
---
My credentials: 780 hours currently, only 100 of those are killer though
---
*He approaches.*
---
This corner thing was pretty clutch, I've never seen that before, but you do often get these situations where a survivor is going to *just* make it to a pallet/window unless the killer starts lunging before the survivor has actually committed. You can often catch killers off guard by "faking" a window, and they'll lunge because they have no choice. You can sometimes even do this when they're close enough to still hit you anyway, because when they 100% expect you to go a certain direction, you can catch them off guard. It's all about being able to judge the distance between you and the killer.
---
We have no way of fully knowing. It definitely is supposed to.
---
It would make sense if we got a licensed killer now that we got a solo licensed survivor, but this is supposed to be the chapter expansion which has always had killer, survivor, and map, even the licensed ones (jigsaw, Halloween, nightmare on elm street)
---
I would say rancor has the potential to get multiple exposed+mori's, play with your food can keep stacking if you kill the current obsession, just the ones from the top of my head
---
*happy oink noises*
---
I always wait a few days to make it extra spicy.
---
That or I just hate the game after my rank gets too high so I need to take a break and this is a good time to do so.
---
🐷 oink oink! We love miss piggy
---
I’ve had the opportunity to finally grind a fair amount of dead by daylight out lately and I was wondering why I felt like getting bloodpoints was super slow compared to any other time. Now I know we are not entitled to shit from the devs but I really do hope they either compensate the bloodpoints we lost individually or give us another 2x bloodpoints.
---
PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR!
---
This is always fun when the survivor is injured. Like thanks! The chase is now over.
---
Yeah it does. I didnt like the DS change in this aspect.
---
Racist, sexist and accurate.
---
Fucking god damn Meg man. Every time 😂
---
Well he did say he looped his for a while on a z wall the tbagged after pallet stunning him
---
My comment was made before that comment.
---
If you have a time machine and play the game under old versions maybe. This hasn’t been a thing since the DS change.
---
Usually after hooking one person I like to do it to the other people too, yes.
---
its a glitch where the nea was about to use unbreakable but u picked her up as soon as she got up... i did it in kwf if anyone wants proof
---
Metal of man, adrenaline, any exhaustion perk, d-strike is the most basic bitch meta.
---
Bold of you to assume this community is the worst in any category by a long shot compared to any other game. We are a delusion and entitled group of fuckwits, sure but take by comparison to a lot of others.
---
Pretty much any m1 killer. Huntress can avoid paletts because you can hit through them or over them. I suppose maybe spirit doesnt need it even though its not bad on her and nurse of course doesnt need it. In fact i would be shocked if one did run spirit fury. And doesnt really need it either.
---
And i...  I am unbreakable.
---
I mean would you pip with emblems if all you did was run the killer for 5 gens and die? Should you even? If you're running the killer around that long then you should have been able to escape.
---
Idk what people’s obsession with turning killers/survivors into little kids, but I’m pretty sure you are predators IRL.
---
Yep I knew you were gonna comment on this
---
I love you skeemoo, but these pictures are way to good looking to be put in this fucking game
---
You don't use close range hatchets as huntress? Literally every high level huntress player disagrees. There is not that much cooldown after a throw so you can easily get a melee off if you can properly block off their movement. Obviously the ability is a long range ability and thats what its primary use is, but close range hatchets are extremely powerful and you're wasting a lot of your power if you dont use them
---
You could just say you made a concept.
---
  
---
No need to disguise this clear fake as a leak.
---
Not necessarily.
---
There are dumb enough randoms that leave people on their first hook (or second).
---
Plus, over half the killers completely counter the perk with their power
---
Damn das an old pic of Monto cuz of the background
---
half the community couldnt even tell.
---
Well seeing as if the account is new and they linked a post by someone who commented to 'confirm' this who also has a new account, it probably is a joke. 
---
Either a joke, an attempt at releasing bullshit as a leak, or an actual insider with BHVR leaking shit for no reason. 
---
I'm going with #1.
---
It’s funny because when you cleanse haunted grounds the killer can 1shot you and ruin would still be up lmao that’s the point of this meme and every other haunted grounds meme, great post dude quality content i look forward to the next haunted grounds meme and the exciting spin it will take on this classic formula.
---
That wouldn’t explain spamming noise notifications to draw the killer over.
---
That's only like 16.5-17 days no biggie 😂
---
Edit: it's much higher, there are 24 hours in a day not 60 🙃
---
Quentin does have the best prestige of any survivor, but it requires prestiging another survivor. :S
---
Throw in Huntress' Lullaby, Madness and Ruin, and you are a literal god.
---
Wow. Waluigi would actually be a good killer. Imagine that.
---
That works then
---
nea is the fucking entity: what does this say about the world we live in? TRICK QUESTION: if nea is a furry and nea is the entity this means they have control over the cosmetics and that means that we miGHT ACTUALLY GET BUNNY FENG
---
thank you for coming to my ted talk
---
Unfortunately not anymore. If DS, MoM or any other obsession perk triggers you are the new obsession and all used perks related to the obsession change targets as well.
---
Ok? I only used it once to Adept Laurie and I just looked away from the killer the entire time, relying only on audio cues.
---
Its actully 41 days
---
God, I wish I could afford that parachute Dwight outfit.
---
Uhm, I think I could try. I don’t have any recording devices other than the Xbox default and my phone lol
---
Currently trying to get every perk on meg, I’ve been running toxic builds for like 2 days now it can be really fun especially with the rank reset if you’re looking to run the killer around use MOM, Decisive, An exhaustion perk, and adrenaline
---
I realized I can't do math after the fact, please roast me
---
reinstall the game, that should fix it:)
---
Everybody is here, (Except Waluigi)
---
Myers brushes his teeth every day it seems.
---
Puddong
---
Looks like Nurse.
---
Exactly! At that point, I am like please stay in the game longer because all you're really doing is helping me get more blood points. Enjoy the gloating that will go completely unnoticed as I earn me some extra blood points :).
---
This is simply not true. If a killer is good enough and determined enough you will go down. Don't forget bloodlust is still in the game and other factors such as getting hit through pallets is still alive and kicking.
---
Leathface wants a word with you
---
I had a game last night against a Legion where I did 4/5 of the gens on the map while my teammates crab walked and spent time healing each other.
---
It's not everyday you die but still double pip.
---
Killers like Myers or Legion who have to done with regular hits I think
---
Of course he does
---
Some killers get mad and try to just camp one kill. Best advice is to tell your friends to go do gens and leave.
---
didnt know people did that. weird.
---
Well NOW i do

---
but how? they would be rank 20
---
because im FURIOUS
---
So the best solution is to let him bleed out?
---
The killer is bad enough that you can run them for the whole game but good enough that you can't break the chase long enough to lose him? I hope you realise that your not intended to run the killer the whole game, so it shouldn't really be rewarded.
---
&gt; It has a downside, everyone pretends it doesnt exist.
---
Because it’s easy to work around it. Self care, medkits and instaheals can all be used to tap yourself to full health which can completely ignore the downside.
---
Feng mains, unite! 
---
...obligatory🐰summon the bummy🐰
---
I do think it was a really good change that really helped certain Killers and certain perks. (Bloodwarden is suddenly A tier) I'm just saying that it's not the magical be-all end-all cure to toxicity.
---
I still really wish that Bloodwarden (or a new perk like Bloodwarden) would block the gate after you stand in it for (x) seconds, just to kick teabaggers in the balls.
---
man you need to talk to your ISP
---
Nor should they. Why does this community need gifts and free shit every time there's a minor bug?
---
DS sucks ass now. It can only be used within 60 seconds of being unhooked. That's not even worth bringing over something like empathy.
---
Ah alright I was confused on how they changed it. Also as u/BoydCooper said: pretty good job so far.
---
I don't know why I love this so much.
---
Yeah but with decisive strike still being used and it changing obsession it sucks ass
---
Allllright, time to practice console nurse 👶
---
Doing gens is the most basic thing in the game, bp is the most basic form of progression. If they didn't test this its embarassing. Or should I say they probably didn't change anything related, so no reason to test but as DBD is notorious by changing something that haa nothing to do with gens they broken gens.
---
Not entirely true. It costs money for the developer to push updates on consoles like xbox and playstation. While you can send out a free update on PC via steam at no cost, the devs are actually punished for their updates, forcing them to push bigger updates, less frequently. This results in bugs sticking around longer on cross-platform games.
---
Lol i was kidding
---
You're letting them get to you, if you failed that is that just chase them out so you can move to the next game if you need tips just ask man :)
---
I as well. But I never wanna go back
---

idk who ur watchign but i know No0b3 has always said that he gets face camped a shitton

This is why I sometimes run BBQ, ruin, nurses calling, and sloppy butcher, then to top it off use prayer beads and fathers glasses, (I’m starting to run out of black wards send help)
---
Dead by Daylight being Dead by Daylight

the problem is, that not every single dbd player is here on reddit, did devs announced anything on the dbd forum? probably not.

Can we get Speedo Quentin custom outfits please?

Is the top picture from the Babadook?
---
Wake up! Would like to know your location

Clowns gas/after piece tonic is an area of effect power which slows looping survivors
---
Yea but who knows bhvr could put their own spin on it to balance it
---
Rank reset happens and you end up playing with low ranks, there’s a chance you get people from your rank but you can still get low ranks in there. It can only take a few hours for people to rank up and some people can’t play the second rank reset happens while others can
---
I always wanted to main him, but the lack of customization is the thing thats holding me back.

If you want modest, lemme tell you about the Clown. Look at the pain he has from being a thicc boy in such small clothing, but he only reveals himself for his santa outfit. That's true courage and bravery right there.
---
This is why when I do play survivor I ran high luck looter builds, those skeleton keys are real helpful for EGC
---
but it’s a pretty slim spectrum, it’s either ultra rare item or a brown toolbox pretty much
---
And bloodward kicks in
---
Thing is, this literally just happened to me, and I didn't even have Self Care. Just a medkit.
---
I don't run self care much anymore, the reason above being why, but now I can't make a clutch endgame save with a fucking medkit in my hands?
---
It’s details
---
Really well written and i would love to see a killer based on this backstory.
---
No idea, found this meme before, found a template and used it
---
Tier 3 Myers with tinkerer
---
inb4 countless "toxic ghost face" Reddit threads by salty survs getting teabagged after downed
---
Yes, I struggle so much going against him... I cant loop very well I try.. but i just csnt escape him unless the player is bad with him. A good Billy it's like a 2 second chase lol
---
To many buttons are assigned to one thing but ah well
---
wheres poor wraith xD
---
I mean, the removal of insta heals is not unreasonable
---
You would also be rank 20 though. Because your rank resets.
---
Ghostface is iconic. More than Pig that's for sure. More than Chucky or Pinhead for the younger generation too.
---
That happened a lot with the old pip system too. People really disliked it, so before the emblem system, they had killers on their own system that worked off of kills/hooks
---
Pain Reliever is the Spine Chill truther representation we need.
---
Clown literally has a Santa outfit.
---
And I knew you would comment on my comment...
---
80 seconds? Get good by hitting great skill checks /s
---
I don’t understand STBFL here. I run all of those perk minus that and use BBQ. Nurse’s is too good to pass up when paired with monitor. They won’t get your terror radios and think it is safe to heal even though you’ll be able to see them (8m terror radius, 28m nurse’s. That is 20m range of “oh I fucked up and can’t do anything about it” for the survivors). Also I’m pretty sure that is dead rabbit add on, you could maybe take out nurse’s at that point and run that plague perk and swap ruin for distressing.
---
No one:
---
Behavior: Breathing now causes the game to crash.
---
How boring is this... Just making the survivors gen rush and do nothing all game just for you to sit there as Leatherface and fuck around... I feel bad for poor bubba and the people that play him like this ):
---
Apparently I'm reading an empty post with 128 upvotes..  good job, I guess?
---
I’ve been thinking about running it! I just don’t know if it would even make that big of a difference tbh so I don’t wanna spend money on the character that may or may not help me out you know?
---
Don't care, want more
---
I mean id just accept that in that situation there is nothing you can do, a 4man running all meta perk and very rare items is unbeatable unless you also are running ebony stuff.
---
Also no red ranks are no different from anywhere up to green ranks. Rank doesnt matter whatsoever
---
I really people would stop throwing childish temper tantrums and moralizing killing survivors like it's some atrocity against mankind.
---
I swear to fuck you whiny little babies need to have your keyboards taken away from you because all you do is spend your time bitching about people playing the game according to the mechanics.
---
Your arbitrary restrictions and attempted social sanctions are about as useless as your fit-throwing.
---
nea and meg are ugly. exept this nea which is apparently not, because it was drawn with talent AND caring.
---
The whole game is a casual mode
---
Any m1 killer
---
Nah
---
These games are also backed by huge corporations  like Tencent or EA. Behavior is still technically an indie-studio.
---
No, see, instead of it saying R1 Unhook or whatever, it said R2 Heal Self (Medkit).
---
It actually shocked and pissed me off
---
For killer, I would probably say hangman’s trick, reusable hooks is really nice
---
For survivor it’s definitely pharmacy for me, it gets a lot of shit for not having a chance at ranger medkits, but if you use ace in the hole, emergency medkits are going to be better most of the time, especially if you stock up and use gel dressings and gauze, as it gives more heals
---
(I’ve been working on a visual to show this)
---
Some killer just care about kills
---
This is why I run Franklin’s, Since then the number of insta-heals I’ve dealt with has dropped to zero 
---
Plus I can pick up an extra kill at the gate when some idiot starts T-bagging 
---
Hit ‘em so they drop their item, if they stay to get it back I’ll down them and hook them
---
:D do full hex build with these add-ons
---
You can still use it aggressively to make plays and it will still hard counter any tunneling or camping
---
I agree. I've played since 2016, approaching 3k hours. I play solo survivor and had always stayed at rank 1. This reset I only made it to 4 mainly because I don't play as often and because of the insane amounts of dc's that happen. (Be it from a bug or intentional). You literally have to steal all the saves and heals, knockout gens and have a decent chase to pip in higher ranks and it leaves very little room for others to pip. In other words, it's becoming more of a chore to play and less fun.
---
Survivors are Hella toxic, it's truly awful
---
Probably assassins creed, not complaining tho because I personally think he looks badass
---
Is he talking about Mathieu Cote?
---
I do that with Infinite Tier 3. It's a lot of fun.
---
I just had a game yesterday where I fucked up royally because I was in a chase with a Legion and I made it to a pallet but instead of “throw down” I got “mend self” and started mending.
---
No, I play perkless Freddy all the time and I 4k most games
---
People also think it’s weird that I let them heal other targets or don’t focus people after unsafe unhooks. Malicious is a tedious emblem to get in Iridicent when the survivors try to get them off the hook too soon after being hooked. What I found is the best medium is hit the unhooked guy to deny the unhooked their benevolent emblem and deny them the WGLF stack and then turn on the unhooker for being a fuckwit.
---
Wasn't lol tribunal like 5+ years ago?
---
Or did they enable it again?
---
this is a glitch that happened to my friend. all 3 survivors didn't disconnect on purpose, you lagged out and forced them all to disconnect. they thought you disconnected, however, there's a small tiny chance one or two people won't get DC'd and will stay in the match
---
Why are we using comic sans?
---
As a killer (ironically as a Freddy main); if I see a P3 bloody face Quentin in my lobby, I know they're gonna be trouble. Always the toughest of the bunch to catch.
---
**WAHHHH**
---
This is exactly how I got my Deranged Pursuit achievement. I would Frenzy hit people through the pallet and Spirit Fury would cover me so I could just swipe them afterwards.

She's really fun to play, you really should get her! Although, I gotta warn you, you need a LOT more skill to play her in the higher ranks than in newer ranks, because when I got her I was rank 12, and every game I played as her I double pipped. But then I got to rank 8 and I was stuck safety pipping for weeks. Only now I'm regularly pipping again. This is probably because at lower ranks survivors just camp pallets and its super easy to get them, and at higher ranks they usually leave them and trail off their scratch marks and stuff, so just be warned about that. Have fun with her though!
---
I learned how to combat your types while I was still in beta
---
That's like playing against an Omega Blink Nurse with an ebony, there's nothing you can do, you just accept your loss and get over it.
---
Quick question--is there a way I can pin a comment?
---
Oh shit why the fuck did I say left behind? It was even shitier before the update 😂😂 I meant Remember Me. Is that right?
---
And this...this right here is why you see killers run nothing but omegablink nurses and instasaw Billy's at red ranks. 
---
Sorry you had to endure that man.
---
Same man, same.
---
This game really needs to work on it's prompts
---
Yep, apparantly a lot of people think you're serious.
---
The real meme here is that perk loadout.
---
I will believe that because of your name.
---
hairline a little wonky
---
I really hope dedicated servers fix this issue.
---
Damnnnn
---
Amen
---
lol started as an indie company... but i can't remember them having so many problems in the first 3 years, obviously they had and still have their problems, but such gamebreaking stuff...? i'm not just talking about the bloodpoint bug right now... overall the game has so many problems.
---
for me dbd has kinda turned into a meme game, if you don't have any bugs/glitches it's not dbd anymore. xD
---
No yeah rank reset is fucked I dont even play the meta killers to give survivors a chance
---
That looks so badass.
---
Quentin is legit my favorite character but the lack of cosmetics makes me sad. Hopefully they work something out with them next. Also while we’re wishing for stuff make his face just a bit better. It’s really not that bad just a small improvement would be great.
---
kinda hate that when survivors are being sacrificed there's like a queue and they have to go one by one
---
Quality, high skill, gameplay from both of you :)
---
Can you explain please?
---
Literally the only time flashlights work on console haha i mean, sure it can work other times if your lucky, but aiming it and getting the stun is incredibly difficult unless they’re at a pallet or gen
---
They looked pretty awful on the latest PTB, so i wouldn't count on that
---
Bullshit, Bill is only ever going to be Available on PC. Try again.
---
Watch me get the gen done in 50 seconds. 
---
*misses 8 skill checks in a row*
---
I mean you can argue the same thing about this group, broken shit on both sides shouldnt exsist
---
well aren't you a ray of sunshine
---
Which was almost universally hated.
---
The thing that helped me was during the lunar event I didn’t kill anyone. I just hooked the twice and the third time I’d take them to a hook and drop them in front so they could be healed.
---
Not killing does two things. 
---
First off it helps stop you from developing salty feelings. If you achieve your goal of hooking everyone twice you feel good. If you do not reach your goal then that’s ok cause you were going to let everyone live anyway, and the game was harder on you anyways cause you couldn’t remove any gen repairing pairs of hands.
---
Any hatemail you end up getting loses it’s impact. If they say you sucked well that’s cause you were purposely not killing them, if they accuse you of tunnelling or camping well that’s funny cause you were actually hoping they would get unhooked.
---
The second thing it does is give you crazy good practice at the game. As I said playing this way makes the game harder so it causes your skill to increase quicker. 
---
When you go back to killing you will have a different outlook on survivors. Not killing them can cause a weird fondness for them that I found lasts. It will also make your gameplay stronger allowing for more wins which is very satisfying.
---
Anyway I hope this helps :) Do it for a week or two it made a huge difference for me when I did it.
---
Edit: For all they same reasons above this is also a great way to get good with a killer you might want to play but currently suck at. I learned to play Freddy really well during the lunar event and now he is my strongest killer.
---
With wild hits like this that are the norm + killers that drop everything to tunnel (PS4 deluxe experience tm)I wonder why people think it’s so crazy survivors like second chance perks.
---
I understand what you're saying and I agree, but just because it "doesn't matter", doesn't mean we should ignore it.
---
Couldn't agree more man.
---
Warning:Video is **LOUD**
---
Stu literally did it out of Peer Pressure. Ghostface as a whole was edgy and dumb which made him scary
---
Honestly I still think Legion is more than just a shitty bootleg Ghostface. I like the whole edgy teen aspect.
---
I think Quentin has the most detailed work with his prestige face cosmetic out of any survivor. But you would have to put in the time to get P3 Quentin for that, so I'm not sure how much of a plus this point is for Quentin.
---
Please get better at photoshop
---
I accidentally did that as killer first time playing on that map 😂
---
Yep, at rank 8 spirit, I try to play really chill, use common addons, nothing too special and stuff not really try all that much, but I end up getting Tbagged and BMed and shit every game, so now I'm pretty much relentless. Always running green/purple and sometimes mother daughter ring addons, I really try until I get the 4k, and i really sweat against Tbaggers and make them regret the day they were born. I went from safety pipping at best every game to regular pipping if I was unlucky at rank 8. Its just the survivors don't realize how much we could actually destroy them, but we just choose to go easy.
---
Rank is stupid, sometimes when I just want to have fun, I'll play no trap trapper, with fun perks, crank up some good music, and have a good time. If I lose I don't care because I can't hear and I'm nerfing myself, if I win, it's a bonus.
---
The power is very weak.
---
Spirit fury = baby killer crutch

---
It’s the day I get face camped because the killer has dying light :(
---
&gt; LEVEL 4 FUCKING CLAUDETTE, WITH NO PERKS, NO ITEMS, INSIGNIFICANT GAME EXPERIENCE. 
---
You know that you don't have to play the survivor you're leveling up right?
---
Stop running selfcare!! I've had that happen to me so many times when I'm waiting on the hook lol... 
---
Or
---
Change your controller buttons
---
Where do I buy.
---
Truly she understands the complexities of the craft
---
Killer has basically done everything right if he kills three people AND finds the hatch first, so I agree, it should be rough on the last survivor
---
You start with it m8
---
Small game and myc
---
Ever wonder why there's 3? Because mikey boy has the 4th on on the ground and is waiting for the last 50 seconds to hook them and activate blood warden.
---
I don't run Self Care anymore, yet this happened a few matches ago while I had a medkit :(
---
It wasn’t self explanatory why he face camped you? Surprised you were able to loop him at all.
---
almost looks like you are in a truck or something..
---
With that said it would be a cool mechanic if we could hide in the back or trucks/cars.. add another dynamic other than lockers.
---
It is just an idea the power can be worked on.
---
Nope, still not feeling it. I don't run Ruin/Noed/Sloppy etc., So those 3-4 toolboxes can find another lobby in no time (it's PC and EU, lobbies are fast for survivors)
---
it happens, dude. Just take a break. I get sick of this game every 3 months
---
I had one guy tell me to stay in the kitchen because i accidentally led the killer to him thinking there was a window where he was not knowing he was there.
---
That feeling when I get a skill check as soon as I stop repairing and blow the gen.
---
I'm sorry m8 but what's tunnel mean?
---
Damn thats actually pretty smart
---
imo his perks are pretty useful, I really like pharmacy, and vigil is useful if you got friends
---
It means the 1st mouse button, which is the default attack button on PC.
---
I know for sure I am Hex Totem King. Ever since these new hiding spots, I’ve been finding the Hexes a lot faster. I’m Hex Totem King until Haunted Grounds pops.
---
Same happened to me with 3 Nea, all dressed the same. They blocked me in a corner near a chest in the basement for like 5 min haha. The killer eventually checked the basement and we started to farm points, was pretty fun in the end
---
dude be careful.. you're being fair and unbiased.. the reddit killer mains are coming for you O_O
---
how do you walk to a hook if you are spinning In a circle
---
In what sense is this a spoiler, and what is it spoiling?
---
How many times do people have to post these memes before they realize game developers have more than one team so they can do more than one thing at once.
---
And right in front of Wraith, you can see a P3 Claudette!
---
Upvote = Upvote
---
Wait what
---
"Entity Displeased!? Yeah well you fix this damn sorcery!"
---
He did have mettle of man, but I do find it odd he would act so confident right before a “glitch” that fucks me over happens.
---
Bold of you to assume that any internet community is normal...
---
Literally Unplayable
---
I see omegablink nurse much more than a toxic 4 man. I see omegablink or 3 blink more than standard nurse nowadays. This 4 man toxic squad isnt that common imo.
---
Nea i still cute in game, you all just dont like girls that dont have a ass the size of 2 moons
---
And when every update is contains more skins than a strip club, you begin to see where the devs priorities lie.
---
As a Console Player: WOW those graphics aren’t garbage
---
Tf you mean
---
For that, there's a perfectly fitting meme
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/anpvnq/please_spread_this_meme/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Why the FUCK my dick hard
---
I dont understand why? What does sweat your ass off mean? If you want to play like a dick fine go ahead
---
Yeah and my base settup is enduring deerstalker agitation and iron grasp, so can also quickly hook survivors after picking them up meaning there would be very little time for the 4th guy to pick anyone else up, switching enduring for bbq also works pretty well
---
Hes 115% its the normal speed that most Killers have. Unless you meant that its just a placebo that he feels faster (because it is)
---
You start with his 3 perks m8, there all yellow but you still got it
---
I mean, they're all pretty sh!t, but DBD, it is one of a few that stands out
---
It's still on upper management to choose priorities and manage staff accordingly. And as u/KillAllLipSmackers points out: it's clear where their priorities lies.
---
Ok so I agree that he’s fine now but I just wanted to propose an idea which makes the power more interactive to use and which is ultimately more interesting.
---
I know the point of the power is to hit all four survivors to make them mend and stall the game out and my idea still keeps with that it changes nothing of how the power wants to hit multiple people it actually rewards you for doing so by making it easier to hit each person Subsequentially 
---
The only thing thing that I highly debated on and am willing to remove that the power does outside of hitting  people to make them mend is it giving a 5% hindered 
---
I also made the addons for the new power better while making the ones that never got used have a niche use
---
But I will state is again no where in this does it buff Feral Frenzy in a way that makes it useful to down/what old legion was it only makes the character more interactive in its power usage
---
There is an official dbd discord...
---
Yes because you dont need to camp, you can just patrol some distance from the hook. Or atleast you could before.
---
No one ever uses the lessen/thicken fog offerings. I think fog intensity should be random on every map with offerings that influence it one way or the other (like map offerings).
---
If you win as Pig you should not type gg but Game over.
---
Also Pig=upvote.
---
Facecamping billy would like to know your location.
---
Was the glitch that he like walked through the hooked survivor so that you hit the survivor on the hook, putting you in attack recovery and unable to stop the unhook?
---
Pig 2.0
---
Nothing changed. But the fact that he has alot of potential got more popular (because its true) hes not really good, far from it but hes also not the worst and people see that now.
---
You know, people always take something for a fact or act something is a fact only because they saw / heard other people saying it.  This appiled to the "Freddy is worst killer" circlejerk and its also a big part of why everyone says hes not the worst now.
---
Whats boring about ruin lol
---
I would be terrified as fuck getting chased by that.
---
No the glitch was he was behind the survivor, unhooking from the back. So all I could do was wait, and hit the survivor getting unhooked
---
Piggy pride 🐷
---
Too bad he snapped himself
---
Ik m8 but it aint bbq unless its leatherface. You need to have luck to actually get it in your other killers bloodweb
---
Why is it when a survivor uses their best perks and add ons it’s fine and they are just playing the game. But when a killer does it it’s “Playing like a dick”?
---
Pig=upvote
---
Did you not see the lag?
---
oh so he was like between the hook and the person on the hook? I have seen that once, it's really rare. As far as I can tell it is completely random when it happens.
---
Wait, is there a version without the red stripe on his gown?
---
Oh shit. I didn't know that m8, i have the purple variant for it on my Leatherface. He's part 2 level 50 so i don't wanna prestige him
---
This happened to me yesterday playing as survivor, all three of the other survivors DCed immediately and the hatch spawned next to me
---
Jeez that's horrible I play both but started as a survivor I never understand tbagging at a pallet especially since alot of m1 killers run enduring/spirits fury they get fucked so many times because of that makes me chuckle
---
Yeah, seems like the further you climb, the more sweaty, toxic players you encounter.  Still, I want those bragging rights.
---
I was hiding from a camping Leatherface and he fell through the hole. Funniest thing I've seen in this game.
---
I feel this would be broken. Borrowed time is balanced by limited uses, 3 per survivor. This would effectively have unlimited uses. Tunneling someone who was downed isn't the same thing as tunneling someone off hook imo.
---
Nah that'd be bullshit if they couldn't bring 2 of the same perk or item in SWF.
---
SEKIY
---
If you are injured, and hit by an attack the state of damage is ignored. After, your aura is revealed to the killer until you heal up to full. Then you can regain your stacks
---
it activates on the 3rd hit, if it gets activated and then you escape the killer and get healed, you can take a hit to be injured, and then on your next hit mettle will prevent you from going down
---
This is cannon I mean come on devs
---
it isn't so much the console, but the controller. trying to flashlight with the controller is incredibly difficult, but with the mouse it's very easy.
---
Okay then. Would you rather they stop adding new content to the game completely, deprive all of their creative staff of work, and spend ages trying to fix every bug in the game while you continue to yell at them for not fixing a specific bug until the community dies due to being deprived of new content allowing the experience to gradually become stale to the majority of the playerbase, or get new content, be happy the game hasn’t been neglected by its developers, and just fucking wait for bug fixes. It’s impossible to simply fix every problem with a game, and the fact that they even acknowledge some of these things is something to be happy of because god knows that a developer with no connection to the community is a death sentence.
---
Unnerving presence?
---
also pretty useless
---
h a t c h k i n g
---
Hopefully you are right!
---
That’s what I mean,m by “console”, implying that we dont have MnK to aim perfectly at the face lol
---
just remember that not all survivors are like that, and not all killers are like that. there are some genuinely good people here, it's just rare to find sadly.
---
Diamond is **UNBREAKABLE**
---
Just in general any halloween mask is not what you would like to use when chasing someone.
---
Agreed.
---
*intensifies. He really is hatch King.
---
Damn maybe moniter and abuse would work for the radius increase during chase?
---
well, this community argues about it a lot for some reason. 
---
what i personally consider tunneling is when you go for one person over and over again(after putting them on the hook) till they die completely ignoring other players. or just chase someone for a very long time completely ignoring objectives and other players. 
---
why it's sort of bad when done in a scammy way when you had a choice not to tunnel? cause you harm the person refusing them their points and emblems. i mean one thing is to tunnel fresh off the hook only injured person cause 1-2 gens left to fix. that's just securing a kill. but many follow injured ones at start and say "it's smart, not a tunnel". i mean yeah, it is a strategy if you want 4k and not a fun game where in the end everyone says gg and no one is frustrated even if died. i like challenge, i mostly keep track of who and how many times i hooked so everyone got their points if no one was toxic.
---
Since he's corrected you I gotta say when I got bbq off of the shrine it always appears before lvl 10 on all my killers so far so fcking happy man bbq is the shit for farming
---
I t-bag during BBQ and chilli hoping the killer things I'm asking for it and leaves me alone... Kinda like reverse psychology?... Idek if it works I should just stop...
---
This has been far worse than anything survivors were doing lately. Sit and bag you while you wait to die rather than just hooking you.
---
hahaha, yeah. i mean i flame red rank Billy with noed even though i cleansed everything but he still got 4k. but it's a red rank Billy. it's shameful to use noed, come on, how smol is ur pp, dawg?
---
Dealing with the biased opinions of people who only play half of this game? Bring it on.
---
Why are you doing this? Because you were home. They are horrifying in their nature
---
sorry about the misunderstanding mate
---
takes me a month to get back at my normal rank
---
Nurses Calling
---
Unnatural determination: If you are forced to drop a down survivor you get a token. When you get stun 3 times. The next time you are force to drop the survivor. He or she will still be in the dying state
---
Overheat: Each time you hook a survivor you get a token, when you damage a generator, you spend a token and the generator is more susceptible to skill check that are more difficult. If they miss a skill check. The generator will regress more than normal and survivor cannot Interact with it for 15 seconds
---
True Savior: When a generator is finished, they survivor who repaired it will suffer from the exposed status
---
I'm still trying to tweak tem

Bamba... Lamba... Balam... Fool ‘em!

No no it’s all good! Implied thoughts or words are often missed because the internet is screwed uo

Entity: "I am displ- wait didn't I just send you out there?"
---
freddy lol
---
Certain characters yes. The tone is suppose to be satire
---
Perfection
---
Interesting build, will have to try. I've had a lot of success with ruin, sloppy butcher, thanataphobia and save the best til last. Legions power enables me to share the love to all survivors real fast. Ruin and thanataphobia slow gen repair, sloppy and thanataphobia slow heals, and save the best is at full stacks from 2 downs (2 power hits and 3rd hit down, not against obsession of course). As everyone remains injured the save the best makes delivering the finishing blow much easier.
---
What is the Devil version from?
---
Doctors extra shit to verse if killers connection sucks because all his extra killer ability animations make the lag even worse which usually helps them get ridiculous hits like the one in your post.
---
Ty my dude I have the habit of chasing for longer then 30 seconds gotta get out of the habit. May I ask if I have sloppy and nurses (i use spirit) and i hit them before 30 seconds should i leave them since they'll take longer to heal and I can find them with nurses or do I continue chase for another 30 seconds?
---
Great movie
---
You bring a valid point there, i guess ruin is the best choice for the slot overall
---
My point exactly.
---
However, even with your proposed change it would still benefit billy too much. Even if the chainsaw were to give a stack, Billy could still onehitdown you three times and you're still dead before the perk could come into playy
---
Spirit for perks easily
---
no u &lt;3
---
Yeah that's what i meant with double hit but I worded that pretty poorly I'll have to admit
---
that's exactly what I did, they kept triggering them tho XD
---
it isn’t toxic and only idiots think it is.
---
I gave him a thumbs up.
---
Makes me think that their power was original supposed to be impersonating survivors.
---
I agree with this. I wouldn't even look at Nurse until you have mastered the killer role and at least become decent with the majority of other killers in the game . Nurse not only has her own requirements but those also combined with other killers (knowing the map layouts, how to mindgame, counter loops and etc...)
---
The hooking exactly when the bell tolled.
---
Oh heck yes boutta get rewarded for not having time to play by being able to decimate new players
---
But no seriously I’m sorry in advanced if my lazy ass who isn’t that bad gets matched against you and you’re new, I apologize 
---
**please don’t kill me, I’m stupid. I can’t help it**
---
Honestly, I'd rather face Myers than that cat.
---
If you want a killer that has a high skill ceiling but is alot of fun to play with &amp; is very competitive then Spirit is your best bet.
---
Legion is decent &amp; his power is fun to use but overall his gameplay is very similar to any other R2 killer so I would only recommend purchasing him if you are interested in Discordance or you like his aesthetic. The fast running &amp; pallet vaulting is fun but outside of that, he plays like any other killer except that all the survivors are usually injured. 
---
Leatherface is amazing for perks as they are all good with the best being BBQ. That perk is amazing for farming bp to level up all your killers &amp; is generally a very useful perk. Knock out &amp; Franklins are more situational but still powerful in the right hands.
---
Pig has some good perks and is very versatile with a built-in survivor stalling ability &amp; stealth power that allows her to adapt to the situation. A mid-tier killer but most perks work well on her meaning she can be played around with when it comes to experimenting with perks.
---
If you are choosing between Legion or Spirit then I would suggest Spirit. Very rewarding killer with good perks. 
---
If you want to gain BP faster then consider getting Leatherface. As a killer he's relatively weak but BBQ is such a good killer perk.
---
Sounds like they’re goal was to be as toxic as possible. It’s whatever, just join another game.
---
*hissing intensifies*
---
Not really satire lol. Scary Movie is satire. Scream just manipulated people's expectations about horror movies and used that to it's advantage
---
Nah those aren’t out just yet, we’ve only gotten to test them *just a little bit* on the PTB.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuAf0X209kw
---
Here's the video if anyone wants to see it. It's about a minute long
---
Community needs a cleanse.
---
I was against a dude like this yesterday. It hurts my spirt
---
It's called a meme. Ever heard of it?
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPP?????????????????
---
I think people don’t like quentin because of the character model. He looks like a gargoyle and you can’t deny it.
---
Ugh. Why are people like this?
---
You clearly didn't read the post.
---
he did not mention the community at any time aside from mentioning they have requested fixes for certain problems.
---
Who hurt you
---
They both satire the Slasher genre. Scary Movie leans towards Parody. But Scream definitely has some on the nose shit talking about red herrings, horror tropes, etc etc. They were self aware
---
That’s literally what a meme is my dude
---
To be honest, its a game built on conflict, and it does what is set out to do. 
---
If it was a 5man coop, fix the gen game im sure people would be less salty, but its not.
---
Play the way you want to, hell if you want to play bubba, hook one guy and spend the next 120sec just staring at him while the 3 survivors do the 5 gens. Do it! after a few bad games i just turn off end game chat and face camp/mori toxic survivors. 
---
also as a killer main, whenever i play survivor i congradulate a killer when he plays well (yes even if i get killed/facecamped)
---
Its about doing what you want and sending out good vibes out there. No point being salty or toxic.
---
The most overpowered add-on is prayer beads.
---
It's ridiculous the killers that feel the need to do it.  EGC was implemented to prevent survivor BM not to create killer BM.  Killers should appreciate this fact and just accept their victory and hook their kill.  I don't want to be slugged 2 minutes just so some douche can watch an animation.  Show respect for your opponents.  I do on both sides of the game.  Pay it forward.
---
That’s how it is with pretty much every game now. *Everything* is somehow toxic. It’s toxic just to sign onto a game at this point.
---
That’s where the issue is, using a medkit functions like using a toolbox ( the same button ) which isn’t tied to the unhooking button. So if you was in fact NOT using self-care and you press the right button to unhook, then shouldn’t of been an issue
---
Hag looks like Monto
---
Why stop?
---
why do you care about your rank lmfao
---
no. hearthstone has a split between casual and comp, I've been playing casual for many years and now I just wish there haven't been the split in the first place.
---
I was also scared kinda when I started playing DBD and I saw no split, but, for real, the fact that it's not there makes new player's experience much better.
---
there's also no fear of playing comp because of that
---
He wanted to discuss problems. So I did.
---
please format your points &lt;3
---
I would like that but its success solely depends on the DBD community. So that makes me think if casual really will be casual and not full of tryhards, campers or anything of that sort.
---
Lazy, low effort memes, I imagine.
---
Hell yeah. A lake map, abandoned mall map, a cemetary, airplane port, some sort of Alice in wonderland gone dark map, a silent hill esque map, man I just want new scenery. I'm so bored of autohaven, that's almost exclusively what I get without using an offering cuz I have bad rng
---
The player base is far too small for a casual mode, the wait time is long enough as is, we don't need it longer.
---
in addition there is nothing stopping people playing casual like ranked.
---
It makes more sense to fix the current ranking system instead of making a new one.
---
0Ks, oh how I know thee
---
I mean, good idea, but let’s be real here. You want your rank to be as low as possible(at least for me, I’m a constant rank 1 with both killer and survivor) so of anything trying new things would be a good thing on normal gameplay, but I can see why people would want this
---
That makes thing a lot more clear. I thought you went into healing position instead of unhooking. Yeah that kinda sucks big time
---
I mean she’s the one who’s fucking up a whole bunch it’s her fault. They should probably switch to a faster killer to practice getting better at loops.
---
Take my oinkvote.
---
I don't think people understand that skins and dlc are what enables Behaviour to pay people to fix bugs in the first place. The whole idea people spout of "Skip one dlc to fix bugs!" is just not possible when they've balanced their books on x amount of people buying cosmetics and dlc every 3 months.
---
That’s not camping man. That’s literally playing the Hag. And it’s their fault for being dumb and playing like scrubs. Camping is sitting in the corner waiting for them to die on hook.
---
Thnx bro. Definitely gonna use that when in doubt NOED it out
---
No. They should just slowed down the timer if someone had a RBT on his head, not killed her end game potential. Now, she is just a slow Wraith with an second ability based on RNG. 
---
But she still is better than Freddy, Trapper, Cannibal, Legion, Clown or Doctor.
---
But you didn't?
---
you just said "HURR DUURRR COMMUNITY BAD" That's not discussing anything and also ironically proving your own point.
---
No more regular dudes in a mask.  I want original killers again.
---
it does work, the animation just doesn't match up to how it works, you need to hit spacebar as they're in front.  
---
The stun activates as you hit spacebar, but the animation doesn't always sync up, you just need to activate it as their in range
---
Spirit, shes fun a little harder to learn. But once you do you'll love her.
---
I just blare “Come and get your love” and reenact the opening scene from guardians of the galaxy.
---
I just beg for bbq on spirit. Ever since I got her to p3 I haven’t gotten it, even after over 70 bloodwebs
---
I don’t that’s for sure
---
I was trying not to camp, but they were teabagging and flashlight while in the basement
---
OP already has Leatherface you can barely see it cause he typed “lf”
---
No one
---
Thank you!!! I understand that but they barely did anything
---
Its hard to moonwalk since the update
---
Yeah if they’re all nearby you’re totally justified to stay nearby lol
---
this sucks as we already have a doctor and he already has a plague doctor locking skin
---
I don't think that's unreasonable
---
Despite what people say basement hooks before any gens are done are huge and I think it’s a good idea to protect them. But I try to be nice about it
---
The traps did need a change with the new End Game, but just have them slow the timer down would have worked
---
Not me.
---
Monto the hatch king, what a beautiful man always strivin with those toxic builds much love 💗
---
He already has him lol.. the Lf is for leather face
---
5Head
---
They could make a lot of new maps in a Dlc or just put new maps in the game, like classic horror maps or something.
---
well if you're lucky and it's a myers mori daily you could stay in T1
---
What the offering does is inscrease the proximity at which the hook cannot spawn around other hooks. There is an invisible circle around each hook. The offering increases that distance.
---
This also lowers the amount of hooks on the map, as only so many of them can "fit" outside of those zones.
---
thats not ghostface... thats shid ghostface
---
If it included the robes then sure
---
&gt;But it is ultra satisfying when you have an obsession that is ultra toxic and thinks you are a noob who does not know how the game works and t-bags/Points / Flashlight clicks and what not.
---
If they're not dumb they'll know what's up the moment 1 gen is finished since rancor shows you their aura
---
I'm a simple man. I see 4 items, I bring Franklin's. I see 4 Ash, I don't bring an m1.
---
I kind of like the emblem system on killers requiring you to interact with the survivors. For example, if the killer figures out a build or playstyle that mostly avoids chases and protecting gens, that's going to lead to an unfun game for the survivors (just holding M1 only to die suddenly with no chase). The emblem system encourages loosely pursuing your objective (kill all 4 survivors before they escape) with an emphasis on keeping things fun for the other team. Does it possibly need some balance changes? Yes. For example, it shouldn't punish you for being near the hook if you're in a chase. But I wouldn't want it to go away.
---
This fucker is going to be hard to see on those McMillan maps, so excited to use him
---
That’s not true. Once you take the hit and lose endurance your aura will be revealed when you heal back to healthy. Also you can’t regain any stacks, once you use it the perk deactivates.
---
i dont think the helmets are her appeal anyway. its the stealth and dash attack. i think shes even the only one with a horizontal slash? to get rid of that silly unrealistic way survivors dodge you.
---
It was probably bugged in that case
---
Yeah i noticed /: I play with guys who can moonwalk for 3 times as long as this and they've been having issues
---
I'm almost always the gen jocky, and was getting rounds where I made 4-8K. WOW, one or two brown add-ons. Glad to know why it's so low
---
Yes it’s real and had the same problem on PS4, found out Saturday after reading another post about this and was wondering why the low points then tested it. Completed a gen from start to finish and no points, so yah gen up till 99% let get to get your points and then gen tap the rest! Devs need to fix this ASAP but knowing them assholes it will be a few weeks because they are the slowest game developer to roll out major bug fixes!
---
I don't know wether to upvote it because people need to see this or downvote it because i hate what happened.
---
If you play on console just make a new account
---
This. I just switched from PS4 to PC because my PS4 shit the bed and playing against rank 20s when you've played for a while just isn't even a fair fight.
---
I get way more nice messages than bad ones. I'd say that for every nasty message I get, I get about 7 or 8 nice ones (I still have them all). Usually the bad messages are just ones saying I'm trash or something like that (which might be true). Never anything about the perks I choose, but I never run NOED, and I try to be as fair as I can be when I play.
---
I play on xbox, and my killer rank is usually 10 - 13, mostly cause I spend way more time playing survivor.
---
This would present multiple issues.
---
Many of the killers play out in the same way. If you are good with the pig then you will be good with the Legion &amp; vice versa. All killers have to deal with the same issues &amp; only a select few have a high learning curve, that being Hag, Nurse, Huntress &amp; Spirit.
---
If you made it so that each killer ranking would be different, then it would allow killers to go to rank 20 lobbies &amp; demolish low-level survivor teams with different killers. Killers wouldn't learn anything new about their power as they would not need to use it due to the low skill level survivors &amp; it would make low-level survivor lobbies hell.
---
The other issue is that it would make rank 1 lobbies become filled with killers that are easy to rank up with, namely the higher tier killers. There is already an ongoing issue of high ranking lobbies mainly consisting of Hillbillies &amp; nurses and this proposal would just make the issue more prominent. 
---
Rather its good to be able to practice with killers you have no experience with in higher ranking lobbies. It challenges you &amp; forces you to use your power. With nurse it allows you to practice blinking with high-level survivors juking your blinks. With Spirit it allows you to practice mind-gaming against competent survivors.
---
I can definitely see the purpose behind what you are suggesting. Providing killers a platform to practice instead of embarrassing themselves against a good survivor team but it would present more issues than it would fix. 
---
To be honest I feel that did should have an offline bot mode to practice. Can allow new killers or survivors to practice playing the game to make it a more enjoyable experience instead of ruining it for themselves by being destroyed by the other side before they can learn anything.
---
More like doing community service!
---
I like that this is pinned, without giving it a proper hotfix lol
---
The best thing killers can do is don’t play leathercock.
---
*looks over at CS and LoL*
---
You are a great example tbh.
---
It contains Pig so 2+ and 1- so upvote.
---
Spirit is a ton of fun, requires time to learn though.
---
Fixes take time, this post hasn’t even been up for a day.
---
I smell a new killer main for me lmfao
---
What's that? Like setting them free?
---
First time using no mither, and I won’t lie, I played so passively lol. I feel like it puts some of the spook factor back into the game :p I think in the future once I get good at the game again, I might run it more often for a bit of fun ;0
---
I love Del, but sadly only had 1 power play with it in the 3 games I played, other 2 I was first on hook :( lithe plus balance landing made it really easy to proc, but I won’t lie, I really wanted dead hard with no mither lol.
---
Overall, pretty fun
---
Survivors can use object, alert, kindred, dark sense, break down. Each side has perks to see the enemy. Survivors also have perks to see each other. How does this make killers op?
---
And I’d I’d love to hear which perks are equivalent to MOM
---
I think it would be nice for the people who want it, I don't think I would use it though.
---
Ya, I thought that the animation would be maybe a bit longer, locking you into it. The fact that hatch opens so slowly first of all, and then the killer having priority over your action when you jump in is such bull. I really hope they adjust it.
---
Püppy
---
I both like it and hate it. there's more arguments on the hate side tho :(
---
Was about to send you this with it being Laurie, then realised it was you😂
---
The easiest thing you can do as a killer is to simply close the chat box &amp; play however you feel like. It will make you much better at the game as you get to make tactical decisions without fear of survivor harassment &amp; it makes losing a game a lot less frustrating. 
---
You will also find a lot more enjoyment in the game as you will not have to deal with restrictions to avoid upsetting survivors.
---
This gave me anxiety.
---
EVERYONE UP VOTE THE ABOVE COMMENT
---
Save The Best For Last is really nice on Spirit. It allows you to get back in the chase faster since you have a faster cool down and is super useful when multiple survivors are in your path or someone tries a hook save right in front of you. Hit, recover quickly, hit again.
---
This is just the scp, and I got down voted for just asking if he would work.
---
“You should never say ‘who’s there?’ Don’t you watch scary movies? It’s a death wish. You might as well come out here to investigate a strange noise or something.”
---
Playing as Bubba
---
Why do you care what they think? If you are trying your best to not tunnel/camp etc who cares
---
play KYF
---
Thanks for giving it a shot!
---
Yes but you still haven’t explained how killers are op to solo survivors.
---
The thing is, killers aren’t op for solos, and yes SWF can be annoying but not every SWF is a group of insane survivors
---
The ancient knowledge of not lunging and just pressing m1 so you can't miss.
---
So lucky, as I speak this is the teachable on Michael's bw gonna get real fcking quick appreciate it man :)
---
wtflol
---
But how am I supposed to use a flashlight then ??? Flashlight saving is most of the time impossible
---
This is what it is, really. Nobody likes to lose, and there are a good number of people out there who aren't very accountable for their actions when things go wrong. It's often these people that'll be quick to send messages trying to make you feel bad for playing the way you did.
---
I have more fun playing this game when you ignore anything survivors have to say about how you play. You’re a killer your goal is not to coddle survivors. As long as it’s not straight up face camping if it’s in the game and it’s not exploiting a bug or glitch it’s fair game
---
What rank are you now? Because if you get better it won´t feel like try harding. But if you are a red rank I know it won´t get better. You have to give your best. Always.
---
Let's just say that they're the kind of people who only kill Claudette, Tapp and Adam...
---
Joking aside, I guess actually looking like a ghost is pretty cool as a killer, even if it puts you at a disadvantage on almost every map
---
I got called an asshole for playing Doctor the other day. Not for playing 3 gen Doctor or anything like that, I was just doing my daily to get some shocks. But I guess just playing as that character was rude of me :(
---
Well..I just told you why you shouldn't do that, but its your build so yeah.
---
Also Vanity Mirror sucks gorilla ass, I guarantee you will use it for 2 times and call it quits. Try it and see for yourself.
---
I’m not pretending to be smart dickhead. Your being a complete asshole who doesn’t understand how game development works. A prime example is the fact that you clearly have no fucking clue what a Quality Assurance department is.
---
Edit: By the way, you’re a complete hypocrite. Despite saying you don’t whine about new cosmetics, you sure do love to explain why the cosmetics are drawing resources away from game development.
---
You arent rank1 today, so whip out nurse and give her a shot. You might depip but oh well.. you got a whole month to get to rank 1 if that's what you want. It's not a race.
---
It's a game, dude. You're allowed to have fun
---
I’m currently killer rank 10 so I’m not that  high but I’ve come across 4 stacks with a rank 15, 12, 9 and 3 or similar ranks to that which is quite annoying.

He called you toxic for not letting him kill you... Ok

lmao it's just playing the video game you baby
---
He wants your sool O.O
---
Altruism vs Noed is suicide. Find totem first.
---
I understand this reference
---
Yeah... It did lol
---
I used to be a red rank killer but it was so annoying that I try to keep myself around rank 8. Now I´m 6 oops. There´s still challenge but I don´t have to try hard. I think you´ll be fine when you get comfortable with your killer (and get lucky with swfs)
---
A rank one becomes rank ten after reset, and a rank ten becomes rank fourteen. The discrepancy between ranks is much smaller since everyone kind of gets squished together - you’re more likely to see a rank ten and rank fourteen organically matched together than a rank one and a rank ten. So you’re more likely to have experienced players matched with/against inexperienced players. 
---
There’s also the issue of people hoarding their most powerful shit for rank reset so they can exploit the above for easy kills/escapes, which only makes the problem worse and more annoying.
---
When ghostface off a bean
---
That’s actually an awesome idea. It also ensures you get no “kill dudes” emblem points so you won’t shoot up the ranks.
---
If you care what people say on internet and especially in online games then you should probably not use it. Honestly it will only make you upset because people will talk shit no matter what you do.
---
Топ!
---
The way it works, is if you do a gen from 0%-100% with not interruptions, the points don't count. Basically, hold the repair button for a second or 2, let go, and you're good to do the generator normally
---
You can play however you like, but these on not good reasons IMO. I would understand playing in a way to make the game especially *fun* for the Survivors, but just playing to try and make them not complain or yell at you in post-game is not a good motivation. You don't **need** to baby them. The game is relatively balanced, and there is counter play to most things you can do as killer. By babying them like this, they will never learn how to play better. There's no reason to feel bad if you did well and they don't understand how to counter you. You also do not need to listen to their complaints, or even offer advice if you don't feel like it. Just type 'gg' and leave, or disable post-game chat.
---
Ah yes, I love the Hondo reference
---
My friend got stuck on that same map same hook. He unhooked then BAM! stuck most of the game. Eventually he managed to get out by healing me. I had to walk around the hook a bunch for him to get the heal prompt, but once he did he was free.
---
Yeah, fair point, I actually hadn’t considered that. I guess most people are so used to toxicity in this game that we assume it as the default.
---
"Ah, there's the hatch!"
---
Please leave my son alone, he is very sick.
---
Upvote 4 for a meme that brought me back memories of my daddy suddenly pulling me off a gen.
---
Phasing allows the survivors to not be able to time 360 jukes. If they cant see you they cant guess when to spin. It sounds useless but if you get the phasing up high enough it makes survivors a lot less evasive, and in some cases, they will juke themselves into a worse situation.
---
HATCH KING
---
And how is it cheap and why those survivors are shitty? Genuine question btw
---
Edit: I'm probably still a shitty survivor after 1.5 years of playing the game but killer still follows me if I just throw a pallet and run away (this statement is kinda sarcastic, yeah, but only just a lil bit)
---
This is how he should look in the game
---
they should just add a competitive and laidback section so you can play for fun or try hard
---
Killers can absolutely win in this game. If you walk away with a 4K and all 4 survivors crying in post-game chat, that's Bi-Winning.
---
You can drive Hag crazy with it. Or just go flash crows I dunno
---
P.S.: ofc Hag will call you thaxic
---
***We*** are inevitable
---
Hmm I  see. Pig nerfs do not help either. I wish you all the best finding the best build and strategy that will get you W´s. 
---
I play Trapper (Hex: Ruin, BBQ, Enduring and spirit fury)
---
and Spirit (Hex:Ruin, BBQ, Nurse´s calling and sloppy butcher)
---
Ruin is very nice but I like to practise by playing with 3 perks only haha ;) you should get it/use it. I don´t own the pig so I cannot give you any tips sorry :/
---
they said that on PTB they were just testing the infrastructure, that it was very bare bones, and as a result would not be very stable.
---
so PTB dedicated servers *shouldn't* be an accurate representation of how stable the connection is when they come out for real
---
That's a fancy coffee machine (from Gideon coffee plant)
---
. You have to use it to wake up.
---
Well there could also be a cool down time and again, this would still be situational.. if the killer knows about this perk, they can adapt and leave the area. Maybe the survivor has to heal another survivor a full heal state before the perk activates. There are ways for it not to be broken.
---
Looks fake as shit.
---
On topic: if they're planning to give away existing cosmetics with the pass then it might not be that bad. I think this is just a beta concept though.
---
i always run small game to avoid noed
---
Those keys are why you don’t fucking doubt the power of plunderers and up the ante combined
---
No doubt. I've had a few in the same game before and it kills so much momentum
---
Were you playing against a billy by any chance? Lol
---
Monto and Puppers are awesome! :) love their content.
---
MoM is the worst designed perk in the game right now. The second being NOED.
---
Outskilled eZ
---
Spine Chill
---
edit: Omg it's my first silver. Thank you &lt;3
---
Yup basically the Killer experience. Reminder if you literally touch your keyboard you're a tunneling camper sweaty tryhard, but if you don't do anything then you're an AFK troll who should be reported.
---
Looks fake. I’m unsure about the cosmetics, I don’t think it’s a good move for the devs to put existing cosmetics in the season pass, but maybe they’re just placeholders.
---
That’s true, I feel base perks are overlooked a lot
---
&gt;Been suggested a billion times and I still don't know why it isn't in the game.
---
Someone told me gen rushing is toxic, who knew doing the only objective in the game is toxic af my bad
---
I'm skeptical it's from the dev build, because if it is wouldn't we have seen it already? Why is it just popping up now?
---
Why do your perks look so autistic? What's the point of it?
---
myers when he activates EW3
---
 Boil Over
---
For real! It’s not terrible. At the very least it’s fun to use on maps like the hospital. And some killers will walk right past a hook because they can’t see auras close by- I do hope they buff the range at least, someday.
---
It’s cool. I need spirit fury on the pig. I’ve got enduring rn But pallet loops are hell to deal with rn. I’m sure that if I practice mind gaming with her ambush attack I’ll be able to counter pallets more effectively.
---
ever see see her short hair skin on the regular body? looks like she just hopped out of the shower and is chasing the survivors because they stole her towel.
---
I haven't played much last and I entered shop while checking on something, so I remembered that Shrine is probably refreshed and what was there? Monitor &amp; Abuse! I'm so glad I didn't miss it...
---
Who's, Puppers?
---
This is why my personal take on this idea has always been to have a "general" Killer rank and a "Killer-specific" rank. So if you play as a Rank 20 Nurse but are a Rank 1 Killer you'll average out to Rank 10.
---
This would mean that if you won a bunch of games with a Killer you're experienced with then you'd still be able to play with a Killer you're inexperienced with at a semi-low rank, but likewise if you lost a bunch of matches you couldn't just swap to your best Killer and stomp helpless noobs.
---
Again, I listed the perks that killers have that allow them to see survivors which are OP for a solo player ... they are there to counter SWF play. No further explanation is needed.  It’s literally self explanatory if you understand how SWF works: maybe you don’t and I should explain it? 
---
Regardless, a perk like barbecue and chili 🌶 works two ways. It allows the killer to know the exact location of other survivors and if they don’t see them ... they know they are close to the hook and will camp it. That is by far the most OP perk either side can have. 
---
I’ll concede that MOM is an OP perk ... especially at the end game. However, it was created to help balance the other side. It will probably get nerfed and people will get upset over it and players will not bother to use it anymore.  Which defeats the purpose of even adding it. Rinse and repeat. 
---
While I agree that not every SWF group is toxic, there is enough of a ratio to make it a problem for the game. Otherwise we would not be having this conversation each and every time a balance is applied that favors one side. 
---
As I also said in another thread, it is common to have solo, duos and quads in multiplayer games these days. They need to do away with 3 player SWF completely. They Only downside to SWF is they would not be able to get away with their bullshit anymore and believe me, we don’t care 🤷‍♀️.
---
I personally love Detective's Huntch.
---
Eng dame Pig doesn't exist anymore. Also Pig is bad.
---
I, too, like the change as survivor. The old hatch standoff was too survivor sided and led to boring scenarios that can last a long time. These changes puts the control back into the killer's hands and forces the survivor to make some heart-pounding decisions. It's exciting, it's fun, and it's not always supposed to be about the survivor escaping. Survivors shouldn't be rewarded a free escape if all 3 teammates die.
---
I actually hot him top P3 so I could main him and cover up his fucked up face with the blood but you know how most killers are, the sight of a P3 makes the bring a mori or tunnel you.
---

---
You didn't have to delete your message. I was reading this thread last night and enjoyed the video. I agreed with your logic. Just that you got downvotes to hell for no reason.
---
Spirit for not only better perks, but the 3rd best killer in the game.
---
I'm gonna speed this match up *just a lil bit*
---
BBQ is not op, that is a large exaggeration and being able to see survivor auras is not op
---
He's pretty funny, he's got a YouTube channel.
---
Definitely fake. Even if it was real the fact that season pass holders get more BP and Shards is P2W, even if it is a minor boost. You can buy perks and characters with shards and the problem with getting extra BP is obvious.
---
Pick your poison: losing your Ultra Rare addons / offerings because some guy's goat ate his internet cable or having to wait a little longer to find a match. I honestly prefer the latter.
---
With Endgame the nerf was necessary, but the issue is that Pig was already lackluster and the nerf removed the only strength of an already weak Killer.
---
Looks to me like a survivor main trying to finish the Huntress hatchet ritual.
---
She's very fun, but you might want to check out some youtubers or guides to get some tips on how to mindgame survivors. Fooling survivors is so satisfying &lt;3
---
That makes sense actually, I didn't put that together though lol
---
Woooo thank goodness I don’t have to be bored and suffer with the poor people complaining about battle passes and season passes
---
This will actually make the game more fun and worth playing
---
Any perk that allows for the killer to see you is OP. It’s either a counter to SWF or to help shitty players ... which one are you?
---
Legion is pretty bad currently but they can be fun. Spirit has good perks and is very strong but can be tough to play.
---
Then they need to make the games go slower. The killers job, in order to pip, is to do what the emblems say to do. By doing those things, and by the survivors doing theirs, both teams will have plenty of interaction time and plenty of opportunities to change the outcome of the game. The survivors can make boring games too, this is usually called "genrushing." If they constantly evade the killer and manage to do the gens and leave with little killer interaction, they are not going to get their emblems either.
---
Oh shit... yeah... I forgot they nerfed her. ;/
---
F
---
3-Hook everyone gets you 8400/8000, IIRC, for 700 each hook action (2100 per survivor.)
---
Otherwise, 2-Hook into Mori gets you 2400 per survivor killed this way.
---
Can't be in EGC, though, because that lowers the amount of BP you get per hook I think?
---
Totally agree. There was one match I played against a hag and she had hooked someone right next to the totem and was camping him. What did the survivor say post game chat you might ask?... “why didn’t you come save me you fucking asshole??? You’re a little bitch. Fucking scaredy cat” Like dude yeah let me go run over there real quick and get smacked down with noed. Then we both get to die! I swear some people who play this game are actually fucking stupid.
---
Calm spirit
---
How could I forget
---
I LOVE THAT PERK, though it hates me I’m level 50 without it (level 54 technically) 😐
---
Yes (today).
---
Let's hope so.
---
Oof
---
Obviously. It even said so on the screen where it showed you your new rank.
---
It doesn’t have to require collaboration. It just requires experience with the game. There are still survivors who will walk up to and start repairing the same generator when the Legion is the killer.  Anyone that understands the game knows he will see that and come right over. It happens every match with him. 
---
If you’re in a match where NOED was played and didn’t trigger, it’s because people like me have had that happen enough to make sure we do our part to prevent it from happening again.
---
Looks like a new Meg skin to me.
---
Noob3?
---
They’ve been trying different communication avenues!
---
The OG stealth killer
---
Seems legit.
---
Anyway, if this is real, the gates can only be opened when powered
---
Lmao
---
No0b3 &gt; Monto
---
Thoughts?
---
I love the 1st film to pieces.
---
He's a solid mid-tier killer with a lot of fun build potential i.e. tombstone, jumpscare, slugging with Infectious Fright, etc.
---
Wow cool.
---
I called a clown out on facecamping someone for no reason and then he sPoiLed endGaMe.
---
It's not "one side is just holy players trying to live their live and the other is icky survivor mains."
---
There are just angry people who play this game.
---
Meh that’s why I camp everyone :)
---
Does this sub really not like him? He’s my favorite DBD streamer/YouTuber.
---
I do too, but I always seem to get 3/4 totems and NOED still pops sometimes
---
#Killer
---
* **Play With Your Food** - I will admit it's bad, but on a handful of Killers it can be insanely good. Try it out on Plague it's goddamn insane on her.
---
* **Iron Maiden** - Again only good on a handful of Killers but Survivors never expect it, and it can get you some really crazy free downs as a result.
---
* **Fire Up** - Serious moments jokes aside: the faster pickup speed can fuck up so many flashlight blinds. I'd never use it over Brutal Strength or Bamboozle, but combined with one of those perks this perk is honestly insane.
---
* **Knock Out** - On to the actually underrated perks: Knock Out can make it so much harder for Survivors to tell where you are, and can slow down a lot of altruistic players. (Borrowed Time saves, Flashlight users, bodyblockers, etc.) It also gives you constant access to effective slugging, which can be extremely useful in certain situations.
---
* **Thrill of the Hunt** - Most people just look at this perk as a meme that's only used for protecting your other Hexes. Honestly this perk is insanely strong for stalling the game. Survivors automatically assume you have NOED or something if using it alone and (if you protect the actual totem) this perk can really slow the game down while also giving you a good boost to your Bloodpoints.
---
#Survivor
---
* **Tenacity** - I actually think this perk is the best anti-slug perk for the average game. It lets you hide from the Killer and get closer to your allies while also recovering. It has zero clutch potential unlike Flip-Flop and Unbreakable but outside of a pure slug game it lets you get away and get up faster.
---
* **Breakdown** - A great counter to camping/tunneling and also a good tracking perk. Can be very effective for planning your escapes from dangerous hooks.
---
* **Leader** - This basically gives every Survivor that heals you (or heals near/with you) Botany Knowledge. The cleansing speed and gate opening speed are also both insanely helpful.
---
* **Quick and Quiet** - Mostly vouching for a friend here as it's his favorite perk but I've seen some amazing shit with this perk. It can let you get away with some crazy shit, but even in an average game vaulting a window silently can confuse the Killer and buy you a few more seconds.
---
* **Stakeout** - I'd never forgive myself if I didn't sing Stakeout's praises. You get a free Great skill check for spending 15 seconds in the Killer's Terror Radius. A great skill check grants about 3 seconds of faster progress. This means that you have about a 5:1 ratio of progress gained from time spent in the Killer's terror radius. It is an amazing perk for stealthy play that can greatly speed up the game.
---
you have my oink &lt;3

Every 13th of the month

Tenacity.

Can't say how many times I got away from the killer that way. You might ask how...well, at lower ranks, killers tend to let you down and go for another survivor in the meantime.
---
I think it's a big middle finger to final survivors. If you're the last one standing, you might as well just run to the killer for a quick death. The killer will just chase you until the time runs out. Five games in a row I ran into this problem; all the killer had to do was run between the two doors. The second you touch the door, the killer can tell by looking at it and will know you're nearby. Unless you have a key and magically find the hatch, just kill yourself. No point.
---
what does it even accomplish? they fixed DS to activate before the pickup animation completes now so it wouldn't help like it used to. is there some other reason?
---
He’s certainly one of the more... diverse people. Some really like him, some... not so much.
---
Whats the joke?
---
And you have mine &lt;3  oink oink
---
I W A N T S H I R T L E S S F R E D D Y.
---
I never got a message
---
They should remove the grey stripe and just make this the base outfit. Of course they should keep the original knife.
---
There’s a chart that shows the specific de-rank per rank in the internet
---
it increases the amount of hooks
---
Thank you man!
---
Ohh I didn’t know. I’ll look it up. Thanks!
---
Meyers
---
Well if I was that killer I wouldn't have called you toxic but I would have camped you. 4 gens done and you being my only hook means the game is over for me so now I gotta secure this kill. Though I'd never really be in that situation because I have enough sense to realize early on if a chase is worth it or not.
---
Have you ever visited the steam dbd forums? It's filled with killers like the one that camped you and it amazes me that these people can't sit back for a moment and look at how they play and realize that that is their issue.
---
The main problem is battle passes are for a limited time before being locked away forever.
---
They're BHVR, they can LITERALLY fuck up ANYTHING. It's like a Corrupt a Wish forum over there.
---
Make graphics better? Sure, also only 1 door spawns now.
---
Buff Deja Vu? Sure, also killers move at the survivors speed now.
---
Have an event? Sure, also survivors can't work on gens, and killers can't hook survivors.
---
Sorry for late reply but I feel it. I love her so much!
---
Dark sense
---
And I would of understood that 100 percent my points were maxed out from chasing and all that so I was happy but it’s the fact after the game he had to call me toxic and this is why he doesn’t play the game I honestly didn’t know what to say
---
Slap on Ace in the Hole and prepare to nut when you see a med-kit with a insta heal; It's so nice when there are days where I just want to item grind.
---
All of them likely weren't 8-3, you probably had a single player that was rank 10-12 or lower and the rest were purples and reds. They're exploiting the matchmaking system like every tryhard SWF team does. You can't open a gate till the gates are powered. When playing against a flash-saver, either face a wall when picking up, or if you can't do that, just slug them and find the flashlight-user nearby and chase them.
---
Downvote button is not a "disagree" butron
---
Ghostface. Not everyone knows.
---
*Evil Within leveling up sound*
---
Quick and quiet is one of my top 3 favorite perks. I don’t think it’s the greatest,  but can make for some nice plays
---
Don't be a cunt, he/she is using different perk themes to make it look more pretty.
---
Yeah the nasty and salty messages were annoying until I did this earlier this year now I get friend requests from players regularly which I of course ignore
---
Just ignore the scumbags, they are everywhere and I’ve had killers and survivors message me with stupid shit and I ignore it. Had one from Saturday message me and state he reported me for working with a survivor and that I was a trash killer with no skill. 
---
I don’t camp and I don’t tunnel, it was 3 rank 7 survivors and a random rank 18 and I knew he was a low rank because he was having a hard time moving about the map and other things and the other 3 were flashlight galore with teabags at every pallet. Well Michael went about the game hooking everyone twice and I treated all of them equally, the rank 18 got knocked down multiple times and would have gotten the 3rd hook but the 3man SWF kept flashlight saving him. So after the 5th time I dropped the rank 18 and went after them, by this point They only got 2 gens done and I’m not sure why we were 15mins into the game and ruin broke first minute of the game. I killed the 3 rank 7s and my bbq showed me where the rank 18 was at, I downed him and took him to the hatch and let him go. Then I start getting messages. So fuckem they can go suck and cry on mommy’s tit for all I care.
---
Ah I didn't know that. I've only ever played dbd on pc. How does that combo work for you on console? I'd assume because it's not meta for console that you manage to get quite a few 4ks because of the surprise factor.
---
i dress in a pink shirt to flex on p3 claudettes
---
Someone photoshopped Pig cradling a tiny Ghostface in her arms with Myers' arm around her shoulder, it was awesome. I can't seem to find it though.
---
but why don’t you like Janes?
---
What about Jane and Ash?
---
Game mechanic devs placed in is “toxic”
---
This guy is a regular troll lol, just ignore them. I mean, it *does* give a message, but there was no reason for him to be mad that you didn't read it.
---
No it’s fake
---
I get my kills pretty often then
---
What about Overheat:
---
The most recently completed generator will Overheat and need to be repaired again after 5/4/3 min.
---
This only applies to the last generator completed and the timer is reset when a new generator is completed
---
I play killer the way I'd expect a killer to play against me. That's all you can do.
---
I just love this conversation you both are having
---
Having a Killer with a power like that in the game would be so cool yet so hard to be actually used...
---
Spirit the second best killer on console, right behind billy, and has good perks, so it’s prob worth getting her for that reason. 
---
Lots of ppl seem to love Legion, so that’s always an option too, depends on what you wants
---
Sad times
---
Then what’s the point? He doesn’t have a Legion mask
---
That actually makes a lot of sense holy shit
---
Why don’t people like Claudette 
---
Sometimes when I play her, for no reason I’ll be the only one to get tunnelled and then camped at hook with the killer smacking me over and over and nodding LOL
---
Either try a bit harder to get to 8 or derank yourself to 13.   10 is where the Troll with Friends love top play.  Red ranks bring their smurf rank 15 (or lower) friends to bully killers.
---
Nothing, just for fun :)
---
Yeah it works out pretty well on console. I mean it even works with my nurse😂😂. People drop pallets pretty quickly on console anyway cause they get scared sometimes compared to those I played against on pc. I don’t typically mention PS4 and Xbox as the same cause ps4 Dbd is a third world country tho.
---
r/ouijabydaylight
---
I know, right? So wholesome.
---
I was rank 1 before, and I'm sitting at around rank 8. That said I'm not playing anywhere near as much and when I do it's stuff I enjoy, I'm not actively trying to pip or anything. If I'm not busting my ass to try for perfect sweaty games it just seems random if I pip or not really.
---
Forgot no phasing sound Spirit.
---
i just like reloading at light speed
---
Its also only for the Lincesd DLC killers, so Pig, Myers, Freddy and LF. 
---
MAYBE Ghostface in the future.
---
I like this, but there is an issue. If you are a rank 1 m1 killer, but want to play nurse you will suck. However you have enough game knowledge to maybe be too good for the low ranks. I would not mind this system if all killers ranked up together slightly. If you get to rank 1 with one killer, the rest of the killer may rank up to about 11 or so. Get 2 and you reach 10? 9? and so on. It helps you skip some of the early easy ranks, but not put you up to far into the difficult ranks. Allowing you to learn and practice other killers, while not bullying noobie survivors.
---
Played a Game as meg with a Michael. I do 3 gens with a Dwight.  That same dwight gets hooked as doors power up. Endgame starts. Save dwight. Michael comes back. Run. Get moried as everyone else escapes. Feelsbadman :(
---
Yeah, and I don't understand. Why does Kate still have blood on her arms then? She basically wears the same top. They should honestly revert the change for Nea, it looks stupid.
---
You get the cap, emotes, and linkage.
---
haha i got geistra's perk pack and i already hate it, i just want the old pink perks
---
don’t get me wrong, Fred’s powerful alright, but not nearly as much as the Entity, Pennywise, etc.  In the long run he’s similar to Michael, Jason, all of them.  What makes him different is you will no doubt run into him eventually, and unfortunately for you...
---
You will never escape without help.
---
It started out as him not understanding WHAT OP is taking about but turnt into a friendly talk bw what seems like friends, rare for this sub!
---
She still has good mid game pressure and has her ambush mindgames. She's weaker but not to the extent of being bad.
---
Jane is the Claudette in "Don't Like" tier but Jane wasn't available. I forgot about Ash lol. He is ok for me.
---
Yup lol just looks cool. Not easy to do, especially on console. Just a lil flex pretty much
---
Nope. Ash, Nea and Jake. Sometimes Kate. Also play killer just as much as survivor. Do you put on a Nea suit with fur? Asking for a friend.
---
Took me so fucking long to figure that one out. And apparently the same for everyone else too.
---
I know but I suck at juking so it's literally my only lifeline 😂
---
I don't like the way she looks that much as controversial as that sounds.
---
I thought they changed that to do something else
---
Naw, gens fly by fast enough as it is. An instant 25% should keep it as-is, just so you don't see it every other game
---
Yeah! there it haspro and cons's.
---
Another thing that you are gonna miss with the message blocking is Farm requests.
---
Aaah.. Welp seems like you're better than me for tracking haha I need nurses as even if I have headphones on, I can't find them quickly and I am shit at following sounds, but I usually run maiden time to time if I am goofing off!
---
This bug has been active since the last patch. Are you guys aware of how much bps survivors are missing out on now along with pips? Even when you know this bug exists, it’s so easy to forget to get off a gen a second before it pops. 
---
There has to be some sort of compensation for this.
---
EGC increase the points.
---
I wonder how many of the people pretending that Ghostface has an interesting game design and mechanics are actually gonna play him.
---
You made me feel bad for upvoting you lol
---
Can you explain to me why someone would download this. Is there a real usage to it or do people just really think it looks better?
---
Flashlights trigger my rage 🔪
---
Played Bloody Coil Traper for the first time last night. So much fun. Can't believe I've never really played Trapper before. Super fun and a bit underrated imo. The games seem to go slower when I use Trapper than they do when I use Clown and Freddy.
---
You created this, so now I also love you. Nohomo
---
I honestly wouldn't call that pretty
---
Alright Ive seen enough.
---
Me neither lmao but everyone has their preferences.
---
Teach me your ways!
---
freddy’s lunge really be on that bullshit
---
Yes it does
---
I love u too for loving amanda. Nobi
---
Yeah hows that pig update working for yeah. Noed is hardly a crutch if it never comes into play when I use it. Guess you didnt bother to read the post before it. How people bitch about it when they dont even get to endgame. 
---
Ive faced the depip squad from marth33 since hes in my region and rank they can get to endgame before a killers 2nd hook verses nurse, billys and huntresses at rank 1. And they dont even bring in items or perks throw half decent toolboxs on them and lets check the pressure. 
---
Vrs actual gen rushers the ones that can get 5gens in 5-7mins you cant do a damn thing as killer. No killer is designed to fight that. Especially if you play fair dont camp or tunnel. 
---
Face marth33 then come back and preach how good you are with map pressure.
---
Get out
---
So...what if you got to rank one say using...Doctor. Your suddnely goin to be good enough to be a rank 1 using something like Nurse or Spirt who are much harder  to play?
---
Have you ever tried it as Wraith with the 2 Shadow Dance Add ons with Iron Maiden? By the time you finish the animation it takes like 3 seconds for the doors to shut.
---
Ouch.
---
I disagree, being able to reload at half the normal time is good. At least IMO.
---
No worries man, no hate against you, I think it’s a really cool combo, but not consistent enough. I made a thread the other day about trying any build ppl recommends me, and one was lith, dance, quick and quiet, and lightweight, but didn’t get it off in the 3 games I played haha. I prob just suck with the combo tbh
---
I did that once and they had adrenaline so I had to chase them lol
---
Yo any legion mains can help me out here?
---
I just bought legion and need help in what builds I should use on him, there are not really some good guide videos after post ptb so if yall are playing him, what are some good perks and addons for him?
---
Thanks!
---
thats the best killer fuck myers or leatherface... Noggin rules!!
---
Yeah I noticed he was one of those weird wanna be troll kids. Oh well what can you do 😊
---
My issue is at higher ranks, if you dont have alot of bloodpoints, you also wont have as many perks to use to practice with.
---
Fam... Unrelenting? On piggy ouch that hurts
---
Supernatural instinct sounds good, hidden presence is fair, but probably not meta, and the obsession one is confusing
---
I have no idea, i have Legacy Nea to boot and they removed the effects off her arms and chest aswell making it look basically unrecognisable that you have legacy.
---
We are on reddit here did you forget? You disagree with me you get a downvote ;)
---
That's a no from me, dawg.
---
Thats store brand ghostface
---
Once you know killer has Spirit Fury the best thing to do is probably to always try to throw a pallet a bit early. Some killers who have Spirit Fury fully charged will even try to avoid breaking a pallet and waste their time as a result
---
Blow it out your ass, I know that’s rude but this is painfully fake, and the community has already expressed its hatred for a battle pass. So, like the devs listen, they wouldn’t add it.
---
Oh shit congrats. I like Spine Chill too
---
Didn't they say they fixed it in the past? 
---
I always have it happen to me for Survivor..but for some reason it NEVER happens as a killer..like what the fuck.
---
The rank system is absolutely terrible so there is no need to be disheartened, we all suffer together.
---
The only solution is try and get points in all categories as much as you can and pray.
---
I'd let the huntress chop me up with a axe
---
Holy shit, found a new thing to say in response to angry messages.
---
The worst SWF squads tend to manipulate rank to hang in the green ranks. It gets better once you get out of there. I've started taking screenshots of the perk loadouts in these types of games and post them to the balance feedback section of the official forum.
---
People leave games because they aren't enjoying the experience because both sides have their share of unfun bullshit. Adding a paid Battlepass like some free2play game isn't going to put a bandaid on that problem, it's just going to make people more salty as they grind through unfun games to get that all black Claudette skin at level 200 because they paid for the Battlepass priveledge just to get that 1 skin.
---
Sounds like ghost face.
---
I hate mettle of man and people taking about its okay and it needs "3 hits" is enough for its justification is.... Infuriating
---
I like how silly you look right now lol
---
A little killer like the leprechaun or Chucky would be a great addition to the game.
---
If BHVR wants to model Dead by Daylight after a free2play game, perhaps they should stop charging for the base game and DLCs.
---
Basically for every hook the obsessions sacrifice progress is reduced by a given amount so at tier one five stacks means the obsessions first hook will be directly to the struggle and death if you max out the perk but it requires you to ignore the obsession completely
---
If that helps at all
---
The way the line was delivered I thought he was lying or messing with sid
---
Lol. I spent 15 minutes googling before I replied to your comment.
---
Killer:
---
* Surveillance - I still see posts on here bashing it. It's a great perk that lets you know if someone is still in area if they hopped right back on gen or let you know where survivors are long after you regressed it.
---
Survivor:
---
* Spine Chill - It gets a bad rep because it's considered immersed but their are more times than I can count where it's let me get a gen done (into adrenaline) in front of killer or open door fast enough to escape (I still miss the vault speed paired with Resilience before the nerf). I've kinda moved on to Wake Up and Plunderer's Instinct in the Endgame Collapse meta though
---
I doubt it's a nerf. Probably just another unintentional bug like always.
---
Killers have it so easy 😭
---
It's more like
---
"What?! You're back already?! That trial started, like, 20 seconds ago? Get back to your farm, Hillbilly. No moonshine for you tonight"
---
EGC makes finding it pointless though since you only have 2 mins to find the totem, pull survivor from hook AND escape safely.
---
Honestly, I get the EGC helping killers with toxicity but now, the late game suffers for it. 
---
If I see a hooked survivor get insta downed and I'm not in a SWF game, I'm leaving. Simple as that. Not cause I don't want to save but because it's pointless now at this point in the game. Thanks EGC. 👏👏
---
Can you post me a link to your thread?
---
I swear everytime I run the perk I always get interrupted off the gens.
---
Yeah
---
I could see it working with other perks
---
Pig=Pig
---
Edit: idk wtf I said that
---
Freddy just on that bullshit
---
That's not true, I personally have ones for doctor and hag as well as other non licenses.
---
I'd put it at the first guaranteed skill check like overcharged.
---
Are those Brendan Frazier's eyes...?
---
Out of all the survivors I’ve played as, Claudette is a sure fire way to get tunneled the entire match. I stopped playing as her once I unlocked her perks.
---
I'll play him just for the butt dancing.
---
Thats... incredibly stupid
---
I think they should make it that traps are inactive if you put them on after EG started, but the start of EG makes already installed inactive traps to be active
---
*Crickets*
---
Were there multiple killers?
---
I mean, there's also literally millions less people playing DbD lol
---
No, everyone disconnected apart from 1
---
They say mettle of man is okay and balanced , people who main m1 killers like me suffer the most, there was literally no need for that perk, no need
---
Decisive is good and I honestly love it as it punishes killer for tunneling you off the hook, but what did the killer do wrong that he has to hit you 4 times to down you?
---
MOM needs to be changed.
---
I had someone send me a message telling me to kill myself and that I should delete the game jst cause I wouldn't save them when the guy was clearly getting camped by leatherface in the basement .
---
There is one glaring issue with the pricing of items in the store the primary problem for me is a cosmetic for Adam - look at his headgear for his 80's outfit it is 400 auric cells for about an inch of hair.
---
why.
---
also happy Cake day!
---
Same for me. I’ve P3’d the four survivors I like the best, and have access to every perk, so I play very casually now because BP’s don’t mean anything to me. It’s a great surprise and makes me laugh when a killer jokes around with me. My favorites are them stopping and staring when they know I jumped in a locker, or staring/nodding at each other when one of us messes up during a chase. I live for those moments, but sadly only encounter them like once in a hundred games. A lot of times I just let them hook me at the end if it was a fun game. 
---
I understand people who want to do well, but I still think you should have some fun if/when the opportunity arises. Rather than being a stone-faced terminator programmed to kill at all costs.
---
DbD subreddit karma farming. I'm not surprised by any shitposts I see on this sub anymore
---
Legion Legion gang where you at
---
I love you for this.
---
Here
---
Trying? those addons are very rare
---
HOLY SHIT JULIE CALM DOWN NO NEED FOR THE INSTANT REPLY
---
yes the gens need to be done. The idea is if there are dead surviovrs, or one is hooked and downed, or they are just disrupted in some way, you can catch them off guard and force them to make their move.
---
I used to be a Legion Main but then I stared playing other Killers.  Then I got this back from this person threatening to get me banned for something that I didn’t do.
---
what do you think
---
Quentin is bae, can’t wait for him to get cosmetics. Ps. His face close-up while on the hook is priceless
---
No, it's Iron grasp
---
Yeah... everyone got hooked three times. Just the way it played out it seems like I hooked someone like every thirty seconds
---
That makes sense also idk wtf he was on about just ignore him for the most part
---
I hope you reported them. Can you imagine being so mad over a video game that you take time out of your day to harass people? I can understand maybe a little shit talking here or there but some people need professional help.
---
I love you for loving me for loving you for loving Amanda. Nostraight.
---
Yes two of the sacs were during EGC
---
I verse so many insta saw Billy's its ridiculous. Legit I know out of 10 matches of survior I will face 6 Billys with insta saw addons that will wreck the shit outta me.
---
Right, but that means nothing, I’d count the current players online, the max. And, not to mention, this is the largest place for the devs to get feedback.
---
Don’t we all?
---
So basically Pig can force you to wait 2-3 minutes chasing you making sure you don't do a box?  I'm guessing you've never considered what it would be like.
---
To ebony? Yeah maybe but not to cypress or the green one as it's 16 try hard perks vs 1 killer.
---
Using them at pallets isis a most always a bad play. A good killer will just listen to where you run and all you've done is waste time you could have gained ground.
---
The killer seems kinda meh but the perks from both the killer and the survivor seem pretty good, The perk that puts totems in chests seems like the type of buff that hexes need.
---
like I said, not everyone is ready to overcome the need for crutches :D
---
Why does everyone who meets a troll post on here for validation? No, playing the game doesn't make you a jerk. Some people just like to troll. This should not be news to anyone.
---
Haha yeah, that one has always felt like a slap to the face. And thanks!
---
I imagine that "Entity Displeased" is more "Entity Disappointed." They set up the hooks, made sure everything was nice, put all the pieces in order and then nobody enjoys their hard work. Not even a card. Not even a "Thanks Entity, the rancid abattoir looks really nice today."
---
No. 
---
Fuck the survivors, Billy was just trying to be a good kid.
---
I hope you reported them. Uncalled for.
---
Why is this getting down voted when it's true? Here take my up vote. How dare you make sense sir.
---
Vaping while using a facecam makes that a no-go for me.
---
Sounds like a mashup of ruin and pgtw
---
Say it back!
---
I think they only changed that if someone disconnects *before* the match has started?
---
Feral baby gamg
---
I know. Vanity Mirror is shit. So shit. If it didn't slow him down for Christ's sake then it wouldn't be so shit.
---
5Head 🍷 any moxxers?
---
I meant to say it was before. Even the other guy was confused.
---
Was he lagswitching? Didn't seem like an actual lagswitch (no severe rubberbanding) but what was with the hitboxes?
---
feral babies rise up ✊
---
\*cough\* get a pc \*cough\*
---
Yeah, in that situation it shouldn’t happen. That’s super weird :0
---
Killer from Jeepers Creepers would be cool. Imagine a semi aerial killer.
---
As long as it doesn't trigger you can hold it forever.
---
I recommend using a medkit or if you don't have too many items, self-care, along with Mettle.
---
Mettle doesn't grant charges for power-related hits. So pig's ambush, chainsaws, hatchets &amp; traps won't give charges.
---
no crutch for you ya baby back bitch :D
---
Fair enough. I'll take my words back.
---
Taunting and using a flashlight for it's intended purpose = BM apparently.
---
He's definitely better than Clown, Leatherface, and Pig. Trapper and Wraith, maybe. I tend to rate Trapper higher than most though.
---
👏👏👏way to assume ya dbag.. you obviously cant read...  my point is closing that hatch takes no time and it doesnt have to be at a certain angle just any angle. But takes forever to open.. secondly I had a key and I couldnt open it because of the way the lock was positioned towards the row of cars... READING comprehension is KEY!!
---
The devs are already aware of the hate for claudette skins which is why they aren’t making more
---
Once again, shalom.
---
An no gens were done in that time frame
---
I was trying to reopen it and I couldn't. So??
---
It's just the timing and placement. Aim at the upper neck, not the face.
---
I think that’s the whole point of having to get it off. When I’m opening the gate I don’t finish if someone is on the hook, down or wearing a trap. I try to leave it as close to the end as possible without triggering it. However and without fail someone else opens the other gate regardless and ends up fucking over the injured survivor. 
---
Personally, I see the trap as a waste of time for most pig killers. They almost always camp the hook and will tunnel the person wearing it and never let them make it to a station to attempt to get it off. They should lose blood points for every trap that is applied where the player doesn’t get at least one chance to get it off. 
---
We get penalized for not unhooking the first two survivors ... it should be reciprocal for the pig.
---
I feel like it’s so easy for the killer to avoid it by turning their face and walking side to side, feels impossible to keep it pointed right at them the whole time
---
He needs a cooldown period. He sprints across the map with ease.. there needs to be a build up like spirit, plague, myers, legion...  why do these low tier killers have cool downs but not a high tier?? This game is ass backwards
---
I don't think he was afk the whole game, it's just after the exit gates were opened, he must've hoped for survior going for a chest when the timer is close.
---
"Hey Dwight, why aren't you working on a ge-oh. Not Dwight. Not Dwight at *all*."
---
why does BHVR have to come out with ghostface, piggy skins, and the huntress skin all at the same time? my wallet is gonna kill me
---
Plague is just a dumb killer all the way around
---
I mean, wouldn’t they be bleeding out ?
---
Forgot DC
---
Sadly it has no use against other killers apart from blinding them. Honestly I don't even use flashlight because it's better to genrush than to try figure out any use for that piece of nerfed junk :D
---
What I meant is, when you and survivor try to input an action at the same time survivor wins (as in, survivor jumping in and killer closing in). I never used the key, so I can't really see your point
---
Yeah, that too lol.
---
i like that this focuses on the "Amanda" part of the "Pig" gj
---
fucking reported for spam
---
Thank you!  I love Amanda Young so much, she was my fave apprentice tbh!
---
He does have an audio cue for stealth, but you'd stealth long before getting near anyone, and we don't know the range of it.
---
That was more of a jokey extra comment added on to my main point. However, it is important to note the devs said they were aware of the hate back when they had to rebalance the black Left 4 Dead shirt almost immediately and still dropped several immersed skins in the cosmetic store later, not only on Claudette. I wouldn't take their word on the skin part is what I'm saying given their history in this case in particular.
---
No he wasn't check the perks
---
I think them mean when survivors go *click click click click click* while you are stunned / breaking the pallet.
---
Imo that's kinda cocky and toxic, I'd rather the full blind.
---
Calm down people it's just goofs, it's just a game and surviors should've left when there less than a minute left.
---
And OP posted end game chat and they were all fine so why you all are going mental over this.
---
My advice play SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS.  Best and easiest way to rank.. usually you last longer in each match which is key and you have time to do totems, search chest, gens, saves, heal each other...
---
This was very satisfying haha
---
why is there a rank reset anyway? was it always in the game or was it added sometime after release?
---
I hope it was accidental. It looked fine the way it was, I'm sure her body and tank top are diffferent "layers" so the bloody body "layer" may have been misplaced or something. 
---
Then again I don't know anything about 3D modelling. But I hope it was unintentional.
---
I guess he expected a single player but got a toxic game instead
---
As I recall, it has always been around. I personally don't care too much for it as it gives me another reason to grind and play some more, but I still think it is a pretty silly concept with little positive impact, mainly just used to sealclub for a week or so.
---
it's bhvr we talk about though. the people who let live things like infinite window vaults, endgame bug where if you start sabo before it's activated you'll get stuck and only if you or killer dc you both will be able to leave the trial, etc. and this is just this update. don't get me started on how much they broke the game when they changed engine that it still gets broken sounds every other major update.
---
I fucking love this.
---
A. If you get off the hook, the killer could just down you again
---
B. The killer has better things to do than watch you struggle
---
C. They outplayed the team, you’re not clutching with a 4% or deliverance, regardless.
---
Then what's the killer supposed to do?
---
This has happened to me quite a few times recently, with hooks and gen grabs.
---
I feel like part of it has to do with the fact that the killer has no other objective, meaning there's zero reason to not just turn right back around and go after the survivor. But it would also be a huge fuck you to killers that hook you right next to the hatch. I think it should be implemented because if you bring the one perk that affects it (technically two but who brings slippery meat to the party?) you should get to use it, and if not, the 4% feels like fair odds to turn that game around.
---
Offerings and add-ons
---
I meant specifically finishing gens and hunting down NOED before triggering EGC requires collaboration. Just cleansing totems is still better when you're solo
---
Who? Who the fuck thinks that's so crazy? The same person OP is referencing in the title?
---
No less Frustrating than when a Killer uses some ridiculously OP Ultra Rares.
---
*Øink*
---
Me as well please!
---
Once youre the only survivor left you have no one to save you the entity will just kill you and even if you didnt die immediate as a killer i would just watch you to make sure.
---
Why not buff low tier killers? To match with the high tier killers so we don't need to nerf already old balanced killers
---
This post is on fire!  I think you added too much Hydrogen!
---
A lot of the score events are unintuitive in this game. The biggest offender of this is "Merciless Killer", a title that suggests you killed all survivors without mercy; showing no remorse; having no empathy. Yet, when trying to achieve a Merciless victory, if you killed everyone too fast, i.e. without chasing them for a long time or without damaging the generators along the way, you get rewarded a Ruthless Killer.
---
Idk why but flashlights send killers into a rage for some reason. I've been facecamped for bringing flashlights into a game even if I didn't get to use them. If survivors bring flashlights into a game it means they aren't on gens and going for the sick epic save. Literally just look at a wall or bait the pick up, flashlights are good for killers.
---
Yes! SOMEONE HELP US THE ADDONS DONT MAKE SENSE ON NEW LEGION.
---
Got it in my first bloodweb with Hag, was pretty pumped.
---
Good thing that's an EXTREMELY specific situation that you are unlikely to encounter a lot.
---
eventually everyone'd get to rank 1 and stay there
---
Most to all games do this. It's to make sure the people at that rank are consistent. It represents your current skill, if you don't play for 3 years you're not rank 1 anymore. Why should you keep it at rank 1 so you can drop down extremely and that will be reflected in your win/loss, K/D etc.
---
Tl/Dr: It makes sure you're actually at that rank at the current point in time.

I don;t mean her nerf was as bad for her as ppl say. She was always bad. Her ambush mindgames don't against good survivors and with bugged sounds you don;t even know if they left a loop after you crouching.

ye, but those other games, dont match high rank People with complete beginners

Now that I think about your right

It is. They removed you being able to GET them off the bloodweb, meaning what you have is all there is.

Survivor: humps and flashlights at pallet, taunts with emotes at every opportunity... 
---
Also survivor:  Shocked that they got tunneled until dead.
---
Taunting isn't toxic, DCing is. But taunting is annoying, don't be salty when you get fucked over cause you did it
---
It would be broken if it did that, just make the timer slow down. And the traps can still kill you just not inactive ones

---
That didn't work before the new endgame was introduced. People still opened the gates. Now it compounds the misery index. You have to assume they don't fully understand the game until proven otherwise. 
---
In the beginning there is an advantage … the killer is patrolling gens and if a totem is near it … do that first so the killer doesn't hear the gen and moves to the next one. You don't have to go out of your way, but if it's' there do it. 
---
Regardless, You play your way, and I'll play mine. Just be thankful in knowing there are players like me who make it easier for you to escape in the end.

this is so fake omegalul

It never was a problem before why would it be now?

Just play something that isnt a basic bitch killer lol

Watch both please they are so good. Scream is on Netflix and TCM is on Play Movies/ piracy websites.

Yes. That's the main reason. They would just outright know that the "Survivor" was the Killer actually.

You do realize how that people aren’t only talking about LF and age talking about all 15 killers as a whole right?
---
Oh my...lol
---
Tinkerer nurse grab 🙄
---
The way I see it is everyone else in the team got that chance to Kobe. If you never got hooked and you are the last on you either hide the hole time or you played better than your team mates so why get punished for that without your 4% Kobe chance. That being said if no one is there to pull you once you struggle it should auto death you.
---
I wound say Nerf Billy and nurse and buff the low mid tier killers. 
---
Make wraiths bell non directional and make ghost addon as base kit. 
---
Make pigs crouching speed better and her ambush lunge bigger. 
---
Make trapper that he has all of his traps already with him when he starts and make his traps that you cant Sabo them.
---
Make bubbas penalty a little less and make his last last chainsaw attack actually connect to surviours instead of going down. 
---
Make the doctor shock range bigger and fix the animation issue with surviors not getting shocked even after getting points .
---
Make so that Myers gain evil within faster from TIER 1 TO TIER 2 .
---
Not gonna mention huntress and clown as they're balanced in my opinion and well Freddy is Freddy.... Poor fedora boi. And THE PLAG is just out and I haven't played her but people say she's pretty meh.

---
I understand gradual loss of rank or an actual reset after a long hiatus, but every single month seems excessive, in my opinion.

The changes don't seem that severe. It's just that triggering collapse won't trigger the traps and inactive traps won't kill you. I don't see the issue

---
A. If the killer left there would be hope. B. I have something better to do then die on one hook. C. Not true at all, for all we know this is the only hook the killer got as the others left. This guy can still live and it is not up to you to determine the value of a human being.
---
Drink up guys he got hatch again
---
It's as if cleansing the totems is a counter.
---
My reason to flash a killer is to have him/her drop my teammate and or when i’m in a chase. I blind them to break the chase
---
Never teabag, i love you guys

Give it 3 tries after that insta death.

He's genuinely such a nice guy and it breaks my heart that little shits in YouTube comments bully the guy.
---
Wraith is probably low mid tier but he is just shy from being 100% viable without addons I’d say. It’s a gray area saying if he is mid or low tier but a slight number change wouldn’t hurt and would for sure make him a viable killer. This is the same with pig. Wraith and pig essentially only need number changes to make them good. Like Pig only needs her ambush to be longer.
---
I had a friend that left his game running during reset and he didn't reset until he restarted the game.
---
Not all killers stay. And if the guy kobe's he deserves the chance at live.
---
Thanks
---
by far she was, yes.  her psycho character matched the apprentice type best
---
End game piggy is dead. Whispers in your ear  *DEAD
---
This. The only reason the killer would even walk away in that short time is because we all know you die almost instantly. If that were to change the killer would stand there and just down you again.
---
I dig it
---
Why should a survivor be allowed to leave with a trap on. That is first of all not at all SAW and seconds just a lazy nerf. There are many other options that are better.
---
Guess people still get pretty triggered at Legion even with their changes 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Sooo.. What I'm hearing Is.. It is a legit tactic?
---
My SWF squad and I made a couple of killers DC right after they saw NOED didn’t activate
---
I got tunneled and slugged until I was the last person by a Clown with 5k+ hours the other day. He then let me crawl to the hatch, closed it, and chased me down without letting me open gates until the slowed end game timer killed me. His reason? I tried to flashlight save someone once then used borrowed time for a save when he camped them. I didn't even bring the flashlight, it was just some yellow one I found.
---
It's not playing the game to escape.
---
Spamming flashlight clicks (which is different than legitimately attempting to blind the killer) slows the survivor down and prevents them from running/sprinting away from the killer, making it harder to escape.
---
Harder to escape = harder to survive.
---
The survivor intentionally doing something to frustrate the killer (like clicking or teabagging) that doesn't improve their mechanical chances of survive is toxic.
---
Stunning me with a pallet on the other hand, while incredibly frustrating, increases the survivor's chance of escaping and therefore survival.
---
If I get a toxic survivor in my lobby when playing survivor, I'll just farm him off the hook and teabag.
---
If the toxic survivor (mostly noticeable by p3 with flashlights, trying to flex with p3) I'll just pick up Legion with Frank's mixtape (now it takes forever, but the only reason for picking it is tunneling yours truly) and Insidious with a green mori.
---
Taunt him by starting the mori animation over and over until he DC's or finish it. Letting the others escape.
---
If he stays for post game chat, just write: GG EZ ;)
---
If they were to rework leatherface, I’d say that it that making the chainsaw infinite unless you collide with a wall or get stunned would take you out of it. If you were to hit a survivor your power, you would go into a countdown of the chainsaw turning off. Maybe if it’s too op give it a recharge?
---
Dwight skin = instabuy. Love the hair!
---
\*End game Piggy get's cut open\* \*Tape has been found in her belly\* Tape: You think this is over just because I am dead, it is not. The Endgame has only just begon.
---
That seems reasonable. If I bring deliverance I should get to use my perk as well. If they allowed it that would create something new to watch out for but I really dont think this would ever happen too many killers would complain about it being a second chance point.
---
I don’t know if it was announced or not. Does anyone know when GhostFace is coming out?
---
The default is kind of flat but rounded to reflect the shape of the head, the 80's hair is a completely flat top that is cut to be flat regardless. For most people the cost of "an inch of hair" is laughable and a joke, but I could understand how people could definitely choose it over the default.
---
That's your OPINION
---
I felt Myers there
---
This masterpiece will be my new steam profile picture. Thx
---
If you dc or flame because of Legion after the patch you're a crybaby
---
Honestly I see it like this: Does the perk have a fair counter for ALL killers? If yes don't complain like a bitch. If no, nerf the perk. Just stay next to the hook. If the survivor has Deliverance or is lucky he deserves it as much as an unbreakable player.
---
you're welcome
---
End game is the worst thing that has happened to this game in my opinion. As a survivor main at least, I understand it helps the killers dramatically but when you have a 3 blink nurse who can blink to both gates in seconds there is no way to survive
---
I still cant fathom how MoM is stopping people from having good killer matches. Same thing with old ds. It never helped me more than prolonging a chase just a little bit. As a killer that it has been used on its just a hair longer of a chase.
---
I mean if he was the last one alive and the devs added an ability to kobe when your the last guy a lot more killers would stay. They only leave because they know you cant kobe.

Tips
---
Dont pop tier 3 on an injured survivor..  it's a waste just build your tier two all the way up til it's about to pop. That away when you see your next victim you'll stalk them and then have insta downs and you're faster.
---
Seeing that just got me all hot and bothered
---
Might works... I mean the surivors can't be defenceless against a one hit down killer specially at the end when there's a high chance someone will be left for dead
---
There will be one killer out of a 1000 that leaves. And that one game the survivors deserves it.
---
If they were to rework leatherface they could just make his chainsaw infinite unless stunned or he collides with a surface. 
---
He will be able to keep chainsawing after a pallet also so in order to get him out of it you have to stun him or jump in locker. 
---
To balance this, Cannibal would have to stay in chainsaw mode unless he is stunned, collides with a wall, or downs a survivor(You are still able to hold the charge but once you let go, you better hold on)
---
To balance the locker juke, he would have a period of time where he can’t hit or chainsaw like billy after the chainsaw(probably a bit longer than  Billy’s).
---
 If he hits a survivor he could go into the animation of stopping the chainsaw shortly after. 
---
This could make him still be able to get multiple chainsaw hits if the moment is right. 
---
If this is too op then they could maybe add a cool down to his chainsaw. 
---
If they want to get rid of basement Cannibal, then they could make it only do damage to 1 survivor.
---
Ghostface might be the most excited I've ever been for a killer.
---
Personally, no one.  
---
I like the original design killers better. They're also the best gameplay-wise.
---
I'm really bad at playing killer, but I figured out that I like helping people farm bloodpoints more than actually winning. After a triple DC, I followed a Nea around and let her finish most of the gens before showing her where the hatch was.
---
Yea its a pretty hard nerf to pig, she was the only killer that had a way to keep people from leaving and now her endgame strength is gone completely:/ I hope she gets some other kind of buff to make up for this.
---
If we're going by the logic of "why should X be allowed to do Y" then I can go further. Why should killers be allowed to run spirit fury and enduring, completely negating pallets and making loops impossible. Why should killers be allowed to instadown Surviviors if they can't apply enough gen pressure to keep them from doing Gens? Why should Legion (According to people who don't like the rework) not lose frenzy if he misses a stab? 
---
This "why sound x be allowed to do y" is a persistent problem that killers benefit from more than Surviviors
---
It's a strange desire of mine to keep this streak going to Day 100, lol.  
---
Some nights, I'm fucking hyyppeeddd to make something, some days I'm stuck at the warehouse and can't make anything, so I feel irate.

Some nights I put it off for so long because I haven't quite found the mood, but I know I gotta keep the streak going. Like, last night, I was falling asleep in my chair trying to make this meme. Ended up only doing a quarter of it, going to sleep, and waking up around the time I was supposed to post it, lol.

yea but I'm talking about the old system. with the new system I'm sure most would get stuck around green/purple like they do now

He put his PSN on there.. he's on PS4.
---
Why is that a problem? I don't think the intention is to grab every single cosmetic that comes out. Most people are probably throwing 5, 10 or maybe even 20 bucks at the game every couple months.
---
I have a much bigger problem with the huge grind to get perks, addons, and offerings.
---
Nice try
---
A. They’ll probably be back in 2 seconds, and they already won anyways B. If you die fast you get another game instead of struggling for a minute C. Guess it’s their teammates fault, as relying on teammates is how you survive, and their actions determine whether you live or not.
---
Guess I'm just dumb
---
I mean if the killer doesnt care sure that coukd happen, but 90% of the time the killer wants to pip or at least get the 4k. And no 4% makes me feel you deserve to live. I've kobe'd and lived. I've kobe'd and died it doesnt really matter.
---
I might get some heat for this but...DC-ing because your losing is generally kinda messed up (especially towards the end of a game), but if you're genuinely not having a good time, it's early enough in the match, and survivors are BMing, I think DCing is justified (in the future). At the end of the day everyone is playing to have fun and you shouldn't compromise your experience for someone else's (unless of course it's toward end of game where there has been a significant time commitment by survivors).
---
Seems like you just don't have any facts to argue with. All the examples you named are stupid examples. All things you said can be countered
---
It is, and there's no better feeling than denying NOED, except of course finding a key in a chest and leaving early lol
---
Before end game collapse, I once flew out of the map and just escaped through the gate with 5 gens left to complete and 3 other people still in game and alive
---
Because it barely impacts her, for all the annoyances end game pig could have been are now avoided
---
No Xbox has shitty FPS and I’m bad
---
Before you could hide and take your time either getting it off or looking for the hatch, you didn't have a 2 minute death timer.
---
Cooldown addons and/or frenzy time addons. for perks run ruin, thanataphobia, sloppy butcher, and bbq.
---
While I agree and like original killers, if we're talking Liscensed id like to see "Creeper" from Jeepers Creepers.
---
Against a spirit, we had the early hex, so the other one was most likely a haunting ground. I saw David go for it and I tried to stop him, but he did it anyway. Shortly after, both teammates were on the ground :(
---
Whats the counterplay to mom? Just play legion or huntress or plague? Just facecamp ash?
---
Absolutely fantastic, I fucking love this
---
Your kidding right?
---
I read cool down addons give a a effect of 0.6 seconds not really good in my book plus they increased the stun from 3 to 4 seconds for nah...
---
But I Appreciate it
---
A. Didn't win, survivors is not dead and has a chance. B.I can get 5000+ BP in the 5seconds it takes to unhook and be chased/survive. C. If you think like this I hope you never get unhooked again, let's she how fun and fair that is.
---
I can confirm this happens on PC
---
No, I genuinely don't see an issue with this
---
In that case you can just die on first hook every game now? Would that feel fair to you?
---
That’s not true though. Some people are just very competitive and taunting is part of that competitiveness.
---
Salt but true
---
So you think this is balance?

Before it was 2.5min now including the find game and open gate time you have 2.5min. No real reason.
---
The best way I can describe MoM is its like having a Medkit Insta Heal brought into the trial with you for free that activates with no penalty.
---
When three or four survivors have that along with their normal items, I kind of want to die.
---
Nea is just as toxic as Claudette. Can't let either of them live.
---
Overwatch keeps you at the same rank (per se) based on your placement matches. If a high ranked player stops playing for a couple of months, then they aren’t matched with newbies.
---
Only if you find a black splinter in your bloodweb, and keep in mind:
---
* It's for one use only.
---
* You can't use any of his perks or addons.
---
* The match will probably be shitty for you as your playing a killer which you have no experience in playing yourself. 
---
What i'm saying is you might as well buy him, since all splinters do is basically give you a demo of that killer.
---
I’d still main an imposter killer regardless, it would really make solo players paranoid.
---
I don’t like this. Not because i shouldn’t like this, but because what you speak be the truth.
---
unlucky
---
only if when killer opens exit door, all survivors are immediately sacrificed.
---
I mean if i havent found the hatch and the killee finds me then yeah. Its not like after he hooks me he's hoping i kobe he couksd have given me rhe hatch he wanted me to live.
---
I main a lot of Quentin and get a lot of weird messages on both ps4 and xbox when I play him. someone messaged me once calling me a drug user and then told me to go chug beans (whatever that means)
---
I think the end game is a good idea on paper, and I'm certainly glad hatch standoffs are gone, but it feels like they didn't think it through entirely. There has to be further changes to the balance for when there's only one survivor left. "But, the killer is supposed to have an advantage!", say some people. Yes, an advantage, not an absolute win condition. If the gates are close enough, or fuck, if they're on opposite sides and there's a billy/spirit/nurse, the survivor is *done*.
---
Some ideas I have are: a third way to escape for solo survivors, such as opening the hatch again with a door timer, or maybe spawning a new chest with a guaranteed key in it somewhere in the map (preferably not in view of gates). Could have one of the gates automatically open and not the other. Could hide the gate progress  indicator to allow for stealth or something. Turn it into a mindgame.
---
Also if the killer has whispers it's over even with my suggestions. So they're in a tough spot overall for end game balance, hatch standoffs are replaced with a whole other beast of a problem, though this one does waste less time.
---
I feel like a DC should automatically trigger the Entity to sprout out of the ground like in Endgame collapse and the survivor should automatically serve a pip suspension for 4 matches.
---
[I think you will be pleased to hear that 12 days later, I fixed it.](https://i.imgur.com/gDjNXOh.png)
---
More points to the killer for hitting them out lol
---
I don't see perks as being toxic and people say that are salty they lost. Toxic is when your BMing or you do things in game to mock and annoy the other side. So if a survivor lets themselves be downed to use DS then waits to let the killer hit them to activate MOM and then t bags or flash light clicks that is toxic, not the perks just the way the player wanted to use them.   
---
Its just some perks are meta.
---
Not going to happen. If I remember correctly, the creator of those movies ended up being a pedophile, so making Jeepers creepers a DBD killer would mean giving him money.
---
You really feel it the most when you're playing generic 115% movement speed killers that don't have much power in the chase, which just contributes to how poorly the perk is designed considering those killers already tend to be weaker anyway. A simple free extra health state can extend the chase to a disgusting degree where you're often forced to break it lest you risk three generators popping. 
---
A common argument is "just play Nurse lol" but the specific reason I avoid playing Nurse is because she counters damn near everything in the game and is flat out broken. If I need to pick a killer that's undoubtedly by far the best due to her ability to ignore everything strong that survivors have, it speaks leagues as to how disgusting Mettle of Man can be.
---
Um....congratulations?
---
Thats the problem, sometimes people like those killers instead of nurse and billy
---
Enduring+Spirit fury has no counter. Killers also have Noed which is an unhealthy load of bullshit in and of itself (speaking as a killer player). Killers for some reason can hit through windows. Lockers got nerfed with Plague and Jane's release for no damn reason. EGC was added to stop Surviviors from taking the game hostage and not letting the killer play the game, but took pressure from Surviviors to prevent killers bodyblocking the basement and did nothing to prevent face camping despite it not letting a Survivior play the game. They gutted decisive strike so hard it needed buffed a patch later to not be absolute dogshit but if any core perk on killers got nerfed there would be a frenzy until it was reverted. 
---
Literally borderline every balance patch has been intent on making killers have an ez time getting a 4k and shafting Surviviors. Once patch comes out to soften the blow Surviviors are gonna get hit with and suddenly all my fellow killers are at it again with the "this is bullshit" on something borderline negligible.
---
Obviously you’re not worth my time. Have a Good day!
---
Okayyy so let's not reward players for doing well in a season when 99 percent of games do.... Right
---
every, honestly every Killer that isnt Wraith or Trapper counters MoM

God damn it, I can’t unsee this

---
Rancor exists and is better overal (not in the direction of running but still works well enough)
---
He said this after I looped him in the shack lmao
---
Yep! Create the paranoia so that they can't trust their teammates would be so nice.
---
Well, if the survivor is on hook or downed, that makes the timer 4 minutes.
---
2/3 but the bar is full.
---
Reward survivors for levelling up but don't make it so that if you don't level up within a certain time window, you don't get anything.
---
Most games don't have limited time loot, especially not in the form of a battle pass (I can only name three games with a battle pass).

---
Yeah those 4 perks together are annoying but the perk alone is not. The problem isnt MoM its using a bunch of perks together that are all second chance Honestly ds shouldn't even be a problem for anyone anymore unless you tunnel straight off the hook which just means you deserve the ds getting used on you. I'm sure we can both agree that adrenaline is a bitch when it activates and basically just gets someone out of a chase completely. Healing one health state and getting 150% boost is a pain. I'm just saying when I play killer if I'm doing bad already MoMs absence  doesnt mean I'm suddenly going to do better. If I'm doing great in a match MoM doesnt stop me. That's at least got to be understandable.
---
Chucky
---
i got accused of speed hacking with huntress on ps4
---
I think the idea is that if gameplay *is* happening (like someone being downed or hooked), the timer slows to 4 minutes. I think that's enough time to at least try to find the totem and escape. If they can't find it and gotta go, then they gotta go.
---
I mean have fun playing with the same five people I guess
---
I know there is already a clown, but I feel like pennywise would be cool.
---
Normally I'm sick of seeing post-game posts, but "building abuse" is... 4head
---
It doesn’t bother the rest of us.
---
Wow thats why i did 3 gens and only gain 2k bloodpoints hehehe
---
You just forget about myers, clown, nurse, legion or literally any other m1 killer?
---
Laurie looking at the Hatch like ''why you do this to me''.
---
well, as much fun as bad Players have when facing Rank 1's I guess
---
[Ask him](https://i.gyazo.com/ad36904e0a23e40994d4ea2ee4c2fae7.png)
---
I don't t-bag, use a flashlight or any other behavior some killers find disrespectful. They just target me because of my build haha
---
I like him. His content is funnier than the rest of the group and he doesn’t take himself as seriously
---
Is 4 mins really enough if you're trying to find a totem against a killer with NOED. Presuming he's also trying to kill you? I think not
---
This community has always wavered between toxicity and weird sexual advances. Nice to see the two combined.
---
Thank you!
---
Myers has an insta down, ignores mom.
---
Ye forgot Clown, true.
---
Nurse Blinkhits dont count, at least the last time I played her.
---
Legion only does 1 M1 Hit on every down, so Mom is still no Problem
---
I found out the hard way that Mettle of Man will proc on any form of injured damage if it already has its 3 stacks. 
---
The feels.
---
“I prefer taking it up the ass, but whatever fag”
---
If he's trying to kill you then the other survivor's free to save, is he not? He can only go after one person. If it's a 1v2 situation, it's not like you were gonna get the save with or without NOED or the timer.
---
I think Myers is good where hes at... he got addons that make tiering up faster. I think they need to nerf his infinite tier 3 addon.. he should have to stalk everyone not just 2 people
---
*cries in sad chainsaw noice*
---
No release date yet my friend
---
Blink hits be counting now
---
A pretty good job so far.
---
Thanks !
---
It's annoying for someone like me who already has just about everyone P3 50 and all achievements, and the only thing I really have left to do with the game is grind for cosmetics. I know it's not a really big deal but I really want to enjoy DBD, but I feel like I have nothing left to do in the game. Just playing to play doesn't work for me.
---
I hope he will join our game someday!
---
I have the same opinion. I would love to see him ingame, he is so creepy
---
See, I dislike NOED as a perk because the amazing effect can be useful no matter how bad of a killer you've been all game. But sometimes with Mettle of Man and Adrenaline being everywhere I feel like I need it and that's really sad
---
Won’t happen
---
It's still an issue if there are only 6 killers who have any way to avoid a perk.
---
It's only OP vs Freddy. He has it hard enough, and being fucked over for the end of the game in a way no other killer has to deal with, is silly. It should only wake up if they get up off the ground. Otherwise, I like it for giving last person an escape when I stomp the hatch. They get up, I go kick pallets and dance on the body of who ever disconnected.
---
Difference is those are 1 use and gone add ons. 
---
Survivors it’s perks they get every match and items they can often keep for more than 1 match.
---
I’d recommend watching Monto and learning how to control an area and manage your time. I feel like Myers is an easy character to learn since your skill can easily find survivors if you have a three gen area going. 
---
Figure out what kind of survivors you are playing and attack accordingly. If gens are popping control an area. Try to take out someone early. There is always two or three survivors who will farm a survivor and use it to your advantage.
---
I was accused of hacking the map so we went to Lerys when I didn't burn a map offering
---
I do play both as well. As killer it’s annoying. And I don’t see it as toxic. They are using time hitting you to break a pallet and now blind and will take that much more time to catch you.
---
An actual nice comment like +rep nice person
---
always been here. in fact, it used to be that on reset, everyone went back to rank 20, even if they'd been rank 1. and that's no good, cause if you're jsut starting the game, and its withing a week of the last reset, suddenly you're paired up against people who have thousands of hours of experience. no good. so they made this compromise.
---
Because over half the cast has absolutely no way to play around it.
---
Hope he didn't report that building abuse...
---
well, what we have now, is garbage
---
Really nice!
---
Id be so pissed off if that happened to me, thats disgusting
---
Freddy can be outplayed before adrenaline will be useful and if youre busy slugging everyone then you deserve to be adrenaline bombed.
---
Trapper can potentially counter it with a well placed trap, and Clown definitely can not, so I don't know what game you are talking about.
---
Civ?
---
this would be great if high ranks were any kind fo improvement. at a certain point, you get sent against players who are more toxic, games are less fun, and you tend to get fewer points, and some killers can't be made fun at those ranks at all.
---
well? did you kiss him?
---
good luck having People Step in your traps on high ranks...lol
---
rightfully so, it was a really dumb play on my part
---
The rank reset every month is stupid with this new shit emblem system
---
at least it does one job it has.
---
keeping new players from 800h+ killers
---
I mean, some buildings are absolute bullshit when both windows are open, but complaining about shack? C'mon killer
---
*happy squealing*
---
Freddy is very bad at slugging. It used to be his strength, but between being able to recover to 95 percent and being healed waking you up he's probably the worst at it now.
---
What's the Quentin stereotype? I haven't played with/against to form an opinion
---
I’m on my third controller from playing this game for a year. First one stopped me from running intermittently and second one panned my camera left when I played survivor and made me 360 when lunging as killer. Good times.
---
no it doesnt
---
Every month that I dont Grind back to Red ranks, Im facing beginners
---
I thought they removed that?
---
That you KSI?
---
...so close!  Keep practicing you'll get there.
---
Implying “really good people” aren’t getting sandbagged around greens. It’s mostly luck at this point.
---
No, not really. I'm afraid of P3 Claude. Luckily I never saw one.
---
You should definitely remove their names pronto. It's against Redditqutte and the sub rules (Rule #3).
---
Report them in game but the best thing you can do is record this happening and submit the video directly to BHVR.
---
You should ditch sprint burst. It makes you a worse player in the long run and is completely outclassed by Balanced Landing.
---
I'll never understand why everything strong is just better against Freddy. Adrenaline, instaheals he can't stop, Bodyblocking with 2 people, the list goes on.
---
Mori is gone once it is used where those perks can be used every game.
---
not really, sure sometimes you get killed, but you still pip more than depip
---
exactly i think they downside should be worse like giving you the broken status for 120 seconds or something the anti tunnel idea would be a good change idk what they should do but it needs a slight change
---
You aren't supposed to be able to circumvent any helpful perks easily. People just want easy matches so they complain. Idk how many arguments I've gotten about this it honestly doesnt matter. The killers will get the perk nerfed eventually. God forbid a survivor has anything for a second chance that isnt adrenaline. Tbh if you aren't good with MoM you will still suck without it.
---
Monto stopped me from face camping. My gameplay and sense soared after that.
---
They could make it require 4 stacks, or put the survivor in the deep wound state or broken state when it is used. 
---
4 stacks is nothing. It would barely change anything, except make self care a stronger choice in the Meta. A status would be messy and unintuitive, so they will probably do that.
---
Why does everyone forget about Spirit? She is arguably the most frightening killer to snatch you off your gen with the after-images right after she comes out of phase.
---
but it keeps them in general. if it didn't reset they'd get to green ranks in a month and keep struggling. we'd need a lot more ranks in between and the whole system would require a rework if they really removed the reset
---
I refuse to wiggle
---
It could be either. Sometimes it’s the connection and everyone might disconnect. Other times they might be in a party/discord. It can also depend on if your game has actually started. If you downed someone/hooked them and everyone disconnects, they were probably a SWF. Not always, but probably. If no one has been found yet it’s a pretty good chance it could’ve been internet issues. Other times it could be one or 2 people disconnect, because of their internet and others will follow instead of just getting sacrificed. You never truly know.
---
Actions are not toxic, it is the intent. For most of the things you listed, the intent is obvious, but some killers do try to give a player 3 hooks ASAP to remove players from the game. They're not always trying to make you mad. To fix this non-BM tunneling, the devs need to make changes to the game. They've made some progress in this dept by adding anti-tunneling perks.
---
Issue is, you do understand there is just going to be some ochido wannabe running around using those perks for there "funny moments" and its going to ruin the game for a lot of people
---
Haha no pretty sure it was a legion, but how ironic would that be!
---
DS deserved to be gutted. While I agree with the part about NOED, Enduring Spirit Fury is counterable. Drop the damn pallet early to avoid stunning and try to get as much distance as possible(meaning don't just wait at the next loop you see, skip it if you can). Also, the fact you care about the locker nerf and considered old DS a core perk says you're not a very good survivor.
---
Congratulations, people do this everyday and they don't come here to brag about it.
---
It doesn't really do anything, so I always assumed it was a taunt. After reading comments here I found out people are trying to do it as strategy... somehow? 
---
Every time I have been flashed the survivor is usually still in my LoS, if not in the same place, when I come to. Usually tbagging away. Not once have I been flashed and it not result in, well, nothing. So I honestly assumed it was a taunt.
---
Its playful taunting and shouldnt be considered that bad. Its not toxic. It can get aggravating at times, but not toxic. I play 50/50, if your gonna taunt im gonna try harder to catch you. In the end we all say gg and forgive and forget my man. Its fun to be challenged by someone else and then when you finally catch them its more rewarding
---
Dont talk about my fursuit like that
---
I read it like that too xD
---
Not really. There are some low IQ killers. Took me all month to get to 6. If you run the killer around all game without a chance to repair or unhook, you don’t pip. That’s a good half of my matches. 
---
Solo queue is true hard mode.
---
If you DC even once, Ubisoft put a 30 min. timer on For Honor before allowing you to access the multiplayer again. You bet your ass I don't ever even consider disconnecting a terrible game. I feel like that could help alot here.
---
Lmao probably not, it’s easier for them to believe survivors just D/C to ruin everyone’s fun.
---
Really cool :).
---
Ok cool. Thanks
---
Well if we get down to it then the issue would boil down to a hit not being something that you can do being that close. If you get pallet stunned it's the same effect you are blocked. So if we make it 4 stacks and a heal you will need to heal after every hit or get downed twice and heal. That still doesnt fix what I believe is the biggest deal about the perk which is using it to escape with.
---
Jeff belongs in red rank
---
Gates open, 30 seconds left on EGC, NOED Pig, both hooked survivors have traps on their heads, I'm the only one left.
---
So I'm a coward for not rushing in to save them.
---
Even the fucking Pig took my side post game
---
I think someone guessed that it was going to be like June 18 I think but that’s just a guess but I would think June is a safe guess
---
Claudette's are just known to be a hated meme around here. You can compare her to Legion on the killers' side of things. Claudette's are known for, but not limited to, urban evading across maps, flashlight clicking, invisibility, and doing gens, you?
---
Pennywise would be an awesome killer. His special skill could be "paralyzing fear" or something where the attacked survivor gets Frozen in place for like 3-5 seconds
---
I had the same thing yesterday too
---
r/ihadastroke
---
you've made a worse pig...
---
“die kommt halt nicht näher” lmao your comments make it even funnier
---
Have you tried running at them?
---
Your already at red ranks?!??!?
---
Claudette, neutral?  True Claudette is always chaotic evil
---
If you are rank 3 with 3 pips what do you get reset to? I’m new to this
---
My friend and I got slugged by a Myers during EGC and he walked over me nodding just waiting for the entire murder.
---
My friend found the hatch so I dc’d and he escaped. Was worth it.
---
The best ironically: Being called noob twice because I tried to loop the killer and said survivor got in the middle of the jungle gym during the loop all of a sudden. The second time I was called a noob was because the survivor tried to heal himself close to the hook where I was instead of picking me up and.. well, the killer found him.
---
The best actually: Killer said I was the kindest survivor (aka non toxic) in the past weeks so I've deserved the hatch
---
Wraith is hitting the sickest dab in this one 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
---
I have that issue with windows. I go to fast vault and I slowly climb and get caught. I hate windows.
---
I forgot that this is not only Reddit, but the DBD community as well.
---
May the toxicity thrive. Downvote away.
---
Pyramid Head please
---
Downvote cuz prayer beads
---
There HAD to be a change evne if you can 99% the gates it wont always happen or mnatter. 
---
They could have just made the collspe slower though
---
Spirit Fury, Enduring probably. Maybe bamboozle.
---
If she looked like that I would NOT run and pray she would crush me
---
why is everyone so horny for the huntress
---
That's overpowered and an awful idea.
---
Its fucking awful
---
I'm glad someone else here has some culture. I love the look so much. Instead of a basic black robe he legit looks like an almost medieval assassin. I love it.
---
Not my ghostface
---
It should be whoever gets there first.
---
This happened to me before. They should have it to where if 2+ survivors disconnect within 30 seconds of the match starting that the match is cancelled and offerings are returned. Oh, and also, goes without saying but...
---
***”I think we did a pretty good job so far”***
---
I don’t use noed. I bring ruin , sloppy butcher , nurses calling and bbq ( sometimes I take sloppy butcher off and fire up )
---
*Nothing but big, sweaty facts have been written here*
---
Billy. Can't proc MOM if you go from healthy to downed WeSmart
---
I run m/a, BBQ, ruin and enduring ATM, which I've swapped for sloppy until I get nurses calling cos I wasn't playing and always forget to buy it on shrine. So saving to get nurse to 40.
---
BBQ is essential, aura readings nice as it lets you know if you can beeline or be cautious as their going for unhook in vicinity.
---
I'll have 2 builds soon. M/a, ruin, BBQ and NC, then I'll also run m/a, NC, enduring and spirit fury or mix and match it.
---
I just see zero downside to why anyone wouldn't use nurses on a MA dead rabbit Myers. People are so risky and heal so close it I assume would allow constant hooks from those who lose you or pallet whore.
---
Edit: basically bbqs bps makes it a bloodhunt 24 7 for killer, don't matter about auras that shit is madness. Reason I don't play survivor lol. I can't enjoy killer if I drop it knowing I lose half bps
---
Nope. Its only active..before inactive traps did too
---
true, it's only useful when a generator is done. but it's unrealistic to expect to have a large number of games when NO generators get done, especially against SWF teams. and if the survivors are so bad that a no-gen game happens, then you could probably finish them off without decent perks anyway. And like I mentioned, it helps zero in specifically on the survivors who ARE getting gens done, thus preventing and pressuring them from fixing more of them. 
---
BBQ is slightly better when considering the bloodpoints, but honestly I think as far as gameplay goes, BBQ and Murmur are roughly equal, and choosing between them is a matter of preference. keep in mind that Murmur is actually harder for the survivors to counter than BBQ, since you wont get into a locker fast enough to counter the aura reading. the only viable way is to be running distortion, not be near a gen when it's fixed, or crouch right next tot he gen for five seconds to allow the bubble to block your aura, at which point the killer knows you're sticking close.
---
Still overpowered, it takes about 3s for the killer to recover after a successful hit, if pennywise had a power i'd think it would be where he travels around disguised as a red balloon, which lowers his terror radius and removes the red stain, and gives him a minor speed boost, when the balloon pops he's back in as the clown. The movement is based on a timer (like the spirits phase walk) but lasts a shorter period without addons.
---
They have to be active to kill you so the description holds true.
---
No. Active traps still explode. 
---
Players are just mad that they can no longer put a trap on AFTER every gen has been completed and control the end game collapse.
---
The same shit i read everyday
---
What’s wrong with bamboozle?
---
Hell I can’t trust my teammates now, I keep running into randoms that can fail 10 skill checks in a row, at least with an imposter killer I can lie to myself and say that they meant to do it.
---
Noed needs to get deleted like James Charles career did...
---
Ok
---
I don't own pig but agree that they should have tested slowing the timer down first. I'm very curious as to how it would play and think it would be fun (I love the panic aspect of the game)
---
But honestly, I don't really notice a huge change or nerf other than most traps being placed mid-game instead of early and late game. My head has been blown up *multiple* times since EGC has been released, where I can only recall it being blown up once in all my time playing before the change. Now that hatch always spawns and can be shut, it has been closed while my trap is active and I cannot get that bish off before the timer ticks to 0 or I am found. However, I do play at red rank, and these Pig players understand the strategy of traps and use her kit pretty freakin' well (as in they actually use the damn crouch). 
---
I'm not sure how she plays at different ranks who don't play her strategically so maybe this change is utter ass for them, especially if they are placing traps the second they down someone... but I'd argue that's a learning curve that they have to experience to become a more optimal pig.
---
Just my useless two cents...
---
It's totally not the worst idea. For me hits come all to easy especially if I'm not in a safe area I basically dont have a counterplay to get to a area with pallets fast enough. Window vaults mean nothing if the killer is close enough. You will just eat a hit. 90% of my downs are in areas that have all the pallets destroyed by usually one person. Or my MoM activates in a tunneling situation which is where it's truly needed. I could care less if a killer outplayed me and gets me because hes a better player. I mainly want MoM for incase I'm being camped or tunneled.
---
Ah! Sorry, I'm not the best when remembering things like that. Thanks for the correction!
---
Maybe, idk I still like my idea. It sounds like mine should be more of a perk though. I feel like if he had an add on it would be a red balloon. Plus if pennywise did shapeshift into a balloon then anytime a survivor saw the distinct balloon they would go running
---
spirit furry enduring ruin bbq that is what i  run
---
Unfortunately, all of these perks would be awful Locked Up would be extremely difficult to plan around and would most likely do more harm than good. Costly Consequences would be bad because it would only be useful on windows like the one on Ironworks and would again, be extremely difficult to plan around. Favoritism would just be bad. Hooks aren't that difficult to get to.
---
I did say IMO on the start of my sentance, but i have been doing really well with him around rank 1 against some sweaty swf teams. I dont complain about the speed because the duration is very long. Anyway its just how i see it.
---
We should all reset back to twenty every couple of months hehe
---
Once again, no. That's basically assuring you'll hit them a second time unless they're right next to a pallet or the exit gate.
---
The community is toxic but there are still lots of great people. I always try to say gg no matter what the outcome of my match. You can’t change people but if you are respectful of others good things will come around to you.
---
Edit: accidentally put can instead of cant
---
What if only hits while at full health count? So the first hit you take in a match gives you one stack, but if you get downed you won't get another stack because you were injured? Idk they could easily just make it an exhaustion perk which would be a boring albeit effective fix, because that would also stop the problem of people stacking it with adrenaline and dead hard.
---
I run nurse's calling, monitor &amp; abuse, ruin and a perk of your choice
---
I second this.
---
My nea is level 5. When it shows up in the shrine though I’ll get it.
---
Thank you! I though they had lowered them. I wish I would have seen this post hours ago.
---
If the area is made unsafe the killer played it well if you got herded there. Just ignoring the plays killer makes because of a perk is stupid. Also I heard enough of the "it's for when I get camped and tunneled" excuse in the DS days.
---
Nah Bc it takes even longer to do a gen if you’re tapping that just getting the ruin skill checks.
---
Is that the Plague perk that makes you scream if you are in the Killer’s terror radius when they down someone? If so, yes it does counter it.
---
youll never get the use of the exposed effect properly since it will only work with the m1 and if you want the reload just use deerskin gloves. but i will say the knowledge of where people are can be nice but people rarely if ever walk in lockers
---
I believe a youtube link would work best but I am not 100% certain. Hopefully someone else could clarify just in case.
---
Ok so speeding across the map in 3 seconds with an instadown in balanced ? Yeah ok
---
Username checks out
---
You're kinda a kill joy. That's just my opinion tho
---
If you open a gate it stays open, but if it takes you longer than 5/4/3 min to open the gate then a generator shuts off and you gotta power it again (would be the same 3 generators that were left before)
---
Gen tapping takes longer than just working thru a ruin, so by all means keep tapping those gens big-brain survivors.
---
Still appreciate your help!
---
Anything else all killers run
---
False, I play Black Ops 4 competitively for money, thank god because the League Play system is SHIT. There’s no elo system you can be masters and get matched with bots.
---
controversial who cares, everyone has their own opinion. I was just wondering cause I main Jane whenever I play survivor lol.
---
The location you picked them up from was a bit bugged, the game canceled your pickup because of it, and the nea got stuck in that spot so you couldn't pick her up.
---
You can still be looped as Billy and have you actually played him without addons?  The charge time is so shit,  surviors have the time to go to corners, windows or pallets. 
---
Plus his best ability is his insane map pressure, do you honestly want him to turn to another m1 killer like trapper or wraith? Plus I reckon he won't be touched but I think his addons should be reworked and it takes skill to "speed across the map in 3 seconds"
---
Why are you getting downvoted the creator of jeepers creepers is a pedophile I’d love to see the creeper in the game but I would not give a dime to that sick fucker
---
Crouching Pig breathes like she got asthma

I fucking love Quentin, cutest boy of all time
---
And they said machine gun build was dead, haha
---
Looks like there's a little smidgen left.  Did it complete on your next game?
---
I hate this logic that because someone is pointing out that something may be to powerful or lacks counterplay, that means that the person just wants ez 4k's and to never ever lose ever. That's such a strawman argument that is used to derail actual discussions about balance.
---
it's probably not gonna get nerfed till ash sales go down or it appears in the shrine. just like with ds. they make a good perk to get people to buy him then nerf it when theyve got their money
---
Most of the time my friends and I play and we don't know who the killer is I always say "After this gen, lets find out"
---
Doc, Spirit, and Pig want to know your location.
---
What about HybridPanda? I’ve tried to get into Monto and Tru3 vids, but once you go panda you can’t go back
---
The problem, you see, is that you leveled Freddy to 43
---
I want to play a game
---
Well you know you probably keep hearing something because it's part ways true. I can repeatedly get camped and tunneled. When you deal with bullshit killers enough you dont have sympathy and you run op perks because you legitimately need it for things to be fair. Also one player using every pallet in a area shouldn't happen I have no control over that and I'm not going to allow myself to get punished because of stupid random teammates. This perk evens out the questionable tactics killers use which is why people dont like it. You act like I can avoid unsafe areas when it's entirely possible my objectives are in that area. The killer doesnt have to plan to get a survivor that helps him remove every pallet and they certainly dont put effort into hoarding people into that spot they usually have to go there. This game has so many things that are out of your power so I dont think one extra hit is that bad. When I play killer which is about as often as survivor one extra hit only saves someone in rare instances.
---
Exactly, while still impressive try doing this on PC :)
---
Calm Spirit counter Infectious Fright.
---
Can’t seem to find the account zombiehuggerr would like to check out some templates
---
I think it should take time not everything needs to be instant.
---
Yeah that’s the one. Makes sense.
---
I will definitely be buying this is if it's in the store.
---
What
---
NO
---
ONE
---
KNOWS
---
Beats me, I just love her design
---
Ruin is already a useless perk against even semi competent players. Ruin skill checks aren't hard at all. Plus it's all up to luck if you even get a skill check, I've worked on a gen start to finish with ruin and had zero skill check.
---
already told someone else, he has no hunting, deviousness, or brutality points which you can see when he does start to move and go for Claudette, not to mention she is his 1st BBQ stack meaning his 1st hook.
---
He was afk all game
---
I didn't say it needs to be instant, but it needs to be a bit quicker and I've seen Myers getting cucked in tier 1 after 3 Gens were done on lerys map. (not scratched mirror btw) 
---
But I stand still on other killers
---
And I am on pc so please take it from that viewpoint.
---
I just think you should need 4 stacks of something. It's a good perk so if you take some aspects away it will eventually be a average perk unless it gets nerfed too hard which makes it useless. I honestly only want it as a anti tunneling perk because that's the most useful thing.
---
Yeah because the intended purpose is always very well balanced...
---
*proceeds to t-bagging 14 times*
---
*stares at screen* 
---
“Hatch. Fucking. King.”
---
I definitely started singing the Queens of the stone age song when I read this.
---
I've been playing for two years and I still can't master that. I gave up trying.
---
Can these be stickers on Etsy?
---
it was a 666 upvotes i got ya’ll
---
Lmao if it wasn't for rank reset i highly doubt you would've gotten that still tho congratz
---
I’ve been running small game especially for this tbh
---
Iron Will - Don't even feel right playing without it anymore lol. After playing some killer and seeing (or hearing, rather) how easy it can be to find injured survivors based solely on their grunts, I knew I needed to use it. Great with other stealth perks to make you totally disappear during chases.
---
Balanced Landing - Always gotta have an exhaustion perk and BL has just ended up being my favourite. Lots of maps have spots that are good for it. It was always between this and Lithe for me, and because of Lithe's (now non-existent) chase mechanics, I picked Balanced and I've stuck with it ever since.
---
Diversion - I don't use it at higher ranks really, but god, is it fun... There will never be anything more satisfying than throwing a pebble and watching the killer run toward it.
---
Franklins demise - fuck you and your flashlight.
---
Lithe - It's satisfying to jump a window and zoom
---
Borrowed time - it lets be altruistic with less guilt!
---
Scary movie with this guy was great. Im excited for this killer and will probably buy him immediately
---
To stop them from doing Gens? Yeah sure so unbalanced
---
Gen tapping means you're really bad... even if you hit only good skill checks on ruin its still fastar than gen tapping. Also you won't improve at all if you gen tap so there's that.
---
I'd honestly rather his duration be shorter then him be slower.
---
This comment shouldn't be so downvoted. I play a little bit more killer than survivor, and it's absolutely annoying to have a survivor teabag or click their flashlight at you 3 times before continuing their pallet loop or running away. I never do that as a survivor, because I know how it feels. Getting outplayed is bad enough, but then you have to throw salt on the wound by doing THAT? I don't get it. The people that do that must have some serious problems behind the screen. If you find that behavior non-toxic, look up the definition again. Some people in this thread are pretending it's not. And downvoting these comments make you just as bad as the teabagging survivors. The reason I took a half-year break from DBD was because of the community, and now I genuinely remember why I left in the first place.
---
Who hurt you, Michael?
---
Aww, I can tell by the heart in her hands rather than the blade that she is a friendly killer. :)
---
Man this happened to me right when I saved the dude and was at the exit gates all the other survivors left me to go down, the killer didn’t have NOED and only one of them was injured besides me. And they just left. :/ made me feel sad now I don’t wanna be helpful to any survivors
---
WOW. Thank you for pointing this out. I was wondering what was going on. I just noticed in my last game when I finished a gen and no indicator for points came on my screen.
---
Adrenaline - Very useful since I don't use self-care. Love getting my little boost as a reward.
---
Bond - the amount of information I get as a solo survivor with it makes it so good. a must. (also good to stalk shirtless David)
---
We'll Make It - counters anti healing perks very efficiently.  Not today, Legion.
---
This is always how rank reset is. Hurts people that are rank 5 or worse, let’s red ranks bully players, and removes the 1% of people that don’t belong in the rank they’re inc
---
Agreed! And I think maybe the survivors individual teachable perks could have an extra buff sort of deal with them that's unique to the survivor you select and allow that perk to still be teachable but only the lesser version of it
---
Speak for yourself
---
Spine Chill- for awareness and a quick boost to finish a gen.
---
Borrowed Time- we both get what we want i get rescue points you dont die.
---
Bloodwarden- its situational but when it goes down the reactions are hilarious.
---
I completely agree with you on Iron Will, such a power perk, especially when not running self care
---
Everyone always has some kind of problem though. That doesnt mean their struggles are more important than yours though friend. I just tell myself that their problems are worse so I feel better but it's still something that's detrimental to my life.
---
Love me some adrenaline plus bond. Adrenaline for the power plays plus rage quits!
---
Rank reset is a totally pointless choice for this game, it takes all of the sweaty toxic try hards in the red ranks and puts them right back with the 10-20 ranks and it completely destroys them. Rank reset needs to be removed or adjusted. 
---
Example if you’re a red rank (1-5) killer or survivor you will not be able to leave that rank area unless you haven’t played for a full season.
---
i am speaking for myself 🤣
---
This 100%. Recently I've been running Iron Will, Resilience, and Adrenaline together... it's pretty nice.
---
Ok. So if they had the trap on BEFORE the final gen was done, it will pop their heads?
---
It combines real horror of child abuse and the super natural horror that is Freddy.
---
Fight fight fight 
---
Kiss kiss kiss
---
Oh, I like the set up, Resilience is fun. Would often run it with spine chill before taking a 6 ish month break :D
---
But the *Mettle Of Man* activates ***hehehe*** also at rank 20 prob an instant dc and the meg getting called an hacker in the aftermatch lol
---
I don’t know why, but your drawing style reminds me of **BROFORCE**.  Like I hear “BRODDY KRUEGER!!!” followed by an eagle screech when I look at this.
---
Edit:  Also, I think the thumb may be on the wrong side.
---
Perhaps 14th of June for the third anniversary?
---
I think its pointless. I sit out usually for the first week of the reset then I go through and play which means I'm going to destroy killers until I get to my rank. It just allows for lower ranks to suffer until everyone's back in the right spot.
---
According to OP, the counterplay to MoM is to keep chasing them around loops while more generator progress is being done. Just rank 20 things I guess. If you're lucky, by the time the Exit gates are powered and Adrenaline also kicks in, each survivor will have 3 or 4 hits to burn through while they teabag you and/or run 150% faster.
---
I think your correct and that’s why no one plays those movies anymore, the first one was great but then to learn that was like wtf
---
Altruism after NOED totem is broken- NOEH (no one escapes heals)
---
This is just going to make killers camp the last hook since there is literally nothing else to do. What a fun interaction. Let's add the ability to unhook yourself in struggle phase while we're at it so you get *six* chances. Whoopdey fucking do.
---
If this got implemented no killer would leave. And getting the Kobe doesn't mean you deserve shit. It's up to the killer whether or not they want to follow that dumb ass honor rule.
---
Meowyers
---
Literally the worst. Almost had it a while back and the last guy d/c'd after i somehow managed to catch him right before he got the hatch
---
&gt; It's not playing the game to escape.
---
i mostly agree with what you're saying, but here's a counterpoint. It is a team game, and the longer they can delay the killer, the more the team can collectively get done, thus increasing the overall survival rate of the team.
---
I love when I’m in the menu and she cackles and the suddenly (Sad Wah)
---
tried it with closed and opened
---
Just check out the day whatever number posts that come up, he makes them
---
I'm always a little sad when I get left behind ... I know it's the smart play but I'm always like "You are really going to leave lil ol' sweet Dwight on the hook like that?"
---
obviously you go up to the lever lol
---
I hate rank reset. The killers I’ve been getting today are rank 15-18 and play like it, usually spending the whole match camping and tunneling one person while the rest of us do gens and escape. I’d rather play against a killer that’s challenging to go against and die then this.
---
First I wanted Bunny Min and now I want Bat Anna!!
---
I feel personally attacked by this lol
---
Maybe i think so
---
I'm a basic bitch, but
---
Dead Hard - Used right, it can extend chases, avoid knock downs, do tricks, etc. I've used it for everything.
---
Iron Will - Now that killers can't hear your foot steps(thank you btw, i main both so i hate and love it) might as well let them never hear you at all.
---
We'll Make It - Used correctly, speed healing everyone once their off the hook can be great. Also secures the safe hook rescue a lot easier for me, I don't like Borrowed.
---
I’ve actually ran those two, level 3 together for entire evenings. Never gotten more than 1 key in a match. It’s ok. I took down their names, and have run into them another time today. They and anybody I suspect of running those perks gets face camped to death. Consequences be damned
---
Fair points, yet bbq is nearly always going to be well times. What i mean is that when you hook sb, you 100% need to find next target and you find at least one which is the whole purpose of this perk and does this job very well. Gen can pop mid chase or even when you already see them ending the gen. Then its pretty useless. 
---
Dont prove me wrong, murmur is great especially for new players or sb without dlc’s. But after all, i find it as a waste of perk slot tbh
---
Btw, about those bubbles, are these only annoying me so much that you cant see shit because of them? For example, mostly as survivor, you see the hook clearly from 30 meters but you dont know where killer went cause of this bubble. For me it is pretty stupid mechanic, at least dont make this effect if you see them or sth
---
At low rank it's garder to get dc's bc ppl actualy care lol
---
LOL, that's pretty hardcore.
---
Bamboozle- Pt.1 of my braindead build, basically shuts down window looping
---
Enduring- I dont respect pallets and this just makes taking the stun more worth it Pt.2 of my braindead build
---
Spirit Fury- this is hands down one of the best perks to run on M1 killers in my opinion and expedites stabbing survivors. Pt.3 of my braindead build.
---
Put all of these together on any m1 killer and have fun! I love running it on wraith. People tend to not like that.
---
Ok f
---
Ah cool
---
I dunno. They actually punish toxicity and dc'ing. 
---
And just anecdotally I've played both of those and DBD is certainly worse as a community due to the infestation of tons of toxic little shits.
---
I’m routing for  around late may
---
i love it so god damn loud XD
---
When i play survivor, if i get hooked and the killer has NOED, i'll suicide instead of letting my teammates attempt to save me. it isn't worth the fight, i want my team to escape
---
Slept through a dehydrator.
---
What do you mean? One of the funnest killers to go against with one of the funnest add-ons! /s
---
This artist needs to be known. These drawings have a lot of personality.
---
&gt;But yea this will never be implemented since survivor mains will cry since they rely on their friends to win
---
No, it will not be implemented since it will increase que times, and possibly make people who play 4 man SWF quit playing, resulting in less money for BHVR. It'd just be a bad business move. I don't "rely on my friends to win" but I find the game alot more fun when I'm playing with my friends and not left to die on first hook while solo queing.
---
I swear this sub goes to survivor sided every other month lol. Omega blink nurse and ebony are 1 time uses and you will eventually run out.
---
Mettle of man and other second chance perks can be used every game and only instaheals can run out.
---
Is that Clementine from The Walking Dead or am I tripping
---
Hi
---
that frog mf
---
Played against a spirit just now, she had no ruin or anything, and of course the teammate still destroys the obvious haunted grounds. I get hit just as it is destroyed, so i suicide on hook because it trigged the shit out of me lol. Shortly after I have a teammate raging at me for quitting. Don’t even care lol
---
Fam how you're doing in the match from the start does matter but the game can be changed instantly due to killers out playing them or surviors mistake, so having mom is a big hindrance and it will affect your overall progress regardless you're playing good or bad
---
Don't care about adrenaline as it's pretty understandable and is only for end game but there is literally no need for MOM to exist in the game
---
no. Need.
---
yeah it did, it was probably that
---
I stream on ps4 too ill add ya
---
Buddy over here got beat multiple times in a row and claims its swf 4 mans each time. Dont blame it on that dude. People like to play with their friends and there is not really that many swf 4 mans out there.
---
I think the post is talking about flickering the flashlight, as opposed to blinding them.
---
That and those 4 man SWF had like 8% at best increased survival rates.
---
Legit I play only huntress and pig and I prestiged my huntress for the first time to battle the upcoming mom rush
---
As a survivor and huntress main... I love mettle of man.
---
Got it the day Ash came out, haven't looked back. SC/BT/DH/MoM FTW.
---
The thigh bulge makes my heart beat faster
---
For me, I want a harsher penalty than the bs aura reading, legit people just don't heal when MOM triggers or they heal themselves to 99 and do Gens
---
Give the broken effect for the whole round or give them deep wound, there is legit no downside for using MOM and that sucks.
---
what are you talking about, waluigi is already a killer
---
I have a question about this. I read the patch notes and everything and thought that you could now exit with an RBT on. But yesterday I went to exit and my head exploded so did the changes go through or was this a bug or something?
---
They should just remove this hilarious rank system from the game, it's pointless, no rewards, doesn't reflect the skill at all since it's mixed matchmaking.
---
You're crazy man. I've seen stuff on R6 get patched in less than a week yet we still have multiple literal match breaking glitches in DbD for months, if not longer than I am aware of.
---
yeah. there should be serious punishment for disconnecting
---
"bullying is not fun to face"
---
*proceeds to derank to bully new players*
---
THANK YOU! that's what I needed to hear
---
Awesome perk with no counterplay and downside, this is bs
---
Looks great!
---
That's much better
---
Funny how "So my primary objective is to survive" makes you fuckers lose your GODDAMN MINDS
---
No one is @ing you mate, I got your back
---
AIN'T NO BODY GONNA CHAT SHIT ABOUT MY FENG.
---
Delete the game and redownload it
---
+1 follower
---
I hate rank reset, sometimes I get insanely easy games and sometimes I just get bullied into oblivion on both sides. It’s just not very enjoyable for me
---
The bug I was talking about has been in the game since the Burnt Horizon's test server.
---
Oh my God this is so cute, props to you for making my day!
---
The same killer mains on this subreddit that act like every game they get is a 4man P3 Squadette with flashlights, instaheals, and all the other "toxic" things that go with that. &lt;*glances at recent info-graphics showing otherwise*&gt;
---
When I turn up my brightness this looks kinda weird, I think it looks nice but when I turn the brightness up on my phone it just looks a little strange. Other than that I do like it
---
Yeah they're nearly useless, and need to be redesigned.
---
Thoose stats are for 1 week of games
---
It isnt the most trustworthy source
---
Nah I am there too bud.
---
Idc lol he tried killing me don’t be a bitch and you’ll survive
---
Someone doesn’t like a idea or change and they get called a main lol
---
Because it has 0 counters?
---
But remember,  if it's unfair just don't play killer! 
---
This is the response I got recently.
---
I hit someone while they were exposed and they survived bc of metal of man
---
It is! It was the best child model I could find. Tried to edit it a bit
---
Well I mean, I don't want to get flashed by Jeff, Dwight, or David.
---
Jane or meg, on the other hand.....
---
there’s 5 totems! gotta get them all
---
Not nurses, nurses is not very good.
---
I believe the one shield glitch you are talking about is due to server limitations. I've never seen the deployable glitch at Plat/Diamond ranks in 100s of hours. R6 has had maybe 3 round breaking glitches I can think of right now. All of them required the player to activate them though.
---
But I have seen multiple massive texture glitches, control glitches, extreme sound glitches, core mechanic glitches for killers, add-on glitches for killers, common inbalanced matchmaking go on for months. A lot of those are automatically activated and a lot of them make literally the entire round unplayable.

---
I’m thinking the address book is more for the person he’s stalking, not who he in particular is
---
The counter is the aura reading which is a red flag you should probably kill that person first since a lot of killers approve of tunneling/camping as a “viable strat” 
---
Besides that I do agree it could use a rework
---
Okay this actually made me lol in public.
---
Survivor: self care, adrenaline, mettle of man, and iron will.
---
Killer: ruin, BBQ, sloppy, and enduring.
---
I mean when an attacker or Clash's shield clips into the player's body sideways, and lets them get show from the front, where the shield SHOULD be.
---
Rancor: Once all Generators are completed...
---
Noed: Once the Exit Gates are powered...
---
Well, that’s just like, uhm, your opinion, man.
---
Always
---
Its a single purple add-on paired with brown lul, try getting better at the game either that ot go and toss out all your purple items and add ons.
---
Sloppy is overrated. Spirit fury is extremely meta.
---
Eh supposedly he's still good at it if you use something like Knockout or Hex: The Third Seal. (Or both) Survivors can't see the aura where you down them (and the downed man can't see the other survivors) so they'll have some major trouble finding them.
---
i haven’t had this happen to me, but i imagine this is what i would feel like if i did
---
But I mean it’s pretty dumb not to have the same text at this point. You can’t even finish gens if gates are powered.
---
That's what I'm saying it's like it takes a minute to get a game going as a killer and it's just awful that people just dc after one hit!!!!
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Maybe? I've seen people mentioning selling them as stickers, but I honestly have no idea what the intricacies are of the legality around selling fan art for profit. I've already looked it up, and since the only surefire way I could find that would avoid a lawsuit is asking for a license from the copyright holder, I guess that's where I gotta start.
---
Nah it was default David lol. Seems it is happening a lot.
---
What competent devs. "Here, we're going to implement a timer system, and not bother to check what happens if the killer is still carrying the survivor when it runs out!"
---
Seconding this;
---
When it's Dead Hard I can just bait out the dead hard and smack them.
---
Adrenaline you can either be near them to smack them down, hold onto them, or hook them.
---
DS you can chase someone else, slug them, or just eat it.
---
These are all things you can do regardless of what killer you're playing as. There's skill to countering those perks and it comes down to knowledge, doesn't matter if you're playing Trapper or Wraith.
---
Against MoM though? There's literally nothing you can do as Trapper except hope that the idiot runs into your traps or camp them dead so you don't have to deal with it. The first part isn't going to work, and no one wants the second part.
---
Nurses is god tier, right under ruin and bbq. I've found so many survivors in their weakest position thanks to this perk
---
Listen, I get it that in theory one bit shoudnt really be that detrimental but practically in games as you said you play killer, downing then near a pallet mind game and them not going down while they're on their death hook or them vaulting a window in front of an exit and not going down when you successfully hit them really hurts the killer and ya know?  We legit can't do anything to avoid it? Or counter it or try to soften its blow on the overall pressure we have.
---
We used to not have to deal with virtual currency...  
---
This is one of the most grindy games ever and progression literally affects gameplay if you consider bloodpoints give you in game items.  Something as core as doing gens should not break lmao stop defending these guys.
---
People who play this game, I tell you....
---
"We're getting sick and tired of high ranks because all it is is Billy and Nurse!"
---
"Well, we could do this and this that would allow those other killers to be more viable, but it would require Survivor Nerfs."
---
"What, NOOOOOOOOOOO!"
---
And shit just saw your username and  I just realized we have actually discussed about killers and bloodweb and RNG in the past, so...
---
What's good homie?
---
Why is there not a hotfix for this?
---
Did you warn them? I mean if 2008 called the least you could have done was warn them of the tumpacalypse 8 years hence
---
The claudettes with the bright pink clothes
---
This reminds me of how I deal with toxicity in games. (Namely league.) I sexually harass /sexually advance on said angry player until they mute me or shut up. Seeing my team enjoy it is also good.
---
I thought it was 15?
---
Watch out we got a badass over here
---
Some nerfs I would propose
---
4 stacks instead of three to activate MOM
---
Giving the broken effect after MOM is proc. 
---
Aura reading will be permanent regardless of the distance, After activating MOM. 
---
Just something more harsher than the bs "aura reading outside 16m WHEN FULLY HEALED"
---
Adrenaline: Holy shit the amount of times this perk has saved my doomed ass is astronomical.
---
Decisive Strike: Underrated after the nerf, but I think it's more viable than before. Basically like having a more reliable Borrowed Time.
---
Devour Hope: A very niche perk, if survivors don't come across it before the third token, it's amazing how scared the survivors will be of you. Usually gets cleansed before the second token for me, but maybe you have better luck.
---
Exactly what this dude says... There are imbalances on both sides. Just suck it up and go next one...
---
That's Tapp XD
---
Wack
---
Personally I think it comes down to playstyle and running Sloppy with it. I usually don’t run Nurse’s simply because I am pretty confident in my sound whoring and I normally don’t play close to hooks which is where the majority of healing goes down. I also find it difficult to squeeze Nurse’s into a lot of builds if you run BBQ. I think it’s borderline op if you play around it properly with high mobility but other than that there’s other more general use perks that offer more value.
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, BBQ &amp; Chili, Bamboozle, A Nurse's Calling, Hex: Ruin, etc.
---
u/ZombieHuggerr
---
Neas and claudettes
---
God I hope we can get this version. Prefer it over default
---
Not much. Just trying to concoct ways to make the game balanced for everyone. It's a big issue man. The ranking system makes it worse though. I feel like low ranked problems aren't the same as high ranked issues if that makes sense. Something in this game can be a huge issue for some players but no issue at all for the next guy. It's insane but it needs to be acknowledge. Like MoM is totally fair if a survivor isnt great at loops. Then you  turn around and it's unfair for a killer that is having a hard match. Then on a good survivor it's unfair because it's making someone impossible to get. You turn around again and for a super good killer it's a minor inconvenience.
---
This is art.
