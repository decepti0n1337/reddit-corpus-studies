Same, OP seems to just want to complain. Mobile works fine for me.

Spirit
---
This is a ridiculous question
---
I haven't come across a plague in days, I miss them :(
---
The only issue with Freddy is the first hit because you don’t see him clearly when being pulled into the dream world and he is usually right behind you to hit you as soon as you are asleep. But you can counter that by vaulting a window or running into him or spinning to confuse him. Other than that he can be easily looped like any other M1 killer.
---
god please no voice chat... its a terrible idea...
---
Darn
---
To my knowledge it does, Bamboozle is a very common perk on Myers builds for that reason.
---
I would just use the PS4 community as that is what its there for :)
---
How likely is Decisive Strike going to appear in the Shrine of Secrets? I recently started playing again (whenever the last sale was), and I really need a perk like this.
---
You will get there I believe in you!
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hope to see you sometime in the game :)
---
Holy fuck how am I just now thinking about this?! Please tell me they’ve addressed this, so you’re telling me surveillance is completely useless on new Freddy...
---
go fuck yourself
---
Thanks for the response. I just don't really know a lot about that stuff. What is the PS4 community?
---
Since the entity blocker came up, that's about 99% likely to be lag switching. That would either mean they had a spike each time you tried to vault, that died immediately, or they were timing their switches to interrupt your vault, and bumping you back after it started.
---
I'm surprised that someone was willing to sit through and read my response, Thanks!
---
They were able to see who was using the Legion exploiting add ons from game reports, basically impossible to see who was using the sprint burst glitch. Also they didn’t fix the legion issue right away, that also took some time.
---
if you use ebonies in anything other than redranks... kinda? Like people expect to have to use their better builds in higher ranks. So its incredibly unfair when someone kits themself out with all of the highest tier add ons and offerings while the other side is ready for like a regular rank 15 game
---
Is lag switching a thing tho on console ?
---
Ace in the hole is ok, but IMO, the best about Ace is Ace himself
---
In a sense, yeah. I think there's ways you can finagle it, but it's still janky. Its even worse on the ghost face gen blocking perk
---
I know i was really just exaggerating the question i know people win against him but whenever i get him its someone whos good af and just relentless on everyone.
---
It says 33 so I guess that lol
---
Of course the new Freddy is coming tomorrow so this will not help with him anymore.
---
Teabagging is annoying and as a survivor I only do it when I want to antagonize a killer to get them to follow me around a loop while my teammates are working on gens or when I'm fucked and I'm going out laughing. That being said it's not that big of a deal, it only looks annoying because there's almost nothing for survivors to do to express themselves in-game.
---
It would have been great if he turned and the last survivor was frozen in shock watching him
---
Am I blind? Where
---
Streaming this game has definitly helped add on to the longevity to the game. 
---
Any night that I am getting more burned out with the game I always have my chat to fall back on and talk to and that really does help out a lot.
---
&lt;3
---
I mean when survivors were doing their little ritual dance and vault noises to let killers knows they found the hatch nobody complained about that.let killers gave their fun now

if you go on the ps4 you will see the community tab click that and just type dead by daylight

I think around 11 AM EST.

Nah man you know people never say their real rank. I’d say 40

Even better! :p

Then you are only a few months away from being where I am which is exciting!

Actually I sent a message in the after game chat about how unfortunate that timing was for him and he was really chill about it!

A pleasant surprise all round

I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, all I’m saying is it’s just as common as butt Dancing and hitting on the hook

This new killer looks great
---
Now you can rejoin society. One step at a time... 8)
---
For Legion specifically I don't think you need enduring and spirit fury as much since Legion's frenzy power lets him vault pallets as fast as a survivor. 
---
I think I like Build 2 the most with build 1 a close second. I would love a build that replaced Discordance with Surveillance, though it may not be worth it to you to level Pig to that point (though I am a Pig main I know she's not for everyone).
---
Cannibal is definitely the smart one to level first (even though I don't like playing as him and usually dump BP from other killers into him).
---
"few" nice one.
---
It is quite daunting to new players but as soon as you find your main it is nice to have your own little corner of survivors/killers you play and enjoy and can branch out from there!
---
So ruin, thantaphobia, monitor, corrupt intervention.
---
Idea 1:
---
Nah, because (1) killers could just camp the engine. (2) If you’re carrying something, you shouldn’t be able to vault or drop pallets which is dumb
---
Idea 2:
---
Nah because (1) So survivors don’t have to do gens, they can just crouch around and hide in lockers until the power station is done? (2) why the wait timer... again survivors can just crouch or wait in lockers... (3) killer can just camp the power station

I was reported for closing the hatch and I was like “dude you were hooked it’s literally just free bloodpoints for me”

Wow that’s really bad yeah. Time to get a new gen color. Or honestly just remove the color in general, I don’t see why you need to have a white aura for his gen teleport, it’s infinite range, and you’re either on cool down or not.

Sadly no.

You can either find yourself by rank or donate to the site to see your personal states.

I've pulled some pretty bad kills on xbox before. Rarely get hate messages
---
Thrilling Tremors works quite nicely. Discordance-wise, multiple people on one generator will do the generator itself slower. So if they're clustered together, all power to 'em.
---
This game has so many characters and just keeps on giving.
---
As stated earlier, the information here was made via testing and through live gameplay experience.
---
You literally do not know what you're talking about.

Which I see as a good thing! It can be daunting for a new player but the amount of content this game puts out is pretty insane for how often it comes out!

The PTB allowed you to chat for one minute after the game ended, after which the lobby was closed for everyone, regardless of who was left. The devs haven't said whether this short time limit will still be in place once they officially roll out.

I think about the hatch every single time I look at this in the spawn room. 
---
Also obligatory I hate you Moira and your stupid inescapable balls of death (okay not really but I do die to those damage orbs an embarrassingly high number of times, they always catch me when I’m so close to getting to a health pack, the salt is real, haha).
---
then why does the wiki say HESL increase by 15%, Intense Halogen  by 20% and Odd Blub by 25%?
---
Does the 2 second effect from the clowns cloud start when it initially effects the person or is it the last moment they are within the clouds radius?
---
This really needs to be an actual game mode
---
Sweet I should be on all night. Just send a friend req on psn when you get on
---
If healthy survivors are body blocking I'll still hit them. Just makes them either have to heal or be one shot later. The only exception is if I think the last gen is about to be done I won't hit them because they'll just get adrenaline.
---
Damn I wish I had the time to do this, would bring such a sense of relief and accomplishment.
---
Since Plague already has incredibly short chases, I don't like to run her with perks like Enduring, Spirit Fury, or Brutal Strength. She doesn't need Exposed effects either so Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground and NOED are all unnecessary as well. I like to run perks that either slow that game down like Ruin, Thanatophobia, Discordance, or Pop Goes the Weasel, or locational perks like BBQ, Whispers, or Surveillance.
---
That does sound more relaxing.
---
How do you see out of it?
---
Voice chat is sorely needed to bridge the gap between swf and solo play. No catch to it please (like need to be within a certain distance). Also let me mute the inevitable assholes
---
Some fucking idiot tried tbagging me infront of a pallet while i played as nurse.
---
They got nae-nae'd
---
Just a reminder that if they treat you like this, they're likely treating other people like this. Not reporting them is just making it easier for them to continue being rude to other people in the future.
---
Ah, meant remove the wait time.
---
Ohhh, or maybe make it so that the survivors work on gens and that feeds the station to a cap, but if no one is working on a gen, the station regressed.
---
HESL, Intense Halogen, and Odd Bulb are recommended add-ons.
---
Playing the game
---
Of course it is. Other games should take notes from this game and how much work they put into it.
---
Billy gets looped and spirit doesnt.  
---
The amount of maps that can screw over billy as well while spirit doesnt give a shit.  Sure, the big maps sucks as a 110 killer but she still has decent mobility with addons. 
---
Billy has his moments where he cam really shine and stomps the game, but spirit has an overall better performance if you look at the bigger picture.
---
Conclusion: spirit &gt; billy without a doubt.
---
Can you link your twitch please? I new to the game and am learning how to loop and distract the killer, so someone with a lot of hours and good gameplay would be helpful. Thank you!
---
I love how even Claudette's scream was like "H-huh?"

Coming from the clown who left the unnecessarily rude initial comment. Buzz off

I haven’t played much since rank reset so 10

lol
---
Right ! I wish we could get a under stuff vault like this ! They also have a geisha killer who can turn mask as a survivor . Kinda surprised they did that before dbd people have been suggesting it .
---
ugh rip :(
---
No, good killers usually know when to break chase to take advantage of another situation, and being toxic is usually just playing or acting in a disrespectful or abusive way
---
Only reason I have been able to do this is because of streaming tbh.

I doubt I would have wanted to 100% this game with how much time it took otherwise but the nice people on Twitch can be super supportive.

yeah I was replying to the guy saying that the addons don't affect duration, even though they do.

Yeah let's just let our friends die on hook. Makes sense. 2 kills isn't even a pip so have fun being rank 20 forever bud. That's the only place where you'll be able to get kills.

I don’t think you understand that just because a perk “can” be used to prevent mindgames doesn’t mean it’s going to
---
You can get there! One bloodweb at a time &lt;3
---
Honestly, this is all I care about. Survivors can suicide on hook as much as they like, for as long as they like; just as long as I get my stack. The amount of petty survivors DCing so you don't get the stack is obscene.
---
Looping isn’t really toxic in itself from where I stand personally. Everyone has their own definition but for me toxic is
---
Shit talking in the chat
---
Body blocking survivors and never hitting them
---
Making them slug to death and closeting the hatch in front of them
---
Flashlight flickering to taunt
---
Tbagging/butt dancing
---
And exploiting bugs
---
Thank you!
---
Who cares, if they wanna Jerk in the hook and end it I’m fine with that! Better than the little shit DC as soon as I put them to the ground and then they DC and I get 625 points verse a hooked survivor and a bbq stack. 
---
Just had a game where a Jane DC since it was her last hook and to give there teammate the hatch quicker, but I was able to hook the Jane before she vanished and then knew where the hatch was, and Nea had a bad time after that...
---
Omce you hit level 50, bloodwebs still generate, the unlocked perk enters the RNG system on whether or not it appears in the bloodweb with the rest of the perks
---
When you mean body blocking do you mean to save teammates?
---
Can confirm, see plenty of these at ranks 4-5 as well. Basically red ranks are infested with them because of how powerful Nurse is atm.
---
And yeah, a little bit of me dies each time I hear that screech sound at the beginning of a match :-(
---
if youre looping as killer yes you are playing ass, patrol your gens or something dude tf? youve been running around that jungle gym for 5 minutes, the claudette is gone
---
They don't. They USED to before the nerf. Stun duration is the same across the board.
---
bHVR's planning in adding an idle character that can be interacted with to replace a disconnecter. You can still down them, and hook them. Even if the player really isnt in the game, you can still get stacks for stuff like bbq and lullaby and stuff.
---
Trapper wastes a lot of time in the early game finding his traps and setting them up, this would let him put his traps in the spots he needs them to be quicker, that’s why some of his best addons are the ones that let him carry more traps as well as have more traps in general
---
That overused reference that 10 people made on this post already?
---
*cough* huntress *cough*
---
Your trapper is looking dapper!
---
Please, last part dont be real...
---
Oh, that's fun. I can't imagine that's coming anytime soon, but still exciting nonetheless.
---
To be fair, this game is a major grind if you don't run bbq and chill I and blood point offerings. If anything it would be more fair
---
no it doesnt show it til it spawns
---
Oh right, you don't need to. You're one of those people that play kyf all day sitting at rank 19 and have no clue what you're talking about. You do know the dbd wiki is run by 1 dude and still hasn't updated everything right? Any bulb or lens add on is 100% useless and does nothing extra against the killer. Believe what you want to cause you're going to anyways. The blindness duration is the same no matter what. Just put batteries or a LAF on. Odd bulb does nothing, halogen does nothing, sapphire does nothing, any lens does nothing.
---
No. Only when it spawns.

Leather Billy is using the "Grease" and "Beast Marks" add ons and ONLY using your chainsaw for mobility and downing people. It results in a chainsaw charge that goes very fast and has a very minimal cooldown. It is very refreshing to play and can be pretty strong at some points!
---
The only times that you cannot do the meme is around shack as that will be an infinite for you if you constantly chainsaw charge.
---
I also enjoy "Jaws Freddy" where you follow around the obsession the entire match while ONLY having Rancor equipped and when all gens get powered you down and mori them. It is really stupid and will make everyone in the match depip but it is just funny to see how survivors react and how some plan to try to evade your rancor. Sadly this won't be as funny with the Freddy change as survivors will be able to see you but "Jaws Wraith" could also be viable. 
---
I have more meme builds but "No Blink Nurse" is always fun. If you run Ruin, NOED, Bloodwarden, and Play With Your Food it can be a pretty fun build to play and a decent way to challenge yourself :p
---
I’m gonna start making a killers rule book for survivors now.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
maybe...
---
Nice I suppose.
---
Not if they're opening with the key, I don't think you'd have the time.
---
You can definitely slam it shut on them if they are just standing at it waiting for it to open the first time, though.
---
The Loud noise ones should be at the top as you can identify them IMMEDIATELY upon the game starting. You might not spawn near a pig box/trap/fountain.

Not sure why you’re getting downvoted, this was a perfect reference to r/woooosh lol

---
Just wanted to give a baby dweet the hatch :(
---
I didn't expect it because of the development history of this game, so I'm not surprised, but I can ensure you I will not be touching mobile with a 10-foot pole because of how grindy the progression system is. I think it is a poor decision to release the mobile version with no cross-progression.
---
He's obviously better than nurse /s
---
Heck yeah. Ghost Face is wonderful, and an absolute treat. Survivors just forget how to play completely when you bring him, for some reason.
---
Bamboozle only applies to one window at a time.
---
Meaning the killer cancels it by jumping through Window B, or goes around the outside around the window, ducks back inside, runs around the counter (the area inside Ormond that also has a vault point) and then makes it upstairs.
---
For stuff like the Storehouse or the Barn they have to actually avoid the interior entirely and loop around half the building to get to the window they couldn't jump through, often losing bloodlust in the process.
---
You could get someone in KYF and try it, you have to leap through the window after the survivor (which cancels Bamboozle on the window you want it on) in order to catch them.
---
if you enjoy being such a dickhead why dont you just go beat up an old lady and go to jail so no one has to deal with your shit anymore?
---
pros: you get to be a dickhead, will probably get lots of hatemail in the form of anal pwnage by bbc, no one has to play with you again
---
cons: your parents will realize how terribly they failed you
---
Not 100% sure
---
Same x)
---
Thank you! Loving the clown right now his movement and vaulting is great
---
What does "mind games" mean?
---
I recently got back into dbd and I’m trying to get the self care teachable. My question is how much blood points would I need from level 1 to 40 for Claudette to get it?
---
I’ve been reported for not getting a kill qas nurse
---
No one cares.
---
It only takes like a one second channel for the killer to open the gate, so no it isn't quicker.
---
Also I suppose OP could have forgotten, but once you start going down hypothetical rabbit trails you risk getting somewhere absurd. :P
---
Honestly, you're coming off as more of an ass than the survivor. You sure that survivor didn't sandbag him? It is pretty frustrating when that happens.
---
Sry i forgot to say i was mobile
---
Spirits better but hillbilly is still undoubtedly the firs best killer and not one to ignore. I love playing as and against hillbilly
---
Complaining about how the other side did what they did, besides using glitches ECT. Don't be afraid to play how you want and don't feel like you need to follow other people's made up rules.
---
I em gona beetu Up NOOB!!!!!!
---
Ace looks rad but his perks kinda suck
---
I don’t think so... I didn’t saw him the whole game sooo
---
I'll rephrase. They are going to say everything you do is toxic so just pick a play style that suits you and ignore what everyone else says. The only things you should not do are lag switching, exploiting bugs or using hacks.
---
It's when you constantly change strategies or do things that are unexpected to throw off your opponents, and force them to second guess themselves, in order to mess up, in your favour
---
It takes about 1.3 million BP in order to get a character from 1-50 so I would say around 1.1-1.2 million will get you there depending on how you spend and what bloodwebs you get.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Okay, let me spell this out for you because you seem to be a little slow: Camping will not get you pips, but it will ruin the game for survivors who you do it to. The only reason to camp is if you want to intentionally ruin a survivors game.
---
&gt;if you enjoy being such a dickhead why dont you just go beat up an old lady and go to jail so no one has to deal with your shit anymore?
---
&gt;

&gt;pros: you get to be a dickhead, will probably get lots of hatemail in the form of anal pwnage by bbc, no one has to play with you again

I’d say a more stealthier but the killer keeps finding me and won’t stop chasing me. Any ideas what perks I should use?

Must’ve been maining Plag huh?

Nice so now spirit players can hear me shit myself
---
For Wounded Healer, do partial heals count? I'm wondering which of the following scenarios help me get the achievement on PS4, assuming I'm injured when I'm healing someone:
---
1.	I find someone injured and heal them from 0-100% myself
---
2.	I find an injured person who’s healing themselves but stops and lets me heal them part of the way
---
3.	I find an injured person and start healing them and another survivor who’s uninjured comes over and helps me heal them
---
4.	I heal someone part of the way before they run away or the killer hits me
---
I know the first one definitely helps you get the achievement but do the rest? I.E. If I heal someone half way then heal another person halfway, do those two halves count as 1? Or if I find someone partially healed do I get credit for my part?
---
Nice "skill" camper
---
Yeah that’s why I’m not going to bother playing it, I already have so many hours on console that it doesn’t make sense to start from scratch
---
what about Ed?
---
Spine chill is my favourite perk. It let's you know when the killer is looking at you so you can have a head start at avoiding the killer.
---
How exactly is Legion good? I've only played them once or twice, and by my understanding, their ability is only good for getting the first hit, then if you try to down them with your power, it fails to down them and you go into power failure animation. How am I supposed to down a survivor if i can't use my catch-up skill?
---
Spine chill is top tier
---
I get one person disconnecting but there are so many tryhards who go all out even with 2 people in the match.   
---
Obviously there’s no rulebook but there’s no real reason to be taking those games seriously
---
Nice save. :/
---
Tbf it’s not wasting your time if they’re actually trying to go for the save. You can blame the survivors but I’d really point the finger at the need for altruism to rank up. Otherwise you safety and get stuck that match.
---
My heart hurts from watching this. Good job dude
---
But you do care. At least enough to leave a comment.
---
Thanks I was wondering where this was from
---
They could just buff killers in response though, this time not annihilating solo balance, isn’t that the whole point of they added chat?
---
Yeah, if you gave him hatch you're the ass
---
No problem ;)
---
Time to bait people over to me while pretending to be another survivor as pig

I really wouldn't list DS or Adrenaline as a crutch and then put an asterisk next to NOED. I guess you haven't played since the DS nerf, and Adrenaline only procs if you're already winning.
---
It's not from BH, don't promote games
---
He isn't a troll, he is Bubba.
---
I'm just saying add it for the sake of it. Proximity limit would be more realistic game wise seeing as people should be able to talk to each other when they're right next to each other ya know? I mean the devs have been doing a pretty good job SO far
---
When you used DS, I was expecting him to force close the game or pull his ethernet cord. Nice job on escaping from him.
---
I’m really getting sick of how many pallets there are, it honestly feels ridiculous and unnecessary. But nurse is definitely still not the only good killer. Other killers are good too, but I think a lot of them deserve some buffs.
---
Nah. Spirit exists.
---
Don't bully Bubba
---
Ive played killer plenty of times looping them and shit i really dont consider bullying its just how you play the game.
---
No sad, Bubba.
---
You don’t have to let us all go, it don’t facecamp us either. I hate the killers that hook you then proceed to make out with you or beat you until you die. And then they act like they played so well or something.
---
How do i find myself or upload myself ?
---
What if DS just didn't work at all unless you were the Obsession?
---
No more four-man DS squads.
---
Exactly! I’m down with that option like Fortnite offers, I wanna be able to communicate and also be able to mute that annoying little kid screaming in the mic
---
I was referencing anchorman
---
Wrong.
---
Bubba is top tier, he can instadown.
---
Tunneling is focusing only on one survivor throughout the game, regardless if there's anyone else nearby.
---
Facecamping is camping too close to the hook.
---
The continual lack of effort is boring. Try again.
---
Stop spamming emojis this is reddit not Snapchat
---
This game was founded on the idea of isolation. Voice chat breaks that, the ONLY reason it should be added is to bridge the gap between solo and SWF. Some dumb limiter making it weaker despite solo ALREADY being at a disadvantage is a slap in the face to many different things.
---
There’s also absolutely nothing immersive about kids screaming at me because they think they’re god at this game.
---
Is it? I tried her about a month ago and even measured out a crosshair to see and it seemed like 2-4 inches off on a 32". But I rarely play her. Still good to know theyve improved it.
---
[I know I haven’t been really really kind but when you get a lot of survivors just sending messages to you because they are not happy it’s really not fun. If you’re not happy with this post then just ignore it. Thanks.]
---
I got reported just yesterday for winning a game as survivor. No t-bagging or flashlights involved or looping.
---
I just stealthed gens and walked right da fuq out.
---
Apparently he wanted 4k and I didn't let him win so I'm the bad guy.
---
Then there's all the times I've just played my killer main Doctor......... In the last week I've supposedly been reported 10+ times. When I ask why they just say " ur TRASH bro"
---
Honestly I’d love a flashlight addon rework
---
Quentin, Tapp, or Jeff are the rarest
---
#WhereAreTheAceMains 👉🏻👉🏻
---
I have to relearn him
---
DUDE I was scrolling through Amazon Prime last night and saw this on there. I was like whoa what? 
---
Glad I'm not the only one who got a chuckle.
---
Ahh, thank you
---
Yes and new freddy will be much better than current freddy
---
First stop ya fragility and I will .
---
Yes I play that is fun as well !
---
Give me a few hours to come up with some new material though, okay?
---
I don't think so
---
And don't forget that according to BHVR, two kills = win, even if the third survivor makes it to the hatch or out the gate, you've still gotten two kills through camping in the above scenario.
---
People keep quoting BHVR on that to justify Killers not getting 4K or Survivors not getting 4 escapes, that 2 kills is a victory, end of discussion.
---
Although it is really scummy to camp just because you can.
---
what happened? I thought they originally said at the end of June?
---
If ur not interested play killer or play a different game
---
I love that final point "Yeah that's right, you run off now!"
---
That doesn’t make sense mate that’s a adjective not a noun
---
I’m not it’s just annoying to get emoji spam
---
What are they suppose to do? Let you hook and kill them? What would happen if they didn't rush gens then if you get a few hooks and kills are you gonna let them do gens so you dont kill rush? tf lol
---
Poor Billy he just wanted to win :(
---
The shared item/add-on inventory on mobile would be super awkward to translate into a cross-save. And then there's the fact that mobile progression is about 10x faster than console/pc-- as someone who is new to both if cross-saves existed I wouldn't touch the PC version for months lol
---
r/gatekeeping
---
I doubt it. You already seem to lack ability to troll properly.
---
What's her buff?
---
at this point you might as well screenshot a minecraft trap door
---
Maybe you should post a thread about it.
---
Hatch spawns are predetermined at the start of the game. If you walk within tracking range of the hatch with a map that can track it, you'll receive map scout points for it. However, you cannot actually view the hatch's aura until it has spawned.
---
This is known and intentional. It's considered part of the skillset of breaking this loop, just like skipping the edges of holes.
---
this is a shitpost right?
---
the accuracy one makes a difference if you're injured
---
Is this is it? This what youre going with? I expected better.
---
They would have mentioned Xbox as well if there was a problem on there as well, right?
---
They’re not ready yet. Dude its been 3 years, a few more months won’t kill you.
---
Using perks and add ons and characters that I spent valuable Bloodpoints on is toxic amirite?
---
The only perk I hate is NOED. Literal crutch.
---
It doesn't matter if you're a killer main. You're trying to control other people's lives. If you have a problem, complain to behavior about the game that they made, or if you don't like it stop playing. They have said numerous times it's allowed and it's a strategy. I've seen tunnelers and campers 4k a lot of times on streams, it's viable, doesn't make you shitty, and is perfectly justifiable within the game.
---
You a special one aren't you? If there is a hole in the killer's hook patrol he isn't camping. Borrowed time doesn't matter when the killer is just going grab the rescuer off of the hook. You must be really bad to have to justify camping in order to get 2 kills.

Some people are hoping they get rid of Bloodlust, which honestly disturbs me.
---
  
---
They're working one map, and the survivor can already "escape" the chase while in full view and sprinting, or turn the corner and it drops as you turn it even though you're still following their scratchmarks.
---
I feel like if a killer can see scratchmarks, the chase should continue no matter how far away or out of LOS the survivor is, because you still know where they are and where they're going (and usually exactly where they are, some chases will drop when you're two seconds from hitting them).
---
More pallets is going to be a pain too, especially if killers are made slower.

Yeah, it was a dumb change they made when they did end game collapse.

I play smoking a cig a lot of the time. It really sucks on console because of holding the controller with one hand doesn't work very well when that DING hits.
---
It's alright better than when I nearly burned my dick off when miss piggy attacked unexpectedly.
---
\^\^\^ Fixed the whole masturbating problem - Just burn your dick off while getting ravaged by miss piggy. 
---
Carry on.
---
You know damn well that even just patrolling the hook counts as camping to people who like to whine about this sort of thing, which is a category of people that you clearly fall under. Borrowed time does work when more than one person is running it. Just wait for the killer to grab the first rescuer, then the second rescuer has plenty of time to unhook.
---
I don't have to justify camping because it's not against the rules. You people just act like it's a crime against humanity to make someone on the opposite team lose the game. It's pretty sad that you have to rely on insults to try and win an argument since all of your points are flawed.
---
Am I the only one hearing about bamboozle being broken or OP for the first time?

Who the hell has been complaining

I didn’t know it was 10x faster. That sounds like an interesting way to go at it.
---
Can I make this cringe?
---
You could hear it lmao
---
That's blood wardens job.
---
This game has no dead zone, so if either of the sticks are even slightly off-center, it'll constantly detect input from it. Best option is to unplug the controller while playing, or see if your controller has a built-in dead zone adjustment.
---
I've been maining Doctor for Killer out of pure fun. He's so great to play and has enough diversity in cosmetics that he's aesthetically pleasing as well. He blows hot ass on most maps, though. Doc fans out there, how do you do it? I'm currently running BBQ and some stuff that helps me have a huge terror radius, but it isn't that great when it comes to maps like Coldwind.
---
I refuse to let my love for the Doctor die, so any tips would be great.
---
You really saving that sprint burst huh?

I love that stupid cat's face so much
---
10x might be a slight exaggeration but I, according to my phone, only have about 3 1/2 hours in the game and I have Meg at 40 and I'm about 6 levels from snagging bond off Dwight. And my surv inventory is stacked with ~20 games worth of items/offerings.
---
Nope.
---
I’d say run Spirit Fury And Bamboozle with Ruin and Enduring. Add on Iridescent Button and anything else and you’re solid.
---
Nah, we don't need nazis and nazi sympathizers in this community.
---
&gt;What makes a gen/pallet/window a "safe" one?
---
A safe generator is one nearby resources that survivors can use in chases, so it the killer comes by you can easily run to a pallet or window.
---
A safe pallet is a pallet that, once thrown, creates an area of the map where it is so difficult for the killer to hit you it is nearly impossible. You could stay around it and be safe unless playing against the spirit or the nurse who can teleport around the pallet.
---
For example, the "God pallet" which spawns in the killer shack (the building with two doors, one window, one pallet, and can sometimes have the basement inside). when this pallet is thrown, if the killer doesnt kick it, the survivor can very easily keep vision of the killer and use the pallet and window to vault safely away from them no matter what they do.
---
Safe pallets are safe because they connect very long walls that it would take a very long time for the killer to run around. By the time the killer runs to the side where they threaten you, you can easily just vault the pallet to the other side.
---
Unsafe pallets connect walls that are not very long. At short walls, the killer can "mind game" the pallet by faking like they are going to run one direction and baiting the survivor into vaulting the pallet. Then as soon as the survivor commits to vaulting, the killer can switch directions and meet them at the other side of the pallet to hit them.
---
Some pallets connect walls that are so short that the pallets are nearly useless in certain circumstances. Running to these pallets and throwing them without landing a stun on the killer can leave survivors trapped. If they leave the pallet they have too far to run before the killer lands a hit. If they stay at the pallet vaulting back and forth, the killer will eventually land a hit unless they make a big mistake and give the survivor time to run to a different pallet or window. 
---
You can look up YouTube guides which show examples of safe and unsafe pallets. Over time and experience you will gain a sense of what pallets can be mind gamed, and what pallets block your path so completely that you have to just kick them as soon as they are thrown.
---
Wish I could do this but I just got the game and have no blood points for anything :(

Jesus, this sub’s meme and shitpost game is off the charts!
---
Pallets have a limit on how many can spawn so if a bunch of them are in one area that probably means every other area is just a dead zone it's more so what the pallets spawn that make them feel limitless.

Dude I was giving suggestions not everyone is trying to attack you

Freddy is to good ^_^ and now commit lego brick
---
I really like playing wraith and I hate playing against him.  
---
Survivors do not/barely see you coming and I feel stealth is really strong in this game as a killer.  
---
How do you play properly against stealth/low terror radius killers? I can’t seem to consistenly play against it.  
---
Is it common that newer players will talk about stealth and how it’s strong?  
---
I’ve watched a tier list and pretty much all the stealth killers are not that good? Wraith, freddy pre rework, pig, ghostface(?)  
---
I feel like wraith’s biggest weakness is pallet looping(I find this difficult to deal with in general. both as killer and survivor) and that he doesn’t have an offensive ability. Please correct me if I’m wrong as I’m still a new player.  
---
Please educate me on how to properly play this killer. I really like playing him, but hearing that he’s not very good at the moment puts me off a bit.  
---
Any particular builds? I only have Myers unlocked and bamboozle from the shrine.  
---
Eventually I want to get the other killers and their respective perks, but for now I’m looking for a more common build.   
---
TL;DR: Help me play (against) wraith
---
Maybe because they’re a one time use and some potato survivors just waste them before the killer can catch up
---
Ah, yes, the millionaire whose parents gave him $300k to start an LP channel, is the true victim of the mosque shooting.

I'm saying he's a nazi. When you spend significant time and money to boost and spread neo-nazi ideology, dogwhistles, outright propaganda, and figureheads, it's safe to say it's intentional.
---
This is awesome! What's your twitch?
---
What is the legion bug ?
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I agree.  If there's a save to be had, that's one thing.  If they're healing each other for extra BP, also fine.
---
The scenario I'm talking about is all four are at gate, sitting around until you get close, then they'll finally leave.
---
Yeah
---
Yes.
---
If it means I don't have to face a continuous stream of Nurses and Spirits in red ranks then so be it, bring on the scissor fingers.
---
Generally it is between 9am and 11am EST
---
Who said that I like to whine about camping? Patrolling a hook every once in a while is perfectly fine, especially if you know multiple survivors are coming to rescue. And sorry, guess I should just always play in a 4 stack of SWF who all run borrowed time... that's clearly the counter play there. If the killer grabs an unlocking survivor then that is a free hook for the killer. It doesnt matter if you immediately unhook the other survivor, the killer hasn't lost anything and has hooked an extra survivor.
---
And if you seriously think that you aren't a scumbag for camping you have a serious problem with your mentality on life (You aren't a good person if you screw other people over for your own benefit). You haven't pointed out a single flaw in any of my arguments that I haven't had a good rebuttal for, so I have no clue why you would imply the only thing I have done is call you names.
---
Maybe we aren't talking about the same thing, but when I say camping, i mean travelling no more than maybe 15 feet from the hook for the entire time the survivor is on it. It sounds like you seem to think camping is patrolling the hook and maybe a few close by generators, in which case I'm fine with that. But my definition of camping is by no means acceptable. I don't care if it's not against the rules, it's a scummy thing to do and isn't fun for anybody.
---
Don't patrol gens during EGC, no. You should definitely patrol the area around the hook, though. There's no reason to just let them get a save. As long as you're not in their face at the hook, whatever. Survivors would be stupid to think you're gonna walk away completely when they're obviously going to go for the save. Half the time you can walk away for five seconds, turn around, and they're already being pulled off the hook.
---
Basically, don't face camp. It's cheap and no fun for the survivors. Don't gimp yourself either. You'll probably find someone waiting for you to bail if you patrol while someone is hooked.
---
 I would also like to see ghostface
---
Last week I watched a bricky video on ghostface me baking a ghostface main and not finding any other ghostface videos. He brought up a very good point that Hex:the third seal would be pretty useful for ghostface and decided to wait for it in the shrine because I didn’t want to get and level up hag, then of course a day later it goes into the shrine when I have 54 iridescent shards
---
This wouldn't be fair if u consider the staggering of a survivor without balanced landing . And u shouldn't be able to hit dudes that are beneath u .
---
r/woooosh
---
Sounds like another map that would be awful for the huntress.
---
The legion would be dope
---
Few days ago I apparently got reported for not finding a killers NOED when I had Small Game and 2 people had died due to the NOED lol
---
The main issue I have is it happening the exact second someone is hooked completely blocking out the warning or the exact second I get off the gen
---
we all now it would be so bad looking it will literally make are eyes bleed
---
Nasty+filthy blade made the mending time get longer and longer each time you had to mend
---
What’s the sprint burst glitch ?
---
Which one
---
Which one are you talking about OP this is important
---
Well Ace is good for farming items otherwise his perks are not really good
---
Are you sure we're talking about the same thing? Because when I say camping I mean making it so there is no way to rescue a survivor without getting grabbed out of the rescue. Proxy camp all you want, at least the survivor who is hooked has a chance at surviving, but hard camping a survivor just makes you a shitty person because you are sacrificing other people's fun just so you can get a kill.
---
Man you’re good af keep up the good work!
---
/r/samespecies ?
---
Ah shoot, can't help you on that one. Sorry
---
That takes all the fun out of bringing a mori and killing them all the survivors can just bully the killer until someone has been sacrificed and they can just flash save for a while until the jockey has done all gens and you didn't mori anyone moris should not be adjusted so survivors can have easy games this also encourages camping and tunnels so a killer can get his mori  imo moris are the pettiest thing to complain about

Uhhh, what's the suggestion then?
---
Well nurse is still best it Just  got a huge skill gap
---
It's meg jake claudette or dwight
---
Those survivors that you call potatoes may waste the pallets, but it doesn’t really matter because it won’t be hard for them to find another one since there are so many. And they can be used more than once, unless the killer breaks it, which would give the survivor more than enough time to run to another pallet. It’s a complete nightmare
---
It doesnt matter anymore you already out ruled the killer
---
It's hilarious how bugs on MOBILE are the same as console and pc

you're right, i'm fucking slow today

how are youa ble to track your bp?
---
Right back at ya!

Check ping before a game and if it’s high leave. Also dedicated servers eventually, so you have something to look forward to.
---
You'll be happy with sg tomorrow playing against all those freddys knowing which pallets are fake.
---
ooo if they add it in officially then SWF is being buffed (even though everyone already uses discord etc)... so killer buff coming hahaha can't wait.
---
I hear you bud, this game is frustrating. But it goes both ways.
---
Looks like I can stop waiting for a purple Balanced Lansing on my P3 Feng and move on with life lmao. I just thought I was super unlucky
---
the game balance would benefit the survivors, however this means killers will get buffed and when you get to red ranks its usually 4 man on comms SWF anyway so.
---
Finally my time has come to be a killer main again.
---
I say patrolling is camping because that's what everyone who's ever accused me of camping says. But if we're talking about facecamping, I still think there's nothing wrong with that. The killer is not entitled to kill any one if he can't catch them. Likewise, survivors are not entitled to survive if they can't escape the killer.
---
If being camped at the hook is enough to ruin someone's game, they should probably play a different game. No one's obligated to play in a way that doesn't hurt your feelings. If you don't want to die, don't get caught by the killer. It's really that simple.
---
It's really laughable that you want to say I'm a bad person because I'm killing people in a game where I'm playing as the, you know, *killer*. As for the borrowed time thing, you really don't even need it. If one persons being facecamped and there are still 3 survivors, 2 of them can just body block while the other one rescues. There are multiple ways to counter camping, you're just not very imaginative.
---
thanks for the info : )
---
Oh come on I'd love to hear that. People just shrieking as they're being Mori'd or something.

I'm trying ok
---
Quentin, most people think he's ugly + no real cosmetics. Mediocre perks on top of it.
---
Thanks. I was a Billy main at launch so I p3'ed him, but since he's easy to master I wanted to play more complicated killers. Right now my go-to-killers are Spirit, Legion, Myers, Pig, Hag and Trapper.
---
its not the ping honestly I have ran into a lot of lag switchers on dbd on ps4 but ya you are right the dedicated servers should stop that
---
I have played since DS nerf, and I guess I was still thinking about old DS
---
You think anyone scrolling through reddit is gonna watch a 13 min video?
---
Lag switching is REALLY uncommon on PS4. I’ve also found that PS4 games have worse ping. Check the ping in the lobby if you wanna avoid lagging in game. Making sure it’s not 1) high or 2) bouncing around a lot.

---
I didn’t understand a single word but cool!
---
I mean survivors sorta do need them or else you would be able to knock them down to easier and windows get blocked off so without those pallets being a killer would be way to easy
---
They are going to be hell, and of course that’s my one day off and I’ll probably only play 2 games as Freddy. They were really bad when ghost face came out so I’m sure they will be just as bad if not worse.
---
Also I’m sorry for all the survivors out there who have to vs Freddy for like a week straight
---
Yeah but it seems way more leaned towards the killers. I understand it’s a 4v1 game but holy crap dude, some of this shit is so unbalanced
---
Console nurses are as brutal as pc nurses. Iam a console nurse. Dont nerf her pls
---
It can be a bit confusing, my advice would be to Google it
---
Outside of certain outliners (The Game, Ormond, Cowshed) the number of pallets per map is pretty reasonable.
---
When you are playing vs killers that know how to loop, you'll quickly notice how fast you can burn through the pallets. It is important that you use windows properly to extend the life of every pallet as much as possible. If you throw them too quickly you will create massive death zones early in the match.
---
The most awful spot you can be as survivor is the killer 3 genning an area that has no pallets left up.
---
Keep in mind that if you are in an area that has a lot of pallets, that means the other parts of the map have way, way fewer pallets as each map has a total "budget" of pallets it can spawn.

Rip if it was a Jane you were definitely going for ass
---
I'm not crying about NOED, and I certainly never said BBQ was OP, but they're very strong killer perks
---
Your reading comprehension could use some work btw
---
There’s not really that many tbh like the amount of pallets that are in games nowadays is nothing in comparison
---
You get insta killed as the last survivor so there is no chance to attempt to unhook yourself
---
Activate ability, hit everyone you can find, and then “focus” on the last person you hit everyone else has to stop and mend or they die, keeps them off gens for 20-30 seconds

He’s perk reliant, I found him fun yes, but winning zero games, maybe one kill at best, using nurse perks help
---
Thanataphobia once you hurt everyone to slow their action speeds
---
Ruin, to slow the game down... Just a little bit👌🏻
---
Nurses calling To find their asses mending/healing
---
And the one wraith perk that keeps scratch marks around longer, that way you can track them down after your ability ends 
---
That’s at least what I run and what I find yields better success
---
Oh shit wrong video
---
What about trappy boy? Maybe you could illuminate the mouth part of the mask or something
---
One guy reported me because the good skill checks took off progress to the gens, i was running Ruin, this was in green ranks.
---
Personally, i would also throw on ruin, surveillance, and overcharge. Being able to see when a gen is being worked on, and making it harder for them to be completed would give you directions on where to go and a bit more control on the game. At least, that's what I do and I enjoy it.
---
BM is what doesn't affect the game, Toxicity is how scummy a player plays.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
It's the Nightmare reborn, baby. Freddy games increased by 99% for the next few days before Nurse, Billy, and Spirit come back.
---
Well most of the killers have movement abilities like the chainsaw or the nurses blinks. What I’m specifically talking about is that shitty Myers perk that gives them just extra movement speed in general. And then the stupid insta down shit shouldn’t be there. Yes there is stuff like adrenaline for survivors or the septic bottles for medkits but that doesn’t compensate for those perks. What’s the point of running away from a killer if they’re literally on your ass. If you throw down a pallet, oh well cause he’s gonna hit you cause the shitty hit box. Oh you wanna vault over a window, nah fam, I’m too fast, I’m just gonna pull you off of that. That’s so stupid.
---
oh.. good! Thanks for telling me that
---
Hard tunneling, camping, and whiffing on 10 m1 attacks. 
---
Next.
---
Kinda wish they’d give trapper some love and buff him
---
This change makes little sense. If you limit the tokens, that means not only do you now get less maximum potential cooldown reduction, but hitting the Obsession will still consume the same portion of tokens (2 of 4 is the same as 4 of 8; 2 of 6 for the tier 2 version would leave you with 2 tokens after hitting the Obsession twice, but as can current-STBFL tier 2 - then, again, with the bonus of being able to stack up to 8). The percentage decrease for tiers makes more sense, but I still don't see a buff in it: the maximum power of the perk is reduced, only for you to lose less power when hitting your Obsession, which is not only proportionally less-significant (the less a token is worth, the less difference losing tokens makes), but it's something you can just avoid doing. I don't think going from 40% possible reduction to 24% or 32% only to lose marginally less % on avoidable Obsession hits is worth it, and is akin to a nerf rather than a buff. Currently, if you hit your Obsession twice with tier 2 STBFL, you can be left with two tokens, or 10% cooldown reduction; with this version, you would be left with 4 tokens, albeit only worth 4% each, meaning 16% reduction - a 6% difference, losing however 8% possible maximum reduction; for tier 1, you would be left with 12% more cooldown reduction after hitting the Obsession twice, albeit losing 16% possible maximum reduction - yet again not a favorable trade-off.
---
That said, I never really cared about lower-tier perk balancing, personally: it's a Quality-of-Life thing that doesn't affect higher-level gameplay and balance whatsoever because for that only the tier 3 versions matter. Perk tiers should just be removed altogether, IMO, lessening the grind. And perks should be buffed altogether, many of which are bad even at tier 3... STBFL is not bad, but could still do with a neat buff, like increasing its maximum possible tokens to 10.
---
I have been facecamped and I don't get triggered by it because I'm aware that it's just part of the game, and also because I'm not overly sensitive to things that happen to me in a video game. I know I'm not good at playing survivor, and I probably deserve to die for my lack of skill.
---
It's the same thing when I play killer and get dominated by some SWF squad. I accept it and move on to the next game instead raging about how "unfair" it was. You and I clearly disagree, and there's nothing wrong with that. The problem arises when you think you can force people who disagree with you to adhere to your playstyle because you think your playstyle is morally superior. It's a video game, get over yourself. See ya.
---
holy shitty titty in a barrel that’s good
---
That Rein that solo ulted my coalescence? Boom, fade out.
---
Yeah I know lol I'm just a lil disheartened that's all.
---
Get good.
---
could wait until a double bloodpoint event again more ppl will farm then. you could also just tell them you just need hatched from far away and they can do the gens and shit
---
Well thank god that some areas will end up with less pallets as a result.
---
So what, I know how to play the game. I’m pretty damn good at it, but even if I was shit at the game, that doesn’t mean the perks aren’t broken. Shit like that needs to be nerfed
---
Lmao I really was about to leave! They wouldn't go away
---
Build nr 1, standard m1 killer build - BBQ, enduring, Ruin, Spirit fury.
---
If you don't like Ruin because it's a boring perk to use (which it is to me) take pop goes the weasel instead. Way more fun to use.
---
Spirit fury can be switched to Brutal strength, both help you with dealing with pallets.
---
Build nr 2 is a slugging build. Infectious fright, monitor &amp; abuse, knockout and Ruin.
---
Your plan is to sick everyone so they are 1 hit. Infectious fright work well with knockout since you can go to another person right after downing someone and the person that got downed won't be getting up for a while.
---
Monitor and abuse will make your terror radius bigger when in chase (and when you down the survivor) so you will catch more people with infectious fright.
---
cause it is a instant kill when last I do agree that you should still be able to try to kobe off and shit but eh
---
At least there are offerings that can decrease the amount of hooks. Nothing exists like that for pallets.
---
Why do you say that?
---
I am good.
---
Ok. Thanks
---
You dropped survivor number 2 before seeing #3 and camped the hook
---
the game would die so fast
---
Clear sight should probably have a amount of time the survivors are revealed
---
“People play with friends and that makes me mad”
---
Just play ghostface 4head
---
Doubtful. You either A.) Only play survivor. Or B.) You just suck.
---
I don't want to spend $5 on a killer I don't like
---
I will miss old Freddy dearly as he was pretty damn fun even got him to Prestige 2,glad they reworked though he'll be much better at higher ranks offering more variety then hillbilly,Nurse,Spirit.
---
It was from last night but sadly can’t remember which weapon she was using but if it was you then gg!
---
This is funny, I like it
---
How is your mental state
---
There’s a very easy solution to SWF. Make it so they get matched vs a killer with the same rank as the highest ranking member of the group. Right now, it seems like it averages out everyone’s rank and that’s trash
---
No, I play killer too and I shit on everybody. Why? Because killers are busted.
---
Clear Sight would require a cooldown imo, it would work really well for a anti-loop build too.
---
Altruistic Support is too strong as the 150% movement is just a free sprint burst, Borrowed Time exists for this reason.
---
Only the toxic pain in the asses would leave, making the game better.
---
Or they can just do ranked and unranked. Ranked allows parties of 2 and unranked can be the 4 man.
---
That would work until you get to higher ranks where everyone is equal
---
The guide was probably made before the Endgame Collapse existed. Back then, yes, traps in the late game were good. Now, not so much.
---
I wish they’d show a lot more killers some love 😢
---
Killers are far from busted. There's only two killers in the game that have no limit to what they can do. Unlike the rest.
---
Higher ranked killers are more equipped to handle SWF.
---
The skill required to red rank killer is **far** higher than the skill to red rank survivor
---
Your sacrifice is a risk i’m willing to take!
---
I think 3 is a nice round number. I’m the original Jeff main but i love running around killerinos with Dwighty and Ace-ypoo...
---
If you were actually as good as you think you are you wouldn’t be complaining about the perks you are complaining about especially play with your food. You don’t know much about the balance of this game which is fine but none of the perks you are talking about need nerfs you just need to get better. 
---
Also skill does matter when talking about balance
---
downvoting mother f******s
---
no idiot what's it called
---
I guess you got a point. I'm not red rank so I wouldn't know
---
I use Kate, Jane and Bill. I use the same perk loadout across them all so it took a while to get all the teachables. But now I got the exact loadout I want so I can swap between them when I want a change of appearance.
---
not really ppl play with survivor with friends because its fun to play with friends if they forced it so you have to play solo to rank or get bloodpoints the game would die. the only reason why this game even became so popular is because of swf and we prob would not have as many license killers like ghost face leather boy.
---
It’s one of the only means of defence. You want an easy game go play that janky dead before daylight on mobile, otherwise stop bitching about what few fair aspects of the game we have because you had a few bad runs
---
Accurate af
---
my ghostface to my nurse lol
---
Survivor is pretty easy so there’s not a “best” player. 
---
I’d throw my vote in for Zubat being the best killer in the game.
---
He’s probably like a rank 10
---
You could also go to the dbd forums they have a section that says looking for players and you click the PS4 tab and voila you found it! You can also make a post on Reddit.
---
More than likely.
---
Oh man, I had a killer dc almost immediately today. I spawned with someone else and we quickly knocked out a gen. Simultaneously the other two survivors must have done the same thing. So like 1.5 minutes in and only 3 gens to go.
---
In low ranks quinton in high ranks lauri because people usually get focused as her because her perks are the best (I mean like as a set)
---
WHEN PEOPLE DO THIS AND START FAST VAULTING IT I GET HOMICIDAL
---
Scott Jund is probably the best, wonderful streams too!
---
Seeing freddy in the roster is what made me buy this game.
---
Then i found out he sucks lol
---
People DC and kill themself to Nurse.
---
Well survive with friends drive killers away, so either way people stop playing. That's just how online games work. But also I think making people play solo would improve their skills and learn how to not rely on their rank 1 friends.
---
You DO realize SWF makes up a pretty decent size of the player population? Not allowing people t play with their friends would hurt the game ALOT. Like me and my friends who just play for fun would be hurt because of some other assholes? this game would drop SO many players
---
I mean for it to be a side grade to borrowed that can work for both campers and non campers with different effects. I do think the percent should be 130% movement though.
---
The devs just need to add a totem counter.
---
I've been saving my final prestige for the rework release for months now.
---
Goodbye pre rework Freddy, I really will miss you and the difference in matches that you brought to the game. 
---
Thanks for the memes
---
Interesting concepts, a lot of the numbers would have to be significantly tweaked.
---
Should have replaced it with the faces of the fog whisperers and their friends. Would have been a whole lot funnier.
---
With BL the two story houses are very safe. If the killer is chasing you through the house you can vault the upstairs window, drop down to the ground, and run back into the house. If the killer follows you through the window you have enough time to run back upstairs and vault the window again. If the killer doesn't vault behind you, you just peace out to another house. 
---
Its not a true infinite, but if the killer commits to the chase long enough to actually down you, hes wasted enough time that it might as well be.
---
I only play Feng. I’ll only ever play Feng. The good thing about that is I have much less cosmetics to get than if I had more than one survivor I played.
---
Yeah right
---
Counterpoint: if I'm playing as Spirit, I can't imagine Billy singing the Teriyaki Boyz song from Tokyo Drift to himself as he rounds a corner at full speed
---
Ah, some people post wanting loads of reddit points from it
---
i like it BTW
---
The pallets and hooks were changed to have a set number spawn on each map, but the amount can never be changed. Just where they spawn, and how far apart they spawn from each other.
---
Get over it
---
Idk I haven’t played it lmao
---
Gays be like: Slay yasss sksksksks sis honey Quentin looks so cute uwu owo ayaya let me smash 
---
Me: tf dude .___.
---
Haddonfield and Abbitoir are the only ones left in the game.
---
When will the Freddy rework drop on console?
---
Just bloodpoints.
---
I say give killers a 25% bloodpoint bonus per SWF is its at least a 3 man or more. 2 mans really arent bad, its when 3 of them come it can be bad
---
Then why do you say people don't dc to Nurse
---
So... more lubricant?
---
r/wooshedwoosher
---
You only lose if your team is not being very efficient. Or you have the bad luck of running into one of those Freddys who focus down survivors instead of spreading the damage out.
---
I guess Demi is making a second part of his video.
---
As a survivor I an dreading this a lot. I already really suck at countering freddy and kinda hate when i hear the lullaby and hes only gonna be even harder to beat and everyone will be playing him. Getting my last non freddy matches in tonight.
---
Play however you want mate, it’s a game, have fun with it. If you let other people dictate how you play, you are no longer playing for your own amusement, but for others. That aside, that is a very common strategy to use as a killer to help push the game into your favor. If they put themselves into that position it’s purely on them. “3 genning” them is on of the best ways to clutch up a game since the only way to make progress against you is to face you head on where you are your strongest.
---
I always get freddies that do tunnel one player and theyre good af too
---
Ebonies on anyone that is half decent at killer is a gg. To be able to kill 4 survivors, you should have to hook them twice first, but keep the other two as one hook.
---
People will call anything that gives the other team an advantage. Camping, looping, funneling, addons and items all are used to win the game so these are not toxic (even though people who don’t know how to counter them will say otherwise) stuff like taunting and disrespecting are what is toxic.
---
Billy gets looped. If you know how to loop his instadown is meaningless, since he'll never be able to use it on you. You force him to m1, now he's an m1 killer.
---
His mobility doesn't matter if he gets looped and "contained" in one part of the map. Billy is only good against survivors that are less experienced and can't loop too well. Against good survivors Billy gets destroyed. 
---
Spirit doesn't get looped. A Spirit that knows what she's doing will get guaranteed hits on cooldown, as survivors' ability to loop doesn't matter against her, her power ignores loops.
---
Sure, she doesn't have an instadown, but she gets hits on good survivors way more reliably than Billy.
---
In both cases im talking about base kits, tho with even their best add ons Spirit is still better.
---
Hi there mires
---
The Bieber
---
&gt;No, man  
---
*You have the softest*
---
Yeah, a good amount of people who occasionally play Freddy tend to tunnel people. Freddy mains will never do that because they actually know how to efficiently play him.
---
What makes HESL better then Intense Halogen? 
---
Is the additional blind time from Odd Bulb worth the efficiency debuff?
---
Sorry not here to give survivors an easy win. That Kate should have been looking for the hatch that way she could just jump in as soon as her dumb teammates die.
---
I didn't do him because these are all based on a wallpaper featuring the trapper and they're based off that style, so it feels redundant to do one for him but I might: https://wallpapercave.com/w/wp2222317
---
I’m down to jam with you.
---
PSN ID: The_Slave_One
---
Also, she doesn't want to be toxic and leave her teammate to die. If the only way you don't give the survivors an "easy win" is to camp, then I hope you get a sweaty swf group every match.
---
Play with your food? Nerf? HAHAHAHAHA
---
Thanks! I’ll keep going. I love passionate comments like this.
---
Any new achievement?
---
Any killer with insidious:
---
I see them every 3rd game around red ranks.
---
&gt;and even when they do I just play safer and I'm fine lmao
---
Yeah dude just never get found and if you do just don't get tunneled you'll be fine. Ez pz fair offering.
---
I wonder how fine would you be with an offering that lets you get out of the killer's grasp twice per match, and an ultra rare version of that offering that allows every survivor in the match to get out of the killer's grasp for free twice.
---
OP obviously isn’t very experienced/good at the game. It won’t let me reply to one of their replies for some reason, but they said they camped so the last survivor couldn’t find hatch? 
---
Bruh. It’s impossible to find hatch when 5 gens are left and all 4 people are alive
---
Yeah, the things that are everywhere in the map
---
They should have given the spooky flashlight 13 seconds of use or 6.66 seconds of use. Would have made it more spooky!
---
Lol oh waa waa! That's all I hear right now. You arent helping your teammates by going on a suicide mission and making bad saves
---
I don't think Ivory is fair. It should at least be a death hook mori so that the survivor has a chance.
---
You’re just an awful killer. Just....awful..
---
Cyprus Momento Mori the most fair offering in the game. You are one ignorant Survivor main.
---
i have 4 of both ultra rare addons, like 2 ebony moris, and a shit ton of other add ons, and am ready to prestige him with about 500k blood points (im on my xbox account and have only had the game on xbox for about 2 or 3 months and have been upgrading every killer)
---
This is the pinnacle of this Reddit!
---
play something else for like a week
---
You’re just an epic person, just epic
---
I disagree, it denies use of DS for someone who got tunneled after their 2nd hook, it denies possible help from the team via flashlights/bodyblocking the hook/sabotaging a hook.
---
It's powerful enough to warrant an offering.
---
*god pallet music stops*
---
“Escape tim——EHHHHAAAAAAAH!!! GET OUT! GET OUT! WRONG HOLE! WRONGHOLE!!!
---
me
---
Jake and ace
---
Zubatlel imo.
---
I would find that kid and kill him IRL to give him his dying light
---
Well at least you’re finally right about something
---
Promotes tunneling and rarely ever works unless you facecamp/tunnel, by then all the gens will have popped. Pretty terrible perk in general.
---
Yes’ir
---
[anger]
---
He may be fun but he's definitely very low tier.
---
I got that too
---
Lmao, maybe in rank 20.
---
No worry’s I have like a few hundred flashlights with add Ons between all of my survivors! I suck horribly with a flashlight and never use them. Way to hard and I give mad props to the guys on PS4 who pull those mad flashlight saves off like no tomorrow! Seen a guy stop the killer the hole game from picking any of us up and then dictate the tempo of the game with the killer. It was a very long match because the Clown wanted that Nea badly and she never teabagged once.
---
It lets you mori the last guy alive in the match. What is not fair about this?
---
It's a mori that exists for the fun of moring someone, has to be earned by killing everyone in the match, isn't expensive. What's unfair about it?
---
I feel like people say this for most female characters unless the devs specifically make them ugly
---
Well every time someone plays it and i am the obssesion i end up moried after the Killer camps me .
---
I'd do anything for this map not to appear again on my life.
---
I can say that Iplay to have fun,and I have the least fun agains Plague, alegion, and pre rework Freddy.
---
r/justsurvivorthings
---
Telling you right not that if a wraith has windstorm and a survivor is camping the safe palette he will cloke break the pallet and hit you
---
are wash
---
Pallet efficiency
---
Legion, Plague, and pre rework Freddy are not fun to play against.
---
It'd be so cool if BHVR added SCP killers into the game.
---
What survivor/killer did you use to grind away for the bloodpoints?
---
No doubt. I’m just not sure how they could go about buffing him though
---
You can always report the message from the person
---
Most killers are fine where they are at, people think nurse/spirit/billy is where every killer should be and that isn't true.

I don’t know anybody who runs (real) ranks without add ons.

When i play survivor my mains are, Ash, Nea, David, Tapp, Laurie

L4D? What’s that

Wait dedicated servers are out

Losewise is because survivors lost hope when all team get demolished, so its easier for the entity to kill the last survivor, because he is hopeless

At low ranks as billy i would chainsaw from far and get a hook on the survivors at the gates

I'm curious what the ratio is between people rushing to help when it's obvious what your doing compared to abandoning the hooked survivor to focus on gens?

 I hate more haddonfield snd lerys

Good point

those graphics. thats lower than the normal low

Dying Light is bad because it doesn't activate fast enough unless you have a mori.

---
Tru3talent is an excellent killer player imo
---
Its more like a rant
---
That's the sort of combinations that make this game actually interesting for me, stuff that makes it like a _horror game_, not just a hide and seek game
---
&gt; Tunnel Vision. When the killer focuses on one person at a time the whole match.
---
Let's be honest here, that's not the current understanding. Truthfully, tunneling doesn't have a clearly defined meaning right now, and hasn't for some time. Current opinion from survivors states that any killer who goes after someone recently unhooked, regardless of circumstance, is tunneling them.
---
* If you just got rescued and downed again: tunneling
---
* If you got rescued and ran into the killer: tunneling
---
* If you got rescued and the killer found you and another person and went after you instead: tunneling
---
* If you get farmed in front of the killer and smacked again: tunneling
---
* If the killer sees someone running to save and goes to intercept, resulting in the rescued being downed again: tunneling
---
There are instances where someone does only focus one person, regardless of whether or not it's the most efficient tactic. Whatever the case, it's an issue that's been moralized that *shouldn't* be moralized. Killers aren't allowed to complain about survivors running an endless sequences of loops (jungle gyms, god pallets, miscellaneous strong tiles) because "what else do you expect me to do, die?", but when killers say "what else do you expect me to do, let you go?" the answer is almost always an emphatic "yes", otherwise you're a tunneling piece of shit baby killer who's "too shit at the game to do anything else so you gotta just tunnel me pussy reported."
---
These are awesome! Recentely picked her up and really enjoy it. Thanks!
---
But if he has the quiet bing bong add-on he shoots up to at least mid tier.
---
please no, i don’t want to be going against 4 man com groups every match
---
Where do you find how much bloodpoints you have earned?
---
Wait about 14 hours (from the time of me writing this) and you’ll find he’s a lot easier to keep track of so long as he’s close by

No life
---
Lol maybe zubat a year ago. He's washed now.
---
I think he'd be a cross between Hag and Freddy. He could teleport around the map through the walls/floors, with a cooldown ofcourse. But he could also pull survivors into his own dimension which could just be a smaller map of corridors with more mindgames.
---
Ya Unno why you would think that map would be hated so much lol it's fine
---
Point a flashlight at the tree. He’ll come out.
---
Lol, no. You’re not assholes. Point of the game is to escape &amp; use teamwork to do so. In my opinion anyway.
---
I was repeating what you said, I should've put a question mark at the end of the first sentence. And we aren't actually debating this. I was fun and Balanced offerings I'm DbD. I don't care if you think if fair, but your idea of fair is to keep garbage offerings.
---
"Verse"?
---
No, you’re not. It’s your objective to survive, rescuing someone off a hook, while the killer is facecamping is not toxic imo.
---
No that's not toxic he's just trash but just don't teabag or flashlight spam or whatever it's called that's just unsportsmanlike if you get what I'm saying. But just play the game and say gg, and have fun
---
he is just a baby
---
I'm too broke to even get all the characters lol.
---
This happens to me at least once a night. I thought it was a known glitch the survivors were purposely exploiting
---
More like truth.
---
Cheers I use bond over self care tho
---
Thanks Jasmine
---
Ok cheers bro
---
I’m a Nurse main myself! Thanks for the tip.
---
it is not impossible? ik many good huntresses just get better at it
---
This is a great suggestion for when the devs will want to kill their game once and for all.
---
Definitely will use until I get ds
---
Vault build.
---
Take Spine Chill and Resilience. Both of them make your vault speed faster and they stack with each other.
---
Other 2 perks can be anything, I like Dead hard and BT/DS/Iron will.
---
Who uses self care anyway
---
Yes
---
Crouch + shift + let go of shift = Don't use sprint burst when running
---
You can run normally without using it.
---
Jake in his lore he’s a loner
---
That’s some hella lag switching xD
---
So you're saying that **everyone** that wants to play with their friends is toxic? Are you insane?
---
Does a survivor get more points for fixing damaged generators? Sometimes I just want to chill out with 2 hooks and a survivor just keep pointing for me to kick it.
---
I mean the tags it says discussion but its more like a rant
---
Hell Yeah!
---
Wolfenstein.
---
Thats why he got Iron will
---
That really be a B R U H moment
---
One hundred percent
---
Ultimate Laurie vs Michael moment imo
---
I play like 4 regularly so that when I want to play a different build I can just switch characters, rather than mess with perks. Plus I like having someone different to look at, especially sexy brave Dave.
---
You will less often have good items and add-ons this way, in my experience, but it is more fun to mix things up.
---
Did they improve any of his add ons from the PTB?
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHA that's a good one
---
Object of obsession, teachable perk of Laurie. 
---
Lets you see the killer if you are out of their terror radius and you look in their direction. As a trade off you become the obsession and they can see your aura too if you are looking in their direction.
---
Really good vs stealthy killers (Myers, Ghostface, Wraith, Pig), Trapper since you can see his trap placement and Huntress, because you can always tell when she's trying to hit you with a long range hatchet + her terror radius is small so you can see her even if she gets pretty close.
---
I mean it’s pretty well-known that M&amp;K is better in many ways than a controller. 
---
As for huntress being impossible, git gud.
---
*Honk honk*
---
Not because they are difficult to play against, but because they make the match just suck. I would rather play against a good myers than any other killer.
---
Especially on corn maps. Blendettes just go invisible in a cornfield but the neon nea is easily trackable.
---
So 4 survivors run DS, 3 of them get no perk for the match? Seems pretty stupid.
---
Is there a set release date for dedicated servers (on console specifically, but I think PC will have the same release) I know we are expecting a late summer release, I was just wondering if there was an update on that
---
No, that killer was just toxic. Eventually he’ll learn to mind game palettes and get better at the game and stop being so angry.
---
How about the lady that TELLIPOT THROUGH FUCKEN WALLS
---
The difference is, old Ash is who they got the rights to, old Laurie is different licensing. Also, I liked H20 Laurie better. Although that Michael isn't great
---
Thanks
---
Yeah, there isn't that much to her. She's 99% muscle memory. Speaking from experience.
---
Once you know the range of your blinks and don't be greedy with them (close the distance with the first blink and then adjust with the 2nd one) you are good to go.
---
Easily offended decided that Pepe and clowns are now a Nazi thing since a few actually racist people decided to use them as a joke.
---
Such is the way with the world.
---
This is actually exactly what I did when I decided to play Pig after getting Myers to P3 Lv 50.
---
[Tomorrow indeed.](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1153409779341156353)
---
I don't. Others might though.
---
Sucks he had no morie
---
&gt;I don't care about fair, no one uses the offering because It's garbage.
---
How is this in any way a repetition of my message? What?
---
I don't see any reason for removing Cyprus mori from the game, it's a perfectly fine offering.
---
Uh...thats David....not Jeff....
---
I am Not sure how to answer
---
It is a garbage offering lol that's my reason.
---
Dude I look like Quentin man... if that's what I'm looking as an elderly man then shit.....
---
And now think about how many toxic people there are that don't mind lying to strangers...
---
I know killers who do tunnel for flashy costumes. Its always up to you.
---
Self promo is not liked here my guy.
---
He would just be a 110 speed M1 killer with the Nurse phasing property and a power similar to the pig’s reverse bear trap.
---
I can use more of a phone wallpaper. 🙃
---
Difference is Freddy himself isn't awful now, also, fake pallets are an add on, although his ultra rares and such are a bit weaker
---
Who's Ochido?
---
Dying light is a amazing game hype for the second one
---
never thought of it before! I think it would be awesome.
---
Thank you, I'm missing some of those, but I hope I can get them as soon as possible.
---
It's good for its purpose. It's a reward for killing everyone.
---
Thanks, I wish I could get BBQ and abuse sooner
---
And how does that give a advantage to the Killer?
---
Aaaaaaaand deserved.
---
Too be honest, I use to when they first released.  I felt like they were hot dogging it.  Now I feel like they're just having fun so I focus on the dark clothed Claudette or anyone with a toolbox.
---
Wait! This is coming?!
---
You know I once got killed by an Insidious Bubba due to my greed wanting to open the other Exit Gate. Of course I was totally at fault but it was pretty funny.
---
Idk why people still give Legion crap
---
Looks the the Deathgarden pre order Trapper mask exclusive
---
No extra points. They're probably trying to get you away from them or farming.
---
Thanks! Whose Pop Goes the weasel by the way?
---
How many hours?
---
RN I'm leveling the hag to get the ruin hex. Thanks!!
---
You have to get good with blinking andtimeing hits after in the window you have before the fitage time happens
---
Just thinking about Haddonfield gives me PTSD
---
I personally watch Noob3 for survivors and true3alent for killer play
---
Fingerguns
---
If you know your steamid, you can jump to it ie:  [https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard.php?jumpto=76561197991588669](https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard.php?jumpto=76561197991588669).
---
Did this with Freddy over the weekend lmao
---
So “camping” is good if there is 2 guys near the hook (lmao stop crying about how “camping is unfair, do the gens)
---
I like to do this, but only after i knock you down, let you go, repeat, probably have you pallet stun me, and break pallets to make up for the bp i would lose
---
That’s understandable since people wouldn’t understand what killers do early on
---
It sounds like a lower rank match so I wouldn't worry about it.  
---
If this was a SWF using multiple crutch perks you might be the baddies...but simply outplaying a face camping killer doesn't qualify.
---
If you've played other games with open communication you should know this won't be the case majority of the time.
---
Although I do hope its proximity
---
When people refer to leveling a character without playing them, they typically refer to playing as another character and then dumping the bloodpoints they earn into the character they are trying to level. However this only works if you have the character unlocked. The only other way to get teachables from a character you do not own is by purchasing them from the shrine, which goes back to my previous comment. Sorry mate, I bit the bullet during the sale and bought her, I understand the feeling.
---
Imagine thinking playing one of the worst killers is toxic
---
Is he still coming tomorrow on xbox?
---
You can see the photoshop between the kate and ghostface
---
You deserved not getting that win... don’t teabag man
---
You’re welcome and Pop Goes The Weasel comes from the Clown. I think the teachable unlocks when you get him to level 40.
---
That's great 🤣
---
Didn't knew that those were bad perks. Thanks!!
---
As survivor, same. But as killer I love interrupting actions🤣😈
---
I just heard it was possible via word-of-mouth and tried it out.
---
BHVR didn't make a newspost in the client confirming it was an exploit/punishable like they did for some other content (Legion blades/mending, Wake Up, two-killers-in-match).
---
They don't ban for what seemed a gimmick at best.
---
Y does he look like a half naked trapper
---
Forgive me for using iri heads
---
Well we need his powers... and perks... figure those out and it’s a good idea you don’t your kinda throwing ideas in a game that needs better
---
While we are at it, please for god's sake turn off the chainsaw noise while waiting in a lobby.
---
The sound makes my ears hurt.
---
Aww shucks, I don't have him... Guess I'll have to wait til the shrine of secrets puts it on sale or another Steam sale. Thanks!!
---
Yeah, he had to go out of his way to insult me, too. Im on console, so he had to directly send me a message.
---
Oink
---
Soon it will be a shining sliver mask
---
I will try and let someone escape by bringing them to the exit gates and they run from said exit
---
Bruh! SO TRUE
---
Sorry, I meant Learn then. Forget "Master" my bad.
---
Thanks for your argument.
---
Have fun out there!
---
K. No one gives a fuck
---
Judging from these comments, people can be really stupid. You did the right thing IMO.
---
 
---
"lul why would you punish the survivors who are obviously going to divebomb the hook at any chance they get lul, just let them win you camper!"
---
“Since when does visibility matter with huntress” ... her whole play style is based off line of sight... 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I have always wanted this, but I can’t think of a good power.
---
Binged all three seasons in 2 weeks, amazing show!
---
Side note: Kelly would've made an awesome survivor!
---
I was just watched this movie yesterday  for the hell of it. His powers would have to be something psychic related. The Overlook Hotel as a map would be fucking great.
---
The camping is bad, but I honestly can see why all I run into as killer is SWF. It's toxic for both sides of the game.
---
get off my post you low ranking pleeb
---
Which makes the devs rush to fix it? You can find out how to do it everywhere on this subreddit and on YouTube. Being secretive about glitches will never work, especially with a game with as many glitches as Dead By Daylight. It's going to be fixed tomorrow anyways.
---
But I fell like if they were to guve something like this a shot they could counter some toxic behaviors like this and add more then 2 doors and bigger maps
---
It's been bugged for the past few patches. I just checked my comment history and I made a comment about the bugged sprint burst 26 days ago. It's gone unfixed for a while.
---
I’d recommend leatherface for the perks. And for gameplay I’d probably say Freddy. That’s just my opinion though.
---
Sorry about my spelling too btw
---
It's not QoL but a needed chaneg nonetheless. Revert the recent changes to macmillian maps that added a ton of trees to macmillian estate. That realm used to be one of 2 realms that were good for Huntress, the extra trees give a ton of cover to survivors. Huntress is already pretty bad on most maps, please just throw her a bone.
---
Fix false chainsaws for Billy. Sometimes the chainsaw will just not registed and you will "whiff" a hit directly in the survivor.
---
Make leatherface not walk slower than survivors when starting and holding his chainsaw so that he doesn't have to sit at the survivor's ass from the start to get a hit.
---
Make base movement speed of Wraith while cloaked higher, nerf windstorm add ons accordingly. Wraith shouldn't have to be running a windstorm add on every game to be decent.
---
Make trapper start with more traps so that he doesn't surrender the early game (2 sometimes 3 gens) to walk around the map picking up his power.
---
Adjust Trapper's trap hitboxes. Sometimes you can vault a window that has a trap on the other side and land safely outside of the trap's hitbox.
---
I gave up when I reached the purple ranks tbh, I simply couldn't get any further. Good luck to you though!
---
&gt; **What is considered toxic?** 
---
Anyone playing dbd how they want to play instead of following everyone's made up rules. According to this sub anyways.
---
If they ever add Ruvik from the Evil Within as a killer that's how he will move around, just like in the game.
---
Did someone get banned from this subreddit
---
You are the most toxic person I have ever seen on reddit
---
I think the majority of them died with Mettle of Man
---
0:23 MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA WRYYYYYYYYYYYY!
---
Him turning around was hilarious. I wish he just straight up moonwalked across.
---
Tbh I hate the design of that add on.
---
The counterplay to Trapper is finding where his traps are and disarming them when you aren't being chased so that he has to re-arm them. The add ons makes it so the trapped spot is never safe.
---
There is no indicator for it either, so sometimes the trap can just open under your feet.
---
Thank you so much for the advice I will give a good look at all and thank you telling about the maps hope to see you in the fog!
---
No
---
And the only way you lose that is with buildings and shit that clearly has nothing to do with what OP suggested
---
This is my type of post
---
Same happened to me yesterday against Ghostface. Blink ability confirmed.
---
Tapp, Jeff, Quentin, and now that they've made Mettle of Man garbage I haven't seen very many people playing Ash. 
---
General trend I've noticed is that if they dont have at least one high tier perk and/or decent cosmetics, probably not a lot of mains.
---
This man has achieved a wisdom that no man has ever achieved before.
---
Thanks! I hope you have the will to improve yourself and really master the Nurse. Good luck to you!
---
No problem! I hope you enjoy! Do you play on PS4?
---
Most importantly, don't take the game to seriously.
---
I've been seeing a lot of Pigs, and when GF came out nearly every match was GF.
---
Read the title and description again, carefully.
---
or No Mither
---
Wow. Shaming CVS sufferers. You've got issues dude.
---
What does it mean by killers belongings
---
Something Psychic related, because in the movie, there's an entity in the hotel of vengeful spirits, and demonic entities. Maybe his power could be that he can somehow make himself go more and more mad as the game goes on, the player playing as the killer waves out tons of demonic, evil, and terrifying energy onto the survivors, the more the madness-meter rises, he becomes faster, more aggressive, able to perform actions quicker, unrelenting, so to say, and not only that, the survivors have a chance of having their pathway blocked by demonic entities, it's a stretch, but in the movies certain characters are blocked off from getting to certain locations through fear by the ghosts in the hotel right? Maybe the more mad Jack becomes, random ghosts from the movie, (The Twins, the Dogface, the Old Bath Lady) they can appear in between certain routes at a chance, say RNG device, and that CHANCE gets raised higher the more Jack's mad meter goes up, so say his mad meter is up all the way, you have say 40% or maybe 50% chance of having a small gap blocked.
---
So to sum it up, Jack uses the power of the demonic spirits and his madness to block off tight entrances, like gaps, forcing his survivors to have to run out in the open, it's kind of an anti-looping, "get the survivors out in the open" type of killer.
---
So those little gaps in between rocks and whatnot that survivors use to loop and hide while running from the killer? they have a chance of being blocked when you get near them.
---
I think this would be a unique gameplay element and it makes sense to the movie too, as Jack dies in a maze, a very right corner area, and when we see him in action in the movie, he's a lot more effective in wide-open, no where to hide type areas, he's basically a "just run survivors, cos you have no where to hide" he's a fear-enducing killer
---
Please I don’t want to loose subscriber
---
Bruh tis was hilarious xD
---
No but that's not aura revealing
---
I just came up with a little concept below, let me know what you think
---
Do we know when the next double blood point event starts?
---
The most satisfying thing in the world: facecamping a monkey who tbags and flashlight spams after throwing a pallet down. If any survivor does that shit they will see me staring at them and nodding for the whole time they’re on the hook.
---
So no why of me getting it correct
---
If you carry and drop him near the exit, he will be able to escape without triggering the trap. Otherwise the hatch is the only way
---
“Hurt the real player” holy shit if you take someone pressing a button on their keyboard/controller to heart you’re a little bitch, ngl
---
Its cause it takes 0 skill to do that, that's why you get hate mail. Also like has been stated no one cares how you play lol.
---
I never really notice cosmetics, personally. I mean, if I see a fly Ace or Jake or something I'll say, "damn he fly" as I hook him but I don't go out of my way to get them. I base my playstyle on their playstyle, not their outfit.
---
Haha! true!
---
Nones complaining on the chest perk? I really think this perk is a total waste of a slot.
---
Haven't done them yet. Planning to, though
---
Me.
---
Well yes and no. According to the wiki, the hatch spawns at the very start of the trial, but is invisible and can not be interacted with until certain requirements for it to become visible. 
---
So if we are being technical, there is never a moment of "before it spawns" as it spawns at the same time as everything else (unless you consider before the match even loads). But if we arent being needlessly pedantic then yes, you can track black locks before they spawn. You will get map scout points for discovering it, but you will not see its aura until it becomes visible.
---
It’s great for new freddy
---
They all have a lot of horizontal space so they'd probably crop well
---
Used to be. He's super burnt out now and all he does is make bad choices and complain. He was my go to when I first started this game but now I cant even watch a video in full without having to stop.
---
Billie Eilish's music is just awful. Nothing against Ghost Face though :D
---
Just killers, I have all the ones I've done on my deviantart
---
I dunno about the rest of killer mains, but I ALWAYS use bamboozle, it blocks off walls and you vault faster. Only time I don’t is when I use nurse. This perk is essential for all mid and low tier killers
---
Times up seems to be a nice perk of use, however I think it should require the obsession being alive as that reduces the obligation to tunnel them
---
You just crouch before you start running and the just stop sprinting for a split second and start splinting again and it will activate the sprint burst.
---
chill lmao. ps4 is still gonna get bill, theyre just havin some problems rn
---
bruh
---
Yes.  I also see a bear by Nea’s left hand.  Why are there faces in the shrubbery!
---
I'm concerned...
---
What a sad little man you must be.
---
"remember me?" I see what ya did there
---
[deleted]
---
"Just so you know" I hooked her and a meg back and forth because they were easy targets and I saw both of them with bbq everytime.
---
LOL same thing happened to me earlier. the player was AFK and I hooked them but no complaining. I mean it's 10 minutes into the game wtf people?
---
Know your place trash
---
God damn though, I'm so sad. I was worked up for two weeks and suddenly my hope is shattered. I hope he's here soon because I'm really bummed now.
---
Seems every time a new killer appears  I always go up against them
---
Interestingly Ghostface is still the most common killer encounter
---
Thompson’s house and Bloodlodge are the most broken in my opinion. Lots of unmindgameable pallets. Also the temple maps because they’re just MASSIVE it’s very difficult to apply gen pressure.
---
I luckily got BBQ on the Shrine I believe, same for Monitor!
---
Exactly, this wasn't like an early game thing, she just stopped moving after she unhooked someone. Maybe her controller died or something, but like, that's not my fault and I'm not gonna let you just get away with it.
---
I played Freddy all-day today. 4k every match but God damn those survivors didn't make it easy.
---
The game is worse
---
Perfectly Balanced as all things should be.
---
He has 0 pipes
---
I was maining a P3 Claudette and P2 Meg Year 1.
---
Once shirtless David released he took over.
---
Now I play Ash and shirtless David.  I have a million BP and shards saved up for Bill when he releases tomorrow.
---
I'll probably main P2 Ash, P3 David and Bill (in that order).  Bill will take priority for the next few weeks.  Depending on my mood I throw in some wacky Ace cosmetics, USA Kate and a few others.  I actually see my P3 Claude (with most of the perks) gathering dust for a while.
---
Not a single pipe. What a tragedy.
---
Has to be someone's fetish.
---
Hold up, that legit?
---
You will get there! I believe in you &lt;3
---
He's probably going to come soon they most likely just had a issue porting him over maybe with the perk icons or perks working if you already have them. Chill my guy he isn't ripped away from PS4 players and never coming out.
---
Why is it "wasting time on a video game" but as soon as it's a hobby you deem worthy like volunteering, it's not wasting time?
---
That's condescending.
---
Sadly there is no achievement for maxing out everyone.
---
If you are asking what I am going to do next I am probably just going to get all the shard cosmetics now.
---
I don't watch many DbD people, but I really like Monto's stuff. He mostly plays killer gimmick builds that are more entertaining to me than **super meta best killer ever** builds. He also breaks down each perk and add on before the gameplay, explaining what it does and why he's using it, which was super helpful for me when I was first learning how to play killer.
---
On top of that, he's pretty solid at the game. In purple/red ranks, he gets 4ks a majority of the time. Probably not **the best**, but very good and entertaining to watch. :)
---
I saved to 1 mil n when i found out i dumped it all into freddy
---
I play really every killer. Just a general rotation of just playing killer with BBQ.
---
You’re not a douche for using perks, that the other side dislikes. You’re also not a douche for wanting to play with friends. 
---
I do agree that if you play toxic, then yes you’re a douche. No matter what side you play on. Yet again people can play however they want so.
---
Doctor and Hag are at full power there and Wraith is as well if he has the right add on
---
Maybe they shouldn't queue up for a game if they're going to go afk idk just thought but I get if it's like you got to go to the bathroom or something along those lines.
---
Devotion 11!
---
Nice
---
3400 hours!
---
When does the rework hit live servers?
---
Yikes, somones a killer main. Im a survivor main a think that the game is as balanced as it has ever been.

---
I'm probably one of select few that like Legion and I'm in the process of leveling other killers to get the teachables for Legion. I'm working on Doctor now for Monitor and Abuse. 
---
So, you're not alone in not minding not being the best killer. Even if I don't get any kills as long as I get a good amount of bloodpoints I'm happy with it.
---
I agree but only if we get clown in a bikini first
---
What? You can come on my stream and I can show you all the prestiges if you want :p
---
Dk if you know but Freddy has been re worked, unless you mean that version?
---
Lol yeah, you're the only one who got it shhhh don't tell the other commenters
---
Times up would be awesome to pair with blood warden, I feel like missing pages isn't good enough to be a hex, and I feel like camoflage should be baseline. Great ideas man.
---
Hillbilly doesn't require too much skill to main. The right add-ons and the sensitivity helps.
---
Yea my life sucks so that’s probably why
---
Whats wrong with that guy?
---
Dude it's in the rulebook, chapter 127.
---
Or a slugging Nurse with NC to completely prevent survs from doing anything, forcing them to take the bait otherwise you’re doing 4 gens by yourself super immersed until your teammates bled out.
---
But devoir hope is active from the start of the match. It just doesn't do anything yet.
---
Jeez, you’re just proving why /s needs to be added to comments. Even if it’s obvious
---
Yeah. The rework makes him really good.
---
Used Bloody Party Streamers, I am not losing that BP
---
Agreed
---
I was pointing out a fact and not a reflection on your comment, numb nuts
---
It sure is when you’re a survivor trying to not die.
---
Even then it isn't.
---
Nah dude, you're right. It really doesn't matter if you use it or not. Not every Mori or even offerings for that matter need to give some huge advantage.
---
Yeah I figured lmao
---
Wat how could i be banned you’re talking to me
---
I like how everyone here is complaining about noed when the last three survivors literally ran straight at the killer and the hook, basically killing themselves.
---
Player awareness will lead to developer awareness...
---
Oooh. Okay. That makes sense.
---
Oh sweetheart. 
---
The devs knew about this bug day 1. They didn’t fix it.
---
I’d love to see the results of that one. But yeah. I knew he had to bullshit.
---
So... do you need a therapist? Just saying like all the toxic stuff and people there is alot to talk about xD
---
Hahahaha..youre joking?
---
fun game. initiate and lose chase over and over, it fucks their chase emblem and pretty much gurantees you get iri evader if you didnt already
---
The mobile version of DBD is looking cool
---
Ohh 100% He attempted to threaten with legal action if this was posted. Knew at that point he was 100% BS and was scared on being called out on it.
---
happened to me *literally* 8 times it sucks
---
Yeah, I get what you mean, they really should make some perks unavalible to certain killers or make them rare mories you can have
---
People would refuse to just smack them because it gave the survivors exactly what they wanted, the win they didn't deserve.
---
I've outright just walked away from my computer for over an hour to come back and see the stand off still going on despite me the killer being AFK for an hour.
---
I have the third seal but none of the other DLC's for these perks. Which one should I get? Im thinking Surveillance but I haven't played in a very long time so im not sure whats worth. I play both killer and survivor.
---
I don't understand why people say ED2 is a reboot when it really isn't. Aside from the opening, the movie is a direct continuation of ED1. Raimi wanted to use clips from ED1 for the opening, but couldn't due to some other company owning the rights to the first movie at the time.
---
Which is why I said push
---
I believe you can dead hard past the invisible barrier that sets off the traps into the exit gate and leave, I did it once.
---
If you play killer and have 5€ (or the equivelant of your country's currency) you can buy leatherface and level him to 35 for the bbq&amp;chili teachable.
---
If you play survivor you can level David King to level 35 to get the We're Gonna Live Forever teachable.
---
Both give 50%/75%/100% more bloodpoints for hooking/safe hook rescues.
---
do you usually have lots of trouble with window loops?
---
Thats not how those work.
---
Ahh the stream title makes more sense now! Congrats!
---
I'm not. I actually really enjoyed playing as Freddy. I feel like people just didn't understand how to play him to his fullest potential.
---
Ash has no recollection of the Necronomicon tho? And the cabin?
---
Hooks, totems, traps &amp; chests
---
Facts
---
Oof
---
Hex totems, trappers traps, piggys jigsaw boxes, etc.
---
Ooh what about kate?? Shes getting a biker outfit
---
Okay. I have many reactions to this, chief among them incredulity. Like, what harm is he thinking he’s getting by being called out as a bullshitter when you have his name blacked out. 
---
Sorry you had to deal with it. But you handled it well from what I’ve seen. 
---
My god. Imagine getting sued over a conversation over a video game. What a world! LOL
---
Sometimes, not often, usually it's the fucking pallets that keep me behind.
---
As a freelddy main i get what youre saying but freddy was a super weak killer. A strong SWF could stomp the guy. The issues of being unable to stop gate escapes or quick rescues was painful.
---
Bamboozle is pretty much good for almost all of the characters including ghost face. Other perks I would use on him are: BBQ &amp; Chilli, surveillance, Hex: ruin and the last one could be bamboozle, Haunted grounds, monitor and abuse or whispers.
---
The Necronomicon not being burnt was a retcon by Raimi. Raimi also had to retcon previous characters to save time. If you get rid of the recap in the beginning of ED2 it starts exactly where ED1 ends. That was Raimi's original intention but, as stated before, he was blocked by copyright.
---
Apart from what the other guy said, he also sometimes exploited the game and had his cronies harass killers. He got banned from pc so he moved to console, only to get up banned there as well. He's kinda forgotten now but he used to be public enemy #1.
---
How is the current system any better?
---
Hmm interesting request, I'll consider it. I did do a Michael one though: https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Shape-Wallpaper-761027229
---
For the memes: No rework for Cannibal
---
Jeez. Sounds extremely toxic.
---
Believe it or not yes, they do. It goes both ways.
---
No need to pay, I already did one, I like wraith a lot too: https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Wraith-Wallpaper-761379236
---
I don't know if that's true cause the devour hope doesn't light up until it does something.
---
Thanks for the tips :)
---
I feel like its good with legion

I already picked up some wallpapers.
---
It’s fantastic work, my only complaint is to have the red glow be a full circle. I got an XS Max and with the OLED Display these look fucking fantastic. Let me know if you can make full circles of the red backlight on the wallpapers at least. Thanks:)
---
Not yet but I'm planning to do one
---
Plague main checking in!
---
There are plenty of threads already explaining why he is / was weak, we are beyond that already. The rework has been made, time to move on.
---
Yes, he needed a rework and the majority wanted that.
---
Full circles?
---
When you blink with nurse all survivors instantly escape and you get a 1 hour fatigue,you must wait until the fatigue to end to leave the match as punishment for using such a OP killer. When NOED activate the totem lights up emitting a beam in the sky for all survivors to see and you become 10% slower.
---
Np
---
No. This is for when it does.
---
No this is for when it does.
---
Devoir hope is lit from the very start of the match. I know this to be true. I've cleansed it within 20 seconds of the start as survivor, and I've had mine cleansed at the very start as killer.
---
This might make me happy with the current garbage progression system.
---
Burning your freddy offerings to P3 him once teh rework is out too?
---
Reeepooooost
---
To where as, it doesn’t cut off with a flat line at the top of the screen. Bottom is fine, but top would look great if it was rounded.
---
It's not that I haven't moved on, it's just that I'm expressing my distaste with how the rework was handled. If they swapped the traps with dream pallets as his main ability, I think I would enjoy the rework a lot more.
---
I tried Billy earlier; I don't play Billy. I ran his 3 perks cuz they're honestly really good. Had a toxic Ash t-bag me each time he pallet slammed me. It makes me not wanna play him.
---
They're just less crucial to the character now
---
This is so relatable, most of the SWF I encounter are like " Yeah bro, lets super tryhard these" + the general toxic behavior + the end game chat.
---
How old are you?
---
Oh ok, yeah I could try changing it
---
like you eat them or you respect them(stop at/dont attempt to swing through)?
---
No, haddonfield is. I literally want to quit when I get that map as killer, but push through it and just have a shitty time.
---
Perfection
---
report him with video so he will be banned
---
That is super bannable my dude. Report him.
---
\*squeeeeks happily\*
---
Finding Survivors is only half of your job. You still have to overcome the safe pallets that the map has. 
---
The silent bell doesn’t really work when you’re near an open door because you can still see the Wraith glowing and the you will hear terror radius immediately after he uncloaks. You’ll only be able to get the full benefits of the add-on if you’re hiding behind something and there isn’t a pallet or window nearby.
---
*And strangely, Kobe's/Struggle Suicides increase x500.*
---
Can you out the pink bulb on with a HESL to good effect?
---
wow the toxic people came out tonight, good clip man. they ran right at you and you did your job as the killer. didn’t face camp either. good game
---
We all have opinions.  We'll likely agree on a lot and disagree on some.
---
I don't have an issue with a person using what ever perks they want.  I generally play a very friendly killer even if they are using perks or a play style that I consider annoying.  
---
I do have an issue with multiple people running multiple get out of jail free perks, but it really isn't that common in my experience...and it's just my opinion.
---
I probably wouldn't have replied to the OP but I was inclined after watching some twitch tonight.  I had just watched one of the top streamers loop a rank 13 killer.  Seeing him dead hard repeatedly to make pallets/windows and eventually D-Strike to get hatch felt lame.  
---
I don't want to get caught up on lingo.  Whether it's toxic, douchey, baddie or whatever...people can do whatever they want, but that doesn't mean it isn't lame/annoying to play against.  
---
It isn't anyone's responsibility to makes sure the other players had a good time.  There is no rule book.  
---
I don't know if it's just because I'm getting a bit older but I find myself being mindful of other people.  The internet dehumanizes people.  I try to remember that there is another person on the other end of the ethernet cord.  It's completely optional but I recommend having some etiquette.  Other people really do appreciate it.
---
If the Wraith player does a good job at hiding themselves, then it can work really well. It’s easier to see the shimmer on Lery’s because of the amount of windows it has.
---
Perks Names: 
---
Heeere's Johnny: Everytime you hook a survivor you gain a token, tokens can be used to destroy unused pallets with one single swing of axe. Destroying an unused pallet consumes 2 tokens.
---
All Work and No Play: Chasing a single survivor for 100 seconds in total in game enables rage mode, damaging a gen reduces that generator and 2 more nearby generators' progress by 50%. Single use.
---
Redrum! : Your blood thirst pushes survivors to the edge, every generator completed in your terror radius grants you a token. 3 tokens enable you to kill a survivor with your hands.
---
Oh look a community almost a 1/3 as toxic as ours
---
wait whats the difference for quentin?
---
This so accurate and cute at the same time
---
?????? you're delusional lmao
---
Me and the boys looking for keys
---
When the killer downs the survivor camping the hatch.
---
That’s where you are wrong. There is a limit on how many hook spawns are on the map, but the offering however can decrease/increase them. They discussed it on a stream.
---
"As soon as her dumb teammates die"
---
The immersed claudettes ;-;
---
People are conflating two separate ideas.
---
1. Killers have to follow an imaginary set of rules to make things way easier for survivors (obvious bullcrap).
---
2. Survivors can and will complain when killers do things they don't like (obviously true).
---
They're not the same thing.
---
I feel very  conflicted about my internet and this sentiment. I sometimes go weeks to months with out a single problem, other times I'll fully drop for ~5-30 seconds (long enough for most games to kick you) every 10 minutes or so. 
---
But I dont know when those days are....
---
I'll get on for the first game of the day only to DC and have my teammates flame me and tell me "if you're going to lag dont play"  so I just sit there and be like how am I supposed to know that my ISP hates me today if o dont play? The brief cuts dont affect streaming services that won't help me know.  Speed tests won't help either because it happens so intermittently, I'll check it and it's like **96-100mbs w/10ms ping** So I think, "awesome let's game", only for the internet to go to shit just long enough to cause problems. 
---
But like I said, its usually months with out issue, and I get p good mbs and steady low ping. 
---
So what do I do? Just *never* play multiplayer? Or is it cool to risk finding it out? (I never continue playing if its bad) 
---
For reference I mainly play Rocket League, somewhat decently and I'll do a test game of casuals before I hop into ranked, but sometimes it's not until later in the gaming session that the internet starts acting up.
---
The devs fucked up the way the range add-on bonuses are calculated so that they actually give a shitload of charge speed as well, significantly more than the charge speed addons. On top of that the accuracy debuff is bugged and doesn't work, so the add-ons have no drawback. It makes chases a joke. It's the equivalent to giving another killer add-ons that increase their movement speed by 35%. Imagine if trapper moved like he had bloodlust tier 3, max play with your food stacks, and NOED speed boost all together, all the time. That's basically Nurse with range addons. It's impossible to win against if the Nurse knows how to use the addons properly.
---
you.... Make a good point lol.
---
They are not exclusive scenarios either.
---
I've lost 2 pips in one day because the killer dced. And it wasnt just a visual bug.
---
If only we could play other killers and not just be useless...  
---
The devs' :"Not all killers are meant to be viable." Is stupid.
---
ask for water, fill it with soda! I call this one “Sneaky Salamander”
---
They used to be against voice chat. Now they have twitch challenges, and now this...
---
just get rid of terror radius and show where the killer is 24/7 honestly at this point
---
Trickstershadow is a good killer main
---
you gave him an even bigger- yep you did.
---
You need to level them again but you dont need to unlock them again and thats all the shrine does (or did I miss a change in the last few weeks?)
---
Holy shit, really? Never heard this before, but that would make sense.

Nah I love that salt mine at the end of the game

---
i played with this meme build a couple of weeks i know how it works.
---
And every time he activates his power he says “here’s Johnny!”
---
Honestly I feel like it fuels bad behavior tho
---
Why get rid of end game chat? If salt bothers you then you can hide the chat panel while you look at scores and info, and iirc there is an tweak you can do to automatically hide it.
---
And if you're on PC and a survivor then you can see recent players in Steam's "players" tab, it doesn't work for killers though.
---
Oh, it's feasible for sure, and if it does get added, it'll be a blast!

---
Did you grind as many hours simply to get P3 on everyone ? Was it the objective that drove you or did you simply play 3000+ hours for fun ?
---
If your objective was the P3s, how do you feel about the fact that most people in your situation (all maxed) got there because their profile was lost at some point by Behavior and they got hundreds of millions bloodpoints for free. (afaik if you had more than a hundred hours playtime at the time they gave you at least 100M bloodpoints) Did you know about this ? If not does this make you feel any different about the grind you did ?
---
Looping most of the time is literally just run in circles until he gets close then throw down the pallet and run to the next loop. And if their teammates aren’t doing gens then they’re just stupid as there’s not much else they should be doing.
---
I used Sprint Burst for a while back in the day. I would hair trigger the exhaustion by letting it reach 99% cooldown so I could use it on demand. It would be impossible for another player to determine whether someone was using this technique or the exploit, since it looks exactly the same during a chase. Considering Sprint Burst is a very common perk, there is literally no way to determine who is abusing the exploit. The only thing they can do is fix it.
---
Is this a KYF? Because if not those guys suck lmao
---
I think he’s a cool killer but definitely needs some rework.
---
Yeah, every second that ticks is taken from the killer, not survivors.
---
Removed - Common media reposts

Doctor has got to be the funnest Killer in the game. I love shocking people and revealing their locations in an instant.
---
I’m saying that no matter what you do you’re in a poor position. If you somehow manage to eventually hook a guy their team has done 2-3 gens even with ruin. Then they can just go get the unhook with little to no punishment. It’s too easy and braindead.
---
maybe that’s a bit too memey, but cool idea!
---
The only thing I won’t face camp...
---
so camouflague woule activate if thril of the hunt is around the moment they touch a totem? or even Hex Lullaby since it notifies you upon skill check?
---
Nah, downvoting works better to convince you

If the timeout prevents you from playing isn’t it the same as a ban? It just won’t ever be permanent ?

Leaving a lobby is not against the rules. It’s not like it will kick you out of the lobby anyway anymore I would think

Rank 15 killer against rank 20 survs
---
The Red Cross is a medical organisation that takes no sides. So in times of war, the medics are there only to take care of the wounded, no matter the side the person they're treating is on. They are completely neutral and are never to be harmed.
---
So by allowing others to use the sign without their permisson it could be seen as the Red Cross taking a stance on something.
---
They also argue that the more it's used the less seriously one would take it in times of war and brush off seeing that specific symbol.
---
turn flashlight into lasers. Blinding the killer from across the map by default, and burn them to death by using the 'death ray' addon.
---
I’ve been anticipating his arrival today but looks like not... The most important is that he’ll come in the end.
---
This, but the literal exact opposite.
---
Because mates are dumb and run away the moment they are unhooked and shit
---
Cool, now that I know that you have spine chill I will phase and not move but look at opposite direction and wait for you to vault.
---
Are you forgetting when the perk tinkier was bugged? No killer got banned for that
---
Tomorrow. All platforms
---
You have what TF2 players like to call the Delfy mentality. Let me try and break this down for you:  
---
Having more and more players using a glitch or exploit doesn't make the devs fix the game faster, it only ruins the game during the time the devs haven't yet fixed it and leaves the developers in a spot where they have to choose between a stable fix that is unlikely to break other shit, or rush the patch with spaghetti code and potentially destroy another mechanic completely.  
---
Letting players know about a glitch or exploit never actually helps. If you want the developers to be aware, go tell them directly via email. Do NOT spread that shit among a playerbase that has showed time and time again that they are more than willing to abuse that shit.
---
Yes need ghostface have you thought of doing survivors by any chance?
---
How can i look up the amount of bloodpoints ive earned? (Playing on computer)
---
“Helps bad killers”
---
&gt;playback of when the survivors all ran at Billy with the knowledge of him having NoED
---
🤔
---
Lmao I do that 1 minute tops then hitting the survivor because it’s funny for both sides but 20 minutes is just mean
---
Can you be an ass somewhere else and let people enjoy the game they want to?
---
*cough* runescape
---
Not that it’s against any rules, I’m just love playing with friends not because it’s “easier with SWF” but because my friends and I genuinely love the game and like to play with stupid perks etc. and usually we will find a lobby and the killer instantly leaves. It gets old having to go through ten lobbies before someone will play with us.. hoping that the servers fix this issue and won’t give away the fact that some people are teamed up
---
In my opinion it's how it should work, it's kinda dumb that it doesnt have a hotkey to activate it
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Now do one for health kits! Or toolboxes!
---
Lulwut
---
F13 flashbacks... errrghghhh..
---
Yeah it just becomes the strongest perk in the game if you can activate it lmao.
---
Shoot through walls, turning them to dust. Killer can deflect it back at you with mirrored sunglasses addon.
---
Whenever I played vanilla it was strong then only because when you're being chased it can reactivate, and killers have plenty of strong perks, whole survivors have meh kinda good perks
---
Yeah, OP did photoshop it. OP photoshopped the character icons together so they all fit in the same picture lol
---
I don’t understand what youre talking about, did i make a typo?
---
It used to energize with IAE before it's rework, but since IAE got reworked and so has Freddy I cannot think of much of a use for it.
---
What I want to see is a change to no mither 😂
---
Oh I see, well one more useless perk in the long list :D
---
I mean are they gonna do something for the survivors team when someone disconnects? Killers already get bonus bp. Do they really need a ghost character to down and get hook points for when the survivors are pretty much guaranteed a loss and pretty much no points?
---
Base Freddy is better now, but his add-on game is weaker. IMO, considering previous Freddy with his best add-ons, he was as good as current Freddy with his best add-ons.
---
My biggest gripe is his entire play-style is different now. He is more viable, sure. But Freddy was one of my 3 favorite killers to play, and now I find him very unfun to play, just because of his new playstyle. So unfortunately, I won't be playing him anymore.
---
I get that is was a good move to change him for the overall playerbase... but I am not a fan of the change.
---
If it's screams you hear the traps are near,
---
but silence when the sun goes down means you are in Pallet Town!
---
That's simple - Ace gives +Luck, and this outfit has a set bonus.
---
I'll keep an eye out. Vould always use more guides on optimal addon combinations.
---
thanks! But yeah I’ll sacrifice myself for the team if I need to
---
I'm really curious if the survivors will be able to unhook and heal this idle character.
---
Ikr ash is so juicy
---
How does endgame chat benefit you seemingly so profoundly? Is it the sweaty neckbeards who say ez and leave?
---
I'll miss old Freddy but the one seems fun so no real major loss to me.
---
When will the rework be released?
---
$1.02
---
It's called an "exclusivity deal". Basically, Valve owns L4D, but MS paid them a lot of money to make sure the only console it ever releases on is Xbox.
---
Probably transferring the perk icons maybe or the most likely is they couldn't get the perk teachables to work if you already had them on a survivor before he came on console
---
Since when are the killers gods now? Like, tf?
---
..... seriously....
---
Not a god, but maybe something like a mad enginner, soldier with experimental weapon....
---
I called it
---
Shhh. Consoles stick together or the master race ...

Feng rallies the folks outside to cause a disturbance. Meanwhile we have Quentin acting as our man on the inside, he disables security and secures us a way out. I'm the distraction. I start a rumble with security, while Ashe infiltrates the building and takes out the guards one by one. Once him and Quentin make it out with the goods, I dead hard out the exit gate just as Feng pulls up with the getaway car. Stick to the plan, and we should out in 30 minutes.  
---
This iridescent shit doesn't grow on trees ya know.
---
This looks like a ps2 graphics mod!! XD omg
---
But it's coming to Xbox just not PS4 yet.
---
They’re a change that is completely in the favour of the killer. Ebonies are not fun to go against as a survivor, they encourage bad behaviour because survivor are trying to not get caught, so they avoid chases, unhooks that could have been safe but didn’t want to risk it.
---
Ebony are like if the survivors only had to do 3 gens to open the gates. That would be grossly overpowered, and unfun for the killer.
---
The councill will decide your fate (nerf/buff)

* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam. 
---
But if someone disconnects it makes nearly impossible for a killer to pip, while as survivor its only a little harder.
---
For scrubs maybe
---
The more players the better. Maybe after Switch they can focus attention on this and servers in more countries
---
I mainly Kate, since she is my most favorite survivor, and I usually play Dwight or Nea from time to times.
---
But... The traps won't activate at the exit gates anymore...
---
Here come the ps4 users
---
Pretty sure they wont be teachables. If they were free once theyll always be free
---
Yes, but let’s keep in mind it’s only one game, much more difficult, yes, but not impossible. But there’s one big downside, tunneling. Mories reward going after the same survivor wich is unfair.
---
though those do sound like cool ideas that can make SOME sort of sense… I think they’re better off being Trapper cosmetics, or something.
---
It is.
---
YOU CAN STILL HAVE WIN EVEN IF IT'S NO FUN...wait, fuck
---
When you get disconnected and banned because the dedicated servers have trash connection
---
Definitely. That same thing also originally applied to F13 (my first Asymmetrical title). I would talk, but would only play with a few friends at a time in Public matches. Again, embracing/wrlcoming that unpredictability aspect. Which was very prevalent early on when team killing was allowed, lol.
---
But yeah. Never understood how some players in that community, could gather the same 8 people night after night, to play Private matches.
---
I think what makes Asymmetrical multiplayer games unique, is that they are inherently meant to be played solo. To put a group of strangers in extreme conditions, and see what choices they make. 
---
I understand these devs have recently stated that swf was always planned. It's just hard to believe, when playing solo feels so much more natural in this game, after playing swf.
---
\*complains about the Cypress being unfair*
---
"I don't care about fair," 
---
Lmao get tf out of here, your bait is trash.
---
Ignoring the unhooked survivor, then finding them taunting you in an unsafe spot 50 seconds later has nothing to do with tunneling. Tunneling ensures you get it, but not tunneling doesn't save you from it.
---
Thank you! It’s beautiful!!!!
---
Nurses calling and whispers are good on her, as her massive lullaby and slow movement speed make it easy for survivors to hide from you, so tracking perks are super helpful. BBQ is always good, and so is hex ruin. Most of her add-ons are decent and you could really use any of them or none of them and be fine. Practice makes perfect, and if you keep at it, you'll be hitting those crossmaps in no time.
---
However, Professionals have standards.
---
Well, that was the most I've guffawed at midnight thirty in a long time...
---
The devs have mentioned a possible rework at some point. No idea what or when tho, or if they'll even get to it.
---
You know it Imma get Freddy nerfed because so many people are gonna complain
---
I agree, devs need to be less afraid to make more red rank viable killers.. Oh, and also less triggerhappy with the nerfs (hopefully dream pallets stay as they were, they were damn fun).
---
He plays peekaboo so much better than Meyers. Meyers is great too don't get me wrong. I went from Pig to Meyers so I just feel like I get a little of them both with Ghostface.
---
Getting him banned isn’t necessary he caught you slipping and tortured you and thats part of being a murderer
---
Probably not for a long time, they're few and far in-between, but maybe when the next chapter drops, so in a month and a half? I wouldn't expect one sooner.
---
Indeed. They would just need to really take their time with it.
---
Yea.
---
If you own them on a survivor already you will keep them, but to get them on someone you don't have them on you will have to unlock the teachables from Bill.
---
Works if you do it right.
---
In order to fight Freddy, Quentin had to become the ultimate weapon vs sleep.
---
They are bills teachables though they would still be free just you need to level him up to get them it just makes sense for them to be teachables for him.
---
Yes that art is awesome
---
Fair enough. After a little bit of research on the Delfy mentality, I see where you're coming from and I agree.
---
However, as long as BHVR remains inconsistent with handing out punishments, (punishing Legion add-ons while letting other exploits go scot-free) people are ALWAYS going to abuse exploits and tell each other about it, regardless of what you tell them. In addition, BHVR has a bad track record of leaving bugs in the game for an extended amount of time. Whichever way you may look at it, BHVR is at fault here. Punish the people abusing the bug if you need all that time to fix it, but I digress.
---
I know that you were talking about the big picture with the Delfy mentality but this specific bug is going to be fixed tomorrow anyway.
---
Anyone know what’s in it?
---
Yes i am
---
Originally it said PM, guess my phone was slow to update for the edit
---
NO. They are for a new killer.
---
The hell are you talking about? Ebony mori is a free win for any competent killer as it stands, and even an ivory is completely unfair to the survivor it is happening to. Getting hooked once means you die, think about how much of a time saver it is.
---
Would you be fine with an offering for survivors that makes it so they will have 2 guaranteed escapes from killer's grasp? Green one to affect one survivor, ultra rare one to affect all survivors.
---
Ebony mori is a ridiculously overpowered offering, it cuts the match in half. Both ebony and ivory moris deserve nerfs.
---
I had the same issue, try installing it through TapTap, that saved me time and was a lot easier
---
His speed is do fast that is hard to control, her ability allow him to control his speed for 5 seconds every 10
---
Rule number one against hag: Don't get put in the basement. Your whole team is probably going to get killed trying to save you. If someone does get put in the basement, it's not really worth trying to save them unless you have something like Borrowed Time, insta-heal, or Well Make it to get them out, and possibly urban to get in. I suppose you could pop the traps if you happen to have a flashlight.

---
Could be a game changer, like it can help or hinder you
---
*squeeks nervously*
---
Are you just permanently stuck somehow?
---
Can't struggle out, can't be picked up, can't be hit? That must be frustrating.
---
Did EGC kill you, or did the game permanently bug out? (I remember some glitches in EGC that forced the killer to wait until the survivor bled out because the EGC didn't kill them and they couldn't pick them up, but does being trapped count as bleeding out?)
---
Well, Myers is a pain in the ass to play against good survivors, but Huntress is a pain in the ass to play in some if not most maps. Depends on you who find more fun.
---
Friday the 13th has a mute button for each player too.

Nah, if you hit them within a couple seconds you’re not holding the game hostage or anything.  I imagine many players sorta pause for a moment when they’ve successfully blocked someone to let it sink in.

---
Yeah, often the smartest thing a killer can do is give up on chases if the survivor they’re after is better at looping than them or just has access to a particularly time-consuming loop like killer shack and they haven’t built any momentum yet.  If you get good at looping, you’ll probably often find killers peeling off you to target your more vulnerable teammates.
---
The offering you described is called DS a PERK that allows you to jump off the killers back after being hooked it's not overpowered overpowered would be if you didn't have to get a hook at all you can still live even if killer has mori and who knows maybe your just a garbage survivor that has nothing to do other than whine about a offering
---
3/4 games people will just try unhooking in my face
---
Could you do plague please?
---
Youve seen how they did Quentin right? Have you seen his wife in this movie? You want the be responsible for bringing that hell to earth?
---
It is one game, but it's often completely unavoidable. You see that secret offering, very good chance the game is going to be unfun, quick, and you wont even get bloodpoints. Ebony is fairly common on the bloodweb despite it being an ultra rare, so for killers without an ultra rare addon, they get an ebony every blood web. We're lucky the killers dont use them often because of how often they depip when they get a mori 4k but I still see more moris then I see keys. 
---
And maybe it's because I mostly solo, but in my experience in purple ranks, killers really don't that extra help a mori gives. 4k are pretty common.
---
Planning on doing one for her 👌
---
Please post it here when you’re done. I’d love it. She’s my main killer.
---
That's awesome and I totally will post it
---
Literal meghead
---
Thank you so much. Much love to your art.
---
I don’t think anybody really cares all that much, camping has been a thing since the start of the game and I think most people have just accepted it as a part of the experience now. There’s a lot of entitled survivors who think you need to play the way they want you to, and it can be entertaining to watch them throw a tantrum.
---
Despite what I’ve said about obnoxious survivor mains, most of them will forget it in about 2 minutes after the match ends. Playing an online video game for hours for the sole reason of making other people miserable implies it’s probably more of an in-real-life you problem.
---
I never manage to escape as hillbilly. Good job!
---
No problem, good luck getting it worked out.  Maybe try a network support reddit or something, may get some traction there.
---
how can i see how many bloodpoints i earned?
---
Yea couldn't do anything. EGC indeed killed me forunately.
---
Dead Hard also grants invulnerability. Sprintburst without the bug is crap, nobody but meme megs and noobs ever used it, you either hobble yourself 90% of the time or lose a perk and go into exhaustion for nothing. But the way its now would be too strong.
---
But survivors know about curves and can prevent it happening or juke it
---
Literally I only Play legion when I play killer, I'm rank 10, and average around 2-4 kills a game, and people dm me saying how I only play Legion because they're "OP."
---
And god, some people can't spell Legion right. Ligeion, that's how they spelled it.
---
You are actually wrong. The time to blind was reworked so type of flashlight and add ons don’t affect this anymore. The duration of the blind (the time the killer is actually not being able to see anything) is still affected by this. The increase is however minimal and it is a lot better to use batteries still.
---
This is constantly happening to me. Very frustrating... Happens to me at least once every 5 matches.
---
No respect for the pallet
---
Tunneling only works on you if you're not good enough to escape the killer
---
Use sloppy butcher instead of thanatophobia. Sloppy increase the time 20% while thanatophobia is just 16% if you can hit all of them.
---
I mean Hillbilly gets played one out of every hundred games. Checkmate atheists
---
Thanks 🙂
---
It is weird, but then again, you get weird shit with mods sometimes.  Like if you use a custom soldier model in xcom 2, the little scenes at the main menu will suddenly be all spaghettified nightmare fuel.  The tiers being different is easy enough to explain as they all have different icons.  Could be something completely different as well.  It's not like BHVR doesn't break 37 things with every patch, so who knows, really?
---
Interesting. Two sprint bursts with no exhaustion sounds more like hacks to me, unless they've found a new SP exploit on top of the one that surfaced a couple weeks ago.
---
Welp, that exhausts my list of plausible explanations outside of "mods are apparently dicks"
---
It's good as a stealth perk, not for hiding, for when you get spotted. And running 35% faster than the killer means they won't be able to hit you unless they're huntress, nurse or billy till after it's ended. Unless you don't know how to run in the opposite direction of the killer. Even with clown bottles you're 20% faster than the killer.
---
*cries in clown on literally any map on console*
---
Discordance to know better when to use your power, sloppy butcher to be annoying with the heals, Save the Best for Last because it's easy to hit multiple people and ruin for obvious reasons.
---
Most dlc survivors suck. Only laurie has a perk kinda worth using
---
Leatherface is a must have for killers, his perk (bbq) doubles your points
---
Severe framerate drops when charging a hatchet.
---
Nah
---
It would activate when a hex perk starts being active which for most hexes is the start of the game. It's really just an idea to prevent a totem disappearing in the first 10 seconds of the game
---
XD
---
The skins are in the update if ya didn't know every chapter / mid chapter skins are data-mind. They then get released one by one each Tuesday/ Wednesday.
---
Then you predict their dodge by back revving if LOS is broken, or adjusting the curve to catch a dodge.
---
That's shitty for everyone though, not just the huntress
---
Who knows, I heard with freddies release they will patch some SB exploit, hopefully it's this nonsense I keep running into (since the only people to use it have been he red rank players at the moment)
---
They asked what was in the update lol . Now y'all coming up with stipulations . They are released weekly but they still in the patch lol.
---
True. Clown is the absolute worst for me. I end up not even being able to hit people from the 2 frames a second when I nut on survivors.
---
You can disable the chat yourself. Don’t take away my tool to make friends.
---
Also, there is such option.
---
Controversial opinion in this sub I know, but I don't think anyone should be banned for using perks or addons that are bugged. It's the dev's fault for not fixing it. In any other game shit like this would be fixed asap, but handing out bans instead of prioritising bugs is really disgusting to me.   
---
To be clear I never used legion blades, wake up or sprint burst. I don't like bug abusers - but I disagree that people should get banned for things that are in the game. BHVR are already disgusting with their ban system with zero communication with the playerbase.
---
Does the nurse really need addons? A god nurse can win the game 4k almost every game WITHOUT addons. Addons for nurse messes your muscle memory and/or to play the nurse without a bit of skill. I don't believe the streamer actually runs 5 blink nurse or omega blink.
---
Who won the standoff??
---
Myers is considered the most fun and balanced killer. Original power, fun to play as and against, and balanced add-ons that can also change the playstyle.
---
It's cool dude.
---
Are you playing on a toaster?
---
But we get it a day early😎console wars virgin money swag💵💵💵💵
---
Fuck me that would be amazing because of that dumbass shirt
---
I don't care what you say. It isn't really.
---
Dude got worked . Well played haha
---
And the radioactive waste.
---
Harriyah!  
---
Uuu, aaaa, IYA DA  
---
Also she swears in polish in lobby
---
Im pretty sure it does.
---
Yeah, but at the start as survivor you don't really have many perks so might aswell just get bloodpoints
---
She needs more in-depth rework really. Like rules set No.2 is just begging to be in her base kit and ambush is really weak with that early roar.
---
What about mom?
---
I really like the first perk. I would like to see a perk that allows the killer to interact with unused pallets (sort of like how we are seeing with Freddy now)
---
I really like it, needs a tad bit more shading though. Nicely done!
---
Someone's getting camped.
---
Happened to me twice so far, thank God it allowed me to destroy it the 2nd time even though I was in the same position as the 1st
---
Ye sure, using only 2 blinks need more skill to play nurse, but he never asked for an opinion based on a no add-ons nurse so I told him what happened to me. Honestly I play both side and I think nurse is pretty balanced if used with only 2 blinks because you need practice and to be smart in chasing survivors. I mean in some spot when you have a lot of open field it's very easy to hit but in other spots can become really hard. For example think about blackwater swamp (the one with the big house). Idk if it's just me but when I play nurse there, catch survivor outside the big house is pretty easy while inside, if the survivor is good, can be really hard. Btw with add-ons, using like 5 blink it's completely unbalanced. Even if you played nurse only 4/5 times in your life, getting at least 2 kills using a 5 blink nurse it's really easy, you just need to blink blink blink around the map untill you see someone and then after you get the first hook you can go wherever you want and come back to the hook in a couple of seconds.
---
Almost nobody can play Hag but imo she's the third best killer in the game
---
Off topic but is that a prestige knife? That looks cool as fuck
---
All these down votes... kinda proves you may be the idiot in this situation..
---
It's to tell you what gen you're going to. It'd be bad if you had to hope it locked onto the one you want. But yeah, it needs to be a different colour for sure.
---
This reminds me of Alice in Wonderland
---
Why?
---
I know how they get released its just you said it like were getting them all tomorrow
---
Another nurse dickhhead oh wow how original , KYS
---
Plugged in
---
Let's all sit and listen to your ideas then.
---
What, you want the same pallets spawns so survivors go through the same route game after game?
---
Or do you want less pallets and more gen progress so it's a race against time?
---
Or do you want to ban SWF? I do, but the game would die without it, and so it's necessary.
---
Maps are getting reworked, killers are getting reworked. Meta perks are being changed, and new killers are being released.
---
New killer: Sister Friede
---
Like just for the monto reference
---
Whenever I see the words "Exposed: Rancor" I start shitting myself
---
Can you make some for mobile
---
Myers is better than him, sure, but he isn't a ttash killer
---
Purple gives 75% thickness while default is 25%. It won't stack after using one purple
---
It isn't rule or falls into category of survivors "imaginary rules" as a killer especially in red ranks it benefits you a lot to eliminate one survivor as fast as possible to alleviate pressure and makes controlling/farming rest of them easyer..., especially playing M1 killer that does not have instant down mechanic.
---
If I can derail you into swarming hook instead of fixing generators because your buddy is nagging you on VOIP to save him I will do it..., is it fair? NO, but I'm kind of here to kill you with hatchets not kindness...
---
Only according to U/GoFuckYourselfGayboy
---
Also what the fuck is that guys user name
---
Low quality gang where you at 😩
---
Thanks dude. Watching too many Noob3 videos back then haha.
---
If only it stacked beyond one purbel
---
Nurse is like wtf is pallet
---
Can you make one for ghostface for a mobile phone please!
---
Agree. IMO 'farming' isn't playing the game. It's not why I loaded up the game and started to play. It's not fun. If the match is compromised, I'm going to still try to eke some enjoyment out of it and win, not run around and let them drop pallets on me. 
---
Sorry, but if some rude person DCs and screws over his teammates, that's not my problem enough for me to have to waste 15 minutes doing something I hate.
---
I still don't tunnel or camp though.
---
My rhetorical questions were aggressive, and I apologize.
---
However, the amount of times people believe in competitive games that the game will ever balance clearly doesn't compare other games together. There's always the op strategy or the cheat scheme. Certain people suck, certain people carry. It's impossible for game developers to account for players abusing tactics.
---
Rank 1 against three rank 15 and one rank 1. Rip them. No pip either.
---
Yea I see that discussions on the map reworks from 2 months ago.
---
This company is worth fucking millions and it's taking them this long to "rework" maps.
---
Well, they promised to rework maps, and reduce super secure loops, which is the biggest problem imho. Nurse, and Spirit will still shit on everyone, but at least more killers would become viable.
---
He probally expected to be face camped or morid which is why he dced because that's what dying light promotes you doing, just tunnelling the obsession
---
It's literally coming out today........
---
For 1 map?
---
Also, this takes time, they have to code graphics to avoid clipping, they have to make sure there's no invulnerability zones, and all pallets spawns work. Make sure there's no irregular hatch spawns or map pitfalls.
---
Your laugh at the end makes the video
---
Holy shit! Lmfao I was definitely not expecting that
---
And the Freddy rework. He's getting one of the most complex abilities of all the killers.
---
Well there are some that give additional bp in a specific category like prove thyself (obj.bp), NOLB (alt.bp), thrill of the hunt and beast of prey (hunt.bp) and and a couple others probably
---
Hahahaha I couldn’t stop myself it was too funny.
---
Oh I wish but the licensing issues
---
I mean ofcourse its shitty but I would rather re-qeue than waste all of my time.
---
The clown: can become disoriented from his own ability
---
I'm not sure whether I prefer old or new DS but I find myself having to run DS all the time because half the matches I play the killer sticks to my ass right off the hook.
---
Weird that it skipped the last 5 seconds worth on the bar like that. I just don't get why it sometimes does that.
---
Clown mains just sit in a corner to go on LSD trips
---
How I make it sound like they were smh yourself lol.
---
Please Don’t Type Like This. It Is Very Annoying.
---
(This is the same moron who thought the killer taking the game hostage for 20 minutes is okay and is also so new they can't beat Freddy. So.)
---
Is this the mobile version?
---
Thiccc tripple thick
---
Same wtf. You also started when you saw the ghostface trailer?
---
Go chew on them. Nom nom :)
---
Where is your logic here? You comment makes me assume you didnt understand my nr.2!  
---
Btw I am Rank1 killer after every reset with EZ!
---
&gt; Decide to break the chase and find someone else? That's a stupid fucking idea because the exact same loops and safe pallets are on the other side of the map.
---
That's not the point though. Matches with 4 excellent loopers are *very* rare. In most cases, you only have 1-2 good loopers, maybe a flashlight warrior who follows you the whole time but who cares, it's time they don't spend repairing gens. Usually there's always at least *one* "gen bitch"/immersed player who can be downed within seconds and give you the time you need to pressure the rest of the team.
---
Of course the loops and safe/unsafe pallet distributions are the same. But the player's experience is different. Loops don't matter if the players don't use them wisely or drop pallets left and right, which means they waste their own resources and get themselves in trouble as soon as most pallets are gone (stronger endgame for you).
---
Just saying a singular giant wall of text isn’t a good way to make people want to read your post
---
Nurse and Spirit don't give a shit about pallets. Billy on the other hand ...
---
The graphics quality doesn't matter
---
Eh I don't let anyone go for any reason. Too many toxic survivors out there. Also they can win with 3 it's entirely possible
---
Something like that happened to survivor when I was a killer. That was so freaking annoying.
---
Freddy to his fullest potential...listen, people won't even hide from freddy as they will just laugh it off. From rank 20-10 he can be somewhat a god killer. But after that, magical things happens. You'll get genrushed, with a single person who's gonna take the aggro, and believe me, everyone knows how to loop with perfect timing and precision. Now, the big question: does his ability help him in the chase? Nope, it doesn't. Freddy can also be tracked during transition and he's literally m1 killer who cannot punish altruism. Given how many detection perk are in the game and stealthy playstyle isn't meta right now, he's really bad, he'll almost always lose in rank 1 without addons also because he has no map pressure.
---
Let's talk about freddy after rework. He's a good killer now, kinda like the hag but with more range mobility in exchange of his cooldown. Traps slows down the survivor, making them slow vault everytime and possibly catch on safe loops like jingle gyms or shack loop. So now he has map pressure and chase potential. He does no longer slow down the game directly but thanks to his abilities he's gonna get more kills and force them to be altruistic.
---
Shit you're right.
---
I also play in low quality lol
---
The fog is so dummy thicc it's stabbing my eyes! x.x
---
Damn they release dbd onto Nintendo switch?
---
It's a dev cosmetic. It mean you was playing vs dev or guy who hacked it.
---
**PISS!**
---
Skillcheck builds have diminishing returns as you rank up - survivors are constantly drilled into passing them, so it's risky to rely on that. Terror Radius builds also have their drawbacks if you're not using add-ons, since you're basically giving people plenty of time to run away from you.
---
The only reliable Doctor strat I've seen at high levels is to 3-gen or stack instadowns and healing penalties. 3-gen usually means 3k, unless you gamble by slugging the third so you can chase the fourth (and potentially lose both to Adrenaline), while instadowns means it's a lot easier to keep survivors in Madness II (usually with Restraint, so they can't hide) since you can Static Field them at your leisure *and* you're completely divorced from relying on skillchecks.
---
My Ruin gets round pretty much every game. Maybe 1/25 do I actually end the game with an active Ruin. Is it worth it? Maybe. I say yes simply because as you’re learning a killer you need something to slow the generator completion rate but also you’re taking a large risk cause Ruin can be found very easily (either people make the mistake of going to their Ruin immediately giving its position away or they spawn nearby it and survivors check that area to fin it too). I always say if you’re gonna Run Ruin, be prepared to only have three perks for a majority of the game. 
---
The other situation you described means the killer is running multiple hex perks. I wish hexes could jump between totems after a brief cooldown period. Like Destroy Ruin -&gt; 100 sec CD -&gt; Thunderclap And it’s back. Rinse and repeat until no more dull totems.
---
People who are salty I guess. I tend to do pretty good on Haddonfield tbh
---
Pretty much.
---
Definitely bloodpoints
---
Legit, came here for the game tips, stayed for the great memes, always gives me a chuckle plus everyone's pretty nice here 😁
---
The only killer capable of unhooking survivors in front of the killer.
---
Nr.1 and Nr.2 would be enough for most rational players but for me is Nr.3 the major part.As killer if I mess up its my fault. As survivor there are sooooo many toxic players that will mess up your game aswell because you triggered them somehow and now they colaborate with the killer.You can have the perfect match and a chance to escape and one guy f\*\*\*s you up because of low IQ reasons.
---
people who lose get upset and need to make excuses... bad killer is OP... lol i get called a camper when i mori someone with Devour hope.... cos yeah i can be near the hook for that to get stacks, its usually salty ass bads who don't know the game or are new and think they know it.
---
Nike Mike?
---
Great clip. Don't listen to any nonsense about using noed. You did a great job as killer.
---
His power exposes multiple people if they're close enough together. 
---
And he exists because people begged for him for a long time.
---
6 months but ok.
---
That makes a lot of sense with the crouching and stalking then the mask and cool coats :o
---
The ship is sailing strong with this one
---
A power that can’t down and the deep wounds which literally do nothing anymore besides waste time (in a meta where gens can be done in seconds half the time) I’d say having a time waster is fair
---
I got a message after getting a 4k saying “Play a killer that requires skill.” (I was playing Myers which is labelled as a hard killer btw).
---
I couldn’t reply or see your comment until hours after you said it, but ok. You forgot to switch to your alternate account
---
Patched bugs. New bugs.
---
I like the agitation one. the maze would be hard to implement, unless it was off the the side of the map and had a generator+chest in it.
---
Just go in a locker
---
Yaaay and nooooooo
---
To 4k with Myers you need good positioning, you have to time Tier 3 right, predict survivor movements, know how long each lunge is during each tier, and you need to have good pressure. A good Myers is scary, and has quite a bit of skill. But, it isn't hard to be a decent Myers. I wouldn't call him hard like the game does. For me he's somewhere inbetween Intermediate and Hard. He is pretty basic, you hold stalk while looking at someone, then tier up, find someone else, get 99% to Tier 3, get close to them, hit stalk for a second, get tier 3, stab. Rinse and repeat. But if you play like that, they're gonna get Gens done, which is when Pressure comes in. Pressure is the difference between a good Myers, and a decent Myers. (And pressure isn't always easy with a killer who mainly uses M1.)
---
Beast of Prey and Distressing are additional killer perks that reward extra blood points in certain categories. Prove Thyself multiplies BP as well for specific actions for survivors.
---
I have over 1200 hours and I made like 8 friends thanks to the end game chat. I still play with 3 of them
---
Redrum would be a sick hex perk if you could kill any amount of survivors
---
Chode legit made me stifle my laugh at 5:44 AM
---
I can wait for Bill. Thankfully Freddy is still on time for Prime Time.
---
She tought the killer was in front of her :^)
---
Metal gear solid 5.
---
For anyone who doesn't know, this is from samination's dbd parodies, show him some love!
---
&gt; only a small window where tunnelling is unacceptable, and it's then DEFINITELY unacceptable
---
Ok, then what other restrictions can we place? What further actions or tactics does a killer use that's unacceptable? How about for a survivor? Is NOED unacceptable? A mori? Ruin? How about Adrenaline? Dead Hard? Balanced Landing? Endless loop circuits? God pallets? Instaheal? Decisive? Borrowed Time? Saboteur? Body blocking? Where is the line, and who decides it?
---
This all gets into really problematic territory and people start getting this unearned outrage. You're free to choose the way in which you play, up to and including that which is deemed as "scummy". If you personally don't wish to employ certain tactics, by all means, refrain from doing so; however, you don't get to impose that same playstyle on others because of "moral" or "ethical" reasons. Nowhere in the official rules are any of the aforementioned things brought up as off limits. It's only been vocal groups of players trying to reshape interactions in order to make things more palatable for themselves because "muh gameplay experience". 
---
This is a video game, yes, and video games are about having fun, yes; *however*, this is an asymmetrical horror game where two groups are pitted against each other in an adversarial relationship. The killer is there to kill, and the survivors are there to survive. 
---
I have never once heard any of the same restrictions placed on killers applied to survivors. I have never once heard anyone suggest that a survivor should give up the chase after a certain period of time and let himself be downed, but plenty of people will say a killer should break chase if a loop is going to take too long. 
---
It's all one-sided.
---
No, when it first came out it had a snowing effect and that, combined with the way the game functions, and especially combined with certain killers (doctor w overcharged cosmetics, nurse, even legion frenzying) would just crash the game.
---
As a survivor main, this isn't true. I bitch all the fucking time.
---
Mmm survivor perk, plunders. Killer perk, agitation
---
Pass the boof to me too my guy and thx btw :)
---
But what would be its power?
---
they’ve never been designed to be used solely in the endgame. And think of how absolutely broken they’d be if they still worked the same with endgame collapse? Lmao they had to balance it to make it fair. The timer for the RBT is almost the same length as the EGC timer, and if you were killed in the exit while wearing a trap, all pig would have to do is open the exit gate after throwing on some traps and then patrol boxes to literally make it impossible to remove the traps. There’d be no way to play against that
---
You mean the dumbest?
---
How would agitation be bugged? No movement speed boost? Or go even faster?
---
New killer rework, I’d imagine to see a ton of Freddy and new Badham map variants too with the new pallet changes, ooh boy we get some good stuff tomorrow. Windows of Opportunity, it’s your time to shine.
---
Then they didn't change them.
---
My bet is you’d get the speed boost even when not carrying a survivor
---
No that's reserved for speed hackers
---
There's plenty of bugs, and the legion, well I'd recommend you to DC asap since he's OP in this port.
---
Yea, some angry kid on reddit, I saw a post on another thread and oh wowie. Lol
---
Ace not ash
---
Lol.
---
Nah that would make it no different than Devour Hope, making it one use and using Survs Genrushing in Proximity of Killer is for countering SWF.
---
SWF teams have this tactic to have one looping god surv keeping the killer engage, while other survs genrush nearby. This enables them to be on standby for rescue if looper goes down as well as keep Killer unable to focus on one person.
---
By making proximity genrushing punishable, Killer can deal with looper quickly and destroy SWF plan of winning.
---
Nice.
---
Its just some kid that made an account to comment here and be an ass.
---
11-12 AM EST usually
---
Legion needs to be nerfed in the mobile port, and for the other platform, well he needs to be buffed.
---
Not True.
---
They can rebalance perks around voice chat
---
"Survivors Rulebook for Killers!"
---
Jake's guardian angel was working overtime.
---
Every team will be a swf. NOOOOOOO
---
Yeah that was a good game. Nice house by the way
---
And you get a wallhack pig as killer.
---
Yah he will get a soft ban for that, 7 days
---
They made an account just to comment on the subreddit too lmao. Children...
---
Yea I just wait out the time over your slugged body instead ;)
---
Great! Now i can experience what's living in Shanghai is like without getting lung cancer.
---
You play Xbox right?
---
I’m sure we’ll get him it’d be dumb if we didn’t
---
Not to sound rude but...screw that, that would be beyond broken 
---
Instead change devour hope to only activate a hex totem once you’ve gained at least two tokens of it 
---
That way it’s not getting cleansed before you get any use out of it
---
**TAKE ME BACK! TAKE ME BACK! TAKE ME BACK!**
---
Decent on Billy better for killers like ghostface because you can't always get that exposed effect ya know
---
Everyone can be Claudette now...finally. 
---
Oof...
---
Yes please
---
Guys, he has been saying just negative stuff, and his account has existed for a total of 4 hours(at the time of my comment).
---
Look at his name, he is just trolling.
---
The game has improved significantly over the past year.
---
The Survivor perk meta has been smashed to pieces, thanks to the D-Strike rework and healing nerf. Now Survivors rely more on items to succeed.
---
Many of the weakest Killers - Hag, Trapper, Wraith and now Freddy - have been made much more effective.
---
That said, you are right that a Killer's success is largely based on map generation and whether they're up against an SWF group. The vanilla gameplay experiment confirmed as much.
---
There's little BHVR can do about the former, but they are working on improving maps. Badham Preschool has received as full rework, as will another map next March. This rework included a new pallet-loop generation algorithm which, if effective at improving game-flow, will likely be applied to all other maps later.
---
3, no reason to cleanse until it gets scarey
---
So, at 3-4 tokens all killers get extra speed and 1 hit downsq, unavoidable by survivors till the killer gets the 5th token, which the killer can avoid via proxy camping, promoting a pretty unfun strategy plus the fact that the survivors would have a harder time trying to save that hooked survivor as they are exposed.
---
Not a great idea imo
---
Plus, not sure they would just go and remove a perk
---
Looks pretty good for your second project keep it up (if you like it) I don't use it but lazypurple gave me a pretty good idea how torturing it can be
---
Why is he op in the port?
---
Or do bones?
---
That sea of cakes is going to give me diabetes
---
What is an asshole move is all insta-blind survivors with deciceve strike
---
Anyone who's been looped by a god tier surv while two gens pop 10m away would want this lool
---
Thats the plan! Tiers can be 5/4/3 gens or perhaps 4/3/2 gens depending on PTB feedback
---
I considered 3 but the reason I said 2 is following the line of thinking with cleansing dull totems before repairing the last generator
---
Give survivors a chance before things get bad
---
The killer becomes the survivor
---
ok
---
Depends on map.  A skilled billy with good awareness and a balanced map can perform well.  I’ve asked many skilled billy players that play him almost exclusively (ryanpez69, QuixoticGreen, OhTofu, and battleguy) if he can keep up with swf with the best addons and perks and only OhTofu (who plays him the least of those 4) says he can’t.  
---
I’m also a somewhat skilled billy player and I agree with the sentiment that a skilled billy on a balanced map with the “crack billy” addons can compete just fine due to his curving mind game.  This is also discounting the inevitable mistakes survivors will make that a billy can punish more heavily that spirit or nurse due to his instadown.  The 50/50 curving guessing game is Spirits thing too which makes her strong, it’s just it’s way harder to pull off with Billy and it’s sometimes not possible to do depending on maps.
---
How is that a noob build?
---
Ew a Voldo player.
---
Is every 1500+ hours player a toxic tryhard?  
---
I’ve gotten maybe 80 hours in this game and of course because they like to rank reset every 10 minutes I get matched with those people.  
---
They will tryhard the everliving shit out of the game.  
---
They say killers are toxic for camping.   
---
Let me tell you what I find toxic about survivors:  
---
Bodyblocking: it doesn’t make any sense that I can’t walk past someone to get to someone else. This is toxic.  
---
Abusing game mechanics: Survivors in dying state who wiggle around windows to make it harder to pick them up.  
---
They’ll crawl under hooks(with another survivor on it?). I literally couldn’t pick them up until the survivor on the hook was sacrificed.  
---
Body blocking at hooks. Why can’t I hook someone when there’s a 80 pounds crouching piece of shit blocking 1 meter from the hook?  
---
Faking hook rescues to take a hit so the killer cant grab you off, then he has to “reload” his weapon for about 10 minutes, because balance.   
---
If you and a survivor are at an open hatch, the survivor already won, unless they’re exposed. How is this balanced?  
---
I understand those are tactical plays, but they’re stupidly frustating and makes the game seem goofy to me. I shouldn’t have to mindgame as a killer when someone’s at a hook. You don’t fuck with killers and live. 
---
How can survivors claim killers are toxic, when they pull that shit?  On top of every survivor having Borrowed Time, DS, adrenaline, dead hard, balanced landing, sprint burst, w/e other meta perks that makes them unkillable/ uncatchable.  
---
Can I claim that gen rushing is toxic? No, because the survivors try to survive. Well, I try to kill you. Yet I, as a killer, have to abide these unwritten rules made up by sweaty 2k hours survivors.
---
Howwwww
---
I too conflate these things.
---
What do you mean “you have no choice but to prestige?” You totally have a choice.
---
I'd be all over this dude, only watched the shining like a month or two ago and I felt like Jack would make for a really interesting killer lmao
---
That and killer is a wittle bab- 3 kills huh
---
I feel if they did this though, survivors  would just break it before it got any real action
---
Much like noed, I shouldn't be cleanseable until either there are no totems or the perk gets scarey
---
The Game is a great surv map! also great for certain killers/builds (mainly stealthy ones... and super shock doc) . 
---
i love this map and would take it as surv or killer everygame
---
I usually make sure to apologize to everyone post game if this happens. Real shit '-_-
---
Maybe not full capacity I suppose. DH gets cleansed before it can be used so maybe like 2 tokens like you said. I think it would be a better alternative to noed though, because the killer has to earn the 1-hit
---
I dare not guess because there's no logic when it comes to what breaks or not with every patch. Behavior has built their game on a foundation of buggy mess of spaghetti code..
---
I would love to see the legion!
---
I wish, they bitch every single time
---
As someone who plays survivor and killer, garlic bread is delicious
---
Dbd mobile?
---
Is this a joke, Legion's knives bug was around for ages before the fix...
---
Plus like Ash is a quotable survivor (tbh he got very annoying quickly) Jack can be quotable as the killer, he can say *Heere's Johnny* while grabbing Dweets off lockers and *Danny, I'm Home!* While hooking someone in basement
---
We can use his dialogues during Maze scene when he is unable to find any survivor like Huntress' hum gets agitated when she has nothing to do for a while.
---
Badham should be fixed soon. Lery's is a weird one. Lots of killers can destroy on that map. Trapper, Spirit, Nurse, Huntress, Mikey, GhostFace, Pig, Legion, Doc, Leatherface &amp; Hag all have good options on it.
---
Mother's dwelling... don't get me wrong that House is savage as a surv but there are lots of cutoffs for experienced killers. It sounds like you have trouble shutting down the loop, would you agree?
---
No Mither=OP, look at my 7 upvotes of people agreeing with me
---
Just remove the speed boost from noed. One shot is more than enough.
---
Sorry i play Tekken
---
As long as survivors don't have a change
---
Maybe one on bing bong boi
---
It had a fucking memory leak too.
---
Do some killers want survivors to just sit there and die? If you find a looper, IGNORE THEM. Go for the people doing the gens. If you get 4 loopers, which isn't very common, there's not much you can do other than try to pressure the gens. If you nerf survivors more because of SWF, the solo experience will be even worse. Try playing solo survivor. Instead of "Oh no! I have to chase someone instead of just hitting them as they stand there?" Solo survivors get "Every game has 3 Megs sprint bursting across the map not doing gens, being farmed over and over, and dying because you're the only person who even touched a generator."
---
Aqualung.
---
Not paying 5$ just for a single perk.
---
Spirit's ability seems unfun, just speed and mindgames?
---
God please no anything but Haddonfield.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one lol
---
*cries in ching chong*
---
So... are the dedicated servers launching today with the mid chapter update?
---
I dont use haed on until its rly fixed the hitbox for this perk is just a joke. It doesnt work when it should work and sometimes it hits when the killer is 5 meters away. No matter if you got a good ping or not. I would be a really fun perk to use but its just not actually working the way it should. At least 2 of 3 times when i use it fails. And i know how to use it.
---
It was just a huge disaster and proved they aren’t ready to program stuff like that.
---
Dude I'd love if he had agitation as its own mechanic, since he's not exactly portrayed as a calculated killer lol
---
Oh well. The point is it's not camping if the survivors are clearly meters away from the hook. How good can you be at the game if you can't even understand that?
---
they do if they’re active?
---
This is the power of my Stand, Ping Crimson!
---
Only if you lessen with the common offering (-50%) you will be able to use another thick offering, but the gap is 100%
---
As long as he gets his thong too
---
I’m a red rank killer and survivor. Nice try tho
---
Typical killer main ruining the game...
---
Is the doctor fun though? I know he is around midtier but interputing survivor actions with his power seems really fun.
---
Also are you sure about ruin? Every single youtuber/streamer i've watched uses it, and every killer i go up against in higher ranks has it.
---
If not ruin, then what do you suggest on billy?
---
Is BBQ also good?
---
My guess is sounds get messed up again.  Survivors movement/breathing noises become silent to killers but not to other survivors and chase music is obnoxiously loud.
---
Yeah he has to be maniacle, not hooking anybody for long shall make him start hallucinating or something but it has to equally affect survs too in some way, otherwise it wouldn't be fair.
---
I love that you just butchered someone up and thought "That shit would look fabulous on me"
---
Yeah you can be anything you want on the Internet.
---
What are you on about? BHVR never gave up on DBD! Development has been incredibly active since day 1!
---
Nope, i play mostly on pc.
---
Whenever there's a DC, I just try to end the game as soon as possible so we can move on to an actual match.
---
But the doctor and the hag weren't free?
---
Blind insults such as YoUrE bAd don’t always work bud
---
the funny part is the killer never had seen feng again for a while
---
Sure, I'd like to see a legion one, You can either do just Frank or all 4 of them, I'm okay either way :D
---
For me it’s haddonfield, and badham (thank god it’s getting a rework). But the swamp and yamaoka estate are a pisstake for killers. They’re so big u can’t do anything. What’s the problem with the ironworks though? I don’t mind those maps
---
I think they are free on console
---
Why would you leave when these survivor literally went braindead and tried to save IN FRONT OF THE KILLER . If you see them go down why the fuck would you also go and try to do the same damn thing the other dumbass did and get caught. Go do a damn gen
---
No cause you have to get in your obligatory  *CaMpInG KiLlEr hurr dur*
---
That happened to me I thought I had a trap put on me
---
Wait ... theres something off with that sentence....
---
You ran Scratched Mirror without a "Lery's" or "Game" Offering?
---
Raven? Boi get over here man.
---
Perks:
---
Here's Johnny!:
---
You're inescapable and bloodthirsty. Whenever a survivor pallet stuns you and you destroy the pallet, all other pallets, whether thrown down or not, will instantly break.
---
All Work and No Play:
---
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. If and when you reach bloodlust 2, you keep the bloodlust even after you attack. This remains until a survivor is down.
---
The hotel clerk:
---
You're in charge of who checks in and out and nobody is checking out. When activated, the exit gates gain 10 minutes open time and 5 generators are added to the map with permanent Hex:Ruin.
---
This post fucking killed me, good job
---
 Inmersive gameplay is boring tho
---
If I'm making blind insults than so are you. The only people who try to call everything camping are salty survivors.
---
He had the survivor in hand meters away from the hook. I would just replace the survivor on hook and then chase the other 2 down.
---
Ye but they are making it less immersive.
---
These are awesome! Could you do the clown? He is my favourite killer but there is barely ever anything about him
---
...but I’m not making blind insults. You literally posted gameplay
---
I would personally buy the Spirit. She is one of the best killers in the game and Spirit Fury is great on the vast majority of killers. The Hag has Ruin and Devour Hope which are good perks as well but she has a particular play style that a lot of people don’t find fun. I personally don’t enjoy playing the Doctor at all and find him to be one of the worst killers in the game. A lot of people disagree with that though
---
Bbq is mvp
---
The last point is about how it's not good for Killers to chase one Survivor for too long, as it results in a lot of Gens being done while you accomplish nothing.
---
Otherwise, great argument
---
Completely unbalanced, as all community-suggested perks should be
---
Ghostface's addons were also all changed.
---
For a second this was my clip but then I remembered I had a P1 Claud with different hair style and the window was open. Also there was BIG LAG and the billy teleported behind me where I was stuck at a pallet (because I was meant to drop it).
---
Glad I didn't save up blood points for Bill now.
---
Also lol what a shock that Sony is the one getting fucked over again. It's always us.
---
Yeah, hate those sudden jumpscares
---
Elaborate!
---
Borrowed time to help getting a safe hook rescue
---
We’ll make it to heal at 100% times the normal healing speed when you unhook to heal your unhooked teammate really quickly 
---
No one left behind gives you bonus bloodpoints for doing altruistic action and you can perform them quicker
---
Borrowed time is the most used 
---
We’ll make it is solid
---
No one left behind us kind of pointless most of the time
---
That poor billy getting held hostage 😢
---
A ok, I'm a console player, didn't know that, I would recommend to wait, if you only want the hag for ruin, wait to the sanctuary, but if you also like her buy it
---
very glowy
---
I don't think hag is the 3rd best killer, maybe 5th or 6th
---
Ooh, this is fun! My guess: Distortion will have its effects active for the full match after the first token is consumed, making the survivor running it permanently leave no scratch marks and have no aura.
---
I prefer "Death Star" addon
---
Yeah i love the bonus BPs
---
Pig has a time waster too. Pig is toxic now too I guess.
---
The hatch aura is red if I recall well, but you have to be at a range of 8 meters to see it – I found it once or twice with an odd stamp add-on.
---
*Mr. Blue Sky plays as Ghostface exposes someone*
---
Don't feel bad. Itll be the other way soon enough
---
My man
---
"About 77% of the population live in the western, European part of the country"
---
From wikipedia now stfu
---
Indeed
---
Which means that the gameplay SHOULD get better I think is what the original comment means
---
I think you're reading too much into what I was saying. I was self-restricting, saying as a killer there is one circumstance that I think is definitely off-limits. 
---
When I'm survivor, I hate it when I perceive tunnelling, and camping, but I do appreciate there are degrees of flexibility. 
---
Just to be clear, I'm a killer-Pig main. So this isn't me being unfair, this is me just saying what type of behaviour I don't engage in because I think it's not right.
---
Image a ghostface, nurse combo.... Image a ghostface,legion,nurse combo... Oh god that would be horrifying
---
I just finished a match and went to put some points in and it freaked out like this @.@
---
Alert, lightweight, botony knowledge, and deliverence
---
Single perk that costs 5$ of real life money. and 5$ is a lot in my country.
---
Spine chill, urban evasion, self care, and balanced landing
---
I feel like it would be more relevant if it increased your terror radius by a bunch. Map-wide Coulrophobia at full stacks during a chase.
---
Shame. Also franklins is godlike against swf
---
Nobody:
---
OP: I am gonna make a Nobody meme which will make no sense Ha!
---
Happened to me a handful of times on Xbox. Annoying as all fuck.
---
My usual perk build is, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, DS and Borrowed Time 🤣
---
Other perks I love using: Plunderers, Ace in the Hole, Resilience, We’re Gonna Live Forever, Prove Thyself, Pharmacy, Streetwise.
---
But in order to perform Mori you have to down the survivor first. Or in this case you'd have to grab surv of the gen, then drop on the ground and just THEN you can do Mori.
---
Nope just like commenting and helping people anyways think this was a good chat may we see each other possibly In a match or on reddit.
---
Dead Hard, Urban Evasion, Quick And Quiet, Spine chill.
---
Anything but Coldwind* 
---
FTFY!
---
Kurwa indeed
---
I'd prefer him breaking pallets with an axe and yelling that.
---
This happened to me and I died from the end game collapse because killer was blocking the only exit gate as leather face...
---
Thank you^^
---
That’s not even that bad tbh
---
Ghostface about to get knocked the fuck out.
---
If you wanna give your friends a really spooky match, try Dark Devotion, I'm All Ears, Overcharge, and Nurse's Calling. 
---
It's not a good build but I have a ton of fun with it.
---
No skill? He's complete trash
---
I dont think nurses calling works on mending.
---
I did my most maniacle laugh watching that!!
---
My logic is being rank 5 and it's very hard to pip since the emblems are overtuned
---
Probably a high chance, especially if the SWF are really experienced.
---
I would like to know!
---
Legion actually dies if they get pallet stunned.
---
The best build I've seen on Huntress in my opinion is BBQ and Chili, Nurse's Calling, Ruin, and Shadowborn or Whispers. With Huntress you can end chases faster than a lot of other killers because of your hatchets so most people dedicate their perk slots to being able to help find people easier. You've just started though so I would recommend running Whispers, Bitter Murmur, Sloppy Butcher, and Huntress Lullaby. I would suggest avoiding addons that speed up your wind up. Play some games with her so you can get a feel for how long it takes to wind up and throw normally. Accuracy will come over time. Also a thing to always remember is that huntress is naturally slower than most other killers so you want to avoid hard committing to a chase if you're out of hatchets and they're in a good position. Best to find the nearest locker to reload and then go back to chasing. Huntress is a very unique and awesome killer! She takes a lot of practice so don't get too discouraged and I hope you end up loving her as much as I have!
---
Myers have addons which let him do insta mori by grabbing survs mid chase.
---
It’s a bug that behavior is taking their sweet time to patch, as per the norm. You can tell it’s happened when you can’t heal yourself, use dead hard, struggle off the killer’s grasp, or recover. Only two choices are DC’ing or waiting until you’re the last survivor and try to find the hatch.
---
I only bitch about camping. 
---
You tunnel(ignore anyone else in favor of killing me right after getting unhooked) me? Cool. 
---
You wanna run NOED, Devour Hope, Spirit Fury, and Enduring?(the perks i hate most)Fine. 
---
You wanna play Doctor(i hate the doctor. Not op but i just hate playing against him cause it’s unfun)? Alright. 
---
Face-camping insidious Leatherface with addons to chainsaw faster? Now listen here you little shit.
---
Thank you ❤️
---
How many hours have you spent on this game?
---
Honestly, it sounds fake. But we’ll exchange ggs and they’ll say something like 
---
“Those Head ons were impressive” 
---
“I got so frustrated lol it was a good match xD”
---
“Were you the Jane? The stuns were real LOL” 
---
As long as no ones mad, then I feel good using it.
---
Ace In The Hole, Plunderers, Adren, SB. Gonna swap SB for BL or Dead Hard once i unlock them but i’ll probably wait until i prestige to P3 to start really trying with my builds.
---
I get a fair share of sore winners too...
---
All that matters about my build is diversion. Diversion best perk.
---
Decisive Strike, Deliverance, Unbreakable, Balance Landing + Haddonfield/Ormond/The Game map offering.
---
I don’t see the point in getting EVERYONE to P3 anymore.  There are all these cosmetics.  Showing up in P3 just makes it look like you have no life and all you do is grind at this point 😂
---
Hey, murmur is decent!
---
I’m a clown main and i think that you should break more generators with pop goes the weasel after you hook a survivor and when you hear a generator working on throw a bottle on the gen too slow down all of the players down that works on the generator.
---
When even the killer used the same offering.
---
We're Gonna Live Forever, We'll Make it, Spine Chill &amp; either Dead Hard if I'm going to be Altruistic or Resilience if I'm going to be a gen-jockey, sometimes both and I'll replace WGLF with them. 
---
Don't know if that's 'better' but it's what I run as a Survivor and it works just fine for me.
---
Bitter Murmur isnt that bad tho
---

Rightio, you don't get it. No need to be a dick about it  man

Escapes: I love exits.
---
That's not a direct quote. I never said half the country either? Keep pulling stuff out of your asshole. But considering you use wikipedia as your source I'm not surprised :) You are seeing what you want to see in my posts assuming I'm complaining about the Russians who live near the EU (European Union) borders. 
---
Also there is a case to be made about how shitty russian internet connections are usually. So yeah I can complain about russian players all I want. What are you trying to prove here?
---
SWF has that toxic stigma attached to it, you’ll always have killers who lobby dodge because they don’t wanna risk playing with toxic players.
---
I use Dead hard,Prove thyself,Spine chill and kindred, it's generator and survival build to make sure your team doesn't unhook when the killer comes back and dead hard for looping and avoiding hits however I think a perk I should use with the build is stake out to get past ruin for a few skill checks or detectives hunch(odd choice ik) to find the totem or just give  general information if you want to bring something else like a med kit.
---
Brutal Strength is almost essential on Clown and Doctor because everyone throws down pallets wicked early against them. The same might go for New Freddy as well. Ghostface can also make use of Brutal Strength over Spirit Fury as survivors play way safer when exposed. I've even seen some really good huntress players run Brutal consistently but I'm not fully sure why.
---
You're never gonna be sad to see Brutal in your bloodweb, so I'd say go for it. Agitation is another Trapper perk that is fairly underrated that actually saves a lot of time and helps out.
---
Never seen that before, I've been unable to pick up a survivor close to a window and kept a killer from picking me up though. 
---
Also, gotta love team mates, you kept him there for over a minute and not a single genny was done.
---
Another awesome thing about alert that I fortgot to mention is, for example, you can know if a spirit is phasing or if a trapper is puttin a trap, really useful to know and to say to a friend if you are in SWF. I will try tenacity!
---
Spine Chill: the ability to know if they killer is coming your way or in your area is great for positioning for easier loops.
---
Balanced Landing: pretty much the second best exhaustion perk. Only one map doesnt offer a drop the rest do. And in a way its two perks a sprint burst off high areas and quick recovery from said high areas.
---
Calm Spirit: I really enjoy the perk and combo'd with...
---
Iron will: no sounds, nothing im hit and I dip and cant find me again. 
---
Green medkit with charge addon and speed addon and Im golden.
---
Yes, when the patch is released
---
More then that it's around 1.3 million to get to lvl 40
---
I aaked the time
---
I love this map, a lot of bushes to hide in! And I don't mean it in the "Claudette hides all-game-long" way, it's good to hide in ocasionally, when you hear the killer approaching. It actually works very well.
---
Disturbed Ward is the most piece of shit map ever
---
There isn't a time
---
Replace self care with anything else and use a med kit
---
I follow a rule of three with ruin. 3 good skill checks or one failed skill check, and I start looking for it.
---
Well I never really switched. I still play survivor but what made me switch was just the state solo survivor is in. It not really fun not being  a solo survivor. I’ve played plenty of swf and I know it’s more difficult, but solo survivor is the most boring thing in the world. All you do is sit there doing gens waiting for the killer to come and when they find you, loop them for as many gens as you can. Survivors need something more interesting to do than sit on generators.
---
Isn't the max baseline 3200 (with BBQ 6400)? How are you getting 80k without bps or cake?
---
Nooo you silly, thats rule VK-85HG#7
---
I never really switched as I still play survivor. But solo survivor is the most boring thing in the world.
---
I think that would be awesome, I love storms

You’re only a dickhead because you didn’t slug the DS user so you can hunt his teammates while he does nothing and they have to waste time picking him up making his perk not only useless but also a hinderance to his team.

Never seen a post get so collectively shit on before.

I'll do my best to sum up the comments below.

Fuck off, no one cares about your temper tantrum.

Just the same as one purple

Dance With Me, Lithe, Autodidact and Empathy.
---
Not necessarily better in most situations but when you get five stacks of auto you can make some really clutch plays and it mostly ignores anything that slows healing.
---
I keep hearing that rumor.  Link? Also, he has posted a public apology for any negative behavior he's done in the past... is your view that he can never be forgiven?

Legion is a bit weak at the moment. Their ability is good when survivors are clustered together, allowing you to get the first hit on them and waste some time. Unfortunately he struggles at higher ranks because survivors will spread out once they know it's Legion. The ideal strategy is to deep wound as many survivors as you can on a frenzy to waste their time mending and then try to force the last survivor away from a very safe position by cutting them off, getting very close, and ending your power manually. Then you chase them down like an M1 killer. Legion is very different from their kit on release. You do not want to hit the same survivor twice while in frenzy as their meter will not go down anymore without the addon, Frank's Mixtape. Also try not to go out of your way to find other survivors if killer instinct doesn't pick them up shortly after getting your first proc unless all the survivors are wounded. Just end your frenzy and try to down the survivor you're on. The addons that I feel are useful are the cooldown reduction addons, the duration addons, and the mending time addons. Iridescent button is also good. I would also try to get the perk Save the Best For Last if you're able too. Legion is extremely good at stacking it up quickly. Good luck with them! They're a fun killer, but just face the normal struggles of M1 killers. 
---
he just told you that it would be as if there is only one purple fog addon

Spirit is stronger than Billy and you can't change my mind.

All the easier to reach your g spot with, my dearie

So Myers with a jewelry box?

I'd be open to it if you could offer actual evidence rather than just a video of someone talking about him.

Nope, wraith

if you want the real post : https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/cfnarw/ritual_perks/

I would say it’s absolutely worth it. The hardest part about playing killer is managing the survivors. Right when the game starts when they have a full healthy squad and every pallet available, you are at your weakest. One bad chase and three generators will pop. This is not even an exaggeration. Ruin helps slow this extremely disadvantaged beginning giving you a bit more time to turn the tides to your favor. 
---
Personally, I believe the game hates me, and will always spawn ruin by a gen. In which case it will last one gen completion if I am lucky. But some games it’s the fame changer allowing more control over them.
---
If you want the highest odds of winning then you should always aim to force a 3 gen situation if possible. If you watch Monto's videos, you'll see that he normally will let them get gens far away because they are too far away to patrol/protect.
---
The video contained a chip from ochido’ stream telling his follows to go after a player he went up against, sorry you are unable to follow up on what people give you, but I have better things to do than force feed you facts about how scummy ochido is.
---
I mean killer mains only complain when they lose, like what point does this try to prove.
---
h’rua
---
You just walk around with pebbles?
---
Ohhhh im an idiot
---
The trapper loved that!
---
Staying invisible as Wraith the whole match is not bannable, no. Doesn't matter where exactly. You will depip and survivors won't, unless they run around the whole match.
---
This is your response to "lol ok" ? Jesus Christ dude, give the internet a break for a day or two you miserable fuck.
---
well in the end of the film he dies in the snow so they could add some sort of decay and ice all over him. the design team is creative enough.
---
Ok thank you
---
Didn't people also predict that the last sets would be Piggy's? I swear people are good predicting when stuff comes out isn't 11 am when the new outfit set comes out also?
---
I like to play Buba with insidious sometimes and name myself basement security and protect the item box. Always at the end, even if I don't see anyone, I just type basement secure hahaha
---
Cry more lmao
---
I bitch when I pip, I bitch when I don't pip. I bitch about almost everything. But mostly just to myself or my friends, I leave the killer out of it.
---
your would need to live in Montreal to be able to help
---
Pig's sets have already been released!
---
I mean even if he gets nerfed I’m still excited because it’s like getting a new killer again for free (if you have him now)
---
when im a killed and spawn next to a gen a try and work on it
---
Haddonfield has infinites with balanced landing
---
Nahh, you just misunderstood, it happens lol
---
I now was saying they predicted that they would be the last set releases but is 11 am when they release the new outfit sets right?
---
Now if only I had that kind of luck when I play, all I get to happen to me is instantly discovered the moment the match starts, every escape option is walled off, not there, or actually worse than running away normally, and I’m hooked immediately after because of how fucking unlucky I get most of the time
---
Haven’t even gotten to exit gates powered in any match 7 times in a row with my luck
---
They could also have the butler guy as the survivor. The one who could shine too
---
I'm just giving advice. Not my fault you are broke. Lol
---
Good point, I don't know if that's true in red ranks and you're probably right, but I'm sure it's the case for everything above that.
---
Good
---
I'd like to see one for ash
---
Gotta love instant karma.
---
;(
---
we will get the patch notes for today's update today.
---
I'm sorry, I've seen all the people telling me "DoNt tElL oThErS hOw To PlAy" but I genuinely do not understand NoEd on hillbilly. All feelings for the perk put aside I just don't get it.
---
For the record, Windows of Opportunity can't differentiate dream pallets from real pallets, it sees them all the same (unless they changed it on the PTB and I missed it...?)
---
Oh my god I've never thought of this cross over. Him as killer on an Overlook Hotel map. Jesus that would be the best dlc hands down
---
"The Mist" in a nutshell
---
You can play around ds? You slug the survivor and then they don't get to use the perk. You can't play around a mori, you just get morid.
---
You are comparing a perfectly fair anti-tunneling perk to a broken offering.
---
I got my first 4 iridescent badge game with Legion and I've never been more happy of that game, the survivor's even hit me with GG's since it was a fun match.
---
Context?
---
I thought purple+brown was 100%
---
Fuck off cunt.
---
Two days before the day after tomorrow.
---
Are you suuuuurre you don’t want insidious? Well just in case I’ll put it in the next 27 bloodwebs
---
Sorry to tell ya mate, but a lot of the things you’ve pointed out are really not that toxic. A good portion is just the game’s mechanics and using them to their fullest. 
---
If you are healthy it’s smart to swarm around the injured to keep them from going down. Hell running an escort is sometimes the only way to help them have a chance at escape. To counter best you can do is to try and cut them off at certain angles, but sometimes it is what it is. 
---
For dying survivors positioning, just make sure it’s going to get them before you press the button, not much more to it. 
---
If they are bodyblocking the hook, just hit them. Best case scenario, you get free hits and a hook. If it seems that you are not going to be able to get the hook, drop the survivor, and focus down a protector. You might be able to have multiple in the dying state, or at the least injure most of them, putting you in a better position. 
---
If they are going for the save right in front if you, just have them switch places, putting another survivor on the hook for free is a huge benefit to you. 
---
When at a hatch you have priority when interacting with it. If you press to close it, more than likely you’ll beat their jump animation. Attacking them is borderline pointless, unless it is for sure knocking them a good distance away. 
---
You don’t have to abide by any rules. If it is not an exploit, everything goes. If you wanna do a tactic that most people look down on, go for it, no one can stop you. Killer is tough, and could definitely use some tweaks, but playing the game optimally is not toxic. Being an ass is toxic.

It felt like an ASMR channel decided to make a killer tier list video.

But imo slightly better than Billy. One thing that doesn't make her way better than Billy is Object of Obsession, espeiclly with a flashlight.
---
Na, it's common. MYC belongs to a killer that doesn't have mobility. Stridor belongs to a killer that destroys your ears each time you use her power and can't hear.
---
Heres one for Medkits

---
I dont know if there is a current toolbox comparison.
---
Usually I just hear silence followed by that lobby music guitar riff.. as the killer has disconnected.
---
Happened to me just two days ago on PC against a Freddy
---
What his YouTube or Twitch channel?..
---
I want it please
---
Shitting on BHVR brings upvotes.
---
As a Claudette main, I can confirm this. Killer can't kill you if they can't see you. Though I'm not a full ok P3 Claudette, because I at least want to give the killer a chance of finding me.
---
That's some thicc ass mist
---
Okay I found xD
---
buys insidious and Unrelenting to hopefully get Ruin or Nurse's or Surveillance or BBQ in my next BW.
---
The next Bloodweb: INSIDIOUS II and UNRELENTING III and like 2 Strode Realty keys.
---
Oh I didn't know that. Does it work the same way with luck offerings?
---
Claudette with toolbox
---
He practically said that Huntress has a stronger chase than Spirit and Myers has as good chase potential as Spirit, which is really wrong in my opinion. The fact that Legion gets 10 on stall is also mind blowing for me, his stall really isn't that good because it's unlikely you will get 4 survivors injured unless they are all together on a gen. 
---
Hag, Myers and Huntress aren't better than Spirt and I also think Doctor and Trapper are pretty high.
---
Iron Will, Resilience, Adrenaline, and Lithe
---
FunGoose is also a fantastic killer player to learn from, he communicates his thoughts very well as he plays. He also has an encyclopedic knowledge of a lot of the game's stats such as the amount of time to do various actions.
---
Distortion &amp; spine chill 👍
---
I either run the usual meta (DS, DH, BT, adren), field medic (BT, We'll make it, wglf, random exhaustion perk), or a mix of stuff like (spine chill, bond, prove thyself, lithe).
---
Spine Chill, Iron Will, Lightweight, Bond. Just started playing a month ago, so looking to unlock Poised, Lithe, and Dance With Me, and work those into my builds when I'm feeling spicy. Loving everyone's builds they're sharing on here. Keep 'em coming!
---
He doesn’t have huntress or myers better than spirit
---
Thanks! I will probably go Save the Best for Last/Hex: Ruin/Enduring/Spirit Fury when I'm not as desperate in need for BP. Thank you very much!
---
Did people not watch the full video before commenting
---
Yes all survivor mains bitch. Great another survivor bad post.
---
Insidious is S tier for meme builds.
---
\*waves\* Bye, don't forget to write... you seem to be pretty good at it!
---
F13 isn't a good game though.
---
Also. You could like.. turn the chat off and make it so people can't message you? Idk. Seems sensible to me.
---
You probably already know, but you can block messages from strangers on console, and if you play on PC you can hide the chat, in addition to putting your steam profile in private or deactivating the option for people other than your friends to comment on your profile
---
Destroying a pallet is faster then going into frenzy, vaulting it and going through fatigue
---
What???? One is taking the game hostage and the other is non game altering BM. PLS dont compare the two.
---
Lol thanks for proving my point ✌️
---
I think nurse is one of the hardest killers to master. her movement is mostly reliable to her blinks, thats why shes so slow compared to other killers. id suggest first trying to find out the basics of dbd, like playing survivor. knowing how survivors think makes it easier to predict them. which is a essential part of playing nurse. (sometimes you'll have to predict how they will move to make your blinks more effective and kill survivors more efficiently)
---
if you really want to play nurse, one tip: get close to the target (with the blinks). for what i know the way lunging and normal hitting works a little different. when doing a short hit. if the target is  close enough to you. the hit will automatically connect. which is way more reliable than a long lunge. and smacking has some kind of auto-aim which I dont really understand but that is also something to keep in mind.
---
waaahhhhhhhhh
---
Why would u not fit in addons and perks though? Everyone uses them, killers have 100s of each addon ready to go thanks to bbq n chili and constant double bp bullshit. Is this how the devs balance too by not taking addons and perks in consideration?
---
If I can expand on what was said above. While your add ons will stay and just become the new ones you may want to review what the new add ons do before spending points on them. For example the paint thinner can will give him the dream pallets after the update which a lot of people on the PTB have said are much more useful than his normal traps.
---
I hate how people compare a GAME to horror movies or killers behaviors.
---
I wholly disagree. Without the traps she would be a wholly worse killer. She wouldn't even really be from her source material anymore if her power had nothing to do with the cunning application of traps to survivors. 
---
And the new traps that I've detailed would slow down the game just as much, or more, than the old RBTs. It'd just add some pleasing variety without being too much of a buff, which is why itd be a QoL thing.
---
That's just my opinion though, i simply don't see why you'd want to play the Pig without her Jigsaws Baptism, and i think if they removed it, she'd just become an inferior Wraith or Ghostface, because without traps, that's all she is, unfortunately.
---
It was a test to see what you consider toxic, congrats... You Failed!
---
Now that we're on it. What is this offering there for anyway? It's neither useful for killers nor for survivors.
---
I never bothered blocking messages but I guess that’s not a bad idea
---
Bring me some pie!
---
Borrowed time does last 20 seconds, from the perspective of the survivor it sometimes seems like not enough time :P. 20 Seconds can seem very long when you are focused on downing survivors though.
---
When you hit a survivor with borrowed, instead of going down he gets a "deep wound" state, similar to what Legion does with his Frenzy ability, once the survivor is no longer being chased by the killer (if they are chased, the bleeding timer will stay static), they HAVE to stop to mend themselves (an action similar to self heal) to stop the bleeding timer before it runs out, if they allow the timer to go out then they will then go into the dying state
---
Some random skins on ps4 cause the game to stutter when playing as killer. I'm not surprised they're having issues.
---
Alert can also tell you if you're against a scratched mirror Myers because it won't activate the whole trial. Sure, you'll know eventually without Alert but you'll find out sooner this way and that's valuable information.
---
Cool, do you maybe want a pat on the back or something? We all face toxicity from 12 year olds playing, if you want to quit just do it.
---
Litreally nobody cares.
---
pallet looping is toxic? wtf
---
Use the hate to fuel your killer games. If someone goes out of their way to message me on PS4 over a game more than like 3 times over the course of my killer game, I feel powerful.
---
I dont understand that linked comment at all
---
I love it to death. Have the chick or the hotel guy that got chopped up. Can his power be throwing a type writer lol
---
I never said I considered your actual statement toxic, but you being arrogant about it definitely is a tell tale sign.
---
I applaud nurse mains. Im awful with her.
---
Good point but still you can go through pallets faster if you chase them longer maybe causing them to drop more pallets down.
---
Thats on purpose actually survivors are supposed to be able to hide from bbq behind gens
---
Even with that, i don't think you all 4 can get lightbringer.
---
You cared enough to reply bud.
---
&gt; Please, help us.
---
With what exactly? It looks like both sides are extremely competitive and play to win.
---
That being said, i don't think basement campers are rampant at red ranks lol
---
Play of the game: *Everyone dies*
---
Lol good point
---
He actually has them higher than Spirit. Actually, Hag and Myers are higher, Huntress and Spirit have the same score.
---
This game is no worse than others PvP games.  It’s not your typical 6v6 or BR game and there is no in game chat or post game chat on my platform...so it’s not surprising people DM more often. That being said I play a friendly killer and get positive messages most nights (Xbox).
---
Hmmmm....pretty sure you wouldnt depip tho...would need to Test it
---
Doesn't go down in a chase also they made a change to all mend or go into dying state abilities/perks that the killer can no longer see the progress. Was done as part of the legion rework.
---
Every 3 or 4 patches Ps4 gets left behind just like with Bill right now. We will get it later a few weeks after Xbox. Ps4 certifications are slow for Dead by Daylight and I was anticipating it since I have wanted to play Bill for 2 years.
---
IKR T-T
---
Yep
---
What usually happens: "well boys we did it, Haunted grounds is no more"
---
Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
---
After playing some killer matches sometimes when I switch to survivor I run up to used pallets to kick them for the sweet destruction points only to realize I can't.
---
Lmao this whole comment section turned into OP defending low q.
---
And I had that happen once too, a surviver was running out but couldnt actually escape. Felt bad for her.
---
Ruin in it's current state is fine and frankly required on most killers. I however see the perk reworked completly and have gen times increased in general on weak killers.
---
Survivor Rule #5872:  Survivors don't have to do bones, but can still complain about NOED.
---
Well, we already have a killer that operates out of dreams. Canker Man wasn't ever human, it's a manifestation of the little boy's nightmares, that only appears in the real world while the boy is sleeping. I don't know if it would fit.
---
He could *maybe* have an ability to put a survivor to sleep, and that would allow him to start attacking survivors. But I think that would feel too much like old Freddy.
---
Of course, I saved a million bp for this just to be let down at the last minute
---
I Don’t own DBD and I just fredskongresser live this game. So the closest game to it was Dead by Roblox. You can guess what I was playing on. So I had playing on this remake for some days but one match... I was just doing gens and suddenly I got banned for “Abusing and Exploiting”. I really don’t care because now I know how to play DBD on Mac! HERE I COME
---
today!!!!
---
This is the embodiment of a salty reddit killermain right here. Camps and tunnels even though he claims he doesn't bonuspoints for being too stupid not to blatantly admit he camps and tunnels in his post. 
---
If you get triggered by teabagging you probably wanna stop going outside for the rest of your life btw.
---
Well, there's also a "very rarely do I resort to facecamping, only when the gate is open or that person annoyed me that much" part. And it looks like it doesn't take much to annoy you.
---
Haunted ground should be changed to purple aura and Ruin should be green aura
---
Maybe *cries in seppuku*
---
N O I C E
---
We hide from it in lockers also so that wouldn't help much.
---
Uh huh. So how is it that nobody gets free saves against you if you are spending so much time away from the hook? Doesn’t add up. Clearly it sounds like you guard (patrol) hooks, you can camp without it involving you standing in front of the survivor the whole time.
---
I believe the point of not including addons and perks is to judge each killer based on their base power alone because otherwise addons like iridescent head, pinky finger, etc. would make some killers more highly ranked than others unfairly. It's an attempt to have the least bias possible.
---
There’s some builds with wraith that are really powerful like sneaky wraith, quick wraith, and all seeing wraith.
---
I have over 1500 hours and managed to do a flashlight save only once.
---
this is where i breakout the myers mori build
---
Just wait for higher ranks, you’ll getter better teammates eventually.
---
&gt; solution to ruin overuse is adding strong killer perks that help with pressuring survivors which counters gen rushing just like ruin
---
And an example of such perk would be...? It's obvious why people use ruin.
---
Or he'll be right behind you and you won't know until it's too late
---
That is iCarly
---
&gt; Ruin in it's current state is fine and frankly required on most killers.
---
That sentence makes little sense. Clearly if its REQUIRED for most killers, its not balanced.
---
&gt; I however see the perk reworked completly and have gen times increased in general on weak killers.
---
I like this idea. Maybe have gen time be based on the killer. Trapper? 100 sec gens. Nurse? 70 sec gens.
---
i just realized kate might have been a better fit then meg
---
fuck
---
&gt;Bodyblocking: it doesn’t make any sense that I can’t walk past someone to get to someone else. This is toxic.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Abusing game mechanics: Survivors in dying state who wiggle around windows to make it harder to pick them up.  
---
&gt;They’ll crawl under hooks(with another survivor on it?). I literally couldn’t pick them up until the survivor on the hook was sacrificed.  
---
&gt;Body blocking at hooks. Why can’t I hook someone when there’s a 80 pounds crouching piece of shit blocking 1 meter from the hook?  
---
&gt;Faking hook rescues to take a hit so the killer cant grab you off, then he has to “reload” his weapon for about 10 minutes, because balance.  
---
&gt;If you and a survivor are at an open hatch, the survivor already won, unless they’re exposed. How is this balanced?
---
Many of these things are things that can be dealt with and are not toxic, they seem so to you because you dont know how to deal with them. There ARE toxic stuff to do in this game, but none of the ones you mentioned are really on that list.
---
Bodyblocking is a mechanic that benefits both survivors and killers, survivors likely bodyblock to take a hit from another survivor, most commonly when the gates are open and want to help them escape, you can either try to slide and try to pass them over (specially with killers with speed powers like billy, nurse or spirit) or just try to down the guy trying to body block, if you have NOED for example. Killers can also use this to their advantage, like blocking the basement stairs to get a bunch of hits on the survivors on their way up the stairs or when a survivor decided to try and hide in an enclosed space, you block their way out and take your time to hit them, or even down them if you have a one-hit-down skill.
---
If survivors get close to a window to make it harder for you to pick them up (and make you instead go through a window) all you have to do is potition yourself parallel to the window, looking at one side (left or right) and wait until you see the "pick up" option. You shouldn't have any problem anymore with this, this also applies to people positioning themselves near the hook or in  an awkward obstacle in the map, the killers as quite a good range to pick people up so there is no position where it should be impossible for you to pick them up unless they managed to glitch into an unaccesible area.
---
Any time you get to a hook and seem unable to press the action to hook its 100% because a survivor is crawling around to not allow you to, pay attention and immediatly turn around and look below you (they usually crawl) and hit them, if they remain, down them even if it may make you lose your current prey, you will have a fresh one to hook anyway. Its pretty rare for survivors to do this, but it usually ends with them receiving an extra hit without giving enough time to the other survivor to wiggle out from you.
---
Faking hook rescues. Not that big an issue, if you suspect someone is going to try and fake you out (and this means you have to guess) you have 2 options, play along, hit the rescuer once, then they unhook then you should be able to land another hit and down the rescuer, great, someone got unhooked but you now have a fresh body to hook (unless they had meddle of man or decisive). Your other option is to bait it and not hit the rescuer, instead get unconfortable close to them and wait, you got no hurry, you have one survivor hooked and one wasting time infront of it, its their time they are wasting and if the other person is about to die on hook or hit second phase that will put pressure on the recuer, who might make the mistake to rush for it, giving you the chance to pull them from the unhook if they fail to predict you.
---
The hatch favors whomever finds it first, if the survivor gets to it before you, its theirs and will escape unless they allow you to get close enough to gloat allowing you to close it on their faces (won't likely happen). If the killer finds the hatch first he can close it and play gate keeper, which often means a certain 4th kill if the gats are close together and I must say, the killer has an advantage here because is more likely for him to have seen the hatch before the last survivor because they can move freely be sure to know when the hatch should have already spawned to keep an eye on the floor and memorize where it is if you see it, so you can run back to it once you sacrifice the 3rd survivor. If both survivor and killer are at the hatch just before it opens, the killer wins because he can close it before the survivor can use it.
---
&gt;"solution to ruin overuse is adding strong killer perks"
---
If they add something better, then will be another overused perk but played along with ruin. I think ruin is fine, it's a gamble and that can be frustrating but most perks are a gamble in some way
---
map and key addons are the biggest dick-punch when they show up in the webs.
---
I wish we had more offerings that affect the map in some way.
---
Ruins is clearly OP but its also kinda necessary. If you don't run ruins vs a competent SWF teams even if you end all chases super fast they will still do all gens at light speed.
---
The real fix would be to remove ruins but increase gens repair times, especially based on the killer (so increase the time more for trapper than for nurse)
---
LOL, the worst one to tbag at
---
Yo this is sick make more
---
Borrowed Time, Unbreakable, and Left Behind.
---
"wah gens take longer"
---
Then bring in your fucking 4 stacked purple toolboxes and stop crying
---
Spirit has a higher ceiling sure. But ease of use matters, and Billy has a crazy powerful kit with 0 downsides. 
---
The whole Billy v Spirit argument is pointless. It doesnt matter who is #2 and who is #3. They are both weaker then nurse, and clearly a tier above the rest of the cast.
---
Oh no i don’t think i have unbreakable or Borrowed Time. That’s gonna be hard to get now.
---
Padded jaws finally viable
---
Mods, please make this comment a sticky on top of this subreddit
---
😂 a little killer payback never hurts
---
I use to use the same build, but with bond in the place of self care. Now I also change urban evasion with iron will so I can spent a large amount of time hurt, and don't have to walk the map for someone to cure me.
---
I did the same thing man, we just got screwed
---
I've fallen victim to it one too many tines..
---
At higher levels it greatly depends on the killer you are using. Some are much better at stopping loops and infinites. Killers like the nurse and hag are way better at that kind of thing than say leatherface.
---
^pebble ^time
---
I think it's less stressful to just watch some Korean streamers.
---
Badham is 5 maps now. I find it hard to believe that all 5 will be bad survivor maps
---
I don’t think Ruin is OP or unbalanced, it’s just annoying. It’s annoying to face and it’s annoying to have to run it every game. The problem is that if you don’t run it, it’s much harder to apply early game pressure, and even if you do run it there’s a chance it either gets found early or that the survivors hit great skill checks and negate it. And then as survivor, if Ruin is active and you’re not in a SWF your entire team will run around like idiots searching for it which almost guarantees that you’ll lose. 
---
Like most of the annoying stuff in this game, it’s a band aid on a much deeper problem. Neither side likes it but there isn’t really a viable alternative at the moment.
---
They can dc in half a second why would you stand there for 20 mins to die lol. This is just dumb.
---
Oh hey man.
---
Please do the Nurse if you have the time. All eight of us who main her would love it. :)
---
Ruin..is OP? Lol
---
I guess, maybe it should be some sort of aura thingy, not a color but like an effect. We are starting to have too many conflicting aura colors.
---
Yeah I literally had surveillance on him ready for the update because I assumed it would be super strong
---
chest protector... so much fun, ppl still going to the basement after the gates are powered
---
dood i have some news about survivor perks for ya then if this is the stance you wanna take dood
---
To me it sounds as if it’s not the DbD community that is toxic, but actually the CONSOLE DbD community that is toxic.
---
ollo
---
You cannot block the stairs anymore
---
If it was at the start of the match Defoe 30-60 seconds it would be good in pair with preventing ruin cleanse immediately
---
Dude, where's the pie?
---
Okay, I get that, but what's the joke?
---
Ruin is OP apparently. Not really though.
---
No I’ve met quite a few players who only play killer or only play survivor. Plenty of people on reddit seem to only play killer 20%of the time.  I mean people who generally often play both sides.
---
Dude. Ruin is a hex perk that is destroyed in less than 60 seconds just about every game. How is it not balanced? 
---
It's used because it gives survivors another objective before they can power through gens. This game is all about time efficiency, and it gives the killer more time. 
---
Regardless, it's a hex perk that's taken out of the game quickly and leaves the killer with 3 perks. It doesn't need buffing, it doesn't need nerfing. It is balanced. 
---
As I said, the speed of the games themselves is the problem, not the perk.
---
Around 45 minutes from now
---
Nah, if i escape but you play like a toxic prick im still gonna  let you know it.
---
And you replied again
---
I said "stereotyped joke" because it's not fun, but is still a "joke". Dark humour should not offend people
---
Gotta love people that use we'll make it. Sometimes I run it with botany knowledge. The only problem is people running from you after being rescued from the hook.
---
Just a lil bit
---
What time it coming out?

A) You may not be offended by it. Others seem not to want it around, anyway. It may have something to do with the fact that some may be offended by it, and others don't want them shamed for being hurt by something that pigeonholes by 1) a difference as meaningless as race or country of origin and 2) is a difference that has no bearing on the thing we came here to share enjoyment in. We just want to bond over our love for a game we enjoy.
---
B) You might consider it worth it, if you are not offended by slights against your race, to consider what the difference has meant to people of other races. The unfortunate truth is that not all discriminations are or have been equal.
---
Yeah, I thought that was obvious. I figured there was something worse hidden in the message
---
&gt; What a ridiculous standard and you don't seem to also apply this to survivor perks
---
I personally think there isn't a survivor perk which is as mandatory as Ruins is for Killers.
---
I had a P3 Billy on Grim Pantry once who raged at me in the post-game chat for "not dying fast enough" because I was able to dodge a lot of his saws.
---
If you HAVE to have a perk in order to have any chance to win, it's not "fine".
---
Am i the only killer that doesnt get constantly berated by toxic chat after games? It amazes me i can play killer successfully without resorting to shitty tactics and tier whoring. 
---
Like yeah once in awhile you get the toxic bully squads, but most games its just gg and move on. 
---
For real, i think a lot of killer players need a little more self awareness.
---
I had this idea for a hex perk that removes disables 1/2/4 perks on all survivors until broken. Its pretty random but devs have come up with some random stuff
---
How dare you not stand still for him! So rude
---
Don’t take the downvote personally, Reddit can’t handle jokes and throw mini tantrums in the form of downvoted
---
Going all in on being awful, I see
---
You should try PMs it's great for circlejerking with other angry killermins.
---
What's even the joke or sarcasm? There's two words in the post besides "ching chong". It doesn't add anything to the comment it's replying to besides the slur.
---
People are wild.
---
Wanna hear something sad?
---
I started trying my Pig adept yesterday and would have gotten it on my first try but I had left a Dwight downed while I went to find the other Dwight that I downed and the other Dwight crawled into the depths of hell so I couldn't find him so he bled out and I got gold on devotion instead of iri ugh
---
Oh, so that's how killer's chasing music called that makes them miss survivor noises!
---
Im not killer main at all actually.
---
The best way to gain and spend bp is that way too IMO, have a "main" character and unlock every perk on him, then use that character to gain bp for other characters, use the other characters only once you have gained enough perks with them so they are decent to use. Once you unlock more teachables, run back to your main to unlock every new perk in that character.
---
So now you have a main character  with all perks which you use when you want to try hard and win most rounds or experiment different perk combos with and keep using the extra bp to level other characters (killers or survivors) that have fun builds to use or offerings and items that you want to try out later.
---
I agree, as long as it's funny. That wasn't. So it was just racist.
---
You must be a privileged white man that never has been offended by a racial slur.
---
I just played it yesterday and I was wondering why isn't deafness in the list of status effects, is it just because hag is the only one that can cause it?
---
My survivor rank is higher than my killer rank and I play it more but okaayyy :)
---
I'm on ps4, but I've actually made tons of friends through dbd. I find that there is a lot of toxicity, but no one can ever look past it to see the non toxic players. Theres a lot more than you think
---
thats the joke. on the right side. it says “Exposed: Hex Haunted Grounds”
---
The Plag*
---
The shame my friend. I need to work on those. I rarely do killer adepts.
---
Wish I was there to witness such cuteness
---
That makes it OP?
---
Yeah because everytime I leave the house I see people directly teabagging at me. Ur pretty much the type of person I’m talking about. And I’m 100% sure you wouldn’t call someone “too stupid” to their face, ur just another typical waste of life gamer.
---
Yep, was playing freddy the other day, this is pre-rework. Had low first level perks and still was able to get the 4K and with a little stalling got max blood points in almost every category. Received a message 5 seconds after the match that said i was a “trash kid low life who thought he was good because I picked an op killer”..... I was speechless
---
You're right, but that is not the fault of the perk. It is the fault of the area where the perk helps gameplay, in this case: gens get done too quickly.
---
You may have played some hours, but you are a baby until this shit rolls off your back. Sorry, not sorry. 
---
I know some players with 3k hours that still take it to heart that someone pulls out the survivors rule book and calls them a name. They might even cry on reddit about it! 
---
I used to feel bad when the survivors kicked my ass and then taunted me. Now, if they win, i know it's not that far off from them losing, and I can just gg and accept that I made mistakes. If they taunt, or message me, it's more funny. I still get games where I get 1 hook and they are all leaving with BT on that 1 guy so I have no chance of a 2nd hook, I know how fast gens can go with adept survivors. All in red ranks. That's just how good players are, they are Fucking amazing, and you need to be just as good. 
---
At this point, I don't even play strong build to win, but for the meme, and I don't try too hard, because if I do I will not be playing my best game. 
---
Tl;dr: In time, with enough practice, this kind of post will never be posted under your name, because you will have ascended to a higher understanding, silencing the trolls and toxic hoes. Then you can get back to having fun!
---
Survs give u time (tea bagging and flashlight clicking) for u to get closer to them and hit them and u still crying?
---
BTW. Why only killers crying about "tOXic" survs meanwhile every game u can spot toxic killer who:
---
Tunnel
---
Facecamp
---
Head shaking after down surv 
---
Spamming mori animation 
---
Bringing downed surv to hatch and then close the hatch(and head shaking)
---
And meme one here PLAYING NOED
---
But remember survs are only one who are "tOXic" 
---
PS. Really trying to survive (looping) is "tOXic"? 
---
Then hooking survs are "tOXic" too XD
---
Camping and tunneling used wisely are devastating, asian servers are known to play the best techniques in order to win. If camping and tunneling wasn't one of the best way to win, they wouldn't do it trust me.
---
I don’t know honestly because I just started playing but PC players have been kind to me. Even if they weren’t, who cares, it’s a video game. The internet is a hub for trolls and toxic people. There’s “toxicity” in every video game community.
---
Are you sure he was taunting you? A bit of a stretch to call that a mori spam.
---
Is visual brightness actually nothing? I could've sworn that was time to blind. But I never use flashlights so I could be wrong.
---
If it is the case I agree that there should be an add-on rework for many items, not just the flashlight.
---
He acts like its facecamping though. If its facecamping, no ones doing shit. Especially since he acts like no one plays stealth killers
---
This man is a mythical, he is truly one to be feared
---
yeah, i don't have too many left and most of them are killer adepts. I had to sweat my fucking ass off and I am not like a competitive player anymore and for nothing lol
---
The only reason this has more is the big community with 2 very seperate sides. Like you said though, every game is toxic
---
To be fair I'm really bad.
---
Ruin is silly.
---
Pop goes the weasel is better.
---
A lot of people are saying immediately do gens, I wanna provide a bit of a counterpoint: usually at the very beginning of the game, I like to move around, get a lay of the map while also doing other "objectives" (totems, chests) for 30 seconds or so. I do this for a couple reasons:
---
First, as the game starts the first thing the killer is going to do 95% of the time is either patrol gens or go to their hex totem. If they go to the gen you're on immediately, you're going to be in chase right off the bat. 
---
Second, while the killer is doing this if you're not in the "expected" spots on the map you can track the killer's movements by seeing him before they see you. Then you can work on a gen away from his movement.
---
Third, if you find him first you may see where his hex totem is, if he goes there immediately. 
---
Finally, a lot of the time most survivors spawn near each other, so by moving away from that starting area you can help spread out completed gens so you don't end up "gen screwing" yourself later on. Doing all the gens on one side of the map essentially cuts down the area the killer has to cover later in the game, making it much harder on survivors
---
Just my 2 cents
---
It's a content creator/streamer support program by the devs. Chosen streamers get codes and auric cells for each chapter, so they can show off skins, give away some codes for the community etc. It's marketing mostly tbh. Even though it doesn't mean that those streamers don't citisize the game or don't share their opinions. They do it quite often.   
---
But it's mostly part of community managment to keep interest in the game.
---
It is a little annoying that it seems like such a requirement and there aren't really any other perks that slow gen repairs to the degree Ruin does. It also speaks to the disparity between perks in this game. There are ~8 perks that most killers run (off the top of my head: BBQ, Ruin, M+A, Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Surveillance, Spirit Fury, Enduring, NOED) and there are a bunch more that are never used because they're worthless or extremely situational (Spies from the Shadows,  Monstrous Shrine, Territorial Imperative, Hangman's Trick, Coulrophobia, Iron Maiden, etc.). 
---
It would be nice to see more good perks added to the game to encourage people to change up their playstyles.
---
Really depends on what killer you're trying to make, whether you're on console or PC (hag is not free for PC for Hex: Ruin), and frankly, what you consider good. Obviously BBQ is dlc, but I managed to get into red with killer a few times never getting dlc with hag and spirit.
---
If you're talking about the most efficient perks, then yeah you'll need some dlc, but you can make do without and waiting on the shrine to get you what you want.
---
idk looks like a copy paste killer to me :/
---
Im still a little competitve but not as much as I once was. Especially being a survivor main, its easy to play and win.
---
To be fair atleast pigs will kill you if you ignore it.
---
Yeah people are sensitive. Imagine these same people in a war. They wouldn't last a second
---
You sure its not Object of Obsession? You have an Obsession but no Obsession perks and the other survivor you’re chasing isn’t it.
---
I think it's a language barrier issue. I remember another korean once who said pretty much the same thing when Legion came out. He said that everyone was playing him moonwalking, using everything that is considered jerk moves here. So they probably just proxy camp when they know survivors are around to waste the survivors time.
---
I saw 4 flashlights the other day and decided to bring in Franklin’s, my god you would have thought I camped and sacrificed them all. They all survived just lost their flashlights and it was like I was the walking incarnation of everything wrong with the game.
---
Not even war, just in real life they wouldn’t survive cause some people can’t handle a joke, it’s dark humor, it’s supposed to be offensive, if you can’t handle it then walk away, simple as that.
---
Oh no. Oh god oh fuck
---
I mean when somebody feeds me pallets all at the start I'm psyched. Now theres no safety net.
---
I spy an oink
---
Maybe. I guess I wouldn't know for sure unless I played on Korean servers.
---
Everyone on this sub is so fuckin salty that i dont agree we should ruin the whole game for everyone fbecause some crouched up and down. You guys needa growup
---
Spine chill is a good perk. It becomes a great perk against the stealth killers (except tier 1 Myers).
---
Don't worry people want DS nerfed into such a specific niche use that it may become completely useless in the future.
---
Workplace bosses give shit all the time yeah you won't make it if you're sensitive. Getting offended in the internet is the same thing as stepping in dog shit when you have the chance to avoid it
---
I loved the dream pallets from both perspectives of the game. As a survivor, I got the scares and as Freddy I got the laughs!
---
&gt; behavior is taking their sweet time to patch
---
It's because they have no fucking idea what causes it and despite what the comments here say it isn't that common at all so they don't have much to research from
---
Would actually be a cool mechanic if after the gate was open the map slowly broke and became smaller. forcing killer and survivor closer together.
---
Managed to get 4K today as trapper by the cockiest survivors ever, they kept trying to lure me away from my hook victim the moment I hooked them (aka I couldn’t even leave when I finished hooking the person or the others would instantly unhook them). The result? They fell for my early game traps over and over which were mainly around the basement. They kept fucking up due to sheer cockiness and whenever a trap was triggered, it would be put back up in the same spot. It worked splendidly. The best part was the 4K was in the basement, two of them left (they had to be in a party because they had the same initials at the end of their name)
---
TL:DR
---
Got a 4K in the basement today as trapper because of cocky survivors falling for the same traps near basement, two with the same last initials in their name disconnected upon everyone being hooked in basement.
---
My question is why would he even do that? He couldve literally downed you right then and there and put you on a hook. Definitely report him
---
It said thicc, not morbidly obese.
---
I’m rank 12. I’m at decent I’m assuming? Even then I get 17-20 rank partners
---
Oh really? i've been living under a rock clearly, are there patch notes knocking about about what's being removed?
---
Try using Spine Chill to counter stealth killers. It lights up whenever the killer is looking your direction from 36 meters away or closer. It will help your eyes too as when it lights up you'll know to look for the killer nearby, until you get good enough at seeing them to not need it. 
---
The only killer it doesn't work on is Tier 1 Michael Myers (before he stalks enough to level up one time)
---
Fog so thick it puts round holes in your body and controls it
---
I didn't know it was a thing until I was accused of exploiting it yesterday when I ran with a tiny bit of exhaustion left
---
She must have franklins, someone dropped their bolt or nut it’s hard to tell what it is.
---
Round about the same time elder scrolls vi comes out
---
Not long now
---
Alright, I've tested the accuracy thing myself on Badham preschool in a KYF lobby. It may look like it decreases accuracy with Plaid Flannel, but it literally does nothing. You land in the exact same spot every time on the max range blinks with zero deviation side to side, and front to back. It does nothing.  
---
As for the charge speed, let me give you some perspective. The range addon "Ataxic Respiration" gives a +20% range bonus, and because it just scales up the distance it also gives a virtual charge speed bonus of +20%. Let's compare that to the charge speed addon "Bad Man's Last Breath," which is the most powerful charge speed addon Nurse has, and is higher rarity. The Last Breath addon's "Tremendously increased charge speed" comes in at a whopping 14%, and that's at the cost of +10% fatigue duration, and -1 max blinks. For balance purposes they saw fit to remove a chain blink in exchange for far less charge speed, and you're telling me the range addons aren't a problem? Your were supposed to have to take one charge speed addon, and the other addon would get your the second blink back. Instead we have a mess where you can take two more powerful range addons, that also give charge speed, and have no down side. It completely breaks the balance of the character.
---
You can see the trap around his leg.
---
I’m confused D:
---
Yeah people are super sensitive, they shouldn't have taken away your internet points because you said a racial slur :'(
---
Which part of it confused you?
---
Noonish
---
The point is the speed at which gens is done is an EXTREMELY important part of the game. A perk that slows that down significantly is obviously very very powerfull. This explains why 80%+ of top killers run it.
---
Denying that Ruins is a good perk is pure hypocrisy
---
It's not a tantrum. Several people just saw a comment they do not find funny and individually downvoted it.  It's not some leftist conspiracy where they all gang up on non-PC posts.
---
Ruin is not OP at all, it's just a must have perk because of how fast the game goes. A lot of the time, Ruin isn't even that bad, you can go more than half a gen without getting a skill check. It's the fact that many players see Ruin and suddenly think you can't do gens with it up. 
---
For example, many Adept achievements such as Plague, Trapper, or Myers are extremely hard because all of their powers require you to get a head up early in the game, by vomiting, setting traps or stalking, while having absolutely nothing to help slow down gens to start the game. If killers can hardly be successful with their own perks, that's a problem with the games base design, not the perk being overpowered.
---
In reality, Ruin is often gone very early in the game or actually doesn't do much. Skill checks can either not pop up at all or players just hit the greats. It's a massive gamble to use, yet it feels like a must have for many killers because it's simply ridiculous how fast the game goes without it. The fact that many people will call getting just ONE hook before it breaks an accomplishment is sad. Is it a necessity, no, I've seen people do good without it, but having a great game without Ruin, without hardcore camping or NOED is pretty hard to do.
---
Again, this is a problem with the games design, and not necessarily the perk itself. No survivor wants gens to take even longer because looking at a bar load isn't fun, and killers have little help without crutch perks. As someone who plays both sides, the perk is fine. It has counter plays, really does help the killer, and can be removed from the game entirely.
---
Well, I WAS saying that I used my high level Pig to farm for my baby Myers, but now that you mention it I do also do that for survivors (complete character specific dailies and then funnel all points earned from them into Ace Visconti) and for low level killers I don’t like (complete daily challenges for killers I hte but am still comfortable playing and funnel those points into my actual mains)
---
It's not out yet, it will be released today
---
Yeah no but they might do other shit to you, like I can just imagine you flipping your shit in traffic and hurting someone really bad because you're such an autistic fuckhead that keeps giving in to his most childish raging moments, grow up bitch.
---
Today. Within the next few hours.
---
Whining helps
---
Newsflash: Purple toolbox are also OP. Doesn't make Ruins not OP.
---
Ok thank you!
---
Very helpful, thank you!
---
It wasn't a matter of people being unable to handle a joke. It was just both unfunny &amp; racist. That's why so many have downvoted.
---
It is an EXTREMELY important part of the game - and it's too fast. Slowing it down is necessary to be able to actually play the game. How do you have trouble understanding this basic concept? Oh yeah, cause you're biased and annoyed.
---
I’ll keep that in mind thank you!
---
It's not BBQ "on command" lmfao jesus christ
---
How long did that take?
---
Okay wtf. They literally ran towards you and the hook. It was their own fault
---
That hex is really goody
---
1 Brown + 1 yellow = 1 purple (max mist) which is probably what you're thinking
---
Oh 100% but green ranks always match with brown and very low ranks. I meant as far as teammates doing gens and saving you. As far as the killer finding you One of my favorite perks to run is spine chill, it’s really good for either putting distance between you and the killer as well as knowing if your getting stalked or snuck up on.
---
&gt; *is it possible to killer main without spending money on DLC's and waiting for the shrine?*
---
Yes, although "might take a while" is a bit of an understatement.
---
Defaults are Trapper, Wraith, Billy, and Nurse (DLC, but free DLC).
---
If we trim the list a little we get:
---
* Brutal Strength
---
* Agitation
---
* Shadowborn
---
* Enduring
---
* Tinkerer
---
* A Nurse's Calling
---
* Bitter Murmur
---
* Deerstalker
---
* Hex: No One Escapes Death
---
* Sloppy Butcher
---
* Spies from the Shadows
---
* Whispers
---
Nurse, Billy, and Wraith will all benefit from those tracking perks, and "Trapper's Basement" is in there too. So long as you're "aggressive" (i.e. you're always pressuring survivors) you should get at least a 2k each game.
---
&gt; *if I really need the DLC's which are the essentials?*
---
Hag, for Ruin - even when it's cleansed, it's bought you some time. Second choice would be Cannibal, because BBQ &amp; Chilli is a great source of BP. Third choice... maybe Spirit, Pig, or Clown (Hex: Haunted Grounds and Rancor from Spirit, Make Your Choice and possibly Surveillance from Pig, Bamboozle (which you already have) and Pop Goes the Weasel from Clown).
---
Doc's Monitor &amp; Abuse is pretty sweet on Myers, but it's just one perk - the others have at least two that might be of use on both Myers and other characters.
---
&gt; I don’t think Ruin is OP or unbalanced
---
Then you don't know what you are talking about. It slows down gen progression significantly, which is extremely important. 80%+ of red ranks Killers run it for a reason.
---
Then its funny because the rest of your post explains exactly why its such a strong perk....
---
It's not deafness that is happening to you. They are just reducing their terror radius to zero through a add on or perk. Like there is a perk that once a generator gets to 85 percent the killer's terror radius drops to zero for 6 seconds. Hope this helps
---
But I can see what pallets are around in the real world and keep track of it so when I go into the dream world, I can see what pallets suddenly spring up.
---
*Everything Is OP: A Novel Written In Comments*
---
The unnecessary use of Nobody meme
---
Or just buff the underused perks. its VERY easy to come up with simple buffs that won't make the under used perks OP.
---
hmmm, iam blind lol.
---
No one is saying Ruin isn't good. They're saying it's not OP
---
stop being so fucking dishonest
---
That's what makes you pissed in life? You must be a treasure...
---
And that stops it making sense to you because...?
---
What the hell are these shadowy people who have been briefly appearing in my games?
---
Do you have one for Spirit and Legion?
---
lmaoooo imagine thinking “ching chong” is dark humour
---
you really need to up your standards for jokes fr
---
11am EST!!!
---
It’s one thing to not find it funny and another to downvote it, you can downvote something that someone said which is really bad, but in this case it’s just a joke and some people love being offended and they downvote for no reason. It’s not like oc said some super racist or mean, a common joke that is said by 5 year olds
---
Lol nah I’m not like that but okay. 
---
&gt; because you're such an autistic fuckhead that keeps giving in to his most childish raging emotions, grow up bitch.
---
You ironically tell me to grow up but also call me an “autistic fuckhead” and resort to insults giving off the impression that you’re offended. 
---
Might wanna get your own childish raging emotions in check before you judge someone else, but I don’t expect much from an “internet tough guy” such as yourself. Have a nice day Janet.
---
This isn't a discussion about survivors perks. You are off topic.
---
The question is, is ruins one of the best killer perks, yes or no. I think it clearly is.
---
11 AM EST!!

https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1153675219724361730?s=09
---
You know the PS4 has a save video feature right...?
---
THere is an achievement for repairing a generator kicked by a killer, but other than that the survivor is just giving you extra points for kicking the generator, maybe trying to convince you to farm with them?
---
11 a.m. ET just announced on Twitter
---
my question is how can you possibly "main" everything? lol maybe it's semantics but it really makes no sense to me. doesn't "maining" something imply that you're playing said thing exclusively? 
---
like saying you "main" any and all of the given options (killer or survivor) seems to me to be actually the opposite of having a "main" at all.
---
What're you talking about? I never said Ruin is a bad perk. It's an amazing perk, which is why everyone runs it. I run it on everyone except Nurse and Billy. 
---
You're trying to tell me the perk itself isn't balanced when it is. What isn't balanced is the speed of games.
---
you use a definition that like 3 people in the world use so this is pointless
---
Why on mobile? And I agree on the buffing part
---
Of course i think ruins is the best Killer perk
---
You just explained exactly why its the strongest perk in the game, and then you try to argue its not OP? how does that make sense?
---
I'm trying to level Hag now for Ruin, god she just feels so bad to play
---
Obviously you’re gonna lose the toolbox in this situation whether you dc or wait till the entity kills you or whatever. Really not anything u can do about it bedsides come on reddit on complain but it seems like thats what this sub is for i guess.
---
Like how at the end they just throw in that plague got a new outfit. Sad it wasn't Ghostfaces but eh always next week
---
fuck it tell me something about yourself my guy we can get to know eachother
---
Oh hi David Bowie
---
No, we're getting them ASAP
---
The joys of rank reset.
---
*downvotes for Bing Bong*
---
Lots of salty messages incoming
---
No thanks
---
Well i'm sorry you are having a bad experience playing the game, are you playing on console? is there an option to not receive messages from unknowns?
---
Just crouch everywhere, EZ
---
Won't lie, was kind of hoping it was some kind of foreshadowing or teaser.
---
When I get home I’ll take a look I honestly didn’t think that was a thing on PS4 I know with Xbox I don’t think there’s a way to block messages, of course I could be wrong.
---
&gt; The Pig's Ambush Attack is no longer considered a basic attack.
---
Wait, did they nerf Amanda again?
---
&gt; I would like to know where you get this stat
---
Devs put out some stats a while back and there are about 6 perks for survivors and killers that everyone uses all the time
---
why not :( i’m sorry if i offended you
---
You're saying someone making a racist ""ching chong"" "joke" is dark humor? Ok. You keep saying that but I don't think you know what it means.
---
&gt; Ruin can be super strong, yes, until you face good survivors. Good survivors smash through ruin as though it wasn't there.
---
Situations where ruin is good:
---
*Survivors are not good at skill checks.
---
Even in the unlikely case every single survivor hit great skill checks 100% of the time, it still means every skill checks gets no progression instead of 2%, that's still pretty good.
---
the devs prob fucked something up but are fixing it im sure will get it in a few days
---
&gt; What're you talking about? I never said Ruin is a bad perk
---
This floofy dude is so dishonest. Everyone is like "what? ruin isn't OP" then he comes back all "oh so you're saying it's a bad perk??"
---
like fuck off. he's so annoying
---
Could you do a wallpaper of Spirit with her sword?
---
Lol the way you all are reacting makes it seem like it is haha
---
I'm pretty sure it just means that it isn't counted as well a basic attack meaning you don't get the points for getting a hit with it like a normal attack but I believe deviousness like Ghostface when he attacks out of stealth I could be completely wrong though.
---
That is the stuff of nightmares, holy shit!
---
Sucks for ps4 players
---
&gt;Adjusted the cooldown for successful Cannibal chainsaw attacks to be the same as that for a missed chainsaw attack (adjusted movement speed and reduced duration from 3 seconds to 2 seconds). 
---
LEATHERBOI BUFF
---
Lol dark humor and being a racist/making a racist joke are two different things haha
---
Yup
---
just another day in dbd. can defiantly relate!
---
Oh yes I forgot, only discrimination against Blacks, Asians or Minorities are actually discriminating, everything else is perfectly fine. \s
---
Don't fool yourself. If you're offended by something written on the internet or said to you in person you're just pathetic. Especially something like "ching chong", what the actual fuck man.
---
**Leader** is going to stack on top of itself every time you exit and then re-enter its range, allowing survivors to get ridiculous repair speeds by shimmying along its edge for a few seconds before working on a gen.
---
**Bamboozle** will no longer reset after vaulting a new window, and instead will be stuck on the first window you vaulted in the trial and will just keep blocking that window whenever you vault any window on the map.
---
**Windows of Opportunity** will reveal the killer’s outline whenever they pass by a window or pallet.
---
**Save the Best for Last** will now give you a stack for hitting the obsession so you functionally lose 1 less stack each time you hit them (because you gain 1 and lose 4/3/2 after each hit).
---
**Deliverance** will now cause you to unhook yourself in the dying state.
---
**Fire Up** will now increase entity progression speed for each completed gen (actually, now that I write that out, that doesn’t sound like such a bad idea...)
---
That's very rude, but I think you might be deflecting.
---
Omg I didnt even notice that until you pointed that out.  That means the other new ones are coming soon :)
---
Yeah but happens too often to not wonder why they don’t prepare or atleast fix the issue before it happens
---
I didn't even see that I glossed over the patch notes but this really tickles my fancy as I really like Leatherface but he is so weak hope it gives him a boost in the tierlist instead of being minor.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that allowed Killers to open the exit gate while carrying a Survivor. 
---
I had no idea that was a glitch this whole time.
---
&gt; Ruin is not OP at all, it's just a must have perk because of how fast the game goes.
---
That sentence does not make sense. If a perk is a must have because you stand no chance without it, that is literally the definition of OP.
---
The rest of your post essentially explains why its a must have... 
---
&gt; Again, this is a problem with the games design, and not necessarily the perk itself. No survivor wants gens to take even longer because looking at a bar load isn't fun, and killers have little help without crutch perks.
---
Well here i'd agree with you. The gens ARE too fast whitout Ruins. Personally i'd remove ruins, but increase gen repair time for the weaker/mid tier killers.
---
Downvoted for trying too hard.
---
This has to be clickbait..? Where is this screenshot from
---
For me the problem with Ruin is it's what I consider an anti-fun perk. It doesn't alter interactions between killers and survivor and just makes the game shittier for survivors.
---
That could be it. Although to me, it screams "Ambush attack no longer works with NOED, Rancor, Make Your Choice, etc."
---
Downvoted for not trying at all, dick
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused The Trappers camera to look down after picking up a bear trap. 
---
It's finally patched holy shit
---
So a perk that is an absolute must have because you are useless without it is not OP....? I'm not sure what your definition of OP is then lol
---
Monitor and Abuse reduces your terror radius when the Killer needs his terror radius as large as possible
---
Congratulations!
---
Small Game/Plunderer’s Instinct/Ace in the Hole/Pharmacy
---
I mean if you're not going to shock people to build madness/stop interactions then why even play Doc?
---
Same. It was nearly impossible not to abuse it though. You literally couldn't ignore it.
---
11 AM what timezone?
---
Ah, thank you. Raging that I didn't pick up some more of the DLC during the sale now, do you know if they go on sale often? Is there any of the DLCs in particular that you think are must buy? Leatherface looks really good for leveling up Killers.
---
Pretty sure nurse blinks are considered basic attacks (they used to give MoM a charge)
---
No Mither, Slippery Meat, Monstrous Shrine, Overwhelming Presence
---
Entity: Aha hah
---
Lol ikr
---
My point is it impedes Doc’s passive ability to build madness by lowering the AoE. Can we just agree to disagree because i dont wanna argue this
---
This. Safe pallets actually forced killers to brake the pallets. Unsafe pallets will encourage even more bloodlusters. I don't mind getting downed if the killer outplayed me. But feeling cheated while bad killers get downs handed to them is not fun.
---
Wtf you let them escape? Survivors enjoy being killed. It's why they shout aah when you do it, they're happy.
---
Do...do we have any rules for survivors?
---
When is that?
---
so your title rewritten in apex terms would read:
---
"any bloodhound, lifeline, gibraltrar, pathfinder, octane, wraith, bangalore, caustic, mirage, and wattson mains ever do this?"
---
or: 
---
"any person who plays any character in the game ever do this?"
---
yknow what i'm saying? just seems weird to me that people who play everything would be described as "maining" anything.
---
My go to is the same as OPs, but instead of Bond I run BT when SWF, Self-care when solo.
---
I also want to switch Balanced landing for Lithe, I just... don't have Lithe yet.
---
Nice! Gratz
---
But wraith is sitting on it
---
I mean, you’re not wrong.
---
Thank you^^ it was super hard
---
His power would be to just fucking break window vaults, they get repaired at the same rate hooks do.
---
I'm so sorry you have to hit the little '+' to view your ignorant and unfunny jokes.  Most of us are adults who don't want to see a "common joke that is said by five year olds."
---
You'll still get Bill shortly after, he just won't be in this update. We're aiming to have him out as soon as possible (probably in a hotfix).
---
EST
---
Here's Johnny! should be one of his perks/achievements.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
If you're frequently chasing, it doesn't
---
But sure agree to disagree
---
That will be an incredible pile of BS, even as a player who doesn't run NOED.
---
That’s what you get for being toxic 👍🏻
---
Hag severed ear addon makes a survivor deaf for 5 seconds when they set off a trap.
---
&gt; I'm not saying that they can't be mindgamed
---
&gt; higher skilled players will not get mindgamed by these pallets
---
You just contradicted yourself. Which one is it?
---

&gt;"gg carried this team"
---
&gt;???
---
Seems like this is a semantics issue here. If a perk is much stronger than every other perks, that's the definition of overpowered imo.
---
We''ll see. If that's the case I don't see why ambush attack had to be changed like this but nurse, spirit, hag didn't.
---
As a Feng main, this is too true. I have all of her cosmetics (except golden Feng on console, rip) and it is honestly torture watching other characters constantly get cosmetics instead of her.
---
decisive strike, sole survivor, and mettle of man also cause you to spawn as obsession
---
Right now! At least on Steam.
---
https://youtu.be/YSDTPPM9qsc
---
Low skill players will be mind gamed. High skilled players won't. It's inherently based on player-to-player interactions and at the highest skill level it will be worse overall.
---
Its not
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems
---
Oh, you like the pig. I played the pig until i bought the clown and know i have the clown as my main killer.
---
Sounds like your luck problem might actually be a skill problem...
---
Of course they did
---
Wait what? You tunneled someone (because otherwise they couldn't use D-strike) and are upset that they then used D-strike? I'm confused.
---
Like sure you could have moried them, but what behavior do you think would be reasonable from them?
---
U R M O M E X T R A T H I C C
---
You know why I don't use lithe? It is "useless" when you want to loop in double windows, because if you want to make the killer lose time in those, then you will need to waste your lithe
---
God damn I received a lot of hate for just stating why people gave legion shit. I never said I agreed, I just said I understand why people hate legion. I specifically mentioned why people give Legion shit, slows the the game down, reveals location of others &amp; keeps up in chases. I've never been on any side but damn this sub does feel like its compromised of a lot of salty killer mains.
---
also "Reduced the minimum distance between pallets to 8 meters"
---
I swear to fucking god if we get a situation where, like, Ironworks ends up being a sea of useless pallets and the Free Escape Window is still there I'm gonna fuggin grr
---
Ass indeed.
---
Atleast you learned a lesson about hiding in a terrible spot with only one exit
---
You're getting rightfully downvoted, but it might be better if you understood why telling someone to kill themselves is not acceptable behaviour, and why no one should have to hear/read that.
---
In what kind of world is encouraging suicide something that you just ignore, or as you put it, "get over"? Even if someone is in a healthy mental state, having someone tell you to kill yourself can be troubling. It's much worse if you're depressed or if you've had suicidal thoughts before. Maybe you're fortunate enough not to have been depressed or suicidal at one point, but you have to recognize that other people are dealing with shit every day of their lives. Video games might be their escape from their troubles, so when someone says something like the message OP received, it can ruin more than just the experience of gaming.
---
Just to be absolutely clear, it's never a "get over it" situation when someone encourages bodily harm on anyone else. It's important that we try to do what's best for people - ignoring the stuff that promotes hurtful behaviour can also be part of the problem.
---
You're telling me that they didnt ? Cuz my question was genuine. If they really didn't then bhvr shows us how great they are once again *Cries in very rare hemmorhage*
---
It’s ok we’ve been blessed with a Feng cosmetics winning the art contest so we know we have at least one on the way
---
Reminds of this game from few days ago versus Insidious Le... wait for it... Legion.
---
Wait until the new survivor😬😂
---
I come to notice that I only get comments about my supposed "lag" whenever a Survivor running a bunch of crutch perks dies in a really stupid way. I will admit that I don't have the best connection quality but when a Survivor running Urban Evasion, We're Gonna Live Forever, Spine Chill, and Iron Will manages to loop me for 5 minutes before I kill them they just say GG. But when I kill the Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Self Care Survivor because they ran in a straight line away from all the pallets I immediately get "nOoB lAgGeR nIcE sWiTcH eNjOy ThE bAn FoR cHeAtInG!"
---
It's a bug fix for Bubba where he would have a longer cooldown for successful chainsaw hits when normally he was supposed have the same cooldown as missing. I'd expect the chainsaw itself to be the same other than this small bit.
---
Hm... I haven't thought of that. BL has a nice stun reduction regardless if you are exhausted, and it's a life saver on some maps, but often times there is no place nearby to trigger BL, sometimes it doesn't even exist on entire map (like Shelter woods), that's why I've been thinking of Lithe, because all maps have windows.
---
Yeah, maybe I'll stick to BL and don't wait for Lithe on shrine, and I'm probably too used to fall stun reduction by this point.
---
I've seen people say they won because they denied me a BBQ stack.
---
Dedicated servers can't come fast enough along with the "husks" you can sacrifice to solve that little problem
---
&gt;I would consider a perk “OP” or overused if a large majority of players ran it because its just too good to not run. Think of pre nerf DS and MoM.
---
you mean like.... every exhaustion perk? adrenaline? ok
---
this is some tunnel-visioned thinking here
---
Only took 2 months. Let's see if it really works
---
Reduced minimum distance between pallets 
---
Just on freddy's map
---
the comment section put in its monocle and got SUPER mad at this meme
---
What I mean by shittier is that it actually makes the core survivor goal more annoying by making gens harder to do.   There's no doubt that it is very strong from a meta perspective if we're just taking about wins vs. losses.
---
oh okay, I didn't know that
---
Better grab a sandwich as well for the inevitable 2nd download you'll have to do to fix whatever breaks EAC after every patch.
---
I thought it was crusaderface before I read the title
---
So it was my last game of the night and I farmed with the survivors because why not, they brought party streamers. However this David was stuck after being unhooked, and the Entity couldn't even kill him. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Some people do it just to grief unfortunately. You see survivors do it to teammates sometimes too.
---
I mean, it’s not as the patch is getting delayed for us PS4 players lmao
---
you act like reducing the distance between pallets on ANY map was needed
---
kIlLeRs CaNt Be ToXiC! YoU PrObAbLy DeSeRvEd It!! /s
---
That's what I always hear lol
---
This happens with a lot of games on ps4...
---
I see what you’re saying, I really do, but how is getting upset over what some random stranger who could be across the world from you who has never met you or laid eyes upon you really hurt you. Now I’m not condoning it or anything because I think it’s a pretty ugly thing to say but i never pay no mind to a troll. I know everyone handles things differently I get that but at the end of the day just keep it moving don’t waste your time on some loser over the Internet saying dumb shit. Now if it was personal like it someone you knew said this or even multiple people on the internet constantly harassing you that’s completely different. I appreciate the fact you decided to explain your reasoning and like I said I get it, but assholes will be assholes.
---
Dude these look AMAZING, I love the war settings!
---
"Fixed an Issue where Feng Min's eyes were closed for interactions"
---
Lol wut
---
In my eyes as long as one person made it out the killer takes an L. DCing is just an L for the guy who DC’d.
---
When do we get the skins though?
---
okay bye
---
Lol! So just because I got you to understand my point, you going to downvote me?
---
Bhvr keeps diddling pig for sone reason.
---
Ranged NOED would be absolute bullshit lol
---
It doesnt appear so. They added a small buff to his block addon percentage and added a VFX for gen teleporting to help with identifying as Freddy.
---
Yeah, it really is. He hated me enough to click on my profile (shit takes forever to load), go into the message tab, click it, wait the long ass time it takes to load, type out his message and send it. Doesn't seem that complicated, but it's a waste of time.
---
Its just I was so hyped for it, since back in the day I played Left for Dead alot, and suddenly I read the tweet. I just got super upset man. But it looks like were still getting it.
---
PS4 experience
---
Good thing now everybody wants to try Freddy.... now the Killer waiting time has gone from ~2-10 min to 10-50years. Great... i just don't understand why this is still a thing. I WOULD play SO MUCH MORE KILLER (Or dbd in general) but this waiting time.... what do the devs think? I sit infront of my pc 24/7 and don't mind waiting XX minutes to find a game? Downvotes inc but i don't care.
---
Oh my god fucking finally.
---
This particular instance has been here for 2-3 weeks I believe.
---
because all claudettes are babies anyways *wink wink*
---
How big is the update on pc?
---
Plague's came out today I think?  Her banner was at the bottom of the patch notes today
---
My guess is that there will be one, very specific but abusable bug yet again
---
I haven’t been downvoting your comments. I left this alone because an argument about memes is fucking stupid. Clearly you sound pretentious to someone else who’s been downvoting you.
---
Oh man that would be awesome if PTB Freddy is Live Freddy!
---
I have 3400 hours in Dbd :)
---
Why the doctor?
---
I know for a fact I've seen a clip of Zubat doing it before this patch
---
We already got plagues so I'm going to take a educated guess and say Ghostfaces is next because they are the only outfits not paired with anything else or Kate and Jeff's to give the survivors some outfits so they don't just spam the killer outfits while survivors don't get anything during that time.
---
Yeah, her's is in the store right now.
---
Actually it was jump rope adfon from 8-9%
---
Is this on mobile?
---
Lol whenever someone is toxic in post game I just put a ? Until they leave. ? Really makes people more frustrated for some reason :)

Noooo, don't you remember what they said? They only make "Logical changes"

Wow they actually did not fix the dead hard bug that was on ptb. Just had it happen to me in a game and died because of it.
---
Insta-blinds? After re-work DS? What year are you in?
---
Don’t ask me hhee
---
At higher ranks people tend to understand you more, especially if you're playing ace. Just t-bag at the chest and point and they may let you open it.
---
Probably. Just salty cause it took less than a week for wake up to get fixed and this was an actual game breaking bug effecting everyone every match.
---
I mean to me... It does, what else am I suppose to site besides actual evidence...such as a video, and what are the chances it's the first game out of like 3 that just so happened to be a medkit build where again he got completely fucked. You can be smug about citing a video,  but don't do it while you use a fucking anecdote where you say not in hours or minutes, but just "a lot" how much you've wasted your life on dbd. (Also seeing as how everyone and their mother has gotten it, it's a lot more common than most of their other bugs they fix)
---
Oh and I play this game very rarely anymore, I'd say maybe 5 hours a week now because of my internet, but I've managed to see my entire squad get it, and myself 3 different times all within the span of like 2 weeks.
---
I like the new anti-toxicity.
---
Yes oh my god.
---
Priestess of the Damned
---
#PEBBLE TIME
---
Can someone please explain this change?
---
Added a generator teleport VFX indicator attached to the generators auras, and removed the white aura on generators The Nightmare could teleport to.
---
Does this mean Freddy now has a visual effect showing which gen he's teleporting too now? Also removing the white auras means Surveillance will now be usable?
---
About 1GB
---
Oh, it does that just fine on its own.
---
What’s happening with Freddy
---
This just doesn't make any sense
---
But they’ve removed like 99% of safe pallets from Badham and introduced more unsafe pallets instead, which will work in the Killers favour as they are easier to mind-game or bloodlust.
---
Yes, we should play sometime?
---
Yeah you're still getting it it's just delayed! Nothing to get to worked up over shit happens!
---
Good. Now lets see how long it takes for you to forget this lesson. -spongebob time jump voice- "the next round" ...... you didn't learn a fucking thing did you.
---
Add-ons suck on Fred compared to what add-ons did pre-buff Fred.
---
I buy shit perks so just they would stop appearing
---
&gt; You literally just said you play this game "a looooot". I never said this is all you do, but doing anything "a loooot" is wasting "a looot" of your life.
---
I also work a lot. And I slackline and play pool a lot. And I read a lot. 
---
So uh sorry I guess. 
---
I don't play any other video games, so yeah I play dbd a lot since it's the only thing that takes up my allotted vidya time
---
at such unsafe pallets the killer would have to be an absolute bot to even get to bloodlust at these pallets
---
Spotted the offended chink
---
Never will I understand why the Devs thought the Ghost was a gray addon
---
People just mad that they have to dc.. Even though in this senario, they aren't getting out alive anyway. 2 DC's (with no mither, lol) and another dead, so might as well just fuck around or quit.
---
Why not 3gen tho? I don't remember having less than 3K with that strat as Doc
---
What they've done is make a system that they say will effectively gauge the strength of a loop. They didn't provide examples of this system in action. Considering the fact that the game as a whole has the technical quality of a rooster bleeding mashed potatoes all over an internet router, I trust you'll forgive me if I don't assume that this system will work in the slightest.
---
Once again, sounds like it's a you problem. Do you know about the scratch marks and everything?
---
Happened to me a yamaoka estate through a window vault as well.
---
I'm not afraid to use the word overpowered, I'm not using it because it's not the right word. Its easily countered while having a trade off of POTENTIALLY slowing down the game. You are completely choosing to ignore the fact that it can be easily countered, which needs to be taken into consideration. It's a strong perk, it isn't op  
---
It's crutch.
---
Lol it's fine if I could I would
---
im in the same place. didnt buy halloween during the sale but did it afterwards cause myers is much fun. 
---
apart from the fact that you can unlock any (including DLC perks) from the shrine of secrets if they happen to pop up (can be found in the in-game store. 4 perks at a time will be for sale and the shrine is refreshed every 3 days I think, not sure)
---
Id suggest going for ruin and bbq. other than that it depends of what killer you play and how you like to play:
---
for killers id go for the ghostface and halloween(myers), and maybe spirit, pig and new freddy.
---
the best perks you'll get from: cannibal (bbq and franklins), hag (hex:ruin , devoir and third seal are all great perks), clown has bamboozle and pop goes the weasel., doctor has monitor and overcharge, ghostface has thrilling tremors, furtive is also decent. spirit gives spirit fury, rancor and haunted.  and maybe discordance from legion.
---
(if you like playing myers, bamboozle is in the shrine for 2k shards, its not the very best perk but its A tier)
---
im not sure how much the dlc's will be on sale but my guess is very mayor steam sale, or at least every time dbd is on sale the DLC's join in
---
Makes sense, loool!
---
Well, devs seem to have decided to just force killers into being bots
---
Why was she even teabagging in the first place, she wasted a pallet lol
---
Survivor: don’t stay near other survivors except for healing/being healed. Avoid other survivors like they are the killer because the biggest thing that ends matches is people grouping up giving the killer easy chances to slug.
---
Killer: watch this video and loop like him https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
Beyond that for killer if a chase lasts more than 2 pallets then drop the chase and go after someone else. 
---
Hope that helps! If you have anymore questions feel free to stop by my stream and ask at 6pm PST everynight :) https://www.twitch.tv/TricksterShadow

About the comment on F13, it used to be a toxic shit hole way worse than DbD is and honestly, I feel ever will be. First with the whole thing about a player getting banned for talking shit against a kid who was teaming with Jason because some girls in the game knew one of the devs and reported him, which caused a mob hunt on the dev, dev started banning people from the F13 subreddit for any critism against him, which got him and supposedly his family doxxed, then the person who was banned wasn't nearly as innocent, which too then got him doxxed. Team killing was rampant in F13 for the slightest reason. People didn't like the character you picked, prepare for a fight of your life, they want an item you have, fight for life, don't even like how you sound over the mic, fight for life and sometimes it was just done since the punishment wasn't really a punishment, you just don't get any EXP. Even now teamkilling is still possible, get in a car and run over teammates. I've noticed that people have made the comparison that killers aren't really killers in DbD, since you can debate whether the game is survivor or killer sided (not getting into that discussion) but for a while over on F13, Jason was a literal punching bag and would often have to run away from others. The way the stun system works with items and the way luck works for weapon durability, a little 3 squad of Chads with a monkey wrench could easily kite Jason and keep knocking him down for well over 7 minutes. God forbid you run into a legit full game of Chads. Jason at that time was literally the hunted instead of the hunter and would have to play a game of cat and mouse to try and kill people or would have to run away from groups, which ended in a bunch of DCs from the killer because that's really not fun. While I haven't played the game much since the devs abandoned the game and dipped with a last ditch cash grab, I've gone to the subreddit before and people there mention often about others teaming up with Jason to hunt and snitch out teammates, people abuse a glitch to get on roofs where it is impossible for Jason to kill you up there unless the player knows how to get up there themselves or has God tier aim with throwing knives and can hit them quick enough before someone can heal up -- if they don't, they either leave the match and will probably get shit talked for leaving or they have to stay for the full 20 minutes to be hit with "gg ez."
---
While there is toxicity in DbD, I honestly think F13 was miles ahead worse on launch date and even now I think it's still somewhat above DbD. Yes DbD has endgame chat and others going out of their way to message, there are things people can do that may upset others (tbagging, face camping, any other reason for anyone to be upset) but I find that kind of tame from F13 and I've played way more time on DbD (847 hours) than I have F13(240 hours.) I mean there's proximity voice chat that Jason can hear, the amount of shit talking that happens to a Jason player who misses or slugs/slashes to death instead of picking people up or even remotely seems "try hard" is off the scale. And like I had mentioned earlier, may some people have mercy on your soul if you even remotely sound weird to them. Most recent game I played back during the Steam Summer Sale, a person playing Jason with a very noticeable lisp was getting the shit pushed into him by 3 people and every time he spoke or messed something up, dude was hammered with it until he finally muted his mic, which still didn't fair him any better. That's not even touching the other stuff people throw out, racial slurs, mocking others, music/ear rape spam, screaming into their mic, telling where others are/what they're doing and other shit.
---
Nothing seems different from the change of PTB to live. Most of this was bug fixes so blessed be.
---
how
---
Seriously, this guy is sitting here arguing with me in another comment thread on here and just refusing to grasp a very basic concept
---
I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS TO HAPPEN TO
---
SOMEONE FOR THE LONGEST TIME
---
Thats the additude! Never stop doing something you love because people say they don't like the way you play the game. As long as the thing you're doing isn't causing any harm, there's no reason to stop.
---
&gt; I just don't see how mindgaming unsafe pallets bring more skill to the game.
---
they mean more skill for survivor, which it doesn't, because it doesn't matter how good you are anymore. You're getting hit. survivor nerfs have gone way too far. If they wanna do this then they need to revert a number of previous changes and introduce some killer nerfs
---
This just means that she can hear her hum.
---
&gt; There’s a difference between something being strong and something being OP. A perk can be strong and see high pick rate without being unbalanced.
---
The main difference is if its MANDATORY or not. As an example, Nurse's calling is a strong perk, but i absolutely can play without it. Ruins's power level on the other hand is so high you are putting yourself at a disadvantage if you don't run it.
---
&gt; If Sprint Burst was the only exhaustion perk in the game I bet the pick rate for it would be much, much higher. Wouldn’t make it OP though.
---
That's an interesting counter argument actually. Personally i'd say that yes, in your example Sprint Burst would become mandatory. It would clearly be way better than every other perks, and yes i'd say that would make it OP.
---
But one difference between ruins and your example is, Ruins actually have "competition". Many other perks are supposed to slow down gens. But none compares to ruins.
---
I am! I stream DBD on twitch at https://www.twitch.tv/TricksterShadow every night at 6 pm PST

I also have a YouTube where I put games up from the previous nights stream here :) https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCALjuTTpnikTJKj0MAWhPWw
---
Just to play off your comment, if you are adjacent to the shack as the survivor is being hooked you can potentially pull off a BT save before she has time to set up her web of traps. Alternatively try running to a generator and purposefully failing a skill check, sometimes you can goad the killer to abandoning the shack if they think they can get an easy down.
---
I literally just did this two games ago. I cleansed haunted grounds while my tm8 was in a chase. But on a good note they didnt get hit and I found hex just moments after.
---
well that's s\*\*t.
---
It wasnt an issue on PC

Felt bad about old man yelling at clouds, so returned to give him some company
---
What was the joke?
---
Exactly you already know you’re gonna have to quit so why would you wait 20 mins.
---
Ah the bragging rights.
---
TRAPPER GANG RISE UP
---
Well it looks like they said they had a new tool that determines the "safeness" level of a pallet. I think they're saying that they will have varying degrees of safe/unsafe pallets, which could be really interesting. 
---
There are some pallets on maps that are pretty balanced IMO, where a good survivor can still waste a good amount of the killer's time, while giving the killer a good chance to outplay them. As a killer main, I hope we're going to see more of those rather than the REALLY unsafe pallets that are one-sided, they're more fun.
---
Oh yea I most definitely agree something needs to be done about the grind. Currently it is way too much considering every chapter release adds about 1000 more possible levels to the game!
---
&gt;I also work a lot. And I slackline and play pool a lot. And I read a lot. 
---
Nice life story... What does this change lol.
---
&gt;I don't play any other video games, so yeah I play dbd a lot since it's the only thing that takes up my allotted vidya time
---
&gt;lmao u r so mad
---
Man you're so right, I'm so angry right now.
---
Wait until you face red ranks nurse. Now that's something to complain about.
---
Lol. I don't blame you.
---
I love wraith, but I wish he wasn't such an add-on dependent killer. Give him the buff juice
---
About 462 million BP ;)
---
Lmao you got literally nothing better to do with your time?
---
;D
---
But that would only increase the amount of totem guarding if they brought in multiples.
---
About 3000 hours of pure grinding
---
It’s getting pushed out later.
---
Look at the Q+A in this post :)
---
Binge watching Jessica Jones after working for 8 straight days... Wanna join?
---
because it's encouraging killers to never have to do anything other than bloodlust. bloodlust your ass around unsafe pallets and force them to a safe pallet to force them to throw it to take that out and now there's jack shit for the survivor to work with
---
Bruh I play killer and its so much easier to see people with the bug. You can see them from all the way across the map as long as they are near a generator. You can see them on it, near it, the direction they're going. Its so easy.
---
Who cares if he can hit you while awake? He longer has wall hacks and being asleep doesn’t slow your action speed as much.
---
Clearly Amanda was the most OP killer that badly needed a nerf. /s
---
It's a natural urge to assume the new killer will be OP, since we know so little about him and haven't really seen what he's capable of yet. Give it time, no one will really know how to play against the new Freddy until he's been out for a few weeks, then we'll be able to make better judgement.
---
Doc is good if played properly
---
I've played with certain builds and strats, don't get me wrong, and I don't have a lot of games where I'm not getting at least a couple kills. It's just that the Doctor in general doesn't really excel outside of tighter maps, from my experience. I've also noticed that people are more susceptible to sending me a hate message if I'm Doc rather than any other killer, don't know why.
---
This is fucking terrifying
---
That is actually scary as fuck
---
It all comes down to what IP BHVR gets to license.  Besides Jack Torrance, I'd also pay good money for Anton Chigurh, Lo Pan, the Leprechaun, Sweeney Todd...  oh and maybe Patrick Bateman.  They could model him closely after Dwight's body, to cause confusion.
---
You do contradict yourself dude.  You state point blank you play to defend the hooks and that you will go after the unhooked person again too.  That is tunneling with a splash of tunneling peppered in.  In comparison after I hook someone I leave to pressure gens and initiate my next chase with a hooked survivor asap.  Unless I know they're right there I leave to start downing a new survivor rather than focus on defending my previous hook.  Very little salt gets tossed at you playing this way and I get more bps and better pip.  You definitely contradict yourself in your post.

I’m good. Finishing off Ash vs Evil Dead.
---
I didn't see it for her like that till I saw that one fanart of all the killers dressed as nurses and she was just casually off to the side being tall and thicc.
---
I really want PennyWise to be a killer, not sure what any ones thoughts are on this.
---
I think New Freddy is way more fun to play against. Sure the fake pallets are frustrating but there's no more bullshit like being endlessly chased because Freddy wants to tunnel you for whatever reason, as Freddy lost his aura reading which made him almost impossible to lose in a chase. Being asleep also has no action speed penalty like it used to. (With the best speed reduction addon, Jump Rope, you only get a 9% speed penalty which is pretty pathetic. Old Freddy had a 50% speed reduction WITHOUT addons, and with them it could be as high as 75% with only Swing Chains)
---
I'm gonna miss Old Freddy but the new one seems less "Bullshit" for both sides like impossible-to-disengage-from chases and extremely slow gens for survivors, or having to wait before being able to attack as Killer.
---
I mean nice whining but how exactly do you suggest the devs "fix this". How is it their fault everyone wants to play killer at the same time?
---
Cant believe it. They usually nerf the shit out of something after PTB to make them B tier killers instead of being strong. Im so hyped for new Freddy
---
Absolutely love to see more!
---
Decisive Strike, We're Gonna Live Forever, Borrowed Time, Bond
---
This is a pretty cool variation on the trapper mask, what did you use to make it?
---
The bandaid on Meg's leg is far too small for that scrape.
---
&gt;or just work through ruin
---
This is natural reaction to the changes. Freddy is updated -&gt; People want to play Freddy/Killer more -&gt; more people queuing as killer = less people queuing as survivor -&gt; longed queue times. 
---
The devs can’t make people want to play the killer less, this is just a result of flocking to one queue vs another.
---
crinpejneed
---
Lol I'm just saying you claimed originally that you do nothing remotely like tunneling or camping but you essentially just admitted to proxycamping and tunneling as part of your base strategy.  Just pointing out the salt isn't coming from nowhere.
---
You should be focused on keeping them gens from popping and pressuring survivors not worrying about the last dude you hooked.  I play hyper aggressive and aim to always keep them having to pull off gens to save someone on a hook.  This playstyle while being way more fun for both sides and rewarding for me as a killer personally (more bps and easier pip) nets me very little salt.
---
Keep playing how you think you have to but don't be surprised when people get salty over it.  You'll have to either ignore it or block it if you're gonna proxy and tunnel out of habit.
---
This movie is insane btw... weird and brutal
---
Yeah it's the prestige 1 reward

bill isn't on PS4

You one comment ago:
---
&gt; They didn't provide examples of this system in action
---
You now:
---
&gt; They provided ONE example

And both of these happened after you re-looked at the notes. You cannot be taken seriously

Bitter murmur really isn’t that bad

No nerfs, no. There were some minor QOL additions, but he isn't weaker than the PTB version in any way.
---
Ebony Mory x100
---
Oh i see, thanks.
---
Maybe not the worst objectively but I still hate it
---
I'm always surprised when I get a gg, I have so much hate piled up in my Xbox messages that it's ridiculous
---
That's exactly it. With perks that also highlighted generator auras, it could be confusing and misleading when you tried to teleport to a generator. Now it'll show an indicator above the generator so you know which one you're teleporting to rather than changing the aura.
---
It basically means he gets a arrow pointing to the gen he wants to teleport too
---
The banners with trapper/Billy make me REALLY wish we had a beach map. I am sick to shit of forests/junkyards and cornfields.
---
Well thats one way and i know, when i see this hand held low i know there is a key and i mostly focus on these people before hatch spawns but still, i meant the not precautions but things you can or cannot do right when hatch is on the map
---
Thank god!
---
I've considered doing survivor wallpapers but they just don't have very distinct silhouettes for the most part, including quentin, but I could try using detailing to make him look distinct. But I am gonna do an ash one though but that's because I can give him a chainsaw and a shotgun to stand out
---
*extra extra*
---
*come and get your Demi plays*
---
*I said*
---
Myers has 2 add ons that allows him to kill all survivors who have been hooked once even when their in healthy or injured.
---
Indeed. I must have spelt it wrong.
---
are we still doing this us vs them kind of posts? alright
---
Don't worry I have plans for legion 😈
---
I've had fun on it, I've met some really fun l people on the game who joke around with the killer and the killer goes along with it and we've just enjoyed the game, don't get me wrong, I've had good times on the game, but there have been toxic times and a lot of others have expressed that they've had very toxic games. 
---
The person with the lisp who was getting made fun of that I mentioned earlier, here's a video on it when I was playing with my friend. Yes, it can be seen that I was being toxic too, playing Chad, stunning and dancing on the killer, but there were two people near the car, so I assumed if I drew Jason's agro, they could finish it up, even if I were to die, but uhhhhh they had other plans where it was to just run and shit talk, instead of doing the objective. Also note that when the screen goes black but there is still audio, that's just me alt tabbing from going over to Discord to type.
---

Yeah it seems to be worse with every patch somehow. Prefer to not even run it anymore since it triggers me more often than it works.

&gt;39 year old film btw
---
Thank you if you want to check out more of my wallpapers and art I have them all posted on my deviantart including nurse, Billy, wraith, huntress, and more: https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy
---
idk played around 20 games today and escaped like 4 times through gate and once through hatch. Not a large sample size but thats my usual experience at high ranks. Lots of nurses and spirits.
---
Mori
---
Yep. Really hoping BHVR can get to work on that because framerate drops are awful for almost every killer.
---
Would love to have wallpaper sizes for these!
---
Fixed an issue that caused The Huntress lullaby not to play from her perspective.
---
Oh thank goodness. I couldnt understand who these stealth Huntress' would just walk up to me and id have no idea.
---
But what if I benefit from hooking them? as in - BBQ aura, Devour Hope tokens, Huntress' Lullaby, etc? And if a basement is nearby?
---
Ok i admit i haven't faced him yet, but from what i've seen on streams so far, there is no way his power level is higher than a top tier nurse.
---
Hmm thats an interesting idea, I might just have to do that, I'll get back to you
---
It’s not even so much that I focus on the person that’s hooked, but I don’t wanna be too far away from him because if someone comes to get them and I spot said rescuer I can easily drop what I’m doing and pursue, if someone else frees them it’s whatever, but on some maps it’s kinda the only option. If I see someone after I hook someone obviously I’m gonna hunt them and ignore the hooked person. Camping is bad I agree, but I think Lite Patrolling is a fair strategy, compared to the strategies survivors have.
---
Welcome to prime time, bitch!
---
I like how this is a literal groundhog day when Freddy first released and everyone would all DC.
---
They are actually targeting Summer, so soon™
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020519772-Dedicated-Servers-Coming-in-Summer-2019
---
Because each one is a different layout? Not sure what the question is
---
They reworked the map to have 5 different variations
---
It honestly helps me mentally cause I used to just get all mad and rage; but once I started chilling out and just accepted that they're a player too and they're playing the game and sending them GGs I found myself being less angry and enjoying the game more even if I lose. Now if you're being a flat out jerk then all bets are off
---
Who invited Ochido to the subreddit?
---
A follow?? Omg 😲 thank you so much for the compliments and follow
---
It could be that the Wake Up bug was easier to find and fix than this particular bug.
---
Thank you so much 💙
---
He really isn't that OP though I mean besides sorta his pallets but even then he's not that good.
---
&gt;maybe because lots of ppl are trying freddy
---
Bingo. Anytime a killer is released/reworked this happens. It will settle back to normal over the next few days but for now if you want to play killer there is gonna be a helluva line
---
Okay, let's put it this way.
---
Ideally, the survivor killer ratio in the game would be 4:1
---
When a new killer is out, this ratio is skewed heavily.
---
Maybe take out Ghost Face then I can agree, but ngl Legion is just there so we can get BP
---
Absolutely, theres no way the devs would ever introduce such a feature.
---
/s for the uninitiated
---
Lol. You could definitely see them across the map. I play both killer and survivor plenty. Maybe that guy does suck, but don't lie about it's usefulness as a killer.
---
Must be an issue with your Xbox, PS4 update is only 1GB or so
---
This is an absolutely terrible list with a poor execution of ‘weighing’ what he thinks is important. Usually a decent content creator. This is garbage.
---
if you DC, you haven't been sacrificed
---
gotta keep that 100% winrate am I right?  
---
Kappa
---
well because of the update, it said there will be 5 variations on it now
---
Yes hopefully with the pallet rework they’ll nerf BL or remove it entirely.
---
They’d also need to revert the window changes to make vaulting loops more viable otherwise no point, with BL you’re just getting hit through the pallet or window forcing you to drop safe pallets early and waste them.
---
Hmm than most likely PS4 pro fps is improved aswell. Anyone tried it?
---
There’s probably still people downloading the update
---
Haha
---
they never did that to anyone other than Freddy
---
Oh wow thank you, I don't know if you checked on my deviantart page or not but I have almost all the killers there and plan to do the rest soon and more cool stuff: https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy
---
If the killer hits u just dc, it helps.
---
I don't like BBQ sauce on my beans
---
It's out now :)
---
For me, Doc can't afford to have any fat - taking Thrill *and* Haunted Grounds is one perk too many for my liking.
---
Haunted itself is great because Doc generally knows where everyone is on the map (get them to Madness II with Restraint, or just Madness III in general), so you can really capitalise on that instadown period - whether you're running a slug build or going for regular hooks. Doc is usually in a far better position if he can take one survivor out of the game early, which means you can relax a bit and farm.
---
Doc apparently gets no BP for Madness tier ups, so if you want to max out Deviousness it's going to mean Shock Therapy rather than just using Static Field.
---
I would be wary of Unnerving Presence - as early as L10 you'll be running into survivors who can do the hardest skillchecks in their sleep. I'd say stick with Distressing, BBQ, and Haunted Grounds for your core perks, and then fill it out with Pop Goes the Weasel or Ruin. You can expect Ruin to be cleansed, but it'll buy enough time for you to get people in Madness II *minimum*, and with Restraint that means you've got mapwide tracking for the rest of the game.
---
I started out using Distressing, BBQ, Unnerving, and Overcharge as my first "full" setup - worked great until green ranks, when I started encountering survivors that could consistently hit skillchecks. If you're happy with *always* using a 3-gen strat then certainly keep with the skillcheck setup, but for my money Doc needs to be very aggressive earlygame in order to remove one survivor and guarantee a decent endgame - Haunted Grounds and Ruin play into that, since the former gives you instadowns and the latter gives you more time to get people into Madness II.
---
the invivisble traps have a hitbox/slow effect
---
Maybe it's more specifically for stuff like save the best for last, but still seems weird considering most killer secondary attacks gain stacks for those.
---
Billy is overall the better killer. He’s fun to use, fun to play against, easy to use, high skill gap, and overall probably the most balanced killer for each side. Spirit is probably more powerful as a killer tho.
---
That and updating the game
---
Yeah it's only a little better on Ps4 (play on both) but it seems it's going to be forever until their optimisation "pass" will do its job.
---
maybe i'm just oblivious
---
I got you, the only survivor I'm planning to do but the only survivor cool enough to have a chainsaw arm so I think its fair
---
That's only on the new Badlam maps.
---
Luckily i now have learned to just chest rush immediately since i need to prestige anyways and i can hand out items while i grind BP.
---
The only way to win is by getting a 4K?
---
Have fun losing the vast majority of your games outside green rank
---
Yeah but this helps
---
Whew! Well you have my respect that’s one hell of a grind! Props to you, ya deserve it. Good shit!
---
Yes, hence the not running to lockers (literally) and Instead walking or crouching to them while also not being seen
---
Just how is any of this a problem with me?
---
THEYRE FUCKING AMAZING WTF
---
Lmao this sounds like a 12 year old's tough guy impersonation.
---
whatever it is, it's yet another nerf for the killer that's already one of the weakest. pretty good job so far
---
I am gonna make more, for plague, spirit, legion, and ghostface (is that all of them? Probably) and I will make mobile versions
---
Really? After the first PTB came out most people seemed rather impressed with him. 
---
The initial Dev stream didn't do a good job of showcasing the new Freddy. Hell, they didn't even mention that hitting someone forces them asleep.
---
Same
---
I hope so. The no dead hard no wiggle no escape thru gates no healing bug needs to stop too lol
---
post this on r/LeaksByDaylight
---
I personally like those maps. They look nice and play well. Now old Preschool on the other hand. Just thinking about it makes me shover in disgust.
---
I will! I love ghostface and I'm so happy he's in the game
---
We didn't get Bill also so maybe it's longer because of that?
---
The owner of the world record for Bowser's Big Bean Burrito, babyyyyyyyyy!!!
---
Happened to me, but not in toxicity. I like how they want to change the "problems" with Killers that make it easier to play surivors but they don't change the problems with survivors that make it easier to play killer. Thank you BHVR, very cool.
---
&gt; They’d also need to revert the window changes to make vaulting loops more viable otherwise no point,
---
I actually made a post about this yesterday! And yeah this was a bad change. It's silly that tiles becomes completely useless just because a pallet is gone
---
playing survivor is becoming a "run in a line until you get donked" simulator
---
The PS4 update is also glitched, and won't be featuring all the content the other platforms are receiving until a later date.
---
I'd love it
---
r/whoooosh ?
---
Freddy block add ons still suck because all they do is give blindness or hemorrhage even if your healthy
---
Oh Michael, I love him too, and I got you: https://www.deviantart.com/thatsgregbuddy/art/The-Shape-Wallpaper-761027229

Sadly out of all the leaked outfits, this is one of the few I’m not interested in :’(
---
I am planning to do one for ghostface and make mobile versions for all!
---
I liked it too, enjoy your gold sir
---
I'd love to see them. Good luck
---
I got plans for legion 😈
---
Ghostface looks amazing. Kate and Jeff as well as Billy and Trapper look great too. The Kate one I'd love as a poster.
---
The artists really do a good job with these banners.
---
^hey ^i’m ^in ^space
---
Bill and the L4D cosmetics aren't going to be ~9GB
---
My main two perks will always be Iron Will and Borrowed Time. Iron Will because it’s so much easier to sneak around without getting caught, especially since I play Jane... a very loud character. Borrowed Time is just always handy to have, I never farm with it and it makes me  do plays that would be impossible w/o it.    
---
My other two could really be anything else that I like, typically Deliverance and Balanced Landing.    
---
Other perks that I like include: Aftercare, Empathy, Lightweight, Dance with Me, Prove Thyself, Urban Evasion, Distortion, Flip Flop + Unbreakable
---
"Am I bad at the game? No, it's the game that's wrong." -Basketbomber
---
He could have some kind of sensing danger power
---
I literally do not care about my rank tbh. If I did I’d probably hate the game wayyyyyy more than I already do. I just play for whatever fun I can get out of it. If I can get at least one of my buds out it’s a W in my book.
---
Bill was the main thing I was looking forward to though
---
Sweet.
---
As I said to the other person, Bill and the L4D cosmetics aren't 9GB
---
I could probably do cool stuff with all them so I might do 3/4 wallpapers or just 1 I'm not sure yet, I'll see how it looks
---
Would be badass
---
Idk it’s not my own meme i just reupload it
---
I’m also a wraith main so yeah
---
Nah, it provides info on where the survs are going
---
The banner with Claudette making sand sculptures of her lab equipment is kind of sad and I don't know why.
---
Kate x Jeff  confirmed.
---
Yeah, I was playing a game where I made sure the last three gens were right next to each other yesterday and hooked a guy right in the middle of them then patrolled the gens so I was kind of camping in a way so I felt bad said gg and all after and was greeted with no comments about the gameplay only being told to commit suicide and that I'm a waste of oxygen. But his friend said gg. This community is weird
---
That’s definitely a moral victory. No way you outplayed the killer, though
---
Lol
---
Ideally you should build a PC. A good budget PC can easily run dbd with that budget.
---
The banners are in numerical order.Jane's,Claudette's,Trapper's and Billy's are coming out next week,then meg,then Ace with Nurse,then Nea and Hag,then Jeff's and Kate's,and the last one is ghostface.
---
not yet, i think as of today he’s on the other consoles though.
---
Lol it was summer 2019 before, next it'll be winter 2019
---
That has little to do with the killer (sans nurse), and more to do with having a bad team. You said you play solo. 1-2 people on your team aren't doing generators.
---
Generators should be done in 5 minutes max. 4 minutes if you have a toolbox and prove thyself. Killers shouldn't get more than 2 hooks.
---
Wraith mains rise up 👆👆🙏
---
Big opposite, it's the one I was interested in most and I nutted when I saw it was out. Hopefully your favorite is next week :D
---
"Well boys, we did it. Ruin is still there." is funny as fuck to me for some reason, god
---
Yes, it sure-as-shit was.
---
1. Who exactly promised you that? 
---
2. If you didn't realize you bought Generator Repair Simulator 2016 that your own fault for not doing any research before buying the game  /s
---
Damn you’re talented
---
There are already varying levels of safeness in many maps, I would assume they are going to expand on that, but have they mentioned this directly anywhere? The latest badham map change post seems to indicate a more intricate approach, but I could be misunderstanding.
---
We will see. Still it's getting more and more unfun to play survivor, nothing but nerfs for more than a year, no fixes for survivors, like that annoying blowing up gens stuff, if you get skill check while leaving it and new killers who specifically made to remove one health state fast without needing to actually catch the survivor.
---
I would like to see stats of that bhvr see to justify all the nerfs that where implemented and are still coming for the future. After ghostface release I'm having just the worst time with this game and rarely escape as it is, because most people are potatoes, even in red ranks, and it feels like bhvr balancing the game around swf, and as a solo survivor I just feel helpless most of the time. It's such a rare thing to actually get 4 good survivors as a solo player. Most are just urban/sprint burst/self care build users and you know they gonna useless.
---
You really miss the point of the game if you think it's all about balance at high ranks. Oh well, thats fine.
---
meg swoll

Pretty sound advice. I think you're right that I'm worrying too heavily about overall map presence. Definitely going to have to take a step back and not worry about overall area, considering Coldwind gives me a lot of Doctor issues. I'll do a little more research and use your suggestions. Thanks for another view.
---
My Bloodweb must really like Predator...
---
He said that block add-ons on Freddy still sucks, you know, the ones who give Blindness and Hemorrhage ...
---
It was the same on the PTB and the same for any new killer that comes out. Nothing new. Chill. It will pass.

Made me laugh for some reason 😂

Yeah but i need a laptop bc im not home a lot :(

no

I digress lol sorry for the hubbub.

Just had a survivor tell me he couldnt as well. I'm on Xbox.

I just spent more time installing this update that it takes me install a whole other game and I'm being literal

hell yeah

I always replied with an "okay lol whatever makes you feel better" but now I gotta try your way lmfao.
---
Like I just said, the anniversary stream.
---
And I don't really see anything here that indicates any intricacy at all. They said they're evaluating the strength; they didn't say anything about instituting a variety of strengths. Taken with what they said at the anniversary stream, I see no reason to think that
---
Someone else already did.
---
oh god yes fill me with survivor salt

Lol that didn’t take long

They actually just appear in my pocket over time. I have no idea where they come from

Yet people complain about SWF? Killers should def get more than 2 hooks idk what your talking about.

Here's hoping that 80% of this stuff isn't auric cells only.

I think you have me beat for best ping, but can I ask what you use to have the brightness so high??? It's like you can actually SEE what's going on in the game!!!
---
It's really only a factor on speed limiter most of the time. It's weird because they've claimed for quite a while there was no bug.
---
It's not a thing on PC I'm sure
---
New Freddy is great, but all my teams have been doing now is prematurely throwing down every god damned pallet. I think it's time to take a little break from survivor for a while.
---
Head on is also still hot garbage.
---
3-gen doctor is as boring to play against as it is boring to play.
---
Its conjecture, no need for a spoiler tag.
---
Just play Survivor
---
ha
---
I shouldn't have laughed but I did..
---
Probably with the new Killer
---
Trapper looking like he's ready to crush some sand... Lab equipment...
---
Is that why they always fail skill checks?
---
So quick question. On xbox are Bill's perks going to be locked away for everyone who hasn't unlocked them yet or is he just not going to have teachable on his 30/35/40 bloodwebs? Seems like a silly question but I'm curious.
---
Edit: I said addons not perks. Whoops
---
AND he doesn't even have obsession perks on
---
Red mori, best add-on and best killer time :D
---
because playing the safe pallet can get you a hit in just a few seconds
---
god i hate this
---
I have a Hex meme name.... I feel called out...
---
lol i never heard it be called Super NOED before 
---
true though
---
Trapper _hates_ beach nerds.
---
The blocks were changed from PTB?
---
they sped up her speed while charging and slowed down her speed while holding it. Overall she's faster while charging compared to PTB, but it does discourage indefinitely holding a ranged attack at (with certain add-ons) a speed faster than 115 movement.
---
I also can't believe so many people think she's bad when she is possibly one of the higher mid tier killers out there.
---
Instead of generators the survivors build sand castles that the killer can kick over like a bully.
---
Boring for who exactly? It seems exciting for both sides honestly
---
They went back on it. They didnt like the idea of people staying in the match longer for the sole purpose if getting more survival points but they do want to give survivors more stuff to do for survival but not sure what for now.
---
Yeah, but why would you do that if you can also get a safe pallet tossed without using more than a few extra seconds to then get the hit?
---
Can't agree, the fact that there's something hilarious about getting a survivor to throw one down on you is so satisfying. 
---
Not everything needs to take skill. It would be like arguing Wraith needs to solve a puzzle before he's allowed to cloak. Sometimes simplicity is good.
---
Can you explain what I’m doing wrong then?
---
Yeah but they barely given anything for survivors to play with for the last few patches. They gave couple of small buffs to three perks when GF was released. Before that maybe Ash patch? Cosmetics are really nice but thats not really gameplay.
---
I really wish that Meg wouldn’t only ever get athletic outfits. Like we get it, she’s an athlete but even athletes wear other types of clothing sometimes. She never gets normal cute clothes anymore.
---
That's pretty dumb. Some dev must keep getting destroyed by a pig in rank 19 or something.
---
&gt; and new killers who specifically made to remove one health state fast without needing to actually catch the survivor.
---
oh come the fuck on lol

u/Kingslay87's Golden Pack has been updated for 3.1.0.
---
Yeah I know about that but that's not what I was talking about, I was talking about how it happens in other levels NOT 50
---
You're clearly awful at chases and spatial awareness.
---
This just happened to my smh, I couldn't even use my self care or instaheal medkit and after that the entity just went up in my butthole lmao.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Didn't there used to be offerings that affected the brightness of the moon?
---
Freddy being able to teleport from one half of the map to the other half of the map in like 3 seconds seems super strong. That's a pretty cool change, if nothing else.
---
You've always been able to do that. They just removed the unintentional nerf.
---
Somebody just got downed by a dream pallet
---
0 (being the host) :p
---
Fall and Winter is all sighing the same gaps of time to me so idc when they drop as long as it’s stable. It could be 2020 and as long as it’s working I’m happy.
---
Freddy is supposed to be scary in nightmares.  Not in the actual world. So being able to do damage while awake goes against his whole concept
---
&gt; remove bloodlust. It doesnt need to exist anymore
---
rip huntress. i get looped for 3 gens on huntress against good survs. bloodlust is a godsend.
---
Ok, what the fuck am I doing wrong then? I’m doing a generator, I’m aware of my surroundings, I have my ears pitched for heartbeat, I don’t run away to a hiding place instead I walk and crouch, I run when I know they can’t find scratch marks in the current situation, I don’t make noise on windows and pallets, I don’t screw up on generator, I don’t do anything to bring the killer exactly to me in the beginning of the game, I go in a locker in there’s multiple lockers, I hide behind rocks and trees and walls, I pallet loop efficiently, I dodge hatchets, I stop working o the generator when they get near so they don’t hear the sound of a survivor tinkering, I have my eyes on the killer while remembering the surroundings, etc.
---
Anyway, again I ask you
---
What am I doing wrong?
---
They haven’t changed from old Freddy to new Freddy is what I mean. Like they’re still “reduce dream transition by X seconds”
---
I dont think needing a perk to not be at a disadvantage is OP. If anything it speaks to the balance of the game.
---
Any chance you could do Survivor ones? Maybe inverting the colors unstead. Or doing a black and white scheme to differentiate from the killers.
---
My ideas if this became a change
---
NOED - Black
---
Thrill - Orange
---
Ruin - Green 
---
Devour hope - Red
---
Third seal - Yellow
---
Lullaby - White
---
Haunted - Blue
---
Hex: Gotcha Toes
---
It was like 1.7 or something?
---
It's comforting to know that theres at least a few people who agree
---
Just played two games in a row against him. My god.
---
Literally every option is too. Far. Away.
---
The killer catches me with every juke attempt, every window attempt, every pallet attempt, every chase attempt, fucking everything
---
You are useless! You give me NOTHING helpful! I’m blocking you now, you spout only “you is bad” without “here is how you not be bad”.
---
Aw, Look at how nice billy is. Cooking up some BBQ for his friends! Especially trapper after that tiring swim
---
Over powered is more of a perk that creates a severe disadvantage without a reliable work around. Which this perk does not do.
---
you did see he cancelled the mori animation right? Call me crazy but a killer with a secure mori kill on the last person wouldn't cancel out of the animation unless they were mori taunting
---
I’m sorry but the new rework to Freddy makes him fun to play against and also play with. Sure using Freddy at rank 20-15 is a cake walk but once you get to red ranks ol Freddy boi was a waste to use. Every time as a survivor I played against Freddy I knew that game was going to be easy mode. He was extremely susceptible to looping and a decent group of survivors in red ranks have all 5 gens done in minutes so even if ol Freddy boi got a hook at end game he still couldn’t finish the job and 4 people escaped EASILY. Now with the rework and him being able to hit outside of sleep world makes him more viable and makes end game hooks a little more difficult to save.
---
I hope to god that it will
---
It was 1.2 GB for me.
---
yea im sorry but i dont agree.  i bought freddy cause he's freddy.   but i didnt enjoy using him.  waiting to hit people was annoying as hell.  no way to interrupt any action unless they were asleep.  
---
so yea i'm very excited to try the new freddy
---
Or someone can just make them on pc, like they do with all the other icon packs.
---
I’m honestly in awe at this entire comment section lmao. I can’t believe how many of you are actually defending the killer for this and/or shaming the survivor for “gEtTing OuTpLaYeD.” This entire community really is toxic.
---
It is possible to miss it though, especially if someone was hasty and thought they didn't get it or something. I know from experience since it can be finnicky
---
I actually saw a thread earlier that was saying that the pallets should start tied up so the survivors have to work to unlock their loops. I’m saying that currently a survivor can run you around and around with no punishment, that is dumb. They have no repercussions for looping which is way too easy since most loops have some form of line of sight whether it be you just seeing them or seeing them through the cracks in a structure. The killer can be amazing but there are certain loops that just can’t be dealt with other than running in circles and wasting precious time. The killer is supposed to have the power and the survivors the numbers, but right now the killer has less power than the survivors. They should be punished for staying near the killer too long as the point is to get away, not just waste time.
---
It was way too easy for survivors to wake up. Even with add-ons
---
Yes would love
---
New Airplane killer?
---
Nada
---
Playing this since release and I still don't know how ranking up works
---
Almost as THICC as Jane's thighs!
---
PS4 but we ain't getting no damn 60fps
---
A lot of survivors use perks like self care and bond. Does that mean they are OP?
---
This is a different approach. While the multiplier values are up for debate, I think most people would agree lethality &gt; stall &gt; detection. Something noteworthy here is that it places hag close to the top. As of the last stat sheets release we know that hag has the highest kill rate, at least when averaged across the ranks. This tier list is fairly close to the majority of others made by experienced players, with the only major difference being that spirit is ranked a bit lower than usual. I think this tier list is solid for the majority of players. If you are playing consistently at rank 1 you would probably put spirit higher, but at that point you probably don't need to be looking up tier lists anymore.
---
The title doesn’t say Dedicated Servers Patch 4head.
---
What does having higher fps even do though.
---
Thanks.
---
Hey. No.
---
I'm guessing no dedicated servers since I can't find anything about it
---
Ash? We know he isn't a lesbian
---
Another Ghostface cosmetic?
---
Is that a BILL cosmetic?
---
you could, but they said that they limited the amount of safe pallets, so that would only come into play a few times per match and then its back to the short pallets
---
I'll answer. Probably nothing what I am going to do chase down 3 while they are already at the gate one doubles back to free his buddy after I chase some one that's just going to circle jump or gamble some one is dumb enough to play hero and go for the rescue and I get two instead of one.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cgvbxd/first_bug_is_up_already/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

oh come on. this was absolute horseshit and you know it. there are actual nerfs to complain about and you look ridiculous when you choose to cry about broken nonsense being taken away
---
&gt; Entering lockers gives the blindness status
---
because otherwise OoO is way too fucking strong
---
&gt; Addition of a stun after falling from a height, making a yelp noise while falling
---
this is just omega crybaby tbh
---
sorry friend but ghostface is coming out last. the banners are numbered with plague's being 1
---
next are the summer cosmetics (claudette, jane, trapper and billy) 
---
then ace and nurse's, then nea and hag's, then kate and jeff and lastly ghostface
---
Logically, if every surv gets matched instantly, but Killers are stuck waiting, this means there simply isn't any survs available to meet the high Killer demand.
---
Of course there are many peoples who liked the old Fredy same as you, but you are the minority. Time to accept that and start to carry on.
---
Smoother gameplay
---
Yet they still didn't fix the issue with people having problems ranking up. :(
---
If you have a survivor that hasnt unlocked Bill’s teachables, you’ll need him to unlock it. If you have a survivor that has them already you’re good.
---
Those are both good ideas actually.
---
No surprise. Everyone wants to play new killer.
---
I'm assuming you weren't a freddy main, just as is the case with every killer there are small nuances to the kit. Nurse isn't as easy as 'blink to a survivor and smack them' sure you can play and only use the power to its lowest potential but if you spend enough time understanding how it works and what it allows it has a lot more potential
---
Up Next: Are Bloody Party Streamers OP?
---
Will do buddy. I cud use something like this for yt thumbnails for sure if we had an arrangement..
---
With killers you mentioned their strengths made up for their drawbacks.
---
You don't have to be nice to anyone, but don't be mad when people think you're a dick.
---
It's no different than with real life. Your job description likely didn't say "don't be an asshat to your coworkers"
---
Thanks man, I appreciate the civil response!
---
I don’t fucking know what fps you exactly have i just googled it up
---
i literally just unlocked ruin like a week ago and my nurse was the first to have it pop up in the bloodweb.   used her in 3 matches with it so far.  1st match it was cleansed prob within 1 minute.  2nd match, by the time 1st gen was finished.  3rd match nobody touched gens till they got it which was probably 2 or 3 mins.  i managed 2 hits in that time
---
it seems that people are checking for it and going for totems.  so i'm trying to run thrill of the hunt with it as well.
---
yes that is exactly my point!
---
When gf came out, not every killer was playing gf (the majority sure but I had plenty of non-gf). Same has been true when every killer comes out. It's not a end all solution but there are enough bp whores who would switch teams if motivated ("I ain't a survivor main but BP is BP), especially if they want to suit up their new Freddy with some sweet perks. It'll also motivate Survivor mains to play a few more games since there's extra bp to be had that may not be there tomorrow. 
---
So yeah, it probably would help out some in this case...
---
disregard the fact it can be a thing at all stages of the game for Huntress.
---
They should buff Killers if they introduce this
---
Saved for later deeze nice.
---
lol better bury your hope
---
See my reply to someone else comment, I've already explained why that drawback is fair
---
Lmao come back when you have a drivers license
---
Wow I'm sorry if I'm coming off as salty. I don't have problem with countering dream pallets.
---
Yes, I do like things in the game to have room for improvement, doing things should take skill, yes? Dream Pallets rely on survivors to mess up, with no real interaction from Freddy himself. That means it has a weaker effect the better survivors are, while I think it should get stronger the better the Freddy is.
---
Where should I bury it ?
---
Shup ps4 is for gays not gamers anyway
---
I miss old Freddy especially some of the novelty builds you can run with him like 0 TR Freddy, One Punch Freddy (Which still probably would work. I'm about to try it right now.), etc. but the new Freddy feels more fun to me. 
---
I found his old playstyle very similar to The Doctor which was why I got him. His new playstyle feels very aggressive and chase oriented.  I still think new freddy feels more fun to play and especially play against.
---
EDIT: I think new Freddy also feels more like Freddy Kruger to me. The blood puddles with the arms reaching out, the decoy pallets, the teleporting animation, etc. Old Freddy made the dream world more unique, but the only thing being asleep meant was you were slow in interactions and Freddy could both hit and track you. New Freddy just feels more like NOES.
---
Honestly I struggle with all the killers in purple ranks against good survivors, but I hop on Nurse and obliterate them immediately. But it's just not fun playing Nurse too much. I wanna do goofy Myers shit, Ghostface, but they all get looped to hell.
---
Maybe it's easy on PC to counter ghost with mouse. On console I have no idea what I need to do, I stand right in front of him and watch directly at him still can't bring him out of stealth. Multiple times I stalk him while he is stalking someone else and tried to position camera various way still nothing. Could be a bug, wouldn't surprise me at all. 
---
And I'm not crying about not seeing him, I know he is where, can't do anything about it.
---
Smart plagues won't chase a survivor she puked on. Survivor will either won't cleanse and go to one health state for the rest of the match or give her super powers to down him easy later on.
---
Been rank 1 for last 6 resets. Not calling her OP, just saying I'm tiried of killers who have powers specifically to ignore one of the fundamental peace of the game.
---
Balance is definitely in this debate due to it making it easier for survivors. I’d love to hear these supposed OP killer tactics. In a way chases are a test, where is the nearest pallet and how long till I throw it down. Pipping as killer is most certainly not easy, since you love to cite your streamers look at tru3ta1ent, he plays kill a ton a often times points out how stupid pipping is for killer. Having a constant line of sight that most loops provide certainly makes it easier and optimal loop pathing just comes from practice. Sure better killers make the survivors have to be more efficient but not more skilled. All it means is that they need to minimize risk to stay alive longer while the team gen rushes. It’s not hard to minimize risk when you have things like dead hard, insta heals, tons of pallets and loops (some of which are basically infinite like cold wind farm barn at times), flashlights to blind them, adrenaline to heal you if you’re hit and get you way the hell away, borrowed time and decisive to force them to switch targets thus wasting more time attempting to down yet another looper. Pipping is most definitely counted as a win since that is the end competitive goal, to get to rank one. Considering how you have to basically die instantly to depip it’s laughably easy to rank up.  500 milliseconds is plenty of reaction time. Have you ever played For Honor where you have to parry 300 millisecond attacks while dealing with server lag? That takes skill and timing. Faking a window does not require skill, you literally just run at it and don’t vault and hope they miss. You can point out streams and the numbers all you want but the streams are just certain people’s experiences and the stats are just survival rates, not pipping which is the goal for most, despite you not caring.
---
She needs a night on the town look, or something themed like Victorian outfits we saw on killers.
---
I'll suffer through Haddonfield, unless it was done by an offering. I am absolutely not going to waste my time trying to chase any team all using balanced and abusing Haddonfield houses. I could do more pleasurable things like getting a root canal.
---
killer main. Consistent red ranks for two years now. Nothing gives us a worse name than the toxicity leatherfaces bring. Its gotten to the point that I just hate seeing the fucking ass hole :/  
---
Whenever I play survivor for fun, about 90% of the time I see a leatherface they face camp the first person they see (I float around survivor 7-9). From what I see if you want the auto down of a chainsaw you pick hillbilly, and if you want the ability to ensure the guy doesnt get off first hook you pick leatherface.   
---
So not a survivor main, just hate leatherface
---
We need an old cabin or camp in the night forest type of map with this
---
Was this whole post just a low effort humble brag
---
Whould u say that one is ok?

Funny thing is I played a match against 4 SWF a few weeks ago they beat me then I picked wraithed and beat them. They invited me to their party and were surprised to realize they played me twice and we just played kill your friends for the rest of the night.
---
It’s no longer directional
---
It's honestly probably because people complained about the other things you had to do besides generators . Mostly likely why we got that lack lustre anniversary event sigh .
---
Eh.  They are a tired meme at this point.
---
Oh hey PC and Xbox players here is a cool update with a Freedy Re-Work and Bill! also some costumes for your survivors, as well as some new achievements to boot!
---
Oh Hey PS4 fuck you guys again and here's 1 quarter of the update, and we still haven't reduced the achievements requirements for you guys like we have for PC and Xbox.
---
That is how this reads to me.
---
OP said that survivors have *never* been nerfed. All I did was show survivor nerfs, there is no subtext to be read into with what I was saying. Those are survivor nerfs, and OP was looking for survivor nerfs.
---
Dbd has massive frame drops on PS4 and Xbox, as the games poorly optimized, and to add insult to injury, the unreal engine itself is tougher of consoles even if it is optimized. Without a PS4 pro or Xbone X, you’ll likely drop below 15 FPS sometimes.
---
Nea looks freaking awesome, shes doing them sick flips against the hag
---
Seems like a lot of the "arguing" in this topic is about semantics of the word OP. Everyone seems to agree Ruins is by far the best perk and its a must have, but some people still don't want to call that OP...
---
Maybe he wanted to farm EXP? EXP is pretty much only dependant on playtime, emblems impact is laughable (at most equivalent of 18 seconds).
---
Do you know any good korean streamers? I’d like to see some of these matches (from both perspectives if possible)
---
Considering i didn't even post a screenshot like some other members have, then no. Its just an opinion from one person. Was this whole comment a low effort douching?
---
Bloodpoints is not gameplay. But lately the killer queues have been bad consistently even outside releases.
---
Bitter Murmur is fun for cross-map Huntress snipes :D
---
I don't understand why you were implying that I hated ruin. I said it wasn't fine because it's RNG based while tending to spawn in weak places. 
---
It's not "fine" not because it's bad but because it's in a weird spot where you have to have it to even be able to win. And something that is required to play shouldn't be a perk.
---
Don't you double depip and lose all your bloodpoints earned that match if you DC? that doesn't sound like a win to me...
---
I used to play as Hex:Begone Thot on PC
---
Meanwhile i can't get out of rank 12 as survivor because since rank reset i get put into 18-19 rank matches and the people there are... something else. I mean those people that i can tell, because most just DC when they get downed.
---
Thank you and I might do survivor ones but it's hard because they don't have very distinct silhouettes. I am gonna do ash though because he has a chainsaw and a shotgun so it's easy to make him out. But if I can make it work I will try to do survivor ones :)
---
Ah the good teabag at the end 💜
---
They explain this in lore with the whole 'microsleep' concept though: When you're a survivor in a match with Freddy, you're so sleep deprived that the entire time you're in the match, you're constantly nodding off and jolting awake, just barely on the verge of totally falling asleep.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
Hot
---
It's not an "us vs them" mentality because I play more survivor than Killer. I'm speaking objectively, the game is unbalanced towards survivors and always has been. Sure there are things that survivors deal with (nurse / spirit mains lulw) that suck, and I would balance those too, but survivors ability to bully killers is unsustainable. The game nearly died driving killers into the ground, so it's in our interest to keep the ladder healthy.
---
For clarification; Freddy was BMing while I was on hook after chasing me for 3 gens so yes I tbagged at the gate, almost insta karma too lol
---
Considering all you did was talk about how you did great. You brought up zero conversation about his rework as a whole, his new abilities, his power level etc. all you did was say “HEY I DID GOOD WITH NEW FREDDY”
---
I could try that too, good idea
---
Gotta agree with your 3rd and 4th points. Just keep at it you'll get the hang of it. Do your gens. Don't waste your time on a potato who is getting downed within 5 secs. Learn when to be in stealth or a killer magnet when required. Learn the loops. Know the killer's weakness (pretty sure you know the limitations of killers, since you main them). Use your killer knowledge when going against them. If you know how the killer works you can outsmart them. :)
---
Ah my bad. I just see a lot of hate(mainly from the same two people) and because your comment was vague I assumed you on the side of thinking it was OP. 
---
My bad friendo.
---
And you'd get a shit ton of EXP as an added bonus.
---
I think a lot of people who try to play as survivor and fail forget this is meant to be played as a stealth game. If you’re consistently getting spotted &amp; tunneled early on it means you’re not playing correctly. Just saying.
---
I mean if the killer is rank 18 it barely matters what your partners do, if you are any good you should be able to run him around all match lol
---
there will always be dumbasses in the comments saying that you deserved it for hiding there or that its not bannable and the killer is innocent....
---
Under a dream pallet
---
Definitely not needed. Just got 3 4ks in a row. Having reduced speeds while BOTH asleep AND awake is not needed...
---
We could maybe work something out but I got a lot of requests so I've got to make sure I do the first things first, like plague, spirit, ghostface, and legion. Then I'll do mobile versions of all of them then I can get to special requests but I can totally make some yt thumbnails in this style if you want, as long as you credit me obviously
---
Is the meta different on what platform you’re on? Because I haven’t played against a spirit at all the last month
---
I can’t wait to see how that turns out!
---
I think doctor disagrees that this game is meant to be played in stealth.
---
Lol what planet do you live on? PS4 players are not getting anywhere close to 60fps.
---
Calm Spirit exists.
---
I’m fairly new to the game. Can someone explain the difference between safe and unsafe pallets? Thanks
---
No? I just wanted to express my opinion on how boring they are. There is no subtext to read into here. Dream Pallets take little effort for Freddy to use, he places a dream pallet, and it is up to the survivors on whether or not it is effective. Dream Pallets get directly weaker based on how skilled the survivors are.
---
I do look around while doing literally anything, and I do notice killers if they are visible including ghost face, micheal, literally anyone. I can’t mind game them because suddenly they have universe-brain when chasing me in early game.
---
Yeah, near pallets too.
---
Hey! The Claudette and Jane banner is the same as Hillbilly and Huntress? (I don't recognize that killer) maybe they are part of a event?
---
I don't like that he doesn't lose bloodlust when using his power to drop the snares.
---
For me they always check every inch of the gen for someone hiding behind it so sadly... that’s a no no.
---
Will you do DLC killers too?
---
I've actually had situations where one end of the bloodweb contained a good perk tier 2 and the other contained a shit perk tier 3 and I really had to think about taking the shit perk just so it stops showing up.
---
Doesn't help a tiny bit if no gens are done.
---
And yeah i've had a game in which i ran the killer for ages until he got bored off me, then killed/DC'ed the other 3 and i got hatch. Got double pip on that but next game i die on first hook because everyone sits in corners the whole game, and the game after that the killer DCs after our first chase and i depip. Boom both pips gone.
---
Myers. Better base power. Better add-ons.  The tombstone/pieces make him a force to be feared.
---
Supernatural DBD chapter?owo
---
Or how about you observe freedom of speech and I'll say whatever the hell I want in MY posts. And understand not all posts have a meaning to them. Its just somebody trying to be part of this toxic ass community you and other assholes like you have created. A guy cant say whats on his mind without little turds like you coming out the woodwork. If you dont like the post then dont read it. Give it a thumbs down. But theres absolutely no reason whatsoever for you to be rude to a fellow gamer posting about a game we both play. Theres new content and people are going to post about it. However they want to post about it. Screenshot, video, comment, etc... I dont see you jumping on anybody elses post that posted a screenshot bragging about their merciless kills. Maybe add something positive to it and the conversatiin could continue, instead you were kinda an ass about a simple comment. Dont like my posts? DONT READ THEM
---
Are you sure the actual update was 10 GB?  On ps4 updates will make you clear out a space much larger than the update itself, which can lead to confusion.  For example, it’s common for a Destiny update to require 60+ GB of free space, even if the update itself is under a gig.
---
Wha..... What do you think that thing does......? Hint: no perks.
---
But if you play stealthy you don't get any evader points.
---
Nah he would say that when he opens a locker.
---
I don't think there is anything super specific for Freddy. Just for your usual strong build imo. Like:
---
* Balanced Landing
---
* DS
---
* Self Care or Bond
---
* Adrenaline or Unbreakable
---
Arguably the *worst* perk in the game. If Sabo Squads ever made a comeback it will instantly go into the Meta but until that day it's borderline useless.
---
Mate on my queue it says network:10MB of 10.32 GB
---
Tbh I'm never prestiging any of my killers ever again. It took waaay too long to get whispers, ruin, and nurse's.

Well yes it's just a word issue, OP used to mean something that you can't play around, but it got overused as people described everything they considered strong as OP. So now OP just means something that is strong, but literally, it's overpowered, so even better than just "strong". But to be honest it can really be confusing and you could say both for this, it's in a really weird spot.
---
10 Gb on Xbox because PS4 didn’t get The left behind dlc? Just a guess
---
“Tentatively fixed an issue that could prevent Survivors from successfully escaping through the exit gates”
---
I know it says tentatively, but man I hope what ever they did works. The not escaping thing is so annoying especially after a hard ass match.
---
Understandable, have a nice day.
---
I won't call him OP, but you need to be a smart survivor around him, know when to run and when to hide, a single strategy won't work every time
---
I had to double check this because I've not played killer on PC much lately (queue times lol), but I found a recent video of someone playing on PC where the bug is definitely present.
---
That's been my New player experience. No character's teachables, and I only have Wraith leveled in any capacity. The stock Killer perks may have some use cases, but they feel really bad for a new player build compared to the stuff Survivors can get early on(aside from NOEd, but I really don't want to use NOED until I can reliably win without it). Bill is available from the start, so you can get Borrowed Time very quickly if you feel like playing him.  
---
That's not to say I hate any of the survivor perks or anything, there's nothing ATM I hate playing against in particular. It's just rough sometimes when builds seem to have this big disparity in quality for a new player experience.
---
You’re more than likely going to run into the killer eventually even as a stealth player. But you shouldn’t go running around in the open as soon as the match starts, that’s how you get hooked + tunneled + sacrificed within the 1st 5 minutes... which is one of OP’s major complaints.
---
They could just make still being in a match give like 10 points per second, which it gives either after survivor dies, or after reaching the max amount, like 3000, so that surviving gives all 8000.
---
I'm a little tired of them at this point, but I'll always remember Hex: NoHead.
---
They did during their livestream. [There was even a post made with all the details](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9e708/freddy_rework_comprehensive_description/)
---
What does that even mean?
---
Surely you can’t be serious
---
What...about it?
---
Alert, lithe, dark vision/sense and technician.
---
Alert and dark sense/vision give me info on where the killer is and if they are chasing someone.
---
Lithe for escaping. Dead hard has let me down to many times.
---
Technician for those times I can't hit a single skill check.
---
In lobby it looks completely blonde. It used to look ginger-ish. Could just be me.
---
Loops that if the killer isn’t right behind you, the loop is so long that a chase won’t start and even if it does they’ll lose bloodlust from losing line of sight, and multiple windows and pallets so even if a window gets blocked, there are alternatives, basically a loop strong enough to run the killer for 5 gens, like the grim pantry main building
---
Condensed version:
---
Usually main building
---
Several windows
---
Several pallets
---
Balanced landing activation 
---
Many line of sight breaking spots inside area
---

---
Who said it's meant to be played like that????? It's a co-op horror survival game. Just because you prefer to play like that doesn't mean others should.
---
&gt; And yeah i've had a game in which i ran the killer for ages until he got bored off me, then killed/DC'ed the other 3 and i got hatch. Got double pip on that 
---
Yea that's how you do it.
---
&gt; next game i die on first hook because everyone sits in corners the whole game
---
If you get caught by a rank 18 you definitely have room to improve....
---
Oh, yeah, that totally makes sense.
---
That's what you get for bringing in an instaheal
---
Generally when people point out freedom of speech they aren’t so hypocritical. I can give my opinion just like you did. All I did originally was call you out for humbly bragging. You were the one that brought this conversation to this point with saying I was “douching”. Just like you I’m observing my right to freedom of speech. You need to realize that calling someone else on anything even if it’s in a somewhat dickish way does not constitute being toxic. You’re part of the toxic community a you proved it with how you addressed me. The dead by daylight community really isn’t that toxic. Now read over everything you said and I said and understand your hypocrisy.
---
It's getting really tiring having to repeat myself here, if you put in the work then he was fine. I fail to see how I'm entitled for ranting about how I'm annoyed I paid for a character and now that's been thrown out the window. I have lost actual money and essentially been told to go eff myself
---
I mean get far away from that gen. Crouch away and wait for the killer to be near the gen. You should be crouched a bit off to the side. Then sprint away. He won't see you if he's looking on the other side or busy kicking the gen. These 3-5 second windows can be important for getting out of there unseen.
---
Doesn’t matter imo, both worse than nurse, and both better than every other killer
---
Wait the slowdown applies to awake survivors aswell?
---
Just adding my 2 cents as a Rank 1 survivor to somebody having problems... but by all means, play however you guys want. Some people do really well playing aggressively, but most do not.
---
Also, IIRC, the developers themselves have publicly stated that survivors are meant to play stealthily - this has been an ongoing response from them when players complain about survivor capability to rank up as easy as killers
---
Ross Geller is that you?
---
Holy shit and i get a 10 minute timer but this dude can talk as much as he wants, that's how you know this world is going to shit.
---
Pls no kill :’(
---
Ive just gotten one hooked and moried twice lol. My teams have all died too
---
What was the bug?
---
They're the opposite of boring, they're the funniest thing to see on stream lol
---
The lowest I have ever gotten was 17mbs
---
These are killer perks dude
---
Thanks mate whould you mind sending me another 2 or 1 so i can deside and talk with other ones about them but anyways thanks

That was obviously in reference to #3 of OP’s complaints. You can’t get tunneled / hooked in the 1st 20 seconds of a match unless you are running around in the open as soon as the match starts. You replied to my comment which was to OP and I expanded on it - nobody was accusing you of running out in the open.
---
Its the Trapper i think. But yeah, it does look lile that same banner
---
I see. I guess they really have to step up their game in terms of polish and optimization for storage.
---
true, but Legions Pin addons are worse and Freddy has lots of other good addons

I know, I was just doing a joke from the movie “airplane”

You still wake up from a missed skill check

The syringes and saws came out damn good. I assume you're using Illustrator?

It does not as confirmed by the devs

what would be the spooky power?

Well in my experience, good luck finding me when you’re playing as the Doctor. 👍🏻

Youre not even making sense anymore and just pulling things out of your ass which judging by your username you might be used to. But no judgement here. I did nothing wrong except make a post about a game. You came in being a dousche expecting to not be treated like a dousche. Thats where YOU went wrong. Trying to say its my fault for saying it is like saying its a womans fault she got raped cuz of the clothes she wore. Stop trying to make yourself look better because its not working. Maybe dont post toxic comments and you wont get toxic comments back. Ever think of that?
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Thanks. Kind of unfortunate though, it would make the perk better.
---
Just dont get hooked 4Head
---
Has anyone tested what exactly that means for Pig yet? Does it mean ambush no longer insta-downs exposed survivors?
---
any elaboration or suggestions?
---
Is it Neas face in the bush?
---
I wish they'd increase BP gains because right now you need to spend millions of bloodpoints to get it.
---
Holy shit ive suffered that glitch and it is a pain. You can't wiggle, recover, or heal yourself, and you can't see progress on healing others/getting healed. Especially painful against Legion, if he feral frenzies you, you are dead if no one is around
---
Freddy did not need a complete scrapping of his kit. All he needed were a few mechanic changes and survivor perk nerfs and he would have been fine. I'm really not happy with this rework at all.
---
Plague. Her design is among the most intricate and elegant in the entire game. From head to toe she's full of detail from her missing toe to the tip of her golden diadem, she's absolutely gorgeous.

Had a guy take me to the hatch and close it, I had adrenaline and a key lul.

+1 i agree, its broken. But keys are broken too.
---
Terrors May indeed stalk these shadows, but yonder, a glint of good.
---
He can still hit you though, and you alert him to where you are and regress the gen.
---
the adept for bill , get 250 protection hits after someone has been saved from hook  and escape through the exit gate after doing the last gen as the last survivor.
---
So is it easy or not?
---
&gt;I have been playing him non-stop
---
Then there's me, still trying to find one killer match.
---
i was really thinking about putting her on my list
---
I'm grateful you put forward an actual coherent argument instead of making a point I already covered. I get that I'm part of the minority who liked him but I still think it would be nice if you could maybe choose which version of him to go, perhaps by using an add on or offering
---
Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse, and Huntress
---
Ebony Mori is just a gimmick. Just move on to the next game

---
Safe pallets are pallets at loops a Killer cannot quickly circle around. The Killer is forced to break safe pallets in order to catch the Survivor, as the Survivor can just vault over the pallet repeatedly and the Killer will never be able to reach them.
---
- The pallet at the Killer's Shack, the pallet that blocks the hallway in Léry's, and the pallet on Ormond's second story balcony are all examples of a safe pallet.
---
Unsafe pallets are pallets at loops that the Killer can quickly move around. Killers with enough bloodlust or who mindgame the Survivor can catch the Survivor at these loops without breaking the pallet. 
---
- The pallets at jungle gym structures, pallets at most waist high loops, and pallets around the Mother's Dwelling in the Red Forest map of the same name are examples of unsafe pallets.
---
Inb4 people start complaining the entirely optional cosmetics are too expensive.
---
Well since the demogorgon could affect lights and electronics, it's ability could be something along the lines of making a random generator stop working for 5-10 seconds. It'll be a 1 minute cool-down.
---
Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, Quick and Quiet, and Lightweight used to be my peak Meg build, even after the Exhaustion rework. It relied more on getting away quickly than looping so he nerf was fine with me.
---
I’ve recently switched to Shirtless David, however, and I now run No Mither, Dead Hard, This Can’t Be Happening, and Resilience. Ultimate Glass Cannon.
---
Lmfao
---
Where can I get in on this viewing action?  Link to some good stuff?
---
On Xbox at the title screen it says “A patch is required to access this content”
---
But when I go to updates, there doesn’t seem to be anything. 
---
Probably gotta uninstall and reinstall?
---
is the biker dude bill? i cant really tell
---
For me yes. For others who dont practice and learn a lot not so
---
Just win the fucking chases lmao
---
There are A BUNCH of comments here complaining about how killers are just going to Bloodlust every unsafe pallet and score free hits on Badham.
---
Newsflash guys: Bloodlust is 15 seconds of chase. If I do that twice, once for each health state, that's 30 seconds. Ok. 30 seconds of guaranteed distracting the killer. 30 seconds doesn't sound like a lot, but that allows 3 gens to be near halfway finished. That's almost a quarter of the gens that needs to be done. And don't act like every one of you is stalling for minutes at a time. 30 seconds of getting chased would be a personal best for over half of you. 
---
Additionally, the minimum pallet distance is 8 meters. Meaning there will potentially be a double pallet loop at every other tile. If you as a survivor can't stall effectively with 15+ double pallet loops, maybe this isn't the game for you.
---
This is my point exactly, a few minor changes to balance would have at least let him keep what made him unique. Now he's just like every other killer with no originality
---
You have to hook all living Surviviors at least once before accessing the Mori
---
Doubt it
---
What I'm talking about is the current balance of the game, not how I want it to be. Did you notice the Killer flair? Obviously I don't think 2 hooks per game is how it should be.
---
The fact of the matter, is generators take 80 seconds to complete disregarding skillchecks. If a killer doesn't have ruin/pop, then 3 generators should finish by the time the fourth survivor takes their first hit. Ideally, if you have a good survivor map like Thompson House, the 4th or 5th generators should pop before the killer gets the first hook.
---
If that isn't happening, then the killer is either nurse, insta-saw hillbilly, or the survivors played badly.
---

I'll check on you in a month

I actually really like this map. No complaints.

These comments are spicy lmao

It would be awesome, but the one in the sky looks like a crop duster plane and the other looks like the inside of a much larger plane or something.
---
You gotta add spirit in their my dude.
---
The flag says nerf Freddy
---
Keys are nowhere near as OP as ebony moris. Keys are far more situational and luck based where as moris are just removing 2/3s of the game.
---
#your having fun? 
---
Impossible
---
that wouldnt Change much, unless a blendette hides in the corner all game, everyone will get hooked 9/10 games
---
Way better than local
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
dream pallets are legitimately some of the most fun i've ever had playing this game.
---
Wait, redrum doesn’t make sense. Why would the killer be rewarded for the *survivor* finishing generators while the killer is near?
---
WHAT
---
crickets
---
Brings an insta heal then assumes the Freddy is toxic. Solid.
---
Funny enough, this is the exact combo I use.  Myers for points, all put to Pig.
---
How was I being jerk? 
---
Dead hard, borrowed time, balanced landing, ds, mettle of man, object of obsession, tons of killer abilities/perks that have aura reading.
---
Hell yeah, another ace cosmetic that looks great
---
Doubt, not a chance that bill is 9 g on his own and a complete change in code for Freddy is 1 g
---
Hey look, they changed it to an icon. That's cool.
---
well they did reference a "flying" killer
---
Agreed. I love this pack, it's super cool.
---
I’m pretty sure that’s going to get a ton if backlash she has the mind of a child
---
Is not common, I haven't had many frame drops and I play the Doctor.

I'll be sure to tell myself that the next time some sweaty Billy decides to try his absolute hardest when two people DC in the time I have to get one gen done.   
---
This poor man missed out on two BBQ stacks and could only safety pip :(

---
And wraith
---
No, Fix keys ALONGSIDE your ebony.  Make it a paired rework since they're both each sides equivalent crutch.  No more nerfing survivor only first.  Hit them both simultaneously.
---
Summer Cosmetics are tied to the Summer Event (Hillbilly, Trapper, Jane and Claudette)
---
“ situational” lel.
---
The numbers weren't final though, it would be nice if we knew what was changed between PTB and live. Currently there's no way to tell
---
Bugs that favor killers and hurt survivors don't get patched out until at least 6 months had passed silly.
---
I feel like they recently made it super red, if that’s what it looks like this update they changed it...again? Or am I crazy
---
Thats because each map has a minimum number of pallets that have to spawn
---
I agree but they should at least make it a surprise so nobody goes ultra toxic
---
&gt; While activated you will be transported to the spirit world for 4/6/8 seconds and be invisible to the killer (except for spirit and wraith)
---
So both spirit and Wraith. I have less issues with wraith since he's a weak killer anyways.
---
Claudette is now automatically downed upon crouching in grass, she dies instantly if wearing any of the prestige cosmetics
---
Closing the hatch no longer powers the doors, even if there's 4 gens left, EGC is still activated. Unless you find a key have fun basically playing bomb defusal.
---
You sound very biased and hypocritical if you are going to defend one sides early escape crutch vs. The others early kills crutch.  They're like the same thing and equal amounts of cheese for both sides.
---
I always imagined they’d pull a shtick with his soul transfer spell, he says a few words and they float up into the air above him
---
That’s what I’m thinking. I took it into  a game and it’s super blonde? I liked the super red. Looks like I’m going back to brown hair lol
---
I cant tell what that is.
---
Big belly boi, killing all who try focus on cardio lol

Sorry for the bad quality!

Keep up the tweeting :)
---
The ping that is shown ingame is often very buggy! I use MLGA to see the ping even during a game. It helps a lot!
---
Huh, well I guess you're just such a prodigy when it comes to dbd.
---
I don’t disagree with you, but i just want people to stop saying, “ i got this anointing of 4k’s so that means its good!” Doesnt prove anything, and not only that, Freddy’s rework JUST came out.
---
If you play killer though it's pretty good since hex perks last 5 seconds
---
We need more maps in general, especially maps with different aesthetics. I'm getting tired of suffocation pit.
---
guess Im not playing this patch then, fuck yeah
---
Does Windows of Opportunity show fake pallets?
---
Is it doesn't then use that.
---
The same thing happened to me today
---
If a survivor is better than the others, drop the chase and try to find the weak links, kill them first. They will drop pallets faster and make it way easier for you to killer the better ones.
---
Now they just need to fix the hook auras disappearing and your controls getting randomly inverted. Unless I missed them in the patch notes.
---
If it's HD, it would only be around 2 hours of Huntress Hentai.

---
I'm saying that, as it stands, it's clear that the dash isn't what's unique about her character. The base that they made, makes it clear that they didn't put much time into the dash mechanic since it's so similar to other killers. The thing that's unique to the Pig is her traps, so obviously that's what they should develop further. We don't need another stealth movement speed killer unless they're going to make changes to the, like, four other killers that have the same mechanic. I wasn't trying to suggest that removing the bear trap is what you're hinting at, I was just poorly trying to draw you to the conclusion that the dash isn't what defines her character in any way and, furthermore, is a waste of what could've been an interesting power. I'm not trying to change your opinion, just explaining mine. Like, i think that the complete opposite of what you're saying is true: emphasis should be super super taken away from the dash, and put on the traps, because the dash was just put in because it sorta fit in with the ambush thing the canon movie Pig sometimes did, and to make her a bit more powerful due to EZ first hits, but I'm sure they can do better than that with a little more time. Make her power more terrifying, and more fitting to the chapter theme.
---
Question. When survivors are in the dream world are their repair/heal actions slowed like before?
---
I'm trying to listen for survivors, but the mist's ass cheeks are clapping too loud!
---
He is serious. And don't call him Shirley.
---
Levelling Hag to get her teachable perk Hex: Ruin is worthwhile as it’s practically a must have perk. If you have Leatherface levelling him for the BBQ &amp; Chilli perk will help you get more points so you can level faster.
---
Most of all, just keep playing and try not to get discouraged by a bad game or toxicity, the more you play the more you learn and the better you’ll get :)
---
Yeah he’s an asshole I agree.
---
I’m not bailing lmao, I have a real life to live and this conversation is going nowhere, it’s a waste of time. If this was a face to face convo I would simply say “agree to disagree” and move on. Nobody is upset, maybe you just aren’t used to people calling you out on BS. You pretend as if I don’t have an argument, but you haven’t given one valid reason as to why this isn’t still a stralth game for survivors. Your logic is beyond flawed with mentioning the aura perks... all you have is a straw-man argument with no supporting factors. Now let’s see what ridiculous response you come up with this time.
---
Thank you! As you can tell I’m not the best at actually sacrificing the survivors rn. I always manage to get a few hits on all of them and I’ve only managed to sacrifice one
---
Thanks for the advice ❤️
---
thunder cross split attack!

I’ve had 4 and an escape cake on Lery’s.  So that was fun.
---
I mean you run out of ammo at some point lol what happens when you start a chase right after you run out? And even if you do have hatchets left, you land one and you still have to be ok with being looped until you line up the next one.
---
Combined the summer skins into one poster like it's meant to be  [https://imgur.com/a/pOUWuRY](https://imgur.com/a/pOUWuRY)
---
That a sneak peek of the new elephant clown mascot cosmetic or whatever? Hard to tell but if it is, I wish it was vibrant purple.
---
I personally prefer to play as a survivor, because I like the teamwork part of it and I usually have at least 2 other friends with me, so it’s more fun to me because we can all coordinate and talk shit and all that and complain if we get placed with a killer who is specifically there to troll, which has been happening a lot lately, but my team never goes in with the intent to be obnoxious except teabagging each other just to be goofy. I have seen a bunch of survivor videos, even on here, that look like their soul purpose was to annoy the killer though.
---
&gt;Balance is definitely in this debate due to it making it easier for survivors.
---
No, balance does not say anything about how easy a side is to play. Balance assumes both sides are being played optimally, and regards instead the objective strength in game mechanics, not the potential skill of players, or skill ceiling. You will really have to stop listening stuff like insta-heals and Borrowed Time if you want to discuss skill. Killers have decidedly more stuff that is decidedly more easy to use and easy to succeed with than survivors, yet I don't bring it up here because it does not matter for the argument. Moris, Blink range add-ons, additional Blink add-ons, Prayer Beads, Father's Glasses, Iridescent Stone, Iridescent Head - these are just some of the more obvious things that make winning as killer laughably easy, much of the time.
---
&gt;tru3ta1ent, he plays kill a ton a often times points out how stupid pipping is for killer.
---
Is he red rank? If he actually cannot manage to get to red ranks, he's awful at the game, sorry. If he can, then where is the issue, even to someone that does care about ranks?
---
&gt;Having a constant line of sight that most loops provide certainly makes it easier
---
Yes, but does not take away the depth there is to chaseplay between good players even then. Again, pallet play is more nuanced than you seem to grasp, and that's even ignoring killer abilities altogether.
---
&gt;optimal loop pathing just comes from practice.
---
Optimal loop pathing is a skill, but it's just one of a variety of things involved in chaseplay, and I pointed it out only and precisely because it is one of the bare essentials on simple loops play, yet something I only seldomly see survivors be really good at. Let alone then also being able to control their camera well while doing so, pathing having become second-nature. It's a basic skill, yet something apparently difficult enough that it is not a very common skill to have been mastered by players, from my (extensive) experience.
---
&gt;Sure better killers make the survivors have to be more efficient but not more skilled. All it means is that they need to minimize risk to stay alive longer
---
In order to say alive longer against better killers, survivors literally need skills, is the point.
---
To humor your list:
---
&gt;dead hard
---
Dead Hard is certainly a strong perk, but requires skill to use well. Oftentimes survivors get next to no use out of it, because they don't know or are unable to use it in beneficial ways. You can see the players on the streams I've pointed out make fun of the perk, because more often than not the survivors they face are not good at using it. And then Dead Hard is also susceptible to latency, and therefore unreliable in close-call situations, it being that latency favors killers outright.
---
&gt;insta heals
---
Insta-heals are definitely busted, but it's not like you will see them a lot. Nor is it that killers don't have their share of busted stuff, such as insta-down add-ons.
---
&gt;tons of pallets and loops
---
Yes, literal chase assets that are required to play the game, on which the killer can also outplay survivors, and vice-versa. That's the quality of those game elements. To speak to the quantity, some maps do still spawn too many pallets, but the majority of maps has a good enough budget now (and some too little pallets), to where a survivor using pallets inefficiently (which a good killer can force a survivor to) will absolutely lose them the game later on, creating deadzones that result in inevitable downs.
---
&gt;flashlights to blind them
---
Flashlights are hardly an issue anymore, and can be played around in many or most scenarios.
---
&gt;adrenaline to heal you if you’re hit and get you way the hell away
---
You can't rely on Adrenaline as a safety net because it only triggers once, at a point you can regularly not control yourself. And again, the existence of Adrenaline does not diminish the skill ceiling of survivor gameplay, just like NOED does not do for the killer side. Most perks do not require any particular skill to use.
---
&gt;borrowed time and decisive to force them to switch targets thus wasting more time attempting to down yet another looper.
---
You can play around these perks in ways both direct and indirect. They are meant to counter killer tactics that the devs have also identified to be too oppressive to survivor gameplay, namely camping and tunnelling. They do not destroy those tactics, but offer respite.
---
Again, this list of things is not really relevant to the argument. Yes, perks/items/add-ons make the game easier, help with certain gameplay scenarios or interactions. They are designed to do so, and killers also have their share of such things. Most of them, for both sides, require little skill to use. Both sides also have busted things, which I would also like to see be toned down. Speaking to the skill required to play the game however, we cannot consider these things, because both side or neither side can or cannot be using any of them. I'm arguing using an insta-heal Med-Kit requires skill, but there is an entire game worth of stuff that does require skill.
---
&gt;Pipping is most definitely counted as a win since that is the end competitive goal, to get to rank one.
---
Then why do people still play once they are rank one? Have they not won the game, then? No. If you really think the competition of this games ends at achieving rank 1, we just have completely different concepts of what "succeeding" means in this game, and if you want to base your idea of "skill required to succeed" upon that idea, then this discussion is completely irrelevant to me.
---
&gt;500 milliseconds is plenty of reaction time. Have you ever played For Honor where you have to parry 300 millisecond attacks while dealing with server lag? That takes skill and timing.
---
I said below 500ms, which is where the usual realm of "fast reactions" begins. Fun fact: survivors have to deal with lag in this game, killers do not (yet).
---
&gt;Faking a window does not require skill, you literally just run at it and don’t vault and hope they miss.
---
That is where your understanding of the game is not sufficient to understand the skill involved. You don't just commit to the vault or not and hope the killer goes the other way. You watch for what the killer does (who can also fake direction), and then react to their action, delaying your decision as much as possible, having then to react as fast as possible. For example, you run at a window, while looking behind yourself to see what the killer is doing. You get the vault prompt, but do not actuate it. Now there's a time window of actions that happen in the 100s of milliseconds, where the killer will fake and/or eventually commit to a side, and the survivor can either play for a fast vault, run away from the window, stand at the window, or play on a medium/slow vault. Fast reactions help succeed in these scenarios, achieving delayed fast vaults or at least still getting an early-enough medium vault in, or going for a silent vault as a mindgame, as well as a weighing of ups and downs of either action, given the larger context of the tile setup, health state, prior chase interactions, killer ability, perks, and so on. Decision-making processes and physical reactions happening in the range of 100-500 milliseconds. Skilled gameplay interactions 101.
---
&gt;not pipping which is the goal for most, despite you not caring.
---
Again, if this is really all about pips for you, then we have fundamentally conflicting views of the competitive objectives in this game, and our discussion about the extent of skill involved in achieving them is irrelevant to me.
---
You said killer takes skill and thought. Does that not mean you think as a killer, you can outplay ("outskill", "outthink") survivors? Does that in turn not mean survivors also need skill and thought, since if they lack them, a killer can outplay them? You said survivor is easy because you don't win as killer. Is it not that I could say killer is easy, because other people win as killer all the time? If both sides are easy, is that not a logical contradiction? In reality, as with most PVP multiplayer games, the difficulty to win depends reciprocally on the respective other side, the skill required to win, likewise.

Yikes. I just realized I’m “arguing” with a 16 year old. How embarrassing. Alright kiddo, I gotta go “for realz” this. Peace ✌️

I totally agree. Also , this might be an unpopular opinion but I'd want a Rob Zombie Michael outfit as well.

---
I personally think it should only work on survivors that are on death hook. Your idea is nice too.
---
Sadly I'm on console :(
---
Here's the scenario that has happened to me numerous times that I will put forth to counter that.  You killed 2 survivors.  There are 2 gens left still needing to be done and the survivors have hopelessly 3 genned themselves with no chance of getting the final gens done against you.  You got them exactly where you want them they cannot win this.  Ooooops they had a key annnnnnd they'reeeeeee outttttt.
---
As long as they honor my refund I guess they can do what they want. 
---
Personally I love this game because it's not Friday the 13th. Not being able to communicate is what makes this game challenging and fun for me. Friday quickly became a who can crack the lamest jokes contest and ruined the "horror" experience. It wasn't scary, it was lame. 
---
I rather not be subjected to squeakers and assholes at all.
---
I dunno maybe he let go to soon or his mouse bugged out. I'm not saying he wasn't bming it's just that it doesn't help to jump to conclusions. Could've just called it a close escape.

But what does it matter what I think, everyone is down voting anyway, let's not have a discussion. /s

Level 20 and still dont have sloppy butcher );

You find a locker to refill
---
Welp, guess we know to buff it. Could also work for Doctor too.
---
Will do!
---
Ohh okay gotcha. Sorry about that then.
---
Right? I wasn’t sure what to expect from this sub, but after joining I’ve noticed that it seems to be mostly killers promoting toxic behavior and complaining about complaining, with the occasional decent post or wholesome killer video where the game glitches and they help the survivor find the hatch or something.
---
 How does that change prevent an insta-down on an exposed survivor?
---
Next time you should learn to not just tunnel 2 survivors right off the bat and be more varied with how many you hook.
---
Then there should have been a few mechanic changes and survivor perk nerfs. Freddy did not need a complete overhaul.
---
Console
---
think he means how the art looks compared to in game
---
I don't have a video off the top of my head, there ARE videos out there from streamers with Bamboozle, but some of them are very long (30 minutes) and clicking through some of them doesn't seem to reveal any particularly good examples (if any of them).
---
I was mostly talking from knowledge (the perk description) and experience (I've run it a few times).
---
Would you like to a KYF with me? If you're on PC you can run killer/survivor and try it out and see, just private message me with your Steam name/profile link.
---
Oooh
---
Hag. Ruin is one of the best perks in the game. She herself can be pretty fun too.
---
I like how there were tons of posts about Legion mains demanding a refund because they didn't like how Legion was being changed, but Freddy mains are told to just "suck it up." I'm really sensing the bias here.
---
Not only that but being able to fake it makes Freddy a gen protecting beast.
---
Samination is awesome

Awesome thanks

Starting killers on PC are Trapper, Hillbilly, Wraith, Nurse, Huntress.
---
Non-Licensed killers (Everybody but Myers, Leatherface, Freddy, Pig (SAW) and Ghostface) can be grinded for via shards.
---
Base game killers are good in terms of viability. Billy and Nurse are top tier killers, although I find some of the weaker killers more fun to play, especially Doctor.
---
Great...
---
Lol how is this what you gathered from that?  Who said word one about tunneling?  How did that even pop into your head based on what I said?  I don't tunnel anyone dude.  I hook leave to patrol gens and chase a new survivors.  I typically 3 hook my survivors and constantly switch targets.  Eventually some die lol.  How the fuck does anything about the situation I put forth make me a tunneler?  My brain actually hurts from attempting to follow your line of logic.  This just sounds like someone that crutches it out with keys often and can't be bothered to offer back an actual response of substance.
---
This happened to me too.
---
The issue is that it doesn't accentuate skill for either side. It's just boring.
---
Dedicated servers are going to be crap if they keep the limited number of servers they have.  2 servers for all of NA.  Southern U.S. players and Canadian players are totally hosed.  Central American players are stuck between those servers and Brazil.  Not sure how Eastern Europe is going to be covered.  Aussies are going to have crap ping too.  Winter 2019 would be a blessing if it meant they wouldn't be rolling out crap servers for most people.
---
Yeah I still think bloodlust is a godsend for huntress lol I don't think you'll change my mind on that one. Hatchets are still a challenge to land on the tighter loops.
---
So killers have franklins, and they can close the hatch even if its opened by a key. 
---
What counterplay is there to a mori?
---
i just dead harded a hit last game
---
True. Actually not so much "lucky", but more like some people can be good because they deranked or something.
---
Yes dead hard fails me maybe 6/10 times. But you still get exhausted. Worst of both worlds.
---
Reset the Xbox
---
They have in the past releases 4 outfits at once (Pig and Tapp) so it's likely.
---
Jesus Christ
---
Ok, at first I was disappointed about Hillbilly's cosmetic, but he looks cute in this image, I'm going to buy it.
---
BIG BELLY BOI
---
To be fair sometimes there’s a delay between that message and the updates actually coming to  Xbox, happened to me a couple of times.
---
Once again you don't even say why I'm a 16 yo. It's not so serious if someones snarky at you. Thats life. Don't get that upset :) Have a nice evening/day :)
---
Yup BBQ only stacks to 2 now :(
---
i don’t think luck have a hard cap, but most only offer 1-4% increased chance, which is only used to determine chance to kobe off hook, there’s really no need for hard cap, unlike mist.
---
Yea I did make one exactly like this one lmao
---
No i don't think I will
---
Imagine thinking keys are stronger than moris
---
Hi, can someone from the xbox players tell me the new achievements in the game please?
---
Oh interesting! Thanks for the heads up
---
Hey look more killer whataboutism
---
It is...
---
It don’t display bonus blood points but you still get the bonus blood points from BBQ
---
Sorry but that would be beyond broken. Make it so that it can only be cleansed at 2 tokens. Thats where stuff starts to happen. Killers having a chance to one hit people and no way to counter it is beyond broken and op
---
I'm going to love this as Survivor, but it's honestly going to take some getting used to from a Killer standpoint. It desperately needed patching, but goddamn was it a bit of a crutch.
---
Yes! Here is my link https://www.twitch.tv/trickstershadow

More like Dwight Yamaoka
---
Personally I think the Hags design is by far my favorite. I’ve always been a huge fan of twisted and evil looks and the way her body looks like it’s made of mud and twigs disfigured and brought to life is just super cool to me
---
They reverted it back. Im pissed i liked the red too
---
F
---
It’s happened to me at least eight times by now. That’s pretty fucking common.
---
Am I crazy or is something shiny coming out of his pants???
---
I agree about the argument being pointless but just to throw my point out there, I do believe a insane spirit player beats an insane billy player anyday, I just think there’s more ways to loop a billy than a spirit, both are insanely good though, not hating on either.
---
Summer event, when?
---
I agree bloodlust is still imperfect but I don't think it should be affected by snares. They don't even effect awake survivors so most of the time they are useless until after first hit and even then they are most useful for cutting off loops so ideally bloodlust doesn't even come into play.
---
the killer wasnt able to hear her humming while playing i think
---
Nah it was different than that, it wasn't like I got exhausted on the ground I didn't go down I just got exhausted and shit
---
I love stories like this, since the toxicity on both sides has been making me not want to play the game. I have a clip on my PS4 of a Legion who was stabbing my teammate on a hook after the other two left. I waited for his attack cooldown to pull them off the hook, took a hit, and we both escaped. It was so satisfying.
---
; ) It's a butterfly knife
---
Suitable
---
I think youre missing my point. You literally cant cleanse that totem, its to far in to even give you the prompt at the bottom of the screen!
---
Well it was good while it lasted
---
Nah intitute is good but i do agree with swamp tho
---
Don't respect pallets too much. Getting stunned sucks, but you'll end chases way faster if you are ballsy. If survivors pick up on you being afraid of pallets they can loop you all day without having to do anything.
---
A+ comment
---
then perish
---
I think Ruin is fine, and don't personally have an issue with it. Especially if you're good at hitting greats. I understand that a lot of people have a hard time hitting the greats though, so maybe as an alternative to giving killers better perks they could maybe change it to where if you have a toolbox ruin won't be activated as long as you're using that to fix the gen. It'll nullify ruin, but not grant an increase in speed (tradeoff.) I think that could balance the hex, and it also forces the survivor, and killer to think about what they're bringing in to a match instead of just running the same things. 
---
But like I said I don't really mind it so if it doesn't change I'm okay with that.
---
Errrrgh something always breaks, and it broke last time as well.
---
it's okay if you're playing killer, as a survivor... not so much
---
Oh god oh heck Meg is wearing her AirPods^TM oh god oh heck the Trapper is right behind her oh god she can’t hear us oh heck
---
You are actually losing A LOT of BP by staying in a match where the killer is holding you hostage. It’s unfortunate, but you should probably just leave and cut your losses instead of staying in hopes that the killer gets bored and lets you go. Better to just get into your next match and start earning bp again.
---
I don’t think it needs a buff. It’s ok as it is, it doesn’t need to counter Freddy
---
There really are some nasty spawn points in badham. I still don't like the map, but I'll hate it way less as killer just because of this
---
I love it lmao
---
How do you know?
---
... we need feng cosmetics...
---
Had a similar situation with a survivor  who wanted me to end them, I refused and kept body blocking the exit gates so they couldn’t start endgame, not for long obviously wasn’t trying to be toxic, eventually she just accepted and took the hatch, 
---
Then messaged me saying “ggez”
---
It still keeps me up at night.
---
Wait seriously. Wtf!
---
Thank you for the advice I’ll remember it ❤️❤️
---
when i read her bio i thought she sounded the least evil of the killers. swear she doesnt even kill anyone in her lifetime, just try to heal people
---
It is actually really simple. Get points to either de rank/stay the same/or move up. Its tied to what you do during the match so the goal is to get as many points as possible, escaping is also good. 
---
Same as the killer except hooking a couple players is good.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cgx49c/were_gonna_live_forever_is_bugged_doesnt_give/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
When a killer hooks a survivor and stands right in front of or near the hook basically camping the survivors face. Thus the name
---
I like to imagine a Wreck It Ralph scenario between the killers and survivors. When your not playing the game they're just hanging out with each other.
---
I don't understand why you typed that..  holding the game hostage like this is absolutely bannable
---
Hope so cause I need both them Claudette and Jane outfits !
---
This happened to me during the PTB, i thought it would be fixed.
---
Ps does anyone have a high resolution of this pic ?
---
Nope, without slugging certain perks would be completely redundant.
---
The evil comes from her extreme god complex. Once she accepts the role of high priest, she begins to see others as beneath her and not worthy of life. The rituals she performs are only done to further her own agenda, and she does not actually intend for them to help or heal anyone. When a literal god itself approached her with an offer, this is what pushed her extreme god complex over the limit, believing she was worthy enough to commune with god and to follow its orders
---
knockout, third seal, deer hunter
---
I was wondering why I wasn’t getting as much bloodpoints my previous games. I need me double bloodpoint gains 😭😡
---
New update made a glitch where dead hard makes you stand still while giving invincibility and no boost so oof
---
You can change your invert controls button in the controller config.
---
Slugging is so boring and limits bp for everyone, but if that’s your style then go for it.
---
That would be a cool Trapper counter if you could pick up his traps instead of breaking them. Drop your item to steal one of his traps. Maybe you just drop it when he smacks you too
---
Entity: Really?! Right in front of my hook?!
---
Adept Bill, self explanatory, left behind complete the least gen and escape though the gate, needs a rework that’s never gonna happen honestly, and the last name escaped me but it’s takes 250 protection hits.
---
If you stare long enough into the abyss... the abyss will stare into you.

Slated for Summer/Fall
---
Next time someone says this to you, tell them it's countered with No Mither.
---
It's been there
---
Yes!! I’ve been asking for this since I started playing the game, someone should make a fake character load out for him and his perks and force it upon BH, just so they consider it...
---
Doctor is my anti-SWF killer. Sometimes I feel bad when I bring meat plant offering, irridescent king with the add-on that increase the therapy range by 75%, with Surveillance, ruin, franklin’s (if everybody has an item i. Otherwise i BBQ), and overcharge. But i do like a challenge every now and then
---
yeah so is gen rushing but sure
---
Oh shit i didnt even notice that until you showed it
---
Isn't 7 already out, you think they'll be on sale?
---
or, yknow, unbreakable?
---
Gen rushing is not a thing it’s called doing the objective. Be a better killer and cause map pressure. The only time gen rushing was a thing was with brand new part.
---
Keep dreaming
---
Typical bill.
---
if you have fun by ruining other people's fun that's not my problem, I always play fair and still manage to 4k. I have fun knowing I didn't potentially ruin someones fun.
---
but to each their own.
---
They do it perfectly regardless of what I do, literally the first thing I try is in their minds apparently. For every time I have the “instantly found early match” situation occur, regardless of what rank they, regardless of their chosen killer, regardless of perks, regardless of literally everything you can think of
---
They perfectly predict the very first action I perform.
---
yeah but everyone ends up with 3k bp so if your problem is low blood points then...
---
You do still get the points, it's just a visual issue. We're looking into it.
---

Lmao We got Freddy updated, I could care less about getting another free skin named Bill when I’ve got all the perks on another character already.

People have literally been banned for it on here already

Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Perk not working as intended
---
Description: We're Gonna Live Forever does not award bonus bloodpoints post-trial
---
Screenshot / Video: n/a
---
Steps to reproduce: Go into a game with WGLF, see if you get bonus bloodpoints post-trial
---
Expected result: At the screen where bloodpoints are awarded, no post-game bonus of 0.25*(number of stacks) is awarded
---
Actual result: Received no bonus BP
---
Reproduction rate: Played 3 games, awarded no bonus BP on all 3 occasions (Had 1, 2 and 4 stacks of WGLF)
---
System Specs (PC only): Not sure how it'd be relevant for this type of bug as I assume BP is handled server-side
---
Thank you for the advice!!! Someone else told me to level up Hag for ruin and I just got my first all 4 sacrifice so I’m pretty happy rn! 
---
Just gotta keep grinding!
---
Single digit amount of hours and judging a game
---
Why is this stuff not posted in the news section on Steam? I don't get it.
---
I’m not gonna lie... I didn’t even know the clown was in that banner until now
---
Any theories about that green haired corpse ripped in half in the background?
---
ok but real talk in what fucking situation are you gonna be slugged TWICE or more.
---
No Mither really really needs a buff. Probably more than anything else. I was thinking that maybe it also half’s all debuff timers and doubles all buff timers. maybe that would give you a reason to use it. maybe also quicker vault speeds or something super op
---
I’ve already tried them and I really hated every moment so I probably won’t play them often but eh thanks anyway!
---
The nurse one should have a bunch of disconnect symbols on it too, people love to rage vs her
---
To shit up your bloodwebs, I think.
---
In theory thick mist might be slightly better for the survivors, but it depends on who the killer is, which you can't know when choosing your offering. And both survivors and killers get both mist thickeners and thinners in their bloodwebs, so I return to my original argument.
---
I almost only play solo queue myself. I still consider everyone my teammate and do what’s in the best interest for the team in almost every circumstance. 
---
I’m not afraid to sacrifice myself for randos
---
ww2 killer when bhvr
---
The first thing I do in these events? Perfectly predicted by every. Damn. Killer. Every. Time.
---
Chose to stay on that side of the window/pallet? Predicted first time perfectly.
---
Chose to hop to the other side? Predicted first time perfectly.
---
Chose literally anything else? Predicted. First time. Perfectly.
---
Every game I’ve been getting 4 stacks but no bonus bloodpoints, it’s really frustrating
---
Lol it’s not like people use the ambush attack anyway, people just exit crouch and basic attack.
---
I don't find the dash fun in any way shape or form. To me, it makes the killer feel like a watered down version of other killers. I know I keep drawing comparisons to the other killers similarities but I still feel like that entirely kills her dash power, it's not even that helpful, it's so much better to stand up when they're close to either grab or stab. 
---
I guess you're right about the traps not being interactive enough, but they should definitely fix the traps rather than focusing on the dash. If they left the traps the way they were and instead worked on what seems like a pointless part of her power, it would pretty much make the Pig just another mid tier killer that doesn't have much going for her. So many other killers have ways to break loops. So many other killers have BETTER DASHES already. But no other killer can make it so that a survivor can die just by doing gens with no action on their part. It's plainly and simply what makes the Pig the Pig and not just a worse Wraith, in my book. 
---
And with that note, if you're still convinced that they should just work on the dash mechanic, I give up, and I won't try and reply anymore, for I'm totes tires of repeating the same thing over and over.
---
Iron Maiden is from a killer who hiding in a locker is the absolute dumbest idea to try. 
---
Dark Devotion is from a killer with no ability to apply any natural effects to their terror radius. 
---
BBQ and Chili is from a killer who’s play date plummets after unlocking it.
---
That’s an awful idea. If that was implemented it would practically be a necessity for both sides unless you want to try and run from a killer moving at 130% speed while you’re at base 100% or chasing a survivor at 115% while playing Hag or Huntress with your pitiful 110% or god forbid a nurse with her mockingly low 96.25%. Don’t get me wrong your idea is creative and an interesting concept but it would be a massive pain to balance
---
Git good
---
Similar thing happened toe yesterday this doctor downed me closed the hatch in my face then went suprised Pikachu when adrenaline popped he lost me I opened a exit gate and taunted him before I left then he had the nerve to call me toxic
---
We’re still doing these “survivors bitch about everything” posts? Killers and survivors bitch all the fucking time can we stop having this us vs them mentality please it’s exhausting
---
It says sale on the pic lol
---
Youtube 3 gen strategy and start having fun
---
It was devour tho :(
---
Sometimes the animation just doesn't go off. U get the hit immunity for a short window but don't gain any distance.

There are hints in the files of a summer sale, something like ["up to 75% off select outfits"](https://github.com/jesterret/DBDPakTrack/blob/65feec7cf9b033b1120889b091f497dab98e14e2/DeadByDaylight/Content/Data/StoreBannersDB.uasset#L776-L777).
---
Honestly was expecting him to turn around, stalk and down that other survivor. Love a Good-time Ghosty.
---
They didn't have to make the Plgaue's banner look like a seductress but they sure did.
---
yep, they need to tweak some bugged Spots.
---
Dont understand the other comments
---
Do you have a better idea?
---
Tbh if I get looped for more than minute I’ll just move on to the next gen. If they’re not doing gens and just trying to loop you take this as practice time, or play a killer with better loop ending potential such as nurse, spirit, or huntress.
---
Read it again dumbass. I’m saying everyone gets the speed boost you illititrate fuck.
---
I did. I even posted it there before posting it here
---
It’s a very rare, it should be strong.  It’s not like he’d be hillbilly or spirit tier with it
---
What the fuck are you saying
---
The need something to slow down gen progression
---
No he needs no nerf, he's well balanced. And dream pallets is the most hilarious thing in this game. Watching a streamer use them right now and laughning my ass off xD
---
Sprint burst.
---
press X/A and then move the right analogue stick.
---
Its been less then 2 hours maybe your just bad and havent gotten used to it?
---
Many thanks will try it
---
wow, someone seems to be on a Short fuze
---
agreed "pretty Good job so far"
---
wouldnt that be completly useless?
---
No, but that’s why i’m not designing games and BHVR is
---
I don’t know about nerfing them but some adjustments should definitely be made. Maybe if they made it to where the aura reading was only in the ultra rare add on?
---
lmao what??
---
Figured this would be the replies I get. I stand by it dream pallets need a counter.
---
The other survivor cosmetics maybe?
---
I mean if you want a specific niche perk like windows to counter it then use small game, it procs on fake pallets
---
It's me
---
New Feng cosmetic lol
---
As a rank 8 killer main, i can be on both sides here, i cry and bitch and they whine and bitch so its a lose lose situation with this one
---
wait how do you not realize this is an early escape? so if i’ve killed 2 people and 3 gens are done, i have a very good chance of getting 3 people or all 4 but someone uses a key to open the hatch and they leave. now making it so i’ve gotten 2 people and they’ve got to escape. keys are very strong considering they are popping up more often than normal it seems
---
Well by nerf I just mean a counter. It just seems like they over reacted and gave him everything lol.  Other than that I'd say they did a pretty good job so far lol.
---
With OoO you can see the player's aura outside of terror radius (he's very close, so that's not the case) - In this case the only thing you can see is the trap that bugged and was still attached to his leg (you can see it traps through walls)
---
Its a good desgin thats why its used alot. Forcing survivors to stop working on gens is the point
---
it would make chases more fun and fast paced i guess. imo offerings shouldn’t offer an in game advantage, (moris apart from last survivor are bullshit, maps don’t really count) if it just changed things up without giving one side an advantage woudnt that be better?
---
counter play is using your eyes or using windows
---
I was hoping they’d change the garbage ZBlock addon and the useless percentages from swing chains (Max 10% debuff if ALL survivors are asleep) but at least they didn’t nerf him.
---
That only applies for unintentional spelling/grammar mistakes.  
---
Now, I'm not angry that you don't know about purbel/purble; I'm just disappointed.
---
Small game is worthless against it I've tried. Like I said he gets 10 pallets and scatters them all over so small game just goes off non stop. Windows should absolutely counter it in my opinion.
---
Yeah that’s fair. I couldn’t really think of a better mechanic either. Just curious if you may have
---
yeah but isn’t there other ways? i’m not saying to remove it, but maybe change things up
---
nah the worse is when theres no ruin and someone goes ahead and someone still does the totem
---
Ace is about to dive bomb the killers.
---
Just level up Adam. He’s worth the other two perks and he’s a free character.  Ever Shrine the free characters.
---
it's not hard
---
i mean most killers get weaker based on how skilled survivors are. i’d say the only 2 that really don’t at all are nurse and spirit.
---
Like doctors snap out of it or the legion mend is any better? But i would honestly perfer the alarm and the saw trap then that.
---
Bloodlust bad for stopping loops? Are you serious? It's literally the bad killer's counter to loops lol
---
I mean ok but in that case then there’s no point. You’d be playing the exact same game just a bit sped up at times
---
My point there is that he is just assuming Freddy is toxic. And I'm of a mind to get rid of all one shots and second chances so. Just cus one thing is broken doesn't mean we need more broken shit to balance it. Fucking ridiculous.
---
Ahh counter play is just don't use one of the only things you have to use against killers? Wow such insight. You are biased if you don't think there should be a legit counter for it.
---
Me too.
---
See you next weekend bro
---
Oh sorry. I thought  Purbel was a unintentional spelling  error
---
Sure, a -50% speed debuff because that just feels so much better right? 
---
Hell in the case of Plague and Freddy they aren't evne required to use.
---
Meg,Claud, Dwight, and David etc have plenty?
---
For starters a simple thing would be for the Skill Checks on Self Heal to count as Survival points. It not makes sense that they count as Altruism anyway. So you could gain almost x1.5 points from heals since 2-3 skill checks are common. They could also adjust the Heal points to 500 like they did with Healing others.
---
not necessarily take away the places, but maybe do something more interesting, for example, pig you can either take long amounts of time or be broken/exhausted/blind for 1 minute.
---
freddy maybe go somewhere to get a “dream key” and take it to your wake up thingy
---
Yea also true
---
Awesome
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
who is that with the axe and armor
---
Ahhh the typical reply. Yes of course I'm just bad, why didn't I think of that. Stupid reply why even bother?
---
See you next month mate
---
Release 7 is multiple collections put together. It can only be a special sale.
---
Hopefully they will make these skins purchasable with Iridescent Shards for limited time but it could also be discount for Auric Cells. 
---

---
I mean Jane is Holding a Cocktail and the Summer BBQ Generators were Cocktail Machines so it’s a good possibility that this could be for the Summer BBQ
---
not necessarily, maybe keep the places but not just to make it another m1 objective. pig you can either take a long time searching, or get a debuff. maybe with freddy you can get a “dream key” from somewhere and put it in the dream thingy
---
They suggested Spirit and Nurse because they are two of the strongest Killers in the game. Not all Killer powers are equal and you might have a harder time with certain Killers against certain Survivors.
---
That said, ignore them and anyone else who tells you to play or not play specific characters and just play whoever **you** enjoy playing.
---
Dream Pallets do have a counter: Learn to remember where the real pallets are. 
---
Also the Snares are much stronger.
---
HAHA guess neither side is worth playing
---
I’d love this, because at least in the movie, he/the killer gets defeated because the kid/survivor backtracks on their trail to juke him. It’s perfect.
---
 Maybe as the game goes on he’s able to see trails/scratch marks for longer and longer until he has no idea what he’s looking at because it’s a red mess.
---
*s h i t p o s t*
---
I’m doing it. Fuck it
---
I tried. It happens during the match. I've tried changing it but I have to close the game to have it revert back.
---
can you not read? you might want to go back to school, i said have a nice day. 🤣🙄
---
Why thank you good sir. It is my pride and joy to bring you such intense emotions that you spit frozen dairy treats
---
Eh, I really don't like how long the take to set up. Trapper is one thing because at least his traps have a high reward for using well. I wouldn't mind the snare if you didn't have to channel them to place for potentially nothing.
---
Im a survivor main and whenever i go to play killer i hold shift and try to start sprinting at the beginning.
---
i’m not saying that it would, i’m just saying that it would be more tense if you’re not lightly jogging away from a power walking killer
---
Some people just choose flair.
---
It would be faster so you would need to think a lot quicker. His idea is good.
---
Nope just salty, "Mad cause bad"
---
you could practice on kill ur friends, then its more casual unless ur friends are dicks, in which case dont.
---
&gt; or let windows of opportunity counter it
---
small game activates on dream pallets
---
now stop whining
---
how would this be for survivors??
---
Goes off non stop so it doesn't help. If he had less than 10 pallets that can instantly be replaced maybe it would be a counter.
---
I got hit with that, but escaped due to the killer feeling bad that 2 people dc :/
---
oh and i like how you’re going to call me a dirty mongrel when you have literally called yourself that in your bio. 🤣🤣🤣🤡 have a nice day.
---
You can’t memorize the entire maps pallets, especially if you were working on gens while your teammates wasted them
---
carpal tunnel is the real killer here lol
---
Excessive squinting.
---
Yeah, you are right. Compare other hated/super strong purple addons like Prayer Beads for Spirit (Removes phasing sound), infantry belt for huntress (2 extra hatchets) Tombstone Piece (One Mori per EW3) and the infamous Scratched Mirror (32m aura reveal but locked in EW1) for Myers, Doctor's "Carter's Notes" addon series (Souped up versions of his various other addons) etc. and Freddy's purples are not amazing (he has a few decent ones) but Z-Block in particular is really underwhelming.
---
Whats your killer rank, cuz I play on PS4 also
---
I’m just a farming Dwight, I’m meant to be expendable.
---
Killer: Not to me..
---
I found it best to start it up before I get to where I wanna place it. Nothing wrong with holding the button down looking like your about to punch someone
---
(Circus theme plays)
---
i got jebaited by fake pallets so many times. I love it
---
Well screw you too.
---
Myers. He tears off his shirt and GhostFace eyes melt out of his head through his mask as if staring at the ark of the covenant.
---
Small game goes of non stop and also activates on totems. It is not a legit counter. Now stop being a douche bag.
---
They kill when they want lmao
---
It wasn't condescending, just assumed you weren't very high rank due to that claim. Kinda like someone saying they found a thousand of money, you kinda doubt it but he did find a thousand. Though it was thousand yen.
---
Nea man
---
sodium chloride levels*
---
When was that?  A flying killer would be awesome
---
You just stated a fact (Freddy  just being released) he calls you "Bias" Haha what a lser
---
When i hear key i would assume for a hatch and would you put dream key there it confuses me, i thought you were referring to a dream hatch just the wording was weird sorry.
---
all thats needed would be an animation change
---
ITT a bunch of killers triggered by insta-heals and moris. 
---
How many games do you guys play where keys are used? I feel like i can count on one hand the number of key hatch escapes ive played against in the last 6 months.
---
hahaha
---
It is because they don't know how to make a game.
---
20 now because I haven't played killer for the last few months. 🙄
---
That's how I started. Don't care for the horror genre but I seen Ghostface trending on YouTube and was like "Why is he Trending? This doesn't seem like a movie." 
---
That led to me discovering the game and doing some research and buying it.
---
Right so I'm supposed to know which pallets have been used and replaced on the other side of the map? Lmao the killer bias is real.
---
don't let them reach the 1st box, use knock out and carry them to a corner of the map to waste as much time as possible
---
as in like you go somewhere, get an object, take it to the dream wake up thingy, and you wake up, instead of just m1 for 3 seconds
---
Death is not an escape
---
How did you get it so high quality?
---
So they don’t actually stand their ground and submit a report to steam?
---
wah i dont like this solution cater to meeeeeee
---
No it’s not been playing on that map all day the pallets are fine your just not good at mindgaming
---
Oh that’s great to know. I didn’t pay attention to my BP total but i’ll take your word for it.
---
You fall asleep every minute. You can't memorize pallets on the other side of the map. There's no way to know which pallets have been used and replaced. They need tweaked.
---
Yup. I consider us both trash. You are just as bad as me!
---
I actually bought all the killers....? fuck budgets tho.
---
O O F 😫
---
that would be a huge problem, but maybe they could just speed up the jogging animation/ slow down the sprint. and for killers just make them have the equivalent of PWIF With 3 ticks
---
But did she ass you back?
---
Yeah 😂
---
Wahh I'm a bad killer and can't catch survivors without uncounterable powers cater to meeee. See how stupid you sound? Douche.
---
I don t wanna be toxic but those guys deserve facecamp
---
literally crying that it's too helpful. fucking amazing
---
It's been two weeks
---
What does it even matter let them send useless reports and eventually they will get a penalty for sending false reports. If you didn't do anything wrong you shouldn't be worried
---
Would love it, I didn’t see ur work in the past so idk if u already done this but a doc one would be awsome
---
Who’s skin is the second one?  The axe holding one
---
If survivors know which ones are fake then this power is literally useless
---
Etovpu = giP
---
lmfao what are you even talking about
---
Is Meg turning more into a Miguel?
---
And then they leave because mlga told them it was you because they tagged you for some asinine reason.
---
Yes ;)
---
I was just curious what goes on through their minds. I never knew about that false report system thats neat
---
Literally to stupid to read. If a perk is constantly going off it provides no real data. Am I near a totem or a dream pallet? Fucking amazing how stupid you are.
---
why is meg literally so buff.
---
Ya cause freddy is a short boy. So compare a trapper lunging at you vs freddy, they have the same hitbox but clearly trapper is like twice freddy's size so they gotta make up for it somewhere, and i'l take those gaps anyday over them messing with hitboxes and giving some killers a reach advantage over others
---
use small game
---
Are you a financial advisor by any chance?
---
I got so many 4ks I started letting one person every match live. I love new freddy
---
This is why i kill them all
---
Dope. Which console are you on?
---
Xbox one
---
&gt; The problem with this rework is it punishes solo queue players. Swf can just call out fake pallets and what pallets have been used.
---
I feel like this forum sometimes over estimate SWF's communication skills. I mean sure some of it can be done "hey i just dropped the god pallet", or "i just dropped the pallet in the main building", but overall it can't all be communicated.
---
you wouldnt. You get faster to safe loops, the Killer teaches you faster. Its wouldnt Change anything
---
Lmao you just said top kek unironically. What an edgy teenager you must be. Small game is not a counter. I'm done arguing with morons like you with no point to make. Good job on making libs cry you edgelord lmfao.
---
So many bugs with this patch
---
Damn and with dying light too?
---
it's not constantly going off. you're just an over-dramatic shitstain
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question but are cosmetics always released weekly? Like Freddy rework and a plauge skin came out today, so does that mean Jane and Claud are out next week, followed by Meg and Clown(?) in 2 weeks? It's my first time being around when new skins are releasing so Im a bit lost, I was hyped to get the Jane skin but it wasn't there in game today.
---
Wait a minute you looked at my profile? Why?
---
I approve of your flair
---
dear god you are the most mad piece of shit ever
---
It is constantly going off, you are just an edgy douche bag. Fuck off back to mommy's basement douche.
---
Saaame. Survivor main. Kill me, bro!
---
wat?
---
“Use a counter perk? Lol no. Get it nerfed.” - Random Survivor Main
---
With the new Freddy rework that should be a breeze
---
&gt;Billy has a crazy powerful kit with 0 downside.
---
Not exactly, he might mage great mobility and an insta down but he can still be looped by good survivors. 
---
If Billy is chasing a survivor around a pallets it's all gonna be about the survivors skill, not Billy's. He can't do anything against a survivor that's good at looping and has access to a pallet
---
Spirit, on the other hand, can mindgame pallets a lot better and also has great mobility. If a good survivor goes against a good Spirit, the Spirit is going to win. 
---
Nurse is just broken
---
Dear God you are the dumbest motherfucker ever. Why don't you hit with some typed out twitch emotes to show me how cool you are?
---
mine was the same on xbox and only took about 3 minutes. wth is your wifi. 👀
---
they said it in the freddy stream iirc
---
OP is legit fucking braindead it's awesome
---
So long as you don't every single cosmetic you're fineeee, think about it this way, you payed 30 bucks for the game (maybe less) and you spent 30 more to get stuff further supporting the game as well. Seems like you bought a full game to me, plus Donated 5 bucks so they can improve
---
True. Haven't checked it out yet. But I will for sure get wrecked, haha.
---
and what're you gonna do about it?
---
Meg looks SWOLE!
---
I’d rather get pressure with the hook and patrol gens, plus I’d rather use stronger perks.
---
This person has a different opinion than me and I must insult him. Lol your a douche and nobody gives a shit about your petty insults.
---
"Don't be asleep" isn't a valid argument when being hit instantly puts you to sleep, and it's impossible to keep track of every pallet on the map. Saying that pallets are countered by just not being asleep, or by keeping track of every single one is like saying that the Nurse is countered by not being found.
---
Yeah if the perk was in the game then would just pare it with iron will. Sounds like a good perk idea, good job :)
---
My survivor teammate did this to me for 5 minutes straight the afk crows came and he ran away and i got killed. Smh
---
It was a much needed nerf but it was still a nerf and when two or more surv works on a gen together it is slowed 10% per person which stacks up
---
these aren’t new. they’ve been around since the ptb
---
because they’d have to make an animation for survivors and all killers but not really and i’m just dumb because PWYF already exists but oh shit what about the offering plus PWYF oh shit
---
No like a item you can only find in the dream world that would lead you to a dream hatch for a EZ escape(i had a mild stroke saying that)
---
destruction 100
---
If you got a mic and a couple of friends we can arrange that ;)
---
lmfao
---
you're trying SO HARD to prove that you're not melting down over Frederick it's cute

I only got a 2k and it was during the EGC but it was still very fun playing him, even without any dream pallets.

no like a item that you take to the wake up thingy and it wakes you up??

that still wouldnt be any different from how it is now
---
&gt; nobody gives a shit
---
*person who replied over and over and over through tears and snot
---
Lmao you're trying so hard to be cool and it's cute. Nobody gives a shit what you think. I think dream pallets need a valid counter. Small game is not a valid counter. You are to stupid to have a debate.
---
Dang.... better go get some friends. Haha.
---
dead hard, decisive, and honestly my other two perks just vary on whatever i feel like using, i mostly will use plunderers because i like to collect things, and i will occasionally put on balanced landing. no specific thing to why i think it’s better, i really dont. i dont think perks really have anything to do with the survivor when the survivor is just plain good at the game, ex: puppers recent videos on youtube where he’s playing with no perks and is looping no problem.
---
I'm not bad about the aura bug. I didn't really pay attention to the auras on gens anyways
---
They should make unit collision end after 1 minute
---
30% increase in speed woudnt look different??
---
Does anyone have links to the new banners?
---
New skins are released every Wednesday at 3 PM UTC unless they skip it for some reason. If there is a two week event happening for example, they might skip the Wednesday inside that timeline. 
---
Since we got Plague skin today with the patch, it could mean we won't be getting a skin tomorrow so the next release should be on 31st.
---
We got our self a problem than...
---
I can reply without giving a shit lol. I think it's funny watching you project your own flaws onto me. Gonna tell me I'm a fat virgin next? Lmao.
---
You can’t be affected by his snares if you’re awake, you can’t see them either if you’re awake
---
Mine are working fine
---
plus bloodlust, myers and other walking killers would start looking fucking ridiculous
---
Omg Its like you didnt even read my post. 
---
To you and all the other randoms that keep parroting Tru **Being looped isnt a weakness ITS A FEATURE OF THE FUCKING GAME**
---
Stop fucking defending Billy "because he can be looped." Its such an unbelievably ignorant statment to reduce the entire game to one situation.
---
Wraith is in the background dude
---
Ok so I love this thank you so much
---
bloodpoints tip jar good one mate
---
Ohhh alright thanks for the quick response m8
---
Billy looks so Happy lmao
---
no, unless they made another animation
---
okay what the fuck is that position dwight is in now that i realize
---
I kind of like how he forces you to manage your time now
---
Oooohhhh ok yeah that would be a good idea
---
Huh. Never thought of it that way, that’s a pretty hard truth there I guess
---
He went live today. Literally this morning. The PTB testing is filled with people not actually playing to test shit but just to make their streams popular/YouTube content.
---
i run hex: devour pussy sometimes, pls no mori :c
---
Bruh, I can mindgame. The "short" side of many of the new loops is *juuust* long enough to be safe.
---
I dared propose a counter or nerf to Freddys pallets and wow people love insulting me for it. Lol I just think either windows of opportunity should counter it or there should be a down side to such a strong add on. Every other killer add on has some downside why shouldn't this one. Gg.
---
Mine aren’t available in my list of achievements weird.
---
not as m1-ish as literally everything in the game right?
---
Have you tried restarting your console?
---
For ps4 it was a free dlc, huh, weird
---
[So like this, but the survivor instead of the killer?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p713bNaO4A&amp;t=10m34s)
---
Give up then? 🤷‍♀️
---
Its bad luck not everyone is going to own/play Freddy. I've been playing Plague too since she just got a cool new outfit today.
---
I mean it’s a Strong Possibility that it actually is
---

Give up. He isn't fun to play against anyways.
---
This is the honeymoon phase
---
Must been a promo or somethin I missed
---
Windows should definitely counter it. Unless you know the pallets the randoms drop, you can't counter Freddy's pallets. It  should at least have some counter to it.
---
I actually don’t mind playing against him
---
Squadette vs Ghostface I see
---
The average of 20, 15, 9, and 8 is 13. That's how SWF works.
---
Yeah deliverance and decisive but if you dont get the set up h e l l n o
---
Why the hell did the mods unban you?
---
No see that's where your wrong. I'm just bad. Besides the pallets tho I really do like the rework it has alot of cool visuals like Freddy teleporting and the clock that wakes you up.
---
What doesn’t that mean
---
Run Bond to see what pallets your teammates use.
---
Use Windows to memorize what pallets are up while awake.
---
Fail skillchecks and use alarm clocks to stay awake.
---
Run small game.
---
Loop windows.
---
Throw down pallets early. (Not the best idea but it might work)
---
Look at all these counters. Getting hit via dream pallets is all on you, Freddy can't do anything if you are smart enough to avoid dream pallets.
---
He’s always had an extremely far lunge
---
they weren’t survive with friends.
---
:(
---
The perk that gives you a free off hook and decisive prevents the killer from tunneling
---
If it’s Bubba, hope to god you brought some hot dogs. It’s gonna be a long 2 minutes.
---
I like everything about him except dream pallets which I think either need a nerf or let windows of opportunity show which ones are real. Every other strong killer add on has some down side why should this one be different? I love the visuals of him teleporting and of waking up tho.
---
I see, I might have to grind to get those exact perks
---
Why doesn't your game have any textures?
---
I play on lowest settings and even decrease the resolution to 0% and even my game has textures
---
Well, I'll get back to you when I have friends, haha. Not a social gal, usually just a silent rando.
---
Best advice I’ve ever read.
---
&gt; of course not
---
you literally said he was nerfed in your post
---
&gt; but if the person isn’t in dream, you’re literally an m1 killer, and anyway his traps are just weak hag
---
This first part contradicts with your main post wondering why you should even wake up. The second part is comparing two things that aren't very comparable
---
it's a mod, saw it on this sub a while back but dont remember the title.
---
Top tier nurse &gt; top tier freddy
---
A killer that mess up your pallets isn't as annoying as a killer that just ignore all pallets.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89PKBpGm4bQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89PKBpGm4bQ)
---
I dunno if I agree with this corn nerf.
---
Sure it was annoying, but t h e c o r n is kind of iconic to our experience.
---
I’ve had an idiot try and walk out with the trap and kill themself before (pre-nerf)
---
I'm not embarrassed at all lol. And I think I'll do whatever I want. Thanks for telling me what to do tho.
---
It's only toxic if it's not part of a strategy. Just doing it to do it is a bit of a shit thing to do.
---
Jane thicc
---
The outfits but not the banners
---
You know Freddy can't see auras anymore right?
---
You better believe he brought popcorn
---
I don’t get it, people keep saying there is no reason to wake up, yet they said both in the dev stream and the video today why. For each survivor that is asleep Freddy gets a cool down reduction on his teleport. If all survivors are asleep it’s -60% cooldown on his teleport. That’s basically asking him to be everywhere on the map, with that reduction he could even use it in chase. Also the lullaby only has its volume to tell his distance from you, while the terror radius has distinct sound changes depending on how close he is. It has screwed me up a lot hearing he lullaby instead of the heart beat.
---
Lastly if you are always asleep you can’t tell which pallets are real or fake without having the reference of being awake and seeing only real ones.
---
Then the add ons that make your sleep slower if you are in the dream world.
---
Exactly.
---
Don't have to worry about loading those high-res game assets when all you can see is fog. If anything you'll get framerates the likes of which have never been seen in dbd.
---
Mario is a 3 hour survivor main
---
Ok first off, i said that it was hyperbolised, second off, what do you mean hag isn’t comparable to freddy??? she gets free hits he slows you down. both set traps to end loops
---
He ended up downing me and then refused to hook while running around the map thus extending the game even longer
---
You're not wrong there but at least with top tier nurse you know some skill goes with it, with freddy he's just good.
---
Which killer is in background behind Billy?
---
cause the lag in this game is real you can get hit in the most ridiculous fashion. for example the killer could lunge miss and hit you while facing the opposite direction. you can get off a gen and still get grabbed by spirit. you can spam to drop a pallet it doesnt drop. you can attempt to jump through a window and get smacked cause you sow vaulted. and being killer is "too hard".
---
I think it's how many you have
---
Whenever i see this I laugh cuz it looks like freddy trips when you juke him
---
The OHK potential of Leatherface makes it make alot of sense to try to get double downs on people who try for hook saves. If you give a leatherface a hint that there's another survivor around, they're gonna stick around trying to get both.
---
Common: Gives the dream pallet ability
---
Uncommon: Reveals aura for 4 seconds
---
Rare: Reveals aura for 6 seconds
---
Hey whoever commented, you're stealth banned or something because it says one comment but "there doesn't seem to be anything here"
---
because i messaged them all individually, and i looked to see if they were all in a party and they werent.
---
But Freddy is so much more fun and you don't have to stare at the ground every time you miss a blink
---
i love the reworked map though. i kept getting lost tbh
---
Needs omega add ons, other than that not bad.
---
When all else fails, just break them. I run Brutal most of the time, so this isn't an issue for me.
---
Wats bm?
---
Oh wow
---
You can't get banned for that?
---
I didn't know that, thanks for telling me
---
I actually find it alright so far I’m yet to play as him but I’ve a played one match against him and it works a lot better than before
---
I don’t know, ask her, dude
---
What do you mean by that?
---
pallets are add on only??? and needing add ons to be a good killer is shitty design. The 60% reduction is a passive thing. Teleporting to gens won’t even let you catch them since they have 5 seconds to run or hide
---
My favorite perk is discordance it's a legion teachable it highlights a gen in yellow if two or more survivors are working on it
---
Soon.

It hasn't changed since 3.0.0 when he received a new attack animation. Since he has a short weapon, he really reaches when he lunges. This might make it seem like he has a longer lunge, but it's actually the same as any other lunge.
---
nobody thinks that it does
---
I have more hate mail from survivors than killers
---
I'm playing on an older PC so it's always like that on this game. Medium looks far different than low quality for me

Hell yea man, you win some you lose some right? But he's definitely way more fun. Love popping up at gennys and seeing the frantic scratch marks when I get there 😂😁 looking forward to using dream pallets 👍👍
---
Which is the entire couter play of the nurse, and mindgames. 
---
And yes, if your not alseep then you can use loops to make him putting you to sleep harder.
---
Brown is just the pallets, yellow shows survivors aura for 4 seconds, green shows aura for 6 seconds
---
Ah thanks
---
&gt; top tier nurse you know some skill goes with it
---
But that actually makes things worse. When you face a truly very skilled Nurse... you just can't do shit. At least a top tier Fredy there is counter play.
---
It's weird how much "Confidence" is confused with "Arrogance"...
---
You can also jsut fail a skillcheck in that timer to wake up again and reset it. No they dont.
---
yes more fun to play as AND against.
---
Its not biased?
---
I did she said whats night shroud
---
BHVR: finally releases a cosmetic for Pig, with one set being technically a $15 set, THEN releases a nonsensical nerf to Pig afterwards. Yep, nothing wrong here.
---
&gt; cleanse/wake up/ take off beartrap
---
One of these is not like the others.
---
No. Distressing only affects terror radius, and if the killers ability can suppress terror radius distressing will not affect that but you still get bonus BP on deviousness.
---
which point of : IT wasnt like this before they broke something and addmited they broke something did u not get?
---
His back isn't straight at all :((
---
What are the disadvantages of being asleep now?
---
I dunno. If I was a rank 20 nuberry, I'd be pretty livid going against Myers with unlimited EW3 and my entire team abandons me.
---
Pretty funny either way.
---
figures the devs to bug one of the most strongest perks in the game
---
For me I don't know the pallets the randoms drop. I only remember the ones I see randoms drop and the ones I dropped myself.
---
I always thought my OH HEX: NO was pretty clever. Got a couple compliments on the word play from ingame chat.
---
Tell that to the salty kid on xbox that said this to me last night
---
I hate the fake pallets. IMO those were a bad idea. Other than that he’s great and more interesting to play against than he used to be
---
[Because it was edited with faceapp or some other editing program, heres the original](https://dailydead.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Knifey-Hands-1000-01.jpg)
---
I find tinkerer and pop good on him
---
It is. Every other strong killer add on has a downside yet this one should be the exception? Bias.
---
If he tiers up while Sp is active then im sorry.
---
Ah thx
---
Freddy can't see Aura's anymore...
---
r/uselessredcircle
---
What is the counter play? It'd be great to know
---
its only the first day so people are still figuring out how to play against him, thats how it usually is with new killers/reworks
---
Discordance is an amazing perk because if you start teleporting to a highlighted gen then stop mid way they will run away and you can cut them off
---
I just went on another tab and browsed the web, I too am really stubborn and don't give in easily lol
---
Overcharge kick to gen -&gt; Survivor fails skill check -&gt; Teleport -&gt; Kick it again.
---
Um...he can't see your aura though?
---
Yeah, you're not wrong there.
---
I mained old Freddy as well, I get where you're coming from, but couldn't disagree more. New Freddy feels so much more enjoyable to me, I feel like I get to interact so much more with the game, and have far more opportunities to outplay survivors. I will admit, the tracking was fun, but all things considered, I really don't miss it. Everything else is just so much fun to me, I feel like I really am a nightmare for survivors, rather than a slight annoyance. Also, my God, blood traps just END most loops.
---
if no one gives a shit why are you crying?
---
Yeah i made a mistake with that.
---
The fake pallets have 0 counterplay other than WoO. It's just boring to play against. Im sure it's alot of fun to use though.
---
Happened to me on console. Im rank 8 and the killer was a rank 14, i had teammates that were rank 20s. all solos
---
Um...no. Most of the addons have been purposefully being reworked to REMOVE the downsides. 
---
Are Doctors Pallet addons op too righT?
---
I was Hex: No Creativity for a bit. Mostly cuz my friends all had hex names for a while. Also because its true that i have no creativity
---
Kinda have the feeling that Trapper hates everyone who isn't Trapper or a bear trap.
---
Trapper, I believe
---
Booty too thicc
---
They are called ‘Fat Shame spots’, spots where it looks like you can go through them but you can’t, or a survivor can go through but a killer can’t. They are somewhat rare to find in the second version nowadays.
---
yeah they said they'll never do it and it would be op
---
Yeah I’ve tried that to, I’m in the uk maybe it takes awhile.
---
Your message is a wall of text but have you actually played him?
---
I mean his pallet add-on is basic grey add-on....
---
.....
---
Not rare
---
 I have 50 of them
---
The only difference between rarities is a BBQ aura effect on dropping one.
---
Yeah my mistake
---
Each sleeping survivor decreases the gen teleport cooldown, you are susceptible to dream snares/pallets, and some addons slow down your action speed slightly
---
How is it bad then. You only said ONE PART OF 3 of his power sucks. What about the o ther two.
---
It’s not like the ambush attack is good, it gives the survivor a huge warning every time she does it, making it useless in stealth.  It’s also pretty limited at how many loops it can be used at.
---
wait.... you think freddy.... is better than hag????
---
I'm with you in this one.
---
In what way does it make her simmilar to other killers? What other killer has a dash? You are saying that you are making comparisons to other killers but so far you haven't even made one.
---
&gt;So many other killers have BETTER DASHES already.
---
Name them?
---
What do you find interactive and fun about the traps? You literally put them on the survivors and that's the last thing you do with them.
---
I never realized that Dwight is basically angry videogame nerd
---
Remember when Petrified Oak actually did something?
---
Pointing fingers? No ones kiddo here :) 
---
And that's the point of the balancing. Some things get buffed, some nerfed.
---
Both. Toxic survivors means they just rapidly crouch because they think they out-played you. And high ranks do nothing but that.
---
How are we supposed to know lmao
---
I feel like that would only benefit t the survivor though. A killer can kill a survivor if they get looped while injured and a decent distance from the gate. But if the gate gets closer. The killer is boned
---
I play on ultra settings at 110 fps, some people think fps is just QoL .... na na na na na.... thats advantage right der
---
Yeah i knew about that ive had a ps4 for 4 years and just a year ago changed over to pc and havent played/put commitment into pretty much any other game apart from dbd
---
Yes but he can no longer mindgame you with dream transition in the event you do (not may people know about this or have been bothered to learn it), so basicaly old freddy could atleast partialy take advantage of overcharge however new freddy only looses his power and gains no benefit.
---
You got that right! Anytime it’s a Survivor bug like wake up was and it’s patched within a few days and if it’s killer sided it takes weeks to months! I don’t wanna hear bs about it take time and blah blah when with the legion they could have disabled his add ons till it was patched, then I’ve heard so many people crying about banns should be handed out to people who used wake up! Like really it was 5 days and 15% ain’t shit! That stupid aura gen bug has made it easy pickings for killers and you could also see which gate they were on! But you don’t hear those same people saying they should hand out bans for that!
---
No problem
---
Also bear in mind if you use the alarm clock to wake up it keeps you awake for a bit longer (an extra 30 seconds I believe)
---
For a tattoo? Sure - I've been telling anyone asking about it I'd prefer you paypal me ~$20 so I can buy some snacks for my next drawing session, but I can't stop you from using it and I just appreciate anyone who asks in the first place. I'm not overly concerned with my art being stolen, I'm not paying my bills with my art and I just do it because I enjoy creating it.
---
Honestly though I have quite a bit of experience with tattoos and tattoo artists (I have a lot of them and know a lot of tattooers) and my advice would be if your intent is to get a piece similar to my artwork then wait until I have some more of the series done and then take those images to a tattoo artist you've researched and whose art and style you like, then show them my pieces as inspiration and let them interpret it and come up with something that is theirs and that they're excited about. You'll certainly end up with a piece that will reflect that enthusiasm. 
---
Also if you do get a piece done of my work (or inspired by my work) please show me, I'd love to see it!
---
1 million roughly, maybe a bit less

A million BP gets you to 33-37 depending on if you take the cheapest options or not.

Everyone knows that.. we are just laughing over the coincidences

i think level 40 takes like a 1M but it depends on how good you can allow the entity to take stuff of your blood web

But everyone is getting the same movement speed buff, making the idea and offering redundant.
---
Usually a cool million gets you between 35-42 depending on how you spend it in the bloodweb
---
Yes most of the pallets are unsafe so make sure you get that stun
---
I to like the trapper.
---
Especially when I hook someone in the basement and start setting traps outside. Altruism is fun sometimes
---
I watched it a few days ago and I thought of Jack being a killer while watching it, and how cool the hotel would be for a map.
---
Both designs followed the remake movie.
---
Lol love the insults. You aren't near as smart as you think you are. Not a single one of your suggestions work. It's better for people like you to act like your better than other people rather than work to improve your own shitty selves. How bout you suck my cock you fucking no nothing virgin?
---
I say lol u suck got good fatass leatherface 😂😂
---
Ohhh okay. Yeah that happens at 10-11 too. I never understood how/why people do that. My heart is beating way to fast when I successfully stun a survivor that I never think about rapidly crouching. I'm too busy hyperventilating and planning out my next move.
---
SC, Adrenaline, Borrowed, AND......
---
B A L A N C E D  L A N D I N G.
---
So you're telling me the pallet change was a nerf.
---
okay I'm done here
---
We did it boys disrespecting pallets is no more
---
Eh i feel it goes both ways. I mean i’ve had plenty of games where killers are toxic right off the bat and vice versa sadly.
---
Congrats
---
That map has some pretty good loops, like around the fence, by the white fence, the other fence that's parallel to the street, and of course the school itself. I think there's more but thats just off the top of my head
---
The whole thing with Mad Grit is that you don't lose or gain any speed when swinging and carrying someone. Since it was a fix to the bug that was on the PTB, Mad Grit now lets you swing with no cooldown while carrying someone.
---
It's worth it just to hear the killer go fucking crazy shouting while swinging at the speed of sound. (And no, it's not an "exploit")
---
Except it's not. They bitch I'm shit if they don't
---
No worries, there's too many changes to remember them all at once!
---
I always focus and kill those people. They wanna taunt me, they pay for it.
---
Only way to see the dream pallet is when asleep. Otherwise its invisible. And I cant remember why he cant port with that add-on. Havent got to try it yet.
---
then he probably has brain cancer and is suffering from the inability to think properly.
---
BHVR commonly employees this tactic to delay fixing something. If they admit it's a bug then it displays their ineptitude that it was left in the game for ***eight patches straight***.
---
*air pod joke*
---
Hey moron if you didn't block me from replying I would gladly.
---
Anyway. Guy doesn't know anything about old or new Freddy let alone how he works. Edits his post to change what I highlighted and has played more against as a survivor than actually as freddy.
---
No Freddy main would be playing survivor the day his reworks released.
---
I have nothing against this fuck nugget who likes to block out replies and ninja edit, but all I stated was his pallets are common not rare. 
---
Whatever soft fellow.
---
I would recommend posting that on r/dbdgonewild for our horny bros in their
---
the community in a nutshell
---
When Sony stop being bitches.
---
pretty sure it's trapper regardless they have hooks and spikes coming out of them which is just a trapper thing
---
“Partially take advantage” 
---
Old freddy:
---
He has to make the survivor fall back asleep, 7 seconds and then during those 7 seconds survivors could retap the gen and escape the dream world, and run for another pallet while freddy has to put him back to sleep.
---
New freddy:
---
Tap gen, miss skillcheck, gen regressed, you get hit, back in dreamworld or downed. How does he gain no benefit?
---
Is it really Sony?
---
Lmao this is awesome man
---
Yep, they had a problem with the certification process, Xbox got Bill fine.
---
Thats cuz the mummy is the Next killer
---
The killer is shirtless, buff, with spikes coming out of his arm. That definetely fits the trapper.
---
Kind of a shame that this is still a rather frequent occurring bug even after the introduction of EGC. Now you, as a survivor, get punished for something out of your control with death.
---
The map has strong windows and the strong loops are in/around the main building. The other ones can be mindgamed, as it should be.
---
Fuck.
---
Avoiding something is not counterplay to it. You are saying that the way you play around moris is to not ever be close enough to the killer so that they can't ever use it. This isn't feasible when you want to do objectives that the killer is obviously going to defend.
---
Moris are only balanced when the killer is garbage at the game and doesn't down the same person twice. There is a wide variety of tracking perks, stealth isn't really a viable option against a competent killer that has a tracking perk.
---
It's like saying "just hide" against Nurse to play around her.
---
Huntress is one I'm very excited to get to, I currently have no concrete ideas for her design though... but very stoked to get to it.
---
So I haven't told you anything about that pallet change, what are you on about? Lol bye
---
Huntress should be higher in my opinion. Her close up hatchet to lunge combo is a quick way to down someone, and can be done early game!
---
poor baby nurse
---
Well I mean cool but thanks for the updoot
---
They really dont op.
---
It’s PlayStation servers, not the game.
---
I think you did a pretty good job so far :)
---
what cosmetics come out tomorrow
---
I was playing on the Halloween map as piggy a day ago and they literally put 3 gens next to eachover, and I entirely locked it down. It went on for like 10 minutes me protecting the gens all the time, I eventually got bored, decided to actually chase one away from the gens, and I just let the last 3 go cause I couldn't even be bothered, and I guess it was a nice gesture for making the game a bit boring. But the moral of the story is that don't put 3 gens next to eachover, don't be bitching bout it, ya did it yourself.
---
They do have counters you dumbass. 
---
The entire POINT is to make you WANT NOT TO BE SLEEPING. Thats the ENITRE PURPOSE of how his power works now. 
---
You aren't alssep, they dont do anything to you. You can also jsut tell when some pallets are fake by how they place it. 
---
If they are so strong then why not make a nerf up yourself intead od bitching?
---
Probably just a glitch if anything. They said you should be fine with either ability to teleport.
---
Kate looks amazing!!!!
---
WTF are you insane?? Stridor on Nurse is extremely useful because after you blink and hit a survivor it’s even easier to follow them through their breathing. No need to listen carefully at all for tracking when you can’t see anything!
---
i have 4k HD and 70fps which is enough for me on my console.
---
*tianamen massacre noises*
---
Try to lunge through pallets, you could get a hit and probably a free pallet dropped, then you can break it and get rid of a loop. Don't break every pallet tho, leaving it could be more beneficial to you if the pallet is at a small loop. Small loops are less safe since you can go to another side quicker so you have quite a chance to hit a survivor. 
---
Enduring is a great perk that reduces half of the duration of pallet stun. It also makes a good combo with Spirit Fury, which breaks a pallet for you when you get stunned if you have broken 2 pallets earlier. Bamboozle is decent on Wraith since you already vault faster than normal killers when cloaked, now with this perk you can vault even faster and the window you vaulted will be blocked for a while. These are probably all the anti-loop perks for M1 killers.
---
If the survivor is heading to some extremely safe loop and you don't really have anything to counter it, it's better to abandon the chase. Cow loop in Coldwind has a window and a pallet. Main house of MacMillan has a really safe window. Myer's house in Lampkin usually has 2 windows in 2/F so it's a nightmare if the survivor has Balanced Landing. Sometimes you should also wait a bit before you down an injured survivor as they might have dead hard.
---
buhbye
---
Jane is just relaxin
---
Think about it. She’s out in the middle of nowhere with some dude she barely knows. She looks around her, what does she see? Nothing but walls. “Oh, there’s nowhere for me to run, what am I gonna do, say no?”
---
That first one, the bomber WWII one is so fucking good.
---
They don't have counters you dumbass. The entire point is they didn't have any ideas so gave him hag traps teleporting plus a scrapped Dr add on. I have made a nerf. Like letting windows of opportunity show which ones are real. How about you quit being such a toxic cunt and try to have a discussion. Jesus Christ some of you virgins really need to get laid.
---
Does clown have a different costume in this picture? I’m on mobile and can’t tell for the life of me
---
This. People should expect there to be a lot of a particular killer if that killer's new/recently reworked/buffed/etc.
---
g o o d
---
They really are.
---
22% of 0 is 0
---
I first started playing this like two weeks ago and I assumed it was a killer causing my controls to invert which was cool haha. Then I realized it was the “select “ button on Xbox, so I apparently was hitting it on accident in the chase panic.
---
Yeah I was just saying it'd be a cool cosmetic

Ugh that blows.
---
She can't hear the terror radius she has earphones in
---
That's the burden of the killer, making the game longer is on them. Survivors will just do the objectives and leave even if it means a safety pip (for the most part).
---
Wraith
---
Actually a killer buff, he would get more map pressure, and maybe windows would be blocked faster.
---
Lol sure just insult me
---
We do now
---
The problem is the devs handout no punishment to people who abuse DC. So people abuse them. But yea agreed with your post.

I believe its wraith by the way hes stanfing

---
It should come today. They had a problem with bill on ps4. I'm not sure if they already fixed their problem.
---
Sure you can buy it for the low low price of 96000 shards ;)
---
Those things don't work. Hey maybe I'm just smarter than you.
---
Okay, I see how you wouldn't understand which killers I'm talking about.
---
Wraith goes invisible and has a movement speed boost (also known as a dash) when he uncloaks.
---
Hillbilly has a dash.
---
Spirit has a dash. 
---
For each of these killers there's a temporary movement speed boost that's more powerful than the Pig's with the exact same concept. Just better. Wraith's is better because he's harder to see than the Pig and it's much faster. Hillbilly's is better because it's a one hit down and it's much faster. Spirits is better because you can't see her at all and it's much faster.
---
Any of these can be used mid chase, to cut off loops and to get stuff done, and they're all very fun. Pig doesn't need to copy the exact same thing. Even if they made it an instadown, it would just be a worse hillbilly. And it wouldn't make it any closer to the source material. An easy way to remedy this is letting the Pig be seen as a more plotting, cunning type that doesn't need brawn to take down her enemies, which is why the traps are more fitting than just "haha I'm faster than you for a few seconds".
---
The traps are fun to me because they give off, at the very least, the illusion of strategy with placement. I like surprising them by deciding to save my traps at some points, using them when I think I'll need to have a survivor out of the game. Granted, they're for stalling, but they're also for temporarily getting particularly annoying survivors out of your hair, so you can focus on downing the others. It really helps stop the pressure of "genrushing" and snowballing if placed at the right times. And, even the possibility of watching someone get their head popped just because they were lazy or tried to be altruistic is exciting to me, even if it rarely happens- it's just such a high price to pay for not listening to the rules, it gives the killer a lot of control. Enhancing this effect would make her a great killer in a way no killer has been before.
---
honestly, not sure but everytime i have the “expand information” it shows anywhere from 65-70fps, i’m assuming it’s my wifi being it is hooked directly up to my console but idk? maybe im just in a good area? ever since i switched to comcast my internet has been great and that’s when it showed 65-70fps.
---
I'm disappointed in all of his cosmetics. They are always cheap jokes/afterthoughts compared to the bad ass stuff everyone else gets. My boor Billyboi : (
---
Don't try to play nice you are killer
---
And T3
---
Thank you so much! This is helpful
---
Already got the hype sales for the cosmetics, time to implement the nerf they had waiting in the shadows.
---
Did it the other day with my friends and then one of us brought a bunch of luck based chest perks and just handed out rainbow maps and fully formed keys with purp addons on them
---
shes already one of the weakest killers in the game since all the nerfs. Like shes the new f tier... theyve killed my piggy
---
Ahh i think what youre referring to is ping which is much different from fps
---
If the Mori doesn’t involve Swiss cheese looking into the sky, I’m not buying
---
True true 😂😂 I’m trying my best
---
Amazing🙏
---
What do you dislike the most about current Freddy?
---
All his add-ons are actually useful now, I love it!
---
Myers is so fast, Exposed for free for everyone whenever a surv fucks up. he doesnt get spooked when a survivor looks at him, and most importantly... hes a sugar daddy material.. very rare these days
---
Yes pretty much am wasting add ons and offerings since everyone gives up when the match starts.
---
nope, it literally says 70fps and then next to the fps is my ping which is anywhere from 9-55ish.
---
nah, i think that the devs learned their lesson, maybe, sort of and won't nerf freddy again
---
Except for Billy. All of his are just variations of "lol redneck hillbilly". Other people get crazy stuff like the wax warlock, the miner, Huntress and her half dozen badass animal heads.
---
Billy just gets garbage.
---
what is matchmaking
---
Freddy's teleport always starts on cooldown. Devs talked about it in the stream. I guess it's to prevent spawning in, and immediately zipping to the other side of the map which is sort of redundant considering Nurse and Billy also have extremely high mobility.
---
Welcome to the new killer experience. New killer comes out, everyone plays them, survivors all DC and complain about them being OP, Devs nerf into oblivion, and the new killer becomes useless, and Nurse remains the only viable killer against good survivors.
---
IN THEIR FACE!
---
I was Hex: Gon' Give It To Ya on PC for a while, but I changed my name to Fashionable Hat because people kept trying to talk to me about Resident Evil 2.
---
Seriously? That's the only reason I got P3 Kate.
---
except at any kind of loop whatsoever. Or when you are doing literally anything other than moving between gens. Shes so slow as is, losing her terror radius is as good as you are going to get
---
I don’t dislike this freddy as much as I just preferred the old one. 
---
However I do kinda wish the dream snares were slightly more powerful.
---
Internet speeds wont affect your fps at all they arent connected, however im assuming you having a high end tv might mess with the fps counter because i thought all consoles were capped at 60fps
---
Cant be. It's the way BHVR patches and updates their games.
---
The only thing I want them to change is the block addon.
---
*cough* block addons *cough*
---
I get your idea, but honestly I think it should always be random. Map offerings should be scrapped too. Atleast until they balance them more.
---
Haha you deserved that 😂

at least i’ve been getting game pieces on all the other characters i’ve been leveling up recently! :)

Think the only way to counter is to gen rush no? Besides having to keep waking up to see his power, but dang how do u counter him now besides rushing him.
---
So just a straight killer buff to movement speed?
---
Then that's just silly.

Lets start a petition to get it changed back
---
~All~ his add-ons are useful now. *cough*
---
im surprised he even got a kill lol
---
yeah that’s some bullshit
---
Freddy is soooo broken now.
---
After the 5th pallet Freddy in a row I ended up dcing. Not proud of it but it's whatever.
---
Bad manners I think
---
Thats fair
---
RIP F-tier
---
Megan has 61 cosmetics, yet only Street Meg and the DG mask deserve to exist. Unlucky
---
Don't let survs tell you how to play. It's situational but if you know it will work in you favour don't hestitate to tunnel camp and slug. For an example if they are too altruistic you camp or proxy camp until they either learn or loose
---
I literally only got it last week. Is there a way to contact BHVR to remove my prestige 3 and get my BP back? I feel like my BP is wasted now..
---
Look at their bios.
---
he is me
---
and yes he is surprised
---
Sure thing buddy whatever makes you feel better. Have fun loosing against Freddy!
---
Mmmm yeah
---
But RNG is a key character of the game. In my opinion it makes the matches interessting, because nobody can make a special perk combination. Otherwise there will be tons of doctors in "the game" etc. and it would may make the community more toxic.
---
To the idea: Same thing would be with perks as well(some combinations work better on some maps) .. or survivor &amp; killers...or items &amp; addons...so pretty much everything. 
---
*"The entity is above everyone and equal. It will choose everyones faith." - from Toms diary*
---
I got that achievement waaay before the rework so I don't have to worry about anything
---
He did unfortunately. He decided to finally down me then left me until EGC timer ran out
---
Shoulda known trapper was a berzerker main
---
Sure thing buddy whatever makes you feel better. Have fun in the fifth grade failing to learn how to spell.
---
Looks like a skin for Raider in For Honor tbh
---
- Small game to see his traps
---
- Drop pallets early (in case it's a dream pallet) or just remember which one is real and which is not
---
- Be stealthy, when you need to do something ballsy, wake yourself up so you are unaffected by dream snares/pallets
---
This is just from playing the game for half a day so people will come up with much better advice within the next few days/weeks.
---
What would his power be?
---
Also Wendy Torrance or Dick Holleran could be a survivor!
---
You forgot the " ;) " at the end.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cgynb8/alert_doesnt_work_with_tier_i_myers/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
True
---
Matchmaking is like that because the queues are slow because the Freddy rework is on live
---
Pretty sure
---
Thank you for your quick answer. :)
---
Where's that new sexy kate outfit at? I've been playing her for a reason, dammit
---
Let's not do the whole drop pallets early thing, yeah?
---
Even though your right there’s gonna be a survivor main going “camping is bad you baby killer l2p” lol
---
You have to against Clown. We now have to with Freddy.
---
FUCK, my life is a L I E
---
Understandable. In terms of the dream snares, as some have previously mentioned they are excellent at ending loops, at the highest level this can be devastating as all survivors really can do against good killers is loop to buy time for them and their friends. Imo though older freddy was more fun and immersive at the casual level. I have no idea which level you play but what I can say is that you probably had tons of fun memories playing as old freddy and it's normal to feel nostalgia.
---
No, that means you won.
---
Well yea at that point you kinda have to do that, and I  won’t pretend I haven’t. I just think that face camping is really stupid
---
I would like to see how you do the doctor
---
Spitters are quitters.
---
I might be sleep deprived or something, but it says "pig's ambush counts as a basic attack"
---
But imagine the memesssssss
---
I’d say your best best is the Archives. Maybe with each Archive update, the Killer that gets lore at that time gets a soundtrack.
---
Good. You've learnt your lesson.
---
Then he could spend like two gens getting rid of all the safe pallets and destroy.
---
the bushes were too close to the tires and blocked you from getting to it.
---
The meme is saying that BHVR is bothered by it being a basic attack. The joke is they don’t care about bugs and exploits, but they care about a harmless thing the Pig had that, by changing it, nerfs her.
---
Yea and that’s with 4ppl working on 1 gen
---
They commented in dream world, you will see comment when you fall asleep.
---
Most of them. Especially the one for Ghostface. Get used to it, art assets and design work cost money.
---
You forgot the salt/rant tag
---
That's Jeff. Some of you people need glasses.
---
Narcissism is pretty evil.
---
*killer dc's because you just broke his devour hope*
---
Thats what theyre for. They said it in the dev stream that the snares slow them down for a few seconds and makes it where they cant fast vault. Ive played a couple rounds as survivor and Freddy and can say it seems to be working.
---
Looks like trapper to me wraith isn’t that beefy
---
Cant wait for the P3 Claudies to show up😂😂
---
Two games in a row couldn't see damn skill checks. Complete garbage of an update, well played bhvr, unplayable.
---
WAIT IT DOESNT DO THAT ANYMORE???
---
He’s definitely both. His dream snares are also super fun too.
---
That's your excuse and your pov. Mine is it was condescending and therefore misplaced. period.
---
Not anymore!
---
The stun build
---
Merkel Merz
---
Why? The swimsuits?
---
Actually it's
---
&gt;going into frenzy, hitting someone, vaulting it and going through fatigue
---
FUCK i got 1-upped
---
Omg stop saying that Jane is thicc please. She is fat.
---
Honestly toxicity doesn't bother me. I know I'm toxic, but I know that if I dish it out I should be able to take it
---
SMALL GAME
---
But you're rank 1 killer and survivor this season or?
---
to make them look different. dbd just has an item with 8 different colors, most don't even look decent
---
It's called a 360 and it's easy to do but hard to explain in words. Would be better if you looked up a video on it. It can be the killers bane in low ranks
---
It works on window vaults just fine.
---
On pallet vaults, it does absolutely nothing. They can continue vaulting back and forth same as usual.
---
Yea, it's again a mess, three games, two of them were basically unplayable.
---
Freddy would be so proud -sniffle- lol hes so fun to use
---
When people endlessly bitch about events, devs tend not to do them.
---
Dwight as Will is the funniest looking one. He’s rocking that hair style
---
Bruh 100
---
Wait until you hit rank 8 and below you will understand what swf really feels like
---
You realize you stay exposed even if you deactivate his stealth right?
---
Kudos to your originality and wit, good sir.
---
I'm removing the down vote you got from a salt machine
---
It does, but it has to be activated. Which means you have to put a bear trap on someone before all gens are powered, otherwise the trap will do nothing.
---
Niiiice!!! Why can’t all teammates be like this?  Stop crouching Claudette!!! You’ll just end up alone in the map and definitely get found in the tall grass!!
---
Oh... now I get it
---
A fitting shirt
---
At the very least, I hope knowing that there are killers that dominate most of their matches will make you not give up on playing killer due to starting out losing, but sticking to it and trying to improve.
---
I will say this: Given equal skill and experience of all 5 players in a game of DbD, the balance is more-so tipped in survivor favor. It all obviously depends in the map, killer character, and respective perks, items, add-ons and offerings being used, but overall I do agree that gens in theory can get done too fast for killers to win consistently. While it still revolves around and involves skill (and especially so chases), if the roundtime is too limited, survivors simply do not regularly need to have very good chase game etc. to succeed in terms of getting more than two people out. At least, certainly the game is not balanced for the idea that a killer 3-hooks every survivor, alternating targets on top of that. The issue is that the competitive premise of all five players being even only similarly experienced or skilled is hardly ever met in public matches, and so if even only one survivor is more or less experienced or skilled than the killer, the "on-paper" premise all but flies out of the window. Same with balance-relevant loadout items. I do think a variety of loadout items should be toned down (on both sides). Some map elements need to be adjusted, most of all some of the long-wall windows. Generators should at least have the headlights removed, making them take more time to locate, increasing roundtime that way. SWF could do with some nerfs, such as decreasing perk availability or increasing gen times. But this is all balance talk - skill is and will always be required to one extent or another to succeed. Skilled killers even won many or most of their games back when the game had much more ridiculous elements of survivor gameplay, and they dominate most of their public matches now. The reverse conclusion being that it also took skilled survivors to succeed. I don't think you will find a single competent killer that unironically thinks survivors are too OP for them to be able to win against, and wants them to be nerfed severely, or thinks survivor is too easy to play against good killers.
---
😂 lmao i can already imagine. I have no friends so when I survive it’s just me on my own feels bad man
---
And they're all better than her, so what's your point?
---
It’s like white, translucent string instead of corn now.
---
&gt;And then immersed Claudettes who DC on first down complain about you being OP
---
~~Not~~ today, old friend.
---
&gt; more chances for quality games
---
Lies. I'm rank 12. I wait ~20min to get a 4stack that are way better than me and mostly in high purple ranks close to red.
---
Oh my bad, completely missed you meant the pallets. Hmmm, I'll have to pay attention these next few games. I mightve not noticed.
---
Yeah the Blocks are really bad. Lol Hemorrhage and Blind. When will Behavior learn that these debuffs are worthless?
---
I hope so lol he's my favorite horror movie character. So I've been waiting for this re-work for so long lol
---
You're not in the spirits real costume. Wth.
---
I've only played one game and don't really know where to put the traps right now but so far he's more fun than he was
---
*Looks for shipost flair*
---
Ohh okay I was about to say damn I just got the skins why they gotta do me dirty
---
Damn, that's some serious dedication. 
---
Well done man!
---
Roasted and toasted
---
Samesies lol (robert englund freddy of course reboot was ok) love Wes Craven films 😍 I was so excited when i heard about the rework. I loved using him before the reworkk, now I'm just giddy all over lol
---
Yeah the max is one purple and one yellow
---
Swf?
---
I love Billy's outfit, he literally looks like a dad, so now my "daddy billy" joke works now
---
My one hope is that I can get the Ace set, because god damn is that an amazing set
---
You hear a bell sound when you are 12m near a totem or killer's trap (Trapper, Hag, Doctor and now Freddy)
---
Wiggling prevents the killer from taking you to the most ideal hook.
---
Nah Clown just runs insidious
---
Luigi is when I am up against a survivor that is either too good to be in my rank, or hacking.  
---
Mario is when I am playing survivor or against a team of survivors that I am dumpstering
---
true, but really not as bad as the RBT Change
---
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand you spend 5 gens stalking people to get tier 3 and lose anyway
---
Thank you! I don’t think I’ve gotten angry yet even tho I’m not doing to good still! I’ve been messaging the survivors saying gg even when I get t-bagged at the exits so I think I’m doing alright
---
*Loads Gun*
---
I think you meant “normal and uneventful day noises”.
---
 Round-eye!
---
Well I was just curious since at first you had a really strong opinion about the games difficulty and now you avoid the question all of a sudden. Just makes me suspicious that you might not be the prodigy you claimed to be.
---
I understand it was an exploit, but with dead hard being broken on Xbox...
---
Is that south park the stick of truth
---
Ive had pretty good sucess using the snares at windows/in loops or using them to guard an area since they reveal.
---
Keep up the good work :)
---
Contact the devs they fixed same issue for me a while ago
---
😊
---
I can understand that
---
Maybe because pallets don't have a middle speed vault?
---
Not be alseep, loop him like every other killer?
---
Well, the fact of the matter is you're doing something that doesn't work, and you just won't admit it. Maybe you waste pallets, maybe you try to loop for too long, or maybe you just aren't a good judge of distance, but all these different killers of different skill levels should not be catching you this consistently.
---
Or you're possibly  having this confirmation bias situation in which you forget all the things you have done that have worked and you've gotten away and remember only the times that you got caught.
---
At the end of the day, you're doing something wrong and refuse to believe it's your fault, and it's situations like that that are part of this community's problem
---
Meh, I am not sure about that. Top 4-5 is already A tier, he doesn't seem like an A tier killer to me. 
---
Still, that's not a reason to DC against him.
---
d a r n
---
What's the best way to contact them?
---
After about 8 Freddies I got a Billy. On my 4th Freddy now.
---
Can you use Dead Hard to get over the snares or does it still affect you? Id assume it works but I never use DH and you never know with all the glitches
---
That's why you need to play smart, I'm not saying drop every pallet you see. Being small game, and remember which pallets are real. When you're awake, the dream pallets disappear.
---
Thrill of the hunt buff looking good
---
Are these for an event? They are too similar to not be.
---
I got 3 in a row lol
---
Just because you had a good start to your game does not entitle you to get all kills.
---
It would be cool to have a killer who can pull survivors into an alternate dimension where they can't interact with each other.
---
But did he used NOED?
---
You can go inside the fake dream pallets and can’t go inside regular pallets.
---
We all did...
---
[I thought I recognised that Meg cosmetic...](https://i.imgur.com/Qjw0rgh.png)
---
Doctor and hag are often more effective than nurse or Billy, especially around green and purple ranks. The reason I say that is in my experience everyone is experienced with dealing with the common killers, the only hags and doctors most people play against are just doing their dailies. So when someone who knows how to play them joins in they severely underestimate the player until 3 people have been hooked with no gens done.
---
After my first survivor game, I plan to play alt killers all day.
---
They need to give her a bit more personality like the others. Let her have something more casual - cute even. They don't all have to revolve around sports... look to literally every single other survivor and see what you can do with them.
---
E.G - Kate getting the biker stuff, wouldn't in my life have thought she'd get that kind of outfit/style but here we are.
---
I'm on console so that can't be it. I wish it was that easy. But thanks for trying.
---
I only mind it if its the killer can instadown. I dont do it but i know how to counterplay it. It is really annoying for newer players tho, and i hope bhvr makes something that encourages leaving hooked survs.
---
What sucks about New Fred is that he lost the diversity of playstyles  you could have with the old version. Block add ons for example... I'm also going to miss the aura reading.
---
In this specific case, no. The extra regression stacking with the dress makes it better especially because survivors often don't immediately go after Lullaby like they do Ruin. In most games I've ran that build Lullaby was up long enough for it to do its job.
---
Monitor and abuse kind of does that already
---
I’ll start playing matches right now if I have to and report back to you to explain I do nothin wrong
---
Which is it?
---
You either suck or blow.
---
Unless you're a vietnamese prostitute. That's different.
---
Forums prolly have a support link
---
hey, sorry I saw your profile and I just thought you looked cute in your picture, I really wanted to tell you that :)) It's really rare to see girls playing video games haha! I don't know why its a guy thing honestly im like really against misogyny and like ill be the one in the kitchen making sandwiches. We should really play dbd sometime its a really cool spooky game with a lot of scary moments, but don't worry ill be there to protect you ;) sorry that wasnt flirting I swear Im just trying to be friendly I really like your profile picture sorry was that too far? Really sorry i'm really shy I don't go out much haha add me on skype we should talk more you look really nice and fun.
---
(on a more serious note - the cosplays are looking good. Keep it up.)
---
True, probably someone who is butt hurt because F13 fell into a flaming dumpster full of jet fuel and DBD is still chugging along!
---
Does this mean Freddy's off the ptb and can be played?
---
Nobody cares
---
I don’t bitch about dying or about the way the killer plays the game. But I sure as hell bitch when my teammates are incompetent jamokes.
---
Deep down somewhere in the comment thread they confirmed to someone asking that it'll be fixed by sometime tomorrow
---
Somebody poked the bear and the bear poked back!
---
&gt;We'll Make It
---
Luigi is supposed to rhyme &gt;:(
---
I love how almost every Freddy game I see here has at least one DC in it.
---
Get used to it, this happens on every new killer
---
Yeah I've only played one game and it started out bad for them and it was on the game so I was just placing them anywhere I thought they would be useful and they would only go off when I was busy. They were also not asleep very much
---
Why is eveeyone who plays freddy a god rn.
---
And where did that bring him? Back to DBD
---
Oh damn, I'd probably give in and buy one or two.
---
Well we have devour hope, make your choice, and other killer perks that encourage being away from the hook so that’s a start at least
---
But she sport
---
you didn't bodyblock them though
---
With Freddy's teleportation, it's pretty effective to slow the game down (plus Ruin, sloppy butcher and the add-ons)
---
Thank you so much!  The trapper and Wraith took the most time of course.  The rest I can typically do in a day unless it involves acrylic paint.  But two big guys took around 2-3 weeks.  The Wraith took two weeks with barely any sleep as a rush project for Gamescom last year xD
---
No, if they were, they would've been patched out much, much sooner than they were.
---
Or just destroy the pallet
---
Thank you very much ^^
---
*"ANXIETY ANXIETY"*
---
Me too, bud.
---
I would totally rock that outfit as Ace.
---
Imagine if he could shape shift into survivors for a short amount of time.
---
[oh wait, you’re serious](https://youtu.be/_n5E7feJHw0)
---
True, but it's only 20 seconds. Which isn't gonna change the world unless it's in the very end of the game
---
Maybe I wasn’t teabagging the killer cuz he never came down from the house and he couldn’t see me
---
Lag
---
yes. cleansing plague sickness is what i meant
---
Well there’s still the other totem
---
"Anxiety anxiety" - what every Wraith player has when playing
---
Lmao sure buddy.
---
r/moridbywords
---
They already confirmed he's coming to consoles 🤷‍♂️
---
Not only did he avoid a nerf, he got minor BUFFS!  
---
The new indicator that shows which generator you are locked on too has already helped me in game
---
all the banners for the skins are fuckin' cool and then we just have clown in the corner like: :C
---
Deceased by Dialect
---
How can a killer be toxic right off the bat? Downing you first?
---
Yep, that's just Dead By Daylight. I'd recommend getting out, running fast. And running far. And don't look back.
---
But pocket knives!  /s
---
My friends and i were excited about playing against Freddy and on our first 3 games we got a Billy, ghostface, and Myers that ALL HAD EBONY MORIS
---
He's right though.
---
Yes, but can Myers teabag? Didn't think so. Checkmate atheists.
---
*taps intensify* 
---
FFFFFFFFFFFF
---
FFFFFF
---
Bug fixes cost money too, yet no one charges for bug fixes. 
---
It's not like they'd lose much profit, with how long leveling takes it's pretty much impossible to get even one cosmietic set per character for free.
---
My build: Balanced landing, DS, adrenaline, and self care. (At least that's the perk build I'm aiming for)
---
*it's coz of the implication.*
---
Ok
---
Wait you can’t instadown if you lunge? You have to just click m1 now?
---
Originally yes but they worked something out. He's already on Xbox I think.
---
Stop, stop he’s already Dead (by Daylight)!
---
My friends hate me because Everytime we play/ play against her I turn my mic all the way up and scream it the whole match. Needless to say they mute me when they see huntress
---
That sounds like a really cool idea tbh
---
r/subsifellfor
---
*keys
---
Crispy man runs the crispy place
---
Nurse's Blink Strike isn't a basic attack either then and applies those.
---
You’re getting downvoted, but they didn’t even fix the mad grit glitch before releasing to live servers.
---
😱
---
 Almost NO ONE will go after a closely-camped hook, or even a hook where the killer is just relatively nearby. There's no point in unhooking one person, just for someone else to get caught and hooked right away. The dangerous unhook will only work with Borrowed Time, or a fully coordinated hook swarm.
---
Smart survivors - and you'll encounter this as you rank up a bit - will either just do gens while you're hooked to urge the killer AWAY, or they will wait for an opportunity to arise. Such as someone else being chased. Most killers will not stop a chase to go back to an unhook.
---
Truth is, when you're hooked, you're at the mercy of the killer and your friends. It's the way the game is as a 4v1 scenario.
---
Wait will that mean I need to get unbreakable and borrowed time teachable on PS4?
---
it's all about that trap 4k i'll get it someday
---
As always, I like Luigi more than Mario.
---
yes he is
---
I possess both, and i will get back to ya on that
---
I hate to say this again but hes too...not human
---
Or have the power *do it's damn job*.
---
Do you mean 20%? Because if nobody touches the gen, it will keep regresing down to 0.
---
Some of Jason's base abilities canceled out stealth completely. I got to play Jason once, was in the middle of a chase and lost the guy in the dark. Decided to use xray ability expecting it to show me his tracks in the direction he went. Nope, showed me his whole body instead.
---
He feels decent to play, haven't faced him yet but I expect him to be like Clown
---
Dark Devotion was also changed. Buffed to 30 seconds and seemingly no cooldown. I don't remember if it requires M1 hits still.
---
yep, that needs to be changed as well imo
---
I pissed how they nerfed the RBT.
---
If they fucking nerf freddy again I will delete the game, I swear to God.
---
Match 2.
---
Only my second time ever playing against spirit and she fucking catches me in 5 seconds of the match starting, I run and get hit in the corn because they have eyes that work and I get caught before I can reach a pallet. Hooked. I quit after that and let entity take me.
---
“Another” as in only 1 other survivor
---
Sony are kinda fucks to work with sometimes. Look how long it took for them to finally agree to have crossplay with Fortnite. Before that, if you logged into your Epic account on PS4, regardless of what platform it  was originally created on, it would be completely locked out of signing into platforms other than PS4. You had a lot of save data from Gears of War on your PC? Fuck you, can’t access it anymore, Epic can’t do anything about it.
---
There was also an issue with the No Mercy map for Payday 1 never being able to be released on PS3 because of contract issues between Sony, Microsoft, and Valve. This is most likely not BHVR’s fault and is probably one of those companies acting like children.
---
Yeah, unless the killer closing the hatch counts as you completing the last gens this is gonna be impossible.
---
Did you use pallets or pools?
---
Your life is now a more convenient truth.
---
Because it's the only way to pay for the licenses to get the characters????
---
I hate the orb around it specifying with doctor
---
Oh yeah autohaven definitely f**cked me up with Freddy too lol
---
I think you mean Lil'Bomber /s
---
See what I mentioned in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cguscs/next_up_in_the_killers_series_im_working_on_the/eumfl7z/) regarding tattoos
---
yesss
---
You better not have gotten ANY bullshit in Post Game Chat either!!
---
But counselor's had weapons, even guns, to knock Jason back. I used to main Jenny and would usually fight Jason off for the last 5-10 minutes of the match. It wasn't too hard, and you didn't have to do 5 generators, only gas, a battery, and keys. which is usually in a 3-5 house radius of the car.
---
Or the fuse, which also spawns near the phone house. But now Jason is literally super op, to the point where you can't stun him after the 10 minute mark. (And some counselors like Jenny, A.J. and others with high composure and decent stealth can avoid Jason's sense wallhacks.)
---
Decisive strike, Dead Hard, Deliverance and Bond
---
So far I’ve gone against Freddy and Wraith the most. Two Docs and one Huntress as well.
---
I’d love to have *some* matches with any of the other killers right about now lmao.
---
Yes. 
---
"Pig Ambush Attacks are no longer basic attacks".
---
So basically perks like NOED, Sloppy Butcher, etc won't trigger with her Ambush and you can't gain stacks anymore from Save The Best For Last.
---
Theres several ways to avoid Jason when he's shifting. And he can only stalk+shift late game. Most Jasons don't even do that to begin with. Just start running when you hear and see the vhs effect like dbd's terror radius.
---
This sub always complains about F13 and getting insta killed when they never knew how to play the game properly to begin with. And it can also be argued that DBD an equal amount or more of RNG depending on the killer.
---
No, he’s got his default costume on :c
---
Thanks for replying, if I go thru with it I'll definitely compensate you
---
shut up cracker
---
its true and you can really tell when they are salty when they comment on your steam profile
---
Unlike the game itself this is true
---
Just played my first match with the new Freddy 15 mins ago.
---
Was told to kill myself, was told to drink bleach, was told to fuck myself and other stuff.
---
This community never fails to impress me.
---
(Yes I know I was just extremely (un)lucky to find these 4 SWF, I still think it's kinda funny)
---
Apparently Plague perks were buffed and devs forgot about them 😁.
---
Me but with Ghostface. I swear to God I can't get any good perks on him, the Bloodweb keeps throwing utter shit at me
---
I get the feeling people are going to be pretty sick of him by the end of the week. I've been leveling up other killers during this release just to give survivors a break in the freddyness.
---
Used streamers and gateaus last night, it doesn’t show the bonus points on the score screen but you still get the full amount of bp.
---
I miss rank 20's.
---
That guys profile picture reminds me of those edgy teens going through a phase with poems
---
It might be a bug where a Bush or whatever can spawn blocking the totem. It will get fixed. Patience. Remeber to breathe.
---
Downvoted for teabagging.
---
Lol it's funny bc Kim Jung-Un actually is a killer. Trump survivor dlc coming soon?
---
Those perks dont work with Ambush for the same reason they dont work with Billy's chainsaw. It's not an M1 attack.
---
Also the RBTs are fine? They nerfed them because they made end-game damn near impossible for survivors.
---
So does this mean it no longer requires a basic attack?
---
nah, not into that stuff
---
Wrong. 
---
The different thing is that before you would need to down survivors with basic attacks, it was mentioned in the description of the perk.
---
But now, that condition was removed from the description, that means that Infectious Fright should trigger even if you use chainsaws, hatchets or Corrupt Purge to down survivors. If this isn't a bug, then this perk might become very strong for more killers than just Nurse and Myers.

I don't mind, I imagine it's just going to be like chapter drops where new killer hype is high and eventually lull down back to semi-regular over the week, though I do hope to see more Freddy mains in future.
---
Nice of you to give others breaks though because I'm sure some people will get tired of it. Ghostface definitely wore me out pretty quick.
---
i never understood why survivors leave the game right before they get killed on the hook.. we still get the blood points all you are doing is losing all of yours..

No no no, you miss. _But she sport_
---
Getting the same thing but I don't know how to fix
---
Love it lol
---
Tunneling isn't toxic
---
Not fixed yet. Just happened to me right now lol
---
They have yo spend money to make money so you getting it for free is counter productive
---
Had a game where ruin spawned inside of a tree.
---
Ngl, trapper diver cosmetic is dope af
---
Seriously? RBTS are dogshit. The only way you’re ever gonna get a kill with one is if you bodyblock boxes. Do I really need to explain the difference between the ambush attack and the bloody chainsaw? 🙄
---
Clown's bottles are much better then the dream snares. They bith reduce the speed of survivoyrs by 15% but clown can buff his power with add ons but thats it. Freddy now has map pressure and a few other gimmics. His other gimmicks do make him better then clown.
---
Quite the opposite for me

Best part is this grind is going to get worse and worse everytime new good perks come out.
---
I hate this game's RNG pool progression so much. Absolutely horrendous design that fucks new people and veterans.
---
The servers are down I think
---
Alright
---
Aaaaaand of course the one skin I’m truly looking forward to is the last one...fuck me
---
You forgot the shitpost flair
---
I think they favour killers. Plus it was a joke.
---
He was my second favorite b4 the rework. Now he’s tied for first! Having an absolute blast with him!
---
Say “sike” right now.
---
No idea but my guess is the fps
---
I mean... Ambush is pretty shit regardless of these changes. Outside of mind gaming pallet loops, there isn't much use for it. 9/10 times you're honestly better off getting in close emough to un-crouch and M1 them.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I play survivor and I find it so stupid when the other survivors tbag the killer when the killer is playing respectfully (not camping or tunneling)
---
I play on green ping
---
That's what you should do though.
---
Why the hell would they put this stupid achievement in the game without fixing it?
---
maybe the vertical control part, but the depth control was just something the nurse had to account for.
---
What was the nerf?
---
Console has a hard cap of 30 fps so it would explain why pc (which has 60 fps) can always pull off grabs
---
You probably said you'd move to canada if trump was elected president, too.
---
This was hard even before EGC. After days of trying specific builds built around getting the achievement, I randomly got it when a Myers afk'd at the hatch. Once I realized he was for real AFK I just did the last 2 gens and left. I can't even imagine how practically impossible this achievement is now.
---
O ok, thanks
---
How did you get Disgraceful Defeat? I thought that was reserved for when you DC.
---
Today i did the golden test, i faced a sweaty 4 sfw (i saw the stream and it sounded like a military operation) and got a 4k at rank 6. I say 10/10 to the new Freddy.
---
Did they change the points for cleansing a dull totem or is it bugged cos now you get 1000 points for cleansing dull ones
---
Cries in ps4
---
Your only argument so far has been “but he can mindgame you just had to learn it” like there is so many ways to counter it even if you learn it. Literally just throw down the pallet and boom, cant mindgame that. If you time the temporary vision even a second wrong, boom mindgame basically ruined as they know where you are going. New freddy can kick gen, leave, surv fails, teleport back, kick, start chase instantly. Old freddy had to kick gen, leave, surv fails, walk back, surv is gone kick gen, stay, etc etc it was much harder even if you could mindgame. You can mindgame even better as new freddy if their are gens nearby. Just accept old freddy was bad
---
I mori'd one guy and sacrificed the rest, it even said "No one escaped" as it said Disgraceful Defeat. I call shenanigans. SHENANIGANS I say.
---
Perfection.

Rip bby
---
If a killer has something good I guess we just have to Nerf it
---
I am main Killer, But I have been playing only survivors cuz of the queue times, and its pretty good and fun to play against. They added lots of new things for everyone to interact with and the Killer oh boy he looks pretty viable and tough
---
They changed it. I recommend you to read the patch notes
---
If I die but my death means the others can escape then that’s also a win. Usually a borrowed time/noed situation
---
Wraith: Tall.
---
Hag: Short.
---
There ya go.
---
The definition of overpowered is not “mandatory”. For something to be overpowered it has to upset the balance of the game, or be excessively strong with no downside. Old Mettle of Man was overpowered because the effect was strong with little investment and no real counter play. Conversely, Devour Hope is not overpowered because despite having a strong effect, it has requirements and counters to balance it out. Having Ruin in a match doesn’t alter the very balance of the match, like a mori, it just gives a strong but counterable effect. 
---
Ruin being a must pick because gens are the single most important thing in each match doesn’t make it OP.
---
Why did it depip you? That's bullshit.
---
Find the Totem then.
---
"I loooove horses."
---
So this is why I have bitter murmur, insidious and unrelenting on all my killers.
---
I did read them but don’t remember seeing about the totems thanks for the top notch advice though
---
And then have a map meta and keep only playing the couple same maps over and over because this one is bad for killer and this one for survivors
---
same tho
---
The entity was trying to save you from survivor humiliation
---
This is R/Deadbydaylight not a Minecraft Sub Reddit
---
My guess is that his power stays at 99% until a spot frees up
---
I know but it looked relevant
---
Look at this guy's name and tell me if you think he's older than 13 or simply just a true blue reddit killer that gets upset any time he doesn't 4K every game. I don't think he's worth it.
---
jigsaw and myer is my favorite

PS4
---
first message was ‘ez’ lol
---
Funny thing is, most people say "This game sucks" ect but moment the game company says one thing they all bandwagon with the devs lol
---
Do these pallets show up with Windows or Opportunity too? Sorry haven’t played new Freddy yet since I’m on PS4.
---
Kind of a lame response, that guy wasn’t really “here” he just replied to their twitter account. He probably dosen’t play the game therefor nullifying “yet you are here”
---
I am simple man, you tbag, i hunt you down and tbag you. Whether i win or lose. Oh well
---
[Actually footage of OP while typing their post](https://media.tenor.com/images/5a5ef01f09aded02317ca20daa021db8/tenor.gif)
---
That’s the Trapper. Not Wraith.
---
I WANT THAT BLENDING IN TO THE BACKGROUND BOTANIST PROSECUTED.
---
Make sure to always DC when there is a timer on your heads.
---
Thumbs up does literally nothing, from what I know. No sort of bonuses or anything like that, and even if it did, we wouldn't know what our current thumbs up is...
---
Windows should only show real pallets.
---
nah
---
Prayer Beads Spirit with Ruin, Thrill of the Hunt, NOED, and blood warden. Whenever someone begins working on a totem you'll get a notification, then you can silently phase to that location and pull them off the totem for an insta-down.
---
Whoever is left standing will get slapped by the NOED/Blood Warden wombo combo
---
Another way is to use Windows of Opportunity. Open-handed if you want more range and Bond to see which pallets other survivors use. Of 7 fake pallet Freddy games I played, I've only been fooled by one pallet.
---
I like how you blame BHVR for you ruining someone elses game. If I dc I at least accept it was my choice to do that not push the blame for my selfish actions. Freddy has only just come out, he is basically a new killer, it will take time to get used to him and adapt so you can beat him. If the pallets are an issue I have heard small game will ping if you see one so that might help you.
---
That would be the biggest myers buff EVER
---
You get free brutality, right?
---
Her ambush attack no longer counts as a basic attack and thus will not insta-down exposed survivors
---
I got smacked, couldn’t heal, then couldn’t escape. There’s also a hook bug that makes survivors glitch out on camera for everyone
---
Not I
---
Couple weeks from now
---
Guys we found the boosted rank 15 Feng stan.
---
But it makes me feel gud
---
I run Ruin and Haunted and people will STILL cleanse hex totems after Ruin is destroyed
---
See, this is why I feel no sympathy for Survivors, even when I play alongside them. 
---
Must feel real proud to best a killer who only has one perk, and not even a Tier 3 one at that.  
---
Like the other guy said - props for even getting that kill.
---
Hey good job man! I did the same with The Pig but that's the rank I couldn't pass...gl to you tho :)
---
Thanks hehe I'll try^^
---
Hi, please find the part where I say he’s a bad killer. I have never claimed he was, he is just a much different killer now and I much prefer his earlier version. If you really disliked playing as freddy then why were you a freddy main? If you truly dislike playing as a killer or even find them underpowered, why did you continue to play him? Seems more like your fault then anybody else’s
---
Honestly I think your best bet would be to just pick whoever you think is the coolest/most fun looking and go for them.  My first purchase was Pig because I thought her abilities seemed cool, and I’m sure that contributed to me getting into the game.
---
If you don’t have any preference, though, Spirit is a very strong and relatively straightforward killer as others have said.  Really the only one I’d avoid is Leatherface.  He has a really good perk that is worth unlocking if you want to play a lot of killer, but he’s easily my least favorite to play and is basically just a worse version of Hillbilly, who you already have.
---
At low ranks you’ll be able to do well with any of them.  It’s only once you get up into top ranks that the weaker killers’ shortcomings become obvious and you need meta perks from leveling multiple killers to compete.
---
 I ask you to stop telling people how to play, and you accuse me of defending hackers. Obviously you have misconstrued my point. 
---
There is no toxicity in dbdl game play. Again, what you are preaching is based off of your perspective on what you think is the right way to play. There is nothing wrong if someone thinks they need to tunnel / camp. You don't always need to escape with the most points to have fun moments. Capitalize on those moments you think are toxic and get better at the game. 
---
For example: if someone is camping, cool rush the genorators then. If the killer is tunneling, cool practice on your juking skills. Same goes for playing killer's.
---
Also side note, if the game was not balanced around skill differences, then there would not be a ranking system. You have the choice to rank or not.
---
Seems right
---
Yah I’ve been a diehard fan of l4d 1 and 2 for 9 years so I will definitely hop on that old man ass
---
Or just run haunted ground
---
Yes I do lol
---
Yeah cause of the generator part
---
Here's some top notch advice: read better.
---
I guess that's also true - she doesn't need to get something TOO CUTESY just something a bit more... "letting the hair down" kind of ordeal. I'm excited to see what they do, though. Their cosmetics are getting better and better.
---
ha! very funny
---
It is extra bp on top of a good perk. Losing a stack isn't game breaking.
---
But I’m messing with you and it just looks that way coming from where I’m sitting at and I play both sides equally.
---
Kate is always stunting in her cosmetics. I hope the Kate/Jeff collection comes out soon.
---
Is that default clown behind Meg? Y?
---
Totally agree. A beach with a jungle, a college campus, a campground, the interior of a theater/opera house.. lots of possibilities and the current map sets get kinda old after a while
---
better than holding m1
---
Nope, ain’t sayin it, you putting it down, or you leavin, simple as that.
---
That’s pretty fucked up, though not novel.  Micheal’s perks all directly contradict each other (PWYF wants you to harass but not kill your obsession, StBfL wants you to ignore your obsession entirely, and Dying Light wants you to tunnel your obsession into the ground ASAP) and M&amp;A actively hurts doctor since it reduces his ability to apply passive madness early game, which is when he most needs to.
---
Wow what a funny guy you are.
---
all the same thing of going to a place to take away a debuff
---
I haven't checked if he was up on ps4 yet, but I'm gonna main him as soon as he's out. I've always been a huge l4d fan
---
I’d want him to just throw them on the hook.
---
Congratulations, you outplayed your social life
---
Well I’m on console, and it only happened once after I got hit.
---
Aww yiss that's what i like to hear, the only downside as i just got Feng to 200 earlier today and now thr farm begins again  :(
---
I mean I wasn't down to stick around and get farmed. That's not fun content is it? But I feel you. I'll avoid it in the future.
---
Totally agree. Okay there's a 3-second charge where blood and shit shoots out of the generators and everybody knows you're coming with this reliable map pressure most people talk about.  Any survivor with half a brain should be gone before you ever think about getting there because who's going to sit there while the generator shoots shit everywhere going hmmm, I wonder if I should just stand here and get fucking hit when he teleports?  The snare traps are  are all fine and good except that it's a giant red dot on the ground red being one of the two most highly visible colors on the visible spectrum for humans so guess what, they probably see it... Did I mention it's massive?!  As far as him not having to wait to hit a survivor anymore neither does any other killer so it just eliminates the dream state anyway which take something unique from him.  That's my argument on it anyway.
---
I still like getting my extra points is all.
---
With dream pallets, sure.
---
His dream snares are pretty garbage.
---
Turn your computer upside down
---
Did i ever tell you bout ma PAL Keith? Yeaaah keif n i don some reeeel awsum shit
---
Neither of them are wrong
---
I like to image BHVR added some sort of mechanic that makes it so if you rapidly crouch in front of a killer the tag on your characters to be able to interact with the exits is removed
---
Buddy was hoping for a bigger update😢
---
Everytime something new comes out they break perks wtf!!
---
He’s sadly not on ps4 yet. I read devs had issues putting him on ps4 but they are working on it 😪
---
Yes I super recommend. Dragon age origins is my favorite game ever.
---
"Yet, you are here."  
---

/thread
---
Most games I played today we 4-man escaped and I suck ass
---
Pop Goes the Weasel is amazing on Freddy. Hook, Tele then PGtW.
---
Ruin - Obviously 
---
BBQ - Obviously
---
Enduring - I do not respect pallets at all when I use his pallets. I don't want to give away my dream pallets by respecting some and not others.

This made me laugh so damn hard!

Ew, you prestige Claudette?
---
The dream pallets can definitely be frustrating, but it seems BE have balanced Freddy with top rank survivors in mind. He feels strong right now, but we'll see if he actually can be top tier.

He's not op neither trash, solid b or c to me, K E E L H I M T H A T W A Y...

I always find it hilarious, reading dutch sentences and understanding like 80% of that, cause its so similar to german.
---
Remember Me is the best :D
---
Imagine Freddy with that.
---
And De Geest/Der Geist for Spirit and Ghostface is just Gold
---
Honestly, I'm having a harder time learning the new Springwood maps than countering the new Freddy.  
---
There is something so jarring about being in a familiar realm, but having pretty much everything jumbled around.
---
Because the games code is garbage but we still come crawling back to it every time.
---
given his power? Surveillance and Thrilling tremors sounds like a must. Pop goes the weasel might be worth a try, and if people get too paranoid of pallets against freddy they may try to hug vaults, if so maybe bamboozle
---
Lol happened to me earlier.  Ate a down to Freddy because of it.  Definitely needs a quick fix I run that shit on all my toons
---
Must be nice...
---
Happens regularly on XB.
---
I mean, if the game sucks, why the heck he is checking the dbd twitter?
---
Yeah, it's glitched, sometimes it doesn't work at all and it makes you exausted. 
---
I suggest using balanced landing in the meantime.
---
This is why Peach is with Mario but gets sloppy with Luigi on the side.
---
All they need to do is give you the ability to change your graphics to low and resolution to whatever % you want. Plenty of console games allow you to do this.
---
PGTW is defo a shout but I don’t have clown :( I’m defo considering running enduring, as atm it’s the only perk i’ve got to III with Freddy
---
Maybe you should figure out his counter instead of bitching hours into his release. Fuck off ye cunt.
---
I don't know what to tell you man. As long as I see him first I almost always reveal before he gets me.
---
Who is that??
---
Rude.
---
r/nofap
---
why does Quentin his face look normal here, and in the game it looks as if he smokes everyday 10 packs of cigarettes
---
Yeah but you literally circled the entire first picture
---
That makes sense, thanks
---
&gt;they can *completely* cancel your power
---
sorry it bothers you
---
I believe in you man
---
Did it come to console?
---
If you are going full fuck pallets would spirit fury work or is there just no room and thats overboard?
---
This is literally what I'm waiting for.
---
Mhm!
---
Best killer?  No. But there is something to be said about vomiting on people after a long day at work.
---
I picked up bamboozle in the sos so if it appears in my web i really want to try it. Plus it could cut loops down a lot and force them to throw the pallet down, so a defo good shout.
---
OneX and ps4 pro can barely do 1080p 30fps on dead by daylight
---
Aw fuck. Looks like survivng with my boi got a lot more interesting
---
Isnt the joke that luigi is supposed to rhyme when he talks? Like if mario says "Underage girls should still be treated with respect, and if you think they are hot you are going to hell" And then luigi responds with "If her age is on the clock, she is ready for the cock"
---
Maybe he does play the game and thinks they messed it up through patches or something , in which case “why are you here” gives off “if you don’t like what we’re doing stop playing it”

---
Nea is the one skating with Hag.
---
I don't know if there are any renders of these but I can assure you that the model will look different, closer to their in-game look.
---
Yeah, it's not a weak killer an it's quite unique
---
\*lets the survivors to the exit gate to get to the russians
---
Salt messages are only okay if the killer is actually being an asshole. But most of the time they are just mad they lost 😞✌
---
Ye
---
That its not a basic hit anymore, it probably count as a skill hit now. As of now i cant remember if theres a perk that benefits from M1 instead of a skill hit.
---
I'm gonna let you think more ;)
---
.
---
Cloaked
---
Hag is way too small.
---
They removed Shadowborn’s easier blinding a year or so again if I recalled correctly. Now it’s just FOV increase
---
Haven't had any games with him meanwhile people be dcing from him, wow
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Oh, not bad but a nerf its a nerf
---
Oh it'll happen. Don't worry. They'll somehow reincorporate a sleep timer into his power because Freddy being viable is just unacceptable.
---
Tested WGLF several times and did the math after each match. Can confirm WGLF still gives bonus bloodpoints regardless of it not showing bonus bloodpoints at the end of the match, the bug is visual only.
---
Rule 7
---
Well I mean...I'm a normie. So reee I guess?
---
Remember when instablind flashlights were a thing? 
---
Then this happened 
---
https://youtu.be/R98e-Y4Lu8w
---
2 weeks later instablinds were nerfed. About a month or so after that flashlight timing was changed when killer pickup animation was buffed in speed. 
---
Not saying these are bad changes but it’s a trend lol
---
So if u run stbfl with pig, i can ambush attack the obsesion and i dont loose tokens?
---
unbreakable, borrowed time, left for dead
---
Mine is young gam
---
well, i think it's a nerf if you're using MYC, NOED etc but definitely a buff if you're using STBFL
---
It means that instant down perks like NOED, Haunted Ground, Devour Hope and such shouldn't work with Ambush Attack ( like Huntresses hatchets ) and also you probably can't gain stacks from Save The Best For Last or Remember Me anymore from hits with her Ambush.
---
Adept, taking one for the team and left behind
---
Doesn't counter facecamping. Rank 9 and get facecampers in about 8/10 games. Fun
---
I was joking but ok
---
Wraith rework incoming?
---
I'm not enjoying it and the meme that Freddy is bad has irked me for quite some time
---
I’d argue a good ghostface is a lot harder to face than a good Myers. You just see a lot of low rank killers playing him for some reason.
---
It does not counter nurse at all lol. Great against spirit though.
---
Then don't use the offering  and it doesn't effect you
---
Another unwarranted pig nerf wooooo
---
It's a great perk but I'm not sure why a cartoon character needs to say it? Why not just make a text post?
---
My current setup I'm going for is iron will, urban evasion, Windows of opportunity, and lithe
---
Piggu just got a nerf so I'd stick with GF
---
Damn BHVR, I didn’t know permanent sacrifices were a thing
---
I did because I liked the teachable s I had on her like adrenaline and prove thyself some others I wasn't a toxic player as I was new to the game and unawer of certain playstyles and stupid mindsets how people just automatically think Claudette is toxic or Dwight is baby and shit like that. Also how anytime a killer does literally anything that's a fair game mechanic the surviviors just bully the shit out of them
---
Nurse relies a lot on hearing you when going for blind blinks through walls. It can help a lot when breaking line of sight, and prevent her from regaining chase if she loses you.
---
edit: it doesn't hard counter her, but it has a stronger effect against her, than against most other killers.
---
I will say, I haven't played it since somewhere between The Plague and Ghostface release. But I still follow the game and am interested in these updates and new releases. I just wish there was more gametypes or something. I got kind of bored and burnt out after playing since it released on Xbox almost daily.
---
I wish they’d just fucking tell us percentages, “considerably” “slightly” “tremendously” and so on are inconsistent and stupid
