Getting an extra hit for free is pretty unbalanced, for the same reason they nerfed DS, getting a free escape when you should have been downed is pretty unfair.
---

---
Free escape perks like MoM shouldn't exist, period.
---
---
---
Guys just deadass rambled on about enduring for 80% of it
---
Is that still common? People stopped complaining about it so I thought it was long since fixed
---
They ain't 3 foot dolls thoooooo
---
CAN WE PLEASE JUST REMOVE RANK RESET? I LOVE GETTING CAMPED AND TUNNELED ALL GAME AND THEN GETTING PUNISHED FOR IT WITH A DEPIP. THEN MY TEAMMATES KILL THEMSELVES ON HOOK 24/7 AND IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PIP.
---
&gt;Shape lore: "none of the movies are canon"
---
Well that's what happens when your creators only ever intended to have you be a one hit wonder but then you got way more popular than they thought so then they had to make some sort of makeshift continuity in order to keep the series going.
---
Duration add ons are cool
---
U sound like your straight stuck in rank 20- 15 honestly... you probably only see like 1 Metal player once every 10 games at that rank, so I dont get why your crying.
---
Getting hit isn't losing either... What's your point?
---
just for survivors. idk if theirs a way to know if the killer intentionally dcs or not
---
?
---
Well then my original point still stands, because I was playing killer in that game.
---
Not the same shit as noed at tiers one and two still gave speed and weapon miss cool down. Same thing with devour.
---
AT LEAST 50% OF MY MATCHES TODAY HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE DC, SOMETIMES TWO. PEOPLE SUCK!
---
IT IS AN ACHIEVEMENT YOU GET FOR DOUBLE PIPPING AS A SPECIFIC KILLER WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE PERKS AND ESCAPING AS A SPECIFIC SURVIVOR WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE PERKS
---
I just don't want the killer to stand there looking at a downed survivor and waiting for the game to end. I guess it's not exactly holding the game hostage, but it's definitely a problem with Endgame Collapse.
---
They didn‚Äôt mention anything to do with ghostface in the dev stream as far as I‚Äôm aware. I did have to leave to do something at parts but that was mostly when they were dragging on that shit about the enduring nerf
---
Not really. I'm not going to use my power if I don't see a survivor.
---
The devs have said on multiple occasions that ALL killers have the same lunge. The hitbox mess is a problem that comes with p2p networking &amp; desync is the issue.
---
It allows you to bounce
---
I KNOW RIGHT I HAVE BEEN WANTING AFTERCARE FOR AGES AND OF COURSE THE ONE TIME I COMES IT'S BROKEN. HOPEFULLY IT WONT TURN INTO LAST YEAR WITH BBQ BEING NON EXISTENT
---
Tell me how spirit fury has a counter? You mean having to drop pallets early and wasting them because you're scared to stun a killer? You're punishing a survivor for doing their job like MoM does. Same shit.
---
Killers have 1 shot weapons, 1 shot perks.. Theres tons of killer weapons and perks that down players and deprive them of even taking any hits at all... Out of all the hits Killers get per game, 1 extra isn‚Äôt even bad. Its equivalent to a player healing and having to hit them again.
---
I would have said the same thing.
---
Ah, so we have to sacrifice perk slots for a perk. Lol makes sense.
---
Idk killers complain another good perk into the nerf yard yet most good killers I see say it's not a big deal. Now that mom is nerfed I wonder what will get blamed next when they lose.
---
I should clarify when I say Doctor is B tier because he's the lowest in that tier, below Hag, Huntress, and Clown respectively. But he's still much more useful than Trapper, Wraith, Pig, Freddy, Cannibal, and of course, Legion.
---
Yes, inexperienced Docs tend to get looped. But skilled ones will be able to combine zaps and counterlooping to easily negate anything thrown at them. I've played Doctor in red ranks many times and rarely gotten less than a 3k. It's easy to quickly pick a target and either bait out a down or use the aforementioned zap. Now DOCTOR has momentum, because the further into the game it gets, the more your Madness has permanently affected people. You just need to prioritize getting people insane before targeting, which, as a Doctor main you say you were, you should know very well.
---
Having 3 or 4 Survivors injured at a time is not only extremely situational, but also nearly useless. As I have said COUNTLESS times, and you yourself just above, you can only chase ONE AT A TIME. And Survivors can MEND AT ANY TIME. Chances are, if those Survivors are close enough to be chain hit by Frenzy, they'll be close enough to heal each other as well. What you're essentially doing is ensuring you DON'T get a down by constantly shifting your target as you say Legion should do. Also, you assume Survivors will be out of position like you assume they'll be together-- tell me, have you played Legion in red ranks at all? At high levels, Legion is even more useless, because they DO know how to loop, they DO know how to heal each other, and they DO know they can do whatever the fuck they want because it's LEGION. And everyone knows the new Legion can't do shit.
---
To be fair, this game is a 4v1 with (supposably) limited communication with mostly random teammates. If 4 of the 5 players get bodied and destroyed 80% of the time they play. They will lose interest and most likely stop playing (which is 80% of the player base); It‚Äôs not good for business if you are displeasing 80% of your player base. Therefore, killers will never have a drastic upper hand unless dbd becomes fun to lose as a survivor.
---
I play pretty 50/50 killer/survivor, and while I never lobby dodge (because fuck that noise), I am rapidly growing more and more anxious anytime 1 or more Ashley‚Äôs spawn in my lobby. Not sure if it‚Äôs the perks, the character (that guys my age grew up enjoying and now somehow desperately want to be), or what... but DAMN if Ashley players aren‚Äôt the saltiest little crackers in the tin. I get more end game salt from Ashley than any other survivor. Dunno if I‚Äôm alone in this, but might be a (lame) factor?
---
Yeah adding Chucky to the game would be ridiculous but still almost every survivor could kill Susie i mean she's just a little girl
---
Exactly. No killer loses because of 1 perk. If someone loses, its because they just did fucking bad in general. I play against plenty of good survivors that escape with or without Metal.
---
Whenever I see more than one Ash, the Vommy Mommy JUMPS out.
---
This is the best thing ever! Please do more, it's really funny and creepily accurate lmao
---
It effects everyone for every rank of the perk
---
They said that was just an idea. Maybe they'll knock it down to two hits. It's still not "worthless". It's a free hit. God forbid you have to work for something.
---
You said 3 protection hits. Will MoM be one protection hit or are you talking about being able to take 3 hits including MoM
---
Same. I was playing plague the other day so I could get dark devotion as a teachable. No camping or tunneling. The only thing I guess they can be salty about is I brought I hand offering. I down the first survivor with corrupt purge to which they DC.I get messaged for ( and I quote ) being a ‚Äúweak killer and ruining the game for everyone‚Äù 
---
If you ask me I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs salt. I think it‚Äôs just that this community sometimes can be really fucking stupid. No offence to any of you. I‚Äôm sure your all nice üòò
---
Did you message the myers saying ‚Äúaww sore loser‚Äù? If you did that was me, and my game crashed.
---
Eh I don't read fan fiction so I cant tell you
---
This also applies to leatherface js
---
Subscribed!
---
Thank fam, still doubting myself haha, I don't play the game often so purchasing a dlc is big for me even if it's like less than 5 bucks.
---
For a long term perspective, spirit seems better because if I do invest my time in her she can be lethal but I don't know I really like legions  ability.
---
Ehh I will decide later
---
I really don't see why they had to change mettle of man. It's not that annoying.
---
Why do people all group Megs in one stereotype? :( There are competent Megs out there. I know most Megs are potato but we exist
---
You're literally making up statistics. I payed for the DLC for the perks that were advertised. Then they go ahead and just change the perks a few weeks later. If I knew this beforehand I wouldn't have bought the DLC. It is really dishonest of them to do stuff like this. It's not ok to sell someone something and then go and change the product after it has been sold. It's that simple.
---
I've played this game long enough to know exactly how it goes. Protection hits are mostly negative for the team. In those very, very rare cases, you manage to actually save someone's ass by taking a hit for them while they are being chased. But mostly when you get a protection hit it's from blocking the killer when they are carrying someone. It is very rare for this to actually result in the survivor escaping the killer's shoulder considering how close hooks are to each other nowadays. So basically you just put your team at a disadvantage by having to waste time healing. Now you have to do the same thing 3 times to make the perk activate and the payoff for all that work is insulting. Absolute garbage. I'd argue it's almost worse than running No Mither. With No Mither, at least you are working on gens instead of wasting time following the killer around and then wasting time healing.
---
DS punishes killers for playing badly and camping/tunneling. It‚Äôs a second chance perk, yeah, but it usually only activates when the killer is being scummy and totally deserves it
---
No, I'm just saying that based on the timing of when the video is coming out, it makes the most sense that the rework is in the next chapter patch. The video would be coming out way too early if the rework won't be playable for another two months.
---
I don't use sprint burst and I'm not rank 20 and if I could use the single pony tail with the headband without freezing the game up for half a minute I would but otherwise the meme is pretty accurate even for myself.
---
You can hit someone over the low fences on haddonfield and badham. You have perfect control of your character and can be hit here, why would through a window be any different? It's even closer than the fence.
---
For me it's more they are bad at hiding and i got no other option to hit them
---
Again, it's a skill thing. You can bait it if you aim right, or use certain addons.
---
As others said, everyone now runs adrenaline, so noed is almost a must if you want kills against swf groups. Also it's op and broken perk in general, of course everyone who wants a win gonna use it. Why wouldn't you? Trying to be nice? Nice guys finish last.
---
Yeah. Same here. I actually play survivor with it and I play against it with killer. I promise I have never had MoM happen mid game and I won because of it. Maybe late game but never early. If it procs I just get a extra hit before I eat the hook. If you are barely able to land hits on survivors that's not perks that's someone being outplayed. Same with old ds. No one ever really got away from me with it unless it was in the exit gates. If exit gates get powered the killer already lost especially if 4 players are still alive to escape. Killers that think they are good for last second kills deserve to get ran out on with MoM
---
I'm really confused. MoM has a potential/probable change incoming that in order for it to activate you will need to take 3 protection hits (instead of 3 normal hits), then it will activate and behave as the current one.
---
My first comment is basically saying that even though I'm not sure the proposed change by Behaviour is good I rather have it than make it an exhaustion perk.
---
Honestly I feel like I do decent as killer, I am only rank 9 killer though. It‚Äôs just annoying being the survivor getting chased all game and not getting hit only to have noed activated and then get face camped. I do agree it is almost necessary against good swf groups though

It's not a hitbox issue. That's lag.

---
I'm tired of the damn people expecting Harry Potter levels of lore for a simple game. Writing 3 books is not a requisite for making a game.
---
If you seriously think that we need that much lore you may be more into books than video games.
---
Either way he‚Äôs changing so, the majority consider his power trash.
---
So 3 protection hits stack it. Idk. That sounds like a weird balance.
---
You must have missed the dev streams back in the day, constant bitching and moaning from this sub anytime they answered more questions
---
if a game is going to flaunt its deep lore and story and wrap it in a layer of mystery, you better believe im going to expect them to deliver on that promise!
---
It‚Äôs kind of annoying when billy downs u instantly and spends the next 2 minutes searching for non-existent survivors. It should activate if you get downed in 45 seconds and just stay that way
---
&gt;cause most are probably entitled cunts that think they deserve 4 Kills every single match
---
You sound extremely entitled by expecting a perk that you "paid for" (when really, you just paid for the ability to use Ash) to work as you expect instead of how the devs expect it to work, and by calling your opinion "decent" while simultaneously putting down all the opinions who differ from you. 
---
And by the way, NOED has nothing to do with MoM.
---
Hahaha when I first started playing I had no idea how nurse kept finding me. I'd just be healing then "Tf?? Go away!"
---
You downvote someone who didn't call you any names nor did they put you down, but rather countered your points with facts. You are incredibly disappointing.

its like i get 2 to 3 every game and still win because i have 2000 hours in this game i played killer when it was unplayable when you could never catch people who knew what they are doing  so nice try but try again there friend i legit used your own example of BBQ  ageist you prey tell how dose one not get fucked by MoM every game ill tell you, its camping the shit out of everyone u catch and that's not fun the update doesn't even make the perk trash it just makes it better for counter play because you have to work as team for MoM and that's good i hate things in this game that have no counter play like MoM and insta-heals they are boring and unfun same on both side i hate that as much as i hate insta-down huntress or insta-saw billy stuff that doesn't have counter play is boring
---
Not really. Nice meme tho!
---
that shit sucks. one time i was killer and wasn't really doing so hot so it was more suspicious when i got kicked. someone on a different ps4 logged into my account and it logged me out and kicked me from the game
---
IM GETTING REAL TIRED OF HITBOXES AND GENERALLY STUPID HITS
---
Dev also stated that if this is the change they will most likely look into protection hits being buggy as fuck to register... if they fix the protection hits (and actually improve it) I think it will be a really good change, otherwise they're killing the perk.
---
actually yeah!

How I would fix it, just because I‚Äôm throwing it out for no apparent reason. If you are the obsession with the perk, the perk can stand as is. If you are non-obsession, I would add another hit making you require 4 hits for MoM to activate.  So not only is it slightly more riskier and requires an extra hit and also requires you to not get tunneled and healed up if you are running the perk, could guarantee a kill? And if you heal up after using MoM‚Äôs ability, you are given exposed status for the rest of the trial. Basically you are gonna get one shot no matter what essentially if you are saved by MoM? Just throwing it out there.

#notteyingtopromotebutheremyexperiencewithhitboxes (60 ping)
---
Yeah but hes on to something. The reverse of the idea. It can only active if you get 4 stacks before the first hook. You would have to escape chases to get a chance to use it and not take downs. Kind of like how you cant use deliverance if you have been hooked first.
---
Didn't they already do that?
---
did u just use supposably unironically i cant
---
Yea, as a survivor main I dread every game when I hear Billy's chainsaw start at the beginning of the match. I can run him around usually, but if it's a good Billy, potato teammates gets destroyed easily and if I run into few Billies in row, I just turn on rocket league to actually have some fun. I take nurse other billies every time, I just hate insta downs so much.
---
Official best friend

Im not sure because ai was watching the developer update, and they said it would be coming back

The majority are wrong lmao

no

Had the same thing happen to my monitor and abuse

&gt;"queer" is mental illness.

Ignore him, hes a salty survivor main :(
---
I was on 66ms i dont believe it was latency this is a serious issue in the game that makes it unfair and easy for the killers to win.
---
Ik your trying to defend the game the devs and be a good person in general.
---
This is just a topic i wanted to bring up and discuss about.
---
But which actors bod should they use?
---
not that I can remember
---
Don't want to sound rude, but I'm gonna be honest and say I'm not the biggest fan of a general subreddit of a game being 80% fan fiction and fan art. Don't get me wrong, I like it but I think it should have its own sub (which would be even bigger than this one tbh) because more often than not posts and discussions about the actual game get drowned by chibi huntress fanart.
---
This use to be a thing. Invisible survivors would load in and birds would alert the killer to where they were.  The killer would down and hook them and let the survivors get unhooks for points. I‚Äôm not sure when it was fixed because I quit playing for a long while but it was one of those funny fun bugs like Neas aura with the pants that connected together at the bottom. No one complained or seemed to care that it was a 1v3.
---
I think that only applies to the survivors due to certain countries that have laws about depicting violence upon minors. The Killers don‚Äôt count because they‚Äôre the ones perpetrating the violence.
---
Survivors been complaining about noed, Billy and nurse for a long long time, nothing was done, nothing will be.
---
I plan on doing more, I promise! ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôve got some other types of videos in mind, but I thought the overall idea of applying a nature documentary to DBD could potentially freshen up the content we have. :)
---
‚Äã
---
The support is appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Well I think discussion of the game is better on their forums, while reddit is more of a just ‚Äúgame content‚Äù place
---
I mean just because he will have a ptb does not really mean much. it is a killer after all with a pretty advanced power they would want to test
---
Its a better concept than current legion for sure but I don't think it will ever be balanced. I rather have a complete rework or if we're working just with his current kit he either needs more move speed or almost no stun when leaving frenzy (intentionally hitting M2) but again I fail to see how that would make him fun, only slightly more balanced.
---
Not if you‚Äôre doing it right.
---
One extra hit can make all the difference. I get that you might go up against ass survivors who just don't know how to loop or something. But an extra hit when you should go down can waste more time for free. MoM only punishes the killer.
---
No matter how little time it is, it's a free hit, and can lead to a survivor looping you for much longer than they should have. It could even lead to them getting a free escape because they equipped MoM.
---
It isn't just "1 extra hit", instead of time spent on the hook, the survivor spends more time occupying you.
---
It's a free escape. Free escapes are bad. It's almost exactly the same as old DS.
---
Hell. Hell is what you just loaded in to.
---
But that's heaven for me, I'm a N-E-A main
---
And yet I've seen people here saying Legion's power is better now, lol...  Almost every single aspect of it was nerfed, and the power was barely compensated
---
&gt; Neas aura with the pants that connected together at the bottom. 
---
I miss that. I'd proc BBQ and start laughing my ass off because it looked like their pants were pulled down around their ankles and they're running around in their underwear.
---
Probably just a really bad connection
---
They may have called it that on twitter once. But Ghostface has been called a chapter several times.
---
God I wish Nurse and Billy were balanced properly
---
Really? The stun on ds doesn‚Äôt seem as long as usual, but I guess I‚Äôm just not paying attention
---
I do expect what I payed for. Haha wtf. It should work exactly as expected wtf
---
I didn't even know it was hag at this point so those traps scared the bejesus out of me
---
üòçüòç
---
I've seen it used before where someone gets hit twice, Mettle activates and they don't go down, they insta-heal, then you have to hit them three times because Mettle activates again. It only goes away once you get downed, so as long as you can heal up between activations then you can use it over and over. Mind you that's a very slim situation but I've seen it done.
---
As far as I know it was never worked on I can't really find any specific mentions of it. I believe it only occurs for Killers purchased with auric cells, rather than buying the pack directly. I've yet to test this since previously Leatherface was the only killer I had bought with auric cells. And now I repurchased the pack and will let you know if I see any more bone splinters
---
I really do not think that matters. but we will see what happens
---
She did win my affections, maybe just not in the intended way. Thanks so much for the support! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Winning or losing is not gaged by survivor or not (and it should improve a lot) for that reason, you can't have 80% of your player base getting destroyed but unless you give enough power to that 20% good luck finding games, might as well start developing a bot.
---
And yes the only splinters I was getting were for Leatherface
---
New killer: The Ape
---
Able to swing from overhead structures and land on survivors, instantly downing them
---
Either way the change is happening so no point arguing over it.
---
You make a point
---
Looks more like lag than hitboxes to me.
---
Yea but the context you use it in is BS. You try to make it sound like NOED was buffed and made strong. It‚Äôs not true, you know it and it‚Äôs childish to make an argument like that. Sure NOED 1 and 2 are good now but honestly it doesn‚Äôt even matter. Everyone has and uses 3.
---
Ofc Mettle of Men gets nerfed, the really want to kill the game by making Survivors leave the game and increasing Killer queue times to 1 hour :) Go ahead devs go ahead. The crying will be legendary.
---
It would also make perfect sense for her map to be anywhere else if the only justification we need is "she traveled" lol
---
I disagree, the full purpose of this sub is to discuss the game which includes fan content, gameplay, guides, etc (thus the flairs), but I think in this specific situation the fan content is so overwhelming that another sub would be interesting, or at least some kind of filter.
---
[removed]
---
&gt;its deep lore and story
---
There's no such thing. We have a small description for every character so that they're likeable and don't look like random models, that's all.
---
We don't know what's the entity (aside from the program's backend), where were they taken or why, and from the game's standpoint it doesn't matter.
---
That would make sense. I don't have this issue but I purchased everybody through Steam store
---
Noed was nerfed, billy and nurse are annoying because you can't play something else without being at a HUGE disadvantage. Also I don't see why billy is unbalanced... he is hard to play but he also has some counterplay (unlike Nurse).
---
Oh btw if they nerf Nurse any more she will become useless, thats how it is when you develop such a game breaking power. Its either OP as fuck or its useless, you can't properly balance her by herself let alone with all addons she has to change how her power behaves.
---
Teabagging and flashlight clicking are the only things I find toxic.
---
Well ur uninstalling bitc they don't own the character they can't change it at ALL
---
You should should make a tab of it!
---
How dare you. I dont like the MoM nerf but I also dislike little bitches.
---
I'd assume most of that comes from people who play against it and enjoy going against weak killers. Or people who really like looking at their hands.
---
Yeah. It's too soon for me to say it wont be good I do t really know. I'm just nervous about it
---
So ur a god, ur the obly one who gets in ALL of his games 4k perkless freddy, show me ur skills!!!! Ok now, what makes u thibk freddy is good?
---
ya agreed it is a problem that needs fixing I really think they should just make it so the killer gets no points for it since the entity is the one that kills you anyway. to make it fair so survivors will not just hide make it so it will only give the killer no points if they are on his shoulder or on the ground. that would solve the issue right away and not sure anyone will have a issue with it
---
The changes will not go through. 
---
Protection hits are not enough to make it stack to 3, which is why I suggest double stack rewards. You earn double MoM stacks for a ‚ÄúProtection‚Äù or hook bodyblocking. This rewards survivors with MoM sooner, and allows the killer to remove it before endgame. 
---
Currently, it feels as though MoM‚Äôs aura reveal is not a consequence. My solution is to encourage MoM to proc early in the game, and make it a risk to remain injured. 
---
As you said, ‚Äú1 extra hit is all the difference, but it‚Äôs really not unless it‚Äôs endgame.‚Äù And unfortunately, MoM is abused during endgame.
---
I want my opinion to be heard, along with all the other Freddy mains that don't want a rework.
---
No word about buffs for the Pig in today‚Äôs dev diary. Kind of annoyed about that. They don‚Äôt have to restore what she‚Äôs lost but she needs to get *something* to make up for the fact that her power goes away at endgame.
---
but the three lines look cool
---
Default trap placement speed shortened, TR reduced, all negative affilictions from her add-ons getting removed, Waterlogged Shoe giving a speed boost for its downside of not being able to teleport and scarred hand having its horrible 9% speed reduction removed (101% Hag lul)
---
They're aware of this but God knows when they'll do Jack shit about it . Even just making 3 or 4 perks per level and you can pick 2 would be amazing.
---
this is the only valid response.
---
I already told you I played Legion exclusively at Rank 1 before the reset and I‚Äôm now Rank 4 after the reset. Having 3 Survivors injured at time is situational with Legion?!?! Dude... did you only use Frank‚Äôs Mixtape and tunnel with the old Legion? Legion‚Äôs entire power is built upon injuring multiple Survivors in a short amount of time. And despite how much everyone is saying Frenzy got nerfed you still move much faster than Survivors and it lasts 10+ seconds now. Doctor is not a better a Killer than Legion. I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre trying to tell me Legion struggles against good Survivors (which he sort of does) but Doctor doesn‚Äôt.
---
Or when teammates are unhooking others literally in my lap because they have borrowed time.
---
But sure, ita always on killers.
---
Pretty sure thats not how it works
---
Putting out a new survivor that's pay only with a strong perk only to then nerf it into oblivion is actually predatory marketing. I'll be less pissed about the MoM Nerf though when something is done about the outstanding' balance issue that is exhaustion addons and when they add a totem counter for solo queuers. 
---
And before anyone gets all crazy thinking I'm a survivor only player, I main an M1 killer.
---
You paid for the right to use Ash and his perks. Not to be the be-all-end-all of how that perk should work. AFAIK, you're not a dev, and don't get to make that call. Wtf, indeed.
---
You clearly don't understand, so we're done here.
---
WHEN IS SOMEONE GONNA POST A SYNOPSIS OF THE Q/A SESSION? I'VE BEEN AT SCHOOL ALL DAY AND I WON'T HAVE TIME TO WATCH IT ALL TONIGHT.
---
Your mom sure thinks so
---
Just play like most high rank killers, go after the unhooker, not the unhookie. Or if that person who was on the hook is a cunt. Down them and count to 61.
---
Well the insta heal thing I mentioned happened right in front of me so I don't know what to tell you.
---
It was around a second or so right after the DS nerf with Enduring, but it's been changed since then.
---
Nah fuck the killer
---
No.
---
Killer mains will forever justify themselves while saying that survivors are the whiny ones. It's quite ironic.
---
Especially when they pull out the 'camping and tunnelling is a legit strategy' argument. All I see are butthurt killers getting mad that a survivor is good at looping, and face camping them as a result. Very rarely are survivors actually BMing to warrant the camp. Just killers perceiving survivors merely existing as toxic.
---
Let people ship what they want and enjoy things. It's not hurting anyone. It might be cringey or weird to some, sure- but I'm down for people expressing what they want to and making their own stories to love.
---
It‚Äôs okay. Keep playing new Legion and you‚Äôll figure him out one day üëç
---
I say 80% of the player base since a game consists of 5 players. 4 are survivors and 1 is a killer. A win (according to many killer mains apparently through forums) is killing everyone. Though the dev say they want 2 survivors to escape and 2 to get sacrificed every game. But no one listens to the devs so I was going off killer‚Äôs criteria of a ‚Äúwin‚Äù; stupid as it sounds lol
---
Ok, and does that show what power he has/still has or his add-ons? I don't think so.
---
Lmao play Doctor or Legion right and I'll do that
---
I. JUST. NEED. TO. KILL. ONE. PERSON. WITH. SPIRIT. STOP. FUCKING. DISCONNECTING.
---
It's not just you. Ash players are becoming the new toxic Claudettes.
---
just slug them and make them wait
---
SO, THEY MADE IT HARDER? I THINK I DID THOSE A LONG TIME BACK BUT DONT REMEMBER IT BEING AN ISSUE OTHER THAN BEING FORCED TO REMOVE A 4TH PERK
---
Was it a Ruin or Devour Hope?
---
Doctor is 100% worse than new Legion. Not even debatable.
---
Not together ever, but Trixie on very rare occasions will stream on Twitch and DBD is one of the games she plays. And I believe she donates all her Twitch proceedings towards organizations that support LGBT youth like the Trevor Project so it‚Äôs for a good cause!
---
Well we certainly have been debating it haven't we? üòò
---
That's the way they cover for not actually having invested any time in it
---
Were the kind of things you tell your parents or your friends?
---
Dude, the guy killing people in Texas Chainsaw Massacre? That was Leatherface the entire time dude
---
On Xbox, my friend and I had a game where a player was running Unbreakable, Boil Over, Flip Flop, and Tenacity. It was Haddonfield and the survivor kept trying to do a generator in the basement (near all the lockers) against this Huntress. She must have downed him at least 3 times and tried to go up the stairs and hook him but he could automatically wiggle out, so she just gave up eventually on him. She kept downing him hoping for him to bleed out but we kept healing him when he was down (and he got up with unbreakable once). It had my friend and I saying he carried the game  and laughing for a long time after.
---
You earn adept from a double pip. NOT a 4k
---
They‚Äôre so funny, do you mind linking me to her twitch page? Or maybe her name so I can watch some more videos later please?
---
Adam main here. Can confirm in keeping killers stoned constantly
---
Lol. No fat bastard is the killer. His power is an AOE fart and his terror radius is bag pipes.
---
But again I think Bhvr is a bad dev in general so they take short cuts on everything..
---
Sure!  [https://www.twitch.tv/trixiemattel](https://www.twitch.tv/trixiemattel)
---
I've been bringing a map with killer possession offering and getting all the totems once the gens get close to being done
---
Thanks for acknowledging my greatness :) I‚Äôm glad you have realized that I am the almighty. 
---
Anyway I didn‚Äôt say I only get 4ks just that that‚Äôs mostly what I get. There are times I get less and sometimes I bomb out and get zero.  In fact the first game of the day is almost always a 0 or 1k.
---
Freddy is good for a lot of reasons. One of them is because his power is basically always active. It just transforms what it does. 
---
Stage one is his invisibility which allows you to get very close to a survivor before they run. 
---
Stage two is the transition phase. He blinks in and out of visibility which can allow for incredible mind-gaming. 
---
Even with the 7 second timer these two stages taken together almost always make for a quick first hit, often quicker then other killers cause you get closer faster, and even when it doesn‚Äôt it will almost certainly results in a wasted pallet. Often it achieves both.
---
Stage three is when a survivor is asleep and Freddy can track. His tracking is amazing and let‚Äôs you abandon chases if someone is looping you like crazy. You can come back and ambush them when they don‚Äôt expect it and don‚Äôt know which way they should run. Or if they wake up you can go through stage one and two again for that second easy hit.
---
Freddy is the only killer whose power is always active for every survivor in some form.  
---
His tracking allows for you to monitor what survivors are up to and by sleeping multiple survivors at once you can often halt or at least extremely slow gen progress.
---
Now Freddy does have his weaknesses as with every killer. 
---
Especially frustrating is the endgame where it‚Äôs true that those 7 seconds can allow survivors to escape. If playing with his perks you can get some help for it, but perkless you usually need to have a bit of luck in the endgame or survivors who are desperate to make a last minute hook save. 
---
That being said my games rarely make it to the endgame and even rarer do they make it that far with multiple survivors. 
---
It all depends on how Freddy is played. If you play him as a regular m1 killer you will lose.
---
They have gotten a lot better. I'm not saying they're perfect, far from it, nor do they respond perfectly to what the community wants, but there have been a LOT of changes just lately that are great for the health of the game overall
---
What he said
---
Or u know.. u can just dodge them instead of making a meme
---
I've had a lot of killers crashing lately, but usually at the start of the match or mid-attack through the match.
---
Imagine DCing against the lowest tier killer
---
Yep, 2 people spending 16 seconds to heal is the same as 1 person spending 32 in terms of objective competition time. 
---
Actually it's probably more efficient to self care as you can do that by a different gen and jump on that one when done. If you bond to someone, you'll be next to theirs and best case hop on that at a 20% effective penalty (compared to 2 individual)
---
This is ONLY really relevant when talking about objective times. Obviously there are many times having someone else heal you will be better.
---
The obvious best approach is to just not heal or bring heal speed increases of you must.
---
Usually Dwights for me.
---
So she built a temple in Russia? Idk, still seems weird, it's not like you can actually find this kind of architecture in Russia.
---
Nah. Just been talking to a Legion player who only played him cause he could tunnel people in Frenzy people for easy downs. Now he can‚Äôt do that so he things Legion is nerfed. 
---
Hard to injure 3 people as Legion smh
---
The survivors are immediately told the killer has ruin so they can quickly find it and can be easily countered by gen tapping or being good at skill checks. Noed has no counter once it pops the survivors find the totem or get fucked, especially on maps where the doors are close to each other or its a nurse.
---
I'd say streamers with 4k-5k hrs like OhTofu or ZubatLeL are pretty good and even they have a problem with MoM, it's not just 2.5k hr killer main scrubs like me that see it as poor design for the game mechanics. It's not just a situation of "git gud" or weak killers being weak. Spirit and Billy will have trouble with it too at Rank 1, because Spirit is still an M1 killer and Billy at Rank 1 is gonna be hitting a lot more M1s than M2s thanks to survivors smartly hugging to areas with plenty of vaults. 
---
I'm not saying MoM is OP because weak killers are weak, I'm saying MoM is overtuned because it has no counter and wastes far too much time when stacked 4x at Rank 1 much like original Decisive Strike back when it released. Have you played R1 killer lately now that everybody has it on their main?
---
Not just killers, but fucken Survivor PERKS HOLEY MOLEY
---
The developers themselves have also given up on that 2 escape and 2 sacrifice every game... At least according to their ranking system. You can have 4 escape and everyone wins (pip) you can have 4k and no one pip (incluing killer although I think they fixed and now killers only won't pip if they camp or its 3k...) Survivors can win and die and that is probably the hardest one to get into people mind, if you pipped you win thats it.
---
Of course they did do you not know what sub this is
---
That doesnt sound bad with double stacks. My idea before this was announced was to just deactivate the perk once gates get powered.
---
They kinda do 50/50 split on doing what the community wants.
---
Ty
---
How presumptuous of you sweetie üòò
---
Lovely to know that you took your own accusation as my word
---
Would it surprise you to know that I fucking despised people who tunnelled and actually played Legion the way he was meant to, and won 80% of the time?
---
No, you didn't, sweetie, because you're blinded by your own stupidity. But that's okay, we all need things to work on!
---
And to prevent anymore moronic ramblings from you, I'm blocking you after this message. So have fun being toxic and wrong somewhere else! üòõ
---
Thanks so much! Enjoy the rest of your day!
---
More likely to see them crab walking at opposite ends of the map:‚Äô)
---
All the people that do nothing but bitch and complain are the ones who downvoted you. This subreddit is full of complainers. Nothing is ever good enough for em.
---
I made the same comment when I read that the developers are going to nerf it. :)
---
BBQ and Ruin need a nerf?
---
Line of sight
---
Yeah.  I re-edited that part like 6 times and could not think of a way to make it read naturally, so eventually I just said ‚ÄúFuck it.‚Äù and settle on one of the less terrible versions.  Said out loud it‚Äôs fine, but reading it is totally fucked.
---
You can see scratch marks when OP turns around too, looks like they ran for the basement. So I think you‚Äôre both 100% right.
---
Omg that happened to me as well. I got iridescent in everything but chaser???
---
To be fair, most of what is on the left is really stupid.
---
Because it is an extremely powerful perk, allows for greedy and bad plays to be wiped away and unless you‚Äôre one of the specific killers who can reliably counter/check it, the end game becomes worse as you get punished for actively hitting people.
---
Again how is that not saying they should be equally powerful? Everyone here understood that besides you... if you're that bad at making your point then its not other people's fault.
---
Mostly due to the increase in MoM, dead hard, adrenaline and borrowed time/decisive.
---
Doc rework was great too
---
On one survivor? Yea, sure, I can agree. MoM on all four survivors? Who are all running adrenaline? I'd argue that is more obnoxious.
---
Also, like, Ruin and NOED have tangible counters; MoM does not.
---
"Hnnngg...Entity, I'm trying to hunt near the gens, but I'm dummy thicc, and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the survivors."
---
How does it make it fair? I'm hooked, saved, tunneled, then slugged. I play solo and can't really depend on others on my team often. I've literally had killers just stand over me till theyre sure the timer is out, and that's what the perk was supposed to prevent I'm the first place- tunneling.
---
I miss fast vault [grabs](https://youtu.be/SS3DvvOQI04?t=170). Back then killer could grab even a healthy survivor. They changed alot to make this game more competetive, faster and less horror/slasher.
---
explain
---
That‚Äôs sick! Plus she nailed the immersed Claudette lol
---
&gt;assuming you ship them
---
Now why the fuck is that an assumption anyone would ever make?
---
I don't recall this game EVER flaunting its lore, let alone referring to it as deep.
---
Then your survivors would get a good few jumpscares?  The chances of them facing the same killer over and over is extremely slim, so it would only effect your experience in the long run.  Nothing wrong with that.
---
Up, Down, B, X, B, X, Down, Left, Left, Left.

Uhm... Things being... How some perks need rework.

Here's a much cleaner, non-amp link. Please stop using amp.
---
I personally don't think he is bad, feral friendzy is useful to get everyone into the injured state, making it easy for you to get the next M1 hit. I would recomend Monitor &amp; Abuse on him to get survivors with their guard down, it helps alot on getting the next hit. Also with all of them injured you can use sloppy butcher, so that they have a higher penality to healing witch they normally do because legion is 115% movement speed. Last season i was doing pretty well as legion on rank 2, you just need to learn the classic mindgames on the tiles, those help alot.  
---
Here is a link of a video that shows how to use mindgames to try and make survivors make mistakes:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ&amp;t=387s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ&amp;t=387s)
---
If you mean slugging for the 4k, then people still want the 4k. 
---
Sometimes they killer doesn't know where the hatch is and doesn't want to risk a survivor getting lucky and finding it before they do. The hatch still abides by the old spawning requirement for visibility, so looking for it before slugging might not be an option. Then there's gate placement. Sometimes gate placement is shitty, sometimes its good. If its shitty and you're not playing a high mobility killer like Nurse or Billy, you probably don't want to force the endgame collapse.
---
The entity built the temple.
---
Ash pls
---
This. I bought Ash for Ash, if I just wanted the perk I would've bought it from the Shrine.
---
Survs can vault over pallets why do I need to be legion to be able to that, thats basically what you just said with your falling compassion, 
---
even with the stun from falling survs can still make window loops take very long to just get one hit
---
also survs have a perk balanced landing  that completey negates the penalty
---
killers have no perk that let them turn their camera while falling do they?
---
[Obligatory artist plug.](https://ecstaticasusual.tumblr.com/post/171093516705/this-is-not-everyone-but-i-tried-othelo-s)
---
I understand that, but there‚Äôs probably less then 100 Freddy mains, and the devs have been working on this rework for so long now, they aren‚Äôt gonna not so it at this point.
---
Hell fucking yeah, if the day comes where console gets 60 fps and no frame drops just like pc, then I can rest peacefully
---
Fortunately it'll be revealed in the next 2 weeks
---
I'm not easily tilted. they broke all the hooks and just hid with urban evasion and plus I'm venting I honestly don't personally think this I just need to let off steam.
---
Ok. If breaking hooks makes you mad then im sorry but you need thicker skin. Use hangmans trick if it bothers you that much.
---
Yet it's perfectly fine for every killer to tunnel any survivor who gets unhooked.
---
There are definite moments that can be tense for survivors. Can I make that window/pallet? Can I juke the killer? These are moments that can be tense and fun. The "high octane" moments are when the killer is chasing you. Giving the Legion the ability to chase everyone around for short bursts of time and put pressure on the final survivor to really out play a frenzied up legion can be tense.
---
if survivors shouldn't have perks that allow them to live longer, killers shouldn't have perks that let them down/kill faster.
---
The jab was moreso at survivors having perks that help them survive, comparing that to killers having perks help them kill. I didn't speak of their effectiveness at all until you brought it up.
---
and to extend that, it was more of a joke in a post about what I would assume to be...a joke.
---
Maybe because 90% of the people spam ResidentSleeper when they talk about lore in the stream ? This community is so ungrateful that I understand their struggle to get what we want.
---
It isn't fine to tunnel though. I'm it's honestly cuntish
---
Preach! Botany Knowledge is soo underrated. It makes up for self cares slow time, helps heal teammates faster and increases medkit usage. Fantastic perk!
---
Pretty much all you can do to counter Myers is don‚Äôt let him feed off of you as much as possible and keep your distance when he hits tier 3.
---
It furthers the split between the upper and lower half of the killers in the game more than the game already did. Killers with damage dealing powers could play around it more effectively/avoid it altogether sometimes while the other killers who couldn‚Äôt/their alternate form of damage is inconsistent had to put up with it. 
---
And it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúone person‚Äù kind of issue either. Mettle Of Man has little to absolutely no downside. Sure the ‚ÄúAdrenaline, Mettle, Insta Heal, Dead Hard BT‚Äù thing was a very rare case but the possibility of seeing 2+ in games were very common. Especially because there‚Äôs no penalty for non obsessions using it and it making you the obsession is still a non-issue. 
---
In a nutshell all Mettle Of Man has done at the low Purple/red ranks is further push people to playing Billy/Nurse/Huntress/Legion because guess what they have to deal with a lot less?
---
Who are these guys ex military ?!
---
1. Why u want to be close to a survivor before they run, and btw, dont u thunk the wraith do that way better?
---
2. Wraith can indgame with his default windstorm
---
3. Is not a weasted pallet if u dont get ur free hit, and the warith get a real free hit
---
4. Why do u want ti track if ur in a chase, and btw, self care makes u wake up very easy soo...
---
5. His power punish him more than helps him, 7 seconds is way too log, and btw, he cant run some good perks like overcharge because it counters his ability!!!!
---
6. U can sleep all 4, but u can chase only 1, lmao, they just wake up and they repair witouth problem while ur getting looped because his power doesnt help him on the chase
---
7. Ur saying that you need to play him with the right perks while u way u get 4k‚Äô perkless freddy lmao
---
And my final words: wraith, one of the weakest killers in the game has a better ability than freddy, same with doctor, he is weak but he is waaay better than freddy, freddy doesnt hace map control, his power doesnt help him on the chase, he lacks ln pressure( he gets gen rushed so easy) and a good looper can literally rekt him so easy, that being said, not me but 98% lf the comunity agree that freddy is the worst killer in the game, he is shit, and thats why he is getting reworked, a buff would not help him
---
AAAAHHHH I NEED A MEDIC BAAAAG
---
Nahhh, I've gotten killers who do nothing but slug at the beginning of the game and let everyone bleed out or face camp or tunnel me to no end..
---
you ignored everything I said which was factual
---
my point was survs can vault pallets and killers can avoid stuns from falling
---
different sides are different
---
survs have a perk the negates the falling penalty, killers have no perk that lets them turn while falling
---
which part of what i said wasn't serious?
---
Breaking all the hooks and urban evasioning is just so annoying plus this is just me venting. I personally don't hate them I'm just kinda mad because I can never seem to have a good game.
---
Ok, thanks, i was just wondering if they was anything i was missing.
---
It's pretty important for a community to be communicative. How else will the devs know what we want?
---
If these pallet changes go through, I can see Enduring becoming less common but still prevalent. I'm still pissed that Fire Up is trash though. It should really be 5-6% per generator so at end game it at least tops out over Brutal Strength. Then again, these are the potato devs that nerfed Thanataphobia for some fucking asinine reason, I swear to god these devs don't play the game at all.
---
If you put them on after the gens were already done, I think that‚Äôs by design. 
---
But if you put them on before a gen popped, I can‚Äôt say. It should‚Äôve been active so maybe a bug? Haven‚Äôt touched my Oinktress since the update. ):
---
Those people are cuntish but do you really need to do the same back to non toxic killers? I play nice and to have fun but I'm honestly just done with the toxic and just needed to let off steam
---
At least with Pig it didn't happen until over a year after her launch. Mettle of Man is gonna last less than 2 months
---
Oinktress haha
---
Even huntress :)
---
Thats a fair reason to be mad, shits cash money
---
He made a new one only based on the original. Good shit
---
It's part of the nerf to the Pig, so she doesn't become OP with the EGC.
---
Chaser.
---
Enough. Said.
---
Tell that to every killer on PS4 tonight. I'm wasting all my streamers and cakes to prestige and am tunneled off the hook. Killer will be in a chase only to double back and rehook me. 5 games in a row. In. A. Row!
---
It's more of a buff for killers in general since stun times are less now in general with pallets anyways you said it yourself, DON'T TUNNEL THE SURVIVOR NITWIT, if anything just down to poor bastard then go after the fool that unhooked them. I'm baffled players are still complaining about DS when it's virtually nonexistent compared to what it used to be.
---
I play around Discordance.  I hit as many people as I can in one frenzy then start a chase. As soon as Discordance pops, unless im jusr about to catch them, I drop the chase and apply pressure to the gen. Usually works very well at slowing the game and I usually get 3 to 4 kills. About rank 8 now from rank 15.
---
Gotta love those heart-pumping moments. I just had a game against a Freddy that made me anxious as hell. He closed the hatch and I waited at a gate for him to check. Halfway through the ECG, he hadn‚Äôt come so I finally went for the door. Dun dun dun, he had Remember Me. He did show up and let me keep opening the gate but the Entity took me just as I was about to open it. If only I had gone for it sooner. üòÇ
---
I left fortnite when it started to get popular, seeing all these streamers use stretched resolution, only to see dbd streamers do the same thing
---
I'm more terrified by looking at the title of "Teen Mom"
---
Numbers can always be adjusted and played with, what I'm trying to tackle are inherit gameplay issues people have with Legion. I agree with this build they would need to change back his standard and frenzied moves speed to what they were.
---
I think having no stun when intentionally hitting m2 would be too strong. We would revert back to a tunneling style Legion where it would be more beneficial to frenzy on first hit, catch back up, immediately drop frenzy on purpose then down them.
---
everybody gangster till they find out its prayer beads
---
Amanda = Goddess
---
If only King Kong wasn't too large - no matter which version we go with! Still, maybe some version of the Wolfman or some over animalistic killer, this idea could be pretty cool.
---
That sucks dude I hope you can actually have a good match but most survivors and killers think it's ok to be toxic. I just wanted to vent my anger because the community makes me really salty sometimes. It's just this community is filthy. there is barely any nice people left.
---
Great art! His hand looks so gnarly!
---
Such a baby man, it‚Äôs a design in game?? Play survivor then? You‚Äôre mad that people are breaking hooks and using a perk?? You need help seriously I‚Äôm not joking.
---
Mcote is an absolute meme lord
---
Lmao nice meme!
---
*Laughs in Franklin's Demise*
---
Billy hard to play
---
Hold down right click and down someone, oh you missed? 3 second stun
---
True but she's a teenager with supernaturally boosted strength it can at least make sense.
---
It doesn't matter how supernaturally boosted Chucky is he's a doll you can literally toss him around and there isn't crap he could do about it
---
This picture is already getting meme'd huh xD
---
Next killer Alice Cooper confirmed. Power: Welcome to my Nightmare, similar either to Doctor (hallucinations) or Freddy (dream world). M1 hits you with either dance cane or microphone. Survivor is Stephen. Map is some version of Hell.
---
I‚Äôve been running Resilience which has helped a lot, it opens the gate 9% faster at top tier which means the gate opens a bit faster
---
Dedicated servers will help fix these issues.  This may very well be caused by lag on either parties half.
---
Ash should be there instead of thicc johansen imo
---
Let's just say its an extra precautionary measures needed to be taken. Anyways, while I do know its powerful. Is it really not justifiable for people to make their lives easier with 2 one hit downs in the form of abilities and perks? Survivors use 4 perks that gives second chances and is that not allowed? Borrowed time/Self Care/DS, Dead Hard, Mettle of Man and Adrenaline. How is that not logical for you? I've played this game, every single time I take out a perk, it fucks you up really badly.
---
give It a few days. all the rank 1s got set back to around rank 10
---
Well without ruin the sound of gens popping in my ears is like Christmas bells, so unless there s another way to slow down gens it's almost needed
---
I play nice, I learned how to play through HybridPanda. I get so angry when people play with zero concern for the other players. I'm almost ready to uninstall the game.
---
If you're playing a killer without an instadown against good survivors that make you work for your hits then MoM makes a massive difference. At rank 10 you can just keep chasing and hit them because they're potato. At rank 3 it can extend a chase by fucking ages because they will run in a smart way. It also makes it important to track when someeone's MoM is going to proc so that you can decide whether or not to commit to a chase against them. If someone has MoM then you might want to just leave them and go pressure a gen or whatever instead of committing to the chase, but it's one more thing to keep track of (only thing making this easier is that everyone runs MoM now because it's the best survivor perk in the game at the moment).
---
I still find him fun, I just make healing unbearable for the survivors, makes gens go slower and everyone is one hit from being downed.
---
When doing gens, make sure you‚Äôre always checking your surroundings. Myers‚Äôs terror radiums is EXTREMELY small in tier one, which allows him to gain lots of evil if you aren‚Äôt paying attention. When in chases with Myers, try to break line of sight as much as possible so he can‚Äôt stalk.
---
I didn't comment on the validity of their ability, merely refuting the OP claiming that MoM was situational. Not sure about the purpose of your comment.
---
THIS! I don't think old Hag was fine though.
---
it doesnt matter where you put on the trap, but when.
---
See I agree w/ buffing WGLF but I don't agree with a Ruin nerf. Its a strong perk for sure but it's easily countered due to being a totem. I can't tell you how many times I've lost ruin only a minute into a match; I think Ruin is fine as it is, sure it feels bad when ran on Nurse or Billy but if you nerf it that just punishes the killers who actually need far more than it would those two.
---

Yeah I feel like the ranks that you can't lose pips in you shouldn't be put back into after rank reset either. New players just get farmed for a bit after each reset so it would be nice for them to have a few games against other new players before they hit 16. Although I haven't seen all that much teabagging at low ranks if I'm honest so that's a plus.
---
So they did do some optimization already! I thought the game ran smoother, guess I was right :) Awesome!
---
I'm just letting of steam not really that angry just salty. This community is toxic af. This community doesn't know the definition of kind or respectful. And I admit I wrote this badly but didn't need to call me a baby.
---
None of the licensed killers have music other then Myers ?
---
Well then this perk would just let you abuse farming your teammates mid chase. We need a perk that can detect camping, then it would allow not getting hit or grabbed.
---
1.- Assuming you know how Myers works: in Tier 1 be extremely alert and check every corner constantly, and pay attention to a loud breath, that means he's close to you. Try to break LoS and run as far as you can, he's very slow.
---
In Tier 2 he's just a normal killer with a reduced TR. Be very careful, try not to feed him to Tier 3.
---
In Tier 3: run and hide. If you enter a chase just be aware that he is faster and his lunge has a larger range.
---
If you can't break LoS and he is feeding just run as far as you can to make space.
---
2.- The queues will be better once you get to around Rank 15.
---
Yeah that's a thing now...
---
THEN WHEN YOU DO WIN AGAINST THEM, THEY ALL SPAM YOU WITH MESSAGES REGARDLESS.

2 for sure

Killers lore in a nutshell

2 and 1 together.
---
Jeff's arms give me *feelings.*
---
They are just ugly as all hell btw
---
He never said it was.
---
How'd doc get reworked?
---
It directly correlates to my increase in running Small Game or Detective's Hunch.
---
People playing video games unseriously???
---
Whaaaaaaattttt? Never seen that one before.
---
It‚Äôs not like they paid for the game and have the right to do whatever they want with it or something...
---
Eh I'm honestly so sleepy I thought it said that.
---
Right? Fuck *me*.
---
Not the hero we deserve but the hero we need.
---
I'VE HAD SO MANY SWAMP AND FARM MAPS IN A ROW I FORGOT YAMAOKA EXISTED.
---
2s head and 3s body
---
It's...It's a meme I used for internet points, my guy. It ain't that deep fam.
---
Well then I really don‚Äôt pay attention at all
---
Ok I get your point I've summed this up in multiple other comments thanks for the funny comment I guess though?
---
This is my culture!!!
---
IS HILLBILLY CHOPPED LIVER?
---
Next time you need to vent, find something else, work out, go for a brisk walk, punch a wall, something that is not public.
---
By venting on this subreddit, you have "fed the trolls", gave them the attention and the reaction they so desperatly want.
---
Not neccesarily the guys you played against but ALL the other toxic survivors who get their jolly of on this stuff or just "play for the lulz".
---
They perfectly understand how angry it makes you that is why they do it.
---
And you posting here reinforces their behavior.
---
his special power would have to be a step stool
---
Damn, I'm pretty sure it's only happened to you.
---
Ah, console experience is much different than PC; that's where the disconnect is happening. I've played a bit of console on my buddy's xbone &amp; it's night-and-day difference between the red ranks on each. 
---
I'm not against strong perks or add-ons for either side, I just want them to have some fun and appropriate counterplay, and would prefer the devs stuck to their original design for obsession perks being a high risk high/high reward bonus, like Object of Obsession or Dying Light. I've played since PC launch when some of the currently useless perks were even worse, so I'm definitely aware of the issue with useless perks. The buffs they did to several perks back around the Wraith Cube at least made many serviceable, especially with the right build. But that doesn't do you any good at all if you get the shit perks in your webs.
---
I DEFINITELY DONT LIKE HIM.
---
Hey hey everyone, though I am not from the BHVR I have looked inside the games files whenever the Scream/Ghostface things dropped accidentally and I did find files relating to a mobile version. The most notable are references to the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store. These were not in previous files but they are now in the leaked build: https://i.imgur.com/tJBaXU0.png as well as files relating to a Mobile UI: https://i.imgur.com/7r1I2sI.png
---
Feel free to call these images fake/doctored if you please but I already knew about this and I've only told few people about this.
---
*And* before you ask, yes this could be for the Nintendo Switch Version of the game, but I highly doubt it since you use a controller for the Switch. Ask questions if you feel free to and I'll answer them to the best of my ability.
---
But you can't lie, adrenaline is the superior offering to both the escape cake perk and clear reagent addon!
---
Stop posting this gay shit
---
David could probably beat the shit out of the Legion, but the Entity's stopping him, so
---
Thanks for the comment but my mind is slowly melting as I haven't slept so I'm not gonna do a full comment
---
Head on w/ quick and quiet
---
You come into my thread and call me names and I'm the asshole? Makes sense if you dont think about it.
---
Just gimme some David &amp; Jake and I'll be happy
---
Honestly, just give it a "gg ez" and a block if you have to. Survivors and killers can be salty both but there's no trying to reason with somebody that's flaming because you didn't kill them in the way/when they wanted you to.
---
Oh ok üòÇ ya call me a homophobe idc I think that gay shit is nasty af ü§¢
---
I just think the moment survivors realize that specially in SWF its just too easy to coordinate so it doesn't happen and it would just waste time like it does today... but idk
---
Dont play plague
---
Gain a token after attacking a survivor, after 5 tokens, shit on hand and proceed to fling said shit onto survivor, blinding them instantly and putting them into the dying state. No one will want to get them back up for fear of getting shit on them too.
---
I believe it is.
---
&lt;3
---
Lmao I just watched Scream for the first time to get ready for Ghostface and this moment fucking floored me
---
Find a better way to spend your time, man. lol.
---
I wish all of the other killers were balanced properly. And by properly, they should be at least as good as Billy.
---
There should be an automatic banning system for DCs.  
---
DCing when you get certain maps is not bannable, I've seen plenty of people do it(mainly on Haddonfun).  
---
You get banned for DCing too much, not for DCing on a specific map.
---
Where's the noob3 starter pack?
---
Not if they never go over the dc limit
---
I'm imagining a scene where Chucky drags a Survivor to a hook, and then the animation that plays is Chucky dropping the Surv, shuffling his way to the basement, pulling a step stool out of a basement locker, and then shuffling his way back to hook the Survivor.
---
My favourite part is stabbing a survivor, then having absolute silence cos there's nobody in range, then realising I'm a basic m1 killer that has to finish this chase now.
---
Hey, good on you for playing through the bad games instead of DC'ing like half the players out there these days. Like the other posters mentioned, things should even out in a few days. Until then, you may want to look up some Youtube guides in the meanwhile to help you with any areas you're having trouble in. (Running the killer shack, tracking, the chase, etc.) 
---
Best of luck!
---
Honestly I hope you are right. Sadly though I doubt it ppl are normal just assholes so I can still see ppl do it
---
The balloon was too much, I love it.
---
Change Billy's add-ons, that's all I want, insta saw is OP but in general hillbilly is the killer in the best spot rn
---
Well, I've never seen anyone complain about fall stuns till now. I've never thought fall stuns were anything anyone was against, but I guess some people are even mad at the simplest things.
---
Ochiido ragequitting on Entity‚Äôs Left Hand is still one of the funniest things I‚Äôve seen in this game.
---
Ah yes, like the "very soon" change to DS that took a year to get through
---
I mean... Same with wraith. Both exceptional at first hits, not so much the second.
---
I'm pretty new to the game but it's honestly so fascinating how the game has created such an "us vs them" mentality, to me it seems so strange to see the two sides arguing so much, when in the end we're all playing the game and one side *needs* the other in order to actually play the game. I think as a community it would be better to strive for good balance for both survivors and killers.
---

---
It‚Äôs a MGS comic I believe, that really exploded into memedom when they got the English VA of Solid Snake to say that line
---
I haven't seen this, can you link me it?
---
Wraith doesn't DS himself every time he uses his power and can use it to down people.
---
Yeah, voodoo magic.
---
As long as you aren‚Äôt DCing over the limit it doesn‚Äôt hurt you, but also DCing makes the game harder for other survivors if you‚Äôre soloing. For killer DCs, it just wastes survivor time while they find another match. But for people who DC just for getting outplayed, the countermeasures are needed because they reduce the overall enjoyability of the game.
---
Eh possible. Although in this case it does count as a full sacrifice when slugging does not.
---
Down them and count to 240 :)
---
exactly. in a good asymmetrical game, the outnumbered player should be in a position of power, something you only get with nurse or billy
---
Eh not really. Mending takes zero time to do and you can start as soon as you see them start to run to the next person.
---
I somewhat agree but, I think everyone in the community can agree,p that OchiDO is the biggest tumor on the face of dead by daylight
---
Also! This clip is from their web show called unnnhhh which on the YouTube channel wowpresents. They don‚Äôt always play video games, is mostly them discussing random topics.
---
Still time they're not on gens, + they have to heal
---
I agree that it should exist... I paid for almost every single chapter (except legion which I got just the killer) but someone coming in the game with that many DLCs can be pretty scary.
---
Although I will say, you DO NOT need any DLC to enjoy the game especially if you like survivor, you can just get the perks since they're all equal. Also if you want some DLCs its perfectly fine to get just some of them maybe on sales (which is somewhat common)
---
Probably because there was an increase in Adrenaline; both perks activate during the end game.
---
Also, since MoM came out, Survivors have been running 'second chance' builds such as Adrenaline, MoM, Dead Hard, + DS/BT.
---
Excuse me, a killer designed to use their power to break survivors and later down then should OF COURSE be punished for doing exactly that. Not enough m1s on a killer designed to not m1 much.
---
You take away peoples‚Äô welfare, they‚Äôre gonna complain.
---
You should mark out their name, it against the rules
---
It's weird how Survivor mains aren't acknowledging the reason behind the uprising of NOED. NOED has been memed and discussed about for awhile now on forums,. I doubt it's a coincidence that since MoM's release + second chance builds (i.e., Adrenaline, MoM, Dead Hard, DS/BT) killers have been running NOED in their builds more often.
---
well Camping is a dick move, but so is insulting people
---
He dared me to do it. I think I technically have permission. If it gets taken down, I'll repost with blocked out names
---
Meg is OG best girl and still best girl for me hands down
---
Blood warden+EGC timer ending= easy 4k, under very specific circumstances in which the survivors would have had to be real stupid and altruistic staying WAY too long
---
As far as Ruin goes, there‚Äôs at least two things I‚Äôd like to see. 
---
First, remove the pause on the gen progression when only hitting a good skill check. It‚Äôs bad enough that you lose 5% gen progression, but progression also pauses for at least a second or two. If you miss the great skill check more than once, it really adds up. 
---
Second, allow the good skill check  to count for points. It still sucks to complete a gen and be robbed of those points because you stuck it out rather than ran around looking for the totem.
---
Sooooo we‚Äôre just gonna forget that when the Halloween chapter dropped it brought Laurie with Decisive strike in 2017 which was the most broken perk ever and went unchanged for a year and a half to close to two years whilst on release killers were saying that it was overpowered because it was and it went unchanged because survivors were complaining that it was balanced because it was a counter to noed when survivors have had two counters to noed for a while. One being adrenaline and two which is the best counter to it, breaking the totems, both of which have been standing in the game for a while. So if you want to start complaining about killers getting their way about a perk that really isn‚Äôt overpowered but behavior decided to listen to them, you might want to check yourself.
---
This Ace wasn't that good, I was just bored so I camped and watched YouTube. This guy was at the exit gate, I chainsawed him and he escaped. Then he messaged me saying how bad I was, threatens to ban me and dares me to post on YouTube and Reddit.
---
Myers has built in exposed, and Billy's insta will usually be how you down people anyways
---
Personally, when compared to Adrenaline and MoM, NOED has the most (if any) counter play. I would personally like to avoid using it, as I'd rather have 4 perks active throughout the game than 3, but when chases are lasting so long (and thus, generators being completed faster), it's hard not to consider the perk as core.
---
I can't get notification from randos on psn cause I turned it off. Also it's not unheard of that psn bans you for you vulgar language.
---
I don't think punishing people with BP or Level is something good... It will just make them more angry, what happens when you make it impossible for people to play the game (by soft bans due to DC) you force them to relax and exit out that mindset that made them quit (or whatever made them quit). Which should lead to less disconnects, just punishing them with BP loss will just make them more angry and when they get pwned in game they will quit again because they're already angry.
---
That's just lag
---
well, doesnt really make Sense for the Ace to complain than lol.
---
Still Camping because you're bored is really annoying
---
You don‚Äôt have to like it but anyone can post how they feel about it ...and talk about it but you had the option to not talk about it yet you did ...does my opinion offend you? Do you need a safe space?
---
Don't think you understood... YOU will experience MORE disconnects with a system like that because its a stupid system. The system will PUNISH instead of TEACH the player that quiting is bad. There's no reason to try and make yourself look better by saying "If you can't handle your emotions", everyone quits sometimes. Either because they need it (legit) or they can't handle the game anymore (its a game, its supposed to be fun). By making the guy be unable to play instead of punishing him with MORE bad games you will do a few things :
---
1. He will not participate in games while he is in rage mode.
---
2. He will have fear that his account may be permanently terminated.
---
3. He will not be force to play shitty games to "repent" for his mistakes, therefore the game is not making him even more angry.
---
Probably because survivors have a history of being able to bullying killers?
---
Thanks for at least being honest
---
Our fan base is really dumb if they expect this to happen
---
The Blendette in the bush fucking destroyed me
---
https://livestream.clips.gg/GeniusBovineBatteryNinjaGrumpy
---
First video.
---
But...why? Was anyone complaining about Enduring of all things?
---
To say noob is toxic is definitely a strong statement. The word toxic is used too freely. If you want a toxic stream watch angrypug, you‚Äôll literally want to rip your eye lashes out. 
---
At least noob seems to really find the humor and light moments in the game.
---
You better post an update in a week OP we need to know what happens

---
You're not hurt at all by DCing in the current system so WTF are you talking about? I mean you should be punished more by DCing, why do you think you deserve more than all other players that you can just give up mid game?
---
What is a toxic game? Because toxic behavior is present in every single game, so if you can't handle anything then you shouldn't play. What level of toxicity does it need to reach to be okay for you to quit? I mean if you're being harassed I don't think you should be punished for DCing but you're not being harassed every single game and you won't get punished ever by DCing one game.
---
Myers's lack of blood makes him my favorite prestige because it fits his simple design. I honestly run _only_ the prestige mask and I love it.
---
I agree
---
Since when do games have to be fun
---
Punishment IS teaching, Also theres no punishment for low disconnect threshholds
---
Nobody would be unable to play unless they abuse the disconnecting, I'm stated some numbers, possible punishments starting at 5-10 disconnects which are still MINOR punishments but serve as a warning that more severe punishments are coming if the behavior continues.
---
1. Good, he shouldn't be playing when mad
---
2. He SHOULD fear that his account will be suspended due to poor behavior because at that point he will have disconnected from say 20+ games in a row, If he finishes games those negative soul points will diminish and return back to positive
---
3. He will be forced to play normal games not to repent but that's because how the game is supposed to be, You aren't supposed to disconnect because things didn't go your way, you're supposed to either escape or die.
---
Loved Dwight's scream at the end.
---
I'm not saying noob is a bad person it just bullying noobs is kinda toxic. I admit he is funny and probably is nice but his fans are like fucking sewage mixed with dead bodies just absolutely horrible. Also I heard angrypug is an asshole what does he do to earn that reputation.
---
Well yeah it is but there is no real way to punish it. Unless you literally send a ticket with his ID and proof that he did it and behaviour analyzes it (which they wont)... They will be banned automatically if they keep DCing over the limit but that limit is pretty fucking high (as it should be since this game is filled with "DCing" bugs)
---
We will make it pops
---
This is a _much_ better version of /u/GlitchB1tch's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bp44qb/dwight_i_dont_want_to_alarm_you/?st=JVPU7MLU&amp;sh=609b5de2). Not that I'm complaining though, this is super funny. Great work, OP.
---
Annd i forgotted to put my watermark on
---
&gt;Since when do games have to be fun
---
Ok I'm not even reading anymore, you're a stupid toxic person if you think that. No point in wasting my time trying to explain something this simple if you can't even read and you think games are not supposed to be fun.
---
True, love it
---
Oh i didn't know that someone made one before. I was trying tk be fat sk kc ould be the first one but well...
---
Don't worry, you still knocked it out of the park. &lt;3
---
OwO
---
I saved the clip and recorded it while I played it back so I can show my friends who were in game that didn‚Äôt see it happen lol
---
From this comment chain I think you just like to disconnect so you want to shoot holes in this great idea
---
Please stop playing dead by daylight your anger is unhealthy for this community
---
An excellent question - I haven‚Äôt found the answer for yet
---
Makes me wonder what this guys got going on in the schools boiler room.
---
Well I hope you sent him the link lol
---
Trust me, I will, hes complaining now about the post. It's pretty funny because he obviously didn't even read it.
---
I did, I'll make an update later
---
Lol imagine falling back on criticism by using the "Muh free speech" defense and making fun of others.
---
Lmao nice
---
Also, can we get a "The Dude" cosmetic set for Jeff?
---
Well I do have freedom of speech lol also I‚Äôm aloud to have different opinions from yours and I won‚Äôt let you silence me on them üôÇ.
---
Just find a fun killer, become a killer main, then once you get BPs and all the killer teachable unlocked hop over to survivor.
---
I just got back into survivor and decided I‚Äôm really good, especially since rank reset hit in looping killers all game and 360ing the hell out of them
---
I swear that person must be at least 12 to actually report someone for saying pussy
---
I asked how old he was but he refused to answer.
---
Good point, but the timer slows down hella when someone is on the hook, endgame doesn‚Äôt last for just 3 min.
---
Maybe like a 10% on the 2nd time
---
I have a lot of choice words about BHVR, but if nothing else I have to praise their commitment to this game as well as their art and design teams. They‚Äôre absolutely phenomenal and the skins only get better and better.
---
Nurse should be number 1.
---
Ok confirms he's 12
---
You really need to think about the other people in the game, they suffer so much from DCs. Actually braindead you think they shouldn't be punished lmao
---
They absolutely do not have to heal. It's a waste of time.
---
Is best in by?!
---
It‚Äôs the only good comeback perk killers have, when survivors have 5-6 and there can be 16 a game, you should expect it
---
They are funny as hell
---
this is how i always felt about the dark souls community
---
do you be a pretentious tumor every where you go or something
---
BRUH IF YOU THINK I'M STAYING IN THE GAME WHEN SOMEONE WITHOUT BT UNHOOKS ME WHILE THE KILLER IS ALREADY WALKING TO THE HOOK I'M ON OR IF SOMEONE DELIBERATELY BODYBLOCKS ME SO THE KILLER GETS ME YOU'D BETTER THINK AGAIN
---
There are plenty of streamers that DC on Haddonfield even when the devs are there.  
---
I don't think you'd get punished if you DC on a specific map unless you passed the DC limit.
---
I feel as though the killer has a part in that, if you hit a guy and he immediately unhooks right in front of you, they are both injured, why go for the guy getting sandbagged instead of the toxic one doing the sandbagging? You are just rewarding toxic shitty teammate gameplay
---
MORIS (AS AN ADDON) AND KEYS JUST NEED TO GO, PERIOD
---
They‚Äôre funny and all but it‚Äôs annoying to see them all over the subreddit
---
THAT'S NOTHING. AT LEAST MYERS HAS TO WORK FOR IT, UNLIKE BILLY. 
---
INFINITE TIER THREE *IS* BULLSHIT THOUGH
---
If they don't heal, they're giving legion perma tier III evil within...
---
Dark souls has a point you could have ignored his comment just like he could have ignored your post
---
As someone who plays about 50/50, killers are way more toxic. Especially lately with the end game change, been a huge increase in killers toying with downed survivors. Not to mention tunneling and face camping becoming more and more common.
---
Failing to mention that they didn‚Äôt kill pig either. 
---
This change is a killing change.
---
Pretty sure most killers would in that situation. No reason to risk DS and BT.
---
It‚Äôs not a tier list it‚Äôs who he enjoys playing the most
---
I'd love to have a Console Billy anytime I played DbD
---
No. I‚Äôm on console. And no need to be hostile. Nothing wrong with liking a game and calling it out for its flaws. Nothing wrong with calling the Devs out for repeated and continuous laziness and incompetence. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I frequently have to take breaks because of the level of crap from this game now. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not allowed to enjoy or like it when it does actually work the way it‚Äôs supposed to. What the hell kind of logic is that?
---

From this comment chain I figure out there are people dumb enough to think a game is not supposed to be fun. Guess we are learning things together then. Also I rarely disconnect and when I do its because of my country's shitty internet overall (or this game that is simply broken and likes to crash a lot). Never been banned for quitting (or by any other reason), not in this game not in any other I play.
---
I KNOW, BUT TOMBSTONE IS JUST LAZY GAME DESIGN THAT TOTALLY CONTRADICTS THE SPIRIT OF THE GAME.
---
2
---
And if they do heal they waste like 2 or 3 minutes of game. Legion can get a first hit far too easily.
---
I doubt there's a canon story about the lore. Things are like that because its just there. We wouldn't even be able to know how the entity came about or how it existed because it's gonna be mysterious. It's pretty easy to say they dont know how it the development of the entity is like.
---
They are going to adjust stun times when they change enduring, I would expect ds to go back to 3 seconds.
---
Even though I like the fsct that you don't need to know a whole deep story to be able to play the game, I would enjoy it if they sdded in more things. Like the new chapters actuslly adding chapters of history, or certain achievements unlocking parts of the lore.
---
That said though, I really just enjoy the game :D
---
Or. Just hear me out. Dont heal and work on gens.
---
Thankfully, I'm glad that they're doing what we want. It has been quite lacking with the amount of dev streams they have with us and forum posts. Super happy to see it back today :)
---
You want some fuk? I'll tell how to get some fuk
---
Step one fuck pallets and windows equip the following perks
---
Enduring 
---
Spirit fury
---
Bamboozle
---
 4 perk take whatever you wish
---
Thats because they can't afford to ban them... if they start banning people for DCing they will have to do it to everybody or its not fair. Intentionally Quitting the game is against the rules
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system
---
Although it does say to not report so they really don't give a shit as long as you keep it below their automated threshhold.
---
Could you not write an essay?
---
More like 30 seconds after all of the survivors dc
---
yeah that's annoying but let's talk about the killer closing the hatch, slugging you, and waiting for egc/bleedout timer to kill you
---
His power had no stun effect on the survivors for 3 seconds. All it did was madness, those illusions, fake palettes. That's it. The power then became "stun" for 3 seconds which unables survivors to do actions like unhooking and others.
---
Yeah i wouldn't say most but yeah
---
Yea you can still be a good Nurse if your console allows it. I had the Ps4Pro and she was okay with me, just can‚Äôt do super 720 blinks lol
---
I could but I'm better at way over explaining things than just telling someone they are wrong
---
My job as a killer is to kill. Their bad teamwork is not my problem. A easy kill is a easy kill. The toxic one will get what's coming to him.
---
I love how he asked for exactly what he got yet was blown away when he got it lol. Hopefully psn actually acknowledges he baited and just leaves it cause it would be stupid to punish when he went out of his way to message you.
---
So far you've done nothing to prove my idea wrong, All you did was bitch and insult me
---
Explain how I'm the toxic one again ?
---
Oh the innocence.
---
For real
---
Literally the exact same thing, I‚Äôve had hatchets go through armpits and in between legs. It‚Äôs really stupid
---
Key difference here is that I didn't tell you not to post, where you told people not to post things that you don't like. Do gay things offend you? Do you need r/deadbydaylight to be a safe space for you?
---
No one's offended by you, my friend. We're mocking you.
---
As someone who has zero clue on Drag culture, why does the one on the left look like their face is split into two different faces?
---
1. Why wouldn‚Äôt you want to be close? Being close before they run means they have less of a head start so when they fall asleep you can hit them almost immediately. With the head start a good survivor can easily start a chase where the first hit comes well after 7seconds. So I‚Äôd say in this situation Freddy has the edge.
---
2. Yes he can, as I said Freddy can be weak in the endgame so most killers are stronger in this one area. Especially playing perkless as I do. If you do use perks there are ones that can help with this. I prefer Freddy over wraith because Freddy‚Äôs stealth and tracking is better. Playing well with Freddy usually means there is no endgame.
---
3. By wasted pallet I mean a pallet that doesn‚Äôt slow me down or stun me. This almost always happens because the survivors don‚Äôt know where I am and throw it early or from the wrong side. I don‚Äôt always get my free hit but nine times out of ten I do, and I get both the free hit and wasted pallet I would say roughly half the time. Not sure what you mean wraith gets a free hit. You can see him coming so you have an early warning and know which direction to run. Unless he‚Äôs using the add on that silences his bell you can also hear him. That being said I know good wraith players and I recognize he can be strong too so great :)

4. When I‚Äôm in a chase I am tracking the other survivors. This allows me to know what they are up to while I chase their friend. If any of them start doing something I either don‚Äôt like or I want to take advantage of I will switch focus and go for them instead. As I do this I can now track the survivor I just left the chase with. Even if this survivor was a great looper they now don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and I can come back to them from a direction they don‚Äôt expect which is easy cause I know where they are and which way they are moving. Being able to track also lets me kick gens or break pallets before I go for the chase since I know where they headed. Self care really doesn‚Äôt make a big difference if I‚Äôm watching them and I see them healing I can go and interrupt them. If they wake up I know roughly where they were and can guesstimate where they will head. Even if I lose them often they are not healed by the time I locate them and I can resleep them and get the easy hit again.
---
5. 7 seconds is a weakness no doubt. Of course less wait time would make him stronger, but as I said with his invisibility he almost always gets a free first hit. I‚Äôd rather use a killer in which I can get my first hit rather consistently at the 7th second into a chase rather then one where I might get strung along for longer. Honestly an invisible killer that can hit quicker then Freddy does by default, would be too strong. I don‚Äôt personally like overcharge and don‚Äôt use it on any killers and with Freddy if I do choose to play with perks which I do from time to time I don‚Äôt use any perks that conflict with his power and I‚Äôm not bothered by it. We can go ahead and call the fact that some perks conflict with him a weakness though. As a side note since we are mentioning specific perks Freddy has built in deerstalker abilities :)
---
6. If you have multiply survivors asleep and your still letting yourself get looped your doing it wrong. To play Freddy you really want to bounce between targets. This allows you to stop survivors waking up or resleep them quickly if they do. It keeps them off gens as well. If a survivor is looping you abandon the chase and come back later when they don‚Äôt know where you are. Although people say the Freddy promotes tunnelling, he is actually the complete opposite when played correctly.
---
7. I didn‚Äôt say you NEED to play him with the right perks. I said that there are perks that can help overcome his weaknesses. 
---
Wraith and Doctor are stronger when you know how to use them and don‚Äôt know how to use Freddy. I personally know how to use Freddy and he is by far my strongest killer. I‚Äôm sure wraith and Doctor when in the right hands can do just as well, no hate to them.
---
Freddy has great map control and gen rush avoidance if you bounce between survivors. You can basically see where everyone is all the time react accordingly to stop gen progression or avoid someone waking up.
---
I realize the majority of the community agrees with you. I also believe the majority of the community have gotten use to playing in a way that works for the rest of the killers but not Freddy. Freddy requires a new way of playing. This causes many people who try him to assume he‚Äôs bad and abandon him before they understand and master him. I also believe that the bad rep that this has caused means that when people try him, they go into it with negative expectations which they feel get affirmed when they play him wrong.
---
I don‚Äôt believe Freddy needs a rework or a buff. Freddy is great, Freddy is unique, and most importantly Freddy is fun. I don‚Äôt know what this rework will be like but I‚Äôm worried it will take away the differences that make Freddy awesome and just turn him into another run of the mill killer.
---
I doubt your mocking me üòÇ it sounds like your offended and I‚Äôm not offended I‚Äôve seen this post many times and personally it‚Äôs like looking at someone‚Äôs throw up lol it‚Äôs nasty ü§¢ it‚Äôs unnatural and makes me sick and don‚Äôt worry people are mocking you as well  lol

---
Camping and tunneling is a ‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô strategy.. or rather, was. Because of the new ranking system you actually have to play fair to pip up. Camp two survivors while tunneling them and you‚Äôll still derank, whereas in the old ranking system you‚Äôd get a double pip
---
They're still one-hit-downs for the legion tho
---
Every time I want to try a new killer I get my ass beat, but then I go to my fucking go tier nurse build and I get a 4K, either I get no kills or all the kills
---
Riding like a real cowboy!

its also a really lazy copy-paste of Ju-On: The Grudge's story.

Can't wait for part 3 : Revenge of the salt shaker.

I think he blocked me, I messaged him like 5 times and won't answer.
---
Oof

When I started playing the game and I was against him, every time he stalked me I'd troll around because I thought they were memeing around/being friendly. Oh boy was I wrong.
---
Going to point out a few ways you are toxic :
---
&gt;EDIT Be wary to anyone reading below this, This guy is defending disconnecting
---
&gt;I think you just like to disconnect so you want to shoot holes in this great idea
---
&gt;Please stop playing dead by daylight your anger is unhealthy for this community
---
&gt;Since when do games have to be fun.
---
&gt;... Faster queues for not being a sore loser
---
&gt;I've been watching tru3 / monto on youtube 
---
Some are just you being stupid, others are just blatantly toxic behavior trying to hide under a good guy persona...
---
It's because of MoM.
---
The thing you an everyone else in this thread is forgetting is that they constantly leave little clues and details concerning lore and never expand upon them. That is what is frustrating. If they really can't or don't want to have even a kiddie pool amount of lore depth then why tease us like that in the first place? Either COMMIT to these little details or don't have them in the devstreams to begin with. Simple.
---
??
---
I laugh when I get hate mail üòÇüòÇthey say you‚Äôre salty that I looped you but they clearly were butt hurt enough to send me hate mail so YEET
---
https://youtu.be/sgC6rj6DB9Y
---
I-
---
You're defending toxic behavior in a game that would be better off it was removed, disconnecting is not something to defend it in itself is toxic to your teammates and the killer. 
---
You should not be part of the community, That comment isn't toxic that's my opinion and I stand by it. 
---
If you don't disconnect often then why are you defending it so hard?
---
Games don't have to be fun, That's a fact. 
---
I don't see how me watching streamers upload stuff on youtube is toxic ?
---
None of that is me 'being stupid' but that comment about me being stupid is also toxic. I'm not hiding under a 'good guy persona' I'm debating why and how disconnecting should be punished, You've decided to attack me anyway you can find and downvote all my comments. 
---
That's toxic and petty.
---
You've put no thought into any argument you've just been trying to smear me personally to devalue my idea and arguments, this is not how you change someones mind
---
Bottom Left Feng just shat her pants.
---
Mom needed a nerf personally I want to see it nerfed into the ground along with noed
---
We stan shirtless David
---
I reported a killer and sent in a picture of our messages where he admitted to insta dcing when we loaded in to waste our offerings. (4 man swf doing a slug and Kobe build with 4 salty lips.) Dev reply said ‚ÄúWhilst we appreciate your support for the game and your desire to make the game a more enjoyable experience, we must make you aware that disconnecting is not considered to be a reportable offence.‚Äù
---
No. That just shows the amount of time that this specific player has played the game. 
---
Survivors used to not have fall stuns. It was hell.
---
Your subjective, bias opinion does not equal reality. You use examples of survivors whining about killer perks. Nice how you conveniently forget killers whined about DS until it was made useless, and now Mettle of Man is also getting nerfed because of the whining. Stop talking shit. Both sides whine, don't even give me that crap.
---
This isn't a 'both sides' matter. Free speech = having a public voice, opinion, not a right to say anything you want without challenge or consequence. And, even then, 'I hate the snow, it's so cold' is one thing, 'I hate gay people, they make me sick' is another entirely.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Apply directly to the forehead
---
Toxic killers be like
---
Thats what you get for pallet waiting lolol bad play
---
It looks funny watching David struggle on her shoulder tbh
---
Tbh i think the devs gave it to the killer mains cause they were complaining to much, just wait at a gate they close hatch you have a 50/50 of picking the right gate to leave outta, it sucks you can get a crappy team who all DC or die immediately and most likely you‚Äôll die with them
---
Seriously the worst people. I hope they do something about it soon.
---
üòÜ
---
Oh right! I might watch more of them playing dbd haha I really like their reaction! Thanks for letting me know
---
Glad to see it getting changed already instead of in 2 years like DS. That perks a complete joke in its current state. Too strong of a reward for essentially no downside.
---
If it caused exhaustion the way it is now, then it would be alot more balanced.
---
And r/dbdgonewild
---
Ever wanted to see a chopped-up floaty corpse in a threesome? If the answer is yes, now you know where it is. If the answer is no...now you know where it is.
---
As annoying as it can be from the survivors point of view, I feel like camping during the end game is fine. Once the gates open, just leave. that's all there is to it. They had the option to leave, you just wanted to secure your second kill.
---
If it's super laggy I'll DC. If the killer is face-camping like an asshole, there's a chance I'll DC. Depends on how annoyed I already am at that point in the night.
---
I'm not sure how effective I believe punishing people with - % blood points is going to be when they're already willing to toss everything they made in a match because they got downed one time too many (or shards, etc).
---
"Lore" ...K.
---
Basically a Twitch streamer once said he was going to do resident evil playthrough in one go, without taking breaks. He fell asleep during stream while playing and almost getting to the end, the last several hours he was literally streaming himself sleeping while chat was going nuts about it and laughing their ass out.
---
Since then his face became a twitch emote for boring stuff.
---
Why do we teabag killers and flashlight them after pallet slamming?
---
Survivors: Why? Cause fuck 'em thats why?
---
Nope fuck em.
---
Can we get this Freddy skin with the rework
---
Spent so much money on a watch, now you guys can‚Äôt afford haircuts.
---
I truly hate the second two.
---
I'll probably misspell many times here... I'm typing mid games and I don't intend to check my grammar in a reddit topic, specially when I'm just messing with some jerk who thinks games aren't fun. If you can't draw the correlation yourself then you're dumber than I though.
---
It's not hard to test and learn how to get protection hits, and you don't even have to farm them on purpose to get 3 before you are DOH. 
---
There are players that main killer, or survivor, and then there are people that MAIN Huntress hatchet throws, or MAIN WGLF farming. Long time players, that know the mechanics inside and out.  You obviously think there is magic involved, or that it somehow being bugged once in a while makes this change IDEA the death of a perk. Lol
---
It's a cool idea, and makes it an altruistic perk instead of another oldDS or DH type selfish perk.
---
Well, yea he can‚Äôt do everything himself, but don‚Äôt act like he‚Äôs entitled to an escape because his team was completely dysfunctional.
---
Not his fault, but it's the game his team played. Consequences don't rely on fault - if some douche sandbags you, you're probably going to get hit all the same.
---
Says someone who's also annoying and seen all over the subreddit.
---
If only this was a reddit status
---
Naw it's for the best. Or he'll tell us to go play rocket league.
---
Whenever I see Trappers face I think of the evil shark sub teacher in Spongebobs boating school who didn't like eating in the class
---
You're not supposed to have a "good" chance to escape when 3/4s of your power is gone.  You're supposed to have a "slim" one.
---
Ok, this is great.
---
This really how it be for a Freddy main. I hope they make him fun and balanced for the rework
---
&gt;unreliable =/= hard
---
*explains why it's unreliable
---
*explains why it's hard
---
I am so glad you are going to shut up now.
---
Ok, so the make-up version of a Lady Ga-ga dress then? Outlandishly absurd for the sake of being as such and drawing attention? Got it.
---
I mean i have yet to die by the EGC. I just leave and you guys keep complaining like they are going to change it. Y'all get the hatch for free now and if close the hatch you get the door. I mean im a survivor main and i have no issues.
---
And I get that as a survivor the second you see you are getting camped it's annoying as shit. But I mean... taunt the killer = getting camped in my view. Hence why I dont taunt killers so they hopefully leave so I can get unhooked lol
---
WGLF farming is hardly about protection hits... glad you understand that.
---
Does anyone know what he's up to right now? Wasn't he Perm banned on PS4 and PC?
---
No the get good get better thing is ignorant, you can‚Äôt even deny that the end game collapse is Almost a death sentence for solo players. If you get stuck with a shitty team you‚Äôre guaranteed to die, and sadly it‚Äôs completely out of your control. The end game collapse is a literal slap in the face to solo players. now if he‚Äôs ‚Äúwhining‚Äù while he‚Äôs playing with an swf that‚Äôs literally all on him and his friends. So I am very skeptical on what makes you feel like you‚Äôre so much better than this guy?
---
Exactly what I'm talking about! I'm a solo survivor all the damn time and every time the end game collapses and I start to open one of the gates, in a matter of of seconds, the killer is on my a** and I haven't even opened the gate half way. Don't have enough time to play games with the killer and make it to the other gate to open. I feel like there's only enough time to open one gate (and without having to stop) give or take a few extra seconds to run to a gate. This is ridiculous already and there needs to be some common ground.
---
Who's sally?
---
Wes Krueger.
---
Want to nerf MoM simple make it a package deal with a rework to NOED.  It should have been that way with Decisive anyway.  
---
I'm sick of seeing my fellow killer players whine about the couple good survivor perks still left in the game while clinging religiously to their own untouchable babycrutch that they refuse to even have a conversation about.  Address both sides crutch perk or just stop whining and play the game.  We just got gifted a 4K everytime we close the hatch now against last survivor.  It's a good time to be a killer right now.
---
How am I supposed to even attempt at opening a gate if killer is just moving back and forth between gates until one of them has been touched by me and is now camping at said gate. 
---
Y'all talking about how this whole new game strategy was to prevent "survivors from taking the game hostage", but now it just makes this sh** ten times worse. Maybe it fixed the game from being taken hostage, but now it has caused killers to use it as a taunt.
---
Way to be a dick about it. You know with survivor you can be pretty good and get a crap team and be punished because of other people sucking. The hatch management is fine. The problem is the gates are to close to each other and the hatch.
---
Doesn't help that people wanna constantly DC but okay. One person (me) doing all gens, finding hatch, and not getting hooked!? Yea I guess you right and it can't be too impossible -____- 
---
You've gotta be kiddin me with this s***
---
The first 1978 Halloween movie is the only consistently canon one
---
yes but it sucks if im a survivor, what's even worse is because the wait time for a match. Kinda sucks
---
They might be perks in the future affecting the endgame.
---
I would sacrifice my wife's son to the entity for this one
---
I think we just have different takes on 'high octane'.
---
Facts. 
---
(Except I'm a she LOL) other than that, 100% and the whole end collapse for a 1 survivor left is total bs. I'm lucky I win one game an hour and every single game I have been left as last one standing
---
Well everyone has bad days, it happens. Today I switched out of killer because I wasn't hearing shit (ear infection + headache) and having shitty games, played as survivor just to relax.
---
Because DCs get tracked automatically, so there is no point in reporting them.
---
&gt; Coming from a Claudette main btw
---
Oh that explains alot. Was about to take you seriously.
---
I want ash just for the puppet hand
---
I'd love this option!
---
Oh yeah there already is I mean just look at remember me and bloodwarden . Timers perfectly and no one escapes
---
Me.
---
Not sure, I'm curious as well. I know he tried making videos after those bans by hiding his name in everything that he could. Not sure how well that went though.
---
I KNOW RIGHT. Survivors and there salty biscuits
---
What shift I've noticed for Freddy has only been a little shift (but then again, I use STBFL so I'm not as affected by it). But this should get changed, either way; he should only have the stun.
---
Ok now I need a mccote jumpscare perk.
---
Yeah, having to take 3 protection hits is pretty ridiculous.  Might be viable with 2, but 3, absolutely not.  It's also completely pointless with some killers like Legion and instadown killers.
---
I'm actually a friendly Myers and only recently I realized why won't people stay with me lmao
---
High ranks know its not safe, +post is dead
---
I will intentionally try to hit the guy who got farmed so the other guy loses his benevolent and bp (depending on how toxic the farmed guy is I leave or hook).
---
As a survivor I really hate when people farm me I may or may not intentionally get hit...
---
Yeah I get that, but to me, there‚Äôs a difference between people that consistently dc to derank or rage quit and those that do it intentionally on the odd occasion as a dick move. If the same person is dc‚Äôing to be a jerk, but not often enough to be picked up automatically, there‚Äôs no repercussions.
---
2 years*
---
But why??? I NEED YOU TO SATE MY NEED FOR LORE
---
Automatic DC tracking is supposed to handle cases by statistics. It really won't get the guy that do it sometimes to fuck people over. I understand that they may not have the man power for it though, also they did say it was not a reportable offense? Cause if they used that then I'm pretty sure they just think they can't handle all cases. Its bannable but not reportable (just like in the game's faq and rules)
---
Well don't think she would be OP but that's pretty much behaviour reasoning
---
This made me laugh out loud.
---
I picked up Huntress recently and that's what it feels like.
---
Wait, is he actually being serious? I legit thought this was a joke.
---
Never know he might be I‚Äôm not sure either
---
Just to add, lunge range is pretty much tied to move speed (although not the only variable).
---
tell me how thats easy to see? [http://prntscr.com/npnxl0](http://prntscr.com/npnxl0)
---
For real finally someone spitting some logic
---
Cum for sum round 2 then haha
---
And nearly every game I play, there's survivors teabagging and taunting the killer, not to mention the postgame chat that's frequently more insults and taunting.  I get facecamped and tunneled here and there, yeah, but it's far more likely I get survivors in my killer games that are purposefully being toxic.
---
Doesn‚Äôt justify how long they allowed legion to continuously ruin games before doing something, compared to how long MoM has been in the game.
---
Sabo is annoying sometimes but if you sabo I will slug and it will be a fair match...
---
I'm down. Also no homo
---
Spirit Fury is definitely a second chance perk.
---
I will say the game maybe is now overly focused on having a decent team. I must admit I am lucky that I play with on dbd who gets enjoyment and probably best skill is saves. Hes setup his perks to benefit others and as I am an all round player his boosts off his perks help me a lot. When playing solo I die more often after looping with no backup whereas with him he will take hits and give me time to recover.
---
This here is something I really wish the devs would address. Sometimes I just want to do some new builds and not be meta.
---
The comments are empty :(
---
Addons dont need a change, the mechanic itself does. If billy is going to be strong because of his mobility provided by saw, then make the first 2 seconds of the saw being active a state where he's revving it above his head so it can't hit survivors. You're still fast as fuck but if you're right in someone's face you can't cheese with insta-saw.
---
Sorry it just popped up for me, one sec
---
I have no idea how you could ever get some trappers to his level. The reality is the maps themselves need to be smaller if everyone is going to be as good as billy, otherwise it's impossible for the lower mobility killers to ever compete with him.
---
It only started for the trapper since the last PTB.
---
It really is
---
What rank are you playing? (Before reset)
---
Because every other match I‚Äôm in, people dc. 
---
I had a match not long ago that took 3 min in total. First person got hit, DCed, second person suicided on hook, third person suicided on hook and the hatch opened for me, so I escaped. 
---
It was the lamest match in the history of lame matches. Both the killer and me depipped.
---
The looking down to the setted trap? Pretty sure that is here for months...
---
So I queue up in Dbd, havent played in a while, starting to get back in the rhythym of killing nerds with my main gal, Nurse, when all of a sudden I get matched with a SWF group.
---
Alright, Im thinking, thisll be a challenge.
---
30 seconds into the match Im carrying that rank 13 to the dungeon, ezpz. All 4 survivors dc at the same time. Salty much?
---
And then look at that glorious matchmaking. Ranks 12-15 and Im sitting at 18 just before this match? Its perfect. /s
---
1, 3 and 4‚Äôs cloaks look pretty bad. I‚Äôll probably go for the 2nd body with the OG head.
---
Not super relevent to just Doc, but my best tip would be to not worry about kills to start. Focus instead on long chases, learn how survivors move around windows, pallets, and everything else. Sounds kinda obvious but seriously learning habits of people can help you mindgame which is more important than any build or killer imo
---
I was talking about which movies were canon in relation to the game.  (Spoilers)  The in-game lore for Leatherface picks up right after the credits roll on the first movie so that one is fully canon while the rest aren‚Äôt (since LF is gone),  Freddy‚Äôs in game lore takes place right at the end of his reboot movie (though it significantly alters the final fight) so it‚Äôs canon with the reboot just with an alternate ending,  and Amanda‚Äôs in game lore picks up right after her death in SAW III and since she has no involvement in later SAW films outside of flashbacks all of it can still be canon though only the first 3 are confirmed still canon in the game.
---
Meanwhile, Micheal‚Äôs in game lore says he escaped from the mental institution directly (not the bus) and was immediately picked up by The Entity, if his ‚Äúescape‚Äù wasn‚Äôt actually just The Entity just vanishing him itself.  So none of the events of any of the films actually happened according to the in game lore, other than Micheal‚Äôs general ‚ÄúKilled his older sister and was put in the looney bin‚Äù backstory that is universal to all versions of Micheal.
---
Love it!

-Accurate Summary of my last game of Betrayal: Legacy
---
Mate you lost. It happens. Accept you got a shot team and move on
---
As soon as you enter the game go into zappy mode, if you want to go somewhere where there are survivors or just want to go fast, go smacky mode. Your zap can make survivors unable to drop pallets/ vault but don't ALWAYS use it, if it doesn't work the first time it's best to just chase them. If you want a perk build, I use bbq, ruin, noted and distressing. Always have distressing it's pretty much the best perk for him.
---
You realize I'm replying to YOUR OWN "subjective, bias opinion" about the game, right?  Your experience isn't objective reality either, and I thought I said that pretty clearly and respectfully the first time around.  I had someone bitching at me about fucking BBQ being "OP wallhacks."  If you think old DS was fine, you're absolutely as biased as you claim I am.  DS as an anti-tunneling tool is a great change, and honestly I think it shouldn't have a time limit, it should de-activate after they're healed up by a teammate.  And Mettle has *not* been confirmed it's getting nerfed, so calm yourself until something actually changes.  Do both sides whine?  Yeah, that's just this goddamn community, but killer sure as hell aren't the ones whining all the time.  Just scroll through this subreddit on any given day to see survivors demanding NOED removed entirely from the game.
---
I mean that sounds like a connection thing if they all disconnected at once.

I guess its possible, the timing was just weird. All the pings were green beforehand
---
I have a request for you, Reddit:
---
Would you kindly make an r/perfectlycutscreams for this?  I am an inbred troglodyte incapable of using even the most basic of technologies.  Also I‚Äôm lazy.
---
Your in luck wraith is already partially visible while cloaked
---
Rare breed
---
It's not luck tho when the game is now set up where majority killer wins
---
What? Im saying the connection died and they lagged out is most likely
---
This so much. So tired of shotgun billies just getting right up your ass to instasaw you because they can't miss on PC.
---
OP are you serious or is this a shitpost?
---
its becoming the meta what else are killers supposed to do about all the second chance perks but run their own
---
Use an og survivor with default bottoms, head and a p1 shirt. Anything else runs the risk of dodging
---
Honestly it's not that hard to beat wraith as long as you are all working together gen rushing him, also idk if it's just me but he is really easy to see for me I can see him coming from a mile away and all you need to do to counter him when he uncloaks is get to a pallet and if he uncloaks all the way you drop the pallet and loop him till he breaks it and then go to the next one. And repeat this till he hates himself and leaves you.
---
Well I'm high rank and I do it when I'm saying to come get me
---
I'm by no means an expert Survivor player, but a few tips...
---
1) Check your perks! Although a loadout isn't everything, there are some Perks that can be pretty damn helpful. I'd recommend Self Care for all newer players, and then any Exhaustion Perk: Sprint Burst, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, or Lithe. Probably one of the latter two, but everybody has their own taste. There are just some perks like Deja Vu, Slippery Meat, etc. that you really don't need to be running, too.
---
2) If you want to "escape" a chase, the #1 thing you need to do is lose the Killer (duh.) There are a few ways to do this, of course, some of which involve Perks. Urban Evasion is good once you break line of sight with the Killer, because you can try to crouch around to places he isn't looking until he eventually gives up on you. Quick &amp; Quiet is good, particularly against newer Killers, if you get far enough ahead, break line of sight (seeing a pattern here?) and sprint into a locker. This won't always work and isn't necessarily the best strategy to get used to, but it's there. Diversion is a good distraction if you lose the Killer for a moment to make sure they stay away, giving you time to escape. Long story short, whether you use a Perk or not, you want to try to get ahead in the chase, break line of sight with the Killer, and do something to make sure you're not where they expect you to be.
---
3) Escaping a chase like that isn't very easy, and won't happen all too often, especially against more experienced players‚Äî instead, you want to focus on prolonging chases as long as possible in order to give your team time to do gens. Part of doing this is often using an Exhaustion Perk, as I covered earlier. Even without an Exhaustion, though, you should still be able to loop. I'm sure you're familiar with the concept, but you want to find somewhere with a pallet or window and run around it as many times as possible without getting hit or dropping the pallet, then only drop the pallet when you absolutely have to in order to avoid being hit. You should almost never be dropping a pallet as soon as you get to it. This is something that will just take some practice to get used to, and that you'll start to pick up the more you try it. Another Perk that can help out is Windows of Opportunity: not the best Perk in the game, but can help you get used to where pallets and windows are for during chases.
---
4) Watch others! When you're playing Killer, try to pay attention to what the "good" Survivors are doing. You'll be able to pick up some looping by doing this, at the very least. Obviously if a Survivor loses you, you can't really tell how, but it's still worth learning from others. On a slightly different note, try to find some YouTubers and/or Twitch streams you enjoy watching, and see what they're doing. Just watching them will familiarise you further with the maps, and will also hint you into where some good spots for looping and chases are.
---
5) This is probably obvious, but practice, practice, practice! My number one suggestion is to try not to be super immersed in games. Although it can help in the short term, you're never going to get better unless you engage in some chases with the Killer. I went as far as using Object of Obsession when I was learning how to loop so I could purposely start chases, but if you don't want to do that, just don't be afraid to take them on when they come to you. Try to practice looping even if you're unsure of what to do. It's the only real way to figure out what does or doesn't work for you, and when you start figuring that stuff out, it'll be more than worth it.
---
That's pretty much all I've got. If you have any more specific questions about anything, feel free to ask! I'm always here to help out my fellow people of the fog. :)
---
No, that's another drag queen
---
im not saying it was aliens but it was definitely aliens
---
Wait what
---
Get some blood points, get some add-ons, study them, see what fits your playstyle best. Studying add ons are very important for all killers, but with the Doctor, you can't just skim stuff.
---
That's what a Claudette looks like when they are seen by the human eye. For reference, this is the first time a Claudette has been seen.
---
The killer wins if the gens arent powered. I dunno how you consider hatch a win by any means. Im glad it exsists but its a pity escape
---
She needs a big buff to her crouch and ambush tbh
---
Whats the day 97 mean?
---
I'm not sure if this is still a thing, but very occasionally, when the guy who made the SWF group leaves, it DCs everyone.

However, I thought this was fixed AGES ago

---
Dang, I've only got about 4 or 5 4ks as Freddy, and I've been playing him solely up until now (P2)
---
Sometimes I'll accidentally hit the person just unhooked. Generally I'll just continue to chase the person who unhooked them. I'm new so I'm not accurate. Same with playing survivor and trying to run. Sometimes I'll run into teammates and I'll just turn back on the killer and take that L.
---
Right? I‚Äôve incorporated small game into my everyday build because of the noed uprising
---
Nobody would use that if killers would stop tunneling / camp with 5 gens up. That BS increased once ranking up with killer isnt easy af anymore. If Killers are a dick I bring my strong BS too.
---
I can tell her my password anytime
---
This, the only thing that matters for survivors is perks (and skill, but you get that by playing) and you can just buy those with shards.
---
Sad day :(
---
Are you really that annoyed by people saboing hooks? I honestly thought you were going to complain about teabagging, purple flashlights etc.
---
I thought it was Meg's giant forehead
---
NOED and Blood Warden because killers want to take advantage of the endgame collapse.
---
I dare you to play Wraith or Freddy against 4 Survivors with MoM+Adrenaline. That shit is frustrating :)
---
Killers should play as survivors for a while. I think they'd stop whining about how not every game is an easy 4k. 
---
(Also survivor mains should try killers, too)
---
If anybody in the comments wants to give me a justified reason to DC in any scenario you¬¥re welcome to try and change my mind.
---
quite simple prioritize hits over shocks, practice some mindgames and try your shock on certain loops, ah and dont forget to switch to punishment mode when in chase your speed increases.
---
The livestream was ruined when this man walked in.
---
I have noticed exactly this for a VERY long time. I consider myself pretty objective as I play both survivor and killer (and am great at both). Killer mains always complain about how the game isn't always completely easy for them, but then they call survivors the whiny ones - but I see killers doing the whining MUCH more often.
---
Yea cmon yo
---
There wasn't a massive age cap but there was the AOC gap and people call him a pedo for that.
---
Just look it up it was literally everyone months ago.
---
Okay I'd like to spectate whatever games you're playing there
---
I was using self care, but got to lvl 40 and switched to nea so I could use urban evasion, those 2 perks were ones I knew I wanted to use, I think map knowledge and knowing where and when to loop are my biggest issues, because I often seem to get caught just running in a straight line or circles around a tree in hopes they misss me and hit the tree. Thanks a lot though.
---
Just play vs wraith more, unless its some wacky perk/addon build the wriath gets looped like a bitch, pallet stunned and his perks arent even that great. Also if you try turning on your monitor you can usually spot an invis wraith from a mile away
---
1. While Fixing - When you are at a generator, keep your head on a swivel and most importantly - **plan your escape**. ("If he comes from that direction, I'm gonna go over there" and vice versa). 
---
2. Experience - there is no greater teacher, and that's doubly true for this game. After a while you'll start to figure out maps and good looping spots to keep the killer busy. One example of this is the "killer shack" which appears in all outdoor maps (so not Lery's Memorial or The Game). There is a window and a pallet in a square wooden building. Experienced survivors can sometimes keep the killer busy there for a bit. You will also learn the difference between safe and unsafe pallets. A safe pallet - from the survivor perspective - is a pallet that *has* to be broken by the killer. A good example of this is the "killer shack" pallet. A good survivor can keep a killer looped indefinitely between the pallet and window if he plays it right. An unsafe pallet is one where the killer can close the loop and catch the survivor without even breaking the pallet, whether through mind games or Bloodlust.    
---
3. Perks - I always suggest **Premonition** (Get an auditory warning when looking in the direction of the Killer in a 45¬∞ cone within a range of 36 metres) or **Spine Chill** (Get notified when the Killer is looking directly in your direction and standing within a range of 36 metres) for new players. It gives you a sense of where the killer is and if he's headed towards you. Need to create some distance between the killer and yourself in chase? You want **Sprint Burst**, **Lithe**, or **Balanced Landing**. Want to know where pallets/windows are? You want **Windows of Opportunity**. 
---
Cater your build to your playstyle. I currently have all 65 tier 3 survivor perks on one character and I'm not gonna lie - it is a huuuuuuuuge grind to get there. You just gotta use what you can from the bloodweb. 
---
If you have any more questions feel free to ask or message, I'll try to help any way I can. Good luck in the fog.
---
his glimmer is hard not that hard to see and his footsteps are loud asf
---
As a killer, I have never had a problem with DS. It seems realistic to me - I mean, if an attacker tried taking you somewhere, you'd fight back. And it was only a one time per player per game (and not guaranteed every game). It wasn't a big deal for me because I could just get the DS survivor later in the match.
---
I was just telling that sometimes there isn't much I could do even if I didn't want for killer to switch targets
---

Vile Purge Broken currently doesn¬¥t count as hits which has been an issue before and is back now. It¬¥s kind of dumb how some killers can perform amazingly and still get no pips for it, while others get all the points just because of how their power works even if they play like complete garbage \*AHEM\* Legion \*AHEM\*
---
Toasty!
---
I play both and it is the reason I would prefer a multi-kill system instead of a multi-hook. The multi-hook system is pretty much the harbinger of all suffering in this game.
---
This is a topic that's been discussed a lot, and I know there are some varying opinions, but IMO, the Bloodpoint "balance" if you will is fine as it is. Quite frankly, it's a lot harder to play Killer. If you're playing Survivor, you have three teammates there to split the work with you. If I need to go AFK for a minute to do something, I can just go kinda hide somewhere until I'm back and know it won't be a game over. As Killer, if you go AFK for a minute, the Survivors have popped four gens and the game is literally just about over. Overall, Survivor is just a lot more relaxed, and you're splitting the work with others. A bad game as Survivor is also over as soon as you die. No matter how badly a game is going as Killer, you have to play the whole way through until all of the Survivors have been sacrificed or have escaped.
---
Killer and Survivor are just two totally different experiences, and even as a Survivor main, I feel the Bloodpoint difference (which isn't *that* major in the first place IMO) is pretty fair.
---
You can't camp the hatch with less than 3 gens done, because it doesn't *spawn* until 3 Survivors dead.
---
I once had a doctor match where i got kinda destroyed and wrote gg and all 4 of them started spamming gg ez at the same time it felt pretty bad ngl
---
It's so odd they came up with this Assassin's Creed-looking outfit, added athletic-type stripes, and then decided to also introduce those vibrant color variants reminiscent of color choices in a Nintendo game. It seems so weirdly far-removed from the authentic Ghostface idea of a plain black Halloween costume robe. And that's not to say it looks bad, not at all, but just like a weird design choice. Wonder whether the backstory for this in-all-likelihood-original character will lend some explanation to the get-up. The levitating strips of fabric certainly seem like there's some actual ghost quality to this character, albeit probably Entity-induced.
---
That said, my picks for cosmetic choices would be outfit #2 with the prestige mask, the white Steam-purchase variant with the default mask, or the red variant with the devil mask.
---
Endgame is not suppose to kill survivors, just to make them leave in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Yeah!
---
I found the dude who secretly wants a dick in his mouth, there's always one!

Or if I play huntress and they use haddonfield offering you can be sure I‚Äôm dcing. No fun in that(don‚Äôt let me start talking about BL...)
---
She worships a goat, who even knows what her reasoning is.
---
Dude your edit's wrong. It's changed from a 75% increase in stun recovery, to a 50% reduction in stun time, which is a buff not a nerf.
---
As someone who never teabags, and barely can loop now because of hit boxes being a mile long. (I used to be able to 360 *sometimes*) I've never been camped more in my life than these past few months. Especially with killers having a Noed. 
---
If you pallet stun them ONCE or play Claudette/ any other character that's memed as toxic, you get camped.
---
Sure, do that, can just go back to slugging all of the survivors
---
Fake pallets weren't a thing until the update.
---
The add ons that give fake pallets now used to give shakey skill checks.
---
Get the perks you want as teachables, play as default dwight with said perks, profit ü§£
---
you seriously see this killer sided?
---
okay, let's look at facts.
---
there are basically two types of endgame collapse as in one survivor sided, one kind of killer sided.
---
first one is when two or more people are left on the map. you now as killer have all these sounds and red shit around that makes it really hard to hunt someone down. only prediction skill and experience (or survivor mistake/your luck) can give you someone hooked. it's really annoying as killer to be in all this cacophony of sounds and red stains on the ground. plus protecting the hook gets harder.
---
the second one is also not entirely killer-sided. why? well, because sometimes you're lucky to find the hatch first. or lucky to have the hatch far away from gates so you have the time to open them. it's all about luck here. at the same time, don't forget now you can get the hatch even with 0 gens done. that is really unfair to the killer who did a good job preventing gens from being done. like, really unfair. i got the hatch as survivor when me and team failed drastically way too many times already. and as killer pesky stealthy survivors got the hatch or opened gates in my games way too many times with like just one gen done. this new option actually denies me my fairly earned 4k and gives survivor 6k+ bloodpoints. 
---
but doesn't matter how actually unfair it is to the killer because now i'll never have a cunt to hide around for over 10 minutes and not touching a single gen just out of spite. i'll gladly take 3k instead of earned 4 to never experience the trash holding my games hostage ever again.
---
SCP-096 seems to have breached containment.
---
Yeah. Apparently what I was talking about was when it spawns in the match but you cant see it. I thought that it just spawned now but that is incorrect.
---
to play freddy I recommend is it discordance or surviellence those are nice to fine survivors, the strategy is to pull them to dream and hit them once, if they know how to loop, leave and find others, with discordance or surviellence. the trick is to juggle between survivors, while the injuried person is trying to get out of dream and heal, you are on the other hand attack other people, thus slowing down generator progression. if you have nurses, you can use it to dream transition mind game the injured survivor, getting the down hit. but freddy getting rewind so this is basically useless
---
He's not actually faster in T3. He lunges further and vaults slightly faster, but his movespeed is the same. He also vaults very slightly faster in T2
---
That is not a good attitude at all. A "shitty map" means different things to different people. For you, it might be the swamp, for someone else, it might be the game, for someone else, it might be the asylum. Eventually you have people disconnecting every game just because of (insert shitty map here). Same thing apples to certain builds. You might disconnect(killing yourself on hook is the same thing) for prayer beads, someone else might disconnect for Iridescent King and then it becomes clear why there are so many people just quitting the game.
---
This. Makes all the other advice here look like it was written by "gg ez baby killer."
---
You forgot my favorite hag cosmetic... The one where her head is made of God damn cabbage.. I've dropped a few head of cabbage in my day and 0 would still be together after dropping a pallet on it. Decisive strike should just turn Hags head into a bowl of lettuce and she's now blind but can throw crutons at survivors to slowly exhaust them.
---
Mad grit Agitation Iron grasp Save the best for last
---
You really only got it for ash? I got it for micheal and then ash popped up as a bonus later. I want alien in the game. Predator has had a few games hes been in. Predator games. A AFP game. Mortal kombat. That one military shooter? Idk what it is called. He was in cod too. Its happens but after the predator game I think they may hold off of licenses for him. Kind of like Jason if they didnt have a suit going anyways. Alien though has a mobile game as its latest installment I bet they wouldn't be hard to licence one. We already talked about it on 9ther threads and it would fit the lore. The drones only work for the queen to help reproduce. They are also aggressive and just kill. If a xenomorph got dropped into the entity's realm it wouldn't ask questions it would just hunt.
---
Billy needs something like fuel in his chainsaw now. Somewhat like hatchet count for huntress. 
---
His power gives him mobility and one shot kill without any cooldown besides the rev down animation. At least it would require a bit more thinking instead of brainless spamming.
---
Since they reworked tinkerer the instachainsaw is less lethal but any good player especially on PC will land almost all of their hits since you have too much control while revving.
---
Oh, the state of this community... although it's nothing new.
---
Pig=upvote+jumpscare
---
That's a great idea for the OP add ons. But there isnt a lot to charge is it? The addons for items dont deplete the items charge does. Would their power run out at some point?
---
Holding the game hostage is making it *literally impossible* to end without disconnecting. Collapse Kills look cool, and if the timer's already low I'm watching that cervix get pierced.
---
I was waiting almost 15 YEARS for a new Evil Dead game. Ash got leaked for DbD and my first thought was "Better than nothing".
---
I never said those things weren‚Äôt op or needed removed, my comment was more towards whenever survivors have an issue with a strong perk or mechanism, like noed, hitboxes being awful, getting smacked through pallets etc the hardcore killer brigade flies in straight away with the ‚Äúentitled survivor main gitgud learn 2 play!!!‚Äù. I‚Äôm just pointing out the hypocrisy.

Weren't they talking about making one at some point? They should make it a Asymmetrical horror game for him. One ash vs 4 deadites.
---
No, because majority of add-ons aren't strong enough to have charges and the add-ons which are strong enough ( Omega Blink Nurse, Instant Saw Billy, Prayer Beads Spirit ), should be balanced in other way.

or someone who likes zebra pants and hype shirt on nea.

&gt;The game is being held hostage, it just isn't indefinite

The very definition of a game being held hostage requires it to be indefinite.

There's been rumors of a VR game but that's about it. And I don't really like the Asymmetrical Evil Dead game idea tbh

It could work. Just make it where enemies respawn like on l4d. So you go through battles or something idk. Just a thought.

The way I play against Myers is to be the one stalking him instead. I just start up a gen and move to a distance where I can see the gen and wait for Myers to go to it. Then I watch what he does to figure out how much time I have to do up another gen and set up another bait for him. Most killers will search directly around a working gen to make sure survivors are not just hiding behind a rock beside the gen or something, that's more time for me to do whatever I want to do. I also run spine chill so while I'm doing gens, once it's active I know I have to quickly set up the bait and move off to avoid getting caught in LoS.
---
Drag queen killer when?
---
Thanks and the only person I've really played is Dwight but I'm thinking about changing so I can get balanced and self care as a teachable.  
---
I mostly play killer so I'm applying what I've learned there, like in a chase I used to get caught out by survivors turning a corner and just stopping, which made me realise sometimes staying still is better than running as soon as you see the killer.
---
It makes you lose Bloodpoints, and that's enough motivation to keep me in.
---
Man, someone didn't read the patch notes but went straight to complain!
---
Would‚Äôve gave gold but the 2nd panel is a post for ants
---
Cause shirtless Myers is like a diluted ricardo and that motivates me... don't judge
---
Concept is a lot of fun but survivors would just run as soon as they saw eachother
---
Thank you for your response I can see how it has some upside! I just don't understand how any of the add on's are good. I feel feral frenzy doesn't put pressure on survivors like it used to do you have any advice?
---
Angrypug earns his bad rep from normalising teabagging and playing how he wants to. (He hasn't done anything wrong.)
---
Mission failed. We'll get'em next time
---
So killer's are bringing Ebonies once they realize it's Ochido? AWESOME!
---
Ugh, I wish I could get fucked by these two together.
---
# GAY BAD
---
I think if you add charges to killers' add-ons, you need to allow them to keep not fully used add-ons after the game, just like survivors' ones.
---
Queer culture at its finest. üòõ
---
I'm about to blow your mind: Cleanse your god damn dull totems and then you literally NEVER have to worry about NOED ever again.
---
None of the killers in the game are a dead killer. Obviously some are better than others, but all of them are playable.
---
Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Especially with the right outfits (I'm looking at you, Claudette) those corners can be ridiculously good to hide in when it comes to less experienced Killers. Eventually as you rank up you may find that working less often but TBH, I say go for it until that happens. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
And np! If you ever have any questions about the game or strategy or whatever, feel free to hit me up!
---
But that is not the fault of MoM, those killers are just bad while nurse and billy are op. Instead of a nuanced take and fixing those AND MoM they just nerf the perk. I dont get it.
---
New map: Sleepy hollow
---
I eventually messaged the last two survivors and told them they can just fix one and go cause it was taking forever bouncing between all three gens and seeing no progress get made. 
---
Stop three-genning yourselves.
---
Actually the devs specifically said non humanoid characters (They were talking about the fan idea of a spider killer iirc). And I believe Xenomorophs are humanoid enough to be in cause they are somewhat similar to the Hag (design wise anyway)
---
Because its easier and faster to change a perk than actually trying to balance killers and core mechanics? *shrug* Dont get me wrong, Im on your side with that opinion but let's be realistic, the devs rather choose the "easy fix" in that situation.
---
\&gt; We also¬†realized¬†that some of our killers hit animations were not matching the attack cone which created the impression that the hit should not have registered when in fact, it did¬†(or vice-versa).¬†We have reviewed most of the animations and the adjustments will be released in the next update. This is the first step of our upcoming work on hit registration. 
---
I smell a nerf coming up for pig, legion, shape, basically anyone with a shorter weapon
---
As a 3-gen doc holy shit I'd cream my pants if I saw that.
---
If it bleeds...
---
Thanks :D
---
Personally I hate Mother‚Äôs Dwelling much more. BL is straight up overpowered in Haddonfield but at least you can ambush gens without there being juking cover on demand, and mindgames with the house drops 
---
If someone knows how to loop both the buildings on Mother‚Äôs Dwelling, between that and all the pallet loops, I just can‚Äôt catch them
---
Yeah if course it is but Licensed characters a given, in the lastest community poll thing they did few weeks again iirc they asked if we wanted more licensed killers. So they are wanting to bring more in
---
Wait, how was Noed nerfed? They buffed it a while ago by giving the first two levels the Exposed effect and now Endgame buffs it too. 
---
Did I miss something? Genuinely asking, not trying to be an ass or something. I know it wasn't an Hex before (full time Noed was rage inducing) but yeah
---
Me, on the verge of tears: please guys, theres 5 gens left we need to repair a gen in the  middle so the last 3 gens are spread out

If I had a unfair match I wont have any blood points i will derank and lose my item. I dont want to be a person who disconnects but sometimes that's what happens. You can be mad at me but be mad at the reasons me and other people feel like they need to do it. Camping. I literally only do it right before I'm dead on hook to help waste time. I refuse to play with campers though.  I didnt buy this game and all of the dlc to not have fun. I dont try to leave early and screw my team so I dont see how I could offend anyone here. I wouldn't be in a match after that anyways if it's my last hook. I mainly just dont want a -1 pip and to lose a rare item without the chance to play a actual match.
---
I would pay so much money if she went YAAS in deep voice after a hit, omg
---
dont rember bhvr mentioning anything of the sort in the patch notes, quite intresting, thank you.
---
Not every killer is like that though, so you are just going to punish *all* killers due to the shitty ones? That just leads to an endless cycle of each side getting frustrated due to toxicity so they cave in and do scummy/frustrating things for the other side themself.
---
It is there, basically the deep wounds timer doesn't decrease when a survivor gets hit by a FF attack (unless you're using Frank's), therefore you can't down a survivor without Frank's.
---
DS works the same against every killer though ?
---
It's all for show. Idk what's so hard to understand, lol.
---
You guys are more TOXIC than he is ! at least he does it ingame and you do it in real life !
---
Little did they know the nurse had toxic plans of her own.
---
sometimes i wonder what bhvr is thinking, why confuse players with that shit
---
God talk about overreaction. No killers don't have to change their main because of one perk. When I play killer and I get someone with MoM, I don't care. It's a nice little surprise. That's what the perk is supposed to do. It's no different than an insta-heal. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone whenever I come here because so many people here seem to think that killers have it soooo much harder which is ridiculous to me. I'm a pretty high rank Survivor and I never escape. Meanwhile whenever I play as killer I can easily kill everyone and I make a point not to camp or tunnel. Do you think it's also unfair that someone can have insta-down hatchets? Or unlimited tier 3 Meyers?
---
THEY COULD DO THAT BEFORE
---
MoM is honestly only hurting the low tier M1 killers like Wraith &amp; Trapper, the high tier ones like Huntress, Billy &amp; Nurse don't actually get hurt much by it.
---
nOeD iS fInE and baLanCeD gUyS, jusT dO tOtEmS xD

I like when killers take the swing at my default dwight not knowing I have sprint burst LMAO.
---
The Predator wouldn‚Äôt make sense at all, it‚Äôs a high tech space alien that would not get looped, 
---
The alien though would fit, it‚Äôs a mindless animal.

You're welcome :-DDD

Wait, he did? Lul. Didn't know that but the reason was propably dumber than the T1 Ban.

Play killer, play against a P3 Claudette, urban evading, and not doing gens, holding the game hostage, enjoy.

Damn why you gotta do yourself like that
---
1. It's 3 minutes
---
2. 3 minutes is not that much.
---
3. If there is someone on the hook, it will become much harder to save.

Dude wtf ?

So what you want, play to have fun, you don‚Äôt have to listen to the made up rules survivor mains have created.
---
Wait, these aren‚Äôt the same picture?
---
DBZA meme, You get an upvote sir
---
Agreed. BBQ&amp;Chili is good perk plus easy to stack. WGLF does nothing and is alot harder to stack.

I want to witness the day where both Ghostface and Pig both being in a match and they teabag everyone they meet.
---
Claudette's face.
---
Unless the Entity grants Chucky becoming a LEGO piece. Or so.
---
Happened to me  earlier, against a billy, in swamp.
---
He didn't use franklins though, and only one escaped because he had no ed haha
---
Legit, this is my experience with the Doctor on both sides. (And doesn't matter what ping) I genuinely feel bad either way.
---
No i wasnt talking about the tierlist, i was talking about the video thumbnail, the words that are red.
---
It goes both ways, plenty of killers on here like that and plenty of survivors on here who think so too. It's a chicken and egg situation with both sides going "yeah well *they* are being toxic, so why shouldn't I?" leading to this mess.
---
This is fine if they run in different directions. Its not super common but I have had it where I'll down and hook the unhooker, then find and down the hookee with DS still up.
---
It feels bad, but at that point it's just unlucky.
---
WEST VIRGINIAAAA
---
i get messages on PS4 even if They survive when i let them survive.

what i don't get is, on PS4 messaging someone is a drag, it takes ages. Yet they do it to call me a noob killer or something. While I let them survive wtf?

Farming-wise what perks and addons would u run on the nurse for the BP farms ?
---
The thing I wanted to say is: if someone bought a negev every round in CSGO and rushed mid for fun with their friends, we wouldn‚Äôt mind it.
---
If people playing overwatch played with 6 dps heroes in a match just to troll we wouldn‚Äôt mind it.
---
You go look at any other game where people can mess around, we wouldn‚Äôt mind it.
---
I don‚Äôt get it, why does EVERYONE feel so attacked when the opposition in DBD messes around? Have people never thought that, maybe, people are just playing the game unseriously to have fun, NOT to play it to make you feel horrible?
---
Think of that please.
---
If anything, you have to admire the dedication required to be so spiteful enough to message you on console. Heck, I nearly gave up 3 times already trying to type this message out ^^
---
Depends on the situation. Hitting them in your power let's you vault pallets etc. for easier hits.
---
Can someone please tell me why no one likes haddonfield, I think it‚Äôs a pretty cool map,

i once had this too, i hid away so they could survive.

No one did something. So i went into the basement to hide and saw jake there...I was like tf? because the Hatch is here you hide under the hatch.

I downed, him and let him stand again, he showed me where the Meg was hiding. At the end i hooked Meg, and let him die by the End Game...üòÇ

you really didn't play killer against good survivors if you think it's in any way killer-sided. but i am sure it is more killer-sided among lower rank players. everything is more killer-sided on low ranks. that literally flips the higher you climb.
---
you also didn't argue single point i made, just added some bullcrap about killers not losing anything due to Entity devouring survivors. which is insane, why would they? 2 minutes is more than enough to escape or think ahead of strategy. i'm killer main, it's the side i enjoy the most, but i play survivor much more due to drastically longer killer queues and recent MoM addition that literally is broken on Freddy(my main) cause can wake someone up upon hit or make them invincible for the rest of the game and the overall fact i'm an m1 killer main, i don't play Huntress or Billy(or Nurse at this point). so, you know... 2+ MoMs per game do make difference especially on higher ranks(right now after reset killer rank 8, survivor 7).
---
a) equipping a perk is barely toxic. I dont call a killer toxic because he has noed i call him toxic because he decided to ignore 3 people to tunnel 1 with 5 gens up.
---
b) Not everybody but 90 of the killers I get on R1 :)
---

Its a reference to the movie My Bloody Valentine u dummy, not Pyro.

Maybe she's blending in or something?

I usually get a full lobby right away

weird for me now it is taking a long time. must just be a weird time of day i guess
---
The Simpsons = upvote
---
It wasn't though, as killer dced. I messaged them and they said theres no way they should've all got cleansed. But really, it was just me and my one friend cleansing them.
---
We got 0 bp for the game and de piped, because killer dced.
---
What is jo jo refference?
---
The speed boost is unnecessary, it should have something that the survivor has to do in order to get the bonus, but I think that an anti-exposed/chainsaw perk is a good idea. People want to talk about ways to counter NOED other than just "cleanse totems" this would be a viable alternative. The fact that it only works against three killers by default and other than would require either specific perks or add-ons would keep it balanced. Situational and strong should be around the same level as consistent and good.
---
For anyone wondering this image is from Scream
---
I've always loved the idea that the Survivors crossed paths with each other at some point before they got snatched up. Not enough to be friends, but *maybe* enough to know their names.
---
Hey Bianca del Rio, I just saw Bianca gurl!
---
I can't imagine you've not been exposed to drag queens at some point by now, even if not in your personal life. You've at least heard of To Wong Foo Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar right? I don't care what your beliefs are, that was a fuckin great and hilarious movie featuring drag and I'm about as priveledged as it can get tbh. Watch it if you haven't, seriously.
---
What was my point? Oh, don't be a dick man. They were clearly making content for a certain audience and were pretty funny doing it. I don't think you and I are their marketing concern is what I'm saying so just let them be dude. They're not hurting anything, promise.
---
Stop looking at him!
---
Yo, downvoted/upvotes are fake. Bro, they‚Äôre not real. They don‚Äôt actually matter, bro. No need to bust out the laughing emoji
---
There are three types of keys in the game.
---
Broken key (green): This one is not used for opening hatches, it is supposed to be used to put on addons for the abilities.
---
Dull key (purple): This one can be used for opening the hatch and is consumed when you do. However, this one can but shouldn‚Äôt be used for the keys abilities as it only lasts 5 seconds.
---
Skeleton key (pink): This one is a combination of both, it can be used to open the hatch as well as its abilities.
---
I assume when you found the hatch, you had a broken key. These ones are next to useless so I don‚Äôt recommend using them.
---
Yep, that's Scarred Hand. It causes both the laid traps and the phantasms to have collision, so you can get stuck overtop of one if it's placed under a window.
---
The pink one so terrify
---
This has always been weird to me. In most other games it's considered rude to say gg first if you won. In DBD people *only* say gg if they win.
---
I disagree, whispers is a nono perk for me
---
Why's that? Whispers is in my top 2 tracking perks.
---
I'm cool
---
Means they can't be followed! 
---
But in reality they are probably just hiding game hours, they don't want you to know who their friends are, anything about them etc.
---
I'm bad, i know. But atleast i acknowledge the fact that i'm human trash.
---
Oh no... Is leatherface
---
If a survivor zergrushes a gen because they know they have DS and are safe, they're not a dumbo, are they?
---
There use to be a bug where there was no prompt to open the hatch with a key as well, Idk if it was fixed but if OP had a key that could open a hatch this could have been the issue.
---
Never start off in treatment, first run towards the farthest away corner from your spawn-point, then swap to treatment, there is no reason to go to 110 speed before there might actually be survs near
---
It doesn‚Äôt say that at all so I don‚Äôt know where you got your info from, it says when the last Generator is repaired.
---
This is the last part of the description: ‚ÄúWhen the last Generator is fully repaired, all the survivors‚Äô Auras are revealed for 10 seconds‚Äù
---
Adrenaline does for sure, so it would be rather bullshit if it didn't (I don't know, though) You just made me want to use Bitter Murmur now...
---
What the point of going to the corner of the map?
---
Hey, twigs and dried mud is pretty strong! It's like old fashioned reinforced concrete.
---
I know it's for anti tunnel as least the way I have seen people use it, it's for protection against killers who purposely only target you and it ruins the experience, if you want to get down? Sure I will hit you but that's gonna be slugging and it's gonna ruin the fun of yours, I've seen surviours run away from the hooks and do Gens or other objectives further away from the hook. 
---
They don't have to waste decisive early on in a match.
---
OR I can I just slug you all and wait for 60 seconds each time you get unhooked ya know?
---
Your playstyle is extremely risky imo, what if you miss the skill check or the killer slugs you?
---
I call it bold and brash!
---
Nah I think it's possible ;)
---
When the exit gates are powered and when the last generator is repaired are 2 different triggers
---
Again - if it works... If you, as a killer, let single survivor loop you for too long, its your fault - you need to know when to give up. Looping can be fun too (not a killer main, paid for the whole game, might as well enjoy it both sides)
---
He just wants to EXPOSE your friendship üòä
---
So you should just be prepared for anything the killer or survivor can throw out in your base kit/with any perks whatsoever? Without having to make any compromise whatsoever? Tank-damage-stealth-healer? What is this Payday? The entire point of a perk is to give an advantage in a certain skill. You being 4/16 perks you should be 1/4th of the killer's total power, the counter to the killer so to speak is class based SWF. 1/4th of the killers total power in this game is open to be countered by one perk. 1/4th of the killer's power can be countered by 1/4th of yours so to speak. Don't like **hexes**? Take a **hex perk** Don't like **slugging**? Take a **slugging perk**. Having 4 Tank Damage Stealth Healers would break the balance of the game.
---
Wow
---
That was.. uh.. sudden
---
Maybe a date first?
---
If nea is added to the killer side and is any lower than hillbilly/spirit tier the community will riot.
---
The devs focus on gameplay and balance which they mostly do well when it comes to the base killer and survivor.I feel like us making our own lore shows that were still interested.Please no hate towards me because im defending the devs.
---
He‚Äôs right.
---
I‚Äôm glad you jumped off so that the accidental exploit didn‚Äôt ruin the game, you‚Äôre a good guy :D
---
Old survivor animations were 474747474732x better than what we have now
---
TFS reigns supreme
---
I like the small amount of lore they give us.I like to expand it with my mind.spirit=waluigi
---
Aren't the next 4 killers supposed to be licensed tho?
---
Ya‚Äôll have no idea how many times this has happened to me. So one time I was playing wraith on this map and these idiots did every gen except, the 1 in the dock, the one in the little forest next to the dock, and the one near the killer shack. I got a 4K that game
---
We know that.. But a meme is still a meme.
---
Yeah, I bought Legion with shards :P and only really buy licensed killers with real money
---
Yeah lol, they‚Äôre interesting devs imho
---
Dude is legion okay in good ranks?  I mean like I can't play wraith without ultra rare addons in purple ones.
---
I know spirit seems good but I like  the hit and run strat of legion!
---
What would you prefer, spirit or legion? I meant to say what's more fun!
---
Pig :3
---
Not from me, sorry. I don't watch her stream and I'm not sure she was recording either.
---
The game is balanced tho
---
I only say gg if i lose and its a close game
---
I just use the head case one with the neon body
---
^(Oh great the James memes leaked into the DBD sub too)
---
Well yeah, can't have nice things these days.
---
The game is all about pressure and time management, which means the faster you can pinpoint where survivors are, the better you will do.
---
Blinking from one gen to another in the hopes you see a survivor, when you could've pinpointed one in the area much quicker with whispers, is wasted time. A general understanding of survivor spawns and habits lets you very quickly use whispers to your advantage if you know how to properly use it, which it kind of sounds like you don't, since you only seem to think all it does is tell you when a survivor is near.
---
They paid for Ash as a survivor and access to three teachables. They did not pay to have all of their perks remain the exact same from when they bought them.
---
Its shit
---
Tell that to the "fast learner" in resurrection
---
Lots of profiles are private by default also idk why you want to see my games, achievements, hours and friends anyway, don't you have something better to be doing.
---
Unpopular opinioni: it should only be said, and first, when you lose.
---
Otherwise you can't discern from the "friendly handshake" it's supposed to be (yeah, that part has never convinced me either) and just a way to humblebrag.
---
just for reference everyone he is currently using his fans to continue the random funny moments montages.  the names, amount of prestiges, etc, always change per each part of the montage
---
Your teammate blocks you in a corner, refusing to move, teabagging and pointing as the rest of his SWFs shows up. His buddy starts vaulting pallets and windows to draw the killer over and of course the killer downs you. Now the SWF group is pointing and teabagging while you're on the hook. I still need to stick around in your eyes? Oh and to throw a little bit of life into it, I've got about 30 minutes to play a couple matches for the day. 
---
If you honestly feel I should waste my time on a game and a team like that then I'll just leave it at we've agreed to disagree.
---
They had a livestream yesterday and apparently the hit boxes aren't the issue, it's the desynchronisation. Dedicated servers are supposed to help but we'll have to wait and see I guess. Regardless of the reason it's frustrating as hell when it happens to you.
---
Claudette main btw so hides till end game xD
---
that‚Äôs not necessarily a fair argument.  people will be toxic, regardless of who showed them it.  tbagging is not something noob does, neither is pallet wasting.  those are all OchiDO tactics
---
I often find players in my lobbies more than not tend to have their profiles set to private. It's definitely to hide their hours/friend information.
---
deadhard makes you unhittable a moment before the charge thing. both were deadhards
---
are they really playing the game or is this edited?  would love if they were
---
Considering how nuts some of the people in this fandom can be I don‚Äôt blame them tbh. Making a dumb suggestion for video game balance shouldn‚Äôt lead to people being harassed but I can imagine it would.
---
Dead Hard has i-frames
---
Lmao this thread is just people salty that their overpowered perk got nerfed.
---
Title. Franks Mixtape brings back the old legion
---
Not to be overly negative, but does anyone else think some of this merch is pretty low quality?
---
I'm referring specifically to the David pillow, the regular cushions etc.
---
A lot of it is just the ingame image shoved ontop of a cushion for a vastly inflated price.
---
That being said that Pizza dwight shirt is awesome.
---
If you dc on a facecamper you're helping him getting more kills. Your mates could easily finish 3 gens in the time it takes him to camp you. Even though you're basically dead, you're still wasting his time.
---
$90 for that Meg Hoodie? It pains me as a main that I must obtain it but... so so expensive.
---
What rank are you?
---
Imagine making an entire reddit post with video evidence because you believe the game is broken. Only to be told by everyone that it's dead hard. Just delete your post. You fucking idiot.
---
He trolling stop replying
---
Is this supposed to be funny? Yes?  OK I will laugh hahahahaha nice meme about OchiDo
---
I wanted to drop the shack pallet but the lag didn't let me that's why I stode still because it lagged that hard
---
This sub was ruined when you joined it.

Y'all don't know shit. Every character is shipped with Clown unless specifically stated otherwise by the devs in an official statement.
---
No i agree those cushions are lazy. 
---
the patches on the other hand are pretty sweet.
---
Leaked new survivor, obviously
---
Franks went from the best to the worst add on.
---
The special edition comes with the hag and the doctor. Also the huntress dlc is free on every platform. The dlcs go on sale very often and you can buy all the characters (that aren't licensed) using ingame curreny that you earn by increasing your player level.
---
Not only that but also because I was concerned that doctor had NOED. I didn‚Äôt want to get caught with it and stay stuck up there lol if I uploaded it with game and party chat, you can hear me being confused
---
I think it‚Äôs good because its super useful in losing the killer in the middle of a chase. If I stun them I‚Äôll usually leave scratch marks turning in one direction and urban evasion the other way, it works for me because personally I suck at long chases.

dense waste of space.
---
Those patches are great, i would love if they would make Enamel pins of them.
---
I've only ever seen this "gg at the end of the game" mentality in 2 of the games I play: LoL and DBD. Both times, the winners are the first to say "gg" where I certainly believe they would have just immediately left if they lost. 
---
The kicker is that they get pissy if you don't say it back. 
---
Kind of saying, "Okay, I won, so now it's time for you to be humble and tell me how good of a game my win was."
---
I got an EZ message for a game I didn't even play. I was dc'd during the loading screen and when I told him as much he started talking even more shit. Like wtf?  He spammed me so much shit I had to block the sad little kid.
---
Huh, I never write gg but rather...
---
*puts on cool dude glasses*
---
ggwp
---
I read this in his voice LOL
---
DWIGHT YOU LITTLE SHIT, I UNHOOKED YOU CAUSE THE KILLER WASN‚ÄôT NEARBY, DON‚ÄôT RUN TO THE CORNER OF THE MAP, SPECIALLY WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE NOT RUNNING SELF CARE OR HAVE A MEDKIT, LET ME HEAL YOU.
---
You can track it while it‚Äôs invisible but you won‚Äôt see it‚Äôs aura when burning the map until it has actually spawned.
---
Can't stop watching it
---
I really hope they change the ds stun time. Like, please
---
Wait I haven‚Äôt played/played against the spirit, what happens when she stays still
---
I haven't had a game where survivors left immediately in forever. I mainly play killer and actually almost never see games where survivors said gg after losing or even winning. If they win they trash talk, if they lose they trash talk. I know killers are bad and most are very toxic,  BUT saying survivors aren't is either the opposite of my experience or wrong.
---
If the other side says it first, them I say it back if I won
---
I also dont like it beacuse you use an entire perk slot when you could have something else there. I see where you are coming from, i like long chases won or lost i lik to run the killer aroun and i dont crouch.
---
I've only voluntarily dced twice, once as killer and once as survivor. Killer was because I got the giant survivors glitch and could not for the life of me figure out where they actually were. Survivor was because about 10 seconds into the match another survivor motioned for me to follow and walked me right into the killer, a pig. After I was hooked, I watched them do the same to another survivor. I noped out of there pretty quick after that.
---
But why do you need this?
---
Ah gotcha. And they do that, at least it happened with Wraith for me.
---
Are you stupid? Based off of your logic my boss can‚Äôt fire me if I tell him to fuck off, or if I tell a customer to go commit suicide. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. Freedom of speech only keeps you from going to prison, that doesn‚Äôt mean others have to agree and support you. Freedom of speech doesn‚Äôt mean your words don‚Äôt have social consequences, just that you won‚Äôt be locked up for it. It‚Äôs also ironic how you‚Äôre backlashing him for backlashing a homophobe. That just makes you look like a complete dumb ass, but that‚Äôs probably because you are.
---
&gt;is literally like you play the game, and you get rewarded
---
Almost like BBQ, NOED, or almost any obsession perk.
---
This killer bias is really starting to piss me off.
---
Yeah, my issue is 9/10 I‚Äôm always the first person chased no matter if I‚Äôm by myself or with other people, so I like to end it as quick as possible so I dont go down in the first 2 minutes of the game üòÇ
---
This ain't it, chief
---
Jesus I sometimes get upset when someone uses NOED or play Myers but I always write gg
---
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH FUCKING CORN I HAVE WALKED THROUGH THIS WEEK!
---
"God I hate this game" *presses ready*
---
r/woosh
---
Wait arnt you the same killer who relies on noed?
---
no just stating a fact you clealry cant accept.
---
It should be said if you feel the game was good. As a Survivor you can clearly see how well a Killer gets his stuff done (and vice versa).
---
This gives me PTSD
---
Saying "gg" every game is pretty damn stupid.
---
You say "gg" after a good match. It really doesn't matter if I live or die if thr game was entertaining and fun.
---
If one side was slaughtered before getting 2-3 gens done, or the other one got like two hooks, it's a shit game. You can call it "unbalanced" tho.
---
Just like you can't accept how deadhard works? :)
---
To anyone that DC‚Äôs, don‚Äôt. Just get hooked and Kobe ‚Äòtill you die.
---
That way you can‚Äôt get banned.
---
I feel for you man. Its a hard knock life and the fsct this game caters so much to killers is ridiculous. But us survivors, we are the problem lol. Good luck to your future matches
---
You just found this out?
---
He did die. DC kills your character.
---
The perk is very good for a gen jockey build with spine chill and a good toolbox. You can literally crouch around the killer till he is gone and keep working on the gen. I've been on the receiving end of it and it works.
---
That said, its not worth a perk slot for me since I'm not a gen jockey. I prefer Adrenaline and an Exhaustion perk, and then whatever I feel at the moment for the last two.
---
Yeah, I just noticed. lol
---
The amount of people trying to give excuses for DCing in the comments holy shit. I understand unbearable lag, completely ok for DC then but some of these other excuses, man, now I know why half my games suck. I mean, these people do realise the game is killer v survivor, right? You can‚Äôt DC just cause there‚Äôs a killer in your game lmao.
---
Friendly tip: you should train at chases do you can waste the killers time more and when you go against someone who can deal with immersed players you can run him. For getting better i went into games made loud  notifications so the killer knows where i am and i would run him until i die or survive. It worked for me but i suggest getting chased (not on purpose), watching survivors who are good at chases and maybe even watch a tutorial. Good luck.
---
What do you mean with OR Myers my friend? Are you saying Myers is boring to play against? ü§®
---
ITT: Homophobia?! In front of MY DEAD BY DAYLIGHT?
---
Since I have all the Killer teachables unlocked, I can find any of them on any Killer. So if I decide I want to try a certain build, I can quickly figure out if I need any of the perks on whatever Killers I would try the build on.
---
I don‚Äôt see how removing the no mither icon from no mither will do anything as the perk puts them permanently in the injured state. Either way the killer knows.
---
But what would the nerfed version be? This doesn‚Äôt actually remove the problem that the devs are trying to address. It‚Äôs still a very minimal to no counter play perk with high reward.
---
Nea reached her final form
---
Thank you, Now I can see fast wich perks I am still missing.
---
NBD.
---
Lol sounds like you‚Äôre just salty that you can‚Äôt take the game hostage by becoming immersed. The Killer outplayed you and you lost. Too bad. Just accept your death.
---
Me running We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever.
---
You come back to haunt me
---
Last night I played a game as Doc against a swf and they were just the greatest group of survivors a killer could ask for.
---
They weren't body blocking or trolling ever, they just played really well and they played the way the game is supposed to be played. Myself and all four of them held a conversation on messages for a while and it was just great. A nil kill game but it was so fun.
---
If you loop the main-building in ironworks you deserve it.
---
Im glad you are aware of your density. It works perfectly.
---
Actually it's 99% shitty &amp; effortless memes, like this one, which was posted like 5 times before here.

There are offerings to play as the Shape and Leatherface too. They probably just haven't shown up in your bloodweb yet. I don't think I ever saw a Black Splinter (for the Shape) in the 5 months before I bought the Halloween DLC.
---
there is one for all lisenced killers, the originals ones don't have them. Myers has one too you just didn't find it yet.
---
huh?
---
How so?
---
They‚Äôre working on Freddy Rework and Dedicated servers, but they still have to reach the chapter deadline while working on everything else.
---
I know my luck, as soon as I buy the Cannibal, BBQ is gonna show up in the shrine
---
I was referring to rancor separately in that that isn't high risk high reward on the killers part. Probably should've specified it. Rancor is another obsession perk that just not only gives you kinda bitter murmur but just lets you kill someone for free at the end of the match, the survivor gets a pretty shitty buff in return.
---
Because relying on a crunch perk to get you the kills at the end of the game is going to be harder at higher ranks since survivors will likely break totems
---
My favorite thing is running Territorial as Michael T1 and when it goes off I just stand on top the stairs waiting.

Yeah was about to say that. Dude literally hugged the fucking ironwork‚Äôs window for all the game and then complains. Smh
---
As the owner of the post who has to see every reply, a LOT of people are mad and are demanding refunds. I don't think they're joking.
---
Y'know the worst part is Columbine was where I went to High School. Not at the time of the shooting, but they take that sort of thing really seriously. Schools all across Denver were completely shut down when that threat was made.
---
Yeah well, that's just like, your opinion man
---
freddy is paid dlc we still want people to buy him and the debs to make money
---
Every time a new trend or something happens, they make a seperate sub for it and ban it f4om the main one, and that sub just dies in a week anyway. Like that "shitty charmander" meme.
---
And why is that?
---
2 people were hooked with 5 gens to go, Should I just let the killer get me and not buy time for my team?
---
I‚Äôm not *terrible* at chases, I just can‚Äôt run him around for super long is all, usually. Depends on the map, some of them I‚Äôm very familiar with and able to navigate well under pressure but others not so much. I‚Äôm much better at losing chases on maps with lots of twists and turns, and I use things like quick and quiet and poised to help me if I really need it. Overall I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm terrible, but I definitely will try to improve.
---
Bbq was on the shrine a couple weeks ago after more than 1 year. You‚Äôll be fine haha, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it coming any soon
---
The only joke is how long the wraith has been dodging nerfs.
---
What‚Äôs your point?
---
My go-to example is this.
---
I loaded into a match that had solid green ping in the lobby. The second my opening animation swivel ended, I was downed -- literally, the second. I could not move before I was downed, and I was not running No Mither, so I went from healthy to downed in one second to a Doctor. Then, he teleported me across the map to the basement, and only after I'd been hooked for a while did I even scream for being wounded, let alone downed and hooked.
---
I'm not going to play that match out, because it's not going to be fun for me.
---
Nah it depends from the situation, sometimes survivors are indeed the problem
---
Why would it? Perk is activated on survivors actions (gen repair), not on killer.
---
[Never forget the original bloodweb.](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/195172462385464622/005032E2A008FD6F03F3BC123718D99987105C70/)
---
NT means "no thanks", and they're saying that you're trying to get them to pay more money for Leatherface, so you must work for Behaviour.
---
Yeah, it seems to be one extreme or the other: either I get 2+ DCs, or I get no DCs.
---
I had a daily a while ago to unhook people as Kate. It took me three days to get it done because people kept DCing or suiciding on first hook. Was a miserable experience.
---
should he have just died instead of going to the windoe in order to preserve his honor then
---
Ok, here's the story of my (i think) only dc on survivor side:
---
The match starts and i head on over to my gen, as you do.
---
As i'm repairing i notice the other 3 coming over, ok.
---
The gen has only 3 sides, so the 4th person just awkwardly stands there, giving moral support i guess. Suddenly a wild killer appears and i try to make it to the nearest jungle gym. Of course everyone had the same brilliant idea so i get blocked and the killer hits me, fair enough.
---
I loop him around that gym for a good bit, until i drop the pallet on him and head for the next spot.
---
While trying to loop the next one i suddenly get stopped on my tracks because a magical claudette tries to cast invisibility on herself right in the middle of the doorway.
---
So i get downed and carried to the hook, as is tradition.
---
I could not fail to notice the magical claudette following us on our fun journey.
---
As soon as the killer turns around to leave claudette sees her chance and pulls me off of my cozy resting place.
---
The killer, as confused as me, turns around and takes a split second to grasp the situation.
---
Now picture this hook i'm at. It's next to the gen we all were working on a few minutes earlier (and from the sound of it, not much work has been done on this gen).
---
So remembeeing that i dropped the palette on jungle gym A, i turn around and head in the opposite direction to jungle gym B ( i believe magical claudette has made her way over to jungle gym A, good i need some me time anyway). 
---
As i get to gym B i notice on of the other survivors crouching at the window i'd like to use, and as i am approaching slowly vaulting it, not to alert the killer that is 2 seconds behind me and has clear line of sight i guess.
---
Oh well i decide to take the long way around and enter from the other side. However as i'm running i notice player 4 (the moral support giver) is also here, and for some reason decides to walk in front of me.
---
As we get to the other side of the wall and i'd like to make a turn, of course he keeps jogging on the inward side of the track. Denying me access to anything safe. 
---
The killer (probably aware that i am the only threat he faces this round) naturally ignores all my helpful teammates and homes in on me. Shortly after the blocking i go down and start thinking "why should i stay here? There is no chance of winning with those guys, it is not fun, and those guys deserve to lose after all that."
---
Thus i ended it quickly and moved on to a new match. But since rank reset happened there is little chance of better matches ( i ended up playing killer for the rest of the evening)
---
This is exactly my reasoning; the Entity was the only 'god' that answered her prayers in her absolute worst time of need, and because it saved her from the abyss she became eternally loyal to it.
---
But I'm not talking about doing that, I'm saying a separate sub for fan content. Just that one.
---
I would like that but I would like it if it was one of those double staircases so it's 1 floor in between you can't go too because then you could kind of hear when the heartbeat is on your floor and when it isn't.
---
BBQ was in the shrine about 4 or 5 weeks back. I guess it's possible, but considering it has only shown up twice, maybe unlikely.
---
Ah, makes Sense.
---
I mean why would you need the only Perk that doubles your BP for Killers?
---
If you're actually serious, and this isn't a joke, than you have no idea what you're talking about. They're not nerfing him because he's low-mid/high-low tier at best.
---
That's just a pretty good job so far.
---
I meant it as Nice Try but that also works
---
For me, it's not about the map as much as it is glitches on the map -- like that you can't see auras or scratch marks worth a damn on Ormond, so I don't blame people dodging it, though I don't. I just accept I'll die on first hook unless I have very observant teammates.
---
While I absolutely ADORE the first TCM, TCM 2 was a hell of a good sequel. It doesn't look like it is at the first, but the weird, gonzo style of the film made it unique in that series, and Tobe knew he couldn't top the first anyway.
---
So why not go more extreme, in a variety of ways? It's more comedic, but it's also got some of the most savage, disgusting moments in the entire series.
---
Get that bitch, Leatherface! Get that bitch! Dog will hunt...
---
Just to be sure, I'm not saying they're not toxic. I'm saying that I just see fewer of them, probably because I'm not at red ranks currently. But then again, I haven't played Killer in a while and mostly judge from what I can see from the survivors side. To be honest in the end it doesn't matter because assholes want to be assholes.
---
Sidney Prescott as a survivor?
---
The problem is that youre here complaining that the killer plays in a way you dont like, while doing the scummiest possible thing that isn't griefing. 
---
Don't abuse overpowered, uninteractive and unfun shit if you cant handle others doing that as well.
---
Scarred hand hag, traps have collision, check out monto's series on it he has some pretty funny moments with it
---
I mean throwing down the pallet early still cuts down the loop, I'm sure you know yourself that the better survivors make the pallet last as much as possible, which even when actively avoiding Spirit Fury, still forces you to throw down said pallet and end the loop early.
---
Killers have ran the same handful of perks just as much as survivors have. For survivors it's always about extending the chase and for killers it's always about either downing faster or gen halting in some form. Killers don't have to cater to anything, they've run the same loadout forever. BBQ, Ruin, and most recently Enduring, spirit fury. Sure you have different perks to cater to the specific killer like M&amp;A for example, but killers have always run the same builds long before MoM came out, I've never seen a significant change in their builds.
---
Imagine if the other exposed perks were worth running besides NOED, hell I've seen some deadly MYC builds with Hag, Spirit, Billy, and Nurse those will literally counter MoM. What if stealth builds were more popular on killers, if matches were slower or stealth builds weren't so detrimental to the killer (Myers comes to mind) they would be run more. There are builds out there to counter 2nd chance perks, they just aren't as powerful as the current meta builds. Same can be said with survivors, maybe stealth builds would be worth running if you didn't get shit amount of points and it worked more than half the time against killers. There are tons of builds you can run on survivor and killer that sound good on paper, but the perks that facilitate said builds just aren't good.
---
When I'm talking about buffs, I mean for BOTH sides. For every perk like Territorial Imperative there's a perk like Boil Over.
---
Pretty much. I was discussing the Killers' lore with another friend, and she was less than impressed by the Nurse's story, or a lot of them really (She at least agreed that while she didn't like Hag's story, it did at least give SOME context).
---
But the Spirit's story she didn't like, but my defense was "She's literally a Grudge ghost"
---
Unless the stats changed drastically in a short time, the complaints are off. Their released statistics showed that, while fairly popular, it's in no way even close to be in every game.
---
just watch
---
You‚Äôre thinking of no mither.
---
I have been thinking about this recently lol. I even had an idea for a killer for the mansion. Or a castle + prison would be cool.
---
I was told that it doesn't go dark when you turn ur graphic settings down to low. 
---
That is not true. Either that or the adaptive brightness on my monitor makes it seem not true
---
So tell me what was OP supposed to do? Let the Wraith kill him? 
---
If killers are allowed to do whatever is in the game to preserve their hooks, like camping. Surviviors should be able to do whatever is in the game to keep them alive in the chase. 
---
And speaking as a killer main myself, if you use NOED ur just bad at the game. Either that or ur Freddy
---
Best one I had yesterday...was playing Freddy with Black Box, game starts, the obsession instantly DCs. Proceeded to wipe the floor with the remaining three, obviously, but man, what a D-hole.
---
What was he supposed to do? Let the Wraith kill him?
---
You should switch to the low setting since it makes the game brighter
---
Agree to disagree. I can 4k with him and you can‚Äôt that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm sure you can 4k with another killer with which I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt feel Freddy is weak at all he is my strongest killer. Many people do find him weak but they only mention his weaknesses and the wrong way to play him. This leads me to believe they simply are not good with him.
---
The entire game is based on opinions, main killers find it unfair when a survivor does something particular, and survivors main find it unfair when a killer does something in particular. The game was designed like this, it‚Äôs not my fault when I try to do the objective whether I was a killer or a survivor, I‚Äôd run NOED, and I‚Äôd loop the killer till Daylight because it‚Äôs there, it‚Äôs the devs fault if they think it‚Äôs an abusing but also don‚Äôt want to tweak or remove it. Most of my endgame chat is just people fighting over dumb stuff just because they didn‚Äôt like it.
---
Really dude? Really? If killers run enduring Spirit fury, Noed, Omega Blink Nurse, 5 Blink Nurse, Hypersonic Spirit, Prayer Beads Spirit, etc. You would probably be telling Surviviors to git gud. 
---
But bc Surviviors get a loop that doesn't let them go down instantaneously that's suddenly a fucking abomination
---
Add a totem counter and make small game reveal auras.
---
Right but the survivor's goal is to survive. And running and not getting hit and out playing the killer does not make them problematic. Thats the game
---
he looks nothing like pyro in the first place üôÑ
---
Perkless 
---
But more recently I've begun using only Ace in the Hole,  gives the game that fear factor it had when I was new
---
Blasphemy!
---
Out of curiosity, how many hours do you have in the game?
---
no, if the killer was running omegablink and had the audacity to complain I would tell them to shut the fuck up.
---
If you need to use the ironworks window to beat a fucking Wraith you dont deserve to survive.
---
Man predator would be extremely interesting
---
You just jumped to the last part of my post, ignoring all the explanation before that so I‚Äôm assuming you just want to have a reason to shit on me because I shit on noed.
---
In both Starcraft and Hearthstone it's rude to say gg first if you won. I don't know the mentality behind it for sure (e.g. potentially rubbing in a bad loss?) but I'm definitely accustomed to it. It makes sense to me; if map generation dicks you, I'm not going to pretend we just had a good game and I outplayed you. 
---
But manners are sparse enough in dbd that I honestly can't blame anyone for being happy with any gg at all.
---
There were 2 Surviviors in that situation. He needed to loop Wraith as long as he could in order to have a shot to Survive and that was what he did. If killers are allowed to facecamp hooks, Surviviors should be allowed to have stronger loops at certain areas. 
---
If that Wraith can't learn to shift his focus once he learns the chase is lost, he doesn't deserve the kill.
---
Said angry camped survivor main
---
Im shitti9ng on you because you abuse OP shit, then have the audacity to complain when others do it. Dont tell others how to play if you play like a shitstain too.
---
Plague lore: so yeah, hey god? can we like.. get rid of this sickness thing?
---
Entity: bring dat ass here gurl, im your god now
---
My god are you even reading what I said?
---
I DIDN‚ÄôT ABUSE THE WINDOW.
---
I just did 2 loops, should I ignore that window and get an hit instead because you don‚Äôt like it?
---
After some of the games I've had as killer, I don't mind if someone runs NOED. I still don't but if I did nothing but Killer and got a little too affected by the chat lobby after everyone had MoM and Adrenaline, I could definitely understand running it.
---
I never said that my team was at fault, where did you read that?
---
I‚Äôm actually glad they managed to do generators while I was chased!
---
Also since I though he was a new player I wanted to give advice not telling him how to play the game.
---
I said he SHOULD not he NEEDS. If he doesn‚Äôt want to follow my advice fine, but he doesn‚Äôt need to get salty about it
---
I say bg
---
There are so many people complaining that OP played the game well, completely ignoring the fact that the killer was playing poorly and noed threw him a bone, why does every post that is from a survivor perspective met with such biased?
---
Those buildings have always, LITERALLY always, for the whole 2+ years this game has existed been a problem. It's not "complaing NOW", it's "this shit still exists, it doesnt deserve to exist".
---
Then why did you post it then you helmet
---
Maybe he gets his ass whooped by daddy Myers everytime
---
Criminal
---
WHAT IS WITH SOLO SURVIVORS TRYING TO GO FOR THE SAVE WHEN I'M SLUGGED. IT HAS GOTTEN THEM AND ME KILLED AND I HAD DS IN WAITING. I SWEAR IT'S FINE IF I'M HOOKED AND YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE BT TO LEAVE. 3 MAN ESCAPE IS BETTER THAN NO ONE ESCAPING!
---
I just started playing right before then, damn am I one lucky sunuvabich
---
You sure are lol I had to buy bubba back in September when I started
---
I believe there is also a fifth version with white markings instead of blue or red. Though the demon version here is the best looking one in my opinion.
---
He's not boring to play against butI don't like getting chased a get downed on in one hit
---
... this was a joke.
---
Same, it‚Äôs just internet points, but it‚Äôs more about the fact that they don‚Äôt even answer (I‚Äôm talking about this comment)
---
It's my favorite perk. It acts as a catalyst for a lot of stealth based builds
---
then matchmaking is in ur side, u can be the best freddy ever but he cant do much about gen rush, chase and pressure.
---
Meh. Idc. They remind me too much of Tyde to take them seriously.
---
Those building have always existed, but I've never seen anyone complain about them until now honestly. The fact that those buildings exist is a good reason as to why there shouldn't be complaints as well, we, as killers, have had plenty of time to adjust. This is literally the definition of "don't hate the player, hate the game" OP played well and used the tools at their disposal to survive, and they wouldve if NOED didn't activate. The difference is that Op used the map's design to their advantage while the wraith used a perk that gave him a free kill, as there's almost nothing you can do if noed activates mid chase except pray your team disables it before you inevitably get hit via bloodlust.
---
That's very true. The literal effort they out in to go to your profile and send you the message. They're the real hurt ones
---
‚Äúirrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexuality or homosexuals‚Äù 
---
That‚Äôs the dictionary definition and you seem to be pretty discriminatory against homosexuals so take a seat and stop trying to justify your homophobia.
---
Exactly what I though about this kind of meme
---
No Mither is supposed to offer an alternative playstyle. Buffing it to make it viable but different would go a far way. Maybe make it so No Mither survivors are completely silent (currently 50% reduction) would be a nice first step.
---
I've just noticed that a lot of the perks killers have to run are in response to survivor gameplay. For example, generators are being completed too fast for some killers to keep up, thus making Ruin almost essential if they want to have any type of meaningful gameplay. It's also been proven that when a group is focused with objectives, it is significantly more difficult for a killer to keep up; almost to the point where (unless they're running NOED), they wouldn't get any kills. 
---
My example also justifies the use of NOED - when you're pressured so hard, and chases are lasting so long (and let me clarify, not because of escape perks), then it's not wonder that NOED is so highly relied on; it's a last form of defence.
---
Despite the general(?) consensus that BBQ&amp;Chili is frustrating to deal with, it promotes healthy gameplay, not to mention it also has a counter.
---
Even the enduring+spirit fury combo has a counter, and that's ending a loop sooner than later, which is often only one missed loop. Even then, depending on the players, the survivor can still loop for 3. The combo, at least in higher play, doesn't pop off as often as one is lead to believe. 
---
Furthermore, if only a few killers can 'counter' MoM, that doesn't make it remotely okay. Especially when you make the argument that the killers who do counter MoM have an exposed effect, because yea like duh of course they're going to have an easier time dealing with survivors who have MoM.
---
New survivor?
---
I can not even post a meme.. Im getting downvoted for no reason over here..
---
There should be an option to remove the end game chat like they have in rocket league. There's plenty of toxic people there and you could be completely oblivious of it the whole time. Doesn't restore in-game toxicity but is something
---
Voices and looks of gay people do not differ that much from straight people.
---
Only a small amount of gay people behave like the stereotype.
---
They've always been huge points for complaints. Those windows cannot be mindgamed and are a guaranteed 3 loops always because the killer is forced to vault them. 
---
OP used a building that gave him free safety for 0 skill, and the Wraith used a perk that gave him a free kill for 0 safety. I see no real difference there.
---
Neither does tbagging at the exit gates for the entire collapse but that happened anyway
---
Frank's mixtape allows you to down people in frenzy just like before. However, it is not a good addon. You can only activate your power if the gauhe is full, and every time you hit someone already in deep wound with frenzy, it depletes it all. You probably should not run Frank's mixtape
---
I knew there would be at least one, lmao.
---
Sure your right it‚Äôs all situational. Sometimes it‚Äôs good to use the time to approach from a different direction. Sometimes you want to go the most immediate route. Changing it up a few times can make the survivors unsure what you will do. 
---
If they do run early and they choose the right direction to run in, then you can still sleep them and then ambush them at a later time. They are also off the gen and you can choose to chase or head to another gen to sleep a second survivor.
---
99% of you losers write "REPROTED FOR CAMPING BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE DIAPER BABY."  Fuck all of you, I'll camp you til your mom is dead.
---
That's what I've been missing recently, is the fear factor the game once gave me. It just dosnt seem to give me the thrill anymore.
---
&gt;I mean he disconnects in his videos which he really shouldn't do.
---
I've only seen him DC a handful of times, and it's usually when the killer is being toxic
---
This feels like a time traveller who came about a month too late for me lol
---
Messaging people does nothing outside of absolute noobs who dont know things.
---
Also if you did hump that shitty ironworks window im happy you got camped
---
Her isn't pc it's just drag ettiquette. I'm lgbt with SEVERAL drag queen friends so for me it's not being PC it's just being a decent human being. GTFO here with you petty hatred.
---
Pretty nice combo since you can either rush(if caught) or sneak(if not caught) away. Then gens become a breeze.
---
Nah 99% hooks are definitely toxic because you have like 3 people with toolboxes and then you can't hook anyone because they do it to almost every hook in the area. It's super frustrating. It ends up killing them in the end because then I just slug them and they waste time doing hooks instead of gens. It just delays the game honestly. And it's super easy to accomplish. All you have to do is work on a hook while the killer isn't near you and stop once it's about to be done, how is that difficult? All they have to do is click mouse 1 when the killer picks up a survivor near it. And flashlights aren't toxic by nature but survivors use them to be toxic. After every pallet stun they're blinding you and not even trying to get away, they just want to blind you. It's all a part of the game, it's a part of the game mechanics, but that doesn't make it any less annoying/frustrating when survivors are intentionally trying to piss you off. I'm not "acting like a victim" for pointing out a few things survivors do lmao. I very rarely have more than 1 person escape, playing killer is pretty easy, there's only a few killers I'm terrible with like trapper, wraith, leatherface. And I definitely get more BP as killer, if I need points I can just use BBQ on nurse and get 40-60k a game easily, survivor only nets you like 15-20k on a good game.
---
Exactly
---
But regardless, his content is abysmal
---
ok u know what, i give up, u will never change ur mind, just compare freddy with hag, huntress, spirit, legion,  trapper, doctor...wharever u want and then tell me why u think freddy is better than those killer
---
honestly dude i dont even know why its there in the first place and why people on consoles desire it. it has literally NO use other than opening a windows for toxic shit. its not like the pregame lobby where survivors can discuss stuff i get that , but post game? If people really want their "ggs" BHVR should add a token/honor system instead where you can simply vote for good/bad or something
---
you opened this conversation with GAY BAD what the fuck do you think i mean.
---
This got deleted as I clicked on it.
---
Fuck OchiDO that pedophilic cunt
---
You are able to collapse the chat window at the end of the game and it will stay that way until you choose to reveal it again. I turn it off the days I don‚Äôt feel like dealing with postgame salt. XD
---
That is absolutely not true.
---
I sometimes message other surv to let them know things like they can crouch on the hag trap or the fact that they shouldn‚Äôt unhook with the killer behind.
---
And sometimes they are grateful for letting them know.
---
Also 1. David was camped too and he didn‚Äôt do shit so there was no reason.
---
2. Why should I deserved to get camped because I jumped a window? My god
---
And the survivor is clearly working on that gen.
---
It's not about being PC. They're not actually trans. They're just playing characters. It's like calling Dame Edna or Lily Savage 'she'. You know they're really men, you're just talking about the character they're playing.
---
It's like going to a Punch and Judy show and when you call Punch a 'he' someone says 'what the fuck why are you using that pronoun, it's just a woman's hand in a glove!' Or using any pronoun at all for a book character. "Why use a pronoun, it's just words on a page, they don't really have a gender!"
---
If the majority of post game chat is purely talking shit why wouldn't they just replace it with a thumb up, thumb down or meh button then move on to the next game.
---
They're a guarenteed 3 loops IF the survivor is far enough from the killer in chase when they start to use it, also IF the killer does not have bloodlust from the time spent in the chase prior, also the fact that vaults don't get rid of your bloodlust means that even if they do get those 3 loops in, the killer will most likely be close enough to them to where they can hit them right after the entity blockers come in. Vaults slow the killer down a little bit, they are not as problematic as you're portraying it, and if you really have that much of a problem with vaults, put on bamboozle. The window is NOT a guarenteed 3 loops in many cases. The way you say op used 0 skill is just funny, considering noed is literally the only reason op got killed. Without noed, wraith probably wouldn't have gotten that kill. The killer did not use skill of ANY form.
---
This mofo had a chance to get legacy and he passed. Smh
---
That ironworks window is an incredibly strong loop which essentially requires you to chase a survivor round it till entity blocker as it doesnt havr any counterplay. Survivors who hump windows like this are scummy imo
---
I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs better. In the right hands any of those killers can be great. I think he is more unique and because of that he takes longer to learn giving the illusion that he is weak. I won‚Äôt change my mind because I have firsthand experience, so I guess we can both remain stubborn on the issue.
---
Honestly this game has made me grow kinda thick skin just from the salt I get from people. when I do get angry and rage I sound like a mentally Ill person. Man I wish this community was nicer.
---
No one cares you sad lonely little cunt
---
nea without her disguise huehuhehueuehue
---
There should be an option to close the chat window and I would go further that toxic people need to banned. There's always someone defending them like "you shouldn't play competitive games if you can't handle a little BM." That's not a defense; if you can't play well with others you shouldn't be allowed to. If their behavior requires a system to force people to play with them then THEY shouldn't be playing competitive games. Behavior that would get you banned IRL should get you banned in the game. 
---
And this is coming from an actual place keeping the toxic players in mind. I know one IRL and now that we're in our late 20's he's running out of friends and advancing nowhere professionally because he can't understand that there are lines you shouldn't cross socially because every day he's online trash talking on video games without repercussions.
---
Honestly no. The game is very mysterious about values in this game and sometimes you need to get a pen, paper, calculator, stopwatch and a buddy in Kill Your Friends walking up and down the brick walls.
---
legends of what? looking like shit?
---
Depends on the killer tbh. Spirit? Yeah, I kind of want to uninstall when I get that map. Hag or Trapper? Haddonfield please
---
There is no dc limit
---
Your mother's first words when you slithered out of her cooch?
---
So from what I assume you say that I need to go past the window and not jump it, let the wraith have a free hit with 2 person hooked?
---
It‚Äôs not my fault if I got that map
---
WGLF farming is all about protection hits and saves, what do you mean?
---
Yeah, didn't expect this kind of response. Oh well.
---
Ah, the old ‚Äúbad survivors‚Äù argument. Freddy can never be good cause even when he is, players just claim those specific survivors must of sucked. Perhaps nurse is only good cause people get lucky with matchmaking :p
---
&gt;main killers find it unfair when a survivor does something
---
Main killers who can't score kills do this
---
That sucks but go onto the next game. Rank reset just happened and I am having too really bad teammates like you, but I keep trying on new games. Eventually it‚Äôll be fine, just wait a week ar max. I really do not think at all that egc should be changed in any way: it‚Äôs already much that we get a chance to open the gates.
---
I prefer 3 blinks with pocket watch :)
---
Great üôÑ I‚Äôll look around, can‚Äôt be the only one wanting some actual numbers, thanks though.
---
imo, and for all the comunity freddy doesnt have a skill curve, like LF, u understand him so fast, a good freddy and a bad freddy doesnt have a complex ability, he is pretty simple, a good freddy will be weak too, he can mindgame and that shit, but thats all
---
Survivors who run from me are scummy imo. /s
---
Still he shouldn't put it in the video. Its like saying it's ok to DC, you don't need to put it in the video but he does. I get livestreams because well stream sniping and all the other reasons but there is no need to put in the video at all
---
Chaotic good.
---
Pebble is the best perk\*
---
FTFY
---
I don't play against sabo squads. It's where I draw the line. I think it's an absolute bullshit mechanic, especially when the survivors have No Mither. Hangman's Trick is a wasted perk slot 99.999% of the time.
---
I agree on that, this game is made for the 2 parts to be in conflict with each other (that btw it promotes toxicity af) but I‚Äôm more annoyed about the fact that I just wanted to give an advice and he got in an defensive position
---
Guessing you run Meg? I do the same.
---
WHY IS MY DING DONG HARD?
---
exactly.
---
Do people actually use spies now? I still haven't seen anyone use spies even after the buff.
---
imagine saying yikes
---
Ok :) I disagree
---
if the killer closes the match its seen as " i cant deal with that " its shown as weakness and people laugh their asses off.
---
It‚Äôs a solid perk. Not especially strong tho, and it encourages less experienced survivors to try for stealth gameplay which often makes them weaker in chase.
---
i've tried a few and they're kinda fun but i haven't tried some of them. I'll be sure to use them when unlocked if i don't wan to rank up that day.
---
you don't really have to have thick skin at all, tbagging doesn't require thick skin to ignore.
---
Daddy Dean Winchester
---
I want to run Plunders and Ace in the hole to get a ton of items and addons but i also don't want to level Ace yet and know i won't get Ace In The Hole on Meg.
---
Survivors hugging obnoxious structures are scummy. You essentially ignore them all game before you finally chase them at the end
---
Just pay attention to who you hook? It‚Äôs really not that hard there bud.
---
If they waste their toolbox and time on a hook they don‚Äôt know will be used it sounds to me like it‚Äôs a win win for the killer. Having strategy isn‚Äôt toxic in the same way that destroying totems that aren‚Äôt activated isn‚Äôt toxic. 
---
If survivors want to waste their flashlight on me after a pallet then more power to them, doesn‚Äôt bother me. Trapper is my favorite for a mid game killer. I enjoy picking a few specific gens and placing 2 or 3 traps around them at choke points and watching them set off like fireworks. 
---
If survivors ever get cheeky about flashlights and hooks I‚Äôll just take a quick trip to the basement with one and the game sorts itself out pretty quick.
---
NEA with that mid section in full force
---
When Myers beats my ass you better believe I'm gonna say thank you. Those are just facts.
---
You really are mad. Holy shit! 
---
You said you were done, but you couldn't stand that I WANT you to fucking stop. You just HAVE to try and save face with google searches and bullshit out your ass. 
---
You know nothing about this game, if you think you can convince me that what you have said makes any sense.
---
It doesn't matter if you can define unreliable. It was the wrong term to be used (by your dumb ass, btw) in the first place.
---
It's called Inconsistent. In fact, not even, because it's just inconsistent to people that are potatoes at the game.
---
You just have to know how to proc the hits, and you are ^juuuuust stupid enough to think that there is more to it.
---
Shut your stupid face. Please. I am sick of seeing your stupid comments in my inbox. Everything else is positive and open minded, and you are a child having a temper tantrum.
---
Of course use the window im talkimg about looping the same window over and over and running to it anytime the killer is a few feet away
---
Its never really worth it to prestige characters all you are getting is a cosmetic.
---
I remember that. They had a hard time playing as the Killer because of all the stress it caused them. I still think it's silly, like there are a LOT of things to be anxious about in the modern world and DbD is hardly even worth considering compared to them. I think it matters what level of anxiety you feel; when I see anxiety I assume you mean break out into sweats, mental confusion and intense shame otherwise it is simply being shy or being nervous.  
---
So, it blows my mind that people become so emotionally connected to a videogame and its players that it now is one of those things which they should feel anxious about. Something which causes them to break out in a sweat and genuinely begin hating their life. I do not think this actually happens to these people because they would definitely need to see some sort of medical professional if they had such a dramatic shift in mood after playing DbD.   
---
I'm not even gonna beat around the bush. It's some wussy shit. It's not even about having a tough skin. People get a tough skin when their parents abuse them. People get a tough skin when they get raped. People get a tough skin when they lose family or friends to suicide. People get a tough skin when they work 40+ hours a week as a single parent of 4. Because these are some of the things which you will need to develop a thick skin to endure.  
---
Sitting around pushing buttons on a controller/keyboard? Sure, kid. Go tell the therapist people are mean to you online and I'm positive you'll get an assortment of pills to make that go away.
---
Yes because you get better add ons and some pretty nice clothing showing you are at least decent as the killer you're playing
---
there is, however it's really high since the devs said the game was too unstable to always punish DC'ing players. they're decreasing the DC limit once the game is stable.
---
tough
---
I‚Äôm actually a Laurie main, just because I love the Halloween movies so much lmao. It makes it more fun because I‚Äôm sure the killers are surprised to see a Laurie sprint bursting across the map üòÇüòÇ
---
I just reply "baby rage" at this point
---
Survivors trying to survive are scummy. Looping is op. /s
---
Only if you want the cosmetics. For myself, because I have all teachable perks unlocked, the grind to get the good perks back isn't worth it due to rng. It will not get you better add-ons. It's a huge bloodpoint sink
---
Its too map dependent, but if you use the offering for Lery memorial institute, there are basically crows everywhere so its very strong.
---
thanks for sharing this - this is hilarious
---
is it really? is it any different than any other game oriented sub? no, it's not. just like how the game isn't any more toxic than any other competitive game. i think it's actually one of the less-toxic games since you can't always chat, only at the end.
---
Dude prob facing boosted survivors and thinks that MoM is bad
---
I mean, I hate tuneling and camping in general but they aren't technically cheating so I've never understood when people freak out about it
---
Spies From The Shadows is a bad perk, again, because they nerf the range from the perk.
---
And I almost never tunnel or camp...
---
Humping the ironworks window isnt just looping. Its looping a stupidly broken structure
---
The addons get changed over, well at least they did for trapper and wraith.
---
They wanna tunnel me? That's fine. I don't actually care if I pip or not and I enjoy the 1v1. After 1k hours it's the only fun I have in the game.
---
They better be ready to either only kill me, or get no kills as a result though.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for :)
---
I can for sure also see potentially aiming for one person if they're dead on hook or in second state vs. somebody who hasn't been hooked yet. Makes more sense from the killer perspective
---
&gt;Humping the ironworks window isnt just looping.
---
Okay...
---
&gt;Its looping
---
......huh......
---
Honestly I have to agree with him wraith with average-goodnaddons is basically impossible to win against
---
yeah they nerfed her traps when the endgame collapse came out :(
---
One of my favorite things when I play killer is telling people that they whooped my ass and I had a lot of fun (and ALWAYS say thank you when they help with a daily.) People usually see that they got a little rank 20 Huntress with one perk and no add ons and then they're like "Aw. You tried little buddy you'll get there."
---
This game attracts weirdo incels and girls with coloured hair.
---
I‚Äôll say GG when I both legitimately had fun and I was also legitimately challenged
---
Youre joking right?
---
At least this community can come together about shirtless Myers

I played hag against a swf team, can confirm

NOED doesn't rewards bad players, it might yes. But it also punishes careless survivors. To complain about NOED if you didn't even cleanse totems is like giving someone with a gun a bullet, you are just killing yourself.
---
If they legit beat me in a close game I'll give them a GG. Can't win them all.

Oh ok thanks

Hey no one likes you :)

If i want a certain perk the entity makes sure i never see it in the bloodweb. Instead gives me hangmans

When you play Freddy.

Single most entertaining trick.

Sleep survs running into a basement to unhook.

When they get to the stairs you literally just pop into existence at the top.

*‚ÄùYOUR IN MY WORLD NOW MWAHAHAHA!!!*

‚ÄúPeople‚Äù don‚Äôt know what they are talking about and go off the little lore the devs give them. If the devs were given the rights for Xenomorph, he‚Äôd be given a spot in a heartbeat and the lore would be modified.
---
Billy wants to know your location
---
I mean, are you not just as bad? You are coming onto the post, calling people toxic, and then defending his actions instead of being reasonable and talking through your qualms with this post. For example, you could have been very reasonable and said "Well, he is viewed as toxic by the community, but that is just in game, in which publicity is good, even if it portrays someone as an ass. Being talked about means that more people check out his channel. Now, I understand that a lot of his fanbase uses these excuses, but this is just a stereotype and not everyone is like this." - You are acting very immature about a game and one of its content creators. We are discussing him on a forum about the game, making jokes and jabs. You came onto this forum and got angry that we are insulting you. Maybe calm down, drink some tea, listen to some Classical music. Have a nice day.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I'll update it!
---
I swear everyone always feeds him stalk but he M1s them twice then the second he finds me he pops his tier 3 every time.
---
yeah cool stuff bro. tell that to the person that had these anxiety issues.  I hope she is still around.
---
Survivors also like to run urban and crouch.
---
I feel like he‚Äôs only slightly worse than wraith because he can‚Äôt hit a surv right after they get unhooked and if someone is near an open gate. 
---
Well...they go poof. 
---
I just bought him after having not played for like 2-3 years and when I realized that he obviously has some problems I was pretty upset. 
---
I feel like I paid $$$ for content I literally cannot use or really enjoy. 
---
Matches with him are usually painful with SWF, I can deal with flash lights sometimes by turning away and doing a huge sweeping lunge.
---
But for me it‚Äôs the self-care. It should have a cooldown. 
---
Why can‚Äôt it just have a cooldown?
---
Would that be so bad?
---
Why? It's a broken window and it needs to be fixed by the devs but survivors have to use it to escape. They aren't just going to run past it and avoid surviving
---
Uhm jeah?
---
Other subs I joned have specific rules for that like:
---
'' Low Effort/Karma Farming Posts Are NOT Allowed ''
---
Or meme-free days.
---
I wish we had something here.
---
Did OP really flair this as shitpost after people started disagreeing with his crap idea?
---
have you not been reading I've been saying? My problem isn't JUST that OP ran the window, my issue is that people who abuse overpowered things, DO NOT GET TO BE UPSET WHEN THEY GET FUCKED BY OTHER STUPID THINGS
---
I love this meme

GG

If they‚Äôd had Dance With Me too there would have been ultimate confusion.

I'd have less of a problem with NOED if I wasn't the only one on my team taking the time to cleanse totems. &gt;.&lt; I don't run a full 2nd chance build so I'm the one on my team that gets fucked by it while they all run out the door. Thanks team.
---
I know you pain mate
---
Coolest match I had was when a huntress found me right off the bat so I looked up while running, got downed quickly, then she ran around looking up for a couple seconds before hooking me, when had 1dc and the rest of us got sacrificed and the huntress and I had a Lol after the match because I didn't even care about anything else when she ran looking at the sky like I just did
---
No lie I told a 4man swf that absolutely annihilated me, "gg y'all are great survivors" and it blew their minds hahaha. Pretty sure they had "ez" typed in and ready to fire and then were pleasantly surprised.
---
At least billy is somewhat counterable
---
Yeah good point
---
Quick question about the optimization progress - does it also apply to killers on console? The last patch introduced some significant performance improvements on most maps, great job on that, but it was mostly on survivor side. Is there something about killer that makes optimizing the game more difficult?
---
Two hatches that gives the survivor an unfair advantage and ultimately defeats the purpose of endgame collapse? GENIUS
---
Noooooope. You still can't manage to make a point. You're still dumb.
---
On a serious note, pretty sure those statistics were pre-EGC.
---
Gets me every time, pure gold.
---
Wait a *Killer* has the advantage against *1 survivor*? Who would‚Äôve thought
---
Dont use this level of sarcasm..
---
Yeah I didnt really watched his content either. Only his early content back in his Chiv days
---
Haha funny
---
At first glance I thought Wraith was a turkey. :)
---
It's a team game. You can still pip with a shit team, you just are not likely to escape with a shit team.
---
Well if the survivor who dcs not having fun why should they stay?
---
Or bunny Feng.
---
WHERE IS OUR BUNNY FENG DEVS
---
Since the buff to spies they have since nerfed it twice. It was good for about a month.
---
DEVS NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER! I GOT DC'D TWICE LAST NIGHT WHILE PLAYING WITH MY SISTER! BOTH TIMES IT SHOWED ME THAT THE KILLER HAD DC'D AND I DIDN'T LOSE A PIP, BUT SHE CONTINUED IN THE MATCH EVERY TIME! I DON'T LIKE DC'ING RANDOMLY!
---
Surprisingly I'm a Red Rank killer. Any DCs are usually midgame and are death hook rage quits.
---
Oh ok haha then what would that build be? I'm new to the game and I'm experimenting lol
---
*revs chainsaw*
---
CAN I PLEASE PLAY AGAINST A KILLER WHO ISN'T RUNNING RUIN, NC, AND BBQ. I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE THE BEST AND IT'S NOT PLAYERS FAULT THAT THEY ARE THE META BUT IT GETS BORING!
---
Seriously, what is it. He's supposed to be banned. He will stay banned.
---
As someone who cannot play killer because of health issues, you have no idea how horrible it is to level your characters with only survivor's bp gain, especially when you're a new player. I've been playing since December, and was lucky enough to participate in the winter bloodhunt, and yet only half of my characters are level 40+.
---
Doesn't help that most killers on ps4 play like cunts and camp/tunnel like crazy.
---
I agree that killers should have more bloodpoints since it's an active role and they're here all game, but in that case just buff both survivors' bps and killer's bps. Also, it's goddamn impossible to max out all of your bloodpoints as survivor because of how badly designed the "survival" category is. I've never seen any survivor earn 32k, and if they do, they're probably a unicorn.
---
That's just his mori.
---
Looks like The Church of Unitology brought a marker to the hospital.
---
Yeah but youre wasting a perk slot when you could get good at chases and use op perks without handicapping yourself witg only 3 perks that are good

It's not wasting a perk slot if you like the perk
---
This is a repost my friend, let‚Äôs see some OC
---
Nice arguments you have here.  :)
---
Once you start getting friend requests with phishing links you put your shit on friends only or private.
---
I think a good game its a game that you enjoyed, it doesnt care if you win or not, maybe the killer was a good killer, you had a good team or you just feel that you did well even if you were hooked
---
I play killer the way I'd expect a killer to play against me. That's all you can do. Everyone has their own definition of tunneling and camping. They range from reasonable to outright ridiculous. I expect everyone to try and win. All you can do is play your game.
---
Fatal Colonoscopy.
---
Not sure if this sub deserves this quality of shitpost...
---
I once ran from Myers with Tombstone piece till his EW3 ended. He promised to bring mori and tunnel me next time. Never seen him since.
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
IronWorks building is one of the most broken looping locations in the game outside of the infinite Haddonfield house that spawns.  Using OP tactics like against an obvious new person that is akin to spawn camping them in a FPS.
---
&gt;I dunno why but they reward us with -2 pips when we DC...
---
Not on PC. If you DC, your pips are back once you restart the game.
---
I agree, I'd love to see repeated DC'ing rewarded with bans, or maybe they make you depip, but also face rank 1s for the next few days.
---
really like the fact that people are going to get punished for disconnecting.  However, I feel like what people are going to do is just kill themselves on the hook.  Would it be a good idea to have a system where we could report a person for intentionally killing themselves?
---
I'm messaging from my phone app. EZ
---
haha funny, could you stop be annoying to people who want to run those perks? ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run noed, don‚Äôt run MoM, don‚Äôt run spirit fury‚Äù run whatever you want
---
&gt;Oh ok haha then what would that build be? I'm new to the game and I'm experimenting lol
---
Barbecue &amp; Chili, Nurse's Calling, Shadowborn (optional) and Deerstalker or Whispers.
---
Have you tried not tunneling?
---
It's really not as bad as you're making it out to be, especially considering op didn't abuse it. I don't understand what exactly you want. Theres a vault there. That whole building would have nothing to avoid the killer if that vault didn't exist unless you had balanced landing, it'd just be another dead zone, if you're caught in that building, what exactly are you supposed to do? Are you supposed to avoid using the window as a loop? You know, literally the only way the survivors can fend off the killer in a way where it's meaningful and buys time for your team to get something done? And what if op didn't even vault the window? Does that change the fact that the killer has noed and gets a free kill?
---
Nice
---
It's in the pile of perks that are great when you're new &amp; learning, like Windows of Opportunity and Distortion, that lose some of their shine once you've played a long time and are bored of just sneaking around doing gens all game.
---
Is that the new Nia skin?
---
its true lmao, good survvors will loop him until daylight, but bad survivors just runs on the corner of the map
---
I've always found it amusing that the "acceptable" way for killers to play is also the easiest way for survivors to escape. Like the whole point of a killer's existence in the game is to make sure the survivors have fun.
---
Freddy is very different from every other killer. If you play him right you can be an oppressive force on even the most coordinated swf. But he is still very tough. Being good with freddy usually means you are generally good at the game and very familiar with the mechanics.
---
Because whispers cannot be countered, spies is easily countered by just crouching, some maps have more crows than others also.
---
I can live with that.
---
I think it‚Äôs one of those perks that you throw on a killer you haven‚Äôt leveled up yet so you can quickly rack up points.
---
It kind of really does lose its purpose after that
---
I mean, the argument that it's only good with enduring doesn't add much since enduring is already a very meta perk. 
---
It'd be much better to play around it if you had any sort of an indicator that SF is in play, not seeing the killer for the 1st minute of the match and then getting a surprise feels pretty shitty. At that point counterplay is "assume they already have it and never go for pallet stuns".
---
&gt; And what second chance does it even give
---
Negating the pallet is huge, if someone is injured and they get a pallet stun they can get a ton of distance/if you are against billy/leatherface then they can just chainsaw you.
---
Do you watch his streams? His fans are not what you say they are. They're actually pretty wholesome and actively discourage toxic behavior. Please stop spreading misinformation to fit your delusional narrative
---
It increases your speed while using your power not for base speed.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Freddy: can I have sleep
---
Entity: we have sleep at trials 
---
Sleep at trials:
---
NOED should grant 1 kill max IF survivors didn't get the totems. Instead, survivors tend to perform a cavalry charge at the hook and turn what would be a 1k into a 3 or 4k.
---
I know some survivors think the black box effect is a bug. Some of them know so little about killers and add-ons that they ragequit if they see anything unusual. Not an excuse though haha.
---
I didn't know there was a specific definition of holding the game hostage when I made that. Yes the killers I encountered were being assholes, not holding the game hostage.
---
How do you not enjoy when people get pissed in the post game lobby. I feed off the salt.
---
‚ÄúStop liking things I don‚Äôt like‚Äù
---
when i get those,i just answer with GG or simply Ignore.
---
but dang,hate mail on console is very harsh.
---
NOED is a shitty perk that serves only the really bad killers.
---
It's sad.
---
Your comment sounds dickish...
---
Let me explain.
---
I play 50/50 killer and survivor.  1v1 is a pain on both sides depending on the type of player.  I'm not suggesting anything op here.
---
I'm just saying if you're downed and the hatch is shut and there's absolutely NO way to get out because you cant open a gate.  A luytle hole would be fantastic.
---
It also encourages perk use.  Blood warden could trigger as the crawl space is used, giving the killer a chance to ooen the gate and pick the survivor up.  Whispers can help you find a survivor on their way to the crawl space.  Deer stalker avoids the issue all together.
---
...I guess my point is, unbreakable is hardly worth using and the chance of getting a helpful key when it matters is slim at best.
---
Hope that makes sense.
---
since when is that toxic? you want that timer running fast. Just leave and let him
---
die.
---
And gen rushing stops the killer from playing. 
---
All this comment did what prove my point
---
Those are his streams not videos not everyone one of his fans watch his streams. And did I say all of them are toxic no not all I think some of them are nice but the people that just watch his videos are extremely toxic and aren't you basically generalizing all of his fans say they are all nice? Obviously not all people that watch his videos are toxic but most are.
---
The Xbox version is legitimately worse than the PS4 version. Behind on fps, objects popping in, and shit like this. Doesn‚Äôt help that the player base is lower as well.
---
I just started playing the killer again and I found that survivors tend to be a little more toxic. For example I was playing the wraith last night because I needed my daily and two of the survivors got away and even though I had almost 10000 more points than anyone else they were saying I was in a shit tier killer because I let 2 of them get away it was very odd.
---
ive been thinking this exact thing for ages, but i do think that abit of camping or tunneling bitching is justified because sometimes it is actually bs and it ruins the game for them when the killer could just not ruin the game, but alot of bitching about tunneling and camping is survivors not seeing things from the killer‚Äôs perspective and being salty that they died
---
ITT: killers pressing m1 on me is toxic
---
Adr has no real counter, unless you count killing the survivors or the add-ons for legion which applies broken. But there is nothing a killer can do to prevent Adr from activating.
---
&gt;level 1
---
I'm sure you're pretty on the inside.
---
üëÄüòÇüëÄ
---
I thought this post would be open minded to both sides but it very clearly is killer biased. I'd be happy to talk about problems on both sides, but I feel like it would just be an argument.
---
swf possibly
---
Yes, but actually, no?
---
If you camp/tunnel but then complain about surivors rushing you, you can literally only blame yourself for this. If you put no pressure whatsoever and keep focusing on one area/survivor, what are the survivors supposed to do?
---
That also comes down to the ratio. More survs = higher chance of meeting a toxic survivor
---
I mean there's an easy way to not see this shit, don't click the video. If you're afraid of glancing at it, then cut out your own eyes, that way you get rid of two problems, playing a shitty videogame and stop being a toxic waste.
---
Even when I play a survivor. I don't get pissy with whatever the killer does cause its the game, if you get caught 1st thing then it's GG and do better next game.
---
I wonder if you run no mither on him since its 50% quieter but ace is already quiet if its like iron will
---
EndFury isn't OP, I wouldnt care. 
---
if someone is running NOED or 5-blink Nurse and have the audacity to complain about something the survs run then yeah I would treat them the same as OP, asshats who with 0 self-awareness.
---
Just be mindful of who you hook and down afterwards and this is just a straight up buff to Enduring + Spirit Fury.
---
Calling out hypocrisy and poor community management isn't "killer bias".
---
What do you want? Legion bad nurse OP? Like honestly what do you want to hear
---
My favs are Fungoose, Morf_UK, And Umbra.
---
OH NO
---
Can you explain what about whispers makes it such a 10x ‚Äúbetter‚Äù? Every time I run it as killer the talking voices throws me off and I keep thinking it‚Äôs trying to tell me hot and cold at the same time.
---
I‚Äôm a day1 survivor main but I‚Äôve played a fair amount as killer but not as knowledgeable as survivor side when it comes to killers.
---
Finding survivors isn‚Äôt the issue it‚Äôs losing them and having to search again that throws me off and costs me killer games.
---
It‚Äôs really funny as survivor I can use just 1 jungle gym to evade/move/hide when a killer is searching for me but when I am killer I am unable to think of this mindset for some reason and I become all potato like till I‚Äôm tragic :,)
---
Oh, so you mean like each survivor having 3 lives, one spend each time they get hooked?
---
Does not sound too bad to me because that means killers would never need to camp or protect hooks, they just down, hook/mori, chase all over again.
---
That could work and sounds like a more active game, but also needs to take in mind that now because there is no unhooks is going to be harder to have the killer distracted enough time to do the last gens.
---
Agreed, if I get two teammates down in the first 20 seconds I just stand under a hook and go for a smoke,
---
" This is why the devs listen mainly to survivors " lol ok.
---
i've been on Autohaven maps after Legion as Freddy multiple times but not since mid-chapter. this is bullshit. i hate to ragequit because i literally was starting to get migraines of how impossible it was to see, too fukin bright. i don't remember Autohaven maps being so bright.
---
I mean what if that's the point of his power? You can kill chucky but once he comes back he's more powerful and faster because of how pissed he is.
---
Ok, but it exists still, if spies got a buff tomorrow you could counter it completely by running 1 perk, if whispers got buffed tomorrow theres nothing you can do about it.
---
You honestly think the devs only listen to survivors? That's just wrong every single patch survivors are just getting nerfed I get they aren't supposed to survive but they deserve at least a chance. The point about camping and tunneling is  wrong just because it's the objective to kill people doesn't mean it's ok to camp it ruins the game for everyone involved. NOED is also counterable but it is as bad as MoM it rewards wrecklessness and bad play it doesn't encourage people to play good because they have these op perks obviously both sides have op perks but just because it has counter play doesn't mean it's healthy for the game. This is coming from a killer main btw
---
Yeah all the ignorant salty killers right?
---
It does have a counter. 
---
Don't let them do the gens
---
To be fair, this isn‚Äôt a game played for its lore, I‚Äôve been playing for about a year and figured that the Entity is some abstract cosmic horror forcing the survivors to face brutal killers in nightmare realms based on popular horror movies. With this, basically any killer can be added and fit in.
---
&gt;doesn‚Äôt do the closer to the screen lean when playing killer 
---
Surely this is a spy amongst killer mains
---
Wait you can loop nurse? this is news to me.
---
Both sides cry loud about things trying to get them nerfed/buffed on their side's favor, anyone telling you is "one sided" is lying their ass off. Freddy got nerfed, DS got nerfed, Legion got nerfed, Self care got nerfed, NOED got nerfed, Exaustion perks got nerfed, BBQ&amp;C got nerfed, BT got nerfed. Its been a pretty balanced sheet of nerfs and buffs and most of them because of how hard people from both sides complain in the forums to try and keep the whinning balanced because they noted it worked.
---
I don‚Äôt want this to be interpreted as me defending OchiDo because I think he‚Äôs an awful human being, but these claims are allegations. We can‚Äôt just throw him in jail over some allegations. Until we get some solid proof I‚Äôll withhold all judgment.
---
I have to disagree on saying MoM was worse than  DS if we are talking about when DS first came out but if we are talking about the first fix for DS then yeah I also disagree with you on saying the community is 4 survivors to 1 killer thats how games work but not how the community works especially since theres people who play both sides but I agree with the other stuff you said
---
&gt;Wipes entire SWF with memebuild
---
&gt;&gt;"Shitty killer"
---
It just depends on the person. I enjoyed talking crap to pissed off survivors at first, but it got old really fast, and I start to dread dealing with them. I actually stopped playing for a few months because of it, and I eventually just set my Xbox to block incoming messages. Now it's nice :)
---
The devs have already acknowledged that the hitbox problems have to with animations, desync, and latency. For those saying doctor has the worst hitbox, that simply isn't true, every killer had the same exact swing hitbox, although Myers has the shortest and longest lunges. Every other killer except nurse has the same length lunge. It's way less a hitbox problem than a desync/animation problem.
---
Divine as the next Killer !?
---
Lolol
---
&gt; This is why the devs listen mainly to survivors
---
Oh so that's why they nerfed exhaustion perks, healing, vaulting, pallet amounts, pallet vacuums, BNP's, DS, flashlights, building loops, etc.. in the last year or so. Not to mention they're about to nerf MoM now too. 
---
If you agree with all these nerfs then that's fine (most were healthy balance changes), but to sit here and say the devs mainly listen to survivors is so ridiculously silly at this point.
---
&gt;gen rushing is treated as an okay thing to do
---
&gt;Meanwhile camping/tunneling killers are downvoted (even though its literally the killer version of "playing the objective")
---
1. Survivors doing their objective is not ok
---
2. Killers doing their objective is ok
---
Pick one, dude.
---
2 Weeks and we get more information on that Freddy rework so hopefully we won't be dealing with this stuff too much longer.
---
I feel like it's a generation thing. Never seen someone my age complain about kids being rude online.
---
I'm 16 and I really don't understand how people in this sub are genuinely affected by lobby chat. Yeah, every match there is people telling each other to "git gud" and "stfu noob, lmao ez" but like for real, that shit really offends you? 
---
Just say gg and move on. It's not hard. Assholes will be assholes. You don't need thick skin to play this game - all you need to do is REMEMBER that it's a game, and have fun.
---
I'm not defending sending hate mail but its not that much effort at all. It's like 4 clicks and then you type out your message.
---
It would have cost you exactly $-20.00 to say that and yet you did.
---
I was calling out the hypocrisy is what you guys say. That flew right over your head didn't?
---
What an all time classic
---
but i love him as he is:c i'm Freddy main for like a year and 4 months
---
All I‚Äôm saying is I know that look.
---
Hey man ‚Äîif I don‚Äôt keep my feedback real, how can they improve the game?
---
Did you just call fixing vacuums a survivor nerf?
---
Oh no they balanced the game after 3 years of killers rioting. How dare they
---
Also why is the dream world so bright its supposed to be a scary place
---
Although I dislike noob3‚Äôs content (I find it repetitive and boring) it‚Äôs not nearly as bad as OchiDo. Regardless of the sexual assault allegations (yes, allegations. Not defending him though, he‚Äôs a piece of shit) his content is awful and he shows and abuses exploits. He‚Äôs a toxic asshole and has avoided bans multiple times.
---
Depends on who I'm playing
---
Survivor: I use Plunderer's Instinct and Acr In The Hole with Open Handed and We're Gonna Live Forever. Basically I loot chests and give them to my pals.
---
Pig: I like Distressing because since they hear the heartbeat from far away and it fades, they never think that pig can possibly be near, and then get I YEET them by giving them a big ole yOink. 
---
Doc: Any build with me pal Herman. He is legit fun as all hell. 
---
Freddy: Gen rush those other 4 gens all you want, you ain't touching my 3 Overcharge gens lest you wanna be bitch slapped.
---
Legion: I am a sadist for game slow so Sloppy Butcher and Thanataphobia with Legion Pin or act like Doc and go with Distressing with Susie's Mix Tape and Never Sleep Pills.
---
If it's a baby nurse
---
One time I was too lazy to cleanse the fifth totem thinking to myself "Why would Myers have a NOED?" Neadlessly to say I didn't survive that game. Lesson learned.
---
Those are the types of gay people i accept. I have 1 as friend.
---
i can unsay that for 20 bucks
---
I‚Äôve been looking to use plunders and ace to grind addons and items. Taking forever to level people up though.
---
Wraith is still mid to low tier unfortunately üòî
---
&gt; (most were healthy balance changes)
---
You must have missed this part that I very intentionally put in there. Fixing pallet vacuums was a good change, but just because it was a good change doesn't mean it wasn't a nerf.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to alarm you but
---
It's a bit of both.
---
There are 4 survivors in a game versus 1 killer. All you need to spoil a mood is one toxic asshole
---
Whatever you say little sad boy.
---
NOED is definitely as bad as MoM one hitting people for playing garbage is bullshit and cleansing all the totems just to not get downed is so stupid countering it is so time consuming and and unfun same as MoM I don't want to play hillbilly or Nurse to have fun in a game. Honestly I've barely seen any killer nerfs sure pig got nerfed but they plan on testing it so it could change they also kinda buffed legion and they are reworking Freddy.  the perks survivors use don't even allow them to single handly take on killer plus the killer can easily counter pallets and windows with the perks we have and now we have endgame survivors barely escape now unless they get lucky so yeah not many chances to escape.
---
Probably. I‚Äôve rarely played ace but he seems fairly quiet and No Mither would just help with that. Maybe No Mither, Resilience, and This Is Not Happening with one other perk like sprint burst or Balanced landing?
---
Nice reflexes with the dead hard.
---
The constant cosmetic ones are definitely from teenagers.  Theres a lot of obnoxious ones.  But God forbid I post about how killers keep dcing and I'm the bad guy..
---
Yeah but compared to PC players who can literally type it straight away there and then. Its 'more' effort hence why I don't see it a lot
---
No one believes you have friends, much less a gay one.
---
Wonder if she can give a handy like that?
---
Sadly for me no one but Ace has them both, but I've nabbed several good items with it. It won't help in gameplay, but it is good for farming items. Also, try out Pharmacy. You get a good Green medkit first time guarenteed and searching chests is quicker and quieter (or, QUICK AND QUIET!)
---
They owe me and every other survivor in the game a full round since they literally signed up to play the game and play that specific round. This isn‚Äôt some social justice thing where we don‚Äôt owe each other shit. It‚Äôs legit rude to dc out of a game because that‚Äôs like quitting halfway through monopoly just because someone already bought broadway and they‚Äôre gonna win anyways so you might as well quit while your ahead.
---
I know this is an old thread, but I got dominated by a rank 15 nurse on Xbox yesterday.
---
Would rate 69/4200
---
"What a kill!"
---
\*Chat has been diabled for 5 seconds
---
Another word for it: 
---
‚ÄúCunt‚Äù
---
If this is defined as "holding the game hostage" then so is survivors tbagging at the exit gate and refusing to leave until the last second. Literally the same thing.
---
I‚Äôm probably gonna try to run Plunders, Ace, Pharmacy, and some other looting as one setup for farming items. Might not escape every game but that doesn‚Äôt matter if i get an item practically every game that i do.
---
Well obviously i say it ironically, imagine saying xd
---
Literally just the mask that looks similar.
---
I got the leaked patch notes right here for his rework
---
* Grants a speed burst for 1 second upon ~~uncloaking~~ pulling a survivor into the dream world.
---
I always take it at face value, I gg in hearthstone whether I win or lose. Am I naive?
---
Scarred Hand + Rusty Shackles. It looks like she's hacking or lagswitching but I can assure you it's completely legitimate.
---
DS surely didnt get nerfed because they listen to survivors. Thats for damn sure
---
This reads as if you're blaming the people the insults are aimed towards rather than the people insulting them.
---
People will say that often in post chat on PC. Heck, I‚Äôve said it to a camping killer when I‚Äôve escaped.
---
My hopes of getting a momento mori keychain have been shattered once again
---
 *Platform:* PS4
---
*Type of Bug:* Ingame
---
*Description:* i got stuck in a pallet on Gideon whilst swinging through it to land a hit
---
*Screenshot / Video:* N/A
---
*Steps to reproduce:* It was a pallet against a wall and when dropped it leans against a stack of water barrels. This pallet was in the upright position and, whilst in chase with a survivor, I swung to hit the survivor. The survivor dropped the pallet and it stunned me. I then couldn't move, nor could I destroy the pallet. Interestingly, when the last generator was powered I was freed. I was on the water barrel side of the pallet when it dropped so I would've been trapped between the dropped pallet and the water barrels
---
Some very important bugs going on that will hopefully be fixed: (I'm on PS4)
---
1) obviously the gens not giving bloodpoints if you complete without stopping
---
2) Endgame collapse giving permanent exhaustion
---
3) I ran into a kindred bug the other day where i was able to see my teams auras even there was no hook. (They were on the other side of the map and i wasn't running an aura reading perk, no aftercare from other teammates either, i believe i have it recorded on my stream somewhere)
---
The popular usage of the word homophobia is behaviors that disparage lgbt people. Everyone knows that including you. If you dont want to be labeled a homophobia maybe you'd enjoy bigot instead. Just because "traditional" gender roles are all that you've ever experienced and enjoyed, doesnt mean it's the right way. So you can prefer to not associate yourself with LGBT people, it's your right. But its mine to call out homophobic assholes such as yourself.
---
Pulling that off on is especially easy on Azarov's resting place. Especially if your Ruin spawns on that side.
---
Its a meme to say ‚Äúis that a jojo reference‚Äù lmao
---
Captain Hindsight or Captain Obvious?
---
I'm blaming them for the fact that they choose to let themselves be offended, yes.
---
Being an asshole in DBD is a big issue. This can be fixed by better chat moderation, report system that actually works etc etc.
---
Letting toxicity from a video game affect you in real life is also an issue. But it's an issue due to the fact that the person allows it to be an issue.
---
To summarise - both sides need to grow up; those hurling the insults, and those letting the insults affect them.
---
Maybe not but i will try my damndest!
---
Me and my friend say it after everygame as a meme, even if we die
---
The entire basis of this idea is to make the game feel fresh to play again.
---
I think the majority of us are in agreeance when I say that the same is super unfun, unrewarding, and just a hassle to try to play and enjoy.
---
A big fundamental part of this issue I believe is the lack of diversity and potential in the perk system. I have found that there are numerous perks in the game that, by themselves are lackluster, but if combined with others, can become something very good, however, the dainty 4 perk slots do very little justice to open up this potential, and with new perks being added constantly, I think it's time they redo the perk system.
---
The entire idea around this is designed to break the meta, and give people the full possibilities of builds they could think of. 
---
I've went about it, thinking "is this perk impactful to the player and/or the game?" and went about giving them the amount of points I believe corresponds to this ideology. Obviously it needs flushing out and balancing, but that's not the point, the point is making the game fresh and fun to play again.
---
"Without order nothing exists, without chaos nothing evolves."
---
^credit to the Ardetha discord server for this little quote.
---
I feel no mither and dead hard are the combo. But yeah Ace is super quiet unless the killer is running stridor youre good.
---
ah, I thought it was after the go from drowsy into full dream world you would get a speed boost
---
Who know you might like the new one more.
---
The two already work well together,
---
They could do it by removing the end game chat... Most games its GG EZ Baby Killer or smth or why you camp?, only rarely its GG's or actually nice discussion.
---
I don't get the Wendy's part
---
And the dude playing janitor "Fred" is Wes Craven, director of *Scream* and writer/director of  *Nightmare on Elm Street*
---
hey what if it was Charles lee ray and his power was looking through chucky dolls scattered around the map and seeing where survivors are?
---
I can get pretty competitive and ill-tempered after a round goes bad sometimes, and I've been working on it by just faking it. Suck up whatever rage I'm feeling and just type "gg" anyway. I'm hoping eventually it becomes habit and my mindset adapts with it. Reeeaaal hard to maintain when people shit on you in the chat after a match though.
---
Sadly the effect of the add-ons is rather negligible. It impacts the movement speed after you place a survivor to sleep I.E the movement speed during the animation of placing someone to sleep. 
---
It's rather poor &amp; only worth anything if you stack to them together. To be honest it should work during a survivors transition phase. Would make sleeping during a chase a reward &amp; allow for more mind-game potential.
---
I find it pretty easy to catch survivors with the gas , even when the palet is thrown actually. Its forces them to do slower vaults when their gassed. Of course on long loops its harder , but all killers need limits*cough* nurse *cough* so we cant expect him to deal with everything. Plus zoning is pretty usefull( e.g. the shack).I guess its a matter of playstyle with him. I feel he is solid mid tier but its only an opinion.
---
that's what my mum said when my first guinea pig died. spoiler: i didn't like new one (T_T
---
What rank are you? I'm on ps4 and I get messaged all the time. Fuck you baby killer got to use ruin, tunneling loser, camper, etc.
---
Frenzy doesnt count towards it? TIL
---
It allows you to hide in plain sight. But you're not rewarded for stealth and it's often misused.
---
You‚Äôre....interacting with...the ground? That sounds about right. I will now make a formal complaint to the devs about this revelation and force them to add running as an interaction.
---
/s
---
One time someone asked zubatLEL how to counter gen rushing.
---
His answer: "Easy. You just kill rush them."
---
Well every game is different with skill. For example you cant just play nurse for the first time and 4K. the guy/girl who can accurately judge blinks AND out mindgame survivors has played her and learned. other than that there is strategy to get used to every different killer or even learning how to loop.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Gen rushing is ok. Part of the game. By the same logic camping and tunneling are also ok. People have to remember it's a fucking game and if you aren't having fun you might try playing something else.
---
Take the post game chat away from PC, I‚Äôm sure there is a number of players who only play the game to chat shit
---
Absolutely, Reddit saw Legion in a grave even though they weren't
---
Why?
---
Survivor is slowly going from easy difficulty to medium difficulty, people don‚Äôt like that.
---
Meh I think devs do listen to survivors more because there are more of them lol. Still as a killer main i would say besides the sound issues the game is in a pretty good spot so far.
---
An SWF group once mass reported me and let me know in the post-match chat. We were playing L√©ry's and I was the Wraith. By pure luck whenever I was stealthed I just kept running headfirst into them in the hallways. I wasn't using any tracking perks or anything, I was just patrolling gens and anytime I took five steps there was a survivor, so it was a quick match. Afterwards they all accused me of hacking.
---
Samething happened on ps4
---
So how would Trapper dealing with gens popping? Should every killer just play Nurse then?
---
Also, just find the totem lol, its not that hard
---
I like this idea I would be really happy with this
---
yep, neither does the Pig Dash for example
---
I find he‚Äôs still annoying to play against whenever I play survivor, and I play legion as killer 75% of the time and still manage to get kills. Not getting a 4K every game but that‚Äôs never mattered to me. People just love to find any reason possible to complain.
---
even left and right, as long as you have played him for a few matches, isnt that hard to land...
---
Lost to a legion last night. Only because he had bbq and chili and was running ruin. Didn‚Äôt know any of that till after the match. Plus, we were on the swamp stage.
---
Hard disagree from me as someone who has played both sides regularly since close to launch, for solo survivors there are so many variables that go into a having a good match, like being at the mercy of your team and relying on their competence, sometimes your game will just be over because your teammate decided to farm you on hook or disconnected at the start of the game because they got caught.
---
There has been countless times where taking a break from survivor to play killer has been akin to a nice relaxing beach vacation in comparison, where I get to control the flow of the game and often  the only variable I can realistically blame would be my performance in the match.
---
The recent change to not allow 3-survivor games to start has been a much needed step forward for the solo survivor‚Äôs quality of life and the health of the game in general though.
---
Killer(not including Nusre) never felt easy. They will feel what we felt.
---
Really, Urban Evasion depends on the killer. Its god against the Hag and Useless against the doctor. Not something i would normally run.
---
Clearly the idea of hypocrisy is lost on you people
---
yeah there is a lot of hate messages on ps4 but i don't see this phrase often, even tho i say it a lot myself (not to killers or for bm, meme reasons). It's a pc thing
---
I type out "Good game." to bring that extra level of sophistication to Dead By Daylight.
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
The nerf they're suggesting is dumb, makes the perk pointless. Unless you're gonna run empathy and take hits for the person being chased..
---
Exactly. Like a fake smile on someone's face.
---
I would imagine the point behind sharing their idea for a nerf was to see the community reaction and get feed back.
---
Fucking 
---
L O L
---
Same goes for MoM. And don't forget 4 survivors can run MoM and very few are actually capable to counter it.
---
sheesh
---
Well hello there, Panda.
---
Umm..yes? Didn't you read the killer main approved rulebook? Survivors aren't supposed to try to survive. They have to run in a straight line away from killers
---
All killer mains*
---
I would say devs listen to survivors more than killers simply because there are more survivors than killers. DS deserved that nerf lol. That being said I personally think balance wise the game is in a pretty good spot right now. Need to fix killer audio and hitboxes for survivors, need to also do something more about people disconnecting. But other than that this is the best the game has ever been.
---
Its not the devs fault that the community is so toxic and full of campers. How do you suggest they fix it?
---
Cool.
---
I appreciate this so much because a lot of the times i will say GG and mean it even if i lose and people think I'm mocking them like Nah dude i mean it. But this is the game got to keep the positive going to show not all us out there are not douches. Keep up the positive vibes guys!!
---
They want us to sacrifice our fun for theirs instead of sacrificing them to the entity.
---
You get a lot more hate messages when you play as killer, as theres 4 survivors so 4x the hate, but if your killer then you must be getting either 0 kills or lucky.
---
"Letting insults affect them" isn't a good term. There are some, who do let it get to them yes (which I am guilty of from time to time). Others who have anxiety and such don't get a choice. Sometimes people with anxiety can have it flair up just from how someone looked at them, or a touch, or loud sounds, or people getting angry at them. Yes there is medicine that can help reduce anxiety flair-ups, but it may not always work. So telling them to toughen up isn't the right answer when they literally cannot toughen up.
---
I've taken the view that every match I play is a movie to me, sometimes there us a good ending...sometimes it's a bad one.
---
This allows me to have fun with every match and give the killer props when they off me. Every ending is welcomed.
---
Borrowed time only works for the unhooked so it only benfits them not you adrenaline isn't used until the end so you're basically doing a 3 perk build but also some maps barely have any drops so balanced is meh MoM is really the only problem there because of adrenaline with it. Sounds is not a nerf it's a bug so wrong there they did buff legion He's faster and his add ons Imo are better they just made it so you can't spam m1 to get closer.
---
honestly thats why I go for center gen first. If the killer is chasing someone else that usually buys enough time for one, and usually some time to start a second. Stupid proofing against your team is annoying but necessary
---
nah you can make them lest toxic just got to be a good example then a salty miner teaching them to be that way.
---
You sir are full of shit.
---
no, it's not, better use an another perk
---
perk which slow hook progress when is killer in near radius of hooked survivor
---
It is radius based. But once you get the hang of it you can have a pretty good idea where the survivor is just by knowing they are in the area.
---
Nah you're right, this game is saltier than most. But I think it's thanks to the asymmetrical gameplay where 1 person needs to suffer in order for the other to win.
---
Well I'm gonna continue wether you or I like it... because my pc freezes for a good 5 seconds at the start of the game thus making me automatically DC as a survivor or make all 4 survivors DC when I'm killer. So yeah. There also the people being forcefully DCed from a game.
---
Funny how all the idiotic killer mains are playing the "jUsT dO ToTemS" and "jUsT USe SmAlL GaMe" card while simultaneously crying about the iron works loop. 
---
"JUsT uSE BamBoOzLE"
---
Hypocritical killer main at it's finest...
---
They said: We will nerf the Pig this way. Now they said: we are not sure but this is one of the things we tought were an option. Also nerfing a almost balanced killer is stupid. Nerfing an OP perk is balanced.
---
i am playing against lag switcher now
---
we have really lot of fun
---
You are wrong the game is balanced besides only MoM and NOED once they fix those 2 the game will be great I barely encounter glitches that break the game plus dedicated servers is fixing lag I don't know how you think this game is in a bad state.
---
This dude is one of the biggest hypocrites on this sub.
---
"Letting insults affect them" isn't a good term because... it will hurt people's feelings? 
---
It's a perfect term because it describes exactly how it is. You admit it yourself - you can fix this by having more self-control and understanding how to master your emotions. Being offended is a choice, and either you decide to be offended or you don't.
---
The majority of people don't have these anxiety issues. Also, notice how I had a separate paragraph excluding my opinion that those people need to toughen up. Mental illness is real, but let's not act like DBD is the sole cause of all anxiety.
---
I use the build to unhook people right in front of the killer if they camp. It's good for endgame. Like I said I escape with it all the time. In my opinion the nerfed the hell out of legion. He misses a swing? No more power. He gets stunned? No more power. He hits you twice. No more power. Plus they decreased his frenzy movement speed and increased the terror radius. I literally have no problem with the new legion. The old legion was toxic and annoying to play against.
---
It did worked for me. But once 2.7 hit they fixed it.
---
Your comment is purely irrelevant.  No one said anything about the act of killing the first 3.  I was purely referring to the unbalanced state of the hatch close and how the rework leans absurdly in the favor of killers.  If you close the hatch you will 4K.  They really don't have a chance unless you're really really bad.
---
i love this hahah so good
---
That's simply not true. If you ever pay attention to when you get protection hits its quit often it can be from after unhooking, taking the agro, taking a hit when multiple people get off a gen, etc. Where it is now you literally just get a free hit from a killer doing what he has to do and only can do.
---
Careful; they're heroes
---
...people lag switching is NOT the devs fault tho?!  
---
F
---
(PS4 would like to know your location)
---
Honestly if you're worried about toxicity in post-game chat just close it. I think being able to disconnect from a lobby without closing the post-game stats screen would help a lot.
---
Ash, David, jeff
---
Circuses always have a horse, don't they?
---
People were complaining about Pig nerfs and the Legion rework before anything was finalized. Also complained about MoM well before the perk was even released. Yet survivors are supposed to wait till something is finalized before voicing their opinions? Ok, lol.
---
Also, using your own logic it‚Äôs better that Pigs traps are useless after gens are done as opposed to being too strong when combined with EGC. Yet you complain daily about it.
---
What's wrong with targetting a weaker survivor at the start of the game? Is that tunneling to you? Seems like a decent strategy to me
---
Her fingers would need to bend a lot further than that to hold mine
---
Ash, Jeff, Jane, Jake, Quentin
---
They made legion risky but great for good player IMO but it's subjective as for the build I see it all the time and they never a escape you must be getting bad killers or I'm getting bad survivors who knows.
---
To be fair NOED is easily countered by just cleaning dulls along the way.   
---
Just go and ask your teammates in post-game chat how often they ran past a dull totem while playing and didn't cleanse it...  
---
If people would just quickly cleanse them along the game there wouldn't be any NOED complains really.
---
What does that mean? You have to be standing behind a survivor?
---
I mean that technically should be how the game goes. The killer should be reactionary to the survivors in how they survive. The survivors have a singular goal of doing generators to lead to an escape, anything else they do is to aid in that, working together, keeping each other alive, distracting the main threat to them.
---
The killers job is to stop them in doing so. The killer should for sure have the power going against fewer people, as evident by majority of matches people had of just a 2 man or even 3 man game with 5 gens to repair due to baby ragers or legit disconnects, where they devolve into either a massacre or the killer feeling sorry for the survivors having no chance and it becoming a farming game.
---
The main obstacle of the survivors should be working together to get out of there. Whereas the killer should simply stop them, if emphasis was placed the other way around, as seen in killer matches where the killer clearly has the advantage from using an OP build with a Mori it wouldn't exactly be an engaging match. I mean I personally don't have fun against inexperienced survivors I kill within 3 minutes during rank reset and I doubt the game will be engaging if tons of killer matches ended up like that.
---
I just brought up the enduring SF combo as an example of how it can 'feel' unfair in that even though you're playing as efficiently as possible it can still be countered, killers feel as though if they successfully down a person, they deserve to hook them, probably why they see certain strategies as toxic, and I'm not saying this is you, but you wouldn't believe how many killers I've run into who hate flashlights, pallet stuns, bodyblocking, etc. to make a survivor wiggle off simply because it takes it away from them. Survivors face stuff similar, when a killer gets a jump on them without indication of the usual heartbeat, maybe they got cross map no scoped by a hatchet, maybe they were hiding but then screamed from madness, maybe they escaped the Freddy but he sees them anyway cuz they're still in dream world, etc. and I can go on and on, but when the standard gameplay is tossed up to favour either side it's always going to feel unfair in the moment, but having to see how much variables there are in the game at this point.
---
The common point people bring up is the 4 man coordinated SWF group at red ranks completely dominating with these meta perks and that the game should be balanced around that, I'm sorry but I don't think it's fair to balance around 3% of the playerbase and like 3 of the killers.
---
I personally don't think every killer should counter everything in the game with their basekit, you will end up with very underwhelming perks then on the survivor side, and if it's ever brought up in a way, same with survivors toward killers. Part of the difficulty is not knowing who you're going up against and what map it will be (map offerings not included), because I think we will just end up with a worse meta than we have now.
---
Dude survivors have lost perk after perk, mechanic after mechanic for the better part of a year.  But killers still want more.  I don't get it.  It has NEVER been easier to play killer than it is right now.  And it just strikes me as greedy to take anything more from them when killers have it so good at present.  I've played killer for over 2 years and our games are a joke at present.  If you want to nerf one of the final two strong perks remaining for survivor in MoM or Adrenaline you better at least be willing to offer up a totem counter for the other sides babycrutch.  But no killer must remain untouchable no discussion for the biggest crutch perk in the game...it just strikes me as very very hypocritical.  And I feel killers like you won't be satisfied until survivors spawn on hook.
---
Just minimize the chat or block messages if on console
---
Not gonna lie... I actually really like that idea.
---
Jeff screams sounds like he is busting a fat one so him definitely Ash is also loud think Kate is also.
---
I think it should be one protection hit to activate. Maybe wait 60 seconds before it can be used
---
Go troll somewhere else, you posted before about changing MoM to affect instadowns.
---
https://imgur.com/a/4ChbmHi
---
Go to settings and controls: you can change all your keys bindings from there
---
ya you can go into your settings and switch your keybind for vaulting/throwing down pallets i believe, then you should be fine
---
If a survivor vaults a window thats blocked on your screen, its because its not blocked on their screen
---
He really is, he flip flops between bitching about survivors to bitching about killers. He posted awhile back that MoM should affect instadowns. Wish someone would just ban the troll already.
---
ez insidious buff
---
No scratchmarks could definitely be a big help, I like that idea
---
Guys, stop bullying u/DARKSOULS103 !!! We're gonna make him cry üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
It is not my idea. There were a lot of good solutions, but devs just ignore them.
---
behind or in front of
---
and they changed protection hits to be super picky (for some odd reason)
---
All killers run that?
---
Nah, it's not a good term because you lumped everyone together. You did separate in your original comment yeah, but you still just made it like medicine will just make everything better when that's not the reality of it. I live with someone who has very high anxiety and depression. Medicine doesn't solve everything. 
---
Yes you're allowed to be frustrated, but you shouldn't take it out on other people. Talking trash online isn't the way anyone should go about it in any game. It'll never stop obviously, because people never get punished for it in any game. So yes some people do need to learn to ignore it and move on, but there are some who can't ignore it and their mental illness gets the better of them.
---
Not if the perk would work in a way that the killer cant be in a certain radius of the hook.
---
I doubt they ignore them, it's just that they have a fuckload of things to work on man.
---
It is still really unfun needing to cleanse dull totems just because the killer may have NOED they could just make a totem that looks dull but is lit.
---
Yeah. Right. 
---
So take a buggy mechanic and make it your primary activation for a perk. 
---
It‚Äôs a dumb mechanic. I should not have to run around (and THROW) the game to get MoM stacks.
---
Ash, David, Jeff, Kate. But iron will is just a good perk.
---
ez kindred nerf then. Anyways it‚Äôs not the killer‚Äôs fault if the teammates keep swarming it
---
Ahhh I forgot.
---
Will I get downvoted if I think his videos are at least entertaining. I‚Äôve actually learned quite a bit of skills from his videos. Not the toxic ones.
---
It‚Äôs good at losing killers after you‚Äôve made a decent amount of ground. It‚Äôs also  just generally good to be able to circle cover quickly. It‚Äôs a decent QOL perk of nothing else, but I‚Äôd also wager it to be generally great.
---
I've been leveling multiple killers and for some reason I always got at least tier 1 NOED by level 20 for 6 seperate killers. Entity just can't help itself
---
Oh I guess that makes sense. Guess I don't need to buy the DLC then, haha. What will be the meta now that its gone?
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: Every now and then, after logging back into DbD, you'll have a good chunk of your progress reset from the previous day. Bloodpoints and items returned, character levels set back, etc.
---
It's pretty disheartening to log back into this game and see that the last multiple hours of gameplay was just a complete waste of time. I have a friend who has this happen to him almost daily.
---
that would be way too easy to get rid of it.  
---
besides it really doesnt take away much time at all if everyone would be on the lookout.  
---
i mainly play surv. atm and if i get hit my NOED at the end of the game but saw 1-2-3 totems I could bite myself in the ass for not taking a few stupid sec. off and cleanse them.
---
Strategy will get you further than any perk. Play stealthy until you have to play aggressive, don't unhook near the killer until there is no other option, prioritize gens over everything else. I don't escape all the time but I escape more often than not. And I get a pip most games regardless.
---
Cross progression should be added.
---
No. That sounds abusive as heck. 
---
I'm not a noob, I just don't get hate. Worst i got was someone complaining I was using Freddy.
---
This is the survey link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SXRQ6R8
---
thats true, but there are also alot of cases where the killer isnt swarmed and just sets up a tent and camps...
---
Nothing you said addressed the fact that you bitched and moaned about the potential pig nerfs before they were even in place. People felt strongly about those changes and made a difference because the devs obviously take feedback into consideration. 
---
You don't dictate what people are allowed to voice their concerns about. Get over yourself and focus on making more fake statistics.
---
No Consoles ... T.T
---
Didn't see the (No stretch cases please)?
---
The title says it too, "DC on purpose."
---
Don't know why you decided to bring up technical issues. Not trying to bastardize you.
---
&gt;you still just made it like medicine will just make everything better when that's not the reality of it.
---
I know this, that's why I never once mentioned medicine. I just said they should seek help and learn strategies to cope and hopefully take better care of themselves. Idk why you keep bringing medicine up, you are projecting a little bit.
---
&gt;I live with someone who has very high anxiety and depression. 
---
In that case you are more than an expert in this than me. I hope both of you are doing well.
---
&gt;there are some who can't ignore it and their mental illness gets the better of them.
---
Yes, I know. But these people are the minority. Most people just are adults who have childish moments. It makes me confused why so many of these people are drawn to DBD when they can't control their emotions due to unfinished mental development, also known as simply growing up.
---
 I'm 99% it's a generation thing - I think a lot of adults are surprised about how much of an asshole us kids are sometimes, but it's to the point where it's normal to us. We don't take offence, and rarely kids are thinking about the consequences.
---
rly eZ
---
who knows
---
&gt; I think being able to disconnect from a lobby without closing the post-game stats screen would help a lot.
---
That would help, but maybe also an option to auto-disconnect also, i mean as the killer theres no point of hosting the endgame chat so you can get irritated. and i checked on the game, i actually forgot you could close the chat.. thanks for telling me about that.
---
Surprised nobody is talking about how boring he is.
---
This sucks for consoles player Because they can't participate
---
If you care what people think about you, Hello Kitty Island Adventure is that way ---&gt;
---
Which rank?
---
It is possible, but i wait too long. Camping and looping were the biggest issues since 2016.
---
Game is balanced now, they did it well.
---
1000 hrs from 3 years you must not play enough OP.
---
Yeah ik it just needs to be reworked in some way like MoM
---
QUICK! PUT A BAG ON HIS HEAD!!
---
They owe you nothing. You can see it as rude, inconsiderate, or whatever else you want. The only rules any players have to adhere too are the ones set by the devs to participate in their online service. Since dcing is not a bannable offence, it is by definition not against the rules. No one signed an agreement stating that they had to stay in a game with any other players if they do not want to. To demand that players do so for your sake, or anyone else's, is more entitled than not adhering to rules they never agreed to. As rude as it may be sometimes.
---
As always.
---
You sound dumb af!!
---
Ik I'm just saying surviors usually die because they think perks will carry them but they don't anyways Dont want this discussion to get dragged out have Good day
---
Whispers is really helpful if you know how to use it. You can save a lot of time instead of searching for someone who isn't there. Spies is kind of RNG based since some maps don't have a lot of crows or the crows are in weird spots where no one goes
---
I had a friend argue that it isn‚Äôt sportsmanlike to say gg even if we got stomped, guess he just isn‚Äôt cool
---
Cloverfield monster.
---
Amen!! What's the point of making a perk if they are gonna nerf it and make it useless.
---
Yeah, I don't mind Freddy so much. I don't even totally mind Wraith using it, but the one-hit down people who use it? They are clearly either not good at killer, or they're insecure, or just totally rank-hungry.
---
I‚Äôve done it (not proud), but the PsMessagges app its really easy, just need to type the PS Id and done, you can say ‚Äúwhy is always a f***** bubba camping‚Äù?.
---
Noed is easy to counter, just cleanse all the totems you see. Takes a small play style adjustment but isn't that bad.
---
Imagine being so dumb you think the game was better in 2016 when BNPs literally completed gens instantly
---
Imma be real with you, no one actually cares. Just leave the lobby or hide chat, it's not hard
---
It doesn't even make sense when you really think about it. " I want to save myself later from getting downed. Let me go intentionally get hit and put myself in danger/keep myself off gens to save me from getting downed later."  
---
So it pretty much helps the killer because you are off gens and he will know where you are because you're bleeding, moaning, and nearby. Screws over your teammates because you aren't doing gens. It isn't even worth it. You may as well just take dead hard.
---
Peter Dager, is that you?
---
Tunneling has its use cases as does camping. If there are two people in open right next to a hook you after a save it mathematically makes sense to go after the injured survivor 2&gt;1. If your playing hillbilly in the same position you could make the argument of being nice and going after the uninjured survivor but even that doesn't make logical sense. If you smack the injured person down and then go after the healthy one with your chainsaw you gain more time overall. If you chainsaw the healthy person first then go after the injured person your wasting more time. Obviously this changes depending on a variety of circumstances.
---
Its much the same when it comes to camping, if I am defending a 3-4 gen setup with a survivor in the middle, I am making the most of my time. If I come back to a hook around the time someone is about to hit stage 2 on the hook and camp them for 10 seconds I am saving myself 50 seconds each time I do that as it allows me to prevent them from being saved.
---
Both tactics have their application, it just depends on the circumstances.
---
kindred bug is on xbox as well.
---
Doctor came after a vote for a chinese style killer and we pretty much memed this doctor into the game, beating jiangshi(Chinese zombie) and black&amp;white Impermanence.
---
Unbothered tho.. it's my opinion and yall get so tilted by it.i love it.
---
&gt;Dude survivors have lost perk after perk, mechanic after mechanic for the better part of a year. 
---
I wonder why... Is not like survivors were way too overpowered back then. Of course it took multiple courses of straight up nerfs to bring them down to a more balanced state, what did you expect?
---
&gt; It has NEVER been easier to play killer than it is right now.
---
Yes, I agree but this is only because survivors have been brought down from where they were. 
---
&gt;And it just strikes me as greedy to take anything more from them when killers have it so good at present.
---
The recent issue was Decisive Strike which got reworked to a more balanced state and instead of letting the community chill for a while, they released MoM a few days / weeks later. Of course people are going to complain, MoM is basic DS 2.0 if not worse.
---
&gt; If you want to nerf one of the final two strong perks remaining for survivor in MoM or Adrenaline you better at least be willing to offer up a totem counter for the other sides babycrutch.
---
You see, this wouldn't be balanced because it would almost guarantee that NOED never procs considering how awful totem placements are in the majority of DBD maps. I also disagree with the mindset *"yOu NeRfEd ThIs, MuSt AlSo NeRf ThIs"*, you nerf or rework things that aren't balanced.
---
&gt;But no killer must remain untouchable no discussion for the biggest crutch perk in the game...
---
Again, survivors have more control over NOED than the killer itself AND, it only procs after the killer already lost all gens. From this moment on, getting more than one kill will rely on how altruistic survivors are. If they just open the exit gates and leave, how is that a "crutch"? 
---
NOED is cheap but is very far from an unbalanced or crutch perk. 
---
&gt;And I feel killers like you won't be satisfied until survivors spawn on hook.
---
What makes you think I am arguing as a killer? I am arguing as a player and not that it matters but, I barely touched killer in months.
---
Love &lt;3 together we can do this!
---
Who's the owner on youtube? I wanna make a perfectly cut screams for this.
---
Honestly theres been games where I've cleaned like 4 totems myself, it really isnt that hard to negate the perk if your teammates arent dumb. Problem is finding survivors that know the game enough to do that stuff lol
---
The number 1 reason people who die don't say GG is because they're not going to sit around waiting for the match to end just to type GG. When you die at any point other than literally the last minute of the game, you just go look for another lobby. It's nothing personal. People just want to keep playing.
---
Again console ignored
---
Sorry you're right, when I saw "medically diagnosed" in my head it implies medicine. I'm at work atm so forgive me lol. 
---
Yes, we both are good. I don't have any anxiety, I just take care of my wife who has it. Thank you.
---
And lastly I like your point on the generation thing, about yall just being dicks and not caring about consequences. I can definitely attest to that. I work with some people even just a few years younger than myself (26 here) and they just seem to not care that they can get fired for even having their cellphones out. Blows my mind.
---
Did you ever played solo? I recommend you to try it.
---
Yeah. I bitched about MoM a while back, then realized it‚Äôs only super OP if more than two people run it, and they‚Äôre both strong loopers. I played against it for weeks. Very rarely does this situation happen and I‚Äôm in high rank killer. 
---
This new change, which won‚Äôt be implemented, requires survivors to get off their objective to hopefully get there in time to take a hit (3 different times). This wastes so much time in every category of the game. 
---
The devs have become more aware of the actual problems in the game and they‚Äôll make a new change for this perk. No way they implement this. 
---
If they implement this, I‚Äôll jump on the conspiracy train of the devs making good perks so people spend money just to kill them a few months later.
---
But wouldn‚Äôt the strategy be to hook the obsession, proxy camp/tunnel them for a rehook, then repeat a second time to get your 3 stacks as quickly as you can? I really think they are moving away from stuff like this that rewards and promotes unhealthy playstyles. That‚Äôs why they probably don‚Äôt care that DS screws with Dying Light currently.
---
Yes, he was voted in.
---
Here is the original doctor who this killer was based on - link to wiki 
---

---
I'm getting a big Silent Hill vibe from this skin
---
You people should just a free hit for literally nothing? There needs to be something for them to be able to get a free hit and taking protection hits seems like a fair trade. You are taking a hit for someone at some point so you can get a free hit later on.
---
lmao you have to camp to win what are you rank 20?
---
Same here. I used to take everything so personally but I‚Äôve learned that I don‚Äôt need to take advice or insults from anyone who tells me to ‚Äúgo kys‚Äù or just some stupid bullshit. Honestly, I feel really bad for these people who take the time out of their day to message me hate. Like, you know nothing about me as a person and that‚Äôs enough for me to not choose to value your opinion of how I play a fucking video game.
---
I feel like Im out of the loop. Is this a meme template or why is it so funny to people?
---
18
---
I play solo almost exclusively and my biggest complaint is simply getting teammates that are complete apes, has nothing to do with the game itself
---
I had someone tell me "You're abusing your small heartbeat, how am I supposed to run away? **Wat** was my only reaction
---
People talking about how cringe the fan lore is written... the actual canon lore is cringe. BHVR needs to hire an actual writer. Most of their shit isn't even properly copy-edited, let alone written well.
---
BHVR probably can't harvest or monitor data they plan to gather from this thing they're doing, on consoles.
---
It‚Äôs absolutely mind blowing how people on Reddit will argue their point without reading their opponent‚Äôs actual comment. 
---
Nobody in this thread is saying that MoM doesn‚Äôt need a change. 
---
We are saying it needs a valid change, not to be gutted. 
---
You aren‚Äôt taking ONE hit, you‚Äôre taking THREE. That‚Äôs a 1:3 ratio to activate. This is a problem because of how protection works. 
---
If you can‚Äôt see the problem with this, you‚Äôre incredibly biased against survivor and should not be discussing balance.
---
Naa, the horse is just part of the circus
---
I completely agree. So far I haven't been screwed over by it because survivors usually waste it too early in the match. It is definitely stronger closer to end game or where multiple survivors have it, so I can see why devs are looking at it. These suggested changes, however, are nonsensical and plain stupid.

I once had a 4k doing that but with paint brush and Z cube.

Sleep them, and when trying to unhook the guy I just pulled them and hooked them next to the other guy.

the best was to actually be able to see it afterwards, it was a twitcher and he was really mad.

Type of bug: Splinter Offerings for owned killers
---
Screenshot: I'll reply with it if needed
---
Description: Splinters for killers that are already owned are showing up in the bloodwebs when I don't know if this is intentional. In my case when I was buying bloodwebs on my Michael, I was trying to get Fragrant Tufts of Hair to go with my tombstones, and I couldn't find a single one but the entity would tease me thinking I finally got one but it's a Bone Splinter! (Multiple times) Leatherface is the first killer I bought. But I own all of them. It's probably worth noting that he's the only one I've bought with auric cells rather than the pack bought from the PlayStation store and Bone Splinters are the only ones I've been getting.
---
Yeah, but barely anyone uses rancor. NOED really is BS though.
---
This made me die
---
Wes Craven was a genius.
---
This is the current state of the game:
---
Mettle of Man doesn‚Äôt sound that great to newer players. Only experienced, good players know the value of this perk. If you have four people running MoM, you‚Äôve already lost the game unless you‚Äôre the nurse. So even if they didn‚Äôt have MoM, you‚Äôve lost. 
---
This is the problem with Mettle. One Mettle does almost nothing in the grand scheme of things. If the killer loses more than 30+ seconds due to this extra hit, they‚Äôve already been chasing this survivor for too long. 
---
I complained that MoM would decrease variety in killers you verse, but it doesn‚Äôt. I see M1 killers all the time. They need to find a different way to activate it, or add a more harsh penalty.
---
Recently saw a colonoscopy. Fuck those things are horrible.
---
Insidious on hag
---
Lmao what the hell. This game just gets better and better
---
No one is saying it should require nothing. Throwing yourself at the killer 3 times and leaving you vulnerable/not on gens makes the perk do more harm than good. This is a shitty requirement and they can probably find other ways to make the perk still useful.
---
I guess i won't be buying ash then lol, you have to actually throw the game to get your perk to work ONCE? Feeding killers free hits (SB &amp; NC) &amp; chasing injured survivors to get your stacks?
---
idk why this just made me laugh out loud...really hard
---
Ohhhhhh trust me alot people know... they're just too fucking lazy to take off a few sec. :X
---
Kind of like noed rewarding the killer with insta downs and a speed increase...
---
üòà
---
Amen to that.. gotta take hits for someone else to activate your perk ...
---
actually no, id say NOED is perf. fine the way it is.
---
Ok I have a feeling you are trolling now
---
kinky
---
Trying to activate a perk will throw the game against a half decent killer. Too much time wasted. 
---
Little confused what the devs were thinking. I thought they‚Äôve been doing a good job recently too.
---
Why would you search for one and watch it, you know it's gonna be unpleasant when they surgically stick something up someone's ass.
---
I always say gg but I always like my after match chat spicy
---
Or use high rank stridor which let's you hear NORMAL breathing louder which I find to be more accurate anyways. Whispers is too general to me and I only ever get it to pip when I'm near a survivor and not actually for finding one.
---
Noob has mellowed out so much recently. Honestly, I think he took a few licks, got humbled, and now plays with people who are a positive influence on him. If we were talking about 2017 to early 2018 Noob3 I'd be right on board, but I feel like the kid has grown up a lot in the last year and isn't the mini-ochido he once was. He's pretty self-deprecating about what an toxic asshole he used to be.   
---
And by all this I mean he doesn't bully, trash talk, and BM like he used to. I don't consider an aggro Survivor play style to be toxic. In game mechanics like insta heals, flashlights, and looping are there by design.
---
I didn't search for a youtube video - I'm a 16 year old student and I was in the room with the doctor to watch him work. I saw a bunch of cool things, but the endoscope was fucking disgusting.
---
Doesn't seem point when you get downed by NOED does it hotshot?
---
Not to mention you are depending on your teammates to be close enough to you to even take the hit. Having multiple survivors get off gens to try to take hits would be a killer's dream though.
---
I genuinely cannot figure out how to work Whispers. It seems like on every time I use it, it‚Äôs just constantly active which is not helpful at all.
---
I honestly question that with some of the survivors I've been getting lately. I've seen some of the duuuumbest shit
---
So how about that nerf
---
Guys it‚Äôs the killers job to kill  and the survivors job to survive. who cares if he used nord it‚Äôs  a good powerful perk who cares if he window looped he needed to buy time . Also if you are upset about him being defensive or don‚Äôt like when people are defensive why msg him it seems you were just salty about his noed and wanted redemption of some sort or too put him down. But that‚Äôs just my opinion if he wanted help he would of asked
---
Nice, you're getting $5 back.
---
‚ÄúJuST RuN EmPaThY‚Äù 
---
You can see the true ‚Äúkiller and survivor mains‚Äù when these balance posts come out. 
---
Imagine wanting the game to be fun for both sides. Crazy to imagine.
---
For fun. Moris are more fun than just sacrificing. An alternate way off killing.
---
Damn that hate for ochido, he‚Äôs not that bad, I actually learned a ton of things from watching his funny moment compilations...
---
I guess it just depends if you're trying to play the game at 100% efficiency. I play 50/50 or 40/60 survivor/killer and I can see both sides of most arguments on this subreddit. Even if I'm near someone as a killer when they get pulled off the hook, I go for the uninjured person 99% of the time because they had no choice when they got saved, and I fucking despise when I'm a survivor and a teammate saves me as the killer is walking over, and get instadowned and back on hook or killed. It's *so* frustrating. I want the game to be fun for everyone, so I always try to win, but also be lenient with who I go after. The only time I tunnel is when a survivor gets under my skin and is being super cocky; teabagging/pointing after every vault/pallet, spam clicking their flashlight and turning around mid chase etc.  
---
  
---
As for camping people accuse me of it all the time but it's ridiculous. I can literally see them around the corner ready to unhook someone and they get pissed at me for finding them and smacking them away, why would I let you save your teammate? The only time I actually camp is when I have someone on hook with the doors powered and multiple other survivors alive. You walk away from that hook you're asking to be robbed of a kill.  
---
I like to think I'm a fair and fun killer, but even when I try to be fair because I know how much it sucks being a survivor in some situations I still get get people flaming me after the game. Which I don't mind I actually love salty tears but it's just crazy that I try my hardest for everyone to have a fun and non boring game and yet people always have something to complain about.
---
He‚Äôs a pedophile and he‚Äôs extremely toxic promoting bad behavior and he‚Äôs overall a huge twat
---
Well, it doesn't seem like you want to try to learn the new totem placements...
---
Side note: I like that people are using the updated meme format with the hand
---
how to be a prick just do this
---
Wait this isn‚Äôt r/undertale
---
Nice meme
---
Yeah the survivors probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to really see each other in their world cuz they were all from different countries until they found each other by the campfire lol but it‚Äôs fun to imagine
---
I rarely see salt as a survivor main, but I also don't spend a lot of time in the 1-9 ranks, lol.  What really bothers me though is bullying survivors who are being rude in the postgame chat.  Like yeah, no shit I'm not great at killer, I'm rank 19...what do you expect?
---
A game like that would be hellish and Balanced Landing needs a nerf in my opinion(only have the stagger reduction work when not exhausted) but disconnecting still isn't the right option for that. Also, if Prayer Beads bug you so much, Spine Chill is a good counter. As I said, it is unfair for your teammates and you become a part of the mass disconnecting problem.
---
Talking(or writing) is silver, silence is golden
---
You: "EVERY GAME i play as a killer theres atleast one guy in the postgame lobby thats harrassing me, talking shit"  
---
Also You: "But most of the people are just salty, crying kids that cant accept they lost a game."
---
Hypocrisy at it's finest.

Honestly any allegations of the type of pedophilia is an extremely loaded gun and a very dangerous one.  It will very well kill someone even if it's proven to be untrue, so if you're going to say someone is a pedophile then you better damn well have extremely solid evidence to back you up.  
---
Ochido still deserves all the shit he gets, absolutely, it's just I've never seen it being solidly confirmed on the pedo allegations.
---
i think it is  pretty obvious by now
---
+duration add ons are easily the best, the knife add ons would be good if deep wound was actually a threat 
---
Fuming mix tape is meh, unlike wraith‚Äôs all seeing add on, you won‚Äôt have you power active near enough to justify running it 
---
Iridescent pin is useful, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it incredible, being able to break pallets by vaulting them saves you time later and the terror radius can spook people but that‚Äôs it
---
I can hear this gif lmao
---
Yeah he did but he DC's in vids sometimes which bothers me because people usually do what they do I do like his content but sometimes maybe don't show that you disconnect.
---
\*Gets down once\*
---
OMG THIS GAME IS BULLSHIT
---
\*DCs\*
---
Resume of this post: 
---
Camping, tunneling and NOED, are Ok.
---
BHVR is survivor sided. 
---
Delete MoM.

Dont waste your time here like me. :)

Ive noticed this too and also they hardly use traps its it's interesting.  I thought it was from rank reset since trappers are more common in rank like 15-20 but it was happening before the rank reset when i was rank 9 during the double blood points weekend. Soo many trappers who place like 3 traps a game
---
I feel it isn't in my opinion it's just idk endgame plus NOED feels a little off plus blood warden I don't hate it where it's at it's just in a weird place imo
---
Thanks for complimenting me! And i also do believe in your right to believe what you want to believe/say what you want to say and it should stay that way. The only reason i dislike the idea of homosexuality being praised is the fact that it could potentially disturb my day-to-day life if i was living in any non-nordic country. I do not mind any gay people that don't act different normally due to their sexuality and don't praise it thinking "I'm different, that means i'm important and a higher tier citizen."
---
Okay sure, sorry for being entitled to want to play a full regular game without having people being little bitches and quit on me just because they don‚Äôt wannna play the round anymore. Like are you really defending dc‚Äôing? Like it‚Äôs something that everyone is annoyed by so much to the point that the devs are going to do something about it. That says a lot about how annoying it is when ppl dc. Like you don‚Äôt have to finish the round sure but then at least let yourself get killed so that way survivors get more time and the killer gets points. Instead you‚Äôre just throwing a temper tantrum just because the round isn‚Äôt going the way you want to. The conclusion is that people who dc are annoying simple as that. And sure I may be entitled to say something like that but at least I‚Äôm not doing something so rude and annoying that the devs are gonna have to punish me for doing it so much.
---
It's hilarious that you want your money back after playing something for 3 years. With your play time, even if you purchased all of the DLC, we're talking less than $0.20 an hour. The developers built a game with certain mechanics that you don't seem to like. They're not obligated to change those mechanics to please you or anyone else.
---
This is like going to a movie and thinking "I don't like it" in the first ten minutes, but you decide to sit through it anyways to see if it'll get better. At the end when you still didn't like it, you go and ask for a refund. The manager is going to laugh at you.
---
quick tip: if you see something weird in a two month old video its probably because that feature has been changed already
---
The game loaded with only 3 pepole in the lobby, next thing i know i'm spawning with a spirit right next to me
---
I only play solo and the only problem currently is crybabies DCing
---
Yeah. That's why I'm surprised when killers don't slug someone after they get farmed off hook and go after the farmer that's what I would do but it's more common I see they just down the farmer and let them go or they take the survivor that got unhooked and put them back on hook.
---
Felt toxic might loop later idk
---
Click on your Steam profile and look at the URL
---
thank you!!!
---
One of these actually has an effect in game and one does not. Really wish WGLF had something else with it
---
Fuck it, I'm game. 
---
A Vanilla mode sounds interesting when everyone is forced to participate.  Freddy should end up S-tier in this kind of scenario.
---
nothing is final, but its getting reworked, currently the prototype is that you need 3 PROTECTION hits for it to activate, not normal hits
---
Yep, but I'm also not enjoying this entertainment product that I come to for entertainment.
---
At this point? You don't think I tried my hardest? Also I want delte it. It is personal now.
---
im not talking about myself. stop making stupid assumptions
---
Sure as hell didn't hear the killer radius.
---
Incorrect assumption. Even 90s circuses ran with old school styled circuses, largely because of tradition but also because it met consumers expectations. Most circuses still have old school things as that is what people assume circuses have and look like. 
---
And the circus the clown was running with was PROBABLY cheapo considering he had an easy time kidnapping victims.
---
I would use all your offerings first and try build them up towards max  and then do it.
---
Wait wtf?! Ace is quieter than others when in injured state?? How is that fair??
---
so do i. but as i mentioned in the post there are some people who have issues with that
---
If the Billy is good enough and you're not next to a pallet, then you're pretty much screwed
---
Unless you want to feel like you're starting the game over completely, I'd wait until you have some BP. You lose all of your perks, inventory/add-ons, and offerings.
---
aaaand no consoles again.
---
You dont have to throw yourself, but alot of perks are very situational and require a certain playstyle, so why not make this one the same?
---
L...No PS4. Discrimination!
---
Well, first of all, being gay doesnt mean that you act any differently than a straight person. It's only about who one is attracted to. I'm not sure how that would interfere with your day to day life at all? Also, for those who do have behaviors different than how you expect they should be, isnt it up to you how much that bothers you? Like, that's a you problem. You cant live life expecting others to conform to what you are comfortable with. From the outside looking in, especially with the sjw tumblr culture, it may be easy to think that "people are just acting different for attention." But this is largely not the case. This is just who and how some people are and to see people in person or on the web saying that they have a problem with them simply for who they ARE..... well, it's what reinforces those negative self thoughts and pushes people towards negativity and poor mental health. Just food for thought

---
for anyone that has trouble finding their steamid 64
---
I too know that look. I dated a gay heavyset guy and he could honestly have been the clown face wise. He was very cock hungry, but also a nice individual with fun tendencies.
---
Im defending people's right to do what they have the freedom to do. The devs put in consequences for dcing to discourage using it all the time, this still does not make it against the rules. Just because dcing annoys a bunch of people does not make it so awful an offence that anyone who dc's is a terrible person. It is not accurate or fair to judge a person's character based on disconnecting in an online video game, especially one so polarizing and occasionally frustrating as Dead by Daylight.
---
i usually just roll around in their salt. i enjoy it alot. its just offputting for people who take stuff like that to heart.
---
Yeah. He is a piece of shit but I've learned from watching him tbh..
---
There might be a boogeyman or men in the house!!
---
im toxic and salty myself. i am talking in third person about the girl who said she cant take it.
---
&gt; How am I supposed to even attempt at opening a gate if killer is just moving back and forth between gates until one of them has been touched by me and is now camping at said gate.
---
What does this have to do with the timer? If you're unable to do it, you're unable to do it.
---
I used the perk for about a year and it can really confuse killers mid-chase if you're good enough. I personally like the perk but dont use it anymore because I like to play agro now
---
3 or 4
---
You‚Äôre assuming it‚Äôs a choice for everyone
---
Exactly like that, I think noed should have some changes too. At the very least a totem counter, I would like NOED to only cause survivors on death hook exposed. Since it is no one escapes death not no one escapes a single hook
---
true. yet again there are people out there that take stuff like that to heart. i got no problem with closing the chat
---
If it‚Äôs a teachable then yea. And every perk is a teachable I believe.
---
The camera shake lmao
---
i couldnt care less.  Im just sorry for the girl that had anxiety issues a few days back on this reddit. that heartless fucks like you say exactly that.
---
Yea, at this point in Internet Gaming's lifespan, the "GG" has well outlived it's purpose.
---
More often than not it's used in an insulting manner. It's become so trivial and mundane it doesn't actually mean anything anymore. It's the equivalent of talking about the weather when you're on an elevator or waiting in line with someone. 
---
It's a lazy response that makes people feel good about themselves despite having done nothing of value. 9 times out of 10 I'd rather have complete silence after any game, not just DbD, than pointless "GG" spam. 
---
I don't buy into it being a virtual handshake. At least in real life sports you have to be face-to-face with your opposition and be held accountable for any asshole behavior exhibited during the game. In online games? Nope, you can just be a dickbag all game long, spit out a quick "GG", exit quickly and keep pretending you're a fine person to be around.
---
IMO the best combo is Sketchbook+Cold Dirt
---
Loses arguement
---
Yep and I'll gladly send a gif of GhostBoi teabagging when he releases to those DCers and I feel people need to report it more rather then letting it slide.
---
yet again for the billionth time. i am taking stand here for a girl that posted about her insecuritys  a few days ago.  you and your oppinion can fuck right off m8
---
I feel like if you have anxiety issues this is the absolute last game that you would ever want to play
---
That's pretty childish. Just see it as a challenge.
---
I don't have great answers to this, as Billy is my worst enemy as well, but I try to stay in areas where I can vault quickly. Avoid wide open areas. Map awareness is your friend. If you're working on a gen, look around you for safe spots that you can run to if he's coming your way.
---
I don't think a suicide option should be available right off the bat, but if the endgame has kicked in you should be able to 'give up'
---
No.. Just no.
---
well beeing a whiteknight is the reason why im married and your 16yo ass  is still jacking off to some weird anime porn. Women wanna be treated the right way, im sorry your dad was gone all the time "buying cigarettes" instead of teaching you how to behave and most importantly how to treat a women.
---
This man gets what I‚Äôm saying.
---
Exactly! Also, like i get it everyone complains...but you can't say that a lot of the posts that complain are about survivors and get upvoted while the complete opposite gets downvoted.
---
I see it as RNG screwing me over.
---
Fair enough. Got nothing to say to that.
---
screenshotting this and posting it to whiteknight
---
You sound like a 15 year old kid trying to trigger people.
---
*takes notes*
---
His mori animation is so awesome I'd probably just let him impale me tbh.
---
oink...
---
"I have over 1000 hours" well it looks like you got your money's worth, good riddance. You're part of the toxicity problem in the community. Looping happens, camping happens too even though it's frustrating is part of the game.
---
I‚Äôm fine with wglf it‚Äôs situational as in if you want a bloodpoint match, even with a bad death I still get 20-25k 
---
Not everyone is going to be happy with every perk
---
have fun, tell your friends over there to man up
---
r/deltarune
---
No but the exposed status effect is.
---
Oink
---
*laughs in Scratched Mirror*
---
Ruin was during actually. BBQ and chili was after. Plus, I don‚Äôt keep up with the meta of this game. I just play occasionally until it‚Äôs optimized then I‚Äôll hop back on full time.
---
That is pretty thin
---
Ok, thanks for the tips and replies I‚Äôll give it a shot sometime
---
Only if it‚Äôs a really thick one.
---
I think it's a solution that nerfs it into the ground for solo players, and keeps it the same for most swf
---
Wrong Freddy, it's not Jackie
---
Bloodlust helps with looping. Did you play BEFORE bloodlust arrived on the scene? It was awful for killers.
---
i'll tell them you sent me, but they probably know you already
---
i can smell your neckbeard through the screen
---
Jevil would be the only Killer who would actually benefit from getting looped.
---
\*confused wraith\*
---
Beautiful
---
Katya killer and trixie survivor?
---
come back when you grew some kind of beard :D
---
If you ask those guys I played against this morning, fuck yes you can.
---
I'm not home to check right now, but doesn't the Clown's story mention that he was taken while on horseback? like he sensed something was wrong, whipped his horse to get it to go faster, then the Entity caught them anyway.
---
Lorrie is also loud as fuck.
---
There really should be an option for Killers to opt in/out of SWF Lobbies. They just aren‚Äôt fun and have been proven over and over to be ‚Äúunfair‚Äù, considering you basically get 4-5+ perk effects basically for free, since you will most likely have communication/location/status updates on your friends. 
---
I know this game is more fun with friends, but from a Gameplay standpoint it just doesn‚Äôt work out. Survivors need that fear of not knowing who/where/what Survivors are doing.
---
Sure, I'd love an explanation on how homosexuals are getting 'introduced' into your daily life, (other than having the nerve to exist) and why being different isn't a good thing. 
---
 You don't need to go into more detail about how you're scared that the gays are coming to take your jobs. That's just factually incorrect.
---
Oh god oh fuck I haven‚Äôt played it yet
---
I would prefer to eat at home
---
Who wants to die for art
---
every word you say is absolutely true.
---
Deja Vu would've came in clutch
---
As survivor if you escape you are called a swf even if you aren't, if you 360 you are "abusing fov glitches", if you use any good perks you're a meta slave, etc.
---
If you die you're told you are shit at the game and to get better.
---
It's not a one sided issue.
---
That looks amazing! One of the greatest Legion artworks ive seen so far
---
While I mostly agree, there are definitely builds that are selfish to play too. If you're bringing iridescent head + infantry belt to a match you clearly don't give a shit about whether the survivors have fun.
---
thats exactly what i do. feels gud
---
I‚Äôve never heard them terms at all, so I think it‚Äôs more uncommon
---
Would you rather they nerf second chance perks all together..because NOED is essentially that.
---
You don't have to throw yourself? You have to literally be up another survivor's ass and take hits. You would have to do this 3 times. Situational perks are fine, sure. This perk wouldn't make it situational. It would leave your team and yourself in a worse position than if you had just stayed on gens and avoided getting git.
---
u/vreddit_player_bot
---
Rainbow X dbd
---
Yes I would actually. NOED just needs to be reworked nerfing won't do anything.
---
Keep telling yourself that bud I'm rooting for ya.
---
When I saw her trailer I thought this was the new killer. Tbf this does look like something out of DBD.
---
What about fake sex?
---
PWYF is not useless...
---
I an sorry to announce it but I got the daily by locker hiding
---
I try to live by the if it's happening in front of me I'm gonna stop it. Like a survivor runs back to hook or a survivor is running around hook and another pulls them off hook or is going to I'll go over to stop it because it's not really bming in my eyes it's more of me stoping that I mean lead me away from hook if you wanna do that I've done that as a survivor. So I usually expect them to kill me because that's what I would do. The stuff like dropping on hatch and being picked back up I expect because some really toxic stuff because it be like that sometimes.
---
So a few weeks ago I took a Monday off and played killer all day on PC. All day the chat ranged from ‚Äúgg that was awesome!‚Äù To, at the worst, the survivors not saying anything. Sometime in the afternoon I was eventually called the N-word. I looked at the clock and oh, it was 3:45, school‚Äôs out. Most immature people in post game chat are most definitely children. If they are not, then I feel especially sorry for them.
---
Any pvp game has chat toxicity.
---
I'm not an MoM user. I ran it to get Adept Ash, but that's it. As a killer, MoM hasn't ruined any of my games, but I sympathise with those who run in to groups all or mostly running MoM. However, this is a small percentage of all games.
---
I think anyone can say that it sucks if something they like about the game gets changed, but when you say things like "now the [other side] can feel what we feel (as seen in this thread's comments), you're just being a jerk. Why would you want other people to feel bad? That's something that a school bully does.
---
The community for this game should be trying to work together to improve the game. Not saying things like "git gud" or "crutch perk" or whatever. And if you say you do it because someone did it to you, that's no excuse.
---
We're not all going to agree on everything, and that's fine. But don't add to the toxicity here. The community doesn't need any more of that.
---
I do, I can counter it in 3 button presses.
---
Thank the heavens, majority of the people downvoting don't see the similarities in the strength of perks for both sides.
---
Pleas stop nerfin shit and start buffing... this game is near tu be a just M1 killers and perkless survivor shit
---
Well MoM would be useful still just for more altruistic type of players instead of people that are generally more bad at the game.
---
It won‚Äôt be useless you sack of used diapers. 
---
In its current state, there is no counterplay unless you play a specific killer. I don‚Äôt know wether or not it‚Äôs worse than old DS, because at least DS has dribbling and enduring to ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùcounter‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù it. It deserved it nerf, but it‚Äôs not gonna be useless. It promotes altruism and rewards you. 
---
Side note, new DS isn‚Äôt useless. It has a different purpose. Use it to counter tunneling, you know the thing every survivor complains about. They gave you a perk to deal with it, so use it to deal with tunneling.
---
thats true. im so glad there are some grown ups on this reddit. Good to have you here.
---
Thanks
---
Lightweight is definitely not useless.
---
She looks gorgeous!
---
CROWABUNGA
---
I never knew I needed that so much in my life
---
Thank god
---
Yep. I believe corrupt intervention makes Ruin useless because it doesn't get destroyed and it's likely to actually last longer. Also agree on that idea as it would add variety like are they gonna dead hard or lithe. It'd be very interesting
---
Maybe it‚Äôs not a bug and something new they are rolling out lol! Joking of course, but we all said we wanted a kindred perk built in to see if the killer was camping but not for people just running around the map, anyways enjoy it while it last you know they will have that patched before the gen bug with no blood points gets a patch.
---
Since audio and video are separate I hate reddit video.
---
Thank you, you're very thoughtful.
---
Like fake sex!
---
Doesn‚Äôt everyone?
---
im playing both sides. and ive never heard these terms either.
---
everything is possible if u are not playing on pc
---
I have like a secret ability. Most killers can get me but usually billies cant. I just stay by stuff to get behind. If I'm at a gen I try to get on it in a way that there isnt a straight line that he can travel to me
---
While that may be true, the current strategy is making sure the obsession does as fast as possible. You can still play normally and use this version of Dying Light.
---
it's the most underrated survivor perk in the game. if you're good you won't get caught once the exit gates are powered.
---
excuse me, but why PWYF and Lightweight are there?
---
The best was someone asked him how to counter Nurse. 
---
‚ÄúJust hide, 4head‚Äù
---
Tbf you could run all meta perks if you still do basic mistakes like respecting pallets you wont go far. Chances are whatever killer they would have played you would still have lost
---
Okay so I guess legion should go back to the way he was? You survivors get all the bullshit OP perks but killers get 1 thing with no counterplay and you cry into the abyss. You are full of shit, get over yourself. 
---
MoM deserves the nerf. That one extra hit does mean something, because it extends the chase and means more time for the other survivors to work on gens. 
---
MoM deserves a nerf, maybe not this one, but it needs a nerf. After this it will promote altruism and rewards you as such. 
---
So why does MoM deserve to stay as is? It‚Äôs OP, so why do you get to keep it? 
---
Point is, survivors do not and should not rely on perks to survive. Looping is what keeps you alive. MoM deserves a nerf and it is troubling that people are having this discussion. Next thing you know people are complaining that Freddy is OP after his rework.
---
worst of all ur forced to have hex ruin on or else u gonna have a bad time...
---
Cool, but eew legion
---
1 extra hit if 1 survivor uses the perk, don't forget that 4 survivors can run it, and that means 4 extra hits. And you are like a free speed boost without exhaustion means nothing, because that's what MoM does. Also, if you can't activate MoM against Trapper or Cannibal, that's on you, because their powers are trash and they most of the time just M1 survivors. Good survivors will force even Billy to M1 them, and yet activate the perk even against him.
---
People who don't play any killer, yeah.
---
Except a majority of people are still straight or bi...
---
It's just a PTB, what would you expect?
---
Seriously. It's a really unfun perk to go against and I feel bad for survivors, but there's nothing else to run. I don't know how we are like 2 years into this game and killers are limited to choosing 3 perks while survivors don't have a perk that is mandatory
---
I remember seeing very similar threads in communities such as Overwatch and LoL. Its sad how common it has become
---
I know the perk being reverted after everybody already bought the DLC is bullshit, but it's laughable to think that changing the perk is gonna hurt sales. It's playing as Ash that is gonna get people to buy it, not the perk. Especially in terms of bringing in causal gamers/horror fans. The sales will be fine, but what they've done or plan to do is ridiculous.
---
See, I knew you were a killer main. And an asshole too, nice. ‚ÄúBullshit OP perks‚Äù, lol my ass.
---
Piss off
---
Complaining about blood lust in 2019, LOL.
---
I signed up as killer, was a hard choice though. I've always dreamed of playing the game in a pure vanilla state and balancing the game around it, so I'm excited if I get selected. Only time I ever really got to experience that was back in beta.
---
I‚Äôve been called a damn looper a few times after the killer DC, And I ask what happened, I was just trying to not get hit with a hammer, I can‚Äôt help it he kept stoping to break pallets here and there...
---
I get really nervous when starting new games that I know will be really good, I‚Äôve been procrastinating on Delta for a long time. I‚Äôll get around to it eventually‚Ä¶ my friends will probably make me start it LOL xd
---
Is this the projared nudes I keep hearing about?
---
You‚Äôre forgetting that it takes three hits to activate. The likelihood of that happening in a high rank game, and getting no power downs, it‚Äôs just insane. And killer mains like you need to suck it up and stop crying.
---
[cries in PS4]
---
No mither
---
Just saying it sucks people can't do it if they only play console I'm personally not mad its just kinda disappointing?
---
It says he was born in 1932 and that at 1954 he killed the first person so he was 22 then and stayed with the circus for a decade so hes 32 and that would be 1954 and he clearly isn't in his 30's in the game so he probably bought the porn at around 40-50
---
So straight people cant live with them is okay? Double standards.
---
And this is why the game isn't fun for anybody.
---
Interesting. You have nothing to lose man ! Actually you should be playing it if it matters to you. Since being around the internet is always a chance to be spoiled
---
You are mistaken, this is a pretty good job so far.
---
I play both sides equally. 
---
I am an asshole, I accept that. I am an asshole because I want to show people like you why this decision was made and why it‚Äôs not bad. 
---
It is bullshit and OP. 4 survivors can run MoM, meaning 4 extra hits. There‚Äôs no caveat to the perk. It makes M1 killers even worse.
---
Killer is solo game. Play for yourself. Gg wp at the end, bye. 
---
Pretty simple.
---
Ah testing out a NEW HARDCORE GAME MODE BhVR????? Just you, the killer and your real gameplay skills? Sounds fun and interesting
---
Before I say this, let me clarify that I am not against the LGBT community or anything like that. 
---
There is a "Diversity Budget" in a couple of places in the UK(? Iirc it was the UK), meant literally just to hire people for work just because they are black or gay or some kind of minority group. I'll try to find out a bit more and link some in a bit if I don't just fall asleep and forget.
---
Also, off topic of this post. But, if the rewarded survivors like they do killers for dc that would be helpful or somehow helping survivors when killers face camp.(If they did it similar to bloodlust, except just speed up gen fixing speed or something)
---
No...
---
Delfy isn‚Äôt nearly as bad, he actually acknowledged the hate and stopped making videos exploit videos until the bugs were patched. He‚Äôs also not a rampant cunt all the time.
---
Yah the only other way I‚Äôve been able to get points for Survival is wiggling out of the killers grasp and then the gates plus hatch escape... they need to pay out more for totems and add some extra BP for doing things in game
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
How?!? There is no counterplay! You can‚Äôt be bad or good against the perk! 
---
No, both sides and the devs are at fault. That same sentence can go for survivors. Survivors want to punish camping and tunneling, want to nerf NOED, and want to delete legion. Legion isn‚Äôt even fucking good, he just has no counterplay. There‚Äôs a reason nurse and billy are still the best killers in the game, and whenever something slightly strong comes out you want to delete it from existence. 
---
You are a hypocritical moron. The statements you made go for survivors as well. And guess what? This game is supposed to be asymmetrical, meaning the killer is stronger than the survivor. It is how the game is fucking designed, survivors are not supposed to be as strong or stronger than killers, they are meant to be weaker, that‚Äôs why there are 4 of them.
---
‚ÄúFrank go back to your corner ‚Äú
---
Just false. Like this isnt a real world thing. Maybe 1% of the killers who dont understand how the game works may say it, but everyone else doesnt because any loss on the killers side is marked up as their fault. If you got looped, thats because you didnt chase properly, if you miss 360's its because you just cant hit 360's(what is this fov abuse claim lmao), meta slave? Lol no.
---
Im tempted to say youre just making shit up because Ive never heard these before. Because a killer losing, is their fault. Period. The excuses made by them are in no way viable, especially when they dont have the group mentality supporting them. But hey, maybe this is what is really said at Rank 20 or something, I wouldnt know.
---
Graphics are really improving in this update!
---
I'm sorry but you got to have thick skin for any online game. If there's a possible form of communication whether it be text chat, voice chat, private matches, etc. you will eventually get bad messages.
---
I still remember playing Runescape and getting my first exposure to this kind of thing a dozen+ years ago.
---
I think the stupidest thing that this community does is that they prop up the negativity so much, claiming it to be "the most toxic game ever" and they highlight every single message and action in game as such a big deal like it's a personal attack on your life.
---
You're just a toxic survivor main
---
i agree although its kinda rare for me to get salty survivors i get kinder surs more than toxic ones
---
Falsely marked.
---
Should be a "shitpost", not marked as "Gameplay".
---
thank you so much!! Halfway through I was about to give up on it I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt!
---
I know :D
---
Added flair :P
---
*happy drunk gurgles*
---
Yeah, the Unreal Engine improvements are really coming along!
---
New killer confirmed for DBD
---
Hey reveniam, what do u mean by this attitude? Straight people cant live with them is okay? If u are taking that as a joke u might as well take the other one as a joke not trying to offend anyone here... stop with the double standards thats ugly like really ugly.
---
That perfect cut in the end oof
---
Thank you :)
---
Botony knowledge is incredible but you don't have to make it obvious they might nerf it for no reason like they did with empathy lol. Like seriously who asked for an empathy nerf?
---
i personally enjoy it because it makes me better at the game it forces me to get better at skillchecks and i like that
---
She doesn't get invited because she vapes.
---
You legit need to play the game normally to get these 3 hits. How hard it can be to let the killer M1 you 3 times ?  It's the easiest thing to do, LOL. And just killer mains cry now ? BBQ and Chilli was nerfed. Pig was nerfed. Legion was gutted LOL. Freddy was f\*cking nerfed after 2 weeks of his release just because survivors mains crying about how OP he was, LUL.
---
Does Sony or Microsoft even have this feature? It's a different, optional build of the game you need a code for.
---
100% accurate. Love this lol
---
"HEY-KID-WANNA-BUY-SUM-DRUGS?"
---
That's not it. They want a Steamid64. Go to Steamrep and it gives all that information.
---
I had the luckiest spawn where two gens were on the little dock in one of the maps and there was one right next to it, and they luckily did every gen except that. The game lasted a whole hour and I eventually got them all after closing the hatch.
---
Btw dont worry about downvotes- got downvoted too for No reason. I guess its because i asked for a Link...
---
When you get a 4K on ps4 and everyone and their mother tells you how bad of a killer you are because you use perks that are in the game that allow you to be a better killer which is the point of the game when u play killer UM HELLO DUH
---
Were they teaming to farm other survivors repeatedly? Yes it is teaming and reportable.
---
Was he just kind of letting the Nea live and she wasn't really doing anything griefy in particular? No, there's nothing wrong with that. If I see someone's new or they're trying their best meanwhile some pos Dwight is hiding waiting for them to die I will make sure he dies and the other person gets hatch.
---
I feel treating facecamping similar to looping would even the playing field and maybe help with toxicity and dcing. But, I can only hope.
---
"WHO KEEPS RUNNING THE LOOP AROUND?"
---
Nurse is broken too, dumbass. I‚Äôm not talking about killers though. The fact that HALF THE KILLERS COUNTER IT WITH THEIR POWER is enough.
---
The fact if you get morid is enough.
---
The fact that if you die on first hook is enough.
---
The fact if they have any instadown is enough.
---
It‚Äôs not OP. Grow the fuck up, and stop changing the topic and trying to say I‚Äôm hypocritical when I‚Äôm not even fucking discussing what is/isn‚Äôt broken on the killer side.
---
Are you dumb dude? He can hit you and get the first hit easily and then chase you down. He is so much more efficient. Don't judge the entire character by one mistake one person did. That's like saying the nurse is bad because they missed a blink and had to wait for fatigue.
---
Love it
---
The entity feels bad for the survivors so he's helping
---
**Platform**: PS4
---
**Type of Bug**: HUD, Visual, Ingame, Menu
---
**Description**: Game loaded into Fence02_In and right after loading into the map, my HUD disappeared.  Couldn't see my perks, couldn't see repair progress bars, couldn't do any skill checks, couldn't see my time-left-on-hook or struggle status.  Literally unplayable.  First time I've seen this bug.  Gonna restart my game and hopefully never ever see it again.
---
But it‚Äôs still the same thing. Instead of making sure the obsession dies as fast as possible, it‚Äôs make sure to hook the obsession 3 times as fast as possible. Nobody will bring this reworked perk, hook the obsession, and then just leave and go chase other people. They‚Äôd risk not even getting more stacks before the gens are done. That wouldn‚Äôt make any sense. 
---
If Dying Light gets reworked, I guarantee they will totally remove the tunneling aspect.
---
Correct, neither I nor the other moderators of this community will allow for homophobia or similar. If you have any issues regarding these rules, please contact us via modmail or see Reddit's usage policy.
---
&gt;Yah the only other way I‚Äôve been able to get points for Survival is wiggling out of the killers grasp and then the gates plus hatch escape... they need to pay out more for totems and add some extra BP for doing things in game
---
Hatch escape still gives you 5k survival plus 2k Objective. 
---
600 or 1k for Totems is fine because it is stupidly easy to cap Boldness if you get chased, even without stuns. 
---
The only category that doesn't have many sources to generate points is survival. Staying alive for X minutes and capping at 3k (+5k for escaping alive = 8k) would be nice.
---
The game should still be balanced before perks come into play. They're just doing community testing to see some statistics to further know where the game's current balance issues come from and how to proceed. It's closed since it's not something they want to program for (and potentially make more bugs to tarnish the statistics), so they keep it closed to have better control over who's chosen in the hope that everyone plays fair.
---
Trapper matches are always a blast and the majority of trapper killers play fair too.

---
The top tier killers counter it, but M1 killers are fucked more than they already are. To nurse or billy, it‚Äôs not OP because they can ignore it, but Wraith, Trapper and Freddy are told to go fuck themselves.
---
I know you mean well by it, but in games where people get demolished, I'm sure the last thing they want to see is someone saying, "Good Game". It comes off as a bit condescending.
---
I only say it when the person who lost says it first. Otherwise, I don't feel like it's my place to say that the game was good unless others felt that way. Especially if I absolutely demolish a team as the killer. I'm not going to be so bold as to say that it was good unless they tell me that they thought it was.
---
This made me remember if a video that was posted some time ago on this sub that was basically a dude recording Clown's face after reading the VHS Porn addon description and The Clown smiled, great video.
---
Shouldn't it be "face camp" or "face camp"
---
To my knowledge the hillbilly doesn't get camped!
---
Actually, ten minutes is a really long time for that. I thought you meant only the 3 minutes it takes to get killed for the endgame. I‚Äôd possibly report that if you could.
---
Alrighty, thank you!
---
People are gonna be trying to find anything about the upcoming DLC and having a misleading flair could kinda piss people off.
---
We do not tolerate homophobia/transphobia on this subreddit. Keep it civil.
---
i would love to do this
---
You unlocked ultra instinct
---
This is perfect! I hope they get around to doing something like this
---
If they do, that's enough time to hook and 2 or 3 people/kill 1 guy
---
Several times already
---
That‚Äôs Tapp
---
u/siberlily yes this one
---
Amazing post, OP
---
I did, and no it was not. The only buff it got was with the change to Hex, which is an okay buff. Changing tier 1 and 2 has no impact on balance and isn't how they balance the game.
---
I just love that description, it is so good!
---
play spirit
---
Hahaha sorry, I'm guessing we'll get some real official footage soon, but until then, I gotta shitpost.
---
So its supposed to be like scream, I know what you did last summer, and friday the thirteenth lol
---
no spirit, no sale

&gt; Again console ignored
---
I don't think you understand how much money PTB would cost for console...
---
That was my intention. But this is what you would call a low effort meme, and it‚Äôs not worth fixing lol
---
If they get mad at this then frick them.
---
not the best, indeed but not useless
---
Indeed. :P
---
This was almost exactly what happened when I played Freddy recently, but Survivors were also being toxic too. Saying "gg" at the post game chat and still being called out was just horrible.
---
at least it lasts longer than ruin also, so is noed, but in reverse and can be nullified, yet everyone's complaining about it.
---
I mostly play killer, I started December 2017, so I played with pallet vacuums and old exhaustion for quite a while, the game is in a lot better state than it used to be.
---
Wym? The lore is pretty deep though definitelly confusing
---
Freddy can already fuck himself. Freddy is bad. Wraith is probably weakest against it, that is true. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs particularly strong, but he has zero counterplay. Oh wait, he does. Haunted grounds, NOED, Devour Hope, etc. And as for trapper, a good trapper should get some trapped survivors, giving a free hook and completely bypassing any hits. All this is telling me is that if you can‚Äôt play trapper effectively, Mettle of man punishes you. Which is fine. Get good. Stop whining. Even if that extra hit successfully lets you escape, you are still revealed until downed again...
---
*Vacuum noises get louder*
---
When I play survivor I always go out of my way to compliment the killer on something, as long as they played reasonably fairly.
---
You should use cooldown, duration and Killer Instinct range add-ons. Cooldown add-ons work the best with EndFury combo, while durations add-ons are for a stall build with Thanatophobia and Sloppy Butcher. Killer Instinct are just for more tracking and information, but if survivors are too far way, you should never go for them.
---
Intervention is better than Ruin on a few killers tho
---
When you dead hard ***into*** the Killer.
---
Been there, done that.
---
There's two great parts to your comment.
---
The first part is that emblems are specifically set up so that you can't get them if the Killer doesn't do anything. It's not so much the chaser emblem (just run in front of the "AFK" Killer) but the altruism offering that you will not get if the Killer doesn't do their part. You can't heal others or unhook people if the Killer doesn't attack anyone.
---
The second and far more amusing part is that speaking from experience if you let the Survivors escape for free you'll *still* be flamed and harassed for no reason other than existing.
---
Isn't Susie a teenager?
---
I disagree whos gonna spend $5 on 1 survivor with subpar perks?  I mean everyone who buys bubba bought him for bbq and franklins.Because hes not that fun to play as.
---
Probably the nicest and least toxic thread in this post we'll see lul
---
If it gets taken down there's a subreddit for this my friend and just post it there r/dbdgonewild
---
No idea, hopefully is worthy. Too bad we don't know it before. Maybe because is not that good and therefore not enough people would participate? idk, will do it anyway if i'm selected.
---
I want this available for consoles.
---
The revealing part doesn‚Äôt mean shit when you have perks like Distortion. 
---
MoM makes already bad killers even worse, that‚Äôs the whole fucking point. 
---
I‚Äôm done arguing with you. We‚Äôre both being stubborn assholes so there‚Äôs no point. You‚Äôre gonna scream ‚Äúgit gud baby killer‚Äù and I‚Äôm going to insult you. No point in continuing this.
---
You need to have thick skin to play literally any multiplayer game. MOBA? You'll get flamed. DBD? Flamed. Shooting game? Flamed.
---
It's the nature of people. They hate losing and will blame others to defend their own ego. If someone can't handle that, then multiplayer gaming just isn't for them
---
I mean honestly you're not wrong but you're also not right. Put bluntly Killers have to deal with it from 4 Survivors, and over time you just come to accept the norm. But against a Killer there's a pinpoint for you to focus your hatred against, even if the player is just doing their job.
---
I've also never heard anyone say that 360ing is "abusing fov glitches." 360s have nothing to do with FOV and are more related to this game's hitboxes and lunge tracking. If they *were* related to FOV Shadowborn would be used way more.
---
Getting it on console would be hard apparently so that's why...
---
All of them honestly, they scream so god damn loud
---
Trapper is the worst killer in the game. If you step in his traps, it's entirely your fault. Good survivors never step in his traps, they alaways activate MoM against Trapper.
---
Purposely walked past several hooks when carrying me around and easily had many oppertunited to have a kill i stopped wiggling and they decided to drop me and pick me up over and over
---
Well I figured it could work like BBQ, so it could double the total bp, and would only increase it after the game, so with bbq you would have like 3x the bp from that game.
---
No mate, this is not that crazy. This one serial killer, Ed Kemper, once killed his own mother, cut off her head and had sex with it. Now that was crazy.
---
For some context: I've been playing as The Cannibal with Thrill of the Hunt, BBQ and Chili, Distressing, and Deer stalker. I don't think those perks are "try hard" perks, but somehow people still get upset.
---
Is there an official link to this information?
---
Take my upvote.
---
f ohcido
---
If someone has anxiety, why are you playing DBD? Ignoring assholes, there's loud noises, visual scares, crescendo music etc, etc - if you have an anxiety issue, this is the last game you would want to play. And that's okay.
---
&gt;Also it's odd that you say people from your generation aren't affected and you're only 16, even though it's the younger generation that seems to be more and more aware and understanding of changing societal trends.
---
I know this: my generation isn't as snowflakey as the lads above us. Mental awareness is increasing, and part of this is also more knowledge in how to deal with it. Coping strategies exist if you are not using medicine.
---
I say most people who play DBD don't have anxiety issues becauase... most people don't have anxiety issues fullstop. Simple extrapolation.
---
(The Entity disliked that) idk how to feel about the image knowing that Susie is under 18
---
üòÇ
---
Should mention in this theoretical idea, if it was a Cypress or Ivory, the killer WOULD lose it, but the Survivor is still downed, so you could hook 'em
---
BBQ was nerfed with lockers changes which hide aura now. Pig nerf was too harsh and she didn't rceive any other buffs to compensate.
---
Now that the timer on the Collapse is 2 minutes, I understand the RBT change slightly more. I don‚Äôt really like it, but I understand why they did it.
---
Oof, an account with negative karma. das a spicey meatbol
---
That was too easy
---
Yeah getting morid is kinda random also I had two survivor perk ideas where when you are hit your blood sprays on the killers face giving the killer a small blind and one where if the killer doesnt break a pallet you can lift it back up with a 60 second cooldown or something
---
BBQ nerf is not bad at all, but I agree the pig nerfs were pretty bad
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: In game
---
Description: If you fail a sabotage skill check (only tried on hooks), you can no longer sabo that hook.
---
Literally the day after my vacation ends, damn, man.
---
Tunneling is when a killer purposely goes after a survivor that has been hung several times. Most survivors are upset at the fact they didn't win. I should know, I'm a survivor main myself.
---
There's obviously a good distinction between someone just being annoying and saying you're bad or telling you to KYS, uninstall, etc.
---
I'm for free speech but if there are people we don't want to play with because they are behaving in unacceptable behavior. It's not hard to know where to start at all. What you listed is a good place to start. Imagine participating in a sports league of any kind IRL and a member was DMing people this stuff?
---
I define "a little bm" as teabagging and maybe clicking a flashlight a bit. I don't define "a little bm" as telling me that my parents don't love me because I dared to play a video game.
---
And even if you should expect "BM" it doesn't make it a good thing. Yes if I go outside there's a chance someone might mug me and I should therefor be careful of muggers, *but that doesn't make mugging a good thing.* There are dicks online just like there are dicks in real life, but just like how you're taught to deal with dicks you're also taught not to be a dick, because being a dick is a bad thing.
---
I accept that no matter what's done there will always be people who get mad and yell at eachother over stupid shit. It's human nature. What I can't stand is when it's the expectation and not the average. There are so many communities that I've been in which I've ever left or seen die because "you shouldn't play games if you can't handle a little BM." So many games I left entirely because of toxic cunts ruining the experience for everyone else.
---
I'm okay with someone teabagging me every now and then. I'm not okay with being told to kill myself because I clicked on a bunch of pixels.
---
I was so excited to see if we'd get Sidney Prescott.
---
Then I opened the video.
---
This was even better! Thank you for this.
---
well, one of them
---
The old ones lol starts putting down trap 5 gens later alright got that window blocked oh exit gates are opening
---
Same with Nurse, she doesn't need a nerf, just grow the fuck up. 
---
And Moris are as rare as instant heals, so if you keep going bring Moris in discussion, I keep going bring back instant heals.
---
Sometimes watching people get mad over nothing can be really funny I'll admit.
---
This may surprise you, but like most problems relating to mental or emotional health, how anxiety affects someone is very unique and individual to each person who suffers from it. 
---
I experience some mild to moderate anxiety in certain situations. Nothing about DbD besides a self-imposed pressure to do well makes me anxious. I tend to expect a lot out of myself for many things in life, and sometimes that causes my anxiety when it comes to multiplayer.  That happens to me with DbD sometimes, so I tend to avoid playing too much in one sitting and try to remember that I should just try to have fun and not worry about how well I do.
---
However, nothing about the horror elements of DbD cause my anxiety. I also enjoy some other games with strong horror elements, and they do not trigger my symptoms either because I don't feel that pressure to do well. Anxiety is not the same for everyone, and it is not necessarily related to "scare" factors so to speak. Some people have social anxiety. Others don't like being in cramped or small spaces. Some don't like being in the dark.
---
real shit lol i used to get 4ks with old hag so i'm perfectly okay with current speeds lmao
---
"Counter" isn't the right word. Admitting defeat would be a better way of putting it. You can do what you wish though but beware when they start banning those for disconnecting.
---
When it‚Äôs [REDACTED] hours
---
I‚Äôm amazed your downvotes aren‚Äôt double digits
---
Heh, one time I was playing killer before the EC, and I found an Ash close to the Hatch. He blinds me with a Party Starter and escapes.
---
Before the match, a random David had brought that in, and the Ash managed to find it, and just barely blinded me.
---
I congratulated him and we had a good talk
---
I was just trying to even up the argument, as the original comment paints a more one sided picture of toxicity. Both sides have people who trash talk in the chat.
---
The examples of comments I've listed are taken from my own experiences playing survivor, the people I've encountered can be different from yours.
---
Or scratch mirror myers. Or hag.
---
Lots of jumpscares to be had.
---
Also ghostface is coming and is supposed to be jumpscary.
---
Check, i posted it there before here
---
I love getting the little MS boost at the end. Not that it changes anything but I'm just happy running around.
---
The Creeper from the Jeepers Creepers movies would be a cool flying killer with scary jump scares
---
Someone else understands the power of that map, especially for the Hag.
---
Gotta become an ace main bub, it's the only way
---
I never said I didn‚Äôt deserve to go down or die.
---
It‚Äôs just that in the moment of being a slug, I realized I was about to be mori‚Äôd for a daily. Based on everything that happened in game, I inferred he had a yellow mori.
---
What do we say to ~~the god of death~~ being used as someone‚Äôs mori daily? Not today.
---
r/unexepectincestousserialkillers
---
They're being introduced by having the gall of existing and not hiding their existence. How dare they!
---
Fair. Tell your friend good job though
---
Game mechanic vs a perk...
---
I'd rather "admit defeat" than have an awful experience against broken add ons.
---
For example if someone is running a 3 gen hostage doc then I'm not going to sit in a 45+ minute game, I'm out of there.
---
So ignoring survivors only way to escape chases is the same as an extra hit lol ok
---
Mori‚Äôs have three levels of rarity and can be used on multiple survivors. A insta heal is consumed after one use.
---
There‚Äôs no point in arguing with you anymore. You‚Äôll just keep whining that a low A tier/mid B tier perk is OP, and crying like a baby. See ya, I‚Äôm gonna laugh when they put in the PTB and it doesn‚Äôt change. Again, grow the fuck up.
---
It's a grind and therefore more rewarding, if you spent bloodpoints on things that would only guarantee you got a profit everyone would have unlimited funds and therefore have everything they ever wanted or needed. There has to be a trade off for what you earn and spend or else the game wouldn't be fun and would be too easy.
---
omg go easy on them sassy
---
I mean i'd take a person saying GG EZ and leaving over a douchbag insulting me for 2 minutes.
---
Then again, i'm a console player
---
That feeling when you don't go for an arbitrary rank number and go for farming BPs instead is magnifenct. This completely changed the way I play. I've been  treated like crap as a survivor and i make sure no one ever experiences it when I play as a killer.  With that said, if i play a toxic swf,  it's on.
---
I honestly have no idea how any of those bugs are happening when the killers affected by bugs aren‚Äôt even touched. I know nothing about the coding of the game, but for trapper I‚Äôd think he kinda inadvertently gets messed up because he‚Äôs the oldest killer and there may be some stray code buried deep in that gets messy? No clue, just assuming.
---
Used to play killer alot would say gg at the end and just leave after, the response was usually to comment ony my steam profile.
---
Those aren't bad ideas, but that pallet one could easily be exploited by 4 SWF. Maybe once per match or something?
---
I was gonna suicide on hook but figured I'd stick around to try and get unhooks and chases.  Still felt really bad for the rest of my team though..
---
Exactly. In sports IRL there are moments of BM and sometimes people don't respect each other. But if they start messaging other competitors stuff like people say online, there's serious consequences. Within the league/organization and outside of it.
---
It does change a thing. It makes you more likely to be exposed at the end of the game. And you're forgetting that the endgame collapse buffed the perk too by making it almost mandatory.
---
i disaggree with your advice except for the ohcido part i frickin hate that guy
---
&gt; If someone has anxiety, why are you playing DBD? Ignoring assholes, there's loud noises, visual scares, crescendo music etc, etc - if you have an anxiety issue, this is the last game you would want to play. And that's okay.
---
Amazing how someone else said almost this exact same thing, which I also replied to. You're aware that not everyone experiences anxiety the same way, right? With any mental or emotional health issue, the experience can vary wildly from person to person. Not everyone is going to feel anxious about the loud noises or the scary music or visuals. Some people get anxious about social interaction, other people may feel anxious about being in tight spaces or crowded areas, etc. 
---
&gt; I know this: my generation isn't as snowflakey as the lads above us.
---
Mmmkay, sure. 
---
&gt; If DBD is your trigger then, well shit. Don't expose yourself to your triggers.
---
Well in the case of the girl OP is talking about, apparently she did remove herself from the trigger. But OP also mentioned that if the way people act is a trigger, then we as a community should strive not to be so hostile as to exacerbate anxiety in people who suffer from it.
---
Yeah. I try to not do that anymore. I used to get really mad when arguing over nothing. Because they'd just throw insults and stuff at me. But I got over it and learned a healthy way to deal with the salt people throw at me.
---
Free speech rights protect you from legal consequences for your opinions. 
---
It does not protect you from people telling you you're an asshole. That has never been part of the definition, legally or colloquially.
---
Which ones?
---
(everyone liked that)
---
I think it's amazing that people can read their character bios and actually say to themselves, "yeah gimme some more of that".
---
Only if I can play Billy.
---
Alot of them. Ive seen Jen, Noob3, Ochido, AngryPug, all of them have dced when things don't go their way as survivor. There's probably more tbh. They might not mean to, but they encourage dcs.
---
No, why would it? If the end-game starts then there's a set timer until the game ends, regardless. If you're really that annoyed by it then just tab out and wait the 3 minutes. 
---
Was it reportable for survivors to tea-bag the gate and wait as long as possible to leave? no? then why would it for killers?
---
it helps seperate the map it doesnt really slow the game down at all it just forces survivor to go to the other side of the map
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, survivors are gonna blame you for some type of dumb shit. As long as you aren‚Äôt intentionally trying to play like a douchebag, you‚Äôre fine.
---
In a non-innuendo filled way: yes! In terms of game play, I love playing opposite Myers.
---
&gt; My favorite thing is when they call me camper, even tho I play doctor and can clearly see two people are waiting for unhook.
---
Honestly you don't even need to be running a specific perk or killer, sometimes it's just really obvious when people are playing together and will be immediately waiting around the corner for the unhook. 
---
It's like what do you expect me to do, go to the other side of the map and count to 10?
---
This is the very first template of yours that I do not recognize.  What was the original?
---
Agree 100%
---
Mettle of Man rewards survivors for playing poorly. They get a free hit because they've gotten hit so many times, and it has no counter play because you have no idea when it is going to activate on a survivor. Even if you keep track of how many times you've hit people you don't know until the third hit. So by argument mettle of man is worse because there's nothing you can do about it.
---
Oh okay. I feel like sometimes some survivors forget they're playing against an actually player who can remember and think of strategies. I think out of my 30 levels with Cannibal I've only ever run into one group of survivors who were friendly. Everyone else just waits in the post game chat to bitch at me. Its pretty entertaining.
---
BUY JUULS
---
What does playing like a douchebag look like?
---
It's just Nea.
---
That's a false dilemma, there is no binary choice between "having to grind" and "having unlimited funds". Giving us offerings that offering good odds at an actual profit would barely dent the absolute fucking grind that this game offers, but it would at the very least offer a reason to pick those up other than "they're in my way and maybe I can win back some of the BPs I'm wasting."
---
The offerings are there to give you the *opportunity* to make extra bloodpoints. Of course they're not going to guarantee extra bloodpoints - otherwise they might as well just have it so you can buy BP on the web. I wouldn't want a web of all items and add-ons - it would cost a lot more to get through the webs unless they shrunk them in size quite a bit.
---
As for which ones you should buy in the bloodweb, it depends on what you want to do. If you just want to progress through a bloodweb quickly to get teachables, it might be your best option to grab the brown offerings. If you plan on actually playing the character, then you may want to opt for the more expensive offerings, but there is the added risk of spending more and not getting any points in that area. I tend to stay away from any survival offerings, because it's usually the most difficult to control.
---
The brown BP bonuses are the least worth it. You have to get 6000 BP in that area to break even. If it's a survival offering, almost NEVER worth it.
---
Yellow means you have to get 5333 to break even.
---
Green means you have to get 5000 to break even.
---
Savagery is a worse Unrelenting?
---
this meme is wrong territorial imperative shouldnt be on here its great with lf light weight shouldnt be on here either play with your food is great on infinite tier3 tombstone michael but i agree with other perks being useless
---
You deserve that platinum.
---
Did you read it? This isn't even an update, it's a PTB.
---
Don't remember when was the last time I laughed this hard
---
And it's being reworked, no one said that Mettle of Man was fair.
---
Hag and Trapper namely, Huntress can also benefit from it. Though Hag doesnt need Ruin so it's kind of an "eh".
---
Too much exclamations
---

---
I forget the story, but a Twitch streamer declared he felt better than everyone else and he got a ton of backlash and was memed for it
---
Clown, if played well can shut certain loops down pretty well to the point that he ranks above Looped 'til Daylight tier for me. Obviously not as well as the top tier(that goes without saying) but decently well.
---
I am a shitty-assed killer so I always lean into it pretty hard when people do this. Always kinda takes the wind out of people's sails when they realize I KNOW I'm bad.
---
Inside the game (PC). It's there, on the panel that pops right after you're in in the menu.
---
So you're nice to girls so they will fuck you? Well ok whatever... Hey man stop being such a pussy.
---
Not enough exclamations* 
---
Let me fix that for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
either way you were pretty much screwed
---
Also give point bonuses for solo survivors.
---
On the one hand, you don't owe the match to anyone and DCing if you are not having fun is understandable.  
---
On the other DCing should not be consequence free the way it is right now because it fucks with the games balance.
---
&gt;But OP also mentioned that if the way people act is a trigger, then we as a community should strive not to be so hostile as to exacerbate anxiety in people who suffer from it.
---
Yeah yeah, cool. But my point is that people who make a fuss of toxicity and endlessly complain are part of the issue as those who hurl the insults. They want attention. Just ignore them is my method. I didn't realize people were so sensitive. I guess I am on a gaming reddit, so I should take the demographic into account.
---
If the break-even point is a 5000+ points in that category, then it's not a good gamble by any measure. Especially in a game where only 1 in 3 matches might actually be a full game rather than a disconnect shitfest. There is no equivalence between getting better, cheaper offerings and just "buying blood points". You still have to play with that offering to earn more blood points. And you're picking that node rather than another node so it's not an entirely free BP boost.
---
The current system is on average netting you negative BPs on items whose only purpose is to earn you BPs and I just don't understand why anyone here defends that.
---
Lobbies are already really long.
---
It's not fear, it's frustration that your teammates might be screwing you over. The game stops being scary post 5 hour mark.
---
Honestly, I almost never get harassed. Even when I was up against swf that won, they were still pleasant, and only when I play extra cutthroat with camping and tunneling do I get any kind of crap (granted I throw it right back at them for playing swf. It's shitty to do early camping/tunneling *unless* you're up against a competent swf team, then all bets are fucking off).
---
I don't play like an asshole and don't get harassed.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
I'd take points tbh, I'm a point slut.
---
"GIT GUD SCRUB!"
---
(later, whilst being hooked a third time)
---
"Oh no, scrub got good."

---
Looks interesting. If I'll get picked I'll probably just spam Billy.
---
I hope the experiment will see more variety than just Hag/Nurse which aren't affected by pallets.
---
It is not because there is an eventually end. After four minutes, you will either bleed out or be sacrificed by the Entity.
---
Wow we really got downvoted for that, fucking killer mains are salty man
---
There is no game that comes even close to DbD in terms of people a.) being biased towards their role b.) being completely clueless about the game even after considerable playtime i.e. thinking loops are toxic etc. and most importantly c.) being insanely toxic.
---
Literally none. I like DbD (moreso when I'm survivor 'cause killer is harsh) but the community makes it crazy hard to enjoy it.
---
Since you think that everyone is down-voting because you looped, I thought I would comment why I down-voted..  
---
If a player wants to spend their time tunneling, camping or whatever.. that is fine. They are allowed to play how they want to, as are you. You are allowed to loop, use "infinites".. or even t-bag. It's totally your choice. But moaning that someone else is doing something you don't like, when you do things others don't like, is hypocritical.  
---
Also, once the last gen is popped.. you DO still have time to cleanse N.O.E.D. BEFORE opening gates. In fact, it's often better to, as opening gates now starts EGC.. meaning limited time for saves. And because NOED is active, you don't have to waste your time on dull totems. However, you chose to not do this, and open gates, just for points.  
---
From what you have wrote, you also were not chased ALL match. He split off, and got David. You decided to save David while NOED was up.. that was your mistake. It is common for killers to patrol or camp survivors, when gates are powered. Look for NOED &gt; Save &gt; Escape. Otherwise the likelihood is, you are both getting downed.  
---
Your other choice, was not to save David, and leave. That way you would get your points.   
---
I think the biggest take away from this is.. regardless of what side you are on, there are unfun parts to the game. Each side has perks and offerings that are unfun. And each side has stuff they can do in game, that is unfun. Thinking that each side is not allowed to play how they want, is entitled.  
---
And to be totally honest, if you messaged me saying "Use something else other than NOED," I would probably take that negatively.  
---
You are allowed to be salty. That is fine. Everyone get's salty. But to criticise someone for playing unfun/bad, while both sides are guilty of this, is not. What is fun to you, may not be to others.. and vice versa.  
---
I hope you take this as well as it is intended.
---
Funny how you say that, because I was just going to block you. Also, seeing your reddit history, you whined like a little b.
---
Um rank 19....
---
cute
---
I used to slug the rescued survivor but would then go for the rescuer instead, and would not break off chase for anything. In the current environment this causes people to DC, even though I have no intention of going back to rehook, but no one wants to stick around long enough to finish a game anymore.  
---
I just want to (try and) get everyone hooked evenly, give everyone some good chases, hopefully end a game with a kill or two, just have some fun in general.  It's a game, games are meant to be fun.
---
*That's where you're wrong, kiddo!*
---
Pterodactyl ghost from Scooby doo!
---
All that I can say... is that I must agree, yet am deeply disturbed by that fact.
---
&gt; Yeah yeah, cool. But my point is that people who make a fuss of toxicity and endlessly complain are part of the issue as those who hurl the insults. They want attention.
---
It may be true that they're part of the issue, but that doesn't make the point any less valid. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting the community to be less toxic. 
---
I don't generally take toxicity to heart myself, but that doesn't make it any less annoying when you see it after almost every match. It's not even funny banter, it's just the same old tired insults over and over again. You really mean to tell me you don't think anyone else who doesn't take toxicity to heart doesn't also just get annoyed by it either?
---
&gt; I didn't realize people were so sensitive. I guess I am on a gaming reddit, so I should take the demographic into account.
---
I'm sorry you see things that way, hopefully one day you'll be just a little more compassionate. It's kind of sad how ignorant some people are.
---
As in if somebody says that you suck, I like to respond with "Yeah, you're right". It seems to drain so much of the satisfaction out of them.
---
pretty sure this applys to csgo as well
---
That's Quentin in Dwight's clothing.
---
I agree with this. Idk how many times I‚Äôll see that someone got unhooked and I run over there and only see the person that got unhooked. At that point I‚Äôll chase that guy. But I‚Äôll be told I‚Äôm tunneling when in reality that one guy just stuck around too long. My advice just play normal and when you hook someone don‚Äôt stay around too long. Don‚Äôt worry about survivors being salty.
---
Ps4?
---
Well you could combine them both together maybe?
---
No you
---
Doctors shocks actually prevent survivors from vaulting or dropping pallets for two seconds so
---
pc sorry
---
Hmm sounds good! I don‚Äôt have those characters, spirit jump scary how? Meyers?
---
People who want to play as Ash...? Because *you* don't think he's that fun to play as doesn't mean anything, and you're acting like $5 is the price of a new game, when most people (at least most people I've met) will say it's really not that much money...
---
MoM change feels lazy, but the perk was way too strong. Hate when the devs change the game design to rely on previously janky and unreliable mechanics. Endgame collapse is amazing most of the time, but you get bodied if the doors are right next to each other or directly across the map (depending on who you play as). Protection hits don't trigger half the goddamn time, since there's no clear explanation as to what they even are.
---
You can do it bro you got ps4 if you did I‚Äôll get you out bro
---
I disagree, you're a clean bitch.
---
I mean for now running the killer around is the best you can do for that because if your teammates aren't stupid then they'll be doing gens if the killer isn't chasing them
---
If it's a low A tier/mid B tier perk then why you care if it's getting nerfed ? 
---
I mean, from what I see, there are still better perks than MoM, so you would have no problem to run these perks after MoM being nerfed.
---
Or the poltergeist, where the survivors would have to watch tv in first person mode instead of repairing gens XD (tho nothing really scary happened on that tv other than static)..
---
I honestly don't have that much trouble without ruin so long as I run BBQ&amp;Chili, and I am in purple to even red ranks as Pig most of the time.
---
I used steamrep to find my steamid64 and it was the exact same number that I had in my steam profile URL.
---
ay bra i heard you was looking for some new shoes
---
I find it way too inconsistent to be that viable. It should be an anti-looping tool but it just isn't right now.
---
no kinkshaming
---
If you play decent enough it should be no problem to get 3000 extra bloodpoints in a category. That's doing 6000 in that category not too bad, yes you will have the occasional game that goes the shit and you don't get it but that's where skill comes in to maximize your gains. Not just have the game give you all the bloodpoints you want or break even every single time
---
Cool. It's not the same for everyone. Mine is custom set.
---
K
---
I am more thinking maybe 1 hook phase to preserve the hook perks and then death, but only 2 lives per survivor. I am not quite sure yet myself since it would have to take into account So many different perks.
---
Fookin ded'ard
---
You‚Äôre right, everyone should just run SC/SB/BT/Adrenaline and all killer ah souls run Ruin/NOED/Enduring/BBQ, because that‚Äôs fucking fun and that‚Äôs how the game should be, because fuck trying to make other strong, viable perks.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
Well then yeah, custom ID will be different.
---
And a hat
---
Aw is someone not getting enough validation from strangers on the internet so they have to bring up a fake score? üò≠ü§°
---
It‚Äôs a good community I think ü§î
---
Any online game is going to be super fucking stressful if you have an anxiety disorder. I know that very well. The only online game I excel at is Dark Souls because there's basically no player interaction.
---
The community doesn't even have to be toxic. An anxious person will be able to feel threatened or ridiculed if they even get the sense that other players are disappointed in their performance or think they're bad.
---
One of her add-ons removes her phasing noise. So survivors would have no idea you are coming.
---
Making a perk more useful because survivors are more likely to reach end game is not a buff. It only makes you more likely to be exposed if you're at potato ranks where people use rank 1/2 perks, which is not what balance consists. That change is simply a QoL change to PROGRESSION not balance because previous tier 1/2 was useless.
---
You're taking about an average score of 24000 over all games. That sounds like more than
---
&gt;play decent enough
---
SFTS use to suck, but it isnt nearly as bad after the rework
---
We need Cav and Blitz next.
---
Finally
---
MoM activates mid-chase, you don't need ro heal mid chase to get it to work.
---
In case you didn't know, healing to full health and then gitting your third hit would activate it, meaning that you could use self care to tank two full hits mid chase instead of one. Thats why the perk is so good.
---
If you had made a typo and wrote 42s I would understand. Don't try and lie to me, and maybe ease up on the condesecension. We both know what you did.
---
Yeah but a lot of people don't see it as just a game and see it as super important for some reason. I used to send hate mail to campers and just bad killers using bad tactics that are toxic. However that's either exactly what they want or they don't care and just block you. So I opted to not do that and instead just get better. The dcing is a huge problem but hopefully it will be fixed soon.
---
**Fokin Dedard**
---
boo take your shirt off
---
yeah the data wont be able to help improve the console experience, shame they're ignoring us again.
---
he also has to
---
Slow down to raise his fist, Slow down to walk with his fist raised, Slow down to charge his zap, Slow down to release his zap, Slow down to raise his weapon.
---
if the survivor didn't talk out of his zap's negative range during all this time, they deserve to be smacked.
---
Oh
---
He basically acknowledged this in the title
---
Weird, never seen that before.  I dunno if that guy just had a brain fart and meant to say ‚Äúabove average **PLAYER**‚Äù rather than person, or if he really is just a total douche, but that quote does indeed seem pretty memeable either way.
---
The entity blocker was white in the endgame too, which was cool.
---
PS4, In game.
---
Claudette's wearing any piece of her Belle Of The Ball skin will not trigger Hag traps. She literally walks right over them and nothing happens. I made a post a few days ago with clips of this happening.
---
Why would you get someone all the way to P3 and not use the P3 clothing?
---
Flying killer is a good idea. If you want to scare people the used scratched mirror myers, prayer beads spirit or Tinkerer. Or if you really have to, Insidious Bubba.
---
Do you know of other good Skurring games?
---
If there is about 5-10 metres. You may have time to change direction and have it miss you. For less than that, you are pretty screwed.
---
‚ÄúI hAvE a GaY fRiEnD‚Äù get out of here you walnut
---
Me actually. https://youtu.be/8vAHRKQLoHs
---
Fuck y‚Äôall, the perk was used as a cash grab üôÑ
---
haha...yeah, this was my first thought when i first noticed it happening, but playing these bad matches got old after about an hour.
---
I like you
---
The moment is towards the end
---
Bbq nerf? So I guess it‚Äôs also a head on nerf, and most importantly a Dwight nerf. Dwight is fucking unplayable now. Thx a lot devs!
---
So uh, when we getting a front view ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
You say this sarcastically, but this is what some survivors ACTUALLY believe...
---
I second this so much.Enduring/Spirit Fury is my go to combo
---
I must be misunderstanding, why in the world would anyone ever cleanse a dull totem if Cursed Suffering existed? I‚Äôd DC on the spot if I saw a teammate doing one. By trying to prevent NOED you‚Äôre giving the killer a power much stronger than NOED! I don‚Äôt get it. Am I reading this right that if survivors cleanse dulls, a 115% killer will permanently move between 118-127% until the 5th is cleansed? If so that‚Äôs insane and a win/win for the killer and the survivors can do nothing to stop it. Cleanse the totems, lose the game. Don‚Äôt cleanse the totems, get NOED.
---
&gt;thinking the wiki is controlled by the devs
---
Ok
---
Yeah DC's are for toxic trash.  Fuck that guy if that's how he plays.
---
Lol it sucks because, as an up and coming survivor, I'm going to feel the future wrath of this particular person when they lose it and go Omega Blink Nurse and Run NOED on every Killer Build as a result of the shit talking ü§£ü§£
---
The greatest sacrifices require the strongest wills.
---
It's supposed to introduce a meta that finally forces people to destroy totems
---
I always use those perks because they're most profitable.. Unless you're deep in high ranks where you'll have to sweat the shit out of yourself, le 666 blink Nurse
---
This sub is the reason I have unhealthy desires to play as Michael Myers
---
Would be the only way for me to pay 55 frickin dollars for this shit
---
Like hooking someone then swinging at them. Facecamping. Mori spamming. That type of shit. Just playing the game with the intention of being an ass.
---
That's cool, I really like it, have an orange internet point.
---
Observe how survivors use vaults and loops, and time your shocks accordingly. You can shut down a loop quickly if you can shock and switch quickly.
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for the daddy Myers body pillow
---
"FACECAMPING, 4K, I CAN DO ANYTHING!"
---
I‚Äôm just gonna copy/paste what I said in another similar thread:
---
Personally, I think the only thing that seriously needs changing is the fact that if you miss once, that‚Äôs your entire power gone and you don‚Äôt get another go for a full 20 seconds.  Yeah, it was stupid and annoying before when Legion could just spam his fucking attack infinitely and basically guarantee a hit no matter what you did, but flying directly from that extreme to the opposite extreme of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have this now situational and somewhat finicky power that we‚Äôve decreased the speed, mobility, downing potential, and ability to track the first target of completely nullified after one fuckup.  And then the killer has to stand in place blind for four whole seconds.  And also lets keep having shit and arbitrary hitboxes.‚Äù
---
I think a good compromise would‚Äôve been to lose 50% of your total bar for each missed frenzy attack, and include a brown, yellow, and green add-on that would reduce the amount of bar lost for missed frenzy attacks down to 40%, 33.33%, and 25% respectively (that do not stack with each other).  That way it still prevents spamming but missing once doesn‚Äôt completely and immediately ruin your entire momentum.
---
Ask her
---
Platform: Xbox One
---
Bug: achievements
---
I know it's been in the game a while but I've really been trying to get some of these achievements. I've done adept: clown, hag, and leatherface. Havent received the achievements for them. All four kills on each with using only the three perks, no add ons or offerings.
---
Yes you can but it's more worth it to buy the dlcs usually.
---
I watch him, he is funny but can be toxic af. He usually DCs against nurse (I play on console so nurse isn‚Äôt a prob), he will DC if he has toxic teammates, such as ppl trying to sandbag him, and he will sometimes DC from crap maps.
---
i feel ya i ran into a billy last night that had ti and was super confused like do you really need it on a BILLY comon man
---
The bot commited mods gay or what?
---
It does the exact opposite though? You‚Äôre making the killer more powerful by cleansing them!
---
It apparently does. Thanks!
---
Hilarious!
---
Not true dumbass
---
Typically, if you have three survivors, and more than three gens left, the game practically becomes a free-for-all. Hiding/hatching is a legitimate strategy, though perhaps is not the most friendly approach.
---
u mad tho
---
"Others do it too so that's okay"
---
People want to get it easily and use it as (another) second chance perk, specially against M1 killers (You know... Everyone except Billy), wich is why protecting your teammates for it to activate doesn't sound likable to them, that requires you to be altruistic and that's a big no no for flashlight warriors
---
You know, the usual...
---
I'm pretty sure Laurie Strode is the only character in DBD under 18.
---
It‚Äôs a mandatory perk in my personal lineup. It goes so fucking good with adrenaline especially at tier 3.
---
Hope
---
Adrenaline 
---
Balanced Landing (or Dead Hard for the characters that don‚Äôt have BL)
---
And my fourth perk I like to switch it up between Bond, Stakeout, Prove Thyself, and DS. I Mostly pick Bond though.
---
Technician isn't useless in my opinion. It actually comes in handy when trying to power through Ruin skill checks. Since ur aiming for the great skill checks and they aren't easy to hit, technician actually silences a lot of the explosions and gives u more time and less of a chance to alert a killer. It's great
---
Yeah it takes all the fun out of them for it. I mean they do it for your reaction hoping you'll give a bad one like "kys buddy!" Or "Fuck you pal!" They want that so I prefer to not give them it and mess with their fun way way more!
---
Imagine being this mad about getting banned after watching someone's stream and saying dumb shit in the chat.
---
Try to use that brain of yours . It is "Others do it too" like in - others do it too and we all know about it and there is nothing really new to tell/we know it sucks/ unless you really want make it personal which that guy obviously is trying to do and here is definately not the place for that
---
Thanks alot everyone for the nice messages, I hoped some would like it, but this is overwhelming, It makes me so happy, way better received than any other I posted.
---
I put it on Youtube too if you wanna come by and say hi.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDu8_8MjL_I
---
Ill consider making more in the future for sure.
---
They weren't camping. They actually left me for a while to look for the jake, until my bleed out timer was down to 30%. He had more than enough time to come get. Me plus the hag wasn't even putting traps down. But he would've known that if he would've tried rather than camping the hatch.
---
I'm so mad, but it is so accurate that i can forgive you.
---
haha true. I think this should have been spirit butttt we all got love for mama anna
---
Try the dbd discord
---
That's a funny way of spelling Myers
---
Does hope and adrenaline not cancel eachother out what with both being exhaustion over-ride perks?
---
I understand it‚Äôs also annoying to have randoms screwing you over, and the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù thing to do as a Survivor is to gather friends/people you know who are good and know the meta/goal/skills to survive, but it sucks a lot as a Killer too.
---
I‚Äôd love if they introduced a Competitive Mode that was Solo-Only, and made Ranking/Placement rewards. Even if it was just BloodPoints or maybe Iridescent Shards.
---
tell that to killer mains
---
This is a good point. I get matched with 15s and 14s sometimes but they will have a complete loadout
---
I'd love to do this, but that's 2AM to 8AM in my timezone, I doubt I'd be able to get 15 matches in at that time.
---
lmao my favorite part about the shirtless myers meme is that it's never going to happen lol
---
hes a total POS. he dont know how to be a killer unless its a insidious  leatherface and he sucks as bad a survivor and blames his teamamtes  for him dying and always expecting his teamamtes to  cover his ass  his mother should have swallowed him insread of giving birth to such trash GARBO and if you notice his viewers have gone down too cause ppl dont want to see that kind of trash content   he really needs to get  good at the game after almost 6000 hrs in game ffs
---
Contact support then?
---
Claudette in her classic pose, "DC Claudette".
---
&gt;  I ran to the Kate but turned out she hid in a locker so I kept opening it til the killer showed up and killed us both. 
---
yeah your a bad person...
---
the first VHS tapes came to America in 1977. horses were not a method of transit by then, only a recreational activity.

I made the same sound Pig makes when hit by a pallet lmao.

Great stuff :)
---
&gt; Imagine participating in a sports league of any kind IRL and a member was DMing people this stuff.
---
In a sport league, these things are actually encouraged. I've played in soccer leagues in division 2 - 3 [division 1 is for extremely good people who have potential to go pro], and shit talking is literally encouraged. Refs don't give you yellow or reds for saying something to someone, unless it's clearly obvious that what you're saying is an extreme [even then, some refs let it slide].
---
You're not for free speech because you want to literally ban someone who says something mean to you. That's not for free speech, that's against it because you don't like what freedom entails. It means the freedom to say anything, and some people abuse that in a negative way
---
Thank you brother!
---
Hope doesn‚Äôt trigger exhaution though, so you can use both without worries. You made me double check the wiki lol.
---
The dude made a point about angrypugs behavior. Sure, he can get banned, but that doesn't change the fact angrypug is acting immature and petty. Him banning people from chat isnt a new thing either. He does it quite often. Saying even something slightly wrong to him will get a chat ban. Don't defend toxic people.
---
I started to use The Legion after his rework. And i'm having fun playing him. The only thing i don't like is being slow while in Frenzy.
---
Honestly I've just defaulted to tryharding to the best of my abilities on both roles and keeping the endgame chat closed.
---
I don't know what my opponents think is fun or not, I don't know if they're scared of me or thinking "lol what a scrub", when I'm playing surv I don't know if the killer has a murderous satisfaction on tunneling me or if he's just trying to win.
---
At the end of the day, only we are responsible for or own fun, and I'm not gonna let anyone ruin that for me. So I just play for myself.
---
I would have been annoyed and let them die if they got hooked, but i would not have gone to a locker and kept opening it while they were inside or other toxic stuff. Your just trying to be the bigger asshole so you can feel "happy" that they died with you, instead of focusing on escaping yourself.
---
Imagine whiteknighting a neckbearded manchild. YIKES.

If you like running the killer around and using exhaustion perks that much, Vigil might be a fun one to try out.  IDK if you've ever experimented with it but I think you'll be surprised how quickly you can use BL again.  BL+Vigil is especially insane on The Game map but useful on numerous others.

r/BetterEveryLoop
---
You don't think it's anything special, which is perfectly fine.
---
That's my point: why get mad about a stream you clearly don't enjoy watching? Watch something else and have a smoothie to calm the nerves.
---
I hope you will get some help soon &lt;3
---
To fuck him up
---
‚ÄúExcuse me sir, I need to get past‚Äù
---
Well remember, this only applies to Dull Totems.
---
If a person runs a hex with it, then that's only 4 Dull Totems to work with
---
Freddy needs Enduring and Franklins is worthless if youre good.
---
That looks super cool! My school doesn't let us do anything to our caps :(
---
You don't even need to have good perks/comms, the fact that you know your teammates aren't potatoes that will just sit in a corner and stare at their toes is enough. Playing the game solo as survivor especially against strong stuff like instasaw billy, etc. is frustrating when half of your teammates is clueless even at red ranks. There is no fear in that.
---
The introduction of ranked mode would be awful, each game would be full of sweaty players with all of the most broken stuff and with zero room for anything fun. You can't make an asymetrical game competetive as it can't be properly balanced. Plus this game is rng heavy.
---
It'd hurt the already slow queues, and everyone else in the "normal" queue would be paired with each other, which would also be negative to the game's health.
---
Well I am a firm believer of an eye for an eye and I CAN be Petty. So basically wut I'm saying is if someone ruins MY fun I'm going to do the same to them as payback. It might be a little childish but that's the way I see it. (Btw I'm not trying to argue if that's how it seems, Im just defending my actions in a calm manner)
---
okay, why should we care?
---
ü§£ü§£
---
Hes so fucking money hungry like desperate lmao
---
And that exactly is why its bullshit, if everything is close together and the killer shuts the hatch.  You may as well run him for the 2 minutes or being his toy while they keep you downed or release you for more chase points.
---
Killer: one that traps survivors in lockers for x-amount of time and highlights it in yellow outside of x meters, maybe one that reduces terror radius by x-amlunt per gen done like fore up but for terror radius
---
Survivor: each time you personally complete a gen either your altruistic speed increases or you gain a small haste for x amount of time, or one that gives you  a haste after getting x amount of chases escaped ,
---
also I would argue on your last statement but that would be too much of a hassle.
---
This, also spirit fury can be useful with enduring you will get a free hit when fury activates.
---
Vanity Mirror is shit compared to Scratched Mirror, no point if they can hear you coming. and it slows you down to 108% speed, so you're only slightly faster than Tier 1 Scratched Mirror anyway. You're basically just gimping yourself by giving yourself a terror radius and less wall hack range.
---
Useful perks for high ranks, let them do his work (Behaviour staff).
---
Thank you for the update &lt;3
---
Thx fixed it ^^
---
Bug: Offering loss on game cancelation due to player disconnect before match starts.
---
Basically the game randomly will burn the offering even though match was canceled. Not everytime but often enough I have noticed what's going on. Can possibly provide screenshots or video but it is random
---
Sweety use that brain of yours and make educated decisions. You obviously knew mettle of man was broken and destined for nerfs since leaks. Yet youre shocked?
---
Fools got played, too sad. It was rightfully nerfed because it had no place in this game like legion. 0 skill to use mom, no downside to using it - over powered
---
Don't play victim and pretend you didnt see this coming. You (and the rest of the whiney survivors) should be mad at yourselves and not behaivior for being dumb. And dont bring up the sales. We all know youre going to spend $50 on cosmetics tomorrow hunny so sit down.
---
The original comment paints a rather one-sided picture, so it doesn't hurt to bring up the fact that the other side isn't innocent of it either.
---
When the Entity starts hitting the bottle early on Friday.
---
Out of all the low tier perks to shit on you chose the one debatably good one lol
---
Nope, you trollin the trollers
---
r/dadbydayligth
---
honestly i used it against a spirit, and i was surprised how much faster i felt, and i was able to be able to run her from one side of the map to the other side to get to the exit, while it was open, I felt way too intense
---
Saving for a build for when I‚Äôm against SWF.
---
Or, you know, it's a relatively rare sight to see. Who wouldn't mention it if they got to see it firsthand?  
---
That was a weird and oddly specific place to go, by the way. I somehow get the feeling that someone is projecting some feelings.
---
No I'm venting and warning others of his behavior. And don't worry. I'm never watching him again.
---
Here's some of my favorite perk concepts.
---
### Killer perks
---
&gt; #### Live Bait
---
&gt; Nothing like the squeal of a rat in a trap to bring the rest of the rodents out. Survivors will be exposed while healing others, and for 5/10/15 seconds afterwards.
---
&gt; #### Blinding fear
---
&gt; In their desperation to escape, the survivors intense focus on their tasks takes their attention away from the dangers around them.
---
&gt; While performing a repair, heal, sabotage, search, or open gate action, the sound of the terror radius is 10/25/40% quieter to them, and their field of view is slightly smaller.
---
&gt; #### Hidden Intentions
---
&gt; You appear innocent at a distance, your dark intentions unseen until it is too late.
---
&gt; Your red stain is invisible to survivors further than 24/16/8 meters from you.
---
&gt; #### Hypocrites
---
&gt; Whether they accept it or not, everyone harbors the same evil as you, an evil that causes them to sabotage their own efforts.
---
&gt; Generators worked on by survivors will automatically regress 15/10/5 seconds after there are no survivors touching them. Survivors cannot see white sparks from regressing generators.
---
&gt; #### Dissociation
---
&gt; You are able to conceal your nature within a facade of innocence, for a time.
---
&gt; For 20 seconds after hooking a survivor, your terror radius is reduced by 8/16/24 meters and you have no red stain. Your terror radius returns to normal if you enter a chase or make an offensive action.
---
&gt; #### Murder and Madness
---
&gt; You receive a 4/6/8% increase to your movement speed for 10 seconds upon entering a chase. This time does not count towards gaining bloodlust, and ends when you begin channeling an offensive action. If you lunge during this time, the speed boost will last until the end of the lunge. This can only trigger once every 60/50/40 seconds.
---
### Survivor Perks
---
&gt; #### Sacrifice for Progress
---
&gt; You are willing to sacrifice yourself in the name of progress, if you must.
---
&gt; When you are hooked, all other survivors gain a 3/5/7% haste effect and a 1/3/5% increase to repair speed for 15 seconds. These bonuses will continue to apply whenever the killer is within 16 meters of you and not in chase, while you are still on hook.
---
&gt; Additionally, you gain a 100% bonus to all bloodpoints if any generators are completed, or gates opened while you are hooked.
---
&gt; The bonus Bloodpoints are only awarded post-Trial.
---
&gt; #### Alchemist
---
&gt; You are able to prepare medical concoctions that can do far more than the same ingredients in another‚Äôs hands.
---
&gt; This perk activates after you use a medkit to heal another survivor for 15% of a health state, or you use a medkit to complete a health state. Once active, the survivor gains endurance while you are healing them and for 5/10/15 seconds afterwards. When you stop healing, the perk becomes inactive again. This perk can only activate once every 40 seconds.
---
&gt; #### This Is The Moment
---
&gt; No matter the trials, no matter the cost, you are prepared to push forward for all that you have fought for.
---
&gt; If you are unhooked while the killer is within 24 meters of you, gain a speed boost to move at 200% your normal running speed for 3 seconds. You do not leave scratch marks or create loud noise notifications from rushed actions during this time.
---
&gt; Causes the Exhausted status effect for 40/30/20 seconds.
---
&gt; This will trump any other uses of Exhaustion that occur when you are unhooked.
---
&gt; #### Silent step
---
&gt; You can pass completely unnoticed, even to sensitive ears.
---
&gt; Your footsteps while running are 25/50/75% quieter, as are the sounds you make while opening lockers and vaulting obstacles, though rushing still creates an alert if the killer is not nearby. At level 3, you do not rustle grass.
---
&gt; #### Light fingers
---
&gt; You are practiced at taking things without people knowing until it's too late.
---
&gt; When making a hook save, the killer will not be alerted and their ui not be updated until 5/15/25 seconds later. The icons at the bottom will still show them hooked, and they will see a fake aura on the hook.
---
&gt; This also applies to escaping the hook yourself.
---
&gt; #### Selfless Sacrifice
---
&gt; You simply cannot leave others to die, even if it means putting yourself in danger to save them.
---
&gt; **Obsession perk**
---
&gt; Unhooking a survivor grants them a boost of 150% normal running speed for 3 seconds, but exhausts you for 60/50/40 seconds.
---
&gt; Selfless sacrifice ignores exhaustion.
---
&gt; **If you are the obsession:**
---
&gt; Saving someone from the hook will save their hook progress, and will not automatically progress them to the next stage if they are hooked again. They will also recover 0/10/20% of their progress through the current hook phase. This can happen once for each hook phase.
---
&gt; However, you start the game already at 100/75/50% hook progress, meaning you are killed in just 1/2/2 hook(s) instead of 3.
---
I'm sure the numbers are all kinds of unbalanced, but I like the design space of these perks. All of them except for Blinding Fear are from licensed chapter ideas, I'll let you guess what they're from though.
---
hope is definitely useful against the huntress
---
So console players wont be able to get the "reward".
---
damn that sucks
---
Like I get the argument for saying to people they should have thick skin.
---
But that said what are you going to say to new people who would get insulted win or lose?
---
It's so much easier for said hypothetical person to simply quit the game and not deal with toxicity than go get used to it and continue. Especially after games where you lose and still get insulted.
---
This game is actually fun but the community is one of the worst I have experienced and honestly it's such an important aspect because if there are steps to prevent toxicity then the positive aspects of the community shine and the playerbase grows.
---
But in this game I dont think I have ever heard of anybody getting significant ban hammers due to toxicity. At least not with the frequency that is needed.
---
Would not be surprised with the playerbase going down in number where new killer players dont want to play due to community and survivor players get very upset when things that clearly needed to be nerfed like mettle of man get nerfed.
---
Pillbilly
---
Just because it allows people to crouch and be fast doesn't make it a bad perk. What gives it a bad name is a number of users who refuse to do anything while using it. So does it make the perk bad? No, but the users are the problem.
---
Don't stay in post game chat and you don't have to deal with it
---
The entire DbD community doesn't deserve this level of shitposting
---
PC
---
That's awesome! Well done! Congrats on your graduation!
---
In that case imo it should be reportable. If you have video of it then I'd sent a ticket.
---
Why would I be mad? It was literally the one and only message I wrote in chat calling him out lmao
---
To test the only killer who is about to get a complete rework doesn't seem the best option, as it won't help the devs at all. Obviously you can do whatever you want, but in terms of data, the current Freddy won't be analyzed.
---
Yeah but Burger King Myers is still the best strat /s
---
The bps are nice. Only get shrine perks of characters/killers you don't own and don't plan on buying. (bbq if you don't own leatherface)
---
Maybe he was trying to expose the kate so the killer would take her and he could run off. Leaving her to die and then he could escape. If i get off a hook and there are gens to be done and Ik where the hatch camping random is, you can bet I will run to them and purposely sandbag them so I can escape. If you arent actively working towards both of us getting out, you are dead weight and I am trading your survival for mine. Simple as that
---
You care enough to read and reply
---
I need that fat boy clown body pillow
---
It's a visual thing or a typo I guess. Still takes 2 minutes.
---
Salty that an overpowered perk that costs money to get it now going to be completely useless
---
do oyu mean he BEGS for money LUL  watch him  hes even worse on a subabthon when time is running out   he will say are you sure you want the stream to end   like BEGGING ppl to support him.. TRASH
---
I get what you mean. I used to watch him but had to stop bc his whole attitude and the way he spoke and acted was so freaking cringey and it's like dude, you're 39 like wtf?! I watch fungoose now and he's a breath of fresh air and is so knowledgeable about the game and explains it so well and in a way you can understand and he has a such better attitude!
---
Sometimes it's the smarter move if the killer gets the stronger ones first. If they teamed up against other survivors that's an issue.
---
Two weeks?
---
Exposed lol
---
It‚Äôs not even that I want consistent 4K‚Äôs or just to be easily mopping the floor, it‚Äôs just that SWF Groups have a certain ‚Äúawareness‚Äù among eachother, and can string together Perks/Items that make your job as Killer a nightmare.  Having 3 people escape right in front of your nose because they all timed Borrowed Time/Decisive correctly.
---
Isn‚Äôt the age of consent in Canada (where the Legion are from) 16 anyway?
---
It's not likes lol, not participating in normal gameplay is in the report list and sitting in a corner not helping or even trying to help while tbagging and pointing not to mention not helping with gens is considered not participating.
---
what have you done
---
I mean that can happen even without a swf, as long as the players are competent. 
---
SWF just puts this situation together more often. And as the official stats show, 3/4 swf groups are tiny % of the players.
---
Where are you from? I mean what region you play in? I have a feeling that this might be a factor.
---
I have a real job with benefits. I'm not mad. He's being paid to play the game, not DC. So it's worse.
---
Worst idea: you have a 5% chance when playing as Nea to spawn in as the Entity.
---
I really think every original survivor needs a legion outfit.
---
If you're playing smart, you will take on the role that your team needs, not the role that your offering says you should. If you do the latter, then you're going to maybe get your 3000 back in Altruism, but you're going to have a low-scoring game overall and lose out on BPs because you were a shit team player and you didn't make it out.   
---
Then the Dwight next to you is going to be pissed as fuck because you farmed him for altruism bps and he had just used a survival offering.
---
To claim that it's no problem to get 3000 extra bloodpoints in a category, you have to believe that it's no problem to get that across the board.
---
Minnesota and I play on PC.
---
I recommend Puppers. Best streamer I've ever watched.
---
Just put a GG in chat and be on your way thats what I do most of the time.
---
&gt;Everyone has their own definition of tunneling and camping. They range from reasonable to outright ridiculous.
---
"MoM is an anti-tunnelling perk!"
---
"Getting hit three times over the course of the entire match is being tunnelled?"
---
I've had this conversation more than once on this subreddit.
---
Instant trash, I'm too bad at chases to ever accomplish that.
---
You need yourself a monitor and abuse on there.  I use M&amp;A, BBQ (points!), Remember Me, and Nurses on my Freddy. Got me to level 1 with Fredrick, which I didn‚Äôt think was possible.
---
Basement wasnt there....
---
Plague has a little map pressure if you vomit on gens and stuff.
---
I'd swap Franklin's for Whispers. Whispers can help a lot of lower mobility killers to know where and where not to apply pressure on the map.
---
Oh, his current voice changer is much better.
---
They could just add the terror radius to Fire Up. That might make the perk actually worth using.
---
I WOULD GIVE ALL OF MY MONEY TO THEM
---
^YIKES
---
Still for Americans it's quite uncomfortable and just weird.
---
killer gives hatch 
---
"EZ BOIIIIIIIII"
---
&gt; yet he streams it w/o any issues.
---
And the solution to this is whining in the man's Twitch chat and running to Reddit to cry about being banned from his chat?
---
Ya but tbh most people can hit great skill checks, and skill checks dont even happen very often  so with two people on a gen its nothing and it's not hard to just find the totem so that perk is kind of over rated in my expierience surveillance, and discordance, are great or huntress lullaby if you feel confident, and if have access to overcharged it isn't bad but for most people when they realize you have it they'll be ready and hit it every time , tinkerer is really only useful for Billy and honestly I cant think of any other good gen perks anyway that's my opinion sorry it was long
---
I unlocked the IF teachable last weekend, and I've been trying to get it to show in my Nurse's web. Can't wait to try it out!
---
Again, he‚Äôs posting on here to call him out for toxic behavior, not to whine about being banned.
---
I love that small wiggle before he dead hards, just to show how it scared him.
---
I really wish they would address some of the major issues with solo queue in this game. Playing solo feels like playing on hard mode for the simple fact that you have to roulette to try and not get braindead teammates.
---
PEE PEE!?
---
For Freddy, Enduring spirit fury is really good since Freddy is a pallet magnet. At a minimum you‚Äôll need Enduring. With Freddy I always like to use Sloppy as well
---
Lol k
---
Crazy to me that NOED has been untouched for 2 years.
---
Wasted shards tbh. If you don't want to ever buy cosmetics with them , spend them. It's like  giving gold for water tho. Also you get around 50k to 90k bp per killer match with bbq and a bp offering. You will get it pretty quickly.
---
lol what
---
I would love to see the shock on peoples faces if they do implement this, like "Woah!!! I got a 75% BP bonus!? I had 3 SWF? No way, that game was not that hard". People acting like every SWF is a bunch of supercomputers is beyond me.
---
That would be sweet. I love that mask meg has from the devs other game. Looks awesome.
---
how about you just save people off the hook and accept getting hit once
---
Eesh, funko should stick to pops
---
&gt;You're literally saying you shouldnt use any of those add ons
---
That is *literally* not what I'm saying and you saying "literally a falsehood" makes you literally wrong.
---
Yup - another poor choice the devs have made. I won't pay the $12 (can) for an outfit let alone $30. (New hair is $6?) They need to make cosmetics cheaper.
---
Survivors are pretty copy paste except for their base perks. Level up for the perks you want and survivors are set.
---
Playing multiple killers is madness when it comes to perk cost, with every killer being vastly different you pretty much not only have to level the one you want, but also the killer whose perk you also want to unlock.
---
Due to only having 50 or so hours and my doc being the only 40, with hag getting there I feel like I must BBQ every game for all thr blood points I need.
---
Eeeh, that'd kinda break the economy. 
---
The quality of the games would deteriorate if everyone could trade their speed limiters for thomson's mix and tuning guide, and their mist offerings for ebony moris.
---
It's called the Endgame Collapse. Look it up.
---
Since ghost face is coming out next, i assume the new survivor will be Sydney Prescott.
---
Was Professor Tox in my doctor game? I'm a doc main and my steam name is Trygger.
---
At least on PC its not about 4k anymore... not sure on Console though
---
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
---
#SupportFreddyDBD
---
After i finished my very first dbd game the killer message me letting me know how shit i was at the game lol
---
*wrong answers only*
---
Hu thanks for the info üòä
---
Imagine using add ons.
---
I know it's fun to complain but I've mainly had chill postgame chat and positive vibes. I play as 2-4 man SWF and none of us are toxic: I'm the saltiest of us but if I'm pissed I just don't say gg, I never make an ass of myself about it.
---
Whether we run circles around the killer and make a clean getaway or we get wiped by a nasty efficient Nurse, I feel like it's rare that anyone really ends the game on a bad note.
---
For every toxic BM'ing SWF group, there's a group of friends just having a good time and wishing the same for their opponents.
---
Off topic but I miss Space Ghost: Coast to Coast. ;w;
---
Yep. The best thing is that he warned us about toxicity from another player in the pre-game chat lol.
---
then why would the lobbys get considerably longer if they are such a small percentage? i dont think you can have it both ways.
---
Nice, now instead of sandbagging you could have just recorded and reported it so they got banned for a day / week, Anyway, as i said earlier you won the competition of being the bigger asshole in that match in the end, so congratulations on that.
---
Why tf is this only 51 upvotes. Ut genuently made me laugh 
---
Or maybe my humor is just that bad, idk
---
In my games, the most toxic people are the french and Spanish.
---
You're not responsible for their insecure need to feel good about themselves. lol!
---
Three times is a little much tho.
---
Holy shit, you almost made me say the n word, nearly made me choke
---
Um, it would exactly 0 sense, actually. Furthermore, I don‚Äôt know where you got the info that one of the survivors is the entity.
---
I'd rather not ban someone. Ik how hard it is to level and do so much progress on a game only to lose it. I don't wanna be that person who even if it's a small chance to cause someone to permanently lose that. THAT in my book is the bigger asswhole action
---
Ive not once in my life used this perk and I still do really well as survivor, in fact I want this perk to be less powerful so I can finally stop going against endless billys. Plus giving the perk actual prerequisites for such a powerful effect is a no brainer, thats exactly what they did to ds and what they should‚Äôve done to this perk in the first place if they learned anything from ds.
---
Nurse main, my build atm is BBQ, Nurse's, Infectious Fright &amp; Deerstalker. I used to run Whispers but with enough game time you'll know where survivors spawn and at red ranks people don't really hide at the start (and if they do i got good enough headset to hear footsteps/breathing/grass moving). Only real use i see out of it is locating the last survivor but idc about 4ks so...
---
You watch your language!  No swearing in my christian murder simulator!
---
No
---
As a person who runs MoM in the red ranks, do you know how hard it is to actually activate or be useful? I deal with 50% billies, 20% Huntress and 30% Nurse. Two of which are M2. 
---
It's extremely rare I get any other killer at those ranks. MoM is barely used because people don't smack you. If they do, you're getting tunneled until they use your perk up and you're able to be seen to them for the remainder of the game.
---
Fucking stupid.
---
You dick!  I love it anyway.
---
[Appropiate music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4eJjmAxUGA)
---
Well its hard to say with having -9 milion xp
---
Just watch Samination
---
They don't lose any progression, only a temporary ban...
---
time period kinda sucks.
---
Oh I think that's where I'm messing up. Thank you so much
---
Agreed.
---
Noed just supports shitty killers. There killers that rely solely on that one perk and it's not ok.
---
On another note, I also am getting pissed off at how exit gates can spawn extremely close to each other - if you are the final survivor and the killer closes the hatch... You are screwed if this happens.
---
I feel like they should always spawn at oppostie ends of the map.
---
I must have missed the buff to noed where you don't need to chase anymore and survivors just get put in the dying state automatically once the gates are powered.
---
In reality though you went to save the person that got facecamped without clearing the totem first and then were surprised that you got downed
---
If she has one shot hatchets or general butt hurt survivors.
---
Fans: We want Ghostface‚Äôs robe!!
---
Devs: Have spoof Ghostface instead.
---
EZY gg baby killer!
---
Not that I think the killer was in the right, because they wasn‚Äôt, it was scummy as hell, it wasn‚Äôt reportable when survivors would 99 both doors and just hide around the map for as long as possible to stall the game,both things are stupid and annoying but unfortunately not reportable.
---
Whole clown dlc
---
I've been fairly successful running devour hope, nurses, monitor, and STBFL. Don't know why but my devour has a high success rate with Freddy. Beginning of match I try to down 1 and hook 1 just to get more off the gens and apply pressure. With Freddy you gotta run away fast after hooking though because survivors tend to unhook in Freddy's face for some reason. Try and run some block add-ons to reduce time to fall asleep too.
---
Because the sub is one big circlejerk
---
You need to chase the survivor and just 180 that bitch and go away. It sucks with most M1 killers besides myers because you cant really pull people of gens and offensive actions take tokens.
---
r/bonehurtingjuice
---
I miss focused feng :&lt;
---
Hope, Lightweight, Adrenaline and Quick and Quiet/Spine Chill is my go to perk set up.
---
Great job. Looks amazing!
---
Welcome to my Nightmare,  B I T C H !
---
About.
---
Killers honestly deserve to have MoM in the game since they play like this.   
---
MoM is one of the few abilities that will assist against a camper, and can counter NOED if MoM activates during the end of the game (and only for that first hit).   
---
Killer mains created the necessity for perks like MoM, then cry about its existence.
---
Part 1! Hey survivors! Wanna stop killers from camping in your games? DO GENS AND ESCAPE!
---
This is exactly what was thinking of actually! Panther Woman lol
---
Damn. Isnt it just being aggressive with the obsession though? Or is it everyone?
---
To be fair, this screenshot could have been taken like 3 seconds after the first hook of the game. But yea camping is pretty bullshit and makes the game unfun for everyone involved (killer included).
---
My favourite thing to do in the entire game is to loop a huntress around a loop without a pallet on. She literally never catches up if you hug the walls correctly.
---
No its the obession start a chase 180 that bitch and you get tokens
---
New Killer: The Spaghetti
---
Yeah screw their economy. If the best offerings and addons break the game, that's not a good thing. The addons should make an item or killer better at what they already do, or change up how their power works, not just make them OP. Moris are their own issue, but frankly the economy is already bad. If you really want to, just funnel all your points into one killer and one survivor, and you'll have insane amounts of broken addons for survivor and killer. As it stands, I have probably 20+ ebony moris across my killers(not including other moris) and I have like 20+ instaheals(the needles, not including the ones that heal one stage, or other strong addons). The point gain makes more sense since survivors don't need items to succeed as much, and can potentially keep their items with all the addons. The killer is basically forced to burn at least 2 browns every game(if not more) and they lose their stuff every time unless they burn a black ward.
---
Also, why are you complaining about the potential game economy while simultaneously saying survivors don't get enough?
---
Ahhh I see. So the others are fair game then with aggression?
---
I had to draw my favorite boys taking a shirtless selfie lol

Nice bald head, does your boyfriend wax it for you Hahahaha Hahahaha I‚Äôm crying this is who is trolling me üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

He constantly belittles his viewers and is a grade a dick.  I watched him once and he was being arrogant and cocky so he got up from his chair and I said fatass in chat.  He proceeded to call me a virgin that lives at home with his parents.  Sounds like something a 5th grader would say. Nothing against streamers but I mean come on, you sit in front of a computer and play games all day for money.  He basically whores himself for bits and then puts others down.
---
Well you cant hit them or you lose tokens. Play with your food is way better suited for stealth killers so they can pull people off gens regular terror radius killers with zero stealth kinda shouldnt use it.
---
Meg is hella cute here
---
It could be but thats only if the killer doesnt break pallets I was also thinking it could be a token based perk not sure
---
107% is a huge difference. The speedboost of noed is 4% and even that is noticeable
---
Ahhhhhh. I get it now. Sounds good for little miss Oinker then
---
Yeah it is actually.
---
haHAA
---
Why did you even go in the locker...
---
Also how did he get a 4 KC (regardless if you escaped, you were hooked at the end and should've been a death) on Backwater with what looks like murky / hazy on, with 2 gens left? Are you all terrible?
---
Perhaps try asking about what happened before making an assumption and sounded like an asshole. Because you're dead wrong about what happened.   
---
Nobody went in for a save without cleansing NOED. She got her SECOND DOWN OF THE GAME due to NOED, and got one right after that because she had Infectious Fright and knew where the next person was nearby (they had no cover). The last person cleansed the totem and went in for a save, but of course BT isn't an inherent ability as it should be, so she got them too. One person escaped.   
---
You know, it is possible to do all the right things and still lose because camping is fucking stupid OP, as well as NOED.
---
What makes you think the huntress is special!?! The killer doesn‚Äôt matter, they were going to dc anyway.
---
Dudes a toxic prick, but I guess that‚Äôs his whole appeal. Personally I watch Bricky and Ardetha and I find them to be much more entertaining.
---
Was considering getting her. Should I? Is she any good? I'm still kind of learning everything. I've played off and on since the games release on console and I'm just starting to play killer
---
Gg ezy baby killer
---
I've never heard of a killer complain about their camping.
---
She got weaker from the nerf but she is still fun. She has 2 good perks in surveilance and Make your choice.
---
I think this confirms that there‚Äôs gonna be a whole ghostface chapter, since it‚Äôll most likely come out next month.
---
I know. I wish it was like that too, just saying that you don't have to take shit from people that just want to flex because they need that gamer validation. Put all that salt on you fries, my friend.
---
Except that won't stop killers from camping. They'll still get the kills they camp, and a lot of them are just out there to be trolls. They don't care about BP's, they care about ruining someone else's experience.
---
Changed to where you need Protection hits and not just regular ole M1s. So you gotta try to body block for a teammate to earn a stack and instead of getting smacked.
---
Sounds like an average Ochido fanboy
---
I mean, maybe it's fun standing around doing nothing to some people, but most people I know like playing the game.
---
I used to play Legion because she (I played Susie) was the first killer I liked playing because she was fun but then they got nerfed pretty bad...Then my boyfriend bought me Michael today and I really liked him too. Then he recommended Piggy and I didnt know if she was good. So thank you for telling me that
---
Sorry for rambling lol
---
Especially for fast killers. I got away from a Hillbilly ONCE as final survivor in EGC.  
---
It was an incredibly narrow escape, and was only possible because the gates were on opposite ends, and he didn't have a straight path to me. If they were any closer, I wouldn't have made it.
---
Whatever time it may be (its probably lower unless you got caught exactly at the start of EDC and its your first down). Yeah you're wasting each other time but there is nothing to complain here, its not against the rules and that is exactly why behaviour put out a timer.
---
Its fine my dude. I would recomend playing freddy too. He does suck but if you master freddy youre going to be a scary killer.
---
The killer can always choose to NOT camp. It's their fault if they're bored because nobody comes in for a save.
---
Omg I didn't know about it thanks.
---
My personal favorite is when I get flashlight spammed, tea bagged, and the whole damn team rushes the hook, and then complains when I say fuck it and face camp them one at a time.
---
I believe the cure of toxicity is toxicity. Change my mind.
---
Ok thank you for helping with this :3 Hopefully I get better...I'm still kind of bad
---
Why are people downvoting an honest question?
---
thank you!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Just keep playing my dude. We all sucked at one point.
---
Now we just need a bucket of lube and we have ourselves a party !
---
Highly doubt it, they said before that they didn‚Äôt wanna do anymore exclusives and since this isn‚Äôt available on console.. it‚Äôs probably just extra bloodpoints or something
---
You can collapse chat by pressing the double arrows.
---
Hmm
---
Mhmm! I'm really really bad...lol
---
Been watching a lot of Truetalent though and I see how he deals with situations and I mimick it and it works. So I guess I'll keep doing that
---
Watched him occasionally but the B.B.B became cringe and seemed desperate, he was banning anyone and everyone that didn‚Äôt agree with him. Allowed his chat to attack people. Then I noticed that PRIDE TATTOO and I was over him. I rather watch small up and coming streamers than an overweight, egotistical, man child. He‚Äôs toxic af.
---
Hey now, they haven't gone wild just yet lol.
---
Pretty much can say the same about killers when they say you abused the shack or feel like they need Franklin's if they see a flashlight.
---
Huntress is the type of killer that's conceptually fun for both sides but usually ends up being annoying for both as her hitboxes aren't exactly consistent.
---
Sprinkle a lil borrowed time on there for that gg ez in the end game chat.

I love Scream.

Don't forget the slip 'n slide with that bucket of lube!
---
hehexd
---
Killer sits next to basement chest all match
---
"LOL UR TRASH EZZZZZZZZZ"
---
Spies from the shadows is good on huntress imo
---
Yeah, the main mistake I think people make with the apple addons is using the corrupt right at the beginning of the match. I think it‚Äôs way better to wait till everyone‚Äôs broken, and then use it. They usually panic cleanse, and until they do they‚Äôre easy downs with the corrupt.
---
True.
---
Oh. . .
---
i am not the best with titles
---
Looking for a killer to play mainly, but i may end up getting 2 of them, probably leatherface, then mikey or pig
---
I don't know maybe???
---
I've heard online that dead by daylight has a more toxic fanbase than other games but I didn't really believe it.
---
If you plan to unlock every perk, just use BPs to do it. Only buy a teachable if you don‚Äôt plan on leveling a certain survivor up.
---
yea they need to fix this especially after endgame update.
---
Mortal Kombat 11 is pretty bad about it too.
---
[No, this is the spirit](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/thumb/5/5d/HK_charSelect_portrait.png/150px-HK_charSelect_portrait.png?version=4efd5e8a634ed10d82b99d0ff00595ce)
---
lul I definitely don't think it's a perk, and yes I play both killer and survivor. Which is why I feel the devs should fix problems for both sides. This is exactly why this community gets shit on cause people are ignore and don't notice problems.
---
But, back then there were double pallets, pallet vacuums, lots of pallets, many infinites, multiple exhaustion perk uses in one chase, easier fast vaults.
---
All of those have been removed.
---
Bloodlust is something that I mostly see bad killers use to avoid mindgaming and instead run around a pallet to eventually catch someone.
---
It's less of a "second chance" and a little more of a "hand holder" for killers who don't know how to mindgame.
---
You don't even need to put the word vanilla in front of "nurse"!
---
You don't have properly perks on him. 
---
You are least have Sloppy Butcher on him ? It can help you more than Franklin's Demise. Even if Franklin Demise can help if you see keys in lobby.
---
Right, the game is a complete waste of time because the survivors are unable to score decent points or have any fun. 
---
Not to mention, the whole ‚Äújust do gens‚Äù saying is dumb as hell. If the camper ends up having NOED, these same people will say you are lazy and should‚Äôve done the totems. Wait, I thought you told us to just do gens??! On side note, this is why there should be a requirement for the killer to be able to even achieve NOED. Anyone who thinks survivors should be cleansing all the dull totems while the killer is camping is full of shit.
---
As a killer you need BBQ - leathercock perk. Otherwise hes pretty useless on better ranks. But he can be a good starting killer to learn some basics(like facecamping the hook in the basement with insidious and such).
---
The survivor should have camped one of the exit gates and tried to open it, really though you had already killed 3, they lost the 2nd chance by hatch being closed, 3rd chance is gate so its not suppose to be balanced. Though it is annoying that the gates either spawn either far apart or right next to eachother, i feel it should be more consistent in the distance between each gate.
---
I mean whoever finds it first wins right?
---
Ok, right now im only level 35 and normally am a rank 15 killer
---
I had a feeling. Just couldnt figure it out
---
Lol yeah that is what happened
---
Some people‚Äôs children. That‚Äôs.. about it. Either way. Welcome, don‚Äôt let the idiots get you down. 
---
Fragile egos on the Internet aren‚Äôt a new thing xD
---
I hope your vacation is going well c:
---
What are these other games? I need a safe space.
---
Apologies, I'll repent immediately!
---
Should be like the xp perk, where you get it from unhooking and protective hits.
---
Most of the time, I honestly don‚Äôt care that much if I live or die, and playing risky and altruistic is the most fun part of the game for me.
---
Its true
---
Unfortunately that‚Äôs how most of the community is, at least on reddit. However, there are nice members of the community. Welcome to DBD though, we have cookies and milk over there, but don‚Äôt go there, that‚Äôs where all the toxic shitlords are.
---
The nerf itself is just bad and stupid. The fact that they're changing it is fine, the problem is the way they are changing it is a classic BHVR fashion of nerfing it to hell.
---
Hail to the king, baby.
---
thanks, now i will toxic trapper some survivors
---
Jeremy always gets an upvote in my boat.
---
It's selfish because they ruin the fun? Iridescent head and prayer beads do that as well, I'm gonna take my leave. If I knew it's a facecamper right off the bat i would DC. Pre rework legion was fucking stupid in design, I DCd. If it's a nurse which is fucking broken it depends on my mood really I have no interest in head nodders, they can play with themselves. My team is a bunch on blendettes doing nothing? Time to kobe, whoops I accidentally let go off struggle. I know you guys gonna hate me for this, but I thought I will give some insight.
---
&gt;  Which is why I feel the devs should fix problems for both sides.
---
Yeah, never gonna happen, when devs do fix problems they will make a new one a week later.
---
Well, this community is toxic mainly because the game itself has many toxic elements(tbagin, camping, tunneling, nodding) and its competetive aswell. So unless you run into a sophisticated human being, you will get toxic response. Myself, I am never toxic, unless I am getting toxic ppl against me. If you are toxic - I am toxic back to you... easy as that. Otherwhise I am pretty chill and I try  to help if I can.
---
it will take you several life's to get back to positive exp
---
&gt;play with your food
---
&gt;spies from the shadows
---
Uh...
---
Yeah I didn't want to go into how broken it becomes with Noed. I saw a streamer who will remain nameless do it, he played bad and still ended uo with 3k.
---
They either need opposite ends of the map or walls between them. There‚Äôs game i have where the exits spawn almost right next to each orher(compared to map size) so i have no chance once killer closes hatch(which they didn‚Äôt do luckily, either a noob or didn‚Äôt care about ranking up that game sinve it was a 3k on my whole team except me).
---
Oh wow... well time to put on botany üòÇ
---
If the trap is active then you can't leave or you will die, but if the trap is inactive you should be able to run through the gates.
---
Eh, you probably won't like them but here it goes.
---
Friday the 13th: the game was the first bought horror game I've played and the people there (from my experience) were pretty nice but it's really hated so you probably hate it too idk.
