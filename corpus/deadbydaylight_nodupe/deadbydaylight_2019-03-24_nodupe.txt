---
Seriously! Either op is a child who‚Äôs never had alcohol or he needs to share his secrets to having an iron stomach.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to speak to you like you‚Äôre an idiot. 
---
But you might be an idiot.
---
If the bleedout timer is going down, that means you ARE NOT in a chase. 
---
You were moonwalking, which is incredibly annoying and a stupid mechanic. 
---
Like I said, undeserved. 
---
I‚Äôve seen many of my idiot teammates get killed next to the exits doing that
---
Okay i tried playing freddy, because i heard that you get a lot of bloodpoints if you use your power.
---
(Got bored off doctor)With other killers im almost always 4 manning.But when i play freddy i can't kill anyone (I don't like to play not fairly meaning i don't camp, Tunnel, or any other op bs."
---
Im not a bad killer or should i say im a decent killer for my rank.  
---
But with freddy i can't kill a single survivor and its frustrating when i get called a "noob" for not killing any one with him.
---
So my question to u is what rank are you at the moment and could you give me some tipps for freddy?
---
Karen took the kids
---
The dropped power persisted in a limited for for ages too...if you weren't paying attention as killer you'd spawn in and NOT pick up your power and be like WTF ??
---
&gt; 2x Play With Your Food
---
smh fake fans üò§  but why wouldn't someone just use 4x stbfl
---
funny because that was fixed today. 
---
IMO I feel like she‚Äôs easier to play against if the survivors aren‚Äôt drinking from the fountain. She can‚Äôt use her ranged attack and then it‚Äôs just loop city from there.
---
Why have you sent this?
---
Cause it's fun to do and if you get upset from a video game character taunting you then that's sad and you're pretty pathetic
---
[for the people who get upset ;(](https://youtu.be/PTkHT6UHqkI) 
---
She's my friend and I wanted to show her this. It's great lol
---
I suicided on the hook because David sandbagged and farmed a teammate and was clearly coming to farm me with the Killer in tow. I let him get right next to be before I let go. Fuck you David.
---
Oh, I see. Hope she likes it!
---
I feel like a mori where you pull someone out from the exit is exactly what the devs were going for when they created Legion's mori.
---
White washing feng I see
---
It's weirdly accurate to the character lol
---
Cool I dont care if it was fixed, just that it happened 
---
I do it for the extra points. I don‚Äôt taunt but wait for him if he‚Äôs within sight.  
---
&gt; and downed people extremely quick by letting them bleed out while moving backwards.
---
That's exactly why you have a Silver Chaser (and thus the safety pip); as far as the game's concerned you lost those chases by looking away from the Survivor (that's the same reason you can down them this way, because the game thinks you've stopped chasing them).
---
It's also basically an exploit, because you're abusing a flaw in the game's coding to give yourself an advantage. I can't stop you from doing it, but I'd like to suggest you play the Legion in a different way.
---
Toxicity doesn‚Äôt get pips
---
I deserved to rank up, even with moonwalking. I got a 3k. The devs clearly intended it to be in the game, otherwise they would've removed it. Under the only system, I would've pipped up.
---
It's a perfect example of how the new system is completely fucked.
---
I opted to avoid the yellowface
---
y tho
---
Making everyone broken &lt; Having to hide for 30 seconds
---
imo
---
No. I don‚Äôt think the devs intended that to happen. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúremove‚Äù it. What does that even mean?
---
The new system may be fucked but play like scum and get treated like such. 
---
Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre serious
---
It stands for big black club.
---
It‚Äôd be be cool to be a separate game mode too.
---
Also, you needed tier 3 to have one shot ability. This perk appears to be commonly used within the beginners circle (with an occasional nurse main  psychopath on the side) it was lesser used perk because of it. Now you could be a level 2 killer with level 1 NOED and get 1-2 ez kills per game.
---
I sincerely hope not, since they had to edit it to be more nasty üòí
---
*gets it off*
---
*gets downed right after*
---
*get a brand new one*
---
Thank you! 
---
No closets but we did some fun Mori pictures ‚ò∫
---
Right next to the basement staircase
---
SO NO RBT?
---
AIGHT IM BOUTTA HEAD OUT
---
whoa, downing survivors is also a exploit. actually, playing the game is a bannable offense, we all should be playing CIVILIZATION VI 
---
It's amazing how people are so pissy about NOED to the point they ignore the fact that it's only 5 Totems for 4 people to cleanse and there are various ways in which you can easily take them down. Such as learning the spawns, Small Game, Detective's Hunch, Red Twine Map add-on and the Rainbow Map.
---
It's not like a massive amount of Killers are currently running it so it'd make sense to start considering counter play. But nah, let's just absolutely ignore the Totems and bitch about getting hit with NOED.
---
I wait to make sure my team is going to get out tbh.
---
This is a wonderful idea.
---
I‚Äôm sure you couldn‚Äôt do better then this 
---
i would say yes its unfair you didnt pip but then again the rank is supposed to be a representative of skill and when you basicly curbstomp babies in no time at all does it show your skill or their lack of skill.
---
Whoops hahah its been a while! Not sure but I think it was so killers could miss swings and still be able to swing immediately after + no need to find the obsession to get stacks.
---
Could've done Kate or nea... just saying
---
As a killer it isboring. I wish I could use other perks but it can be so vital in slowing the game down enough to gain momentum. Even with ruin, when up against good survivors they can still pop 2 gens during the first chase.
---
I did the character I like most. 
---
You can take your trolling elsewhere üëã
---
As a Survivor, if they start taunting I'm gone.  If they die, it's their own fault.
---
As a Killer?  I have quite the watchlist queued up for such a situation while I chill in the Basement..
---
At least you have the courage to admit it. 
---
I do stick at the edge right next to the exit and just let myself enter dying so I can crawl out. I know the killers gets extra points and I‚Äôm pretty sure you get some bonus by for escaping while crawling.
---
Well that's a fact, nobody can argue with that. However, how can you be sure all totems are cleansed before the end game? How do we know the killer is even running the perk before it's too late? 
---
That's the issue with NOED. You don't know if all totems were cleansed unless you did it yourself or you are playing swf who can communicate the totems. When the gates are powered how can we be sure we are not just one shot away from losing the game? 
---
All that devs need to do is put totem count in the hud and make it clear NOED is active when gates are powered. The first one makes it so that there is lesser information gap between solo and swf and the second one provides a fighting chance before it's too late. 
---
No I mean that it‚Äôs pretty common for the reviews to spike like this along updates like this
---
Is that Meta Knight's symbol? 
---
if you are a good enough killer then you wont need ruin against bad players but ruin is to stop bad players from doing gens to quickly since they cannot hit great skillchecks and also at the same time slow down the good survivors from making the gen take less then 80s because they hit greats on every pop-up. ruin is a bandaid fix to a problem with dbd when it comes to gen speed but it also is a necesary evil in this case cause if you add more time on the generator no one would be playing survivor. ruin doesnt really change the game to much if you power through it, but its physchological since you dont want to be the one not hitting those skillchecks
---
It doesn‚Äôt stop people from touching anything. A decent survivor isn‚Äôt afraid of the broken status and won‚Äôt give you corrupted purge, meaning that you‚Äôre stuck chasing normally.
---
&gt; find the obsession to get stacks.
---
I meant original stbfl
---
I don't have a link to it, but HybridPanda, AngryPug and some others went to behaviors HQ and checked out the future of dead by daylight. When they got back, they all tweeted about battle royale (or beansroyale) and some dead by daylight locations (like Haddonfield)
---
Chaser is tough as shit with a lot of killers. Legion is not one of them. 
---
All DLC are worth it for the perks alone.
---
Run pebble, or stake out. Pebble is the most useful, since it will light up whenever your in the terror radius, and you can throw it when in the terror radius, letting you know that you are in it. Geef, a Twitch streamer, has a friend whos deaf and has a loadout that lets her play more effectively. Check him out, and ask about her, and maybe see what shes got ?
---
Only 3 or 4 games at rank 5 seems impossible, and I'm a pro killer. I did seem to learn never to use her power, so that they can't use a healing fountain to hurt my points by healing. But I'm still at it. I got it once before the fix that allowed the trophy to be possible, so it was wasted. But it's just all luck. I'm just so sick of it, as it isn't in any way fun.
---
Yep, game is unplayable after 2.6.0. I played Thursday+Friday 9 games, and in 6 of those I faced at least one of them: Me crashing mid game, someone dcing mid game or in the loading screen, couldn't heal myself/another survivor(haven't changed keyboard cfg before). Bonus: I was leveling Nea today, and somehow I skipped lvl 31 bloodweb, I went straight to lvl 32 from lvl 30...

as killer it is your job to make them leave and that is what I do or if I am really not in the mood I just go somewhere and AFK so it really does not bother me like it does for so many people
---
This isn't nearly as complete as my killer bingo (on which I have a full blackout for sure) but I have encountered most of these. 
---
Being competitive makes you want to do amazing. 
---
You will get those laggy hits even with dedicated servers. Dedicated servers won't make the lag go away.
---
Anybody who's played for honor will tell you that the change from p2p to dedicated servers didn't remove anything besides lag switching and the game ending when the host disconnects. With DbD we will only get the former, as we won't have any hosts and once the killer disconnects the game is over anyway.
---
And you and your 3 friends can take your shitty cosplay elsewhere and at least next time opt out for the snot colored hair üëçüëå
---
Props to Dwight and Jake, the only good ones
---
Rules: Boot up the game. Play matches. Stamp until you get 5 in a row! Good Luck!
---
it's more annoying than anything, especially if you aren't running whispers. oftentimes i pray that they'll find it first so i don't have to endure a hatch standoff.
---
It's funny browsing /r/new. Every day there's one or two unpopular opinion posts of the plague and it's either she's low tier or she's OP.
---
I played a game earlier and saw a survivor in my lobby with a funny name. So I clicked on it and when his steam profile came up the first thing I saw was his bio said "I DC against Legion". So I swapped from Spirit to Legion
---
I love Fengs perks, so can‚Äôt blame you.
---
To answer your question, "sweat" refers to players who are tryhards, or people will compromise fun (for both others and themselves) in order to do better. They're trying too hard, therefore they're sweating. 
---
i use it TO save an afk survivor. i think you just plop them at the exit, then face the exit and give them the lunge attack
---
I personally just don't like adding insult to injury. If you're guaranteed to escape then either wait at the gate incase someone needs help or just leave but don't taunt the killer and make yourself look like and idiot and make whoever is playing the killer more upset than they probably already are.
---
I just let the survivor have the hatch if they find it. I don't like to linger around the hatch because decent survivors know that this is a common thing killers do.  Instead, I like to find a high e.g. tractor on coldwind maps and scout around the area to find the survivor instead, that way I have an actual chance of killing the survivor than waste hours during hatch standoff 
---
Would be nice if we could nerf some of the op add ons like instasaw, prayer beads, iri head, omegablink, multiple blinks, frank's mixtape, fix moonwalking, nerf nurse and rework moris, but otherwise yeah.
---
camped hooks and just all around seems like an ass "your ego got bruised"
---
So when you‚Äôre being competitive it‚Äôs cool, but the killer wants to do the best he can and he‚Äôs a jerk?
---
Fuck you, you entitled little shit
---
I'm a rank 1 killer so I exclusively slug, but occasionally I'll get a swf group that will DC so that one of them can get the Hatch and it's pretty annoying. 
---
(Brings Mori)
---
(Loads into three man game because some douchey Claudette with a TTV username is too much of a coward)
---
Sigh... I honestly don't know what I expected. 
---
Sigh... I honestly don't know what I expected.
---
But you're not being rewarded for it at all. Getting to rank 1 is actually not that difficult and any decent survivor/killer will get there just by playing the game. I am quite competitive myself but I don't get that satisfaction from this game. 
---
The old system was pathetically easy, as evidenced by how many people are bitching now that they can‚Äôt pip by just doing one aspect of the game repeatedly.
---
NTA yo- sorry wrong subreddit. 
---
Zero-sum does not equal broken. One side wins, one side loses- why should the losing side be rewarded?
---
I get what it's like to be on the receiving end of this, but to be fair, It might've been lag of some kind. Killers often can't actually see that kind of thing happening. From their perspective, they're hitting you. 
---
I never said the killer was a jerk. You made that part up. I have no problem with him wanting to do good. My problem is that the ranking system has caused this game to be a either you get rewarded or you don‚Äôt type of game, there‚Äôs no in between. If both killer &amp; survivor do good only one of them will get rewarded. And that‚Äôs not fair. I want both parties to have fun and be rewarded ( if they deserve it ) so you went a bit overboard with saying, ‚Äú fuck you, you entitled little shit ‚Äú bcuz I‚Äôm not upset at anyone but the devs for making a poor ranking system. 
---
I don't kno what your talking about, that seems really hard  üò§  üò§  üò§ 
---
Get over it. He was doing his job and doesn't have to give up a kill for succeeding at it. Not everyone has to be charitable. Move on to the next match and try again. 
---
This is patently false. Map tiles to loop are one of the biggest issues facing the game, SWF merely amplifies it. Unless your name is Nurse/Billy/Spirit, you're going to have a rough time in chases. 
---
Now, this isn't nearly as much of a problem at lower ranks because the survivors aren't good, but I wouldn't want to base my opinion of the state of balance on shitty players. Optimal survivors have complete control over a game, solo or otherwise.
---
What any good survivor does is try to identify the perks a killer has. If theres an unknown slot then theres a chance that its NOED and you should start breaking dull totems on sight(unless theres 5 gens left)
---
Can confirm, it‚Äôs really annoying and I don‚Äôt understand why it was added. I‚Äôve died to this twice now.
---
There are many reasons why I stay in the game after gates are opened. 
---
One, I'll wait at the exit to force the killer to bait out his NOED if one is at play. 
---
Two, the killer didn't use shitty tactics like camping or tunneling and deserves additional points as a GG. 
---
Three, the killer was camping and tunneling and I'll leave as he approaches but won't let him get the points. 
---
Four, other survivors might need an assist with body block to help them escape. 
---
EDIT: I‚Äôm not mad at the killer for not giving me hatch, by all means, hook me. My problem is even though i did my part plus more, I didn‚Äôt get rewarded bcuz the killer got rewarded. This new ranking system is made to where, if the survivors do good, the killer doesn‚Äôt get rewarded, even though the killer could have still done good. And vice versa. So for all the comments saying, ‚Äú sToP CoMpLaInInG tHaT tHe KiLlEr dIdNt gIvE yoU hAtCh ‚Äú thats not my dilemma. 
---
In my opinion, most survivors have better cosmetics available, but the licensed survivors generally have nice looking cosmetics by default that look even better when P3. Tapp, Bill, and Quentin all look pretty baller when P3.
---
I've seen that before. It's always a double-take. 
---
A very loose term for targeting a specific person. You have *only* ever going after a single survivor, and then you have chasing the survivor that was just unhooked in an attempt to kill them faster. In some cases, chasing the recently unhooked survivor is inefficient because of the map pressure sacrificed.
---
What it boils down to is a killer doing his job in a way that survivors don't find "honorable" or "fair". They then try to place constraints on the killers to bring them "more in line" with what they "feel is right".
---
Not really. Self care doesn‚Äôt effect the killer in any direct way in typically is actually more detrimental to survivors than helpful. Ruin directly affects survivors and just makes the game more tedious and an even larger m1 simulator. 
---
Not exactly comparable. 
---
Without killers there would be no matches! 
---
My reward for getting rank 1 is GETTING rank 1. But with this new ranking system, it‚Äôs near impossible if the killer has a good game. You basically have to get gold in all categories to barely pip. 
---
Killer mains: Camping and tunnelling is an effective strategy.
---
Also killer mains: Survivors are toxic using &lt;insert item name/perk name here&gt;. How dare they try to stay alive!
---
I wonder if they think suddenly there is a huge influx of hackers and not that the queue system is wonky.
---
I'm not sure about never using the fountains, they all get reset if you the survivors use all of them, and you're severely hindering your killing potential without them.
---
Found the child. 
---
The ones I was with were next to where the exit pane was so yeah they weren‚Äôt trying to give the killer extra points they were idiots 
---
WAT
---
Nah, he's a little weak without add-ons but more than serviceable with. 
---
I mean, you get five hatchets at base. Can't I have like 2 or 3 traps and move a little faster when out of stock? (Pleading eyes) 
---
What‚Äôs your opinion on losing? Survivor and killer wise. 
---
Sprint burst and self care would like a word with you
---
Ya either got a sausage or roast beef and I'mma tell ya both can get slippery.
---
This is how Michael punishes himself for tier 3, some alone time in the corner...
---
Yeah self care sure hurts more than it helps lol
---
Ohhh so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing to the p3 Claudette, good to know
---
I typically find the opposite to be true, that said it‚Äôs likely just differing experiences and I don‚Äôt think either side takes higher priority with map offerings. 
---
When you hit them from the front, they do the backflip
---
Please send this screenshot to BHVR and get this person banned. These little crybabies who rant and rave like lunatics in post game need to be purged from the game.
---
That‚Äôs the DBD experience right there!
---
I wanna do that with leatherface.
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy playing games with sound, I‚Äôd rather have a YouTube video or something playing in the background (I know, it‚Äôs weird.) and I would love to have this.
---
Removed, rule 1.
---
They stealth add lots of little things to keep the whining hypocritical killer mains happy.
---
I thought he was gonna vault the window and I could use dead hard so we both wouldn‚Äôt get hit but that didn‚Äôt work out :)
---
Ouch, didn‚Äôt know people actually did that. I‚Äôve never been in a lobby with someone who has.
---
Lol
---
If the screen has frozen completely or the loading progress has stalled in one spot for more than a minute, I do. The latter is an indicator that one survivor won't load in.
---
I'm not playing a 3 survivor match. Tell BHVR to stop being so incompetent and fix the loading screens and you wouldn't have so many survivors leaving.
---
Laurie 
---
Just checking, was that sarcasm or not? It‚Äôs hard to tell sometimes lol
---
Camping *IS* a fair and reasonable strategy.
---
When you block someone on PSN it doesn't let the blocked user know by sending them a message...he went out of his way to message you that. Cringe.
---
Ah, understandable enough I suppose. 
---
Don‚Äôt judge my master ways of playing and saving lives üòÇüòÇ

Getting the 4% means nothing. You got lucky on RNG, so what.
---
I love these dbd meme copies. Its fun recognizing memes with dbd characters.
---
I'll be willing to help tomorrow. Add me @Ripfaith
---
find the comment i posted that starts with ‚Äú EDIT... ‚Äú you‚Äôre like the 15th person who thinks I‚Äôm complaining about getting hooked when thats so much wrong. Lol
---
Should've done a locker cosplay 
---
Really? I thought the map seemed pretty killer sided to be honest. Maybe I‚Äôve not had enough experience with it but honestly the middle area seems like a god spot for killers until the gen has popped. 
---
Being a slug for however many minutes is annoying too. If I know my teammates knows where hatch is or I know there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm getting back up I‚Äôll help out my teammate by disconnecting instead of crawling around bored and useless. 
---
* gotten left behind a few times
---
* killer has a mori
---
* died on first hook even if killer was not camping
---
* gotten sandbagged by a trash meg
---
* teammate hid in a locker it was a claud
---
* hit through a pallet
---
* teammate downed first minute of the game
---
* team runs through every single hag trap
---
* farmed by teammate once
---
* have died while gates were open because "gates are open you're bad if hooked when its open"
---
* gotten slugged by a wraith  who would camp whoever was slugged and he also had noed
---
* hex: ruin a bunch of games
---
* killer had 250+ ping
---
* escaped through hatch
---
* killer was doctor or legion
---
* camping killer
---
* killer has found me first
---
* gotten chased  for 3 - 5 gens\\
---
* hatch standoff 
---
* killer with noed
---
* have gotten morid
---
The judgment has already began 
---
...your teammates went back after powered gates versus a facecamping killer?
---
That sounds like a them problem...
---
Quick question: I have a very mild colourblindness and I have A LOT of trouble seing any red aura's in ormond resort. Other people don't seem to have this problem, maybe you can relate? Or maybe all aura's are shit
---
They just stealth add whatever they feel like.
---
Yeah it's definately all those darn killer mains right. All those darn killer mains in a game where 4/5 players are not the killers.
---
Lol that's a good one haha
---
I‚Äôm offended. I saved his life Therefore it doesn‚Äôt matter 
---
It‚Äôs fucking annoying because unless I have an insta down/ tombstone or even noed I either have to decide if I‚Äôm going to give the survivor a free win or if I‚Äôm going to be petty and wait an hour for them to jump in the hatch.
---
Maybe some killers can figure this out and realize it isn't required then. 
---
That'll be unlikely though. 
---
Just use small game loooooooool 4Head
---
Yeah there was a Feng in a match I played earlier that cknstantly ran around infecting us.
---
The killer left her till last... I mean, why wouldn't you? She's soing half your work for you...
---
Was the most annoying match of my life.
---
That looks like Trisha Paytas!
---
To everyone who hasn't / won't watch it: Yeah, you already know exactly what happens when Legion shows up.
---
The killer is doctor. Ok is that supposed to be bad? Like unless this is impossible skill check doc on the game who gives a shit.
---
As a killer main, I dislike the teabagging, but I appreciate if they let me practice my hatchet throws to knock them over the exit's event horizon. You know if they're dicks or just getting extra BP for everyone.
---
It should allow you to instantly heal someone by one health state after the exit gates have opened.
---
ONCE.
---
I could actually see people using it if it did this.
---
Not pictured? That build is embarrassing, you don't even deserve purple ranks. 
---
It‚Äôs not hard to get a save from doctor
---
I've been conditioned to hate doctor. I play on console, and all my friends and I collectively groan when we face one. He seem to attract the scummiest players on console; NoED users, campers, hostage killers, etc. Always seems to happen with docs fsr. Replace with 5 blink nurse if you're on PC.
---
Ouch.
---
WGLF might've been better for panel 4
---
Same here, also happens in overwatch so it‚Äôs probably the controller
---
That would be super fun, a photo of someone trying to open the locker with somebody already inside would be great! 
---
I hear your pain. We all must suffer the boosted apes of this game.
---
I'd argue he's actually one of the tougher ones since his shock stops you from being able to unhook. 
---
Also the (possible) mechanic where you can grab someone while in treatment. This I haven't actually tested though
---
The lucky ones are the ones who dont get trash killers and teammates
---
It's not the controller though, it's relatively new and it doesn't happen with any other game for me. Just this one, and it's only when running/playing as killer.
---
And it only happens sometimes. I've had full matches where it's been fine. It's only been since the Plague was introduced too.
---
more like replace with legion and plague
---
Plag*
---
They're wankers.
---
I love this idea! I wish more games were accessible in all aspects.
---
I play console too. Doc is a joke to face. Especially because most docs are new players or just bad players. My SWF and I love facing docs because for the most part they are either trash at the game or are farming for BP. 
---
you rite you rite
---
F to trapper
---
(Look behind in chases)
---
And yet it's so easily removed from play. I don't like using it on the grounds that I hate having my perks taken away, but if this emblem change is going to force Survivors to hammer out gens faster than before, I kind of need it.
---
Sometimes this is true. I just hate the giggling bastard. He's not particularly good or difficult to face, but god damn is he annoying.
---
Where do the reports even go in this game? Bcuz the devs aren‚Äôt getting them
---
&gt;It's not like a massive amount of Killers are currently running it
---
I don't think we are playing the same game.
---
If you don‚Äôt have all of the dlcs save your shards to either get a new killer/survivor or wait until a perk from a dlc character is in the sos.
---
Bad rng. 
---
That is very true. But I‚Äôll take the doctor over Legion any day.
---
Rank doesn't matter duud XD
---
It's not about you getting hooked, it's about you unhooking yourself. 
---
Even though Prove Thyself is a very good perk, if you dont have the money for DLC, try to save your shards for it. Even if you can afford DLC, I still reccomend getting the perk the usual way since ALL of Dwight's perks can be useful. Also Iridescent Shards can be used to buy certain cosmetics.
---
Moonwalking breaks chase, thus you're "losing" the chase you had. You're not finishing it by hitting the target a second time. So overall you're getting less Chaser for using the moon walk gimmick. 
---
Dang why so rude buckoüòÇ
---
Another reminder that DBD devs don't give a shit. It sucks but w/e ugh.
---
I feel like legion is worse on console cause of how ez it is to 360 him when he's in his state. Hot tale, I think Legion is legit worse than Fred on console.
---
Dwight's a free character no sense spending shards on a free characters perks.
---
In all my time playing this game I can't recall ever using it. Nor can I really recall anyone using it past rank 15.
---
So yea, it needs a fat buff.
---
Just had the same thing happen to me! Just posted about it too! Makes me not want to play the game anymore! 
---
I don‚Äôt thinks she‚Äôs that easy. She is easily the hardest when it comes to mind games and mentality.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Alright thanks!
---
Yeah thats true, thanks for the advice!
---
Valid point. Some Survivors will find every possible way to bitch and scream in the hopes of justifying their defeat. I've been playing on and off for two years and I've seen every insult in the book. It hurts, but all you can really do is try to be the better person. 
---
How so? 
---
Me vs Myers at 1000 png
---
Look at Pig's little knife.
---
The only feedback devs listen to are the whining minority circling around the toilet bowl that is the 'official' DBD discord. If they want something nerfed or changed, it will be done without any consideration for how this might ruin the game.
---
Can't expect much better from a developer that never learns from their brash decisions, and allows abusive bullies to remain as mods and representatives on their official discussion channels.
---
They'll find any way to justify their defeat nowadays. 
---
If I loop the killer for 10 minutes straight and we‚Äôre still on our fifth gen your damn right I‚Äôm gonna suicide
---
That's also why we have Blood Warden. It teaches them a lesson 
---
I just ignore it and power through gens pretty fast and if I come across the totem I'll pop it. So many people use it that most people by  now have gained enough confidence to ignore it.  
---
Waste of a perk slot really.  Good at low ranks . Terrible at higher ranks.  
---
And you know what? That's fair. Just don't taunt the killer. 
---
Because you're supposed to ignore him and let him get that trap off. After that, you gotta let him run away for at least 5 minutes before you go after him again.
---
Duh.
---
I dunno if you're referring to the PTB emblems, but they slightly tuned it before the patch released. As far as I know, they didn't tweak it anymore. Probably won't until the mid-chapter patch if they plan to.
---
I mean if it‚Äôs endgame then the killer has no other realistic objectives they can play around. If both gates are already open, the killer has literally 0 other objectives to play around at that point in the match. What is the killer supposed to do when there are no gens left, give up?
---
This only needs a fitting background and it would be perfect!
---
Hmmm, big facts
---
inb4 everyone was just 99'ing and they pop all 5 as soon as you hit struggle and don't tap spacebar
---
[heres mine](https://i.imgur.com/b5y7m4e.png)
---
She really isn't. It's stupid easy to force a mind game. By just standing next to a dropped pallet and not doing anything you are playing a mind game you can't possibly lose. With the passive phasing, weird window animations and the way her power works she is a low risk-high reward killer that can literally mind game people on accident.
---
No problem and good luck.
---
How am I the rude one? I made a post about something that happened then got a comment trying to invalidate the fact that it happened. I responded the way I feel I needed to respond that's all their is to it
---
Hillbilly is the only killer I‚Äôd argue that‚Äôs op at least from personal experience(rank 1 billy main). If the chainsaw could have a cooldown/ if you couldn‚Äôt yet across the whole map then I think that‚Äôd help
---
Had a 8 min game last night 3k, last person dc while carrying to hook and they only  got 2 gens. Only safety pip well in to 20k points want to say around 26-27k.
---
I get pips mean nothing.
---
https://imgur.com/a/6M4fCsT
---
Probably cause it's a 'X' amount of meters from another 
---
At least they tried and didn't just crouch in corner of the map.
---
If you don‚Äôt like BP sure.
---
So, I guess those 4 angst teens are one trick Reaper mains in Overwatch.
---
Rank 1 using noed woooow
---
I spotted the 14 year old edgelord ladies and gentlemen. 
---
I thought she just meant that it was fixed and letting you know. Not that she thinks ur lying... but okayü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'm just gonna assume you're bad at surviving. 
---
[removed]
---
Yea. My case is closed bud
---
smh i needed bp fast and i didnt have other perks haha my b
---
Wait, can you one hit down the obsession with rancor at the end? I thought you still had to hit them twice
---
I do want this game to be as user-friendly as it possibly can be, however the two perk examples that you give are advantages of running that perk. Having a user HUD or a heartbeat tracker allows players a free perk space. That gives them an advantage by being able to use a better loadout.
---
If there would be a disadvantage with a heartbeat tracker such as one last perk I think it is beneficial and more balanced. The thing with the two perks mentioned is there is an advantage and disadvantage. I personally don't see a disadvantage to a heartbeat tracker only an advantage.
---
Oh yea case closed bucko :)
---
Same but mines the autohaven maps üôÅ
---
I wish I‚Äôd played back then. I would absolutely SHIT myself if Myers zoomed at me with a chainsaw.
---
u/not_Queen_bhvr 
---
I know that you only respond fast to issue that only concern the killer side but this is actually very important. 
---
If you agree with my assessment, just respond to this comment. 
---
Thanks for agreeing, sad clown
---
Even solo I just constantly get into Asian killer lobbies and have to dodge (I'm in US West) which even if I insta-queue into a lobby means 8 gave to dodge about 10-15 before getting either US West or US East and I've had wait times up to 10 minutes between getting into different lobbies only to find it's an Asian server or they dodge me 
---
That's how I read the logo at first!
---
I almost never play killer with sound, always watching a video that's probably  why I play killer to chill out 
---
Trueee I felt like without them it was too boring though üòÇüò≠ 
---
 British Broadcasting Corporation, duh
---
Just when you think NOED and the killers that use it couldn't be any more crutch you come on here and read something like this.  More buffs to NOED appease the weak baby players who are incapable of getting kills without it.
---
Well duh, you can't expect bhvr to actually fix bugs that prevent people even playing the game normally, they have too many cosmetics to release that you can buy with auric cells !!!!!! 
---
Would rather just try to find the survivor than camp around the hatch. Don't get me wrong, I'll check around the area from time to time but good survivors can and will take advantage of you camping the hatch by just doing a gen to force your hand anyway.
---
Rancor exposes the obsession , so 1 hit
---
I didn't realize this was a thing that is absurd.  The last thing that crutch needs is another buff.  I imagine this is a bug though and not intentional.  Hopefully it gets patched.

Believe it or not I once had someone legitimately rat out their teammate in a locker, but it was actually deserved because this immersed P3 Claudette had farmed and locker juked. 
---
I slugged him and noticed that he was crawling away towards one of the lockers because I was feeling compassionate over the douche move. I opened it, and bam, there she was. 
---
I gave up my 4K by giving him Hatch because truthfully I wasn't gonna condone that. The Claudette knew I was bearing straight down on her and still unhooked him without Borrowed Time. It was very satisfying to be a servant of justice. 
---
After 2,6 Auras on the new Red Forest map and Mount Ormund fade out A LOT with distance from them so that's probably not helping at all
---
Why was that necessary üòÇüòÇ
---
wow so cool üòç
---
yes
---
This makes no sense
---
I don‚Äôt really care when survivors taunt me it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going to ruin my day, you know?
---
LMAO PS4 is on another level.
---
I would have said yes if you had asked five minutes earlier. Now I am turned everything off. 
---
Sure I‚Äôm down. My username is SlyMisterFox if you wanna add me, I‚Äôm a feng main 
---
Always works for me.
---
Just from what I can gather, you seem pretty toxic.  
---
Game balance wise might have never been closer to perfect but I still consider trapper to be shit. I play him with padded Jaws and no ruin/Noed and it's true that you can do well still. However it is really clear that when the team has a tiny bit of luck and pays attention your power is useless. Unless you already managed to kill like 2 of them in which case they can't just go around looking for your traps. He really needs something so that you don't have to go to the other side of the map for your traps(exaggerating I know)/reset traps on the ground (because I have to put down the one in hand, reset, take it back.) and something that makes it harder/longer/riskier to just disable them.
---
Well it's hard to read people on the internet who knows what anyone means. I took the funny in a sort of mocking tone while you took it in more of a "maybe it isnt fixed" kinda way, the only person who knows which one of us is right is the original commenter and they seem to not want to respond.
---
You want us to validate our disliking of a killer that just afk chases people for downs meanwhile you can't bother to spellcheck your own post?
---
It ain't the end of the world jeez
---
I give people the hatch way more than i should as a killer anyway, so i don't really feel any anxiety or frustration, only the frustration of the survivor not finding the hatch after 20 minutes of me hitting the air in its direction from a distance. 
---
"1v1 me bro"
---
Damn okay :/
---
Not bad, not bad at all. I would have simply called it "The Nurse" 
---
Sad thing is 2 kills are reasonable even when you go do gens. Add noed to the mix and you will see why this strategy shouldn't be in the game. (Because who the fuck searches for 5totems when the clock is ticking)
---
Identity V has a visual heart beat on the character. 
---
No. Correct. No.
---
I believe they changed it to make it harder
---
Lol, you can still message me your PSN though. I'm looking for people to play this game too. Maybe another time. 
---
has anyone done the maths for lightborn? 60% resistance resulting in a 0.25 second blind doesn't feel like 60% resistance but the recovery feels maybe right.
---
I‚Äôd say it is because bloodstained clothes actually makes for really good camouflage. 
---
Yes and no, but since you have 2 characters might as well prestige 1 of them for now. I mostly do it for the bloody cosmetics on my fave survivors.
---
If so then it's unbelievably slow lol
---
Two gens and the 4% are nothing. It‚Äôs really easy to get two gens done if your teammates aren‚Äôt complete potatoes and the 4% is RNG. 
---
That sounds like a tiny issue on paper but it‚Äôs so much bigger. The whole franchise is in serious limbo, this could completely shut down all F13 Movies, merch, the game, figures etc. from future production.
---
If there is more than one person, it's pretty much a guaranteed save if it's a doctor. bait the hit or shock and block the person saving. Has always worked for me. Not sure why you're blaming them.
---
Yeah sure :) what's your user? 
---
Git gud 
---
To quote my own review:
---
&gt;Seeing as the only way to get anything through Behavior's thick fucking skull is to review bomb the game: let's review bomb the game.
---
&gt;**REVERT THE FUCKING RANK CHANGES.**
---
&gt;Rank is a fucking joke now. You've got Prestige 3 players going up against people who just installed the game. I just had a match where everyone disconnected because they didn't know how to counter a single perk. (Ruin) After that I had a game where people didn't know how to wake up against Freddy Kruger.
---
&gt;The game is literally unplayable because you have brain-damaged potatoes going up against (Nick Castle.)[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0145309/] Please we wanted rank to matter but instead you just deleted it from the game.
---
In the end, I blame them for going back after powered gates versus a facecamping killer. They didn't know if NOED was in play or that if he would just hook savior 
---
YouTube link if anybody's bothered:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgEVho-WZ3I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgEVho-WZ3I) 
---
Screen shake and a vignette (the darkening around the edges like when people get vomitted on) might also work (although that might make it hard with the vomit vignette too). It seems like since they can already do this when an obsession is being chased this shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult but...
---
I don‚Äôt think he was being sarcastic. While a necessity playing alone, self-care just slows the game down if you have teammates that can heal you at least twice as fast.
---
Yeah üòÇ I only DC if they have Frank's mixtape tho.
---
But females are strong as Hell.
---
I don't understand what is wrong with this image, you just lost to Nurse, big whoop.
---
Does that make it worth ~5 million bloodpoints?
---
Lol I love Dwight's face on this.
---
It‚Äôs come in handy quite often so I‚Äôd say so. 
---
He nailed it. 
---
I've got practicing to do tbh, I can't compete
---
Jeff is loud as all shit
---
Aren't you supposed to only fill in one row? Because I got 10 rows total.
---
aaaa long
---
Yeah they are kinda ruining their game in my eyes 
---
Dbd cosplay is so simple and effective, I love it.
---
I get the Meg and Dwight, but who are the other survivors? I don't think I have those outfits unlocked
---
&gt;When you're brain damaged. ~~(The Nea, I mean.)~~
---
Honestly even with everything wrong with Legion I still think their Mori is amazing.
---
First day worked for me most the time but now it rarely works. Seems to be working just as well as Deliverance did when it went live. 
---
I really like P3 Meh!
---
I was Feng Min and the guy in the back was going for Jake. 
---
Honestly the killers make it work, on our own we're just a bunch of dirty looking people üòÖ
---
I still hate fourman instant blinds. :&lt;
---
god I got so confused whenever that happened
---
It‚Äôs because he is bad but plays alot
---
then don't read cuz it isn't that long
---
also, her "onion" thing never stop bouncing.
---
Couldn't it be possible to make a device that uses the same cord as heads, and have it set to light up based on killer heart beat position, and light up for skill check sounds. I feel like it's a sound cheap idea, give or take.
---
Wow... That's very salty.. I hope players like that actually get banned or at least temporarily suspended..
---
Special Ed kids ride the little bus.
---
Also red colorblind.  Can't see SHIT captain.
---
Ah ok, thanks for explaining!
---
No, you don't need add ons with the build that I run. 
---
The rest of the perks help each other out. The add ins you could use would be the ones that put someone to sleep faster. That way you can beat on them a lot faster. Hex Ruin helps with slowing the game down. As well as taking out air visors and leaving only two able to work on things. I took out 4 people with 4 gens left recent. After the new update. 
---
Reason why I don't play killer often. My internet is fine for the most part, but its super unstable and spikes a lot for whatever reason. I don't understand killers that take enjoyment out of killing lagging survivors tbh Not even a challenge. 
---
Nah, they will just DC as soon as they get downed the first time.
---
Or at least give us an option to change aura colors.
---
Lol welcome to my life 
---
I'm just doing it to deny Iridescent Devout. I found it unfair but Survivor Mains told me us Killers bitch too much so I'm just tryna prove a point now
---
I used to love playing Medic, I‚Äôd hide in the shadows running Empathy, Botany Knowledge, Self-Care, and Pharmacy or We‚Äôll Make It.  I would rush to the basement, nab a medkit, use Empathy to find teammates, Botany Knowledge and Medkit them to safety, and unhook them, being the Queen of Heals.  Back then?  I‚Äôd pip, earn Iridescent Altruism, Iridescent Unbroken, bronze chaser, and gold evader.  I could double pip from being friendly.  Now?  I‚Äôm lucky if I can safety pip from playing Medic.  They killed Altruism, they killed Boldness, they killed the ability to see diversity in everyone, now, you gotta be perfect.  9 hooks is outrageous for killer, because if survivors absolutely suck, you get silver devout.
---
Ah, I see Claudette has freed herself from her mortal body for once.
---
I got hit , DC, i got put on the hook, -RC, i got spotted by killer , DC. These people should just stop playing and relize this isnt COD where u can go in guns blazing... i mean pebbles blazing :)
---
I waant more of this! &lt;3
---
The Entity got tired of waiting and is now warping reality in an attempt to consume the Claudette.
---
10 million bloodpoint reward
---
Very well made meme 20/10
---
That makes sense given how the others work but what about the resistance part?
---
I'd rather have the useless bastard than the teammate that farms you or basically forces the killer to camp you since they run/die around the hook
---
I feel like killers just have it worse than survivors. I've been managing to PIP with survivor, but trying to PIP with killer, especially against bad survivors is frustrating. Like you cant help if they're bad, but you shouldn't be punished for it, if you dont tunnel or camp. 
---
I know I'll get alot of downvotes again cuz everyone saying this system is alright is mentally ill or something but hear me out for a moment:
---
I know devs fucked this game up pretty hard with the new patch and qtimes are even worse than before. They havent patched infinite lobbies and the matchmaking is absolut garbage. Ur randomly getting matched with yellow, white ranks even with being rank 1. BUT i have to admit its NOT that hard to actually pip. Yea its harder then before and if ur teammates fuck up its even worse to actually do something. But lets see it as a chance, cuz now rank 1s are the good players and not ppl with 150 hours who just grinded it cuz u can legit double pip evety game to rank 1 with the old system. (And u can trust me it takes no hours to get to rank 1)  If they were to fix matchmaking so rank 1 plays with rank 1's against Rank 1's  we would be fine again. Cuz now we actually need to "tryhard" to get our pip. If u guys think my arguments are wrong pls tell me ur perspective and stop insta downvoting anyone who thinks the new system is good. 
---
Lol sub to my channel if you want, I'm trying to get more consistent with uploading and editing . Glad you like it though
---
I think the funniest part is I never believe this kind of threat but it was like 2 years ago that someone in Gun Media actually banned a player because he talked shit to 2 Counselors helping a Jason (who was like 10) which helping Jason is bannable and you can play the game if you're under 18
---
But the 2 Jason Helpers legitimately knew someone in Gun Media and the poor sap actually got banned!
---
Just make your username your twitch url. I have a friend who has lots of people, survivor and killer alike, pop in to say hi and be friendly after matches. Its pretty rare to get an actual asshole in the chat.
---
Good editing lmao, also unfortunately that ending always happens to me because I play with immersed fucking survivors that will leave you dead for the objective.
---
Sometimes this game sucks if you aren't SWF
---
Two ways:
---
1. He's not a Killer main, and all his points made by playing Survivor went to Myers.
---
2. He didn't play Killer since last month's rank reset, thus he's rank 20 again.
---
Prestige means nothing though. And thanks to this new queue system, rank also means nothing.
---
üòÇ
---
Have you ever tried playing SWF on PS4? It was definitely necessary
---
Just put Legion in SS and you'll be OK.
---
JK, that is actually a pretty accurate tier list.
---
Lol message the killer and ask if u can live
---
Lmao I wish I could without getting reported üòÇ
---
No controller doesn‚Äôt vibrate.
---
That's just a SWFs (probably)
---
There are extreme phobias for all sorts of things. I'm sorry you have this phobia, but as a horror game they're likely going to touch on just about everything that makes people uncomfortable. There are phobias for both bees and rats.
---
Wow, good job. Looks neat.
---
They were all solo 
---
Just because it isn't the worst thing in the world makes it impossible to be bad?
---
Hey guys getting shot isn't bad if you don't die. I mean it hurts but it's not the worst thing in the world 
---
I always knew the nurse was a nazi
---
After I made that comment he private messaged me a YouTube link with a title suggesting I should kill myself. This sword is all edge folks.  He's too sharp for the sheath.
---
W-What are you gonna do with it?
---
Agreed but they could have chosen something less disgusting imo. Of course there will always be one complainer on everything they make but still.
---
&gt; no one gonna be like "omg she has the head with a slightly lighter lipstick shade" .
---
Lol is that why you buy cosmetics?
---
Lmao
---
Honestly, i dont mind the new emblem system. Out of the 30 ish games i played i only depipped twice. The rest i mantained, except for 2 one pips. However i do understand many people have different playstyles than myself. What i will say is that i have beef with is that wait time bullshit.. Less than 2 minutes for a rank 7, 5, 2, and 4? Yeah.... No.
---
Probably cuz no one likes self advertisers
---
F
---
You mean you wouldn't play Casual Generator Repair Simulator 2019?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
/s
---
They're not, though - as seen with things like the Depip squad (even with no communication and no perks,) high performing survivors who focus on the objective of the game stomp killers.
---
It is really gross yeah. I actually really like the bee idea, but maybe more of like a swarm of flies. Kind of mix the idea of the dark fog and something that spreads disease together. Would have looked really cool.
---
I just think it's lame that Survivors depip from games like this. 
---
There's already no way you can possibly gain any Altruism points without teammates, and the other three Emblems are nearly impossible unless the Killer farms.
---
Yeah, I remember my first time using a key.  It doesn‚Äôt say that once you use it, you automatically jump in, nor does it say that the hatch closes after a certain amount of time.  As such, I ended up looking like the world‚Äôs biggest douchebag as I flung open the hath and left my poor teammates to die on the opposite side of the map.
---
It is a bummer though. Like every game now, constantly deranking.
---
I hope there's an update to remove the retching sounds at least. The lack of audio options in the game is pretty disappointing
---
We‚Äôre all posting these screenshots as if they‚Äôre gonna change anything, it‚Äôs stupid and annoying but we know they‚Äôre just gonna add more stuff to buy
---
I was under the impression that resistance just meant it took longer to blind you. If you are 80% resistant to the flashlight I imagine it takes 80% longer, but I'm not sure exactly what it means to resist the flashlight. 
---
People are having another ‚ÄúLegion‚Äù issue where some are thinking it‚Äôs too easy to use her and not balanced correctly 
---
A simple fix imo for it is it gives a phasing sound but when the spirit is very close to the survivor, giving the survivor the ability to react but little time to do so 
---
Unrealistic....... Dwight isn't in a closet....

---
‚ÄúREEEEEEEE‚Äù
---
I has never worked for me
---
I put one close by so that he doesn't spontaneously combust 
---
It do be like that, It also screws your hatch escape hopes
---
Not nearly as bad as I was expecting the NSFW tag had me worried for a bit.  I legit thought I was about to walk into r/dbdgonewild
---
It is really gross. I think flashlights are bad too - some people easily get migraines. I close my eyes if I see one.  I would like to leave the lobby if someone‚Äôs carrying one, but I try to deal with it.
---
Back to the OP  - I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre the only one. I joined a game with some of my best add ons and offering. Two DCed when they saw the killer. The third committed suicide via hook within a minute. I was almost finished with my second gen when she attacked. I thought she may have pity and at least let me get gen points before hooking me, but instead she chased me vomiting until she had max chase and vomit points (I assume).  I wasn‚Äôt annoyed, but I was sad I wasted my items. And it was just nasty. I hope cosplayers don‚Äôt do her vomit attack - real people would be so disgusting.
---
Would it break these steel bars though? And does it have a keyhole?
---
You set yourself up for it though man.  With all due respect if you still use NOED you have nothing to teach a viewer.  Switch off the crutch and you may find them to be more open to your self promotion.
---
Only way I was able to get it was an OP SWF crew and bit of good luck. Definitely one of the harder ones. Hope you get it soon
---
Okay that's fine, I hope it's found out one day. &lt;3
---
I thought I was alone in this. I can deal with a lot of violence and gore in video games usually. Especially looking forward to Mortal Kombat 11.
---
But the vomiting is harder to deal with for me. I try to convince myself its just acid...which would help me not be bothered by it. But the convulsions make it impossible to keep up that facade.
---
I feel ur pain. Amen
---
I‚Äôve noticed that the trigger for the stun only happens if the killer is DIRECTLY in front of the locker at the frame you press space+shift.
---
The thing is, the animation of jumping out of the locker takes a second, and the stun is applied to the killer at the end of said animation, only if the stun trigger check from before the animation even started was met. 
---
 
---
But even then it‚Äôs wildly inconsistent lol. I suggest moving the stun trigger to the middle or end of be locker jumping out animation and making the user immune to locker grabs because that shit is stupid.
---
Preachhh
---
My only fear is that, with BHVR introducing the ban system on those who quit the game early. I literally can't play against her.
---
This is hilarious lol
---
She's decent. If you can get people Broken and get multiple people down with the Corrupt Purge, then you'll get good momentum out of her. But, naturally, gens getting cranked out will demolish you. And infecting stuff really isn't a deterrent. 
---
I primarily use bbq, ruin, enduring and spirit fury. I sometimes mix it up and use monitor with bamboozle or whispers instead of spirit fury/enduring. 
---
If you‚Äôve played R6 they had an operation called Operation health, which while everyone hated it because we didn‚Äôt get our content that was pressure scheduled and 3 weeks from coming out. But it fixed a lot of major exploits and balanced a lot of ops, 
---
*(They also heavily fucked up the game after but let‚Äôs forget about that)*
---
You‚Äôre a better person than me. I definitely would‚Äôve broken that shit.
---
My basic is:
---
Addons : dead rabbit and judith jornal
---
Perks: monitor and abuse, ruin, bbq, nurses
---
Tatic: EW3 to instadown and EW2 for low terror radius(4 meters) and finding people with nurses
---
That's a lie, Legion was made as an anti-tunnel tool but failed. A failed design.
---
Idk what blood warden does tbh
---
This is exactly what I was thinking. Would be perfect for the hearing impaired, and wouldn't give much of an advantage to the survivors, otherwise. 
---
With how fast generators go, pretty much.
---
Still gets found within 30 seconds and good players actually hit the skill checks for it.
---
I used to use one of the perks that showed you when you looked in the killer's direction. Can't remember what it was called, but it had a cool down on the perk icon, so I would know when it proc'd. Something with a "P" but I can't for the life of me remember what it was called, at the moment. Ended up mostly being a wasted perk slot though, so needless to say, I eventually got rid of it. 
---
Um, how would you get sick AND be in a game with a Legion or Pig?
---
Sickness progresses with every interaction you do running, vaulting etc. If you unhook someone who is max sick you will also get sick. When you reach max sickness (when you have the broken status) you will infect everything pallets, lockers, windows etc. 
---
Premonition. Lol.. 
---
Green keys can't open hatch!
---
Strong when used correctly; I'd put her alongside Michael and Huntress.
---
She requires strategy with her power but also skill with using a 115% default Killer, since spamming her power isn't always the smartest choice. My only critique is how useless the infection mechanic is. It's a nice touch, and how actual plagues work, but as part of her power it's usually useless and sometimes straight up unhelpful.
---
Would swap clown with trapper, otherwise, seems legit
---
I wish I could get to the point where it looks silly to me. It's fine when I do it as survivor (to other survivors), but for some reason when I'm killer it pisses me off. I know that's its goal, but still. 
---
This joke deserves a lot more credit than it should‚Äôve got. I‚Äôm giving u all my claps right now just so you knowüòÇüòÇ
---
This joke deserves so much credit I‚Äôm giving u all my claps right now honestly üòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm proud 
---
two nights ago it would work when killer were 3 to 4 business days away from the locker , after the update they can be right in front and it doesn‚Äôt activate 
---
I'm just here for the clown replies.

---
I don‚Äôt think so - at least not well. I‚Äôm 15 and got a rank 1 doctor and rank 2 nurse. I survived, but I wonder if they pitied me for some reason. It wasn‚Äôt due to talent!
---
Mostly I get out in with people lower ranked than I am, so my guess is most who play this are better than rank 15.
---
Are you serious?
---
Yeah, at this point I'm surprised when it's not there. I have to appreciate it though since Ruin forced me to get good at great skill checks. 
---
I think it's virtually impossible for survivors. For killers it is very easy
---
THIS IS A JOKE.
---
Most of the people I know who are teabagging are just doing it to be silly and not actually taunt or be assholes. So whenever I play killer and someone teabags at me I just laugh about it.
---
Yeah, the wrenching is really what puts me off.
---
If I'm not mistaken, Bo Rai Cho had a lot of puking attacks that never bothered me
---
Never took the time to figure that out, being injured just kinda makes sense to slow you down a bit, but I guess not in this game
---
Bigger question: When are they gonna hump up the penalties for DCing so people that pull this face bans?
---
Why though? You‚Äôre giving them what they want. Sometimes I guess you just can‚Äôt help it? I got annoyed the first time I saw it. My friend was teaching me the game and did it at the exit and I said ‚ÄúYou made Feng look stupid!‚Äù
---
You wouldn't puke all this shit with only 1/3 of a bottle my dude
---
IS IT, MEG?
---
Yes.
---
No they know it's not fair or reasonable they just dont care
---
To me teabagging is a "come and get me" invitation. I won't lie I've tunneled out those who teabag at pallets and spam click their flashlights. 
---
Teabagging sometimes bothers me. I just hate disrespectful play. I can be looped for days and not even care so long as I don't get teabagged at every pallet. I respect good players. Hell I've let some good loopers go cuz they got me good.
---
My advise for exit gate teabagging: just chase them out. They know they are safe. They think they are amazing taunting you at the end. One day a tombstone Myers or NoED will catch them.
---
Lol, ya got me ;)
---
In our defence, it should say enter hatch, just like when you don't have a key, since it's the same animation.
---
yes! you get severely punishes you for chases
---
I was asking if sickness has the same mechanic of being paused while in a chase like deep wounds or rbt 
---
I'm 100% *that* survivor. Camping is never cool, even when the exits are open. 
---
What if... what if OP already tested it!? 
---
The hoe can do it the legit way, ain't that hard
---
You must be kidding 
---
It's a fun game don't get me wrong but this new emblem system is like quick play in Overwatch. It don't matter what you do. I literally had 17,000 k points earlier in a game for yellow ranks and I still didn't pip I was one off and I'm deranking or not ranking for escaping. I think truthfully everybody's gonna be hard stuck in yellow and silver ranks playing with "rank 20s" so it's shite but on the bright side killers fun. Unless the survivors are toxic or gen rush you but what can you do?
---
I'm surprised I've had people agreeing so far. Whenever I brought it up on Steam discussion forums, a bunch of people rage at me saying 'git gud'. It pisses me off because this system has nothing to do with how good a player is. It's more like a points farming simulator.
---
Honestly this seems like a logical change that should have been implemented at the start......I'm probably going to change my mind as soon as I experience this.

Its just bad sportsman ship most of the time, or that's what it seems like. It rubs me the wrong way 
---
It‚Äôs absurd honestly. I‚Äôve played the game correctly. Do gens. Loop the killer. Escape and haven‚Äôt gotten a pip
---
Last two days I‚Äôve been running to people that‚Äôs been on a hook and saving and healing them. 
---
Oh? No one is getting chased. I‚Äôll just look for totems. 
---
I‚Äôve double pipped by never touching a gen. But I got all 5 totems and 5 safe unhooks. 
---

---
Thanks!!!!! I'm the Julie but i love Susie so much she's too cute 
---
I only met nice gamers there at the con, i guess the salty/rude ones don't leave their houses much 
---
I didn't use it very often but Object of Obsession used to be a perk I'd run for fun.
---
When the match starts run in one direction while scanning for the Killer. When you see them look the other direction and run the opposite direction you were running originally (unless that's not possible or it would take you towards them).
---
While doing gens look for the Killer and try to position the generator between yourself and them and never stare at them. While it's not much of an issue since auras act all wonky now, it used to be fairly easy to see Survivor auras through generators.
---
Outside of doing gens just look towards the edge of the map rather than around and keep an ear out for the Terror Radius.
---
I use it on the huntress, it reduces the terror radius to just 12 meters. Since survivors don't usually leave the gen until they hear heartbeat, it really helps catch people. Most just seem to ignore the lullaby. 
---
Editing top notch. I loved the zooms. 
---
It depends on how they view teabagging in each situation, mostly. Teabagging during the match is often a taunt intended to get your attention off something else. Teabagging at the exit gate is different--if you camp or tunnel someone to death banking on NOED to clean up the rest. I'm gonna play paddleball with my nutsack at the exit gate just to piss you off.
---
I think it would be better to have different game modes. Give us something more to do or more options to escape on a map. The linear structure of the game is what leads to that kind of playstyle imo.
---
Some are, some likely aren‚Äôt. Some probably do it because their friends do. I‚Äôve noticed it more in SWF groups. Next time, try to focus on how silly they look doing it, unless anger fuels you and you‚Äôre skilled enough to kill them.

This looks nice, but I feel like the volumetric would look better with some variation. You can use a noise node on the density and a color ramp to control the intensity to give the volumetrics more of a foggy look. I'd also at least make something in the background cause right now it looks like she's just suspended in the air. Maybe just some simple textured walls with some dark lighting.
---
From an hour before you posted this to now(2 hours later) I still haven't found a single game with this "new matchmaking". It's as if nothing changed. Tried solo,duo,quad stacks. Nothing is giving us lobbies. 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs another reason to ignore it - it means I need to focus elsewhere. Like the beckoning gesture - I‚Äôm never going to follow a survivor unless I‚Äôm playing survivor.
---
Okay, not that I do what you mentioned (I did tunnel a Nea once but she was always in my field of view - I left her as soon as I hooked her so someone would save her since I know how it feels to be tunneled.), but what if a killer did all of the above and then seemed to vanish? Would you leave or try to find him/her? How long would you wait? 
---
Bvocslsvvssvsbbdsb sbsblsb a lol p
---
Even at high ranks loops are non issues for most killers if you run them correctly. Myers huntress and clown can all decimate solo teams if you know what you‚Äôre doing without much effort. 
---
Does it make you mad though or more of a ‚Äúhow immature‚Äù reaction?
---
Legacy Dwight is so glorious
---
Camping is giving up lol. Not giving up would be trying to catch survivors on the map. Camping someone to get 500 points when you‚Äôre not gonna pip anyways is just being a cunt and trying to make them depip
---
I'd like a link to this statement.
---
nice l.3 dwight proud to have you general
---
That sounds really obnoxious. Quests need to be more generic, instead of forcing you to play specific survivors/killers
---
Hmm I haven‚Äôt felt any pipping issues tbh, but yeah my matchmaking has been awful. But bugs? Like what? I experienced my first major bug and that was watching the killer from a third person view while hooked but that‚Äôs it.
---
Replace ‚ÄúDance with me‚Äù with ‚ÄúLightweight‚Äù 
---
Noticed this too, I thought I was me not timing it right. Every single time I've been grabbed. No matter what the situation. They need to rework it or fix whatever is going on with locker grabs. They can grab you standing nowhere near the locker. 
---
NoED stands for No One Escapes Death. It's an endgame perk that will make an unlit totem a hex totem once the gates are powered. As long as the totem is active you get a small speed boost and your basic attacks will down survivors in one hit. I personally never use it. I use mostly BP boosting perks. The more bloodpoints the better!
---
As for looping I to loop like crazy. I usually play with a buddy of mine and I'll loop the killer once I max out my other point categories. I don't teabag or anything but I can loop for a good while. 
---
Wait hold on, legion slugs them and they‚Äôre using no mither 
---
Uhhh...am I the only one seeing the problem here? 
---
shouuld be a game mode yesterday 2v8 pls and if it's too unfair, 2v12
---
Huh. I‚Äôve never seen survivors do it to each other like this. I‚Äôve wanted to say thanks so often, but I just try to watch out for them if they‚Äôre hurt or hooked. I wish there was a head nod option for thanks. I‚Äôd feel too silly to T bag. 
---
Eh, try to think of how silly they lookü§™. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense if they‚Äôre female and there‚Äôs no dead body under them.  Maybe it‚Äôs because the behavior is new to me since this is the first time I‚Äôve played with real people behind the screen. I knew it existed, I‚Äôd never really seen it though. I‚Äôd think pointing would be more dignified but still insulting. In real life, pointing is rude, but no one crouches repeatedly, except chimpanzees perhaps?
---
My perks directly counter trash campers, and I have to meet two conditions ( safe unhook and never getting hooked) in order for this to work so yea.. it's earned.
---
If the killers were semi decent they would've hooked me atleast once during the time it takes to do 5 gens... But as with all campers they lack the skill to catch survivors.
---
It's cute cuz it looks like he's pouting.
---

---
This pisses me off especially because I led him on a huge chase while injured, and was about to make this great escape, and then voila 
---
U most likely turned without realizing it
---
5 gum unlocks Evil Within 4 which means chainsaw Myers
---
Also , crutch? I don't need either perk to escape I just like making killers think they got me. 3/4 of those clips I could've dead harded out the gate easily 
---
I feel like it has something to do with the survivor in front of you, you can see her clip by as your going down. This game needs help lol
---
When I‚Äôm playing killer and I see a survivor farm another one, right in front of me. I always kill that survivor instead and all killers should start punishing this BM. 
---
Good point! I just started playing after a long break, I‚Äôm missing the perk, I have a new mission!
---
*Salutes in the closet*
---
Yes officers this post right here
---
Well they are stupid because if you read the emblems (I forget which one it is) it says the survivor that pulls you off the hook actually LOSES points if the rescue is unsafe. But yes this has to stop. It happens every single game for me, someone will see me waiting for the killer to walk away and act like it‚Äôs a race for points. 
---
I honestly don't know, she seems to have pretty poor point generation similar to Pig.
---
Getting good value out of corrupt purge and puking on generators and stuff constantly does help, but then you lack brutality points... And if you don't break people via puking enough you lack deviousness... \*shrug\*
---
Thanks! Killers either camp me or let me go because of it XD It evens out.
---
A killer has two options after they‚Äôve hooked someone, proximity camp or go off running. Give the killer a reason to leave the person hanging or get all the gens done and get out with 3 people instead of getting everyone killed cause you farmed the other 3 and now have no way out.
---
What do you mean?
---
If you don't mind me asking, what is your disability? And I'm still unclear on how a visual aid, that functions the exact same way as the heartbeat, (for the people that can actually hear it) would serve as an unfair advantage? You know that the killer is close, because you can hear him.. But the people that CAN'T hear, are the ones being put at a disadvantage.. To say that being able to see the terror radius, when you are literally unable to hear it is an advantage, is a little ridiculous. Sure, the games based on sound, but there are a lot of people out there that sound isn't an option for. Should we be excluded from playing the game, because of our disabilities? I'm not asking for Christmas lights wrapped around the killer's head, but as somebody stated somewhere, identity v which is a cheap mobile rip off of DVD, features a visual terror radius indicator (your own character's heart beating through their chest) and it hardly gives any advantage.. We're talking accessibility here.. Will people try and abuse it? Sure. But does that mean that it shouldn't exist? Hell no. There are plenty of things that are exploited in every game, and this doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me. Especially when, as stated by multiple people, there are perks that exist that offer visual aid when the killer is near.
---
TLDR: Visual terror radius VS audible terror radius offers no "unfair" advantage, just an equal playing field for those that are unable to hear.

A pip is like making progress through your rank. In [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/qkecVs1) photo, you‚Äôll see that Rank 19 requires 3 pips in order to reach Rank 18. The player already has 2 out of the three pips. 
---
Well...how do you get pips? By playing well and doing objectives. Killer = kill people. Survivor = escape the match. Each match shows your [progress](https://imgur.com/gallery/0V3szqb) once its complete. (Thats an old photo but its relatively still the same concept) If you look at the progress bar, you‚Äôll see a black indent, a white indent, and a red indent.  
---
Black = no pip 
---
White = Single pip 
---
Red = Double pip 
---
You can only get 2 pips max per match. Many factors go into pipping, which can be seen in the emblem system. 
---
Many times after a match, players will automatically hit the ‚Äúleave‚Äù button. If you wait, it‚Äôll automatically take you to the progress/pip page. Or you can get their faster by clicking on the right arrow on the bottom of the screen.

If you're not going to interact, make YouTube videos. It's ok.
---
If u do that then they get a safe hook rescue n get rewarded 
---
I‚Äôll never understand why people go out of their way to send hate mail after a killer gets a 4K. And this is coming from someone who plays 98% as a survivor. Dbd on PS4 is so toxic it‚Äôs unbelievable 
---
They can't even fix the 3 man games you think they have the skills to pull this off?
---
Gross
---
Well, you die faster and can go to another game, instead of hanging on a hook for 2 minutes while others wait for unhook opportunity which never comes. Plus killer might hang farming person, letting you free.
---
Missing the "3 Man game" block
---
You lose points towards a pip, but you still get the BP for it.. Which is why people don't care. Should be more punishing for assholes that screw their teams over.. 
---
But you're doing God's work.. And THAT is the real reward. üòÇ 
---
If only they fixed their game so people didnt have to fuckin alt f4 every other match to play
---
Nah, my friend just got her Quinten one with just one pip same with her Lori 
---
So sexy 
---
But they should realize you get more BP for taking the hit and going on hook then you do if you let your party member get back on a hook.
---
I agree, I don't get it lol. I double pipped that match but damn, I'm not even a try hard.. I'm on survivor 90% of the time! XD 
---
There‚Äôs always some kind of anticipatory annoyance when another survivor is just looping the killer right in front of me while I‚Äôm hooked. Like they obviously botched their rescue attempt and instead of leading the killer away and attempting to lose them and double back they just run in a circle like 20 times right in front of me.
---
I'm playing right now. And yes, I have realized this. U know why? cause it's happened twice in a row so far. Rebooting the game is not fun.
---
I thought even vibration on the controller for the TR would work. The TR could be a heart-beat style and a skill check warning could be just a staccato vibration.
---
Oh dont worry, I dont dabble with SFM porn, yet...
---
I do this but I slug the other survivor first. This way another teammate is occupied healing and you get more bp.
---
That would be cool. 
---
P.S.
---
It's spelled "series".

Yes but they also don‚Äôt get anything else but struggle points until they‚Äôre out of the lobby.

---
I understand wanting to farm but you also need to realize,not everybody gives a shit about that. Some people would kill you just so that the round can be over and both of you can move on to an actual game. 
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
So they actually DID a pretty good job so far
---
I had a shitload of d/c's today. 3 in a row at one point. Had a game the other day where all 3 teammates d/c'd on me.
---
I think I ran into maybe one killer that had any chill. Those matches suck hard.
---
Yeah, fuck that guy for not wanting to waste his time and moving on to a real game.
---
Maybe something that would help is not black pipping survivors when they play immersed since they weren‚Äôt chased enough. In order to pip you HAVE to get chased around or else it‚Äôs almost impossible to pip, let alone double pip.
---
If the killer has the slightest of i teligence its impossible. Plus you still leave scratchmarks blood and even sound if no unbreakeble. Looping is not toxic in any way since you have tools to conbter it. Do you even know how to mindgame in loops?
---
He is dead on though. Killer streamers who are any good don‚Äôt run NOED, unless they are doing some type of asshole killer role play or it‚Äôs a viewer suggested build. It is indeed looked upon as having no skill.
---
Ace and trapper prolly
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt care because you don‚Äôt have a valid argument. You‚Äôre part of the trash tier toxic survivor group that expects a killer to play by every single arbitrary rule.
---
That's a bingo.
---
Ironically,  had you DC'd, he'd be complaining about you. Those matches always suck.
---
Estimater wait times are not accurate at all.

Only on killer you need to do that, survivors still have it easy

Even if it doesn‚Äôt last long it helps give you enough time for a chance to find and hook someone before a gen pops to get the snowball rolling. Intervention does that too of course, but just like ruin once its gone, its gone. They may not be necessary but if you dont run either of them you‚Äôre gonna lose a lot of gens quite early, which is a pickle no killer player wants to be in.
---
Why are there 5 survivors
---
üòÅ
---
Same an hour and a half of waiting for a lobby dodge 
---
You can get a lot of blood points if you are good at looping
---
Yea it's either play solo , play killer, or don't play at all
---
Whats wrong with doctor :(
---
Killers aren‚Äôt obligated to give you anything.
---
That they do, that they very much do my friend.
---
Every killer doesn't run enduring. New ds is good.
---
Also they're probably gonna change this anyway 
---
I got it done in 2 games 
---
Well i understand that but if that's the case why not just d/c? Why make the survivor feel like they have a chance and stay. If it we're me I'd either feel bad and let em have hatch or just d/c myself to spare time. Gonna depip anyway right?
---
That may be true but he was gonna depip anyway, why not just farm a little bit to get a few blood points so it's not a total loss?
---
This is a very self contradictory post, In the first paragraph you say that we agree that Ranks mean nothing, yet then you say the system that means nothing sucks.
---
You also say that nobody is at Rank 1, which is false, A lot ARE.
---
You are also wrong about the Rank system should be about "skill", Skill is not something you can measure, What you CAN measure, is people's ability to progress a match and escape successfully or people's ability to bring survivors to a hook.
---
Oh
---
&gt;... good players like No0b3 who would hit rank 1 because of his skill are literally stuck at rank 4. ...
---
You mean banned players like No0b3?
---
I'm good at juking... Not looping..
---
&gt;survivors still have it easy
---
Ok, sure.
---
Hope you don't run into survivors like me on ps4
---
he's not banned though?
---
That is Tru lol. I just prestiged him tho so he's lvl 1 xD
---
I usually try to let the survivors farm myself but usually they just kill themselves on hook. I‚Äôve gotten to a point of saying you‚Äôre gonna get more bp in the long run just going to a new game asap.
---
Wow, either you‚Äôre incredible or play this a lot (or both:). I‚Äôve heard BBQ is good, but it‚Äôs only for leatherface until it‚Äôs teachable. My problem is the best ones all seem to be teachable or just hope for luck in the shrine. Starting from level P1 level 1, who would you level first?
---
Well in terms of adept achievements, survivors just need to get an escape whereas killers need to get the best possible game result
---
This is 100% not true. If you report someone it flags the game you played and if you email/send a report ticket or if enough reports on the individual come in they will investigate.  
---
If it didn't function then they wouldn't have added the "Give props" feature arbitrarily. It exists to prevent people getting mass reported or falsely reported a bunch of times. As it flags games where you were kind or made a positive impact on someone that could prevent you from receiving consequences for a false report or non-conclusive reports.  
---
I was legitimately banned once because I was mass-reported and was able to appeal in a very short and easy process because of the "give props" report option, showing that they both indeed work and indeed matter.
---
No I never said they should d/c so I wouldn't have to. Nor do I want them to for me, I never said either of those phrases in my comment or my post nor were they even hinted at so idk y u would say them.
---
 But by God I'mma stay and get blood points even if I'm the only survivor. I haven't been playing the game long so I don't have many good teachable perks, I'll take what I can get. 
---
And how did my post come off entitled? I was just a little depressed that I got screwed over and needed a little rant to get it off my chest.
---
And ik it's not fun for the killer, but to be fair it's not necessarily fun for us either especially if we waste a perfectly good item, add on or offering in the process. 
---
And TBH I didn't necessarily WANT the hatch. All I wanted was a few seconds to finish at least one gen and a totem or two.
---
I wish Wraith was better but stealth just doesnt work in this game at all :(
---
Run around trying to sneak up on people and just hearing 3 gens pop at the same time is worst experience
---
I might have, but I'm honestly pretty cool. I'm mainly on survivor so it's possible you might've run into me.
---
Tried 10 times earlier doing everything I could think of and it‚Äôs literally up to the survivors if you get it or not. Might try this later as it‚Äôs the last achievement I need. 
---
If done well I would watch it.
---
But it would have to be a based on game as the game has lots of lore and characters making them into a week after week story would be tricky. Because just watching a live action trial each seek would get boring.
---
Maybe instead of trials they could just be in the realm of the entity and things could be weird and they could through their adventures each week run into different killer or killers and locations as they unraveled the mystery of where they are and why. However making the killers scary or interesting would be tricky because in a show it would be boring "ohh dwight got sacrificed he will be back shortly"
---
Just some thoughts but I'm not very creative.
---
That's really awesome, it almost looks like she's trying to get that last little bit into the exit!
---
And he was running the lock of hair that tremendously increased the amount needed for evil within three so he was never going to get enough to even be able to Judith us 
---
Ooooooooh believe me.. I blame BHVR for a loooooot of stuff wrong with this game. Hot boxes, broken killers, perks, matchmaking, ranking, etc... If they keep going the route they are headed in I wouldn't be surprised if half of the community left. They never listen to the community.
---
It seems like the higher the rank iam the more campers/tunneling I encounter. Im rank 7 atm.

It is scary! I'm a female gamer so I keep my messages blocked for safety. Now after that match I have friend requests blocked.. its sad. One time I did a SWF with some randoms and one guy kept mentioning that my voice is nice. I'm in my 30's and my husband plays too, and my husband was in the chat! I won't do SWF ever again! People are freaking weird....
---
Im going to take higher ranks like as closer to 1. Thats how they get there by tunneling people and face camping because they suck ass at the gane and thats the only way they get kills, i play killer a lot but ive never dipped down this low no matter what and whenever i play survivor it pisses me off to go up against peices of shits like this
---
Bonus pick of the [clay render of The Clown](https://imgur.com/6LCUjpO). Pretty weird seeing him without the makeup.

Here's a link to the artist's [Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/VGErP) account.

We can‚Äôt get a lobby with 2,3, or 4 people! How is it you have 4 survivors ready to go and you can‚Äôt find a single match! 
---
he probably got unbanned
---
A gentleman
---
When you asked why they wouldn't just d/c it came off to me as you were trying to put that responsibility on them.
---
Like I said to me personally it just seemed a little entitled because your complaining what you wanted and what the killer didn't let you have.
---
I get the being upset I get frustrated too especially recently... getting a lobby every 5 minutes just for it to be 200+ ping and if I go in similar to what happened to you happens to me, or the game is so laggy its just try and do a gen or 2 and wait for death.
---
As a killer I get lobbies somewhat faster but half the people leave because the people I get my ping is high to them and then lobby breaks and when we do load a game someone d/c or doesn't load in. I think I get 1 good match out of 5  as killer or survivor.
---
But if the killer farms great if he just wants me dead asap so we can both move on great.
---
My anger is at BHVR. This kind of stuff will make players quit and not come back.
---
Personally I've been grabbing my extra daily xp and doing my daily and then playing other games.
---
Survivor is fucked up completely but killer only needs minor tweaks to some edge cases where you win too hard and therefore lose. Killer overall is just fine and i pip most games.
---
There is nodding option - just move your camera up and down, looks kinda funny and can't be perceived wrong way like teabagging
---
I understand your frustration for sure, even without having this phobia. Its not even being vomited on that kinda squicks me out, its watching and hearing my character running around and throwing up uncontrollably. They really went for the gross out factor with The Plague
---
What‚Äôs the pocky challenge? I have no damn clue lmao sry 
---
This has been common knowledge for a while have you been living under a rock?
---
Joey's outfit is sick. Kid's got a good sense of fashion, but I'm a big fan of The Legion itself, reminds me of Slenderverse :)
---
And wouldn't actually hurt either way as a toggleable effect.
---
How to get tunneled 101
---
Even if face camped, you‚Äôre giving allies three free minutes plus struggle points to yourself. I was face camped and slashed the entire time for three trials in a row last night.  
---
Yeah... perhaps...
---
Since Meg is like the shark from the meg movie then David can play Jason statham lol
---
Kinda scary 
---
Recently bought plague, and I feel like she has a lot of things to micromanage for my liking, but she can be very fun to play as and overwhelming for survivors., which is good.
---
Why does he have a penis coming out of his chest at attention?
---
True, dbd is fun but the devs insist on making it hard for us to get to the fun part.
---
Ah but tyde is unreliable as he‚Äôs opinions have flaws and he said Leatherface is B TEIR can‚Äôt trust him.
---
survivor mains: it is toxic and should be bannable for camping and tunneling 
---
also survivor mains: **no gens done, all trying to come and save survivor on hook at the same time and complain about camping** killer mains are toxic using &lt;insert addon/perk name here&gt;. how dare they try and kill!
---
you should honestly play both and learn how to think on the other side. 
---
Don't forget the fact that even after you load in a lobby it's pretty often and common that you'll get matched with someone that far outranks both you and a majority of your teammates. As a rank 3 killer I had matches against rank 8s, 11, and even had a 15 in a few of my lobbies (not enough to call it a gigantic problem, but enough for it to not be negligible).
---
Ikr how dare they not follow the unspoken rules! No hatch = -rep
---
Real shame he got his shirt on...
---
Lol your fine. If u don't know what a pocky is it's a little cookie stick. Ik in Japan and in anime u see teenagers and rarely adults when they wanna be cute lol, put one end of the pocky in each of their mouths and the slowly take nibbles toward the center, first one that moves away before they lock lips loses, if neither backs away they get rewarded with a kiss. If you go to YouTube u can see a lot of cute videos of it lol.
---
No problems at all here
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, a perk should be at least somewhat useful but ds is just a wasted perk slot
---
just get totems my guy 
---
I thank you for your efforts, but it wasn't what I was expecting and it's a little off. I was expecting at least sounds to be added to it too.
---
You realize he was trying to take you to the hatch multiple times right? And why in the world would you camp shack pallet lol
---
Ok, thanks for explaining :)
---
And to answer your question, survivor would probably be Feng Min and killer either Susie or Sally (The Nurse)
---
Iirc a few perks are bugged rn(survivor ones), and most of the other "bugs" i'm talking about are more about connection. A LOT of games just lose people as soon as you load in, and people playing with SWF are having really bad lobby problems(host doesn't get added to the lobby, can never find matches, etc). Also, survivors can vault over windows even when they appear blocked on the killer side sometimes(experienced this myself), and I don't know about you, but almost every game I go in as a survivor has 150+ ping now. I don't think i've seen a single green ping game yet as a survivor :(
---
When bhvr hates you
---
I do play both. I never refuted that survivors act the same way. But by all means keep assuming through your blind rage.
---
that's why it's his opinion. it isn't facts. and if you saw the video he said that leather face wasn't good, he said his perks were good. bbq is the best perk in the game rn, and his chainsaw being 1 hit puts him higher. like billy. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt know about the evil incarnate achievement? He has to use those two add-ons AND kill everyone in the match, so have a little sympathy. It can be pretty hard for some people and finding those two add-ons again can take some time.
---
Every killer from tier B and lower will camp so they are automatic DC's.
---
:) 
---
I feel like there‚Äôs already a doctor so Frankenstein would be kinda pointless. Although you might be thinking of the monster, in which case it would be kinda nice, and relatively easy law-wise since it‚Äôs been long enough that people can‚Äôt hold copyright on the original creation anymore
---
With no pallets in sight, he relies on a different piece of wood. Dwight starring in: Dicked by daylight 
---
Plenty of reasons, actually.
---
 The main one is that it's nobody's job on here to listen to any complaints, or to take the time to show support for an upset stranger over their bad experience with a video game.
---
It's not that serious, honestly. This kind of behavior predates Reddit by over a decade, too, so it's not at all like this is new.
---
Won't be necessarily tryhards that would use it. I'd use it because it would make my games easier and it's not try as hard.
---
i only play survivor and it‚Äôs part of the game you know, gotta always watch out for it. I get annoyed when it gets me but I can‚Äôt really complain 
---
I mean the community argued if it was clickbait or not 
---
They should close the hole after the pallet
---
It's good, but you can get it by leveling up dwight for free.
---
I'd save shards for buying killers, or at least harder to optain skills.
---
Just got Adept Legion in green ranks, I would think this one would be more doable. 
---
Gotcha, thank you Kr4ndom :) I'll be deleting my post 
---
Immersed gameplay is incredibly boring for both sides, hard no. The best part of DBD is the chase.

---
I mean I don't think anyone washes their hands in the fog so I'm sure they're bound to get sick sometimes.
---
Happy cake day
---
Its the easiest way to win a game, it's sad but the game rewards tunneling and camping and punishes 3 hooking every survivor. 
---
It didn't use to be a problem at first because the survivors didn't realise windows weren't actually blocked, but now, more survivors seem to realise that windows aren't actually blocked and they keep vaulting the same window
---
Might have been the fact it was wedged between the tree and truck, but I wasn‚Äôt able to use this Fountain.
---
Since the Killer only cleansed one Fountain at time and the rest were full, 3 of us just had to deal with being sick the rest of the game.
---
If the Killer sits in proximity too long, it should close, disappear, and reappear somewhere else.
---
20% of matches that they ever played in DBD? 
---
What the fuck? That sounds crazy and I wish I had been there. 
---
It says a lot about how the game is coded. Very odd. Killer powers are technically "items" that can be picked up and dropped? Killers and survivors being even able to use the same perks/items suggests that they arent fundamentally different. 
---
Whoever comes down there now gave him 2 free Kills.
---
Nobody smart enough would go down, so usually after those 2 basement Kills the rest is easy because you only had 2 people doing Gens meanwhile, so you might still have 2-3 left and only 2 people to maintain over.
---
It‚Äôs a cheap annoying tactic but it works for some people obviously. There‚Äôs no rule against it so you just dice-roll whether or not you fight a Killer using a gimmick/cheese move.
---
Legion ruined this otherwise amazing cosplay.

NOED still pops if you're hit with a Feral Frenzy attack by Legion. 
---
He probably knows you have Head on. He will stalk you until the end of the universe, and then beyond.
---
Uumm... What? You know as a Survivor the hatch is entirely in your favor right? If you as a Survivor find it first, well just hop in and leave. If the Killer finds it first and camps it, just go do a generator. Chances are when it pops the Killer will leave the hatch to check around the generator. If they are 100% commented to camping it, just finish the rest of the generators and force the Killer into having to scout 3 separate exits. If the Killer isn't camping it then just hop in when they aren't looking. The hatch needs to be reworked into the Killers favor, not the Survivors.
---
A fan of totems and "exposed" are we?
---
They changed them. You have to actually double pip now. Pretty stupid.
---
Legion is a pretty satisfying challenge if you play them "honestly" and try to use your power to split pressure and keep everyone healing or downed. However, doing this does feel like playing the game with a handicap, you just have to work hard. The other issue is that Legion is basically broken if you cheese their mechanics, as others have said. 
---
Potentially could be options you could turn off/on in accessibility settings.
---
What does mending have to do with the pools there 2 different killer effects
---
Oh good, I was already having a bastard of a time with wraith.
---
I wonder how long that's going to last
---
Just happened to me, someone got hooked, nearly 80% done on a gen. I'm thinking, okay, just get this done, by that time the killer is long gone and I can safely unhook them.
---
*Hear the entity carrying their soul away.*
---
"Welp..."
---
I mean I'll try to get that person off the hook no matter what once they get close to staging. Better to have a trade at that point if they would stage 2 / die anyways
---
Instead of just 4 kills you NEED to double pop now. And since they have made double pipping harder...
---
***DISCONNECT BUTTON EXISTS***
---
Turns out the Dwight isn't actually part of the cosplay, he just works there lol
---
Some people just can't appreciate shocky boi
---
People were complaining about deranking so devs made ranks meaningless
---
Borrowed Time also triggers with Deep Wounds/Mending.
---
Yes 
---
I hate playing against Legion because they‚Äôre basically just a healing simulator. They poke you with their knife and often go poke someone else so then you have to go to mend and heal. And if they run Sloppy Butcher (like 90% of them do), you‚Äôre spending half of your match just healing it seems. It‚Äôs not very fun and I don‚Äôt get intimidated by their power or anything, unlike other killers.

That's exactly what I thought too.
---
I wish more people would realize this 
---
She has great design, and is fun to with/against. She is the most balanced killer in a long time and can be quiet good in the right hands. I'd put her next to Michael/Huntress.
---
There is nothing wrong with camping after gens are done and exits are open.
---
Mend the borrow time n then clean at a pool I don't get what the point of the question was of course u would want to clear the borrow time before going down if not ur going down u don't go down from being sick 
---
Am I the only one getting the endless ‚ÄúBot‚Äù Killers?
---
They just stand in place and randomly M1 or M2 in a set pattern.  I‚Äôve been getting them consistently and it really kills the game for me.
---
He's asking if the pool would heal both the sickness and Deep Wounds.
---
I'm simply clarifying that since your reply sounded like you thought it was impossible to have both effects.
---
Well, it's needed for an achievement and you can still pull it off with good map rng/ a few not so smart survivors / play with your food.
---
The mori was absolutely pointless tho lol
---
Anyone who bashes accessibility features is a waste of life. I love to kill people in PVP amd troll alot too  ut that is crossing a line. If someone has a disability they shoukd have a fair shot to enjoy a game like anyone else. Wtf is wrong with people
---
This also happened to me on PS4 the other night. Couldn't do squat against the Michael we were up against.
---
r/DBDGoneWild
---
They are the sort that will complain the killer was camping later in the lobby.
---
I know there are options on PC with NVIDIA where you can alternate the in-game filters. Don't know about console 
---
Scumbag
---
I agree
---
It be like that sometimes 
---
Mood
---
Very cool OP, very cool.
---
They are BFF 
---
I'm curious too
---
I find it ironic that it's 5+ minutes for killer but -1 minutes for survivors :/ 
---
That's fair but you could say the same for Leatherface or Hillbilly. If they find you in an open space you get instantly downed. Faster than being vomited on then hit.
---
In the next few weeks, you will find players not playing her as much. Eventually, killer diversity will return so you won't have to deal with her in the majority of your games. 
---
I've had a game where a totem spawned in this exact place and it was impossible to cleanse it
---
I fail to see the issue.
---
Imo 98% of opinions are bad
---
Not what they are saying, but okay.
---
Well you have to remember this is a very killer sided reddit. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone can think survivors are OP when killers are faster, have perks to see where everyone is, can mori you after your first hook and of course NOED. Funnily enough, I‚Äôm not even complaining about any of this, but it‚Äôs just wild that they really think they‚Äôre weaker and survivors have any power over the situation. ü§î
---
It all really just comes down to whether the killer knows what they‚Äôre doing. People claim playing killer on PS4 is complete garbage, but I‚Äôve been destroyed by every killer before(by destroyed I mean they got a 4K), because the people playing them knew what they were doing. 
---
As a survivor i couldn‚Äôt care less if I die usually. As long as I had a good chase or had the chance to sacrifice myself to save someone else im happy.
---
Sarcasm.
---
I think that's unrealistic. It could never be implemented because it's too deep and punishing. I think all that can really be done is small changes like this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b4u5fb/buffing\_survivor\_perks\_against\_facecampers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b4u5fb/buffing_survivor_perks_against_facecampers/)
---
And i'm an idiot for coming here as I read the title as "The Shape talks"
---
Are....are we not already at that point?
---
I'm finding the same problem. My survivor matches are ok, we are all about the same rank, but as soon as I play killer, I'm put into lobbies with people way out of my league. I'm a rank 17, and the closest I ever seem to get to my rank is a 15, and that's if I get really lucky. I've had games where the survivors have all been rank 10 or above. Its not fair on the anyone of they can't even seem to match people who are anywhere close in ability anymore...
---
I had no idea those windows existed. Gotta start looking up more.
---
Gotta protect that broken key at all costs. 
---
don't cleanse yourself and she won't be spitting red goo
---
I'm just saying, don't complain when mad cuz bad
---
ok
---
Haven't had much problems since upgrading my processor. Anyways, most games are still fine for me tbh. Maybe 1/10 1/12 games someone doesn't load in.. haven't really had killers leaving lobbies. Survivors leaving could be because of killers connection.
---
Borrowed time is that the way it is now, it's incredibly powerful for the end game &amp; a great perk for risky saves. It's like a self-sacrifice perk were you save someone &amp; if your full health you take a hit for them. 
---
Not being able to hurt the rescuer means that survivors effectively guarantee a safe unhook even if the killer is right behind them. This would make end game hooking a joke as being saved would allow both the rescuee &amp; rescuer to run out of an exit gate because they are both protected. Would be good for face camping but outside of it, end game unhooking &amp; normal gameplay will suffer from basically free hook escapes. It would also encourage the tunneling of the rescued survivor if the rescuer had BT activate on them. Why would a killer bother to chase after the rescuing survivor when the unhooked survivor doesn't have BT activated on them.
---
I do approve of the spine chill change but even then 10% adds an extra 5 seconds between hook states &amp; doesn't account for the killer just slightly looking away from the hook, nullifying the effect.
---
I feel like it should be an effect on kindred. Maybe slow the progression of the hook if the killer is within the 16m radius of a hooked survivor &amp; not in a chase.
---
ill take a legion over a nurse / prayer beads spirit
---
I would add: Being chased for 3+ minutes and no gens are done.
---
Make the perk more consistent first
---
Yeah I've noticed that too. I really don't understand - there are way more survivor mains than killer mains. As a killer main, this queue time is really killing my experience.
---
I know thats a thing but playing broken whole match isn‚Äôt that good. This bitch is pretty goddamn fast and considering bloodlust/exhaustion perks nerf most of the chases will end pretty shorlty :\
---
It‚Äôs their fault because they know they have crap internet and they know it won‚Äôt affect them. They continue playing hard, thinking they did a good job when in reality everyone was teleporting around and couldn‚Äôt do shit. If they‚Äôre okay with that five, but let‚Äôs not act like it isn‚Äôt the host‚Äôs fault as well. 
---
He is crap, I don't get why people think he's strong or something.
---
I can't believe so many people think looping is a valid strategy. Disgusting.
---
She's...OK. 
---
Visually, backstory and concept wise, The Plague is my second favorite only to The Spirit and I like the idea behind how you're supposed to play as her with the infection and corruption mechanic juggling. The problem is the changes they made to her since the PTB have really hurt how effective she can be. The Plague had the potential to be a top tier Killer, one that wasn't super reliant on practicing her mechanics for hundreds of hours to do well with her. 
---
I'm not the best at this game. I mostly play Survivor and The Spirit used to be the only Killer I liked playing because of her art design and unique power. It took a very long time to be somewhat decent with her and, even then with all of the strengths The Spirit's power has in avoiding loops and mind-gaming, I still usually average only two kills a game and that's only if I play really well. Honestly, there hasn't been a strong Killer in the game that isn't like that before, since the devs seem to think that a Killer that's considered even partially strong needs to be really difficult to use. 
---
The Plague was fantastic in the PTB and a welcome change to that idea. The aiming of her bile stream took a little bit of getting used to because of the lag in its arc, as did the timing on when to use her corruption and what to infect, earning her that Intermediate difficulty level. But the ability to hinder the game with her infection was really strong because she could actually *keep up* holding that power with her speed, even if she was easy to see because of her height. Getting multiple Survivors sick and giving yourself multiple sources of corruption felt great to earn.
---
Yet she never felt oppressive or unfun to go against either and *that* was the most important thing about her. As powerful as her sickness was in all the ways that you could get infected from the environment and interactions, the delay of it if you weren't fully infected and the fountain's instaheal made it totally manageable, while adding the fun risk of letting her damage you in exchange. Plus, you could usually try for a few loops and jukes that would allow an escape if you played decently. She felt fair to play against *as well* as fun to play as, which is the whole point.
---
But, naturally, we can't have that. Some loud voices in the community must've complained enough that a strong Killer that doesn't have Nurse levels of difficulty isn't allowed. So, rather than risk another Legion situation, they nerfed her movement speeds for holding her power while tweaking some numbers elsewhere to try and balance it, but this has to led to her being like most of the other Killers in the game now. 
---
You can't use your power without it slowing you down hard enough to miss with her bile or allow chase escapes, which means you can easily get looped for much longer trying to infect people. If by some chance you do hit them, the time it takes to do so stops you from putting pressure on the other Survivors which allows them to complete gens unimpeded. The sickness you give them can get removed quickly and has little chance of spreading as a side effect too.  It's so much more difficult to infect Survivors now because of the slowed speed and cooldown between Purges that sometimes the better tactic is not to use her power at all to hurt them, which also means you're not getting Corrupt Purge because no-one's using the fountains. 
---
While playing *as* the Killer has become much harder, playing *against* the live version of The Plague feels easier than the PTB because getting away from her is simpler unless you make stupid mistakes. I've escaped from almost every single game against her with little effort because she can't apply that pressure of infection as consistently as she used to. She went from being strong in the right hands to being only strong if you're against bad Survivors making bad choices.
---
Maybe I'm just bad at playing her like other things in this game, but I have been playing as The Plague as the only Killer since she came out even with her strongest add-ons and I still get more success with The Spirit even though she is conceptually harder to use in every regard. I hope they reverse these changes. If nothing else, at least change the movement back to what it was when she has Vile Purge and keep it as it is now when it's Corrupt since it does damage (and to make it consistent with the Huntress). 
---
Right now, The Plague has a fantastic art design and concept, but she's much weaker than she feels she should be.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you just dodge the room? If you could see all their pings. Maybe they saw low ping like you did? I doubt any of them are worried about you getting kills, but more about the fact that the lag doesn‚Äôt affect your gameplay like it does theirs.

The pig cannot carry people to the exit gate for their head to pop. Stops her from instantly killing survivors at the end game. 
---
Omg I'm gonna try that tonight when I play! I had no idea! Thanks!
---
Run borrowed time. Let the killer hit you then unhook your teammate.
---
Do you wanna play a game? 
---
i only scummed that one. lol. plus i got a merciless victory as her before they fixed it, so it didn't count
---
Would you rather play against mixtape legion tho
---
Hmm, I think you didn't get it. I'm not talking about BT working for both the rescuer and rescued, I'm talking about it triggering for you when you're both, when you're getting yourself off the hook because you're being facecamped and no one's coming.
---
I suggested 10 % for Spine Chill just to keep it in line with the previous value in the perk. It could be something else. And if the killer looks away from the hook it's still helping because there's a bit more room for people to come and rescue. But still, I'm talking strictly about facecamping.
---
Another change to Kindred would be cool too.
---
haha i was exactly in the same boat yesterday and today! it's great to be done with it

So many jumpscares especially using Nurses lol

Nah, I'm good. The point gen for survivors sucks so I will gladly fuck over my own rank with unsafe rescues to get more BP. It isn't like I know the survivor personally anyway. 
---
lol no matter how annoying a survivor is, i always just hook them and walk away. in the end, taking the high road actually feels better than trying to ensure they die
---
Yes
---
Less survivors playing for a multitude of reasons. 
---
As of right now, there are 18,500 players online for PC. There should be no reason for me to have a  5 minute queue time. The numbers are pretty much the same just 10% lower on average. They did something to the matchmaking/ranking queue to make it longer and more tedious. Idk why they think that a queue is a good idea considering the aforementioned problems that you discussed. Bad piled on bad just causes more people to quit. 
---
lol! at least it isnt about myers. peoples' obsession with him is annoying
---
No you dont
---
Hey at least she can't hit you twice in one corrupt purge
---
Why throw a random apostrophe in a word just because you see it ends with 's'? 
---
Trust me I do
---
It may not be efficient, but I had fun with No Mither, Resilience, Iron Will and Urban Evasion.
---
But it doesn‚Äôt matter since cooldown is literally nonexistent
---
Yeah the rancor should‚Äôve just left. That‚Äôs their own fault ü§£ 
---
Play survivor. Since so many survivors have stopped playing its super fast. 
---
Where does the Plague pull out a fucking gun? You are acting like she is on nurse level or shit. Literally just becomes a M1 killer when she breaks you and still chases you. How is that op?
---
Just get better at dodging it and/or hiding when you hear her coming and KNOW she has corrupt purge
---
Yeah I agree, it's fun to play every so often. 
---
You're probably right in that aspect, but I've had so many games where they facecamp the first person they hook. It's usually at low rank and I think inexperienced killers don't realise they lose BP or that they lose the game if they only get one kill. I think it needs to be made more obvious that the idea is to hook as many people as possible
---
I actually get these comments and racist slurs thrown at me very often.
---
It's sad how toxic this community is
---
He was giving you hatch and you wasted god pallet
---
When she collects purge from the fountain
---
Me too, other than going on for dailies now and again. The devs need to sort their game out. Maybe they're trying to get everyone to play Deathgarden.
---
Had this happen to me twice yesterday, both were Michaels. Second one had an ebony mori but only used it on Claudette before we all escaped.
---
It's not her last name, it's still her first name because it comes first, but it's her family name and not her given name. 
---
That's another argument it still doesn't change the fact that it's hardly fair for a player with a common perk be matched against a player with 4 exceedingly rare perks that make gameplay next to impossible for the low level player.
---
Perhaps to combat both issues they should remove the grind out of the game and make blood points easier to get or half the amount of blood points required to level up a character?
---
Hi, I'm Feng Min. Welcome to Ba Sing Se. 
---
I play a more than average amount of games and hardly run into assholes with or without voice comms.
---
But chances are them flicking their light and tbagging they are saying "haha bitch get fucked" or "bby killr follow me ez loops". Hear it occasionally when I decide to watch a streamers VOD to see what was going on that match.
---
I normally ignore those players to chase their weaker buddies so I can have an easier time getting them later in the match.
---
That bag is so last season
---
Cause it is. It is the best way for a survivor to SURVIVE the chase with a killer, or at least extend the TIME so their TEAM can get some GEN PROGRESSION before you go down and the killer goes to them.
---
Looping is in no way toxic its a survivors best tool for survival that shows how much skill the survivor has as well. If you cant beat them cause of this it is simbly because they are better than you by a good amount
---
I do that sometimes when i'm farming BPs with "we're gonna live forever" but i always have BT on.
---
Hey now.
---
We got legion perks while you got thiccman perks.

But i agree, atleast make them work 100%

You remove the exhaustion, and it becomes too good/annoying. You keep the exhaustion, and it‚Äôs borderline useless.

You don't need noed with spirit, unless you're really bad. She's a strong killer and it's a shame to see players run noed with her.

I‚Äôve never had big problems with this game. I‚Äôve had the obvious questionable hit through a window but never anything too ‚Äúwhat in the fuck is going on‚Äù sort of problem. Matchmaking feels fine to me, I haven‚Äôt encountered most, if not any bugs.
---
Couldn't be truer... although I feel a lot of communities are like this, especially those with sorta... cult? followings.
---
Can i please hear some "Bug free and balanced" games?
---
Legit can't think of any game that is 100% balanced and bug free
---
That ending üòÇ
---
Some things are exaggerated for sure, like the legion thing or the noed situation.
---
But getting into 3 man games happens all the time for me, and if i get into a 4 man there is a 50% chance of an early DC.
---
Same probability for toxicity when i play as killer. Yesterday one guy raged because i was using BBQ as leatherface and another that i was using the basement hooks.
---
Best noed counter 
---
Yes!  ‚ò∫
---
So make it a free stun with 0 downsides on demand, seems balanced to me. 
---
Just keep reporting the ones that DC early. 
---
that, would be a horrifying location for a totem
---
A bit of skin? r/DBDgonewild
---
fuck outta here with this survivor propaganda
---
In some deadzones or loops with small walls, yeah it's bull, but if you are half competent you will make your way on a loop with high walls, taking sharp turns to make her miss since her puke does not follow her 100% when she turns. Force her to m1 you and run, and if she catches you eventually, well that is part of the game, any killer spending time chasing you will get you eventually, your objective is mostly to waste time.
---
No, the perk is pathetically weak even without exhaustion. It requires 3 seconds to get used.
---
It's garbage.
---
You can't use it in a chase and running is better than hoping that you will get a stun.
---
The perk is garbage. Hot garbage.
---
Indeed, don't have to worry about exposed if your always downed in one hit
---
Survivor mains: wow he's running noed fuck this sweaty killer
---
Also survivor mains: *on discord giving teammates information that would be impossible for them to have otherwise*
---
Only way to pip up these days though
---
Wouldn't it be easier to chase them out and move to the next game
---
Yea most people do because it‚Äôs considered a BM. This is DBD‚Äôs version of the middle finger. Same as a killer spamming M1 on a survivor on the hook.
---
Okay, I'm one of the peopke who ragequit but hear me out on this one....
---
I'm a rank 1 survivor, and I play on rank 12-15s... it is SO frustrating... and not even exaggerating this but, IT IS SO FRUSTRATING when you run the killer around for 5 mins... 5 solid minutes and see NO GEN DONE.
---
Why you ask?
---
It's because survivors on those rank think generators are impossible to do whenever there is a Hex: Ruin active....
---
And then what happens next...?
---
The killer just facecamps and the survivors just stare at me crouched until I die...
---
I like it that you have to adjust your playstyle to certain killers ^_^
---
That is very true and well we cant have a team set on pause, unless that could still help patchibg bugs and everything. Plud people care more about content at time than the gameplay it self
---
It's still a little early for details, but IMO if you have good map awareness, including knowing how to funnel sick survivors to fountains, then she's easily one of the strongest killers. I'd like her to get some adjustments here and there, but she's not game breaking. Maybe make it take longer for the broken effect to build over time, and hasten how fast the damage puke power disappears.
---
Out of the last four killers this wave I find her the most mechanically interesting, even if I have more fun against Spirits.
---
Every other match rn as survivor or killer has been and infinite loading screen from me. I end up having to reload steam because for some reason stopping DBD in task manager doesn't tell steam its not running
---
I get right up their face, stand there for 5 seconds and leave, quite often they DC before i leave lol.
---
He looks like angry pug when the killer starts chasing him.
---
The optimization is crap, sadly. I got a huge PC, can run Dark Souls 3 or Nioh on Ultra and getting constant 60fps. On the other hand, I have to put DbD on Medium to get to 60fps, and they're not constant. 
---
my man said ‚Äúachoo‚Äù and swung
---
Yeah I figured since I knew the killer side of things I could just reverse it into survivor jukes but alas that hasn‚Äôt been the case, some buildings are just super time consuming for killers to try and I should do as you say- find a video to learn them Rofl

Yup last night i got tons of DCs as soon as the map showed to be temple.
---
It's not my favorite map either but come on.
---
It's bannable, but it isn't worth reporting, because the game does it automatically anyway.
---
Noed is really bad, it's a solo qeuers worst night mare, either you hope your team does gens while you cleanse or do gens and find it after if the killer doesnt find you first
---
Legion takes less skill because of franks mixtape, two unavoidable hits if the killer is decent
---
Cmon now, maybe people exaggerate how prevalent these issues are, but they do it with everything else too
---
üëÅüëÑüëÅ
---
I could be wrong, but I think that was a last minute decision once they realized they were being ripped off. May as well make some scratch off your own work, after all.. But yea, if the low budget rip off of your game has fully featured accessibility.. Then maybe it's time to step up and do it your self, ya know? 
---
Wait, is this a bug or is the actual stun time??
---
Fuck outta here with the killer bias
---
Especially getting a 3k rather than 1for sure
---
Also, still quite curious what this person's disability is.. And if it's something that effects their game play, why do they not want to be included? Trust me, I'm not looking for an unfair advantage.. I considered myself a decent survivor, when I could still hear.. I'm just asking for a level playing field for people with hearing impairments.. Doesn't seem like too much to ask.. Especially in the Era of coddling everybody's feelings and whatnot.. üòÇ 
---

---
farming? really? a man of your talents?
---
I'm a solo survivor and i disagree.
---
Noed means the killer plays with 3 perks until endgame, and then it's just a matter of opening the gates.
---
And during that short time period the only difference is that i can take one hit instead of two.
---
The only times i've seen noed turn a game around was when survivors made a series of bad decisions.
---
TBH i'm more afraid of ruin. No one ever finds the totem and still refuses to power through gens.
---
Yes, it's the last option on the screen. As an example it says "DC early to avoid defeat"
---
She also has pretty garbage perks, especially as a 'build.'
---
You have nothing to aid a chase. Her only detection is a scream alert when you get a down and justwant to fucking hook someone. Dark whatever is a meme, chances are it goes off in a chase with the obsession and is over by the end of it, or you risk losing to swf communication. Corrupt intervention is her only game changer, and even then without being very lucky, it only means they can only rush 4 gens in the first 2 mins, not 5.
---
Thanks. I just suck at editing and cobbled it together. Try and get someone who's competent at that stuff to do it.
---
Your trolling right? 
---
I think they should word it along the lines of:  "instantly fill the wiggle bar and escape killer's grasp" that way enduring wouldn't need to affect it even for consistency reasons. I think 3secs is fine but with enduring you can literally catch up to the survivor by lunging the moment you recover from the stun
---
I‚Äôve used it üòÇ
---
Imagine sex with clown
---
The whole point of this thread is anecdotal evidence to see if the game is broken broken or it's just some people. My anecdotal evidence is since I went from a 6500 to an 8500 I haven't experienced a single issue on my end that wasn't the cause of someone else. So sure, confirmation bias? I guess but the game isn't unplayable for me at least.
---
Strongly agree. 
---
The huntress was actually an old cosplay for her and my fiance doesn't really play much and thought the legion looked cool (which doesn't go over well with this crowd. 
---
We're trying to convince our Dwight to do a Doctor
---
Did no one do gens?! This is what kills me, people don‚Äôt do gens when the killer is face camping and run into a 4 k, now I know sometimes it‚Äôs just unlucky when all 3 unhooked are going for saves but we need more people punishing face campers

Feel free to give more suggestions on this idea. I also think this should happen after a minute of normal gameplay after the last 3rd survivor dies.

Can we please have Badham's original skybox back, BHVR?

Aye mate! It was really great for my first ever con!

I‚Äôm soooo pissed I couldn‚Äôt make comic con this year!!! Awesome cosplays tho, best ones I‚Äôve seen in terms on DBD honestly üëçüèª
---
These are really good!
---
That‚Äôs an underrated build. It also counters stridor along with normal breathing sounds. When a game goes your way you‚Äôre basically a ghost
---
Yeah she doesn't sound fun.
---
Just as well they seem to have massively messed up the game so I have no inclination to try out the new killer!
---
It just isn't enough, you can always confuse the hell out of the killer with scratch marks and use the slot for a more useful perk, currently i'm running lithe, empathy, we'll make it, unbreakable, seems good so far
---
Oh for real? I've been to a few myself now, they're always fun even though the cosplay I was doing got uncomfortable after a while. Still it was a solid time. 
---
Hey, good for you. It's unplayable for the other 90% of the game's population, though.
---
Dud you cosplay yesterday? If soni might have a picture of you if you want it :)
---
Nah, she is certainly fun, her perks as a build going for adept aren't though. They have some places (except dark devotion) alongside other perks but together they have no cohesion.
---
It's similar to adept Michael or Pig, the killers are great, their perks alone are not.
---
Honestly sole survivor needs massive changes to be any good. Massive buffs for each dead teamate
---
Yup, I was Jason wearing a really torn up military jacket! 
---
Thanks for the reasonable score, it's much appreciated.
---
Totems spawn there. 
---
5-12 seem to be the widest bracket for play styles ,  camping is just rewarding when people are caught off guard , or just plain ignorant.
---
Unfortunately tunnelling is just a tactic, like gen rushing, not fun but effective :(
---
Yeah, I feel like 32 meters per dead teammate would already be a nice quality of life change
---
She should be Jane rhicc
---
Love that little look-see you had while she panicked, Like "Nice place you got here nerd"
---
Haha i wont next time for sure! You might have seen me to be honest. I was a tall guy with glasses and a black leather rectangle manbag. White hoodie with black and grey triangles on it!
---
Actually most killers are scumbags,they tunnel and facecamp you just to get kills because only numbers matter for themI.I'd say a good 80% of killer mains are like that,despite the rank.But now with the new ranking system and emblem for chaser you wont see any facecampers at high ranks,unfortunately tunnelers will still exist but bhvr will probably fix that too.
---
"you're like me. Fucking stupid"
---
I know I'm gonna be down voted, but I got a laugh out of it.
---
You're not wrong 
---
Ehh, cold dirt doesn't make the ability to recharge faster, it reduces the self-stun after frenzy end. That's what "cooldown reduction" means usually in dbd, same with billy, bubba and plague.
---
Vaguely recall seeing you if briefly my dude. :)
---
But, there's a cosmetic to get dwight bald already?
---
I find rank has to do with it a bit. I've made it to rank 1 a few times since I got the game and it seems like the purple ranks have more toxicity. I find the game is a lot more fun when I'm playing ranks 15-10 or 3-1. Plus playing at 15-10 allows you to use more variety of perks 
---
Yeah lol but her name in English would be min feng 
---
It needs to trump all killer capabilities. Aura reading, location reveal etc
---
Its just purple ranks really. I‚Äôm a rank 1 surv and killer and I don‚Äôt ever see this or do this myself personally. I realize thats anecdotal but I‚Äôm able to maintain rank 1 playing weaker killers like pig and wraith in a fair way very consistently right now so I‚Äôd say that ‚Äústrategy‚Äù is pretty shit. Purples from my experience however are bloody full of trolls so I avoid them as much as I can
---

Personally I love the grind. It gives the game more of a feel and while your waiting to get perks you want you can try everything else out

For pallet saves if someone goes down and for killers who dont use enduring and dont hit you through it.But yeah it is literally the most unsafe pallet ever,the wall isnt even 3 metres long :/
---
Well, but she forgot it's my swamp.
---
It may be a stretcht but I've noticed that most of the killer cosplays are of killers that would be easily transferable to an anime/manga and thus appeal more to cosplayers that don't really play the game but like those characters as cosplay material. Also Legion and Pig are easier to do than others.
---
Doctor is pretty difficult tho, I would love to see some Trapper or Spirit, even Wraith.
---
I can understand you. Most people are just plainly DCing,when they are downed/hooked/whatever the fuck, so I get why those acjievements are getting harder without proper punishment of DCs
---
IT SAYS 69 IN THE WINDOWS!

SEX JOKE!!!!

Thanks you glad u liked it : D

Incorrect
---
While playing killer I randomly see locker doors swing open with no one in them, as if it was 10 minutes delayed...
---
what‚Äôs wrong with bubba 
---
Except after a while you check if the killer is camping, put on ruin to get that edge at the beginning of the game and you can easily have a draw. If the first survivor goes down quickly that just makes things harder.
---
I would‚Äôve messed this up so much
---
No. The hatch is pretty fair because some people like to play stealth till they reach the hatch.
---
Forcing them into a chase when it goes against their will is ridiculous, not to mention how unfun and boring it'd be. Hatch standoffs are part of the game and are very exciting and funny from my experience, taking them out of the game is an awful idea and is far from "fair".
---
She might not play that often so a few rank resets might have done that.
---
It would be more like she has thousands of hours before, lost her account or progress, then got all the blood points from the devs. Of course that‚Äôs what would normally happen, I don‚Äôt know the context behind this post
---
Or shes just terrible

It‚Äôs not a poor system- it rewards success. You want everyone rewarded-  that is the definition of an entitled little shit. 
---
If you want rankings to mean anything, they have to reflect skill. If everyone pips all the time, why don‚Äôt we just put everyone at rank one and say good? Oh, wait- they tried that system and it sucked. The issue is the old system conditioned everyone to think they should pip constantly- now that it‚Äôs fixed, you whine and bitch.
---
 Developers are staying silent for these cheats. When I post a discussion 10 months ago, they just apologized and said "Sorry we know these cheats and we cannot do anything". 
---
Ik dacht ik was de enige in Nederland die dbd speelde
---
Why do you want a reward for losing? What is your justification that makes you not an entitled little shit?
---
I ran it and had a really awesome moment on the game. I stunned the Pig with the pallet that forces you down one of the holes from the second floor to the first. I quick and quieted straight into a locker and she went for a quick look around and saw no marks.
---
She came back right as it charged up realising what I'd done, so I smashed it and leapt out in a fast exit, the doors swung straight into her face and... she grabbed me and put me on a hook and started shaking her head like she'd really outplayed me.
---
I had Dance With Me ready to go, should've been a stun into a line of sight break in the mini-jungle gym into a potential escape and humiliating play, instead I didn't even get exhausted, the perk just blatantly didn't go off despite being a fast exit with a lit up perk.
---
I was fucking pissed.
---
That's true, but i feel it's needed. If you could loop the killer all the same it wouldn't really change anything. Also it still is the endgame, you are not supposed to stay forever and play catch.
---
Ofc survivor is harder, because you have to rely on 3 other guys. But if you go against a SWF group as a killer, you'll probably have a way harder time.
---
All in all i think they need to give survivors information about the totems, so even a solo can keep track on how many totems have been cleansed. Then i feel noed would be fine.
---
is it impossible to cheat? you are talking like this. We all know lots of people did this before 1-2 years ago and get banned.
---
Weird, this new patch has made me get pips easier than ever as survivor.
---
The hatch is heavily survivor sided, you should be able to see that
---
Play Legion with franks mixtape. That will make everyone else but you mad.
---
I'm sick of these things.
---
DS shouldn't be affected by Enduring, Head On shouldn't be affected by Enduring. Hey how about BBQ and Chilli shouldn't be affected by Distortion, does that sound reasonable to you? You bring a perk to counter stuns, it should goddamn counter stuns not have a list of exactly which ones work and which don't.
---
You mean the one crying about their pip, right? Because expecting rewards for wiping their ass properly is childish as fuck.
---
What does DC'ing even do? I find conflicting information on that matter.
---
It gives you a score of 0, so probably 0 BP too?
---
Are tools and addons kept for DCing? Most survivors i see DC right at the start brought domething green or purple, so i would imagine they are trying to save that.
---
She obviously played before the leveling system came out (player level) and there was a lot of instances before where people had their progress wiped. So if you could show proof BHVR gave you blood points depending on how many hours you had. So not a cheat
---
just gonna say it, you're wrong, the perk is garbo either way
---
You're not supposed to counter facecamping. Face camping is a flawed killer tactic that makes survs gain a stupidly big lead. Take the lead and let the guy die.
---
This is a fun perk that is in desperate need of buffs and quality of life changes.
---
On top of becoming more consistent, Head On needs to stop causing exaustion (it can keep the 60/50/40s cooldown) and the charge time you need spend inside the locker should be reduced from 3 to 2 seconds.
---
I'm fine with Enduring countering it, but if the devs insist on keeping the exaustion effect, the stun time definitely needs to be increased.
---
Are we sure it's inconsistent, rather than just a really weird radius? It seems like it's a cone, with some killers quite off to the side getting hit, but not off the side when very close to the locker...
---
I mean you shouldnt be anywhere that you cant get out unless you like being blocked by a hillbilly reeving his chainsaw üòÇ
---
Lmaoo why is this funny to me
---
It all makes sense now. Had a downed survivor and I lost him and heard his cries around that thing and had no idea where the fuck he was
---
how so?
---
When people teabags me on my Stream, I will just laugh, i think it's annoying in the fact that it's such a simple gesture after doing some dick move stuff. 
---
Its warranted an entire reddit list too, which means its achieved some form of annoyance which will only strengthen its gains.
---
It's why I tunnel all day and night, this game is forever a salt fest, I'm just doing to be a big dickhead killer every day.
---
the hillbilly needs friends too
---
LOL as it should be..... You're on your own with no pallets left in the map and like three generators waiting to be done. You think a single survivor can do this? They should have a chance.
---
Sometimes it's a 3 man game and it's hard, at times you have shitty team mates. The hatch MUST be survivor sided because at this point it's literally hard to survive or get any points on your own.
---
Huntress OP plz nerf
---
As much as I dislike the hatch. It is needed. The survivor needs his trump card. 
---
&gt;uh

&gt;okay

(Something something "Legion reee")
---
Jokes aside one of my favorite parts about Legion is that they have a very simple design that is easy to create a cosume for. This isn't meant as any hate towards your cosplay (you did a really good job on the hoodie! Did you put a logo on the back? If you did I'd love to see!) or Legion as a whole. I think it's really great that Behavior made an easily accessable character.
---
You look at the likes of Trapper or Wraith or even Billy and get spooked as heck on how you'd dress yourself up like them. But Legion just have a simple jacket and an iconic mask. Not ever Killer needs to be covered with bells and whistles.

&gt;The game is literally unplayable because you have brain-damaged potatoes going up against [Nick Castle.](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0145309/) Please we wanted rank to matter but instead you just deleted it from the game.
---
That's an ultra rare add on. Spawns fountains in trees. 
---
Oh god 
---
Nee, ik ben er ook nog :)
---
I‚Äôm 100% sure I‚Äôd check it out. Give it a go!

Hag is secretly King Bumi confirmed. 
---
If you DC, the following happens:  
---
* If you used an offering, it is lost (of course).
---
* If you brought an item, you lose it and its add-ons.  
---
* You lose all the BP you would have earned if you had stayed 'til the end (either by dying or escaping).  
---
* You derank 2 pips.  
---
Other than that (and the potential ban you risk if you DC too much) there is no penalty.
---
I'd like it if map offerings were down to brown and 3,000, yellow offering at he highest. Map offerings are so common as the rare offering % increase in blood webs after prestiging and I find them kind of useless unless I've been getting the same bad map and I get fed up and burn one. The rarity increase after prestiging should be good items and add ons, not 60 Game offerings I won't ever be using. 
---
Oh, it was cheesed alright 
---
Occasionally when I‚Äôm up against high ping killers it literally doesn‚Äôt work and the perk gets used
---
Yeah my hat hed cheesed him

---
Interesting, but then i understand even less why people ragequit with good items and addons.
---
it is possible
---
Green keys are only useful if you use an add on that reveals auras. It does nothing by itself. Those add ons just make it so that youwon't lose the key when opening the hatch (which that key can't do anyway) or dying. So now you have an useless item that doesn't do anything... But hey, you won't lose it if you die! 
---
you are such a Meg, Meg

"see's"? Really?

Are you kidding? That's when you decide to moonwalk.

Basement party at bubbas!
---
I honestly ran this perk until I found the injured ambience to be too annoying. 
---
Somehow, I got this achievement in one try because 3 survivors worked on a gen while I stood behind a tree and stalked them to empty. It was a very quick game.
---
Same. This game ia slowly dying because of all that. Really not having much fun playing this game recently.
---
I love her. Super fun to play as. Not had many games against her yet through
---
"I'm nothing without my Mither!"
---
Eh, in reality they're just dumb and toxic. I wish I could understand the mindset of people like that, but I've given up trying to at this point.

My friends even decided to quit in kill your friends whenever I play nurse. This just isn't fair. ;(
---
Tbh, I think she's too strong. 
---
Aaaw, the bow at the end!
---
You mean the P L A G?
---
Yes, and a lot of complaints. A lot of the memes and shitposts are also about the current problems
---
"counter" you are letting the killer have noed on you the whole game by using that terrible perk.
---
*laughs in Iron Maiden*
---
I was just doing locker duty chill
---
You don't need to log out to jerk off dude.
---
Yeah, it indeed does, but, there are times when I do use it and it's just sad that I miss out on a stack just because a teammate didn't make it into the game

Took a picture of Feng, Huntress and Legion yesterday at Tora-Con. I'll post it if I get your permission first, since everyone is part of the group for sure. Everyone had great costumes, hope y'all had fun making them!

Isn't that a good thing though? 
---
You're being so toxic, defending yourself and playing the game. üò° ~/s~
---
From my experience, usually when a killer is being accused of lag switching is when the lobby has good ping but as soon as you load into the match you start teleporting and rubberbanding. I agree and do dodge lobbies with bad ping but in stances I described that doesn't happen. I tend to play to just have fun but it gets frustrating when you can't do anything.
---
Must be both me and my friends met 3 in the span of 2 hours on PS4

Sheesh that‚Äôs bad. And YES that stupid disconnect one is AWFUL but tbf I‚Äôve been getting that since late legion times

Same. I didn't got my way up the red ranks to get matched with 15+ not that it matters.... Lost 8 ranks

And that other player is a pro
---
Well I main killer and don't do thia too often but I have to confess that its hilarious 
---
WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU BROUGHT UPON THIS CURSED LAND
---
Should've looped her in the killer shack instead of running in the open field.
---
Well , it's not like every other game out there has features for people with hearing problems...
---
I met a deaf player once and I still have no idea how he played so well, but this is a fantastic idea
---
It‚Äôs really fun when you hook the toxic next to NOED and their SWF can‚Äôt do anything.
---
The survivor experience.
---
Needs more jpeg.
---
you let them bleed out?
---
iron will?
---
I like this. 
---
...you‚Äôre getting salty over a basement bubba?
---
Lol you offended people boohoo I'm going to downvote you 
---
I'm not upset about "in game" issues like Legion,  NOED,  and DS.  I just want the game to run smooth.  I don't want to stagger when getting hit, I don't my frames to be non existent when someone 360s or runs through corn. I just want gameplay to be stable.  All the perks and player buffs/nerfs can be figured out after the actual game runs well IMO. 
---
Damn she thiccc üòç
---
this went south hella fast LOLOLOl
---
Disgusting killer strategy.. 
---
"Then you shouldn't have it!"
---
......this is....
---
*absolutely adorable.*
---
People keep dodging your lobby so they don't have an unenjoyable experience with extreme lag
---
Wish I recorded one hit, it was complete bullshit
---
Yeah that would be pretty toxic 
---
When you standing on the hatch
---
killer just death on hook the last guy
---
and you waiting for the death animation to finish as your hear the Terror radius get louder
---
LET ME IN
---
LEEEEEEET MEEEEEEE INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
---
I'm sorry, but unless your Asian, your never gonna be able to pull off a perfect Feng Min cosplay. Good effort though, but the fact she's not Asian just kinda takes away from the look. 
---
*Good god I sound like a spaz I'm sorry if I sound rude*
---
On most matters I certainly can. You however went out of your way to post an opinion you knew was shitty. You didnt add value to the conversation, IMO you could've just kept your mouth shut. 
---
In the PTB I was in a game where I presume the killers and 2 other survivors were working together. At least, I think they were cause the killer seemed to be friends with one of the 2 in Steam (who were also friends).
---
The 4th guy disconnected early in the game and I was wondering that. They were under the temple so when I went there I saw the guy on the ground and started working on the gen. I hear heartbeats and I hide in the locker just in case cause I had Head On. The other survivor started pointing at me and the killer was doing nothing. I then rushed out the locker too early so I got hit and vomited on. I tried to cleanse it but the other survivor blocked me right as I finish cleansing. Literally spent 80% there. I thought they were farming so I tried to do it but the killer just downed me and the 2 survivors just teabagged me on the ground. Every time I hid in a locker they pointed at it.
---
Yes, yes, you know the difference between quitting and actually disconnecting. Good for you.  
---
However, the term DC'ing is used for both situations, and most people quit through the menu, because most people who are on that level of toxicity are not smart enough to unplug their Ethernet cable.  
---
The term is a generalisation which pretty much everyone uses. Except you, apparently.
---
Mind explaining, cause a quick google search doesn‚Äôt bring anything up?
---
It doesn't really take much to loop tho
---
Those puppy eyes..
---
Leatherface is fun to face if they don't camp
---
Cant forget about the random crash fuck you
---
Half the problems are user related. Unfortunately the devs aren't hard on people who ruin the game for everyone else. Especially people who DC at the very least. 
---
Hope you get permabanned
---
The Hillbilly's/The Cannibal's dream.
---
Report them to Sony, and they‚Äôll usually get at least a one week ban. When people trash talk me, I usually send winky faces or Nathan Drake stickers that trigger them into cursing me out, after which I get them banned.
---
I feel the game was designed for using multiple senses and making a visual cue might give people an unfair advantage.  Don't be so fragile about it. 
---
I will always run the god perk
---
Exactly, nothing to do with strategy, just general gameplay upon encounter
---
This is not new but it's hilarious how many killers don't know about it
---
Nah, I knew that going in, she's just my fave üòç
---
To be honest, I'm one of those people, LOL  
---
I just don't draw him very often because I feel like I can't do him/his mask justice :-(
---
Good stuff. 
---
If it's swf I usually either play nurse/spirit or just dodge if not in the mood of tryharding and getting bmed
---
That‚Äôs hot
---
Should've used bald Dwight for Aang smh.
---
Because all that matters is the actual sacrifices. Dont be mad at us be mad at the development team. I havent even played in 2 months because it's literally shit latley.
---
You are the babiest of babies if you think any of those aside from old Decisive (it used to be survivors NOED but now the crutch has been nerfed our of the game) is anything remotely close to NOED.  Perma haste and instadown as a reward for failing to protect your objectives is comparable to Self Care, Borrowed or Sprint Burst lol.  It's a pathetic safety net crutch for killers that are to trash to down survivors without it.  90% of the killers that run it rely on it to get their kills.  The other 10% are simply lazy and want mindlessly easy games.  As a killer main it embarrasses me to see others still run that crutch when this game has never been easier for us after all these buffs.
---
I legit just fucking peed myself.
---
How is that fat?
---
And does the person has to be exactly the same to cosplay? nope
---
cosplay is dressing up as your favourite character, and to have fun, so let them have fun
---
You're a joke of a killer if you run that babydick perk.  It teaches that you can play very very poorly, over commit to chases, fail to protect objectives but hey it's okay you always can just crutch out a kill or more at the end when good ol' safety net kicks in.   Take off the training wheels and it forces you to play better I'm game.  I didn't learn how to play killer until after I cut the chord and took off the safety net.
---
Let's not forget the bugged 3 man lobbies. As a survivor it's not a big deal because you can instant queue again, but the killer waited 5 minutes to get that lobby only for it to bug out and never get a 4th. This has been in the game for MONTHS they even "updated" their matchmaking and didn't even think about fixing it.
---
She looks so sad.
---
I laughed harder than I should 
---
Wait, is the camera swap real or a bug?
---
after 700 hours i've encountered 2-3 insidious LF and tbh it makes me laugh seeing how desperate some of them are. 
---
Relying on a bug to win...nice
---
Don't give them what they want
---
I see you're also a man of culture. 
---
Bug
---
Then why did you submit your original comment if you were talking about the old ranking system? I in fact got the achievement for rank 1 but only with Killer and it's legit easy as fuck if we're talking 2.5.0 and below. But since i was clearly talking about 2.6.0 in my comment, maybe you didn't know about the update.
---
This, unironically
---
I would like a tool to sort lobby by ping. 
---
You dont understand. I play games to have fun - primary objective. If I dont want to play against cunts, I dont play. Simple as that. Usually we try to do atleast 2 gens so teammate can get a hatch if that makes you feel better. Killers are then so happy in the post game chat: "I killed you - so I played good"...... I suicided on hook or DC so that the  random baby dwight can get the hatch. 
---
Mom said it‚Äôs my turn on the generator 
---
agreed
---
It's a Leatherface, y'already know what the fuck is gonna happen
---
god like cropping 
---
He didnt have 4 perks either. Im sure the 3 adrenaline, 2 decisive, 4 dead hard and 2 deliverance mixed with 2 insta heals and a flashlight were no cakewalk. You should play killer sometime.
---
\&gt;Serious instead of series
---
\&gt;Weather instead of whether
---
\&gt;There instead of they're
---
\&gt;Complete lack of punctuation
---
\&gt;"Spellcheck"  
---
Nah.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking to have it be an instant heal as the gates are open, so it would bring someone back up or let them be able to tank a hit.  Sort of like a Noed but for survivors. I was thinking let it be Hope that gets the buff since it already gives you movement speed.... but this seems like it would fit this perk theme better
---
Baby survivors
---
Cause they're cosplaying for themselves, not your wank-collection.
---
If you haven't noticed this sub is full of pussies who are ALWAYS right. Im a rank 1 critic btw.
---
this item is completely broken please fix
---
Its like me trying not to nut so I can enjoy the blowjob an extra 5 mins.
---
Same, my DH spawned here. Helped me win against a toxic swf group, they were panicking so much 
---
pig player as it's finest 
---
I don't intentionally do it, say if a survivor wants to act like a piece of trash I'll treat them like a trass, looping, flashlights, yea that's fine, even teabagging, but just guys who you can tell only play to be disrespectful to others are the ones I'd prefer die more than anything.
---
But I do follow my own "house rules" like; no DS = no basement hooking, no assholes = always being fair to everyone, a streamer who goes full tryhard and can't just have fun playing = no fun for them then and stuff like that. But a good 95% of the time I follow the "community rules that aren't actually rules just a bunch of crying children made them up" and always follow EULA rules.
---
Ok
---
from godlike perk to complete garbage
---
I see that the nurse had a P3 Claudette Dc on her. 
---
Ok I'll maybe get hated for that one but on what kind of... THING do you play on to have all of these problems THAT often seriously ?!
---
I don't want to judge or anything but its really hard for me to understand the pain of players that actually experience all of these when I almost never experienced them myself... 
---
It's like people complaining about the FPS problems on console like what are you guys playing on ?! A freaking plank of wood ?! Under the right setup, a PS4 pro can go to the beloved 60 FPS instead of being blocked at 30.
---
Really I would like to understand how hard the game is for you but I just can't since mine is running more than correctly...
---
* Actually be able to load into the lobby without receiving an error.
---
Happened once only, over a year ago I think.
---
* Hope that the host's/survivor's ping isn't red.
---
Almost never, most of time it's green or orange.
---
* Hope that the host/survivor stays.
---
Only got exactly 5 peoples disconnecting, 3 of them were survivors just before their last hook, so it didn't changed anything for me.
---
* Hope that the loading screen doesn't freeze.
---
I didn't know it could actually freeze...
---
* Hope that the loading screen isn't infinite.
---
Same thing...
---
* Hope that you actually connect to the match.
---
* Hope that everyone else just got through the same obstacles that you did.
---
Guess what ? Same thing...
---
* Hope that the Killer/Survivor don't DC for stupid reasons.
---
Only happened twice and it made me laugh like "you're giving me a free kill buddy !"
---
He had ds, dead hard, adrenaline and deliverance. Calling it now.
---
People are becoming more and more aware that there is *no consequence* to disconnecting. About 25% of games have someone DC in them.\* That's a quarter of games that become instantly unwinnable because of one teammate.
---
If BHVR implemented even the most rudimentary punishment for chronic disconnecting, those numbers would plummet. There's plenty of automatic reporting systems that discourage "convenience" disconnects, while allowing the occasional accident. The fact that this game has gone on this long without so simple, speaks to how much BHVR cares.
---
\*According to exhaustive statistics posted by another reddit user. Source incoming.
---
Met a jake a while ago that said "NO POINT TO PLAY VS CANCER!!!!!!", I was a bing bong boi 
---
I hade my devour hope spawn there one game, genuinely felt sorry for the survivors lol
---
They have to be within your terror radius for them to scream and for their auras to be revealed.  
---
If you're playing a killer with a small terror radius, I'd say it's a bad perk.
---
When bhvr makes a logical change. 
---
Survivors: BROKEN! OP! THEY ONLY CATER TO KILLERS!
---
Downvotes because im right :)
---
Maybe pre update that would have happened...The whole new system floods people in of connections you wouldn‚Äôt have normally gotten because with the old system that picked preferable pings everyone complained the wait times were too long. You add a filter where you only look for green pings.. and say goodby to playing regular matches 
---
The answer is Dwight.
---
Jokes aside, David has some really cool perks you can start out with.
---
Neither as a survivor... that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a standoff. It‚Äôs advantageous for both parties to sit and wait for the other to mess up, I.e. go first. People just need to deicide what‚Äôs more important to them.
---
Why shouldnt they though? 
---
What region 
---
Wtf?!?! ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
---
How long has that been there?!?! 
---
myers
---
yes, no mither cancelling the injured music would be such a great buff.
---
That must have been so satifying to mori these people, I hope to do that soon

Clearly balanced because it‚Äôs ultra rare haha

You got some balls showing up as Legion. I'd love to strangle it. Hate it soooo much. Nevertheless, great cosplay!
---
You mean doing the objective?
---
who?
---
What did you guys do there? Looks fun! I love the cosplay!
---
You know legendary outlaw
---
Wglf is definitely very good to gain BP, but other david perks are kind of bad IMO (I am not good enough with looping yet to use Dead Hard). That being said, I am not exactly starving for BP, as I am a pretty decent killer, with 200+h into the game
---
No. Just ... no. The whole point of the hatch is to keep true to the horror trope of the final girl, in this case person living. Mechanically it makes it so the 4th player has something to actually accomplish when 3 people get caught. This mini game of yours is just, and I‚Äôm sorry, stupid.  
---
As of right now we need something that can stop the standoff that isn‚Äôt just people getting bored, of there were ways of baiting or closing the lock after a while it would make it less stagnant 
---
I usually NEVER face camp but I was on ps4 yesterday and it was my first go at nurse (I‚Äôve had dbd for 6 months) because I needed to get a rite of the last breath ritual. I came across two p3 claudettes that would flashlight click and tbag because I couldn‚Äôt blink correctly. So when I finally caught one claudette I facecamped and as you could imagine they would swarm the hook and i would down them. It was a whole process of down, save, hook, down, save, and hook. Eventually they were both dead and I really didn‚Äôt feel good about it but hey got like 80k bps
---
I go after Claudette, Dwight and any neon hair first, rest is fair game.
---
Dwight is 2 QT 4 me
---
But the Nurse does not please my eyes
---
NA
---
Too many disconnects, need to increase the punishment.
---
The ranks are messed up atm, win something like 80% of the games but lose rank. 
---
If one player dcs in the beginning before the game is supposed to start you need to cancel the game, 4 gens on 3 people is not even close to the same as 5 gen 4 people.
---
The winrate 3v1 has to be like 5%.

Nea

This is why I have Frank‚Äôs mixtape add-ons saved up. As a last resort there‚Äôs also one-shot hatchets..

Lmao survivor main. I personally believe she is the most balanced killer in the game. She has lots of counter play, and the main purpose of her power is to  A) Waste time, and B) Make the survivors fuel her. In the end, you are CHOOSING to let her have the corrupt. 99% of survivors cleanse because they don't wanna be broken the whole game. Her vomit is quite difficult to aim and get used to so it's not like she has no learning curve. If you are REALLY against her corrupt purge, just stay broken the whole game and don't cleanse. I know it's easier said than done, but still. I play both survivor and killer, and she is honestly quite an average killer. She is probably the most 'middle' killer in the game. Not overpowered, but not super weak. In good hands, she is really good- and in bad hands, she is really bad. She is probably the best time wasting killer in the game. Since you could be in a chase with one survivor and puke on another survivor near them and continue to chase the previous survivor knowing the other survivor is not doing gens or anything. Again, 99% of survivors cleanse when they are sick. So you can just keep spraying them and they will keep wasting time. Combine that with constantly vomiting on gens and she can REALLY slow the game down.          I do not think she is overpowered in the slightest. I have spent over 1Mil BP

Don't think plague deserves A-tier just because of how inconsistent her puke can be from a range but I guess she's essentially a less mobile hillbilly which isn't the worst thing for sure.

I disagree.

I may be in the minority, but for me the best part of the game is trying to not be found while the Heartbeat is going off like crazy. The anticipation of being caught is where the game gets the most joy from me.

It depends if you're about to die on the hook if I don't get you I want to at least give you the chance. I'm talking about last hook stuff during the hopefully end game. Otherwise I'd only do it if I had Borrowed Time on.

Thanks :) I was even carrying around Frank's mixtape (and Susie's ofcourse) so even more hate :)

Thanks! I was mostly just walking around looking at all the cool people/stuff at the con and I've seen the Tom Felton Q&amp;A :) Met up with the nurse (through Reddit) so we could take some pictures together, don't know what she did the rest of the day. \\
---
Mostly had some fun matches playing survivor last night. Was playing with my sister's fiance and my fiance, so that made it fun just messing around, and almost all the killers we went against were friendly in post game chat. Talked a while about the Plague with someone just trying her for the second match ever. Gave them tips and had fun discussing her mechanics. For their second match ever I was super impressed, they got three of us. I think that match was one of my favorite ever even if I was sacrificed.
---
That is no hiding spot, it's a death trap.
---
Today is my irl cake day
---
What settings are you using?
---
First Meg, get that adrenaline perk (also sprint burst since you said your not the best at looping for dead hard) next Claudette get that self care perk, if your playing solo this is almost a must since most of your survivor friends will be potato. Afterwards I'd go Nea for the balanced landing(personal preference but I find that to be the most useful exhaustion perk as you still get a benefit from it while exhausted) and to top it all off Adam for his Diversion perk, self explanatory as to why that's the best perk that ever was/will be created, fight me. Best of luck playing survivor the more you play both sides the better you get at each!
---
Pretty much :(
---
I don't get the mindset that sexual assault can never be joked about, but death and murder is ripe for bantz.
---
Murder and death are objectively worse than sexual assault. That person is gone to oblivion forever, and from their perspective all their family and loved ones are all dead to them. They'll never be happy or enjoy anything again. Victims of sexual assault can still lead full lives.
---
So if we can joke about death, we can joke about sexual assault, provided it's respectfully not directed AT a victim, or condones the acts. 
---

you need that self care and sprint burst asap i promise you
---
We just got to wait for those sexy dedicated servers in the summer 
---
The eyeballs are touching this is not ok.
---
I do wish they would make a survivor with a fight back perk. Theres always one person in horror movies that fights back. Sure they might die but it takes time.
---
I like it, but what I'd really like to see is BT activating without the terror radius so you can't work around it with Pig, Wraith, Insidious, or any of mobility killers.
---
Also I kinda want it to not be possible to pull a healthy survivor off of an unhook, but that might be too much.
---
She should‚Äôve gone for the other window, the one right beside her. I guess this means Enduring is going on 90% of my Killer builds now. 
---
Does that make specific colors brighter? That would be really nice

This Trophy was the hardest for me to get. Try to farm at the End with the Survivors on the Exitgates. Sometimes they give you free Shots.

it's you who wrote it in the wiki ?

Nah I‚Äôll totally flashlight click right in their face. It‚Äôs for their cosplay experience   /s

no they just know their stuff
---
wasnt even godlike it just gave you a second chance which rarely amounted to much unless it was end game and you were near a hatch or exit and it was really easy to miss the skill check
---
it was a good perk and probably the best but not godlike
---
oh trueüòÇ, which nea outfit tho?

Hi, local leatherface who doesnt facecamp, i just want his teachables man.
---
My favorite matches are after all the waiting you join a game where everyone DCs after getting downed once!

I hate this 
---
A perk shouldnt need to run with another to work. Im not too bothered about their being shit perks but sole survivor is particularly bad especially as its an obsession perk
---
remaro? I‚Äôm honoured to be granted the thiccness
---
They have a secondary objective. It's the totems. Survivors refusing to acknowledge it shouldn't necessitate a perk rework. You're either trolling or you're impossibly thick. 
---
Honestly like 90% of both side's complaints could be solved with this
---
never seen a legion farm
---
this is the funniest post ive seen on reddit so far omg
---
Oh boy this just got me so excited for my Cannibal mask farming today.
---
 I need you to understand that it's nobody's job to exist assuming everything they type online has potential going to make someone kill themselves. Especially over differences of opinion on a videogame, or over saying something blunt or sarcastic.
---
To assume the worst in every case and force positivity or silence is harmful and paranoid, IMHO.
---
Also:
---
Why would you assume that the people bullying and/or trolling online don't have physical, mental, and / or emotional damage?
---
 That's one of the biggest reasons to be a dick online, like everyone on this thread is saying.
---
Umm there is this killer called the Legion...
---
ü§Æ
---
Yeah but just remember for one second that this is a game people play to have some fun and when they killer camps and tunnels it ruins the experience for that person. Which I think is fair to be frustrated about. Also respect the 4%. 
---
Not all heros wear capes
---
Or sell items and add-ons for half of their normal price. I will never use sabotage add-ons and i‚Äôm sure other players have add-ons they never use
---
Where I live I routinely connect to killers located in Asian aka an Asian Killer lobby 
---
that‚Äôs a killer?
---
that would give birth to a whole new level of p3 claudette players
---
and i do not want to see this ever happening
---
Dbd is capped at 60fps by default you have to unlock it by changing the game file. After doing that I get like 90-100 in game and I have a high end gpu but not the best CPU at all. 
---
Ben er ook jonges, ook nog eens een Freddy main.
---
A good survivor is what made it godlike. Finally catch a strong looper before they reach the next jungle gym but they just hop right off your back. It completely destroyed momentum. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve quit this game after my 3200 hours I‚Äôve put in. It was a great game. The devs have unfortunately ruined the fun game that it was. GG Bhvr. Hope y‚Äôall take the game where you want it, because it‚Äôs not going the way any of the veteran players wanted it too. Sure it‚Äôs attracting new players, but it‚Äôs a whole different game now compared to early 2017. Not fun anymore :/ 
---
Beasts marks = speedy boi

I bring the last one to the hatch unless it's one of these kpop feng min players who t-bag the whole game. Everyone else is welcome
---
They were in this case.
---
Yay-aiiiii! *winks*
---
He definitely gets a bad image because bad players use him to camp, when played normally he's not bad.
---
I mained Billy for the longest, started playing LF for some variety, he's basically just a weaker Billy, but still fun.
---
I was there too, cosplaying as the Huntress, and I was really hoping to see a Legion, but I didn't see ya... I did meet the Nurse tho XD
---
I struggle keeping my head up playing this game sometimes but watching Hybrid Panda on YouTube makes me want to play again every time, if you are having trouble finding fun check him out. Works for me at least
---
what if they dc because their internet goes out
---
This change does not stop you from tunneling off hook but it promotes finding someone else. And it only applies for 30 secs at which point you would get normal points. 
---
I don‚Äôt really see tunneling as an issue with the game, but just the result of poor survivor decision making. If someone is getting unhooked while the killer is walking towards it, of course the killer is gonna go for the person who just got off, it‚Äôs a very simple decision. Think about it this way: You‚Äôre the killer, you find two survivors in the same place. One is completely healthy and the other is injured. The obvious logical decision is to go for the injured one first simply because it takes less time for higher reward. 
---
The way I see it, tunneling isn‚Äôt a problem within the game, but rather the result of survivors not knowing the right time to unhook. This can easily be solved just by thinking about how to time your unhooks instead of just rushing to save someone while the killer is close by.
---
Someone else feels my pain! Yes lol!     
---
    
---
Is this console btw? Had something similar the other day.
---
A buff to borrowed time would be cool. Maybe a -3% speed debuff or something when the killer hits the unhooked survivor 
---
‚ÄúKobe?  How about no be?‚Äù- Oink Mistress
---
Leatherface is bad because hes essentially a basic killer. He has an insta down if people are dumb/have nothing to use, his power has zero utilty in loops or anywhere really.
---
He can camp well and thats his strength. If you are a good killer youd play billy as he can do everything leatherface can and with a speedboost/ no slow down when charging the chainsaw. 
---
Fat Jesus has style, but also asthma.
---
Not gonna lie, you made it all sound so wholesome. I now want to NUT on everyone.
---
No, I'm a cunt. 
---
where them results?
---
This needs to be NSFW. Can't unsee this lmao
---
Don't do it too frequently though, remember that you need to NUT too. 
---
Makes sense to utilize a killers stealth ability to maybe catch the last survivor. You don't know if they would've stayed. You don't know their perk layout. Maybe the dude had BBQ and didn't see anyone, rightfully expecting the other guy to be near. Maybe they noticed the last guy in the chase and try to lure them out.
---
And no, people demanding to "respect the 4%" are the reason i'm not gonna do that. 
---
Even as a survivor i don't expect the killer to cuddle me and tell me everything will be alright after i got the 4%, not sure why people demand special treatment.
---
2019 is scarier than the game atm..
---
Chosen one!

Nvidia Freestyle has been a godsend for me. I have 2 issues with my eyes, astigmatism in both, and keratoconus in one. What this means is that while 1 eye is corrected decently by my glasses, the other one is legally blind as everything I see with it is like looking through a drop of water and the other eye doesn't do enough to compensate for the bad one. If you squint and tear up a little, you should get an idea of what I'm talking about with fuzzy vision and blurry light beams emanating from everything. 
---
This makes it very difficult to see anything clearly enough to differentiate objects in the game from characters, especially if they are holding still, due to how dull and dark the games colors and environments are. I can track moving objects with fair accuracy, but in a game loaded up with swaying plants, and drifting fog in each map, it's difficult to tell what's what. With freestyle though, I'm able to make the colors and details more vivid and crisp which really helps make the survivors/killers more easy to differentiate from the environment. I still have my T-Rex moments where I'll be inches away from a P3 Claudette in a corner looking for movement, and listening hard for her breathing, but overall I'm able to play either roll much better. Thank god I'm not also colorblind as well, but even if I were, Freestyle has options for that too. As for anyone else, I highly recommend using it if you have eyesight issues, or if you just want the game to look prettier and more colorful.

Oink Mistress is my new favorite thing

Killers who tunnel dont care about anything but getting kills. Killers who do it dont care if its smart to tunnel or anything else they'll just always do it.Same as campers

The question was just why to go when he sees you. Don't mention I'm injured in OP. But anyways. If the hooked guy is in struggle I think is a fair trade anyways. If it's a camping killer he can heal. Himself and do some gens and someone else might try to save me, maybe with borrowed time as well and we all survive for free. 
---
I always thought it was spamming the unhook animation over and over.
---
There is something about megs and dwights for sure.
---
The meg i mentioned before was actually crouching down behind a tiny twig while i smacked a claudette not even 5m away. She wouldn't move even while i was walking up to her, so since she was already on her third hook i just slugged her for her teammates to pickup everytime i caught her from there on. At the end of the match i had the other guys on hooks and went to pick her up carrying her to the exit gate. I just noded at her to tell her "Be free little bird".
---
Actually something similar happened to me when i just started out. Hopefully one day that meg will pass on kindness to other new players.
---
Naw, I think it looks awesome. 
---
suiciding. running the perk kindred helps too. but most people will just suicide if the killer is camping. 
---
As always, you can't punish away camping.  Campers don't give a flying fuck about points, perk penalties or anything OTHER than ruining someone's day. 
---
  
---
The only thing you "punish" is a killer who is pushed into staying at the hook by your fellow Survivors.  Where's the punishment for a survivor being near the hook for a certain length of time without saving? 
---
I don't know why people cannot wrap their head around this.  Campers camp because they enjoy knowing you are having a shitty time.  There's only 2 ways to "stop" camping... 1) Survivors die on their first hook, or 2) Hooking a survivor creates a forcefield around the hook that pushes the killer out of and thst he can't enter.  Which of those sounds actually fun? 
---
Are they...
---
"Thicc?"
---
I don't know why, but the way they're moving reminds me of SCP Containment Breach specifically.
---
Doctor.exe
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter they‚Äôre injured anyways. Iron Maiden doesn‚Äôt matter by that point.
---
The only emotes i got so far was survivors pointing at other survivors or the follow gesture while in a chase.
---
But even from the survivor side i wouldn't know how to communicate with a killer with those options.
---
I would NEVER üò≠ it pains me for you to say this as a member of the Claud Squad mains.

.... he didn‚Äôt seriously say that in the late 2010s, did he? Gay = Lame is so early 2000s homophobia.

G e k o l o n i s e e r d

---
Which is literally the worst possible survivor response to camping.  The only punishment for camping is to have the other 3 survivors punish his babyass with a gen rush so they can get out.  Survivors that kill themselves early are literally rewarding the killer for camping them.

---
lol sorry
---
Good for you man.  It's refreshing to see a Leatherface that actually plays his BBQ and Chili the intended way to find a new survivor and initiate a new chase rather than counting the splinters on the hook.  I've played against good Leatherfaces before so I agree you're not all camping tools.  Unfortunately there's just a lot more of them in the community than you.  I feel the same about my Freddy play.  He's known for tunneling off hook but I don't play him that way.  I've received messages post game thanking me after killing them for not playing like a piece of shit with him.
---
Congratulations on an involuntary birth
---
Survivor sided game btw 
---
I go for Sunday drives as Billy running unnerving presence so I can get a few chuckles hearing explosions go off randomly, it‚Äôs sadistic in a kind way I‚Äôd like to think.
---
I was coming here to say Nea too.  You'd slay that cosplay.  Just pick a really cool toxic cosmetic to cosplay.  She's got the best cosmetics out of all the survivors.
---
Thanks, I hate it!
---
&gt; My Precious - It can stack well with street wise, but the aura reading needs to go up, it's very situational so having it be like 40 meters will not be game breaking.
---
Yea i picked 20m more to not exaggerate the unrealistic aspect of the perk rather than to not break the balance. But yea you can even make it 60m if you want given that it's a non optimal perk for survivor.
---
&gt; Hero - An interesting idea, don't know why it has to be an exhaustion perk though, this will just make people avoid it if they are running any form of exhaustion perk.
---
Yea the thing is to avoid to have 4 people runnin' it in the same team. That say,  you'll most likely end up on a hook by using this perk, so you'll have time to recover from exhaustion until someone unhook you :D
---
&gt; i am very much against any perk that would help wiggle free easier just like that
---
Solo survivors are the core of the game. Love has to be given to them. You can't balance the game around killers getting their 2K against good swf.
---
+10% on struggle strength won't be game changing at all in solo survivors play, but if the killer does not manage well his hooks it will allow the guy using it to punish him for that. 
---
Oh we did, we had only two gens left, but at some point we stopped. When it was only two of us, he hooked the Nea, facecamped (oc)  and I randomly saw the hatch, so just waited till she was sacrificed and took the hatch. But he did get 3 of us.

Darn, can't get the chased for 3 gens because no one is doing gens.
---
I hate this.  This meme clearly originated from the Event Horizon.
---
I made a legion disconnect earlier in the week before the new patch update. After looping him and pallet slamming him from Ferrell frenzy for 5 gens he finally got me. I then DS him and almost made it out the exit gates. He even tried to make me miss the DS by spinning and stabbing while on his shoulder but I hit it. :) normally I can loop most killer 2-3 gens pending on the solos I‚Äôm paired with, but this guy wouldn‚Äôt break off the chase and go after someone else. Got a message few mins later saying ‚Äúyou damn loopers‚Äù  then 1 hour later I looped a Myers for 5 gens on the red forest map thru the house, as soon as the last gen popped he DC lol best day of DBD I‚Äôve had! 
---
aww poor guy he probably doesn't speak english very well. but it honestly made me giggle a lot
---
Surely you could have bought a ruler though right, if not that sucks
---
Claudette, Meg and Kate. Well, that is if they are actually going to ‚Äúsave‚Äù me
---
Well for one open a fps, put a dot on tape and paste it over the middle of the crosshairs. Now you can see where you‚Äôre aiming. 
---
How do you play with that level of gamma? 
---
Ik my outfit sucks LMAO I didn‚Äôt get to finish changing 
---
Yup all 250+ ping . Profiles written in Japanese
---
It's usually said as a joke... although it does enable you to use dead hard as a noed counter.
---
Yep, Ps4
---
What is this country? 
---
Playing killer in general is just a lot more fun now.  After all these recent updates they've made it considerably easier to play.  You can easily play a fun game with no camping, tunneling or NOED and still get  a 3 or 4k at this point.  And the survivors get so much bloodpoints since you keep switching targets they don't even send salt after game.  If I receive a message post game it's usually a gg.

Killers are hard to balance due to the different modes of survivor; solo or SWF.
---
Most killers are made to be relatively balanced with solo, but SWF can completely shit on those killers most the time. 
---
Killers like the Nurse are meant to balance more with SWF squads.
---
Solo&lt;LowTierKiller&lt;SWF&lt;HighTierKiller.
---
Instead of killing survivors, she kills franchises.
---
for survivors ?
---
I knew it! I have a post from a few days ago of a legion match where all 4 were like that. The closer they got the more frames I started dropping, and I have a pro so it‚Äôs not like it shouldn‚Äôt have been able to handle it. In your case they weren‚Äôt giant monsters like mine... but damn near close to the same thing.
---
(I'm assuming you play on PC)
---
Is it normal to play with people from other countries very often?
---
You're fucking up, bud.
---
I dont know what it is but Myers are usually the nicest killers to go against. If they stomp on the survivors too hard he let's some of them go.
---
Doesn't really prevent them from hard tunneling off hook.  It's pretty easy to cheese the borrowed time timer much like a moonwalking Legion.  Wraith is easily the best at this.  Seriously it is so cheesy but just following them cloaked renders the perk useless.  The only time Borrowed time comes in to play is when there's an open exit gate.
---
You're literally the only person I've seen talk.about this, I was really excited for Meg but it's not there, and it doesn't make any sense
---
Oh that‚Äôs what you meant I thought you meant there was a good item you wanted but you weren‚Äôt able to get it
---
My bad
---
How do you propose making medkits more usable against her without reworking the whole power? 
---
Oh boy. Don‚Äôt go on Twitter.
---
I can‚Äôt escape all of these in-ironic ‚ÄúSHANE DAWSOM FUCKS HIS CAT‚Äù because of an edgy joke he made in 2009.
---
Humanity is truly bored as fuck.
---
You do when you play survivor. You literally said it a few posts above dude
---
It would be a huge nerf to her if you could heal with medkits. That would mean no one would use her fountains but still be able to heal themselves. It would completely destroy her character. 
---
The new changes are strange.
---
First they change rank to make it significantly more difficult to rank up. This is to allow for ranks to mean more &amp; means playing against survivors at the same rank leads to a more fair playing field as the skill is more consistent.
---
But simultaneously, they open matchmaking to find a wider variety of ranked players to reduce lobby waiting times. This leads to survivors with high ranks coming in contact with newer survivors. 
---
These 2 things basically counteract each other &amp; instead exacerbate the issue of bringing new players into contact with more talented players. 
---
Having these 2 things counter each other suggest BHVR has no idea on what to do with the ranking system
---
YAAAS BITCH SNATCH HER WEAVE
---
I‚Äôve played PC but not often I main Ps4 usually. I know PC people would get further people more often than I used to, it was every now and then, but when I‚Äôm on a 5am there‚Äôs basically 0 chance of anyone playing in my time zone so I‚Äôm glad I get connected up with Europe or anywhere for that matter. There‚Äôs always been the chance to but on a priority system it will wait it out. Now we don‚Äôt have 20 minute lobby‚Äôs and imo it‚Äôs far better even if you have to deal with a bit of lag every now and then.
---
&gt; Killers and survivors being even able to use the same perks/items suggests that they aren't fundamentally different. 
---
That's probably the case. When this game first began life it was a fairly small project.
---
I know for a fact all the 3 original Killers share a basic skeleton, Michael and the others do too IIRC, which is how they can use bear traps and chainsaws. While it might be Michael Myers, his character is just a modified version of the Hillbilly and Trapper's skeletons, so he can use the same animations as them even though his model isn't exactly suited to them. It's that way because it's easier to take something that's already been built and modify it into something new than it is to build something new from scratch.
---
I'd imagine that it's something similar for the way the loadouts work. Way back when this game was more idea than real code, it was probably easier to design one basic character system: the items, the perks, and the offering, than two distinct ones. The only differences between the two are what items, perks, and offerings they can use and, again, those items, perks, and offerings were probably all designed from one template.
---
I might be wrong, but those are my thoughts on the subject.
---
The thing is that i don't even play Legion
---
Edit: i'm a Pig main
---
I'm starting to think this is because red ranks is slowly running out of players. I'm probably wrong but I noticed a lot of already really good killers and survivors being knocked back to lower ranks because of the high pip requirements. You'd have to play really sweaty to pip in higher ranks now which is what a lot of people (including myself) don't want to do.
---
They need to moderately reduce the pip requirements and make sure the matchmaking system prioritizes rank. Lower matchmaking times can be nice but I'd rather not be matched up with a killer/survivors way outside of my rank.

I still get this repeated freezing every few minutes. As a survivor, it freezes me on the spot and i just run on the spot until its unfrozen. As a killer, the whole game freezes for everyone and the survivors have a chance to disconnect. I have no idea why this happens, my setup should be able to run the game fine (Ryzen 5 1400 and GTX 1060). There are no other performance issues aside from this. I have had the game since launch so there is maybe a cache issue or files that have accumulated and are causing freezing, idfk. I have reinstalled and verified game cache countless times to no avail. The issue has been going on for around 6 months now. Anyone else getting similar issues and knows a fix? Any suggestions are appreciated.
---
I give every Jane player the hatch.
---
It pays to be THICC
---
In patch notes ‚Äúwe fixed the ranking system [by breaking it have fun you dumb fucks] but at least you don‚Äôt have to wait 30 minutes anymore to get into a match. 
---
Gelukkig ben je niet de enige. Ik speel meestal met 2 vrienden. :)
---
There is absolutely no exaggeration about a killer with NOED consistently getting one down from a final chase pre gen pop or a person at one of the two door handles.  You are downplaying the perk hard endgame. 
---
And absolutely not is it a big deal to play with 3 perks if your 4th gives you the single biggest buff possible for a killer which all but assures you one more hook and kill.  
---
Adrenaline lasts 5 seconds.  Their haste is permanent.  You aren't running a NOED killer long enough for a teamate to open a handle unless they are a massive potato. They're just too fast man.  They can bloodlust around the loop they don't even have to mess with the pallet after you toss it.

Platform: PC

It happens randomly, i can't force it and the results of the freezing vary, sometimes it disconnects nobody and just freezes, sometimes everyone gets disconnected. 
---
System specs: Ryzen 5 1400, GTX 1060, RAM 16GB, no SSD, WD Blue 1TB HDD. Graphics driver doesn't seem to matter since the issue has persisted despite me updating the driver countless times to keep it up to date.
---
You still get to use medkits. If she goes Sicko Mode(corrupt), her vomit doesn't make you sick, which means you gotta heal normally.

It‚Äôs not a suggestion, it‚Äôs a fact. People I know use a controller to play on PC. I know people hate facts on the internet because a lot of people on the internet are mega dumb, but seeing as how some people have to play with a controller anyways (console players) and we‚Äôre trying to figure out how to help people with frankly ANY idea and hoping BHVR will pick the easiest.

Werrrrrrrrrrrk

What a difference in effort.
---
That happened in a game I was in with legion (it wasn‚Äôt to me. I had died.) two people disconnected and I was already gone so he showed the played to the hex, the two gems, and the hatch. 
---
r/cursedimages
---
He face camped all 3, he never hooked me so he couldn't camp me.
---
Did you guys see that teaser? It looks like the new killer's gonna have multiple personalities. I can't wait! The snowy map looks good, too.
---
No, but there was a shooting in Utrecht (same city the con was in) last Monday which is why they banned all weapons. Didn't matter with which material it was made, all props that looked / were supposed to look like weapons were banned.
---
Oinkx2
---
Ik this is a joke but is that photoshop Cus it‚Äôs slightly to high up 
---
I'm on PS4, the only message I got recently was a salty message calling me a dumb bitch because I'm rank 13 killer and 4k'd a group of purple and red ranks on Spirit lmao. 
---
Pick your poison:
---
Do Poorly: Baby killer
---
Do well: Sweaty Camper.
---
Haha is it bad I'm literally thinking of Billy going for a drive? 
---
but then the killer has enduring and yoinks you off a pallet
---
Not necessarily about leatherface, but I feel like legion has a similar problem. I like to play legion, (Everyone should have their own preferences), and when survivors see me walking up to them or they get downed early on; they leave the match. Especially SWF. One of them sees me and the full squadette leaves. 
---
In soviet russia the hatch uses YOU to escape
---
I wish I wouldn't suck throwing hatchets on Huntress :( 
---
okay
---
Everytime this gets me everytime 
---
Fengs and Claudette‚Äôs!!!
---
That's hilarious! I love freaking people out on Hag, I'll put all my traps in places they wouldn't expect,  like treasure chests xD
---
God hates Fengs
---
Then the situation escalates into you and the killer just standing next to the hatch for 5&lt; minutes waiting for each other to make a single mistake in order to win the match.
---
*Sob* Augh!  I- I‚Äôm so embarrassed!  I didn‚Äôt mean to block you in the basement I was trying to take a hit, Kate, no, wiggle!  Why aren‚Äôt you wiggling?!  Please, we still have 3 gens left, we need-  No, why aren‚Äôt you struggling I‚Äôm sorry, okay?!  Kate, no, no, don‚Äôt let go, here, you‚Äôve already been on there long enough...  Leatherface, no, go away, pleheeease!
---
My thought process everytime I accidentally murder my teammates while trying to take a hit.
---
Usually when I farm someone I have WGLF or someone else farmed them and I know they‚Äôre about to suicide
---
When are they going to make any good changes to Legion? It's been like 3 months since his release and barely anything has happened to him.
---
Couldn't figure out how to take cold dirt with me otherwise I would've done that. Two cassette tapes were easier :P
---
yall ever seen the video of gays playing Ft13 and one of them goes "my WIG" 
---
3 secs to run. Lol
---
They're basically saying, "Do well, but not too well."
---
Especially on console, I don‚Äôt think they have the power to ban people for simple things, they claim they can but with all the crazy shit I‚Äôve seen since playing this game for almost a year, I call bs and I think Sony and Microsoft won‚Äôt let them unless it‚Äôs something very severe. 
---
Yeah now her page is locked and I can‚Äôt put ‚Äúshe‚Äôs currently the thiccest ingame survivor‚Äù in Trivia
---
&gt; no insidious 
---
Fake
---
Look buddy, I'm not gonna camp ya, I just want those survivor masks. Just hand over all your Megs/Clauds/Jakes/Dwights and we'll all be pals.
---
Why can you insult me in a much more expressed manner if i can't do so in a humorous way to a person that prolly isn't even gonna read this ?
---
I had a toxic Laurie as Plague so I just camped her body and kept puking on her. The Claud that was still alive seemed to understand because she just teabagged Laurie's body lol
---
The next wave of Freddy nerfs nerve came in.
---
I‚Äôll always make sure the scrubs die and the team‚Äôs best player gets the hatch if someone gets it
---
Oh, i will always nod at the camera on his last hook.
---
Oh damn keep us updated on if it changes or if you get banned
---
There are some reasons on why your teammates wanna do that.
---
Youre about to enter a new phase in a few seconds (struggle or death), so it doesnt matter if you go down again, you were going to enter the next phase anyways.
---
They have BT (weak reason, I know)
---
They want to swap positions (if the killer is camping/hard patrolling, making him waste even more time staying on the same hook, making it harder to get more than 1k because it gives way more time to keep doing gens)
---
I dont mind it now that ds got reworked 
---
*disconnects*
---
This sounds horrible and yet halarious. Did it get all 4 of you? Did the killer seem confused?
---
I just bought adam just to do this build lol
---
Yeah well DS is garbage now but I'm talking about literally having a power to punch the killer in the face and stun them for a few seconds. Assign it to shirtless david.
---
Killer aint easy. If it were, it'd be called survivor. 
---
At least you tried your best.
---
I think it‚Äôs a bug. 
---
Saga and Black Science are good Sci Fi Image comics. Fables is kind of mythological and they are sometimes available at local libraries if you are near one (my local one also has a ton of them digitally). I can‚Äôt think of a great webcomic unfortunately (I like OGLAF and Dinosaur Comics but those are comedy). I didn‚Äôt read my first superhero comic for a long time either, but for me at least, a lot of other comics are pretty ubiquitious. It‚Äôs ok if you haven‚Äôt, a little impressive really. 
---
Can someone explain why many seem unhappy with the game? I just played with one of my friends yesterday for a couple hours as both survivor and killer and had fun!
---
Proper ‚Äòshitpost‚Äô. 
---
i wonder how new players reacted to The Spirit just standing there menacingly 
---
This game is perfect.
---
Way too fat

---
Still pretty barebones, but I plan to work on it tonight after work,!
---
Yeah the glitching in this game is a real anger inducer 
---
I think its time you broke up, clearly the relationship won't last.
---
I know Cornblind affects everyone but being coloublind on any Coldwind Farm makes me want to die, and that's always the realm I get when playing Killer against actual toxic survivors. It bloody sucks.
---
Ah yes, the classic console-hindered Sprint Burst... Glad I switched to PC.
---
I think so 
---
It's basically griefing. 
---
The hatch shouldn‚Äôt spawn unless a minimum of three gens are done. That‚Äôd solve most of my complaints- someone getting a free escape is less bullshit if the team finished over fifty percent of their objective. 
---
yea u camp myer üò°
---
How so when it helps you and your team win
---
Excuse me what the fucc
---
Do you mean in-game or nvidia freestyle settings?
---
Its one thing to call someone thicc with two c‚Äôs, but its actually really serious to call them thiccc with three c‚Äôs
---
A mix of boredom and a feeling of unfairness
---
pretty good job so far
---
*Hatch jumps onto your mouth*
---
&gt;  they are as overpowered as a good Nurse and don't need the skill that she takes. 
---
While I agree with the no skill part, I dont think that Legion is nurse tier with addons. Legion is high B tier with addons IMO, good chase but shit map pressure/tracking
---
I'm a survivor main and haven't noticed any real changes to the speed of gens. Maybe the new ranking system is just putting you against better survivors?
---
Throw a pebble there, and after he gets in there, block the entrance with your fat ass Jane.
---
Oh man thank god I was worried it was only gonna get you every time sometimes!
---
Yeah I feel like DH always spawns in an open field. Maybe devs did it on purpose.
---
Same as when you do a swf meme build and get hit with the ‚Äúcan‚Äôt escape swf shitters‚Äù by some godawful killer you looped for the gens running no mither. 
---
The egos of dbd players would collapse the universe with their massive gravitational pull if they ever manifested into reality.

Jesus the people in the YT comments are toxic AF. I hope you get over that cold buddy &lt;3
---
Literally what I thought as well!
---
Oh I meant the plague haha idk why it says hag I‚Äôve actually not had the chance to try her out yet I‚Äôm gonna have to try when I pick up her dlc x
---
Yeah it is lol
---
So true!
---
Hey, thanks dude. All I can say is thanks
---
The legion got a long ass head
---
Long Head Legion
---
Meh, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction it just needs some more work. Ebony mori spam and slugging billy/nurse were a big part of what made rank 1 unbearable, now the killer actually has to play the game to pip. 
---
i go friendly killer whenever im not playing survivor :0
---
SANSS???? i love screaming smash man
---
They need a new power really badly. Idk why the devs thought pressing m2 to remove a core game mechanic was a good idea for a killer, or why they thought people would actually try and wound everyone instead of just tunneling for free downs. 
---
Dont mind people that make fun of ur voice, no one should have to worry if there "Voice is bad" Like wtf cares lmao. 
---
Yeah instant karma...but lets be real those 360s were hot ngl
---
well though luck
---
she isn't doing this for you
---
Damn üòÜ
---
Lmfao! I love your logic. Explain to me why after searching for a lobby... large swaths of people decide they just don‚Äôt wanna play.... LITERALLY a half second after joining. As in the second they enter they‚Äôre already backing out before seeing the other players or anything. ‚ÄúLet them play how they want to play‚Äù he says, Did you read the post? The issue is them NOT playing ü§£.     
---
I like the effort of trying to turn my statement ‚Äúagainst me‚Äù though but poor form. How exactly would me not being able to play my own lobby‚Äôs because OTHER people are backing out, coming out of MY comfort zone? Or were you just trying to be edgy? Gonna side with the latter.
---
Potentially 
---
Clutch escape. 
---
Not long wait times, but maybe 1 working lobby and 9 broken ones in 10 tries. It's absolutely horrible since they changed the matchmaking.
---
P3 claudettes

No you‚Äôre just some child who likes to spout in like they know things. Clearly you know nothing about how a business works. How do you think bhvr pays for their employees, for licensing, and for updating their game? On top of putting resources into another game of theirs. After they bought out starbreeze, they needed a way to pay their own way. All in all you are complaining about wanting cosmetics, which now you‚Äôre admiring are useless. I don‚Äôt suck bhvr asshole, but I‚Äôm not totally oblivious to how a business runs. When a small company like them pays its devs better than Ubisoft pays its, at least it shows they give a damn about the people who work for them. As A business owner, I completely understand what they‚Äôre doing, and it‚Äôs nothing wrong.  It‚Äôs amazing how you don‚Äôt play this game, yet you decide to browse to a 40 odd day old post. Talk about backbone. As you whine about micro transactions on a game you don‚Äôt play. Maybe if you worked as much as you did talk, you could afford micro transactions for your precious skins
---
Or just leave it because it‚Äôs literally fine as is. If the hatch opens you got a 3k, which means the 4th kill won‚Äôt do shit for your pips or bp. People constantly complain about hatch standoffs when the only problem is their ego is to big to just let the survivor go for finding the hatch before getting downed. 
---
I love these names so much.
---
They really make my day.
---
still waiting for the results 
---
I think someone before posted about having infinite dead hard.
---
boredom from something specific or more general? I can understand it not having a lasting impact because of the of the inherent design of the game - it's basically one mode. I know Evolve suffered from a similar issue with its 4v1-ness.
---
Its very niche. I have to kinda be in the mood for it to be fun. Then Ill be off for a while. Then come back again. I don't give it too much of a hard time though because it was only $20 for me and it gives a lot of fun with friends.
---
I normally don‚Äôt try that hard as killer. The only ones I like are top tier and it‚Äôs way to easy to 4k now with a real build after all the buffs to killer and nerfs to survivor so now I just do meme builds or one perk killers unless it‚Äôs an obvious 4 man
---
Well the framerate in dead by daylight is capped at 60/62 fps. I would probably get more frames if it wasn't for the cap but if you're not getting those frames its probably just your pc. 
---
Have you tried running the game with lower graphic settings?
---
If you're on console you can't though
---
Ikr, I‚Äôd love to see them make a video with their voice in it lol
---
Ok, but this was funny.
---

haha thanks
---
If you use MLGA you get the exact ping even before you end in the lobby.
---
Maybe some of them are using it.
---
Does calm spirit keep you from coughing and vomiting?
---
So did you go in? Are you now in the fog? Has the entity claimed you? 
---
I use a pc and it can run high framerate but I don‚Äôt notice how well it runs dbd but for yours it looks a lot smoother. Idk if it makes sense though
---
You're missing a few more actually:  
---
\- Survivors unhooking just to get score, resulting in you getting tunneled/camped  
---
\- New emblem system motivating boring and/or solo oriented mindset (farm hooks, avoid helping with risks, avoid chases)  
---
\- Survivors giving up as soon as one mistake happens -&gt; DC/kill themselves on hook  
---
We've got a whole recipe of things to fix... but... yeah.
---
*cough cough* Only speaking about Ps4 *cough*
---
Also I'm surprised you find those frames amazing because to my eye ( I could be wrong) It seems like reddit uploads them in 30fps instead of 60. (my clip was 60 but it looks choppier on here)
---
Perfect
---
Was this on xbox? This has happened to me a few times while playing legion
---
Omg every timeüòÇü§™üòÖüòÉüòú
---
It's so crazy to me that my experience on the PS4 has been almost utterly the opposite since the plague came out. Haven't been having any difficulty getting matches as killer or survivor, and for me wait time been honestly lining up either the estimate &lt;1min. Haven't been having infinite load screen issues, no spawning into game to only see 2 or 3 survivors. I've actually been playing way more this week and having more fun than the last month or 2 just because I'm not sitting waiting for a match for 10min every game.
---
But I'm not trying to act like those issues don't exist, I watch panda stream sometimes and I see all the OPs complaints happening. 
---
Would have to see your perks to make that assessment.  
---
kk
---
Yes it was. 
---
So true haha 
---
I guess it depends of the person, you described it pretty well. I see a lot of people blaming their own boredom on the issues with the game (I dont say there arent)
---
I see it and if looks really smooth and creamy. Could it be that it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre on different phones/computer or something. 
---
Also sorry for my bad English 
---
Looks about right when I play killer. *cries in Freddy*
---
it's always feng mins. I find more toxic feng mins playing killer than any other, and most of the time I get farmed is by feng min. I *Despise* Feng Min now.

I'm not sure. You can try turning on the steam fps counter and see what frames you're getting.
---
When in-game press shift+tab, click on settings, click on the in-game tab
---
There you should see "In-game FPS counter" you can choose where you want it and I suggest you tick the "high contrast: box since dead by daylight is a pretty dark game and it would be hard to read it if it was gray instead of green.

have you seen her? we need a new letter for her thicccness
---
no worries

As a kid I was never indoors long enough to read haha. As I got older I just got into other things really.

I've said a few times that I'd love to get into them it's just were to start. And how far back to they go haha.i don't read digitally really I love the feel of a good book

Thank you! I‚Äôll try it out and see.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled at first with her, but my best strat up to date is to never take the corrupt purge, and proxy camp one fountain. This forces them to stay broken, and they‚Äôll always try and get that fountain, so you can come back and smack them down. Rinse and repeat and voila!

This hurt my soul
---
Yeah cold wind is the worst man. As soon as they go in the corn 90% of the time I loose them. Corn blindness and colour blindness is just the worst.

Only thing bad I've heard about Pratt is him being in a church that supports conversation therapy for lgbt. Conversation therapy, for those who don't know, is basically just torture while bullshit morals are thrown at you, a lot of people who come out end up with PTSD and often substance abuse issues.

I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs also the reason of the 4th guy disconnecting.
---
Some people love being toxic to the others survivors, and I‚Äôm usually the one that gets farmed when on the hook, downed, hooked again and is dying while the killer leads the farming person to the hatch because I "have prestige, [I] don‚Äôt need points". 
---
Being ratted out and then bodyblocked by a stranger is so frustrating. Especially when you can‚Äôt get the reason why.
---
As I said in my last comment, I did it once to a stranger, and I may have t-bagged, but don‚Äôt come in the lobby saying 9/11 was the best thing to ever happen (can‚Äôt remember word for word, but there was also something about "there should be more events like that") and expect people to agree with you.

I would say Claudette, but they are immersed most of the time, and watch me go into struggle, then unhook me.

I certainly don't feel entitled to anything. Obviously you're a pretentious asshole, so what's the point of getting into it with you? You've got your opinion, and while I don't agree with it at all (nor do 90% of the people posting here) you're absolutely ENTITLED to it. Do you, bud. Just spread your hate somewhere else. I've already basically given up on the game because of how sound based it is, and if you can't see why people with disabilities should be able to have accessibility options, then clearly you're part of the problem. It's not a huge game changer. I see no difference between being able to HEAR the heartbeat, or being able to SEE it.. Especially when you literally can't hear.. Point blank. Period.

---
Not at all, lmao.
---
As a Feng Main, I don't purposely farm. I only do that if the person is about to go into struggle and nobody else even bothers trying to save them just to give them a chance, then I'll try to take a hit or get the killer to chase me instead. Most of the time it doesn't work, but it's the thought that counts lol
---
haha ecks dee lmayo

If Nurse held a skull and Susie held a tape with "Frank's" scrawled on it you would have nuclear heel heat.

Don't worry guys he's just AFK

She's the only killer where being hit by a pallet gives me a warm feeling inside &lt;3.

I'm blind as fuck.

---
In other words rape joke
---
This was me. My first experience with a Myers was a farming one (who let us all escape), so I thought he was just an m1 killer. I didn't really know what his power was. A few days later, I come across another Myers and wrongly assumed he was a kind farmer. He was not. 
---
A swf group all with head on could form the ultimate meme strat here.
---
Yes, I have 3 Chinese friends and they all told me the same thing I told you lmao 
---
Honestly though killers get bullied on this game. It is fairly easy to keep a killer in a chase if you‚Äôve got an idea of where certain windows and pallets are. You can run an experienced killer around for 4 gens. Killers need a buff especially Freddy Jesus Christ that guy sucks. 
---
Most honest post in awhile. Fr tho.
---
#this isnt even remotely funny
---
This is terrifying. 
---
So who won?
---
Thing is that I read that you can‚Äôt do 360 spins on killers with 100+ FPS so idk if that‚Äôs true but that kinda deters me from changing it because I regularly try to do 360 spins when I can.
---
As a hatch main:
---
since when did they nerf the hatch? when the hatch opens it makes no sound now...WTF???
---
Hopefully just a rare bug and not actually an unreachable totem
---
Wait, what‚Äôs this legacy business? Never heard of it.
---
if i thought their names were funny or if i thought they were cute they generally get the hatch from me
---
other than that i usually treat everyone the same and i try not to tunnel unless i find the hooked person by accident, because by then, it‚Äôs your fault for not running away
---
Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt. It was a tunneling Huntress.
---
I like how you can't adept without that 2 pip

I wish I was that good at photoshop!

Yes, 360‚Äôing is still a thing

Rank is slightly more meaningful the skill gap is pretty gradual, you won‚Äôt see a difference between a 13 and 14 but you‚Äôll definitely see a difference between an 8 and a 15, yes it still resets 
---
Wraith is mid tier, after a buff and an add on rework he‚Äôs a lot better, Freddy is still low tier

The joy of hitting the uninstall button!

That's awful, wtf
---
Thanks I‚Äôm Australian and my first language is English and I still fuck it up thank you 
---
well, i hate noed and ruin bacuse gets destroyed too fast, and i dont want to play with 3 perks
---
It isn't. I think the reason why a survivor main is better at killing than living is because you KNOW what the survivors are going to do, because that's what you would do in the situation.
---
That would be equally scary, enjoyable to play as and easy to design (anchor as a weapon would be sick too). Great idea!
---
Oh that actually makes sense
---
Is this the part where I say Nani!
---
I understand the Devs are human, but they also have access to statistics that should show trends in terms of point acquisition/gameplay stats etc to facilitate finding a balance for systems like the emblem system. This is not the first time the pipping system has been reworked, it has gone through several incarnations at this point. And, yes I agree to a certain point, we as the players *do* tend to complain in abundance but these "complaints" are also feedback for these developers to polish a game that obviously everyone in this community enjoys and loves to a certain degree, myself included 
---
 maybe stop tunnelling one survivor all match and go push others off gens and you won‚Äôt get ‚Äúgen rushed‚Äù
---
quit this game
---
u wil save time and mental health

---
-These things have become more powerful. I fear they might be able to bend this world to their will eventually.
---
Not all killers like barbecue *pig cough cough*
---
And then you create the killer and survivor in game for us? Or what 
---
"The killer must be Hillbilly. I hear something that sounds like a chainsaw revving, and I see a blurry shape in the distance moving at incredible speed."
---
\*suddenly, the Shart comes zooming at them at 235% movespeed, propelled by the sheer force of the gas spewing from their ass*

She‚Äôs pretty easy, just run loops tight and keep your eyes on her or her stain. 
---
it took me almost an hour to find a survivor game with another player the other day.
---
How is it that the game has been our for years but there's still no party-feature? why do I have to invite people after every single game we play, or more likely, after every single dc.
---
I invite, we search for 2 minutes, get into a game, killer dc's. 
---
the SWF button is now on cooldown for 5 seconds for whatever reason, I invite again, we get into a game, we both have 800 ping.
---
I invite again, search for 2 minutes, I get some random EAC error
---
Cooldown, invite, search for 2 minutes, another 500+ ping game
---
Cooldown, invite, search for 2 minutes, killer dc's
---
Cooldown, invite, search for 2 minutes, we join into a lobby where we're now 3 people waiting for a couple minutes before just leaving because something is clearly not right
---
Cooldown, invite, search for 2 minutes, oh wow looks like we finally found a lobby where both of us don't have 300+ ping, 5 minute loading screen and its just the 2 of us against a huntress with oneshot hatchets
---
Great experience, haven't turned my dbd on since
---
Plus killer is stupid easy anymore
---
My favourite bit - personally - is just staying close to survivors as Tier 1 Myers and scare them shitless.
---
Still cant escape, wraith standing in the middle of the hatch invincible..
---
Agreed. I put the controller down and that was very hard. For me, the game is dead.
---
Lol expected, unoriginal, unconstructive reply 
---
Nope, this is as good as it gets for me. Retiring as a champ and only playing killer from now on.

Aside from the usual suggestions of BP based on where you ranked at the end of the season and lowered prices, I‚Äôd like to see them to the whacky route.

Add an item to the bloodweb similar to the mystery boxes but it‚Äôs like some sort of gambling themed thing. When you buy it you have 50% chance to unlock everything surrounding it and 50% chance for the entity to take it all and start moving from there. 
---
Or make it so unlocking a teachable gives everyone the level 1 version

No, I'm on pc but I use an Xbox controller

I actually remember the first time that happened to me. I was talking to my brother and said "oh shit she sees me but she's just standing still." Then she pops up right in front of my face and scared the shit out of me!

*"BOLD STRATEGY COTTON, LET'S SEE IF IT PAYS OFF"*
---
thanks for the gold kind stranger
---
Nice man sounds like you done good then.  Grats on your first rank 1 post pip overhaul 
---
The problem is they wanted to make ranking up harder, but didn't stop to think that maybe, just maybe, the entire system needs a complete revamp.  
---
I will say, though, that one good thing came out of this. Now, I don't give a single shit about rank, because if it's going to be this harsh, with absolutely no rewards or benefits, then that's just one less thing on my plate to worry about when I play the game.
---
If the killer is across then by the time he gets back should be healed or both should be out of the area

The gens you want done quickly are the last 2 gens.  Not the first 2. Stop wasting your toolbox on the first gen that you come across.
---
Do the gen without the toolbox and use your toolbox to finish the last 25 percent.  And save about half of the toolbox for the last 2 gens.
---
I agree. The last two killer releases have been amazing with their aesthetic and story, but horrible in their gameplay. In comparison I loved Spirit cause there was actual counterplay. 
---
I personally dont feel like there's engaging counterplay to the Legion or Plague besides "lol don't get caught". Contrary to popular belief, staying broken (and vomiting loudly) the whole game is not a counter. Otherwise No Mither would be meta.

I'm not saying she (or legion for that matter) are overpowered, just unfun to play against.
---
Megheads and Fengs do this so much. P3 Clauds do too. Never had a Nea fuck me over though.
---
Not with killers like hillbilly or nurse which is primarily what I face at red ranks. Again, this is not targeting every killer just common play styles I've seen. 
---
It's the way they made it harder that is the problem.
---
Wait why ? Hag doesn't need to do hatch stand off ? I don't get it ?
---
Hag can trap the hatch
---
Give this man a gold please :D

I didn't say that I expected you to be okay with it, I said its rude to demand people to get better internet. If I turned around and demanded you do something you would think it's rude. People have other commitments, some people don't have a lot of money to begin with. I was saying that messaging someone demanding they buy new internet or accusing them of using a lag switch is toxic. If you think they're using a lag switch report them or leave it. It's a game.
---
Stick with it if you think it‚Äôs fun! You‚Äôll definitely get better. I was the same when I started just a couple of months ago and I‚Äôve already gotten loads better. 
---
Bubba is THE best killer to wreck swfs. Lightborn, mad grit, agitation &amp; BBQ loadout stops any survivor fuckery in its tracks. 
---
What am I even looking at?
---
Because the conversation was about getting the achievement for Rank 1, which any player easily could have gotten before this update. Only new players to the game will have a hard time unlocking it with this new system.
---
Oh, well... He was such a scary Myers, too, like in the movie, ahah: 0 terror radius, victims everywhere (2 died and still no generators done! XD), hex ruin on, a knife used almost like a silent machine gun and oh! I still have no idea how he saw me behind that column: I'm not ashamed to say that I screamed like a little girl, there, and my boyfriend and I looked at each other like two idiots, still amazed! XD 
---
Well you found the hatch it seems its locked do you have they key üòÇ?
---
Lately, everytime I play killer, I end up being silly with the survivors. (Playing hide and seek, following them everywhere at some distance like a puppy, chasing them without actually hurting them, etc). We always end up laughing in the end chat and usually give each other out discords or just add us on steam. I have made a lots of friends and its really cool ^^
---
The tunneling Huntress :(
---
That's pretty damn cool.  I like how they're both coloured according to their "item rarity" level too.  Very clever. 
---
Thoughts on going

Going off on to bitch ass

All I can think about is how the hell their eyelashes aren‚Äôt stabbing each other..

i am happy that i got leatherface to level 35 today and got bbq chili teachable
---
To be fair, this is more the Brawl Minus of DBD balancing. I mean did you see the autodidact buff?
---
i'm interested to see you say this because i honestly feel this patch has felt the smoothest in terms of optimization, aside from the obvious bugs. i play on a laptop and had to mod my resolution to be lower than the lowest preset and i still wasn't having smooth performance, but this patch feels really smooth and actually good to play (again, aside from the obvious bugs). i wonder what's up with that difference across hardware.
---
Throw up on everything if your being looped. 
---
I love when they used to T-Bag me for 20 seconds straight. It was really helpful
---
It's a perk that works with overcharge and ruin, doesn't it ? Sounds great but since Killers got very good perks already, with one shot and aura reading, i don't think that would make its place in the meta.
---
You are seriously still complaining about DS after the nerf? How about don‚Äôt camp/ tunnel and then it‚Äôs useless. 
---
And yet, here you are on another cosplay pic, offering yet another observation of no use. Boring.
---
I'm more pissed off with how easy it is to depip. I think it's okay to make it harder in high ranks to get a pip, but it seems like your average game (1 or 2 gens and unhooks but gets sacrifices) will heavily punish you after all that work.
---
DsXL üòÇ
---
Hello there.
---
I agree. Its too bad my feed is full of lame shit like killers dabbing and noed reworks.
---
There's no penalty. See league of legends pre Leaverbuster. This game needs to issue increasing queue times for quitters. First time, you get to wait 5 min before you can play again. DC again in a 72 hour period, it's 15, then 30, then an hour, etc. It works, it's ready to do, but the devs just don't care.
---
Cursed comment
---
Guess you should find somewhere that's more your style, right? Might be better than wasting your time giving an opinion that nobody cares about.
---
Me too.
---
It sure feels that way. Particularly when I don't care about winning and am just trying to do a ritual.
---
Heaven forbid someone has different experiences.
---
Won't disagree with the grind, at this point in the game it is just far too much for how much they have now. But the getting good part is very false I think. Once you get a little map awareness and get used to the jungle gyms, as both killer and survivor, it'll be much easier. Just watch some tutorials. 
---
Wait to vomit on survivors until you have them in relatively close space and in super close proximity. Also, practice aiming the vomit so that you can get them to the Broken state sooner the without having to repeat as much. 
---
Yeah I can see it in his name. What a pathetic loser. 
---
Hey maybe if they start doing body searches theyll check weapons aswell and allow them again.
---
Yes, listen to this guy, we legion mains love when you can down a survivor with one normal hit üëÄ

Oooh I'll have to give that a try, didn't think of that, Thanks!  What perks do you use on her?
---
Thanks.  A good list to look back on for other killers too :)
---
As one of the advocates of "Ranking up is too easy, they need to make it harder" I'm actually a big fan of the new ranking system to be honest.
---
In fact, I think they should go a step further and make it so that you can double depip if you really suck. So, instead of -1, 0, 1, 2, the system would be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Any system where you can never fail as much as you can succeed will inherently reward mediocrity.
---
Tbh, I think that we're dealing with two sides of the community here. There might be some overlap, but I doubt the same people who were complaining about ranking up being too easy, such as myself, are the same ones now complaining about ranking up being too hard. I imagine it's two different groups within the playerbase complaining at two different points in the game's development cycle.
---
Of course, given the current mood of this thread, I imagine I'll get downvoted to hell for this :P
---
Thanks :)
---
Oh btw update me on it when you do
---
Imagine being you. 
---
Basically when you kick a gen, the linked one also get's the regression as if you kicked it, also it gets effects like overcharge and pop goes the weasel so the idea is a way to be applying this efefcts more often without wasting time getting to the other gen with low mobility killers.

Maybe he has slower movement speed but recovers quicker from stuns because of his equipment. Maybe he can inflict survivors with the bends as his special power or something

---
Damn thats sexy! How much did it cost? (It's okay if you don't wanna say.)
---
Idk I still find ranking easy. I usually pip when I die still and almost double pip when I escape. Although I like to do everything and not just urban evade around. I do think they need to change boldness, cause I should be able to at least safety pip of I run the killer all game and not be forced to de rank cause I wasn't able to do anything else. 
---
I saw this happen with a NOED totem on Puppers stream the other day. 
---
The music is generally creepy, wish it works play instead of that stupid shit it plays 
---
I'd be for reasonable requirements if it didn't regularly match red ranks with legitimately new rank 20 players. As it stands, what's the point of a stricter emblem system if that's going to happen anyway?
---
Yeah, I agree 100%. They need to iron out the problems of the new matchmaking system immediately 
---
Thanks.
---
I'd be happy to have them remove the hatch grab mechanic if they reinstated the hatch-shut mechanic that was tested in the Clown PTB.
---
That way, if the killer finds the hatch first, he can close it. If the survivor finds it before he can close it, they deserve to get away.
---
bUt iT‚Äôs a vAlid STraTaGeY
---
&gt; quit this game
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; u will save time and mental health
---
I second this. Perhaps come back when Dedicated Servers are released if this game survives a possible catastrophe that might happen in the hands of BHVR.
---
When I started playing DBD back in December 2018 this game was somewhat stable and the player count was rising.
---
Nowadays you are lucky to find a match because it will take ages to find a decent lobby and when you finally do, it can crash or will start with less than 4 players. 
---
Consoles will always have a shitty performance but speaking strictly about PC, performance (general FPS) started going downhill after clown DLC and devs couldn't care less about low / medium end rigs AND even high end rigs are having a higher performance usage than they should but without the proportional frames per second that it should deliver.  
---
Isn‚Äôt there an item that makes you see where you blink

---
LEGION WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
---
Woah WAIT!... is it daylight to you!? Wtf!!
---
I wanna be a killer main but survivor is more fun rn. I‚Äôm not even good at jukes but it‚Äôs frustrating playing against mid-green ranks as a low yellow killer
---
Just tried it out. 360s feel weird and not normal since the frames aren't consistent. every frame drop you feel and just makes everything awkward. whenever you vault or get hit the frames drop a little and you feel it.
---
I wouldn't recommend uncapping your frames
---
It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs strong, it‚Äôs that if he chases you, you‚Äôre pretty much guaranteed to go down. He doesn‚Äôt have much counter and if they run franks your ass is grass,
---
Dude amen, that sounds great. Would the survivor still be able to open the hatch without a key if the killer closed it? 
---
Why do people get so salty whit that shit? To me is just stupid lmao
---
I had an afk farmer on PS4 a few days ago, and another a few weeks before that.
---
Do you mean if you get facecamped or you face camped?
---
Didn't think of it, but perhaps they should be able to. With the same amount of time as it would take to open a door, yeah. 
---
That gives the killer enough time to catch them doing so if necessary, or to lose them if they're being dumb about it.
---
With speed limiter id say pretty decent ye, they nerfed survivor (needed) but they nerfed the fun out of them (removing pallet vaccuum and so on) instead of upping the time to do gens, which is the problem with survivors.
---
If vaccuum was in the game, but gens took lets say 100 sec instead of 80 id call you a GOOD player
---
Botany does. On other survivors. Unless they all run No Mither.
---
Yeh another nice little change would be if you got a unhook after your first hook that instead of struggle you get another first hook stage to use it. Killers who keep track will know you have it when you dont go into struggle on your 2nd hook. And it wont be a wasted oerk just because you got found first. 
---
Yeah reminded me of 106‚Äôs movement animation
---
That'd be nice too, but the perk is not nearly strong enough to warrant an exhaustion status.
---
I hate this bug, it makes me stop Everytime I press my sideways buttons and I can't walk in a circle

"Hillbilly wants to know your location"
---
That would be a huge buff to deliverance.
---
And how would this be just as useless as pausing the game to check the offerings? 
---
Weird way to spell "Vommy Mommy"
---
I feel like I‚Äôve seen this before? A movie? A show? Anyone?
---
Because you can see them right before the game.
---
Selfcare/no mither/pharmacy/ and adrenaline is one of my go to meme builds. 
---
It‚Äôs a bug but until it‚Äôs fixed it is an unreachable totem spawn. 
---
Not if you‚Äôre on the hatch so you bodyblock. OP isn‚Äôt escaping without a standoff 
---
The only real problem is depipping when the killer DCs the second the trial starts  (usually the killer do it to rank down and have easier trials). Survivors shouldn't be punished when the killer decides to leave the trial.
---
IMO if you never meet the killer during trial you should also get an iridescent EVADER. This means that you managed to evade the killer perfectly.  In one hand it would reward stealth players ( the ones that escape without being chased at all) and also prevent depipping by killer insta-DCs, as shown below: 
---
1 iridescent UNBROKEN = 4 points
---
(Escaping without being downed)
---
1 iridescent EVADER = 4 points
---
(Escaping without being chased)
---
1 bronze BENEVOLENCE = 1 point 
---
(Initial benevolence value)
---
0 LIGHTBRINGER = 0 points
---
(No generator/hex done)
---
Total = 9 points, resulting in a black pip
---
Mine are still dark af, on maps with dark grass like Mother's Dwelling they literally blend in with the grass
---
Damn dude gg. Had a bug like that where I was killer and was near a gen that popped at the start of the game. So the audio of the finished gen became this highpitched loud tone for the rest of the game. Just DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRR loud af in my headset. Couldnt hear shit over it. 
---
He just wants an arepita with cheese
---
Idk but I remember nurses wedding dress veil causing extreme fps drops
---
thanks for the advice

Lol it do be like that

As other poster said, she keeps her normal collision box when puking. Plague is very scary when basementing people, you can just bodyblock the stairs until you get everyone exposed then down them all. STBFL will let you down 3 people before anyone makes it to the door.
---
So your complaint is with the pathetic little shits who DC, not the killer. They are the problem.
---
I think of the 4% the same way I think about survivors spawning in front of a hex totem. 
---
No one thinks "oh going to let him have his totem for a little while because I don't want to ruin the experience for the killer". 
---
What most think is "that's really unfortunate for the killer, but I'm still going to cleanse it".  
---
me when browsing reddit and get too far down into week old posts
---
lol nice. where is this from?
---
Thanks for taking the L instead of DCing or getting in a locker to deny Myers the achievement. If that's what he was going for anyway, I'm getting a bit of PTSD and also happy memories looking at that final tombstone kill.
---
Good one.
---
Dedicated servers couldn't come any faster. High ping is def an issue.  
---
Had about 3-4 survivors since last night get hit once and DC lol  
---
Facecamping... ugh, lets be real here guys, this needs to be prevented big time.  
---
Theres nothing fun to do but do gens and pallet loop, can we get something different?   
---
LASTLY the shack has 4 hooks in the basement. WHY do we need 1 outside of the shack too!?
---
Back when the game was (newer), it was harder to level, the web was bigger in most levels. So they decided to reduce them, but awarded people that had prestige with ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù prestige costumes. They wanted to be ‚Äúentity‚Äù touched but didn‚Äôt want to make them black because that would be an advantage(harder to see). So they decided to make them glow instead.
---
If Im on hook and them fkers are crouching 100miles away doing each others fkin hair (not even a gen or healing) while obbession is getting chased the other 100miles away with no gens done. Imma do it. 
---
No DLC means no money. No money means no paychecks. No paychecks means no developers to do fixes.
---
Fixes are important and will come- but they are paid for by DLC and cosmetics.
---
It might not be an ebony, and it could be a shroud if separation. Chill out, and just play the match. If you really feel the need to DC, don‚Äôt do it before the game, because then there‚Äôs no chance of pipping 
---
That's what mean when they say *"don't get yo wig pushed back" ü§£ü§£
---
Also doesn't help that this game's new matchmaking throws higher ranked people in with the newer people.
---
i just think an increase to the time window for the stun and it not having the 3 second requirement would make it great. 
---
I only said removing the exhaustion wouldn‚Äôt be a great idea because imagine you‚Äôre in chase, the person you‚Äôre chasing kept their exhaustion as close to refreshing as possible with Sprint Burst, and they hop in a locker, then hop out, stunning you, and then sprint burst and dance with me away. Lithe and Dance With Me is already a great combo against killers that can‚Äôt keep a LoS on you but I don‚Äôt want a second one. I‚Äôm a survivor main and it just seems unfair.
---
I never realized how giant the huntress‚Äô axe was. Great cosplay üëç 
---
Projectile diarrhea perk when? pls BHVR
---
Gahh
---
That would be a very good change. In its current state, dbd caters to killers waaaaay too much and I 100% hope they nerf op perks like Leatherface and Hex: Nobody escapes the dead. Maybe a buff to adrenaline? The sprint burst you get can last until you escape? Also make you immune to Hex: Nobody escapes the dead. Thoughts?
---
I truly do wonder what goes through the mind of the average survivor main
---
Casual
---
EXACTLY! The game is super broken and must be attended to. Killers are far too powerful. 
---
Why are you trying to make people feel less special? That‚Äôs rude. What are you trying to accomplish with this post? Lol

&gt;I‚Äôm not having any trouble with console. 
---
Most people that say such thing don't understand shit about hardware performance. An easy example are streamers, 90% of them don't even know what components they have but whenever a question about performance is raised they answer with "I don't have any problems". They have never used a hardware monitoring tool and as long as their game isn't running as slide-show, they will say its fine even if it isn't. So yeah, trust me, console performance is shit even if shit is a good standard for you. 
---
They play games at 30 FPS or less and go around saying "it runs fine on mine". 
---
Try hard
---
It's a double edged sword. If it stays alive, it slows the game down immensely but usually it breaks within the first minute, making it a wasted perk slot.
---
Whaat, I already look like a midget standing next to the 186 cm (6"1' if I'm not mistaken) person I know. x)

You can't keep exhaustion low, it pauses in the chase.
---
You won't get 3 seconds of waiting time in a chase, the killer will just grab you. And even if they don't grab you, then can just bait it out.
---
If you're a human main, you're living life on easy mode
---
&gt; Just spread your hate somewhere else.
---
wat? how am i spreading hate? all i did was disagreeing.
---
&gt;  I've already basically given up on the game because of how sound based it is,
---
now you're beginning to understand. thats literally the games design. the mood, the music, the background noises, all of that is a big part of the game. you want the devs to change the experience of playing the game for the whole playerbase.
---
&gt; if you can't see why people with disabilities should be able to have accessibility options, then clearly you're part of the problem.
---
as i told you, i am disabled too and i clearly disagree with the accessibility stuff. having a handicap is annoying, but the only thing it changes, is that you are less likely to be one of the best in a certain game. no one forces you to be competitive. just play for fun. the game is how it is. either live with that or dont play it. 
---
oh, and dumbing down games for more accessibility slowly kills every game. just look at what happened with games like world of warcraft. everyone can experience every part of the content, but its no fun.
---
Thanks! I used a French Curve for the eyebrow contour... since I‚Äôm a guy who doesn‚Äôt do brows
---
Even so, sprint burst probably be enough to get hatch
---
To make money or not to make money. Must have been a tough choice for them.

Smells like a glitch to me.

Thanks, that means a lot. 
---
It wasn't horrible until yesterday. Why the new change?
---
Mission failed, we‚Äôll get em next time
---
Well anyway, we can see offerings on the pause screen so why not see Rituals on the pause screen. Seems quite simple, and easy if you have a chase daily or something.
---
Seriously. I hate this game with every burning fiber of my being. I have said this before but this game is like drugs. The bad kind. It ruins your health and well being... also makes you question your sanity... but I can‚Äôt stay away from it...
---
Just mori lol
---
Oooof. Nurses at that rank are something else. 
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Screw you, pal. 
---
So more licensed characters
---
You don‚Äôt have to use the nurse if you don‚Äôt like her. Just because someone says the nurse is the best killer doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt do better with another killer
---
I can't make the noise he does. Someone help me out. Give me SFX! 
---
A lot of players have just realized they're a little more average than they believed. Not everyone is top tier. Follow some high level streamers, they have been able to maintain rank 1 and 2 after the update. 
---
Hey, pizza Dwight.
---
They shouldn't take away progress for **not** facecamping nowadays, but they're certainly damn keen on that too. 
---
Does doing that mess with EAC at all?
---
Quite ironic that Freddy is in a place thats burning.

Yw just some old gamer from back in the day when you had to put the tv on Channel 3 or 4 to play super Mario brothers and the Internet wasn‚Äôt available to the public, I think the military at the time was the only one.

You play often?
---
P3 Claudette, Iron Will, Urban Evasion 
---
Just spam teleport button and then M1 immediately after teleporting.. although they will more than likely crouch to the hatch since they know it's a hag.

well if licensed characters mean that they won‚Äôt fuck up on balancing then yes

Where was he going with the survivor if someone was already on that hook?
---
üòÇI bet the window vault thing is pretty hard to actually do tho
---
Yes! I was thinking the exact thing when you said it needs a rework. It should only give a stack when it‚Äôs a safe unhook. That‚Äôs how they should have made the perk to begin with. BHVR does not think ahead clearly
---
Ok I added u üëç
---
It's all practice. At some point, blink distance will just become an extension of yourself. It's all about knowing exactly where your blink will go, and then it's just down to survivor games. ~~I don't really have anything specific to say~~ about her, it's just about practice.
---
So I remembered a few things:
---
*  Change the direction you look when it fatigue so he top right/left of your screen can look where the survivor is going, so you keep the most vision
---
* Always listen after hitting a survivor to the scream to know where they ran as you go into fatigue
---
* If you don't play survivor, try to for a while, as it helps in predicting where they'll run.
---
* Her standard (1^(st)) blink is 20M, and each chain blink is 12M
---
* Fatigue is 1 sec, plus .5 sec for each chain, and 1 sec for swinging after blink (regardless of if it hit)
---
* As with all killers, know when to give up a chase, or slug a survivor
---
* Since you move slower than a running survivor (96.25%; 3.85 m/s), you shouldn't be afraid to blink
---
* Do a brief 360 after each blinking when trying to find survivors, go through the WASD keys to ensure you keep moving in the desired direction while doing so
---
* Looking down will decrease your blink distance, even if it's fully charged, unless there is a floor below you, in which you'll blink down to that floor instead
---
* She can also blink up on floors; useful on Gideon and Distributed Ward. It can also be wonky if  the blink destination is on top of map geometry (like not moving you to that floor, still unsure about this)
---
* After a blink, during the chain blink window, you'll know when you're about to go into fatigue when a white haze fills the edge of the screen. Don't immediately blink when this comes up if you don't want to, but use it to gauge how long until you go into fatigue (similar to how in a racing game you use landmarks around the race track to tell you when to brake for a turn)
---
* If you're charging a chain blink and don't want to use it, hold the charge until you go into fatigue (it won't count that blink in fatigue time)
---
* If you can, and once you get to the ability to kill someone in a  game, then record your games and play them back to evaluate mistakes. you can also watch good nurse mains once you get a grasp with her to see what they do.
---
* Whenever chasing a survivor, make note of what, if any, jukes they use against you so you can counter them; try to get in the survivors heads, making them second guess everything they're doing.
---
* Some map geometry is impossible to blink through. This is (usually) the devs fault, and you should make note of it for the future.
---
* Some map geometry is just wonky, and can be blinked through, even if difficult/non intuitively. Make sure you don't accidentally classify something like this as impossible.
---
I have more that I could probably put, but would be very specific and not super helpful for someone just starting. Feel free to ask any questions you might have. :)
---
I'm trying to remember...
---
Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Freddy, Bubba, Clown, Spirit, and Pig all leave a survivor facedown post-Mori. 
---
Nurse, Myers, Doc, Huntress, Hag, Legion, and Plague leave 'em face up. 
---
That guy was almost always moon walking, once he decided to let us live: at a certain point, it looked like we were playing "spot the Myers", with him moon walking from each corner of my generator location! The whole match made me laugh a lot, truly! XD 
---
Damn, that's solid advice. Thanks
---
With someone it a trap? Yep, but somehow I managed it! 
---
I know what you did last summer, anyone? Fisherman with a hook 
---
No. I mean, it's far from the only perk that's still in need of an overhaul. Dying Light certainly does, but hell if I have any ideas...
---
Both of them are pretty hard to pull offüòÇ maybe u were having a bad day
---
What perks you using?
---
Nurse's calling, sloppy, spies and ruin
---
Or it was Karma 'cause I taunted first lol
---
Sorry for a late reply&gt; I currently use Nurse's and Deerstalker every game, and the other two switch depending on my mood and the survivors.
---
Franklin's is good if they have items; Sloppy and Coulrophobia are both potent for slug builds for piping; Devour Hope if it look like a gen rushing quadette squad; Ruin, Overcharge, and Intervention for better gen pressure; Third Seal to fuck with non-SWF's survivors; and Knock Out for even more slug.
---
Sometimes I'll do even more strange builds, but those are some of the more common perks I use.
---
Hmm idk then, I'm pretty sure the black outline goes away when using perks that affect fov like shadowborn and monitor and abuse 
---
ew xbox
---
It‚Äôs like a crime scene for DBD lol. Can‚Äôt be the Hag or Legion, officer; victim still has her guts.
---
I know Freddy isn't the best killer, but I think he's a ton of fun. It's like a whole other game when you use him, it's refreshing
---
I thought this would be something where you stayed, got hooked, Kobe‚Äôd then 360‚Äôd and escaped with a tbag.
---
But it was not and that is good
---
Thank you. You know, this all stemmed from one match were a trapper with DL literally ignored everyone else to chase and then face camp me. If he had ran STBFL it prob would have ended better for me...I ended up DCing right before my hook timer gave out because I wanted to waste his time. 
---
I also don't know how it could be changed, but it does need change. 
---
not really, I just thought it was funny. I even depipped at the end of the match since he chased me the whole game no one got hooked and I didn't get any generator points...
---
Oh well I don't mind I had my fun
---
I was waiting for a hatchet through the window
---
Yours is convoluted and forces people to do one thing and doesn‚Äôt flow gameplay wise 
---
gimme those freestyle settings buddy
---
So anyone who plays DBD has no valid opinion. K. 
---
You are literally the type of survivor i love. Ones who has there fun and doesnt get mad when caught.
---
Leatherface is the best camper. Hes power can down multiple survivors. I think people do it just to do it. Ive never seen p3 leatherfaces camp. Its always the non bloody ones that do. Probably a killer main letting off some steam. Or doing a basement build which is also fun. 
---
What is that?!
---
i dont know why games dont just treat it like a win for whoever doesnt DC. if you're still there, you clearly didnt DC and deserve the win.
---
I got hard watching this
---
Can confirm, did this during a game about a while back. Did not expect to get him. I usually only get one survivor per game that remembers to crouch, this one wasn't them.
---
No no lol I like her don't get me wrong xD i just have a really hard time with her. I just need practice is all. I main Spirit tho. 
---
Her ass is out of proportion with the rest of her body. It doesn't even look natural, but god damn, *she is thicc tho*
---
He's a disgrace, I assure you. He doesn't get that that's why you defend hooks using traps :)
---
I see this meme a lot, about the wait times, but they've been accurate for me on PS4
---
I hope my ruin spawns there
---
You forgot the link
---
Fuck that shit
---
Jokes on you buddy, I play both and suck regardless of which role it is
---
#relatable
---
That's P4 Claudette morphed into a giant Meg. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
/s ?
---
PSA: This is fake. OP did not alter the Wiki article (and better not try it, I'm not forgiving with the ban hammer in cases of deliberate vandalism).
---
When you kill all survivors this is the final boss
---
Damn..... So that‚Äôs what that patch was for
---
My current build is sloppy butcher, shdowborn, nurses calling and bbq and chilli. I was thinking of trying and getting infectious fright for nurse for that seems quite good
---
....to another hook!
---
But seriously, you can see he was still in the pickup animation
---
Vic shows no signs of lacerations to throat or face... can't be Pig or Doc. 
---
Usually Claudettes most of the time or Jake.
---
I know everyone loves Jane for being thicc, but cmon guys, show the girl some love in other ways. I'd say she has the most personality out of all the survivors, and her vocie sounds serious but also feminine. And her face model looks perfect, a good thing that also develops her character.
---
Fite me, I've got infinite puke.
---
Nice play, yes, but dead hard to avoid a hit is pretty common. 
---
correct, I just went into inspectüòÇ only altered it for me without having to go into photoshop 
---
BHVR pulled a sneaky in all of us. 
---
Good job at getting the first video clip of what the entity looks like!
---
Yeah lol.
---
You're good!
---
Paige is the plague IRL so she should know, when not dying of McDonalds.
---
I see nothing to laugh about in this. It's immature.
---
[this is my reaction](https://streamable.com/for9n)
---
Turns out the Hag is actually Woolies grandma, he refuses to play because he knows what he's messin' with.
---
umm it‚Äôs a shitpost.... that‚Äôs somewhat the point
---
it will end your suffering faster lol. To be honest though I don't think it is that HUGE of a deal because dying light sucks. It forces you to go after 1 person for so long that you don't put any pressure on the other survivors and they gen rush though the game. Yes it does ruin the game for that one random obsession but my point is that it is such a bad perk for killer that you shouldn't see killers running it at all. I understand you probably had 1 or 2 bad experiences where this happened to you and 2 bad games can stick with you longer than 50 good games. But realistically unless killers are running a mori that perk is pretty bad. 
---
Trapper main law is blunt on the subject. Facecamping is punishable by death in Basement. 
---
You gotta let em have their fun mate. They'll eventually leave your wiki alone. Its not like they going to call Jane thicc forever.
---
I like her personality and all, but I like her personality better from behind 
---
Turns out the Entity is actually a P4 Claudette.
---
Balanced landing works after being drop? I didnt know that. Guess i dont need sprint burst to run. Lol
---
Still no rewards, fucking genius!!
---
I don't care. The Wiki is dear to me as I put a lot of my spare into keeping it up-to-date and expanding it and I severely dislike people vandalising it, be it just for jokes or real.
---
As a killer main I mainly player killer
---
She's the most difficult killer to use by a significant margin. It takes discipline, muscle memory, and pure skill to master. 
---
Is that a chin hair I see on the Huntress? A true Russian babushka I see! 
---
Ok, Kate, how would you feel if I didn't appreciate your backstory and other qualities just to look and compliment your behind? Would you feel good? 
---
Freddy and leatherface are pretty ass so no, license doesn‚Äôt equal quality.
---
Exhaustion pauses while running. I meant using sprint burst, keeping exhaustion low, Q&amp;Q‚Äôing into a locker. When the killer finds you out, you hop out and zoomies away. Won‚Äôt work on killers who know what they‚Äôre doing or arent expecting it.
---
Spirit is better anyway (I‚Äôm also a spirit main)
---
I didn‚Äôt change it thoughüòÖ
---
Did I not understand the joke?   
---
No, it's the OP that's wrong!
---
Yee
---
I don't even really like the idea of free moris from offerings. I like When I have to work for it with devour hope or something.
---
Use Scratched Mirror, M&amp;A, and L√©ry's. They will *never* see you coming. 
---
I don't care. Leave the Wiki alone for your jokes.
---
this happened to me as survivor and was curious if the killer saw the same thing or if it just looked normal, thanks for confirming 
---
His name could be The Drowned. 
---
YES EXACTLY!! Also, killers get bonus points if all of the survivors quit but survivors dont get anything, we just get penalized and deranked :(
---
I don‚Äôt wanna sound rude or blunt, but, dang, she could be the new Mrs. Thiccson (Not an insult, I actually think she looks beautiful in her own right)
---
Not sure what a have trap arm is, but if you are talking about not triggering her trap, you just have to crouch and move towards it without getting up. 
---
Well, she‚Äôs dead already so idk why it would affect her.  Then again, so are at least some survivors....
---
I put away $500 for it, but I was told that was a good bit lower than what he would've charged me if he'd had a better 2018, sales wise.
---
You are a bold one
---
I know there's enough people who don't find screaming funny.
---
I'm not one of them. The girl's hilarious as hell, i demand more videos.
---
10/10
---
I had a game like this eariler, but unfortunately the game rewarded the bad killer with noed so my teammate died when we were  both trying to open the gates. &gt;;[
---
Oh dont forget, if the killer quits.. NO PIP FOR YOU &amp;you get de-ranked
---
gotta love killers who run noed.
---
badass! You planning on getting any other horror icons tattooed on you?
---
Where‚Äôs the funny little edit? I‚Äôm interested
---
Looking for advice: how do you use LF's chainsaw effectively? Charging it slows you down so much that survivors are always out of reach by the time it's ready. 
---
I don't think it would be that good, as with Nurse you're not really focusing on the terror radius like you are with other killers.
---
but i get 5k points and get to harass him on his steam profile
---
Kennedy Davenport: girl get ready, they gunna me-me your ass to death bitch
---
I mean when it gets triggered my character faces towards her clone and freezes in place, like when I run up to save a person from hook and I proc her trap my character won't let go towards the person, but idk.
---
Yes that would be great i would even be okay with it being reopenable just make it take a while and set off alarms to the killer
---
People are always way quicker to talk about their negative experiences than their positive ones
---
A little bit ago I played Hag, Claudette annoyed me all game vs Nea, who was nice and non-toxic.  I downed them both at the endgame and knew if I picked one up the other would survive, Nea only got downed because she went back to help Claud.  Guess who I let out
---
I actually would rather die on the hook than getting unhooked while the killer coming back. 
---
Thank you! In all honesty I'd love to get some more scattered around for fillers 
---
Does that actually work ?
---
what in the sweet name of jeff johansen
---
Did you just accidentally press e 13 extra times then?
---
Lmao but is it worth it??üòÇ
---
Is it pronounced ko‚Ä¢bee or ko‚Ä¢bay
---
Know your enemy! 
---
You know how survivors act and think, you use that knowledge as a killer! 
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I am better at dbd stoned too! I feel like I try hard too much if I am sober.
---
God I wish I was Myers
---
This whole thicc thing is annoying and clearly people are gonna use it forever on that character. Hope the next new female isn't thicc but instead sticc. 
---
I totally agree with you! We were at the totem, with the strong conviction to be killed at any moment, at that rate, ahah, but that Myers guy, who could have easily killed us, laughed at our silly moves and had fun with us! XD Totally worth it! XD 
---
How do you make your settings not reset? Mine keep defaulting :(
---
I dont but in glad to know others feel the same way.
---
Should be a survivor who has no face 
---
How was the after game chat like tho?

Ko-bee for Kobe Bryant, Ko-bay for Kobe Japan.
---
what is 'suvivors who deserved it for 300 Alex?'
---
Well worth drinking to. On me? 
---
Amazing how this wasn't seen as a problem in testing 
---
But which is it named after for this game? Kobe as in shooting a low percentage shot or kobe as in rare meat.
---
This is how 2/3 of Freddy matches end. 
---
I play killer 95% of the time and I go against people who gen rush the fuck out of me and know how to run every loop. But sometimes I do get those games where you 4 man 5 gen cause no one has any idea how to optimize
---
Both concepts mentioned in the title are amazing, they could do a ‚ÄúThe thing‚Äù dlc and have R.J MacReady and The Thing. Morphing into other killers may be dicey tho
---
Well, keep in mind that despite what people say, rank matters to some extent. I dont have to try to win at rank 15, but at rank 1 i can get a little sweaty for that 4k. Overall though, their are just alot of incompetent killers.
---
This is the reason I stopped using my no mither build. I miss it but not the constant hurt music!
---
I escaped through the hatch in the bottom of the temple small room with two lockers. 
---
3rd guy hooked: I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess
---
*laughs in Freddy*
---
Hardest killer is nurse, spirit is one of the strongest, and is fairly easy once you get used to her.
---
I've seen the hatch once on this map just outside the temple on concrete floor by the walls. Have no other way to describe it lol 
---
So survivor is easy? Is that why there are no more red rank survivors yet all the killers are still ranks 1-3? Weird.
---
Bricky said Spirit is harder.
---
i love the addition of the totem at the top right and i dont know why 
---
 Because a lot of players aren't as good as they think they are
---
Sprint burst is actually a pretty terrible perk , you can't use it when you really need it. And forces people to walk around the map in order to not use it. 
---
