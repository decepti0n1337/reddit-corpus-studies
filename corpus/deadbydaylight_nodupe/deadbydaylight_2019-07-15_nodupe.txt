He looks like baldy Dwight.
---
---
---
You get more points towards it if you do gens solo, you share the points if you do it with team mates
---
I guess Wes Craven is a liar then. Its not like he specified that he was kid killer not a molester or something. I dont know where he got his info.
---
Done and done.
---
probably one of dead by daylights MANY bugs
---
Theres like a 2% difference between rank 15 and 20.
---
Well they can also ban you if you contact a player through live and abuse them over the game. Are you sure you didn't do that?
---

---
I don't play consoles at all so I have no idea how easily you can message people on them. But I know if you do it on PS4 you're done.
---
I just don’t get what it means by communication abuse when there’s no communication support? :’L and they can’t ban in the game for messages sent through Live.
---
If you're not doing anything wrong survivors being toxic shouldn't affect you
---
If you facecamp or tunnel, well yea I'm gonna call you a cunt
---
I think Legion because he doesn't have any insta down potential when using his power
---
exactly why it’s the fault of dead by daylight, unfortunately
---
You have to be running more or less in a completely straight line towards the vault with atleast 2.5 meters between your running start point and the vault. You also have to input the vault command before your character physically touchs the vault. If your character rubs against the vault any before you input the command you'll medium.
---
What does bm mean?
---
I think because of his buffs recently he's better than a few
---
Join the discord and play swf its a great opportunity to bully killers
---
Honestly I don't think anything but the big franchises have a chance at getting in. My Bloody Valentine, Dead Silence etc don't quite have the draw of any of the licenses we already.
---
Not at all, they’re not allowed to ban players from their game for ‘communication abuse’ if the abuse doesn’t happen in their actual game. Xbox Live messaging hasn’t got a single thing to do with BHVR so they can’t ban you even if you were to be abusive. That’s Microsoft’s job and why communication bans for a day or week are a thing on Live.
---
BHVR literally CANNOT ban you by any means of what you’re doing isn’t done in game. So if they have banned me for messages through Live then they’ve gone far behind their actual rights as a developer
---
I don't know what else to tell you but run straight at the window. Either the arc isn't big enough, or you're not running straight at the window. If you're diagonal, or you're pressing directional side to side keys, you won't fast vault.
---
Now this perks works very well i think this is new meta because a lot of killer start chasing another before putting you on hook
---
Aw, having the billy deluxe are ya?
---
What on earth was Doofy's motivation?
---
I think Nurse is good
---
Ahhhh shit
---
Too OP. Entity has no chance against God. Go with Homura-chan.
---
Probably R tier tbh. Gets looped so easily.
---
Doing all of them is a lot of doing nothing since you have to walk around and find them. By the time they're all done, all gens and saving could've been done
---
Fortunately you hadn't already used it before this happened.
---
New Killer: Homura Akemi
---
When you message a dude trying to be toxic as payback, you just sink down to their level. Keep that in mind Replii
---
You do realise you can close it by clicking on the arrow? It won't open again until you press the arrow once more.
---
Also, speak for yourself with the whole 'it's almost NEVER used positively'. There's plenty of times players are nice rather than mean.
---
The hit was to his dignity.
---
Seems fine to me its bad when you're at rank 1 and see two level 20's with a rank 1 survivor after killing them.
---
It’d be hilarious if Chucky got added!
---
Rank 20 immersed Claudette watching you get camped
---
You're not wrong. Face camping or tunnelling killers are cunts, and often do it because they perceive survivors to be toxic, when all survivors were doing was looping them for longer than they liked.
---
That being said, if you actually call someone a cunt in post game, you're eventually going to be banned when someone bothers to report you for it. Enjoy.
---
The game is fair.
---
[removed]
---
I don't know because her power is so strong meaning if you know what your doing you can be OP
---
Yeah, but Legion can at least guarantee a first hit, regardless of anything else, and can essentially keep the survivors injured all game. Leatherface is stupidly weak to looping.
---
Very good sporty lesbian cosplay
---
You don't need to stop lol, otherwise it would be op af
---
Absolute bamboozling
---
They would complain about teabagging instead.
---
You can still be a nice killer and win the game.
---
It's actually very hard to balance this, since time management is basically what playing killer is all about..  
---
Adding time to the generators would be helpful! (but adds other problems)
---
* Game going on to long
---
* Fast killers even better
---
* Hex:Ruin even stronger  
---
A good change in my opinion was the change they did to trapper, where they let him put traps down faster.
---
I think looking at slower killers to make sure that their ability is efficient enough to "waste time on" is a good way to approach this and also more fun for both sides.
---
Her and Billy are probably the new worst. Legion and Trapper are probably S or S+.
---
Xenomorph would be so great tho imagine that crouching like piggy but crawling on the floor and all that would be awesome
---
Survivors can play with an emphasis on avoidance, stealth when the Killer is near, and relying on juking, pallets, or looping to help them in a chase. They can also choose to focus on teamwork or playing more independently, and cleanse totems or rush gens.
---
There will always be a top meta most people are too unskilled or cowardly to deviate from (and in the worst cases, where everything else is ACTUALLY inferior), but Survivors have many more options for approaches and strategies than most Killers, especially when the limited options for Killer include camping and tunnelling and both are frowned upon.
---
I agree about Leatherface he is a pile of shit
---
They can't ban you for harrassment through a different medium? I highly doubt that. Do you have a source for this? If not then it sounds like we know why you got banned
---
Freddy?
---
And that means *literally* next to nothing in terms of being representative of the entire community. Your personal experience on one platform (and in a specific rank range) for a limited number of matches doesn't really have statistical validity.
---
why dc?
---
They stated themselves in the past they can’t issue bans for actions and the like that take place outside of the game such as Xbox Live messages and PSN chat. Because it’s in NO WAY related to their game.
---
As long as its not permanent, it's cool. 90% of the playerbase is toxic so I doubt I get many reports
---
If you slug to mori, you don't deserve it imo
---
Yeah, you really are.
---
What excuse do you have to DC? The killer beat you all fairly, and then tried to use an offering.
---
C’MON AND SLAM, AND WELCOME TO THE JAM!
---
You forgot about the Bee and a special highest tier for him
---
do you lose any points for dcing?
---
Memes aside Freddy wasn't even the worst killer. That easily went to and still goes to Leatherface
---
Yeah but I could honestly care less about em
---
I always tell people that learning how to run basic loops is the single most important survivor skill by like, a mile. Although it's fine to play stealthy you will not always have that option
---
I thought either Leatherface or Legion
---
Cussing back at toxic survivors is where the fun begin.
---
I never dealt with a spirit who found me at gen before so I don’t understand half this stuff
---
It's there for the Claudettes that self care at the corner of the map to remind them that there's an objective
---
The perfect survivor doesn’t exi-
---
Yep.
---
And you know why.
---
Maniac Cop would be great, actually. And Pennywise would use fear-inducing illusions, so he'd be able to pull off an alternate Doctor that punishes Survivors for looking at him.
---
Pinhead isn't actually an active Killer. He just...keeps people from bailing on his S&amp;M club.
---
Wishmaster's pretty human. Give him a skin for the greasy dude in 2. But I don't see Tall Man and his stupid balls?
---
Oh, and calling cowardice on every Too Tiny. Chucky, Leprechaun, and Gremlins let's go.
---
no problem asking!! good luck and have fun :)
---
Well, then whatever. You're not an asshole. I just like points, personally. Does dcing get you banned? I wouldn't bother. When shit like that happens I just have a hissy fit to myself or walk away.
---
Actually no. The first game I ever had with legion ( like 2 weeks ago) I got a merciless (sadly I didn’t have 3 teachable perk slots but once I did get them I got the award)
---
Yeah I mean all the killers in the game literally kill people, hence the name killers. But we're talking about a real life person here, not the fictional characters.
---
FOOKIN GENS MATE
---
If the cellphone company can say Im not allowed to tether data I bought from them pretty sure BHVR can ban you from playing a game they cteated. Is it legal? Maybe not but companies bank on you not lawyering up or them having the better lawyer everyday.
---
I was gonna say "not seeing post-chat salt makes me big angry"
---
OG Freddy was explicitly stated to be a child MURDERER, and apparently there were interviews where they said they explicitly moved away from him being a molestor.
---
Reboot Freddy, however, is outright a molestor.
---
What BM mean
---
I had a survivor message me at the end of the match apologizing for looping me at the gate while the rest of his teammates got away, and we chatted for a bit before playing some matches together as survivors and now we're friends. It was really great day after that!
---
&gt;Lets teammate get up to find me (pretty sure this is reportable)
---
Lol, it's not, unless the other survivor and killer were then working together. The killer has the choice to do with the survivors as they wish, slugging included. 
---
And yes, you kind of are an asshole. How could you not be one, since you DC'd out of the game simply because you didn't like how it was going? That's entitled behavior.
---
Maybe Pennywise gets a cut of the sacrifices. Entity gets the despair, Penny gets the meat.
---
I already said i was wrong.
---
Oh I didn't realise I had to, if it's a problem I can just remove the post.
---
Dang, nobody's using a pickaxe either, right? And that movie's Canadian.
---
Blackula.
---
I'm pretty sure that's the main reason we have the Miner cosmetic for Trapper.
---
I know I just wanted to use it lmao and the first 2 kills were done by hooking twice and summoning entity. The last kill of the 3 was where the mori was used.
---
But he never had a single iconic zombie he re-animated, did he? It could be interesting if they made/commissioned an OC Killer to be a result of his formula, though.
---
It's the PTB my dude calm your tits
---
Shiny Face is confirmed now too iirc
---
Don't fight toxicity with toxicity, fight it by not giving them the time of day. They want reactions, that's giving them a reaction and giving them reason to do it again.
---
Angela's too weak as an active Killer, though. Her advantage was nobody knowing it was her.
---
The Thing uses the same advantage, and would immediately have all the fun ruined by SWF voice chat.
---
It means bad manners.
---
Yep made in Canada and no one use a pickaxe as a weapon so he has a high chance of getting into the game.
---
It's very interesting to hear from a killers view, so thanks :) I have gotten some comments from killers telling me I am sneaky af, and that is because of spine chill, since I see when the killer is coming haha
---
I can see the clickbait titles now... OMG DEAD BY DAYLIGHT EASYER EGG FOUND IN GTA 5!!!!
---
He didn't exactly deserve another kill if he used reportable tactics to do so
---
Legion, honestly, they need a rework from the ground up. Deep wounds are an absolute joke right now, feral frenzy is only viable against healthy survivors, and most of the interesting add ons aren’t worth running (exception bring iridescent pin)
---
Yeah it is lol no problem!
---
-Can't attack male Survivors unless they unhook one of his captives
---
-Free Mori against male survivors at second down
---
He just wants to live a quiet life.
---
I couldn't agree more I hate his power
---
I apologize for annoying you, that was not my intent 
---
this might be the end of Trash Panda 
---
I bid you Adieu
---
Hitting an injured survivors while in frenzy downs him? Let's return to no counterplay legion again!
---
I wish they'd just combine the shit with We'll Make It, since it's not a teachable and synergizes nicely with WGLF's purpose.
---
Thanks, I agree with you, what is a perk you would trade spine chill with? Any perk for any survivor? A perk you feel that is much more worth it than spine chill?
---
Lol ikr, what a loser, quits immediately after a game ends. So lame that he isn’t cool enough to make some BM in game a personal matter by taking the time of finding the guys account and proceeding to message him.
---
People like you are why survs are considered overly toxic
---
ah okay
---
Wouldnt the survivor who (allegedy) ratted you out be the asshole then? The killer even killed him so who cares? It's a cypress mori. You're still being a little child by dcing.
---
At that point, just give the Entity a Killer form.
---
"She's strong enough to do it herself."
---
It's an excellent perk, it will absolutely save your ass against sneaky killers or killers with large terror radius.
---
Some killers will know to look away from you when they're sneaking up on you to catch you unaware but pretty much only if they know you're running it, and it really counters Ghostface.
---
Crybaby.
---
"What is your wish?"
---
"I wanna get out of here!"
---
"Done!" *Sacrificed*
---
Sorry for the little rant, I normally don't do that but that rank reset isn't being a good time.
---
Inb4 "NOED noob baby killer": I'm trying to learn the hardest killer, on console and with some Parkinson to help, give me a break!
---
It's a fantastic perk with no downsides and hard  counters Ghostfaces and Pigs stealth  and sorta micheal from stalking you to get to tier 3.
---
He was picking me up and dropping me for about 1-2 minutes, I tabbed out but saw I seemed to recover?
---
As long as gens is how u win survivors will rush them. I think whatever you add it has to give alot of points for survivors to bother or it has to be a win condition. Back in the early days when people leveld up jake it was because sabo gave tons of points and was useful like u mentioned. but sabo meta got very unhealthy and was changed. 
---
Im sure they could make something better for survivors but i think looking into underperforming killers is way easier.
---
The only way I would see it as a nerf is if the survivors recognize the killer has the hex and they would never break it then. Making the killer has permanent debuffs all game. But if it was used with like Ruin or something along the lines and they break this hex perk before ruin, the killer would get a nice buff. 
---
So kinda like making people think if destroying it is a smart move or not.
---
im aware just its a tier list about other killers and how likely they would be in DBD. Just seems odd to not include Jason
---
Because the same fucking haunted ground repost isn't ?
---
What a fucking loser. If you’re reading this billy, you’re a fucking loser.
---
He was too embarrassed to handle the chat lmao so funny
---
https://media2.giphy.com/media/gxo5uqrtOCA5G/giphy.gif
---
Pls no keep it up it's the only fresh meme this board has
---
I don't know how OP can see himself as anything but the asshole in this case? Like you lost the game,  would it kill you to let the killer take an extra 10seconds to finish off the mori? Did you really have to be petty and deny him those extra points, and deny yourself all your points?
---
Well, it's a B-movie, and they seem to be very A-list about everything. Plus, they seem to want to enforce a serious tone even though the game is extremely goofy in practice, and the kills in the original Valentine were over-the-top.
---
That's a shame. They're missing out on some great opportunities
---
The question seems ridiculous. I could maybe understand if the killer was cheating, but all they did was beat them.
---
Honestly I’m behind this 100%. That makes loads of sense.
---
Definitely buff other perks. 
---
Ruin is RNG based due to how the totem spawn ends up. Add to that, survivors can still muscle through it by just landing skillchecks. 
---
And BBQ really only puts one survivor in any danger. So as long as the killer chooses to follow up on someone else's aura, you're safe.
---
Meanwhile we've got stuff like Spies From the Shadows being a bummy version of Whispers. Hex Third Seal is useless. Knockout just serves to confuse solo survivors. Devour Hope is outclassed by Make Your Choice, which also can't be cleansed. Distressing only works on Doctor, Territorial Imperative and Monstrous Shrine only work if you run Agitation. Agitation is a non-factor outside of basement builds.
---
I could go on, but nerfing the 2 "best" killer perks isn't fun or fair when everything else needs to be paired with another perk to be good. Enduring/Spirit Fury, Tremors/PGTW.
---
Let it be known, I think that most killer perks in the bottom tier still work better than most bottom tier survivor perks. Things like Technician fucking suck and stuff like Buckle Up never come into play.
---
Pretty much.
---
Invite that player to another game and this time don’t take it easy on them, but also don’t be toxic. They will realize then, that you were basically taking it easy on them. Then again, they’d probably accuse use of being OP or hacking. :/
---
Well...there's no chance. He's with Gingerdead man.
---
I like running spine chill sometimes when I don’t want to get surprised by stealth killers. But I also like running different perk builds. If your goal is to survive then I would run meta perk builds such as dead hard, decisive, adrenaline, iron will, and Medkit as an add on. There are plenty of builds you can try. There are fun ones and sweaty ones but experiment and see what you find to be fun
---
Hey I enjoy the HECK out of these edits, but I think you should link back to the original creator as well, yeah?
---
Probably by the time the next chapter releases or shortly after

I think the game is great but you will run into one of its many downfalls. I think it would be a great game for you to get into. As for progression, it’s more of annoying grinding, in my opinion, than true progression.  I hope you give it a try because I sure am glad I did, despite its problems!
---
I think you forgot, "Stuck in lawsuit hell"
---
F for Jason.
---
Didn't know James Harden had 2 jobs.
---
what a complete dipshit
---
Nice.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I'm not really sure. The screenshot I posted was someone being really toxic and to kms so maybe that's why I was told to blur names. If a mod hasn't said anything by now though for yours you should be good to keep it up I'd imagine
---
The "Too Human" category should be removed.
---
See Legion, Pig, Huntress, Cannibal, Hillbilly, Shape, Trapper, Clown, Ghostface, Plague.
---
All of these killers are humans without any supernatural powers. Their origins include being creepy as fuck and killing people. That's it. (with the exception of Plague, she killed no one) 
---
Nothing in DBD states that the killers have to appear inhuman. In fact, BHVR pretty much said it was mandatory for killers to be humanoid.
---
But the thing is anything that happens outside of the game cannot by rights be used against you IN THE GAME. I normally tell people to hit gud etc, but I never swear as Xbox is bad for comms bans. So I hardly deserved a ban in the game for stuff outside of it. And if they have banned me for stuff outside of the game they’re literally going way beyond their reach, that shits up to Microsoft, not BHVR. I might email Microsoft support and get a higher up to sort things out as this is honestly bullshit.
---
Yea but isn't Ghostface a serial killer that takes selfies with his victims and gave a thumbs up to a security camera. They honestly don't care about seriousness anymore plus they kinda ran out of A List movie killers besides Jason but the creator is having a legal battle with who owns the character which makes that off the tables currently.
---
I added u but I’ll be on around an hour or so if u see me online feel free to send me a party inv or something
---
I understand slugging to avoid DS or lure in Survivors but that just being a dick and wasting everyone's time
---
Love it
---
It can be released at any Tuesday in the following weeks.
---
Revoking your consent to the privacy policy should prevent you from accessing the game, as it means you could easily screw with the game files to implement cheats or custom files that are used for the same purpose. Team Fortress 2 had an issue where all custom files were allowed, and specific players knew how the source engine worked, implementing custom models and textures that could be seen through walls, working like a wallhack without using a cheat program, so they restricted the use of custom files. BHVR’s privacy policy allows them to simply monitor your files and ensure you’re not adding anything that could be seen as harmful (hacking, scripts, etc)
---
With triple Claudette aswell (:
---
June  23rd.
---
It's June 23, confirmed by devs.
---
Is there a chance he was waiting to be taken by the entity or was he just an arsehole all game?
---
&gt;It's June 23, confirmed by devs.
---
link?
---
*Are you sure about that*
---
Looks like you were being a dick and got what was coming to you
---
It’s the opposite for me. Most games involve me looping the killer for five minutes, gens go off, I get downed with noed and then I sit on the hook while my teammates t-bag and flashlight click by the exit.
---
This post helped me to recover a bit from that god-awful post yesterday about tru3ta1ent bitching about people trying out mid/low tier killers with builds but get bullied from survivors and therefore just use "viable" killers/builds for because of it.
---
As if survivors don't try out fun or new builds like luck/looting for some fun only to run into toxic tunneling and camping killers, and then play dumb on why so many survivors run Adrenalin, BT, DS, and usually an exhaustion perk for a fourth slot.
---
Yeah he cant compete in red ranks.
---
Slug is very valid and useful tactic for getting a 4k baby or trash survivors are the only people who complain about it because they want the easy hatch escape which they usually don't deserve. If you dc during a mori you probably are a toxic asshole who doesn't deserve to play this game
---
Unbreakable saved my ass so many times 😂👏
---
Does it mean you keep hunting the same survivor over and over to kill them quick?
---
Your what?
---
...very.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
Spirit a killer in dbd that with the right addons can grab survivors without letting the survivors know
---
Yet we're currently in July 🤔
---
Yep he is! Unfortunately not with his classic robe like I was hopin for.
---
Where did I insult?
---
Yeah that’s what it’s supposed to mean, but a lot of survivors say they’re tunneled just because they don’t survive the match
---
I will admit to feeling sorry for nurses who get the map rotten fields map. 
---
Corn, Corn Everywhere.
---
Even if they WERE teaming (and it doesn’t sound like they were because he killed the other guy) what do you have to gain by DCing at the end of the game? The killer gets all of his points (plus a quitter bonus!) and you get none of yours. Just take the mori like a man and move on to the next game.
---
Entity responds with New Killer: Kratos
---
This game still needs the ability to just disable post-game chat.
---
I forgot about that scene thanks for making me remember
---
If they used the way I mentioned, then the report would have been made inside the DBD game, ergo the report would go straight to BHVR, not Microsoft.
---
as far as I can tell we don't have a survivor for that yet
---
IMO the grind is quite addictive too, if it wasn't for the grind I would quit long time ago.
---
Once he's setting the survivor on his shoulders is the moment to start the blind
---
Fukin' smack the bitch
---
its not, its procedural generation
---
Thought he was trying to poop on him
---
I'm rather new but how did I recover? 
---
The person was trolling so I tabbed to reddit, I saw them playing around with me (picking up and dropping) and saw I recovered.
---
Is that something that happens without me doing anything over time?
---
Do it, the game is very fun and addictive, especially if you are into horror movies. The gameplay is deep with a lot of hidden mechanics and every match is unique. Also it's cheap and you don't need to buy dlcs since all the best killers are free to play and the rest you can get through playtime.  There's no reason not to try it at least. One thing I'd mention is that it's more more like a game of tag than hide and seek.
---
No, thats low enough they will. Do this at Rank 5+ and it will not work nearly as well
---
Literally every streamer lmao. Facecamping killers and disconnecting on first down as survivors. I really do wonder if they think they'll ever have viewers playing like that
---
Did your mother not hug you enough?
---
Congratulations you played yourself.
---
thats the one we need
---
Idk what it is but killer is way easier and chill for me. Playing survivor is way too stressful and I find myself rarely escaping. But I also get spooked too easily, so there’s that.
---
You uploaded this earlier, OP.
---
He was an arsehole all game and he was pissed in the chat after confused as to what happened to him.
---
wait, you can blind with the clicker?
---
Or 2018 Laurie Strode.
---
Not trying to throw shade but there is a huge difference in tone between above and below rank 10, and then an ever darker tone going into red ranks.
---
Oh okay, assumed that was what you meant.
---
If the killer drops a survivor, their struggle meter gets filled by 25%, so if a killer does it 4 times in a row, or when the struggle meter has reached a certain point, you'll break free.
---
Personally when i'm killer i never really mind getting flashed while i break a pallet. I usually feel like they're mostly wasting their time.
---
because they have no argument and downvoting someone makes them look wrong.
---
&gt; Me: I was lagging too it's not a one sided thing
---
So you, the host in a p2p game, which has by definition 0 latency, were lagging?  It very much is a one sided thing, which is why dedicated servers can't come soon enough.
---
No worries man! I didn’t realize that I’d gotten the name wrong and couldn’t figure out why I was getting downvoted by folks. 😂
---
"have some new car smell" is probably the thing that made me laugh most today.
---
I don’t see how that’s throwing shade lol. I play on PS4 usually staying around 6-10 ranks on both surv and killer, but I’ve been to rank 1 on survivor before.
---
Would LOVE to see Pinhead in DBD  "The Demon", "The Sadist".  Always thought he could have an impact on the hooks
---
I know I flaired it wrong
---
yes I was lagging, it barely happens but I do lag as killer sometimes and I still don't know why
---
Ah, TIL
---
Thanks
---
Yea i know, it's just annoying hearing this every day, I get 6 good games and then a game like this.
---
Can't forget new adam!
---
I think ill have a BBQ with Chilli, with a side of Hex Ruin, maybe with a Iron Grasp and some NOED for desert!
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it
---
Whelp, over here on PS4 messaging people outside of the game is the only post game chat we have so I guess there's a lot of toxic people 😂
---
It was funny. But I’m not gonna support him in any way shape or form
---
have some..(pause).... gas.   
---
he run out of ideas. LOL
---
See guys, killers can suck too ya know
---
I mean both perks are perfect example of Behaviour's way of "solving issues" so I most likely should've mention perk for both sides.(Althought meanwhile Ruin can be actually somewhat usefull if it stands for longer than 10 seconds. Buckle Up is the biggest insult to survivors there could've been)
---
Sometimes I get startled when a generator pops.
---
that's the definition of some games out there and that's why those games fall
---
How can you tell that?
---
I love legion, before and after the nerf. I main them because I like their lore, design, and playstyle. (Persistent but not overwhelming) they can essentially take a person out of the game, chain it to two, you cut their productivity in half. They have some of the best tracking in the game. I just wish they kept speed increasing add-ons. However, legion has kept up in purple ranks for me (not long but I got a few good matches) otherwise legion is solid mid tier killer, flourishing in the green ranks. If you throw bamboozle on legion, your ability is improved greatly, cutting loops and basically guaranteed to take someone out of the game for a little bit. A lot of people don't realize bamboozle effects legion's fast vault speed in their ability also, just not on pallets; vaulting is faster than breaking pallets anyway.
---
Rank Reset means one thing for me: weird ass addon build time. Try Reverse Wraith or double Shadow Dance. 6m TR doctor or PWYF Piggy speed crouching.
---
No. There's achievements on PC related to rank, but for some reason they never got ported to ps4.
---
Oh brilliant, what a mong😂😂
---
Altruism: 100
---
Objective: What are they again?
---
it's better to have fun with it in my opinion, just nod and say yes
---
That stun can be used against survivors too. I've blocked windows during it and the idiots stay trying to do their vault giving me a free hit. Also after they already have deep wounds, they'll still try to 360/180 you so I stead of swinging just cancel and watch them run around you the entire stun in a circle. It's quite entertaining
---
What's wrong with certain "too human"
---
Like dude, most killers are regular people with murderous tendencies and deadly weapons. I want to see Herbert West or Jack Nicholson tbh. Also, what about Matt Cordell from Maniac Cop?
---
Holy shit yes. Freddy was mid tier before the rework, people were just playing him completely wrong
---
Dead rising 2: off the record is really good, its a nice continuing of frank.
---
I agree
---
What's ''Behvr''?
---
Wrong subreddit, OP
---
Get a side of Borrowed Time instead. The Mettle Of Man here is gross.
---
Same
---
We need Sunglasses Freddy AND Speedo Quentin
---
Thank you!
---
did you noticed you need only 1 sec to stalk, when mayers needs the whole match and the survivors counter its 5 times more than the stalk time ?? do you guys even think what you writte ?
---
This makes no sense

Me at my meat at 3AM:
---
The only buffs I think they need, is if you miss a hit and you get taken out of frenzy, you only loose half your gauge, or if you still want the entire gauge depleted you can miss one attack but the next miss takes you out and depletes your gauge completely. They also would benefit greatly from the speed increase add-ons that are now killer instinct range
---
I wouldn't say Freddy was mid-tier, but there was a good killer in there, the devs just had to dig him out. If the devs had removed all the bullshit survivors could pull on him, Freddy would have been just fine. There was no reason to completely scrap his power and start over.

Please delete this. It's so cringey.
---
Well, Sole Survivor is a perk that has an interesting concept but it's kinda similar case as with Calm Spirit where there isn't enough perks/add-ons for killers to fit the scenario of "revealing aura of one man standing" just so survivor could use Sole Survivor ane counter killer's thing. Buckle Up is just a spit in the face of all solo survivors despite devs saying multiple times that they want to bridge the gap between SWF and Solo.

Shadowborn spirit fury ruin and devour hope
---
You can even see the little twitch when she pops up lol
---
3 small buffs were all he needed to be A tier
---
1. No action progression in the transition
---
2. Longer base range on the power
---
3. He gets pulled into the real world when the gates get opened.
---
Fixes every problem he has
---
She got me good haha
---
Are they going to officially release a Stranger Things DLC? You’re talking like they’re going to.
---
Ah, that’s why I was confused. Thank you :)
---
No, i hit rank 1 and never got one but i did feel accomplished
---
We're kinda getting Hoffman as a cosmetic on Wednesday though. One of Pig's new outfits is based on Hoffman
---
I like that humour
---
That's my theory for legion, they originally were survivors, except frank, but they snapped and went feral, thinking everyone had a blade or was trying to kill them, so they decided to kill first
---
Not confirmed.
---
People are basing these assumptions ENTIRELY on the fact that BHVR contributed to making the new Stranger Things game.
---
That’s what I thought. It’s getting incredibly annoying lol
---
If they rework his perks, I at least want Vigil to recover from Exhastion while running
---
Dis good, daaaamn good
---
He just means he ran him for a bit after all gens were completed
---
Agreed. I'd love to see some of the survivors from the series, but people are reaaaaally clutching at straws here.
---
Is this an Ace cosplay, or just a real life photo of Mark Ruffalo?
---
Awww cute
---
It’s true. Plus with how easily things have been accidentally leaked before (ghost face, ash, etc etc) I’m pretty sure we would know something for sure lol and they had already had the roadmap for releases well before their little thing with Netflix, so I’m sure they wouldn’t suddenly change previous plans. I also don’t see even a full chapter coming from the show, as I’m not sure how it would all fit within the lore of the game so 🤔
---
Yea it’s just sad tbh hell its gotten to the point where people think it’s the most toxic community in gaming because I saw WatchMojo had a video about the top 10 most toxic game communities and the amount of people in the comments saying DBD should be on the list and be number 1 was insane (WatchMojo’s shitty videos aside they were pretty spot on on that list)
---
Freddy already killed her mom as a sorta revenge. So it would make sense Freddy would go after Quentin next lore wise. After all, Quentin's father did throw the molotov cocktail that burned and killed Freddy
---
This is pretty much everybody who uses DS in purple and red ranks
---
The problem is that the amount of killer choice from the show is limited. People keep suggesting the Demogorgon, but his lore wouldn't work with DBD, and the power would just be old Freddy.
---
It's more about the fear of them being a clicky clicky SWF group fully prepared to bully me. Again, just my own anxiety. I'm not saying flashlights are inherently bad items.
---
A few of those clown cosmetics disturbed me

Self promo never goes well on here, bud.
---
Yeah, I’ve heard it’d be something like a dime store Freddy/spirit. I just think the tone of that show and this game are vastly different, and that’s why certain licenses are skipped.

As I say, I'd love characters from the show as solo survivors, but a killer just wouldn't work.
---
Adrenaline is retarded good
---
Thanks man-
---
Thanks! And sorry fairly new to reddit so I don’t know much about it 😅
---
Pyramid head though...
---
No way to balance Kratos. Just give 'em the Blades of Chaos from 20 feet away. Camp with a ring of lightning.
---
In addition to their awesome perks (not discounting their skill) they also get the benefit of the grease. Every game has its grease. Some may call it cheese.
---
Flip-Flop is decent if you have tenacity, and MoM is only useful if you're extremely altruistic.
---
We don't have enough info into what happened this game.
---
It is possible though the survivor (OP) teabagged a shit ton and brought the BM on to himself. 
---
(Also don't necessarily expect OP to admit to it even if he did)
---
Ghostface is a weird exception so far, probably due to popular demand, but I feel like they'd go to the trouble of adding Death from Final Destination AND yield to demand for Chucky before deigning to add a B-lister, since the DLC Killers are added to make money, not necessarily to be fun.
---
Either Legion or doc imo
---
Imagine a fucking floating Myers mask running towards you and stabs you with a floating knife. Id piss myself
---
Yeah no problem same too you
---
God I wish parents did their job properly
---
Considering last years summer event was in at least late July early August this would probably be most accurate.
---
5 All the way. I obiously want to get pips, points, and to escape, but I really care most about actually having a fun time.
---
You admit defeat respectfully and acknowledge you screwed up...   
---
I like you
---
when I read this I can only think of jojo.
---
When she carries me to a hook I never struggle because I don't want to leave her arms.
---
Just straight ended this mans career
---
What rank was he?
---
I want Jason so much though.   
---
Just imagine if he were in the game, we would have the Slashstreet Boys!
---
This guy has the right idea, you gotta give them what they want which is a free unhook, I'll initiate another chase while someone is on hook, if I don't see anyone bill go back to the hook as soon as they're rescued to apply pressure to two survivors, if you're in the terror radius, chances are you ain't doin gens. Also if I'm chasing, I'll give up chase immediately after seeing someone else and I'll get that person down while the one I abandoned heals.
---
Well Playing this game just makes its second nature.
---
Really hope the guy who made Jeepers Creepers sells the property to someone.   
---
No controversy if he doesn't get paid, and I f\*\*king love the creeper
---
What game is this?
---
Thank you so much!
---
Look at any list of reasons provided by any reputable person. His strengths are basically he gets one free hit, then he is a trapper with no traps. He sucks. I wish he didn't suck. But he blows
---
Freddy was given his powers by dream demons. They could take it away at any point.
---
Before rank reset, I got to rank 5 just so I wasnt set back to like 15 or anything. Continued to 3-4k every game. I find him really good. Not nurse level good, but good
---
I didn't realize this was a photograph until i looked more closely at the face. Nice job!
---
Hahaha this is amazing, that’s what happens when you try to long out the game and tease people. He knew if you quit you’d lose your BPs so that’s great karma on him!!
---
I think the "too human" category is valid. Legion is basically just teenagers in a mask
---
I've seen that, if someone gets sacrificed while you're crouched, that will spawn nearby for whatever reason. It could be woke crouched it while in stealth, I've only seen it with GF
---
twitch streamers only use real, viable killers.
---
Look how dark the game used to be, lmao
---
But can you run really fast?
---
Survivors are the power role.
---
Like u/spartaren said. This wont end well and will just end up being downvoted to all hell
---
do you even think before you comment? This is over a month old, there were several changes, chief
---
I found the issue, I mean I didn't really find the issue, I reset my computer for the first time in 9 months and DbD stopped lagging as killer
---
Well he gets countered by OoO,Spine chill, Premonition, Dark sense kinda kindred and decent awareness plus once the survivors know it's Ghostface its way harder to get the stalk off and needs good Add-ons to do well. In my opinion he's overrated, simple and his ability is easily countered in my experience.
---
She probably just thought you were a baby Myers, lol.
---
why was the EGC going at normal speed with you down?
---
Same. I don't say I don't love Susie but something about Julie intrigues me and I can't put my finger on it. I'm hoping for some nice cosmetics for her in the future
---
I go between Whispers and Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Have a friend I play with that loves to teabag every game and he always gets away cause he takes no damage the entire game since he doesn’t do shit but boy was it fucking hilarious the day we went against ghostface for the first time and he got insta downed cause of it right by the exit lol
---
Says the killer mains that get every sodding perk nerfed into the ground.
---
 I was spectating a game with Ghost Face and his “revealing” audio glitched after he started chasing Dwight. Definitely increased my heart rate when it went off and kept going lol
---
Haunted Ground
---
PGTW
---
Surveillance 
---
Rancor
---
Though sometimes if I’m feeling cheeky I’ll throw in Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
&gt;latency.
---
This 100%. It's lag. This is why it doesn't happen every single attack.
---
Edit:I’m a rank one spirit main now and I’m disgusted with how I used to play :/
---
Ohh, I couldn’t recognize the video, and I couldn’t see a sound option. Thank you very much!
---
Most experienced survivors know where most of the totem spawns are on most maps. For the rest there’s bad RNG and Small Game.
---
I dunno I like Clown. He is kinda like a herding dog. His throws don't injure like huntress, they are instead used to kinda force survivors in certain directions. Then he has 115 movement speed if I recall correctly so big boy ain't slow. I'm not even sure how you could make him circus-esc unless you have him kill like  [Killer Klowns From Outer Space](https://youtu.be/yQ_bUR4TQy0?t=86) clowns.
---
I think when someone unhooks someone with WGLF, it shows the killer's aura to both the unhooked survivor and the survivor that unhooked for a total of x seconds. It might seem overpowered, but my idea behind the perk is to let the two survivors know whether or not the killer is coming back to them or doing something else, so they can decide whether the should leave the hook to heal or stay there.
---
But...you're using bbq. If anything bbq's bp functions should be the feature, not ruin.
---
 
---
Ruin shouldn't be mandatory, though. I hope they do something. Feels like I'm shooting myself in the foot not running it.
---
No thank you.
---
Clown's lore works perfectly with his power. He took on the Clown persona to lure in victims, and would often drug them. The fact that he's a clown is little more than a tool.
---
No trophy but you’re rewarded with longer que times and sweatier games.
---
You lost. You then tried to abuse lockers to grief the killer for winning. Your "opinion" is a reflection of your stupidity. That mechanic is there to prevent locker humpers like you from holding the game hostage, you should have just tried opening one of the doors even if there is next to no chance of survival.
---
I'd like to play a game Meg
---
Lets no please...
---
Get nae nae’d
---
Nurses and Whispers for Spirit Fury and Enduring.
---
Maybe Discordance or Thrilling Tremors for Whispers.
---
Right? Do they think the fucking rework is out? Had 7 games in a row against him. Legit seen a fucking guy using his ability on pallets and gens no one was working on.
---
But if you teabag from the other side of a pallet, you deserve to get camped. (I'm a Survivor main)
---
Ah yes i remeber using floating head myers with hillbilly's chainsaw and scaring the crap out of survivors, dont worry guys i never killed someone when i used the bug
---
BBQ, Dev hope, overcharge, and ruin
---
NOED is fine. It's a hex perk that's only active for the last 2-3 minutes of a match. Don't feel bad for using it.
---
Hell, the people giving you crap for using it are probably running adrenaline, anyway...
---
What the fuck is wrong with her left eye????
---
The Impaler
---
I think hes fun.
---
David and Huntress links to Feng and Doctor.
---
Because no one can handle that level of embarrassment
---
I know it will never happen,  but I wish there was matching for just solo players.  I hate when I play solo and get sandbagged by 3 man SWF
---
Just from a curiosity stand point, I'm relatively new, why do you put him below Myers?
---
Bad manners, just doing things that make you look like a prick or a bad sport
---
Regardless of my differing opinions, the effort and thought put into this earns an upvote
---
Don't use self-care. It's a noob trap. It's honestly a really bad perk unless you're completely solo. And even then, it's sub-par. Just takes too long to self heal, and it costs you a lot of time in match that you need when there's no communication. You're better off learning to loop and finding a teammate. There are so many better things you can use in that slot. Borrowed time is legit af though.
---
I honestly don’t mind it if I haven’t taken any killer agro yet.
---
My bad I'll fix asap
---
What was said?
---
True. I play both sides and killer has it so much worse
---
As a killer, I recommend focusing on chases not kills.  If you down them quick, great.  If you get into a long chase, pay attention to what is extending it.
---
If you're being a friendly killer try to remember who has been hooked twice...otherwise don't be too friendly early on.  Get your hooks, get your hits, get your gen/pallet breaks.  Easy 20-25k.  40-50k if you have BBQ III perk equipped.  I was averaging over 100k a match during the event with BBQ III, party streamer offerings and the 2x bloodpoints.
---
Try to relax, don't look at a match as an ending.  If you lose, on to the next match.  Enjoy the highs.  Remember if a survivor really outplays you, you made their night.  They are jumping in their chair about that insane play.  Sometimes if I can tell it's a really new/bad player I will let them make a play on me (chase them slowly to a pallet and let them stun me and escape).
---
Uh, forgive if I’m wrong but the match doesn’t end until all survivors have escaped or are sacrificed and everyone’s in the post match lobby. Endgame perks like noed and blood warden exist since the game, in fact, does not end once the 5th gen pops. 
---
Noed, regardless of how you feel about it being a crutch or not, has use on Billy due to it giving him a movement speed boost and expanding his ability to one hit down, allowing him to m1 a survivor right in front of him faster and more reliably than if he were to attempt to chainsaw.
---
Ok so you just put a title and a short clip of "we are number one"... srsly? If you make a post put in some effort
---
Ok
---
Lol
---
To the other side of the map, duh. Make sure to give them enough time to unhook, fully heal up and do a few Gens before you come back, or you're obviously being a toxic camper! /s
---
I'll never understand some people who play this game. If I just hooked someone, and I see you walking towards the hook, obviously I'm gunna try to stop the unhook and down you as well, what do you expect?
---
Asshole deserves the nice troll
---
Thematically sounds cool, but I can only see that being difficult to implement. Better to roll with the idea of it making it dangerous to be selfless. Also like the idea of a killer who well and truly runs the survivors down.
---
How do you not realize he’s a fish
---
How do you not realize he’s the window
---
Now THIS is a cosplay. Way better than that goofy looking leatherface
---
No. If toxicity is allowed then so is neck beard dwight. He already has the pedo stache.
---
I wonder if Jensen Ackles would be the survivor.
---
Dwight is a Chad, so wrong again. Not Dwight’s fault he’s such a Chad that every virgin wants some of his big dick energy to rub off by playing him.
---
NO don't you bring stranger thing here boi.
---
Fuck, you right.
---
I'd argue that the concept of No Mither is that you can keep picking yourself back up but realistically you'll never get slugged.
---
I want to yell at you the killer is coming and see they sprint burst in action
---
Why haven't these killers stuck in pallets glitches been fixed yet? Been here for as long as the game has existed as far as I've known.
---
I guess you're right
---
Indeed. Problem with it though is that the hex totem usually gets destroyed quickly
---
The only real time a killer needs a nerf or a buff is when it’s overused or underused extremely. People like Nurse are overused are red ranks so people think she needs a nerf. People like Freddy were rarely used at all so he desperately needed a buff. It’s not hard. People complaining about a new killer being OP or a killer other than The Three(you know who they are at this point) needing any sort of nerf is just some salty preteen who got killed by a trapper once so he needs a nerf.
---
Damn guess a lot of Survivors don't like Franklin's, good to note😏
---
Ahh sports lesbian (isn't a joke at you, it was from a recent post on a new player describing things)
---
Why is my shirtless david body pillow in this? That’s not cursed.
---
no
---
Freddy seems mid-tier to me. Not super amazing but not bad either.
---
Is it out??
---
My ideas were: Self Care, Adrenaline, and any other perk that does so no longer wakes survivors up, all survivor action speeds completely stop at 0% action speed during the dream transition, skillchecks of any kind no longer wake survivors up during the dream transition, survivor auras are no longer hidden from Freddy when the survivor is asleep in the dreamworld, the dream transition timer is down to 4 seconds at max, Black Box is fixed and RPB has the movement speed reduction removed, and that's pretty much all I remember. Basically, it's just removing the bullshit that survivors could pull on Freddy.
---
I watched the first couple seconds and swore this was one of those "check out this weird visual glitch" videos. A shimmering Claudette in a muddy white dumpster just looks so ugly.
---
Sequel post to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ajx7lm/in_celebration_of_hitting_35k_hours_of_playtime/).
---
Swamp is like the only map were gens, totems and hatch can spawn so close to the edges, which is a bit weird especially considering it used to be (and might still be?) the biggest map in the game in terms of sheer size.
---
Mint Rag + Discordance just popped in my head.
---
huh, i'm using apollo so it didn't show the channel :/
---
I got a great one of a huntress missing me by a full 180 degrees and still downing me.
---
I understand 100% if you use noed on a weak killer but if I see somebody playing nurse with noed they deserve a slap on the cheeks
---
"I fucked your sister on your bed". Ahhhh good ol 2010 360 lobbies
---
No shit dude, it's still not good synergy to be at such disadvantage to get half the effects of your perk. No need to be a facetious dickhead.
---
That's a lot of "what ifs"
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkGacQe4sjbxj3RykfUh33g
---
Last second of the video show UI animation of killer disconnecting mid loading.
---
Candyman is probably the scariest killer on his list and the thought of his Mori just makes me uncomfortable. I have no idea how he would work in a DBD game but holy shit if they added him I would be so happy.
---
After the game ends you can see a bit of lag in the end game screen. If I’m not mistaken this is because the killer left the match
---
When they drop pallets or vault throw your hatchet
---
Thanks man :)
---
I agree. I am nervous and excited for the new killers and am anxious to see where they fit in with the rest.
---
I wasn't treating anything with humor, so no, I wasn't being facetious and I certainly wasn't being a "dickhead". You just sound mad that David's perks are meant to synergize with each other.
---
It’s the only thing related to not having friends that I found
---
Ive had Borrowed Time not work when in terror radius recently. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. PS4 as well. Yesterday I saved a Claudette right in front of a camping huntress and it didn't kick in.
---

Ah, dead before daylight.

Sometimes, I get startled when a survivor loops me.

I had that once while spectating ghostface. It's annoying. Wouldnt go away.
---
It buys a ton of time. Especially if multiple go off. Basically kills their entire “strategy” of tunneling and they usually DC if more than one goes off
---
Whenever I bring self care now I make my whole build to be centered around so it usually becomes something Self Care + Botany Knowledge + Resilience + Spine Chill although what really matters is Self Care and Botany Knowledge.
---
Hag is the crusty lesbian.
---
It's tough to read stuff like this. When a killer is being overused, is it because they're OP, or is it because every other option is just bad?
---
The 3 are good because they are able to cut out all of the time that gets wasted in chases. M1 killers like trapper and wraith get pushed around too much. Those 3 are gonna stay good until the M1 killers get better.
---
HEY!! Thank you to the nice trapper that took care of this baby Dwight on Xbox just a few minutes ago. You showed me your ruin and everything. Thank you all kind killers that care of us lil babes.
---
Fair. I saw it more in the sense of drift king billy, instasaw(which was nerfed if i remember right), millions of blinks nurse, and all the other addons that just put them in a league of their own.
---
Make your choice works really well on spirit
---
LOL Me too...
---
Next match halfway through:  OH HE HAD UNBREAKABILL
---
I know it'd be weird for him to be added now
---
#Z O O M
---
Absolutely worth buying. Especially if you're already somewhat into it. Despite all its faults, DBD is one of the most fun PvP experiences on the market right now.
---
Just remember to play for *fun.* The game is imbalanced in many respects and taking it seriously will land you in a bottomless pit of salt. As I'm sure you've observed on streams.
---
God yes, just plz gib Harry Warden, he's all I've ever wanted in this lifetime.

I was clearly joking lmao
---
Borrowed Time does not work against the more common facecamping or “patrolling” killers - ones with low terror radius like Ghostface, Myers, Wraith, Insidious Leatherface because its based off terror radius. You can camp as almost any killer and ignore borrowed time easily. Decisive is a better choice

At that point you're better off with a good medkit with add-ons if you want to dedicate so much to healing. You can even throw on Botany Knowledge at least to get even more use out of it.

When I post this stuff I get downvoted?
---
I don't see the point of running Overcharge. In higher ranks, you might get it to go off the first time a survivor encounters it, but once they know you have it, it's very easy to counter. I feel that something like Surveillance, PGTW or Discordance would be stronger there.
---
wishful thinking. jason basically wont ever happen
---
Indoor maps are a nightmare in this game. Narrow corridors at all are just a deal breaker for me
---
I love losing survivors in corn as Ghost Face or Pig. They get way too comfortable in the corn and the lack of terror radius allows for unpredictability.

You're dreaming. They can and do issue bans for PSN chat abuse. Regardless of whether it's 'separate' from DBD, it's all occurring on the same platform.

Now we know why you got banned. You can be adamant that they 'CAN'T DO THAT NO WAY' all you want. Doesn't change the fact that they do, and did with you.

this, when i decide to do killer games i am more frightened of either 4 man SWF or insanely sweaty survivors than when i play survivor games vs nearly all killers (i still hate hag)

No. They don't. Every list always has them mid tier

A survivor won't always see the generator on account of not having aura reading. You won't be looking for the top of generators while running away from a killer, you'll most likely be looking at the killer

I find that the game 90% of the time on rank reset become too easy because I go against low rank survivors since I never rank my killer past purple ranks(Due to lack of motivation to play more), and then I pick a killer I want to learn and instantly go against people that bumrush generators
---
I just can't find a silver lining with rank resets
---
And going on rants about how BHVR is infringing his rights by banning him over abuse he made on Xbox Live. Oh no, there are consequences, the horror!

---
Don't you mean they'll face your... *Wraith*?
---
Lol I'm a survivor main who isn't toxic but admittedly I find this funny. XD I did have it done to me once...
---
Just like every killer runs noed. Always a good time
---
Same. Survivor is higher stress and killer is lower since you control everything. It could be due to the fact I started this game with the first 350 hours only as killer so I understand how it works but I find survivor way more stressful and powerless.
---
Really he should have linked it in a comment as he posted. Lol

Me and my swf faced a wraith with all his best add ons who really gave us a good game. After using his ivory Mori on one of our friends he was insidious camping another one. She told us to leave her behind and escape with our key. Well, we decided that nah we can't leave her behind. My third teammate used a pebble to distract and then flash lighted him while I yanked her off the hook. Thankfully my borrowed time kicked in and even with windstorm he couldn't stop all three of us from getting to the hatch. It was a particularly satisfying win, and the wraith was a good sport about it too
---
More salty killer mains lol
---
Ah, yes, the good ole' casually walking by a pallet, only to have my heart ripped out of my chest 'cause someone thought I saw them and slammed it clean onto my unaware head
---
Yea, but think about it, if you had more BP, you could get more perks to run different builds on Wraith thus allowing you more diverse builds.
---
*Says this as I run BBQ on every killer because it takes forever to get every perk*

People are complaining about meta, he is saying nerfing or buffing something will just create another meta.
---
Dollies from Cabin in the Woods. They are pretty much Legion but a family.
---
NOED also increases speed.
---
People said the same thing about ghostface!
---
So hes a loser if he started and if he returned it? Something seems off
---
I’m a survivor main, but I still agree with the other person who said he was overrated. From a survivors perspective, dodging him can be really easy especially if you have the right perks. I run Dark Sense, Premonition, Urban Evasion, and Balanced Landing. He’s easy to spot and easy to determine its him, and after I know, i’m as stealthy as possible and usually just gen rush and hardly ever get caught. Plus, countering him and stopping him from targeting you is too easy. I will say that I think he’s one of the coolest looking ones.
---
Haven't seen a pig meme in a long time. Ever since GlenOck got banned it kinda died down
---
That Myers looks like he's eating whoever's on his shoulder
---
Every survivor that has ever teabagged was bm'd by the killer first. Anything that says otherwise is made up assumptions...
---
When Feng gets tired of the Entity's bullshit
---
'Guess I'll DC'
---
Seriously, why are killers so deathly afraid of playing a game of risk? You've got a 3K, at least make an attempt to earn the 4K
---
Killers are already 15% faster so that's pretty significant. Regardless, it helps you down survivors faster.
---
Dead Silence
---
The Freddy they got licensed is from the shit 2010 movie, which has nothing to do with Robert Englund's Freddy.
---
If the EGC timer wasn't bugged and actually slowed down since you were downed I dont think the billy could have juggled you long enough to keep you out (unless he hooked you) I've seen killers who have been fed games because survivors didn't have enough time to save each other and leave because the egc timer stayed at normal speed -_-
---
First, not all killers are 15% faster, second, that's not that much faster to being with, hence why chases aren't over instantly no matter how much you buff your speed.
---
Pretty sure the timer immediately comes to a 0 as soon as you get picked up and it guarantees you get DS.
---
The more likely option was that she couldn't be dropped where she would have landed, and the game just shit its pants trying to figure out what to do, and went zero sum
---
I can't either at the moment.
---
Just says posting to media server??
---
Jason basically can't appear until the legal shit surrounding him is dealt with.
---
yay
---
Even if Ruin only last for a couple of minutes, that means that you've gotten your use out of it. PGTW is great for slowing down the mid game, but it doesn't do anything early, which is where Ruin shines.
---
That is what I hope the final Killer is.
---
Well deserved. xD
---
Its funny because survivors have been getting everything nerfed over the last year, and killers have been getting a shit ton of buffs. However, killers did need those buffs.
---
It barely lasts a minute usually and I don't think it actually does that much for that minute anyway.
---
feng is chineese, why not give it to adam?
---
Well Ghostface gets kicked out of his ability just by people looking at him(perks also completely counter his ability) and his stalk is kinda hard to pull off while Myers doesn't get kicked out of his stalk when spotted can pull off different builds and has plenty of variety with add-ons and has pretty good snowball potential.  Pig and Legion are decent killers that can have a bit of build variety but Pig has more.   For a new player I'd say Micheal as he has plenty of build and add-on variety and isn't that complicated to use while Ghostface is more harder to use and has less build variety.
---
Thanks!
---
Just give up and chase someone else. Trust me it’s not worth chasing the same survivor the whole game
---
PS4
---
Yeah, I’m a P3 Myers main and I can assure you he is really good for new killers.
---
They do. By slugging. You've got a better chance that way.
---
Killers are actually faster than the survivors. You just have to learn how to work around the obstacles they throw at you
---
Plus alot of perks completely counter him and needs good Add-ons to win. Even though I love The character design of Ghostace I have to be honest and say Micheal has way more build variety.  You should make your own choices though but still hope I helped with what you pick
---
Can you manipulate which side of the gen you tp to by walking a certain direction like that or was that for the terror radius bait?
---
What type of perks do you normally run on Myers? I’m quite new to dbd and am struggling to figure out which perks are best for each killer

NoEd Is Op
---
So basically what you're saying is Bloodlust and Pallets have a large impact on the outcome? Kinda meaning that the 4% boost is relatively unnecessary? Most games where NOED is used, it helps because of the insta-down, not speed.
---
Sounds so damn good, craving sounds spectacular for m1 killers, but might be busted for m2. I like the whole idea
---
"tOxIc KilLerS doNT exIsT"

Hes very good but he has no map pressure as most killers do. Hes a bit worse than myers imo. I personally feel plague is underappreciated, she effectively makes everyone 1 hit down all game, but again no map pressure.

---
This would be a genuinely a good rework for left behind
---
When your the last survivor get a tremendously difficult skillcheck when being carried by the killer
---
Hitting the skill check will make you drop a pipe bomb stunning the killer, blinding them and you will get the deep wounds status effect
---
Agree his power is perfect. I think maybe a quality of life change to the power but nothing more than like maybe an extra bottle or extended duration.
---
The claudette, after getting hit, is walking to a generator so I use my power to teleport to the gen and to make sure that the claudette does not see what I am doing I walk away.
---
Immediately after I arrive I turn my camera to the claudette and hit her.
---

Bbq chilo, Monitor and abuse, nurses calling and stridor
---
If you think huntress lullaby is a good perk regardless of buff or not your stupid. If you literally dont look away from your screen it ain't an issue. And that's coming from someone who plays both but prefers survivor since red rank with my mains isnt fun.
---
Exactly. It's like if as a killer I kicked the gen that was at 50% and told survivors "don't tunnel gens, let them go back to 0%.
---
So the odds are slim and will take a while. 
---
I can accept that. But still, even if it's one in a million, there is still a 1 we can hope on
---
Every killer except the nurse IS 10-15% faster in the normal movement speed. So 4% is a big increase in speed, I know I use it (because I’m trash right?)

That Huntress mask is so fucking metal
---
I don't get it
---
lol outplayed
---
Yeah in my opinion no matter how high a rank you are, you're still a baby survivor if you don't do dull totems then complain about a killer with noed like if you did so good the whole game to survive and be toxic why did you get destroyed cause you couldn't break totems or outrun a slightly faster one shot killer. They're all trash and even the people who play killer and survivor are toxic if they play survivor and complain about noed just cause they don't use it they think it makes them entitled to complain. I personally use noed if I don't have anything better on a m1 only killer or if I'm playing killers that need it like ore rework Freddy but only in my endgame build.
---
To everyone wondering what the deleted comment was;
---
"What a loser, I totally would have sent him a message" 
---
Or something to that effect
---
For every adrenaline, there’s a NOED. We all have perks that everyone can agree are a bit ridiculous.
---
He was always a m1 killer yes but Now he is more forced to eat pallets.
---
Since before he slept somebody hit them with the dreamtransition mindgames and then changed targets.
---
Because of his aura reading he could keep track easier which gens are being worked on so he can appear right before it gets finished.
---
Because of his aura reading you had a good idea of what was happening most of the time so you could make the right decision based on that.
---
His stall is like a much better version of ruin but that is more consistent and also slows down healing.
---
The dreamtransition mindgames made it so if you are awake it only takes him 7 seconds to hit you.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
His teleport is fun and good even do he should be able to teleport to all gens and not only uncompleted ones, but the rest of his kit feel weak.
---
For the traps to work you need to already know before where the survivors will run to and make sure that the survivor is already asleep before you chase him to that loop.
---
They are much easier to see than the hag/trappers trap and only work on sleeping survivors which makes them a lot harder to use.
---
They may change a lot before he is put on the live servers but as of now he is weaker than before.
---
Shut up Meg.
---
I'm pretty surprised you can channel the teleport whilst moving, as seen in this case it looks kinda strong in chases.
---
See it more like the hag her traps.
---
Will she teleport to hit or just hit you?
---
Will Freddy teleport to it or cancel it and hit you?
---
Quality wise as well
---
I can almost guarantee that he will eventually be in the game (as in, negotiations have already been finalized, and are just frozen due to the pending legal battle).
---
The good news, since Dead By Daylight is a games as a service, if the lawsuit is wrapped up within the next few years, we should still be getting him by the time support for this game ends (and I honestly don't see support ending, even after their projected 5 yr plan).
---
The other cool thing, what if Horror Inc (F13 rights holders) at that time sell the F13 game to Behavior, to continue developing content for that game, and turn back on the dedicated servers (which would have likey been shut down by the end of the lawsuit).  God, I can see it already: cosmetic store, new Jason skins, new individual Jason abilities, non Canon  maps (i.e. more than just camp grounds maps) etc. They would literally be the Monopoly of Asymmetrical horror. And one map with Gen's added for the escape - as a *personal* touch, lol.

He’s mentally deficient then.

Man, Regular Show is one of the best shows I've ever watched while high, I wish I could do it all over again. I've never laughed as hard as I did watching the White Elephant Christmas episode.

---
How to fix this: put a respawn button in esc and make it so it has a cooldown, and Stuns the player. Just place them somewhere the game 100% knows is not anywhere close to any assets and give it a cooldown.
---
I've been stuck between trees before as survivor too and it's just honestly the result of rng being rng, the game needs a respawn button to hotfix, and then a real fix would just be to nudge killer / survivor if they aren't moving for X amount of time.
---
That's one spicy play. Well done.
---
If I hit a survivor like this, I let them get back up. Screw the hitboxes like this.
---

It’s a cool idea they would have to test it out cuz I could see it being very underpowered, would be fun to mess with survivors like that though
---
IT is literally a ancient cosmic being. Hes a "alien" that spans throughout time and many dimensions. We shouldn't have him because it seems to me like the entity is weaker.
---
So many people have recommended it and unfortunately it falls flat. SWF would destroy the killer. But honestly, when we run out of ideas, I think killers that would excel in KYF like gamemodes should be added.
---
One time, I got flamed for having noed on an endgame Freddy build despite me not actually downing or chasing anybody when noed was active. Survivors seeing noed is like a bull seeing red.
---
They’ll probably change whoever wins to fit the game better anyways
---
You should censor their names out
---
I haven't watched footage of the new Freddy so maybe I just don't understand. What do you mean by "to make sure the Claudette does not see what I am doing I walk away?" Doesn't a "husk" appear at the Gen or something when you start the teleport?

Personally I’d swap Iron Will for Decisive. Depending on your rank killers do tend to tunnel the easy pray and No Mithers are relatively quiet as is. If you’re looking at pure gen speed, maybe go Prove Thyself instead and belt gens out with another survivor.
---
Myers, for a new player mYers is a very solid choice.

Unpopular opinion incoming but killer camping is the same as survivor looping. While looping causes a killer to lose lots of resources and time to get a kill, camping causes survivors to lose lots of resources and time to get a save. Obviously camping is looked down upon because sometimes most survivors will ignore the save and finish gens making camping a negative for the killer however situationally it’s effective and a positive as you’re pretty much guaranteed at least 2 people will need to come for the save leaving only 1 to work on gens.
---
Where’s the cosplay?
---
I am offended.
---
Nah m8
---
That's the only real attempt. Why leave it up to chance of a good or bad hatch spawn
---
Although I don't camp on killer nearly as much as I loop on survivor, I respect this comment
---
I agree with giving the perk an additional effect like BBQ but no way devs will delete a perk.
---
It matches my pfp
---
Plague is not a somewhat weak killer. If used right she is better than a number of killers. She is mid-high tier. Nurse is fine at least on console. Her increased blink speed and number of blinks don’t come by to often so that seems balanced. I really enjoy using her and she seems pretty balanced.
---
LOL unless you join random parties there is no way to get DDOS through Xbox. What an idiot.
---
What nonsense are you talking about? The entity controls realms. IT travels between dimensions. 
---
Both of their true forms are spiders. The entity is basically a rip off of it without the clown.
---
Agree in everything except the huntress achievement. You have to do it 20 times on PC, but 100 times on console.
---
Opening random messages and joining random parties can get your IP grabbed so in the future be more mindful of that. Also if s/he did DDOS you and you can get this person’s IP address I’m pretty sure there’s a way of getting this person into shit if you really wanted some petty revenge.
---
I did, no worries (:
---
Honestly he needs some tweaking they need to make it so his movement speed doesn’t get slowed while he’s charging his chainsaw or something because he’s just way too easy to loop making it impossible for him to do anything, his chainsaw should be able to help him finish chases faster not prolong chases because survivors can’t just bait the charge as you come around the corner charging it up and than they just continue the loop multiple more times
---
I know parties do, wasn't aware messages did, thank you!

Oh. Makes sense.

Optimism is needed !

Their argument for nerfing MOM was 'it gives survivors a whole extra hit!'. Yeah well using instantly downing abilities gives them one less. It's a bogus, braindead argument.
---
By their own logic, anything that can down a survivor in one hit is bullshit. Because they love to complain about insta heals, MOM, etc.
---
Was this two Claudettes and like 3 weeks ago. Cause I did this exact thing to a spirit with a friend. We were hunting for the ruin. We ended up getting four gens and escaping as well.
---
I imagine somewhere there may be a physical manifestation of the entity but we see its spider legs come and take people all the time so I imagine there's some spidery guy somewhere that IT could fight. It's best feats are talked about though. He had something to do with some huge massacres and great fires just total carnage. The kids killed them because of the knowledge the kids had and I think they unknowingly got assistance from its nemesis the giant space turtle.
---
lol I remember that killer gingerbread man movie
---
So, tunneling is an expression used to describe a killer who chases down the same survivor for a long period of time. Generally, if you cant down the survivor within 40 seconds then you're doing something wrong and need to turn your attention elsewhere. The more time you spend tunnelling, the faster gens get done. Of course if your chases are less than 40 seconds, then the survivor is bad at looping and is salty that you downed them.
---
Slugging is when you down a survivor but leave them on the floor to crawl, as opposed to hooking them.
---
Ok to survivors “tunneling” is when you apparently go for the person who just got off the hook and slugging is when you leave survivors on the floor to bleed out!
---
But in all honesty you’re a killer &amp; they’re in your lobby! You play how you want! Your job as a killer is to kill! No matter how you do it as long as you’re not hacking it’s fine! And as a survivor their job is to survive no matter the cost! So you do you and don’t worry about what others say or think!
---
I mean the point is moot anyways since when dedicated servers kick in, dodging will be impossible. I was just arguing that I can totally understand people who dodge (and frequently dodged  myself before the lobby change), since no one should be forced into a stressful match if he can have an easier one just by waiting a bit longer.
---
Regarding SWF and balance: I still hope that they either build some aura-reading perks right into the survivors to empower solo queuers, or give them a bit more BP, or something. Not every SWF is a try-hard gang, but even the most casual SWF group does have a lot of advantages that the solo survivor doesn't, and that irks me. Maybe the best thing would even be to include voice chat among survivors and then balance around that, idk. It's a difficult situation since the game and many perks were designed with a strict "no comms" rule during DBD's conception.  
---
And yes, coordinated adrenaline especially is a giant "Fuck you!" middle finger to any killer player.
---
We got that wonderful enduring nerf and the new tiles they introduced are so much safer than older ones it's ridiculous. They are nerfing killers they just dint advertise it as such.
---
I run unbreakable constantly. Can't tell you how many times it's come in clutch
---
I kept expecting something really interesting to happen but damn
---
It’s “coming,” but so is the end of the world.
---
I have an ivory mori just for people like you.
---
Fucks sake dude that's God damn attempted murder. What the fuck did dwight do to these people.
---
Tunneling is where you focus on just one survivor (I.e. A survivor gets unhooked so you chase just that one ignoring all others) and slugging is where you let the survivors crawl in the dying state
---
I'm sorry, hold on
---
\&gt;Too Human
---
We have Ghostface AND Amanda
---
So is it bad to “slug” if theres two survivors and I think one is on hatch?
---
I’d honestly recommend Myers because even though his perks aren’t too great he’s very versatile and he’s great at jump scaring people and not that hard to play as (compared to spirit who’s good but takes some work to getting used to) not to mention Myers when you prestige him looks awesome (his weapon and his mask look awesome his overalls not too much). Spirit I another good one but she’s harder to play
---
Bunny suit huntress
---
To be fair, most killers use Chili for BP
---
Really? In Freddy’s Dead, it’s said that he joined the ranks of them.
---
Yeah it freaked me out at first - for a second I thought both Nea and Dwight could hear it the same way I did
---
Huntress is definitely not weak. A DECENT huntress is probably the 4th best killer in the game,  only behind Nurse, Spirit, and Billy.
---
usually nea players try to copy what noob3 does
---
shit*
---
That add-on should be nerfed somehow. Removing the only way to know she is coming is a stupid move
---
From what I heard yes. They will change the logo to Bill's in pc also
---
ok
---
Spirit for Prayer Beads grabs, wicked Mori and of course Spirit Fury to pair with Enduring. Thank me later.
---
i bet you're fun at parties
---
oh wow, thank you for the input, that is very simple and understandable how you explain it. i have no idea of US system and all that, i just know that money can't stretch. therefore it's impossible to budget low income to be able to travel as much as this person or go to restaurants twice a week.
---
when i lived alone and was supporting myself after university(given my University was 100% free and i was getting a small scholarship) with a VERY good income in Russian standards for a person without big experience. i was editing videos for film studio and shooting some myself - something i actually learned on my own and never had proper education for cause my degree is Philosophy lol. so my yearly income was around 15k of pure money(cause taxes in Russia are on employers, they have to do them). which is a very good amount for one person of my age, i was able to afford renting(cause in Russia most young people live with parents, especially in Moscow cause rent here is enormous - you won't get a decent clean place in a good district for less 400-500 a month. and 400-500 will give you DECENT place. not good. for good you'll have to pay 600 and over, with Russian salaries, you know... that's a lot of damage), save a little bit of money for Milan sales twice a year and, well, that was my travel. but that'd mean i'm ONLY buying clothes on these sales, not in Moscow during a year. or if i didn't feel like clothes, i'd skip a year and get a better trip like 2 months in Europe(staying at friends and relatives) or some trip to Asia. with that i definitely couldn't afford having a child. even though some people do live this way here. as in have similar or even bit lower income while supporting a child or even two.
---
and having a job and all the things i had to do from cleaning and shopping, i never had enough time to play online games lol. cause that'd mean i'll have to learn a lot of new things and spend some time to be somewhat decent. i now spend like 5 to 6 hours in DbD and i'm still not good enough to have 100% achievements. cause they take a bunch of time, a bunch of waiting and you're not guaranteed to get anything on high ranks.
---
so with that i called bullshit on this man. because no way he has the time for everything, especially a child as a single parent, and even come bitch on reddit, while claiming to be good at the game and shaming people for dodging swf lobbies. because apparently for his under 1.2k hours in dbd for 3 years(i have nearly 3k for a year and a half lol) he's consistently on red ranks and doesn't face many swfs because apparently in 2-3 hours he can afford spending on a game he gets more than 10 killer games lol.

😑🙄
---
If the word schlong horrifies you then I find it a wee bit strange that your running around on a sub for a game about skenging your opponents and then putting them on dirty meat hooks.
---
Call me a bit twisted but my go to Billy Build is BBQ, Enduring, Tinkerer, and Bitter Murmur. (or if I'm feeling especially sadistic Rancor for the free Mori and tracking across the whole map.)
---
Why no spirit fury?
---
Insta-Saw.
---
he's not part of the license family
---
I was so mad, I was felt like I was so far away from the window when it happened. Then upon further review I see this 🧐
---
Usually if i see someone being farmed ill let them go and tunnel down the other person.
---
Spirit is bloody good. Freddy is gonna get a rework and honestly he's fun to play.
---
So.... is it bad? Or acceptable
---
&gt; but when you play killer your objective shouldn't be to *kill*
---
You're right, it's not unintuitive, it's flat out antithetical. Pressure and winning chases are what allows you to kill.
---
This is where I wish people would just get over themselves already. "Creating fun" and "everyone getting more points" are not rules for participants of the game. It's not a killer's obligation to be an experience curator for a survivor; they're not a damn tour guide, and this game isn't a haunted house. You fight for your life, end of story.
---
*How* a killer decides to kill isn't up for debate either. It doesn't matter if you hard focus one person or stand there and stare lovingly into their eyes as they die. A kill is a kill, and whether or not you like it is irrelevant.
---
I've never once heard anybody say *one single time* about survivors that they should behave the same way with these unwritten rules like people try to force on killer. I've never heard anybody say a survivor should let themselves be hit twice and hooked that way the killer gets more points and the survivors get points. I've never once heard anybody say after so long of looping, a survivor should just give up and let the killer get them. The common theme here is that survivors get to dominate killers by relentless loops, flashlight blinds, decisive strikes, body blocks, borrowed time, and pallets galore, but if a killer doesn't "play nice" or "be fair", an entire hypocritical butthurt storm brews and shit gets flung like monkeys at the damn zoo.
---
I'd like to see just one time a group of survivors follow the moronic "honor code" set of rules that people try to force on killers and then try saying how it was a "good experience" or "fun time" for them.
---
I really can't say I blame him
---
I mean it's not cheating but it is a dick move.

I welcome you to try justifying the existence and commenting on the balance of pre-nerf decisive and mettle.

I swear, i would love to see an epilogue were Dwight quits his jobs and flips off everyone while his new friends cheer for him through out the window.
---
That’s a pro gamer strat if I’ve ever seen one
---
Wait how is her lullaby even good
---
Hes basically billy but way worse and a easier to hit saw. Tbh just hug people then backsaw them. Hes probably the worst killer after freddy rework.
---
Because killer's perks are supposed to be better than survivors'.
---
Then run whisperers or some shit, don't know how you expect someone to wait four minutes plus on your ass.

that's cute actually

Should honestly drop no mither at lower rank its useless you'll never see a killer slug because they know you can always get back up. One of my swf use to run a similar build and had to switch mither out by rank 12. Personally would go with borrowed time and take a protection hit to get rolling

Swap no mither and resilience for DS, Borrowed time, Bond, or Adrenaline
---
75 sec is way too long. You can just cleanse at a fountain. Makes the killer even more unviable.
---
Yea its definitely something to do with latency. Its so tilting when your get hit a mile away over a pallet you just vaulted
---
Very popular so popular they changed him and his power and will be out in the next update lol
---
hid in the locker while everyone did their quarterly reports
---
Usually the killer has a long Q and some even dodge anything that seems like an swf. DCing pretty much ruins their game and all that waiting.
---
P3 Claudettes  have the knowledge you seek, if you can find them
---
&gt; after the first time on hook is fucking stupid
---
I'm still waiting on the "why" part to be answered. 
---
Would you prefer instead that moris only be usable on death hook? If that were the case, why would you ever use them? The amount of time it takes to do the mori animation isn't worth the trade off in time and points to just slap them on a hook and move on. 
---
&gt; improves your chances of killing 3-4 by so much it makes the game so unfun
---
At what, rank 10? You speak as if having a mori gives you ESP to locate survivors, wins your chases automatically, and then repeats the process to find the survivor again to even use the mori on them. Chases are *not* that simple as a killer without the survivors being complete dog shit at the game.
---
"When you vomit you enter injured state"
---
Then what you finish vomiting and it goes away? So you just pass back and fourth between being injured and healthy?
---
What if you were already injured before becoming sick?
---
This whole idea is pretty terrible amd not needed.
---
I feel like out of that list the reasonable hopefuls are: Pinhead, Jack, and Chucky. If Jack was a killer he would come with some bitchin’ maps.
---
Oof if ya play at 3 in the morning there’s no wait
---
Try playing at 3am, there’s no wait
---
The latter, unfortunately. A lot of Survivor mains want to feel good with the generic looping practice, rather than have chases by dynamic based on Killer, so there's no real indication anyone else is ALLOWED to be at the 3's level.
---
Yeah me to
---
Is it gen times, or is it toolboxes speeding up gens?
---
Or is it perks speeding up gens?
---
Dude, I think u meant Huntress
---
And some still do. Not directly, though.
---
Hell yeah we do (nontoxic 15 year old here)
---
Bud I don’t even play too much killer and got to rank 4. I’ve literally never lost a game with an ebony mori on. It doesn’t. Win chases or show where they are but it increases your chases of winning by at least 33%. Counting death penalty’s aka the survivors not having another man if he dies early decreases it by even more. Plus, it’s so easy to be toxic with it, if you want to you can wait till someone unhooked and then smack them and bam they’re out of the game. It’s so simple. I don’t see how you don’t get that.
---
I always felt the Terror Radius was really babying Survivors, anyway. I'd rather see players listen for rustling grass, breathing, and footsteps than give them what might as well be a raid siren and a neon sign.
---
&gt; Again, as I said, when a survivor takes into account how much fun a killer is having, I'll take the notion of worrying about how much fun a survivor has more seriously. Until then, it's one massive double standar
---
Brother I *main* killer. Unless survivors are exploiting bugs (like current sprint burst bug) or looping incredibly annoying structures (haddonfun with balanced landing, grim pantry with nasty window) it's all fair game and I don't mind what they try to use against me. Survivors can't really pull shenanigans and such either when you down them and hook them faster than they can recover from the previous hook.
---
&gt;Except it's anything but. If the survivor is optimal, the only way you're really going to just instantly down them is if a bad unhook happens or there are no pallets nearby. Fresh off the hook means their exhaustion perk is ready again, they may have BT/DS, and their could be more tiles for them to loop for extended chases.
---
It's still entirely possible and quite frankly easy to tunnel 1 guy all game and then camp the 2nd near your noed totem.
---
&gt;It depends on the rank you're playing at. If you're playing at rank 10, then yeah, the survivors are morons that go down easily. If you're playing at rank 1, especially against SWF, good luck getting a single kill depending on the map and your killer choice
---
I mean, I play Wraith/ Huntress/ Billy and Hag and I don't have trouble. Pretty much no strong add-ons either.
---
&gt;I'd like to see you face off against 4 optimal rank 1 players and tell me killer is easy
---
You know how rare it is to get a lobby with 2 survivors who know to just keep running after taking a hit at a pallet instead of dropping it? Red ranks is fucking abysmal when it comes to finding survivors with consistent skill. The only consistency with it is survivors know to stick to gens more and can more often work through ruin- but even then it's a small chance they even will.
---
I think the bigger point should be about map gen. It can be totally arbitrary at times and just dick one side or the other with no rhyme or reason.
---
what you’re saying is “the mori was just a mori.” your picture says “cypress mori”
---
exactly. i don’t respect pallets so i was chasing a survivor who just fed me every pallet on the map. then when i killed him he accused me of tunnelling and said i was bad. i said he was wasting pallets and he fucked his team over but he got ‘max stun points’ so he didn’t waste them.
---
Yeah, when are infinites coming back? Remember how finding a window meant a Killer just literally couldn't catch that Survivor? What losers those Killers were, not possessing enough skill to alter the game's mechanics into making their victory possible.
---
Well, except Nurse. Nurse had 3 blinks back then.
---
This is my favorite wraith cosmetic
---
But which one of you will run out of the gate first?!
---
Holy shit wraith is fucking swole
---
If the Shrine of Secrets is done giving you Hope, you may find Urban Evasion
---
He is strong, don't get me wrong. But at the current meta, genrush is very powerful. Powerful enough to put a lot of pressure to the clown. His power is only to end chase quickly, while the BIG FOUR has map pressure and end chases fairly quick. Nurse is unstoppable no matter what, Billy has insane map pressure and one shot capability, Spirit has the best mindgames and she's very fast.
---
Huntress is, meh, okay but you really gotta hit those long distance hatchets (I cannot even hit them at close range rip) to keep the pressure and it requires a lot of mechanical skill.
---
"Top ten mysterious gasses that will make you say-" is what really got me.
---
Limiting yourself will not help you grow
---
The end game collapse hatch mechanic is so killer sided it is silly to still feel the need to slug.  I don't like to play like a dick and waste peoples time before killing them so I take my chances and low and behold I find and close the hatch successfully like 80% of the time.
---
Sounds like you broke BHVR's TOS or EULA guidelines.
---
Most ultra rares are and should be very strong, that's why they're UR. - but they should probably be less common than they are now and the 'keep addon' offerings should probably just be put in the bin
---
Never crossed my mind, as someone who mained him in every capcom fighting game he was in, would love to see him as well!
---
But holding your defeated opponents game hostage for minutes while you continue playing your game isn't.  Hypocrisy and entitlement at its finest.  It's the only thing they can do to take their time back.  Just hook them so they can move on to their next game once it's over.
---
Since he can get the first hit on you so easily anyway, there's no reason to heal to full.
---
Blue is the best

Trapper already has a miner skin, so it's not likely a character from bloody valentine will ever be added

Did you just copy and paste Scott's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEG2oTfrPC4)?
---
I usually play Basement piggy whenever I do that. The funniest part is the amount of salt. You ONLY sit in the basement and you ONLY down survivors who go there. Amazingly, people will still cry and call you a camper..
---
Save The Best For Last - When they start flooding the basement area, you can usually stack this quite quickly. Once you have it at 6 stacks, you can down a survivor before they can leave the shack.
---
Blood Warden - Usually helps you secure one more kill if they make a mistake

---
Ha, there's only one vocal side, especially in this subreddit when it comes to "nerfing" and it's always killers complaining about survivors and SWF. 
---
The only complaint I have with killers is Nurse being able to blink more than twice, Huntress having iri hatchets and Spirit's collision whilst phasing.
---
Meh. 2k hours and only Hag traps and Myers scare me.
---
Every killer was complaint about pallet vacuums. But this is ok lol
---
Its a glitched survivor model it appears in a random place every time a gen is completed. And theres also a bug of being able to see survivors silhouette while playing killer
---
Depends on the killer, if you lack the speed to get to the hatch after hooking, you'll slug. Most of the time the hatch is close enough to hook and close the hatch, but when it isn't, or thr location is unknown, I'm not going to give chances, i rarely run NOED and don't play Nurse or Spirit, so running around to find the last survivor takes a little while, and if they happen to come for the save, good, i can hit the last one and track them both down by listening to their injured state.
---
This is astonishing, hahahahahaha!

---
He's fun to play as and against. I never go without Bamboozle and Enduring though, he is easily looped.
---
As a survivor, I find the chases finally to be fun and entertaining in my opinion. Found at red ranks some of the best GFs, I have a great respect for them, considering how hard is at that rank for an M1 killer.
---
best player? doubt it, good player? more likely, there is no "best" player.
---
Just wow....Free stealth buffs for all killers!  Any other massive mechanics you want to gut to make downing survivors any easier?
---
You even though of Wraith! How cool of you
---
Just loop him and he cant do much else other than eating pallets.
---
If they added pennywise it'd probably be the film version, which doesn't talk about the god yet.
---
There's a lot to counter it. Unbreakable being a good perk for it, and Insta-Heal being a good add-on. There's other reasons such as knowing the last guy has Borrowed Time, or taking the time to pinpoint the last survivor with whispers by walking around in large circles outside of 32m from the slugged surv. But in the end it comes down to the mood of the killer, it's pretty common for me personally to toss the slugged guy into the hatch if i find his buddy, or kill them all the next game, depends on how the survivors acted and if they were running a lot of toxic stuff.
---
Me
---
Killers are in control of the game and the devs nerf every op thing survivors had like ds and MoM. They are buffing weak killers and new killers are good. So no, stop being another whiny asshole
---
We have billy and leather boi. Most complaints about being too similar can be struck down pretty quickly now.

it used to, but they buffed tier 1 and 2 to give the same rewards as tier 3

Any monkey can get to rank 1. It just takes game volume and hitting a few markers for your emblems. That's *wholly* different than *being* rank 1. There are plenty of players sitting at rank 1 that are trash. This is a useless boast to try giving yourself clout.
---
&gt; I’ve literally never lost a game with an ebony mori on
---
Even if I grant that as truthful, unless you have a high volume of games with the ebony on, it's another useless boast.
---
&gt; it’s so easy to be toxic with it
---
You define toxic as killing the person that just got unhooked. *Here* is where the problem is. What is toxic about killing the person that is most vulnerable? Why is playing the game considered scummy? When was it decided that you have to be merciful as a killer sent by the Entity to slay the survivors in a trial?
---
Killing and getting killed is part of the game. If you can't handle that, then this game, or any like it, aren't for you. This isn't CoD TDM we're talking about here. Sometimes you're gonna get gibbed and there isn't a whole hell of a lot you can do about it. You can either sit there and bitch and moan, or you can queue up and do it again and go for a better result. 
---
"waaah I got killed because toxic killer mori'd me"
---
Again, I come back to this hypocrisy that exists wherein survivors are able to make every excuse imaginable why they need pallets, windows, loop tiles, ridiculous perks, and insta heals, all to survive; however, the minute a killer does anything that ups his chances of winning, it's now toxic and ruins the game. The sense of entitlement is disgusting.

---
You seem to have missed the point. You're acting as if it's important for you as the killer you claim to main being a benevolent force that ensures everyone in the game is having fun, which includes the survivors. If that's the case, then why are the survivors not paying the killer the same courtesy? If moris are toxic, if "tunneling" is toxic, if "camping" is toxic, and all of these things need to be eradicated, then when do we start plucking things away from survivors? 
---
&gt; It's still entirely possible and quite frankly easy to tunnel 1 guy all game and then camp the 2nd near your noed totem
---
Of course tunneling them is easy. *Catching them*, however, not so much. Even if you hard focus one person, your entire set of generators will go up if they're good enough to keep you occupied with loops and mind games. Sure, hard camp the second person with NOED, but good luck getting much more than a black pip. Your gatekeeper will be shit, your chase will be shit, and your brutality will likely be lacking severely. Even *if* you manage to rank up over the course of several games with that strategy, who cares? Why is it being moralized? We can't moralize survivors looping, blinding, and DS'ing their way into victory. Hell, we can't even mention "gen rushing" because "it's the only objective", so why are we always trying to moralize killer actions? 
---
&gt; I mean, I play
---
Gonna tie this one into the next line.
---
&gt; Red ranks is fucking abysmal when it comes to finding survivors with consistent skill.
---
No shit. Everyone knows that trashy players exist in red ranks and at rank 1 because all it takes is volume to get there. I figured when I wrote "4 optimal rank 1 players" it would be easy. It was a little more ambiguous when I said "playing at rank 1, especially against SWF" because I assumed it was granted I meant legit skilled opponents. Regardless, I'm not talking about trash players with red lettering for their rank.
---
you must be fun at parties
---
I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c6bmsq/yet_another_perk_balance_suggestion_part_6/) talking about how one could potentially change WGLF. Feel free to read it and give your own thoughts.  
---
My personal favourite idea was #2, which I will post here as well:  
---
&gt;Your few friends deserve the best protection.  
---
&gt;Each time you perform a Safe Hook Rescue or take a hit to protect a Survivor, gain a 25 % stack-able bonus to all Bloodpoint gains up to a maximum of 50/75/100 %.  
---
&gt;Each time you take a hit to protect a Survivor, all other Survivors within a 16 metre range receive a 10 % speed bonus to all actions and vaulting; this effect lasts for 15 seconds.  
---
&gt;The bonus Bloodpoints are only awarded post-Trial.  
---
&gt;Note: This version of WGLF would heavily reward protective plays, mainly giving the protected teammate a better running chance thanks to the temporary boost in vaulting speed.
---
There's more to it than that though, otherwise running mori would be standard
---
It's about consistently being able to find survivors and win chases/ not letting yourself get juked or played
---
Ive been playing him a lot lately, at first it was just for bbq but he has really grow on me. I normally run bbq, Frank, bitter, and sloppy. A good thing to learn is to get on an elevated spot and look around for survivors before going from gen to gen. You don't need to rely on the saw to do insta downs all the time, smack those survivors with your hammer make their items yours. the best time is to use the saw is when someone is unhooking or running for a pallet. Build your bloodlust up and close the gap between, unless your running insta saw you'll slow down too much to hit them if the gap is too big. Bubba's chili addon helps a bit with distance but if your not use to making tight turns your gonna get looped. Also if you're chasing a survivor that you've already smacked once and he brings you to a gen with survivors stop your chase and kick that shit. Gen protection is the most important thing especially when all most survivors want to do is gen rush and leave. Keep gen pressure up, smack first saw only when necessary, keep the survivors injured or dying to give them something else to worry about.
---
Was playing huntress and a Dwight just did it a whole run AROUND the corn and I just fucking sat there and just looked around and saw no one.
---
An ability that works only upon downing someone sounds pretty damn weak. Even the passive ability only comes into play after you've injured the person you're chasing. Sounds like a killer that would get looped and easy and that wouldn't have much map pressure.
---
And this needs more info. How big is the movement speed buff, how long does it last, what's his base movement speed and terror radius?
---
Noed with insta down wow
---
Back when egc first came in, i liked to mess about with survivors. I’d drop them a certain ways away from the door and I liked to see if they could crawl out. I got a kick out of the timer running out and seeing how close it would get. If they got out, then good for them. I didn’t do it for bm, actually kinda hoped most of them crawled out. Once someone did this to me with unbreakable and i found it pretty funny
---
I slugged a Feng min just so I could go fuck a Claudette and get a 4k.😐
---
Monopoly is not good, though. A more optimistic vision would be more of such games coming out from other developers, and actually being awesome, so not only we have more amazing games to play, but it would also motivate BHVR to do better and better.
---
I remember my friend telling me about this meme in 2017 lmao. THIS is how you do reposts, people. It's funny, and hasn't been seen in a LONG time.
---
Wow, that's nice! Congratulations :)
---
*laughs in buffed Unbreakable*

tunneling is a player choice, you can't physically remove it without limiting a players options  
---
tunneling isn't fun but there is no way to stop it, even if borrowed time is still baseline, you'd get tunneled, people get tunneled when it already isn't so what would making these types of perks baseline solve?
---
He got banned? Good, he was really annoying. What did he get banned for?
---
I'm actually not against it fully, tbh
---
Seeing people get super excited by stuff and playfully saying "oink" in relation to a character they like is cute imo. I support that bit. 
---
It's the rallying and being rude to others I refuse to condone.
---
Not for long...
---
Totally. I love both games, hopefully Behaviour can work something out.
---
Try
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG
---
Wisely said, and i understand where youre coming from. I just think the constant mindless oinking is unnecessary and cringey, but thats just my opinion
---
Bad manners. It's behaviour like taunting or teabagging in poor sportsmanship.
---
Yea I know, it would be pretty douchy
---
Wow... I never realised he was THAT dedicated to the Pig. That's kind of cringeworthy.
---
When you think about it, dwight is just a bro. Everyone hates for no reason, did poor in school, abandond by people he thought were friends, and has a bad reputation in game. Yet this fucking dude still has co-opertive perks like bond, leader, and prove thyself. This bro goes would go though hell to make you a sandwich.
---
Nurse can be extremely frustrating, that is why I never play her (Outside of the accidental picks)
---
Also huntress
---
Counterpoint ; Ghost Face
---
I know what I said
---
Yeah, pretty crazy
---
Yeah I forgot to throw a noed on when I was doing this as leatherface. Even all I did was smack the person when they went for the chest. And even then they felt the need to hit me with a “?”     My chests bitch.
---
well its ulta rare, and only really good addon on him, with the game offering or pallet town its really strong, imo
---
hey, you put hillbilly and frank in the wrong spot, here, lemme help you
---
*swaps billy and legion*
---
there we go, much better
---
It’s almost like everyone wouldn’t run Ruin if gens weren’t done at the speed of light and kicking them was basically useless but hey I’m about to be shot down by everyone because I am a “salty killer main”
---
Nope sorry nothing like sawing down survivors across map with Billy 
---
Also have not played Legion like at all so I only put him there as filler until I play him for real
---
Can relate lol
---
And where exactly is Patrick Bateman?? I think he has some great potential as a survivor-sized killer like the legion.
---
No mither
---
my guy is acting like this tier list is an official one
---
Ebrietas ,Daughter of the Cosmos from Bloodborne lmao
---
I have just under 1500 hours in and main nea/meg too. I'm also est time xb1. Gamertag HornWATER. Unfortunately I'm mainly available fridays-saturdays.
---
Not really, you'd think the (*gasp*) and sarcasm with it would make that a bit clear, every tier list is an opinion
---
He's behind them, can't you see??
---
Maybe because she's licensed?
---
Nah he’s standing still don’t you know Wraith goes completely invisible while standing still
---
How the hell is Doctor not S tier? He’s probably the most fun Killer to play as.
---
Lmao, accurate. Sweaty billies and nurses as far as the eye can see.
---
It’s arch nemesis is also a giant space whale.
---
Because I don’t play him enough also I’m kind of salty at him because I’m my opinion he’s like the only killer that I think is annoying to play against
---
Removed for wrong tag
---
She's doing gens, u?
---
Didn't gen times used to be shorter?
---
Yeah, with a lot of power like him lol. That's pretty trippy though
---
cosplay as the doctor with this fun new game!
---
*All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy*
---
Ah yeah I remember being afraid of the dark when I saw the movie when I was younger
---
the iridescent hatchets are hell
---
It's a pretty even playing field, both The Entity and Pennywise are both beings that exist within there own realms/dimensions.
---
There should be a re-rework of them, similar to freddy. something like
---
1) Legion can tag 4 generators of his choice, positioning other members of the legion as well as themselves, in order to be able to instantly teleport between them at will with no cooldown
---
2) After teleporting, a husk of that character spawns in your place, which walks towards the generator they are assigned. You can still teleport to that husk. if the husk locates a survivor within a (whatever degree is killer's fov) cone, before reaching the generator, the husk goes towards them and tries to attack them. if survivor disappears from their line of sight, the husk goes to the last place it seen the survivor and searches the area for 15 seconds.
---
I kind of wish it was the old Freddy not the movie remake one
---
Wraith can now say the n-word
---
I don't think that's tunneling, if I'm understanding your comment right. The part about actively ignoring other people, though, does describe tunneling
---
Their faces could be distorted as well. Like Amanda's model, who has white eyes. The hillbilly might've been born that way etc
---
Unbreakable, but most importantly is the dead hard!! Great play
---
I just realized I've never seen a Claudette with Dead Hard. O_o
---
You forgot Spirit too. 
---
All I get at red ranks are Billies and Spirits on PS4. It's disgusting.
---
He's the "uncle we don't talk about"
---
That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard
---
Right, because everyone runs the instadown perk for a 4% speed boost...
---
This goes both ways mate
---
The next killer is going to be Evil Bong, pure perfection.
---
I think it's a newer placement. I noticed it not too long ago and then saw a Reddit post about it. Now this one. It must be new
---
Insta downs are easily countered by simple looping. Combined with the speed increase makes looping not viable anymore. 
---
Also you have to consider that there aren’t many pallets left when noed can activate.
---
Does he punch drywall?
---
I hate how often I get accused of lag switching. Any game that has a lag spike and i get messages saying WeRE yOu TrYiNg To LaG SwItCh?
---
I hardly even know what that is, i know what it is but not the slightest idea of how to go about starting the process. I'm guessing it's something that's easier done or more accessible on PC rather than console.
---
Yes when I start losing a game I throw on my black hoodie and guy fawkes mask and break into the lag mainframe and upload the high ping packets into the user lag file
---
r/dbdgonewild material tbh
---
How about we don't steal artwork and post it without their consent?
---
I like to think that people who DC early are just raging so hard from having 3 or 4 shitty games in a row. Fresh start run straight into the killer and get hooked and are just like "fuck this". So I tend to give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
But sure, it is never in the survivors interest to DC. Sometimes they do it when they are pissed off mid game as they are about to die. I'm just thinking, poor move dude, you just lost a load of BP because you didn't want to 'lose anymore face' to the killer.
---
Nice one! It’s a shame you couldn’t teabag him :(
---
That's Julie silly
---
12 hooks is already frustrating enough for someone who tries to play killer in a fair way.
---
This is why I run unbreakable - to avoid getting screwed over unfairly by toxic killers who want to waste my time
---
spirit can get 4k by sweaty afk :)
---
Any perk that causes your to wiggle faster would be OP.
---
If gens are done and all 4 are still alive you might as well take the loss as bing bong
---
HEY...that’s a good point
---
Mad Grit you skrublord
---
What in the entity's name is this? its just... bruh
---
I think with the inclusion of more killers into the base pack Nintendo will up the price :/ So far which killers are included aren’t even confirmed. I’m hoping for cross play too because otherwise I don’t see there being viable wait times.
---
I'm one of the ones who would click flashlights and stuff at pallets, but to me it's all in good fun, that same game if you mind game me really hard, ill give you a gg and comliment your mindgame. I won't get salty at killer if it's my fault.
---
Everyone keep saying there are no pallets left when NOED becomes active, last I checked NOED doesn't break pallets, just stop throwing them so frequently.
---
A tier 3 myers with bamboozle and fire up get's pretty close to hurdling those windows though!
---
He basically kicked our ass throughout the match.  I was completely off my game, making lots of stupid mistakes too.  Then this happened.....
---
Yeah I've definitely been there. It's like a vortex pulls you back into the killers hit 😑.
---
Spine Chill actually super counters Prayer Beads And If you wanna go even further, run Iron will so she can’t sneak you with sound.
---
I'm not sure if it's funny or sad :D
---
GET DONE BILLY.   
---
This makes me so happy
---
Naked, with a chainsaw.
---
Honestly I’ve recommended this build to a couple of my friends &amp; it helped them get this trophy! As it has gotten me this trophy (twice I must say) the build is brutal strength, ruin, play with your food and dying light!
---
Well since the killer is the server until the dedicated servers are being implemented you are screwing over 4 other players when you play with bad connections... So, yeah they are fully in their right to protect other players from your shitty internet connection.
---
just use it after the second hook
---
thats one of the oddest crossovers ive ever seen.
---
The only thing alien about him is his head, everything else I can find on a 6'2 jamaican dude.
---
Hell yes !!
---
it depends of the survivors level. When they obviously don't know the basis, they won't even understand that you 're going easy on them. And it let them learn a bit rather than being destroyed and frustrated.
---
But can the killer a similar skill then that negates or turn that perk around on the survivor if he/she isn't running the perk? I think not...
---
Lmao omggg you still have like 100 pallets and multiple tiles to run
---
haha or in his suit/the rain coat he uses to split Paul's skull, etc. I was thinking maybe he could have a nailgun that slows survivors but you need to aim it pretty precisely, and then a main melee axe like huntress
---
BBQ 1 MYC 3 NOED 3 LULL 3
---
Damn Bitch you build like this?
---
But yeah the salt on that guy is palpable
---
Dr. Acula.
---
Thing is: as a killer you kinda have to play with your food to even get points and pips. Sure at high ranks you can bet your behind that I'll go on a rampage with no regards for honor codes or fake rules, but why do that to people that haven't even seen totems in their playtime (somebody actually asked me what Devour Hope was last game) so time for to take off Ruin and have fun
---
Just shows that even killers can be toxic arseholes like some survivors.
---
I know. I love the game but the communities level of toxic ness is kinda worrisome.  Killers lose one game, ask for  the survivors to be nerfed, or survivors lose a game, and ask for killers to be nerfed. I feel like gen times need to be increased or ruin isn’t a perk but killers all have it.
---
Legion in d tier huh? Not a big fan of edgelord mc chainstabs?
---
Not saying that that guy was right in what he said, but it’s a little harsh to say he’s what’s wrong with the community considering the scenario.
---
This is some good shit here Lmao
---
Except it doesn't happen all the time. And when it starts I stop playing. They're basically saying tjat people who have lag spikes shouldn't play. As if they didn't already have enough reason for killers to leave.
---
A reanimated puppet like a ventriloquist's doll or a scarecrow would be ace, although we already have two scarecrow cosmetics.
---
The puppet could be Hag-sized, as they're usually quite big. The problem is the human-rule, but it may be fair if it's possessed by a human spirit
---
Just keep in mind that you're a better person than them. Remember that you just wanna have fun and that they are incapable of having fun with a game. I guarantee that you are living a happier, more wholesome life than these toxic people who have nothing better to do than to get that upset over a meaningless video game. I'm a killer main, and whenever someone says some shit to me I just give them either a "&lt;3" or a ":)" and move on with my day because in the end I'm living my best life and these dudes are just out here trying to get us to feel as shitty as they do on the inside. Keep at the killing game my friend, their words dont mean shit. :D
---
WGLF should also give stacks when you are in chase\\doing gen and a survivor is safely rescued CHANGE MY MIND
---
I'm not going to run Spine Chill and/or Iron Will just on the chance that I'm going to see one specific killer with one specific add on. And the game shouldn't be balanced that way either... The inherent counterplay to the Spirits already strong ability should just exist regardless of her add ons.
---
You can tell they are solos if they load in separately. 
---
Ruin gets cleansed too quickly for me. Only had one game in about 500 hours where it lasted more than 30 seconds. I get more use out of Make Your Choice or NOED.
---
NOED is easily countered by doing dull totems. There aren’t even skill checks. It’s literally that easy. I always immediately feel for the killer when more than 1 person is using adrenaline.
---
Yeah not like I looked the killer for 5 minutes while they did a gen then when I popped the last gen (after they went down in 20 seconds) I didn't deserve hatch... Fuck off :)
---
Sabo, Mettle of Man body block, Flashlight, inevitable ability of stabbing us to death considering it’s 
---
A  S  H
---
This has been hell as a new player, I've been trying for 2 days to play this game as the concept is just awesome. Every game I'm dying and getting salt thrown at me. Then I check that stats and everyone is there with like full perks and stifff while i have like 1 perk. 
---
So I try killer and get put with survivors covered in  blood skin, who loop around then just T-bag at the exit. Like shit, sorry I'm not amazing yet, just trying to learn here. 
---
Started just doing what I would do in real life, when people are being assholes I just walk away. Like literally, if I go to the exit and all the survivors are just there t-bagging, I'll just walk away, sometimes they will follow me, but I ain't interested.
---
I am a killer main, but it is very shitty of you to judge my playstyle based on my perk choices. 
---
Every game I am the first person to jump on a gen and after doing two of them I start hunting totems.
---
Yes, my play style is sneaky but I am usually the highest productive in my team.
---
And that flashlight is there because I am using up all the stuff in my inventory before I can begin prestiging.
---
I did mine with Ruin, Dying Light, Play With Your Food and Corrupt Intervention.
---
 Unfortunately that’s not the case for me. Im rank 3 right now, and whenever I get 2 or 3 kills as clown or trapper, people message me and say BHVR should remove bloody coil from trapper, and other add ons that even give me a chance to get some kills at high ranks.
---
So you think you are entitled to special treatment because you don't know better and play on potato internet? Switch providers or just don't play a game with  peer to peer. It sucks but BHVR is in no way supposed to compensate you for your own poor judgement.
---
1 game out of 20, that's been like every fuckin game for me for the past 2 days
---
God no
---
[Sure, blame it on your ISP.](https://youtu.be/HGBOeLdm-1s)
---
&gt;"They're basically saying that people who have lag spikes shouldn't play."  
---
No fucking shit they shouldn't play. It might not be in their control, but they are ruining the experience of others, especially when they're the host of the lobby.
---
Then all is well :) I think I didn't express My point well enough.. Most Clauds I see do as I said. But if You aren't doing such, then great..!
---
Not really his play style is very different from Myers and also he has to play a lot more stealthy then Myers
---
You used 'You' as if you are addressing me. That is a prejudiced behaviour
---
Man, that guy has some sweet-ass DSL. Juicy.
---
thats not how this works, not how any of this works
---
Oohh, did I? Sorry, I meant no harsh words, just the stereotype is widely used.
---
seems solid except Thanatophobia. That perk is just too weak
---
I stop playing when it bugs out. They're banning me for no goddamn reason. If they're going to ban me for "cheating" then they should reimburse me for purchasing a their game. I didn't break any of their rules.
---
Get a new provider or make sure it isnt your router.
---
No Babadook? So homophobic!
---
I really hate how DCing has just become normalized. People do it casually and talk about it afterwards like it's common sense to just quit the game for no reason.
---
Actually, I am. Since this is a "Joke", pls tell me what needs change here. thx
---
Hahahahaha
---
Shad yes
---
What is that click bait title
---
Desperate for what? He/She was just giving a nice compliment to a good cosplay...
---
Sacrifice ONLY, each of the original 4 survivors 25 times each
---
This was a pleasant surprise, I’m on palace 5 &gt;!(Okumura)!&lt; right now and I can’t wait to see the ending, I think Feng would take Star from Hifumi cause y’know, good strategies require a lot of focus.
---
In all honesty you’re a killer &amp; they’re in your lobby! You play how you want! Your job as a killer is to kill! No matter how you do it as long as you’re not hacking it’s fine! And as a survivor their job is to survive no matter the cost! So you do you and don’t worry about what others say or think!
---
You can unlock em bu killing meg/Claudette/Dwight/jake 25 times
---
You'll unlock them if you kill Meg, Dwight, Claudette and Jake 25 times each. So killing 25 Megs gives you Athlete face for example
---
NOED increases speed too. Thats why its a crutch. You will 100% down any survivor you see because you basically have permanent bloodlust and an insta down. 
---
4% is alot. Difference between Huntress and Billy is 5%. Huntress has problems catching up to people using buildings on the swamp maps or Ormond. Its a pretty significant difference
---
that's just facecamping
---
Never knew you could get Leatherface cosmetics. They've never shown before for me.
---
I personally prefer: charges at the window, leaps and effectively breaks the window in the process of vaulting it like a majestic eagle.. pilotting a blimp
---
RIP in peace
---
Youre rank 16 you havent even played against real survivors yet
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
It is also extremely boring for both sides
---
Poor Billy... Why can't they give him a normal looking skin? I am tired of wearing the skins given by Bloodstained Sack DLC. Even this summer skin I could consider buying if they hadn't added that beard.
---
Nah im having the time of my life
---
Why? I still want someone dead. I'm not just gonna give up.
---
I would get him. He has cool perks too. Thrilling Tremors is pretty insane on almost every killer.
---
there’s should be some
---
punishment for people that disconnecting LITERALLY ruin the game for the other 4 that are playing.
---
Just like in rocket league
---
Blasphemy!
---
I still remember the guy that was re-animated while decapitated. I think a headless killer could be fine.
---
Well, his co-workers did leave him in the forest presumably for dead in his original lore, This doesn't seem to farfetch'd,
---
At least this one isn't like black and blue where he got beaten and tortured by a maniac with a chainsaw and a sledgehammer.
---
I like to imagine that everyone in DBD is friends because... I mean.... who else will they talk to lol. It isn’t like the weird spider god or the murderous killers are good at talking. Unless he really is that unlikeable :( #getdwightsomefriends
---
As been stated many times already, Behavior did NOT get the rights to Ghostface from Scream, meaning they didn't get the rights to add Sidney. They got the rights to the mask, which is not the property of the producers of Scream. This was the only way to get Ghostface in the game. 
---
And as for the Freddy thing, it's true that he has properties similar to Hag and Doc. But his previous kit was problematic for balance. He was an M1 killer without any chase power, only stalling power, which means the only way he could have won was through the war of attrition. That sets up the same balance dichotomy that Nurse suffers from currently. The killer is either gonna be OP or hot garbage, there's no in between. If they wanted old Freddy's power to be balanced then the entire game would have to be reworked around it. Reworking Freddy was much easier on BHVRs part.
---
Not op.
---
Understandable. Have a good day sir.
---
I do like the icon tho makes me think they got so scared the character had an aneurysm or stroke
---
Important, Moris do NOT count.
---
A strong and independant Entity.
---
Toxic,
---
Why don’t you play normally against her?
---
Personally I try to avoid tunneling as its not fun for either side really but sometimes you have no choice. I run the Make your choice perk a lot so I very rarely camp and hopefully use the perk to catch a new target instead of the one who just got saved.
---
What about tbagging before leaving?
---
They always cleanse my totem.
---
[Watch as I follow the obsession around for 5 gens and then fry him with Rancor.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/438003384?t=00h16m03s) I ran out of Mori's because salty entitled survivors would DC to cuck me out of my daily and I decided if they're not gonna play nice, I'm just gonna cheese with rancor until someone doesn't DC.
---
Stupid strat but so are Mori dailies.
---
Play with your food was a big must for me as the judith's tombstone slow makes every pallet loop super punishing.  It doesnt 'extend' the game but it shortens the time it takes for you to kill survivors.
---
I didn't say that Spine Chill was bad. My point is that using perks to counter specific add ons for specific killers isn't a good way to balance the game. Especially when the killer is top tier without the add on.
---
[Entry 49, just above “Sightings” ](https://archive.deadbydaylight.com/manual/lore/)
---
any killer that use noed is trash
---
Other than having no power and wasting a big chunk of time if he hits the survivor he was stalking.
---
I think it's a good idea. Easily countered too.... if you grab them before they finish the unhook or even just down them before they finish it. I honestly think this perk would be a little underwhelming but good in very select situations
---
That's a good question. The Entity most likely does have a few boundaries regarding that, but seeing as he's trapped Freddy Kreuger and other "licensed killers," he could possibly trap Pennywise and transfer him into his realm.
---
I think they changed it to work against BBQ tbh. I have no idea. No one runs Sole Survivor so it's hard to find the info. Haha
---
It sure as hell isn't pipping.
---
If you won't use pallets, you lower your chances to even make it into the endgame.
---
Like less than half of what it is now.
---
they have their own lore on the website, Julie, Joe and other chick I forgot the name were manipulated by Frank into stealing and it got worse and worse until one day they got caught and murdered some guy.  
---
I like your version better to be honest.
---
It's good with Resilience too since they brought back the vault speed. I just prefer other perks.
---
I would like it if the other Legion members appeared at a different location just at a place where no one can go to and was just laughing and talking to each other.
---
I remember someone suggesting that. So they felt more like crazy teens or something
---
Nea is a killer  
---
NOED op
---
This guy is legit just a troll don’t worry. He made another post saying he ‘trolls hooked survivors’ by facecamping them. Just don’t take him seriously lmao
---
You said you prefer a more stealthy play style so I would tell you: don't crunch walk or hide too much in corners when the killer is near, keep always some security distance if you want to hide otherwise if you get spotted you are just going to give him a free first hit and the duration of your chase will be halved.
---
For mindgames: always keep an eye on the killer or the red light in front of him, if you can't understand what the killer is going to do and you have a bad visual, just leave that corner and go for another near pallet or window. Probably the killer is moonwalking and trying to land some strange hit around a corner or through a pallet so he has not a great view on you too.

---
It's not even fully out yet, hopefully they fix everything wrong with it but if not there's still console and PC versions
---
Devs should add IT as Entity skin, I would buy immediately
---
Freddy needed a rework not a buff. He was super cancerous.
---
I don't get angry about much in the game, but sandbagging is about the only thing I've ever been grumpy about. 2 rank 2s, 2 rank 20s when I was less than 50 hours in. Flashlights galore. First and only game I've ever dc'ed from.
---
 There isn't a toxic survivor, there isn't a toxic killer, there's just people who play with what the game has given. You want to spam the window and exploit the vault bug? Go ahead if you need to do that to cheat. You want to go to haddonfield with BL? Good on you! NOED and Blood Warden? Sweet.
---
With lots of u's
---
It's only bannable if it was pre-arranged and you tried to find that killer specifically to work with them.  As far as establishing a killers trust and working with them in game it's not really punishable unless they pre-arranged it (can usually tell if they did because they're usually friends with the person.)
---
Original killers best killers
---
Surprisingly this rank reset's a lot better than the last one though. The last time it was rank reset, every game was lost because no one did gens. Now half the games I play, survivors actually do loop the killer and do gens.
---
Something maybe like hellraiser or the licensed hell raiser
---
Yes
---
Nope there's no way to prevent it.
---
Hes african so he always could
---
Haha, this bug is so good sometimes
---
The most accurate drawing of Claudette in her natural habitat to date.
---
Don't know why your getting downvoted, technically by Dev standards getting 2 kills is the intended amount of kills per game. In this game the player defines what it is to win,  for some killers they need to 4k to feel good about themselves, for some survivors they need to escape while Bming the killer. For some it's all about that sweet bloodpoints and getting as much of it as possible.  And lastly, there's those just trying to have fun playing cat and mouse in a horror motif.
---
what about hockey mask boi (probaly gonna get a lawsuit if they add him)
---
There needs to be a big buff killer who can just smash through vaults that break them for a certain amount of time.
---
Pennywise could be interesting...
---
Is it me or I can't see anything or click links.
---
People really dont know the facts, gen time solo 80 seconds fair, gen time 3 people 33 seconds, fair, but gen times with 2 people is a mere 44 seconds, adding a single person onto a gen cuts objective time for the whole game in half.
---
Oooh they got caught?
---
The rework is better but he needed at the least a huge buff. Some killers, like Plague(to me), aren't great but they don't need a buff.
---
Where did you get that information?
---
Misery loves company lol all alone and it can't stand it
---
Ruin lasting 30 seconds is worth it though because you dont get steamrolled
---
dbd
---
"Switch providers."
---
Some of us don't have second options, bud. I only play survivor because I'm scared of "ruining people's games" on rural internet I cannot change the provider of.
---
Don't play a game I enjoy? That's my only option? Must be nice to have good internet and be this selective.
---
I play P3C a lot and it feels like I do three gems every match. Maybe you never notice because you can’t see me?
---
The real villain is Jake Park. If he isn’t destroying a hook or farming someone, he’s DCing.
---
Why? Nazis are fine, they'd just have to censor swastika, if there is one in the design.
---
No. They are saying if it happens like 6 times it's bannable. Not 1 or 2.
---
Every god damn fucking meme you fucking pathetic petry fucking children go "haha well survivors use adrenaline so it goes both ways" jesus christ this sub is fucking boring.
---
I wish DBD would push for a graphics update on some of the map models. Some of the older maps just feel like they need a touch up on quality
---
Wow, That’s actually pretty awesome xD Omg
---
Have you actually got banned yet?
---
Make your choice allows you to insta down the rescuer which can slow the game down more as the injured one runs off to heal.
---
? Whats your point?
---
His power sounds like a "oh I use this, then find you and kill you then move on to someone else and kill them" he is kinda like the doctor with his tracking but too strong in my opinion, could be countered with some lower stats to lunge/speed to make him easier to run around so when he does find someone they have a chance to escape
---
I get where youre coming from but thats just objectively wrong  you dont buff or nerf something because its popular or not, theres so much more  that goes into these decisions and the work. please go to uni before making a game or at least dont quit your day job.
---
You had me until you insulted my pig lol, nice meme though.
---
No. She doesn't need a rework. Just a small adding to a reason to cleanse
---
Lmfao thanks for this
---
I have slow reaction times so when ruin is up I'm gonna go find it.
---
Same, I wish they would add a casual mode with no ranks so I could just you know, enjoy the fucking game. I don't wanna be chugging g-fuel using 10% off codes &amp; be ran around by some tbaggers 10+ hours, it's just tedious and exhausting. I wanna hop on and just relax, mix the noobs with tryhards it would be fine. And if players with certain skill levels don't want to be randomly matched they could still go in ranked
---
I agree. The end of the game isn’t as important to me as the game itself &amp; I don’t think it’s meant to.  To me, it’s all about the adrenaline, horror-themed elements, &amp; the chase. Getting pissed because you don’t survive every game so you insult the killer or facecamping to get body counts is just not productive. 
---
Everyone just needs to chill lol
---
I have, and I don't care. It'd stupid to complain about the killer doing their job. Are they supposed to just ignore a weaker suvivior because they say so?
---
Bruh I've been having the best rank reset. I've only been face camped a couple times. I almost feel like a survivor main.
---
Bond instead of self care imo
---
to be fair, nurse is OP, so like
---
I mean, of course some builds/perks/add ons/maps are more frustrating than others, that's a given and I am not trying to defend them.
---
Had a kate one of my games that d/c'd on first hook. We ended up not taking the rest of match seriously afterwards.
---
He clearly does have a power.
---
If you hit a survivor you are stalking then you are stalking him wrong. If you hit him anyway, then you are in the same position as if you had successfully stalked him - i.e. he will go down instantly.
---
I'm just offering my opinion. Nobody has any concrete reasons so far. Just downvotes, vague points and people feeling attacked. This is the problem with the killer community.
---
You cared enough to reply
---
Because suviviors expect you to follow made up rules. Play how you want. If you want to tunnel, tunnel. It's your job to kill the suviviors after all
---
Plague, Nurse and Ghostface skins will come out on random Wednesdays between the 23rd of July and the Chapter 13 release.
---
The red-masked Trapper skin is confirmed as a Switch exclusive. Makes me wonder why it's in this patch, if the Switch version isn't launching until September/October. Beta maybe?
---
The Hag, Hillbilly and other Trapper skins will all be part of an upcoming, Hallowed Blight-style Summer Event.
---
To be fair this sub is a complete dumpster fire too.
---
Its a meme you dip
---
This also applies to driving.
---
I always hate how I get potatoteammates and rank 1 killers.
---
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE
---
Dude I legit have friends who are Rank 1 and still can't do gens when there is Ruin, I usually play killer because of this
---
Never heard of this game but this comment has made it a top priority
---
.. What does that contribute to a conversation? Honest to god dude, these guys were having a relatively civil conversation but there always has to be one of you guys in the thread.. grow up.
---
Legion was a car crash from the get go. If not for the reason behind this meme, then because it is basically a survivor.
---
It is a survivor with a knife, dressed like a chav, who go around causing trouble in neighbourhoods. They have nothing on any of the other killers in terms of horror feel.
---
The other game mady by DBD's devs. It's a lot more fast paced, and killers (called Hunters there) have ranged weaponry.
---
He's not just an easier Myers. They have a completely different playstylr where Myers can drop a stalk at any point with no penalty and snowball easier. If anything Myers is easier (and no stronger)
---
Michael X Amanda best ship.
---
Jack the Ripper was a real person, with real victims. Unlikely BHVR will ever cross that line.
---
Norman Bates wasn't much of a typical slasher villian. Wouldn't fit the game.
---
Creater of Jeeper's Creepers is a sex offender, so no.
---
Friday the 13th: the Game is not going anywhere, unfortunately.
---
Pinhead (Hellraiser) wouldn't suit the game.
---
Pennywise is most likely, but still unlikely.
---
I'd put my money on Candyman.
---
how 2 gain karma?
---
"Smell my finger" was my favorite
---
&gt; Are they going to be fixed with dedicated servers?
---
No? Main problem with long queue times is that there are not enough survivors. If there are 100 killers waiting for the game, they need 400 survivors for fast matchmaking. But what if there are only 350 queueing? Or even less? And this won't change with dedicated servers.
---
Increasing BP gains for survivors might help. Timeouts/bans for DC might help (solo queues won't be as frustrating as they're now). But servers? I doubt they'll change much.
---
Heres another one
---
Well, let's review;
---
Pennywise requires fear in order to be effective. Without being able to cause fear in its victims, Pennywise can easily be fucked over. Case in point, a group of children were able to overpower it.
---
The Entity can not feel fear, as far as we know. It's also capable of extreme manipulation, can strengthen killers, and can create various realms.
---
Pennywise's greatest strength is his biggest weakness. Yes, being able to manifest as an individual's greatest fear is a great tool, but eventually, the individual will become so scared that they end up fighting back.
---
Heres one more ^
---
Jack will never be added, I know BHVR said they wanted to stay away from real life and/or religious killers. I know they semi broke this with Plague but they said it was because they didn't base it on any exact religion that was active.
---
Pinhead or another Cenobite  (SP?) would be the most likely added. Maybe like ghostface they could license the names and imagery of the series and make their own. Pinhead would be fun, have a hook power that gave a ranged insta grab that required you to reel the survivors in. Make it similar to a struggle mechanic that give survivors a chance to escape. Make it so you have to reel it on missed hits so there is risk reward aspect of it.
---
People really dont know about jeepers creepers huh?
---
BHVR has stated they'll never do killers that are based on real life murders. So no Jack the Ripper. Jason Voorhees will probably never be added because not only does he have his own game, but the license for the Friday the 13th IP is in a legal shit storm right now that's looking like it won't be resolved for years.
---
Norman Bates, Pennywise and Jeepers Creepers are all definite maybes, but I wouldn't be surprised if Hellraiser gets added to the game.
---
Entity doesn’t “trap” the killers. He either tricks them or persuades them into joining him like Rin and Kenneth.  Otherwise he abuses them into submission like Evan. And he kidnaps survivors. No idea how he would trick or kidnap Pennywise.
---
depends, by "dead on hook" do you mean having them be on the first hook until They're dead? Thats kinda toxic, but no offense.
---
Also, Noed and unrelentless on Billy? why not Enduring and Spirit Fury?
---
Pretty sure he’s bursting with sarcasm here, he’s mocking people that do this and apparently enjoy it.
---
This feels like a trap...
---
Or maybe he is like you are all getting grabbed and killed by hand even if in the healthy state as he gets the Evil Incarnate trophy. It takes three survivors to be fully stalked to stay permanently in tier 3.
---
Thrill of the Hunt? I would spend my time stalking, not protecting totems
---
ignore it this game has a lot of people like that. NOED is frowned upon as well, and some groups of survivors have a mindset that if they dont escape, ur tunnelling and camping etc etc.
---
Just keep on playing and enjoy yourself, dont let the negatives determine ur entire experience of this game!
---
it's not for protecting, it's for finding survivors, usually they will commit destroying it so they can feed you a lot
---
Bingo, but I strongly feel your point was right; play for fun. I can't even get upset at teabaggers. If that makes them happy? Do it.
---
Spirit doesn’t naturally know where you are, there are perks that give the killer survivor locations. You can also run “Spine Chill” which is a pretty good counter to spirit. Also what is it that you suggest should be changed about her Phase Walk, you can’t just say “Nerf this” without attempting to explain what it is that needs to be nerfed about it.
---
Both of those addons increase the amount of stalking you need. You need to extend the time of the match if you want to hit tier 3 Evil Within
---
I have to disagree. Myers still has a format that you have to work with if you want to use his power effectively. Ghostface is creep around until you find a survivor, or a survivor looks at you for too long. There is no penalty to failing a stalk. He can expose people easier than Myers.
---
You will find Myers commit to their power (or taking the 0 terror radius and committing to that strategy) in order to get the full benefits of exposed. You will see them playing the way the character is meant to be played.
---
You don;t see this with ghostface. There is freedom to do what they want because there is no downside to using or failing to use his power.
---
Not sure how you count not having a terror radius as anti stealth gameplay. That's the whole point of him stalking, aka being stealthy. Also, can't his ability be negated by being seen? I don't play him, so I could be wrong here, but he's definitely more stealth heavy than Myers, who doesn't really have a pure stealth playstyle outside of tier 1 Evil Within. You could say exactly the same for Myers. He doesn't have to play stealthy, but he can be stealthy.
---
hows that trolling?
---
thats BM
---
A good Troll would be to, destroy them with Burger King Myers, or Heavy Smoker Nurse
---
That leaves it uo to luck to make sure your totems are next to each other, otherwise you’ll lose your Ruin. I wouldn’t risk it. I’d run Dying Light to slow the game down to a halt
---
Because he’s a simple man
---
When everyone on the gen can get their gen taps synchronized &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Yes, the Stephen Chow one.
---
He is the drunk uncle, he is probably throwing up right now.
---
Seriously. You can generally find it in the first 60 seconds of a match if you've got an eye line to the killer, or can hear the heartbeat simply because most of them walk directly to it as soon as the match starts.
---
The thing is, though, that this happens to me when I’m in a chase, often with the killer shack. I always forget about the infamous killer shack pallet because I get so hung up over how much I’ll enjoy seeing them hanging in the basement, but then *wha-pow*! A fractured skull and a heart attack.
---
NOED rewards killers for losing. Adrenaline rewards survivors for winning. NOEDs counter going across the map looking for totems while 2 teammates get hooked and that dull totem is very important so they both just die. Then your other teammate dies. Killer close hatch. You got 4 totems, bam, insta down from noed right before you finish the gate. Great counterplay, right?
---
dunno, this build works a lot for me, anyone can run whatever they want instead
---
all i can say is that Whispers and Corrupt Intervention are a must pick if you want to prevent survivors from doing gens and getting them fast
---
its Open Beta
---
Keep in mind using a med kit instead of a good toolbox does reduce your repair speed by a decent %.
---
Imo the optimal startegy is to use an item based on your playstyle. If you are using flashy clothes and you like to be in the killer's face, med kit &gt; toolbox. If you like to be the official repairman of the team, then toolbox is better.
---
It‘s just the truth so whatever.
---
Clickbait doesnt go well here pal...
---
This
---
I think you are right mostly if you consider "meta game". Let's say you are an SWF and everyone on the team use bond instead of self care, its DEFINETLY better since it gives much more altruism points to the whole team. Self care gives 0 points to anyone.
---
In solo it depends. I've sometimes had partners refuse to heal me -_-
---
oh, did not know that
---
even then idgaf I want The Creeper
---
I mean shouldn't he belong to new line cinema?
---
I'm not saying popularity. I'm saying if at, say, red ranks in dead by daylight, there is very few killers being used those killers must be far better than the alternatives. That's what i was trying to say but it might have come off wrong. Killers can be popular but if other killers are not viable options something is wrong.
---
I was about to ask where wraith was and then realized I'm a fucking idiot
---
Learn something new every day! I didnt know that about jeepers
---
imagine using noed lol
---
thats one of the reasons for dedicated servers
---
Oh shit did I tag this as “looking for advice?” My bad it’s supposed to be shitpost
---
Alright out of these 3 which one is the most annoying to deal with? I have to say ghost face.
---
Starting to think the bug where the female Legion members make manly grunts isn't an actual mistake on the devs part.
---
Did you make this? This is sweet
---
Say what you want about r/oinkers_ (the people there are kind of annoying) but pig is not the worst killer and she looks cool
---
That's a question left to professionals. I'm not too immersed in lore, but I know the basics of it all.
---
Damn it someone beat me to it
---

---
SLUGGING TIME
---
I agree, I used to be on that sub, but it got really bad. At first it seemed like a meme, but then I realized they *really* liked the pig. And when I disagreed with glen0ck he replied with some mod message about “it seems like you’re trying to spread hate, or didn’t understand my message”
---
I told everyone to stop spamming the sub, and even though I don’t think Glen0ck should’ve been banned, I agree that him and his weird cult subreddit are annoying as fuck
---
"why are you booing me, Im right!"  
---
But ye thats why we get spots like this. When the map generates its kinda hard to make consistent totem spawns without having the possibility of them becoming trapped by debris. The only thing worse than a totem in an obvious spot is a totem in a place the survivors physically cant reach it
---
Yea, but it’s manageable if they just stay in their own sub.
---
From all those I think Pinhead and Pennywise might be.
---
The others I don't see them happening:
---
Jack the ripper: he is pretty much a hystorical figuire, altough he has been used a lot in different games, somehow DBD doesn't seem like the game he would be in.
---
The creeper: he would fit in and he would be a fine addition, but due to the pedo stuff of the director or writer or someone like that, the BHVR team will stay away from it.
---
Jason: Has his own game and it's currently in a lawsuit that actually took a heavy blow to that game.
---
Pinhead: Yeah, maybe,
---
Pennywise: Yeah, why not.
---
If you are on Android, and the real Dead by Daylight doesn't appear, try this:
---
Download "Tap Tap": [https://www.tap.io/?utm\_source=taptap\_cn](https://www.tap.io/?utm_source=taptap_cn)
---
It's a chinese version of the Google Play Store, but, still, it's in english.
---
There, you can download Dead by Daylight. And then pray that you don't lag 2 much.
---
Ohhhh, okay.
---
True
---
*gets 2 "nerfs" to completely OP perks*
---
LoL ThIs GaMe Is SoOoOo KiLlEr SiDeD!!!
---
get nae naed
---
Sorry but plz dont make that much sense in this sub.
---
Well, even if that is the case (and I'm not sure, CoD released in Germany too, do they never speak about nazis?), it's not like characters have any interactions, so killer propably wouldn't shout "Hi, I'm a **nazi**" anyway. Would need to be careful while writing his backstory, but other than that it'd be fine.
---
You just proved his point about whining about unfair broken shit for one side whilst ignoring the advantages of the other side.  Congrats. Lol
---
It's pretty good since most survivors don't realize all they have to do is drop the pallet early to invalidate it entirely.
---
Damm you destroyed that guy
---
Feng has a gaming moment more heated than any recorded gaming moments in history
---
And make Blendettes even harder to spot? Top kek
---
pig. hate having my head pop off
---
On the other side of the coin it would also make stealth killers harder to spot
---
It feels less rewarding with points, more with fun. Depends on how ya view it. I prefer the thrill of being hunted and outsmarting killers with my buddy. If there was a rotating lobby (and I get why there isn't) where one is randomly given killer, I'd like em both a little more equally.
---
Well obviously, but you get a permanent T3 if you can pull it off.  With the 2 perks and ruin the game should be slow enough for him to get to T3.
---
Tunneling doesn't give you as many points. I personally always go after the person who saved. I want to be challenged in this game. Going after the person getting unhooked is too easy. That being said it usually doesn't matter to me because I am looking for gens to destroy and apply pressure to the map. I am looking for a high scoring 4k and a match that pushes players to think and use strategy.
---
Don't worry, redditters love taking morale highground and getting preachy about copyright. A lot of the time it is justified - because lots of stuff gets taken from reddit to places like FB, IG and 9gag. But assholes like this don't understand the difference between passing off things as their own, and harmlessly and honestly displaying posting a picture you found.
---
The ironic thing is most original memes and reddit content came from places like 4chan.
---
Damn, that's too bad... They really need to do something about all of that, based on this subreddit, I know that all of the killer mains have the same issue with queue times.
---
You had me until that last bit. I get it being an open beta, but the fact is stuff like locking base characters in the PC version behind premium purchases is a mess.
---
Also I doubt no matter how many changes they make the game will ever perform all that well. And also this level up system and the new bloodweb are soooo bad.
---
It’s enjoyable in a “Wow, this is almost as bad as F13 The Game” way though
---
Why would you run Sloppy Butcher if you’re trying to slow the game down? I just dont agree. Every perk should be helping you find survivors or slowing the game on a perma T3 Myers build. Aura reading perks like Bitter Murmur or something like Whispers or Spies from the Shadows.
---
While this is mostly true with how DbD is set up on consoles and PC I’m sure they earn plenty of money through the base game purchase, the chapters and paragraphs and the cosmetics store. 
---
Soon they’ll be making even more money once their battlepass system comes out and I seriously doubt they’re going to make enough from a cheap mobile game to justify its existence
---
*laughs in clown*
---
not so fast as f*** boi
---
And Herman.
---
Never played CoD, so I actually don't know, actually. Also his uniform might be problematic. But unless they actually incorporate him we probably won't find out anyways.
---
Should I cleanse dull totems in case the killer has noed? No, it's the killer who is wrong for taking that perk!
---
Should I learn to hit skill checks or just work through ruin? No, it's the killer who is wrong for taking that perk!
---
Should I accept that mori's are part of the game? No, it's the killer who is wrong for taking that addon!
---
What's people's obsession with pipping anyway? Why do you want to get to the repetitive, toxic red ranks so badly?
---
You actually managed to get into a match in that game.
---
This doesn’t really make sense because they disappear before you’ve even reached them
---
Even though this is overdone I never get tired of it.
---
Well, Herman's more of a towering person than buff, but I won't cloud your judgement with my perspective.
---
This works until around rank 13/12, when the survivors will just genrush your dumb ass.
---
Just realized all the girls are OC.
---
DC'ing pretty much ruins everyone's game bro
---
Only if we get his boxers outfit
---
Yeah lets just let killer mains continue to hate on survivors. /s
---
What a lovely fellow
---
Honestly taking off Self Care and using medkit improved QOL for me a lot but I'm still kinda new (150h) so I quickly ran out of my Medkits and because I don't have perks like Bond or Iron Will I'm kinda forced to use Self Care coz I don't want to rely on teammates (especially now after rank reset). It kinda sucks because it wastes a perk slot but I'm too scared to being injured for 90% of the match especially because I still tend to make mistakes while looping.
---
Riveting.
---
Yo wtf it’s real
---
The fact that survivors receive constant nerfs and killers do not.
---
They'll make more money of out a cheap mobile game version than they would if they didn't make a cheap mobile game version, just saying.
---
If the unhooking survivor is healthy, I will try to re-down the one who was hooked because I don’t have Make Your Choice yet and it’s simply more effective to do so. If they’re both injured I’ll try to down the unhooker (both to avoid Borrowed Time and to seem like less of a dick)
---
Theyre all pathetic hypocritical jackasses that make a lot of noise but never do anything, its tiring so instead of complain further i just unsubbed, removes the problem for everyone :)
---
Yea. But survivor mains like to call tunneling when it's usually just bad luck.
---
I hope you’re joking or maybe in the future take 3 seconds to read, I’m talking about Leatherface not Hillbilly, Hillbilly is top tier while Leatherface is an M1 killer at the bottom
---
Sorry...?
---
I'll never understand it. Buddy of mine hates red ranks, but also hates not pipping. Until they give ranks meaning, those people are a mystery to me
---
Its because up until recently survivors where the objectively overpowered side for like 3 years straight?
---
The rights reverted back to the same group that controls the name when they did the remake, IIRC. Either way, nothing F13 related can be done right now due to the lawsuit. The game even had to cancel new content because of it.
---
SWF and you use bond ??? Self-caring does give you bp =! 0
---
her husk doesn't turn, you just see her turning while she's channelling
---
What about Freddy? : (
---
*Cries in Legion*
---
Maybe they count disconnecting as soon as you make the lobby, like seeing 4x P3 Claudettes with flashlights and stuff join you and you back out to get a different group? Doesn't sound right but assuming your on the level its the only thing I can think of.
---
People keep saying killers are going to start complaining when we get dedicated servers but it's unlikely since what survivors usually see as bullshit hits look like connected hits to the killer. So the only difference when we get dedicated servers is that the survivors will see the hits too.
---
You know when you see a picture and you can just smell what it’s of. That.. but I wasn’t happy.
---
Empathy tier 3 is so insanely good. With proper use you can essentially always be aware of the killer's general location, plus always see where those sweet sweet healing bloodpoints are. Good for swf awareness of your teammates, and also good for solo for avoiding randos when they're taking the heat for you.
---
oh. well that's different then
---
Can you give some examples? I don't doubt you, I'd just like to know some references
---
To be honest, not at all. I played Nurse before but only at PC and only 4 times. They on the other hand, did a pretty fricking good job at annoying, looping, flashlighting and butt-dancing me. If it werent for their overly alturistic nature, I would have no chance against them.
---
They never let each other hang more than a minute or stay wounded. Although it took about half an hour, I managed to klill them all
---
It is quite sad for the bird. He just wants to fit in BibleThump.
---
r/blackmirror
---
Pop goes the weasel. Is also quite good at slowing the game. So stalking becomes your secondary objective.
---
I got this achievement with ruin, dying light, play with your food and whispers. You need to get 3 tokens of pwyf from your obsession and then kill it for dying light. As soon as you kill the obsession the remaining survivors most likely realise what's going go and will go full stealth mode, this is where you'll need whispers.
---
Yeah, bigger killers step over it. Smaller ones like Hag or Amanda just climb over it kinda slowly.
---
With the spawns always putting survivors together at the start of the game, I've started taking Prove Thyself a lot more when I don't take a toolbox. If the killer gets on someone else, you and one other person can smash a few gens in a few minutes easy.
---
Jokes on you, I get wrecked by the old freddy every time I face him
---
Thankfully that one seems to be slowly dying. I see in occasionally but not as frequent.
---
*points aggressively *
---
Couldn't they just put Marion Crane on her own like Ash?
---
Why did this get downvoted lol
---
Killers: Killing survivors is toxic, so moris and hooking survivors have been disabled, but you are banned for three days if you let someone bleed to death.
---
Survivors: Gen rushing is unhealthy, and so fixing generators and opening gates have been disabled. Alsoz the ability to crouch has been disabled.
---
Am I the only one who wishes for a killer that could hide in lockers?
---
I feel bad I wasn't recording this match. I wish I had, that way I could show my POV and the connected hit to give even more evidence that dedicated servers are needed. Doesn't matter how good your internet connection is at home, there will always be a desync or lag at one point or another.
---
I need some Myers x Pig fanfictions
---
I DONT CARE IF I WILL DIE, I WILL RESQUE MY PARTNER, EVEN IF IT WAS A RANK 21 DWIGHT... EVERYONE WILL BE SAVED
---
YELLOW SUNLIGHT... OOVVEERRRRDDRRIIVVEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I pallet stunned David yesterday.
---
It's also usually where the ban begins.
---
I mean yea BP, but it does not help for emblems. Sorry i didn't explain it well at all.
---
That’s some pretty big titties for frank gotta say
---
Cute. But Susie is not real.
---
Except NOED rewards killers for bad gameplay.
---
Well they added Leather face to the game who yes isn’t a real killer but roughly based off a real killer Ed Gein who killed two woman and and made masks if there faces and had clothes made of their skin and a bag and was also a butcher, so them adding Jack wouldn’t be far fetch he’d be perfect for the game and if they don’t well they need to get the balls to actually do so.
---
Darn!
---
*Bing Bong*
---
Oh haha not bad art on that sub
---
I will check it out
---
I don’t have spirit fury sadly, and what I mean is that everyone die instantly when the get put on hook that’s how I play
---
What do you mean?
---
Legion is fun but only if the survivors stay semi-close together so you can keep them all constantly bleeding out. If the whole team spreads out you’re kinda fucked tbh
---
I guess the meme was in poor taste when I was playing they were on a gen and they saw me coming up to a dropped pallet so on the other side was the gen they came up and t baged I thought it was funny didn't realise how rare of an occurrence it was
---
Thanks you! Any recommendations for perks I should run,  I’ve heard make ur choice was good
---
If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[Is it just me or is the matchmaking cancerous today?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cdhuqz/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_matchmaking_cancerous/))
---
I don't think Adrenaline is op at all, its a perk that is useless up until 5 gens are done, it heals a health state and gives 6s of movement speed.
---
NoEd is awful to go against as a solo survivor, gives haste and a one shot.
---
yaas 🙆
---
ye, Sounds like Camping to me.
---
Tip: you get more points and a higher rank if you hook the same Person multiple times
---
Still incredibly proud of the one time I got a Mori daily as Trapper with a Cypress.
---
And 1000 for dulls and 1500 for hexed next patch yay
---
It doesn't balance out at all though. Few killers have insta downs add-ons, and all of them require some amount of effort to obtain. Myers doesn't just give you a free down for literally nothing. Hatchets? That's an ultra rare add-on don't start whining about you see it every game. Doge them, it's not hard at yellow and green ranks. Plague? Dont cleanse lmao. I've seen an iridescent huntress once in 300 hours. Insta down perks again can be literally removed from the game, which is what happens at red ranks, so we can disregard that. What vague "insta down" killer are you even talking about?  Are you one of those people that believes the game should be tailored to yellow ranks? Because that's how we get unneeded nerfs.  Red ranks show off the game at optimal performance. We can see what's skill, and what's not, because there's no question about it at rank 1. You are complaining about something you will barely see, considering the top tier killer is nurse, but then could care less about MoM, adrenaline, ds, borrowed, insta heals, body blocking, survive without friends, which is everywhere is red ranks, which almost all of those are guaranteed to you and take no skill to obtain or use, and call it balanced. Are you really calling both sides balanced? Lmao. Are you only watching TrueTalent and Noob3?
---
Killer still gets the last laugh as you lose literally everything in order to save your teammate. You lose you BP, your item and 2 pips, which even if touched terrible you'd still only lose 1 pip and keep whatever BP you got.
---
As a killer main...OH NO
---
I have 15 hours and played mostly killer. The only thing people typed was "GG" once
---
Like I said, they can still have the option to play ranked. People get stomped all the time in other games, that's how you get better. If they don't want to they certainly wouldn't have to
---
this is gorgeous omg id die to get this. killers need more cute cosmetics
---
It would be pretty cool if they would randomly appear around on top of rooftops or wrecked vehicles, maybe doing random stuff like vandalizing buildings or just taunting the survivors. I’d like to see it actually do something for gameplay too, like maybe temporarily revealing anyone who gets too close to them since Legion has some issues finding spread out players right now
---
It's called the blatantly false anecdotal evidence perk
---
I would personally love to see chucky in the game although his hight is an extremely evident problem mabye other options like the kid from trick r treat hes not as tall so he could definitely fit in the game although his powers are unknown
---
*Sad Bing Bong*
---
Yeah it’s disappointing. Comes off more like they just wanted an excuse to put more cosmetics for you to buy. I wish they had another power similar to Mirage from Apex Legends where he would create decoys that would follow a straight path.
---
Dbd could have it where a decoy would follow a path you just took, or go around the other side of a loop. These decoys would take the image of the other members of Legion and every time you landed a hit, your character would change into another legion to keep up the mind games (this’ll encourage people to buy more cosmetics)
---
But idk how hard that’d be to make into the game
---
who cares about ranks in this game lmao, i already have all the perks i need for my survivor and killer so i will leave if you play like a bitch
---
I think you missed the entire point of the “Darkness Among Us” thing.
---
&gt;You totally can 1v1 a killer with the right perks or map offering.
---
You really don't understand what I'm saying eh. Whether you can take them on or not is still a product of the survivor adjusting their strategy from the stats not being in their favour. The killer is designed to be able to easily chase and kill survivors. The survivors are not built in the same way. Ignoring skill gaps and game knowledge - if you took somebody who has never played before as a survivor vs the same as a killer then the killer is literally built to win this 100% of the time. 
---
&gt;Maybe killers bitch more because survivors still have the upper hand in high ranks. 
---
Yeah probably. But they also bitch about survivors bitching, which I don't see as much. Unless you are referring to people whining about tunelling and facecamping, which isn't really the same.
---
Sure people complain on both sides, but it seems to be the top ranked 'pc killers' who have the most control and complain the most to the devs.
---
The rouble with survivor nerfs is that it is usually on perks. And it is usually a nerf to say "fuck it, we'll just remove it from the game", and they make it so bad that it is pointless using it. They bring in new concepts like mettle of man and decisive strike to open up survivors variety of playstyles and options, then they attempt add so many counterpoints to the perk to justify this.
---
Then the killers bitch so much anyway that they just go, "na fuck this its not worth it" and nerf it into oblivion. It makes it really hard to be excited for any usable survivor perks in the future.
---
Unlikely. What would the Demogorgon do?
---
Time to get looped by daylight!
---
Not justifying toxic survivors at all, I just see so much killer main circlejerking on this subreddit.
---
Baby ghostface. Lol.
---
Uh huh.
---
Disconnecting should never warrant a ban longer than a few hours a day. Especially since dedicated servers are not even live yet. If I get into a game and its lagging so bad I can't even play, im going to leave. Bhvr needs to re-evaluate their ban system. Yes, people get upset at video games and leave. That doesn't mean they deserve an entire week.
---
I don't think most killers want to be put into situations where they feel like they *have* to run NOED.  Being a perk down for the bulk of the game to potentially counter a perk sounds shitty.  Especially since there's no guarantee NOED will be up when you need it.
---
Errmahgerrdddd WhY hAvNt I ThOuGHt oF ThIs?!?
---
I'm rank 1 and sometimes I can consistently hit hex skill checks, sometimes I can't
---
Yes! This is the thing. like i see the bigger picture, i see isn’t a huge deal in the long run, but when you really break it down i’ve got a week long ban where i can’t interact with the game at all. the ban is final, there is no appeal system, and that’s all before even considering this might be incorrect. 
---
It just sits in a really weird place with me. this is a game i purchased and have put money into and for them to be able to just lock me out like that with barely any explanation after 3 years of playing sucks.
---
But it is a lazy cash grab tho?
---
Stack that with STBFL, oh boy
---
owo
---
Unless you've been playing since launch with several thousand hours. Then your pips and items can go fuck themselves lmao. Don't care. Only time I DC is bullshit slugs. It's the one thing I absolutely cannot stand in this game. I'm not sitting pretty for 5 minutes when you could hook me and I could be on to the next game.
---
Do you get any bp when u DC? also u lose a pip?
---
Ooh I see, thank you
---
I've had days where I get RNGeezus and get very few skill checks and manage to hit almost every one out of the few. Then the next game its skilcheck after skillcheck and I hit not a fucking one of em. I feel the pain lmao
---
Its not trolling, you're just being a dick. Killer main btw.
---
I played the hell out of P1 Freddy, probably put 100+ levels into him. And then I decided to P3 him anyway because he's my most played Killer. Half because I like the bloody clothes, half because *seeing* a P3 Freddy is super rare in the wild.
---
He hasn’t made a post on here in 300 days lol
---
Why have unique powers if you can just get a buffed killer that's easymode and gives you 4ks easily am I right? /s
---
Hahaha
---
Pallets aren't really viable for me now because I don't have the greatest internet and I will never, ever make it through a pallet or over a vault without taking a hit. I can also never throw pallets in time. Like I'll run through a pallet and I won't throw it unless I am completely on the other side and even then I'll freeze in place for a second then I'll throw it but only after I've taken a hit. I can't wait for dedicated servers I hope it'll make gameplay more consistent. I feel bad for my RB button. So many times I've smashed it trying to throw a pallet.
---
It can, actually. In Kate's bio it literally grabbed her by it's spider claws. And she couldnt hurt Entity whatsoever. I believe with each chapter Entity is getting stronger. First killers (tons of murder - dissappearing) recent killers (doesnt require murdering at all - can bring back to life). And the fact that Entity directly helps killers (Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, Corrupt Intervention, Thrilling Tremors, Endgame Collapse) all point towards it getting stronger than before.
---
I personally don't mind bm and never treat players differently if they tbag etc, but look at it this way: If someone calls you names and acts like a dick towards you, do you then want to stoop down to their level and be as childish as they are?
---
I’m not even gonna bother.  do you know what a “meme power” is?  Did you drink Nestle Purelife as a kid?
---
Aren't they survival instead of boldness now too?
---
Might be your setup. Your frames also impact the other players
---
(y) is a thumbs up emoji
---
I never understood this mentality, you'll get unhooked before u hit 50% anyways. right??? right?
---
These people are fucking idiots.
---
No, they don't know how anything works but have strong opinions about it just the same.
---
Don't worry patrick. Mom is busy, but daddy will pick you up ...
---
look at the timer in the clip, though.  it’s pretty much already worn out by the time she’s picked up
---
get a LAN Connection if possible, WiFi can be inconsistent
---
Yeah but... I was red rank so I'm biased torward my side geez.
---
Who is that to the left of the Spirit?
---
Rank 15: Tappa-tappa-tappa
---
Then why are you commenting if you didn't know, dumbass?
---
Tip for people struggling with Ruin: just power through it, you won't get better at hitting greats if you don't stick to it :P 
---
And for the love of Entity, don't gen tap. That's slower than powering through Ruin, i do advise to let go of the gen for like 2 seconds if you hit a good skill check instead of great since the gen won't get any progress during the sparkle-thingy BUT you can still get a skill check.
---
Especially since killers already feel like they have to run ruin. They'd be 2 perks down.
---
he took 10 hours to down people so we did gens like 4 of them but yeah thats pretty accurate (he used the ebony mori on the  last one)
---
how is the app showing up for you?
---
I know. Most of the playerbase is terrible at this game but this sub hates hearing that when it's about them so I made the title "Rank 20" as a hyperbole lol. Trust me, I wanted to say something about how I see Rank 1 Survivors do it all the time too but it's not worth the Urban Evasion and Hex: Ruin debates that would run wild in the comments.
---
Using WiFi your net will not really be stable try getting a ethernet cable  it will make it more consistent
---
On an iPhone it’s as simple as going to your App Store, changing your country of origin and using a post code from there. I changed my store to the Norway one. 
---
Entire game is in English. Only micro transactions are Norwegian currency based.
---
While some killers definitely do still need buffs, I do think they've went overboard in the survivor vs killer buffs/nerfs
---
It's still my belief during end game that if a killer closes the hatch, it should open back up in 30-60 seconds.
---
As it stands, if you're the last survivor and they find the hatch first, you're fucked. They can generally just patrol both doors until you end up dying, at least that change would make them patrol 3 things, or give you the chance to loop them long enough back to the hatch
---
You people are fucking idiots lol.
---
Well you said it yourself, the killer can just back away or go for a grab, so how is this an anti-camping perk?
---
Plus it punishes people who aren't camping and legit see someone running for the unhook and they pursue.
---
And that's really the root of the problem.  The game can't distinguish between actual face camping or not.  Nearly anything that could be implemented to stop face camping would also punish non-campers.
---
Hey you know that feeling when you think you're cleansing ruin but it actually haunted ground????????¿¿
---
No need to be this rude dude... It's only a game after all
---
Yeah man, I thought you were speaking about HB, not LF. Sorry, my mistake.
---
Yea hes gonna be on yellow ranks forever by playing like that
---
Definitely the dark theme tbh
---
What seems like an average every day person can do horrible things with a knife and a gang. Yeah this exists in every day life and isn't some unique concept.
---
Well I think every killer in the game is creepy or fearful, in some way. They literally are made to play on fears or horror films.
---
Like what would you do if you saw the hag, the wraith or leatherface hobbling towards you? Probably run or hide.
---
What would you do if you saw some teenager in a mask walk towards you. Probably easily take them on...
---
I hate to be that guy, but living at a certain place is a choice. I know I love gaming and having access to top providers is natural to me, so I choose to live in a big city in central europe. I wouldn't like to live in a place/country where I wouldn't have access to that. 
---
I know we're talking big decisions here, but if you make the choice to reside at a place with rural internet, you cannot complain about not being able to play a P2P game like DBD. Not sure how the dedicated servers will change that, but I'm sure in the case of a killer with rural internet, stuff won't get much better (probably teleporting survivors at your end, slower killer at survivor's end). We'll see. 
---
Just my opinion though, and I'm sorry that it probably sucks to read that.
---
Yeah it's abit....wrong I guess. System needs a rework.
---
That's how it works \^\_\^ So I suspect that the author of this post was just unhooked and Billy was trying to wait out DS just in case.
---
Yeah shit, I thought we were still speaking about HB.
---
Yeah, I remember going to them to post about possible ideas for some killer perk reworks that people considered OP. The comments I got back were a bunch of survivor mains saying "they don't need to be reworked, they need to he removed!"
---
Later I did the same for survivor perks killers consider OP and guess what! A bunch of killer mains said exactly the same thing "they don't need to be reworked, they need to be removed!"
---
It’s okay, well all learn eventually, I Laos have friends who gen rap cuz they believe it’s “faster cuz there’s no skill checks”
---
Fair enough
---
Yeah I hope that gets addressed some day.  As it stands, gens go way too fast unless you're up against a potato team.  Ruin is this weird place currently where it's too strong against low ranks and too useless against high ranks but still feels necessary because you're gambling on the totem not spawning right on top of the survivors dick.
---
&gt; Except if it was a survivor being toxic and getting owned you wouldnt be making excuses for them.
---
Well that's an assumption and a half, lol.
---
I like how urban evasion is a verb now
---
I see, thanks!
---
What I do a lot is,  hit the rescued person and chase the rescuer. 
---
It keeps 3 survivors busy and gives the rescued one a chance to get away (remember the entity feeds on hope).
---
Jesus who shat in your cereal?
---
Remember there's no shame in tapping.
---
Unless the ping is too high, then you really shouldn't be. Too inefficient.
---
You do realize noob3 calling himself is a joke right? Theres nothing “toxic” ab playing well
---
Ohh I see, thankyou!!
---
They do Q&amp;A during every livestream, they just traded out the specific Q&amp;A videos for developer updates.
---
I have problems getting any adept for survivors and killers because I NEED balanced landing and I NEED NOED
---
Yeah, it's really not as simple as that. 
---
My country just doesn't have as many options as Europe, or America. Our internet as a whole is worse than basically all of our neighbours. It annoys me more that people get so aggressive about it, especially when they don't know the situation and how complex it is. No one is going to uproot their life and move over five hours away so they can play a single video game better online. 
---
The cities will have more options and better internet, would it be up to standard as the people who complain about ping on here? Honestly, probably not really. Might get close to "playable" by some standards, but we just have notoriously bad internet.
---
Sorry to take it personally, but really, are people going to tell me to move countries next when we all have some issue or other on this game?
---
That's probably the best Meg cosplay I've seen so far, good job! Looks amazing!
---
Right?!
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
I just started playing the game. This perk is the bane of my existence. I don’t know how to play around it besides just hanging out with another survivor and doing the generator together.
---
I neeeeeeeeed it...
---
Oh, I'm not trying to steal your thunder XD
---
Just wanted to chip in. If I could find the comment I would
---
No no don't get me wrong you're not haha. Just you make a fair point
---
You must be a console gamer
---
My current build as survivor is Open-Handed, This Is Not Happening, Slippery Meat and Left Behind. It's the new meta, fight me
---
Learn those sharp turns. A lot of survivors will take you to mazes in an attempt to make you hit a wall.
---
Learn the turns and they wont be able to.
---
I still have no idea what you're talking about with copyright stuff??? Anyways if you wanna repost some artwork either reverse image search and find the source for proper credit or don't repost it.
---
You say that, but they have a big knife and there’s four of them... I doubt most if any people on this reddit could do anything about that
---
Did you crop out the bottom to remove “Made with Mematic” or some type of watermark
---
No he wasn’t. He was based on Ed Gein who only wore a mask made of skin. The whole “based on a true story” thing they said was a lie to sell more tickets.
---
I thought of an idea like that for a new killer but that would be perfect for the legion.
---
Must kill Dwight 25 times for leaderface. Jake 25 times for Survivor face. Claudette 25 times for Smart face and Meg 25 times for Athlete face. 
---
Mori does not count. 
---
Must be via sacrifice by hook.
---
He's either getting those protection hits or is using the endurance hit to save his teammate.
---
Easy counter find the killer asap. Follow them to the ruin as they always check it first.
---
Pay to win? How?
---
Yea I like to have everyone dead on hook before I start killing people, get more blood points and surfs are less likely to take risks when they are dead on hook
---
ah, that makes sense :D
---
thats like the opposite of Camping and probably tunneling.
---
then there’s horrorfield.  it’s so frustrating, once the killer sees you you cannot get away no matter what, and usually the killer’s a bot along with your teammates!
---
Right, but the idea is to prevent camping.   This just forces the killer to back up a few steps, but doesn't actually stop camping. 
---
I'm honestly not sure what they could do to completely stop face camps though.  Like I said, anything that punishes toxic players also punishes normal players.
---
I don’t get it, if they are getting camped ... who cares if he struggles or not?
---
oh
---
Man just learn how to skillcheck or gen-tap aint that hard
---
I know you probably are already aware of this strategy, but the new meta seems to be to run straight for one of the doors once the second to last survivor dies. Typically the killer will frantically try and close the hatch and then you usually have enough time to get the door open.
---
Sir yes sir!
---
They should definitely increase BP gains for survivors. Unless im burning an escape cake it’s hard for me to break 20k per match but when I play killer for my dailys I hit 25k+ with ease.
---
What does powerin through mean? (New player and lack of english)
---
Yup
---
I never use self care
---
Just hide in lockers. That’s what I do
---
A whopping 5 seconds to crawl close enough to where he has to pick you up
---
Here comes the trapper
---
I wonder when that gamebreaking nurse is gonna be removed. Oh wait that won't ever happen.
---
Forgot to also mention that it slows the game down **just a little bit**
---
Useful pig add-ons when
---
Leatherface was not a real killer. Texas Chainsaw Massacre was marketed as real but it's fictional.
---
Ahem aktually it’s Dragon Ball Super
---
I know, right? Like, can’t they understand I want to like, stare right into their eyes as I hang on the hook and struggling for my life
---
If I can’t bond with the killer that way, how am I supposed to have a friendly enough relationship with myers so I can see him shirtless?
---
Lol you need to stop using 'leatherface was a real killer' to attempt to justify Jack the Rippers inclusion. I am afraid you have been suckered in by the old movie magic lie 'based on a true story', its the classic only a fraction of the story is based on anything real. Leatherface is fictional and they spread the story of it being true to attract more people to the cinema.   
---
The devs have said they won't go near reality, it would just be a shitstorm for them if they included a real serial killer. Plague got a pass because the religion she follows is supposed to be ancient old and long dead and has no real ties to any active religion.
---
It because of situations like this that when ruin is cleansed in less than 2 minutes into the game I feel both happy yet sad for the killer.
---
I know it's a nice way to slow down the game but at the same time running into this perk so often is annoying.  Oh well good luck everyone! Survivors may your teammates power through the gens and actually complete the main objection.
---
Wow, that's crazy.
---
This would be an actual gameplay change, but it would be cool if and it would make The Legion better if some of them would stand around being a nuisance. Like, you're playing as Frank, and somewhere on the map Joey is standing in front of  a window, making it unusable while Susie sits on a generator and Julie camps in the basement and alerts the you when someone goes down there.
---
Fair enough lol! I will correct myself! 
---
* I’m a simple man. I see Dragon Ball Super, I upvote.
---
Didn’t they change it so Legion can’t see the progress, just if they have the state?
---
Ruin bothering you and you don't wanna look for it but just continue holding M1 down as per usual? Run luck offerings and no skill checks will appear.
---
I just want the 4k
---
Yeah i do this as huntress sometimes. Survivors arent usually above average intelligence though so most dont catch on
---
I don’t know, maybe? There’s still a bar underneath the survivors that looks like it should be able to move but it doesn’t
---
If you can’t hit skillchecks it’s better to gen tap rather than attempt them.
---
this pink add-on isn't even good
---
I voted "I don't care" because I appreciate the subtle changes with offerings. (and I hella miss the bouquets.) I like the comfort of deep fog, so that its harder for killers to find me, while I enjoy the thrill of loading in and praying its not a pig in the deep fog because I can't see anything. I like the comfort of being able to see the killer from forever away when there is no fog and the thrill of knowing the killer can see me from across the map too.
---
I’m just surprised no one had unbreakable or kobed
---
This seems really personal to you. I know what copyright is I just don't think it's applicable to what we're talking about? No one mentioned it. I know what he's saying and all I'm saying is say who the artist is lol. It's more then just an image, it's possibly hours of someone's work and they're getting nothing in return for it with stuff like this.
---
You mean the sentence at the end that was irrelevant to the discussion, but me stating that this type of attitude is the reason behind the internet going mad about copyright recently...
---
Yeah no shit it is about crediting the artist - because it is the artist's copyright. Just don't be a dick about like this guy.
---
Wow this isn't fucking art theft. look at the context. jesus what is wrong with with you lot.
---
I am pretty sure the whole issue stems from the original screenwriter deciding to sue for the rights of Jason Vorhees and the franchise. I think he decided he hadn't received enough money considering how big F13 franchise has become. This has subsequently stunted the game as its all tied up in this lawsuit going on that seems to have no solution any time soon.
---
Found the patch notes from the Legion rework. 
---
The Killer does not see the Deep Wound timer progress–only the Deep Wound bar to know that Deep Wound has been applied.
---
That sounds bruuuutalll
---
r/reverseverbose
---
Laughing my fucking ass off, so you're just gonna pretend that the survivor HAD to be toxic and deserved that? Nice bias.
---
To power through something = To persist (continue)
---
Other person is saying to keep working on gens and stop wasting time looking for the Ruin totem
---
I’ve rewatched Marth’s sub 4 minute Nurse game, here’s a couple times
---

(If I wasn’t a forehead the meg wouldn’t have wiggled off because there was a hook right behind where I picked her up)
---
Disclaimer: This isn’t me boasting and shit, I just thought it was pretty cool :)
---
Gee its not like tbe killer ever DC's because a survivor loops them for 2+ gens or thier hex totem gets destroyed and then decides to Rage Quit.
---
But I will admit in general a survivor is more likely to DC then a killer but my eariler point still stands.
---
Is it really that hard to find for some people? I usually tell my friend to stay on the generator and I find it in less then under a minute just by checking the right spots.
---
...wow, that’s really stupid actually.
---
The one thing I think NEEDS to be changed about this perk is the fact that if you hit the normal check area you should still get the 50 points even though it counts as a failure as far as gen progression goes. Those points don't change any game play so why do they get removed?
---
People have a tendency to generalize after one bad experience. 
---
Nobody comes to Reddit to talk about the games that are totally fair, fun, yet competitive between the two sides. There are over 110k of us in this sub. Don’t let a few “toxic” posts generalize a community. 
---
It isn’t that bad. You’ll have your few miserable games here and there like any other game.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
---
Please try to credit the artist in your title properly or say (source in comments) whenever you can. It’s always important to make sure that the artist gets the proper credit they deserve, and if you can’t find the artist, it’s better not to repost it at all.
---
The funny thing is that P3 Claudettes don't even load into the map, they crouch outside the walls surrounding the area and never do gens.
---
If the gates are powered they walk through them (this is the source of the bug that removes the escape trigger) and then turn around and escape.
---
Should’ve just been him saying “Here’s a little lesion in trickery.” Also, the title should’ve been something along the lines of: “When you are spirit and Kate tries to pallet loop you”.
---
Its free dumbie.
---
Just started playing and play 50/50 survivor killer, when playing killer I get loped and flashed a lot, but I just see that as part of the game. I don’t camp because I know how frustrating that is as a survivor. I’m a shit killer but I have only gotten positive feedback in the post game chat? Maybe it’s the people or that they know I’m a baby killer and or survivor.
---
Your first point is totally irrelevant though. It's entirely possible to find both survivors and killers that DC annoying. Not everything on this sub has to be an "Us vs Them" mentality.
---
The real toxic one is a killer using ebony mori's. He left because he was salty af and realized it's probably time to uninstall.
---
He’s been practicing his Chad speed-walk for years, of course we shouldn’t forget
---
I’m still a rank 20 when I play killer and only do it for the dailys and this is how I play it. A lot more chases and saves. They get BP, I get my BP, everyone is happy

miss ruin skill check -&gt; moonwalk into the gen for a second is my favorite combo
---
Calm down big man. I feel like bond suits better for me as a solo survivor. I run it when I’m playing SWF.
---
Hopefully shirtless myers is next.
---
"I cant see the picture"
---
I get so frustrated when I play SWF and they all decide that finding the totem is the ultimate end goal. If one or two people want to look for the totem, fine. But there should be at least two people on gens at all times - I’d prefer three people on gens, but still... I’m always the only one working on gens with an active Ruin so they never get completed.
---
Ruin makes doing gens together even worse since either player failing a check affects the other. Just say fuck it, do a gen solo and accept that it will take like 100 seconds
---
That's like saying the killer having to run Franklin's Demise because of toolboxes and flashlights isn't a good way to balance the game, and that killers should be able to knock items from survivors hands without perks.
---
Or that killers shouldn't have to run Lightborn in order to avoid getting blinded.
---
Or that killers shouldn't have to run Ruin to stop four Engineer toolboxes from popping four generators in 64 seconds.
---
Or that killers shouldn't have to run Third Seal to disable aura reading if the survivor uses a map.
---
Exactly. I honestly lose hope for the game when I'm on a gen with someone that gen taps lol especially in red ranks
---
Dulls are Boldness and Hexes are Objective iirc, though I'd love if either became survival to make maxing that stat easier.
---
Yeah. The first game scared the fuck out of me when I was like six. Especially the first time the lights shut off and of course the cultists that are powerful no matter what level you are. Every game afterwards the enemies are more of a joke and the game doesn't take itself seriously. Combo weapons make things too easy and too silly. Then again I replay the first game once a month so I might be pretty biased ^^
---
You can't tell people to not Try-hard when you are also preaching for them to follow particular rules for how to play. Example: don't start hooking until we get a couple of generators done, or don't go after a survivor who was just unhooked / other imaginary rules. This wouldn't be an issue as long as you meet me in the middle. so in this case I ask if you can not be near the hook when i'm about to hook a survivor. you must be at least 30 yards away to give me a head start on killing. Also, stop looping its not fair how much time it kills, oh and just like? stop running away, it makes it hard to get a kill after 2-3 gens are done. #KillersShouldStartMakingImaginaryRulesToo
---
Literally this just means that it’s too easy to reach red ranks as a survivor lmao
---
Standard rank one gameplay being described.
---
Well, moris are a way to play, and what about tombstones on myers? Are those toxic?
---
No matter what you do some survivors will always complain.
---
I recently started using a "gentle killer" playstyle where i let everyone go at the end. There's still people complaining at the end. Its impossible to never get negative comments from survivors.
---
My advice is to play the way you want to and ignore what survivors think.
---
He's crouching thats why.
---
I mean, having a fun, competitive match is much more satisfying to me (even if I don’t make it) than walking through a doorway.
---
How the hell ON CONSOLE AS WELL???
---
Yikes man.  Lol so you agree that the terror radius should be removed so everyone can play Nurses and Billy's with 0 terror radius?  If you sincerely think this is a good or balanced idea for the game you simply haven't played this game long enough to understand how bad this would be for the game.
---
I’m with you, sometimes I can hit all of them easily, other times I can’t hit one to save my life. 😂
---
Literally none of that shit is “toxic” its a video game hes really good at and you want him to play the way YOU want him to play just sounds like youre sensitive and cry for mommy when you get teabagged, normal humans dont get upset when getting teabagged or flashlight clicked and noob3 isnt toxic in chat and if he was its JUST BANTER. grow up kid
---
Well, I just run around the map with Small Game equipped.
---
Wait he got nerfed?
---
[Basically...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhwms1gbk-Q)
---
Huntress best ~~girl~~ mommy
---
FTFY
---
I would bring up the old BNP story again and how survivors didn't spam those either despite how "strong strategically they were" but the general killermain consensus is "i do what I want because I like crutches" and you do you buddy, BHVR should be the ones keeping these salty crutch-abusing killers in check but they're too busy reworking a killer because "he's not quite as strong as spirit" which is the most important thing in the game to create more top-tier killers so 50 hour Jimmy can also get his 4ks and then spend his money on dlcs.
---
Fair enough it’s just I liked chuck as a protagonist but frank can be cool, and if he was a survivor he could have the OG frank aswell as the OTR Frank
---
How the hell did you loop him for three minutes before a survivor got a gen done?
---
Its coming with the dedicated servers.
---
Yeah back when he first came out with mix tape and cold dirt he was ruthless, could stab people 3 times in frenzy and down survivors easy, making them mend so much that they couldn’t fight back, so he got nerfed quite a bit, but thats fine, he mainly needs a rework
---
So I guess you could say her arm is full of
---
Plot holes
---
Turn of the post game chat, you’ll have more fun that way. No matter what you do someone will always get mad
---
I’ve had people get mad at me for using devour hope as it’s “a crutch perk”
---
If someone actually pissed me off to that extent I'll hit them on the hook a few times although you REALLY have to go out of your way to push my buttons. Like beyond "playing the game normally" but people who teabag after every goddamn pallet stun or go in as a 4-man Sabo Squad all running Alex's Toolboxes with Sabo, No Mither, etc and they 99 or break the hooks and teabag in the corner of the map. 
---
Sometimes if I'm running a Mori for a daily or whatever I might mori them instead of whoever I was going to Mori first. Another kinda funny one is to 360 right before you hook them. Dunno if a 360hook counts as "Toxic" but if someone's being a shitter I give 'em the spin-cycle as I hook them. 
---
One Punch Freddy always mined alot of salt although the main reason I ran it was as a counter to Mettle Of Man users before it was (Honestly way too harshly) nerfed. 
---
Play freddy, run Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, Rancor, and a 4th perk of your choice (I preferred Monitor and Abuse). 
---
Running this type of build resulted in a rather hilarious and extremely lopsided (Yet somewhat viable) playstyle where you get hit cooldown buffs for hitting anyone but the obsession, get movement speed buffs for engaging in a chase with the obsession and letting them get away, and Rancor lets you instadown (and most importantly Mori) the obsession at the end. 
---
When MoM was in it's original state, almost every team would have a McLoopyPants running Mettle Of Man (Which was pretty much a free extra health state against M1 killers) + Dead Hard + Decisive Strike + either Adrenaline or Deliverance with an instaheal, making them a nightmare to catch. Mettle Of Man is an obsession perk meaning they're going to almost always be the Obsession. You'd counter all of their perks and insta-gib them with one attack at the very end of the match, after not even hitting them once the entire game. Hilarious, sort of viable, and the salt was unreal.
---
There is no option to stay in a party after game however you can ask in the results screen if they’d want to party up or look at recently played on steam. If your on Xbox or PS4 I know you can also look up a recently played with list
---
There is no context where posting someone else’s art without a source is harmless. Luckily OP was able to find a source but if you should always have the source posted in the comments or title when you make the post to begin with, otherwise you shouldn’t post it at all. What OP did wasn’t the worst thing in the world but they still should have had the source before posting it. Imagine if OP wasn’t able to find the source after the fact. Then we would have this post with no credit on it at all. The posting of someone else’s art without proper credit is always art theft, luckily OP was able to fix their mistake and find the source but it was still a mistake none the less.
---
NOED TWAT l2p
---
And all of this because of some randoms destroying dbd Dev on stream. 
---
But seriously, before that survivors could literally shit on killer's face and he couldn't do shit. It only showed that devs didn't know and play their game.
---
Now we have best state of the game
---
Happened to me yesterday. As usually, it was Ruin in 9 games out of 10 and for some reason I was able to consistently hit hex skill checks, so I was not bothered by existence of ruin at all, but today I returned to my original state where I hit 'good' one or fuck up a gen trying to hit hex check.
---
No? I was sticking up for OP because they showed genuine effort to not take credit.
---
Well apologies, it seemed you were saying you don't know what copyright is... I made it clear where it is applicable. I initial used it to say "redditors getting preachy about copyright". Copyright put simply is the right to copy something, that is what OP is being accused of because he hasn't been clear enough about credit apparently.
---
My second mention was just saying that it is exactly this type of attitude that is driving the new copyright laws that are to apply to memes and shit on facebook. - This doesn't have anything to do with what we are talking about - it is my opinion and I felt it worth saying as it is partially relevant. All you are doing is trying to detract the conversation to this... out of context.
---
Its just some guy saying a skin like this would be cool. If you want to find the artist it isn't that hard. OP made no attempt to take credit and was very honest about where it was found. There is nothing to be gained in return for something like this. And it still has a watermark on it anyway.
---
By all means provide tips. My point was don;t be the generic reddit smarmy guy looking to ridicule someone being honest for cheap karma and to make morally right.
---
I guess he wasn’t able to... *Prove Thyself...*
---
Oh that idk man there wasn’t any substantial counter play to his ability back then you know? I still think they have a decent ability to prevent healing and be able to locate other survivors rapidly
---
Legion should have some kind of area effect where survivors can see other legion, similar to doctor, maybe for survalience or just to throw off the survivors. This would keep to the "Legion" we are many theme and this is from someone who hates surviving against Legion, and has never played as them.
---
The hex is generally where the killer goes first so I just look for the killer and follow them for a while and search the general area around where the killer goes first.
---
this literally happened to me in a game today lmao
---
that's all i see tbh. 90% Freddies pc EU zone red ranks are p3. 
---
i honestly don't get the appeal of prestiging. i only did p3 Hag back in the days before cosmetic store because it was making her hard to see and p2 Bubba with Claudette mask for when i want to be toxic.
---
Bro I'm still not sure how this is cheating sfw was added by the devs knowing people would just use party chat on console or discord for pc. It's definently not cheating, though I will agree it is super unfair and unbalanced.
---
So I've noticed it's possible to get a double pip 32k as killer even when one survivor escaped the trial. Does this mean I'd get the adept killer trophy (merciless victory) even when one person escapes?

We'll Make It stacking with WLGF would make sense if it only applies to the survivor you unhooked.
---
BBQ&amp;C - for example - only shows the auras for 4 seconds; you're not going to be able to find and chase multiple survivors with one proc of BBQ&amp;C.
---
Also survivors have a way to counter BBQ&amp;C (hiding in a locker when someone is downed) and have to be outside of 40 meters.
---
The killer would need a way to counter the We'll Make It aspect of WLGF, and the aspect would have to be limited enough to only apply to the unhooked survivor.
---
Otherwise it would then be more powerful than BBQ\&amp;C; some people recommended that the unhooked survivor not leave scratchmarks or be immune to aura reading. I could see WLGF offering protection from debuffs to some extent (example: being able to remove mangled from the unhooked survivor) or reducing debuffs (example: Make Your Choice) duration by 50%
---
It would be interesting if WLGF let the survivor activate an exhaustion effect without an exhaustion perk (like basically an immediate Sprint Burst) when unhooked, but not for the rescuer. This could cause exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds based on the WLGF tier (though perhaps if the person on the hook already had Sprint Burst, it would add to the duration of Sprint Burst). I wouldn't imagine stacking it with Adrenaline would be healthy, though.
---
I agree he probably could use some sort of buff.
---
How about if you are stunned by a pallet during feral frenzy, instead of taking you out of feral frenzy, you would remain in feral frenzy and the power gets filled back up.
---
Definetly much stronger, but doesn't reach nurse/billy/spirit power level.
---
Bird: "ummm.... What's up with BHVR not fixing X bug am I right?... "
---
Audiance: *cough*
---
Or they're me and they somehow grow more potato the more they play nurse.
---
With the healing bug, it's better to leave medkits at home too. And no plundering for them either.
---
And Dead Hard?? That was amazing.
---
It's looking pretty likely, though.
---
*Laughs in +1250 quitter bonus bloodpoints*
---
 Context, I 4k’d him and his swf group
---
I main survivor but can killers see the aura of the it all the time?
---
This is why I run Thrill of the Hunt. I never have to go check my totem, because I'll know if you're on it.
---
I asked a dev on there stream and they said they just recently buffed him lmao

---
What you said doesn't need to be pointed out, lol.
---
Just having a laugh at it. "obvious thing is obvious, because you wouldn't do the opposite"
---
I think its balanced because with out hex ruin hag sucks
---
Okay, but the killer can also see what the survivors have before the match starts??? Survivors have no idea who the killer is or what add ons they're running so they cannot prepare in the same way- and there's nothing wrong with that. But to say that a survivor needs to take one perk or a set of perks just to have a **chance** to counter one specific add-on for one specific killer is asinine.
---
Furthermore, you can counter flashlights and toolboxes without any perks at all. Look up. Face a wall. Hit the survivors with the flashlights or on the gens. If you apply map pressure like a killer should, four gens wouldn't be popping in a minute. LOL. None of the things you listed are a problem for good killers.
---
They are never gonna do pennywise not only do I not think they could get the rights to it but lore wise it wouldn't work. Pennywise is almost an entity himself pretty much and we already have a clown
---
I don't disagree with the reasoning behind why you should always give credit. My point was mainly that this guy was being a smarmy asshole to try to feel morally superior -  You see this all the time on reddit btw.
---
OP wasn't claiming credit - He literally said where he got it from, had no bad intent, helped to find the source once asked. No wrongdoing. The pic still had the original credit on it anyway...
---
I think you need to redefine art theft for yourself. But the sharing of user created pictures on the internet saying "someone drew this, I don't know who, but this is cool" is not theft. If that never happened artists would never be able to drum up any interest. It is a shady line, admittedly.
---
If OP wasn't able to source it, but tried then it is on the person that originally sourced it, not so much on him. It should always be traceable, ideally.
---
Yeah that’s why he doesn’t need to be buffed, I believe they should rework legion a bit and change it up, in the top tiers nobody really runs legion, and i often see them get bullied, if they stab the same person stunned, if they miss stunned, even if they land the hit its easy to use the speed boost to get away and mend as legion gets stunned, you’re right legions perks are good but any killer can get any perk, we could run those on Nurse (who is very strong in the right hands) I think legions ability needs some editing, going back to the same toxic 3 stab build wont work, they need to make some changes
---
Just land great skill checks you noobs.
---
Good idea, untill everyone brings a medkit and the killer bring Franklin's.
---
GIVE THEM TO ME GIVE THEM TO ME PLS PLS PLS PLS
---
I'd say you should've photo-shopped a p3 claudette doing a gen in there but ... *There isn't anywhere you could find a source image*
---
Scratched mirror myers
---
That plus when they nerfed gen time from 60 to 70 to 80 you still get 1500 points but it takes longer. Those 2 things have always bugged me.
---
Okay buddy 4 man swf with instaheals deranking to rank 20 to bully noobkillers is also a way to play, nothing wrong with those people, but don't you dare insult them becuse that is "toxiccccccccc". Seriously when did you guys get brainwashed by FCC that sticks and stones are fun to throw but words are like daggers.
---

Dracula would fit pretty well as killer.

---
Plague is basically a mummy too tho
---
So, wait. Strong abilities are crutches, and people that use them are weak players? That's what I'm getting from your post, when filtering out the insults. Seriously, I'm not a player yet. I'm asking questions about the state of the community, and trying to correct any misconceptions I have. You're coming at me with the exact sort of 'flame people I disagree with' attitude that has me concerned about even getting into the game, while saying those on the sub are the worst and just complain all the time. WTF are you even trying to accomplish with this post?
---
1. Behaviour does more than make DBD. They could be working on a Stanger Things mobile game.

2. Leatherface was EXTREMELY LOOSELY based on Ed Gein. Gein was only confrimed to have killed 2 people, but made furniture out of bodies he exhumed.

When I first started playing I went straight for Ash because Evil Dead. My friends told me how the perk system works and you can teach character perks etc. I eventually found out about Self Care and really really wanted it. I thought it woukd be required. 
---
Nope. It's been unlocked and I really don't use it.
---
You sir are a legend

Except I never fucking said anything remotely close to that. Nice strawman.
---
It's not a 'few' posts about toxicity. Outside fanart, it seems to be the bulk of the upvoted content on this subreddit. I get that only mad people post stuff, that's why I'm asking questions, but brushing things off as 'only a few posts' is just ignoring the reality on this sub.
---
Take those faces by storm my boy free cosmetics for the W
---
&gt; Its annoying as hell, but its in the game so thats not what my rant is about. 
---
In my opinion, Moris shouldn't be in the game, just like red keys shouldn't either.
---
&gt; The point of this is, I wish there was an option to kick a survivor away from you if they try to save you at a bad time.
---
I mean, my advice would be to equip DS. Since he had BT its hard to truly blame him.
---
Do you even use reddit lmao? Everyone's first instinct is to scroll down and look at the controversial stuff, hence you are here.
---
When you enter the 'Struggle' mode on the hook, one of the Legion appears and taps their wrist in a "Times running out" gesture.
---
Isn't your 'gentle killer' playstyle literally playing to lose? Am I missing something about how the game works?
---
It's an inherent aspect of a community that's split in half. The primary goal of seemingly every person is to make the side they're on easier and the other side harder.
---
Basically, this sub is like if /r/politics and /r/the_donald had to play nice in the same sub. 2 groups who want basically opposite things all with the reasoning that it would make the US/dead by daylight a better country/game.
---
Yeah something like that, or even a dramatic change like they did to freddy that would somehow make legion an actual legion somehow. You are right about pallets though, in its current state legion is far too easy to bully
---
Shhhhhhhh, I saw the outline the first time through the gif and it just registered in my brain “that’s the doctor... riiiiiiiiight?”
---
&gt;Doctor at C tier
---
You're talking mad shit for someone in Spark range!
---
No way. The survivor to killer rate is 4:1. Why would this subreddit for some reason differ?
---
LOL at B tier reply
---
Yes kinda. Part of the objective is to not rank up, so that i can keep playing against survivors i can "toy" with.
---
Playing to win is fun but after 1000 hours it can be fun to mix it up ;)
---
He’s after Texas Red
---
None of them for GF are
---
Sure, if you give Claudette something to distinguish her from the ground.
---
The aura of the totem? Yes, they see any active totem all game. It glows red, just like the gens.
---
I would just not get ya hopes up I really want a summer event but better to think it's not happening . It could literally just be a summer set skin thing .
---
To be fair the maximum the devs would do if they ever decide to look into this would be adding a lullaby like that.
---
You went a longgggg way to be wrong man
---
in his defense, Myers is fucking huge compared to the survivors.
---
yes
---
no proof so i doubt it.

You're allowed to play however you want, but I would suggest you also play some survivor to get a feel of the other side.

A lot of people just play this game to have fun so when you decide to not allow a player to be unhooked or if he is unhooked and you ignore every other player to down him again, just know that you're making that dudes game miserable.
---
Whether you care about that or not is up to you. Camping and tunneling have their moments when they're the best play to make, but generally you want to be putting as much pressure on generators as you can.
---
I've talked about this before where a lot of the issues with people complaining about tunneling and camping come from two different mind sets. 
---
Player A plays the game somewhat competitively so camping, tunneling, and slugging or whatever else are totally fair and its stupid to complain about it. Player B plays the game to have fun so if you're camping or tunneling then you're a sweaty try hard who ruins the game. 
---
These two players will never agree and it would be nice if we could split them up between a casual and competitive game mode so that everyone can enjoy the game how they want to and maybe there would even be less toxicity in post game chats and stuff.
---
Are you talking about missy missy pink hair?
---
I mean though, killer hooks me, and not even 1 second later im unhooked. the killer barely moved from the hook. I had no way to get away, there were zero pallets on that side of the map. but DS wouldnt have mattered. He never picked me up afterwards. Mori'd me. DS only activates if he picks me up about a minute after being unhooked. But if im never picked up, there isnt a way for that to work. But yeah I agree about the moris. I don't think they should be in the game, find another way to get that animation in the game. but my rant was about being sandbagged with no counter against a tunneling killer.
---
I've gotten exactly one medkit in my last four bloodwebs.
---
&gt; *hit skill check*
---
&gt; Oh, have another!
---
&gt; *misses*
---
&gt; And another!
---
&gt; *misses again*
---
&gt; Annnd another.. and another.. and another!
---
If it wasn’t for getting a million skill checks in a row, it wouldn’t be so bad.
---
I feel like Legion could be more justifiably buffed if their innate kit wasn't so annoying, specifically.
---
1: Killer Instinct is incredibly difficult to hide against. Legion was essentially made for reliable detection, and this only gets worse with perks like Discordance (reveals generators being worked on by multiple survivors), Surveillance (reveals generators that have their regression interrupted by a survivor) and Monitor and Abuse/Distressing (pushes Legion's Terror Radius when combined with their addons to truly absurd amounts).
---
He doesn't have to run these four perks exactly (usually he won't run Discordance and Surveillance both, but seeing Monitor and Abuse or Distressing is reasonably common), but it's incredibly annoying.
---
2: His power is essentially M1 simulator, combined with increasing his terror radius (and Legion can reach you even if running M&amp;A and Distressing before Feral Frenzy ends) he can essentially dart back over to you if you've mended, and generally cover 5\~ generators at once, hopping between survivors and slowing the game down (Sloppy Butcher makes this worse).
---
3: Survivors who don't heal are easy to catch on generators and down, just like playing against Plague while broken.
---
Even in Legion's current state he can essentially wear down the survivor team and make games take forever, breaking out of his power (the temporary blindness not being a huge issue if you track through sounds of injured survivors or their scratchmarks) while the other three are having to mend, heal, and then rescue someone. It's not really fun to play against, it removes a lot of play styles (most notably anything stealthy and a lot of relevant perks getting neutered) and there's not much you can do other than run and M1.
---
He's not like Doctor where you can manage your own madness and successfully hide inside the TR. Legion is going to come gunning for you and get a free hit, continue chasing until they're right on your back, cancel their power (after your injured boost is over) and down you (or they're going to run off and hit the other survivors and down one of them).
---
Removing the Killer Instinct part of Legion's kit and how easily he closes distance without much downside (beyond a temporarily blind that doesn't impair a good killer's tracking ability and isn't going to benefit you beyond one more looping spot, if that) so that he has to find survivors more conventionally would leave room in his kit for other things.
---
I forgot what Rancor was and tanked a hit while being obsession... fml.
---
Freddy has a lot of flaws as a killer (notably how hard it was to see in the dream world, and how people could do objectives right in front of him and he couldn't react for 7 seconds), and a lot of strengths (great stealth through invisibility and non-directional terror radius, unlimited tracking potential, slows the game down significantly).
---
But the main reason people say he sucks is because for most people, he's not fun at all. He's badly designed. Survivors hate playing against him, killers hate playing him.
---
It's frustrating to have someone unhook, open an exit gate, finish a generator, or cleanse your hex totem directly in front of you and know that there's nothing you can do about it. It sucks as a survivor to know that no matter what you do when you're asleep, you can't avoid Freddy's unlimited aura reading. It's annoying and dumb to have all of your actions slowed down by 50% and to have to try to fail a skill check (People complain enough as it is about how boring it is to spend 80 seconds playing 'generator simulator', and having to do it for twice as long is even worse).
---
Freddy's power has no 'hook' to it that makes you feel like you're doing something. The Hag and Trapper can set traps and have them go off to get the survivors, The Shape and Ghost Face can stalk survivors for buffs, The Huntress can nail them with distant hatchets. All Freddy's power does is give aura reading and reduce survivors' action speeds: Passive abilities only, nothing that really makes you feel like "I am doing something with my power".
---
I am and I'm dumb. I didn't recognize her as part of Legion. xD
---
It's because Deep Wound stops going down while you're in the killer's Terror Radius: It's not supposed to be used to help killers track survivors, so they had to make it so you can't see its progress.
---
All I can say is without fail every time I have a skeleton key and I try to use it, my team ends up being total trash and the hatch spawns closer to the killer than me. Every time.
---
I mean it's fair; the game should have never shown the skillcheck because the DS timer ran out *before* the skillcheck appeared.
---
The bug isn't that you didn't DS, because you wouldn't have been able to. The bug is that it displayed the skillcheck at all.
---
I assume it reactivated when you got unhooked? If it didn't then that'd also be a bug.
---
im very proud ms. oinks is the mother of my killer main
---
I hate to go against it =&gt; i don't use it
---
Plus if i'm not good enough to do the job without noed, i won't get better by using it.
---
I have hah too!
---
Why should I care? Playing killer is already stressful and not even that fun at times just as is.
---
Personally it's just exhausting to power through ruin when you play 20+ games in a session. 
---
Plus if you are able to power through ruin you are probably also better at finding the totem then your 3 idiot teammates. 
---
Because of that it's always in your favor to just go find it.
---
I'm new, I dont have it.
---
baby Claudette casually walks in grass
---
I think legion is perfectly fine. They are a jack of all trades type of killer.
---
Oh god I just came
---
Left Behind needs to be reworked so badly. 
---
The worst part is the [early WIP version](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Last_Standing) was way better than the final version! Action speed increase for every survivor dead/escaped is MUCH more useful than a speed increase when you've the very last guy and hatch spawns which the killer can close.
---
I have no idea
---
Honestly Legion does not really need a buff to their Power or themselves.
---
What truly needs to be changed though are the add-ons. Almost all of them are completely useless. I love playing Legion but there is no situation i have ever considered using like the Stab Wounds Study, any of the blades or any of the pins except the Legion Pin could have been useful. The Legion Pin also only if i see multiple Medkits and suspect them to have insta-heals, still not entirely worth it.
---
Honestly I didn’t until I read about it on this sub yesterday.
---
I love watching monto if i want to try an interesting killer perk build, and even if you don't win the perk combinations make killer a lot more fun than getting bullied all day/
---
this is a false statement and i feel personally attacked
---
Claudette get out of the fucking way
---
Well if survivors end up hating the game as its dull and they view it as unbalanced they won't play which means you won't. Just because killer can be stressful at times doesn't mean you should take it out on survivors and make their game experience miserable, that's pretty selfish. I get it if their being toxic to you but if it's just that your not very good so you are getting stressed trying to manage the game that isn't their fault.
---
Imagine not running self care in solo queue when survivors are literal apes 98% of the time.
---
Agreed. I feel for the dude because he was probably under payed considering how big the franchise got and the movie company raked in the money but I am not sure if he has now just gone spiteful and is refusing everyone the right to do anything. I just want the F13 game to get more love lol it has so much potential.
---
Agreed to an extent, but there's no real meaningful civil discussion. There should be. It's basically turned into a meme sub. Any and all questions about the gameplay, discussion about perks or game-related suggestions, usually turn into downvote city. It's why I stopped frequenting this sub as often.
---
It is when a survivor only sees you when you’re so close to them that you can get a hit with the uncloak speed boost. Positioning, such as sneaking at the edge of the map or behind line of sight blockers, is the key to ensuring survivors do not see you before you are ready to uncloak and get that hit.
---
F
---
If cross-save were available, then it would probably help the switch version. They could probably even afford to improve it with people doubling up on buying it. I already play on ps4 and pc, so no way am I starting over my progress and re-buying all my cosmetics.
---
As Feng main, i'm casually ordering my Open-Handed, This Is Not Happening, Left Behind and Slippery Meat, then going back to ma boiz Billy, Spirit and Nurse, ready to be mori'd.
---
I've never understood the divide between 'competitive' and 'fun.' Winning is fun for most people, and if it's not fun for a person, then why is their fun so much more important than another's that they get to declare 'playing to win' as 'unfun?'  
---
I'm not a very competitive player in most games. I'm not that good at action games in general. I try my best and have a good time doing it. When there is a casual / competitive divide, I usually play casual. That doesn't mean I don't try to play smart though, or that intentionally playing to lose makes much sense to me. I've learned enough to know that camping isn't usually the best idea, but patrolling the gens near your hook seems like a good play? Spending extra time and resources to get a kill doesn't seem worthwhile, but if it's going to cost you the same to get someone you've already hooked versus someone untouched, isn't the better play going after the one closer to dead?
---
I guess I just don't understand what, from the survivor perspective, a killer 'playing for fun' would do. It seems like the people calling killers 'toxic' would rather they just not be in the game? I'm certain this is a misconception based on insufficient information, and that information mostly comes from this subreddit plus a couple videos. That's why I'm asking questions before I jump in. I don't want to make anyone else miserable or spend any more time than I do dealing with jerks messaging me profanity and death threats.
---
Ok...?
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I don't think the system works
---
Yeah it can be strong I think the issue is it’s only useful on groups that are grouped up, if I stab someone on corn field and nobody is nearby they can speed boost into corn while I go blind and mend pretty easily then it’s back to tracking them down, legions current ability can be countered by simply not staying with each other and intentionally making it harder to find anybody and making killers instinct useless, it’s either over powered wall hacks, or useless stun simulator there seems to be no in between, the ability to vault pallets is cool, but Id think legion could still be viable if they simply remove killers instinct, and its weak stab and give it something completely different that changes its kit as a whole for the better
---
And shirtless Amanda as well😏
---
there was a ban wave a while ago, we cant help you in any way, send a support ticket.
---
I am no sir, but thanks :P
---
When we gonna have the Freddy rework in the official server?
---
Spine Chill squad represent
---
You should have looked for a key in chests and I don’t think there are offerings that cause skillchecks
---
Maybe The Legion is actually just one person with dissociative identity disorder.
---
“You’re giving information that maybe not everyone literally has, but they should already know it, because *I* already know it”
---
Sounds to ke lime you deserve it  as barely is more than enough to be toxic
---
but I barely ever BM or get mad in the after game chat.
---
Pretty sure that was a joke
---
I'm a rank 6 thatbwas dropped to 12 at rank reset. I'm pretty we were both rank 11 at the time. Not exactly low ranked, but not high.
---
I don't see how them bring quick and efficient is a sign that they can't tell? And why should they care which system a report is from anyway?
---
Regardless it doesn't really add up with how it was known that BHVR used to not do console bans, they'd have to have the means of knowing where a report is coming from.
---
That’s what the game wants us to believe. I bet Julie’s flat as a door and franks got d cups.
---
Tofu does survivor guides.
---
Shadow people have been popping up more.  You guys have any thoughts?  Possible hints towards Slenderman?
---
You’re forgetting about the passive where *”The Lit Totem will spawn right next to at least **3/2/1** survivor(s) at the vey start of the match”*
---
I have to agree. I don't typically patrol hooked people (especially early on), I look immediately for the next chase, and I think that's probably the biggest factor. If you've played enough you know how it feels to be on hook and have the killer just close enough to down you in 3 seconds once you're unhooked, and many of them will do just that. It feels like shit, and is why BBQ is such a great perk for both sides. Hook a person, find someone far-ish away and give them chase. Let survivors unhook other survivor, you get points for more hooks, they get points, and they don't have to worry about being instantly downed and getting the lovely 3,000 bloodpoint game. 
---
Applying pressure to the map after a hook is a much more rewarding gameplay experience for everyone involved. And while proxy camping or patrolling hooks might not be an inherently bad thing, it really sucks to play and know that there is no way for you to unhook someone without being instantly downed and hooked yourself. 
---
I have never gotten salt in a post game match outside the one or two times where it probably was deserved, and it's mostly because I keep the mindset of "would I be upset if I was playing against myself" and it makes me a much more enjoyable killer.
---
Digging through old posts huh?
---
I do
---
How about this one: hitting skill checks is such a generalized reaction task that it would be foolish to call it a skill specific to Dead by Daylight, and if you're &lt;15 years old and aren't hitting Greats consistently then practicing isn't worth the effort.
---
Source: my sense of timing just isn't that great, no amount of practice at this one specific task is going to improve it
---
Two ppl were on the ground at the beginning and I’m sure everyone was looking for ruin and not on gens. This was solo queue 🙄
---
The problem with thisi s that this isnt like, a simulation made by numbers and stats, so they need to make the Animation's Good because thats where the Hitbox are supposed to be :b
---
I was under the impression that DS is activated once the killer initiates the pick up animation, which it seems like the killer did like a fraction of a second before the timer ran out.. so I just assumed the game got confused. 
---
I was still baffled that it gave me the opportunity to use it and then crush my dreams. 
---
And no, it did not reactivate.
---
As much as I despise nurse.. That would actually be pretty sick.
---
Perk wise I love Sloppy Butcher and Thanatophobia on him.  The way his kit works that combo is amazing on him.  Punishes them hard for either playstyle healing or staying injured against me.  For my last two perks I recommend Ruin and either Pop Goes the Weasel or Discordance.
---
Addon wise it doesn't matter much.  I'm a firm believer in playing as many games as you can with lesser addons so you don't become dependent on using OP addons every game.  They're more a treat for me than anything.  A lot of his addons are underwhelming anyways but probably prefer the increased Frenzy duration with increased detection range.
---
Against SWF if anything they'll more likely to play close together which makes chaining frenzy hits very effective.
---
Ability wise this is how I play him.  Find survivor get very close to them prior to popping Frenzy.  Pop it hit them, rotate camera immediately, if someone else is nearby run them down, apply frenzy hit, rotate camera immediately and repeat.  If noone else is nearby at that point stay on current survivor, cancel ability, finish chase and down.  Just be extremely patient and disciplined with your hits.  Don't swing until you know it will connect so they can't take you out of ability.  If they juke crazily take a step backwards aim and let them juke into your swing.  
---
He can really slow the game down if you play him right.
---
You have like Trapper and Myers ripping through the door, blood oozing from weapons, terrifying visages, and customers running in fear. Then, they both step to the side, and Dwight's just standing there with this huge grin on his face, staring down all his coworkers frozen in panic.
---
that’s incredible. i can’t even play nurse on PC, let alone against SWF
---
2 there is  main ways to deal with ruin:
---
A) If you think ruin is your absolute priority each game, run small game tier 1 and go totem hunting if you know ruin is in game, its one perk to counter your biggest headache.
---
B) Decide "fuck the totem" either because its obvious the killer is closely patrolling his totem or because the killer you are facing is too good to waste time. NOw the most efficient way is to get good at skillchecks and maybe run perks or get a toolbox that lets you deal with gens faster (which means also less skillchecks) OR you can use the tech I use when I am potatoing too much, or I am too lazy to care, hold repair for 5/10 seconds, let go, rinse and repeat until done, it does not take as much time as gen tapping and you wont have to worry about too many skillchecks per gen (I usually get only 2-3 per gen if at all)
---
I don't think so, I think devs are happy with new Legion, even if majority of community thinks Legion should be buffed and his add-ons should be reworked.
---
jesus you're not very bright
---
0/10 not Teabagging at the exit gate
---
I get why your name is DeadByBS
---
You’re done with their bullshit
---
I think you’re thinking of detective’s hunch
---
Stakeout gives you tokens for being in the terror radius and not in a chase, and each token makes good skill checks count as greats
---
Think about it like this. If you're playing a game like Mario Party then it doesn't really matter who wins, the fun is in playing the game itself. If you're playing a game like CSGO or League of Legends then its more competitive and winning is more important for the fun you find it in. 
---
Some people treat this game like Mario Party where others treat it like League. Neither player is wrong or right, its just the mindset they have when they launch the game. However I will say its never ok to be shitty to someone just because they played to win while you were playing to have fun.
---
You don't have to let people win though, I would say some of the most fun survivor games I've had have been games where we all died. When I started playing this game I was more competitive, but after so many hours of playing, escaping or not doesn't even factor into how much I enjoyed the game. 
---
However you should know there are also people who will be toxic no matter what. We'll call them player C for.. i'm sure you can guess. Player C is just a crappy person who it doesn't matter how the game went. If they lose then the other side did something scummy and if they win then the other side sucks at the game lol ez. Player C isn't going to change because that's unfortunately who they are and the best thing to do is ignore them.
---
Also I want to add that its not just survivors who play this game for fun. The opposite can also happen where a killer goes into a game not caring how many kills they get and just want to enjoy it, but then they get put up against a 4 man SWF with insta heals letting each other know exactly which pallets have been used and such.
---
Like I said though, neither player is wrong for playing the way they play. Its just why otherwise non toxic people will complain about things like tunneling, insta heals, SWF, slugging, or whatever else. Its also why I really think they need a more casual game mode that's more about the experience of the game vs winning or losing.
---
Because 90% of posts on here are literally killers complaining about survivors.
---
Monto is pretty fun and Tru3Ta1ent does try and explain things although he isn't everyones cup of tea. 
---
Do you play killer? If not that is a great way to learn because you understand what the killer wants to do, how other people avoid you and it gives you a better understanding of the game.
---
Or you can run adrenaline, do gens and not be a pussy about being injured.
---
There’s no such thing as an offering that makes more skill checks happen.
---
I got here because the post was new, not because I sought out controversial comments.
---
Achievement rat reporting in.
---
Even after getting the achievement it feels so good to breaka  lit totem and imagining the killer saying "Fuck me".
---
The best kind of kill is overkill
---
Sure it’s free to download but everything else costs actual money. Hell, base game characters are locked. You can’t play as Wraith or Jake and even the stuff that was free with chapters on PC costs premium currency in the mobile version.
---
I wouldn’t say tofu is a great survivor though. He shines as a killer but as survivor meh. 
---
I’d say watch no0b3 and just observe how he positions himself, camera angles and all the little tricks he does.
---
Yeah absolutely I provided perk loadout which includes Thanatophobia in my detailed response to your other questions on another comment.  Check it all out and I hope it helps man.  Just got a 32K game with him against a swf on a Coldwind Map offering so he can beat coordinated groups if you play him strategically.
---
Taptaptaptaptaptaptap
---
They banned a bunch of people for dcing.
---
With 1,200 hours in game, I still can't hit skill checks worth a damn, just have bad reflexes in general in everyday life. So yeah, I'll just go and find that totem. I am pretty good at knowing exactly where they spawn in all maps though, so it usually only takes me about 2 minutes.
---
I've found the effects as 1. Forces me to look around the map and cleanse the hex. 2. Me to do 4 gens. 3. Me to cheese the killer hoping the other 2-3 survivors will do a gen in that 4 minutes until they leave me on the hook at use the key on the hatch cause they've been sitting on it since it spawned.
---
They are dull totems. I guess there to be used as bait totems or if you have a perk survivors doing dull totems can give you some boosts or abilities (as in stats). 
---
They dont do much unless you have a perk specifically pertaining to them, and I guess they confuse baby survivors too.
---
Its understandable to feel that way when he came out all he could do was tunnel and now he can spam bleed, thats why I suggested a rework but who knows how it could be done without being annoying. Are there particular killers you enjoy going against or dont mind?
---
That's not how lagswitching works. Looks like a major desync probably caused by an internet spike on either side or something like that.
---
I dont understand why people start working on the totem as soon as they see it in the first minute of a match. If I find a totem in the first 60 seconds, I will hide nearby it for a bit, then start it when the coast is clear.
---
they told us they'll do it "in the next patch" 2 years ago but it wasn't working so they didn't do it. they will do it once they have the dedicated servers running
---
Exactly. Plus the perks I just kind of came up with on the spot don't seem overpowered but they could work their way into a certain meta or be a nice gimmick
---
True that would tremendously change the play style and make the addons worth going after cause atm they dont really do anything
---
He sounds like Ghostface except instead of possessing awesome stealth capabilities, he straight up immediately wins since survivors can’t hide. In other words, it makes no fucking sense and wouldn’t be that fun.
---
Should have put Doctor in, as the black sheep of the family.
---
Pain Reliever. He's rank 1 on both survivor and killer and he is very good at explaining his thought process. He does prefer a stealthy playstyle but hes great at looping and explaining the concepts from both point of view, which ultimately helps either side. Knowing where killers like to backtrack to mindgame you is useful
---
We got 2 gens done because we were dumbasses and got the outliers first while everyone was alive since we didn't know how bad it was going to be.
---
He spent the rest of the time wandering around breaking gens.
---
High rank survivors don't heal you because they assume you have Adrenaline, like everyone else. 
---
Also, it takes 16 seconds to heal someone else, not 32. It takes 32 seconds to heal with Self-care.
---
Running other items will always be more effective than medkits because there will be games where you just don't get found by the killer. But you will always have to work on gens. 
---
Self-care is actually not an efficient use of time. It should never take you more than 16 seconds to run into a teammate unless you are crouching everywhere. It is better to get healed quickly and get back on a gen rather than waste half a minute doing nothing while you heal.
---
As for comparing medkits to toolboxes in terms of efficiency, toolboxes have superior addons that medkits can't even compete with. Aside from instaheals, toolbox addons are just stronger. Self-care is there just to compensate for that.
---
Running a perk for healing yourself won't always pan out. If the killer injures you, you better be good at looping, because they usually don't leave you alone until they've hooked you. Iron Will helps you immediately. You don't have to waste time to get effectiveness from it.
---
Comparing Prove Thyself and Streetwise with Self-care is pointless. No one runs Prove Thyself to get toolbox efficiency. They run it to do gens faster with another person. Streetwise increases efficiency of every item and of the items nearby teammates run. Of the 3 perks, Streetwise is the strongest one provided you run literally any item, excluding green keys with no addons.
---
Also, no one uses all of the alternatives to Self-care in one build. The way you've laid it out gives us 2 options:
---
Bond, Prove Thyself, Streetwise, Iron Will
---
or Self-care with 3 perks of our choice.
---
This is how you've laid it out to us, but that's not realistic. People run EITHER Bond or Iron Will. And they almost never run Prove Thyself or Streetwise. 
---
Bond does way more than Self-care as well. It gives you pretty advanced information on your teammates. 
---
Who's hiding? 
---
Who's doing gens and therefore who should I not lead the killer to?
---
Who's using Self-care so I can go heal them and save some time?
---
Is someone running? They might be looping. Did they drop a pallet? Well this place has one less pallet, better not loop here.
---
Self-care has 2 uses. Increase medkit charges, or heal slowly. That won't always matter. The killer has to decide to leave you alone to give you a chance to heal, and that rarely happens unless you know how to loop them and make them give up on you.
---
Zubat has some YT vids where he plays surv. 
---
Example: [https://youtu.be/YYYGSSt-Pm4](https://youtu.be/YYYGSSt-Pm4)
---
Noob3 arguably the best looper in all of DbD if you understand basics of looping watch him and try to pick up some tricks and tips.
---
oooh   is there a link to the story or something I can't find anything
---
Tier 2/3 have a larger, wider range, making the location of the totem harder to nail down precisely (even if it makes running around looking for a zone with a totem faster), I like using tier 1 more because its easier to nail down the zone its activating for and because I already know the general locations where they spawn.
---
I second PainReliever. Very good at explaining his mindset and thought process. Also a rank 1 survivor and killer

A good tip is if you decide to work on a gen with Ruin active, whenever you hit a skillcheck, stop working on the hen until it stops sparking so that you don’t regress the gen further with a possible repeated skillcheck. It can’t progress anyway so you may as well wait.
---
Ghostface is kinda trippy to play against tbh, his ability is weird with knocking him out.

Honestly its one of the most toxic games I have ever played. I took a break and went back to it only to find I would still get messages probably 1 in every 5 games. However I have had some great interactions with people and had some laughs. If you have a friend to play with SWF can be real fun, and that doesn't mean playing toxically lol. 
---
As for terms like I said everyone has a different opinion but the way I laid it out is kinda the basic view of the terms. 
---
Best way I can explain it is if you have ever played an FPS and been spawn killed numerous times and felt how frustrating that is, well DBD has a few ways to cause that emotinal reaction. Camping and tunneling will make a survivor feel that way, a toxic SWF or a toolbox heavy gen rush can make a killer feel like that. Its a game with 1 vs 4, the 1 can kill and the 4 can only run. If the 1 wins a survivor can feel it wasn't fair as they couldn't fight back and their was nothing the could do. If the 4 win it can be a bully show on the 1 and mob mentality can make them be cocky over their win. Like I said before its easy to sway the balance in your favor be it using a good item or add-on, running a certain meta build or playing in certain ways. 
---
Also in DBD 1 mistake can cost the game for the whole side. If a survivor runs the killer to were the rest of the team are doing a gen, a killer focuses too long on a survivor who is looping them silly. Basically its a game that can cause frustrations especially if you take it very seriously. Personally I have always wanted a game that I could play as Freddy Krueger or even run from him, I have this so I enjoy it. 
---
One last thing that causes issues is the wait time on games. It is very erratic and when its really bad it can be anything between 10-20 mins for a game. I think this adds to frustration because you wait so long only to be camped or face a toxic SWF. If the game wait times were less than a minute so you could play more games and have more chance at less satisfying matches I think toxicity would be reduced a bit.
---
One is a deformed hillbilly with a chainsaw and the other is fat cannibal with a chainsaw that wears human faces. For MBV he's a miner with a pickaxe and a mask. Trapper has the mask but us more casual and no pickaxe. Despite this, the mask is close enough to the original where I feel like the similaries would be too great. It's like having 2 hockey masks in the game.
---
It's sad how many people in this community can't tell the difference between "playing the game effectively" and "griefing/being toxic."
---
DS doesn’t work against moris and borrowed time isn’t an excuse to make bad unhooks. even if you use borrowed you still only want to use it as a last resort.
---
It’ll have a candle under it giving it slight illumination. It also lets out a little sound, I think, like a fire burning
---
You can definitely still get kills. How I play killer is I'll always have a perk or two dedicated to help find other people after I get a hook like BBQ, Discordance, Surveillance, or something like that. That way i'm always moving and never just sitting at the hook waiting for someone to come to me. If those perks aren't showing me anything then I'll start patrolling the gens.
---
If someone gets pulled off a hook near me then I'll go back to the hook, but I make it a point to go for the unhooker instead of the person who was just unhooked. I almost never bring in mori's or some of stronger addons like prayer beads or 1 hit hatchets. 
---
Do I get less kill overall this way? Probably, but I still feel like I get my fair share of 4K's and I enjoy making the game more fun vs trying to steam roll every survivor who comes into my games.
---
I'll also occasionally do silly things like the other day there was 1 survivor left and I had closed the hatch. I went over to the door and found them opening it and I absolutely was going to kill them.. Until they dropped their item. I appreciated their tribute so I let them finish opening the door and leave lol.
---
You don't have to play this way, its not the most efficient way to play the game to net you the max amount of kills. Sometimes I get ran over by a group of survivors, but that's ok. Whether you play killer more competitively or more casually like me is up to you and whichever you decide is totally fine.
---
it would be nice if this sub would stop Always digging the grave of over used jokes
---
Nice duck
---
I've seen like 3 people cry about bans today that's how I found out.
---
oh ok thanks
---
Sure, but you'll get kicked lel
---
why
---
That, combined with the fact that she hit the gen indicated she wanted you guys to finish up and leave, probably felt bad because of the DC.
---
Tunnelling is way more effective but it’s just a bit unsportsmanlike
---
Been playing a new run of new Vegas on PS now. Such good memories relived. And my GF loves it more than she loved 4 (knew she would)
---
Tier 2/3 have a larger, wider range, making the location of the totem harder to nail down precisely (even if it makes running around looking for a zone with a totem faster), I like using tier 1 more because its easier to nail down the zone of the totme its activating for and because I already know the general locations where they spawn.
---
He is soooo sad!
---
I am still not going anywhere near him tho..
---
Damn, Doctor is so fun to play, the survivors get crazy! (Literally lol)
---
Yeah. I agree about his ability. Wasn't even his ability that got me though. He had Franklin's, so I lost him, and went back for my item. Then he came back because he was confused. Ig thats where I messed up, but I didn't realize the guy had a prejudice against Claudette.
---
Hmmm, ok thanks. I thought it was a bigger problem
---
I like to go all out at the beginning of the match, and if it feels like gens aren't getting done super fast then i start going easy.  Hooking all the survivors at least once lets you get hook points and lets the survivors do unhooks, and if you're up against a more experienced group you can still play normally without getting stomped on.
---
It said survivor therefore is this post is directed survivors whether you mean it or not. If you wanted to appear neutral you could have said something along the lines  "I only DC if the game doesnt go my way" boom now it can be taken mean both survivors and killers.
---
But i guess if you wanna try and deflect your true meaning by pretending to be neutral and not face any critical thinking or criticism I guess that makes you a hypocritical coward.
---
P.S fuck both survivors and killers who DC.  Take your loss like a champ and move on.
---
The Legion's true title... is the Cosplayer

Does Myers still slow down when ure holding m2 and not stalking anyone
---
If they truly knew it was a console report, then they would know it’s a false report, as there is no chat or voice function inside the game on console.  So that only leaves the two options I mentioned. More than likely it’s a program being run on theirs servers that receives all the reports and decides what to do. Considering that the communication abuse report is an automatic ban, it’s very likely that they aren’t going through each report checking to make sure which platform it’s for. That’s just too time consuming for a company. It’s more than likely automated.
---
Everyone plays games differently. Some people like to play for fun and some people like to play to win. I don’t understand how that doesn’t process in your brain. Its also just hilariously hypocritical cause its not like he’s the only streamer out there who cares about pipping and performing well.
---
But sure, you go out of your way to watch someone you clearly don’t like just to see if you can form a new opinion and definitely not to reaffirm your preexisting one. Totally.
---
Nurse’s calling is one of the strongest killer perk of the game. It was in the shrine 3-4 weeks ago too
---
Hex ruin is either gone in a minute or kills all survivors
---
It’s why I’ve never and will never bring Self Care. It’s a huge time sink and feels so selfish when you know your team is suffering while you’re healing for 5 minutes in the corner.
---
I made the comment whilst being a killer main. Face camping is neither funny or fun for anyone

I have a daily to Mori with wraith(I've had it for a while) and I hadn't played wraith ever. I decided to give it a shot and level wraith till I got a Mori. I believe I got almost to level 20 before I got my first green Mori. No yellows up to this point. since I was doing so good before I decided to take it in the next game. But then I got a map I've never played before I kept getting easily looped and losing survivors. I ended up killing no one that game and I haven't played wraith since
---
Ah na, she was trolling - I have 3 minutes of her being rather toxic - but I was confused about the recovery so was new to me :)
---
Ill get into games with red ranks who dc if they get downed before we can finish a gene with ruin active. Its ridiculous.... so people not understand that its pretty easy to power through
---
Uh huh. That's why you just scrolled down 300 comments by chance, huh?
---
1.3k hours in the game and I can now do gens with ruin, please clap!
---
You know the nurse is not that hard to loop right? Once she blinks just run another direction...unless she’s 5 blink nurse. Then we all ded.
---
like zoinks, laurie
---
*Fucking toxics*
---
Got any statistics to back that up? Sounds a lot like maybe you have your own definition of "complaining".
---
I wish it showed you your progress towards each of these....feels like I've been grinding for Dwight/Jake FOREVER.
---
Yea, I’ve tried dead hard, but I much prefer balanced landing bc it serves as an escape perk and a “run and hide” perk and the rest of my loadout is way too useful to get rid of. Maybe I’ll try it instead of adrenaline.
---

I saw noob3 once a really while ago had the same problem in stream, but I thought it was patched since
---
I’ve found success with Billy.  If you can practice with his chainsaw sprint and identify line of sight between gens with less stuff to bump into you can patrol gens easily/quickly.  This strategy falls apart if you end up at an “indoors” map.
---
Deal.
---
It’s been mentioned here in the sub a couple of time by players who have gotten an instant ban.
---
I don't see the issue.  
---
5 seconds into a game my ruin is found, every time.
---
The best luck I ever had in a match is working on a gen (with Ruin) and only got one skill check (which I fucked up) but still, one skill check is pretty neat
---
When does the Shrine of Secrets recycle/reload?  I know Tuesdays, but is it at midnight or mid day?

what's up with leatherface? I never get to go against him as a survivor it's mainly the hag i go against, the wraith, Myers, the hillbilly, the trapper and ghostface, is hillbilly better?

Hahaha the game hahaha its unfair hahaha towards survivors hahahaha omg. Nice one

Happy late cake day
---
It would be cool if the other killers in the legion would appear on top of buildings or loops just watching one of their gang chasing after the survivors.
---
Everyone complains about the grind in this game but honestly it's what keeps me playing. I've played for 2 years now and only have one character at P3 with every perk, 3 characters at P2 and about 1/3 of the rest at P1. If it was easy to unlock everything I'd get bored pretty quickly. Plus it means I can't always use meta perks because I won't always unlock them by level 50, so I get more variety in the perks that I use.
---
To be fair, that killer was AWFUL
---
Did... did you just post this same exact clip three times?
---
You just have to realize that repairing a gen takes 80 secs, and on average Ruin only adds maybe 20 seconds to that. It just takes a bit longer, that's all. Take a _quick look_ around the immediate area, and if you see a lit totem, cleanse it; otherwise, just carry on doing the gen as normal.
---
I was thinking of Tsutomu Miyazaki
---
Unnerving presense, Overwhelming presence makes objects deplete faster
---
yes hillbilly is the better chain saw guy, bubba's chainsaw is slow and you need to be like right next to the survivors to get a chainsaw hit, although with add ons that increase his chainsaw movement speed and reduces charge time he becomes a lot better.
---
This one is too tier! What are you talking about? The beard is glorious.
---
nope I didn't even no the guys but the cops told me to be on the lookout for them
---
Leather face is seen as a weaker hillbilly by a lot of killer players. Leather face doesn't have the dash range like the hillbilly and hillbilly is better overall through the game.
---
Reply "ggez"
---
I don't mean die on hook the regular way I meant suicide on hook as in: attempt escape 3 times and then not pressing spacebar. Ofcourse you should be able to die.
---
In short: they'll ban people for dcing now but suiciding on first hook is allowed so the only thing these "scary DC-banwave, we care bout the community" is nothing more than a 5 second delay for the dcer to leave the game anyways.
---
***N U T***
---
Shrine resets Tuesday’s Daily reset. For my time zone that’s 7:00 pm. So the server technically thinks it’s Wednesday for wherever it is.
---
Huh, I play on PS4 and tons of killers use Nurse's. I use it and have it on every killer I play and have Nurse as level 1 since its been in the shrine a ton of times.
---
No stakeout works great too. It makes any skillcheck fine vs ruin.
---
do you think he'll get buffed or reworked to where people will choose him?
---
its kate and jeff
---
there was no need to kick a dead horse
---
Are you aware that you can just sit on the generator and wait for a skill check. If you get a "good" skill check, get off the generator and wait for the progression cooldown to go away, then hop back on the generator. You can do generators like 10% slower than regularly this way and you don't waste half the match running around the map looking for hex ruin
---
is it just me or the skill check itself isn't 60 fps? the line seems to do micro-jumps on it's way around, on 60 ms
---
Where is Madam Thicc and Ash
---
And survivors don't complain... at all... right. You're still yet to explain the supposed 90% killer demographic.
---
Hhhh hooo hhhhhh oooo hhHHHHHHHHAAAA *SMACK*
---
excuse my ignorance but what does p3 claudette mean
---
NOED is fine, its the one perk that keeps Adrenaline is any sort of check
---
See, I'm not really a goal-oriented gamer. If I'm playing a game, I want to have fun. I want to use what is fun to me. Using crappy perks isn't fun to me. If someone wanted to use crappy perks, they still can if you have everything available to you. Problem is that this game is kinda unplayable if you get unlucky with your opponents using good perks and items, and you don't have the equivalent.
---
You can make the choice to put yourself at a disadvantage if you have everything available. In a game as poorly balanced as this one, though, you need top tier shit to compete against non braindead people
---
The rewards are bloody clothes. I agree that it sucks but is not like prestiging is hard anyway. 
---
What they really need to give attention is Devotion, which takes longer to get and it promotes people playing the game for longer hours, increasing the population (theoretically).
---
Appreciated!
---
Take my fucking upvote
---
i play him alot and lemme tell you, hes really weak. all the killer detection perks work against him and his power takes forever to recharge. Just pay attention and he wont be able to get you
---
Mods didn’t like the other one my dude
---
Who the hell said survivors don't complain, I'm saying killers complain way more than survivors on this subreddit.
---
Also the hell are you expecting me to show you? A scientific study someone has found out about the dead by daylight subreddit? No one has done a study to show ANY sort of statistics so im not sure why you keep asking that. Its literally something you see yourself.
---
I love the little speed boost that Spine Chill gives on gens when the killer is chasing a teammate nearby and happens to look in your direction. Kinda risky, but fun.
---
I know you get bloody clothes for getting prestige 1, 2, and 3, but there is no reward for prestige 3 level 50. Why isn't there?
---
Farming points is best with whichever killer you can use their ability with the easiest. With bbq and Chili you can basically two hook everyone and just do side stuff and get kills if you wanna. Usually people list Doctor Legion and Hag as the farming beasts because their power can be used without much surivior interaction. I’d say Legion because you can just use your power and drain it out as it comes up. After you two hook people just stab them over and over for bonus Malicious points and you’re good. You don’t really need stuff like Distressing, despite popular idea because it only lets you reach the 8k cap faster and doesn’t let you exceed it. Even if you don’t intentionally farm, using other perks like Brutal Strength, And STBFL can help you do the stuff you normally do just faster so you waste less time with cooldowns.
---
Fair enough it just seems like he's built wrong rather than op.
---
It’s a Pig perk
---
It's a the pig perk
---
Okay cool. Thanks
---
Of course lol
---
Not dang it
---
Claudette lives matter. Except for when it's 4 of them in a SWF
---
Applying more gen pressure with Discordance, Pop Goes The Weasel, Thrilling Tremors And even Corrupt Intervention can allow you a net time to be able to keep people off gens long enough to snowball. 
---
I think Ruin is awkward because unless you use something else to help when it gets broken, you’re basically ass out and hope to pressure with just hook potential.
---
How do you use tier 1 if I unlocked tier 2/3 already? Thought it just lets you use the highest tier.
---
Now, I cannot speak for all games but I can speak for League of Legends. League of Legends has a rank and non-ranked modes. I completely stayed in the non-ranked mode for majority of my playtime. The non-ranked mode still had a hidden MMR, so essentially you were pitted against other players with similar MMR. So basically you were still ranked without showing the player they were ranked. Your MMR for rank didn't carry over or affect your MMR for non-rank either. They were two separate MMR's that fluctuated based on winning/losing and your team/enemy teams average MMR.
---
My point is, if the implemented a system like LoL then you will eventually be playing against harder and harder opponents due to your hidden MMR increasing after every match you win. So all you end up doing is splitting up the community for the sake of hiding the number in the top right of their screen.

Doctor next pls

Add me if you want a killer to test stuff, or a surv to test things with a killer. Don't mind KYF. 
---
Looking for a good SWF group as well. 
---
EST available most evenings and weekends. Discord, Mic, etc. 400+ hours in game. 
---
Message me on here or steam to let me know you added me, I get a lot of spam invites sometimes
---
Thanks in advance!!!
---
You are a lovely killer then. I had a few yesterday where one of the survs DC within minutes. On a few of them at least 1 more DC'd as well. Played out the game each time. No mercy. Even on the one the killer let me get the door 3/4 open before slicing me down. That was sad.
---
Lmao relax dude, he’s a coward for not making his meme survivor/killer neutral?😂😂
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YEqJA4kF8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YEqJA4kF8A) This is probably the best video by him for survivor play
---
Where is all these nerf posts?
---
I mean wraith isnt scary in the slightest. Maybe with his hallowed blight cosmetic or the one with the scarf like thing.
---
Game is unfair for survivors? That guy is smoked.
---
What if you saw that coming towards you you'd just be chill?
---
The thing is, if a survivor is pissed and wants to quit, he will just kill himself on the hook. Granted he will lose an item, but often I suspect that's not the main consideration (but how do I know I guess). The biggest loss is the loss of the teammate himself without any ability to try and save him.
---
stop reposting this shit.
---
A strategy I use is gen tapping, I repair a gen until a skill check comes up, then get off the gen right after hitting the skill check, it might just be placebo but the delay between skill checks seems shorter when I do this.
---
Nurse skin seems the creepiest like she was blown up in WWI/WWII and was resurrected by the entity
---
Oh you edited the comment, I thought you were talking about my other post but the guy had his GT exposed so it got removed by mods.
---
thanks for being a kind killer &lt;3
---
I'd be unnerved. But normal wraith is just stupid. Leatherface or hag are different. For one chainsaws are one of my worst fears and two hag looks more dangerous and not just stupid but maybe dangerous cause of his weapon.
---
These animations still look like shit and have as much weight as Skyrim’s mining animation
---
He was looking at him.
---
There actually is a penalty. Enough DC's can result in a ban (I've seen a few reddit threads from people who did get banned for a week or so) but the threshold is EXTREMELY high. I had internet issues and almost every match resulted in all four survivor's DCing (Not ragequitting but they got connection-dropped) because my ISP was a potato for a couple days, nothing came of it although I was getting on average 3+ DC's a match.
---
Does Devotion actually affect anything?
---
I justify it by just not caring about the grind. Just play the game for fun. If you're just focused on getting the best perks on your bloodweb, that's going to end up taking a lot of your time
---
I'll add you now mate. Were are you from?
---
I think it is bugged and it only works when ghostface is stalking, instead of every time he is using his power. So he can stop stalking and reset the reveal timer. That's just a theory.
---
When you get experienced at the game you will do this most games
---
Experienced players do this regular
---
But then you end with shit perks and add ons which in turn makes the game less fun
---
So accurate it hurts
---
Link to the original picture please
---
Loooool !
---
You also ran past the hatch if you could of gone back for it. Three times you have posted same video different title. Like I say for third time this is just average for experienced players must be your first time awww bless
---
Nice dude!
---
Are you trying to say lockers are intended to be used to hide in one spot for so long that crows think you are afk? You are an actual dumbass toxic survivor that held someone hostage because you didn't like losing.
---
Invert Y Axis is checked when you don't want it to be.
---
I'm actually part of the 1% that plays with Y Axis inverted! I feel relevant!
---
If it only happened once then it was a bug. Simply put the game forgot to give the wraith his TR and res stain back
---
I mean I try to win and I get survivors in my profile send me dick pictures, 90% of games that I win there's always at least 2 survivors that spam my steam profile and then don't get any kind of punishments.
---
I just think most survivors are babysit to win. that's all
---
I'm on ps4, so I haven't played against him yet. But he looks fun to play against to me
---
Robmiller2002, England :))
---
&gt;Thats why its a crutch.
---
And that's where you lost me on the argument. I'm sick of people blaming their loses on perks in the game. BOTH killers and survivors. Just plain sick of it. It's a perk, it's a part of the game, it's fine to use. Start adapting and improving your gameplay.
---
Yeah people for some reason think reposting is stealing and downvote to hell even when you literally never claimed it, it’s cancer

Happened to me a month ago, sad part is I thought I distroyed all the totems.
---
Tbh intentionnal DC is a big problem. The worst example i have in memory is yesterday as soon as i had slugged all 4, all of them DCed. I'm glad BHVR is starting to handout bans to people who abuse DCs.
---
anyone able to give me a few pointers on what i should pick up early if i dont mind spending a little money?  
---
I figure getting Cannibal and beelining BBQ is a no brainer so i can put it on any killer to get bloodpoints - and getting Hag for Ruin? But i know nothing about survivors whatsoever
---
No i'm letting everyone escape every games, its perfectly fine.
---
Only thing which you need to avoid would be "teaming up" with a survivor to get the others killed, and then let that one escape.

You either don’t reveal him or u reveal him when he’s fully behind a wall. It’s good game logic
---
Maybe it's a glitch with the cypress mori?
---
Lmao this useless response.
---
Jeff would be in Yeah Sure and Ash would be in the "Bold of you" category.
---
You obviously haven't met the Xbox surv pussies who don't like losing

Wait what LMAO I thought it was the persons name so I didn’t take it out lol

Wait, we can fix gennies is ruin is active?!?!?!

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cdli66/no_internet_bug_clip_fun/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
One game I ran no mother resilience and this is not happening I powered through hex ruin as if it wasn’t there
---
Legion is already not fun.
---
This is hilarious. What they get for T baging
---
No perks, no add ons, against SWF, and on console? Goddamn, that’s actually very impressive. As a survivor main, I dread the day I run into a good nurse because I know I’ll get wrecked, haha.
---
I enjoy peppering in some Wraith to my killer rotation too but the claim of him being versatile is suspect.  He's probably one of the least versatile killers in the game.  His power is used to find a survivor and them afterwards you just got to M1 them down with little assistance from your ability unless you're running strong addons.
---
**HEADLINE:** ***"****Survivor claims DC is now acceptible"*
---
When did they remove grabbing survivors who were going into the escape hatch? Just had someone escape today because I thought I could grab them
---
Lmao all the time. I even had one guy (gamertag was something like “He’sGodly” which made it even more annoying for some reason) who would literally quit every single time I downed him. 
---
This was back when  Myers first came out on the xbox so I was playing a whole lot and ran into this guy multiple times per night. I started saving up Moris and myers insta-kill add-on’s just for him. Dude flipped out after the second time and said how he was reporting me. I said it was only because he quits every time his reply was literally “because you don’t deserve to hook me noob”.
---
*you’re
---
Fucking YES! 👏
---
Nah you're good, you do you.
---
I love it definitely gonna need this for the upcoming salt I'm gonna get.
---
*you're 😂
---
But yes, this is true haha. Since the other option is watch them run away and then they t-bag thinking they fooled you lol.
---
Thanks pal, but I dont think I can pull off something like this ever again
---
Yea, this should've been the title.
---
I’m very inexperienced in the game so the people I go up against aren’t that great I just think he’s versatile in my own opinion/experience(which isn’t very much experience lol)
---
To “prevent” holding the game hostage.
---
Unlock it in their bloodwebs. Buying the teachable allows it to show up in other webs, that’s all.
---
Agreed. I feel for him, but he only wrote the first one which barely had Jason, and didn’t have him as an adult killer or anything so....I dunno. Just make a deal and move on, folks. 
---
And yeah, I wanted to love the game but something just feels missing. It’s ALMOST there but not quite.
---
No you have to let them escape!
---
Yeah,  it's honestly not worth the time staying. As much as it sucks when someone does DC on the first down, o wish they'd also take a closer look into why people are dcing in the first place. I leave maybe once every two weeks of games, but I can see why some others do it more frequently.
---
Monto, HybridPanda, Noob3 come to mind but there are a lot of good streamers out there streaming DBD
---
Yikes lol.  Hypocrisy and toxicity go hand and hand with these players.  Their logic is baffling.  I mean sure I stabbed the dude to death but that doesn't make me a murderer.
---
Why would you run Bond if you’re on comms and can tell each other where you are?
---
A few of these are really good!
---
Depends. You don't waste as much time but its RNG dependent. I've had it where I got a skillcheck within a second of hopping back on the generator - 3 times in a row. that certainly doesnt feel more efficient, even if it is.
---
LOL
---
I honestly can't wait for those Kate cosmetics
---
Nah being killer is already as hard as it is in red ranks
---
I see nothing wrong with that.
---
Ah okay, even if that killer is level 50 already?
---
Ahhhhhh gotcha.  Yeah as a new player Wraith destroys survivors at low rank.  But he becomes increasingly harder to win consistently with when you get near the top.  Still playable mind you don't let anyone convince you that it requires a specific killer to win at any rank you just need to work harder to do it.  Glad to hear you're enjoying him man.  Wraith on playa, Wraith on.
---
you're getting downvoted because gen tapping is an a terrible habit to develop and to promote. its slower than just powering through ruin, and it wont do anything to help you learn how to land great skill checks (probably one of the easiest and most helpful Survivor skills is landing greats, Hex: Ruin or not). 
---
I know of two situations off the top of my head where gen tapping is viable. 
---
1. the killer is nearby, possibly chasing someone else. When you know the killer is in audio range, gen tapping can deny them information that anyone is actively working on the generator. they wont hear the repair sounds survivors make. 
---
2. you are on the last few % of a gen, Ruin is still up, and failing a skill check could cost you all of the pressure you've applied. Tapping can help close out a key generator, or clutch an Adrenaline boost for your teammates. 
---
other than that, just practice great skill checks. the ingame experience is worth it, even if you miss.
---
Yep. Level 50 doesn’t cap you. It just regenerates a new bloodweb whenever you finish the previous one.
---
I actually played against a Trapper that did NOTHING but stand near his Ruin. Would not chase people unless they were close etc. We turned it into a mini game of trying to break the totem without stepping in traps. Fuck doing gens it was way too funny. And when we finally got his totem broken he instantly DCed
---
I get caught in there all the time as Killer *and* survivor. 
---
I hate it! Why is it there!? Maybe they should turn those "decommissioned" buildings into actual buildings you can enter (Although it might turn into another loop zone) because that porch is nothing but a way for you to either die, get stuck in as Killer, or get bodyblocked and held hostage.
---
I hook the farmed to teach them a lesson not to pull off that shit anymore

---
I haven't run self care in a while because it's so annoying being on a hook and all three of my teammates are self caring and I die on my first hook, made me realize how annoying self care is to other survivors
---
Yes the unhooker is dumb, but the poor survivor who just got farmed isn’t. I aways make a point of downing the unhooked survivor to deny the unhooker of the safe unhook and then chase them down whilst leaving the other slugged.
---
Possible, but Meg is missing too, and she wasnt just released back then, but might be one of the first survivors they even designed (her internal name is camper female 01)
---
😂😂😂
---
That just sounds like a basic build for any killer
---
For anyone playing on higher than 80 ping, powering through it is really difficult. The skill check arrow thing that lets you know when to time it can have frame drops and cause you to miss.
---
Ahh ughhh *cough cough* uhhghh
---
I don't think dragging this game farther away from the horror genre than it already is, is the way to go.
---
You can't unless you prestige your character to lvl 1 again.
---
If your character is prestige 3 already there is nothing to do, you will have to use a fresh one and avoid upgrading the perk once you have it.
---
Nah. I thoroughly disagree. They have nothing in common Beyond liking art.
---
David and Kate work because Kate is a kind-hearted songbird with tattoos who is a Survivor at heart and can lead the killer on one hell of a Chase, while David is a tough guy with a heart of gold. Definitely someone who seeks chases or excitement and also has tattoos. They are just different enough but just similar that they could make a cute couple personality-wise. The age Gap is also less noticeable between the two since they are both early 20s.
---
The thing is, if what he’s doing works, then he is working toward the objective. Even if it isn’t conventional, when he chases the killer he’s usually trying to take aggro off of other survivors. He just plays in a way that YOU don’t agree with. Tilting is a strategy.
---
I have no clue how someone could think that tru3 is more toxic tho lol. Neither of them are toxic at all.
---
Ah, back when we had pink tier perks and Sprint burst activated every 20 seconds
---
BBQ is especially useful for him because he knows in which generator he needs to teleport
---
They should just make it so there is no option of whether or not to struggle during second hook phase.
---
Does it sound exactly like Frank or were you expecting a high pitched moan?
---
&gt; Source: my sense of timing just isn't that great, no amount of practice at this one specific task is going to improve it
---
Not with that attitude ;) 
---
I hadn't played any other game with such a mechanic before and i can greats just fine now. And i'm certainly over 15.
---
bro
---
I vote we facecamp this person until he dies, all in favour?
---
‘excuses to camp’ when i just hooked someone and they unhook right in my face. i do hit the unhooker but i’m going to go for the unhooked. why would i just let someone who has been through a stage of entity go and heal and do gens when i can get them out the game?
---
HECK YEAH
---
It sounds exactly like Frank it’s a bad glitch
---
What’s tapping?
---
ew, legion, where's spirit
---
He was doc with Bbq chili, and ruin he was not new just had a brain fart but good try killer main;)
---
The Meg only apologizes later on cus she immediately ran off after failing the check
---
Well I don't see it myself, so your argument is useless.
---
No one would get points then and the game would last forever, since alone the would do very minimal damage.
---
Nice, thanks
---
I’ll be sad if cloaked Kate doesn’t win.
---
From my experience as a rank 1 survivor main i'd say just power through the gens and don't bother looking for the hex totem. 
---
However if you're getting chased by the killer or when rotating from gen to gen, keep an eye out for it and usually you'll just run into it.
---
Having someone look for ruin early game usually costs 1-2 gens of missed time
---
Frame drops i understand, ping though, you can learn to hit it "in advance". I always play with 120+ ping.
---
I hope one day they’ll rescind the “only human” killer ruler. I want Xenomorph so bad.
---
The number of games you’ve played doesn’t correlate to rank, nor does it relate to skill. The ranking system is like a loosely tied sub set of gameplay guidelines that in a sense, can provide a neutral or positive game experience for everyone involved. 
---
However, it was created by man, thus is not perfect. Also you can put tons of hours into this game and still be absolute ass and inversely you can pick this game up and be very quick on the uptake and get amazing games in little to no time.
---
Outplayed baby survivor
---
Extremely EXTREMELY doubtful.
---
this happened to me last night. guy i had downed n left was hiding literally right next to the hatch n thought i was going to kill the only other survivor first. yea he was mad.
---
Yeah it's just Frank's voice
---
i guarantee you they will make more cute cosmetics in the future whether it makes the game less scary or not
---
Tunneling is when you go for a survivor despite the fact that there are more advantageous situations. It's not "Tunneling" because you *are* going for the most advantageous play: The injured survivor. If you choose the healthy survivor and down them even though there's an injured one that's easier to get to, then that's tunneling. Think of it like an obsession with a specific survivor that you bully exclusively despite there being better alternative plays.
---
Then you're willfully blind.
---
Legion is interesting, and his lore is interesting. why do they have to limit what kind of lores they give killers because they want their game lore to remain intact?
---
Also, if you really need it : "when you play legion, you play as four of them, feral frenzy sends you in a speed, letting you find and hit multiple people, as if there were multiple people chasing surivorvs at the same time" or something
---
Yeah i always tunnel people with OoO, and lots of others do too, you cant blame us as usually OoO users are toxic SwF assholes who are too confident
---
Around mid august
---
Stop, you'll make me blush!
---
OMG LMAO that had happened to a Meg in my game she got down n got hooked bald xD
---
[The new Nightmare will be released on all platforms on July 23rd, 2019. We look forward to reading your thought on the changes.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/74473/the-new-nightmare-content)
---
Ruin, BBQ, discordance, save the best for last
---
The worst kind of survivor
---
How are you surprised by this? You’re using a perk that directly counters every stealth killer and is just an annoying perk to go against in general. You will absolutely get killed for using it
---
I've been playing for over a year and still don't know how to flashlight save smh
---
I really don't see any issue with OoO and i play killer a lot. Its a perfectly fine perfect imo.
---
Angry Legion mains lol
---
A true gentleman needs to be brave enough to go into a fight he know he'll lose. But one day... I'll be strong enough to win...
---
This is amazing.
---
I just told you why, learn to read u camper.
---
My steam page has been filled with 3 pages of -rep comments since i have been playing killer for like a month
---
I wish i had enough confidence in my ability to run resilience. Once i get injured its imperative for me to get healed asap given i dont trust my looping ability enough to stay that way, making resiliance a bit pointless tbh.
---
*tbagging at exit gates and flashlight clicking intensifies*
---
sUrViVoRs CrY tOo MuCh 
---
jUsT tRyInG tO wIn
---
Lol. I just saw a killer one with bbq and ruin as if they are super op so I picked 2 survivor ones that are powerful but not exactly op.
---
Do you reckon cross-save will be implemented? They have to do something to bring this back because at the minute it seems like absolutely no one has faith in this port. It’s not even part of the future releases in the eshop, which is kind of odd for Nintendo
---
yea... claudettes would help someone... totally accurate
---
thanks
---
I mean... *what did you expect?* Using OoO against any killer, but *especially* stealth killers is basically holding up a bright neon sign that says **"HERE I AM, COME TUNNEL ME."**
---
 I don't often advocate for tunneling, but I don't blame the Pig at all in this situation.  She's an ambush killer with little-to-no map presence. You knowing where she is at all times makes it way worse for her. 
---
TL:DR, You run OoO, you'll probably get tunneled.
---
About a month and a half from now. Close, but still so far away :(
---
When a killer main doesn't realize that healing is a thing lmao
---
Do not waste pallets against Billy. I’m assuming that’s who you go against the most. He’s gonna try to instabreak them with the chainsaw so you can just keep running around the loop and making him look like a goofball.
---
Do lithe and dance with me work in a way that you can sprint from a fast vault and also leave no marks for three seconds? Or do they not properly interact like that?
---
It's almost as if those two perks help you succeed at your primary objectives. Funny meme.
---
That would be a good start, the place where I buy new keyboards will be missed though.
---
Maybe cleanse before hand lmfao what. Also if a survivor is on the ground and they get adrenaline then how is that winning what? That's a crutch as is noed except nothing stops adrenaline.
---
I’ve actually been going against trappers the most lately.
---
Even as killer, I'm perplex about the weird hit boxes. Makes me feel a bit sorry for the survivor getting downed sometimes.
---
My thought process every time I see a secret offering as survivor:
---
Step 1: Shift + Tab to bring steam overlay.
---
Step 2: Click on Force Quit option.
---
Step 3: Click on OK.
---
Step 4: Find another match.
---
I'd rather newer players feel like they can work through the debuff through tapping rather than hopelessly feeling like they're shit at the game for missing great skill checks, and then going on a witch hunt all game for the hex.
---
Hes fun with some of those brown addons. 
---
But I hate when I go against him they always seem to camp!

Yes. Got one already with one surv escaping.

Yeh this except for all those perks the survivor ran.
---
When is the rank reset?
---
most likely next week
---
Spine chill also increases vault speeds
---
Too complicated, and at higher ranks no one will fall for them and legion will be completely useless, a g a i n
---
I've been up to Rank 1, RNG fucks me over with Ruin because I try to work through it on a gen that's almost done, and get 5 skill checks back to back and with my PC, I can't just hit great skill checks like that, so I get on a gen and like 10 seconds later it's fucked.
---
If you run self care you can heal 99% and when the killer is near top it off.
---
Wraith also has an ultra rare add on that allows you to see gen progression when cloaked - the more progress the redder the gen will appear.
---
Not that you're going to have a ton of ultra rares lying around, but it would be very useful in a build designed to create gen pressure.
---
For me i have to locate the ruin to hit skill checks unless I'm on certian maps because of color blindness issues. The red skill checks are hard for me to see. Same thing with autodidact skill checks
---
No I feel ya but ebony mori ruins the fun of the match rather quickly
---
Puppers gives tips and tricks once in a while
---
So self care is overpowered?
---
I agree with you that all boils down to skills, and this is why i think that restricting the choices a player can make by saying that a specific strategy is "toxic" is bad. If you wanna let the game be decided by skill then let both parties do what they want and don't accuse the other of doing what they should do (killing or doing gens) in the most optimal way (the only exception i can accept is for camping, but that is a shit startegy even for the killer himself since he will most likely de-pip and get like no bloodpoints) But yeah in the end i think we both disagree on the "gen-rushing vs tunneling" argue, since i don't think either of them is toxic while it seems you think that tunneling still is. (and i don't think i can make you change this idea XD) But thank you for answering and keep on arguing till this far in the conversation, i really enjoyed the talk ;) Let me know if you wanna clarify some other point about all of this but i think we are basically done here. Have a nice day
---
&gt; Too complicated
---
I'd say the concept is a lot more simple than most killers. The new Freddy is way more complex.
---
&gt; at higher ranks no one will fall for them and legion will be completely useless, a g a i n
---
That is possible.
---
Gross, a Quentin with no green kit or Pharmacy. And there's Self-Care instead.
---
Or just don’t be a toxic ass and tunnel?
---
Ive heard the opposite. Killers at rank 1 spend 20 minutes searching for survivors and end up with rank 4-6.
---
Probably at the end of the month, but it won't fix anything maybe onlylagswitch
---
I know but in this instant they were camping it
---
Michael, Clown, or Doctor are good for starting imo. I personally really like trapper but he loses viability quickly, he's still pretty good for starting out though
---
I get those sweaty SWF and omega blink Nurses every fcking game :)
---
Nah, it doesn’t get on my nerves in the slightest when I see a survivor staring at my aura the whole game when I’m playing wraith or pig /s
---
I'm pretty sure you can burn her as well actually. Not sure exact timing though
---
Sadly jeff is fucking loud and legion sucks after and before the nerf :(
---
thats the same as just doing a gen normally

It is in the best state and still survivors can just shit on almost every killer's face. Try Wraith or Doctor in red ranks...
---
Lol wasn’t he uh.... *spoiler* the killer?
---
When did this change happen? I keep screwing up and sitting in the middle of the pallet, only to get hit by the killer
---
Hag because of those traps, *those fucking traps*. Also, huntress is moving up in the jumpscare scale because her lullaby isn't directional, a CD it should stay that way.

 Switch claudette for jake

Lol dude you have no idea. As a killer in a mostly survivor sub, I've pretty much ticked off this entire community with my opinions. Biased doesn't even begin to describe it, which makes it kind of difficult to be a participating fan of the game. Toxic is a survivor's word. For instance, I posted a video clip with this title, I shit you not, "I was pissing this guy off all game". But it wasn't considered toxic by anyone, because I'm a survivor in that clip. The only one who felt bad for the killer was the one guy in the comment section that plays killer. It's got like thirty someodd upvotes. Still with me? Now get this, I post a clip where I manage to grab and  hook two survivors before the hatch they were both near opened. But was naking that play even the focus of the comment section? No. Apparantly, because I hit the survivors after hooking them, I'm suddenly an evil toxic troll. Seriously, go read that comment section, it's utterly bananas. Only one guy got it, because yes, he too was a killer. We need to start like a killers only sub or something so we can feel like an actual part of the DBD community without all the needless hate from survivors poor sportsmanship. Also, isn't it ironic how they're always preaching about killers ruining the game for others when its them who will literally tell you how you can and cannot play. Also, whether or not you win, it is ninety-nine percent of the time a survivor hitting the killers inbox with practically everything except a gg. They can't win without putting others down, and can't lose without putting others down. And don't even get me started on how you'll 4k a swf group, only to be invited to their party where you won't be able to get a word in edge wise and then kicked from the party for no reason other than to salt you. But sure, camping is the be all end all I'd toxicity I guess.
---
When you play Legion so well you manage to hit people in other games
---
Wow how did you get Dwight with a beard to be so realistic? /s
---
Nea doesn't
---
For every game posted on here showing toxic, bad behaviour, or whining, 500 games have happened without anything happening (survivors all died and said gg and left, all survivors escaped killer said gg &amp; left etc) 
---
People tend to prefer talking about toxicity or why they where fucked over more then a ‘normal’ match.
---
**wig**
---
Yeah as much of a critic I am too really need to proof read things. I don’t know if your being sarcastic but thanks anyways.
---
Could someone guide me on how to play survivor properly and efficiently? I’m always the goddamn first person to die, always getting caught by the killer first it’s so frustrating haha.
---
Nice sarcasm, I’m sorry that perk is in the game to counter killers like that but ya know you can’t have anything go against you or you want it nerfed or removed. How many aura reading perks do the killers have that can see survivors at any distance but it’s not alright if the survivors use one

If you were working with them like if there were 2 survivors left and no matter what you would not harm one of them but you would kill the other, now you can let everyone live but as long as your not doing some sort of favoritism then yeah it’s fine to let however many people you want live

A little over a year ago, I think May 2018

Oh no I don't message them all lol good god I would never play. I have messaged the odd one, say if I was about to come save them or just before I posted this I messaged someone just to warn them bans are actually being implemented for dcing. I just find it baffling how when I do message someone they never just say 'yup I dced cause I cba' its always some lame excuse. The guy who dced on first down to inspire me to write this post claimed it was a glitch.
---
I would really like a demogorgon inspired killer or event skin.
---
Discordance, Surveillance, Pop goes the weasel, and either ruin to slow the game down (Just little bit) or BBQ
---
Wait Changed my mind we can add Michael Freddy and ghost face to that list

Report them, that's all you can do for now. Servers are coming soon, so lagswitching should hopefully be no more.
---
Offended gang!
---
Would probably buy it right away
---
That's not how you balance a competitive ladder. If you want different balance for both a unranked and ranked mode that's fine, but as long as rank is a mandatory aspect of matchmaking the developers are LITERALLY obligated to balance the game for the top 10 %
---
I get it can happen now and then but every time I have contacted someone or I have seen others have contacted people its always 'my internet went poo poo' and conveniently its on first down lol.

I think Billy is scariest one.

I too enjoy shirtless Frenchmen

Thought that speed boost was separate from spine chill?

Hha u/glenOck did it, props to him

well it's banned in that sub because it has been reposted a ton and it would always end up on the front page for some reason.

Not saying its too complex just saying i don't think my suggestion is incredibly complex compared to that.
---
It spawns in 2 trapped hex totems, and when one is cleansed (by OP here) it means that everyone is exposed for a minute, meaning that they can get insta-downed.
---
OoO isn't just a counter to stealth killers. It's a counter to killers, period. Knowing exactly where the killer is just because you're looking in their direction is a huge advantage. One that's made worse if you're in a SWF since you can communicate where the killer is to you teammates. Also OoO isn't the only perk that counters stealth killers.
---
Yah the medical supply’s in the bloodwebs have been shit and non existent since the 3.0.0 patch came out, I’ve gotten a ton of toolbox’s and other stupid as shit like add ons for the maps and a ton of shit for flashlights in which I never use because I suck with them! So I run pharmacy with ace in the hole and smuggle med kits out. Fuck the bloodweb and it gives out so much useless junk that I never use, I have well over 100 bottles of the crap that lessens the fog!
---
In this instance they were camping it
---
Jeff already have two copies,giving you one without you asking. 
---
Claudette will help you in front of the teacher.
---
Good you had a spare to put on while being on his shoulder
---
Oh I have and that’s the main reason why I got the DLC wanted pharmacy and also wanted to try Freddy, best $7 I’ve spent next to $5 for bubba to have bbq-chili they all have paid for themselves and I’ve smuggled out well over 80 green medkits lol!
---
Spirit. She scares me but she is also my favourite killer.
---
Fucking. Amazing.
---
Ohhh it’s like my marriage man I really wish I could talk though
---
The funniest thing I’ve seen today
---
It's bot intended way to play.
---
Most of the time I'm ok, but the 4 o'clock skill checks usually get me
---
Ye its so dumb
---
And spine chill can counter every stealth expect Michal
---
I'm just new to the game pal, I thought he would have either seen me going to the tree or would have seen parts of my body sticking out of the tree. Every other time I've tried this it's gone horrifically wrong.
---
Trees are OP
---
It depends really, do you want a killer for their perks, or to play them? What kind of gameplay do you like?
---
Yess! I love their videos!
---
Ah, okay, thank you. That also explains what the exposed thing meant as well.
---
Definitely scratch mirror Myers first time I went against it I literally yelled and dropped my controller lol
---
I think he just didn’t want to play against two Claudettes
---
I actually try to stay in the green ranks as that's where all the non sweats are. I used to just be nurse and get to rank 1 within a few hours of the rank reset but where is the fun in that
---
Jesus christ can you not read, see the first comment i wrote
---
Body blocking is actually a bannable offence.
---
Not every map has grass and not every gen is placed in a position where one can observe the rustling of grass. Regardless, if you are struggling with flashlights... yikes. Have you tried listening to the grass rustle when you're blinded? :)
---
It doesn't matter how good, strong, or valuable Spine Chill is. My entire point is that a killer add-on should not remove the counterplay that is inherent to their ability. Everyone chiming in to say how great Spine Chill is has missed the point. It doesn't matter. If the only answer to a killer add-on is taking a specific perk, then the add-on isn't balanced. So yeah, it is asinine to keep bringing up Spine Chill.
---
Also, in your scenario, it's amusing to me that all the survivors are perfectly coordinated and working on separate gens, incapable of being found, while one looper is running around like mad, but the killer is so bad they can't land a hit or push anyone off the gens.
---
I mean, you're not wrong though. If you tunnel one person the entire game, you are not creating pressure on the other survivors so you should expect gens to pop since they have nothing better to do. And if it makes you feel better, no one in that situation is going to pip because the person running isn't getting anything but boldness and the survivors on the gens are only getting objective points. No one is getting altruism since they're all untouchable. But anyway, all the killer needs to do is give up the chase and find someone else. It shouldn't be that hard since everyone is apparently glued to the gens.
---
And I guess we just won't talk about the games where the survivors are human and make mistakes or even the least bit out of sync with one another (you know, most games). The only way to justify Prayer Beads is to assume every survivor is a Spine Chill loop god and every Spirit is just another victim.
---
I’m being punished by killers for using in-game tools to help me. But oh no, bringing an ebony Mori is totally fine and legit and funny to the killer. Totally fair. 
---
I deal with moris, so why can’t they deal with flashlights? I shouldn’t be tunneled and camped for using a flashlight. But okay.
---
Self care is actually kinda bad imo kit takes such a long time to heal I would rather run pharmacy
---
I don’t think so, not until we get the new chapter and Archives, or the map reworks, whichever comes first.
---
Hag or Micheal Myers is pretty fun
---
Speechless...
---
I thought so too man, just takes ALOT of practice because you can't rely on the controls like pc midblink. You just have to be more consistently exact
---
Bug by Daylight
---
Fair reason
---
"You husband now"
---
Is there a place to check stats? Such as how many escapes you have or how many people you kill each game?
---
This is so cute
---
&gt; “tHe eNtiTy sEnT mE” well no he didn’t. This is just a game
---
Of course it's just a game, but it's a game with a theme behind it, and the theme in this game is one where 4 vulnerable survivors are pitted against a murderous killer in a fight for their lives. It's either escape, or be killed. I'm not saying sit there at your PC and roleplay, but there's very clearly defined roles. This isn't CoD TDM, as I've said before. This isn't two equal forces bashing heads and whoever is the higher skilled one wins. It's *supposed* to be one force having all the power, with the other 4 participants being able to resist that power if they band together and play smart enough. That's not how things are, though, because survivors hold nearly all the power in any given match.
---
&gt; Oh look, I lost a chase...and oh. I’m dead, I’m out of the game 3 minutes in
---
Well, as the old idiom goes, "dem's da breaks". Going back to the CoD analogy, or any objective-based FPS, you load in to the map and then get picked off. You're out of the game, at least for that round. That's how it works. I don't see why this needs any further explanation.
---
&gt; I’m just trying to have fun, and this makes the game almost no fun at all
---
Go ahead, have fun, nobody is stopping you. The only thing that's being stood against here is your definition of "fun" being made the standard. It's no surprise that definition is the widespread interpretation due to there just inherently being more survivor players than killer players, but I think it's clear to anyone that survivors by and large lack objectivity. Complain about NOED, but staunchly defend DS. Complain about tunneling, but staunchly defend looping. Complain about Nurse, but staunchly defend map tile strength.
---
&gt; I won’t reply anymore, because, you’re being an asshole.
---
If being an asshole translates to sparking your cognitive dissonance because you have nothing factual to add, and instead only have your subjectivity, then color me an asshole.
---
Is alert really more meta than Decisive or BT?
---
Damn spoilers. I was really hoping he would escape. D:
---
True, but you can’t get micheal with shards, or any dlc character for that matter
---
You aren't that new you obviously have a higher level Nea and a Dwight judging from your perks...
---
Last place gets morid
---
Gotcha. Yeah, I'm hyper focused on 4ks. They just feel better. Thanks for the advice!
---
I can see his frustration in general. If you don’t know what you’re talking about, shut up lol
---
At the end of the match, there are tabs that let you see limited stats. But once you leave back to the main screen, theres no way to see the stats from previous matches.
---
Meg is probably the one asking
---
Did you accidentally press select (or double box). I had something similar happen to me and when I looked in the controls I found out that button inverts the camera.
---
I've definitely had games where I don't even bother going to the totem because it's a god awful spawn  *and* it's on the opposite side of the map. More often than not though, I'll come and chase you off my totem.
---
I do think a lot of new killers don't realize what exactly it is that TotH does, so they run it with no other hex perks. Because I guess reading is hard
---
I can't believe I get to say this, but I think it applies in this case:
---
Get nae nae'd
---
Sal ran into a dying state addon trap today making him tonights biggest loser.
---
For Spirit, I usually run some combination of Ruin, BBQ, STBFL, PGTW, Whispers, Sloppy Butcher, and Nurse's Calling. Because of how versatile her ability is though, you can run pretty much anything on her and be happy. She has some of the most build diversity in the game.
---
They are not in the main game yet
---
I play nurse on console and this isn't true just takes practice
---
There may be a Summer event. Alot of the leaked skins look like ocean or beach stuff. Unless the next killer is related to ocean stuff.
---
Thank you! You're right, It could be :)
---
I'm now intrigued as to how Mary Shaw would work, that could be pretty cool.
---
Wow who hurt you? Resorting to insults because i was only thinking about what the other guy said. You seem to assume i didn't report it to the devs. Seriously get some help dude.
---
That too!
---
Ugh, everytime this happens, I eitberdon't have NOED equipped or nobody blocks for each ofthee
---
You can tell the guy who makes these is a killer main that never played survivor a day in their life lmao
---
Let's not pretend like killers don't have made up rules for survivors as well:
---
* Don't use insta heals
---
* Don't use dead hard
---
* Don't use adrenaline
---
* Don't use object of obsession
---
* Don't pallet loop
---
* Don't use strong windows
---
* Don't "gen rush"
---
* Don't flashlight save
---
Rank 17? What is it just a bunch of urban evading claudettes, face camping, and people jumping into lockers for no reason. We all know that.
---
yeah..no
---
OoO is a perk that you run when you are good enough that you won't die right away trying to use it.
---
Maybe not that new, but some of that comes from playing when the game has a free weekend. Also my strategy right now is to get one survivor to level 40 to unlock their perks and then move on to the next one. Nea and Dwight were some of the first ones I choose due to their perks seeming pretty good to me :)
---
That would be me!
---
I originally mained Huntress, which I liked, but in retrospect I'm not sure if I would recommend when first starting. It takes some practice getting a hang of her hatchets, and her absurdly large humming radius can make even finding survivors a headache. But with perks that help find survivors, like Whispers 3 and Surveillance, she can be a lot of fun.
---
Because of that, I'd be inclined to recommend a simple but stealthy killer to start with, so you can actually get close enough to start a chase easily. Myers or Wraith are probably easiest in that regard. I don't think I'd start with Pig or Ghost Face, as they both come with significant drawbacks that can make them a little more complicated to play.
---
I saw another comment recommend Hag, and I don't know that I agree. She's pretty fun to play and a monster against noobs, but since her power is absurdly easy to counter she's basically useless against anyone with experience.
---
When you repair a generator for one second, then come off of it, go on it again and vice-versa. It's super ineffective and you repair the generator so much slower than usual.
---
I feel like I've seen that nurse skin before.
---
I wouldnt say no
---
How rank 20 survivors see Hex: Ruin
---
When a survivor is affected by Hex: Ruin little to none of them go and look for the totem. If two or three people did go look the totem it would've been over with. Isn't there a saying from killers, "my Hex Ruin always gets destroyed in under a minute". 
---
But when it doesn't get destroyed you lose, unless your a typical dbd player that depends on perks, always brings toolboxes and does nothing but the gens. While your teammates are getting downed and hooked your still on the first two gens cause it's taking a while huh. 
---
Maybe play the game, do stuff other than gens like unhook your teammates, get items, and even destroy totems so you don't continue to cry about shit like Ruin and NOED. Also why is it that killers have rules to "not run this, or not play like that, or do this after doing that". Why don't survivors have rules cause your average survivor is a toxic bitch which is 99% of the community.
---
For real man, the struggle is real out here in these lands 😔😔
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Through steam if you’re on pc
---
I like her on console sometimes. Survivors will come to you thinking they will have an easy time until you start knocking them all down.
---
As a rank 18 survivor (I’m a killer main) I just tap
---
I'd rather have a indicator if its a swf or not, first.
---
Nurse on PC is a nightmare
---
Finally, the plague gets some love
---
Should I pick Hag or Spirit for general perk usefulness?
---
Perfectly nailed it as usual.
---
Especialy the cringe caused by survivors.
---
"Slow the game just a lil bit" -Monto
---
But who won. As a killer main I must know. It's the best sport known to killers
---
Except he live streams playing survivor all the time lol
---
&gt;some tips you'd recommend to someone who just got the game?
---
In general, watching people play the game is super useful as far as picking up tricks, there are several channels dedicated to learning to play survivor/killer, etc.
---
Otherwise, I'd add that while playing survivor is mostly the same no matter who you play, every killer is different. Playing Pig versus playing Leatherface versus playing Myers is very different, and the best way to learn how to play them is the aforementioned videos (in addition to just playing them).
---
&gt;some DLC for the other killers or survivors
---
I personally really enjoyed picking up the Hag DLC, she's a ton of fun to play. I'm also a pretty big Pig fan although she's a little trickier for new players to learn. I recommend getting familiar with what you like about your current set of survivors/killers and then making DLC decisions based on that.
---
Nah bro, that's just Killer Queen.
---
you know what,  I was thinking the same thing.. I will have to add the proper physics bones for dangly bits .. ill try it out ..
---
He also got blinded tho, look at the points gained
---
One of the comments i got was "I wouldn't have camped, I would have searched for other survivors." ... but where should i go search for them?
---
I feel the only thing that is toxic about the game are direct messages / post game chat that are uncalled for. Its the killers fault if he decided to follow the loop. There are plenty of opportunities to realize at the killer "Oh shit I can't catch this squirrely MF" and leave for generator monitoring. But if he did end up catching you, you did your team justice by stalling as much time as you can.
---
The true use for Tenacity.
---
Exactly.
---
well, if i don't know what you're interested in, it's hard to recommend anything \^\_\^
---
but i'll recommend "Clown" anyways, i really like him, he's a bit underrated and unpopular, but really fun and effective. you can use his power to end chases really fast, and they can be used for mind games, and to gather information in chases too.
---
No.. that's not it at all. Whether someone struggles or doesn't struggle, it's still up to **you** to pay attention to your surroundings and realize "hey, they're being camped, I better not go for that save." I struggle even when I'm being face camped, because 1. I like bloodpoints and 2. in most cases it stalls out the game for other survivors to finish the objectives.
---
There would be no way to win the game as survivors. You can't base balancing around "it would be annoying if they did that"
---
Oh boy, granted my opinion on killers is from around when Legion was released from the PTB (I took a 6 month break), it has to have been Huntress or Spirit. Both of them bodied the absolute hell out of me.
---
Fuck that asshole who was looking to take advantage of your genuine misery
---
As a killer main i apologise
---
I like it
---
I mean there's a lot of toxic people that play in general. They could also just be playing strategically and trying to take you out asap so you can't break any more carries. I pretty much only play killer and don't get personally upset by it or go out of my way to tunnel/camp a flashlight but if I have the option of going after someone naked and someone with a flashlight I'm definently gonna try to take down the flashlight first.
---
Just don't pay too much attention to the post game chat. The community surrounding the game is known for being quite toxic, and you'll probably get a lot of abuse. To add to that, one of the games biggest problems are with the devs themselves. There are a lot of issues involving things like killer and perk balance and map design that the devs seem almost intent on ignoring. The Nurse has been far and away the strongest killer since she was introduced over two years ago and has never been looked at. Freddy was in a terrible spot for a year and a half before they did anything with him. The Legion original design was one of the worst decisions in the games history. Leatherface has been bad since he was released. Trapper has been extremely weak for years. Etc. They have outright said that they have stopped trying to make strong killers and just want to make ones that are fun to play.
---
Yeah my friend kept telling me to go back in and come out (bow chicka bow wow) and I knew if I did I would have died
---
They could definitely put in Jack the Ripper since he's long dead and very iconic. Not to mention that two other popular games have featured him and everyone liked him. Now, they won't add killers like the Zodiac or John Wayne Gacy because they are recent and that would be disrespectful to the family members of the victims who are still alive today and were affected by the incidents.
---
Another Hollow Knight player?
---
i dont think spine chill increases vault speed
---
My Trapper baby won at last. I am so happy for him!
---
My guess is the next event will be the Halloween one. 
---
I think if there was going to be a summer event it would have been leaked (with offerings, items, etc) by now.
---
Dapper Trapper
---
Trapper cutie:3
---
Also understand that a stealthy play style doesn’t work too well against him, with your character screaming all the time and with his hallucinations doctor excels at finding people.
---
It's always worth it lol.
---
He was giving serious competition to wraith for best looking man in that damn Bond-esque tux
---
No
---
Spine Chill, and its speed boost, is only active when the killer is looking in your direction.
---
Yeah it’s getting annoying waiting for these to come out now.
---
Bruh.
---
Oh so we’re gonna pretend this dude wasn’t trying to bully the killer gotcha
---
2 questions, i saw some mixed answers about uncapping fps, is it bannable? 
---
And i saw a tier list showing that self care was a top tier perk and now all i see are people saying how useless it is? What makes it useless?
---
OoO + Sole Survivor is OP if you can out live at least 2 of your team mates.
---
Is this really all that common?
---
Sir, I believe you are confused. I’m talking about the entity, the bowel spider thing. Please I’m so confused this is giving me an existential life crisis.
---
Whoever you are leave me alone
---
Seeing Michael myers or ghostface stalking u while u work on the generator always scares the crap out of me OR hag’s traps
---
Get gud
---
I have literally never seen a surv without self care unless they were not high enough level to have it unlocked on another character.
---
Then you’ve never seen me. I haven’t run it in ages
---
Meta*
---
Can they make the death animation by sacrifice skippable? That’d be greaaaat
---
Most killers just aren't built to stop high level SWF. They can, especially if you mastered the killer to such a degree, but most of the time, getting half of them is considered a win.
---
Biggest problem for console nurses is fps issues, on pc it is SO MUCH CLEANER when you blink.
---
I finally hit rank 5 as killer for the first time last month. It happened mainly playing spirit. Once you get high rank and can play spirit well it’s insane how many people give up because they can’t t bag you and click flashlights and loop you as spirit.
---
Entity like universe, didn't have a physical appearence
---
I like that.
---
Madame I’m just a lonely toxic survivor main asking deep methodical question about the game. Please do not bully my big brained skills.
---
Yeah, you can report whatever you want but they won’t do anything about it. It’s the same thing with camping hooks, you can report it but they’ve already said it’s a viable tactic. If you’re holding the game hostage then yeah you can be banned, but body blocking the hook is considered a tactic.
---
You're not wrong but it's still BS.
---
Yep, Console Nurse's have to be much more exact with our blink locations as we're punished much heavier when we are wrong. That's why the steep training hill is so bad and forces a lot of players to quit.

*crawling intensifies*

Well when you put it that way.
---
Yep currently on the Grimm bossfight

"She brought hatchets with Iredescent Head."

"Oh nevermind."

Killers aren't expected to 4k every game. It happens, especially with SWF, that the killer gets stomped. It wouldn't be a competitive game if there wasn't a chance of failure.
---
2 kills should be considered a decent match by both sides. If a killer gets 4 kills that means you decimated the other team entirely. That should not be easy. At the current state it is possible to 4k but not easy at high ranks which is good. Both sides need a chance to win remember. I agree that some swf can be problematic tho. Not really a way to fix that.
---
Nice. Just keep trying and eventually you'll get him. I beat him yesterday :)
---
I really want that bride outfit now.
---
Also those survivor rules are things I've had yelled at me.
---
You...did... though. You actually used multiple strawmans.
---
Man this would look great as a plague skin too.
---
&gt;Based on seeing this clip, they immediately assumed that the reason Billy did this was because OP was being “toxic” by teabagging and flashlight clicking them.
---
Did they say that anywhere?
---
That's ridiculous! The only rules of the game are explained in the beginning lol
---
It's a game, they don't.

I had same situation today

That's why I don't play the game for a week or so after rank reset happens, it's a cluster fuck.
---
Yes 100%!! I'm 550 hours in and I've never met a single survivor who does this. It's frustrating. Even worse when they gen tap. The only thing worse than gen tap is not doing gens at all.
---
Down votes for answering my question.......reddit is a weird place.

I believe you can find the answers you seek @ r/dbdgonewild

I want to tell you that this is inappropriate, but I laughed too hard for that... sorry

---
What the fuck that picture is actually terrifying
---
Entity can actually feed on any strong emotion , see spirits rage and hags hunger
---
&gt;2 kills should be considered a decent match
---
I'm saying that you might be getting one kill at best and MAYBE more depending on how many mistakes I and they made, and that's without high value toolboxes and maybe even a key. And me getting two kills and two of them surviving is just boring and both sides don't feel like winners.
---
I also didn't specify this but SWF's are the biggest issue but most high rank players are SWF's so.
---
I havent used that addon yet, despite him being my favorite killer. How much longer does it take to reach t3?

I thought the whole point of the trials is to give the survivor hope to escape.

“Fix the gens and you can get out”

“Oh no, you’re alone. Don’t worry there is a hatch where you can still escape”

In the time you spent self caring you could do half of a generator.

No Mither is the best perk in the game if you’re not a scrub.
---
I hate the "Cycle of toxicity". Survivors call me trash, teabag me, call me slurs, etc. when I went out of my way not to tunnel or camp, etc. 
---
One guy started spamming F in post game chat because even as killer I had less BP than him, and bragged about how I wasted my BPS. 
---
What happens when I get frustrated or feel like shit from this? I throw on the most sweaty, tryhard build as possible next match and try to end the round as fast as humanly possible or as sweatily as possible. Ebony Moris. Insta-Saw. Iri heads (WITH Moris). Hag with Franklin's Demise. 3-gen Doc with a jigsaw piece and Dr. Worldwide build. 
---
I hate it. I get treated like shit, and I get frustrated and take it out on the next lobby who in hindsight did nothing wrong. I Mori'd a baby dwight a few days ago out of paranoia/frustration from a previous Sabo-Squad the match before (They all had toolboxes and one with a flashlight, so I was expecting the "99 every hook while McLoopyPants loops killer around blinding at every pallet, drop hook once killer downs them, teabag) and felt like shit afterwards. 
---
I just wish this game had a rematch option so when people talk shit "GG EZ YOU'RE TRASH LMAO" I can at least see if the shitter is up for a second match with no holds barred. (He'd stay in the lobby, and anyone not up for the rematch would be replaced with new survivors) Maybe it could happen once dedicated servers are up and running. (Although there should be a limit to one rematch so killers couldn't find 4 people wanting to farm and literally farm 20 games in a row or something) 
---
Sorry for rambling just tilted. Today's been a very shitty day for me.
---
Hey it's a good question I don't judge haha

As long as it has Android 7 and up then you are good but you need an account that has been set to Denmark as it’s region
---
This post has me dying 😂😂
---
Sounds like you’ve had one rough match and are generalising it into most games. Yes the potential is there for that to happen however the amount of times it actually happens is extremely small, you just remember it more because bad memories linger. Survivors are at the weakest they’ve ever been and killers are at the strongest they’ve ever been.
---
Lery's includes a lot of loops and windows that make it playable against. Low lunge, 105 movement and no bloodlust make him a horrible chaser
---
MYERS SMILE CUTIIEEEE

Your suppose to wait 30 seconds everytime you make a circle.

It just polite.

Np, thanks for the compliment  :)

That's why both teams can burn a map offering
---
Does it not exist on console or is it just that nobody in their right mind would play Huntress with a controller?

I was just messin but I appreciate the genuine comment♥️

Thats why you get a designated totem hunter in your group aka me. And have that bad boy gone in 60 seconds
---
I was just messin around waiting in Q for my games and I made the question, I genuinely appreciate how kind you were about how idiotic the question was, this sub reddit is awesome lmao
---
scratched mirror Michael is really fun against low ranks, but its like unwinnable against red ranks even on Lery. Its a fun but not OP addon. Well designed imo.
---
What the actual hell? Fam, we're discussing a game.
---
Skill checks are client side so any difference you feel from ping is purely a placebo
---
u/theannoyingcrow poorly worded his post but he is right that moris are far worst than map offerings.
---
Aim for the body then look up. 
---
If you have a yellow flashlight with no addons it’s significantly harder for some reason
---
Ghostface and Michael, they are the only ones that give me jump scares and I love it. And the hag's traps. But while I really enjoy playing against Ghostface and Myers, I just find the Hag super annoying.
---
Run adrenaline do gens problem solved and basicly ni time lost
---
The beginning segment with Ghostface and Legion is a good callback to how Ghostface was during the initial release of his PTB. He was such an underpowered wimp that had no choice but to eat pallets and blinds. Thankfully he got buffed into a solid upper-mid tier position.
---
I'd actually like a one time use bottle of pills, like a insta medkit for one health state super fast to use and ultra rare maybe op though?
---
I was trying to point out how your post had poor logic. A map that guarentee a win is obviously unfair, and moris are also very unfair. I'd personally say mori are worst than map offering for sure.
---
Yo can you make a wallpaper out of that still shot on the new Ghost mask? It's sick af
---
I probably shouldn't have used the word guarantee, because Haddonfield is strong, but nurse will kick their shit in.
---
Then it must just be horrible frame drops on Xbox.
---
Yeah, fuck you for even considering this......
---
Exactly. I actually played as scratched Myers many many times. Vs low ranks its a blast but red ranks can literally laugh at you.
---
Fixed it for you
---
Also, probably could have used a lot more different examples
---
I have 15 hours on the game and it happened to me. But they were all shit and couldn't loop me so I got the 4k
---
True lemme edit that lol
---
The killer trying to take advantage, sad. Good on your part.
---
Yeah wasn't disagreeing with you, only stating the obvious.
---
It takes too long. It’s better to find another person to heal you, otherwise bring a medkit. 32-40 seconds is a lot of time to be either doing a gen or doing them totems. Tbh it’s a great perk for those that are just starting off but once you become experienced you’ll realize it’s a waste of time. I’d suggest you run bond because you are able to find others to heal you and there are other uses for this perk. Hope I’ve convinced you that self care isn’t that great.
---
Happens way to often... and I just want to say. From the bottom of my heart... Fuck you.
---
I'd say nurse guarentee a win way more than any map offering ;)
---
Rule #3 dude
---
Why did they take so long to check the lockers?
---
Dwight has entered the chat
---
Huntress Lullaby doesn't work with Jigsaw Boxes, but I think Unnerving Presence does. This build is something that will probably work in green ranks, but in red ranks you will get destroyed with it.
---
But trapper isn’t even that bad to go against lol
---
I imagine maskless Michael to have a blank expression like his mask
---
According to the Survivors rules for killers Rule book rule #518 A killer cannot bring Franklin’s Demise
---
The power role is whichever side has better players. If it's a 1/50 4man coordinated SWF, they'll probably win. If it's a good killer against a bunch of randoms, all four of them better be good or the killer will win easily.
---
If you got friends it is easy to cunter this jus make one of them touch it then leave,  wait for the killer to come and leave and repeat the process
---
Noted. Honestly forgot there were rules.
---
Being shit at it is part of being new at the game though. They're not going to get less shit unless they stop gentapping and start practicing the skillchecks.
---
A common chase route is to run up the stairs and then run down the other stairs, that’s probably where she went or she checked to see if I ran behind her back to the pallet spot.
---
Hahahaha, I love the new episode.
---
this isn't 'nam, smokey
---
Huntress Lullaby does NOT affect the boxes, (Devs think it'd be too powerful for whatever reason. Same with Third Seal) but believe it or not Unnerving does from my testing with a buddy in KYF. 
---
I am very curious if Dying Light and Thanataphobia also can slow down box search times which we never bothered testing. Interlocking Razor causes a MASSIVE 60% reduction in search progress if they fuck up the skill check meaning with Unnerving and a TR build, you might be able to get heads to blow up because they miss a skill check and lose too much progress.
---
It's hated because you waste a lot of time with it, when you could take a Medkit or Adrenaline.
---
How do I become a better Killer?
---
To clarify, I decided to run Huntress, and while she is fun, what I found works is rather campy, and it's boring after a few games. I want to know what tips and tricks other Huntress Mains do to make each game fun not just for them, but for the survivors as well.
---
No, you are not hurting the team. It's an OK perk. While someone is healing you 2 survivors are not working on gens. That makes a killer happy.
---
&gt; It’s better to find another person to heal you, otherwise bring a medkit. 32-40 seconds is a lot of time to be either doing a gen or doing them totems.
---
Wether you waste 40 seconds of YOUR time, or 20 seconds of both your and someone else's time... its the same effectiveness.
---
The main difference is letting someone else heal you will give them altruism points, but self caring does nothing for emblem progression.
---
Well when your teammates are potatoes, it is not fun at all. So maybe that is the counter, play swf?
---
What do you mean by "insane killers" ?
---
Sal stepped on his own trap while carrying a survivor today making him tonights biggest loser.
---
It’s not that the perk itself is hated, but more of what it encourages, which is wasting a lot of time healing when there are more important things to be doing. Gens generally get done quick if you’re in a good team but if everyone is self caring whenever they’re injured it gives the Killer too much time to sway the game in their favour. 
---
For example the current meta involves Adrenaline and DS, so if you’ve just been unhooked and there’s only 1/2 gens left, it’s better to try and finish them to pop Adrenaline or if found by the Killer then just go down, use your DS and waste more time for the gens to be done.
---
We already have a ranged killer....
---
Me too
---
What, it wasn’t even Dwight
---
4 of then are scattered about, and you control 1 of them at any given time. Power is the walkie talkies with a 30 second recharge the talkie is able to switch you to the next legion in the que.
---
Legion is worse than pig
---
It’s probably just you but you probably made that persons day if that was their first escape
---
I mean, wow without a doubt a bigger game, but activity of the subs somewhat comparable. If you satisfied with the way things are it's okay, I just got the impression that there is too much noise to talk about the game seriously.
---
well, she probably went to hide as soon as the heartbeat got more intense, so not for no reason
---
Rule Number 34- 696969-31

Get rid of the key and you got yourself a deal.

IT would lose as his only weakness is not being afraid of him... the entity doesn't know fear.

You waste even more time trying to find someone to heal you lol
---
I don't know why exactly, but something tells me this video doesn't need to be one and a half minutes long.
---
Am I the only only one bugged because the bottom photo is out of order?
---
The Beachcomber Willy. Never forget the "The".
---
How many times per trial do you self heal? 2-3? How much time does the med kit save per heal? around 20 seconds? So at best the med kit will save you 40-60 seconds.
---
A good commodius toolbox with addons on the other hand will probably save you around 25s per gen (80 -&gt;55). So essentially its pretty comparable imo.
---
No, because Scratched Mirror Myers is actually really weak against decent survivors, while Balance Landing on Haddonfield is incredibly strong against any killer that isn't Nurse.
---
"And by that, I mean I have 4 blinks now"
---
Dodge them next time, its works for me but if your queue time its long welp bring a mori and camp

Shirtless Myers vore is my new fetish.

The Aqua Man. Spaced for copyright purposes... But he looks like Aquaman from Injustice.
---
yeah, it happened to me a lot, it's just the fact that you pressed it way too late and she was also really close when she hit so she didn't have to go for a lunge
---
Same here. I let the last one go as long as they aren't toxic or I'm trying to double pip
---
If your teammates are potatoes then almost any killer will destroy them.
---
&gt; You waste even more time trying to find someone to heal you lol
---
Agreed. i never understood why people scream that self-care is useless, but expect you to find another random survivor and have them heal you. However, there's no guarantee that another survivor will heal you, or that you can even find one.
---
then they say "take [x] perk" -- but that defeats the purpose of not taking self care if you're wasting a perk slot just to make up the difference of not taking self-care.
---
Moral of the story: don’t go into bubbas basement.
---
Yeah I don't expect it to be good. Just thought it'd be a fun quirky build
---
Honestly I would like to see the new stats of escapes. Last time it was in favor of killers. Pretty sure now its the same or even worse. It feels like survivors are more potato. Ofc if you go against 4man swf its gonna be hard. But usually when I play killer I have 3 or 4 kills pretty much every round... I can sweat a bit more against swf but yeah. Bit of camping there and there and its easy again.
---
&gt; recent nerf to several survivors working on the same gen
---
i missed this, where can i find more information?
---
I’ve mained killer since picking the game up, and I think they shot it into Oblivion. It definitely needed something done to it, and I think the original idea of also having safe hook rescues proc it, it would have been fine.
---
Both have meta perks, Hag has Ruin, while Spirit has Spirit Fury. You should try to get both.
---
That quote bombed.
---
What if it proced max once per game, and only if hit by the killer whitin 10 seconds of being unhooked. So kinda a "self BT" perk.
---
I bet the salty survivors will make the devs nerd him within the first week 😂
---
Pig is bae

&gt; 220px × 142px

what the fuck?
---
Wraith is pretty good to start as killer, because you can find survivors quickly and understand how to chase survivors with a M1 killer. Legion, Myers and Cannibal are also pretty easy to start with.
---
Maybe if you go around the map by the outside and use the other gate it might be less risky
---
I’m doing it on mobile and I don’t edit a lot, sorry

If you don’t care about the bloody clothes then no.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUyQqGaThs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpUyQqGaThs)  this isnt some rare glitch... it happens way too often, not just me
---
Yes.
---
Yes Behavior please just devote all killer skin resources to making more amazing Hag skins not like any other killers could use any variety or quality
---
I think the reason people hate self-care so much is the common statement; "YOU COULD BE DOING GENS".
---
That statement, in itself, shows that they think about this game in one aspect which is finish the gens. They don't realize that there are perks available that increase your survival that have nothing to do with gens. What does unbreakable have to do with gens? Borrowed Time? Adrenaline? If I have those 3 perks, do they effect how fast I do gens? No. They don't.
---
Self-Care, in my opinion, is a top-tier perk if you're playing solo [SWF is a different story]. The amount of time it takes to run around and find someone, and THEN be healed by them, is offset by the time you heal yourself. It takes 32s to heal yourself, but it also takes 10-15 seconds [at the minimum] to find someone and get healed. And then it takes another 10s to get fully healed by them and be on your way. Taking that into consideration, you save ~7-10 seconds. We also have to take into consideration the time it takes to go BACK to your gen or find a new gen to work on with the survivor that just healed you. Hence, you end up wasting even more time than if you were to just heal yourself. 
---
Mentioning med-kits, however, is where things get tricky. I do agree that bringing a medkit is better than bringing self-care, but I don't think that statement is something to be relied upon. Why bring Prove Thyself when I can bring a purple toolbox? Why bring an exhaustion perk when I can stun the killer with pallet and blind with flashlight? Medkits are not infinite either, self-care is.
---
At the end of the day, Self-Care is a great perk. It allows you to be less dependent on your teammates, and increases your chances of survival. To me, Self-Care [along with Spine Chill] have been the two most impactful perks when playing online. Right now, I run Spine Chill, Self-Care / Decisive Strike, Balanced Landing, and Borrowed Time.
---
Just wanted to give you a crippling injury before you left.
---
Can you please elaborate?
---
I wouldn't exactly say it's hated, I just feel like the original meta of it isn't as good and useful as it was in the past. Nowadays, from what I've seen, most survivors (especially SWFs) just love to run and loop killers around all game so that gens can go by faster. Nowadays, perks like Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Deliverance, etc. are the meta for 3 reasons: (1) They extend the running and looping time, (2) they make tunneling for killers not as easy to do so that the killer can't get kills faster, (3) they in general keep survivors alive for longer and make the gens go by faster; the more looping time there is, the more faster gens go by. So I guess, seeing as how gens takes a total of 80 seconds (or shorter time with multiple survivors on one gen or if toolboxes are being used), survivors just really aren't willing to waste 32 seconds of their time away from gens just to heal.
---
It’s equally annoying as a survivor when your team dcs, makes the game so much harder.
---
How should I be stalking people as Myers? I've really liked him, but it feels like the moment I get into minimum distance for Stalking, the survivor IMMEDIATELY notices and LOSs me in a second.
---
lol only did this once during a farming session or when I have the game won sometimes I just get tired of winning
---
The Devs looked at the perk solo rather than how it combos with other perks such as Borrowed Time. MoM was insanely good because it combo'd extremely well with other top-tier perks. However, this nerf seemed far too harsh. The perk went from top tier to dumpster tier. No one runs it and it's a waste of a perk. It's a shame.
---
At the start just walk around the edges of the map towards gens and hide behind walls and trees and try to get as much as you can, then mid game just stalk during the chase as they're running
---
A good spirit should almost always win. She’s really solid at rank 1. Better than Billy imo.
---
Drag?
---
Shes ranked under Nurse amd Above Billy to most, shes 2nd best, and if you're good, she destroys
---
Spirit is better than billy but worse than nurse.
---
Prayer beads spirit is a win.
---
Take off huntress lullaby and  try Infectious Fright
---
Nobody really plays huntress. Ive played console for about a year now and encountered like 2 iri head huntresses
---
i didn't know they were a swf so i was like fuck me dude
---
yes I sure do love sitting at a generator almost done for 3+ minutes because someone keeps missing the great skill check and halting the progress, AAAND won't leave me to do alone
---
ruin is annoying as fuck - there's so many more fun perks to use aside from that.  I've been enjoying surveillance and discordance together, esp on stealthy killers
---
(inb4 'just hit great skill checks all the time lol' like they're supposed to be easy for everyone)
---
Its always LF with the claudette face that do this
---
much better my man!
---
It wasn't exactly a nerf, more of a bug fix, it was always meant to work like that. Having multiple people work on a gen at the same time gives diminishing returns. So one person on one gen works at 100% efficiency, two people working on the same gen has both working at 90% efficiency, 180% speed, three people working is 80% efficiency, 240% speed, etc. It used to be everyone just worked at 100%. It was like having Prove Thyself eqiupped on everyone all the time.
---
At this point, I’m beyond surprised whenever I see a Leatherface who DOESN’T camp.
---
Not that rare tbh, most of us like to let people go if they played well and weren't toxic
---
The problem is when I'm with someone else on a gen and we each get 4 skill checks within 5 seconds, and our gen regressed 20% immediately, and then we get more skill checks and going for great you accidentally fail a skill check, alerting the killer to chase you off and kicking the gen in the process. Even if you don't mess up a skill check, the longer it takes you to finish a gen, the more time the killer has to patrol and hear you working on it to chase you off.it slows the game down IMMENSELY, especially if you're with randoms who just run around the map looking for it instead of doing gens. Then they get chased and hooked, and suddenly 2 people are on death hook and no gens are done. 
---
It's an incredibly frustrating perk. Some matches you find it in a minute and the game isn't delayed much. Other times it's in a god tier position and randoms refuse to work on gens until it's found, or the killer camps it or constantly keeps traps on it. It's so frustrating.
---
Sorry for the rant.
---
I think that would be a lot better than it's current state. Although, I feel like the way the perk is now is fine, they just need to alter it so it's a little easier to get rather than it being  nearly impossible to get like it is now.
---
can we have it change her hum to the wedding march?
---
Nurse S+ tier, Spirit S tier, Billy S- tier.
---
GlenOck is one of the most irritating people I’ve ever had the displeasure of encountering in this sub.
---
Yeah, I think the safe hook rescues would be a lot better.
---
Yeah, I imagine console Huntresses would be pretty rare, considering the game has no aim assist.
---
What?
---
Huntress isn't fun for Survivors in any way.   
---
Its not because shes super overpowered or uncounterable, but because her hitboxes are a big BIG mess.   
---
Her hatches could be replaced with basketballs and it would actually represent the hitbox better + part of the hitbox is able to clip through objects and hit survivors on corners etc.   
---
Its so incredibly ping dependend ontop of that.  
---
They did fix the hitboxes to fit the hatchet perfectly and people cried the living hell out of it until they reverted it.   
---
Huntress isn't broken and unfun to play against because shes OP, shes broken and unfun because her hitboxes are ACTUALLY broken and the day they fixed it the Huntress mains started crying like little girls.   
---
I was able to score even better with her after the "nerf" as you could clip through way tighter areas but you had to have incredible reads and aim.   
---
Don't play Huntress, if you want to have fun for both sides and still enjoy high killrates play Hillbilly / Hag / Clown or some like that.
---
yeah, doesn't seem like that big of a deal, to be honest.
---
Thank you :)
---
Pig's got Loop control because of her crouch, true. But asking for 1 hit and they're ran down isn't too much to ask. Especially since the movement speed from the active. Maybe have his active ability also unlock the max bloodlust passive for it's duration, even on uninjured targets. That way he'll have strong momentum.
---
He’s gotta be packing something to make up for you know, the rest of it.
---
He’s also got designated flairs on said sub- he gets ‘John Kramer’, everyone else gets ‘Disciple’. Like, normally you wouldn’t take this seriously, but since it’s *GlenOck* we’re talking about, it’s easy to see that he actually thinks of himself as the leader of something meaningful.
---
Yeah, I agree. I think a little rework would have been fine but instead they just completely nerfed it into the ground.
---
“This game is fucking terrible but I can’t stop playing it”
---
Exactly

Ngl I like to think it’s just all the weight pulling down on him.
---
I think a buffed feral is all we need. Even if it’s just allowing a player to use it whenever despite the power gauge not being full. Although a lung attack (if there is one it’s not noticeable at all )  I think is needed since missing an attack will take you out of feral.. a little extra because I think it would be fun the lung attack allows you to jump pallets and windows little extra range added to the lung with a pallet jump

---
This bug happened to me on Friday. Restarting the game fixed it.
---
I mean. Challenge wank?
---
Thank you
---
Oh trust me, it was.
---
Bubba gets a bad rap, so when I play him, I hook everybody once for BBQ and then go guard my juicy basement chest.
---
Next rework is probably going to be Nurse since the community have been complaining for ages or even Spirit, now that she became more popular and people are starting to understand how unfun she is to go against.
---
If you’re good with her you can dominate
---
Hey there's the snake head
---
Nope, trimmed it down, but in the end it kept that timing. So Oh Well!🤣
---
This is not honest work
---
I love how one of her legs is basically all bone. I don't even play Nurse, but I'm super tempted to pick it up.
---
Goes the other way too, don't get mad at how survivors play, if they t-bag to get your attention, gen rush etc.
---
Just play the game to enjoy it, since rank doesn't matter winning/losing shouldn't either. The only thing that should matter to you is if you are getting your BP/Shards or not.
---
It's a killers job to kill survivors and its the survivors job to escape. It's so simple I'm amazed people fuck it up
---
1000? You serious?
---
Good spirit will destroy good rank ones so I’d say she is pretty good at high ranks.
---
It's not because it's better to find someone else. That's just wrong. 
---
It's because healing in general isn't always worth it. Plenty of killers have instadowns. Legion's power exists. Plague exists. You shouldn't really be healing against some of them anyway. It's often much more efficient to do generators injured to get adrenaline or leave even if the chases are shorter.
---
\*laughs in tenacity\*
---
AHAHHAAHH
---
Who? Who actually complained about the reworked Freddy? Nobody did!
---
Begone with this obvious attempt at karma farming!
---
We're better than this. YOU are better than this...
---
It's required in order to become good at that, though.
---
1000 for dulls, 1500 for hexes. As a Small Game lover I am extremely erect.
---
Thing is, I didn’t even do anything to annoy him. I went down embarrassingly easily as well pretty early on (not my proudest moment). And as you can see, it wasn’t like it was a gen rush. So... there was really no reason to camp me.
---
Gen times were not increased. And the comment already includes moris being usable on first down.
---
I fell bad for the hooked survivors watching me do a dull totem instead of rescuing them 😂
---
So fun. Much skill.
---
As a Claudie main I can confirm
---
The reason I run around and get the hex totem is because I have the worst luck in the world and I pretty much CONSTANTLY get skill checks. I lose progression from Hex Ruin faster than I fix generators. And it’s almost impossible to “git gud” at Xbox skill checks because it runs at like 20 FPS
---
He punched the highlights out of her hair!
---
Don't forget the 20 second cooldown on Sprint Burst and Adrenaline during release. And how Exhaustion perks used to recover while running. Or how they didn't share cooldowns between them.
---
You can run a huntress around a loop 5 times that you can only run a billy or trapper on 2 times. Thats how much a difference 5% makes.
---
If the huntress runs at 110, and the survivor gets a 2 second headstart, not counting lunge range you are looking at 20 seconds of chase for a hit before even factoring in windows or pallets.
---
Ramp up a killers speed and it becomes literally impossible to escape in some circumstances because the map simply generates pallets further away than is possible to seperate distance on a 119 killer, before even factoring bloodlust.
---
Equip hope as a survivor and go against a huntress and watch as you can literally loop her the entire duration of the perk while she struggles to catch up. Speed is everything, and underestimating it is stupid.
---
The doctors gimmick is that he wants to force you to do mistakes.   
---
If he chases someone, instantly run up there to get your Tier 1 madness and you are gucci on that part.   
---
If you are the first one to get tagged you are in a normal chase with a 115% MS Killer, he CAN disable you from doing things for 1.5 seconds when he shocks you, but as long as he is in shock mode he only moves at 110%.   
---
So just get a longer loop, like the shack window etc and even if he shocks you you can run the loop once and drop the palett / vault the window.   
---
Doctor harshly punishes greedy loops, you have to drop the Paletts a bit earlier against him or a good doctor will electrocute the fear of the entity into your body as every of those greedy palett throw attempts is a hit.  
---
If you absolutely can't get to a safepoint to drop or vault while he is in shock mode RUN INTO HIM and circle him as close as possible, its almost impossible to hit someone touching you with the shock as its a cone starting from your feet (super narrow hitbox at the starting point) if he starts switching hope you can reach the vault/palett you wanted (this is a pretty advanced trick that only works in narrow scenarios but can win you games if used at the correct moment)  
---
Also focus on skillchecks, don't fuck them up too much and yes you CAN be stealthy around the doctor, but you are on a timer between Madness levels, so always keep an eye on your madness timer.
---
Ds and self care arent op lol.
---
I feel like people who post this shit don't play survivor too often, I hope you get camped everygame and all your friends who just bought the game get camped in their first 10 matches and uninstall, let's see what you have to say then.
---
I play her on console but mostly due to having a PS4 pro, just takes some practice to learn :)
---
I remember a couple times I typed gg in the middle of a guy screaming at me just to piss him off
---
Happens to me every day I play. Y do u think ppl started using dead hard early because that’s the only way it works lol.
---
*aggressively rubs own thighs for 45 seconds as the rest of the team gets demolished*
---
Not an exact measurement, but...
---
A fuck long time.
---
Who? My stupid ass DBD friend group on Xbox who saw small ass YouTubers and streamers struggle against the new Freddy because they're bad at the game. I just decided to unleash my discontent through this dumbass meme because I know others who have had a similar experience
---
I used to play her to get self care but let me tell you when I played her I sure was a real dumbass
---
That was a sarcasm, i suppose? Just wanna make sure.
---
I see a lot of people say it takes too long for what it does so it's bad, but while it takes a while, it's certainly much better than being injured
---
It hilarious how when I'm coming up to help someone on a gen they get startled and blow it up.
---
This is strangely wholesome.
---
Just because you don't get the distance you'd get from a successful hit and aren't able to hide well with NM doesn't mean his perks don't synergize well. People ask for a bonus to NM, WGLF exists. Dead Hard needs the user to be injured in order to work, NM keeps the survivor injured for the entire round, which also negates the downside of NM only needing one hit to go down.
---
I just bought the game and have had 3 glitches happen to me
---
Its harder but not impossible. Just takes some practice. I faced a good nurse and it was so amusing seeing other survivors go down so fast.
---
Its pretty impossible on corn maps though. Especially against brown clothing claudettes
---
Maybe survivors will do them instead of complaining about noed
---
if the rest of the team can't get anything done while someone heals, the game is a wash anyway
---
Also, I couldn’t heal,wiggle or use my dead hard all game.
---
I think if they open with a key you can. I’ve never tested it though.
---
Sexy time :3
---
Didn't think I would need an /s but apparently so.
---
That face... those eyes! Wow, this skin looks so good! Can't wait to see how it turns out in the game. Thanks for the render too!
---
"Good Job so far"
---
 We were on the verge of greatness, we were this close
---
I feel like “Trapper do what he like” needs to be on a shirt.
---
I've been having problems with Alert too, but for me I'll hear the sound, look around, not see the killer at all.
---
You know you can make the text larger right
---
[survivors getting mad at franklin's demise ](https://imgur.com/a/M5SVU0Q)
---
I had three claudies on hooks before in the same game, and they all dcd
---
It's not a bad hook but a lot of bad survivors use it. And those survivors who use it play passively and then need carried
---
The traps only become active once a general as for is completed. If you put one on a survivor after all generators are done, it's not going to do anything.
---
I don't get it man, no ruin no addon micheal hit you once in tier 1. Why leave? I had a guy leave today because I blinked towards him as nurse..... on console..... at the 1 minute mark
---
haha what
---
I do agree with this, but idk it just works in my favor for some reason, my swings hits survivors even though they shouldn't
---
Thats actually happened a few times. The killer closes the hatch mid jump and you get put back on the ground...
---
Clown, it's finger lickin good!
---
*Strangle me mommy*
---
It only partially negates the downside of NM, and WGLF as a bonus works really poorly on NM because chances are youll get way less bloodpoints overall, and the option of taking protective hits to get WGLF stacks is basically gone. 
---
Synergy implies that by running the perks together you'll have an advantage over someone not running those perks in combination, but in the case of David's perks you're only running his 2 other perks to partially compensate for NM in the first place. 
---
Why would you ever run David's 3 perks together when you could just run them separately for much more benefit? WGLF synergizes way better with BT than it does with NM. Dead Hard is way better on someone without NM because you can take a hit from a killer AND you can then use Dead Hard from the injured state.
---
I have actually had a slug race where i ended up actually ended up having tenacity equipped. Got called a cheater lol
---
As a killer main, I say both survivors and killers should play dirty without the “tOxIc BeHaViOr” shit
---
I used a meme generator on my phone and screenshot cropped so the meme maker wouldn't show
---
As a huntress main, I've taken to telling my longtime boyfriend "you husband now" and rolling up my pants to "show some leg"
---
It’s harder but not impossible. It just takes much more practice
---
I don't know how to feel after this.
---
Tap tap tap to freedom
---
You could have left them and worked on another. Probably found the totem on the way.
---
To start things off, Nurse is not unplayable on PS4, people just get that idea, because of the fps and sensitivity that console has. It doesn't make her unplayable, it makes her require more skil lot play, but not unplayable. You also gotta keep in kind that the more blinks you do on console, the more your fps drops, so just do 2 blinks and not more than 3. Otherwise you will have a bad time when it comes to tracking people.
---
Now, I will say that some of these tips aren't worded greatly or need to be changed and here is my take on it. 
---
The first tip is great, i have no problems with it.
---
The second tip needs a bit of rewording, but the info provided is true. For example, if the survivor runs out of view of you, then blink to the corner that they went around to get in line of sight of them. Then use your second blink to hit them or to gain distance for a clearer shot. A shorter phrase for this is "Do not predict the survivor, react to them."
---
The third tip is amazing, nothing wrong with it. Just remember that blinking isnt everything when it comes to Nurse, you can just walk and hit someone.
---
The fourth tip is pretty good, but remember there are some pallets you wanna break just to make it easier for line of sight purposes. Like for me, I break killer shack pallet when i have time and the two pallets next to the bathroom downstairs on the Game map. Other than that, just leave them. 
---
The fifth tip is good.
---
The sixth one is what i think is incorrect. I have done regular blinks without add-ons, blinks that have less fatigue, 3 blink Nurse, and Omega Blink Nurse. To be honest, Omega Blink Nurse is so much easier on console ONCE you have had much experience with her normal blinks. For me, I can run both and I will be fine, but that isn't always the case with everybody. So Omega Blink does in fact work, you just need more experience with the regular blink first. 
---
The seventh tip is something I am iffy about, because on larger maps like the corn maps or the red forest maps or other large maps, you need to blink at the beginning to get around to finding your first victim, but on small maps like Campbell's or the Game, you don't need too. But for me, I blink at the start, no matter the map, I don't mind the survivors knowing who I am when I am Nurse.
---
The final tip is also really great, but remember that you don't always need to go for new targets during chase to apply pressure. Sometimes I will see killers go after healthy survivors to add pressure, but end up failing and they lose all of their pressure, so just know if it is the right situation. Like for me, I will switch targets if I hear a genny is almost done and I am close to getting my PGTW. I will go after the person or people on the gen and down them then use PGTW on them and find the person who i smacked earlier, just healing in a corner. So I blink to them and apply more pressure.
---
I will add on some perks as well as what I think of the perk and/or how it could be used for each perk. 
---
Perks on the list
---
1. Ruin - good for slowing down the game, but I recommend trying to not use it so you get better at applying your own pressure.
---
2. BBQ - Nurse can travel pretty quick, so this is useful for her.
---
3-4. Sloppy + Nurse's - Goes hand and hand in slowing down the game and applying pressure, plus they can eeplace each other.
---
5. PGTW - makes quick work of those pesky generators.
---
6. Surveilance - I wouldn't recommend this quite honestly, I mean, if you dont have PGTW or BBQ, then maybe. I dont really run Surveilance on anyone but Hillbilly, because you either need to be a quiet killer or a very threatening one to get something out of it in my opinion.
---
7. Make Your Choice - I wouldnt recommend this perk either unless you plan on going to the Game map or Father Campbells, because most of the time the person with MYC will just hide out until the timer is gone.
---
Perks to add to the list
---
1. Shadowborn - When you are fatigued, you can see more of your screen, which in turn will help you figure out where the survivor went, this is especially good if you are just starting out. 2. Monitor &amp; Abuse - This is good for getting the jump on survivors, plus it adds field of view by 8 at max, which is just 7 under Shadowborn, so it helps in multiple different ways. 
---
3. Thrilling Tremors - This may sound weird, but this perk can be your BBQ replacement, especially if you are Nurse and are rocking PGTW. I used it once and had a good time with it, but I still would say BBQ is the better option. 
---
4. Infectious Fright - This perk is amazing on Nurse as you can teleport after downing someone to go and find your next victim immediately. I wouldn't recommend this on a normal build unless you are feeling gritty, but it is good for slugging with Nurse.
---
Perks that didn't quite make it
---
1. Devour Hope - I love using this perk on multiple different killers, but it relies on map and survivor rng too much to be considered a "must run" perk.
---
2. Haunted Grounds - You can pair this up with Ruin, but if you are going up against a half competent swf team, then they won't pop the totems until someone knows of Ruin or they will just go through Ruin and render 2 perks useless. Now, this perk can poo off and when it does, it's awesome, but even then I get maybe 1 down every time it is popped as any killer, so thats up to you.
---
3. Blood Warden - This is usually not used with Nurse, because by the time end game comes, you will jave either killed all the survivors or you have done very poorly that round and most of them are escaping as we speak, so it isn't great on Nurse.
---
Some builds I love playing with Nurse that I would recommend are here and how I use them.
---
Standard Nurse
---
[Addons] - Pocket Watch &amp; Metal Spoon / Dull Bracelet &amp; Metal Spoon
---
Offering - Any
---
Perks - PGTW, BBQ, Nurse's Calling, and Ruin. 
---
I run this build as my standard build on Nurse and it is very effective, as I am not amazing at playing Nurse on console. As I said before, I recommend not using Ruin, but I am not the best Nurse in the world either, so if you want to apply your own pressure, I would recommend Monitor or Shadowborn instead of Ruin.
---
No Heal Nurse
---
[Addons] - Pocket Watch &amp; Metal Spoon / Omega Blink (aka Ataxic Respiration &amp; Catatonic Boy's Treasure)
---
Offering - The Game Map
---
Perks - Sloppy Butcher, Coulrophobia, Distressing, and Thanataphobia.
---
With this build, no one would even dare using self care. Even though you won't see them healing, if they do, it will still take them anywhere from 48-56 seconds for healing using Self Care. This means everyone will most likely be one shot for you as most people won't heal, so you will get easier and quicker downs, and apply so much pressure everyone that you wont even need Ruin or PGTW. I ran this once and got a 3 man dc, because they knew what I was doing and I got a big fat message about it, saying how bad I am for using a build I thought of. Besides, they should be thankful it wasn't Doctor on the Game map. 
---
Basement Nurse
---
[Addons] - Omega Blink (aka Ataxic Respiration &amp; Catatonic Boy's Treasure)
---
Perks - Agitation, Iron Grasp, Monstrous Shrine (Actually a really good perk in this build), and Ruin.
---
This build is pretty nasty when it pops off. When you get your first down, try and get them to the basement, if you can then you have 1 person off a gen and 1 person not looking for Ruin. Then if you get more, it adds up. With Monstrous Shrine up, people will go for saves faster, as the bar will go down faster, and if you use Omega Blink to it's full potential then you can blink to the baeement and not have to worry about Borrowed Time ruining your pressure. I have ran this build many of times and it is really fun, you might not need Ruin for it, but I put it there to add a lot of a pressure alongside having survivors going for basement saves. Your objective is to get evryone in the basement as the name implies, but if you can't then just hook them normally.
---
No Blink Nurse (Meme Build)
---
[Addons] - None
---
Perks - STBFL, Ruin, NOED, and Spirit Fury.
---
This build is for fun, dont get butt hurt if you lose to it or are losing while using it. Don't camp with it or tunnel, just have fun. I literally got messaged by the most entitled survivor while playing this build, they called me retar*** and told me to go up against his friends with coms while using this build and that we would all see who the bad player is. He was obviously trying to shame me, because I got him fair and square, so I camped him while he was in the basement. I just laughed for the fact that he was spamming my chat with fa**ot, just because i was away for 10 minutes, so I told him it was just a game and to move on, and I never heard from him again. I ended up getting 2 people that game though, but seriously, don't be a douche when running this build or seeing someone run it, just meme with them XD.
---
That's all I have to say about the Nurse on console. I played a rank 3 Nurse last season before rank reset and plan to climb again, but if you want any help my PSN is KingExcalibur8. Just ask me and we could do some kyf to let me show you some tricks or give you some tips or etc as Nurse on console.
---
Thanks for taking the time to read this!!! 😃
---
I've seen at least 5 hatch key escapes, a few that ended with successful hits, but no grabs yet.
---
I have 2 Myers &amp; nurse
---
Literaly see the killer across the map with no gen done after 0.000000000000000000000001 nano seconds after the game started: exists

I feel like Premonition does better job at locating the killer.
---
It's the big scary
---
Ugh I managed to get a NURSE stuck in a pallet like that the other day. She also tunnelled and camped but I felt too shitty winning off a bug and vaulted it to free her. She instantly downed me.
---
I also learned when nurse gets stuck she floats in the air above it.

It also showed that Survivors at high rank have a 80% survival rate.
---
I have a better idea, how about if OP and everyone who upvoted him doesn't mind getting camped and ebony mori'd we just put them in a special queue with all the campers and ebony mori-users, that way we don't have to play against asshole killers and they still get games against people like OP. Good idea?

Haha, not too rare, I was attempting adept doctor achievement the other day and had same encounter, someone already disconnected just go... then I realized you can get adept even if one escaped or disconnects as long as you hooked them enough.
---
IMO, it should of been increased to 5 hits in stead of 3, or require 3 safe un-hooks, the protection hit idea was an awful idea.

As an Ash main I can say I want this.

What’s the issue here ? You pressed it to late ?

Hot

I used to think the same until I met a Nurse who killed all 4 of us before we even repaired two gens by using precise blinks.

Well yeah if they have thrill, but most people don’t use thrill, I’m just saying my friends r idiots

Is it dumb to play survivor to learn but dump all my bloodpoints into cannibal to get BBQ? I figure that way if i ever play killer, i get some use out of it, and then i can focus on levelling Survivors

Fair points let’s be real

isnt waiting for the good skill check penalty to be over and working through it the same thing? i never understood the actual benefit of getting off a gen after a good skill check.

Hmm..
---
I mean, my friend one taps it when they have ruin, I just go along with it.
---
I’ve tried to do this but my team never cooperates. I always get the killer to get what I’m trying to do but my damn random teammates NEVER understand. Smh
---
Everytime that dude says "Don't get caught shittin in the Tall Grass" I crack up 🤣🤣
---
A DC equals a kill
---
I always run a firecracker, just run in front of the killer as they pick em up, drop it and watch the killer shit themselves
---
Nah.. You manipulate the user game settings not the actual game settings so you release the cap on yourself and not overall in the game. It isn’t bannable

Update: eventually managed to get out, but we were chill so I gave them the win and followed them around. I guess we kinda boosted for BP, they let me hook them and then they healed each other so idk, but with only 1 gen left to go it was a loss anyway.
---
That's better wording, it make sit better
---
i don't wanna sound rude or something but your idea it's a big no from me because if we take it by logic, you need to be hit 6 times (unless the killer is Billy, LF, Myers, GF or has instadown perks) so you can be finally sacrificed (unless the killer is slugging). you'd be better off to just take a hit while the killer's carrying someone, run away, heal and do that again.
---
If I can go two minutes without generators getting done before my Ruin is broken it's served its purpose as far as I'm concerned.
---
The new freaking freedy is so f**ing weak lo!, just hide in a locket in the real world

Hey look, theres as.. I mean ann from persona
---
Flashlights
---
- When you aim a flashlight at a killers face, you will begin the process of blinding a killer. It takes some practice but it takes around 2.5ish or so seconds to blind a killer fully. You will know because you will earn bp for doing it. 
---
- If you blind a killer, it will totally remove their vision for around 3 seconds. 
---
- Blinding a killer comes into use in 2 scenarios. One is the most common where you blind a killer as they are picking a survivor up. You will want to start the blind while the killer is nearing the finish of the survivor pick-up animation. There are tutorials on youtube on the timing but when you have it down you can reliably save survivors who are being picked up by the killer if the killer does not look away from you or look at a wall while performing the pick-up.
---
- The other scenario is blinding during a pallet break. A killer is animation locked during a pallet break. You can use this time to blind the killer to prevent them from seeing you when you run from the pallet. This is a good way to earn bp but not particuarly useful. 
---
- If you become really skilled with the flashlight you could use it mid-chase but its very situational. Zubatlel has some good flashlight videos where he chain blinds killers mid-chase to make them run into walls and create more distance.
---
Keys
---
- Keys have a bunch of aura reading abilities based on the add-ons they have. At base if you have no add-ons then you cannot channel the key to do anything. With add-ons you can see the auras of either survivors or the killer depending on the specific add-on. Some of these add-ons only work within specific ranges meaning if you have an aura reading add-on for survivors and no one shows up, it is likely that there are no survivors near enough to trigger the aura reading effect. The purple and Pink keys main use is to open the hatch that can spawn in the game. They effectively allow you to escape the game early. 
---
- The hatch spawns based on an equation. It spawns when 
---
Number of completed gens = number of survivors alive + 1
---
- In other words, if 2 survivors are alive in the game, 3 generators need to be complete to allow for the hatch to spawn. As a result you could use a key to open the hatch and instantly escape without needing to do the last 2 gens.
---
- If you are the last survivor alive the hatch will spawn open regardless.
---
Totems

- If a totem does not have candles lit then its a dull totem. This means no perks are attached to it. 
---
- If a totem makes a burning sound and has candles lit under it, then its a hex totem and upon breaking it will either activate or deactivate a perk.
---
- No One Escapes Death is a hex perk that activates when the last gen is fixed. It causes one of the dull totems to become a hex totem to activate its effects. Always a good reason to destroy all the dull totems to stop this perk from potentially activating.

I feel like the bulge in his pants should be bigger, but besides that good work, the art looks nice.
---
 to slow the game just a lil bit
---
Bond is an information perk. You're not just seeing who's nearby to heal you. You're seeing who's in a chase and if you need to move. You're seeing someone working on a gen while you're being chased so you can avoid sandbagging them. 
---
I find that kind of information more important than being able to heal myself.
---
I suggest playing whoever has the most interesting gimmick to you. I saw that you tried Myers and sucked at it, that's perfectly fine. Don't even worry if you eat shit while you're getting into Killers, nobody was good at any killer their first game or two with them. I love Myers, but he's not for everyone. Wanna shock people and force them to make mistakes? Play Doctor. Wanna make players paranoid to vault windows and pallets? Play Trapper. Wanna look cool? Choose whoever looks coolest. What I'm getting at is you're gonna have a much better time if you just test the waters before worrying about efficiency. 
---
If you want suggestions, though, Wraith and Huntress are my other favorites.
---
Scratch marks only help if your near the survivors or lost them in a chase. Crows aren’t that useful unless your running spies from above (or whatever it’s called) or the survivor is doing absolutely nothing
---
No, it would just decentivize playing as him as you don't get a buff from saying groovy
---
*map lights up on mementos
---
*dwight making gen, suddently, joker join him while morgana look confused, then look back, and fear get unleashes his eyes
---
 *dwight look back, joker tries to summon a persona, but it doesnt work, joker looks back, with dwight escaping
---
"me no wants to see escape, me just want you to hear your screams"
---
*screen goes black
---
Did you really repost the same thing 3 times?
---
&gt; never do gens
---
I wish it were just DBD but the entire industry seems like they need to treat quitters with kid gloves. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a game release with quitting deterrence implemented at launch. We’ve had over twenty years of online gaming. You’d think by now the industry would have come to understand: it doesn’t matter how fun your game is, certain players are going to quit if they start losing — *especially if there’s little to no drawback for doing so.*
---
God fucking damn it. And Reddit here claimed I didn't. So I tried to multiple times.
---
I just had a match with one and had to walk around the whole map looking for it my teammates praised me like a god 😂
---
But it's not a Nerf either cause they already know that gen got finished, him saying "Groovy" would do nothing but confirm that it was an Ash who did it.
---
I feel called out, here.
---
That was accidental. Reddit showed I didn't post anything on my side.
---
Apologies. I didn't know it did posted, Reddit showed nothing on my side.
---
For both yu and u/dragonuniverse227 : 
---
If the survivor is nice enough, they can get you out of it and very often they will. This bug has been around since launch so you're very likely going to find at least 1 survivor in your lobby who knows(And hey, maybe you'll be able to help someone too now)
---
When the killer grabs a survivor sliding over the pallet, the killers gets freed. (Remember, the survivor needs to be injured)
---
Spirit is one of the only really viable killers in red ranks. Better than Billy against good survivors, pretty broken with Prayer Beads + Mother Daughter Ring.
---
Imagine a solo game with actual friendship.
---
This looks super accurate to the game! Nice work!!!
---
Mine is 6 months, yours is 3 months. 
---
If you read the info with that they state that the data is based on your rank after the game. Since somebody at rank 1 who fails to escape Lilley depips, that explains the big jump from rank 1 to 2.
---
So consoles highest escape rates are about 50% and PC is 60%. 
---
Still, in the 3 months between our data the escape rate increased. Wonder why. The Plague being crap maybe?
---
No, it is a Nerf. You make an extra sound. Even if it is the tiniest of sounds, it still is one that isn't with every survivor so you'd be hurting yourself playing as Ash so you wouldn't want to be playing as ash because if you complete a gen with the killer near bam, he knows where you are or what side of the gen you are on. It's an unessecary nerf
---
I attempted to post this video on this subreddit. Reddit, on my side, claimed I posted nothing. So I posted it again... and again. I deleted the last two, I apologize for the spam posts.
---
I don't main Ash but this would be awesome lol.
---
Could just be that moris are bugged in the same way that BPSs were bugged (causing 1 person to crash in the load screen)
---
Flashlights blind the killer and have to be directly on the face and you will get points for killer blind on the left to know when to let go
---
Keys can have add ons on them to see the killer or gens when you mind channels, very rare and ultra rare keys have the ability to open the hatch , the hatch spawns when the number of survivors alive + 1 gens are done and can be tracked and opened with a very rare or ultra rare key
---
Claudette: Insidious camping?
---
Me: *Laughs in Kindred*
---
Self Care just takes way too damn long now, especially if the killer has Sloppy Butcher. I put on Bond and never looked back; it'll get you heals and a whole lot more.
---
Ya which is why I'm at the point of probably  maiming nurse even though I hate her. It just doesn't feel so much like an uphill battle as her
---
Yeah happens often.  I was working on a video with Ghostface where I would Mori everyone I could until I had moried every survivor at least once,  I can confirm that people DCed right as the offering came up.  
---
I always try to 2 hook before a mori though.  Using a mori is actually detrimental to the killer if used to quickly. You won’t get enough chase or hooking towards a decent emblem.  Not to mention the loss in BP.  It’s much better to let people go until they would be deathhook anyway.  Unless your running a dying light build or just want to get a daily done.

I had someone Teabag and loop me for a long ass time, every time I got close to him he just hopped the pallet or looped again and started teabagging like crazy and using follow and point. Once I got him, I literally went to hook him, just to see his friends with their medkits near us, facecamped him, all they needed was one more gen and they could go, all Iwanted was him and his annoying ass dead. Well, they all gott smacked once, but got him off the hook, then I got them down one by one and let them lay down, as I chased the ones trying to put them back up. I actually managed to get them all  down and all into the basement, got  the holiday achievement and  3 of them DC'ed before they were sacrificed, only to have a rank progression error after the game. Emotional rollercoaster.
---
Interesting. When should I stalk vs actually chasing the surv?
---
Well there's no way to say what it is but the Survival Rate in three months jumped from 50% to 80% so who knows but it kinda strengthens my point a bit.
---
You’re an asshole
---
I guess that makes sense.
---
The worst and funniest I've encountered is a basement insidious camping Huntress with iri-hatchets. I honestly wasnt expecting that when I went for the save lmfao
---
Yeah it would only close again if there were 3+ survivors in that scenario
---
Literally saw this meme a couple days ago but alright
---
Synergy implies that something works with something else, not that it will "have an advantage over someone not running those perks in combination." Running NM is a challenge as it is (as it should be), the other two of David's perks make that challenge a little easier.
---
Really?
---
Oof
---
Yep!
---
Hahanfkciaab this is honestly hilarious
---
Might have had the idea before me. Should I delete it or what?
---
Most of the hag skins leave something to be desired.
---
Thank Nea for dead hard
---
The other two can't be solved permanently. But Shirtless Myers is forever, baby.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
As you play more and get higher in skill level, you won’t need to rely on it. Playing injured won’t be as detrimental. But also, consider, many killers use Sloppy Butcher/Thanatophobia/even mangled add ons, which tremendously increases the time it takes to heal. Stack that onto a 50% speed self care heal? No thanks. I ditched self care a long time ago, and I don’t miss it. Plus, medkits are incredibly easy to come by, and they do the job much faster, especially with the added time penalties of the previously mentioned things. My real question is why the hell would anyone play solo survivor 😭
---
Your call man, just giving you the heads up that it's been done.
---
Thank you for the explanation, I was trying to use the flashlight to stun killers carrying victims but I didn’t know it only blinded them lol oops. As for the key it makes sense now why it wasn’t doing anything as I didn’t have any add one for it.
---
Well. If we're isolating GF and Myers elements. Myers without his mask or knife is just a tall silent man. GF is just a man or group of men... or even... teenagers.
---
Legion is horrific in their own ways considering background. Let's start with how none of the members except Frank were delinquents. Then he got his friends. He leads them down to do simple pranks. Then it went further. Dragging everyone else further into crime with him, slowly and steadily to not scare them off. Then... they attack a man who saw them. Frank does most of the work and then tells the others to finish the job. They're in too deep. So they all stab him and finish the poor sap off.
---
You're cherrypicking the aspects of characters. Myers isn't Myers without a knife. GF isn't GF without that mask. Appearance wise GF is literally the second least intimidating character in DBD. Legion is the least physically intimidating,  and Pig is pretty low too.
---
The fear Legion plays is that everyone can do heinous acts, and others can hide that heinousness and drag others down with them. Just because that could be "common" doesn't change shit. Myers is literally a guy in a mask with a knife. The first movie would be fine no matter who it was under that mask. Because anybody can be a killer.
