Someone with sense in this hell hole

I had to block all non-friend messages on my Xbox account just because of the toxicity from this game's playerbase. I think you'd be better off hiding the endgame chat and making your profile private. I doubt BHVR will be doing anything about it anytime soon, even one of the game's most popular twitch streamers gets stream sniped and harassed on the daily.
---
Well when her base design is p shitty, and the new ones are darker aka free sneak points it's kind of a no brainer.
---
I hope its BHVR tweaking things from the optimization, we havent heard from that in a while
---
&gt;Totems are strewn about randomly, in sometimes VERY well hidden places. Finding all 5 can be quite the chore.
---

---
I often find totems just by traveling to each gen. They're not exactly that hard to find exept maybe on indoor maps, and even then long-time survivors have all of the spawning spots memorized. 
---
&gt;And this allows them to be ready and search for them.
---
Survivors should already "be ready \[to\] search for them." Totems always spawn on every map, lmao. Survivors shouldn't have stuff to hold their hand. 
---
&gt;However, this still provides the issue of Totems sometimes being STUPIDLY well hidden.
---
It's not an issue. It's RNG. Sometimes you get fucked over by RNG, and that's ok. That's how this game works, on the elements of uncertainty and variables. It seems like you want stuff to be gauranteed, and that's not how this game works. 
---
&gt;Bottom line, NO ONE likes playing perfect all game, not getting hit at all, opening a gate and BARELY getting hit by the killer, oops NOED, and getting sacrificed. Sure, you still pip. But it robs you of victory and a good chunk of bloodpoints.
---
As if the game is over just because you got the last gen done. Survivors are entitled as fuck if they expect to escape just because they got the last gen done. The game isn't over until you escape or die. On top of all of that, if you get hit by NOED, you **didn't** play "perfect" since you obviously fucked up and didn't cleanse all of the totems. And "barely"? Either you got hit or you didn't, there is no "he barely hit me". Finally, victory should be your BP, not escaping.
---
As they rightly can and should. SWF on voice comms goes against the whole design of this game.
---
I mean we new that was gonna happen..
---
Oink
---
I understand what you're saying I just wish there was a legitimate secondary objective instead of cleansing totems because you don't want to get one shot. Also it should tell survivors they are exposed as soon as the gens are popped. They are literally exposed but the game doesn't tell you to help the killer.

people will think that yakuyoke and PB are a yoinking build, but after you hook someone after yoinking, you will see  who decides to stay in gens and who are on the move, try to yoink a second one, once that happens, go for slashing the injured rescued previous one, the fun begins there. No need for more yoinking except people who go for totems

Shards are earned through levelling up your account. Playing any game will give you XP, which then rewards shards on each level up. Once you have enough shards (9000 per non-licensed character), you go to the Characters tab in the shop, and it'll give you the option to buy them for shards. Licensed characters from movies are only available for real money purchase.
---
This game would've been 100% more scarier if it was first person
---
Crazy how experienced huntresses can just feel if it will make it. Muscle memory is weird!
---
Then every killer should run identical perks?
---
I know, it still makes me sad Pig though. At least they look great!
---
That's what I call a pigga
---
Dude I feel so bad when I'm killer (rank 12) and get like rank 20's and rank 15's. And it happens a lot more than you'd think
---
no, you don't. The problem here is the skin costs 1180 auric cells, and you can buy 1100 auric cells for 10 euros, but because it costs 80 more, you have to buy another pack worth 5 euros, and won't be able to spend the leftover on anything.
---
Well, that is the lowest-ranked Killer we have now, so true, but it sort of furthers my point.
---
They just justify it so they dont feel bad when they act like a miserable asshole
---
That viewpoint is a major problem that people who dislike NOED have. They see it as rewarding a "bad" killer, rather than taking the effort and time to forsee the risk of NOED and actively work towards denying it. Each totem is at max 15 seconds or so, and with each survivor doing one and the last one doing two, it shouldn't take that much time to cleanse all of them before going back to gens. I've often found totems randomly while just running from gen to gen. People need to learn that instead of considering NOED a "reward" for a "bad" killer, they should consider it as a punishment for bad survivors not respecting the risk of NOED potentially being in the match and focusing only on slamming out gens.
---
Thank you! I HATE it
---
Not gonna lie, most Pig mains on this sub are annoying as hell. Its like they come from Tumblr.
---
Yeah im having issues myself as killer
---
A killer can just wait out DS. I see what you mean about Adrenaline kind of. I lose way more games with the "solo survivor experience" so I only play SWF now and I feel like that is the direction the game is going for many people.
---
Lol yea thank God I have a ps4 or I would've had to forfeit these points it's been about an hour and a half since the glitch

i envisioned them as earmuffs, and the notes were myers humming, but it could totally work as headphones xd i wonder that sometimes too, my dude. probably something funky.
---
The problem is if this happens, the killer will just stand there and wait for it to happen, and if it happens, a smart killer will assume you have DS and just slug you. Congrats, the game has been needlessly extended.

The pedo claim is a bit over the top imo, I hate Ochido as much as any other sane person would but the girls were in their late teens and for as far as I can find Ochido is only 20, thats nowhere near worthy of pedo claims

---
&gt;as survivor you ARE NOT in control, thats not your role, you didn't choose the power role in a 4v1 asymmetrical pvp multiplayer game, you choose the weaker but more numerous one
---
Looks right but this is not how the game plays most of the time now lol that's why you only see a small rotation of killers at high ranks. Cuz the balance is very blatantly on survivors atm.
---
Are you still there? O.o
---
Legion is imho F Tier, which sucks because i want to Main them, but to make it very simple : You need your Power to chase survivors, but you can't down them with it. Or in other words, Legion is only really able to down a survivor if they are braindead. At rank 10 and better, a survivor will never be catched by a non-frenzy Legion and wouldn't you know, that makes Legion literally unable to down survivors that are atleast decent. 
---
My buff suggestion would only be 2 things : Make exposed work with Frenzy, theres literally 0 reason why Nurse can make use of, for example, MYC but Legion can't. Second buff would be that already injured survivors are downed even with Frenzy on. Now if they have a deep wound (the effect Legion's Frenzy afflicts) it would be like now, that they don't get downed, but if they are injured and don't have a deep wound Frenzy should down. Because right now all a survivor has to do is mend the deep wound and they can just tank another Frenzy hit.
---
Because on some maps the game fails to reach the minimal amount of Pallets and starts placing them closer together

---
I agree on the secondary objective, but the totems and inherent risk of NOED potentially being in the match should stay. And if the game told everyone they were exposed as soon as the last gen was done, every single survivor would go into insta-stealth mode and nothing would get done. Of course it should stay that way to help the killer, they've been waiting all match long to use their perk or risk losing it. It's meant to be a surprise perk.
---
Ohh my lifeee!

I like the idea, but what if you changed the pitch of the sound to make the entire bottle line from "land down under" just from that one missed swing?

Speaking of bloodpoints when I first got the game on Xbox game pass (it's special edition)  I had like 100,000 blood points already despite never playing a game before but my 2 friends who also got the game didn't get bloodpoints.
---
I HATE IT WHEN NEW PLAYERS GET SALTY BECAUSE I MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE KILLER AND GET THE HATCH. MAYBE IF THEY ACTUALLY LEARN STRATEGY THEY MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN CAUGHT. DON'T GET SALTY IN CHAT.
---
That's all completely irrelevant.
---
Flashlights need a buff, but nothing should ever operate on an exploit. Justifying flashlights using a bug in the design like animation locks allowing free blinds just ensures that flashlights will never get a buff they actually need to be viable AND that the bugs will never be fixed. Oh, and it's actually 60% of the time.
---
GOT CALLED A TRASH NURSE BECAUSE I 4K'D THEM WITH BBQ1 ,NURSES, M&amp;A, SB NO ADDONS/OFFERING BUT SINCE I WAS RUNNING BBQ I'M A TRASH NURSE AND I SHOULD JUST GET GOOD RIGHT?
---
Being able to wait out DS is irrelevant. The killer has zero idea if the survivor actually has it or not until they get hit with it. The killer can slug the survivor to wait it out, but they might not even have DS. The killer is making a choice concerning the risk and potential of that survivor having DS. 
---
SWF goes against the very concept of this game and I hope the devs eventually figure out how to fix it. Survivors seem to want reliability and no mystery, which is the exact opposite of this game.
---
Wrong post, buckaroo.
---
Pretty much. I play both sides and as a survivor i cleanse a totem if i see it. I mean the bloodpoints is what we all want at the end of the day. (Well at least I do)
---
I ain't bout to be the one who leaves
---
I mean Nurse is still the best. 
---
But this person is probably just mimicking everyone else who says Nurse is #1 and then the rest is their actual list.
---
If Nea is the Entity, Meg is Satan.
---
*Not today Satan...*
---
With Borrowed Time if someone unhooks you inside the terror radius of the killer you get protection from the next hit from the killer so you dont get downed in one hit.
---
If you get rescued with BT you want to take a hit from the killer and get to safety with the speed boost from the hit.
---
You're going to be in first person anyway.

It's not forcing. You have the power to stop. You can be free if you believe in yourself.
---
Yeah see that's not how you fix a problem of having less content. Plus, they'd have more content to grind with these shards if they didn't lock it behind DLCs.
---
I would argue about the plague tbh. If survivors dont cleanse, thats literally noed for the whole game for them. And you know how 1 hit chase can differ from 2 hit chase in length.
---
Same about legion, people dont seem to heal against him, and that makes his power alike to plague's "no cleansing" variant of power (weaker version of it) except he can traverse the map way faster.
---
I recently returned to dbd, and now am maining Bubba for that sweet bbq. And from my perspective, power that lets you have everyone in onetap condition is not that bad as it may seem. Nowhere near top tier, but well its m1 killer.
---
(Also bhvr pls buff piggy)
---
I used it for a week then dropped it because my teammates kept still 3 genning themselves. It was impressive, not gonna lie.
---
The PS4 game lobbies are ridiculous. Either this message or 3man lobby bug. It sucks
---
&gt; if you unhook someone in like 3 seconds after I hooked them no fucking shit I will turn around and hit the first person I see, don't blame a killer for your own stupidity
---
This is known as farming a teammate. It is easily recognizable.
---
I have almost 1300 hours in this game, playing both sides. If I see a survivor farming their teammates, I will go after *them*, not the poor guy that just got off the hook.
---
You cannot actually say "don't blame a killer for your own stupidity" *when that survivor has no control over what the other survivor does*. You're literally being a hypocrite and blaming *the guy that got farmed* for *someone else's stupidity*.
---
It really sucks getting farmed, and sucks even more when the killer punishes you for something you can't even control.
---
Is it against the rules? No. Does it make you an asshole? Sure does. Don't be surprised if people let you know it after the game.
---
After all, people play videogames to have fun. If you are going to do things that *you know* are not fun for the other side, you have no room to complain about people letting you know as much. As easy as it is to forget, there are human beings on the other side of the screen (both killer and survivor) just trying to have fun. Some are salty idiots, but if you are receiving a overwhelming amount of it maybe it's something you are doing in game causing it.
---
Lastly, the developers *do* take action against serious abuse, as long as you report it using the in-game tool. They don't care about generic trash talk, but if people are being bigoted, hateful, telling someone to kill themselves, etc you can report them and they will be issued escalating bans.
---

They aren't though? All three pieces would 1,320 cells if bought separately. If you buy the whole set though you get it at the discounted price of 1,188 cells.
---
Balance wise survivors are supposed to die. BHVR said they expect a 50% kill rate to be balanced. The problem is no one wants to be in that 50%. People play like this is a team game, it's not. If it was you would get bonus bp at the end for others getting out. You dont. All that matters is your own survival.
---
Ok let me edit my original comment
---
I really don't see earning auric cells happening...

That would just make me more enraged if you do that and I can't wiggle off.

...oh, man, I was about to say "because they already spent $20 on this game" but we're living in the future now. Overwatch is $40 base and has this kind of chicanery. I'm going back to the early 2000s.
---
Don’t worry buddy. The devs will have it patched by 2021..
---
This game has no loot boxes so that doesn’t make sense
---
Bamboozle is only needed for infinites like the Myers house. Bamboozle otherwise only removes the need for killers to learn how to counter loops with vaults. That's why the "Bad Billy" meme is NOED + Bamboozle + Ruin. No respectable killer runs Bamboozle and thinks they're good at mindgaming loops with vaults.

Give me gingerdead man or give me death. The evil bong would also be a great addition

---

---
I personally want a reverse bear trap cosmetic for Amanda, to go with the first film.
---
For my experience it pizza and baby Dwight
---
Petition to make this a skin, I’d play pig every fuckin day if this was a cosmetic
---
I'd be down for it, but I'm not sure the devs would allow it.
---
&gt; abuse unfair loops
---
What in your opinion is an "unfair" loop? A strong window that survivors use until it gets entity block? A safe pallet that the killer is  forced to break? Or just any pallet in the game at all?

Now if they were killers.

One time I had a facecamping and tunneling Nurse that was bad.
---
Had to farm Claudette so they wouldn't get to stage two. They get tunneled, I pallet save them.
---
Nurse still tunnels, couldn't save them again. Farmed them again, tunnel ensues. 
---
Firecracker save them. Tunnel ensues again.
---
Me and my friend body block and they wiggle off. Once again goes for tunnel, but we both body block, getting me down.
---
By this time, gens are all done and I get hooked for the first time. 
---
Claudette and other rando leaves, I tell my friend to leave after seeing those two leave. 
---
I die on first hook.
---
Its not 60%. That’s the rank 1 percentage. And it’s not an exploit if that’s literally how it’s designed. Which it is. An exploit would be a never ending killer blind by doing it over and over again (which is possible) or doing it through slats in a wall (which used to be possible).
---
Well I agree with you.
---
I thought you might be one of those people that think any pallet that survivors can loop around is an "exploit" so wanted to make sure.
---
This is what Im talking about. GET OFF MY LAWN.
---
god no i play survivor im not gonna say a pallet is OP LMAO
---
Cool, thanks! Good to know it isn't just me.

Well the 1/10 times NOED activates for me, it was needed. When it’s four days after reset and you’re going against people already at rank one, it’s kinda tough. I am running bamboozle because its after a recent reset, and nobody knows how to pallet stun. I was running enduring + spirit fury, but it never activated so I said screw it.
---
Yeah, it's honestly one of the worst feelings as a survivor. You're already contending with the killer to stay alive, and when you have someone who is *supposed* to be a teammate basically ensuring you die, it just makes you not even want to play.
---
The devs added a Safe Unhook condition to WGLF, but I still see it happening from time to time. When I play killer, nothing irritates me more than a survivor farming their teammates, because I know what that feels like.
---
Even a dying f13 got dedicated servers before they completely ditched the game
---
I find it easier to learn how to be a survivor after playing a few rounds being the killer and understanding what they see and do
---
Oh good I’m not the only one that used to think and do that.
---
If he goes to live just as he was on the PTB new Freddy's gonna be so average it hurts
---
You good
---
this is literally how premium currencies work. they make it so you need to get either a higher denominator and have way too many left. or you just can't buy it because you're 20 short when you get the amount that's closest.  
---
Microtransaction'd again. darn.
---
that small map with the sand, god the memories
---
YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR A GOOD OPENING TO GET SOMEONE OFF THE HOOK! UNHOOKING THEM WITHOUT THE BORROWED TIME PERK WITH THE KILLER TOO CLOSE IS CALLED “FARMING” ESSENTIALLY FARMING FOR ALTRUISM POINTS AND IS CONSIDERED BAD FORM. ALSO, YOU CAN’T JUST LEAVE THEM ON THE HOOK IF THERE IS AN OPENING TO SAFELY OR SEMI-SAFELY UNHOOK
---
LAUGHING MY FUCKING ASS OFF!
---
i heard that it might a bug. Some people said that the price is normal in mobile (i dont even know if pig is available in mobile, someone correct me if im wrong)
---
well mate, no one can escape skill
---
Killers have alot less to complain about. DS and MOM got nerfed. Their main valid complaints are if they play respectfully and get shittalked by survivors which I don't see happen all too much. Although I play survivor a lot more. They also complain about SWF sometimes lmao
---
Aw man...
---
At rank 20 - 11 you get innocent Dwight’s you start getting the toxic ones at rank 10

He used the wrong meme so I downvoted him. Immersed Clauds don't do infintes, they hide, Neas and Meg's do infintes. 
---
I take memes fairly seriously.
---
I do declare that you *ooze* manliness!
---
At rank reset they all go down to 15 and below.
---
Isn’t that a bug? Honest question because i feel like i’m cheating if i do this
---
Old auto heaven be like
---
It is there in PS4 check it out.
---
The amount of safe pallets on certain maps is certainly an issue...but I got called toxic for just casually looping a Spirit once, lol.
---
this comment made me ponder greatly
---
i mean honestly it might not be a troll account, there are people out there with brains this big
---
🤡
---
Dead during daytime
---
A lot of people thought it was stupid when the skins first came out but then a majority of this sub defended it and looks like behavior might have taken notice but I seriously hope they don’t go that route.
---
how about no

o i n k
---
Wouldn't Clown be the Smoker though?

_i wont tell anyone_
---
Are you making sure that you're holding the action button (space on PC) to make the progress bar go all the way up? In other words, are you fully completing the action instead of just tapping the button. I know I at least did that when I first tried kicking generators.
---
Or stealing his purple flashlight when they were playing against a franklins bubba
---
It’s literally luck of the draw when it comes down to it, I don’t like the term outplayed because at most intervals it’s not because of a master play - it’s oofy game design, a fast vault not working, the killer hitting you through the window or spontaneously starting to lag the second the chase goes on for too long, and I’m not saying 1 person dying isn’t fair - I am saying that persons skill shouldn’t be judged from the killer hooking them literally one time and then
---
Standing in front of them until they die. 
---
The game will make a person depip if they were camped, which isn’t fair because that’s out of
---
Their control in the literal worst way possible. This isn’t like death garden where you’re rewarded if the others escape, you’re still needing to be completely cautious of what you’re doing because in the end YOU have to make it - the game doesn’t acknowledge the grand span of teamwork ultimately, which is why you find so few people naturally in the mindset to help one another in this game that is supposed to revolve around that concept.
---
Once you get yoinked off a gen i feel like spirit will be A tier for you

He is trying to teach the pig how to mori
---
Ghostface is semi broke, most of it isn’t but sometimes the game just decides to not function
---
**she doesn’t even go here**
---
I dont have a problem with that, but I had 20 bucks in my steam for months, waiting for this to drop. Now I need to either waste money on the five, or do the more likely thing and go in for the 35 dollar one.
---
Even if you leave the game to avoid post game chat what OP is saying is that they're leaving it on his steam profile, which can still be accessed after the killer leaves. He knows he can make it private but he's just pissed at the fact of how much survivor mains cry if they don't get their way.
---
*Look who's shittin in the tall grass.*
---
Sadly it will be at LEAST a good 6 months since they already reworked them

Alive until dawn

so u made an opinion based off of one time you watched his stream? yikes.

---
Do you want a bozo button?
---
Fengs in my experience are a mixed bag, Lotta toxic ones, normal ones and some babies mixed in there
---
Regardless of whether or not it is a bug, you aren't cheating. It doesn't give you an advantage over the survivors, it just gives you an idea of where they could be.
---
r/okbuddyretard
---
He can't camp you if you DC. Survivor logic.
---
I never once mentioned that I would purchase it? So your argument holds no ground.
---
I do believe artists have the ability to charge however much they deem appropriate for an item(or artwork) that they made and put their own time into.
---
The government taxes are not made by artists, so again your argument holds no value here. And the government already charges tax/ has increased tax for reasons they don’t clearly state all the time. 
---
And taxes are not a “service” that is ignorant by itself.  They are a revenue for the government so the government can effectively run. Maybe you should educate a little more before making wild accusations that have no bases. 
---
Oh, and this is just a fucking game, not government.
---
Ah ok just asking cause the level of salt you got lol
---
I'll chime in. I feel individuals who spend 10 dollars on a cosmetic are part of what's wrong with the gaming industry. Part of what's killing it.
---
In no world should a cosmetic be 10 bucks. I'd argue cosmetics should be priced 1/2/3 based on rarity. They're non tangible textures that do nothing to enhance actual gameplay, for Christ's sake, and the more people buy these, the more game companies will keep pushing that envelope on how much they can charge with as minimal effort as necessary.
---
But then you break them faster which is hella useful.
---
Yes I'm pretty sure, but is it really worth charging extra or at least charging so much more that the outfit is not affordable with the ten dollar auric cell pack? 
---
I feel like there are games that would say, "hey this is a cool bonus gimmick that our players will think is cool" and the ones that say "We could use this gimmick to excuse us milking more money out of our players!" Sadly looks like BHVR chose the second route.
---
I wish
---
True enough I suppose.
---
So you say. My arguements are that its not fun to lose right at the very end of the match if you've been playing perfectly up till that point. NOED doesn't always come into play. You're all acting like im saying "nerf NOED, NOED OP, Survivors need to never deal with totems" But what im actually saying is Survivors get gens done way to fast. FORCE THEM to have to go after the totems. Because right now, no matter how many times I say it, people won't. No matter how much people whine about NOED, they won't. Even when I go out of my way to get totems, I won't find all 5, one will be hidden, and ill die, even though I did everything in my power to counter NOED. And thats not fun, its just frustrating. By forcing NOED to always exist, and thus forcing people to know its "Cleanse the totems or deal with the consequences", this allows NOED to keep slowing down the game, keep killing people who think finishing the last gen means they win, and keep punishing people for not doing totems. I don't understand why everyones acting like im some entitled survivor main. This would simply buff killers, while keeping NOED identical to how it works. It would allow more room for other perks, and feel less frustrating to die to as it is warned ahead of time of it being there, thus less people would feel cheated and stop playing. Where is the flaw in that?
---
I legit will never understand the greediness with cosmetics. I might consider many more skins if the prices were $3-5 but to make it $10 oh but wait, a scummy tactic of making it more than $10 like this?? Disgusting. Keep your lackluster cosmetics and your cancer causing business practices, and get nothing
---
it is and apparently they are on fire as well
---
If I take someone off the hook not realizing the killer was so close, I’ll make sure I’m the next one in chase or insta-hit and downed. Making sure they got away safely. I feel bad farming lol
---
wow you clearly havent played much
---
Depends on where you live I guess, US is very strict about it while in Europe its not that big of a deal aslong as the age gap isn't too big
---
i love this alexei template
---
When are we stopping the NOED rants? I keep seeing these kinds of posts.
---
bottom up
---
No like were both up, but the killer is closer than I thought when I unhooked you I’ll body block.
---
Shutup snowflake incel

This is so offensive towards people who actually struggle with addiction.

What a childish take.

Maybe the players should just escape instead of playing games once the gate is open and NOED won't matter

WHAT'S THE POINT? SHE GOT NO POINTS FOR IT.
---
Kiss my grits

I'd still put Leatherface a rank over Wraith.

She is the exact opposite of thicc
---
Came here and posted this as well. Thanks for the screen cap tho. Much better than my post. Just heads up for any devs seeing this, it doesnt happen every time but its been happening quite often. This all started right after the pig skins were released.
---
Great drawing! I just bought her too
---
All the evidence points to them setting the price, so that’s where conclusions should rest.  Especially since non liscenced cosmetics are overpriced as well
---
and all survivors can make use of adrenaline, even if they have DS, or Exhaustion.
---
lol
---
BHVR pulling mind games
---
How do you get them? When I looked the other week I could’ve sworn I needed to purchase coins
---
Sure thing, bud. You're doing great.
---
Money talks people. If the cosmetic prices bother you that much, speak with your wallet. You don't have to pay for anything.
---
I personally know I will not be buying it, no matter what the weapon sounds like.
---
Have you tried reinstalling the game?
---
Never you’ll see these daily then a post about survivor salt
---
&gt;Alma
---
Oh yeah, I honestly forget I have it til it happens. Its a mod that has Alma literally spawn in random places on the map for a little scare.
---
There won’t be a day where you will NOT see a post about NOED, it’s basically this subreddit lol
---
👏
---
Nice! Pig is a ton of fun
---
This recording got me tilted.
---
I'll take the entire stock please
---
This. I've seen people time and time again call this a "killer-sided" subreddit, when it's crawling with people who complain about NOED and such.
---
same person after being downed 45 seconds into the chase 
---
"I RAN HIM AROUND FOR LIKE 15 MINS WHAT WERE YOU GUYS DOING?!"
---
What now?
---
Yes, several times. Maybe I'll try again since they said they "fixed it"...
---
Does anyone know what causes the bug where you can't escape?
---
I've unluckily had it happen three times in the past week (more like past few days)
---
Escape cake, good items and add-ons, the whole mile. All gone. I have no hopes of it being fixed, but is there something in particular that causes it?
---
We have every special infected besides the witch but I vote to keep it David
---
I know! That 8k Deviousness is soooo satisfying to get too. As a wise man once said: Ambush Piggy is best Piggy
---
Frick
---
The games still unbalanced, bug ridden, and poorly optimized. At this point, the only people who play it really enjoy the gameplay and are willing to overlook the dumpster fire that is Dead by Daylight. But hey, if you come back at least you have a wide variety of overpriced skins you can waste your money on.
---
While DC's shouldn't be part of the game, period, having bad teammates is yet another risk that is meant to be in the solo survivor experience. It's like those people in horror movies who are too scared to do much of anything. People turning to SWF want reliability and information, two things this game definitely wasn't built for.
---
I will never understand why ppl say it. NOED does not activate when the gate is open it is active when the final gen pops so the killer can easily get 1 or two kills from it or even more if he slugs sometimes
---
Sounds like a prayer beads spirit thing to do
---
I believe so, my killer does the entire kicking animation.
---
 Touché. Unless they fix it I'm going to keep using it haha.
---
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it actually as an addiction. Just compulsively, or habitually and such. I didn’t mean to offend anyone actually struggling with a real addiction
---
That's irrelevant to my argument and I don't know why you're focusing on that. My point isn't about DS itself, but rather the uncertainty the killer has as to if a survivor has it or not. The same goes for the solo survivor experience. It is meant to have uncertainty and unreliability.
---
And he becomes less and less fun and he’s lost any identity to his power, it’s just not a fit for the character, they should keep the sprint and just do away with the deep wound thing, then make his clame to fame about blending in with survivors like everyone wants.
---
That is true. I still wouldn't call it cheating, especially since it's hard to ignore (which I did in the beginning when I noticed it for the first time.)
---
I know David being the witch is funnier, but what if Nurse was the witch instead? That way every special would be a killer, and witch wouldn't be the odd one out.
---
Reminds me of the soongegar meme
---
Still was classified as a rework
---
Are you sure about that last part?  Was it said anywhere?  Seems like an odd way to do business, but if BHVR said that's what they're doing, then  I guess that's what they're doing.
---
Imagine complaining that a killer tunnels and brings mori when you all choose the same skin.
---
That you weren't SWF is besides the point, and that you explain this as if it makes the killer wrong is laughable. He has no way of knowing that you aren't all together. From your decision to choose the same skins, it looks as though you are, so your attempts at painting yourself as innocent are pointless. If I was killer and I saw these antics I would bring mori too.
---
Seems like you and your fellow survivors went out of your way to be toxic. Don't cry when the killer isn't prepared to deal with that and brings what he can to wipe you out.
---
Don't get me wrong. I am a survivor main. I see killers face camping people unjustly all the time. A survivor is good at looping, and they get face camped just because they led the killer on a long chase. So I get that killers can absolutely be toxic and sensitive when they want to be. But this case is not one of those times. Everything the killer did was justified based on how you and your team presented itself.
---
You're not very bright are you?
---
The game currently doesn't not have dedicated servers so no you can't stay in the same lobby after a game. But I believe dedicated servers are on the PTB right now which means they should be coming with the next patch in about a week.
---
Best advice on Console don't talk trash because although They may start it* they will report what you say to get your account banned. Had this kid talk all this trash on my Nurse and then he got wrecked and couldn't take the trash talk and sent me a screen shot and report of him talking to his mom because he couldn't handle getting his ass handed to him when he took time to insult me.
---
one thing I am worried about is his snares since the devs are going to make loops shorter is he going to be able to just spam that and make it impossible to even loop. but since the shorter loops have not happened yet no one can say. not to mention the update has not been out yet so it is unfair to call him OP or not OP and we all should wait at least a month or two to make a decision about him
---
I HATE ALL YOU KILLERS WHO PAY FOR THE SPIRIT AND MEYERS AND SHIT WHO RUIN ANY FUN INVOLVED WITH PLAYING THIS GAME. FUCK YOU PAY TO WIN SHIT FUCKS AND COMMIT SUICIDE.
---
Oh, I see.
---
Wouldn't be too worried about Mista there.
---
No shit?  I thought it just did progress bad actions.
---
Rule 32 should be enforced
---
It really sucks. I liked the concept of legion, and I really tried loving their gameplay, but it’s so hard to. Sometimes it’s fun to move so fast and vault pallets, but the ability itself wastes so much valuable time. I see a lot of legions who don’t use the power at all, except MAYBE to sprint to a far away gen. Never use it to chase though, and it makes sense...
---
Because that's the jumpscare sound in Saw.
---
Well I misunderstood then, I don't play killer often. I always do full totems though and NOED is part of the game just like any other perk and it has a counter so I don't really see a problem with it.
---
Cool story bro 🤣
---
The only reason she is as low as she is is because a majority of the maps are really bad for her.
---
Nice that’s always fun especially if your a leatherface and they all message you calling you a camper lmao but yeah doing it as Myers is pretty cool
---
Yeah I was thinking the same thing
---
Hell yeah!
---
Thanks! Got a sweet snowball effect after they tried to distract while someone tried to pick up the one I downed
---
The clown is already a boomer tho
---
I only scream like that when it's myres. but how u/PonyHit screamed was so funny
---
Awesome very interesting thank you for the reply  everything I wanted to know
---
Yeah, I get that. The thing is though, I personally just dont find the price too expensive. There must be a large amount of people who feel the same way if they set the price as such. Surely they did the market research and found the current price to be what most people are willing to pay while maintaining a profit. 
---
The problem isn't me or anyone who finds this to be fair pricing. It is those who complain and hate the status quo then buy the cosmetics anyway.
---
As for not enhancing gameplay, I like that aspect. I get to enjoy something that makes my experience better without burdening anyone with pay2win bs. If you hate the current practices, then direct your anger at the industry and devs. You shouldn't expect people to stop buying stuff when they are satisfied with what they pay for and get mad because they won't fight with you.
---
Gen rush is real man. Couldn't waste much time with her.
---
Rank 20 killer
---
You’re welcome, if you do get back in the game I hope you have a good time.
---
WHY AM I GETTING 'COULD NOT CONNECT TO HOST' ERRORS AS SURVIVOR AND KILLER?? THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
---
Yeah. We all just stood there for a few seconds. I was just shaking my head sideways. The game didn’t take long to end after that but it was honestly super funny.
---
Niceee
---
Nope cuz im banned yay
---
Would have been great
---
What am I even reading.. have you ever played killer?
---
Eushhdjssnskkqjdj saw
---
Everything doesn't fucking load this piece of fucking shit phone with bad internet.

*Heavy Breathing*
---
As a survivor main, SURVIVORS CAN BE TOXIC TOO BUT I DON'T SEE YOU POINTING IT OUT
---
It autocorrected to two CC bruh,but she kinda thic
---
Sorry your not enjoying it anymore best regards
---
IS THERE ANY RESOURCE I CAN USE THAT GIVES MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS ON THE ADD-ONS? I'M SICK OF "SLIGHTLY" AND "MODERATELY," I WANT SOME SOLID PERCENTAGES OR NUMBERS
---
I stopped caring about it but I can understand why ppl do not like it cause it sorta has 3 effects 1 it slows the game since ppl will be looking for totems instead of doing gens. 2 the speed boost it gives you and 3 the instant down. not to mention there is like no need to even upgrade the perk I doubt ppl would complain much if you still needed to get it to tier 3 as that takes work.
---
Congrats, what you do?
---
As a wraith main I can attest to this
---
He was actually rank 11. He also got a 4k.
---
Same, had one person call it ugly.
---
They getting a fat mori if I see them again
---
I’d rather the people who dc get punished so it will be a better reason not to dc If you do a reward then people will just stop dc’ing get the reward then go back to dc’ing
---
considering the only reason why they do not ban ppl who are DCing because they cannot tell what was a DC and what was a game crash how could they ever do this
---
I just remind them to bring food while camping as like peak toxicity
---
Remember Amanda? She's back! In Pog form!
---
After dedicated servers. They would be able to see log data.
---
The remake is really bad, that’s why lol it doesn’t have the same feeling as the original, and it relies really heavily on the garbage tropes of recent horror film and the writing is so bad, and not even in a likeable way. I watched it because I love the original and the concept of harry warden but mannn it’s so bad.
---
I don’t think any characters are F right now, they still suck but legion, pig, and LF are at least E
---
Last time I ran No Mither I had a Meg following me around trying to heal me.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
No. They are getting punished. 
---
But i am talking about just alittle more extra stuff.
---
Yes, I agree, we SHOULD have a stranger things chapter with the killer being a demogorgon and the survivor being Hopper
---
I love running small game, especially if you get a trapper.
---
Absolutely beautiful cosplay and a great photo as well!  
---
I love it 🖤

Nurse actually is affected by flashlight. While a flashlight is being shined at her, she is unable to start charging blink. Watch this video towards the end of the power details it is gone over in depth. https://youtu.be/oEuq2tYYJyw
---
No, because people would take it as a challenge to bully the player to try to get them to DC
---
I wrote that wrong, what I meant is: when bill is released, you'll keep his perks on characters that you already have them, but on characters you do not have his perks or prestige'd, you won't be able to unlock it unless you unlock the teachable
---
I do not think ppl deserve anything for a basic thing like this honestly. unless I guess it is something cheesy like a shirt with a dc crossed out or something
---
This game has one of the most scumbag communities around. You will constantly get pricks like this telling you you're bad. Even when you 4k, you're apparently trash even though you wiped them out. You can never do anything right according to them.
---
The best thing to do is click that little arrow on post game chat. It closes it, and keeps it closed until you click it again.
---
You probably experienced one of SWF's huge problems, which is high level players being brought into low level games, because their friends are low level.
---
And if they decide to get abusive and issue death threats or swear at you, you can always report in post game. Just click on the option on the right of their name, and then add a screenshot of their abusive messages in the comments box. Despite what others say, BHVR does issue bans for this, so long as you have a screenshot included.
---
At any rate good luck, try not to let them ruin your experience with the game.
---
you’re saying that like you want some badge for being “toxic” and I’m not sure why??
---
That sounds like DCer talk to me?
---
No such thing exists.
---
What kind of stupid fucking logic is that
---
Agreed. Also lol at OP, most comments have 0 points because he's going along downvoting all the replies that call out his bullshit.
---
In my game, the survivors were gen rushing and only 1 gen was left so I couldn't waste much time with her. I just downed her then hooked her. I got all 4 of em hooked with 1 gen left to repair. It was a good come back I would say.
---
Higher Power may conflict with other perks that use the active ability button (unless it is only usable in a certain situation, like how Dead Hard can be used only when the user is hurt). It also allows chain Dead Hards/Sprint Bursts which is a big no imo. Here's my suggestion to make it simpler and more balanced :
---
Each time you perform an unhook, one/two/all negative status effects are removed. (*this does not applies to the **Exposed** status effect, when it is applied by a Killer's base power*)
---
So, rewarded for....? Not leaving? Sounds dumb tbh.
---
Alright I guess I’m going to watch stranger things now
---
I know lol. All killers are “affected” by flashlights. It was sarcasm because the players statement made it sound like you can’t blind a nurse while she’s picking somebody up
---
Happy cake day
---
We don't all sit on reddit all day
---
&gt; Actually, it does cost more.
---
He's not talking about whether or not it costs more. That's why he said you didn't get it.
---
&gt; not to mention the extra 5 euros you have to buy for the outfit.
---
This is the thing he explicitly was stating.
---
In my game there were 3 gens left. 2 people on hook, one dead and the other doing who knows what, I wasn’t worried they much
---
It depends on what you have in mind
---
Feel like I need to clarify that this isn't to complain about survivors, it's just a shitpost to make people laugh. Everyone can play the way they like, both killer and survivor!
---
I think people hate him because he’s boring to play against? Not coz he ignored pallets and windows. I hate legion, everyone I know hates legion, but not for that reason. Nurse has one ability that hardly affects the game, legion has two, one which is beautiful but mixed with one that’s so fucking annoying, pointless, and weak, he’s not good for the game. He needs a rework of his entire power, get rid of it, it’s trash, keep the idea but execute it differently.
---
Dayum man tht's brutal. Which Killer rank are you? I am 15.
---
I mean I just go after whoever I see
---
Save shards then. I get what you’re saying though. I really want Nea, and Feng! I like mobile so far! Controller support would be great, but it’s not needed I feel ( unless you’re playing killer)
---
I’m not bullying a baby killer it’s the games fault for resetting me back so far
---
That’s the dumbest argument I’ve ever heard. No offense but just because he realizes that people will just force others to dc does not make him a dc’er and me defending him does not make me a dcer
---
My bad misunderstood your post
---
1°
---
Before reset I was 10 but now I think I’m 14. I’ll have to check once I’m back from a break I’m on. But I don’t plan on going past rank 6. Heard that’s where people are really salty and I don’t feel like having to clear my messages every 10 minutes after a match
---
Tapp is the only 3P I have because I didnt think he would get cosmetics, I'm conflicted now because the new outfits actually look cool.
---
Ragequit like a little bitch.
---
Good part is im getting unbanned this friday
---
Yeah, it’s really annoying but I can still get into games
---
this is a very not good idea
---
Five blink nurse time
---
Like someone said earlier, learning how survivors move and the mindset is a good skill to have. 2 things I try to do are move parallel to where I think a survivor is going to run while strafing to get the best vantage point since killer fov is a weakness. The second is kinda cheese but If someone messes up a gen skill check i don't go directly to that gen and instead check the other nearby gens or pallet locations. Likely that they got spooked and dipped to a different gen than trying to stick to the one they were on unless they already know where you are.
---
That was actually my main inspiration for this drawing 😂
---
So 2018 myers
---
ON MY DEFENCE it was a swf team all with flashlights, decisive, unbreakable, adrenaline, exhaustion perks and someone got a lery's glasses and i played that game as a huntress
---
Can you please write me another journal on how that was scumbag behavior thanks
---
Done in by Dawn
---
I skipped the complaining stage because by the time I saw that the skins were out I already had my credit card in my hand lol
---
HAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHA THEY GOT FUCKED
---
Spiked Boots and Thompson’s Moonshine for Drift King Billy.
---
I never stopped running that perk.
---
I skipped the complaining stage because by the time I saw the skins were out I already had my credit card in my hand lol
---
I just bought the Plague, waiting for the game when they all bumrush a basement hook and I have corrupted purge.
---
That's the joke.
---
But You have to farm a Lot to get These together...
---
And i think and Hope No one will ever buy auric cells in mobile...
---
Not just totems, trapper and hag traps too.
---
The top of the list seems great, except i would push trapper a bit lower. I know people get into cat fights over the lower tiers so im not even gonna bother with those lol.
---
you guys made fun of me for it lmao
---
Im guessing its more because BeHaviour has to give a cut to the creators of saw
---
Thank you for this. It astounds me how people expect these things as a given.
---
Murdered by Moonlight
---
Bruh survivors make rules for us but get mad when we play survivor and win against them.. You'll call us "toxic" and tell us we have "sh*tty skills. Delete the game" anyway so why does it matter? This game is for fun, not for rage.
---
Really? I’ve always seen it as a survivor sided sub
---
Im surprised you got everyone down there before the DCs
---
idk if you know this but by the way you said 6 second timer you prob do not, Freddy can instant put you to sleep if he hits you so that 60 seconds really do not that matter that much
---
Because there are quite literally infinite’s with balanced. Long chases and lots of windows make it easy to break chase so the killer can’t bloodlust
---
Biker kate not gonna lie is pretty hor
---
I mean no being vocal about the issue is just as bad is buying it since you're just letting it happen. if you hate people complaining about it you can just hide the posts.
---
If that's what's keeping you from accepting his opinion, then take it from a guy who's run NOED 3 times and Bamboozle maybe 3-5 times; it's not a crutch perk. It's probably the least crutch perk this guy was running. Killers, especially low tier killers like Pig, need to rely on crutch perks to play well, as their perk choice matters much more then survivor perk choices. Trying to play Wraith when I didn't have Ruin made that very clear to me. And for killers who get looped around a lot, having at least Bamboozle, Brutal Strength, Enduring, Spirit Fury or Save the Best for Last is required. Bamboozle is the worst of these required perks for M1 killers.
---
See now i feel bad if im exploiting a bug. Im new to the game obviously lol
---
Because it's not toxic at all it is poking fun at campers at most but not being angry about it there is no point in getting mad at people who camp. But I still think you can have some lighthearted fun at the expense of people who active try to ruin the game for others
---
EVER SINCE RANK RESET, I'VE FELT THE MOST GODDAMN MENTALLY DISABLED I'VE EVER FELT PLAYING KILLER. IN ADDITION TO SURVS JUST BEING BETTER THAN ME NEAR CONSTANTLY, SOMETIMES THEY JUST GO IN SOME RANDOM DIRECTION, AND EVEN THOUGH I HAVE WHISPERS AND BLOODHOUND UP, AND I CAN *HEAR* THE PAIN GROANS, I CAN'T FIND THEM AGAIN AND I HAVE TO LEAVE KNOWING THEY'RE THERE BEFORE I LOSE EVEN MORE GENS AND HASTEN THE PACE TO THE INEVITABLE 0K 0 RANK PROGRESS EVERY MATCH. I'VE HIT SUCH A GODDAMN WALL, AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT OR HOW TO GET PAST IT, AND EVERY MATCH HAS BEEN EASY PICKING FOR THE SURVIVORS. I THINK IN THE 4 HOURS I PLAYED I GOT MAYBE *2* TOTAL KILLS. I CAN'T REALLY BLAME THE SURVS, THEY'RE MOSTLY FINE, THERE'S SURPRISNGLY LITTLE BM IN MY R18 MATCHES THEY JUST PLAY THE GAME, AND JOKE WHEN THEY CAN. IT JUST FEELS LIKE I'M LEGIT TOO STUPID TO PLAY THIS GAME, AND THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.
---
Huntress is too low
---
I'm basically a noob too but if there's one thing I've learned it's that if get unhooked in a basement you try to leave the basement asap.. like immediately. Since there's only one exit hiding or waiting rarely works in your favor. Or that's how it plays out for me.
---
I know, that’s why I put him there
---
her power ignores all defenses and counter plays survivors have , while those survivor perks can be powerful they dont break the game as much as the nurse alone
---
I’ve spent enough on console to know better lol. I should be able to link my account like fortnite mobile (my son plays that game). This is another alternative for people to play as well as another cash farm. It’s fine with me as long as it plays smooth, and I haven’t had to may problems.
---
Hag fits witch better
---
Let me guess that’s the ripoff game
---
Either nurse or (if you want to really meme it up) nea
---
Same fam
---
Amen brother
---
"it could be a shroud" - famous last words
---
Woah it’s pretty 
---
and sad
---
very sad
---
The fact that you feel the need to poke fun at all says a lot... also, in your first response to me, you said making a stupid unfunny comment about how someone plays is toxic yourself, but go off I guess
---
it is neither survivor or killer side per say honestly. just some days have more survivors and then other days have more killers
---
Ugh, every damn time. I tell myself "we're all gonna die" and then I get fucking mori'd
---
That works as a suggestion but it isn't a requirement.  They have the choice to message just like they have the choice to camp and tunnel.

---
Doing the Lord's work, I see
---
Oof I’m pretty new to the game and had no fucking clue I could close the hatch, thank you so much
---
Huh
---
I was amazed no one quit or just let the entity kill them. Very happy I got the picture
---
When i see 4 clauds that are obviously together i bring no add ons or offerings and just dc when the game starts lol
---
is that his name?
---
Huntress and Myers in C tier?
---
I have the plague as well and I am just terrible at her. I mostly play the hag and the hillbilly and just picked up Michael Myers two days ago
---
BM is BM.  One side is doing theirs in chat while the other does theirs in game.  What you're asking for is a free license to play as scummy as you want and guarantee not to have to deal with any salt afterwards.  That's not particularly realistic in the gaming community and you know it.  Play as scummy as you choose but realistically you cannot control it if a player chooses to message you so why complain about it. If you don't feel like you did anything wrong then you should be able to shake it off and ignore it anyways.
---
This is an amazing piece of art and really shows the raw emotion I feel when I don’t get any kills in a match with such an amazing killer. Plus I can hear her voice while looking at this lol
---
That’s why haddonfield is chosen. With balanced landing, there are some loops where it is literally impossible to catch the survivor, and even the ones where you can catch them take up at least a full gens worth of time
---
well it's your opinion. IMO he's entertaining, might not be an amazing player, but still good and entertaining.
---
I don't play huntress much and don't have her very leveled so I just picked something. I'm not sure
---
Ni🅱️🅱️a what
---
After giving it some thought, I think Spirit would actually be the best fit for Witch after Hag.
---
The problem with Hag being Witch is that Hag is already Jockey. The only other killer that could fit Jockey is Hillbilly, who is already Charger. And there is no other replacement for Charger. So Hag has to be Jockey. I think Spirit is now a better fit then Nurse because Spirit is really just an enraged victim. She never did anything wrong, she was just sent out the window and nearly killed by her father. The reason The Entity was able to take her in was her thirst for revenge against her father. Feels more in line with the Witch.
---
And trust me, my first thought was Hag too for Witch.
---
This is my second ever edit and if I knew how I would lol. Plus I just did this using a random software on my phone. I am trying to learn more about editing though.
---
Fair point and I honestly forgot about exhaustion when writing this. I think I'll keep the power how it is but I'll definitely add a prerequisite so it doesn't conflict like you said and probably make it not work with exhaustion. If that still seems unbalanced then your suggestion may be the way to go.
---
Reply-
---
Thanks for this thread guys, gave me great enjoyment reading through your replies. I got great enjoyment from GearbusrerX personally messaging me hate too. In conclusion I'm a 'Toxic' 'Scumbag' for playing as a character in the game and using an item in the game. And if you read my replies I clearly  'Painted myself as being innocent' saying we weren't a team and its hard to blind Nurse. I apologies for trying to have fun enjoying a video game and simply posting this in response to before the game.

Thanks guys, hope you enjoyed the thread too.
---
Sorry that was a “i food truck know that wow” “huh” not “huh??”
---
Yeah theres a youtube channel "ANGRYPUG NATION" that posts parts of his streams. (he's incredibly toxic).
---
Because one thing is a playstyle in a video game and one is stepping out of the video game and initiating with a real person. You can call it scummy if you want, but it’s a playstyle validated by the devs themselves, as there are perks that encourage camping and tunneling. It’s a video game. Get over yourself. But, hey, at least you’re outing yourself as someone who messages killers pissed off that they lost lol
---
I’ve been having the same issue. I tried for three hours and managed to only get two full games (I did get into a third, but it got cancelled).
---
in french too " vierge de fer" wich is a torture instrument
---
Cause of this kinda bullshit ranking is a damn challenge.
---
Rip dude I wish you luck in future trials 😔🙏 Also thank you! 💕
---
loved it.

Swf
---
THE GODDAMNED WIKI HAS SOME OF THE STATS! WHY THE FUCK THE ACTUAL GAME DOESN'T, WHO THE FUCK KNOWS!
---
She has a carved out, real, decapitated pig's head as a helmet. What.
---
As peak toxicity is what I said as in that is the most toxic I ever get I laugh at people that want none else to have fun and when have been camped to death really what else can you do?

I mean, I don't know how the licensing thing works, but wouldn't the devs have to pay more to get the license holders to let them add more skins? If that's the case, a higher price point makes absolute sense.
---
Re
---
and if you haven't unlocked Ruin on that character yet?
---
tbf I wouldn't go out of my way to put on extra things for them, I'd wanna beat them fair and square like any ordinary game - more satisfying unless they go on like a 'scumbag' on reddit, that would be more satisfying lol
---
Can confirm
---
You lose the right to complain about tunneling when literally everyone has the same skin. How the hell is the killers gonna tell the difference between who is who?
---
But are the scratch Mark's not revealing you?
---
Ok hear me out. Replace her mori with the nurses when you wear this.....harder mommy.
---
I regret nothing.
---
I'll buy it. After they fix the problem with DCing players.
---
Probably me
---
Excuse me, what the fuck?
---
I’ll reconsider life
---
Maybe the game should have it’s own unique account system that works with multiple platforms, cause cross play would just put consoles at a disadvantage.
---
Thx
---
You are a hero
---
The scratch marks only show if the player is running
---
You actually completely right there. Top tier killers are so popular because they have such a good map pressure without need to use perks like totem. So it's a crutch perk in a way, like NOED.
---
looks a lot like Hoffman, I hope the devs try and convince Lionsgate to get a skin for him one day
---
I love doing this with huntresses who seem to have a thing against M1ing
---
Haha u got sacrificed
---
nurse baseline isn't really that bad. it's when she has addons that the game quite literally becomes unwinnable. 
---
brown addon gives her a 3rd blink. that shit needs to be changed.
---
Mfw when I thought the old freddy was OP and now I'm scared to try the new one
---
you could, idk just a suggestion, you could not be a child and just move on? stop taking a video game so personally? lol
---
It's cause we put a lot of time and effort into looking our prettiest for the survivors &lt;3
---
Ehh I’m usually pretty good at seeing the blur of him coming, and if he decloaks behind the wall then it’s the same thing as ghost face but he can’t instadown.
---
Sometimes a crouched ghostface can be harder to spot than invisible wraith.
---
My first games were rough but I just got a 4 kill into a 3 kill so either luck or im getting better.
---
Still not entirely sure if I am using corrupted wells at the right time. I also heard her default perks are kinda... meh. So waiting to see what kind of perk builds I can do with other killer's perks.
---
now that I’ve seen this post I’ll make sure I will face camp every pallet-stun-teabag person I see
---
If a killer hooks me first, out of all the survivors. I fucked up. I don’t blame the game or its mechanics. Just because being camped is frustrating doesn’t mean its the games fault.  Dont get caught first. Observe your killer. Is he a camper? React.
---
It’s just a game, though. Why do you get so offended over how someone chooses to play? I’ve gotten shitty messages from people even when I played nice, so that’s not even the case. I just don’t see what anyone gains by sending a shitty message to someone when you can just queue into another game and move on with your life. It’s just childish.
---
NOED is fine because it's activation can be prevented, and once those point increases for dulls from the PTB make it to the live game there will no longer be any excuses to not cleanse them.
---
haha you can tell that the person who made this meme is European because they used that funny looking e instead of the dollar sign
---
Whoa! Thanks man!
---
For me, I’d go
---
Hillbilly
---
Hah
---
Wraith
---
Doctor
---
I feel like Hex: Ruin would be really helpful
---
Np, I wish more survivors were like you (including me)
---
R/the_fairfields dislikes that
---
Something mentioned again and again. Yet never acknowledged.
---
delete this
---
I main huntress in XBONE and for the most part I find she’s still fairly decent to use. Has the same weakness as she does on PC and I’d say since both me and the survivor are using joysticks to aim/move, the playing fields are relatively even. I can punish the same things PC players can punish just about as well too (Windows, pallets, running in a straight line, throwing over low cover)
---
I like his perks
---
I havent tried the nurse and i dont plan on it lol.
---
yep I’ve snapped
---
Oh so you did message me? For a post about a single game of dead by daylight to get to you that much you personally message them, some may call that scumbag behaviour. But I’m glad I shined your ego. Catch me in another thread and hopefully I’ll satisfy it again
---
Playing peekaboo with survivors on Ghost Face is just bliss.
---
I just played Meg with the name ''Harder Daddy'' and the first match i had was a instakill Myers, not even lying lmfao
---
Perfectly asymmetrical and balanced.
---
his screams are horrifying 😂
---
Billy Boi. I have had some good matches with Billy
---
WHY EVERY TIME I USE AN ITEM OR GOOD OFFERING ON SPECIFICALLY FENG I PLAY WITH BOTS WHO FARM ME AND A KILLER WHO TUNNELS???????? WHY ONLY FOR MY PRESTIGED SURVIVOR???????? I END UP WITH 1 GEN DONE AND I’M BEING CARRIED TO HOOK FOR MY LAST ONE??????? I JUST WANT TO PLAY FENG!!!!,!
---
Just remove the instadown and have it apply deep wound but then again I don’t know shot about balancing so
---
I think you're supposed to consider pipping up a win. The problem with that is the fact that no one that's played longer than a month really cares about rank anymore.
---
yes, at least according to the wiki.
---
I enjoy shitting on survivors who think they'll outrun my Evil Within III at the exit gate.
---
My boy needs better cosmetics imo
---
Thank you!
---
I don't know what that has to do with getting banned, I would think the opposite, in most consoles games the report button doesn't do shit.
---
Ik it’s crazy.
---
Patch notes: removed Herobrine
---
What is this "pip" you speak of?
---
Ballsy I like it!
---
I only bought drill :p
---
The most annoying thing is when you loop the killer for a good while, only to get downed and see your teammates at the complete opposite side of the map crouching
---
Even without corrupt purge. Plague and everybody in the basement = 4k
---
“Did I fucking stutter?”
---
trust me I've seen some weird giraffe neck this is normal good artist never think they're artwork is as good as it is
---
Add ons bae bae
---
Myers is my favorite, he start easy &amp; chilling, he get evil really really evil with each passing moment.
---
okay okay I was just kidding bro
---
Pretty sure I've seen this like last week or so.

That’s reassuring then, thanks! 😌💕

Myers don’t know how to tea bag but he knows how to kill
---
Yup I just got it too on PS4.
---
Tbh, I've been playing for a month on Xbox, main surv but I play killer too. Never experienced toxicity, the worst message I received was "you got outsmartd by a ten yers old" and I found it sooo cute lol I was actually happy for him.
---
I sent like 2/3 salty messages, for insidious LF, obe guy who asked us to farm and got 4k, i don't remember if I sent more. Writing with a joystick is too painful, most of messages I sent/received were full of love.
---
See I wanna agree. Because from a consumer perspective yeah, it adds nothing.
---
But also, it adds nothing. It's entirely optional, you lose out on nothing except cool guy points by not getting it. That couple with the fact that somebody has to put time and effort into making the new models and textures. And they're getting paid, so they need some way to make making skins cost effective. And I mean, yeah it's an intangible good. Once it's made they can sell an unlimited number of them so you could argue that the 1/2/3 dollar price point isn't an awful idea, in fact I've absolutely just persuaded myself more towards it lmao.
---
Thing is I can see both sides. As a consumer I absolutely want my hobbies to be more affordable, but also it takes time and money to create and provides no tangible advantage so the prices aren't super ridiculous.
---
I'm not sure where I stand on it in the end but I do think you're overlooking what it takes to make new skins.
---
But spirit and huntress have abilities that dominate chase, with hag you just trap the pallet and the survivor runs to another. Her ability does nothing for chase so on certain maps she can be looped for ages.
---
We need names.
---
Oh yes, you’re right
---
Play Nurse with Tinkerer, they love it.
---
We have a doctor, Hide or Die has a scientist. This isn't going to fit thematically or be original.
---
Oooooo, I'd tunnel you so hard bb
---
N O
---
HG is meta on hag?
---
Could you please elaborate? I’m not that great at killer and I don’t see how Freddy can do well.
---
Specially if it was Neon hair Nea with purple flash light, satisfying kill.
---
Not as much as you, sir.  Not as much as you.
---
Yes!
---
SWF
---
Please stop posting this.
---
haha I get it
---
Yeah it's been really bad today, I can't even create a Killer lobby without it telling me No Network Connection
---
So I’m not the only one who uses Third Seal Piggy
---
Knowing what you're teamates are doing is a massive help and I can definitely recommend bond empathy or other aura reading perks. Example: If everyone is on a generator and if a survivor is on a hook you should go save them or if nobody is on generator then you should be on one.
---
I have played this game for under a week and this is already how I feel, if the first thing I see isn't a gg or a legitimate comment I just leave the post game chat immediately. This is the same shit as playing Autosniper in CS:GO, whether it works or not is completely irrelevant, it only changes the thrash talk your enemies are going to dish out, as if it wasn't highly gimmicky and easily countered. If it works you are a noob for using it, and if it doesn't you are one for even trying.
---
Without fail, if you play against a SWF, if they win they are going to wait at the exit gates and teabag, then trashtalk you in post game chat, and if you win they are going to "accuse" you of tunneling etc. even though it is easily counterable if it actually happens. The first part is what I hate the most, because it forces me to waste my personal time even though I have already 100% lost, if I don't want to lose bloodpoints.
---
But this shit always happens in team games. The reason why you rarely get such toxicity from killers is because them winning or losing is only dependent on themselves. The moment people's success is dependent in part on others, they will immediately deflect all blame from themselves and place it on others. And the killer is just the easiest target. This is made worse by the fact that in dead by daylight, survivors don't feel like they have won unless they *personally* escaped, so if a killer camps or tunnels, that should be bad for him overall because the survivors, especially SWF, can just do the objectives meanwhile, but the fact that the *team* can counter it on the whole while they *personally* can't, negates that in their view. But that is the nature of an asymmetric game such as this where players can be forced out of the game.
---
So all in all, this is naturally going to happen because most people are shit persons. Nothing but harshly enforcing good behavior in chat is going to change that.
---
For an example of exactly this, just look at how toxic the League of Legends community is. Despite efforts by Riot to the contrary, the increasing team dependentness of the game, where it is increasingly hard to solo-carry, means that in that same vein people deflect all blame form themselves, because finding errors in the enemy and the own team is easier than finding them in yourself.
---
You tried
---
*DELIVER US*
---
Yes, they are slightly lower. Don't bother trying to pallet-blind them.
---
Misread this as Claudette Mori and was quite confused.

---
Hm... Or don't buy it? I mean, if you enjoy the game want to support Behavior give them the money but no one if forcing you to.
---
I like supporting the people that make content that brings me joy.
---
It's honestly one of most fun Hex perks you can use if you build stacks quickly, in between Devour Hope and Huntress' Lullaby. Sadly though every time I feel like taking it I go up against a 4 man SWF and they always know where they are with voice chat :/
---
But I play Claudette and urban away 😢
---
FUCK THE SWAMP IT’S SUCH A SHIT MAP IT SHOULDN’T BE IN THE GAME
---
Nurse can use her power right after a 3-5 second cool down. The survivor perks can only be used after they have not been in a chase for 30 seconds (minimum) due to exhaustion. If they were equivalent, nurse would only be able to land the first hit with a blink and would not be able to use it for 30 seconds.
---
Generators, Pallets, doors: [exist]
---
You guys: OML IT'S LIKE *BIDEO GAME*
---
***seriously, stop. There's 100+ posts like these***
---
I DC constantly and never get banned. I doubt you actually got banned on PS4 for that. Console doesn't really have bans.
---
As someone who plays the doctor a lot i can see that as the reaction i get from each game i play
---
You also forgot that survivors must keep blowing gens if at least 2 people are on them. Not to mention that if someone does manage to escape, they have to buy you 100$ worth of Auric cells. Otherwise great handbook!
---
Hello No Mitheran, we are here
---
Spirit is my fav girl. I loathe playing Nurse on console.
---
I literally made this meme. Can you link me right the original?
---
I prefer miss kitty
---
Look at u runnin small game!
---
My favorites to play are Legion, Amanda, Bubba, and Ghostface.
---
I love Legion's fast paced play style, running and chain hitting four survivors all in a row is such a great feeling. 
---
Amanda is great because the Reverse Bear Traps are awesome. I always play around making them as effective as possible. Getting a "Game Over" is one of the best feelings in the game.
---
Bubba is amazing. He's everything I wanted out of Billy. The area of effect chainsaw is beautiful, and bringing down multiple survivors with it is fantastic. Plus, one of the best Mori's in the game on Bubba.
---
Ghostface is amazing, I love his style of stealth, crouching and peaking out. Way more creepy than Myers in my opinion. Love it. Another awesome mori on him too.
---
I would be okay with it if it didn’t cause me to depip at higher ranks. 
---
But when you loop the killer for 3-4 gens and go down, even with the time and gens done, you have nothing else to show for it and the ranking system fucks you in the ass.
---
bro you're going to lose subscribers
---
Adrenaline for obvious reasons.
---
Prove thy self for faster gens and more BP(it’s very nice when you have teammates that can’t do hex skill checks so they gen tap)
---
And dead hard + balanced. I like running both because they’re both “activate on command” so you can choose which to use based on your map/situation. Even if you choose to use dead hard, you’ll still have the quick recovery from balanced. Even if you use balanced mostly that game, you’ll still have dead hard for when you get tunneled off hook
---
That is definitely more balanced than how it is now
---
Balanced landing : cause meta . Adrenalien : cause meta . Desisiv strike : i am a c*nt . Borrowed time : i just go for risky saves sometimes .
---
I have a strong feeling this is going to hot
---
Sorry just passionate no hard feelings your comment made me feel like you made a judgement too quick. Criticizing something I did actively think about avoiding stirred me. I kinda knew it was a little heavy handed and again sorry was a little much
---
Nah, she is really op even addon less. A killer that literally ignores pallets, windows, walls, floors shouldn't be in The game
---
Basically omegalul
---
You should change this to Salt plant but chernobly is fine too
---
So after reading through the majority of comments in here
---
...your mad that you used a part of the game and the killer also used a part of the game?
---
What is the purpose of the post?
---
Funny when I rarely get face camped now days. There are some benefits to getting rank 1.
---
More like posting anything on this sub. 
---
"I have a different opinion = downvote" 
---
"this wasn't a meme = downvote" 
---
"having a verified account on reddit = downvote"
---
I’m a Pig main and 100% never patrol hooks, only gens.
---
To be honest, if this perk doesn't remove Exhaustion, it becomes almost useless since this is the most common status effect.
---
The only other good synergie i can think of is removing the Broken effect from Delivrance.
---
It could remove the Mangled effect from Sloppy Butcher, the Exposed effect from Make Your Choice, or other effects caused by Killer add-ons, but that's only if the killer decide to run them and if you're not in a chase.
---
Also, it's important to point out that the perk should definitely not be able to remove effects from Killer's *base* power. (imagine denying a whole duration of T3 Myers, or Plague's corruption)
---
Myers is my favorite due to his fun play style and many different possible add on combinations(really change his play style).
---
I also like clown a lot for some reason.
---
On a sightly unrelated note I hate pig because I don’t think RNG should determine your escape (minus jumping off hooks)
---
I also don't mind if I looped them hard. It's even better tho when ur team finishes then gens and you get saved with BT and you have DS.
---
Adrenaline, dead hard, decisive strike, we'll make it.
---
I run adrenaline/Lithe, and the other two are a toss up.  
---
  
---
As someone who splits their time evenly, I know how frustrating it is and it's so nice to be on the other side
---
Myers. It’s so satisfying to successfully stalk someone and they don’t even notice
---
I mean. I’m not complete shit, I can 360, I can loop. I’m pretty sure Im not confident enough to counter his shit. Know what I’m sayin’?
---
Yea she Thicc but she not Jane T H I C C
---
Ohhhh, the other post is a follow up to this one...
---
Or they actually do the gens then you adrenaline out the gate on unhook
---
You can get them out if you aren't a complete dick. Just slow vault it while injured and they can grab you and escape.
---
Pig has a pig?
---
Seen this as well with the doctor, you could vault over the pallet and everything. He could still hit us and use his power but was stuck the entire game lmao
---
To each their own ig
---
I usually main killer but recently I’ve been splitting my time evenly. Honestly, while I do get mad if I get looped all game, I’m more mad at myself and applaud them for doing a good job. I don’t facecamp them unless the exit gates are powered, but rather just move on and pray I find survivors that are really bad to make up for the time I lost
---
it’s actually not the one she died in (she died in a burgundy/red t-shirt, the pants were pretty similar to the ones in the cosmetic) this outfit is from the first saw movie
---
Not on console at all. I would say shes lower than most on console imo. She may have a lot of map pressure, but the frames and sensitivity really fucks with her kit.
---
I only posted this once????
---
Nope. Happens to me too. Might be because the game is just dead on console tbh.
---
Adrenaline, Balanced, DS, Borrowed Time
---
*casually peaks the corner*
---
hahahaha I get it because dead by daylight is a game released in 2016 to mixed reviews
---
Coming from another post seems they finished all gens. Probably left him there for all we know.
---
but im lyk rlY guuD @ da GaeM xD
---
If you feel frustrated your are allowed to rant but I do disagree with some of your arguments I usually play killer and survivor evenly switching when I die or get brutal killer or lower. I believe you are in lower ranks and new to this game. By the way you say “Nea is the only one with good perks” assuming that you don’t have her teachables on other characters and that you deal with wraith campers. You probably just need to rise in the ranks. Teammates get better and killers like that are less frequent.
---
Im the same way. The only time Ive ever remember facecamping is when I was probably rank 15 or so just starting out and had my first encounter with a "toxic" nea lol.  
---
If I get looped real hard Ill usually just break off and hope I run into them later, hopefully in a more killer friendly loop
---
How often does Diversion actually come into play? 45 seconds just sounds long to me.
---
Killers wait time  is shorter.
---
It's easy to see if they have dream pallets if you don't see a dream snare also if you know a nap like the back of your hand that two
---
Very true, started playing ghostface recently and he’s just impossible to expose people against 4 mans
---
I’m not trying to be the killer though. Next!
---
it’s good because they are making money
---
Devs : what more do you want from us?
---
And Iridescent Head.
---
r/sbeve
---
That's not how this format works, but ok
---
You actually need to have friends to play SWF, try solo queuing.
---
It’s great cause they’re making money
---
Nurse. Because alot of people on console aren't ready for it lol
---
I just saved up shards. I bought adam last week
---
I want to do that too j get a lot of hate for playing killer. But I shouldn't have to close my account from people actually saying good job or something non toxic a game shouldn't push you to that decision
---
No, you have to choose which to use. However, balanced’s stagger duration reduction still works even if you’re in exhaustion. This staffer reduction is the main reason balanced is so good, because it turns some decent/impossible loops into godlike/good loops. So basically you can use dead hard for the panic button or balanced for the sprint burst depending on what situation you’re in, and have the stagger reduction for those powerful loops
---
Nah, I'd have the same problem with Hopper that I do with Ash and Bill
---
All three of them could throw down with at least ONE of the killers and come out on top
---
Idk for me I’m just not a fan of Mori’s used it once as killer(for daily) and felt like it made abit cheap to me. I hear it used to be on first down you could Mori right? Damn. I think it’d be cool if they added mori’s you can buy. Like multiple different animations however the ebony became a purple offering But you could only Mori 1 person after 1st hook and the other 3 after 2nd hook. Then have an iridescent Mori where you can grab and kill 1 survivor at any time after they’ve been hooked once. Abit like Myers
---
I really don't think a Rank 1 Dwight is the most dangerous man either. He literally just Dwighted harder than all the other Dwights
---
Bro where have you been?
---
What ranks are your friends?
---
No you are wrong they are balanced. What are you taking about.
---
when you see more than one TTV in your lobby
---
Indeed
---
Freddy for stealth and cool glove. Spirit for grabs and speed
---
I use the Scarecrow? Its a red flannel.
---
Ok tough guy
---
Spirit is a nice stealth killer.
---
Rule 125: Tunnel camping will result in endgame chat arrest, flashlight flickering, and butt dancing.
---
It it definetly isnt a good perk, but it's funny as hell when it works. Thats the only reason I actually use it
---
That's pretty impressive with what you had to start!
---
I play as fair and politely as I can but people will still be assholes to me over on PC in the chat and/or on my profile. Toxicity is unavoidable in any vs. type game, especially in one like this. People take it and deal with it their own ways and not everyone can really just "get over it" or "get thicker skin". Bad sports and how they talk can really get to people sometimes. 
---
I know well enough to laugh at things and just say gg and move on when I realize people are being shitty, but I'm speaking on behalf of people who may be more sensitive that enjoy the game but may feel discouraged from this mixed bag of a community. It's not that easy for em.
---
I'm a low tier warrior, my mains are Trapper, Huntress, and Freddy. 
---
So a little Mori equalizer is good jab if your dying for that pip at red ranks.
---
And yes indeed, back when we had actual infinites and a zillion pallets on each map, it only took a down to Mori someone, which was...not fair tbh lol but at the time it felt so justified.
---
And honestly the Iridescent ebonies probably don't need to be in the game, the greens are good enough imo
---
You get them for completing the tutorials 😂
---
Trapping pallets forces them to leave the loop. You don't want to chase people that aren't by your traps, just like you don't chase as huntress when you're out of hatchets.
---
Hag is still top tier, she just has to be played differently.

Kinda ugly
---
As a survivor main who recently started to play hunter. I’m straight up disgusted by the community. No matter what I do, i’m breaking an imaginary rule. No matter how far away from the hook I go, I’m camping. Starting to think people just have no sportsmanship anymore and everyone is a keyboard warrior.
---
want a corndog dwight
---
That’s a terrible idea if it’s a big map then it could be impossible for them to get there traps off if there unlucky
---
Low ranks 20~13 I fully agree with your statement. But 8~1 they won’t DC or struggle, maybe fewer will DC but not most of the game solid team mates.
---
BTW I play solo all the time
---
Hey buddy, that title is decidedly not groovy
---
Do you know if it's only for one movie? or have a clip as an example?
---
Yawn
---
I feel like if the did want a TWD Killer they'd go with Negan. He's their most popular villain. Even if he has had a change of heart as of recent.
---
Scrub*
---
it do be like that
---
I've only started playing like three weeks ago and I love the game.  I'm only ever buying DLC when it at least 50%, that's how I got the Halloween DLC and started playing.  I have my eye on Ghostface next.
---
The cosmetics seem to be the same price as some of the DLC so those will be last.
---
You wanted answers. Don't be a dick 🤷‍♂️
---
This guy definitely loves to kill
---
Like my NiK04 moeeeeee
---
Where do you get DBD shirts?
---
My chances of losing my virginity are F tier.
---
A disconnect is different tho
---
So long as people can actually play the game it's not toxic.
---
That's why early camping/tunneling and swf on comms who never let the killer find them are bad.
---
It's a troll account. He's been going to Killer-friendly posts just to flame people. It's weak-ass bait.
---
[removed]
---
Would it be fair if the legacy skins are only for the newer killers/survivors who didn't get one the first time legacy came out. Like not legacy skins can be unlocked for trapper again but legacy skins for clown or spirit
---
I play Survivors if i want to for dailies lol. Im a killer main.
---
Is there a way to delete other people's posts?
---
See ya in the fog!
---
Every Wednesday, as to what order I do not know
---
F
---
Why the fuck Freddy still low? I thought he would be at least B or A
---
;(
---
Well at least spirit is up there
---
I made someone salty enough to send hate nail and someone DC from the match 😂.  I love the piggie.
---
Imagine being buttmad enough to write out this whole bit or look up the copy pasta and try to pretend you’re nonchalant.
---
In Piccolo's case it's more like a can of dry spaghetti.
---
Noed is still a trash perk if you play against smart people.
---
Listen kids: If someone says “ggEZ baby killer” and you need a quote, unquote, safe space then you are not ready for the real world in any way. People do not give a dam about you or your feelings, learn to not worry about it, I promise I’m helping you more than Mr. Therapist here with his safe venting spaces.
---
Are you playing as Frank West?
---
That’s why I’m only rank 17. I got into this game by watching Monto
---
Thats kind of his whole thing. Drag people into basement then kill entire team when they come to save the hooked person.
---
Oh man it would be even better if they were playing Tapp
---
Lmao that killer would be me xD
---
I disagree with you though about purely low ranks. I hover between 1-7 during most of the season and it's just as bad up there as it is in lower ranks the only difference is that the killers are better.
---
They were. You can’t see it in the video but they kept running around me on hook and tbagging.
---
All toxic types too. Congrats!
---
Nice
---
I’m gonna be honest I’ve had leatherface games where before the game starts the team dc’s and then I get a message saying “we’re not gonna play against a basement camper” it’s annoying to survivors to fight him and killers like me who just enjoy his power more than Billy’s have to deal with rude people or dc’s but it’s just the appearance bubba has in the community right now sadly
---
Is it really a crutch when it is a necessity though?
---
Clown in D tier?
---
*laughs in borrowed time*
---
Cool then I’ll try playing her then, thanks
---
DC
---
I'd love that!!!
---
It's okay, if you're anything like me every single game you take Deliverance you will be tunneled out of the game before the first gen is even done :D
---
Well make it is already an extremely strong perk it doesn’t need a buff
---
Be patient with throwing at people running out in the open, and don’t raise the hatchet until you are ready to throw, that way you’re not stuck with it in your hand.
---
Only seems to happen to me when I try to switch from Killer to Survivor or vice versa
---
Just only have the last survivor alive be immune to gate kills and that's all I want
---
*chuckles in WGLF*
---
7777777777777777777777777
---
I disagree
---
I dead hard over trapper traps if I must. Sometimes he walks right into it so I get a giggle before I am inevitably downed.
---
You should obviously apply since you already have the solution.
---
She looks better with the butch haircut IMO
---
Awaken my masters
---
Looks who's shittin in the tall grass
---
Humans are naturally sensitive beings. Not everyone is thick skinned and can take it well (not saying that whining about it is a good idea)just trying to explain to you that it isn't really in people's control. Feelings are for the most part uncontrollable
---
I vote David for Tank.
---
Therapy is the equivalent of a safe space. And in case you didn't read what I said earlier, they can play with others who deal with it and it helps improve their headspace if they can't really cope on their own. Given everyone experiences emotions differently.
---
Your maturity and understanding for humans and their emotions shines very bright. Take care of yourself, tough guy ♡
---
Yeah i know once they see raise my hand they will start running in circles kinda like when i try chainsaw someone with billy , wish me luck
---
yeah I've done that 3 times now and it's an amazing feeling. Especially when they place them in a pallet so you can also throw the pallet down on them before you leave!
---
Flexing much
---
Best of luck :)
---
Yeah what the fuck is going on I just want to play some DBD
---
It's the thought that counts
---
But I also am saddened if the farmer dies with me because then the killer just got a second free potential kill. 
---
Personally, if I accidentally farm and have nothing to save the survivor with and I know body blocking won't work, then I just get out of there-- my Benevolence emblem is already fucked, lol. 
---
(^inb4 why farm when you know you can't save, sometimes I'm a dumb person)
---
Another reason why Amanda's traps are better.
---
It doesn't bother me that they verbally berate me. What bothers me is their entitlement to victory. The only thing anyone is entitled to in this world is death. If you lost, you lost, maybe they should get thicker skin if they're so bothered that they lost they feel the need to make someone else feel just as bad as them because their "rightful" victory did not come to fruition. I do wish you'd be more considerate towards the weaker minded however, you can't expect them to listen to what you say and take your "advice", if you won't consider what they say from their perspective. We're all just trying to have fun playing this game, for some people getting verbally attacked isn't fun, and by spreading awareness maybe the devs will do something about it.
---
You get the token
---
A crutch is necessary for someone with a broken leg.
---
It's where the term comes from, people who cannot function without a specific thing. It's mostly used as a negative, as needing to rely on something OP is often seen as a bad thing. But relying on a Crutch is not always bad, by definition a crutch is necessary.
---
Honestly when someone does this, I pretend I’m gonna go to the person they wanted to point out and them go after them. I then tell the guy that was pointed out not to rescue them for it by shaking my head
---
Is this what a killer sees when he/she enters a locker?
---
smug redditors always think copying what you say as a retort to you is such a sick burn. it doesnt work sweaty. get better material.
---
Try to run away to a different loop as soon as a I see them start to place it
---
Yes indeed, I've helped a killer like that, the poor thing was stuck I could'nt bear it. Most survivors don't care and I found that disgusting. We all are in the game to play together, having fun, and being human? I don't know? It's common sense.
---
Leave the loop area and go to the next one. Hag really relies on you triggering her traps or trapping you in a bad area with her trips. Therefore, move onto the next loop and keep her occupied.
---
This is situational, but I trigger traps when I see a teammate get hit. It may force her to switch targets or make her confused that her trap went off = takes a second to think = gives your teammate more time to get to the next loop. However, this is very situational and shouldn't be relied upon.
---
I HAD A GAME WITH A QUENTIN WHO WAS A PRETTY GOOD TEAM PLAYER BUT AT THE LAST SECOND HE DIDNT HELP WITH THE FINAL GEN WHICH CAUSED EVERYONE TO DIE
---
Most of the time , I bring the perk and only use it if the random teammates aren’t healing me . I always try to find someone to heal me first . 
---
I often bring medkits too but sometimes I’m on a shortage .
---
Ah thanks.
---
Nah it’s a taught thing homie, ever talked to anyone over the age of 50? They’ll call you a bitch to your face and won’t be hurt if you do it back, I see your point, but it is 100% taught to be sensitive nowadays.
---
Then who the fuck cares?
---
Infectious Fright! I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
I guess so
---
I just ignore or talk back. The angrier the more entertained I am
---
I leave, preferably the opposite direction I'm facing if I'm watching them place the trap so I can build up as much distance as possible. Idk if it's the best option, it's just my habit.
---
With the amount of Ghostface players due to him just being released, a lot of people have talked about how they hate playing against him. Give Spine Chill a try, it counters him completely
---
exactly like 60% of time you gonna get a bad map for her
---
Shhh focus on the meme
---
There is nothing the devs can do my dude, they aren’t being abused, getting told “ggEZ trash killer” is not abuse.
---
Definitely a must on Spirit, Nurse, and Myers too! Slugging couldn't be any more fun with Infectious Fright :)
---
The haste tho
---
I agree. Also the survivors have plenty of opportunity to get gens done super quick and escape. As a rank 1 killer main I lose constantly to swf teams with good communication because that's all there is in my rank.
---
Fortnite players but they got a 20000 dollar skin.
---
Tank should obviously be Dwight.
---
I shall provide thee with a trio of wisdom arcane to many Survivors, but known amongst the Sleepy Bois.
---
1.) Generators can be completed while Hex: Ruin is active. Repair generators instead of looking for the totem.
---
2.) Respect the Killer, but don't be afraid of them. They can only chase and hurt one Survivor at a time. Act accordingly.
---
3.) If you aren't being chased or in danger of being downed, work on generators, help your fellow Survivors, and cleanse totems.
---
Mmmmmmmm *That's Bait*
---
WHAT HAPPENED TO TELLTALE I LIKE THEYRE STUFF
---
Here’s the thing: if it were just the weapon I could understand. The problem is that the head and body pieces also have increased prices. So if you just wanted the mask or jacket you’d end up paying more as well for an ordinary cosmetic. Hell, if you just wanted the cool weapon you’d only need to buy a five dollar pack and you’d be saving money.
---
You gotta trick them into thinking you're bad. Nobody wants to go against a killer that's gonna obliterate their team in the first three minutes.( This is why some people will dc if they're downed first really early in the game) its the game within the game and this works on the survivor side too. if you play too well the killer might tunnel/ FC or dc because they can't  win.

If you’re hitting that low that means your doing something wrong, for example, staying way to close to a hooked survivor when no other survivors are around, you get penalized emblem points for that.

Me as meg: are you challeging me on a race, then in honest telling, i am speed!
---
I guess what I meant to say was the T-Bagging, I know by know when I’m being looped and distracting. I get a bit frustrated from it sure, but that’s why I back off and go after someone else. 
---
But yeah the T-bagging at the gate or after a failed pallet drop makes me just think “really?”. I don’t mind the point and follow emotes but why the T-bag, only makes me want to make sure that person doesn’t survive.
---
I don't get why it's very rare quality but each item costs 440 instead of 400.
---
i use twitch chat for dbd discussion now
---
That’s actually such a big bummer, their games were almost never lacking, any insight as to why? Just not popular enough or something? fuck man
---
The games of theirs that sold well we're walking dead. Batman, borderlands, guardians, GoT all were failures financially and critically.
---
Twitch chat? I didnt know you were a steamer? How have you been kind person?
---
I thought the killer could hear lockers open if they were close, even not a rushed action
---
KILL YOUR FRIENDS
---
This would never work because the killer would know your still done there if he only saw one of you guys come up.
---
Thats actually creepy
---
Tales from the Borderlands was good though, no one from that community would dare trash it, especially since it’s canon. But I have played most all of them and enjoyed em honestly, never realized how bad they did
---
It's legion's perk, so sounds about right.
---
oh no i don't stream. just interact with a few smaller streamer communities for my fix
---
been rather busy but good. yourself?
---
Yes.
---
To all the people complaining about the Pig skin prices:
---
Remember, BHVR paid a lot of money to make those skins. If they sold the skins at regular price, they'd be in a deficit. Besides, there's a good chance that they don't even get full profit from the skin sales on licensed characters. They probably have to fork over some of it to the license holders. You don't have to like it, but to call them greedy or demand a discount is unreasonable. 
---
BHVR already pretends they couldn't afford dedicated servers for 3 years. And that's with 2 paid games with paid DLCs and cosmetics. Now imagine the quality of DBD if BHVR *actually* didn't have cash.
---
A tier list where wraith is better than trapper :0. Ding Dong Boy getting some love.
---
Hence why I dodge lobbies if there’s more than one Claudette. Like how the fuck do you play this game so much you’ve prestiged three times and you’re still dogshit?? Their first instinct is still to insta crouch when the game starts, it’s infuriating. I won’t be de-pipping because my teammates are morons
---
Welcome to dead by daylight
---
This was one of my favs out of the nea submissions.
---
There has to be a downside
---
Wtf are Dwight Incels
---
Oh crap micheal have limit breaker already, oh no, he is talking in japanese limit noises
---
They oversaturated themselves with these bigass names. Fucking Batman? Minecraft? AND Guardians of Galaxy all in the same year? Yeah they were way to ambitious. They gave themselves no breathing room and had to rush out the games.
---
Meh....just another day in the world. Have you seen these killer concepts constantly be posted its crazy? Then everyone gets mad when critique how poor the design is.
---
When you press shuffle on spotify
---
They had an offering for swamp
---
Got a 4k
---
Ok fair enough, my apologies😂
---
Personally this game is way more toxic than CoD ever was. I might not be getting called racial slurs but the amount of people going out of their way to fuck with you on DbDis sad
---
Nah, just a person who knows how going bankrupt works.
---
Not a bad idea, I play on console and there was recently a 40% off sale so I was able to pick up 7 characters for like 18$ and have some left over.
---
I figured you’d get 4 DC

i dont think he was 100% honest

Yep, that's it, I think

---
Check out noob3. He’s got good stuff you’ll like.
---
Don't forget bear traps. There are drops on certain maps you can't see over and Small Game has saved me more than once when trying to proc Balanced Landing.
---
Give the survivors more pallets and take away the god/super safe loops. That way it takes more knowledge to know how to play a tile.
---
They are under powered
---
I watch his videos too
---
Holy shit this is... uh yeah interesting.
---
I HAVE HUNDREDS OF HOURS INTO THIS GAME. I LITERALLY DID NOT KNOW IT HAD A TUTORIAL UNTIL I SAW IT MENTIONED ON REDDIT. STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET TO IT. ACTUALLY KINDA RECALL BEING SURPRISED WHEN I FIRST GOT THE GAME AND THERE WAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER, JUST STRAIGHT INTO THE DEEP END OF LIVE RANKED MATCHES.
---
I was gonna do the big text thing but I have no idea how to lmao
---
Ye knw wht I mean
---
I hope Freddy doesn’t get any sunburn.
---
... oh, wait.
---
But a non noed buff so killers get more time
---
I don't understand how people get looped this long.
---
After I break 2 pallets without a hit I just patrol gens, 9/10 times I catch new survivor unawares an either get a free hit or get to break a free pallet. I don't commit to a chase until I know many pallets are gone or I know it's going to be an easy down due to lack of pallets in a certain area.
---
Discordance is a life saver as well. Nothing better then breaking mid chase to get a free hit on one or more people because they thought they were safe because someone else was being chased.
---
Me too buddy
---
I don’t think they need more pallets on most maps, otherwise you wouldn’t have to loop you could just keep dropping them all. Just replace some of the best loops in the game with regular loops or nerf those amazing loops
---
I want Doctor to work. I wish for a day where zappy boy is free to roam the wilds.
---
I wish for the day when his power isnt countered by stairs or rank 2 madness slows gen speed.
---
The dream.
---
Ghostface. Being a sneaky boi is fun, I love being able to insta-down people, free Thrilling Tremors, and if I'm feeling particularly toxic or the survivors t-bag me, I can ALSO do it!
---
Remember that clones of ash don’t count. If you ask me the entity made a fake ask so she could get a bit more hope juice outa her snaccs.
---
“Yeah there’s another good year in this one, just add an ash and you’d be surprised what people start thinking they can survive.”
---
EVERY TIME I SEE THIS I REPORT IT AS AN EXPLOIT. USUALLY IT'S SWF CHEATERS. SOMETIMES I THINK IT'S JUST A SHITTY RANKING ALGORITHM. EITHER WAY, WE ALL NEED TO REPORT EVERY MATCH SO BHVR GETS SO SICK OF THE COMPLAINTS THEY ACTUALLY BOTHER TO DO SOMETHING.
---
True tho

Baby Dwight 🥺
---
Oh noooo, I suck at nurse
---

Oh god, More Fengs

Dude what the fucking fuck.

lol, i know right there are so many fucking tards in this comment section getting mad at me for my O P I N I O N, and a fucking dead by daylight S H I T P O S T, like fucking how and why?
---
Welp you were right idk why I expected for there to be a 15th freddy movie it just turned out to be an extremely good cosplay
---
Glenn as a survivor with Negan as his killer. Let's get the feels going again.
---
He can only carry one of us at a time
---
qNo thats doing the objective lmao. Git gud
---
What else do you expect survivors to do? Ur simply bad at this game lol
---
Legion and doc. doc because i’ve always loved shock like powers and legion because stabby stabby
---
KILLER CANNOT TELL IF YOU HAVE ADD-ONS (E.G., AN INSTAHEAL), ONLY YOUR ITEM.
---
Yeah I meant add more semi safe stuff instead of what we have currently. Where you have to know killer distance and how to manage loops.
---
LIAR!
---
This is probably the worst quality I’ve seen in a picture since 2004
---
Nooooo no no no. Rank 1 killers complain more and rightly so. There are loops in the game that require no skill or mind games. In a game that tries to make killers scary, it is the survivors who have  all the power and all the stress is on the killer for the full game
---
Oof feelsbadman
---
You sadly get a token.
---
Sadly, cuz you probably still killed this guy
---
Lol
---
WELL I’LL JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP THEN
---
nah shirtless jeff
---
That child has done America a great service.
---
akward sibling hug?
---
I do from time to time if they act friendly first, every time I try to signal a killer they just kill me tho...  whoda thunk honestly
---
It does not pause may have been a visual error
---
I’m assuming my killer tier list would look similar if I also randomly assigned killers to tiers

---
I don't like playing against Claudettes because they blend into everything, even things you wouldn't expect them to. That brown jacket is something my eyes slide by way too easily if it doesn't exactly match what they're nearby.
---
I even missed one just behind the hook cleansing my hex totem after BBQ&amp;C didn't show anyone while spinning around trying to figure out where the other survivors were, then they managed to reach the hook I was near and save the person and vanish again while I was like...
---
Anyway I won't dodge two Claudettes, I might dodge four, but two is worth attempting (especially considering queue times).
---
Actually most of the time I just ready up even if it's three or four now because of queue time. I don't mind Claudettes on most maps because BBQ&amp;C is still a thing and they can't immerse when on a generator, but there are certain exceptions (and even on "okay" maps, certain tiles are still horrible to spot her against).
---
Well yes but actually no being good at the game is apparently “toxic” to most survivors (this is coming from a survivor main) but that’s mostly because they don’t really understand what it means to tunnel
---
Well yes, but that’s a different issue. Killers complain about the loops themselves and game design, not the fact that the survivors use those loops. As a killer main I’m damn annoyed by those loops but that’s not gonna stop me from using them when I play survivor
---
Seems like it did, I had my timer almost about to pop and I was able to still complete a search when I should have been dead.
---
i can't have a "wrong opinion" because no opinions are wrong, nor right, that's the textbook definition of an opinion dude.
---
Even the killers got they muthaf*ckin thang loaded.
---
Also every killer I seem to dominate greatly is legion
---
Inb4 "you're supposed to throw the game and only chase the farmer!"
---
Nope, I'll slug you first, then chase your dishonorable teammate. We don't want them to get that XP, do we?
---
This isn’t toxic tbh
---
That’s actually very well played. I as a killer would be a little agitated and think well shit this guys good lol.
---
Is the killers worst nightmare the screenshot button?
---
Leatherface, you a busta!
---
calling people, quote; "petty ass faggots" isn't helping your case bud
---
Agreed
---
As a KREUG main, People are exaggerating the release of this Freddy, I really felt that old Freddy took hella skill especially at rank one. The snares need a buff the pallets are okay but once people get use to him he will be mid tier. I'm hoping for the best
---
TO BE FAIR, MOST PLAYERS WHO USE DELIVERANCE DO IT WHEN THE KILLER IS STILL TOO CLOSE. ALSO YOU CAN'T HEAL AT ALL, IT'S INCREDIBLY FREE TO SMACK YOU BACK DOWN.
---
Nope. Survivors just say that every thing you do is toxic. Just do what you do and ignore them
---
“You picked the wrong house foo”
---
The point is, don't buy them if you don't like them. That's what OP is saying. What are you talking about when you say people are going to buy them and show them it's okay? Just don't fucking buy it. Money talks my guy, and if they see people aren't buying it, they won't pull this shit again.
---
He looks like Casey Neistat
---
Almost every time, unless everyone was awful lol.
---
Ey ey it’s me Carl
---
If you buy the licensed skins, they'll negotiate with more license holders and make more of them. That's how I see it at least.
---
True but also one time I looped a legion so much they ignored me (not the one in the video) probably because I mostly play with my rank 20-15 friends
---
SO SICK OF SURVIVOR MAINS WHINING EVERYTIME A KILLER USES ANY MECHANIC IN THE GAME THAT HELPS THEM. IT'S A COMPETITIVE GAME. IT'S LITERALLY THE KILLER'S JOB TO STOP YOU FROM ESCAPING. IF YOU CAN'T HAVE FUN UNLESS THE KILLER THROWS THE GAME, YOU'RE PLAYING THE WRONG GODDAMN GAME.
---
I would do the same and why do people complain about tunnelling?
---
i never said anything about leatherface, and if we do want to talk about him, if used correctly he is an insanely good killer who can get 4ks quickly and easily, and his chainsaw is perfectly fine and a little too powerful in some situations where hillbilly's chainsaw wouldn't cut it. and i'm not underestimating the pig i just don't really think she's viable, and that's my O P I N I O N. If we're being honest here, her traps are usually a one trick 1 or 2 time use thing that is easily countered in so many ways, and her crouch is pretty useless aswell. but if you love pig so much, that's your opinion.
---
Ok mr sensitive
---
it's my opinion, i just don't think she's viable in the chase or in main gameplay.
---
agreed
---
Revised
---
i can kinda see what you mean, then again, not really, but that's just my opinion, and apparently it's so hard for people here to understand what an opinion is lmao
---
what the hell happened here and why is there so much text help
---
Yea but if only one leaves he knows your still down there and he’s gonna go for the easy kill instead of the chase
---
Thats fair
---
THE GREATEST YEET
---
Ash has the daddy charm though
---
yeah, he has some small advantages but like pig their powers are almost useless in the chase and in main game, but both of them have a M E H -ish advantage at loops if they have the right add-ons
---
happened to me a few days ago. everything loaded except dbd. i just didnt play and the next day it was working fine
---
My karma
---
shittiest\* and it shouldn't be shitty/wrong/ because it's an opinion and i'm just saying leatherface can be very viable if used correctly, which most people don't know how to do, which is why so many people rank him low. and the traps only help a \*slight\* bit unless you have the right add-ons and it can be easily countered, and if a killer has to have red and purple add-ons to be viable then they're not that good.
---
I wanna know more about Rin's life. Clearly her family had issues if her father's first reaction to losing his job was to kill them both and then himself.
---
If you're really that crap that only looping saves you from the killer then you really need to get good. There's plenty of ways to avoid a killer other than looping.
---
ALLOW MORE COSMETICS TO BE BOUGHT WITH SHARDS
---
Ahahaha thats the funniest thing i have heard. would u like me to crouch around the edges of the map to avoid the killer?
---
No it isn't are you really that bad? Have fun with your looping while it lasts because the devs are going to make it harder lmfao
---
The only time Myer’s expression ever changed was when he beat someone in a stalk-off
---
Here we see the killer without a headset in their natural habitat
---
That frank west skin too...
---
WHY CANT I SIMPLY ENJOY PLAYING KILLER, IT'S SO FUCKING STRESSFUL IT AFFECTS MY PHYSICAL HEALTH I JUST WANT TO KILL PEOPLE MAN.
---
That just made me day lmao
---
lol looping makes me bad???? Get out of here. If theres no looping, killers will get a 4k every game which i feel is something you want.
---
The game can be a pain but it's got a lot of safe pallets and places to hide. Shelter woods is much worse imo.
---
nice ardetha addition
---
OK if its available with shards on mobile then yeah thats BS. but movie or not, everything about Pig/Tapp has to go through the license, at least I'm pretty sure haha.
---
What's insane about that? Morons pay 20 bucks for skins on fortnite... Still. 15 is to much for you? I paid 25 bucks for both pig skins and when I have an extra 25 bucks again, which will be soon, I'm buying tapps outfits. There's nothing insane about spending money on something you like or enjoy.
---
Lithe - Windows already suck for killers, let's make it worse  
---
Adrenaline - well.. y'know dirty meg main  
---
Streetwise - Looping with flashlight? check.  Genrushing? check.  Useful almost always.  
---
Final perk changes the most;  
---
Bond - When I'm playing bold I'll bring bond so i don't screw over nearby teammates, or if i need a ball afterward.  
---
Prove Thyself - good for genrushing  
---
Quick n Quiet - I can waste Lithe whenever and not be noticed (stealth)  
---
We're Gonna Live Forever - Point hoaring/altruistic play
---
You saw that too I see
---
You can vault, quick turn, flashlight, use perks centred around chase, team distract, trick them, use items to disrupt chase like ffs get good.
---
I mean, you can cancel the throw. Sometimes just the threat of throwing is enough.
---
I agree, this was just meant for the people complaining that shards are an option for the new stuff :)
---
obvioualy not, but there are certain things that make it completly unfair on one side
---
Yeah I'm not a fan of it being $15 either haha
---
Her drill makes noises, thats probably why it costs 100 more cells. They charge you for everything
---
Pull the trigger piglet
---
Yea I was just speaking plainly in terms of approaching the character from a new perspective. Zoning with the hatchet, and using it to deny more frustrating loops is more complicated and in depth.
---
i just relized your name, wtf
---
No you're just a whiny survivor that would rather whine than actually get skilled. Plenty of survivors beat the killer without looping because they're actually ya know good at the game..
---
As the killer I don’t mind the emotes, just the t-bagging. Every time I am playing survivor and do a follow emote I die lol.
---
How?
---
I’m not saying that it hasn’t happened to you, but my party hat has 100% popped while searching a jigsaw box. I saved the video since I died in the last second of searching.
---
The leather jacket is from the new jigsaw movie. Amanda never wore a leather jacket but the “pig” in jigsaw did wear one at one time. Not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn’t seen it. That’s just my guess tho.
---
I dissagree, a nurse without addons is still overly powerful and can still ignore any method of escape survivors have.
---
Sucks it doesn't work when you down, costed me a lot of hatches.
---
Yeah I regret the name, I wish I could change it
---
While this is true in a sense, Op is still a bit of a goober.
---
How long ago was it?  Because I always thought you popped while searching but I was watching my little brother play recently and his wouldnt go.  We were both suprised so ours mightve just glitched or something
---
Yeah but then it would just eat away at your distortions before you got that far
---
Lol ur sooo delusional. You know nothing about my skill in the game and assume that im a survivor main. I should just run in a straight line, vault windows and throw down pallets instantly so you can get your kill easier.
---
I've been sitting here for half an hour now trying to to solo survivor.  Game keeps telling me my internet is down, but it's not.  Tried restarting...same thing.  
---
It was doing this earlier today and now it seems I can't play at all.
---
A goofy goober to be exact
---
TOXIC LOOPER LMFAO
---
It was only free on PS Plus for a month. 
---
You still have to pay a subscription for Game Pass and I’m pretty sure if you stop paying for the pass, you lose access to the game. If you want it forever, you have to spend $20-30 for the game. A skin should not cost over $7 in a game that already costs $20-30. Many people (including me) love the skins but don’t want to pay $15 or even $10 for them.
---
easy dc
---
They can actually. You can have the opinion that sharks are water squirrels,  or that the air is 90% cotton candy, or that Nea killer memes aren't funny. See none of those are correct, but you can still think that way.
---
Bamboozle is a really good perk
---
shitting your pants over someone's opinion doesn't make it wrong. goodbye.
---
but i already paid for the killer
---
When somebody has ".ttv" after their name.
---
nurse, spirit, and billy all being F or lower is actually ascended
---
It is serious issue. Just watch Jim sterling video "the addictive cost of predatory monetization". It's serious, just because you are not addictive and have money, doesn't mean other people aren't suffering. Some will spend those 15 euros on skins, instead of buying food for a day, and starve themselves just to have those skins.
---
Haha wasn’t expecting that twist on *what are you gonna do? Stab me?
---
Looks like a new player MM. Grats about making a post belittling someone.
---
the daily glitch is posted to this sub daily, pun intended, to the point where it's just spam. we get it, there's a bug with some dailies.
---
that feels a little op to me imo
---
it looks really nice! and I’m happy it wasn’t an invisible jokes for cheap karma
---
I know survivors hate the docs mechanics but generally I find them to be pretty chill blood point farmers just looking to zap people into seeing clones and fake pallets.
---
I want the ‘don’t mess with Jane’ one so bad :(
---
Unless you have a FULL SWF team, 1 or 2 people focusing on all totems is a waste of time because it causes major productivity loss. It's also a bad argument to play round a mabye, because then it's just luck, not skill.
---
I'm not exactly sure. Half of the sub is bitching about the cosmetics costing them more than their parents want to spend or give them and the other half expect all the cosmetics in the game to only cost shards or something. Not sure exactly. It fluctuates depending on the time and time zone from what I've noticed.
---
Bruh for real, what the hell was that little kid at 34 seconds, it's on the left of the running David/Witch. That shit scares me
---
sounds fun
---
Mine always cap off with killing me so not fun.
---
Best strat. Pro tip I use: if you see someone new during a chase start chasing that one.
---
Temptation got the best of me and I did get it lol, plus I dont have clown anyways so it makes my life easier. Still have 2000 shards left anyways so..
---
Every now and then but I can reconnect right back
---
Sounded to me like they are a survivor dodging Claudettes, not a killer.

It’s a different experience, and I love playing with it every once in a while
---
Ah, so this is what happens when you start juggling them
---
I mean it's not toxic, if anything you were just kinda lucky you were able to heal that much up to that point, from there it was pretty normal
---
deaf spirit
---
I love that her hair almost looks like horns
---
They do enhance gameplay. Imagine if we had only one survivor and it would be generic white dude called Tom Smith with only one skin, some track pants and white T-shirt. Do you think still as many people would play this game?
---
Many people play DBD just to play dressup, looked at people druling all over new Kate skin.
---
Yes, except there isn't a single loop in the whole game (including unsafe loops) where bolting away would be worse idea than waiting for killer to break the pallet.
---
Yeah also how Ash is a licensed character and both of his skins are still 1080 auric cells
---
Silly me, you are right! I will update the guide as soon as possible!
---
Pfffffft
---
Projectile aimbot????
---
I mean, you make it abundantly clear you're not seeking a discussion when you start with "And don't even dare mention the way to completely nullify the perk because it inconveniences me from finishing gens in 5-6 minutes!"
---
But hey, I'll play along. As of right now Totem spawns are still piss easy to track, not even cleanse. If you really can't be arsed to spend 15 seconds clearing a totem then just mentally note where it is. Then as the game plays out, you have the option of cleansing problematic totems. 
---
This is of course if you even care about countering NOED. If all you want to do is bust 5 gens ASAP and GTFO then keep doing that.  
---
But it's apparent you just want to whine considering in my initial comment I tried to point out that neither side is winning/losing until the last survivor is dead/escaped.  You're still stuck in the mindset of "We fixed 5 gens, I deserve to win now".
---
And of course in the end, you're not going to win every game. And neither is the killer.
---
But I tell you what, you keep getting frustrated over how a complete stranger plays the game and why they're using perks you don't approve of, and I'll just keep playing DbD without pretending I can control what others do.
---
Shit if trapper baseline was 120% mms would there be a reason to give him a power lol. 
---
This mans definitely crazy lol.
---
Look I don’t play Xbox. I just know it’s there.
---
Shoutout to my French survivors that get the hidden message
---
While the other new outfit is better *IMO* 
---
Amanda still waifu :3
---
#Hashtag in front I think
---
He's free too. Along with the skins for Dwight, Meg, Jake, Claudette.
---
RANK RESETS ARE DUMB. GAME IS UNPLAYABLE UNTIL THE CRAZY GOOD KILLERS RANK UP AGAIN.
---
I’ll take 2 Gens.
---
I’m grateful at least if they are working on gens.
---
Yeah, fuck that emblem.
---
Hashtag (#) in front of your text

#Example text
---
It’s the outfit that comes with the drill.
---
Guess they just ideas from that. Idk. I remember what part your talking about. Since the pig in DBD is Amanda guess they just gave her the clothes she was wearing.
---
u sound stressed, be calm my dude.
---
That explains why I couldn’t buy the second after my great math told me I could.
---
The killer mains are complaining in the comments...
---
Both of them.
---
Man this would make killers double back all the time if this was a meta perk which makes the killer lose time. 
---
I don’t know messing with Regressing generator sounds doesn’t seem right. I really don’t like it.
---
When you didn't know this joke was taken literally, in a place where the joke is normally meant to mean something absurd, we expected more
---
A lot of killers cry because survivors are trying to survive,
---
yeah but thats pretty obv and you should slug then.
---
how you gonna kill him with a boner
---
Back in my early days of playing the game, this actually happened to me. Big brain Meg main farmed me but seemed to realize that she fucked up bad and flashlighted the killer when he was picking me up for me and she bodyblocked for me on the way out. Never before have I have gone from being angry to having pure gratutide for someone in seconds before.
---
Gideons meat plant map is a mix of both saw 1 and 3 as well if you haven't noticed.
---
I only get it when playing as killer, so now I only play survivor. It happens like 80% of the time when I create a lobby, and around 25% of the time in a match. There's no worse feeling than getting disconnected when you're about to 4k, so now you lose all your BP, offering, add-ons, and you lose two pips.
---
"I paid $20 bucks for this game all skins should be free from now on, screw artists working hard making these models and supporting the lively hood of game"
---
~everyone mad about the extra price on pig skins.
---
It's a licenced killer and people forget even devs have to pay royalties. In return for the extra money you get a fucking animated drill skin with included sounds, wtf are people bitching about.
---
Nea
---
I noticed saw one stuff. I don’t remember 3 that much to notice anything in the actual map that gave it away. Like the bathroom in 1 you know it’s in the map. But I don’t really remember any scene from the 3rd that jumps out like “oh yea that’s from saw 3”. But good to know lol. The more ya know right?
---
*Clicks a flashlight once*
---
Depending on the person you either 1. Severely hurt yourself by continuing to chase him or 2. The guy actually sucks and is just cocky for no reason which makes you satisfied. 
---
Theirs a third option but this option usually happens when you have a bad night and you’re done with the cocky dude. 3. You finally get him for your satisfaction and you camp him to Death satisfying yourself and not caring about ranks or pips.
---
But many more survivors seem cry because killers are trying to kill them.
---
Ahh well it is a thing but it isn’t Xbox live which you have to pay for to play online. The game pass is its own thing you have to pay for but lose the games if you stop paying
---
Disconnect the second you see the survivor working with the killer to be rude. It’ll save a lot of stress! Trust me!
---
Definitely a good purchase man. I've legit been waiting for it to appear in the shrine. It's a must have perk for some very powerful killer builds
---
what's annoying is when people try to make Ash basically a Mary Sue and that's hella cringe, he has flaws too so let him be that way
---
Both sides are, technically, toxic. But 95% of them are survivors. It's already a 4v1 game yet escaping or even a pallet drop without a stun and it's like they just won the damn lottery. And I play survivor most of the time.
---
If your chaseing often as freddy your playing him wrong.
---
Yea. I’m not a Xbox person. Just saw them promoting it awhile back that DBD was in the game pass. Feels bad since psn got it for free for a month.
---
Thank the sodding entity it’s not just me
---
I was always under the impression, prior to official release, that it was supposed to be Hoffman but it's been a while since I've binged the films.
---
They did make Claudette's brown outfit a bit brighter recently. Not a huge difference but it is noticeable.
---
Wait how does someone have a gun?
---
It seems like it is looking for world domination the more it feeds and the more it pulls people in the more of our world gets taken by it sounds like its slowly consuming the world to me
---
He's incompetent at about everything besides fighting and mechanics.
---
r/oinker_s
---
BRO, I'VE BEEN THERE. I'VE BEEN SO SALTY AFTER CERTAIN MATCHES THAT I CAN BARELY SEE STRAIGHT. ASSHOLES WHO GO INTO POSTGAME CHAT TRYING TO RUB SALT IN THE WOUND DON'T HELP.
---
BUT THEN I REMEMBER IT'S JUST A GAME I PLAY FOR FUN. USUALLY I FIND WHEN I HAVE A FEW MATCHES IN A ROW NOT GO MY WAY I'M TRYING WAY TOO HARD TO PLAY PERFECT AND JUST SWEATING ALL OVER MYSELF.
---
SO I CHANGE UP MY BUILD TO SOMETHING NOVEL OR SOME MEME BUILD TO JUST GO GOOF AROUND AND TRY TO HAVE SOME FUN PLAYING A DIFFERENT WAY. I'M TALKING BIG JUICY HEAD ON PLAYS OR HITTING THE KILLER IN THE HEAD WITH MY PEBBLE.
---
SHIT LIKE THAT USUALLY HELPS ME CHILL THE FUCK OUT AND JUST HAVE FUN. I USUALLY PLAY BETTER AND MAYBE EVEN GET A LAUGH OR TWO OUT OF MY TEAMMATES OR THE KILLER. AND I JUST TRY TO BE POSITIVE WITH EVERYONE ELSE I PLAY WITH TO HELP THEM HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE. IF I RUN INTO A TROLL JUST TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE MAD I JUST WISH THEM GG AND DON'T TAKE THE BAIT.
---
SO, IN SHORT, FIND SOME UNIQUE NEW BUILDS YOU LIKE, BE GOOD TO OTHERS AND DON'T GIVE THE IDIOTS WHAT THEY WANT WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO RUSTLE YOUR JIMMIES.
---
Hoffman didn’t wear a leather jacket. But he did wear like dark clothing. Shirts and such. I could be wrong. Again lol.
---
Perks are weird and it definitely breaks the habit that you talked about, I don’t think it will ever happen
---
Which is......
---
Yeah likely cause theres 4 survivors and 1 killer. The chance that one of the survivors is an asshole is higher than the chance of the killer being an asshole.
---
The devs confirmed its not. It takes what it must but will never take enough to get the entire earth. Which is evident by it going back and taking Plague. It doesn’t just take present day people.
---
same here
---
Amanda because the Saw chapter it's what got me into dbd and i'm a huge fan of Saw series + she was my favorite character
---
Option 3 is by far the most satisfying.
---
I PLAYED A BUBBA TODAY WHO D/C'D IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE CLEANSED HIS RUIN 30 SECONDS INTO THE MATCH.
---
BUBBAS OUT THERE BEING IDIOTS LATELY. COME ON PEOPLE, DON'T SULLY LEATHERY BOI'S GOOD NAME.
---
That is true on both
---
Should we get a killer/ survivor from stranger things? Vote  by upvoting or whatever (personally I don’t think so but it sounds cool
---
But aside from the map, that's why I said and asked originally what exactly is lisenced? I love horror movies but saw is my all time favorite. I've seen all of them more times than I can count. I know what was in the movie and what wasn't. 3 of the new outfits were never part of the film. So that's why I said what's licensed here besides the "test subject" outfit. The weapons are made up based on inspired props in the movie. Her original hidden blade was in the movie. Not these "inspired by" props. 
---
I dropped 25 bucks without a second thought for the cosmetics the second I seen they were in the store. It just baffles me that people are saying it's because it's licensed. It isn't. The character is. You can make "inspired by" products and sell them for a living without paying a dime in royalties because they have no claim to your work. But most of the people here don't get it... That's why I ask. Idc about paying for it. It's bought and done.
---
People are just angry at video games. The winning part and still harassing a player? Don't get it. Yeah sure I get angry sometimes (I'm a survivor main, too scared to play killer cause of this exact thing LMAO) but what do I do? I leave the second I lose and move on to the next game. I have friends who are guilty of the harassing a killer thing while we're in a 4 man SWF and it drives me nuts playing with them sometimes. Once again, it's not hard to just press the "leave match" button after dying. I even tell them "Just leave" once the match is over even if the killer did camp or tunnel. Like damn who cares. Leave and move on to the next game. But you're right. I see no point in people leaving hateful comments on people's profiles other than they're angry at video games and need to chill out.
---
Again with the amazing art!
---
Some really overpowered perks, especially the first.
---
One of those survivors which thinks camping/tunnelling is not allowed and whine in post game chat after you run into the killer after the unhook
---
I wonder when this will come out? Pretty much instant buy for me.
---
I dont play legion. But when they released him (hell even the leaks) I was excited for him. A character that is multiple people? Dude his power is going to be dope. Meh. Not really. He is annoying, and the “rework” didn’t do much for him. But I doubt they will ever revisit him or anything. He was literally unplayable before and bugged to hell. They just fixed what was bugged and moved on.
---
Or at least bring back legacy prestige but make it more gnarly for killers

Agreed.

Agreed. Quick and quiet can be a lot of fun.
---
What was the message
---
I would have been fuckin impressed as a survivor.
---
The freezer room trap, the pig juicer trap aka the vat trap. If you look by the gate in that pig juicer room you can see the furnace with a key in it and above the vat is the pig hanging on the hooks, the furnace room, the control room with Amanda's pig heads on the shelf. The bathroom is pretty much the only area that has anything from saw 1. Everything else is from 3.
---
So basically we should just go “Oh wow that’s a badass cosmetic, but that price is insane. I’ll just let it go instead of trying show how stupid that price is and that it needs to be lowered”? This is one of the gaming industry’s biggest problems. People don’t care about the price, they just want to look cool for their friends and it leads to greedier developers and overpriced microtransactions. I actually want the new cosmetics, but even if I didn’t, the prices BHVR has set are absolutely insane and need to be lowered. The last cosmetic I bought was during the Hallowed Blight, and that was only because I ran out of time. The only thing that will make me get them is if the prices are lowered or the devs give us the option to buy them with shards (just like in the mobile version).
---
I mean yea I get it. Like I said I couldn’t remember if I saw it or not. Pretty sure I did and that’s where they got it from. It’s the same with ghost face. They have the rights to the mask. And that’s it. They can’t do anything else within the scream universe. But they can do what they want with the ghost face mask. That was my whole point. If you don’t want to spend the money on it then don’t. There are people out there(like yourself) who are huge saw fans. And they want their skins for piggy. And that’s fine. If they came out with anything Micheal Myers I would buy in a heartbeat.
---
When the entity just wants you to leave
---
It displeases me she got nerfed when she was a meh killer to begin with. Like my traps are pretty useless at any point in the game now.
---
Haha yeah, I like making my perks... Different. I know it'll never happen, I don't usually make concepts in hopes of seeing them implemented into game, I just like people reading my ideas and, like you, taking time to criticise it all so my concepts get better.
---
You’d make him proud. &lt;3
---
I never once said the game is over when the 5 gens are done, yet you are pretending that is my attitude. Stop putting words in my mouth, and thinking about the context in which I say my original statement. 
---
Yes you're right, I'm not here to argue over a subject that I can factually prove is inefficient for the team. Its stupid to even suggest I'm open to wasting my time talking about it, so I shut it down immediately.
---
I've said my argument a thousand times some I'm not gonna waste my time going in depth for someone who is just going to disagree not matter what, but here is a gist. Even if you can easily find all of the totem locations on the map (even the best players can't always do that, but we can ignore this fact for simplicity), it's not productive for 1 or 2 players to preemvitvly get all of the totems themselves. The only times it is worth it is worth full SWF, because everyone splitting up to get 1 or 2 totems a peice when they happen to see them js infinitely more effectively. The fact that this perk is random is also a problem, because it creates a more luck based game and takes away skill/reward for playing effectively.
---
You think so? I try not to make them useless, but definitely not overpowered.
---
#F
---
I wonder what the message was like...
---
\*AIMBOTTING PIECE OF SHIT. REPORTED\*
---
Sloppy and Thanatos makes a good combo
---
YOU SHOULD RAGE AT EVERYONE INVOLVED HERE.
---
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT A SQUAD OF BOOSTED POTATOES TO PLAY WITH, WHICH SUCKS.
---
BUT ALSO BE PISSED AT THE BILLY. ANY KILLER THAT ACTUALLY KILLS A SURVIVOR ONE OF THE OTHER SURVIVORS POINTED OUT IS A COMPLETE PUSSY. IF THAT HAPPENED TO ME I PROMISE YOU I'M STAYING ON THE ONE THAT TRIED TO SELL THEIR TEAMMATE OUT UNTIL THEY'RE HOOKED AND THEN STARING THEM SQUARE IN THE EYE UNTIL THEY'RE DEAD.
---
FUCK PEOPLE THAT SANDBAG THEIR TEAMMATES. I HAD AN ASH DO THIS THE OTHER DAY TO MY SQUAD AND IT MADE ME SO MAD.
---
Yeah, I just went to check and he's got a standard black/dark blue coat over his shirt as the Pig. My bad!
---
Yes, thank you for explaining his moot point to me again as I didn't quite catch it the first time.
---
You don't understand tho... The amount of shit killers have to deal with in high ranks. Nurse is a God send JUST to make it EVEN.
---
Thats wrong, if its a real short loop where they are chasing you at the pallet but can't quite get you, you want them to break it so you can move on.
---
Wait, this isn't Google!
---
Right continue to be a condescending asshole because you just want to be upset over something...
---
LOL this post was my whole DbD experience today. I was playing killer with Pig's new cosmetics after rank reset to rank up and I encountered so many overly altruistic swf at low ranks. It's funny because their attempts at bullying made them an easy 4K as they kept walking straight into my hands.
---
This is just me, personally. I don’t even kill anyone in more than half of my games. I hook everyone twice and get as many bps as I can. I just don’t have the heart to kill (unless they’re toxic), but I can’t let them know I’m nice or they’ll never do gens and leave lmao. I personally just find the game more fun that way. I main Spirit and Pig :)
---
I wanna know what's under his hat
---
One of the reasons why I hate playing survivor is that struggling while being carried feels like it's physically breaking my hand. I've gotten to the point where I don't even try to struggle anymore.
---
I am glad that you enjoyed the journey of going to the disney land.
---
When survivor body blocked once and you realize that they MUST BE 4 man swf.
---
Also the same people vilifying it: Struggle takes too long
---
No joke someone in a swf said this in post game
---
I love her expressions on the end game screen
---
They also get mad if you chase them after they take a hit with BT
---
Sure any requirements?
---
His chest looks like a butt.
---
B is so accurate
---
What do you mean?! The second I saw the classic Amanda outfit I was sold. I like both but I just had to buy that one, it looks amazing and the sound the saw weapon makes when you swing it is just... tooo... cool... :D \*Implodes\*
---
I really didn't need to be reminded about that video...
---
Not da monie
---
Hmm. Just don’t be toxic to killers! I honestly don’t care about my rank anymore. Before rank reset I was rank 3. Now I’m 8, I think? I just want to meet new people and have fun.
---
I love it when a plan comes together
---
All this shows us is a pig killed a team and they only managed to get 1 gen done.  Game balance is more than one one-sided match.
---
Only ever happened twice on Xbox.
---
I get more Can’t Reach the killer,check your NAT,but it’s in Red Rank,also my Connection is great so it’s just the game.
---
What console is this, and when did it happen?
---
Poop goes the weasel.
---
Console nurse here
---
What’s your psn id?
---
Is Ruin a problem then?
---
They just nerfed survivors a bunch to bring killers up. Maybe look up some guides and perk builds? Watch pro streamers and try to pick up on how they play.
---
Whether you deserve it or not doesn’t matter. At least you yourself knows you played well. 
---
That’s what should make you happy.
---
How long have u been playing?
---
It is a very common gaming mechanic to give a crutch to the "losing" team near the end of a battle. See: Mario Kart, Battlefield, League of Legends..
---
I think NOED is more than fine, it gives the killer a chance at retribution. I just wish there were better perks or mechanics for survivors that allows 1-2 survivors a chance to clutch when the others die early on with gens still remaining.
---
It keeps the game interesting
---
thanks bro
---
Like my adrenaline is just my skill oozing out of me and healing my survivor (  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
---
How many times do I have to say it, The Entity will only take killers it can CONTROL. They have to be less powerful than it.
---
I'm not shitting my friend, I'm memeing. 😂 Chill and be calmed. Learn to take a joke when on the internet or you're gonna have a bad time.
---
*Laughs in red rank Survivor*
---
You just need to practice and improve.
---
Ghostface: Hey, guess what I can do?
---
nah I disagree: I think it’s the opposite. I play survivor and killer equally, and I find it much easier as killer than survivor getting a 4K than escaping. A year ago, I could escape every time, then I took a break and suddenly it’s infinitely harder to escape cos of the new system where you can open the 2 doors at the end if you’re the last survivor. As killer, as soon as you get one kill it’s pretty much over for the survivors, eg yesterday we had one gen 3 survivors n killer camped each gen as right next to each other, impossible win. my point is, saying it’s impossible for killers is subjective to your gameplay, and there’s no reason to say ‘mathematically impossible’ to sound smart as how could you ‘mathematically explain’ how killers get 4Ks when you claim it’s impossible - of course, mathematically.
---
Wildest Deams
---
Yep, was mostly thinking that, but was worried if there was like a programming quirk that would change stuff. Thanks!
---
Thanks!
---
I don't consider hatch an escape really, I'll nab it when I can as survivor, but even then it never feels like a win

I mean Hop did struggle with the Russian dude quite a bit before winning, he definitely isn't super tough, plus the Entity probably drains most strength from those who are stronger physically
---
Why it look like the Entity abouta be clapped
---
Guess like we're not gettin ruin boiz. Live to die another day
---
Ey, my friend had this problem all day.
---
Because paying ten dollars for a single cosmetic on a game I already payed for, that is also constantly plagued with bugs and connection issues, isn't already going the extra mile.
---
I didn't say which killer. I feel like Hops could easily beat down The Nurse or Amanda personally, but the bigger killers are out of his league
---
Not really. Nurse's first blink is 20m, and her terror radius is 32. You would always hear her heartbeat even with range.
---
Only complaints I saw were people complaining about the pip system (which isn't a great system), and a survivor complaining about NOED
---
What
---
Z- I didn’t need this mental image ingrained into my brain.
---
Looks like a "pig" flex
---
You are nowhere near experienced enough to talk about balance in this game. New survivors typically get consistently beaten by killers because they don’t know how to loop and don’t do objectives efficiently. 
---
There are no OP killer perks you just don’t know how to counter them. 
---
I don’t understand the mentality of being a novice at a game and trying to talk about balance as if you have any deeper understanding at all. You need to be play way more and actually understand how the game is played before even beginning to form an opinion on balance.
---
I honestly don't know. It's BHVR's fault completely for the rampant DC's, and hopefully this will be put to an end soon. The only advice I could give you, is to maybe stall the game out a little bit if you're confident with your Huntress skills. Maybe let it drag on for a bit to "appear" like you're giving them more of a chance.   
---
However, this shouldn't be an issue though. I really can't wait for DC punishments soon. It just screws everyone over and is a scummy thing to do 9 times out of 10.
---
1 by you're standards or winning an argument then you've lost with this post since it was nothing but rude and literally didn't add anything to the more discussion than your first post. 2 while noed counterplay for survivors I agree sucks, cleansing totems is still a counter play. If you look at adrenaline since it often used as the survivors end game crutch perk then  you'll see that it has 0 counterplay if we are going with the statistics that majority of games while have 5 gens done plus 2 dead and 2 escapes meaning it pop with the killer having 0 way to stop it. You can stop noed (even like I said it's a stupid counterplay to it) but at high ranks you aren't gonna stop adrenaline from popping saving people who should of been downed/killed.
---
No doubt this game has always been brutal for new players.
---
Shirtless doctor. He fucking ***RIPPED***
---
3 months I think
---
That's what I meant though, the entity probably drains physical powers down of people it brings in so that they cannot fight back, cause if they could what's stopping literally anyone from breaking a massive branch off a tree and knocking almost any killer out with it
---
I run Survivor at Rank 5 atm (reset) with no perks. You expected a "git gud" because you know it's the answer, you just don't want to.
---
I still have Hitler installed :S
---
Honestly this is pretty fucking amazing. 
---
It reminds me of a Slasher film and it kind of reminded me of Evil Within. 
---
Keep up the good work man.
---
Connection is getting fixed soon,bugs don’t happen that often that hinders gameplay(I’m talking about Exit not Working or can’t Self-heal and Dead Hard)
---
More specifically it’s 3 Cosmetics into a Bundle which you don’t have to buy all of it and it’s not a lot.
---
It’s only Unnecessary Drama
---
No dude sorry to say this but you're just bad... Don't go for the guy who's looping you, go for the group at the generator
---
Doc probs has those clamps that you put on your car on his nipples lmao
---
If you can't beat Legion, you are trash. This is fact. He's annoying, but he's the least dangerous killer in the game.
---
FEAST ON THE SALT
---
SPRINKLE IT ON ME MY BENEVOLENT ENTITY
---
Link ?
---
I imagine an even smaller Kangol.
---
Its really good, could argue even better than old DS. Cant dribble, basically gives full immunity to you after being unhooked for a minute. If the killer rightfully plays around DS and slugs, you can use Unbreakable (which has faster recovery speed now) and kill their momentum still.
---
Killers get 4K when survivors commit mistakes. Considering that you chase at least 1 "good" survivor, if you stay for like a minute in the chase, the others can repair 3 gens, just do the math. I don't mind getting 2 or 3 kills in a match, or in the worst case 1, but the pip system is fucked. You can't kill all survivor if they make a good match, how are you supposed to pip killing 3-4 survivor, without camping, if they are good? If you don't camp and still get like 8 hooks, let's say, 2 on each, you didn't played bad as fu\*\* like the game says. It's hard to get kills without camping or even patrolling at all if they are good, but you need to if you wanna pip, and if you camp to get them you lose points. I think survivor is 10 times easier, I got rank 1 with them easily in every season (or month, idk) I played. But killer? Hard as fuck. Got rank 1 last season with my friend in SWF within a week. Only me and my friend were needed in most matches to distract the killer and repair gens. Do you think it is fair being allowed to play in 4 people parties?
---
They have hundreads of employees to pay off and outside of the cosmetics they sell 7$ dlcs every 3 months.
---
I think you are overestimating how much money they are making off of dbd.
---
*sees Miata*
---
*Laughs in white album *
---
What perks do you use?
---
The problem is it's not skillful, which even you are implying. It's a somewhat statistical balance, which is almost never the best answer to any problem in any game in my opinion.
---
The killer wait times will probs go back to being super long again next week when the Freddy rework drops
---
I always use them if I want to. I mean, they're in the game for a reason and if you haven't still prestiged it's even more worthy. You should use them all unless you're playing the nurse. It will mess up you muscle memory.
---
Killer gets lonely

Yep! IIRC, if you have his Perks on a character already, they'll keep them. If you want to get them on characters that don't already have them, you'll have to level Bill up and unlock the Teachables like normal. He'll be free just like on PC though, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem.
---
I'm waiting for a j/k myself
---
I mostly play with friends so when I do I use better items and add ons, but when I play alone or with just one friend I use lesser items and add ons. I use mostly tool boxes as a survivor. Kinda depends on killer. If I use high tier killers I don't need any add ons but with low tier killers I like to bring something along.
---
Duh, didn't you know these are mandatory to play the game? 
---
Smh my head.
---
Don't worry. Freddy comes out Tuesday. Us killer mains will be waiting again.
---
I stockpile so I have the ones I might need depending on the survivors I get
---
This is really sick? A lot of the time with traditional art we talk about trying to make it so you cant see the pencil strokes and blah blah but I honestly think it really adds to the style here. I seriously love this, hope to be seeing more from ya! &lt;3
---
Thanks man, I truly appreciate the response. I’m so happy Valve gave the green light, as it might have more implications of the future.
---
What's wrong with the hat? I wear them all the time an was jazzed when I found a YouTuber that also wears them.
---
this hurts to read
---
Hey, no problem! I agree 100%, really seems like the game's going in a good directions in regards to licensing recently.

HOW THE HELL IS THIS STUPID GATE GLITCH STILL NOT FIXED!?  I'M TIRED OF TRYING TO ESCAPE ONLY TO END WALKING RIGHT THROUGH THE EXIT POINT.
---
indeed but I only use that when I deserve it not when I fail at protecting gen :) and the game rewards me with 4% instant down and EGC and all the pallets are in my fucking ass UwU.
---
This is the only reason I use the FOV-Perk with Pig. It’s literally too good not to.
---
[**Licensed content isn’t going to be free**](/intensifies)
---
1. I literally did, and wasn't rude. 
---
2. Adrenaline still loses to 1 hit downs, and it's only a real problem when more then 1 person has it. NOED literally takes skill out of the game because you have to guess and make a choice unless you're playing full SWF.
---
Same goes for console now honestly. I get godlike Nurses pretty regularly now on ps4 since the framerate has improved.
---
Remember a little tiny detail. BHVR does not own the characters. They are paid under a license. If the owners don't want a skin then we don't get a skin. If the devs want a skin for the characters then they will have to pay for the rights to add it under the owners' approval and regulations. Expensive? Maybe. Ranting and blaming the devs won't change a thing.
---
I have on many occasions been considered a pretty chill Trapper to play against.
---
I like letting the 4th get the hatch unless I'm worried I won't atleast saftey pip due to quitters/suicides.
---
Outside of that, I'm playing a chill game an have no reason to be an ass
---
And I think it should all probably get worked on a little because honestly, the balancing in this game is not good at all. But NOED isn't as broken as you think it is either, regardless of whether it needs adjusting, I'd much rather see them begin balancing some of the killers more and leveling the playing field for people who want to play more than Nurse and Spirit.
---
Using T1 lunge add-on on a Myers without scratched mirror... Yep you suck at Myers

I meant any good killer will remember who started the match injured and won't slug them

---
I'm sorry unless you know how much they have to pay in royalties, I don't care. This is how franchises work, if you want to use a character you gotta pay, and BHVR can't add new cosmetics for a licenced character without paying and ultimately agreeing on the licence holder's price. If they upped the price it was probably for this reason, if not that, then probably the fact they added an animated weapon and sound to the skin, and need the extra money to compensate for the extra work the artist had to do on it.
---
if you tried harder you could have escaped the entity itself ...
---
1 ya it was rude the downvotes for everything should be obvious and no you just restated your first post. 2 so you're saying noed counters adrenaline is what I'm getting ( I agree it's the point of 1 hit downs) but yet you're complaining about it.... How you don't see the bias rn is unbelievable lol
---
Idk why people are downvoting this 😂 The blinding white light burned eyes
---
Thanks! Yeah, in art class the teacher always talked about how the goal was to make the lines not visible. The sketchy effect was a product of my laziness to shade it as well as to add some style (I think). I'm glad you like it!
---
Is there a way to turn off only messages?  Whenever I try to set it to block messages it wants to make it so I can’t hear anybody in game chat who isn’t on my friends list in other games on top of blocking messages and I don’t want that..
---
I'm saying it's so minor that you could camp all game and only lose 15% on one emblem
---
Umm no? You can't do the generator properly if there's a hex ruin because it sets the progress back and you need lot of skill to time it perfectly.
---
&gt;I get that you're new
---
Exactly. Glad you realized that, smartass. This game is unbalanced FOR BEGINNER SURVIVORS. Did you even read? Or did you just jump straight to namecalling after you heard something bad about your favorite game? Pathetic.
---
Then leave :)
---
im gonna go do meg things
---
God pig is so damn fine
---
But can you imagine the mid chase rando blinks. Oh mai lawd.
---
Same like tunnelling, both are the objective and both are camcerous/not fun at all
---
You know, the are already a lot of p3 claudettes who heals after stunning the killer with a pallet abd manage to heal fully. That perk will make this even stronger against m1 killer and make more viable already OP killers like nurse and spirit.
---
It would if that were the case for all four of the skins. Only the leather pig skin costs more though, both Tapp skins and the test subject oinker are the usual price for purple cosmetics.
---
Game isnt balanced, that is all.
---
Totally. Nurse requires just some practice, but after getting used to her blinks you can just forget any strategy and mindgame and just go straight to the survivors with minimum effort.
---
Meanwhile a "basic" killer like Wraith must think of a ton of things to do good, making his appearently easy power way harder to use.
---
That's okay: as long as you're still buying the licensed killers, you're technically,cancelling out any effect 'speaking with your wallet' might have. But since realistically you can't expect licensed killers to be free, you just have to accept that the only way to speak with your wallet is literally not buying anything: not killers,not skins.
---
Plus, I don't think people here realize how a profit system dependent on whaling works: buying less doesn't actually guarantee lower prices. Extremely few people buy microtransactions for mobile games, yet they're as expensive as ever: you do not see shifting microtransaction economies, pretty much ever. As long as whales exist, you physically cannot speak with your wallet, because there will always be someone with a bigger wallet than you happy to speak louder with it.
---
It must be easy for you to assume I am some really noob and retarded player who probably doesn't even know what a skillcheck is. That's ok. Maybe if you were in my shoes you would understand how every match I have played has been.
---
That would make sense if all four skins cost more but only one of them does.
---
its the same across all games, when something is overpowered people who rely on it always have some sort of excuse for why it should be overpowered, being "hard to play" is one of the main ones even though there is almost no real difference in skill need vs other options.
---
No HUD. No skill check wheel. No timer. Nothing.
---
Dude you WILL progress the generator, doing it solo is also way more helpful when ruin is active. Also it is not unbalanced for beginners... Did you do the tutorial? Gives you more than enough bloodpoints to get more perks. Also instead of trying to learn the game you instantly go and complain... People like you are the reason why Freddy will get nerfed again.
---
It was my first game of the night so no comments on my looping lool
---
I don't understand the cooldown and exhaustion at the same time...sometime will overlap and don't allow you to use it but...the cooldown isn't really needed as when you run you can recover and 30 sec recover and 45 cooldown are almost the same. Also, I guess you may use it when chasing or saving people, and unless the killer is very nice, you'll guarantee a tunnel.
---
Did you get the achievement for it?
---
holy shit it even looks like she's smiling.
---
That drill probably had to be animated and slightly coded differently to play the sounds and work properly, if a bit extra is what was needed to properly compensate artists and others I'm for it. That being said you made good points about the royalties and yeah guess I'm wrong there, I'll just keep buying the cosmetics I like tho, to keep supporting the game.
---
An actually helpful comment here. Quite surprising since the whole community seems toxic judging by the replies I have got.
---
As a killer, always. Not the best as I stockpile those and only whip them out after I’ve been thrashed for two to three consecutive games.  It’s a fragile pride thing. 
---
Survivor?  Usually I roll with whatever I got from the chest the previous match. I tend to horde the addons until I have twenty plus.
---
Still worth it for da drill
---
The killer was a Lagswitch main.
---
#cool
---
360 this you fucking casual.
---
God if only the BP and pips reflected this
---
Hell I can get a 4k currently and still not fucking pip
---
Same with escaping had a game where I did 3 gens, got out and still got a depip
---
Like I'm cool with the 2k balance, but only if bp and pips reflect it
---
Yeah, I'm just saying, if they lower it down to say, 5 per skin on the standard ones, or even 7 or 8, they'd get more money simply because of how many more would buy them. They'd at least get a lot from me, lol
---
This was me today only with a flashlight clicking , chase baiting Meg who blinded me twice picking up survivors. Ghost Face is great for one shotting those pesky Megs.
---
That's if we assume that good survivors will always sit near the pallets or windows. But good survivors commit to the teamwork and can be caught in the open as a result
---
Gotta pray for DS obsession change.
---
Cant wait for rule 34
---
I normally try to save my teammates at the end, but if I'm rancor, as soon as the gate is open I'm out this bitch
---
"Ultra rare"  yea ok
---
rank 10. It also might have been bc the rest of them had flashlights and shit
---
I just love the drill noise when she swings and the survivors being able to hear it makes it pretty spooky to go against too
---
This has got to be bait right?  Really feels like an obvious troll shitpost.
---
Cant expose me if i expose myself ;)
---
I'd rather not think about it
---
Yeah, I’d make sure to hook the survivors who tbagged their teammate and let the tbagged one go free just to spite them lol
---
Same, I'll get like 10 hooks and a 3k but depip cause gens were still done quickly.
---
The problem isn't getting looped. The problem is the guy in the chase telling his friends "Killer is chasing me, do gens". When the guy hooked can tell exactly who's coming to unhook, and if the killer is near or not, so the other 2 are still on gens, when in a real match if we use Bond we can see that almost every hook theres 2 guys going for the hook, thinking if it is the best play or not and etc, idk, being like it was supposed to be. Repairing a full gen alone = 80 seconds. If you cant waste at least 50 seconds of the killer's time you are a incredibly bad survivor. 50 seconds on you, plus the time to hook you and go patrol the other gens should be something like at least 80 seconds = every other of your friends getting 1 full gen each = 3 gens done. If the killer go search for the other survivors you will tell the nearest friend to unhook you, and the other 2 will be doing gens. Let's suppose that the killer get another chase with one of your 2 friends that were on gens, it will be you and the guy that unhook you free to repair 1 gen together, at the same time your other friend that stayed repairing gens while you were hooked. He is finishing his gen, your other friend is looping killer and you and another guy are doing a gen together. In a matter of seconds you will have finished the 5.

Watch this video of TrU3Ta1ent:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfRH5VzNOhI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfRH5VzNOhI) . Did he made any mistakes here? I think no. If he's a bad player, I don't know what a good player is.
---
^ this it is on purpose
---
alguien que habla español es raro ver eso
---
Psn xremagx I usually play solo but a team sounds fun
---
If only my discord friends knew. If only....
---
T-Bagging Ghotsface was broken last i played, is it still?
---
Tap is best survivor you can't change my mind
---
im waiting till the day my p0 billy dosent get an ebony in his bloodweb. it wont stop giving me them
---
I use them until they become a tiny amount then stop and try to get some more
---
MEG ON MY TEAM WAS THE OBSESSION WITH DYING LIGHT. I GOT CARRIED INTO THE BASEMENT AND RIGHT AS I WAS HOOKED SHE SLOWLY LEFT THE BASEMENT LOCKER IN FRONT OF MYERS. AFTER HE DOWNED AND HOOKED HER RIGHT NEXT TO ME SHE KILLS HERSELF ON THE HOOK. NOT ONLY WERE WE DOWN A TEAMMATE BUT DYING LIGHT NOW FUCKS US.
---
Like I said I have no issue with the 2k goal, but if they want it that way they need to fix the pips
---
Honestly like the old kill based pips better, though that system was more fucked than the current one, but at least it felt rewarding
---
Nonsense all megs are big brained
---
Wraith. Forget the name
---
God you two are so cute
---
honestly i mostly play survivor because of friends and getting lobbies faster and imo adrenaline and noed and comparable: Adrenaline, 4 people have most of the time and NOED only 1, however NOED might also be four times as strong so that's even. But what does NOED have that Adrenaline hasn't?  
---
Counterplay. You can easily just cleanse totems, you are 4 people for 5 totems, with one being ruin almost every time any way.
---
Laughing stock is this post

It took a match or two to get used to

I did
---
Steam is having difficulties and might think youre offline for a few minutes. That's when you cant create lobbies. At least for me
---
Maybe make it so you gain extra bloodpoints as well
---
The lobbies don’t just “break” in my experience. If you’ve got 3 people in and you’re waiting on one, that’s just it. You’re waiting on one person. Finding solo survivors at certain times of the day can take a little while. Only 15% of the player base mainly plays killer. The rest are 50/50 or exclusively play survivor. Of that 85% survivor player pool, only 15% of them prefer to play solo survivor. So by the numbers, it’s going to take much longer to find a solo survivor player to fill your 3 person lobbies. I’ve had to wait like 10 minutes MAX for a lobby as killer. Usually never longer than that. I feel like you’re exaggerating slightly and probably just need to learn to wait for a bit.
---
Killers like him should understand that sometimes you need to abandon a chase.

LESSON LEARNED, DO NOT SHOW MERCY! KILL THEM ALL!
---
If pallets are a problem: Enduring (never fear a stun, just take it) and Spirit Fury are your best friends. 
---
I dislike Ruin as well, it’s only good against bad players and I don’t need it anyway if they’re bad.
---
Whispers saves a lot of time, you need to learn what 32m are but that way, you can check a gen without going to it. 
---
Pop goes the weasel is a good and reliable alternative to Ruin. 
---
BBQ has good information and doubles your points so you can get good perks quicker.  
---
Depending on the killer, Monitor and Abuse andNurse’s Calling are good.
---
Brutal Strength isn’t amazing but always solid to crack those pallets quicker, especially with Spirit Fury.
---
You hate windows? Bamboozle is amazing. 
---
PS: if you don‘t know which killer has what perk, there‘s a wiki with all the information.
---
Ikr I just want original Freddy then they could sell a lot of cosmetics for him!
---
I'd take giant worm Freddy thank you very much
---
If a Skin costs as much as 2 DLCs then that’s just trying to suck the money out of skin addicts.
---
I would pay 10$ for a DLC, but not for a skin of a character I probably won’t play so often.
---
And if you calculate all the money of those who buy the game (on PC, Xbox, PS), DLC‘s and Skins
---
you will get enough money to pay the employees.
---
then start being an example and do totems, that's like workers saying "we need this house built" and everyone stares at the ground and sees that no one else is starting and just goes home and complains the house isnt even started yet
---
If he's shirtless post Halloween 2 he might be burned like freddy's face
---
This once happened to me and I was able to get out by using frenzy to jump other the pallet
---
I'm no ps4
---
IF NO1 IS DOING GENS THEN DROP ALL THE PALLETS AND WATCH THE WORLD BURN!!
---
I can imagine him coming out the floor like that while someones fixing a gen xD
---
if only it was in the survival category or boldness was capped at a way higher value though
---
Why... didn't... you... DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGE!?
---
Have you played the game at all? It's the other way around, trapper is crying while survivors flashlight fuck you to death
---
So a shitty version of remade Freddy?
---
The killer I like the most, for the character and all is Doctor. I know he's weak considering the best ones. Only way I can down a good survivor in less than 40 secs is with Billy's chainsaw. I'm starting to practice with Billy, already seen a good progress. I noticed that he is the easiest killer to apply pressure (for me, at least). Only viable way if they "gen rush" is ending with the famous "3 gen strat", but you still can't commit to chases often. I know that im very very far from being a good player, but I still think it's easier for survivors, even on good killer streamers we can see it. I play on XOne now btw, what about you?
---
When i say ''broken'' i mean that only 3 survivors are joining and only 3. If one of these 3 survivors leaves, someone else immediately takes his place. But the fourth spot never fills. Broken lobbies exist
---
no one thought it would be free, we just dont like that its $15 as opposed to $10
---
If you DC, you just have him extra time to kill someone else.
---
Google translator has fooled me once again
---
Right. I forgot Freddy can teleport.
---
Of course the killer is going to camp whoever he catches, they shouldn't have got in a chase, and the exit gates are powered, stupid how people complain about camping during endgame when the killers only objective during endgame is to drag whoever he catches down with him.
---
He's actually pretty good if you use windstorm and swift hunt, but if we are talking about him with no add ons then yeah he is dogshit
---
Yeah, that would mean being able to earn licensed killers for free... I highly doubt they'll ever allow you to earn premium currency for free unless they do the Mobile Game style and have "Free Auric Cells" and "Paid Auric Cells" and have licensed killers be Paid Auric Cells only.
---
Shit I just gave them an idea that they're gonna make worse
---
CREATE SWEDEN APPLE ACCOUNT AND LOGIN THEN DOWNLOAD DBD THEN SWITCH BACK TO YOUR OLD ACCOUNT! NEXT TIME GOOGLE IT!
---
Well I play on Xbox and I bought today early both costumes, so yes, there are already licensed cosmetics on PC/Console
---
Nothing? There's nothing inherently wrong with matches where all 4 survivors manage to escape.. just like there's nothing wrong with killers getting 4Ks, they're the most extreme results but they're valid results.
---
with my luck on those vaults I would have been hit
---
Or what Ghostface SHOULD have been.
---
Imagine you turn on a pvp game and expect wins without being good or gaining experience first. 
---
If you get destroyed in this game, you deserve it. Good killers and survivors are laughing in your face when reading this post.
---
Remember when the devs broke the ranking system, yes i do, after that no one cares about rank.
---
It's not actually $15 to be fair
---
It’s fine we all forget at times.
---
monkaS
---
You seriously expect players who have never/barely played to excel in playing the game and have easy matches?
---
Comparing beginner survivors vs experienced killers hurts your argument so much. If you want us to "imagine being a beginner, your level 1 character has only 1 perk slot and most of the starting perks are already mediocre", at least use an even playing ground as base for your argument. 
---
&gt; you wait patiently crouching near a pallet, to see who the killer is after.
---
You have no heartbeat. You're not in danger. ***Why*** would you crouch behind an object to see who the killer is after? 
---
&gt; By some luck, the killer is far away from you, and you only learned that because you saw the aura of an already downed survivor.
---
Please stop acting as if the aura of an already downed survivor is your only way of telling who or where the killer is. You have eyes, you have a third person and you can spin the camera at all times - ***use it!*** Many, many, MANY times you can see a killer's silhouette in the distance OR you take a second and look at your own HUD in the bottom left corner to check if all survivors are healthy. And in case you didn't know it, if the killer injures a survivor, their icon actually changes and lights up for a few seconds to *indicate to all players that someone is chased and got hit by the killer.*
---
This process is called situational awareness. If you pay attention to the game, you'll *learn* and *increase your situational awareness.* You'll learn that totems have a high chance of spawning in specific tiles/near specific objects. You'll learn that specific killers have specific objects tied to them (Trapper: bear traps on the ground, Pig: Jigsaw boxes, Plague: fountains, ...). ***You. Will. Learn.***
---
&gt; You make your way to rescue said survivor only to see another one of the survivors injured.
---
And? What's your point? That the killer hunts? That another survivor got found? In a game about Hunting survivors and escaping from a killer? Would you prefer to see a killer camping a single soul to death, just standing still next to the hook, while you do generators (or crouch behind a pallet until you see who the killer is after)? Did you buy the game to escape from a killer or did you buy the game to watch a progression bar for 80 seconds, 5 times? 
---
&gt; Eventually, all hopes to complete even one generator are lost.
---
If you always crouch behind a pallet until you know who the killer is after this is the expected outcome, yes. Because you're wasting time and decrease your teams chances to escape.
---
&gt; because the killer is faster
---
Please explain how the killer would be able to catch you if killers and survivors had the same movement speed.
---
&gt; and for some goddamn reason knows exactly where you are hiding.
---
Situational awareness and experience. The killer doesn't waste time waiting behind a pallet until a generator is completed and indicates "hey, survivors were here!".
---
&gt; and god knows what other unbalanced perks the game has reserved for killers. And don't even get me started with the dlc killers. Almost all of them have op perks that they start out with and powers that are hard to counter for beginners. Pig? Ghostface? Spirit? Hag? All of them op.
---
"I got beat. Whatever beat me is OP. It's not the lack of my experience and, therefore, the lack of my own skill. Nope. It's the game's fault for having mechanics that allow others to beat me."
---
&gt; Many of them also carry that hex ruin which requires survivors to locate and destroy the hex totem in order to complete the generators or perform perfect skill checks to get the generator working. Now do you guys really think this is easy for a beginner?
---
See, this point isn't helping your argument at all, as I've explained earlier. Brand new killer players with "1 perk slot and the mediocre starting perks" will NOT have the playtime nor the resources to a) unlock Ruin for every killer by owning and leveling the Hag to Level 35 or b) unlock Ruin via the Shrine of Secrets. Brand new killer players will NOT have the experience to know how impactful Hex: Ruin can be. They will use whatever general perk the bloodweb throws at them and NOT run around with the most popular META perks ever.
---
&gt; How is the beginner survivor even supposed to level up? 
---
By playing the game.
---
&gt; This game is so horribly unbalanced 
---
"This game isn't ez pz with 0,00001 seconds playtime on my account. This game is garbage!"
---
&gt; You people probably also think I am some noob who doesn't know hpw to play.
---
Because this is the case. Stop lying to yourself or at least admit that you want easy matches with little to no experience.
---
Oh wow thanks for the work!

---
Rock win verities
---
Pretty lady leatherface would actually be nice
---
Stupid how survivors think even if the killer just saw them when he hooked someone he's supposed to go to the other side of the universe and let the very obvious survivors he knows are there save the survivor from the hook. I had this game where i saw a claudette after hooking a laurie and this brain dead claudette was looping me around the pallet right next to the hook, wtf. Then they whined about camping because claudette looped me around the hooked survivor.
---
Shame, Hag can shut that loop down in the 2 seconds it takes to lay a trap.
---
If anyone is named the Phantom in this game I would hope it would be some kind of Phantom of the Opera themed killer with some mechanic revolving around a musical organ.
---
Half of the time as Huntress I've had hatchets whiff over a guys head because he teabagged, causing the hatchet to phase through his skull.
---
The other half, playing against Huntress, I've had a hatchet hit me when it clearly missed me by five miles.
---
Starting to think its just latency.
---
For me the problem is Host Unreachable on survivor. Sometimes Killer lobby don't get survivor in like 5 or so minutes, and I think its a  "NAT Type problem" too. 
---
I play on XOne, and have Open NAT.
---
Matthew confirmed that they don't plan on adding it anytime soon
---
As far as it goes though, it would probably be a shit show
---
I mostly play killer and hate using a purple mori. It feels like an artificial win.
---
 Old lady Laurie 👍🏻
---
what are the odds!!
---
Man that arm is something else
---
Best advice that I can give you? Start with Claudette. Pick up Self Care as your first perk. Try to get to level 40 with her to unlock the teachables to all survivors. Move on to Meg or Nea, depending on which playstyle you'd prefer (getting chased vs being immersive).
---
Keep working on those gens. Practice takes time but you'll get it eventually. Generations are the main thing that you need to escape, so you will need to pick up the skill sooner rather than later. 
---
Altruism is all fine and good, BUT don't try to unhook within the terror radius. While sacrificing yourself to save someone else sounds "kewl", ultimately you just don't know if you'll be saved in return and a lot of Killers like to camp and low ranks, so it's better to just not bother. If you have been extremely productive and you have a lot of bloodpoints, feel free to do as you please.
---
Accept the fact that until you get some decent perks and skills in, your goal isn't escaping as much as it being as productive for your team as possible. You don't need to reach rank 10 or 1 within your first 100 hours with the game. Your goals should be:
---
A. Getting used to hitting great skillchecks
---
B. Getting used to the gimmicks of the Killers
---
C. Learning pallet efficiency
---
D. Learning the general layout of most maps, including generator and totem locations.
---
Once you pick up these skills, you should learn to loop, get used to losing Killers while they chase you, and cheese like 360's, baiting Trappers into stepping into their own traps, consistently making Huntresses miss with their hatchets, etc. But these things will take a WHILE to learn, so take your time with the game. You shouldn't be able to stomp Killers as a newbie anyways.

Good luck and happy gaming.

I guess the majority of the PS4 players have more of a fondness for the the peaceful/less stressful Survivor role than the more hectic/always moving Killer role. And I guess that makes sense as I have noticed that people tend to play console as a relaxing/unwind after school/work experience as apposed to PC players. (not that people DON'T play PC casually, I have just noticed that if you are serious about gaming competitively, most people would probably play on PC over console.) 
---
Me playing Killer almost exclusively may also be why I noticed the big jump because I am so used to constantly needing to keep moving/going that the slighlty longer Survivor wait time feels astronomical... I also hate just sitting and doing nothing in general so that may also be a factor.
---
Also 582 off F
---
Why do your graphics look so weird ?
---
*sad dab*
---
well yeah but if you dont have any extra cells in your account, then you have to pay the 15 to buy it
---
Gay Myers Shadow.
---
Yep. This happened to my friend.
---
Good eye, I didn’t think about that. Maybe only one player would need to own The Legion to start a KWF lobby.
---
It works both ways, play killer and go against experienced survivors, you will either not see anyone the whole game, not land a single hit, or just get bullied the all game.
---
Lol and the survivors juking the hell out of the killer. I don't play often, but if I do it's with friends.
---
I honestly don't care what but I wouldn't mind more ash cosmetics
---
Ok this clears up alot. The doctors main weaknesses is the amount of time he has to spend putting a survivor in madness 3 so that's where the bulk of you chase time might be. I'm assuming you're probably rank 10 - 16? If you wanna get your chase times watch some YouTubers like damnnohtml and  look at the build "impossible skill check doc"As for the balance it goes swf, killer, solo but working as a team isn't as easy as they make it look unless they're all very good and originally swf wasnt a part of the base game so it is impossible to balance. I play ps4 but I've had the game since it was on early access on steam
---
And also they enjoy bugs and trash killers then. You deserve to be sdunzed popo mazonna cara.
---
Bbq, ruin, monitor n abuse and corrupt intervention. Early game you will probably get a hook and it will snowball for sure
---
Try spirit my dude
---
It's possible... and thank you.
---
how in gods name did that even happen
---
I also recognize that unique terror radius music would need to be introduced my idea-
---
Legion 1- A_A_A_A_A_
---
Legion 2_B_B_B_B_B
---
“A” and “B” are notes/chords, and since they are attached to each legionnaire, you will have a sense of whether both or only one is near you. Each theme would increase/decrease in intensity proportionate to distance, so if only one is after you, you’ll know, and if they’re both on your ass, you’ll certainly know.
---
My thoughts
---
Go to the Facebook of Dead by Daylight. They posted a picture there and on Twitter.
---
Something.similar happened to me just yesterday. Claudette unhooked me and when I was running away to hide for healing she started healing me in broad daylight even though Michael was approaching us. I was the obsession and he mori'd me because I couldn't get away from that Claudette. I feel you so much, and I also think that this looks like they were working together in your case.
---
It's amazing what scribbles can do when used in patterns.

yeah but the people who talk about that stuff on fucking twitter are brain-damaged.
---
Thats bs i ply on xbox and i want everything to ve free because it should be and i already bought an xbox rite
---
Mathieu body pillow pls
---
Just think about it for a second. DbD is a competitive game. If a competitive game is balanced after the low level play, as soon as the new/bad players get better, it would be just as imbalanced again.
---
TL;DR Don't ever balance competitive games after low level play, and chance your attitude about harder games.
---
Hi! I hope you like my drawing. I am planning to draw more Killers (currently working on Ghost Face). So feel free to let me know, which one should I draw next.
---
They are adding bill to console which means one step closer to cross play and cross platform progression so we probably don’t have to pay if we already did on pc or console
---
Nice outplay, but just a tip: in the first half of the clip you cut the shack super wide, so the killer got more distance on you.
---
Not a fan of the shoulder pads but I love the waist coat and long tails.
---
To be fair the game does have in game loot boxes that are free ;)
---
I was surprised at how it looked at first, then I just went with it.
---
When I was new I got looped so hard at killer shack that everyone escaped. I didn't quit. I took the hard loss with the taunting message from the survivor who looped me. I went to youtube right after to help me learn what to do. Game is not nice to new players.
---
I seriously got looped at the shack for near 5 gens. Hasn't happened since though.
---
Sometimes I wonder if killers like this spirit, are deaf.
---
Honestly the rate this game is going it honestly should become free to play really as it has the aspects of a free to play game
---
Excuse me but how are they trolling??? They’re running and dropping pallets LOL what video did you watch?
---
&gt;Well it was free on psn plus. And if you have Xbox it’s free with the game pass. So technically you shouldn’t have to spend money to play it. Unless you have been playing since launch. And in that case your buying dlc for it. If you don’t like the price don’t buy it.
---
Then dont buy it
---
its a skin.
---
I would also love to see them take away the movement speed and give it to Fire Up at 1% per completed gen.
---
The audience wants to know why the graphics look like this sir!!!  We demand answers lol
---
People on this thread complain about gen rush but destroying totems is something you're not supposed to do either. At this point I don't know what to believe.
---
I must know.
---
Maiden ist eine Jungfrau.
---
Just removing the added speed boost would be enough for me
---
How do you download the mobile version? I joined for the beta but I haven't recieved anything yet
---
Then don't buy the extra content.
---
As far as I'm concerned they can charge whatever the hell they want for cosmetics. If it costs too much, just dont buy it. Youre not losing out on anything by not buying it.
---
The new skins are sweet, but the only thought that i have to spend 15$ for a fucking skin makes me cringe. This is fortnite-tier robbery; srry BHVR, not this time.
---
This was reposted like 5 times now
---
&gt;If you think $15 is too much, just dont buy it.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;What do you lose? Absolutely nothing.
---
You still get an updoot but edit out ghostfaces shoulder it’ll look better then
---
Freddy isn't a lost cause.
---
They could add human 2010 Freddy. Probably wouldn't look like Jackie earle Haley though if we got it :/
---
That would actually make fire up not a meme perk
---
**Thereafter**
---
– Ghostface turns around
---
– Claudet is not 0.0
---
– Ghostface – leaves the game
---
Watch videos or streamers play. This game is hard for new players. Stick with it though, this game can be quite fun once you get the mechanics down and we need all the more players.
---
Z is innacurate, i play billy completely fair and am friendly unless you act like an asshole
---
I picked the game up again a few days ago so far the DCs have been pretty rare. Usually just the odd salty survivor who is about to be hooked and killed anyway.
---
Haha the killers are so screwed going up against an "armed" ash
---
They can only really implement punishments when they finally start using the dedicated servers. Because then they know morecertainly when somebody dcs by will or by something else.
---
You pay 60bucks a year to get it for "free".
---
The higher the reps is usually the more the dcs
---
Yea 1 M is the max. You have to spend some bloodpoints now or you wont get no more
---
He is bald
---
Good thing I spent the entire million to get teachable perks
---
I honestly would do that and less BP or shards too for the next few games.. It happens nearly every game. If you're killer it's boring and if you're survivor it's immediately a really really tough game if the killer tries or boring farming.
---
I dont get it
---
Eh most online games don’t make a distinction, ragequit, power outrage, pulling the cord, all usually punished the same way. Though you are right dedicated servers would help
---
Harder Daddy
---
Thats always a smart thing to do
---
Sexehy Beast you  mean
---
All the time for me, was about to get the adept trapper trophy but got DC'd by this right before downing the last survivor.
---
Shadowborn.
---
When I play I consider getting 15000 or more bloodpoints a win.
---
He's not wearing a Hat. That's his hair.
---
Yeah the desire to only fight F-B tier killers can drive some survivors to ragequit at the mere sight of the meta killers. What are ya gonna do *shrug*
---
why tf is she stabbing people with a vibrator
---
Jumper cables
---
Are you sure about that?
---
Decreasing the time would be broken if she has add-ons though.
---
Look at each Tapp's face.
---
What happened was that my friend was playing as Ash but then we all decided to switch to Tapp. Thus weird posture/look.
---
Correct :)
---
Thank you
---
Oof, I know that feeling
---
Ohhh yeahhh

"Baby killer cry now get gud get rekt" seems legit like an official dbd admin

Not immersed though
---
Step one: watch [this video](https://youtu.be/KqwwDJV9v2E).
---
Step two: watch [this video](https://youtu.be/VPr_bQdVkj0).
---
Step three: equip Windows of Opportunity and start paying close attention to pallet and window spawns in your matches. Also pay attention to which pallets are safe and which are unsafe. 
---
Step four: play some matches with all this stuff in mind and practice. It takes time, but once you understand the fundamentals of looping you’ll notice you start to last way, way longer in chases.
---
I assume you're having problems when you're chased? Try Windows of Oppurtiny (Kate Denson teachable) to learn the maps/loops. I'd recommend Dead Hard (David King teachable) and Lithe (Feng Min teachable) as helpful perks in chases, though it's easy to rely on them during a chase and fail if you cannot make use of those perks (due to exhaustion status effect or whatever).
---
I wouldn't necessarily recommend Object of Obsession (Laurie Strode teachable) as it's usually used by trolls and killers tend to ignore them rather to go after them. No Mither (David King teachable) is a better bait for killers.
---
It's funny, this is the first survivor that hasn't blocked messages from others. Usually when I'm playing survivor and someone disconnects, I try and message them asking why because I'm genuinely curious, but literally 99% of them block messages. Fitting.
---
“We are pleased to announce the Jason Voorhees skin for trapper!”

More like "LET ME OUT"

---
Might be easier said than done but get yourself enough people for a kill your friends and play sincerely in those games. This way nobody can become a burden because no BP. 
---
I am not good either but it helped me to at least try out stuff and analyse what I'm doing wrong
---
Do you not know what a meme format is?
---
A rat
---
I run no mither in purple ranks.yet my team mates body block me so they can heal me.
---
LOL
---
Honestly it would be neat in generally to get a killer that plays a bit more with the mine and metal works angle, since Trapper does not really tie into his own backstory.
---
As nurse i got 8 hooks and still got the trophy, is 8 like the minimum?
---
What if you had dark sense and were rancor. Would you  just never know until the 5th gen?
---
This shit is the one thing that I absolutely despise the most. Are they so sad in life that they have to ruin other people’s experience? And worse, the killer even went along with it? I get it, it’s a free kill for him, but still. If I see any intentional sandbagging, I’ll happily facecamp and tunnel the piece(s) of shit that did it.
---
I do enjoy playing pig but I always only get 1 or 2 sacrifices
---
They fixed it already right?
---
That's what I was going to say
---
Wraith should be one higher. 
---
Huntress easily is among top 3 for me, once you know your angles it‘s over, pretty much a similar skill ceiling as Nurse.
---
Well yeah, thats straight tunneling at that point, I play killer and i try not to go for whoever has been unhooked unless they run into me, at that point if they have BT ill probably let them go because i like to try play as fair as I can on both sides
---
Of course they „can“. It‘s still pathetic.
---
Suckers! I got it for free cause I sold my dota 2 skins that became worth 10 dollars from 5 years agoooo!
---
Thanks a lot for the tip, ill try it out
---
I love this idea, but imagine getting three gen'd with two killers walking around. The map pressure they'd have at that point is terrifying.
---
So don’t buy the skin? What’s the fucking problem?
---
That's shitty.
---
I mean i run franklins specifically so survivors waste their time coming back for items when they could be doing useful things like objectives
---
/r/justa
---
The team and the killer must have been confusion
---
I think we both are wrong, this outfit doesn't seem to exist in any image I searched and the closest ones are the red t-shirt that you correct me and a purple shirt with arm cuffs (don't know if that's the word tho)
---
It seems soo familiar, my memories are confusing 😂
---
My team mates do this every time. Whereas my friends won't do it all. They rather fucking die. Both are stupid
---
Mad cuz bad
---
You wear them indoor when playing games too?
---
Chainsaw can reach over pallets irl Tho....
---
Oh yeah, no headphones would have made this a nightmarr
---
Thats still not a reason to stop dcs, you should get a 15 minute penalty for quitting when you should never dc in the first place
---
I seem to have missed something, what skin is this about ?
---
Maybe Nea can be the witch. Or quentin
---
Because these days survivors refuse to do gens at all as long as ruin is up. I can understand not being good at great skill checks but these people won’t even tap. Shit, even if tapping is boring just work through the damn thing.
---
with that survivors you can be the nicest killer in the world and them just complain literally anything
---
That’s kinda creepy
---
Yea its ridiculous just deal with it if you die, its a big part of the game.
---
Literally impossible.
---
Some sorta bug, game is now full of them
---
This is making me uncomfortable
---
Are you playing on console?
---
Why the fuck are people downvoting you?
---
Yes im playing on ps4
---
The youtubers are currently playing a beta of reworked Freddy which will come out in a couple of weeks. In the meantime if you want to have a faster translation, the block addons are the way to do it.
---
Wtf
---
Shut up Nerd!
---
Exactly, I have 50 Moris on my nurse waiting to be used, I rarely use them and really wish I could do something with em
---
OMG i thought the rework out already. Thank you for the answers
---
NP.
---
True, which is why ive thought to neuter their chasing ability. If it proved too strong, maybe Legion lobbies could see an extra generator on the map?
---
give me the tutorial survivors as a team. they won't crouch around the map while someone is being chased.
---
Do bones
---
I'm fine with it costing money, in fact I thinks it's a good thing because it's more funding for BHVR to work with and keep their business and this game running smoothly. However, I do think it's weird that buying an outfit would cost more than the character herself.
---
this makes me sad :(
---
I love it!
---
Ok its because youtubers are playing his rework version on pc on the ptb (public test build). Console still has the original freddy whos ability is to bring survivors into the dream world. How this works is they perform repairs, healing and opening the gates slower. To get out of the dream world they need either another survivor to wake them who isnt already asleep or they can miss a skillcheck on a gen or their own heal. Survivors in the dream stated aura will be revealed to you when outside of your terror radius. The rework you have seen is basically a different killer when compared to the current freddy.
---
What’s the other side look like. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
And why is that good?
---
yeah the problem in balancing solo survivoring is that swf becomes insane. Create two differents queues for swf and solo survivoring, with differents stuff (like bond always active in solo survivoring) has the consequence that not a single killer will queue for a swf game.
---
You really expect someone to be "civil" back when treated unfairly?
---
Yeah i understand that
---
No fucking shit dumbass.
---
I think it’s just a glitch when you don’t die by it reaching zero you are suppose to even when searching
---
That's a shame
---
yeah the dc is insane. if you are solo survivoring and a teammate dc or attempt the escape at the hook just to suicide himself the game is over at my ranks and your ranks
---
Yeah, and if I buy any cosmetic that's probably what I'll do.
---
Complaining about gen rushing is as silly as complaining about a perk that gives you pity kills.
---
Probably a de-pip, too.
---
Considering these guys aren’t paid to do this and are doing this because they like the game, yes, I do.
---
Inb4/whoosh but did you mean a pink mori?  They don't come in purple.
---
Wow edgy
---
I basically just got this game for xbox, only had it for about one month now and made it to rank seven killer before rank reset and rank nine survivor. It’s honestly not as hard as you say, I got up there mostly by playing wraith, trapper, and doctor
---
That make zero sense. What does the doing this for fun habe anything to do with them treating people fairly?
---
It's because of the double bloodopoints and 3rd anniversary event. People farmed a lot of BPs and now are using all the shit they bought with it \^\_\^ that's at least my opinion
---
Sounds like a you problem.
---
I play survivor a lot and pink insta heals (at least to me) are very easy to come by lately.
---
Thank you. Most people don't get it;
---
Why should itbe free? This game needs to be profitable you know ;)
---
I can hear the voice from the samination animations...
---
Same thing for me some Kate showed me someone in a locker when I was legion so I looked at the locker and turned away and went after that bitch lol
---
That makes it a good perk.
---
Probably because that's the only ultra rares Billy can get since he has no ultra rare add ons.
---
Insta down vs Insta heal war, huh? Remember there's 4 survivors and one killer. Insta heals really need nerf.
---
 It's a very annoying bug
---
Oh thats how you drop things o.o
---
**Z A  W A R U D O**
---
Not sure about IOS.  For android just Google dead by daylight mobile apk.
---
Of course I expect it. Because it's human decency. Do you also insult people in real life if you think they treated you unfairly?
---
Grow up and handle negative things like any other adult in the world.
---
Leatherface in a suit
---
Prison suit Myers 
---

---
Nea.
---
Learn the maps, watch ohtofu map breakdown videos. That's all looping is, is knowing where to take a chase and waste a killers time.
---
eh I honestly disagree and think they are fine annoying as hell to deal with but I always bring franklins anyway as that counters really any item a survivor can bring in the game but that is my opinion on it

Mori Is referring to a series of killer offerings that allow the killer to preform a murdering animation on a survivor, killing them and removing them from the game. Moris don't show up on the offering screen but the only other "secret" offering is shroud so 98% of the time it's a mori.  They come in 3 Rarities; ultra rare ebony (pink) rare ivory (green)  and uncommon Cypress (yellow). Ebonies and ivories require that you hook the survivor at least once before you can preform the mori. Cypress requires that it's the last survivor in the trial, whether that be because you killed the other 3, or they escaped and you caught the last person before they made it out doesn't matter, as long as no other survivor is in the trial. I hope this has been helpful.

Billies are usually quite nice and gimmick imo O.o And Clowns are super assholes

Yeah that's right, that's me baby

Thank you :D Im gonna buy Leather Face later today and go from there and most definite I need Ruin to slow it down Just a little bit ;)

I made a mistake and ranked up while playing billy, iam almost at my previous rank ;(
---
I use PWYF but sometimes even when the kill prompt shows up, my myers does a basic attack instead of a kill. I almost got it once but i downed my obbession instead of killing them.
---
So dying light didn't go off.
---
His addon allow him to see your aura.

If I could upvote more than once, I would.

Hope shrine of secrets will be kind.

Wow! Impressive!!

With addon he can still see aura.

I bet that hillbilly is raging
---
Pretty much, yeah.

can also shave shards to get hag for free as well shes a fun killer
---
Aww thanks cutie!
---
he loses having a dank looking pig
---
I just have a lot of feelings 😭😭😭
---
I mean obviously, if I dont win the other team must've cheated somehow, I mean how dare they.
---
I hoard my stuff. I always try to hit up a chest or grab some dead guy's shit on the way out. (I don't pick up dead people's items mid game cause it's always bad luck for me and I'll most of the time end up getting cooked)
---
Fair. It’s probably just differing perspectives since i’m mostly a survivor main. I like seeing at least one person get out and killers are usually content with a 3k so i don’t see the problem but some killers would feel cheated if you dc for it. That’s one of the reasons i don’t but i do understand why some people do.
---
Wooo, dont forget the Gruesome Gateau! Gotta get all the Diabetes we can!
---
Meg mains havw big brains but focus all of it towards seeing where the pallets are to throw them down 50 minutes before the killer sees us /s.
---
i hate that argument
---
Its slightly above the price of the $10 auric cell pack, so you have to get the 15 one
---
Your looping was.....excellent enough for that killer. Honestly I could watch people loop like that but never pull it off myself.
---
Since I play nothing but Myers, I get so many T3’s in a single match, but I’ll still save it just to pop it on that one dickhead
---
Nobody got time for time fo that

I don't know what causes it but they need to fix it

I got mad watching this

He’s balding. That’s why, bitch.

once the exit gates are powered it is every man for themselves

That EXACT locker I glitched someone on top of.

I grabbed them out as they were exiting it and they appeared downed on top of it

See your confusing a free to play/$40 save the world game and a $30 indie game, in the free to play a $20 skin that you can earn by playing is way better then a $15 skin that you can’t earn period. You also can get into fortnite for free whereas dead by daylight is a pay wall to get in then pay walls for each dlc and then paywalls for skins. Eventually enough is enough

Fatass leatherface in a nutshell
---
Me and my wife play together. A doctor slugged my wife literally next to a gate as I was doing a gen on the other side of the map. I finished it just as he got there and my wife popped up with adrenaline and had enough time to open the gate while I was in chase running to her. I took a hit on the way but yeah hairy moments really make the game.
---
Why does the red stain look so big?
---
If you're locked into a healing animation, press shift or one of the emote buttons to break it. Doesn't help what happened to you yesterday, but, it could help in the future.
---
Personally I’d love to see wraith, but that’s just my own biased request as a wraith main :)

As a League of Legends player for 8 years I cant help but laugh at people getting mad about something like this.

---
More like garbage killers
---
This is a super lowkey opinion, but sometimes I think killers shouldn’t even have skins since killers don’t even see them in actual matches (apart from the weapon). Sure, the survivors see it, but then it’s like you’re buying it for them instead of yourself.
---
I really don't understand the baby Dwight meme.  I play Dwight and I'm usually the one trying to take hits for people.  I mean I'm a shit survivor but I try

It’s £7.50 in the UK but I would prefer if it was £5 instead!

This is a repost

&gt;I think it's more of just a disgusting practice. $15 for something you never truly own and isnt real. Account Banned? Money wasted. Not buying it is a response to it but it's borderline exploitative to have happen in the first place. idk, just ask yourself is it actuallly werf
---
All of your perceived grievances are unavoidable. You do not truly own most games you buy on steam, just a license to use the product.

Yes a 'virtual skin' . It's ok if you get angry if a character is costly. But it's a cosmetic.

You are very out of the loop with BHVR then. You know what happens when they get funding? They abandon DBD to go make a new game and give up on it when no one wants to play it then come back to DBD and continue to fuck everything up to the point of the game being unplayable and instead of spending their resources fixing these issues they decide to focus their resources on expensive cosmetics or things no one asked for.

"gg ez baby killer"

r/dbdgonewild exists you know
---
EVERY GOD DAMN GAME I GET 1 OF 3 KILLERS. GIVE ME A NURSE PLEASE. I JUST NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN PLAGUE, GF, AND LEGION. PLEASE. AND IF ITS NOT THOSE THAN ITS BUBBAH OR BILLY
---
There are people that play games, that have a VERY heavy emphasis on audio cues, and hushed noises to play properly. And they blast music over it. The amount of times I've opened a .ttv players stream, and seen people just blaring music over their game is frustrating. These are the same people that play swf, and bitch when you don't want to farm, or generally play killer efficiently.
---
Ghostface in s tier is insane, clearly you’ve never been camped by a stealthed ghostface on the hook
---
Like a working game? Oh the shame that we expect that considering how much we paid for the base game.
---
So what is a beginner supposed to do? Lose every match with shit perks, items, addons and offerings until they miraculously gain bloodpoints and shards out of nowhere? You do realize you get less bloodpoints and exp if you die quickly right?
---
What I said in my post remains true. This game is unbalanced and very hard FOR BEGINNER SURVIVORS. Put that upper rank bs aside. Why am I even getting paired against such powerful killers at shit rank 18? I even followed some of the tips posted in this thread and I still didn't win a single match.
---
You are nothing but a toxic f@ggot upset because I said something bad about your favorite game. Go be a loser somewhere else if you don't know how to reply to genuine posts like an adult.
---
Him and H3H3 do the same shit with their eyebrows I swear. Maybe he has Tourettes
---
Nice costume! Just a question. Why are you using “ä”?
---
What's tunneling?
---
Well, with the current pip system you can have a game where the killer gets no hook at all and you will get no pip. Imo an escape should guarantee a pip. 
---
Btw a care a little bit about rank only because I have the illusion that I could find better team mates... But ye, most part of the time is just an illusion...
---
I love the saw!!!
---
So tru3
---
Eh eh yea boi
---
It's easy to blame the lagswitcher but they are simply a symptom of a bigger problem, a complacent developer.
---
 Why is the red stain so huge?
---
Don't know who H3H3 is but now I'm curious.
---
THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION FRIEND, I THINK IT'S PEBBLE TIME TODAY
---
Csgo has a trading market. The way you view weapon skins and money is completely different
---
Comedy youtuber who has nothing to do with dead by daylight. But his name is Ethan and he has Tourettes which makes him do that with his eyebrows.
---
*unzip and start suckin*
---
If the licensed content/skins were cheaper I’m sure more people would buy it, then they would probably earn more than what they are getting for a $15 skin
---
Outplaying that killer lol
---
I have 600 Hours of this game played. That's more than I've played in most AAA Titles that I bought for 50-60 Euros.
---
If you bought this game for 20-30 $ and you think it's a travesty that a completely optional item is 15$ then you really should think again. Maybe it's not worth that much to you, but for somebody who spent as much time as me in this game (Or let's be honest, there are people that spent way more time on it) it's not that bad.
---
Plus it's completely optional. If you love the skin as such you can play surv and see him occasionally, the difference as the pig itself is only the blade...
---
If they buffed it to clean totems faster I would always use it.
---
Me a lot
---
Oh my! If you were the one giving it, thank you!! Wow I really didn’t think this quick cosplay deserved that much love 😅🖤
---
Didn’t everyone beg for a Pig skin?
---
Just dc and waste the guys offering. 90% of the time someone brings an offering to that map they’re a swf group all running balanced landing. They know how survivor based that map is and they want to bully a killer
---
*öinks*
---
What? I mean, he's not good, definitely, but he's still a 4.6m/s killer now. His Frenzy may be useless to down people (that's actually the point), but it enables him to basically assure first hits and maybe even distribute some damage, which makes some survivors waste time mending and maybe healing.
---
Downing people is a different beast altogether, you basically can't really on his power, becoming a regular M1 killer who has to deal with loops. However, the fact that you can guarantee you're gonna at least injure people still makes him better than any other pure M1 killer who doesn't have an assured first hit, like Wraith.
---
In the higher ranks, he's arguably  even more viable than Plague, since he at least has some mobility. (And that's obviously assuming higher rank survivors who don't clean up against Plague and thus reduce her fully to a powerless M1 killer as well.)
---
Thanks! :D
---
One of the best horror movies out there 🖤
---
That doesn’t mean no one wanted to buy it
---
I’ve seen a lot of people here point out they’re not getting it because it’s so overpriced
---
I can already see you getting banned by something that isnt your fault
---
true behaviour style
---
The mobile version is already available? Is it any good?
---
Honestly I really don’t agree there. I don’t think she’s the worst. But she’s not the best either. It wouldn’t hurt to buff her a little IMO but I really don’t think she’s that bad :3
---
yeah thats a good start, it only has good effect on the game, more totem cleansing, more points for survivors, and potentially a bit more time for the killer yet a nerf to noed (but in a good way)
---
:D 🍪

*dash me Mama ‘Manda! 🐽🖤
---
This is so good, laughed my ass off.
---
He is not the character from film, they just paid for the mask/costume, so he can have cosmetics like a normal killer i guess...?
---
Nah I believe ghostface is a licensed killer
---
Texas Chainsaw the Next Generation Leatherface, with all the horrible implications that come from that one. But that's how the sequeals took Bubba, and if that's how they want to look that's fine I guess. (I'm enby and its sorta gross and horrible more than the usual level of horror movies but yeah Leatherface is a transvestite I guess)
---
And I guess family dinner Leatherface in the suit and stuff that he does the little "I missed with my chainsaw!" dance in in the end of Texas Chainsaw.
---
HADDONFIELD SAYS HI!
---
noob saibot leaked as next licensed killer
---
The real pro strats.
---
aight no fun allowed i guess lmao
---
I actually did it as soon as I got to know about her cosmetics! I’ve been holding onto this photo for a while now, just waiting for her release! :D
---
But yeah both are out so go get ‘em! I had people compliment my piggy a lot yesterday when I played with her new cosmetics :3
---
Please help I don't see it 😭
---
I meaaaan if you were a nice Dwight I’d smack you down then carry you around and start memeing with you C:
---
I always let one person go through hatch yesterday playing as her. I chose one person to adopt and joke around with! Was way more fun than I’ve had in a long time! :D
---
This pleases the ***Bill***
---
This
---
🖤
---
I tried it but she kept healing me so I didn't have the chance to run and the killer came super close. But thanks a lot for the advice!
---
It absolutely is overkill but if you can't see it anyways, why buy it? 😅
---
*thanks in oinkies 🐽*
---
And that's how you depip
---
No wonder the tier 3 lunge is so huge when the knife becomes that big
---
Yes! Both Amanda’s skins and Tappi boi’s are out! :D go get ‘em! They’re amazing!
---
Nobodies asking for it for free, but the skins shouldn't cost 2-3 times as much as the characters do, it's stupid and scummy.
---
My brain read this in an accent and it took me forever to figure out why.
---
I did actually make a new Susie mask and threw on a red leather jacket and used my blonde hair for it ^ ^ it was interesting.
---
Dbd puts you in a weird spot
---
Just find some friends to boost the achievement, that’s what about half of those with it did.
---
Cool! ^ ^
---
I’ve no idea where it’s from as I got it from my sister after she passed away 🖤
---
Honestly when I first saw it I thought "That isnt fan art they just ripped that straight from the game and added a background!" And then I thought " oh shit that's just a really good drawing"
---
The top left hand corner in the window/door
---
How did she manage to capitalize the K in Krueger and not the F in Freddyyq
---
you’re part of the problem man.
---
Cool drawing but not realistic the survivor should be running in a circle by a pallet until the get hit once then dc
---
Cant wait for those dedicated servers
---
I think it’s from the Danish store H&amp;M.
---
My condolences.
---
Revealing is broken af, any objects at all and the reveal would be broken
---
I would like an ultra rare for her that makes her 110 or around there and only gives her 1 blink with a heavy fatigue it would be cool if the ultra rare changed her playstyle up like other killers ultra rares do
---
I play as survivor on PS4 because the framerate and hit detection as a killer on the PS4 is bollocks. 
---
They need to optimise the PS4 one better but instead we are getting a shitty Mobile port and a Switch Version?
---
If they can't fix the main systems why port it to lesser systems.
---
Niceeeee. Too soon too soon
---
LMAO!
---
Should I make a video as piggy doing a nurse mori now??? Hmmmm🤔🤔🤔:bigTHONK:
---
Gg Ez
---
The best thing about a Dwight is, he can either be toxic to the killer...or toxic to his teammates. Since he has bond usually, he can submit to the killer and become evil. I have met this Dwight many a time as killer.
---
Idk how we were toxic, we are close friends, we talk shit to each other all the time.
---
No solo survivor is stupid enough to body block, also he never says that lmao
---
It does remind me of Hoffman indeed!
---
After thinking about it though, I’m incredibly convinced this outfit is based off the scene with Amanda vs detective Eric in saw2!
---
🐽🖤
---
10 seconds after hooking a survivor, you gain a 3/4/5% speed boost for 10 seconds.
---
I love the skins so much :D
---
Thanks!🖤
---
So does it activate 10 seconds after?
---
I'm only a casual player and lurker on this sub so I don't really know how much some people reacted to make you post this, and given how the economy of DbD worked up until now, I'm clearly not expecting anything new that comes out to be free.
---
However to me it has nothing to do with if content is licensed or not, that's just how DbD worked from the start. One could even argue nothing is free since you first have to pay the game to play.
---
Just my grain of salt, as I said I don't really know who you're responding to.
---
Thank you! 
---
I made it on my own. It’s made out of plasterstrips! I do have a small tutorial of how I did it on my Instagram page ^ ^
---
Nice!!!!! Haunted Grounds is fun.
---
If you mean a low quality meme about either side being toxic and then being outplayed? yes, it has
---
If you mean megs being outplayed by bloodwarden? No.
---
Sorry for being negative but it feels like this is all what the subreddit is now, low effort memes and bickering between “mains”
---
“10 seconds after” where’s the confusion?
---
That must have been the PS4 sale that I wished I had more money to spend.
---
I got both the outfits ;3
---
I do plan on making the other outfit in the future actually! Just couldn’t finish it before the skin release so I went with what I had :D
---
literally all it does is make your character look different. 
---
If you dont like the price dont buy it, but clearly enough people are fine with prices otherwise they wouldn't keep making the cosmetics.
---
NiCe AiMhAcKs, RePoRtEd!!1!
---
No seriously, killers arent allowed to be lucky with something without getting accused of hacking.
---
WHY WON'T DBD DEVELOPE A PREVENT UNHOOK ACTION FOR DUMBFUCKS WHO SAVE YOU AFTER 2 SECONDS OF KILLER THROWING YOU ON A HOOK ?
---
Across the map tomahawk 😂
---
Good throw man :)
---
\&gt;Read name
---
not gonna bother with this one
---
Pretty accurate
---
Because of my first comment.
---
It used to be a 4k and then they changed it, which is incredibly stupid. It should either be
---
- all survivors escape - survivor adept 
---
- all survivors killed - killer adept
---
Or
---
- double pip - both adepts
---
Hahaaa I saw it today and it's hilarious :D
---
I do sometimes. I use it as a distraction from across the map and gen tap the outer sides. If 2 of my team die then I close in on the killer and just dodge him with sole survivor because I can see him but he can’t see me. It’s really good against Wraith when he is invisible
---
on top of that you can even sell your skins for actual money and usually get back most of what you paid for a skin if let's say you want to get a new, better skins.
---
Just fall asleep then you'll be fine.
---
YES BUT 90 PERCENT OF SURVIVOR PERKS ACTUALLY SUCK ASS!
---
Just started playing David, have done this 3 times already. Dead Hard is OP except 99% of people are ass at using it.
---
"But hey it could be a splinter right? Right...?"
---
And then you hear Yamaoka's Haunting.
---
I know what you mean but that's not what I meant exactly with my post. U know, most of the time I play With a friend with 2 randoms. So when one person is enough to help someone the other of us two tries to do gens and so on. It's like getting a special role for the round. So you do stuff to come forward, but it isn't enough to get a pip. And that's not fair in my opinion. If you say, someone does gens, the next one totems and so on, you will not be rewarded for a good strategy. It's like team play will be punished in a special way. Maybe you understand, what I mean.
---
Joke's on Trapper, she is hiding her fat grin because her sprint burst is ready
---
I’m experiencing this atm
---
I hope this means they are gonna start giving more costumes to licensed characters.
---
Oh wow, as a myers main they have put disgrace on our name
---
At least you don’t fight a rank 3 or something that always happens to me when I play killer and then I’ll play survivor for a daily and I get potatoes on my team lol
---
No just no too far
---
Trapper's removed his mask?! O: I've been out of the loop for a while, when did this happen?
---
Can I have the original picture without the caption at the top please?
---
No, it activates for 10 seconds immediately after hooking. It remains active for 10 seconds once someone goes on the hook, and then again once someone else goes in the hook
---
The reason their game looks like this is because this is on PC and the graphic setting are turned low. This allows for a brighter game and allows for the red stain to clip through walls. Honestly it’s pretty scummy thing to do to give you an edge in the game.
---
You want to bet that there are solo survivors who body block?
---
If only my game looked like that
---
The floor is lava
---
The reason he is easier to get away with skins is because the character ghost face from the movies isn’t actually licensed. Only the mask is licensed from what is I think some third party company lol
---
Oh and also, I have been paired against many higher ranked killers. Tell me again how that is fair. Is this how this community treats beginners? Shame.....
---
Dont do that
---
wait, so you can‘t get the achievement if someone dies by a RBT? that‘s so stupid...
---
i played the ptb for 2 days, and i can say.
---
He's aight.
---
p sure everyone wants skins for license killers
---
think it might depend more on what the license owners allow bhvr to do
---
She’s uncultured
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
I’m surprised that the hag dcd after you messed up at the killer shack pallet
---
brother u were right i thank u &lt;3
---
DON'T WORRY, I'LL CHASE THE NOOB WHO UNHOOKED YOU!
---
There is going to be new licensed content? Or you mean the pig skins?
---
But why? Didn't they fuck up by just YOLOing the unhook w/o BT?
---
thats what that is? first time ive seen it was binding of isaac
---
I think its when people swf the rank of the whole group is determined by the person who made the group. It also depends on how many people are waiting to join a game. If you really want fair matches you have to play when everyone else does.
---
Looks fantastic!! I love The Pig and I looove this cosplay!!!
---
yeah you’re right. but that doesn’t matter. the fact that it’s overpriced is a problem.
---
Funky Myers strikes again!
---
Acknowledge Bill as God
---
What is ttv?
---
How can it be, if it's literally 4v1
---
"WHAT NOW!"
---
If/when controller support is released it won’t be so bad, but yeah... at the moment I would never!
---
at the moment nothing is WAYYYY too op on one side but i was talking bout stuff like pre chande DS, Mettle Of Man, exept the nurse for pc, she is too op
---
its called cropping
---
Licensed from the costume maker, not the movie. It's why he isnt any of the movie killers, or why there are no survivors from scream.
---
It's called I'm on mobile and I don't know shit about cropping
---
I’d sign that.
---
Then again it's a Coldwind Farm and all of the chases are probably going to be hard.
---
There is a button to looks directly behind you during chases. It helps with keeping an eye on the killer, with out having to actually turn your camera.
---
I played several rounds last night i only came across one ruin out of all the killers i faced but then again it is rank reset currently rn.
---
\-Platform: PC
---
\-Type of Bug: Ingame
---
\-Description: Action progresses bug (shows more progress than is truly done).
---
\-Screenshot / Video: Video here on another post I made  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ces0sv/so\_is\_the\_gen\_done\_yet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ces0sv/so_is_the_gen_done_yet/) 
---
\-Steps to reproduce: Not completely sure, but most likely it occured after i quickly stopped doing gen and ran away from it or after i somehow qucikly tapped it.
---
\-Expected result: See all progresses as they are supposed to be.
---
\-Actual result: Progresses are increased by each survivor that participates on any action (healing, repairing, etc.).
---
\-Reproduction rate: Happened only once.
---
Not about the numbers, some killers/perks/builds are clearly bettet than others, and while thats the case we will never have balance
---
go into your gallery/photo store app, click/fullscreen the image, and therell be some simple editing tools
---
If killer is tunneling, I do bodyblock
---
But the highest rank they had was a 12. I  played as survivor just before I went killer and I'm rank 16 after reset and everyone in the lobby was in 1 rank of eachother. Survs in that lobby was 16, 15, 15,14 and killer was 15.
---
If you have IOS you can change your region to Denmark and download it. That’s what I did, though I had to keep my region Denmark to get the update. Or at least change it back to Denmark when an update is released to be able to download it.
---
Hey! VSauce, Michael here!
---
dead before daylight is a masterpiece
---
My opinion She’s the best DLC to me She’s just really interesting and unique plus her perks canbe really fun
---
Pigs cosmetic is not even 15 bucks. You just need to buy for 15$..
---
Where are your lockers?
---
I mean hag doesn't camp because her power lets her camp without being there, so it's kinda redundant.
---
Thanks that was super fucking easy. I really have no excuse for not having known how to do that already
---
theres a first time for everything
---
#Guys why do I hear boss music
---
As you may have heard Freddys getting reworked. Another thing is you might see an old veteran, his name is William "Bill" Overbeck from Left 4 Dead. Hes getting patched into consoles in the mid chapter patch for us too.
---
Somethin still messed up
---
Well you’re not wrong there Third Seal is my favorite hex in the game especially with piggy but a swf4 man get so toxic and start teabagging every time something happens
---
Aside from venting, the point of these discussions is too spread awareness so it starts a fire that could potentially make headlines and lead to changes. Not talking about it and simply avoiding is will not solve anything as others purchasing these items will just encourage developers/publishers to continue such greedy practices. There are a lot of gullible players and new players who believe that this is the norm for this industry and just simply accept it.
---
claudette's in game ad cosmetic
---
Claudette: Ain't Nobody Got Time For That!!!
---
Tbh now that we got Pig's ones, I'm pretty happy with what we have.
---
I don't think Freddy's or Leatherface's skins would look too good (again, personal opinion) and Mikey looks perfect the way he is rn so any cosmetics for him are redundant.
---
I wish we could get a paper bag for Quentin tho, I'd really appreciate it.
---
Sure. And the company is allowed to charge what they please. Skins don’t affect gameplay anyway, so why bitch about it.
---
The fact that entire characters (Ash, Leatherface, Ghostface) are cheaper than one skin is absolutely insane. I’m fine with paying for a skin I want but $15 is out of this world:
---
Not a third party company, they’re actually the original owners of the Ghostface mask and where Wes Craven got the license from, too. It boosted its popularity so much that the “licensed” Scream Ghostface is the one with the black robes and all, but the mask is still owned by FunWorld (who also have some permissions to sell the mask + black robes costume bundle based on the Scream movie, but even theirs ain’t movie accurate cause the Father Death costume is part of the Scream license lol).
---
If your not on Ps4, if you are get bloodpoints and get her high enough to nab her teachables
---
Time passes on and Survivors learn the Doctors plays.  Doctor is getting weak now.  and because of Endgame, Pig is looking weak now
---
Well why do they need to say it remains for 10 seconds twice. I just laughed a little.
---
So the mask already existed before the movie?
---
How is it being overpriced a problem. What do you lose by not buying it. Your character doesn't look as cool as you want them to? It doesn't play any differently. You aren't entitled to have the cosmetics be at any given price. They could charge $100 if they wanted to, even though thats likely a bad idea because very few people would buy that.
---
IMO the game should have a balance method for SWF. 
---
I play mostly solo survivor, at mid to low ranks (11 atm) and I die EVERY SINGLE GAME. Its becoming very frustrating to play, especially since its not only me who dies, but the killer wins with 4k every game. I'm keeping track of my games and in my last 10 games exactly 1 survivor escaped with the hatch, all other were a 4k for the killer. 
---
This prompted me to start playing killer and I was amazed at how easy it is. I got a 4k in my first game as killer and I don't think I've ever had a game where more than 2 survived. And I play different level 1 killers with 1 default perk (dont want to spend my bloodpoints on killers.)
---
Also as killer I'm getting double the bloodpoints on average, which makes farming them much easier. Since I have not played for ages, i still have to level my survivors and it takes ages to get the shared perks unlocked ...
---
So at my rank (low-mid) the game is frustratingly imbalanced. My idea would be to introduce a balancing method for SWF. For example: If 2 players queued together (SWF), gens will complete 10% slower, and then scale this up for 3 or 4 players.
---
And then obviously rebalance the game in such a way that both SWF and Solo are at least winnable.
---
Also how come people on my rank always have level 3 BBQ and Chili, Hex:Ruin and NOED, while I run with far from optimal perks because i'm lacking bloodpoints.
---
They obvs didn’t read the guide on how to be a good killer made by survivors. As a killer main I can say I can recite it off by heart.
---
Uhhh how many hours have you played?  Do you realky think you have an understanding of the game?
---
And when you kill them they call you a noob in the chat
---
you’re heavily simplifying the situation. yes you’re right you do lose anything by not buying it. but if people do want to buy it. they shouldn’t have to pay $15 to get a skin that isn’t worth the price.
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
Yeah you sound pretty salty.
---
Stuff like this happens, apparently the games pretty buggy right now. I heard something about black auras of survivors randomly appearing to killers.
---
Just wait for a fix or play with it.
---
I love the sound of this build and would you still go well make it over burrowed time?
---
It is possible to get adept when someone dies from a RBT because I was playing against a pig who was doing the achievement and one of my teammates died to it. Pig still got the achievement
---
Nurse isn’t too op on pc. If you’re a console player you may think that but as a pc player myself, she’s not too op. She is a very high skill cap killer which makes her strong ability very rewarding when you’re a good nurse. However it is very easy to make a misplay as nurse and survivors can easily just run all over you
---
I don’t know if they got ruthless or merciless because I’ve seen people get the achievement with a ruthless. Whether it’s a glitch or not idk
---
That doesn't change the tier though.
---
Could be a swf, and theres alot more red rank killers than survivors at this point in rank reset so thats why youll be matchmade against high rank killers
---
Then she got an irri in another catagory, or they got snapped while being dead on hook, i lost out because i had only hooked the survivor once before they got snapped
---
Could possibly give her more boxes so it’s less likely to be the first one they go to
---
Because those numbers will change once you get your perk to 3 instead of 1
---
The aura bit is massive. They usually appear when someone is fixing gens.
---
&gt; You are nothing but a toxic f@ggot upset because I said something bad about your favorite game. Go be a loser somewhere else if you don't know how to reply to genuine posts like an adult.
---
Ah, the ultimate "If you can't prove them wrong, get personal" denial proof. My comment may have been harsh but *you* are the one who immediately insults everyone who doesn't comfort you. That's one way to show people that you're not willing to have a mature discussion.
---
Have a nice day!
---
I know, i was there as well, and i very deeply miss it because back then, we didnt need to worry about a very finicky ranking system
---
Yep ^^ can google it easy
---
U just suck. Can't balance that.
---
Whether or not its worth the price is subjective.
---
But it's not our decision to decide the price.
---
Our only choice is buy or not buy.  
---
You dont like? You dont buy.
---
You like? You consider buying. 
---
License cosmetics are likely to be more expensive than others as the devs may have to share a cut of those cosmetic sales with the owners of license holder, depending on the devs deal with them.
---
 I understand that content creators should receive at least something from what they spend a lot of time and effort on, but I live in Russia. And in Russia, the music is free and no one makes you pay for it
---
just because you played against a rank 20 killer that most likely didn't know what they were doing at all, it doesn't mean you genrushed them
---
So it’s a bad play if the killer downs the person who’s just been unhooked. That’s a bad survivor play as the survivor shouldn’t be unhooked in front of killer. And if they are being unhooked have some support from other survivors or BT. But clearly not. You can’t expect the killer to start throwing the game and be like “ I’m not gonna kill you even though it’s an easy kill and your team are technically throwing, I’ll just let you live and possibly lose me the game”. It’s stupid the mindset you have
---
Should it be free? no
---
Should it be $15? no
---
this is so ignorant it’s insane. i bet you’re blind to bo4s problems too. 
---
you’re right, we don’t have a say in the price because we don’t work at the studio. however, as consumers we have a right to criticize and complain about the product we are about to consume.
---
What time of day are you playing? When i play at night there are less players so the matchmaking is bad. During peak times it has more players to match you with resulting in better games. Although you will still get the occasional SWF with vastly different rankings.
---
Ah my bad
---
And you got the killer.  Is it your opinion that any skins that are created for the killer you should get for free?
---
Facts.
---
Yep my bad
---
I thought the red stain always clipped through walls?
---
i'm rank 7 right now and that killer was 9
---
💀
---
I’ve yet to see someone more smug than you, sweetie.  Don’t quit your day job.
---
It is still licensed, just oddly the mask. I honestly think its because they would have to choose between the alternative mask from the show with those survivors and the og mask from the makers.
---
Now I would kill for a Scream Queens killers and survivors.
---
This is so well done and I love your render of her diseased skin and the smoke
---
It just happened to me earlier. I kept trying to get the killer to kill me since I couldn't do much for my team except save them.  Unfortunately he was too nice and wouldn't. 
---
We had a whole conversation about it after game. I felt so bad for my team.
---
i refuse to believe that's a rank 9 killer
---
they most likely were afk the entire match or wanted to depip on purpose
---
No such thing as a toxic killer build, a survivor saying your build is toxic is translated to it being useful and makes the game harder for them.
---

Yesterday someone hooked someone and camped the hook until they died. I was standing right behind him so I couldn't unhook the person. I decided to make myself useful and do the generator that he was standing right next to. Somehow he didn't notice the sounds getting louder. Fixed the generator with maybe 3 seconds left until the entity would take my teammate. Killer came to look behind the generator and I unhooked him. Best play I've ever done. Campers succcccc.
---
No, they sat there not playing and then got fucked over by their teammate and then got fucked over by the killer, and not they still can't play.
---
Yeah his backstory is completely different than the movies.
---
Honestly, the problem for me is that it *isn’t* $15: it’s $12. But you can only buy auric cells in increments of five so it feels like you’re wasting three bucks.
---
I don't play bo4
---
I know its got a lot of micro transactions but thats about all I know about it.
---
I'd argue $15 is perfectly reasonable for high quality skin. I'd pay $15 for a skin if it was for a character I actually wanted it for. (dont play much pig)
---
Because it's nice to customize your piggy. I don't care if i can see it. I can see the drill drilling survivors and they can... Or can't see me sneaking up
---
Ruthless, would have been merciless if i got the additional hook points
---
&gt;Well, this is the new player experience of this game. It really sucks, but I can completely understand him. This game is absolute trash if you are a new player. Nothing is explained, the few tutorials the game has only teach the core mechanics, but most of it is forgotten while in the game.   
---
&gt;The game favours the killer in low ranks very strongly, because killer is fairly easy to play, while survivors don't even know how to spend their time in game.  
---
&gt;And then on top of that the community really sucks. Instead of giving tips or at least saying gg everyone makes fun of the noob ("ez", "git gud" and worse).
---
When somebody unhooks a survivor directly in front of the killer early game they have just announced that the killer will win because they are shit.
---
At that point the killer can either win by continuing to fuck over the person who just got fucked over by their teammate and win, or get the idiot who fucked over their teammate and then win. Win like an asshole or win not like an asshole, up to you.
---
That you have to buy half the characters individually also.
---
Protecting overpriced skins. Wow.

"Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plague the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Survivors would tell you. It's a Killer legend. Darth Plague was a Dark Lady of the Mist, so powerful and so wise she could use her Sick to influence the survivors to create death... She had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the survivors she hated from healing. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. She became so powerful... the only thing she was afraid of was losing her power, which eventually, of course, she did. Unfortunately, the survivors learned to live with her sickness, and she was robbed of her power. It's ironic...she could put others near death but never kill them herself." - Darth Biwwie
---
Is this price of $15 Canadian? Its 10€
---
you’re better off not playing it. 
---
and i disagree.  maybe $10 but not 15.
---
I get this and i'm on pc
---
That toxicity has been converted to text form.
---
I personally use Save the Best for Last, Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, and Hex: Ruin.  
---
Barbecue &amp; Chili and Discordance are also good perks to use if you prefer.
---
Well how about you go out there and make some quality content, champ?
---
It’s not the fact that you won’t get the cosmetic, it’s the fact all cosmetics are that much. And if people stoped buying them they would come down in price, but people buy them anyway.
---
I do agree this is unbalanced and unfair but it SHOULD BE UNFAIR! I read the whole post. Martin from GTA V with the description for slasher minigame is basically saying "Horror is supposed to be unfair." The Dlc killers are op because some are the main bad people. Myers killed anyone trying to stop him, Freddy killed anyone he deems right. And you can go up with killers with all 4 slots so stop complaining.
---
Nah, he also can get the shitty characters offerings
---
Meh, I like being in high ranks, but the sweet spot I have found for myself is rank 4-8, that is where I see a lot of good solo players. But i keep ranking up so I end back up at rank 1 as survivor and regret my decision to keep solo queing as survivor. But as killer now, I see a lot of potatoes at rank 1, it's really bad unless they are swf, then they give me a challenge.
---
Yes, it exists since the early 90s (1991-92 iirc).
---
Halo theme music intensifies
---
That’s like saying “Hitler killed millions, so me killed thousands is okay”
---
They shouldn’t be free but they shouldn’t be 15
---
My frustration stems from being downed first, hooked first and killed first. Whenever that happens I think the killer had it out for me. They haaate my Dwight for some reason. Bonus points for being chased and killed when there initially was a bunch of us survivors to choose from - awesome.    
---
Other than that running into deadends when being chased, running into easy to miss shrubbery between two trees or just trashcans right next to my initial crouching position. Killers hitting me inspite of the pallet hitting them. And the best for last - killers hitting me after I completed a full vault.
---
I know but is there any post about the entity being a girl?

Huh that’s interesting thx

---
they’ve never though of dedicated servers.
---
Yeah well half the licensed characters don’t have skins, and the pig has been out for a while and there just now doing this.
---
no one is complaining that its free. People are complaining that to buy both skins you need to spend a minimum of $25. I was ready with 20 bucks, but now I have to go out and pick up another steam card.
---
The people who are happy with the rework are mostly people who do not play Freddy.
---
For Freddy players this is just a new killer being added while your killer being removed.
---
I wish I could give you more upvotes.
---
Low graphics are better for focus and overall gameplay if that’s the audience’s problem
---
Lmfao y'all got smoked by one of the worst killers in the game, congrats
---
Got it
---
YOU DO UNDERSTAND BUBBA IS A NICKNAME FOR LEATHERFACE RIGHT?
---
If it's a big enough problem then people will speak with their wallets. No amount of voice will matter if the skin still sales like hotcakes.
---
If the skin doesn't sale well then the price may be adjusted and at that point the company will realize at what is too much for your player base.
---
I don't fully agree with his attitude but the underlying point is correct, don't buy the skin if it's price is too much. If enough of you do that then it will be adjusted.
---
GOT MY PUPPY A KIND OF PILLOW TOPPER THING FOR UNDER HER BED IN THE CRATE. CAME HOME ONE DAY AND SHE RIPPED IT AND PULLED ALL THE STUFFING OUT. 
---
MAKES NO SENSE, SHE LOVED THAT THING WHY WOULD SHE DESTROY IT? ARE YOU TOO GOOD FOR YOUR HOME?
---
hmm no matter you believe or not, i'm not lying
---
killer wasnt afk bcz my friend(obsession) was chased at that time, you can see the spider legs are shaking.
---
and im not saying like "i seriously genrushed and defeated a poor killer"
---
ive never seen gens are so so fast this much, so i just want to share my experience.
---
BHVR. We need this lewk as a Claudette skin!
---
Then why is it only one skin? If both were like 1200 id be like, okay they have animations and sounds, plus they are licensed. We have other licensed skins already for 1080, but ok fine. But like, its just one of the skins.
---
I'd love the ability to unlock the rest of the survivor faces on LF.
---
In the Mist he sang to me

---
Inside my locker OH FUCK NOOB KILLER GIT GUD
---
I think each person having to spend $30 on the game and having to buy 4/6 the characters individually for them to look stale is enough support from me. I’m not spending 60+ to have my characters look default and the only way to buy most of them is with money or playing the game for a very long amount of time.
---
The killer just didn't put out any pressure, so the gens were repaired quickly.
---
are they? I know a lot of people, myself included, had 20 bucks ready to go to grab both skins. Now we have to go get more, and some people just arent bothering
---
Game pass ain’t free bud
---
Thought everyone knew this. Low is the brightest with ultra as a close second.
---
You want to teleport to finished gens to cut survivors off and not to find them.
---
I use the teleport a lot for getting hits which does not work when most generators are done.
---
When all gens are done you need to deal with 4 people who can open exit gates.
---
You still need that mobility to stop them.
---
Am I the only that thinks the frenzy meter should decrease a little more faster?
---
Well said, that's kind of what I like about being killer, but certain matches against good and well coordinated survivors can be downright exhausting. It's fun but it's not for everyone.
---
Honestly?  I want them to give Leatherface every survivor's face as a cosmetic
---
If I can't run around as Big Bubba with Daddy Jeff's face then why bother playing him ever
---
That's exactly my point. The devs aren't going to drop the price because a few people on a reddit thread said they don't like the price of the cosmetic. 
---
So if you don't like it, dont buy it. If enough people agree with you then the lack of money coming in will speak more then their voices ever could.
---
If people buy it anyways, then why would the devs drop the price because a few people on reddit said they'd prefer it were cheaper. Everyone would prefer everything is cheaper.
---
I'll always go for the person who unhooked.  100% of the time.
---
If I can remember, I try to give the person who just got unhooked at least 30 seconds.  If I see them, I'll turn the other way and look elsewhere.  Everyone should get a chance to play.
---
When you DS the Killer as a generator pops and suddenly you see their aura. 😭😭😭😭😭
---
Why are you comparing fortnite to a game you have to pay to play? Fortnite costs more because there a free game and they need to make money. DBD is a $20-30 game and you still have to buy most of the characters, some of which are very strong.
---
I'm glad to see new DLC cosmetics for licensed characters ate starting too show up.
---
Im glad to hear that bro. Dont fall asleep. Freddy's cominggggg
---
I mean it’s kind of his signature thing, his emotes and sub images all use it. After close to 3 years of watching I’ve never seen him without it lol
---
"If you can't do it yourself better, don't criticise it" is one of the poorest and most aggravating arguments to constantly see people use. There's no basis for it and really just shows you have no real argument to give.
---
This kind of self-absorbed one-sided mindset is exactly the problem. It's not ONLY about YOUR fun, there are 5 people in the game. If you think you have the right to not play a match because someone is making you have less fun, then you have to agree everyone else should have the right to not play with people who will make the match less fun for everyone.
---
That's all I want. I don't care about "punishing" DC-ers. I just don't want to play with people who make the game less fun for everyone. And the easiest way to do that is to ban those people from public matching.

i actually got into a killer match my first try. played it through, and then its back to the ‘no internet connection’ message from yesterday. its still bugged
---
Then they wouldn’t need noed would they? But there’s no way of knowing if they have it or not, you could struggle through 5 gens barely getting them done just to get slapped in the face by noed.
---
Looking like White Diamond just got added as a killer.
---
I got it humble bundle a little bit ago, haven't downloaded or played it but if the microtransactions are egregiously bad then I'll probably forgo paying for them or playing the game all together if they ruin the game.
---
I can hear her in this image. I love it. Thanks OP, very cool.
---
The only licensed character with skins are the pig. Ghost face is a licensed costume not character. That’s why he has a different backstory. And yes, not buying it while because then they can’t pay back the owners of the characters and they will stop with this bs.

Ochido is hiding there from the devs

It comes out the 23rd
---
Right, but if they dont wanna year their luck with being gen grabbed, they’re gonna have to leave every time they hear the heart beat
---
I think they were hooked twice and died before their third, but I’m not 100%. That’s still annoying, the only time I’ve ever had anyone die from a trap was either:
---
1: didn’t know they couldn’t escape with it activated
---
2: didn’t know they could escape with it not activated and the collapse killed them
---
What the fuck have I just witnessed?
---
Such an annoying killer main, always whining
---
yep i know.
---
i just surprised that my teammates didnt do dull totems, boxes, sabo or just crouching somewhere and do nothing
---
And it’s $50 a year and you need Xbox live gold which is $60 nothing on the Xbox is “free”
---
Your first part is wrong your second is right. I ONLY play solo survivor and I bodyblock if necessary
---
Bruh, I need this Alma mod.
---
Sorry for this late reply.
---
I agree with you, I hate the rework since I put a lot of time into learning Freddy and he gets changed because people who play him wrong make memes about him and others listen to the memes without thinking for themselves.
---
I think Freddy was fine even without tweaks since I never had any problem while playing him.
---
I never had a game where people were able to open the exit games (unless I played endgame Freddy but then I just let them do it.)
---
They should keep old Freddy but i doubt they will do it since the community thinks that even do they never play Freddy they feel that they can judge if Freddy is weak or not and they feel like they know what all the Freddy players think.
---
(I hate posts talking about how Freddy mains are happy with the Freddy rework since all the Freddy mains I ever talked to despised it even more than I do.)
---
Pardon?
---
This rework has been over a 18 months in the making.
---
So your system is reward the survivors and give them another chance of winning for playing dreadfully. At shit ranks you can do this but at high ranks it’s a big no. Can’t reward players for bad plays, it’s the unhooker being an asshole not the killer. But either way I predicted you right, you whine post game chat because it’s always the killers fault for your bad plays.
---
Where is a simple saying, put your money where your mouth is. BHVR or any company don't care about few threads on Reddit as long as money is coming. If you don't want to pay 15-20 bucks for a skin in a year's time, don't buy pigs outfit now.
---
Your renting games.
---
Why even bother wasting time writing this essay to a dumbass who doesn't got any clue of what he's talking about
---
What's accurate about it? I down the majority of people I play against in less than 30 seconds. If I feel like facecamping them I'm gonna facecamp them. Someone's emotional state has absolutely nothing to do with the game. So why try connecting dots that aren't there? People play how they want to play. Feelings have nothing to do with it.
---
HAVING BORROWED TIME DOESNT MEAN YOU CAN SAVE ME ANYTIME YOU WANT IN FRONT OF GODDAMN KILLER, DAMN YOU!
---
This is a great idea and it's stunning no one at behavior has suggested this.
---
No one wanted it to be $15 tho
---
I remember I went into a phase where I binge-watched h3h3 videos and ended up subconsiously mimicking Ethan
---
It probably was the fast escape via gate ever.
---
Same drill: you stop paying for PS+ and you lose access to the game.
---
Can’t do this at good ranks, there’s a fine line between unhooking as a bad play and good play, yes the survivor will have DS and BT so going for unhooked is good, but late game of survivors farm each other you have to accept it or you’ll lose

I think what gets me is how it seems like people on this sub are announcing how much they suck at this game. Like until rank 7 or so, I barely have to try as a killer unless I run into a random swf team that sandbagged. The overwhelming majority of games are so killer sided it's ridiculous.
---
Then even beyond rank 7, it's still really only the swf teams that you have to actually be toxic against, whereas when you face solo survivors you finally simply have to actually try a little bit. Yet people try to respond with all these "but it's strategically correct to do x" and I'm like "even assuming you are at rank 1, you still get kicked back down at rank reset and would know that it's not necessary. The fact that you can't seem to acknowledge that there is a difference suggests you never manage to get to where that switch in skill requirement is, which means you probably suck and shouldn't be so trying to lecture about strategery."
---
You are right Freddy was not mid tier.
---
He was under nurse,billy,spirit and hag but above the rest.
---
Since his power was great and not map depended like huntress/hillbilly.
---
No ones saying it should’ve been free. But it’s shouldn’t be 15 on a $30 game either.
---
they have weapons locked behind paywalls, and the game can get unbalanced as hell. if you want to play it go ahead but expect times of anger lol
---
Fuck self care, its utter garbage and only wastes time. There's no such thing I hate playing solo survivor as useless teammates spending half a generator healing in a corner of the map just to be downed in 5 secs because they can't loop
---
Run, because I didn’t know there was 2 killers on the map
---
The first gen is almost inevitable, and after the 2nd is done the last 3 come right after. If you can defend 4 within 9 minutes you might get iridescent, just maybe
---
That's not a connection issue, it's a hitbox issue.
---
The worrying part about that is that he was Ghost Face in the first film 😂
---
&gt;satisfying clap noise from across the map
---
That's actually Jane running around.
---
they said the same thing about black ops 3 supply crate system. if you don’t pay for extra crates then they will be fixed. but it never happened. it’s most likely the same case here.
---
I'm experiencing the same issue
---
Great. Saving a million blood points to learn his teachable day 1.
---
When you buy a game for $30 and get less than half the characters.... hmmm.
---
if only it was 5 charges, or had a way to regain them. (be in TR, like pebble or stakeout)
---
It actually is up to us, it is how basic economics work something that seems to be lost on you. No cosmetics in games should be this expensive even if it is optional when I already have to pay 5 dollars for most of the new characters. And considering a majority of the killers are not licensed I find it laughably ridiculous, in Path of Exile I can spend about $20 and get quite a bit of different cosmetics and not just one skin, in League of Legends same thing, and note both of those games are FREE.
---
If you think it is okay for a game to try and push $20-$30 skins on players when you already have to shell out $20 for the game on top of the additional $5 for each new character unless you want to grind for fucking ever trying to get a new character with iridescent shards then you are really confused.
---
I am not saying they should be free, but if a game like League of Legends can get away with finding alternative ways to get skins to people without having to shell out big dollars then a game like DBD that is already charging a decent amount of money to just play the damn thing should have ACTUAL alternatives than having to spend money to get skins, or at least adjust the prices to be more sensible. Hell even if it is just random rolls R6 can get out skins to the players too without them having to spend a dime, and they do the same shit with making people spend money to buy the newer operators with actual money unless you want a grindfest.
---
Buying the rift isn’t free.
---
Not for free, not for $15
---
It's more like not finding the capacity to shit your pants over something that is such an arbitrary luxurary that even the kid screaming at its mom for the candy bar at the grocery store has more of a right to be upset.
---
Going after the same survivor time and time again. Potentially ignoring other survivors
---
I mean I escape the overwhelming majority of games that I play as survivor, and the games that I don't I'm happy to say gg when the killer wasn't toxic to people.
---
And yeah, at higher ranks you start having to try, especially when you face swf. It's abundantly clear though that this sub makes no distinction between the two and plays toxic against people who basically run into you.
---
Why would you want to change something as great as that?
---
Bill coming out on console for free: Well yes but actually no.
---
Yeah its kinda Weird As a Killer 8 I always get ranks 2- 8. Almost never ranks 8 or higher than me like wtf ? 
---
Killer is harder plus you need to face better ranked Survs ? Lol plus SWF ? Pff still pop in a mori and time to have fun
---
David’s when they Dead Hard after they reach a pallet
---
Twitch streamer I believe, could be wrong
---
You get decent teammates once in a while, I guess.
---
Ohhhhh so that's why I didn't see any survivors in traps...
---
The Other Danish Guy or Hugo Boss underwear.
---
Its always either Myers, Billyboi, or Leatherbutt that lagswitch/camp, I swear...
---
Nice dress... bitch
---
CHEST LOOTING BUILD IS THE BEST NURSE COUNTER CHANGE MY MIND
---
Don't you already have Unbreakable, Borrowed Time, and Left Behind unlocked by default?
---
Hahahahhaa
---
Haha..
---
Ha..
---
Haha I was just thinking this today as I saw one of his Spirit videos. He really likes those closeups.
---
I MEANT THE STREAMER.
---
The entire point of his stream is that he plays everything.
---
Yup
---
his teachables we already get for free, they are borrowed time, unbreakable, left behind
---
He ran TL walls the wrong way, didn’t hide red glow, swung too early twice, went for chainsaw next to a pallet... Rank 20?
---
&gt;As a player of a game from a scummier and greedier company that's has been abused without complaining by their practices for 8 years, I can't help but laugh at people that can actually see the problem in a skin costing almost as much as the game itself.
---
You're part of what's wrong with the gaming industry nowdays.
---
Yes but that candy bar is $15 and the mom not letting him have it is bhvr
---
What's the point of saving 1 million bloodpoints unless you're going to p3 him then?
---
Never occurred to be how erotic a Nea can sound.
---
Once bill hits console his tea cables will be relocked and must be learned.
---
Ghostface in s tier? Lmao, ghostfaces are to most toxic pieces of shit I've ever seen. Always tbagging or camping you while hiding in stealth mode
---
Vote wraith for cutest killer
---
Nobody is forcing you to play a certain way
---
I have in breakable but not the other two, I deadass cant remember how I got it but u don’t get them by default (I’m on PS4 if that’s any help)
---
Im thrilled! Cosmetics are one thing but having exclusive characters is super weird to me and even though I have no attatchment to L4D I am excited for him
---
They can charge whatever they'd like and we can say whatever the fuck we want about it. Funny how opinions work.
---
I didnt mimic like all of his mannerisms but I loved doing his cough
---
Rank 20 vs mid tier survivors, yeah, blame killer instead of matchmaking.....
---
Entitled to have a fair game..?
---
Behaviour's pricing system is fucking disgusting.
---
Im gonna get that Meg Zoey skin....
---
Plague best killer
---
Same here, one of my first games I was in a locker and this Dwight pointed to my locker and the killer killed me. I was so mad I wanted to quit
---
He's not *wrong*, just an asshole.
---
Looks like they got caught shittin' in the tall grass.
---
she is almost impossible to survive against a good nurse
---
Honestly, as a new player with only 1 perk, it's more useful than most other perks. I hate seeing Self Care on rank 4-6 people, but it makes sense on ranks 10-20 where most people don't know how to work together with others so they need another source of sustain.
---
DS and MoM were both nerfed, Neither are a safety net unless the killer lets it happen.
---
IF THIS IS A TROLL ATTEMPTS NOT A GOOD ONE. BUT I TEND TO LIVE UNDER A BRIDGE TOO FROM TIME TO TIME SO I WILL FEED YA. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT NAME AND SHAME IS RIGHT? THERE IS NO LISTING OF THE PERSON'S NAME OR HIS STREAM ACCOUNT. JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU RAN INTO A PERSON STREAMING IS NOT NAME AND SHAME LOL.
---
Thanks for the response, I have been permanently banned.
---
I scanned the page and followed what it said, but it simply refers me to the support website which is what I have used multiple times. There's no official 'ban appeal' option from the ticket issue menu.
---
The comment could have been perceived as a real-life threat but the text itself did not go into anything graphic or extreme detail or even refer to a 'serious' threat against the player's life.
---
&gt;they have weapons locked behind paywalls, and the game can get unbalanced as hell. if you want to play it go ahead but expect times of anger lol
---
Having guns locked behind paywalls seems pretty dumb. Having DLCs that include lots of guns or guns and maps is okay but individual guns behind paywalls is pretty crazy.
---
yeah, i would like to get it with shards cause its $15
---
You're implying there are only 2-3 good killer perks?
---
There are 2-3 perks on both sides combined that have absolutely no value
---
Why doesn’t the RBT count as a sacrifice? It’s dumb
---
She doesn't have physics as such anymore :/
---
Dude L4D was one of my childhood games, fun just to be a charger and instakill. You should check out gameplay of it.
---
Just an overall dislike for streamers and their entitlement
---
Basic economics is that things are worth whatever people are willing to pay for them.  If enough people buy this skin to make BHVR profit, then it was appropriately priced.  If BHVR priced it so high that it doesn’t make a profit on sales, then the skin is too expensive.  Your subjective opinion on how much things should cost in this game is irrelevant to the economics of the situation.
---
Adrenaline is the one perk I will never use, it's for rank 20s.
---
Have fun lying about people you don't like for no reason
---
it is dumb, what’s dumber is that they’re even in the supply crates. and which each update they add new things into those crates making it harder to get the weapons.
---
Wym entitlement? I just have it in my name so my channel can grow, I have like zero viewers haha
---
You're a garbage person
---
Talk is cheap, damn near anyone can type the first thing that comes to mind.  Wanting someone to show how things can be better rather than just complaining about it is very reasonable.
---
Console gets Bill's teachables unlocked by default, but with different icons. That's probably going to change now that Bill is coming to console.
---
You do, shortly after the console release they went from Shrine only to default perks
---
Everyone says that but there aren’t any consistently good no add on nurses
---
It's removed 1/3 of all the pallets on the map if used correctly, and there is no survivor counter play other than "waste all the pallets"
---
I mean fortnite is free but you have to pay $20 for a skin sometimes if you really want one.
---
literally almost 1500 hours in the game, but nice try though kiddo
---
What kind of entitlement, exactly?
---
Huh... By any chance, are you on PS4?
---
If the Next Patches gives them a silent Nerf like Pig, it might.  Tiers do change after each Patch.
---
It counts as a sacrifice, but it wont count any hooks it skiped, say you down them for the first time, put the trap on their head, and dont hook them, When they die, you only get 1 hook credit, instead of 3
---
Clever.
---
Mk not gonna attack you just gonna go through your points and help you out here.  I get it, I remember starting this game and I had the SAME thoughts as you did.  I felt like killers were OP (especially Doctor; back then I thought "You can't beat him because he knows where you are 100% of the time!") and that there wasn't any chance for survivors.  But as someone with a lot more time in the game now than I did then, lemme give you my thoughts.
---
&gt;Imagine being level 1 survivor. You have only one perk slot. Most survivor's starting perks are already mediocre so it's no use brainstorming which one's good for the survivor you are playing.
---
Yes, survivors by and large have weaker perks than the Killer; this is meant for game balance.  It's a 1v4 situation; Killers need to be stronger than an individual survivor.  However, some perks are still really good; Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Bond, Leader/Prove Thyself etc etc.  All are beginning perks that are rather good in some capacity.
---
Also, if you haven't, do the tutorial.  You get enough blood points that you can level up and I think get to level 10(?) and unlock 3 slots.
---
&gt;Now the game starts, you wait patiently crouching near a pallet, to see who the killer is after. By some luck, the killer is far away from you, and you only learned that because you saw the aura of an already downed survivor. You make your way to rescue said survivor only to see another one of the survivors injured.
---
So this is actually a misplay on your part.  You shouldn't wait near pallets unless you're self-healing and still possibly being chased.  Always be either on the move or working on a gen/totem/heal etc.  If you're on a gen and the killer finds you, that means it's loop time!
---
&gt;Eventually, all hopes to complete even one generator are lost. No matter how much you keep healing each other, you get downed easily, because the killer is faster and for some goddamn reason knows exactly where you are hiding.  
---
&gt;Juking and looping? It doesn't work for long. The killer literally gains movespeed bonus because of bloodlust, can see where the survivors go because of scratch marks, and god knows what other unbalanced perks the game has reserved for killers.
---
Juking and looping can actually work for 5 gens depending on map setup and survivor skill.  There are Youtubers (no0b3 comes to mind specifically) who make whole videos about running a killer for 5 gens.  It's a matter of learning looping, understanding when to fake a vault and when to take and pallet conservation.  Even on one pallet if you run it correctly you can run around it 3-4 times before the killer catches up and you throw it, either stunning them or forcing them to decide between breaking it or continuing chase.  Killers gain 1 Tier of Bloodlust every 15 seconds and it breaks if they break a pallet or hit a survivor, so if you keep that in mind you can cancel out their Bloodlust with well-timed pallet loops.  Now if your teammates aren't doing gens while you're looping or you're not doing them while they are, then yes, the game is an inevitable loss.  Sad part about playing survivor; you rely HEAVILY on your teammates.
---
&gt;And don't even get me started with the dlc killers. Almost all of them have op perks that they start out with and powers that are hard to counter for beginners. Pig? Ghostface? Spirit? Hag? All of them op.
---
Two of the strongest killers in the game (Nurse and Billy) are free with the game, and once you put in enough time they don't even NEED perks to do well.  Now if we're talking about going against those killers, yes they can be difficult for someone new to the game, but not in a "they're overpowered" sense but in a "well newness means I haven't recognized strategies to counter them" way.  Every new game means having to learn new patterns of attack and defense and DbD is no exception.
---
&gt;Many of them also carry that hex ruin which requires survivors to locate and destroy the hex totem in order to complete the generators or perform perfect skill checks to get the generator working. Now do you guys really think this is easy for a beginner?
---
Only way to get better with skill checks is practice.  Additionally (and this is something no one taught me while I was learning and only recently understood) you can still finish a gen with Ruin up even if you can't hit skill checks.  Just go for Greats, but if you hit a Good skill check, stop working on the gen until the sparks go away and then get back on it.  It takes longer (depending on your RNG and how many skill checks you get) but it's faster than gen tapping and puts WAY more pressure on killer than you and 3 other survivors running around looking for a hex totem leaving the killer with no pressure.
---
&gt;How is the beginner survivor even supposed to level up? Getting 4K to 8K bloodpoints while the killer gets at least 20K isn't f-king fair at all either. Even in the lower ranks, these newbie killers play with the most toxic op builds while I am still struggling to level up, unlocking perks that will actually help me in some way.
---
Tutorial, will get you some good BP.  Also just playing the game and adding time and practice will make you better.
---
&gt;Overall, what I claimed remains true. This game is so horribly unbalanced and I doubt the developers are going to do anything with it. You people probably also think I am some noob who doesn't know hpw to play. I am expecting "git gud" or some other idiotic comment to a genuine problem this game has, but I don't mind it all.
---
Once you get to a certain rank, you'll understand the game IS rather unbalanced, but against killers.  Nothing like it used to be, Killer is WAY easier than it's ever been, but it's still a 1v4 situation where survivors have plenty at their disposal to prolong the killer's attention for their teammates to do their work.  While I can't speak to who you've gone up against (there are plenty of dickheads who'll de-rank to a lower level just to screw around with lower level players or people who have hours of experience coming back after a long time and having to go through low-rank players to rank up) I can say that I don't think you've had enough time to really come to understand how this game works.  
---
Give it time and keep playing.  Being sacrificed doesn't mean anything (nor does escaping or killing everyone or no one) cuz it's a game.  Just play it and keep going and keep trying.  If you don't enjoy the game there's no reason to play but if you have some fun while playing keep practicing and you'll see how the game balance is.
---
instaheals are shit. At bare minimum they only get you like 15 seconds, and they only get more if the survivor is running you around loops
---
The only way you're going to lose if a survivor uses an instaheal, is if you were already losing. It's a small tide turner.
---
i only die when its a 5 box pig with the shortened timer, because my luck is bad
---
Killer being toxic to people???? Only ways I can think of that is teabagging with Pig or GF. Face camping or trolling the survivor ruining the fun. Other than that please enlighten me on how killers can be toxic, please don’t say proxy camp or tunnel. That’ll be a huge disappointment
---
They don't really. And it wasn't a silent Nerf. It was stated in the patch notes.
---
What the hell? You can't get 2000 vb skins for free
---
Definitely shouldn’t reward stealth. Playing stealthy makes it harder for survivors that do their job. A big part of the game is wasting killer’s time but it’s so often that I’m getting chased for a while and when I’m downed there’s a blendette crouching in the corner of the map not doing anything because she heard the faintest terror radius and takes until you’re hooked on stage 2 to start crouch walking towards you. Definite nope.
---
:(
---
It's a connection issue. The hitbox is not where it should be due to killer's gamestate being different to survivors'.
---
GG EZ BABY KILLER GOT REKT
---
Why are you defending it, there is paywall after paywall for this game and there is no real alternatives to get skins in this game. You miss the entire point, most games can do skins far better because either A. They are cheaper, or B. There are alternatives to get them that are actually possible. If a free game with skins being the main source of income can get away with it then this game where you have to buy each character on their own after you already bought the game itself can find some way to do it.
---
When you're running spine chill and win a game by touching thrill of the hunt 2948 times and urban evading away just to make the killer keep patrolling it for no reason
---
yeah. Hitboxes are related to the lag and the connection.
---
Yes you can thru save the world it gives you a pretty steady amount of vb that you can save up to 2000. My nephew has not payed for a single battle pass or skin he has gotten by playing save the world mode
---
Cool. I said the same thing a week ago and only got 10 upvotes!
---
On top of all the Balanced Landing stuff people have mentioned, the walls are frequently ridiculously long, many walls are low enough to watch the killer while looping, and it's just generally very easy to see the killer coming from far away. Plus it has the safest basement in the game if you get the window spawn next to it, and two regular non-killer basements with safe as hell pallets.
---
Nah, XBOX
---
Lmao what a shitty comparison
---
That's a common strategy when it comes to in game currency, Always make it so the customer has a few left over, which prompts them to buy more.
---
The $10 one gives you an extra +100 cells as a "bonus". Since the outfit is only 1080 you'll be left with 20 cells at the end
---
It's because the Scream franchise also licensed the mask through the original company.
---
How many games have paid DLC? Buy a $60 Forza Racing game and don't get all the cars.  Buy a Sims game and don't get all the expansions, COD has (had) the paid DLC maps. Hell farming simulator has paid DLC. It's just the way the games work. Especially in Forza and Farming sim where it's a licensed product added to the game.
---
I fucking wish there was a season 4.
---
Reddit is one big repost
---
Unless the killer is a Trapper and all the windows are trapped.
---
Same here im on Xbox and ill probably check it out here soon
---
Any of them running pop? I’ve seen a lot of people running pop instead of ruin lately
---
i dont know can you?
---
"Talk is cheap" would make sense if the person doing the criticising had claimed to be able to do it better themselves, which they haven't.
---
That won't be the case anymore
---
Yo if I see a Twitcher in a lobby, I'm opening their twitch so I can listen to their spooks.
---
Makes it fucking hard to play though, listening to two audio sources.
---
Facts
---
i wanna play killer like that. rn im tryna derank as much as i can so i can play fun builds instead of meta builds of ruin, bbq, enduring, spirit fury all the time
---
It's not scummy if that's all my PC can handle ):
---
Bill will be released on the 14th with the mid chapter patch I think.
---
Eh, there aren't a whole lot of rank 20s anymore, especially since you can't depip below rank 15.
---
Ah ok thank you!
---
oh god oh fuck not mookel myers
---
THIS IS ME EXACTLY!! I WATCHED AS A DAVID, AND CLAUDETTE RAN AROUND A DETECTIVE TAPP BEING CHASED BY PIG, ONE WITH FLASHLIGHT, ONE WITHOUT...NOT DOING GENS ALLLLL MATCH. I DID 4 GENS AND RAN TO SAVE TWO MATES ON HOOK AFTER BEING DOWNED, PIG HAD MAKE YOUR CHOICE SADLY. I JUKE BARELY FOR A GOOD 2MIN WITH NEARLY NO PALLETS AFTER TRASH TEAMMATES, AND NO LAST GEN POPPED AT ALL AFTER I FINALLY GO DOWN. 
---
WELL NOW THAT I CAN SEE MY MATES AS I LAY DEFEATED, THEYRE HEALING EACH OTHER AND ONE IS CROUCHING NEAR ME. I GET HOOKED, THEY FINALLY GET LAST GEN, AND IMMEDIATELY EXIT GATE. NOT EVEN TRYING TO SAVE ME. I HAD TO TAKE A WALK TO CALM DOWN.
---
*Maybe*
---
I hate to be one of those guys to shit talk Fortnite just to shit talk Fortnite, but damn they fucking ruined cheap skins for everyone.
---
I remember when they released their first set of skins thinking "yeah nobody is going to buy that.", meanwhile people are constantly buying $30 skins.
---
But you already had them unlocked; why not get the perks on your survivors?
---
Thats true, youre right.
---
Because we won't have it unlocked after Bill arrives.
---
drill spins
---
saw goes slightly in and out
---
spinning &gt; slightly moving
---
So a criticizing opinion is perfectly valid-- unless you're criticizing the criticizer?  Is that the logic?
---
Lol why never had any problems prior
---
Stoner Ghostface
---
Get them before he arrives then?
---
stealth is boring, uneffective and unfun
---
If the killer is camping and tunneling just ignore them and do gens. Its takes 2m30s to die on the hook, which isn't long for the hooked person to wait, and more than enough time to do 2+ gens. Camping and tunneling isn't fun for the killer either, and doesn't get that many points. Its just a frustrated killer struggling to get a kill. Just feel sorry for them, tell them gg in the pgc to raise their spirits a bit, and move on to the next game :)
---
Why is he putting a mori with two common addons? Tf
---
Then don’t get it?
---
This was legit posted 5 hours before you... couldn’t wait atleast a day to repost?
---
This baffles me.
---
The game has been out for 3 years, and has been getting content and support for that time. I remember when a game came out and that was it, you might get a patch or two, and a year of content support but that was it. 
---
I mean how would you prefer they monetize having an entire studio working on one game? The game had a cost origonally, but in 2019 most of the players that play daily bought the game years ago, if you have people playing 20-30 hours a week, consistently, its stupid not to expect some return on that. Its not perfect, but as monetization goes, DbD does it pretty fairly.
---
Ohhhh yes, too much of these players out there. Can't even play dbd with music on the lowest level, because the noises in the game are too important for me so I know what I should do next.
---
I don’t get the issues and anger. If you don’t wanna buy it don’t get it. It’s just a skin. And even more so it’s not like overpriced skins are new to the gaming world, just take a gander at Fortnite. Everything in the shop costs more than the whole game.
---
I mean yeah bpdyblock is right but it's way too risky
---
Nurses calling is good
---
Cool!
---
Most of them are toxic, that's why bad things happen to them
---
I don’t feel that way
---
*sits on chair, crossing fingers hoping to be devour hope*
---
If you quit playing a long time ago, why post grievances here?
---
No actually, one of the skins is 1188, so the 1100 isnt enough
---
Make perks that provide an advantage to all killers.
---
Gen-tapping is for noobs that can't hit great skillcheck reliably.
---
Amazing, every word of what you just said was wrong.
---
No strangely enough most of the killers i played against last night didn’t have many perks at all very few tbh. The only person who ran pop was a clown i faced before i left through the hatch.
---
When people consider you the worst killer while you are a direct upgrade to one of the existing killers.
---
You haven't.
---
That is for free though.
---
Well, no. That’s not how the game works. Make 3 perks that provide all killers an advantage without making it related to the killer’s power.
---
That 15 seconds can be difference between winning and losing
---
Claudette has a way bigger nose
---
I want that mask and new sounds to go with it.
---
\*pikachu face\*
---
I didn't say that. Why are you trying to put words in my mouth? Criticism is fine, but not when your whole argument is just "well you can't do it better". Don't bother me with another stupid comment or I'll just ignore you altogether. Try and think about what you're saying before you embarrass yourself and expect me to dignify it with a response.
---
It was called the hatch but they got rid of that because killers with 3 kills and 30K bloodpoints needed their 4th kill to be their easiest. Seriously it was the only thing giving hope when you were with a bunch of boosted potatoes or dcers.
---
And instead you got devour hope before the killer got any tokens
---
Good job :)
---
For them to appear in new bloodwebs after the 23rd, you have to unlock them as teachables on Bill. But they will still be usable on any Survivors for whom you have them unlocked.
---
Don't mind me getting my wallet out
---

DBD IS SO STUPID I HATE IT SO MUCH. WHENEVER I LOG ONTO IT, I IMMEDIATELY LOG OFF AND WATCH SOMEONE PLAY DBD. DBD IS DUMB, BROKEN, AND ANNOYING. I HATE DBD.

FUN FACT: It can change in the U.S.

In some places, it is a hard 18. In others, like Kentucky, the age of consent is 16. And, in some states, they have something called "Romeo and Juliet" laws, which allow for certain conduct with harsh regulations.
---
The whole damn day yesterday :(
---
Anything after Halloween 2 doesn't exist...
---
Oh I see the game has some bugs! We'll make sure to fi it by adding more cosmetics!!
---
It does. English is a weird language, I bet queue is some sort of loan word and therefore has weird pronunciation.
---
if would like to use shards instead of spend $15, if it was $10 i would be fine, but its $15, thats almost as bad as apex having $20 for one skin for 1 gun
---
Glad I'm not the only one who thinks that the chef's knife Myers uses is fucking enormous.

And yet the small child screaming loud enough to break glass over a candy bar has more of a valid reason to be upset.

Pretty damn awesome

I mean, its clearly not a good match, but it could've been much worse
---
Can OP tell me if you spawned on the tile and started falling through or it happened after progressing a bit through the match?
---
I was on youtube earlier I there were 3 recommended videos of his on the right side of my screen. It's hard trying to focus on what I'm watching when I can see 3 of his faces staring at me at the edge of my vision
---
Just DC'd straight away
---
I GOT SO MANY FUCKING MESSEGES OF "WE COULDN'T SAVE YOUR PROFILE". ENTIRE GAME GOING TO FUCKING TRASH CAN.
---
I mean I don't know you or watch streamers so I have no clue what I'm talking about. But you say that you're toxic right in your flair. Maybe that's why you don't think other streamers are toxic.
---
TODAY I GAVE MY PUPPY A NEW TOY. A SQUEAKER BALL. MISTAKES WERE MADE. HE SPENT 3 HOURS RUNNING AROUND THE LIVING ROOM PLAYING WITH IT MAKING SO MUCH NOISE. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET WORK DONE?
---
tru3 kujo
---
He literally switches role almost every game lmao. Good try tho. Maybe dont just repeat what you see in reddit comment section and actually check out his stream
---
Lmao honestly this is probablu eventually whats gonna happen
---
I've noticed this a lot. Or like, you'll hit a great skill check and it will show the progress bar as completely done for a second, before going to where it needs to go to.
---
Not all streamers are the same.
---
However I think why it happens is because it feels like most of them with the channel in their name are smaller streamers and a lot of them seem to behave in toxic ways and do dumb things often ruining the game for fellow survivors and killers. It's done for the sake of "entertainment" and to get viewers and make "exciting" content.
---
So twitch streamers who wear their channel as their name all get lumped into that reputation and it happens enough most people just dislike and assume they are all the same.
---
I've lost count how many twitch streamers I've seen who tailgate with flashlights and do nothing else and teabag every pallet or sandbag their fellow survivors and other just an annoying behaviour.
---
I've seen a few who just play the game and don't act toxic but few and far between.
---
Same.
---
Or a chest lol that's a good idea though
---
When I play killer, I’m a spirit at rank 17 but yesterday my dailys were Get 4 Blink Hits with the Nurse. So I switch over to Nurse thinking it can’t be that bad. Holy shit dude. I get matched with 4 flashlight Claudettes all ranked 11, 9, 12, and 9. I didn’t get a single blink hit and couldn’t catch up to anyone with my level 1 Nurse on console. Fuck that
---
Yup. Binged all of them 2 weeks ago.
---
Thanks! So far, I've been playing Trapper and Nurse (probably isn't great for learning typical survivor patterns 😅). Maybe it's because they're low-ranked survivors, but I'm downing them with ease.
---
yeah it’s good
---
I watch his stream. He’s one of the best killers in the game. Thats why its so sad to see him proxy camp when he’s getting outplayed, then call other people toxic. One could even say he has man child like qualities when he gets triggered (which is often).
---
Just put some red on the neck and then bam it’s floating like her severed parts
---
You’re welcome
---
Sure if you don't own all the dlc, but if you doc mori's are the only ultra's you get.
---
DBD streamers have a reputation for being complete assholes and entitled.
---
Have an example from a few days ago from me: I was trying out new killers, since I’d just gotten all the DLC, and I was around rank 14 so sometimes I’d get rolled pretty hard for only having 1 perk. Playing like normal on Yamaoka (listening to said streamer in my game in background) when he starts looping me. Teabags behind pallets and constantly blinds me with what I found out later was a purple flashlight with addons.
---
So obviously I tunneled him for being a dickhead, and I hear him getting upset and calling *me* a douchebag. Then at the end of the game he waits in the gate area for as long as possible to “waste this killer’s time because fuck him”
---
This stuff happens all the time
---
People are explaining basic economics to you. You are trying to argue your subjective opinion of value is objective facts.
---
It does not matter what another company is doing. This company is doing something different. If you think it's overpriced don't give that company money and support the companies that are doing what you want. 
---
That's basic economics.
---
I've always enjoyed the feeling of "not knowing" when playing survivor. I could see a counter on Small Game being useful.
---
This is a cosmetic, this isnt included with the base game wo no it eont b3 free lmao
---
I agree, but that’s evidently a minority opinion.
---
PHARMACY, PLUNDERER'S, ACE IN THE HOLE AND UP THE ANTE. LET'S GO!
---
Very nice! Dude should have left the chase
---
Rip
---
I’m gonna pe my pamts

That one would be D4C

I feel that heavy

Ok but why is Miranda Cosgrove holding a gun
---
Flashlight is the simple answer
---
Beautiful
---
Except with new freddy this post is irrelevant
---
We need better content to keep paying for it, I wanna hit the Dougie and finish with a people's elbow Mori animation. I want the elbow pad to be visible for when i throw it across the map too.
---
Except new Freddy isn’t out yet.
---
It's her legacy skin.
---
what about the console players
---
What's up with those graphics?
---
The last sentence is most accurate
---
Idk what that has to do with the topic, but lots of ways. Killers can easily BM survivors with different gestures and ability spam.
---
I'm not at all putting words in your mouth.  The way to explore a discussion point that I don't currently agree with or relate to - is to word it in a manner that seems to be closest to what's being said and for you to correct it where appropriate.  I did ask "Is that the logic?".
---
So what if the entire point actually is "you haven't done it better."  
---
If someone offers unsolicited criticism and hasn't proven themselves through effort - the response along the lines of "show us what you've got" is entirely reasonable.
---
Your responses have so far provided quite the opposite of 'dignity'. Feel free to ignore this as you said you would.
---
Jeez I hope so, I’ve been away without internet for 3 weeks

*does a single buttdance in the corner of the map*

Killer: "ITS FACECAMPING TIME"
---
The skin is 1188
---
 I’m a old Michael main, ik how it feels.
---
This is really good and I love it but I can't help but be reminded of the last match I played against a plague where she was stuck in t pose the whole match and it was terrifying looking lmao. 
---
What if they added a killer that's theme was like. Computer glitches. That would be sick. 
---
Anyways I love your drawing.
---
And Freddy was decent too with the double range addons. It would lock on to people behind walls and basically have the same effect as block addons without the downside.
---
Toms chest looks like a thicc asshole

You said in your comment you don't want to waste bloodpoints on killers. Then you end your comment with a question of why are killers running better perks then you? Maybe they feel like using bloodpoints on killers isn't a waste?
---
You were really quick to make a strawman argument to try to enforce your really lame opinion. Just pointing it out.
---
fen ming
---
Imo the cheaper the game the more you're allowed to charge for micro transactions, I would be more annoyed at a $60 game doing this than a $20 game
---
Smaller terror raidius? Do you know what his power is?
---
I ran a build a while bank that was basically 'immersed objective completion' with Distortion, Detective's Hunch, and Dark Sense. I didn't get many games with Rancor, but the one I did fucked me up when I realized I was exposed.
---
Can you be more detailed?
---
I’ve always been injured too lol
---
If I’m being honest I don’t see how blinding the killer at pallets is toxic at all. Teabagging, I mean sure, I don’t care at all but I guess some people might
---
O shit. Killer should be able to customize the lockers on the map. That'd be wonderful.
---
Now I wanna know what the OP wrote.
---
I don’t know what “fair” means, but Dead Hard has no counterplay in certain circumstances.  As a killer, even if I know the injured survivor I’m chasing has Dead Hard, there’s no counterplay for me whatsoever if they’re near a pallet or a window.  Just DH to safety and whether I swing or hold my swing, It makes no difference as you vault the window or drop the pallet and run away.  And, because there are endless unmindgameable pallets and windows in this game, the survivor will likely make a ton of distance and put an extra minute or two on the chase.  
---
Dead Hard has absolutely no counterplay when used optimally and that’s a serious problem at red ranks.
---
So if NOED is easy free kills, does that mean decisive strike/borrowed time are easy free escapes?
---
Lol, I mean that’s fair
---
Tip for people who don't know when bones are done (if you can communicate with teammates) there are always 5 totems on the map. Thought I would throw this out there to the people who don't know. NOED is so easy to counter. Like it's kind of insane how people can't counter it somehow. I never get killed by NOED because me a my frienda just do totems and if someoen has max objective or something we'll have them look for the last 1 or 2 totems.
---
Yeah, except that wraith with windstorm and swift hunt is way better than freddy with range add ons or block add ons
---
The licensed content that is in this game isn’t really worth the money tbh but I still understand
---
Yeah let’s leave the Claudette explains why Freddy’s tunneling her lmao
---
HURDUR it completely OPTINAL, no Jews herew.
---
test
---
And this won't change with dedicated servers. If your ping to server will be 100+, you'll get same "bullshit" hits. So the question is: will you be lucky to have a data center nearby.
---
Yep. It's happened to me before, you just see you're exposed and go "well fuck."
---
"I'm coming for you."
---
Not exactly life-threatening is it? I was referring to killing him in-game since I main killer. 
---
The bloke who reported me was toxic in post-game chat first anyway, which isn't really fair.
---
Definitely not the same thing smh. 
---
DBD can get away with things like this because of these simpletons
---
Thanks for not explaining why, and just being an asshole with your 3 word response.

The actual reason why you might not want to do it is because the APK you find is not to be trusted because its not distributed directly from BHVR.
---
But if you accept the risk, then go for it. It's a free beta anyways.
---
Shaggy for survivor DLC.
---
Yup, made a post about this as well. I suggest others make a post too. More people say something it will be fixed faster. It all started IMMEDIATELY after they released the pig cosmetics. So im guessing it has something to do with that server side update.
---
Doesn't even matter if I get them... All that matters is they stepped in it...
---
Into my crap...
---
Well yeah, I meant compared to the perks I run on survivors. Obviously my perks on Killer are shit, but I dont really play much killer and I win anyways, because I'm at low ranks.
---
It just feels like most killers are playing some optimal builds where they must have spent hours grinding different killers to get the shared perks, while I'm still stuck with bad perks :/ 
---
Its just a case of needing more bloodpoints, but it takes sooooooo damn long to get a character to lvl 40.
---
 Is that Frank West?!
---
I have it in my name to grow my [channel](https://www.twitch.tv/bothershawn) and I don’t do any of the things people have described above. I also have only been playing for two weeks....plus flashlights are accessories
---
Isn't it borderline impossible to get someone banned for lagswitching unless they admit to it?
---
Plausible deniability is a bitch when you dont have concrete evidence.
---
My cousin and buddy get mad that it's all I wanna play lately and then they still end up joining me lmao
---
New game mode: 4 killers have to repair gens and try to escape Ash
---
12 isn't even that far away from 15 people, like. Stop complaining at a +2 difference.
---
yes

My favorite part is the Claudette just immersing herself the hell out
---
WhAt NoW?
---
I too, have it in my name to grow my [channel](https://m.twitch.tv/lunaarn/)
---
wait a second
---
do you play for honor?
---
We all suck at the beginning. I just didn't feel like sugarcoating it to someone who has a name like that.
---
They released the beta for a few select countries. But you can download it even if you aren't.  Its pretty decent but because its mobile, the controls are kind of difficult to get used to.

Last night I got a message to kill my self and then a few hours later got a real positive message from the killer I faced. I like to think the loyal community sends the positive messages
---
Not really.
---
All you can do is try and convince the devs, or make a new account and buy the game again.
---
you mean stream sniping :D
---
(joke)
---
That would be an awesome April first joke.
---
Agreed. The thing that makes Adrenaline strong is that it allows you to pressure those last gens. The heal and sprint burst alone aren't the only benefit. It's more about saving you the time from healing.
---
Thanks.
---
photo bombed
---
&gt; The comment could have been perceived as a real-life threat but the text itself did not go into anything graphic or extreme detail or even refer to a 'serious' threat against the player's life.
---
You need to work on your in-game communications skills. Probably not in DbD though.
---
He's talking about Freddy
---
I can’t fucking
---
I can’t fucking poop
---
He's comparing old Freddy to Doc. Old Freddy had a smaller tr than Doc, and had tracking that improved as the tr shrinked. Doc has a bigger tr, and likes it bigger. This tells you roughly where he is at all times.
---
Bro imagine this with 5 party streamers
---
There needs to be an offering update. Secrets aren't secret. Either add an improved offering system, add more offerings, or remove "secrets."

\~ This message brought to you by Tru
---
Do you really think that when a killer gets 7,5k points they played well? Green rank survivors can be hot garbage too :/
---
So that is what Claudette is doing...
---
Lol nice reddit name
---
With MoM per nerf it was either ignore the survivors who had it(if it was a SWF usually all 4) since you hook them after either an insta heal or getting healed, hit them after they’re hooked, or the get all three hits before they’re even hooked once and suddenly they get a “get out of hook” card because you were good at your goal. Same with DS it was a “get out of hook” card and still kinda is. I agree either NOED needs a nerf or it needs to be replaced by a slightly better but slightly worse perk(it’s hard to explain).
---
The add-ons are what made Freddy good though and added a variety. You had ninja Fred with black box, blue and green dress add-ons to extend the time Survivors could break out of dream world, so could hit one Survivor find another and go back to the first Survivor who aura is still shown so you could juggle Survivors around map, Block Fred which would reduce the amount of time it took for Survivors to fall asleep practically guaranteeing 1 hook because Survivors would think you have a 7 second transition and pill bottle Fred... I don't see much build potential with new friend aside from snares and pallets which the counter to snares is literally just not to stay at loops to long...
---
How is that an swf? The ranks in the matches are usually all over the place. In this case the killer happened to be the low rank one.
---
I'd say he's a good B-Tier
---
That tells me that the amount of people still buying those supply crates was enough to keep the price the same.
---
There are "whales" out there that have a ton of money to spend. I'm playing a mobile game right now where it is quite known for some of these "whales" to drop $10k a month on the game...you can imagine the in-game pricing.
---
Trying to communicate with the devs is like asking a Frenchman where the bus stop is at the moment.
---
Not keen on buying the game again either.
---
It's capitalism
---
Only if Freddy has an addon, and even with the addons it won't be 50% like Old Freddy had as base kit. 
---
I might catch some flack for this but I'm going to miss the slow. Freddy's stall was strong if you could sleep everybody. Now the only thing being asleep does is mean Freddy's traps will work on you, that's about it. (It also shortens his cooldown for the gen teleport)
---
While Old Freddy wasn't a direct upgrade to Doc, he was better. Doc has his shock which can do wonders with solid timing, and has an easier time finding people when the match starts, but Freddy had better stall, better tracking overall, and Mind games to make up for the fact that his power didn't do much mid chase. Plus ambush.
---
I read this is the voices that Samination gave to each of the killers.
---
Mori, you a busta
---
Ok good becayse if stuff was still slowed and it was concidered "optional" to wake up then that wouldbhave been super broken. Like a built in ruin, but like, for everything.
---
I always run Make Your Choice on my M1 Killers for this reason. Good Survivors will see you tunneling and gen rush you, so if you're really attached to your 1k, hard tunnel I guess. I like to cycle my aggro onto different Survivors so everyone feels the pressure.
---
are you sure this is your first game or did you farm bp
---
I like this idea
---
The saw has my respect for not being part of a cosmetic that’s $15
---
It shouldn't be free but it shouldn't be 88 shards more forcing you to spend 15$ instead of 10$
---
Fallout 76?
---
Killer can open the gate, so no one will have a choice.
---
This post isn't about my gen-tapping teammates, but about my repair progress bar bugged.
---
I definitely did not farm. I found and hooked everybody three times. This is only my second perfect game ever. I’ve had many come close though.
---
I PURCHASED A PIG COSMETIC SET YESTERDAY BUT TODAY THEY'VE SUDDENLY WENT DOWN FROM OVER 1000 CELLS TO A BIT OVER 700 AND I KINDA FEEL RIPPED OFF
---
well with rank reset, you can go below 15... since it occured quite recently, there could be potentially some 20-16 around there available for balanced matchmaking. could.
---
Man I couldn't even if I wanted to, thirty seconds of twitch delay ain't no joke. :P
---
No ones saying it should be free. We're mad because the cost of the skin is an extra 88 shards over the 10$ pack forcing us to spend 15$ instead
---
I don't get the hundreds of downvotes you get, I don't get the anger either. And the currency system is not greedy and even less scummy. If 15$ is too expensive... don't buy it.
---
1v1 me rust.
---
Ok because if it was still slow that would have been broken af. Asleep 24/7, slow af 24/7, no escape 24/7. Also I already know I'm gonna like the rework as a survivor. Freddy is so easy to play against but I hated not knowing where he was at all before he put us to sleep as well as the non direction lullabye. I like the fact that you hear his terror radius and THEN the lullabye. I already know that lullabye is gonna fuck me up. I'ma get sneaked up on so often.
---
Made with mematic
---
It does look worded weird for me. "Gain haste 10 seconds after hooking survivor for 10 seconds." Sounds like it takes 10 seconds to start then lasts for 10 seconds.
---
Personally I think he’s really annoying too. He gets frustrated when things don’t get his way, and watching him isn’t enjoyable.
---
For comparison, HybridPanda has interesting and funny commentary while he plays, and actively entertains his audience
---
Does sloppy affect the mending speed now?
---
Pretty much this, yes.

---
I do agree with the Freddy being similar to Doctor.
---
I didn't see Old Freddy as an upgrade to doc so much as a side-grade. I found Old Freddy fit my Doctoresque playstyle very well and I'm going to miss him. 
---
At least new Freddy has better fake pallets than Doctor. The fake pallet addons for Doctor were one of my favorites and it's going to be hilarious to watch survivors try to throw down the Freddy Pallets.
---
lol lol lol lol lol lol
---
Use bloodshards on only level 40 teachables from the shrine or ones you already have unlocked for the 150k bloodpoints. Only exception is of you don't own that character. It costs more then 150k to go from 35 to 40. 
---
Killers get way more BP on average then survivors, but at higher ranks you don't get as much if not running strong enough perks to take down your prey.
---
I don’t even get the skin thing. I know it’s cool to have a unique gun or outfit, but is it just to stand out from other players?
---
Those are the cute lil underdeveloped baby Megs
---
It's not protecting the skins so much as shaking ones head about the temper tantrums some people throw about an optional thing that they don't need being a certain price that they find too high.  
---
Usually the way to go in these cases is: don't buy it.
---
Maybe make it so Pig can't if RBTs are on survivors?
---
Thank
---
Why do people put bing bong above miss piggy? I mean I've always thoight her stealth was better.
---
This \^\^\^
---
People didn't know how to play old Freddy well enough and just went "7 sEcONd fEDoRa mAN bAd!!1!!!". when in reality hes around mid tier xD. People are too blindsided to see how much pressure and tracking he currently has along with his mindgames. Its almost like they played Freddy once, didn't get a 4k, and asked for a rework
---
The thing i hate the most though are the posts that cap "Us Freddy mains when we see the rework" like ok if YOUR'E a Freddy main you'll realise the rework isn't actually that good and that unless he sees some buffs CURRENT Freddy is actually looking better than reworked Freddy.
---
For current Freddo mains: Look over to Legion, he has a similar play-style, and as an old Freddy main i personally like them.
---
As a purple rank solo survivor I get rank 17-19 teammates very often. Stop pretending this game only discriminates killers.
---
Smacking them on hook, slugging (with the intention of letting everyone bleed out slowly), body blocking into corners, and the ever faithful post game chat aggression. 
---
Nothing a Survivor can do to bm should actually impact your ability to play the game, unless you allow it to bother you. They can flashlight click, teabag, and chase you around all they want, but you can ignore them. 
---
If a Killer face camps you, smacking you over and over and shaking their head, as a Survivor you can do nothing. One type of bm impacts your ability to actually play the game, the other impacts your feelings.
---
It’s normally not, but he was actively choosing not to run away just to pointlessly blind me more
---
He's losing his aura reading too. I agree if Freddy wanted to tunnel one survivor at a time he was decent at it and EXTREMELY annoying for the guy being tunneled. I found it way more effective to try and sleep everyone and only go for hits (Not hitting = denying self-care wakeup) when you have multiple people asleep and are ready to try and down someone.
---
May not be bugged gen-tapping with Prove Thyself and possibly other perks mixed with a little lag could explain this situation.
---
So what's the problem?
---
If they're too expensive, don't buy them. Sooner or later they will be forced to reduce the prices because they know people aren't buying because of the steep cost.  
---
No one is "pushing" these skins onto the players. They are optional. Eye candy. Something you can buy if you think: "Hey this looks nice and I want to support the developer.". This is totally fine by me and has been in many other games since many years.
---
It shouldn’t, especially not for survivor. I’ve actually seen a sudden decrease in waiting time for both sides the past couple days
---
Suffering from Success
---
Bright red vs Black,
---
Basically this, yes. And if it was priced too high, they will notice and probably reduce the cost.
---
Yes, Please!
---
Wraith has the silent bell and 0 terror radius for 6 seconds addons to his stealth, that makes him a lot better
---
Yep
---
It's pretty dumb seeing as how the skin just shows you have money and in no way relates to skill level
---
thats the saddest shit i have heard all year, i feel bad for you
---
I'll swlallow your soul!
---
It only works if youre not looking at your surroundings. I never get caught by that.
---
if pig had amanda's rule set and amanda's secret, it would genuinely overpowered to buff her that way.
---
Well, it’s better than being a red blob half-crouched in some grass, I think
---
It’s sad that games are becoming so monetized. Takes away from the soul of gaming. I guess that’s what comes with the popularity.
---
Ok so I have a bad habit learned from other games where I teabag to emote laughter. This laughter is usually directed at my fellow Survivors or myself. I seriously need to break this habit because obviously most Killers think it's directed at them. A good example is if I drop a pallet like a fucking forehead, I'll usually laugh-teabag, but the Killer thinks I'm just teabagging them at pallet.
---
This is me. Trill of the hunt to me is a "DO NOT TOUCH THIS RED BUTTON" sign. It just make me want to touch it.
---
Don't play Black Ops 4 than lol
---
Im just saying i get caught more off guard by the pig than the wraith.
---
But it is. You aren't entitled to get skins and if it is too expensive for you it has 0 impact on the game if you don't buy it.
---
If you think it's overpriced then boycott it and BHVR might not do it again. But if it sells well enough why should they cater to you because you are thinking 15 $ is a crime?
---
Yeah; i'm gonna miss that bastard. I hope devs somehow add them both to the game.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cetll4/ps4_server_bug_issue/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I agree that doc has the shock which can be useful in window loops.
---
But I found it to be much easier to find people as Freddy than with doc since you are invisible to them and they do not try to hide most of the time.
---
But part of that is likely because I love range addons and I can find people really fast with it.
---
idk man
---
you’re a 50 spirit
---
Typo in the title
---
Wow what a joy of a player to play against you are.  What fun interactive competitive games you play.  Players like you are what make this such a shitty community babycamper.
---
I played a lot of doc at the start (since I was blind and could never find survivors).
---
But once I started to play Freddy I did almost the same but everything worked out better.
---
He has the shock which can help with window loops but I find it to be much easier to just mindgame them at window loops.
---
r/unexpectedoffice
---
Yes, and just make the killers in this game less threatening. Great idea.
---
The problem is the focus on hooking, tbh. Putting the focus on the number of hooks a killers gets (*which is out of their control after the 4th hook*) is pretty dumb, and it requires the killer to hope that survivors don't let their allies die on first or second hook
---
So, another perk that solo people have to run, but SWF gets through discord? Just put it in survivors base kit. Solo people have needed a buff that only effects them for ages.
---
I don't think just because someone is annoyed by something they are surprised by it. People can still be bothered by something even if they saw it happening. Not sure where this sentiment comes from.
---
I'm just trying to hold on for the Freddy rework because he looks fun
---
Yesterday I had a baby nurse DC with 0 gens complete. She entered 2 chases, got 2 hits (1 on each) then lost the chase both times. Then just DCd.
---
HORRIBLE MASCOT CLOWN IS GONNA BE IN YEEEEES
---
Harharhar i leik it wen da funi man come onscreen w/ tape measzur XXXXDDDDDD
---
NASTY
---
Brutal Strength to destroy pallets faster and break gens faster. If you get pallet looped, try to stalk as much as possible. One thing I can say is don't focus your whole objective on stalking, remember to hit gens, frequently hit a few survivors, etc.
---
I suggest watching one of Monto's "Tombstoned" videos where he does tuft of hair + tombstone. I got very unlucky today as I tried this build. I would've gotten the achievement but some fucking cunt dweet disconnected
---
I smell repost
---
It sucks that her rbt are not great and her crouch speed should be a bit faster.
---
If that were the case I would prob main her after Freddy gets reworked.
---
Takes less than 5 minutes on either side for me (on xbox)
---
Nah I’m gonna blame the cheating shits
---
That feng set is gonna be a instant buy from me.
---
The clown one is also really good.
---
i'm actually shrieking right now what the fuck ace
---
What about Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, and Sprint Burst, etc, you survivors have perks just as broken so stop complaining unless you complain about both perks.
---
My boy Clown is finally gonna get some more cosmetics!! 😭 LONG LIVE PURPLE ELEPHANT CLOWN
---
The design winners....really?
---
I was going to say something but I don’t want to offend the artists. They’re drawn well but not something I think fits dbd at all.
---
“What’s that? Raise the price of characters to fix this issue? Got it.”- bhvr
---
no fucking way. that mascot clown won? fuck yes!!!!
---
Something's going on with Ps4, i cannot get into a match. Playing as survivor.
---
I out him above because his power is consistent but hers isn't unfortunately.
---
How is her inconsistent?
---
A skin should not cost more than the character change my mind
---
i actually love this so much
---
You can get the trap off extremely quickly and the fact that it doesn't go off in the endgame makes it a lot weaker.
---
Fuck I hope there will be official art for that clown costume
---
Even when they are asleep they miss because his eyes are for some reason on his hat and not his face.
---
I am not kidding you need to blind his hat for it to work.
---
But what does the wraith have that is superior to that?
---
Then why do you at least need a 3k to pip as killer?
---
"YES I WILL"-Legion probably
---
"Activates tier 3 with religious intent"
---
Stealth that makes you practically invisible until you uncloak. If you know how to place yourself while uncloaking you can get some extremely good hits and surprises in.
---
I'm gonna be so sad if they nerf the new Freddy for no reason. I'm scared given how they nerfed Plague and Ghostface.
---
I can't wait to t-bag with that feng outfit.
---
Congrats to the winners. There were so many incredible fan designs, I really hope they do these type of contests more often.
---
Bruh they've litterally said they are coming this August
---
HOLY FUCK I HAD AN ASH DO THAT PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE MATCH LAST NIGHT IT WAS SO ANNOYING. WHEN HE FINALLY GOT OUT AND WAS USING URBAN EVASION AROUND THE WHOLE MAP I CAUGHT THAT MOTHER FUCKER IN A CORNER AND TRAPPED HIM. HE D/CED AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO. AND OH MAN IT WAS SO SATISFYING.
---
Hst people always have hats on. Always
---
If I remember correctly, it was changed because people complained originally how easy it was to pip, as a survivor it was very easy for a long time until the emblems were adjusted, as a killer it has gotten increasingly difficult, so much that currently if you feel like you are just slaughtering them you might want to purposely give them a break so you dont end up not pipping because you crushed.
---
This mechanic will be broken/fixed in every patch :D
---
Right under the first one on my mobile feed lol
---
Yeah dude it’s a lot of fun. It’s going to be tough at first, but keep playing you’ll eventually get the hang of it.
---
I mean the shimmer is pretty noticable. But to each their own.
---
Yeah, the amount of really good skins was astounding.
---
I know that addiction is an actual thing. That's why I am saying he should watch what he says when he is accusing people of being addicts. It is a serious thing to assert and to make such an accusation because you are mad people can afford skins and you can't is just rude.
---
For a character that came in an $7 DLC pack!
---
Leatherface, arguably Legion are both still F-tier.
---
If yo used the your ability one more time...
---
Thanks for respecting my opinion like a mature person :D
---
You think parachute Dwight fits DbD more than dragon Min?
---
If you on pc then I would love to play with you guys.
---
The report system doesn't work and the developer have been putting off adding dedicated servers for 3 years now. I say blame the symptom and blame the cause.
---
No hate here. You explained your reasoning which i all i ever ask of people. Also myers being A tier helped too.
---
Ah, a fellow man of culture! I love me range. I tend to go Range/skillcheck add-ons because it really makes the tag-injure-leave strat notably better. 
---
People sometimes try to hide against Freddy while awake, but they aren't too successful because it's a blind guess without Spine Chill / Premonition. 
---
Doc doesn't mind having a smaller tr in punishment mode. M&amp;A + Calm gives him some ambush mid match when treatment isn't a free find. I still run Distressing, but it isn't required I find.
---
A lot of people tend to sleep on Myers and say he's C or B tier at best which I heavily disagree. A 60 second one hit in his base kit? That's pretty good if you ask me.
---
...
---
&gt; It’s on game pass.
---
Doesn't that mean that you can try it for free? If yes, do it. Game is fun.
---
Ask to not send me to the shadiw realm
---
It's so satisfying to get a hit with the drill though.
---
I love watching plays like this on either side they’re so satisfying lol
---
That’s supposed to be a dragon?
---
He hides his big mindgamy brain there \^\_\^
---
Feng looks cool but the clown....It's not for me I guess. Congrats to the winners!
---
this is a really controversial tier list but i personally agree (except with myers)
---
Could be a uk thing maybe
---
There is not that much of a difference. They are both virtual, intangible, and its value is based on the individual.The point is that for me, a skin makes the game more enjoyable.Being able to mix around outfits and customize my character is enough to keep me playing. To say that something isn't worth $10 and shouldn't be $10 just because it is virtual is a stupid argument. 
---
Also, the same dead game argument can be said about some multiplayer games. If you buy it and people stop playing it, then you wasted your money.
---
While I’m not gonna argue that doc is a particularly good killer, he def isn’t worse than only Freddy. Let’s highlight what you said made him worse:
---
Better Aura Reading: while it is true that Freddy’s aura reading is better than a ping wherever survivors scream, it’s inconsistent. The main way you are meant to play Freddy is to get one survivor to sleep and move onto the next one until none or like one of them is still awake. The problem lies within the fact that waking up against Freddy is really easy to do. You just need to fail a skill check or find an awake teammate which is super easy if you are doing SWF. You might think “that’s what Freddy wants, he wants you to find teammates so that he can then know where you both are” while that is true, all survivors need to do in that case is split up the second that they are woken up. It’s the same strat as being agains legion, just spread out throughout the map and it makes the power harder to utilize. Contrast this with docs power of being able to see illusions of himself that point to where survivors are, get pinged whenever survivors yell (which they do a lot). You get a power that still gives you a general idea as to where survivors are, and is much more consistent.
---
Better stall: Sure, I would say at base level has Freddy’s stall is better than Docs since his stall comes from making survivors take time to wake up where doc just makes them snap out of it. The potential for docs stall is way better than Freddy’s however when you factor in addons and perks. There are a lot of perks that help slow the game down with doc. (Unnerving presence, caulrophobia, huntress lullaby) paired with addons that increase his terror radius and give different effects to survivors afflicted by madness, such as constant chase music and fake terror radius that puts them on constant edge. Freddy only had 2 addons that really help his stall and that’s the dress addons which weren’t easy to rely on since skillchecks are RNG so you can’t bank on them working for you 100% of the time. 
---
Smaller size for mindgames: I mean you are right, Freddy is smaller but I think you’re overestimating the value of that.

Smaller terror radius: I was going to list docs terror radius as a plus, not a minus for him. The fact that his terror radius can get so large means that he can use his power more effectively as well as make it disorienting for survivors because if they are always in his terror radius, it becomes harder to actually tell what his location is. Not to mention that doc can make his terror radius small if he chooses. Calm addons make it so he has a tiny terror radius in punishment mode, making sneaking up on survivors way easier with doc. Freddy’s terror radius needs to be small so he can see survivors closer to him in dream state where as doc can benefit from both a large and small terror radius at the same time,
---
Idk why you would cross out all the perks and add ons so we can't even see what you were playing against. I'm guessing you had 1-2 yellow perks and likely got screwed in matchmaking and went against survivors who had pretty decent shit. I'm only a rank 14 killer but I hope around, and I literally am level 12 on Leatherface, 2 yellow perks is all I have and I usually 2-3K a team full of higher rank survs with full purple loadouts. 
---
Said this on one of your other shitposts. Don't blame the game just because you don't know how to play it yet. If you put as much effort into researching and learning as you do complaining and posting garbage on here, maybe you'd do better.
---
I mean his stealth top tier, instadown easier to control than many others, and if you count addons the only one that can straight kill people.
---
I think it's a dragon bag and demon mask
---
The killer opening the exit gates is less time spent going after other survivors.
---
So you just let the idiot have his free points? Smack the farmed to the ground, then go chase after the farmer.
---
He doesn't get his points for the unhook, he actually loses points because of the unsafe hook penalty, he'll get hooked himself, and you've pulled at least one other survivor off a gen to heal the farmed. Minimal effort, maximum effect, and the asshole who farmed doesn't get rewarded for being an asshole
---
Yup keep upvoting people, it definitely has to do with the pig cosmetic release
---
No, it's your opinion.  Big difference.
---
Why is this so accurate
---
I think that people didn't notice that freddy was an upgrade for doctor because no one knew how to play freddy
---
Congrats to the winners!!!
---
Also, if killer is Freddy and you are awake when gens are done.
---
Forgot "Nearleh'"
---
I mean I'll try to prevent the unhook points if I can, but the person going up on the hook is the one who did the unhook.
---
but why
---
Yeah is it just me or do survivors sometimes make injured noises even though they’re healthy? Just something I noticed recently idk if I’m crazy or not lol
---
Amanda’s secret is kinda hot garbage so I don’t really think that it would be worth taking considering you only get notified after a survivors takes off the bear trap. Rules set is easy to counter because by the time that endgame rolls around, you should be able to remember where one or two boxes are
---
This cosmetic was robbed and instead we got a cosmetic that is so meh.
---
doctor's tracking is a slight annoyance for survivors and it only works a few times. I agree with what you said about waking up, it is very easy to wake up but it is also very easy to put survivors to sleep
---
Once again i dont know how they played. Youre just posting random ahit and expecting us to agree. Also the ranks arent that far off to the point I would say this bullying. Maybe you should play a different game.
---
“Is this how this community treats beginners?”
---
It’s not like killers can choose what rank they play against? It’s the match making system
---
The face of a man who has looked at the Entity and did not come back whole.
---
:p
---
Good luck everybody else!
---
Mascot clown yeeees
---
Protests don't matter when it probably only takes &lt;1% of the playerbase to buy it to be profitable.
---
As far as I know they also said they wouldn't do a clown killer. Maybe they will change their mind on this too
---
I play dbd and league... still not sure if im having fun yet.
---
One time I hit a great skill check and it automatically made the gen look like it was completed but it didn’t actually count it as completed, all I had to do was tap it again to fix it but it was super weird
---
Not really, I just can't understand people being so mad about a skin that doesn't even have any bigger impact on their experience at all.
---
Btw, what would be a fair price for this skin? 10? 5? Free?
---
There’s an immense amount of detail in this picture that i am unable to process
---
Love this new floor is lava mini game!!

&gt; It forces survivors to “make a choice” as well: they see an ally get a trap placed in their head so they 99% the gate. Do they a) open the gate to secure their own safety, or b) not open the gate to give their ally more time to search reverse bear trap boxes and try to distract the killer.
---
There's no choice for survivors, if killer can open the gate. And there won't be "more time to search", because killer WILL open the gate.
---
Did the killer tell you to survive yourself? :D
---
League of Legends had $20+ skins before fortnite  was even thought about.
---
This is a normal thing. They need to make money somehow.
---
I don't know why people bitch about this. Only way you can get better is by playing people better than you. Judging from the lack of points from everyone and the one kill, I'm willing to bet you camped that one kill. Survivors get 5000 points for escaping. They were probably smart and finished the gens because they knew you were hanging around the hook. Maybe instead of crying about the rank system, try to actually learn how to play.
---
No one is forcing you to buy the skin. Change my mind.
---
This is art.
---
Ah yes, a herd of Megs in the wild.
---
Yeah but they are ultra rare add-ons and aren't really meant to be balanced because they're used very rarely. 
---
Same as an ebony Mori, you'll most likely see op add-ons and offerings consistentantly used if you're in a red rank swf which kind of balance each other out anyway
---
do bones
---
Absolutely accurate.
---
Lolololol
---
Are you ok
---
You can easily pip in a long enough game with even just a 2k if you get enough hooks. Also 3k is what is usually considered a win on the killers side, so obviously meeting that is expected if you want the "win" but it's possible if you put in lots of work for a 2k.
---
I mean, Myers can also use the back alleys of Haddonfield to stealth.
---
this sounds like a crazy idea, but adding voicechat and after that balance around SWF would be nice
---
Rank 20 thuglife over here.
---
make it a ultra rare addon where if you open the gate as pig it still activates the trap otherwise it won't activate and make it rules set .2 for that addon
---
He brouh a Moreh
---
Fair point fair point.
---
Corey is the crapper
---
I really need to know more context of what is going on in this pic
---
Why
---
I finaly want an answer what people find appealing in his kit
---
He has just a worse hag tp and a even worse trap 
---
That doenz even work unless you wait or already hit someone
---
Yeah, it is a decent perk, but amount of tokens you get is just too low.
---
You don't buy Chapters?
---
It is a bit. But as said it's from personal experience. Most people tend to bandwagon. Then there's people who protect Tydetymes lists and opinions to their last breath.
---
They need to try and get pinhead, Chucky, Candy Man and the Leprechaun.
---
and then they criticize noed memes because they dont do bones
---
Except you can either as killer a) open the gate to activate one reverse bear trap or b) try to get another reverse bear trap on another survivor. Pig opening the gate means that if you have any RBTs left, they become useless.
---
I believe he’s invulnerable to being revealed while leaning. You gotta see most of his body in order to reveal him
---
Just focus on the belly. You know you want to.
---
Pshaw, thanks. xD
---
Clown literally just got a skin tho
---
I can’t play for long periods of time because I don’t like to rage anymore, after so many gams of blendettes and stupid teammates, I just stop playing after I get mad
---
We were going against a Myers. Our game was also plagued by that glitch/exploit where we couldn't wiggle, recover, or self heal because no progress bar would show up. Intermittenly I couldn't even see progress when healing others.
---
The 4th guy who shows up at the end was looping my Myers to get him away from this location
---
Little bitter that wraith skin didn’t win and this bing bing knockoff did but congrats to the artist
---
You amazing!
---
I'm not entirely sure, but it's probably because I'm somewhat defending the cost of cosmetics, or because they think I'm pro-Behaviour, two things which aren't very popular here. Personally, I think it's cause of the "tradeoff" sentence that I used, but I stand by what I said.
---
At the end of the day, I'm not worried about the downvotes. If someone sees my comment and understands it, that's good enough.
---
I also play both, I feel like we need a support for people like us. Overdosing on salt intake is no joke
---
Your suggestion completely reverses the exact reason why they did this change in the first place.  EGC does not activate traps to prevent the highly unfair situation of a Pig closing the hatch with the new EGC jatch mechanic and effectively trapping the survivor in the map with them since they can no longer use the hatch and could not escape through an exit gate either.  The Pig would then simply patrol the boxes from a distance until she inevitably spotted the trapped player attempting to free himself.  It would be a 4k guaranteed every hatch close.
---
Gg ez
---
Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuullshiet!
---
Great fucking shot though.
---
Don't care. Survivors are just skins lol.
---
I agree, I'm never going to do anything like this again though
---
I just think this post is super funny!

I'm not buying so what's your point? Warframe's average Character/warframe cost is between 800-1000 plat and a Warframe prime would be about 1500-2000 depending if you grind or buy the parts. The average skin for a warframe is 200 plat and so are the color pallets. Thats a free to play game that has a more consistent price rang for customization versus the base character; where Dead by daylight Cost $20 or $40 on console so your defedning them for overpricing skins for killers that you won't ever see in-game besides a mori and just weapon skins?  Jesus I get that they need money to keep this game afloat but the Shards you buy versus earn is so inconsistent its literally just dumb. Almost every killer has 1 or 2 skins you cannot earn and have to buy its ludicrous and the Bloodpoints you get are just useless once you have everything so until the next character comes out what's next?
---
Use them earlier then
---
It depends on how much of him you can see. He is alot harder to spot while he is leaning.
---
You mean like the entitlement that it's perfectly acceptable to play like an absolute scumbag simply because someone has ttv in their name?  Punish players for their actions not their names...I've played against plenty of streamers who weren't the least but toxic.  Not everybody's Ochido dude.
---

---
Guess I can't criticize a movie I don't like, as I probably couldn't do it better, right? Most critics can't make a better movie then a lot of stuff out there, so they aren't allowed to criticize movies?
---
This is the worst response to someone saying something negative you can give, unless they are implying that they could do better.
---
Weird I'm not a streamer and I also get camped tunneled slugged and moried.
---
oh i thought you meant you did
---

Oh boy! I can’t wait for more $15 skins!

Just imagine what people who also play overwatch must deal with. We need a group therapy discord or someshit lol
---
“I think we did a pretty good job so far”
---
now just imagine if they had thought of them
---
You stream sniped him though midgame?
---
Eh, you don't win every match. Sometimes you demolish and sometimes you get demolished. The game is at it's most balanced state tbh
---
You are right. I guess they could just make it so that it doesn’t activate when the killer initiates EGC but then the power becomes a bit inconsistent
---
Do she have nuhses?
---
You don’t get that love.
---
Very nice. 
---
Oh! It’s a billay!
---
—I’m from the US and find myself saying things like tru  while playing lol my friends have no idea

Oh, Well...
---
It's still a good Personal Achievement
---
Not that I have to deal with it anymore, but what did you do? I would panic while doing gens if I heard the singing. Do you just do objectives, and just loop him/escape him as soon as you get pulled in to the dream?
---
STOP CLEANING TOTEMS WHEN WE SPAWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF A GEN!

Yea but theres 2 green ranks,  a yellow rank and a grey. Thats easily a swf if it wasnt  he would of been match made with yellows and greys. Im a rank 8 killer and im only ever matchmade with reds and purples if its not a swf.
---
Paise the Locker
---
How else do you kill people?
---
"Like it's kind of insane how people can't counter it somehow.  I never get killed by NOED because me and my friends just do totems"...
---
You just hit the nail on the head.  You play swf lol.  Swf makes NOED a joke because you have coordination and a built in totem counter in chat.  Try playing primarily soloqueue and then watch how much NOED you start to eat since it basically falls on you to take out all 5 yourself.  Randoms cannot be relied on to touch a single one.  They're awful when it comes to dulls.
---
BRB, buying the Clown and levelling him up just for this outfit.
---
Listening to audio from him alone on a delay of several seconds doesn’t really help anyone all that much, I just like to listen and see if I spook someone.
---
At best someone might say “okay let’s do this gen”, and even then I have discordance or surveillance anyway most the time
---
Don’t have her leveled but using a infantry belt and iri head. I like the confidence.
---
It pisses me off, wait times are already long enough
---
Oh shit, where is that?
---
I’m in D tier. Sry
---
Sadly, it's the first time BHVR is doing this, as before $10 meant you got any set you wanted in its completion. Hopefully this is a bug or they never do it again.
---
WHY CANT I GET INTO A MATCH THE SERVERS SUCK
---
Wow. I guess I’m the one that takes your essay of why it’s unfair they’re making it cost so much. But again, it’s a cosmetic. If you want it, buy it. If not, don’t.  
---
People will buy it if it’s worth it and some people won’t . I’ll personally buy it and do it to support the devs. I’m not going to whine on the forums on why they should make it basically free for me because I’m not an entitled free to play player.
---
I play all 3 and I don't get salty over them.
---
Mostly people want anything besides what he is now
---
These are the hats that men who are in denial about balding wear. Every time.
---
Bing bong knockoff?
---
I was picturing a second device next to you like an iPad or something along with video which reveals positioning.
---
Well, let's see the mistakes he did here:
---
•Used doctor as if he had range addons at the start
---
•Refused to drop the chase after chasing the same guy for more than a minute 
---
•Picked a survivor at a pallet where a generator just got finished
---
•Played an unviable killer (Okay, this is not his fault, this is more of Bhvr's fault) without perks/addons at high ranks
---
•Didn't pressure gens
---
I like tru3, he's a nice guy but he isn't the god that many people say that he is. He's decent but not godlike
---
When you look away from the horror of that belly to see the Myers photo.
---
Sole survivors should not get a buff due to something outside the game (SWF voice comms) this is a fair way for survivors who play alone to still keep up with information
---
Ikr, all these killers complaining about stream sniping while it’s literally impossible to watch their gameplay
---
Blame Rank reset. Meta perks are the things you need in high ranks to get any kind of chance against the tonnes of SFW groups.
---
30 second delay? wtf I get like 5 or so at max.
---
I would say "like any other character"
---
Again, rank 20, he’s still learning the game, and should be against higher tier players.
---
Me too I love unlocking them.
---
My fault for not being clear here.
---
If someone gets unhooked in front of me, I will go for the person who freed them.  I will do my best at this time to avoid the person who was just let off the hook, for at least 30 seconds.
---
Omg what have I done
---
When I play as Doctor I usually take distressing, unnervig presence, huntress lullaby and ruin and finish a game before every single gen is done
---
Even better when a survivor drops out during trail load or tge killer leaves
---
sike, the problem here isnt the imbalance in the game, it is the shit matchmaking system. Once you learn a few totem spots and how to hit great skill checks, ruin wont be a huge problem anymore. Looping and juking work fine and they have play-arounds. You need to develop a strategy as you see how the killer plays
---
I'd jerk him off.
---
It’ll wake survivors up, which you don’t want. Just use surveillance
---
Don’t need to wait to hit someone, DreamWorld is waaaaaay easier to navigate/see in, his snares/pallets give him a reason to sleep people, gen teleport paired with BBQ and Pop helps him apply crazy pressure. 
---
Plus people who bought him now get a “new” killer for free, something different to spice up their play sessions.
---
Good cosplay. But cringe
---
Reminds me of Babadook. Very cool
---
Mission succesfull
---
not asking it to be free, just asking why the fuck does it cost almost double the price of the Pig DLC is ludicrous but whatever, if you want to support that you can and I respect it but I will still complain on here regardless.
---
Meanwhile i have all the good perks but i am still afraid to use my iri add ons because i dont want to lose them even tho i have like 20
---
Moist
---
I like those more than the extra ones he has now I deffo buy them
---
In my opinion, doctor is balanced the way he is.
---
yeah im a bad boi
---
"Its a known fact" uhhh wut
---
I still don't even own her so meh
---
You can not hope to achieve balance unless solo survivors and SWF are around the same strength, and killer is bugged to balance that. There are currently three sides in balance when their should be too. You’re blatantly wrong in saying solo should not get communication bonuses to be brought closer to SWF level, especially as that’s literally the only way to fully balance the game. Even the devs have been trying to do it for years, and have even considered making kindred a base ability.
---
I dunno man playing a killer that doesn't have map control in red ranks doesnt work well at all
---
You tell me. The only thing I can see are what add-ons and offerings everyone used
---
It's a 'been there, done that' situation lol
---
i dunno he just feels eh but that's just me
---
It was you Nea, just like everything else there.
---
its was a swf group who just hide behind the rocks when i hook someone lel
---
Well take the banter you deserve it.
---
I was going to say i love taking in all that post game salt
---
I think they're doing a chrome masked ghostface I'm sure I saw that somewhere
---
Do you know why you're never able to find that one P3 Claudette? Cause it's black you know
---
Weak noed bitch
---
Damn....at least you got to play with Robert Downey Jr.
---
Schrodingers generator
---
Keyword being long game. Games don't last long against optimized experienced survivors given how fast the generators can be done. Most cases you're going to need a 3k.
---
The emblem system really sucks for killer right now. They seemed to have fixed it for survivor, but for killer you can 4k 5-gen and still depip, and some killers like trapper it's hard to pip because you need to be in chases but if they go into your traps you're not chasing
---
I believe the added cost on top of normal orange/legendary skins is prob what they need to play whoever owns the license so they decided that the customer could pay that bit.
---
i feel like you didnt read what i said at all :/
---
Survive After Sundown
---
Downtown Omaha, Nebraska. It’s super cool!
---
And camped trashh
---
“Bro nea just leave you scaring me
---
But 100ms is 0.4m travelled by survivor. And most “bullshit” hits feature 1-2m distance.
---
Same for PC in Spain
---
You do realise that the art team and the balance team aren't the same, right?

I've seen 4 ebony's, 1 teachable perk, 2 ivory's and 3 gruesome gateau in one bloodweb...
---
Only got 3 ebony's and 3 gruesome gateau 😔
---
That's a little weird mate
---
survivals : play in swf, gen rush like crazy and use adrenaline and flashlights
---
also survivals: how dare this killer run noed
---
It depends on his perks. He's got ones that prevent being exposed and others that hold him in night shroud a few moments after exposure. 
---
I have been exposed in leaning so I know its possible
---
Generator teleporting is an amazing utility that applies a lot of map control and pressure, especially with Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Fake pallets are hella fun and the feeling you get when a survivor falls for one is glorious
---
Add-ons let him have built-in game slowdown, allowing you to get away with not using Ruin, something most killers cannot say 
---
Stylistically all of his kit looks great, the teleport animation, the dream snares (even if they suck), the explosion of blood from fake pallets
---
He looks like he's going to be Hag-tier which is better than most of the killers in the game and it'll be nice to have a somewhat viable "new" killer...Assuming he's not nerfed to oblivion for no reason
---
To be honest I do this all the time, it's a bit hilarious
---
True. I don't play solo much. I guess it would make sense to at least have a counter so you know how many are left.
---
Who doesn't, although I'm not good at replying to it
---
Yah 4-8 was the ideal spot but for the past 3 months those ranks upto rank 1 have been really weird with the player base. Almost seem like these guys are having someone play their account to boost them up and then they take back over but are complete shit and literally do nothing, they won’t even hardly touch a gen and I they do, they miss skill checks like crazy with no ruin and forget about hook saves. They either leave you to die on the hook while trying to creep around or sandbag you in front of the killer till your dead!
---
If you been toxic to them, they can certainly be toxic back without the salt
---
So... Ash is also destined to save the people trapped inside the entity, then?
---

---
Likewise, I wasn't directing the "hard tunnel if you want" toward you, just to people who do that in general. I'm agreeing with you. &lt;3
---
Yeah? I don't see how both of our arguments can't be true.
---
Rank 20, hes still learning. He sucks and so does the matchmaking.

---
nothin' personal, kid
---
Legion dosent really need any nerfs hes one of the worst killers if not the worst
---
I think people like to play iconic killers like Freddy but was seen as a joke. Now we can use Freddy and not get shit on as much. It's not so much his kit. It's that it's Freddy Kruger.
---
Please no more reworks everyone so far seems ok.
---
I dont see how this could be seen as bickering. It's an actual situation I encountered last night. I also didn't know high effort was mandatory on reddit. I said nothing about what anyone mains, I just thought it was funny, and this came to mind.
---
You can play it for free with gamepass so go for it, see if you like it.
---
Few things. 1) Never go into killer shack's locker because most killers check them if they don't see any scratch marks near a gen that's being repaired. 2) Wtf was that locker exiting lol? You heard her breaking the god pallet and you decided to exit the locker slowly which makes you visible to the killer. Fast exit in that situation at worst.
---
Also, fuck immersion :)
---
No, I see the killers complaining on here instead.
---
so you knew it all along..
---
Oh boy, prepare for the downvotes.
---
I'm just worried *for* Mista
---
I knew it wasn't going to be free but it's essentially the wasting 4 dollars for cells I didn't want to begin with that I can call out.
---
So your idea of balance is to make all survivors stronger? Do you also want noed as part of a base kit to balance it? Istand by my point you should not balance survivors so all can be at their strongest (SWF) all the time. Survivors are supposed to not know everything, they should not automatically know the killer because one person found them. SWF broke that, and attempting to “balance” survivors around what SWF can do is laughable. if people want the power of SWF, find friends, even just adding other survivors you enjoy playing with.
---
I'm super excited!!!!! Always wanted to use that crusty ol' bastard!
---
? He got the doll skin months ago
---
He hasn't had any since.
---
That’s me with survivor items. I’m always like “oh I only have 5 green toolboxes left better not use them.”
---
I just downloaded the special edition. 🤞

You can charge just 12 thought, atleast i can.. If you go to buy something and you dont have enough in your wallet it asks you if you want to top up and it then takes the price of whatever you want to buy and asks if you would want to top up that amount or pick one of their prices but also you can just go on steam website to top up and inspect element and choose what you want to top up.. at least thats what i do lmao
---
Just use low settings

Would you be selling the stickers anywhere? If so I’d love to buy one!

I take mine off when gaming, hate the headphones pushing against it.
---
I didn't see many when I looked at the time I saw your initial comment, and it was at the top at the time as well
---
No but it's just something to further piss off survivors
---
Where’s Ghost Face??
---
Omaha, Nebraska!
---
&gt; The problem lies within the fact that waking up against Freddy is  really easy to do.
---
It is much easier to snap out of it than it is to wake up.
---
Unless you play doc for only level 2 I guess?
---
&gt; You just need to fail a skill check 
---
This usually takes a bit of time and sets back progress so it is worth it imo.
---
&gt;or find an awake  teammate which is super easy if you are doing SWF. You might think  “that’s what Freddy wants, he wants you to find teammates so that he can  then know where you both are” while that is true, all survivors need to  do in that case is split up the second that they are woken up.
---
The thing is that it takes some time before the animation is finished.
---
If I remember correctly it is 5 seconds plus you can see that they are going to preform a wake up animation since they will suddenly stand still.
---
If you have range addons that should give you more than enough time to get to them unless they are at the other side of the map in which case they lost a lot of time by just walking.
---
&gt; It’s the  same strat as being agains legion, just spread out throughout the map  and it makes the power harder to utilize. Contrast this with docs power  of being able to see illusions of himself that point to where survivors  are, get pinged whenever survivors yell (which they do a lot). You get a  power that still gives you a general idea as to where survivors are,  and is much more consistent.   
---
&gt;It is a bit more consistent but also less useful since with Freddy you can actively see what they are doing.  
---
&gt;This gives him more information so he can keep in mind if they are doing totems/are healing/'doing gens.  
---
&gt;If they are asleep you can come to them whenever you want and know exactly where they are and not just "he was here a few seconds ago".
---
 
---
 Better stall: Sure, I would say at base level has Freddy’s stall is  better than Docs since his stall comes from making survivors take time  to wake up where doc just makes them snap out of it. The potential for  docs stall is way better than Freddy’s however when you factor in addons  and perks. There are a lot of perks that help slow the game down with  doc. (Unnerving presence, caulrophobia, huntress lullaby) paired with  addons that increase his terror radius and give different effects to  survivors afflicted by madness, such as constant chase music and fake  terror radius that puts them on constant edge. 
---
This helps but mostly in low ranks.
---
Those perks are not used a lot even by doctors in high ranks because survivor have no trouble dealing with skill checks even when they are a lot harder.
---
The fake terror radius and chase music also work better with low rank survivors than it does with good survivors.
---
I am personally a bad survivor but those  things do not bother me as much.
---
&gt; Smaller terror radius: I was going to list docs terror radius as a plus,  not a minus for him. The fact that his terror radius can get so large  means that he can use his power more effectively as well as make it  disorienting for survivors because if they are always in his terror  radius, it becomes harder to actually tell what his location is. Not to  mention that doc can make his terror radius small if he chooses. Calm  addons make it so he has a tiny terror radius in punishment mode, making  sneaking up on survivors way easier with doc. Freddy’s terror radius  needs to be small so he can see survivors closer to him in dream state  where as doc can benefit from both a large and small terror radius at  the same time,   
---
&gt;That is true not much I can add to it.
---
But now we are also ignoring the easy hits he gets from the dreamtransition which can not be compared to shocking survivors at windows.
---
Because of that you can easy injure a survivor and walk away and they have to heal since if they wake up before getting healed you can down them without any problem.
---
Now what if you add sloppy butcher to it since they are forced to heal after all?
---
And what about addons that decrease a survivor their action speed?
---
Combine that with that you can let them waste time healing and come to them before they can even finish healing because your aura reading is just amazing.
---
Then you have stall that can not even be compared to the doc.
---
Doc wastes a bit of time and gets a bit information  about where  they are and sometimes gets a free hit by shocking them when they try to jump over windows.
---
But Freddy wastes more time than doc can dream of, knows exactly what they are doing when they are asleep and come come to them and leave when whenever he pleases and gets first hits easier than the wraith.
---
Freddy is actually just buffed doc (with out window shocking) + buffed wraith (without faster movementspeed while cloaked).
---
I don’t get many KYS messages in dbd, however I find people on the other team reeeeaally don’t like me since I’m a bit under ranked and tend to do good because of that.
---
And I’m saying it should be a base feature, as solo needs (even the devs and much of the community have said this) a communication buff. A totem counter would do nothing for SWF, neither would the small game change. However, having to run a perk strictly due to being solo and having notoriously bad and unreliable teammates is also bad game design. Also, that’s your personal view of the game, not everyone’s. You just ASSUMED that no matter how this game goes, changes, or develops, it’s a strict rule that solo people should never have more info. How’s that your call?
---
I guess so but theres people who actually buy 100+$ skins and dont even bother trading up
---
I care about rank. There’s not enough good players in the green ranks. Purple and red is where people know what the hell they’re doing
---
That's how I saw it. Was very hyped
---
there has to be one more generator completed for the amount of people left, ex. if there are 3 people left, 4 gens must be completed for it to spawn, 2 people 3 gens, etc
---
Here here!
---
Can’t knock the personal experience list. Lost of folks will disagree, but I get where you’re coming from. The only glaring issue I see is the prayer beads spirit. Absolute top tier, godly strength.
---
You can barely see her with it on Leary’s with fog
---
Isnt is kinda sad that there are so many cool ideas to use his style of nightmared and fear
---
But instead we got some more or less copy paste abilities with a blood fountain taped on ?
---
Now that you mention it most of the maps where the killers are from they are much weaker.
---
(except billy I guess and maby trapper not sure do)
---
I think they've done a pretty good job so far
---
Arrogant of you to push your opinion like that. I made a fair suggestion, that’s all. I made no assumption for the future, only how it stands now. You simply do not speak for the community, that’s simply your view of the game, certainly not everyone’s.
---
Pig is pretty good on the game imo
---
itll also open when there is 1 survivor left with atleast 2 gens complete, and if you use a key on it, itll only be open for a short time, so be quick
---
CONTACT BEHAVIOUR SUPPORT THEY CAN REFUND YOU SOME MOTHER FUCKIN BLOOD POINTS FOR THE PROGRESS YOU LOST.
---
Uh yeah, that's my point
---
If you’re on pc you can use a macro, if you’re on console, you don’t have to flick the stick back and forth, you can just spin/rotate the stick clockwise or counter-clockwise
---
Watch tutorials on YouTube beforehand, there are a lot of mechanics that aren't fully explained
---
Is that really all you said? That seems way too innocuous to be banned over in a game where a killer chases a survivor. I can't even imagine how that could be interpreted as a threat without something more.
---
I've come across a lot of hags recently that barely use , if at all. Idk why they play her if they aren't gonna use her main power.
---
Please state where I said what the game is supposed to be. I said something I’d like on it, but you said straight up the game (not that you’d like it this way, but that it’s a rule) should have no communication). I never said any over arching opinion like that.
---
Besides, you’re forgetting all I did at first was ALSO make a suggestion, then you began with how solo Q should never get a buff...
---
lol lol lol lol lol
---
a b c d e f g h i jeff k l m n o p q r a t u v w x y z
---
Forgive if I sound entitled but... Whats the issue with this?
---
Hes not going to get far up
---
Hes going to be over legion but not more
---
Alteast in my opinion
---
He got nothing realy to help in a chase without waiting to eat pallets or hope people cant see a neon red puddle
---
And the tp is pure sprintburst bait 
---
If they see blood people will just get a safety distance and then either proceed to do the gen ig it was a bait or will just use the safety distance to get away
---
Oooh ok. I had 3 people and 3 gens left. We were searching for the hatch while the other guy was getting camped. It makes sense now. Thanks!
---
Dude what’s on the menu there is the food horror themed too?
---
Tbh I don’t actually think this is a repost, I think I confused this sub for the Rust sub
---
Hybridpanda sounds like a child and his high pitched voice that won't shut up at all is actually annoying.

I mean, Overcharge aside, it's not like survivors waking up is really even that much of a problem anymore. Just slap them again and they're instantly right back in the dreamworld.

---
Yeah screw the other people wanting to have fun playing the game, the basement camping leatherface wants to have be an asshole.
---
I also try to forget about addons when rating a killer
---
How great a killet is shouldnt because of addons
---
we know your secrets.
---
you won’t catch us anytime soon.
---
Bonus, like distressing. There should be more bloodpoint skills and perks on both sides to alleviate the grind.
---
I agree that he needs to be stronger. But you're making him more annoying, not stronger. He needs something that helps him in a chase.
---
Damn that feels good
---
Basically if you use those 3 perks from Bill, don't prestige your survivors until you unlock them through Bill
---
WHY IS IT EVERY TIME I AM NICE AS KILLER, I AM NOT A DICK IN ANY WAY, NO CAMPING, LETTING ONE SURV GO, NOT RUNNING NO FUN PERKS. I GET YELLED AT IN CHAT AT THE END OF THE GAME???
---
Yeah this is out of date with the EGC.  The hatch spawns for last survivor guaranteed regardless of gens completed.
---
I didn’t lie, you took that out of context, that was in response to you, my point remains that free perks are the wrong way to balance things. I’m sorry your too thick to understand what perks are, but they’re the little diamonds you put in you perk slots to get abilities in game. Giving survivors their effects for free (ie kindred) is not a good idea for balancing. I’m saying comms shouldn’t be used for balancing as my informed opinion based on my time with the game. SWF does need to be balanced, your method of doing it is simply a poor one. I’ve wasted enough time trying to educate you, but I have more important things to do, good luck in the fog kid.
---
Was that really months ago? I’m bad at time, if so it flew by. Either way that’s still pretty decent compared to some killers
---
It depends on who's asking...
---
kek I know what scratched mirror is. But that person's talking about the NOED crutch. NOED and mirror do completely different things so I don't think they'd have mistaken it :B.
---
That dumb little elephant thing from inside out
---
God dammit devs stop making me buy clown skins!
---
LMAO
---
I think it activates 10 seconds after you hook and lasts 10 seconds. At least that's how it's worded.
---
K. Doesn’t make you less of an asshole.
---
Spirit is better than billy and myers
---
The purpose of generator teleporting is to get them off the gen which it does well, especially when paired with Discordance and/or BBQ. With PGTW not only do you get them off the generator but you get a free 25% regressing kick in too. If the teleport was instantaneous with no warning it'd be unfair to the survivor. You can also use it to bait during a chase or bait people off the gen. I've seen games where the Freddy would fake a teleport causing them to leave the gen and walk right into them, it has mindgame potential. Additionally it just helps you move around larger maps faster if you know they're near a generator even if they aren't working on it. 
---
Putting the dream snares at loops and such force them to walk through it and either drop a pallet early or take a hit even if they see it. While I agree the dream snares aren't that great, they're not useless. They also inform you of where they are if they decide to disarm them while you're away.
---
Fake pallets can be put down even if no pallets have been broken and even if you do have to take some pallets having the fake ones later in the game is very helpful. 
---
My only issues with his design right now are I think teleporting should be available at the start of the trial and I think dream pallets should be part of his default kit with snares and pallets sharing a pool of like, 12 trap placements. Otherwise I really like how he is going to be.
---
Then tell that to the devs. How many times do I have to tell you THEY wanted kindred on base, not me!?
---
Love people who run Object when they don't even have an Exhaustion perk.
---
Hell yeah
---
She is better. This isn't in best to worst order.
---
In high school that locker was voted "Most likely to walk up to your generator, blow a skillcheck in seconds and immediately run away".
---
Ah
---
No u
---
I didn't make a straw man. I merely restated my point because I felt the person didn't understand.
---
Just pointing it out :)
---
Didnt they say on stream that he can only replace broken pallets with dream pallets ?
---
As a doctor main replying all survivors to me I can relate how this is nothing but wanting to say gg wp to the toxic survivors
---
What's the name of the restaurant??? I need to look this place up!!!
---
I don't have enough experience with him to know what rank he is. I've played him only once and I didn't get a single kill.
---
No, he definitely wasn't that high, either. With the amount of bullshit survivors could throw at him and how often his own power fucked him up, he very much was low tier. All the devs had to do was tweak his power a bit and remove all the ways survivors could fuck him over, and he would've been fine.
---
Exactly what I was thinking since Fred has better map control now, it seems.
---
When I saw my end-of-the-year PS4 stats telling me DBD was my most played game I was honestly super shocked. Though now I barely play because I moved to a place with crap internet, looking back I had fun
---
F tier it is then
---
&gt; (I hate posts talking about how Freddy mains are happy with the Freddy rework since all the Freddy mains I ever talked to despised it even more than I do.)
---
This. There were posts about people demanding refunds if Legion got changed, but now all of a sudden the Freddy mains are supposed to just suck it up and deal with it apparently.
---
The hag was blind. I QnQd her 3 times in the same locker
---
Yea is is suppose to put his index in the loop part
---
&gt; There is no longer a ban appeal on the list of queries.
---
You could use "Other" and write as subject "Ban appeal". 
---
Either way, if an argument gets heated enough that you write a comment "that could have been perceived as real-life threat", then there's another, bigger problem you should focus on.
---
I heard something about them making traps not go off when escaping through gate idk could just a rumor
---
What was the ping?
---
Ppl think Pig is bad at endgame but if you get a little lucky and you have traps left for the endgame it can really make life hard on the final survivors, esp. if they want to do altruistic stuff too.
---
Played a game in the last month, you’ll die even if searching
---
I was just thinking the other day that it needs a buff. Blood points are good but what about an actual b uh ff to the perk itself? You could straight up double the speed on it, since it's like 5 or 6% at t3
---
Not really, you really shouldn’t waste that many pallets against billy. When he starts revving, just go for another loop. He’s literally slower than survivors when revving. And if he baits the rev just to walk through and m1, then congrats, you made his power useless against you.
---
Behavior be like \*programming a video game noises.\*
---
Nope, not at all. Just because you're looping the killer doesn't mean that's the only requirement in the game. If your team doesn't do totems and you get hit by NOED, too bad, they fucked up and you happened to be the one to pay for it. They need to learn to do totems next time. And if people leave you behind, too bad to that too. Shit happens sometimes, and that's ok. Just because the last gen is done does not mean you deserve to waltz out the door.
---
She dc'ed
---
Weird thing to be bitter over.
---
I am a knife guy and I can confirm that Legion doesnt know shit about them lol
---
Also the clown's "butterfly knife" is just so far off from a butterfly knife
---
They never said that, and I played the PTB a bit and you can place dream pallets at ANY pallet spawn, even if a pallet did not spawn there prior.
---
"You can say whatever you want" Then so can you, I guess, but that doesn't mean I agree with it. So no, I don't believe that your "totem idea is more fun, more rewarding for both sides and more balance[d]." NOED is fine the way it is; you need to stop expecting the game to hold your hand. And if totems really take that long to do for your team, you're obviously doing something wrong and need to fix that.
---
Clown still has the least cosmetics out of any non-licenced killer or survivor, and he came out over a year ago.
---
So if they are going to do a "one-piece"ish costume for Clown (Where the suit and mask might not fit by themselves or look weird with just the mask, etc.) why don't we have Bunny Feng yet?
---
It is impossible if you don’t have a video but if the OP has the full video also showing names at the end of the game he should be good
---
They don’t trigger if they are put on the survivors after the last gen is completed. Only generators can activate them.
---
Sleep deprivation is very common.
---
No problem!
---
Same here. Keep getting Error lose connection to host when finding game.
---
Why would I be butthurt over the fact you made a shit joke and got downvoted for it?
---
That's what we call projection, bud
---
Freddy better [watch his ass](https://i.imgur.com/q7PViVS.jpg) after the rework, though. 😏🔦
---
&gt;it's spelt queue
---
It's spelled 'spelled'
---
/s
---
I’ve seen so much porn of the skins...
---
Only if it added them AFTER the game. It's not difficult to max out sacrifice points normally.
---
Is this bisexual culture? ❤️
---
Maybe you shouldn’t have gotten downed in the first place!!! Gosh I hate how I always have idiotic teammates like you
---
Aw, this is cute. I like it!
---
What exactly is “unbalanced” in this picture? I just see a pig that won against 4 survivors and only one gen was done. Now if your talking about unfair match making then you miserably failed at that since your only showing a picture of a killer doing their job.
---
Perhaps,, 👀
---
Alright, so every single survivor can exactly the same as the killer, thanks for clearing that up for me :)
---
Been awhile since we've seen this.
---
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHY IS EVERYONE I PLAY WITH SALTYER THEN THE GODDAMN DEADSEA. THEY JUST BECOME SALTY OVER THE SMALLEST GODDAMN THING. LIKE OH NO YOU GOT TUNNELD , THAT SUCKS, BUT SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT IT JESUS CHEIST IS IT THAT HARD TO JUST TRY AND BE POSITIVE ITS JUST A FUCKING GAME.
---
People who are saying dedicated servers wont fix this are wrong and don't understand the issue.
---
2 clients are talking to 1 server who is then showing each others information. If a hatchet is released at point X the server will show the hatchet heading to point X on the survivor's screen. 
---
Right now, we have desync issues from bad "servers" which is the killers machine. He sees the survivor at point X while the survivor sees themselves at point Y. The hit takes place on the "server" which is favored when making decisions. It's basic desync, not lag. 
---
This is why when running around you'll get rubberbanding. The "server" sees you where you were because packets were lost from you to the killer so in the killers eyes, you never moved from that position. 
---
Dedicated servers will solve this issue because it is an unbiased management of killer and survivor. If Killer throws at X and he SHOULD HAVE HIT YOU on his screen BUT server sees survivor at Y, it will not hit. Killer will no longer be at an advantage with higher ping and lag switching like it's 2005.
---
Did it work? I wanna know if what the guy mentioned made a difference in queue time
---
I disagree heavily with that Feng outfit. I thought I saw so many others, why was that the chosen one?
---
Congrats... but.. blah..
---
He is bald - you can see old pics of him online without the hat. I think his toxicity caused him to prematurely bald.
---
I mean ping cannot be the only problem. Hitboxes still suck even counting the delay.
---
Yes this does for me from time to time. At the offerings screen my Xbox will totally crash if I don’t move the cursor around, don’t know why. My Xbox sounds like it’s having a seizure during this lol
---
Nah. I'd estimate c-tier or above from how other people play him.
---
Yep, me with Overwatch for the past 2 years. Saw a great post yesterday that said “That game is one of the few where you can see ‘VICTORY’ and still be pissed off” lol
---
They said they were coming in summer, anybody got an update on that?
---
Just learn to play baby killer  /s
---
Honestly i dont like the counter idea but i think a nice change would just make a bloodpoints event or a sound effect or something of that nature that triggers for all survivors when all 5 bones are broken. Gives information to survivors while not being a blatant counter
---
Hes the first Survivor listed, so most new players would try him at first while they learn the game.
---
So most Dwights are baby survivors
---
Sounds like I was right and you run all the get out of jail free card bullshit perks, meanwhile complaining about killer perks. yikes.
---
 Oh yeah, it should definitely be post game.
---
Yeah, I like doing totems anyway, so it rarely comes into play if the Killer even runs it. Why is two hooks too much? My thinking was two mean that the killer was close to achieving one of their goals (killing survivors) and the perk just helps him close the gap. Kind of like Adrenaline.
---
I could be totally off in that thinking though.
---
I’ll add a /s haha. I don’t think there actually is an F tied now
---
Eh, so? Cosmetics are cosmetics. xD
---
Probably because they got with an anti-tunneling perk when they weren't tunneling.
---
I personally don't disconnect for that reason (I like to keep my bloodpoints) but it's incredibly aggravating to get hit by something because a survivor can't stay up for 60 seconds or gets caught.
---
Wow this was posted... what? 2 weeks ago?
---
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!
---
Sweet lord... Gold star. Your the 1st to mention this. Thank you!
---
Thank you!! 🥰

Dude if you eat that many decisives post rework it speaks to the poor play on your part.  Play to initiate a new chase and pressure gens after hooking someone.  By your account of how games play out it's a given that you go directly back to the hook everytime and use Nurses to find the unhooked survivor.  That's on you man.  Switch up the targets and you'll never eat another decisive again.  I hardly ever get decisived anymore because I play aggressively and switch the targets.  This is a personal problem with your playstyle.  Decisive does not reward bad play it punishes players like you that tunnel.

Mom told me it's my turn to repost this image.
---
Lol hags don’t camp... they have their traps there so there’s no need
---
I’ve been getting this for the past 2 days. Keep searching, you’ll get in eventually.
---
I’m wondering if it was something to do with dedicated server migration. Rumor was they were running on the PTB.
---
Seems to be a problem with ps4 right now, I can't find any games and there's a post a bit lower with similar issues.
---
Still seen it enough times to last a lifetime though
---
Yep! They're coming to the game.
---
HMMMM
---
Love it
---
New doctor
---
No I'm being honest and let save the time for you. You're gonna say "silly" "downvoted" and "projecting" .
---
The hatch was never meant to be a guaranteed escape. Solo queuing in **any** multiplayer game sucks and this community needs to accept that. Miss me with this divisive shit.
---
Apex is actually a free game and pig dlc costs 7 dollars adding it up it costs 22 dollars
---
Or they use blood shards to but perks from the shrine /forehead
---
That's because you seem to be a dumb fuck who can't understand basic concepts.
---
Let me save time for you, and tell you that responding and saying nothing of value doesn't change the fact you're a dumbass.
---
Ciao.
---
Hah he deleted the post because hes trash
---
Why not both?
---
Still waiting for the day someone dies to one of my RBTs.
---
Anyone that thinks wraith is stronger then pig does not play those killers regularly. Absolutely ludicrous.
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
She definitely needs to not be so luck-based. Half her power is based on luck and that's the only reason she isn't at least high-tier
---
You couldnt even get the top 3 right? This is a silly incorrect list.
---
It's a present for the good boys and girls.
---
Honestly I enjoy hos content and generally believe his opinions, but lately I feel he has alot of cliched cringy clickbait words in his title litterally every video...
---
Haha, thank you!
---
You're very welcome! Thanks for sharing!!!
---
There are definitely some resemblances, but I would hope this killer would be a bit less annoying than doctor by not having the "scream zone" and madness effect. Disorientation would just be an unclensable effect that affects only the survivor it is channeled on. It's kind of like a pre-rework Freddy in a way but stronger.
---
weird they still haven't said anything about this? like are they going to fix it so i can play??
---
Not much detail, If **any**.  
---
But it's good for a doodle.
---
Yeah classic one. Insulting and leave. You seem fun, why don't you add on discord so we can hang out there sometimes?
---
Definitely.  Even the obese survivor pallet loops the shit out of kids.
---
Nasty ass Hag. “Just don’t get downed, 4HEAD.” 🙄 Feng should not have gotten you if she didn’t have bt. Your other teammates should either have focused on gens or tried to distract the Hag long enough to get you unhooked. I personally hate leaving a camped survivor behind.
---
You know that you can equip add ons too right? Its doing the objective. You just want survivors to do bones so you have an easier time as killer lmao.
---
Aw yeah, I love seeing baby survivors get really confused when they see that I'm No Mither haha.
---
Im sorry dude, you got baited. Should have just let it go. You were in the right
---
I play a ton of killer and honestly she's at fault too.  She clearly saw the teamate was being toxic and farming and instead of punishing that shit by downing and swapping them out still granting her a hooked survivor no less, she instead chose to take advantage and work with the farmer to tunnel a survivor off the map.  They could have displayed some sportsmanship instead of essentially using the farmer as a teamate to spoonfeed themselves a kill.
---
This is gorgeous!!!
---
I agree
---
Then how do you run Surveillance on Spirit, you monster?
---
Did you ending up getting 2? or is it 2 as fast? what was the strange med kit like
---
?
---
my streamer treatment is russian roulette spirit with prayer beads and an ebony mori
---
^(\*happiness noises\*)
---
This happens often in my matches... Why are No Mithers either a.) The best survivors in the game b.) The survivors who hide in a corner all game, or c.) Survivors who don't use NM but wanna meme around? Lmao xD
---
On the wiki, it mentions that the French, i think, pronunciation of Entity is feminine. Or something like that.
---
When should I start trapping survivors? I main Pig, but I just can’t figure out when a good time to start trapping is.
---
I LOVE THIS.
---
I one  tricked Freddy but I never had trouble with SWF or without in all ranks.
---
What addons/perks did you use?
---
If what you are saying is true, then I hope they look into it and reverse it. Having obviously non-threatening language set the precedent for bans would be horrible for this game.
---
I always 4k as freddy.
---
(I do slug when there are only 2 survivors over but what ever).
---
I got fucking destroyed when I started playing him but now I can play while being sleepy and still get 4k
---
I do not want to sound arrogant but it is hard for me to belive that people say that he is weak.
---
I see other players who are much better at Freddy than I am and they know so much about him it is amazing.
---
(example did you know that if you hold m2 it looks like you are in the lunging animation and it is really really hard to tell the difference)
---
I do notice that if I do not use sloppy butcher it becomes really hard and without range addons it feels impossible.
---
So I wonder what do you usually use for Freddy builds?
---
Explains how I saw it right away.
---
Because I sleep too little for my own good.
---
Surveillance was on shrine twice
---
Yeah but you can get them all for free.
---
Then why would Ash even be there?
---
"This bloodthirsty emotion-eating monster that seeks out humans from Earth to feed from or torture into killers has nothing to do with my prophesied purpose of saving humanity. That would be ridiculous, and nothing here will go wrong."
---
Yeah but I can play on twice that ping and generally not be hit by shit that's not even on my screen
---
I don't rank him low bc I think he's a terrible killer, it's more like the killers immediately above him just bring more tools to the table whereas wraith suffers the fate of being a pretty bland m1 killer.
---
Yessss another feng skin, I’m so happy
---
Yet you are only bringing up scenarios where only the killer is screwed by having higher rank survivors against them. Yeah not biased at all ;)
---
the DBD Gods spared you
---
It fits with the lore, too. It doesn't matter if the survivor escapes or is sacrificed, they still end up at the campfire, still trapped in the entities domain
---
That time i didn't escape. So unfortunately i couldn't see what is this.
---
oooh yea i havent played in literally a year lol sorry
---
yea
---
Okay Snowflake, thank you!
---
Dine time, bitch!
---
No, but OP seems to have this on for that reason instead of a not so good PC.
---
He’s on PC and has them turned down so he can see the red stain thru walls slightly.
---
It’s kinda shitty like the other comments said.
---
*laughs in Trapper*
---
Myers easily has the 2nd worst early game out of all the killers and once again suffers from ultimately being an m1 killer. Ofc he can still be viable if the player is good enough, but imo the killers above him have more options to contest loops, slow down the game, secure reliable downs etc.
---
I think Freddy's going to be much stronger in a straight up chase playstyle though. Hitting someone instantly sleeps them, and this opens up stuff like placing snares in areas for information. (if a survivor is asleep and steps on it, you get a noise notification)
---
His old "passive" stalling playstyle will be missed though. 
---
He does have addons that reduce the action speed when asleep, but it won't even be as strong as base-kit freddy's 50% reduction. 
---
I still think waking up will be important with New Freddy so the snares are less of a problem out of a chase, and so you can memorize pallet locations if you're playing against a Pallet Freddy.
---
I would say: 
---
S: Nurse, Spirit
---
A: Billy, Hag
---
B: Huntress, Plague, new Freddy, GF
---
C: Legion, Myers, Wraith, Clown
---
D: Pig, Trapper, Doctor (absolutely worthless without addons, none of these deserve anything above D-tier) 
---
E: Leatherface
---
Nah I just had it in a background tab
---
Wraith isn't as bad as he used to be, lower mid-tier I'd say.
---
I love idubbbz
---
I also one trick Freddy and I will be honest I was shocked on how fast gens were done.
---
I am not used to it at all.
---
The new Freddy feels like I can do everything right but still lose because if I win or lose depends on the survivors.
---
With Old Freddy I always won as long as I used sloppy and range addons.
---
How is the new Freddy with no stall no aura reading, hag traps but weaker/ or just the fake pallets ( I do not even need to explain why the pallets are bad) better than The god of stalling/tracking/first hitting himself?
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
As soon as u down the survivors coz after end game, traps are useless.
---
I’ve never played either and I’ve seen both done well, it’s just from my opinion based on their abilities that I know of. Calm down buddy.
---
Oh so he’s giving himself an unfair advantage.
---
LMAO its not about it being FREE, wut? Its about the fact they purposely put the price on it to be, JUST BARELY not enough for the 10 dollar pack of Auric cells. The skin is 1188 if i remember correctly. Its just money grubbing bullshit and should be 10 dollars.
---
Someone playing as if the game was real life and just hiding
---
Laughs in old Freddy.
---
Believe whatever you want. The general consensus among killer mains is that he is the weakest of the bunch, even for people that can play him effectively... including “popular” players among the DbD inner circle. 
---
He’s my personal favorite killer in terms of lore and everything, but as far as comparing him to other killers?? He’s not that good, at all. 
---
If you are having that much consistent success with him it just means you’re an all-around above average skill player. 
---
I change my build with him frequently, but typically go with aura revealing perks.
---
I just can’t wait to get the game on pc cause PS4 games take 30 minutes to find and you can only play during the day
---
Every rank 20 worth their iridescent shards knows you can't work on gems if the killer is chasing someone, you always wait until everyone is safe before you work on a gen just to be safe
---
It’s all opinion and what BHVR thinks will work in the game
---
Your lobby might be stuck
---
Yeah, every survivor makes a noise when closing the locker door.
---
Youre wrong about it inherently being unbalanced.
---
And apparently gives you an advantage by making the red stain super bright.
---
Kinda low balling their own game if they picked the clown one aren’t they
---
Blood web
---
Until they make it a normal price.
---
Thats the whole point I was making ? Haha nice one Sherlock
---
In the hell.
---
Brent killed a guy
---
I JUST TOLD HIM TO EAT A BOWL FULL OF DICKS AND HE SAID "REPORTED" IM SMELLING SERIOUS HYPOCRISY
---
It goes into the bloodweb and then you can unlock all 3 tiers
---
People don’t play Doc optimally.
---
They waste his tracking right off the bat instead of saving it until they need to find people.
---
I think discombobulation could be his ability, since its overpowered, especially if you have 1 survivor left
---
mmh i don't know, i see a better % of win at bad ranks in other games than here. I think the problem is that here in dbd, we don't have a good set of rule to punish who dc or attempt the escape just to suicide.
---
Nice! Either way you did an excellent job!
---
i usually play on 97 to 240 ping. i dont find good pings at all. but green pings are like that clip above.
---
Dedicated servers won't fix this. Lag is lag.
---
say wahatttttttt
---
It will show up like any other perk at that point. You have yo find level 1, then level 2 etc. With each individual character to have it on all.

They announced the Anniversary contest winners and those cosmetics will be implemented in game
---
 i want them to not do bones so I can use NOED
---
There were a lot of really well done cosmetics. To be honest I was kinda hoping they would decide to add multiple with how good a lot of them were. I do really like the elephant clown though so i'm not too upset lol.
---
How can you have E tier with no D tier?  Makes no sense to me.
---
Also, Trapper on B tier?  I'm new, but more then half the time survivors will find and disarm traps I've placed.  Most of them in non-obvious spots, like tall grass, behind corners, etc.
---
r/dbdLFG
---
Thanks! Will delete my post
---
Well if his one shot is his best characteristic, then where would you place GF? GF's 1 shot is much more reliable albeit only on one surv at a time, but GF also has much more mind game potential than MM.
---
*saves teammate*
---
*starts to heal them*

Me:See you at the exit gate

Boyfriend’s the same way, though I still have yet to get him to join. I’m slowly converting others in our friend group, though.  Mwahahhahah!
---
Who has a friend who sings the songs?
---
You would have gotten out of LOS of her hatchet
---
He’s not wrong.
---
This is true but Xbox’s game pass isn’t there online service so there’s two subscriptions you’d have to pay for to play online and play dbd
---
No way
---
I love how Meyers just looks so done with her shit. Perfect sequel
---
Anyone else take screenshots with every mori
---
Fortnite is free to play though, I'd say say comparatively expensive cosmetics are absolutely fair in that game.
---
Why the downvotes?
---
ew stop please why
---
Really? Damn, thank God I didn't went for a Xbox One 2 years ago.
---
Just do that ? Pffffffffffff
---
wew Jane is thicc af
---
What chapters ?
---
To be fair most of them were amazing and they could have easily chosen more, but it was always only going to be 2 so either way players would have wanted different things. I absolutely love the Clown one as it’s whimsical and fun.
---
ELEPHANT CLOWN
---
That could work too, it would make sense lore wise too, make it feel like the entities power is weakened just by hearing that sound.
---
If DBD wants to just feed me Nurse challenges, I would love it. Had a "blink and hit survivors 4 times", took me like 35 seconds
---
It is tho, there are similar outfits in the store now that are the same rarity but different prices.
---
Happening to me but whenever I find a game after like 10 mins the killer DCs or the game is broken to where I can’t escape
---
Except it is. The cheapest pack is $5 and gives you 500 cells. You either buy that pack three times or buy it once and then get the $10 pack that has 1100 cells. There also will be more people who don’t have enough cells left over than ones who do.
---
STOP DISCONNECTING DURING LOADING WHEN YOU SEE THE KILLER USE A SECRET OFFERING (MORI)!
---
AT THIS POINT, A SECRET OFFERING DOESN'T EVEN MEAN MORI ANYMORE, IT JUST MEANS DBD WILL FREEZE BECAUSE SOMEBODY QUIT AND YOU EITHER HAVE TO WAIT 5 MINUTES OR RESTART THE CLIENT AND LOSE YOUR OFFERINGS.
---
Have you seen Ninja Brian??
---
I’m completely new to DBD, only having about 2 hours on it, but I’m enjoying Nurse from the one game I’ve played of her. Now I’ve been waiting for 10 minutes to play as Killer, though. FeelsBad.
---
I’ve accepted since the contest began that people will lose I will lose but this didn’t deserve to win when I know much better cosmetics where out there
---
Thai is obviously a sarcastic post if you didn’t understand that you should probably go outside more.
---
T P O W E R
---
So, Laurie has two great perks in her loadout as OoO and Decisive are handy. Also, Myers is pretty good.
---
Bill Overbeck is free.
---
The rest kinda blow.
---
“No.”
---
*EXPOSED*
---
“Yes.”
---
I can't be the only person that prefers non-bald Dwight.
---
Yeah, that's one of those that could be a bit OP. I was thinking that if there either was a way for both survivor and killer to see the countdown or get a cue for the time revert or neither know when it occurs would balance it a bit since it could still confuse the killer and be skill-based somewhat.
---
Well if the spirit was smart she wouldn’t have hit the survivor and just closed the hatch.
---
That won't stop me
---
While I would agree that Legion's ability to secure easy injures saves him from being the worst in the game, I wouldn't say that alone puts him right in the middle. And also it's still a good idea to heal against legion as it is really hard for legion to fully chase and put down a healthy surv which contributes to his massive flaw: his lack of lethality. Yes he can slow the game down by forcing survs to mend and heal, but other killers can slow the game down more effectively like pig, who can force survs off gens but also has tons of mind game potential for reliable downs. Not saying he's an ineffective killer, just pointing out that other killers have what he has but better.
---
Yeah I quite like Myers tbh. Thanks.
---
Toxic people will be toxic.
---
I have my channel in my name.  Played against a SWF group who also had a streamer.  While at the campfire, I opened his channel, saw he was live, then closed it.  Post game, I went back in, just in time to hear them call me old and gray.  I'm 35, BTW.
---
Another game, guy tells me that I suck and no one wants to watch a R20 killer.  I stream for fun, but why do you need to be a dick?
---
But onto the main question, why target a streamer?  If they are live, you are "embarrassing" them in front of their viewers, by making them look bad or making the stream boring.  Like if you are slugged and can only crawl around, that's not really fun to watch.
---
I personally play not bald Dwaldo
---
Auentin is only for Pharmacy and even then that perk is kinda... ehhh.
---
well if you play video games serious then i totally understand, that used to be me before realising everyoje is toxic af and moving on to the next game brings much better enjoyment than trying to win everytime
---
This reminds me of a tarot card! Your art is incredible.
---
It's none. They are remaking PTB since it didn't solve any lag.
---
Not to be rude, but that's a stupid statement
---
Ok so I just recently discovered that this is a cosmetic for the clown and now all I see is that weird Santa dude from the show Happy.
---
In order for this kind of strategy to work, you either need a really new/bad killer or a team of four survivors who are all prepared to commit to playing stealthily. 
---
Any killer who knows what they’re doing will not waste 45 seconds looking for one survivor, they’ll patrol gens and find a survivor who isn’t Urban Evading around a rock. What this means is that while the immersed survivors never get hooked, the survivors who don’t hide every time they hear a heartbeat will have to take all the aggro and end up dying well before the gens are done.
---
Naw
---
If you're getting camped and get unhooked and the killer downs you, Decisive Strike isn't broken.
---
If the killer is on the other side of the map chasing and hooking another survivor, and manages to find you again and down you within 60 seconds of your unhook (either because you didn't enter a locker for BBQ&amp;C, because you decided to hide right next to an objective, or because you can't loop) and you DS them, were they tunneling you, or are you just bad?
---
I've finished chases, downed (two hits) and hooked another survivor and come back and find the first survivor healing, and they DS me; is that because I was tunneling them? Is it because I was camping them? Is it because they didn't know how to hide or loop and are getting to stun me anyway?
---
If I'm on the other side of a map and hook another survivor first, why am I getting hit with DS?
---
Yeah something is fucked on PS4. I get the same
---
You know what I do when I see a meme that doesn’t strike my fancy?? I keep scrolling...
---
You'll be back.
---
They always come back.
---
Death is not an escape and neither is uninstalling.
---
We'll leave a hook for you

Adams perks are pretty good as well
---
agreed!
---
I don't play Bubba but I would love any of his dressed up outfits, especially his Pretty Lady outfit.
---
I know Freddy doesn't have a lot but I found photshoots of Englund with the freddy make up on in a suit and I would honestly love that on him.
---
And I don't know how obscure this one would be, but I would LOVE a cosmetic for bill that adds his Beta outfit, I love his jacket in the beta versions of L4D and I would love to see that as a cosmetic for him.
---
No extra whiff here, but last game I played it did feel like my lunge was shorter than it should be.
---
I know both she and Hag had shorter lunges for a long time (IIRC it was a bug related to their movement speed). Maybe that's back and causing you to miss more hits than normal?
---
Yeah, but I figured deliverance was on the shrine this week so.
---
Like most other online PVP games tbh, but in DBD it's a lot more frustrating because it's an asymmetrical game and there's nothing much you can do if your survivor teammates have a combined iq of 10
---
Quick and quiet into the locker is the only way to enter with no noise
---
true
---
What about curtain call ?
---
Any argument against stealth counter play runs the assumption that survivor gameplay must ALWAYS consist of pallet looping killers. That isn’t the case, clown, spirit, and nurse are examples where stealth is a more viable option as they all have anti-loop capabilities. Your loadout is your own choice.
---
Thanks :)
---
It's the outfit is $10.88 but if you don't already have the 88¢ in your account you're forced to buy an extra $5 worth of cells if you want just that skin. I paid $20 and was able to get both outfits.
---
FOR THE TEAM
---
well crap
---
well we can run so 
---
bye
---
TBH I wasn't expecting a well-reasoned, thought out, and moderate response from someone on this sub. So props for that. I think my first response may have been a bit harsh because you were replying to a guy saying he would DC against every Huntress with an add-on he doesn't like, so I was under the impression you were defending that. And I definitely don't want to play with people like him who routinely DC prematurely just for being dealt a less than ideal hand, and if the only option we have available to avoid getting stuck on teams with people like that is the blunt instrument of bans, I'd rather have those players banned than have to put up with them pulling that crap. While you make a good point about subjectivity, from comments I see on here and in post-game chat, I feel like DC-ing prematurely is universally hated enough that it would be a reasonable measure to take.
---
So that's what I was talking about, which is very different than what you're talking about in your last comment. I will concede that DC-ing after being downed on death hook really isn't a big deal -- honestly, at that point I don't think it should even be displayed as a DC in game, just as being killed.
---
Going back to subjectivity, I agree that is part of what makes these conversations difficult. I do think at least a _semi_-objective definition of "toxic" exists that is generally accepted in the industry (any behavior that serves no gameplay purpose and is performed solely to try to make another player feel bad), but players tend to (in my opinion) misuse the term for any gameplay they personally dislike or just find more challenging to play against than they're comfortable with. So because people throw around the term "toxic" for both mechanics that the devs intentionally put in the game that they personally don't like or have trouble dealing with (e.g., specific ultra rare add-ons, or even just Nurse blinking in general, for some survivors; flashlights or DS for some killers) and also for behavior that is done exclusively just to piss off other players (e.g., teabagging, insults in chat, etc.), it conflates the two in a way that makes it really hard to have intelligent conversations about these issues.
---
But I guess the point I want to make is that just because people confuse those two things doesn't mean a line between the two things doesn't exist. And some behavior can be seen to fall objectively on the toxic side, and I do support banning players from public matches if they repeatedly engage in behavior that clearly falls on the toxic side of that line.
---
But, that said, I suspect you would argue that DC-ing is not as clear cut as the other behavior I talk about above, and I think you'd be right. But even there, I think certain patterns of behavior can be shown to be detrimental to the fun of the game for _most_ players, even if it's more subjective than full-blown toxic behavior. And I think most reasonable members of the community would agree that players who routinely DC on or before first hook just because another player is using a legitimate game mechanic that they personally don't like are detrimental to the fun of the game for everyone else in that match. I agree it's less cut and dried than some other issues, but still one that I think the devs should address, and unfortunately bans seem like the only likely way for it to get addressed. (Letting us block other players would deal with the subjectivity better, but devs have already said blocking won't happen because they don't want players, e.g., blocking all nurses or all survivors who run DS.)
---
Sorry, kind of a long rambling post because this is a complex issue and you do bring up some good points, but basically I guess the tldr of what I'm trying to say is this: There's a difference between true toxicity and just getting a match that isn't exactly what you want. The first one should be eliminated from the game to whatever extent possible, which would largely eliminate legitimate reasons for early game DC's. But the second one is just part of playing in public matches. People who can't handle occasionally getting dealt a bad hand shouldn't be playing public matches, they should stick to Kill Your Friends, where they and their friends get to have total control over what the match is like, and can agree via Discord (or whatever) to rule out certain add-ons or strategies the group doesn't enjoy.
---
I would just buy it for Freddy after the rework.
---
Cheers for reposting my meme without crediting 👌
---
There is a discord, however I don't know the link. Perhaps someone else does?
---
The discord of streamers/youtubers might be your best bet if you don't find people on reddit.
---
What's your skill level? If it's more on the lower side i'd suggest streamdads community, only positive people there.
---
I see what you’re saying, but I don’t agree with it. You have to do a little bit of everything if you want to get the most out of a match. You shouldn’t just sit and do gens back to back while your team mates die, you should also be helping your team by saving and healing and distracting the killer. The game rewards team work, which involves switching roles as necessary. It’s the same on the killer side - you get more pips and bloodpoints for multitasking and spreading your attention around. 
---
If each person on your team has one “role”, that means it’s one person’s job to loop the killer and if they get caught three times, they’re dead. Expecting one person to take all of the killer’s focus is unreasonable, and not a good way to play survivor. Being a stealthy gen jockey is too easy and if you decide to do it to the exclusion of everything else you don’t deserve to pip, in my opinion.
---
The old Drastic spot, yeah? I'm here too.
---
I just task manager out of the game whenever a mori is used.
---
I personally never use addons like insta heals so I feel like I have the right to never subject myself to moris. :)
---
Claudette has the best invisibility so use her. And also you can sf care and not teammate
---
I want to know but don’t stop the whole search for one error. Give me a notification like “hey fucker the host wouldn’t let you connect, check the NAT” but continue the search in case it was just a bad connection.
---
Yeah I use her or Feng most of the time but wanna play someone new tbh
---
Thank you, I love it.
---
Most free games like Fortnite or Apex force you to pay almost $20 for one outfit. DbD is always almost always on sale so it's not like you have to pay $30, I bought the game for $10.
---
And either way, the outfit is actually worth $10.88  but if you don't already have the 88¢ in your account you're forced to buy an extra $5 worth of cells if you want just that skin. I paid $20 and was able to get both outfits.

You stomped her so hard everyone just died
---
Honestly, the problem for me is that it *isn’t* $15: it’s $10.88. But you can only buy Auric Cells in increments as small as $5 so it feels like you’re wasting $3 if you don't already have 88¢ of Auric Cells in your account.
---
Oh good. I was worried it was just me...
---
Dam I just bought one last week for the first time ever, would like to get deliverance. Can I buy shards? Is that possible. If I'm short it's only by a few. Gone over the next 3 days so grinding it out could be tough.
---
What platform are you paying that much for anything on Warframe O_O
---
Could just leave them on the ground for a minute if you are that paranoid
---
I almost say "you dont make that" all the damn time lol
---
*he sees you when you're sleeping*
---
*he knows when you're awake*
---
*he's making his way towards you now*
---
*leaving blood in his dark wake*
---
Same, though I played league once. Going to be playing again.
---
Oh add Fortnite and Team Fortress 2 onto the list. Then it's literally my body is salted flesh.
---
Same whenever killers run ruin I always get great skill checks but without them running ruin I fuck up for some reason
---
 (PC)
---
Looks like an ingame bug on my end.
---
I started playing after a good few months last night and every game I played the maps were glitched for the whole lobby, regardless if I was killer or survivor. There was no floor and you could move through objects, fall through the floor, etc. I thought the game was just having bugs but my stream said that other DBD streamers had no issue so I reinstalled the game and the map glitch issues stopped completely but now I can't queue as killer. It just says searching for match forever. I've reinstalled twice and deleted my GPU drivers then reinstalled those. I can easily queue as survivor but killer won't ever match make me. I don't see how it could be coming from my end but it seems to be so.
---
Anyone ever have this issue or have any other ideas how to fix it?
---
Here's an example of last night before I knew it was coming from my end.
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/HeadstrongHorribleNeanderthalChefFrank](https://clips.twitch.tv/HeadstrongHorribleNeanderthalChefFrank)
---
Anyway i can get a link or something? Which one is the dbd mobile game that im looking for bc a bunch if generic ones pop up.
---
hi frank
---
The game is literally over, though. They got a 3K. Why DC?
---
It’s the same fight between the hot dog buns not having enough buns for the dog packages so then you gotta buy two bags of buns. League of Legends does the same thing. It’s just a way to make more fun, we don’t like it, but people still buy it so it clearly works. Life is unfair! ☹️
---
Me, swf doesnt load, and killer tells me i need internet access to play, etc.
---
Disappointing skin
---
Right, so its $15 dollars.
---
Honestly, the problem for me is that it *isn’t* $15: it’s $11.88. But you can only buy Auric Cells in increments as small as $5 so it feels like you’re wasting $3 if you don't already have 88¢ of Auric Cells in your account.
---
LOL ME TOO
---
I once went against him when he was playing killer and I clicked my flashlight, that I found on the ground, once and he got triggered lol.
---
No it's $12 but you feel like you're wasting $3 because you can't buy $1 Auric Cell Packs.
---
I have convinced 0 people. They take one look at the game and decide it's too hard and it would probably be frustrating. They arent wrong though.
---
And then you remember Billy also has a shotgun cosmetic.
---
This is stolen from u/Shitty_Watercolour. Sad it got 1k+ upvotes, tho.
---
You are. Legion is really D-level right now.
---
Sabotaging a corner of the map so I have a literal god-zone to aggro the killer into.
---
Such a nice looking art style!

Nurse?!

yes it is me

Probably because it wasn't their submission
---
You're an idiot. It must suck to suck. If you spent more time playing the game instead of wasting that time on here you might actually be good at the game. But you're not. Instead you're here making wild assumptions about how I play the game. Face camping is an option and a choice if I choose to do so for any reason and not a playstyle. If you could read you would have seen I already said that. I shouldnt have to break it down to the level a 3 year ild could understand. But again, here we are with me explaining simple English to someone with the mentality of that less of a 3 year old.
---
Pretty sure that was lag switch as others have pointed out. I've had a couple matches just like that. Perfect green ping in the lobby and then shit like this.
---
die in the  h e l l
---
We've just watched Nea's origin story on how she became a Killer.
---
What’s the difference? Still don’t get why people are so mad over a skin. Either you like it and get it or you don’t. No one is forcing people to cough up the money.
---
Nice steal.
---
ps4 idk the currency range on pc compared to ps4
---
Pig = upvote. Oink!
---
Boost the achievement? What do you mean?
---
Why does this sound like a david lynch movie? Lol
---
I was going to say the same but you can't say anything to someone who has lost their mind a long time ago. They'll just come back at you with something even more extreme and even more unrelated.
---
He got frustrated and worked up and probably missed the swing because of it. I remember these moments as killer when I was still less than 200 hours in (total playtime) and I would jump the gun so often.
---
Nowadays I tend to kiss opportunities because I'm reluctant to miss 
---
I'm bad.
---
Depends on what teachables you already have unlocked from the shrine.  
---
Laurie has D strike as a teachable and Mikey is a lot of fun to play and is one of the best designed killers with diverse add ons but his teachables are all fairly mediocre,  
---
Adam has Deliverance which can be situationally great and Pebble Time for the memes.  The spirit is high tier and has Spirit Fury as a strong teachable.  
---
Kate has Dance with me which is great for window vault tricks and comes with Clown who has Pop Goes the Weasel as a teachable which is especially strong since the buff and Bamboozle  
---
Tapp's teachables are pretty bad, Pig has make your choice which is great.  
---
Jane's perks are all mediocre as well as the plague's.  
---
And Quentin's perks are hot garbage, literally no reason to level him up
---
Is brutal strength still good? I haven't used it since the nerf
---
Yeetos
---
He's not talking about steam currency, he means the currency in game called "auric cells" and you can only buy THOSE in specific increments which forces you to buy more than you need
---
why are you using wakeup?
---
Get a free 10% more BP per piece of advert gear!
---
Did you seriously design a killer around Elsagate?
---
Man I sweat so hard and finally got my Adept Freddy, but I really couldn't use any of his perks because they are all end game oriented and I lose a lot of points in the Gatekeeper category. Ok game, sorry for trying to use a characters perks to the fullest I'll just camp gens next time.
---
Maybe...
---
It connected with Nea’s soul
---
Lmaoo
---
Game has been $20usd for a long time now, not to mention it was only $10 a few days ago lol
---
I can;t wait for it, it;s gonna be awesome
---
Oh boy a rank 17 and a rank 12, some poor killer is about to have **FUN**.
---
Yeah a skin for him is well deserved

After I bought that drill all I gotta say is: BZZZZZZT
---
I remember seeing it and I really love it
---
Pretty much same. 
---
I can convince my friends to try it, but once it gets past the immersed stage (In about 3 hours, usually) they conclude that they'd rather put their effort into something else. I can't blame them really.
---
More or less.  The kind of player who sees someone else getting chased and stops working on the generator to hide behind a rock even though the killer isn't on them.
---
They should just add all of em for $2 a piece.
---
same here. feels bad that all my friends think its too grindy or too hard at this point, go figure. i have one friend who plays sometimes but they started playing the game of their own accord.
---
Are there pallets there?
---
I've been having these issues since yesterday
---
I wouldn’t even pay 2$ for the whole clown skin
---
Woah finally some OC on the subreddit
---
Then don't.
---
Definitely not, lol
---
Looks like Army
---
What I’m saying is it shouldn’t have won 🤡
---
level nurse for her teachables, stridor and a nurses calling are both great on nurse
---
Legion was made to hold hunting knives, not karambits lol, use the other knife if you don't like how they hold that one
---
Yeah all I would want is most or even half 2k to be a black pip. Not be impossible to even do that like right now.
---
Same with solo
---
Get the Halloween Chapter. Laurie’s Decisive Strike is a great perk and Myers is my personal favourite killer
---
lol I like how now I'm suddenly a hunter main because I'm not buying into your crybaby whining about iri hatchets. Bottom line is:  if you're dc'ing against stuff in game because "waaah I don't like it" you're a coward, go play a different game. A killer who DC's because they get looped is a coward, a survivor that DC's because they got downed is a coward, you're just making the game worse for everyone else acting like that.
---
on the forums ? :D og viewer ??
---
I want ten
---
Honestly I think people overreact on the Adepts. They really aren't that hard.
---
Don’t really like Freddy that much though. I mean he might be cool to play as but I HATE facing him as a killer.
---
Anyone that feels the need to take perks or addons as either killer or survivor is a baby, change my mind.
---
1 k is derank
---
2 is black
---
3 pip
---
4 double pip
---
And everything else boosts bp generation
---
That's basically the old system that got removed because ppl complained a lot
---
Feng skin yay that clown skin yeah no
---
Lotta peoples faves by the sound of things. Probs gonna do this
---
What’s the saw knife? What character has that
---
Best name ever
---
that claudette that did literally nothing but still tbags at the gate
---
God forbid a game is challenging
---
Okay, thanks a bunch!
---
I love the warping reality theme, the villains who use these types of things are always my favorite. I want this as a killer.
---
Of course
---
I've not played fortnite but have played league a decent amount. In league to even have a chance at owning a few characters without a massive grind you need to cough up money. 
---
Both are as bad as eachother imo. 
---
But they're also both free, and have to make money somehow so its understandable.
---
Killer Tier Lists are made having a Rank 1 Optimal Survivor Team in mind
---
I would get nurse's calling on your spirit if you main her.
---
Really fun to find self-caring claudettes and smack them back on the hook.
---
Enjoy your report thief
---
If your lucky, you can match up with a group of 4 friends and they just let you do the achievement, takes a lot of patience thou.
---
Does the saw even have any new noises? I only bought the drill and I am loving the new sounds, but I don't know if the saw has any sounds.
---
People havent figured out the cosmetic market is more about supporting the longevity of a product you already love.
---
The cosmetic you receive is just a bonus.
---
So yeah it costs money... they have to keep making the game and pay liscense holders.
---
If that doesn't work for you don't buy it.  It's not like you can even see the skin you fanning your ego with
---
I was extremely tired and am extremely tired while I was making it. I had to add F and E and D because the list didn't have those originally so I must've forgot. 
---
And I'm not referring to only vanilla versions of the killers when making this. I take note of how good their perks are and how good their addons are.
---
Downvoted for the truth because it's popular now to say "It's not hitboxes, it's lag!"
---
Hatchets have a circular hitbox that is a larger than the hatchet itself. Nea's hurtbox was within the radius of the hatchet and so she got hit even though it missed her. All the good ping in the world wouldn't have saved OP from the above hit.
---
They changed the hatchet's [circular hitbox once](https://m.twitch.tv/lmclean_bhvr/clip/SolidCovertStingrayWutFace), but reverted it because it made a lot of Huntress players upset.
---
i have a few files that make the stain bigger but can't be banned since it's in the usersettings
---
Same here! I'm also a big fan of Lovecraft-style horror, so I wanted something with Cthulhu vibes.
---
It probably has to do with Dedicated Servers migration , but at least they could say something about it
---
Don’t bully me but legion I like how fast pace he is
---
Surprisingly Myers's best maps are the macmillan estate ones
---
Hex: Haunted Axe was activated
---
i always have low settings on all games. It just look much better for me. That's my opinion
---
That could work as well!
---
You're rank 17
---
Hahaha, cheeky billy, get outplayed boy.
---
You didn’t have to attack me like this...
---
I am glad they have finally added a pig mask that actually looks like your mask and the ones in the movies.
---
They’re also the least finicky- Halloween, for instance, has quite a few different distributors for different movies). Meanwhile, New Line own everything related to Elm Street, and Lionsgate own everything related to Saw.
---
I think it's mainly latency issues. But some hitboxes are broken. @HagsMeleeRange
---
a good billy will fake break the ballet if you start going to another loop. Although this was rank 10 so he probably doesn't know this.
---
Bit of a grey area that one, technically you can’t get banned, doesn’t make it ok though.
---
Huh, unfortunately...my friends don't play dbd lol
---
Re-read my post.
---
i love the game, but i also love when one minor inconvenience pops up just as i’m about to play so i can tell myself i’ll have to wait until tomorrow
---
Honestly it’s a bitch to get, you really just need to play against potato’s and get lucky
---
Eh I will always get scared for multitasking
---
A blurry picture, a nightmare Indeed.
---
This is perfect
---
*-Gets GenRushed and teabagged at every pallet/window/Exit-*
---
*-Go to bed severely annoyed, frustrated and sad-*
---
Thank you.
---
They would do that lol but I'm just glad they're adding liscened cosmetics tbh it's gonna add some spice to the stock characters
---
Lol someone called
---
Me
---
A
---
Lag switcher before when my internet was just shit idk man
---
Geez...there’s always one lol. Smh it’s just a game broham!
---
“lol gg”
---
Hacker?
---
See, I just want to play with my friends, but the second something goes wrong, they all start to just fucking ragequit/get mad/trash talk, and then I stop having fun.
---
I get that the game can be annoying sometimes (Hi, Leatherface who camped me for all 3 Hook Stages) but you really just have to learn to enjoy it.
---
If only I could be so grossly ~~incandescent~~ infected!
---
I love playing Trapper on Macmillan. The map seems to have more grass (maybe it's my imagination) and most of the buildings have great points for traps.
---
This happened after a game against a Freddy. A survivor dc’d after gettin put on the hook and the game lasted about 2 minutes after. My game was like this for 2 matches after that.
---
Congratulations on discovering the Minus World!
---
Her traps are great.
---
Look up looping tutorials on Youtube. That’s what calms me down. I’m not the best survivor (currently at rank 7) but knowing that you’re in control of the situation really helps.
---
I'm going to have to start doing my traps this way. I've basically just been putting them on as I down people. Seems like a waste as they usually come off so quick.
---
Get some friends and do a kill your friends where you are a survivor. This will allow you to get used to the pigs jump scare and ghost face allways looking at you.
---
Please do Feng min with the Year of the Pig event cosmetic. Sorry i cant think what it is called off the top of my head.
---
Couldn't he survive the rads
---
I thought the killer was hacking when this happened because my game wouldn’t stop doing it. But it still gave me the bloodpoints I earned at least 😀
---
Looks like Freddy is running away from his Grandpa.
---
Happy for those that like him and will enjoy him.
---
But I don't personally care about him. He holds zero interest to me personally.
---
Here comes the trapper! watch out for his traps.
---
Then maybe a glitch? Because the max blood points is 1000000
---
Why’s the picture slurred?
---
Yes, but destiny, y'know?
---
Another reason to keep leveling her!
---
Prepearing for takeoff
---
I don’t think I’m good at the game because I play with rank 20s I’m decent and win most solo rounds I play but I also just want to have fun with my friends is that to much to ask
---
Ah I don’t take requests, sorry!
---
So the 'Naughty' Survivors are just the ones he couldn't catch, right?
---
...right?
---
I will hard face camp all that teabag. They get so salty, I say you teabag I camp. They immediately leave and don’t say another word
---
Agreed.  But idiots these days are so busy screaming about corporate greed they cant see they can sound pretty greedy themselves.
---
Cosmetic markers are to improve game longevity.  The actual cosmetic you get are a thank you really.
---
I said pity kills, because if you haven't killed anyone by the time noed activates it won't guarantee you a 4k unless you're playing against morons.
---
And put terror radius to be 28 meters? Cmon he’s a freakin baby adult
---
Exactly. My cousin and buddy hate Myers and all they ever say is he needs to be nerfed to the ground and that's it. Like no dude that's not the answer. You can't just have nerf be your response for everything that doesn't go your way
---
D strike is nice to combo with Deliverance, but you need to meet a very specific criteria to use both perks together.  You need to unhook someone safely before you get downed yourself, and you need to be in a situation where it's better for you to kobe because no one is coming to save you before phase 2.
---
It's all good, thanks though. Like I said, the only reason I kept it around was for DBD.
---
I have friends like that when playing OW. It bugs me cause I'm usually positive but then he starts trash talking and they can see were grouped up so that means I'm toxic too
---
How about 32. I want the terror radius to be big enough to be useful for the wail
---
I'm excited for that!
---
Oh yeah
---
"Fuck this game" I say as I'm killed yet again.
---
"I dont even care anymore" I say as I search for yet another match.
---
Oh it was lol. I was pissed off and surprisingly got off the hook then was like "with what do it do?!" And I magically ran to the hatch lol. Man it was crazy
---
Eh it's not too bonkers since Dream World doesnt do auras or slow progression. All it means is you hear the Lullaby + are affected by snares/dream pallets
---
Oh, pardon me, it costs 1188 Auric Cells, but you can only buy 500 Auric Cells with 5$, 1100 Auric Cells with 10$, but you can't directly buy 1188 Auric Cells for a chosen price, so instead you have to buy 10$ worth of Auric Cells, plus 5$ worth of Auric Cells.
---
Also known as 15$.
---
Sorry pal, you dropped the Pallet when I wasn't walking through it. Just gonna walk around it and come break it later
---
Lady luck was nice at that moment
---
That's just not true. The game is a trash map for every killer not named Hag or Nurse. The killer's skill is irrelevant because you just run safe pallets like a bad ai and hope they run out before they finish gens.
---
Mine-mine-mine-mi-mi-mine-mine-m-mine-m-mi-mine
---
Oh yes. Vigo was on my side that match
---
The Macmillin realm is just decent in general for killer. Coal Tower can suck, but the rest are usually pretty fair.
---
Not at all the idea of this post but okay lol
---
Not very smart of him to broadcast evidence for his own ban
---
Dude don't act like going around as a giant pink elephant won't be fun as shit.
---
There's a difference between a challenge and having a map counter the supposed strength of the killer who supposedly used this tactic here in the material world.
---
You don't want to get decisive? Stop fucking tunneling (simple stuff), and borrowed time also punishes camping mostly. Their potential skyrockets at the end game and there are situations where they turn the game around for survivors, but even though they're meta perks they are situational and have counter play most of the time.
---
You shouldn't have a problem with those perks unless you don't want survivors to have anything good, just like survivors who bitch about Ruin.
---
I combat by reviving teammates soon as killer fucks off... while they’re being chased do gens... theyll stop slugging cos you’ll keep reviving so makes it useless but it’s not easy tbf
---
Naw would have preferred like 50 other cosmetics that where submitted
---
Rank 1 survivor here. Dont be afraid of the killers heartbeat. Pay attention to where and what he's doing. The killer is just another regular player like you, no need to panic. Youtube how to run LT walls and killer shack properly. Look behind you often in a chase. Dont throw down a pallet if you're gunna take a hit anyway, the killer wants you to waste pallets. My go to perks are balanced landing, adrenaline, borrowed time and then either iron will or decisive strike.
---
You'll get rid of your anxiety and panic if you start running around everywhere instead of crouching, cleanse totems whenever, bring a flashlight and learn the flashlight save timing. Basically face your fears, be less immersed, go for more saves etc and you'll get better as a player in no time. But dont let anyone tell you rank means anything, it doesnt. If anything, high rank games arent fun. If you play a crouched fearful playstyle, yeah youll panic when killer is on you. But if you run around and even look for the killer, you wont panic at all anymore.
---
I cant stand going against bubba. I cant figure out how to get away from his chainsaw.
---
Oh I know it’s random, just when was the last time it was on the Shrine, if you don’t mind me asking?
---
And I totally, definitely believe you.
---
People love to hate.
---
If you’re in Europe then for sure. I gotta be honest with you. I don’t do lag.
---
Took me forever to covert from F13.  F13 is very much easy mode compared to this game.
---
The bloodweb.
---
Yeah, but double pips are easy in green ranks.
---
It looks better with the other one where the blade is closer to the hand, but still wrong
---
So this is like a doctor with a different power?
---
That's what the randos in this match just did but it didn't work. He slugged everyone to death and is still doing it. He only hooked players when everyone was downed to him. Slugging is just done to be an asshole, why can't it be nerfed?
---
Couple months back.
---
Feels bad, I dont want that to happen to me
---
It's pretty commonly accepted for the killer to camp people while the exit gates are open, even by people who like to play by these made up rules. So in a situation like that, Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike both deny the killer his kill with little effort from the survivor on the hook. Once that injured survivor is on the ground and has someone to body block, there's no way to stop them from getting to the gate. Doesn't that seem like a pity escape to you?
---
OH SHIT OH FUCK
---
You could run unbreakable but it’s honestly really situational
---
I think I'd like to see Myers or Pig. ^_^
---
Removed - Offtopic
---
Probably to open exit gates faster
---
I don't run Unbreakable because I rarely get slugged

---
Given those choices to me, I'd go Plague or Pig.
---
Plague - Projectile attack, able to infect gens, vaults, plus a bonus if survivors cleanse.  I think I'd have a lot of fun playing her.
---
Pig - Something about this character just grabs and holds my attention.  Probably will be the third DLC I buy.  Already bought Bubba, buying Hag next for their perks.  Pig is probably the killer I'm most excited to play.
---
The other three just don't (currently) appeal to me.  I'll eventually pick them all up.
---
Myers is really fun to play and viable as a main. 
---
He also has STBFL which is good on M1 killers. 
---
Play with your good is good on Leatherface, I really don’t know who else you would use play with your food on. 
---
If you’re a camper/bring mori every game then dying light could help depending on the team you’re up against. But I personally wouldn’t play this way.
---
There's also a glitch that if u chase them out with a trap on there head it won't activate because the timer is inactive during chase
---
Anything goes when the exit gates are powered
---
The finger succ was too powerful. 
---
- DJ Clown suffering from success.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time.
---
You're definitely not wrong about that!
---
I just hate when other preople profit off of other's content.
---
Can confirm, I’ve seen 2 Quentins in about 50 hours of gameplay and happened both times
---
Then, as someone who stays at red ranks, tough luck for you I suppose, it's not my experience at all.
---
Good point, NOED is mostly useless after you've hit one person and no one else will come near you. I just felt like you were trying to say NOED was unfair, and I guess my point was that there are unfair perks on both sides.
---
You have good experiences with Wraith? I swear... As soon as I hear that bell or see that it's a Bubba, I tell myself I'd better not get downed or go for saves because people are going to get camped and tunneled.
---
TIL Freddy is the [Beastmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beastmaster)
---
**The Beastmaster**
---
The Beastmaster is a 1982 sword and sorcery film directed by Don Coscarelli and starring Marc Singer, Tanya Roberts, John Amos and Rip Torn. Loosely based on the novel The Beast Master by Andre Norton, the film is about a child who is stolen from his mother's womb by a witch. The child grows into Dar, who has the ability to communicate telepathically with animals. Dar grows up in a village, where he learns to do battle, but the village is destroyed by a race of beast-like warriors under the control of the sorcerer Maax.

Every map has 10-14 max
---
I know this because in troll matches me and a friend go around racing to drop the most pallets. The total count has never being higher than 14.
---
I was 10 feet away from it fixing to round a tree and he mowed me down somehow thru the killer shack window and then had to come all the way outside to pick me up and I never went back next to the window. After I was hooked and died I turned the game off and watched some tv...
---
*and an ebony mori for goodluck *
---
Oh, look how cute he is!
---
I really would like some kind of discounts in cosmectis, some are kind of pricey(like the pig's) and wouldn't mind spending some money on it but $15? That's way too much for a $15-$30 game.
---
Isn’t that an SCP?
---
That was hilarious.
---
I also converted from f13 to dbd. I left f13 as a survivor and killer king. I was fairly decent. Dbd was a trainwreck for me with how different it is.
---
❤️😊
---
I just don't like he has unlimited stalk range but I have to be close enough to him to reveal him
---
Yes.... I unfortunately forgot that.
---
I feel you. I hadn't played for months and when I finally came back I faced a BBQ insta saw Billy that kept killing me through windows. Insane.
---
I do indeed - a couple of Wraiths gave me the hatch in the past or goofed around a bit in the middle of the game!
---
Sorry you didn't have pleasant experiences with them so far!
---
But you're not wrong, I also encountered a couple of camping Wraiths, just not as much as nice ones.
---
How did the match go?
---
Yea that pretty much sums it up...😊
---
Ni
---
I dont know what dbd are you playing but in my games as both killer and survivors i get over 14 pallets commonly. Not all the time but it happends a lot.
---
I don't see anything wrong with it.
---
They're testing to see what they can get away with
---
I feel you, I hadn't played for a month and when I finally decided to do so I faced an insta saw/Bbq chilli Billy that kept hitting through windows. Needless to say I played killer afterwards haha
---
yea ive been trying her more and more but man she's tough.  granted, feels pretty awesome to blink through a pallet after someone drops it and smack em in the back of the head.
---
Replace wraith and pig
---
My wallet safe
---
Easy buff two keys to open the jigsaw box
---
I can't believe this goofy clown cosmetic won. There were so many great and brutally stunning Spirit, Hag and Nurse outfits... Not this childish elephant which makes me giggle when I see the killer... The opposite should be the case.
---
I'm sorry, I don't get it.  What's not fair?
---
I’ve gotten a few people addicted to this game like its crack! 
---
I’ve also had people Who have tried it and said no fucking way. Things they told me, the glitches, bugs, camping, getting kicked out of Games, how piss poor it looks, tunneling and not to mention the grind to get somewhat decent perks.
---
this reminds me of that old 72hrs clip
---
how do you make said stickers? do you have a machine for it or does the printer do the job right?
---
Unawares is a perfectly fine adverb, and is used correctly in this case.  Unless you're talking about the fact that the commas are unnecessary.
---
Why? Cause fuck em that's why
---
Deliverance is Adam’s teachable
---
Whoops, sorry about that. I'll fix it.
---
i got into a lobby as killer last night and a swf joined, get into the offerings and they all brought a haddonfield offering. im not ashamed to admit i pulled my ethernet
---
There's a game in this bug :S
---
Well mom loves me more
---
Although if you buy them BHVR will probably be able to get more cosmetics for these licensed killers if the studios see that they make money.
---
Nice. Haven’t seen a Wes Craven’s New Nightmare meme since October 2017.
---
Smart person.
---
Player base is not as toxic as people make it sound. It’s just as toxic as pc player base. I play on both and it’s not that bad. Frame rate as killer and using a controller as killer are the biggest things you’ll have to get used to.
---
I love this game. I rage at it a lot but I can play for hours on end. My friends however? They play one round or two rounds and then rage quit :(  but I think this game is great
---
This gives me some awesome horror-y feels. I like the immersion.
---
Also is that mah boy Dwight being dragged by the hair? I fucking hope so.
---
^(I may or may not have a gore fetish.)
---
She was already nerfed a while back
---
Which one will that be? That's a nice brutality.
---
Really cool art, man! How long did that take you?
---
I personally like empathy just because if someone gets smacked you immediately know where the killer is regardless of distance but I could see a strong case for bond too.
---
I know I'm still a nüb, but I don't get all of the negativity. This game is a fucking blast! I'm sure the salt will build up with time though, like the cheeks of a wah wah baby!
---
Oh really what was nerfed?
---
Surprisingly is the main part. But good to hear.
---
Is tHAt MeGAmiNd?!!1!
---
Weath lol.
---
My friend playing with this was stuck either gen tapping or playing baitfish/distraction duty.
---
He could easily make a snowball hook with the others, camping is not cool in any reason, he'd make way more points without camping.
---
On top of that... I haven't used it
---
Filthy claudette main
---
Just wanted to make sure it was clear that I was not conveying an opinion, but making a logical correction.
---
Think of it this way:
---
In a soft market, you can determine the impact of what you *do* choose to support. The impact of your purchase cannot be taken away.
---
You cannot determine the impact of what you *don't* choose to support. You have to accept that it's a market designed to support singular individuals who can exhibit the spending capacity of multiple individuals, and you choosing to abstain from purchasing is not the same thing as taking away a purchase from the developer/publisher. 'Don't like it, don't buy it' is common sense, but its importance is frequently overstated. It's easy to think the world's just full of sheep that must secretly like microtransactions, but in reality it's because 100 whales can have the impact of a million gamers.
---
I'm not gonna apologize for a damn thing. THere are no rules to this game. you don't gotta like a single thing about how anyone plays the game. In fact, you don't even have to play it but you damn sure as hell ain't gonna tell anyone how to play it. 
---
Not even gonna bother replying to any of the rest of your bullshit because it's highly based on wild accusations and assumptions. I literally just said IF i chose to do that there's nothing you can do about it. 
---
Enjoy writing your novels of self importance and mission for virtue-ism I'm sure you'll get real far in life getting angry at everything anyone says and then proceeding how to tell them how to live their life. Got a mini hitler over here lmfao. No one has to play by your rules. get fucked, retard.
---
“it’s guaranteed haunted grounds! stop cleansing!”
---
*cries in devour hope*
---
A gen being popped activates the RBT now. That’s all it was I think. They added it right when the EGC was added
---
A lot of killers mostly do it to be an asshole tho and it's the most boring "strat" to play against. You can counter camping and tunneling, but it's hard to counter slugging. 
---
A = Gen rushing only exists  when 3 or 4 have BNP. 
---
B = sure, that's fine. Go for flashlights then.
---
C = Just deal with the DS. It can only be used once if at all.
---
D = It depends
---
Lol did they msg u at the end that’s what I wanna see

By "hard mode" he meant immersed.

yup
---
If he hit them, the collision is gone, so they can pass thru him, he prefered to take 1 survivor, than take more points.
---
Probably was like, "Aww man, not a Nurse daily. Hey wait a second, ranks just reset and I don't have the trophy!"
---
I had a nurse daily and I didn’t look at my build but I remembered she didn’t have a lot so I was like “ehh My perks should be good and in game I was like huh? I wonder why those 3 are the only perks I have?”lol
---
Legion is like, mid tier but people still message me saying I only use them because they're op, well NO, I don't even main them bc of their in game qualities, I main them because of the design. Reminds me of Sunny Family Cult.
---
I kinda aimed for Dwight with his arm cut off, but it's kinda hard to see.
---
Ah yes, the struggles of hiding I a Bush until all the gens are done
---
The one where survivors lovingly jump into my arms next to the basement is great.
---
On a serious note: Sabo build is fun and risky.
---
I can beat this [dbd](https://youtu.be/qIZfZGmR4-A)

Guess only Meg is doing gens.

I saved once someone with sabo, I laugh a lot as the killer carryes me to the basemant and killed me first hook. Worth

Our lists are almost the same, but for me Nurse is above S in her own tier, Legion is low end B, Wraith is high C, and spirit is S.

&gt; "We have to work as a team, I need you to survive so that I can survive!" — Dwight Fairfield

I think this really sums up my perspective on it: Dead By Daylight is a team game in so far as you need to work together and help each other out so that you personally can survive.
---
I'm sure this would have been conveyed much better in a message than a reddit post.

Well don't think it'll go on the shrine soon

Thank you! Sadly Reddit totally ripped off the quality, so it doesn´t looks so clear as an actual drawing.

There's a salt/rant flair for a reason.

She is only asserting her dominance.

This is true, there's also a rant thread that is for post with little content.

genrushing absolutely does not require BNP to be in play what are you on about

Oh trust me I learned to disregard downvotes or upvotes a long time ago here lol.  I've been downvoted for calling out exploiters like infinite mend legion or wake up abusers.  Logic doesn't always matter around these parts.

This is amazing. The detail and everything. What tops it off is ace being on the nice list

It was probably me crouching while slightly clipping into a tree as p3 claudette. Claudette mains have big brains.

I’VE JUST HAD TWO GAMES IN A ROW OF TWO DIFFERENT SWF GROUPS WHO WERE ALL MUCH BETTER THAN ME AND THEY WERE TOXIC AF. MANAGED A COUPLE OF HOOKS BUT NO KILLS. BOTH TIMES WINNING WASN’T ENOUGH FOR THEM AND THEY STAYED IN POST GAME CHAT TO RUB IT IN MY FACE. TOLD ME TO KILL MYSELF. I’VE BEEN HAVING A ROUGH FEW MONTHS AND STRUGGLING AND THIS GAME WAS MY ESCAPE. SO READING THOSE MESSAGES, THE FIRST THOUGHT IN MY MIND WAS “ WELL, WHY DON’T I?”. I’VE LOST MY PATIENCE WITH THIS GAME AND I DON’T FEEL LIKE PLAYING ANYMORE. WHY DO PEOPLE SUCK SO MUCH? IT’S ONLY A GAME AFTER ALL. YOU DON’T KNOW WHO IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH. TONS OF PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND THIER MENTAL HEALTH EVERYDAY.
---
As if that's practical. I can pull of 0 encounter with the killer on a escaped match. It's the times I get caught that are the issue. It's not that no one saves me. It's that they dont do gens. If I'm the only one popping any then what the hell are they doing? Even then if I dont get caught and the teammates do I cant realistically pop all 5 gens alone especially if their are two or three people dead. Essentially I'm playing until the hatch opens with the way ranks 10-20 have been playing.
---
for a brand new player DBD is really fucking tough when you are essentially thrown in the deep end weak af against people who are potentially much more experienced than you.
---
New killers are just shitty to play against because they don't understand the deeper points of the game yet. I get how it can scare people off
---
For me lately it’s been Nea. Crouching around the map doing zero.
---
*looks at perks* hmmm I wonder why this man got genrushed🤔
---
Ok and?
---
Thing is, even if we had dedicated servers it won't fix the issue of unfair feeling hits. They need to rework the entire lag compensation alongside giving us dedicated servers.
---
YES I HAVE! THEN I GET A FUCK YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS OR I WILL PLAY THE GAME HOW I WANT TO AND FOR ME TO GO JUMP OFF A BUILDING ECT, ECT....
---
ALSO THIS WAS A RANK 7 PLAYER, NOT SOME FUCKING NOOB! ALSO HOW THE FUCK WAS I BEING TOXIC? I LET THE OTHER 3 PEOPLE LIVE AND ALSO LET THEM ESCAPE. BUT IM DONE MESSAGING PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THAT RANK AND SHOULD KNOW BETTER, IF I GET A NOOB BECAUSE THE MATCH MAKING IS FUCKED UP SURE I WILL SEND A MESSAGE.
---
lol I my wraith is lvl 13 😂 not my fault the blood webs don’t give out good perks right away
---
I don't draw in this style so much tho but my normal stuff can be seen on instagram

Btw i will tray to do more this on this style from now on &lt;3
---
Doctor is very strong if well used, I do so much 4k with him at any rank...
---
80 is the standard for most games. If you think 80 is terrible you've obviously never played any other games. The difference between 40 and 80 isn't big if the game has good lag compensation, which DbD doesn't.
---
The owner be like:
---
‘God dammit boys! How many times do I gotta tell ya to use the front doors?!’
---
Did you have the same number of medkits and add-ons in your inventory after the match? If that's not it, it was probably a bug.
---
Why, just why. Why would they all just go in the basement?
---
*$10.88 ftfy. 
---
You have 422 auric cells left over, or a $4.22 credit on the account. The outfit itself does not cost $15.

You may be out the $15 cash, but the $4.22 can and will be applied to something other than the outfit.

Bungie is one of the rare developers that doesn't mess around with high ping players. I really wish more took this approach. 
---
If you have a high ping, they'll let you play their game, you're just not playing it with anyone else.  I had to use satellite internet a few years ago and it was the absolute worst. They offered a plan that gave me unlimited data, but my ping was ridiculous. 
---
I could still play every major MP game except Destiny.
---
A White Ward only lets you keep the item if you die with it in your hands, not if you burn or drop it, I believe.
---
Lv 13 and only shit perks, that's unfortunate man
---
hell yea :)
---
WOAH, it's almost like the issue isn't just P2P but also the fact the lag compensation is bad. WOW.
---
Pebble should short stun a killer if applyed right into the forehead. Not enough to make him drop a survivor, just make him shake hia head, if that was a thing, dbd could have my soul
---
The reason I brought up mori's was because I was pointing out that mori's take away a full opportunity of survival from survivors (because they don't give them another chance to be rescued from the hook, be saved by another survivor, wiggle off, etc.) so survivors having flashlights makes sense because it gives a chance of survival against addons and items like mori. Survivors need more than one way to defend themselves.
---
Now onto your further comments, which confuse me a bit. I think I have to disagree with you, flashlighting a killer kicking a pallet can be incredibly useful if used correctly. You can juke them with it if you blind them (like if you're running iron will or something that helps you hide or juke easier). I don't understand how that's toxic or a bug, if the killer was able to look around during the animation break you would always see where the survivor is going, meaning they wouldn't get a chance to juke. Breaking a pallet comes with a risk but then the survivor doesn't have that pallet to use anymore. It's more than just black and white, both sides are penalized when a pallet is used or broken. 
---
I'm not saying survivors come without their share of balance problems, but I really don't think you're looking in the right direction. In the end, I don't use flashlights because I'm bad at using them, but I've been saved multiple times by people that can use them correctly, and I've also been sandbagged by people that don't. I really don't think it's as tragic as you're making it out to be.
---
You are a P3 Claudette playing survivor tho
---
Yes,she is filthy.She really needs to wash those clothes.
---
Hehe, I'm the Claudette who does two or three gens, gets saves, and then dies on first hook late game because I finally mess up and at that point the killer should actually camp and tunnel. Fun to never be found though, even when the killer keeps coming back to my gen over and over.
---
Yes it does
---
Excuse me? I play both sides as well and as a survivor I rush gens sometimes, but i never use BNP so how is that possible then? Does genrushing mean fixing 1 generator very quickly by using BNP or does it mean repairing all 5 generators in a very quick manner?
---
Ur telling me
---
WHAT ??? holy sheeet ! thx a ton ! ( i normally don't earn anything so it means a lot)
---
Yes i'm sick of it
---
*halloween theme intensifies*
---
r/woooosh
---
At first glance I thought these were slipknot figurines.
---
was spectating a meg who was camping the hatch and told my still alive buddy which locker she was in and the killer let my friend live. And said thanks the match was going on for too long.
---
Same, he's not nearly as cute with a beard, but few men are.
---
I had this happen this morning. Not in SWF...solo que. I was being chased by the killer, and then it said I was "disconnected from host." When I got to the post game screen, it said everyone escaped and me and the killer DC'd, which is super odd because only 2 gens were completed. My pings were good too, so I have no clue what the fuck happened.
---
Yeah it does they literally never do shit in game. Crouch around the map like morons and fuck up skill checks. Bloody Claudette’s are the worst tm8 you can get in this game
---
Hi I'm just having an amazing time looking at all your comments. Please let me know when you have a new account when this one is deleted :) quick question: are you genuinely an ochido fan?
---
Should've been Doritos...
---
Yeah I usually do hit greats but on Ruin, fuck no. Shit lags too hard
---
Only on mobile.
---
This tends to be me when I play killer. I don't play as much killer as survivor, but I've been playing long enough that I could probably be a solid purple rank killer if I tried. I also like to have fun when I play killer, so sometimes I'll just chase people around and hook them a couple times and let everyone go. It results in my rank being lower than it should be, so when I want to have a serious game, I can clean up a little too easily sometimes. It's also good when I play a Nurse game (on console) and people think they can bully/BM me.
---
The game has spaghetti coding so these problems will always be there until they update their shit.
---
N
---
Its not particularly your fault, I apologize for that. But look at literally anything labeled as a shitpost and it all looks basically the same.
---
1) Someone is being toxic
---
2) Just some generic over used image with some text
---
3) Perosn that was toxic got outplayed
---
Everyone posts things like this and it just is so boring.
---
IT'S SO EASY TO BE FUCKING KILLER NOW YOU LITERALLY JUST THROW YOUR MOUSE ACROSS YOUR DESK WHEN YOU LUNGE. IT TAKES 0 FUCKING SKILL. ALSO THE PLAGUE. EASIEST KILLER IN THE GAME TO PLAY. YOU JUST KEEP WALKING BEHIND THEM WHILE YOU PUKE UNTIL THEY'RE INJURED THEN YOU SWING. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE RED MODE SHE HAS.
---
ALSO WTF IS WITH WINDOWS IN THE GAME. YOU CAN LITERALLY VAULT TAKE A STEP AND STILL GET HIT. IT'S FUCKING ANNOYING CHANGE THIS STUPID SHIT.
---
BUT SERIOUSLY, MAKE THE KILLER TAKE SOME MORE FUCKING SKILL FOR FUCKS SAKE
---
It's probably because it's licensed
---
It takes a bit, but timing is different on console. After 1300 console hours I’m just now able to hit great skill checks relatively consistently.
---
Shards only you say? Damn I got a lot of saving up to do.
---
These are the types of Spirits to come out of phase and stand still at a pallet even when on full cooldown. (Ascended) Mindgames!
---
My theory is that if it’s outside the bond range, you don’t need to worry about it. Just continue doing your thing. Bond gives so much more info and it’s filtered to only show you what’s immediately relevant.
---
Although there were quite a few drills in “saw”
---
tf is a weath? Wraith? Wreath?
---
That's a possibility. Thanks.
---
Probably 3rd anniversary cake
---
Dbd and ark... what's a life lol
---
Oh ok. I actually don't know the indicator when they DC so I thought it showed in this video.
---
My goal is to get myself out alive. Teammates are useful for that purpose, and so we can cooperate. However, my life always comes first, so there will be conflict if it’s mine vs there’s. I’ll save from hooks so we have more people on gens, but I also will not hesitate to use Bond to throw others to the wolves if it helps me get ahead.
---
Laurie has some good perks, Adam does too.i really like Quinten because of wake up and pharmacy
---
I know it's late but anybody having problem with the audio? I pulled out my headphones and all of a sudden  the audio is working very poorly. Even without my headset. I can watch YT videos and listen to spotify without problems but the games' audio isnt working. Anybody has experienced this and knows how to fix it?
---
Thanks for the silver kind stranger
---
It is on the roadmap for console FPS to be improved. Hopefully we see some improvements soon, cause I definitely feel your pain.
---
That’s badass!
---
I can criticize what I want, you don’t get to decide that, and the “just do it better” is such a quality argument. Completely showed me whos boss with that one.
---
Well, coldwind maps are usually pallet cities so Billy struggles on them anyway
---
Not that I know of. If you're on PC, you can always change your region to Russia or Argentina  and buy auric cells using their rates. I have my region set to Russia and 2,100 auric cells costs me roughly $7.99 US dollars.
---
Its my last day of premium. You're welcome:)

BUDDY I HAVE GONE THROUGH A TON OF DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, IF YOU NEED TO CHAT EVER MESSAGE ME YOU HEAR?.
---
I'm not a super gamer (arguably pretty bad, actually) and DBD is the second game I've ever played on the PS4. It was a change from Destiny 2 and I find there to be much less grinding on DBD. Working to get bloodpoints and new perks on DBD is enjoyable, actually. Can't say the same for the Destiny grind.
---
I like how they're just standing still without any posing
---
Almost every pallet on the game is safe, this map is not killer friendly
---
🅱️ice

No

Well, Spirit doesn't give a shit about game either. I mean, you can technically block her

---
The 100 emojis really tie this whole thing together.

It’s not fair at all but you held your own pretty well I’d say. They didn’t bully you like they’re probably used to bullying lower rank survivors with their SWF squad
---
repost
---
If the Killer ever sees a No Mitheran they're fucked because no matter how many times they down us, we just keep popping back up.  In all honesty though Unbreakable is your best bet.
---
The next stage should be: Making Mount Ormond.  
---
This map is the next level of terrible map design. Huge, full of safe pallets, for most killers it's gg.
---
what am I looking at
---
name checks out
---
Everytime I see someone shorten object to OoO i just read it like a ghost and it takes me a few seconds before I realize it means object
---
If you consider it a solo game, chances are you might lose
---
There is a crouch button ?
---
No it's not ridiculously slow. It's the same as it would be if you were just skill checking in the safe zone. Regardless, it doesn't matter how many times I hit the skill check, someone will always miss it and lose the progress several times in the process. 
---
This is not something that is rare either or as you put it stilling happening in 2019. Every match I've played this year on PC, PS4  and Xbox with a hex, everyone was tapping.
---
Wraw me
---
Do you use NOED?  
---
I mean, I really want to find something good in Doctor, so I would be happy to listen!
---
That's rough. I'm sorry that happened. I mostly get complaints about my internet connection, which I can do nothing about except stop playing the game. Sometimes I get advice from the killer or invitations to new games from people in the survivor team and my heart warms up.
---
I'm on ps4
---
Even though the chances of you getting slugged are very rare run unbreakable and or tenacity.
---
rip
---
As someone who also has cheap headphones I have no problem finding based on sound! Something that might help is reducing your own white noise, no music, little outside noise if you can control that, in game standing still when you think you've heard something, delaying action etc. if there's a loud environmental piece (gen, bonfire, what have yous) that can't be helped and you're better off looking for blood. 
---
Also, playing a variety of survivors also really helps since it helps you place their noises easier!
---
What rank are you, out of curiosity?
---
How is it? Lol
---
Why don't you just play killer and teach those survivors a lesson?
---
I admire your bravery kind person you
---
You see a lot of weird shit when you’re on barracks post
---
Any killer with more than 2 brain cells is gonna put you on the hook since they’ll know you have no mither the second the match starts
---
I BOUGHT GHOSTFACE TODAY AND EVERY MATCH SO FAR I'VE BEEN MESSAGED AND INSULTED WHEN I JUST WANT A SAFE ENVIRONMENT TO LEARN A NEW KILLER
---
6 on PC, 9 on Xbox One and 14 on PS4. I don't play on PS4 as much as I used too.
---
It takes a long time to get decent with aiming, especially on console FPS, but it’s doable.
---
Genrushing is when you do it in a coordinated SWF. Getting gens done fast isn't genrushing.
---
Use your best add-ons and BP offerings yellow or higher
---
If I remember isn't this just hitboxes in general? I still want dedicated servers like the rest of the community but hasn't hitboxes in general been this shit? 
---
I main huntress myself and can say those hatchets go from "why the hell didn't that hit" to "why the hell did that hit"
---
It isn’t
---
wraith big sexey
---
Plague is more fun.
---
Yeah...     that sums it up.
---
But when you do gens as fast as you can aren't you rushing them?
---
Fun facking fact, other horrors theme restaurants, theres a walking dead themed restaurant, kfc(only scary if you are a vegan) and the kirby cafe

Ya no already been stated .

I have never seen a 4k depip before, the only feasible way I can see that happening is if you let gens fly and then facecamp like half your kills to have an awful Gatekeeper and Chaser emblem.
---
I do agree that Trapper, Hillbilly, Michael, Bubba, Ghostface, and Plague suffer for using their power optimally since they are all capable of downing survivors with minimal to no chase and in less hits with surprise attacks and insta-downs(or trapping them) basically gutting their malicious and chaser emblems to be nothing better than a silver or even bronze. And to a lesser extent all killers w/ certain perks and against certain "unskilled" survivors as well suffer. This is most evident with Plague when nobody cleanses, even if you play your best and kill everyone, if they don't cleanse you basically lose out on half our malicious and chaser emblems since you can only hit everyone once to down them.
---
I'm not against them reworking the emblems, I mean they ARE doing it for survivors currently, so I would hope they would look at killers afterwords. Survivors had it bad not to long ago, if your team was too good, too bad, or if the killer was too bad then you basically had no chance of pipping yourself.
---
Hatchet hit boxes are super inconsistent
---
Accurate
---
Yes they have, dummy.
---
Compare a skillcheck on pc with how laggy and low fps are on console, especially on laggy maps.
---
Even a autistic kid can tell the difference.
---
No pallet nor loops, just trees and lot of fog, I played killer once; no power, just swing
---
Lmao my room has a red light and Christmas lights on. Definitely looks weird in the video lol I could have ripped the video from my ps4 but this was the same video i just sent my friend.
---
When I see killers spewing salt but then see they got 2 or 3 kills minimum. Are you for real?
---
I have more fun playing against ghostface because since he can remove his terror radius he can actually jump scare me occasionally and that’s super fun but I like playing plague more because it’s fun puking to kill people lol
---
Just get a swf group to play with.
---
EVERYTIME I WALK SO MUCH AS AN INCH FROM A HOOKED SURVIVOR, THEY’RE UNHOOKED. BUT CAMPING IS TOXIC
---
Wow :D I am glad that you gave me that compliment :3 thx a ton !
---
Had any BAD games?
---
Also wholesome content.
---
For killers rank reset is heaven because we get our adepts done lol, but I feel you getting back up rank a little after reset happens is either ez game or it’s a pain because all the good players are already way higher rank than you so you are stuck with potatoes lol
---
JUST HAPPENED TO BE A VICTIM OF HACKING!!!!
---
PLAYING AS BILLY AGAINST SWF, WAS ABLE TO HOOK ALL PLAYERS BUT ASH, EVERYTIME I GOT HIM ON MY BACK I WASNT ABLE TO MOVE,HIT, OR HOOK HIM TILL HE STRUGGLE FREE. HAPPENED 3 TIMES JUST ON HIM! KILLED THE OTHER 3 AND WANTED HIM TO BLEED OUT , BUT HE DCED BEFORE HAND!!!!! PLS FIX THIS BEVAHIOUR OR IM GONNA MAIN ASH TOO!!!!
---
Happened to me at least four times already
---
Baby dwight do do do do do do
---
Oh no muh opinion is biased
---
I do agree with you for the most part.  It's a perfectly normal thing to just say whatever you feel.  Though my response wasn't really in reference to your post.  This was a discussion on the statement "if you can't do better, don't criticize".  The opinion you shared is on something that hardly has any depth: The condition of reddit posts. So I agree with you, there isn't much worth proving- though you are complaining about the sub's condition and hypocritically doing nothing to improve it - merely complain about it. 
---
The opinion BigBrain shared is the idea that recommending someone demonstrate clout on a subject is just a statement of ignorance itself.  I say it's not.  Criticism is valuable when it comes with experience, expertise, or example.  Otherwise, it's far more safe to assume it's an utterance guided by ignorance.
---
RIP Kate's bouncy hair.
---
Wait you can see his face? Can we see the rest of the Legion?
---
sorta random but I noticed a lot more girls play this game compared to other games, any reason why?
---
Heck yeah, now the killer's the only one who's salty. Nice one.
---
All I have is 15 cents
---
IRI HEAD IS BROKEN BEYOND BELIEF AND SHOULD BE GUTTED IF YOU DISAGREE YOU'RE DUMB
---
Reread the title mate.
---
I’d buy Ghostface so you can save up iridescent shards to get the Plague. Why not get both?
---
see i dont mind something like this.  There's what, 4 of them right?  
---
why not have all 4 on the map on the same time but each one is confined to a certain area that you can switch to like a teleport that you mentioned?  the idea of multiple killers that you switch to could be fun if implemented right.  right now hes just a guy or girl that can jump over a pallet.  sweet.
---
Lol. Its been 10 months since the optimization promise. So it's a toss up at this point.
---
Did you make the pumpkins as well. I don’t know why (the Wraith is amazing, btw), but I’m much
---
More interested in the staging.
---
JUST GOT FACECAMPED BY HUNTRESS WITH HATCHET DRAWN FROM FIRST HOOK UNTIL DEATH FOR LOOPING ON HADDON. THEN THEY D/C'D BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FAR BEHIND.
---
LIKE, I GET THAT THEY'RE SHITTY LOOPS FOR KILLERS. I DON'T CARE IF YOU FACECAMP ME, AS LAME AS THAT IS. BUT YOU JUST RUINED A MATCH FOR THREE OTHER PEOPLE AND WASTED EVERYONE'S TIME.
---
ALSO I KEPT MY TOOLBOX BECAUSE MY STEAM CRASHED :D
---
WHY BE AN ASSHAT LIKE THAT THOUGH?
---
I agree I was trash and it was a dick move buuuttttttt it was hilarious 😂
---
This pleases me
---
You can argue about adrenaline to some extent, but if you're suggesting that BT and DH are at all unfair or crutch perks, that may be the stupidest statement about this game I have ever heard.
---
Record how long they are holding you hostage and send it to the devs. 
---
If you are on Xbox they have a playback button that records from the past 30 minutes at max I believe. 
---
I would assume PS4 and PCs have this feature as well.
---
Same here! DM me!
---
You forgot ghostface btw
---
Nope! We didn't win all of them, but we had a ton of laughs and it's one of the most fun days I've had in a while. ☺
---
It's a good base, but needs tweaks on both sides
---
Survivors don't get enough bp
---
And killers can't pip properly sometimes
---
They coulda always add a multipler or something, for example if you have a survivor hooked, all actions could have times two point gen or additional points for each gen left up
---
Or just reworking what killers are scored on, like make it hook based, but not kill based like 3 hooks is safety, 6 is a pip, 9 + is a double
---
That could help
---
papa dwight do do do do do do
---
Perfect response you got there
---
I don't think that's too true per se, but when you look at a game like CS:GO or overwatch where voice coms are important female players will often be harassed so they're more quiet about it or try to hide it. In this game that's not a thing so they get to be more focal about being a player, which I guess is one of the reasons.
---
WHY IS IT THAT I'M THE ONLY FUCKING DUDE TO DIE IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES BECAUSE THE KILLER RANDOMLY LOOKED INTO A LOCKER AND WHEN I WAS ON THE HOOK MY TEAMATE PULLS ME OFF JUST TO GET HIT AGAIN. WTF MAN.
---
No it won't. It's not as easy as "have low latency" and everything will be hunky-dory.
---
And it can go with his rework and the summer time
---
Sorry but I’m a bit paranoid about this topic so I can’t play with people that I don’t know but thanks anyway I’ll go and try to make some friends maybe I can add you someday :)
---
GGEZ Baby killer outplayed
---
Search lockers and be very thorough when searching large areas with lots of room to break line of sight. Smart players will follow you to almost completely avoid detection, Try counter that by randomly turning around and looking
---
dead by daylight: 'wtf are hitboxes' edition.
---
Myers is fucking terrifying to go against if the killer knows what they’re doing
---
Head on should be KONO DIO DA
---
It depends on your level and how good you are at the game. You can do it in 4-6 hours if you play killer.
---
Fuck you Fawkes
---
This guy has the right idea
---
I've noticed only the corn field of Coldwind Farms appearing, I've had the barn one once in the past few days, but many corn fields. I've had both Swamp but I've had them about equal..I'm only really able to remember the coal tower one of MacMilan. 
---
but ok, thanks. just awful luck
---
I thought it was a painted prototype of the upcoming wraith scale. Nice job I want that 💕
---
Dead by Bootleg
---
It sounds like it. I'm going to end up doing something like that when my best friend gets the game next week. It's going to be great.
---
Blinding at a pallet is a dumb move. Any killer that's relatively good can tell by sound where you went and smack you.

Just walk 4head
---
If trapper was just allowed to hold multiple traps at once without add-ons, it would make him so mich more viable.
---
Dead by Cease and Desist
---
I dc when people open the hatch before the last gen is done. Let's aren't fair.
---
I swear to god they do
---
I dont think you know what framerate is.
---
So if the outcome is the same but it's not coordinated what's the difference
---
Have fun! It's amazing how video games can bring people together ☺
---
This sums up why I like it completely. I got so much shit on Overwatch that I quit.
---
Thats is the exact thing happening to me
---
Yup, instead of taking advantage of knowing the killer is busy, ya gotta wait for your pal to be safe! /s
---
Haha, nw. Comic is great with the tree branch XD ol Ashley is a bit screwy
---
If this were a hitbox issue, the hatchet couldn't have even gone through the window.
---
IT WILL GET BETTER. LOOKS LIKE STEALTHY SURVIVORS ARE AN ISSUE FOR YOU. IF YOU HEAR GRUNTS OF PAIN, USUALLY THEY ARE EITHER IN A LOCKER, CROUCHING BEHIND A CLOSEBY OBJECT OR IN A CORNER. LISTEN FOR THOSE GRUNTS, YOU CAN MAKE OUT THE DIRECTION BASED ON THE SOUND.
---
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO FIX THE HEALING GLITCH. SOMETIMES SKILL CHECKS ARE INVISIBLE TOO.
---
I prefer to play stealthy because I suck at looping.  It's working fine so far and with Dark Sense and Poised I can do a gen and sprint away with no scratch marks while also seeing the killer to know when I need to stealth or where he's headed.  People should play as the like.  God Loopers buy time for the stealthies like me to do gens.  It's an ecosystem.
---
I mean you watch fake wrestling, there's no reasoning with you, you're not smart enough.
---
They did, you can send him instead now
---
Pm me and I’ll send you a full body render
---
I've legit received harassment when playing a female character on WoW before.. even when I told them I was a dude irl they kept going. People are desperate online lol.
---
I think you accepted my request? Haha. For some reason I am not having any luck with getting in to games, are you?
---
Say, is identity V any good? Seems like it’s a similar vein of DbD ripoffs, but it has some spark of originality on its own, like making Survivors distinct.
---
you’re not a DBD killer until you’ve had survivors threaten to kill you and your family
---
Do you go to weenie hut jRs for ice cream too ?
---
*oh yeah this gave me a good chuckle*
---
MY FIRST CHANCE TO PLAY ALL WEEK AND NOTHING BUT TUNNEL AND CAMPING ON XBOX. WTF AM I DOING ON THIS STUPID FUCKING GAME??
---
Happened to me only once 2 weeks ago with the spirit on lerrys
---
So you just dc when you could just get all your points because the game is literally about to end
---
Camped I’m guessing
---
the entity just used the power of the wardens last breath I guess? It doesn’t make sense but the bing bong Bois power has got nothing to do with his backstory
---
yes it’s an issue that they have addressed on their twitter (which i recommend following) they are looking into it!
---
It is if the 4head squad hangs out within 16 meters of the hook and there’s a near finished gen nearby.
---
It's a known issue they're working on. Check their Twitter for more updates.
---
If your just playing for the fun of it pig, shape, and ghostface are all good options. Do be aware they don't have the best teachable perks however.
---
Give the Trapper all of his traps at the beginning like the Hag.
---
I KNOW ABOUT THE PAIN GRUNTS, BUT EVEN WITH THAT, I SOMEHOW MANAGE TO CONSTANTLY MISS THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY SOUND RIGHT THE FUCK THERE, AND AT THAT POINT I EITHER DEVOTE EVEN MORE TIME AND KNOW I LOSE THE GAME OR  I LEAVE AND TRY TO PRESSURE GENS BEFORE THEY POP.
---
Where's the download?
---
Thanks I appreciate it I dont have Twitter so I was all confused
---
So for anyone curious this is from a samination video. He makes dbd animations and they're hilarious. This is the exact video here check him out!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz296Izw-S8&amp;t=111s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz296Izw-S8&amp;t=111s)
---
Dont understand the reference and probably never will
---
Stopped playing a few weeks ago when a rash of killers over a 5 day span just hardcore face camped. Wait 15-20 minutes to get into a game that lasts 1 hook. No thanks. Devs are clear this is acceptable game play. Why would anyone want to keep playing a game like that.  And I have 1500 hours red rank survivor and killer. The game has gone to shit.
---
dbd have a problem, doing gens is fucking boring, that's why no one does them, because the fun is all being chased and juking.
---
Bringing a whole new meaning to "knuckle sandwich"
---
They're going to paint those right? Or is this one of those kits you're supposed to paint yourself?
---
Could also get Nica from Curse and Cult, since Chucky possesses her at the end of Cult
---
Nice.
---
Because the killer is camping you and nobody can make a save that way.
---
the clown: am i a joke to you?
---
😂
---
Depends on how much you play. You should be able to get it pretty quickly if you play a lot.
---
I used to be addicted like crazy but I don't really play much anymore. I have around 2000 hours xd. I relate to this meme so damn much
---
I would love Nica as a survivor so we can still have Tilly! (The entity would have to give her the ability to walk though)
---
Ah yes, the hell
---
This doesn't happen as much on console due to the lack of in game chat but still happens which is upsetting
---
Right
---
It also has a sound when triggered.
---
AFAIR, it made survivors upset. Hatchets flied through geometry.
---
I rather ot have little to zero merchandise than having funkos
---
I’m not good at looping so I prefer not to get caught. I run a stealth build with urban evasion so crouching is fast for me.
---
Hot take on a trapper buff: 3% slower gen repair speed for every trap that isn’t open.
---
This happened to me but the killer was right at the gate watching me he wouldn't let me leave he would just hit me
---
So glad to see other people work it like this. Why pay 10 or more for a cosmetic item when you can get hours of fun out of it with full games of equal value. Back in the day when skins were unlocked through various difficult challenges and milestones, and a little after that when it was unlocked through peanuts, maybe 2,50 for a "legendary" skin. I feel now what the elders feel when they say "back in my day, this cost X!" Maybe it was inflation, old man, but now I see that it might just be greed.
---
What app is that
---
It’s $15 because of how much auric cells you can purchase. This is also a licensed cosmetic so I’ll let it slide since $$$ to the license holders.
---
Still waiting on Halloween cosmetics though
---
They're just as bad at losing as they are at winning.. All you can do is not take it personally and see it as a win since you played good enough to make them mad.. Shrug it off and continue with your games.. All that matters is that you're having fun.. And if you don't just close the game.. Those people basically stop existing for you by the click of one button
---
Maybe because legion is C-Tier?
---
I mean Ash has a robot hand, maybe Nica could get a cool set of robot legs
---
Well cannibal has the infamous bbq and chilly, but if you’re looking to dominate then spirit she’s probably the best killer besides nurse
---
Whatever, dummy. Come back here when you know what FRAMES PER SECOND means.
---
And I oop
---
Nah, its fine
---
Maybe
---
Aren't they the definition of crutch perks? They literally let you fuck up and not pay the price, sounds crutchy to me i don't know. They have counterplay, but so does NOED, I wouldn't say any of them are really unfair though.
---
This is hilarious 😂.
---
I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did honestly, thanks for all the upvotes, and silver! The original comic creator is u/shitty_watercolour so be sure to check out his other work friends!
---
You wouldn’t believe how many killers just walk by me if I’m blending in with something or in tall grass
---
Then again I’m rank 18 and idk what it’s like in higher ranks
---
Its Playstation’s chat
---
I know the feeling, but sometimes I prioritize my traps first which is a terrible idea sometimes.
---
Super awesome art!
---
I’d say the watermark isn’t too effective at crediting you as the artist, since anyone can jut slap on those emojis. I’d say add your signature or your Twitter @ in there somewhere just to make sure it won’t get yoinked :)
---
Same with huntress.
---
She walked at the end of the movie for some reason, because her soul being switched healed her spine????
---
Lol. That's how I know I've won here.
---
I recommend shape because he has a lot of different playstyles (when you use different add-ons) and he is easy to learn.
---
Eww dead by daylight on console
---
It's fine, huntress has her hatchets.  
---
Or are the Entity rules that HE must become the killer, while Billy is now the new survivor?
---
It's not a rip off when BHVR themselves have allegedly worked on it. 
---
Also, is war for the over world a rip off of dungeon keeper? I don't think so, it's a spiritual successor. The subject of OP's post is a rip off, don't use the term so loosely or it'll lose its power.
---
Nope no Pop funkos. Make a deal with NECA, they already make quality action figures of Michael, Leatherface, Freddy, and Jason. I would kill for a fully poseable Trapper figure with accessories.
---
Just get Franklin's Demise, problem solved. Keys aren't any less fair than killers who can instantly down survivors.
---
I had this happen one time. A  survivor was pissing me off, teabagging, flashlight clicking, hiding around pallets to slam in my face regardless if I saw him or not, ect. He was in my next lobby so I sinned and face camped that mofo and got the sweetest revenge I've had in awhile.
---
I only crouch when trying to hide behind something short that i would appear over when standing.
---
Jane cuz she’s thicc

God tier response. I wonder what his reaction was and how he was acting when he sent the first message. Seemed like he might have actually been screaming and crying in real life.

NO MORE FUNKO POPS, PLEASE
---
Tell me about lol
---
I would say bubba.
---
As a Pig main, Pig is super fun and has a pretty devoted community on here, r/oinkers_
---
Lmao
---
i did not know reddit was so against pop funkos *hides entire overwatch collection nervously*
---
Yeah mostly new nightmare would be the best based on films too because he has the largest difference from remake. With new hand, jumper and face
---
Nea is Tank, Claudette is Rochelle (duh,) Ace is Nick, Dwight is Ellis, Coach is either Tapp or Adam. I'd prefer Adam.
---
No offense (downvote if you please) but dbd needed to stay a pc only game
---
10/10 would rip his spine out
---
Yeah, Saw 1 when Zepp gets *oinked*
---
Depends how you play and what you struggle with
---
Adepts on PS4 or much easier than on PC if I'm not wrong. Not to downgrade this achievement though, I play on PS4 also. Keep up the good work!
---
that last panel is a whole mood
---
The only gatekeeping that is true
---
Spirit is very fun and rewarding, second best killer in the game in my opinion. 
---
Leatherface is pretty boring and pretty weak, but he has Barbecue and Chilli and Franklin's Demise, which are very good perks. 
---
Pig is also fun and she also has strong perks like Surveillance and Make Your Choice.
---
As one does
---
There are still a fair amount of differences between OG and remake Freddy, and I know plenty of people (including myself) would love the actual original Freddy as well as New Nightmare.
---
Hope your games went well and that he didn't used Nea to play Urban Evasion lmaoo
---
Yep, thank god for DS. Love that perk.
---
I play Leatherface a good bit, and yeah I like to camp the basement. Camping the basement doesn't mean you have to be standing in front of the hook the entire time. I can see you have a lot of anger toward this so you want to assume the worst, but really survivors will complain about *any* sort of camping. The most effective way to camp the basement is to patrol the 3 gens closest to it, and just came back when you know someone's going for the save. You just say the killer could be doing something better. But if you're entire strategy is to stay near the basement like that, you're shooting yourself in the foot by letting someone escape from the basement. 
---
That's the *least* optimal thing you could do. In this case, the only reason you would let them go is to avoid "ruining their game". But the truth is the only people complaining about dying on the hook in a game are just sore losers in general. Anything you do to prevent them from winning will ruin their game. If you didn't get enough points as a survivor, it's because you failed at surviving. Same thing goes for the killer when they don't make enough points. It's up to *you*, the player, to do better than your opponent if you want to survive so badly.
---
Behavior is just trying to make sure you make like  a tree and leaf
---
Claudette: The only time you see her all match is when she is unhooking you in front of the killer (without borrowed time)
---
So make the original Freddy a green rarity outfit- a fair amount of differences, but nothing overly substantial.
---
For some yes but I’d argue certain killers like nurse are harder on PS4 because her power is hard to use on a controller
---
I said this one before. Tiffany would be carrying Chucky around and she'd be an m1 killer. The power is you become Chucky and he works like Legion without the mend. They can rework Legion to use all 4 members. So like a mix of Spirit and legion.
---
That's what I figured, it's not too obvious but I can see it. I love it, goddamn.
---
Do you want killers to hate flashlights even more...?
---
Monitor and Abuse with Scratched Mirror Michael would’ve been perfect for him! :)
---
I've definitely seen more pop than ruin since the reset. Wasn't it just on the shrine?
---
N O   C L I P   O U T   O F   R E A L I T Y
---
Point a flashlight in your eyes...can you still hear?
---
Lmfao yea cause thats what happens when a bright light shines in your face
---
"Dude, stop flashing that light at me!! I cant hear anything!!"
---
Fucking 4head 😂
---
Hard pass.
---
I'm gonna keep struggling for as long as possible.
---
Survivor 1 seems great
---
Definately the red insta heal. Premonition is just a worse spine chill. And that would be second.
---
To be fair, he had surgery and his voice became higher pitched
---
- Small Hope  
---
Does this mean after 10/15/20 seconds survivors have no way of opening gates? If thats the case then its broken 100%, thats basically saying if killer can defend the gate for merely 10 seconds at rank 3 he auto wins. 
---
If you want that kind of hope either make it a window where you cant open gates for example
---
Small Hope: For the first 20/25/30 seconds after powering the exit gates, survivors cannot open gates
---
Or alternatively make it a sort of hex perk where survivors have to cleanse in order to unlock gates at normal speed (idk hex ruin for exit gates)
---
You didn't even bring Iri Heads and they want to complain lol.  Ignore them.
---
Because they (unlike you) don't want to be on a hook first.
---
Probably not. Wish they could though.
---
That was my initial choice, and I don't run Premonition but I thought the upgrade might help. 
---
And Resilence seemed pretty useless.
---
this is the wholesomest post on dbd's subreddit
---
I swear I run into far too many pigs like this. Like just play wraith at this point!
---
Another quinten
---
Ghost Face
---
What is the pic on the tight
---
I had a bonding moment with pig today
---
I can’t stand playing with stealth players
---
You mean:
---
Laurie: Kill Me and *Spooky Noises*
---
Jeff: Aura’s Are For Pussies
---
Jane: **THICC**
---
Adam: Pebble and YEET
---
I would lick his armpits
---
It only goes 5 mins on xbox.
---
“Sounds funny but it’s true,”
---
I would love that change to rearm at traps so much. If not that then a few other ideas could be:
---
1. Let him carry two traps by default.
---
2. Let him rearm traps without having to pick them up. It's just so awkward having to place one down to rearm another if you're carrying your limit.
---
3. Might be too strong but actually have his traps spawn near vaults or loops already armed.
---
Ey if I ever see a comp like this I'm 100% gunna grab my nurse to m3rk everyone except BM and release the baby dwight.
---
Honestly the only viable way to play is with Ruin to stall in the beginning, and immediately run to a 3-gen and trap the fuck out of it. Ignore all other gens for the entire game.
---
At least, that’s the only thing that works for me.
---
What a sad reality that is. 
---
I used to play siege a ton and it’s literally the worst on that game. Any girl is there and it turns into the most sexist, racist, whatever vulgar term you wanna use. Have no clue why the opposite gender brings that out in video games.
---
I cant hear you it's to dark
---
No they didn't
---
yeah the shortcomings of the huntress are sad but i don't care im still chuckin hatchets
---
SO I BUY THE NEW TAPP COSMETICS AND JUST WANT TO HAVE A COUPLE FUN MATCHES TO SHOW OFF MY NEW THREADS.
---
WHAT DO I GET? INSIDIOUS FACECAMPER AFTER INSIDIOUS FACECAMPER AFTER INSIDIOUS FACECAMPER.
---
PERMA TIER 3 MYERS WHO INSIDIOUS FACECAMPS.
---
HAG WITH MINT RAG, MAKE YOUR CHOICE, AND DEVOUR HOPE WHO STILL FACE CAMPS
---
FRANKLIN'S DEMISE LEATHERFACE WITH AN EBONY MORI WHO FACE CAMPS AND THEN HARD TUNNELS AND MORIS ME AFTER I GET UNHOOKED WITH BORROWED TIME
---
MAN WHY DOES EVERYONE RUN FUCKING BORROWED TIME AND DECISIVE STRIKE? IT'S A GODDAMN FUCKING MYSTERY. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE CAMPING LITERALLY GUARENTEES A KILL AND REASONING THAT "THE OTHER THREE WILL ESCAPE SO IT'S FINE" IS A FUCKING BULLSHIT EXCUSE FOR A LUDICRIOUSLY UNFUN MECHANIC
---
Are those real?
---
No. If you're going to run a escape perk like premonition run spine chill. 
---
Resilence only works with perks like no mither.
---
And an insta heal is always worth it
---
What’s wrong with the pepelaugh lol seems like you just went super defensive for no reason lol
---
10/10 would kill again
---
I fee the same. I’m constantly getting Clown and Plague dailies while i main Legion while trying Pig.
---
But Myers has not reached his full potential
---
You say one of the members is rank 10 or lower. I'm assuming the other player(s) are at your rank? If so, that's how it works. It can go either way. I've seen low rank SWF groups playing with high rank survivors and we're all below 10 except for them.
---
I THINK THIS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DC ON FIRST DOWN. WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING THE DEAD BY DAYLIGHT FLAWLESS ANY% SPEED RUN?
---
Ngl always spare Dwight where possible.
---
when the entity give you the us national debt
---
What if you get caught first? Then you go down instantly and are a Liability to your team. Furthermore how is sitting on a gen holding a button for 80 seconds fun?
---
I do play killer and follow their footsteps. I don’t think it’s too much of a big deal. Usually it’s from fools who blind while (distance wise) they’re still touching the pallet. Don’t sit still to blind, get like 15 feet away at least.
---
Artist here.
---
The color palette is fine. It's composed of some desaturated blue and pink with some highlights in saturated green and red, with some yellow details. It is very reminiscent of both old ukiyo-e art and contemporary japanese street and pop art overall. You can say it's kinda all over the place, but that's the point, probably.
---
Also it will most likely to look a lot better once it is finished as an official design by the BHVR pros and may look more appealing as an in-game model after some fine tuning.
---
They do keep life intreasting to say the least
---
I hard DC. Meaning close the app. They don't get points.
---
I doubt it.
---
I can almost guarantee she didn't DC
---
I SAW THAT BEFORE
---
Why can't they give us the new perks from The plague, Legion, Ghost face. I don't know how many times I've seen bamboozle
---
Thanks for this.
---
Judging from the majority of complaints and insults hurled at the devs from users here you'd think every DBD player is a 10X software engineer/network engineer.
---
Let them vent its healthier anyway unless you want to explode with anger
---
Same. I really like their design and story.
---
thanks man
---
Haha, he would have loved that
---
I’ve seen fungoose use Ruin, Pop, Thrilling Tremors and Corrupt Intervention on trapper to great success. Corrupt gives time to set up. Ruin slows the start more. Thrilling Tremors+Pop combo is terrific. He uses no add ons as well.
---
I'm guessing that was the dead hard user.
---
Yeah these kind of things have a way of backfiring. I knew what I was signing up for, but when it was my birthday a few weeks ago I was feeling cheeky and changed my name to "Bday Boy Needs a Win" or something like that.  
---
My win rate dropped dramatically after that.
---
Yeah we recommended Claud but he wanted Dwight!
---
When its a repost...
---
It’s not about rank mate it’s about skill I can get a 4K easy with spirit on red ranks and I’m currently in green ranks so does that make it fair? No absolutely not that’s why I’m playing other killers and if you think you’re a god because your better against worse players then you probably think fighting a fucking kid is is a fair fight
---
When its a stolen credit repost...
---
Spine chill is better and i wouldnt run more than one killer aware perks
---
Must have been funny x)
---
Can't count on 10 how many times this image has been posted here
---
it was actually a streamer who was impossible to hear because the background music was so loud...
---
Toxic killer move I’m glad you got out
---
I wish we could get Choptop but he wouldn't fit
---
Wut the fuck.....
---
Ah. So all teenagers who wear hoodies and are enrolled in high school resemble columbine. 
---
I would delete this post as fast as possible.
---
KILL DWIGHT
---
Would definitely be too strong seeing as depending on addons you could have between 15-24% generator penalty if you just didn't place any traps (that's almost the same as Dying Light!), but sounds like an interesting Purple/Pink add-on.
---
see my last post ;)
---
ooh i hope you die in the heck &gt;:(
---
shatered glasses... best map in the historty
---
The Game is good for Nurse.
---
I think the confusion came from the fact that they can be purchased for shards on the mobile version.
---
What is that video, is that a thing I missed lmao
---
They tweeted about the issue and they are looking into. Hopefully its resolved by tonight
---
Matchmaking
---
It's my Michael Myers cosplay from April. The image on the left is from a year before.
---
Well, it could've been worse. You could've played Billy or Huntress on that map ...
---
Buddy, the post is talking about how almost every killer is countered by their own maps. Like Huntress is terrible on her own map. Doctor is terrible on his map, but technically so is everyone not named Spirit or Nurse.
---
The post is not complaining about how maps are survivor favored. Again, it is pointing out that it is weird how maps counter their respective killer.
---
Better then a mori. Muhahahahahahahahaaaa
---
That swing at the end lmfao
---
I FOUND THAT RESTARTING MY PLAYSTATION HELPED!
---
Well, I don't know what perks do you have, so I can't say.
---
There's a lot of people downvoting you for being correct.
---
At least he gave that +9000 bonus.

naaa, billy at least is 115% and huntress can still throw hatchets a windows
---
How would that even work. Are you going to flash their ears? 
---
This is possibly the stupidest thing I've read on these forums. Screenshotting so when get stomped in a game I can looked at this post and be reminded that most survivors that play this game are beyond stupid.
---
I did, what happened?
---
Or or hear me out. Dont flashlight at pallets lmao
---
Alright then but why the fuck did you bring a flashlight and healed in front of a baby legion mate ? Thats literals making fun of that baby legion and saying “I’m better than you”
---
Git good
---
They don't get points for altruism or objective if they only hide the entire game.
---
Hiding....
---
Dont worry it’s not that good anyway
---
Bc it either a random who joined a swf an they are dying or u had a hex ruin and we’re actually good with the killer so they didn’t finish any gens and now 2 of there friends are dead so they try to find the hatch to get the points
---
Us women/girls play all sorts of games. But this game doesn't result in us getting harassed nearly as much.
---
*and a 5 blink nurse just in case*
---
Laurie
---
Camping is a legitimate strategy if
---
* The exit gates are open
---
* You know the other survivors are around from their behavior earlier in the game so they're not getting anything done
---
* You have multiple survivors in the basement (at that point it's kind of their fault for allowing such a situation to happen anyway) 
---
Otherwise when I play survivor I don't even complain about it because I know all the generators will be done and the killer will leave with a 1k or lucky 2k at best.
---
One map has to be the biggest I guess
---
N-nothing
---
Its just that I wanted to sleep in Dwights house for a bit
---
Why in the actual fuck are the cosmetics for Tapp and The Pig double the price of the chapter
---
How do u get so many shards? Those outfits cost like 20k or something
---
Kate brought tenacity
---
Papa D or baby D?
