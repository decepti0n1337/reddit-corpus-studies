That wouldnt change anything besides making them pander to low ranks and no one wants that.
---
---
---
Pretty sure it’s a killer-side buff
---
Yea
---

---
You can find better and less annoying sound effects
---
But you allready getting salty when someone calls out your shitty video
---
Or they could do the obvious change and do protection hits and safe unhooks
---
Oinker finds gun, kills Entity and enforces her own rules
---
Sandbag yourself until you’re ready, or play survivor. I’ve got probably 1000+ hours on console, and just bought the game on PC; haven’t played even one match yet. My plan is grind survivor then dump points into killer.
---
No nerfing. Just leave her alone.
---
exactly 10 years before the game even came out XD
---
It’s a killer buff, not a survivor buff
---
1.Put rule set #2 in her base kit 
---
2.Even If they were put after the last gen was done make RBTs activate at the exit gate
---
*I've been playing this game for a month now*
---
Yeah she DC'd after, then everyone else did
---
Yes I main Spirit and Hag because they are the easiest killers to get BBQ stacks for me personally.
---
I play on Xbox and recently DbD was put on game pass so we had a flooding of noobs but despite our community being a toxic one people still help each other to learn eventually people will get better.
---
I just wanna know who voiced Feng because she did an amazing job
---
OK but anyway, do you think  when killer uses mechanics against survivors that it is an exploit?
---
It means I’m asking for the original comic
---
Confused TOTH for Small game, my bad b
---
Yeah i play xbox too it was horrid i had to strictly play pc after 2 days.
---
Was this post necessary? No. Is it stupid? Yes.
---
Im not defending the video, im defending myself... and yea, tell me where you see any ear rape or toxic behavior... 
---
btw having haters means ur growing up, so im not mad;)
---
You should have posted a screenshot of your post game loadout so we could see what you ran to accompany the brag post
---
It could be fake right? Or did she somehow voice chat you?
---
:(
---
Deserved it
---
I was thinking Pennywise would be good or Art the Clown from Terrifier

I’m not sure if it was his mom but she was talking in post game
---
I actually did good my first time as The Huntress on PS4. Granted, I was facing low-ranks (I was low-ranked as well)
---
Should have had Leatherface as the icon for the 2nd perk LOOL
---
So you've heard the voice right?
---
supposed to show that it's a swf but ok
---
Nah I didn’t I don’t believe it was actually his mom but if it was then I get to laugh even more
---
Why does everyone hate The Game? I get that it's slightly killer-sided, but it's my favorite map as both killer and survivor as it usually produces a fun round.
---
Then again, I also hate Coldwind maps as a survivor, so maybe I'm just weird...
---
This comment can't be real.
---
If Michael choking survivors out spawns “harder daddy” memes, would The Nurse choking survivors create “harder mommy” memes?
---
I had a stroke trying to understand you please elaborate
---
But it grows our community ppl will learn how to play eventually u just have to give them the chance to get good also not playing the game bc newer ppl started joining seems a bit extreme.
---
Didn’t here it but I don’t really believe it was his mom but I can laugh if it was
---
or they just use reddit mobile
---
Or i can tell you what i had with me:

Not all of them. Just juggling them specifically. As far as I know the rest is legitimate.

Yeah but if he expected to scare me I can laugh even more
---
r/I r/Think r/I r/hadastroke r/reading r/this r/, r/wtf
---
No. I dont want little kids already ruining a toxic community and thats the kind of people he brings. Im for more adults sure, but pewdiepie would just bring loud and idiotic children. It would be the same if ninja did it and once again no one wants that.
---
Yeah expected you to have ran NOED.  The screenshot also would have shown bloodpoints for all which shows if you say camped to death on first hook etc...regardless all I'm saying is if you're going to brag about a 4K on here and survivor salt include the post game so we can see if this is entitled survivors whining, or a babykiller that played scummy.  We don't know without the pic.
---
Could be a desync problem
---
I don't know what to do with LF,really.
---
The pig's "special item" is really lackluster.it's a cool and fun idea....but poor in execution.it's far to easily negated.
---
Obviously,jigsaw boxes should not have a visible aura for starters.that's just asinine.
---
I think she should be able to refill RBT's from jigsaw boxes the way huntress refills hatchets.maybe 1 rbt per box,but it doesnt "use up" the box as far as survivors are concerned.
---
Possibly make the rbt cause a debuff like bleed/mangled/slower interaction speed.....something.I would think having a big spikey metal contraption on your head would hinder you in some way.
---
All i know is the rbt's seem pretty lackluster as it stands.sure they can cause a mild annoyance and a small waste of time searching jigsaw boxes......but,as an ability, it's definitely not on par with something like nurse's teleport or huntresses hatchet.
---
I would love to see the types of killers!
---
That would be so cool dude hell yeah
---
Yeah it really is loud. I have to turn done now when vsing a doctor. Which means the other sounds get lost.
---
Quickly browsiing your shitty videos really makes me feel better about my comment
---
You keep reusing the same sound effects and the same annoying effects, you sure are gonna grow this way
---
And yea I dont care about your feelings, if I see something shitty I call it out, noe stop defending your videos and make something decent, im not even asking something good. Do something DECENT
---
No but she can just go right around them and hear exactly where they are while they can only guess where she is. That's why she's both easy and busted, not just busted. Knew that way before I was P3, all perks, with hundreds of hours on her...because prestige means something...? Dick size contest woohoo...
---
This is why my 2nd edit exists, y'all just want to be condescending contrarians like I do. If you don't think Spirit's braindead, fine. But she is and I'm sticking with that opinion because of how much I've played her and what I've seen others do with her.
---
Honestly baseline Spirit with no add-ons (or common add-ons only, even yellow activation time + movement speed is borderline ridiculous) is much less bullshit and takes much more skill to use efficiently. Still a coinflip, but it's the difference between the theoretical weighted coin and a regular coin.
---
Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go sleep.
---
I've literally never seen that before, I have been enlightened
---
Not only does he rarely do this when he does it's just an exaggerated personality for the video. If you check out his streams you can see that he is way more chill. On top of that usually when he complains about lag or hitboxes it's justified. You can't honestly believe lag and bad hitboxes are not serious problems in the game right now.
---
I said wrong post because I know that shitpost. That comment seems more fitting on the post itself, not a killer suggestion post.
---
The answer is yes
---
Yeah revving slows him but swinging it speeds him up. Add ons that boost "acceleration" increase the movement speed while he swings the chain saw
---
:)
---
You already know my problem with Freddy but with pig i normally have to be more aware of my surroundings and hope RNG doesnt screw me over when it comes to the boxes
---
Template from r/memeeconomy
---
&gt;Or they could do the obvious change and do protection hits and safe unhooks
---
I watched a lot of survivor main streamers and also played during the PTB where they tested this iteration and getting MoM up was still far too easy. Not to mention they made it where you were protected at all times (even healthy) against any attacks (M2s)
---
You need to censor the names

damn I never knew Bill was hol horse

Is it best to blink a bunch for travel or just float?

100% slower? You mean the speed is lowered by 100%?
---
That means it's not moving at all, which would indeed be hilarious.
---
It is hard to say he had no perks or add-ons since you didn't wait until match was over to take a screenshot of scoreboard. 
---
By your description he probably had Judith's Tombstone or Tombstone Piece.
---
I just spent 950k on a new surv last night and got to lvl 37 if that helps you out.
---
I only bought the cheapest stuff the web would allow and I picked up the perk as soon as I could to trigger the entity faster so I didnt have to buy as much stuff.
---
Survivors have one objective. Generators. How is doing gens quickly toxic? I'm also a killer main.
---
Staring contest actually seems pretty balanced tbh wp
---
Hahaha me too
---
Yes
---
You mess with the piggy, you **get a 9mm in your skull**
---
That sounds fun actually using like a jigsaw sketch and a rule set number 2 on a map like the game or lery’s and to try your hardest to get a head pop.
---
...Wow, you are not very liked around here.
---
Happens to me pretty much every time
---
He probably was just at level 3 evil within
---
Uh, I’m sorry but, 
---
*WHERE IS JASON?*
---
The hag in that lil dress!!!! So cute!!!
---
&gt;Cannibal
---
&gt;Win in seconds
---
Probably worst killer after old freddy lmao
---
I accidentally got 2 game overs before 3rd gen once. I was very confused that time.
---
Anyway, it always gives me joy when someone actually gets killed by a trap, or when someone actually gets trapped, and just comes to you and waits, what you gonna do. Even absolute trainwreck of the game becomes satisfying.
---
This made me lol too hard. Thank you.
---
Jesus has the tutorial always been this bright?
---
If teabagging hurt they feelings that much I gotta do it,  they'll camp anyway.
---
and we have on objective too, to kill survivors they call us toxic because of our strategies that kill them fast so it naturally makes sense that them doing gens quickly is toxic as well
---
I once went against a plague with Noed. I wasn't really surprised since I expect all killers to run Noed but I was so confused like why would you run Noed on plague like there is so many good perks for her.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49385/fog-whisperers-program-launch
---
They're supposed to represent the game's community, sort of. Lots of them are as bitchy as the typical toxic player you usually find though.
---
Huntress can also be heard when she fully chargers her hatchets
---
Yeah. I can imagine coming into the game with all the dlc and characters at this point could feel overwhelming. Levelling each one with time has been fun. But I look at the amount of characters now and think. If I had to levek those up again..... Fuck that piss.
---
So you want me to press share then save screenshot plug a flash drive into my ps4 close app go to storage go to screenshots and copy to my flash plug the flash into my non existent computer copy over and upload to the sub reddit

Hook someone. run away before being accused of camping
---
\*hear loud jumping off of top of stairs noises\*
---
\*follow them to the hook and stab them\*
---
HEY NO CAMPING HOW ELSE WOULD YOU KNOW I WAS THERE
---
i was looking at my comments and found this and damn entitled survivors are saying freddy is op now lol the prophesy has been completed
---
Are you insane in the membrane LMAO he could have easily stood right next to her but he choose to be a good fair Killer and get her some personal space while she slowly dies on the hook.
---
Yep basically. I'm on the side of the game being great and love them giving us content often but I can understand why people would hate the game alot of things are buggy currently .
---
I really don’t understand why people think pig is bad. I think she’s mid tier because she slows the game down extremely well and her stealth ability helps her get close to survivors.              But yeah Leatherface is garbage
---
What have you done
---
Some people believe it's a crutch.  As a sneaky player it lets you know the killer is coming.  As a dead hard, adrenaline, decisive strike type of player it use to give you a faster vault speed.  I don't think it does that anymore.
---
According to this thread you might as well have committed a war crime lmao
---
Darn you got me, i'll just git gud and hop over all the long wall + window setups that spawn (plus the invincibility Strode house in the middle of the map)!
---
I like it because it jumpscares me
---
Holy shit that actually sounds so cool. I'd love to be able to play survivor without letting down three teammates
---
Low ranks are extremely boring to me personally. Almost every killer/survivor is a potato and it’s just boring to play against/with.
---
For real though. Always double tap to make sure they're dead
---
And legion
---
Or you get the super industrious team that will work away at gens when you get hooked until sacrificed.
---
I think I've received the most hate mail ever by playing this game. And I've played Smite and Overwatch! This was maybe day 2 or 3 of me playing &amp; this is their response! Talk about a horrible community 😹
---
Oof as a killer main, the accuracy hurts. I rarely let clauds/pink hair/blue hairs go because they DC before I get them to a hook.
---
Not possible on PlayStation as far as my knowledge goes but I’m pretty sure Xbox supports this
---
i see no god up here

---
It would’ve been a good buff to it
---
That’s because he thought she was gonna die on hook after attempting to hit the 4%
---
This was the best possible addition, take my upvote
---
It can be be surprisingly good on Nurse, and Spirit and Wraith can run the Full Hex Build very efficiently and benefit a lot from it.
---
Lmao you'd think so 😹 Meanwhile killers face camp daily but Oh no let's complain at the newbie dancing to the exit
---
The rework pretty much made them more fun, not better. Also they were never good
---
PSN doesn't do screenshot viewing?
---
Waow
---
^(PC Master Race)
---
I've never faced a lag switcher, but I have faced people who start downloading stuff mid game and message me "Oops! Accidentally started downloading ___, sorry!"
---
Yeah, ps4 screenshots are a hassle and upload at such low qualities that the cell phone pic is honestly probably clearer.  I’ll take a well-cropped/centered cell phone shot over a psn upload any day.

That guy
---
Agreed
---
Most likely not lag switching, just downloading games to make everyone lag. It's really uncommon, but still happens. THAT should be bannable imo.
---
I don’t I camp the guy who teabags and then keep playing as usual, I won’t care about him, is not emotional, if u teabag u better be a godlike survivor, as both side player at decent lvl (purple) I know camping is not efficient, also teabagging is a waste of time u could use to get distance. Who is letting his emotion take control, the guy who loose but doesn’t mind, or the guy who loose and wait till the end of the match to trash talk.
---
Makes sense. Wondering whether to try him, since I'm a low ranker, and basically a baby killer right now. But generally the survivors I've faced have been anything but, so it's difficult to know if it'll make things worse for me or not.
---
This by far is the best meme next to the Freddy / Simpsons meme that came out after Christmas, where  Homer falls down the canyon wall! Episode Bart the Daredevil!
---
Stfu dumbledore wannabe. Let me recite the wise words of the dbd god himself, Git gud TwitchyNo2.
---
"I don't" "I camp the guy who teabags" LOL git gud trash puppy xD
---
No. This doesn't take into account the poor guy getting camped, which is the main issue was and always have been.
---
How is it fair that all 3 gets to escape while one guy gets to do nothing all game?
---
It's more so that they think they're better then you by Teabagging at the exit gates thats what makes it so irritating I personally aren't annoyed by it but if you're really bad and teabag then you kinda deserve what comes towards your way also flashlight spamming is kinda apart of the teabagging from my experience it shows a cocky survivor that's probably bad.
---
Oops, supposed to have been decreases.
---
*shrugs*
---
I main Huntress, so a tbagging survivor is just an easier target
---
Low quality bait dude. Low quality.
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY

1.yes

2.Just laugh at their stupidity. I love when I get those messages because it’s so funny what people believe
---
Are you implying that pewdiepie fans are nazis
---
What if this wasn't bait, but I was serious?
---
Nah, the DbD community couldn't possibly fathom that possibility.
---
Now you're making sense!
---
Adept plague is ass to get. Using your power pretty much makes it impossible and her perks suck.
---
nope
---
Rock bottom, there she goes!
---
Yesterday, I got stuck in a trap because I rushing to unhook my teammate who instantly started struggling as soon as they got hooked the first time. New rule: don’t save people who struggle al the way on their first hook
---
My other question is in what situation would third law be useful?
---
Ah, thanks, got any suggestions?
---
Tunneling is also not toxic as killer

Hex: Disconnected 
---
Every time you down a survivor and go to pick them up, you create all loss of hope onto your victims in the entity’s realm and cause your survivors to have a Disconnect because the are pussys. Once completed they no longer can play the game for the next 3 days!
---
My first thought was that it looks like Morf lol

Wait ur Serious? Okay lemme laugh harder

omg he can get his season 3 outfit

One no mither is enough honestly
---
Can confirm I've probably played a few dozen matches of killer on DBD mobile and I've yet to not get a 4k (counting when I give the last survivor hatch as a 4k)
---
Scratch marks are stupidly easy to see, the aim assist points my camera in the direction of survivors when I didn't even originally know they were there, and survivors can't hide anywhere because the sounds they make give you directional notifications on top of the audio cues
---
I've been playing as spirit now and most games I 4k with 4-5 gens still up, it's so easy it's silly. That said, because of that I almost always give the last survivor the hatch
---
Sounds frickin cool but brutal, straight blade or slanted blade?
---
I feel like this post just shows how many killer mains are in this subreddit lol
---
I think the last part you said should’ve stuck with the removal of the safe unhooks. To take both parts away made it completely trash. I think someone going out of their way for 3 buggy ass protection hits at least earned the right to have instadown protection. Other than a complete rework, I think that’s the logical change it needs right now. The aura part also seems unnecessary now.
---
Because he is hot
---
I used to use Nurse’s with her. It was fun because it seemed like the NC radius was larger than her terror radius. I hit a lot of unsuspecting healers that way.
---
This is so accurate, it kind of scares

---
Yep, rank totally matters in this.
---
But that’s Ace and David
---
Thanks 4 hatch
---
Yeah I’m totally down for these. I mean make sure the pumped up kicks isn’t activated if we crouch at other survivors, that’s how we say thanks to our fellow runners. But other than that these would be excellent.
---
Sometimes it’s very complicated on consoles cause you have to get it on a thumb drive and stuff.... :(
---
Oh I agree with it not including  safe unhooks. Too easy. But adding back in it working against instadowns and no aura would be a bit of a compromise and at least makes it somewhat usable until they ever want to rework it. I think it would still suck because of it being buggy, but there would at least be an extra benefit against one shots.
---
I've literally never heard this before. Where is a guide for that?
---
I love when this happens when I play survivor, jokes on them we'll be in a new match in 10 seconds enjoy your killer queue time
---
Yeah, that's pretty much r/deadbydaylight in a nutshell.
---
Nah, looks to me like we got a couple of SOYYYYYYYY BOYYYYYYYYS
---
To be honest, I figured consoles would have networks to upload screenshots that you could easily open up via phone app, kind of like Steam.
---
Honestly yeah. I can guarantee every single person acting like I'm some sort of mobster has face camped 😪 Had one of my stream snipers jump in in this too, denying he's ever stream sniped me which is total bs.

I just can’t help it. I always end up laughing when someone steps into one. This meme is so damn accurate.

Wrong idea, killers get more blood points than survivors, you definitely wanna play an easy killer like the cannibal and get bbq and chili. Then you’ll get tons of bloodpoints
---
Because I noticed that you can buy him with shards right as I bought him with cells. So yea it was basically a waste of money :(

The matchmaking system doesn't matter if rank doesn't matter. It only takes 42 and a half games if you double pip every game to get rank 1 and about 85 games if you don't double pip every game. 1 game takes 10 minutes average so it would be about 6 matches an hour. How many really good survivors have you gotten in rank 10 and rank 1?
---
Not really any way to avoid it besides just making your profile private but I think there is a option to disable people from commenting on your profile also.
---
well i mean, I know first hand. The main reason I found those comments was because I played for 2-3 hours today and on my last match I apparently had some sort of server error with my saves and lost my progress.
---
Lol I did the same to a trapper. I was just running and it spawned as I got downed through a vault. Killer was cool about it tho, were actually swf now
---
The one thing I’ll never understand is: What’s the point of putting a trap on someone and tunnel them? They’re useless anyway. They can’t do gens if the timer is active. So what’s the point of chasing after someone who literally can’t contribute to the objective while you have three other survivors doing the objective?
---
Some Pigs don’t know how to play Pig. SMH.
---
I love how some people think they have the "Moral high ground" while also being probably as much of a dick as possible in the comment.
---
If it's a circle jerk you want, r/deadbydaylight has got you covered.
---
Absolutely nobody is saying that killers are forced to use "useless" perks only, just don't rely on a spirit/Enduring, BBQ, and ruin build on an instasaw billy every single game. Change it up some, you'll learn how to play better without using the most powerful perks every game.
---
Exact same thing goes for the survivor side, don't rely on adrenaline + a SWF group to rush the gens to get out out every game after you run the killer around every pallet on the map for 3 minutes.
---
No. Just impossible. Both sides can be complete assholes who use shitty excuses to justify their toxicity. Trying to avoid toxicity in this game is like applying 50SPF sunscreen before going for a swim in lava.
---
Just try to keep your head down and live with it.
---
I couldn't figure out how to do the second blink. Got confused and thought she only had one by default.. so i brought an addon to give me more next match. I was so confused
---
The ones that sit on gens the whole game, never being chased and farms?
---
what did you do for the build if you don’t mind me asking. sounds fun &amp; would like to try it!
---
Tell me why survivors gets so salty because i target the ppl who flicks their flashlights at me? Clearly they want my attention and I give it to them, so why bitch about it?

Well, right killers get more bloodpoints... for now. Next week survivors get a bump. And, otherwise, yeah just tank as killer. Don’t have to win to get a bunch of points.

You really don’t want to miss out on those bloodpoints though.

*talks about how he doesn’t get emotional over a game, flames random people about a game on reddit*

So many years and they still haven't fixed killers being able to pick up survivors, how tf are survivors supposed to get away if the killer can just pick them up?
---
Made with mematic
---
Actually, you do.
---
Why should I tell you that? Go ask them. I'm making a statement for killer mains not to get emotional over a video game. Clearly you missed that memo.
---
No its not, its a counter
---
Indeed.hopefully hag won't be as bad as bubba for me.
---
Fuck wrong sub r/okbuddyretard
---
It doesn't matter. You can be literal shit in red ranks because you have a 4 man who boosted you.
---
While I do agree that we should be matched with people closer to our ranks, I don't really agree with it when dealing with SWF. Sometimes SWFs bring their friends in when they just bought the game and are trying it out. I've been there, and I was rank 4, with a rank 2 friend of mine, and 2 rank 20 friends of ours. Our killer was a rank 8 Spirit, and we got destroyed. Sadly I think the only way to fix this is to limit the rank differences between survivors in a lobby. So if you're red rank, you can only play red - purple ranks. If you're purple you can only play purple to green and so on. But then that would raise another issue which is wait times. So as much as I too want some change to the ranking system, it's a little difficult.
---
Sorry, I should've known that logic was inapplicable on this subreddit.
---
Please no also don't advertise that awful subreddit here either please
---
I've yet to find anyone using legacy cosmetic that was good. They are either hacked legacy, they haven't played the game since beta, or they get overconfident and get steamrolled.
---
I mean, Trapper is not that hard to use. He's just bad. You can try and write an essay about trap placement and zoning, but at the end of the day you can't trap every loop and you can just get unlucky with survivors dodging traps by chance. It's not that deep.
---
Why is t-bagging such a problem. Nobody complains when ghostface does it... OH WAIT A MINUTE!!!! I forgot he’s a killer so it’s ok according to most of the community
---
Well you are clearly a know it all and a professional survivor main so tell me.
---
I'd definitely love wearing a Billy or Trapper mask on Halloween!
---
Perma Rank 20, even after the update that made it impossible to drop below 16
---
You can't get "boosted" if you're literal shit and can't get earn enough emblems to pip up. You can escape if all you did was hide all game but you wont rank up from that.
---
So, it does matter.
---
whats a -rep? Just a comment they leave?
---
Missing an attack or chainsaw sprinting = an offensive action.
---
Puking a survivor into broken state and indirectly hurting them as Plague? Acceptable.
---
Violently disemboweling them with tombstone? #acceptable!
---
Still missing the memo. Maybe try reading? I'm a killer main mate, go ask someone else.
---
Lol. Reread all of your comments and tell me none of them are salty or toxic.
---
Since when is it exploiting or a dick move to slug? There’s literally perks to help you slug....
---
Just get rid of her blink range and extra blink addons. Thats all
---
&gt;put on a delay
---
Expecting streamers to take responsibility is a big ask.
---
Yes but if IF we are going off the 21 age factor even though Laurie got a special place Nancy, Jonathan and Steve all are around17-19 years of age.
---
Agreed, camping and tunneling also aren't toxic

People just get salty over everything

That's the thing about toxicity, it's a subjective perception. But you know best, I'm being rational here so please tell me more about how salty and toxic I am and let's continue this discussion.
---
I love your flair LOL
---
Now someone flip this around to the survivor perks which are used every freaking game.
---
Idk if you’ve been dealing with this but the wraiths i encounter tunnel hard. Doing mindgames at a pallet is the best way to deal with them
---
Why are you talking shit to your fellow killers then?
---
Am i the only one that doesn’t get this? If you spare randoms that you killed somewhat easily you’d just allow them to rank up and bring their friends into a game with a ruthless killer
---
And there goes the memo. You're asking the important questions here.
---
Survivors bp gain won't change a lot. They are buffing the bold bp gain, while the main problem is the survival category. The only reason why the killers get more bp is because they get them in all 4 categories simultaneously, while the survivors have to bend over backwards to get their 4th category filled.
---
Oh no, not the crouch button!! People whining about strangers repeatedly pressing a button/key need to get a life. If that hurts your feelings I suggest getting offline and staying off. Regardless of the intent behind it offense is taken not given, but I don't exoect this community to have the maturity to understand personal accountability.
---
These would be incredible and would make some parts of the game less frustrating. The only thing I’d do is make a way do they wouldn’t be perks but passives for both sides, so a player can still punish toxic players without having to go out of their way to fill one of their perk slots. You might’ve thought of this but it just made more sense to introduce them as perks, either way great post!
---
Empathy...
---
I usually do this to relieve them of some of the negative feelings in this game. As a survivor, getting sweaty killers aiming to 4K you every time is pretty frustrating. I let survivors go when I'm killer too because I know how it feels to get destroyed over and over, and how one game against a friendly killer can make a world of difference emotionally. One game pipped wouldn't make too much of a difference to rankings for survivors anyway.
---
I mean she was a teenager when Michael attacked her but that doesn’t mean she was still a teen when the Entity took her. Her backstory doesn’t really mention the entity like some of them do.
---
After my first killer game everyone was like "gg lol. Too ez. U suck" and then changed their attitudes when I said it was my first game, then they were like "you did well for a first game". People on here literally try to trigger you JUST to trigger you
---
Pig isn't necessarily bad, she just has issues that make her frustrating to play. She's the slowest stealth killer, her ambush attack is easily avoided, and the rest of her kit is just passive stall. Unlike a lot of other killers, she doesn't really do much efficiently. It would help to give her tweaks like slightly faster stealth movement, an incentive to land an ambush attack, and quality of life changes to her addons and crouch speed. These changes wouldn't really buff her all too much, but they would go miles in terms of player fun.
---
Awesome! Dude my daughter loves watching me play! She’ll run from me yelling ahhh the trapper! And then pretends to pick up her brothers and hook them lol.
---
r/youareadumbass
---
Dying light doesn't affect exit gates unfortunately.
---
What the fuck
---
Kills ≠ fun
---
&gt; I personally don’t think that if the monster needs to be that dumb if his movement speed is slower than survivors and I think it should be slower than nurse.
---
My idea is maybe to slow down monster speed when in proximity of the Killer.
---
&gt; . I also think the doctor could have a different ability but i’m not sure what it would be and I’m not totally opposed to the movement boost.
---
Probably possible to find a cooler power for the killer indeed.
---
Awesome
---
He finally gets a buff, but this is it?? I think it’s quite loud for survivors. Makes me feel better when I do play him.
---
You can
---
A reverse im all ears
---
Now that's what I call Epic
---
They had an art contest two winners make skins one for survivor and one for killer the killer outfit was a mascot outfit for clown
---
Holy shit DbD comics that’s pretty cool. 
---
You can’t sell them at all in anyway possible unless you get a thumbs up from the company. 
---
Anyway I’m excited to see the design, nice artwork, creative thoughts and whatever else you put into it. 
---
And I sincerely hope that in some way if you do this a lot you get recognized.
---
Can someone explain why the comments are negative? What did he do?
---
Yeah, seems blue-gray to me
---
Great concept, love the look and I’m hyped for more.
---
Dean by daylight tho
---
Yea that's what I normally do too
---
And added these awesome
---
A. How the fuck did you find this
---
B. I meant variations of map realms. I distinctly remember maps on realms that I never see
---
But wouldn't that only work if the other survivor was directly behind you?
---
Ability doesn't last as long as Legion's. Maybe nerf the movement speed. But over all it's draw back is the stronger it gets, there's a longer stun duration at the end of it, as well as cooldown.
---
Should have been a locker instead of a doorway.
---
Lol, why are you complaining? 4 4 perk survs vs baby huntress.
---
Good on you
---
Again... You didnt read.
---
Here:
---
I would like to open a discussion of your experiences and how you hope dedicated servers can better our online experience.
---
I for one hope we get high tick rate servers so hitboxes can be a little bit better. Have regional servers and force players to have good ping to play. Exp: have a ping limit to be able to enter a game.
---
Trading Places - Very Rare Perk
---
When a teammate tries to unhook you and the killer is within 10 meters, you any hits landed by the killer for the next 5 seconds are landed on the asshole who hook farmed you instead.
---
I don't get it. 
---
All players are within decent ranks from each other.
---
full iridescent, teammates completed one generator between all of them and instantly went down to a huntress I got hit once by. rank reset does not need to happen every month, it only promotes toxicity and bullying/frustration between newer and experienced players. at MOST three months apart for rank reset. can't imagine what this is like for newer killers facing experienced survivors, it just mixes up the ranks for no good reason.
---
Bond is useful but it 1000x better if DLC character perks are on it. The shrine exists so you can get perks without paying
---
So the majority of the time you get a tie as nurse. Pretty acurate.
---
He’s saying his teammates were so bad that they barely survived vs a virtually perkless huntress
---
Kinda unrelated, who’s activates king crimson in the middle there?
---
Still, if you're complaining that your teammates can't loop and don't run meta builds, then don't solo queue
---
This is the kind of solo survivor stuff that makes me not want to play solo survivor
---
Just loop him they cant do anything in a safe pallet area
---
They blacklisted BBQ off the shrine so people are forced to buy bubba, since not a lot of people play him and BBQ is the most important killer perk.
---
It only shows up like once every year.
---
Speaking of rank reset being a nightmare, I had a somehow rank 6 killer dc because  we didnt let him tombstone and instead hide in lockers  when he tried to mori us
---
Good luck getting this message across, old freddy had a high skill celing and required you to learn the invisibility phases for mindgameing during the transition which was a mechanic that had no idication of its existence and gave no auditory nor visual notification of when it was ocuring. The only way to learn it was through guides, counting and practice. Once you learnt it however freddy became a tremenously better killer as it added a large risk to wakeing up, and unlike plauge no matter what action the survivor did they would still have a drawback. In combination with freddys aura reading, stall and smaller terror radius made experienced freddy terrifying to go against, since they didnt need pill bottle, only sheep block and they could know exactly when they could strike to take advantage of something.
---
You could be self careing to break out of dream world but you have no idea if a p3 freddy is keeping a close eye on you to mindgame you again as soon as you wake up for that second hit or if they are harassing your team on the other end of the map.
---
Of course freddy had his flaws but they could easily be fixed, my issue is that the devs didnt but instead spent 2 years on deleteing him and replaceing him with a new killer. Honestly in my opinion all the devs needed to do was:
---
-Prevent objective interactions during the dream transition (no more shit getting done in your face here)
---
-Put more emphesis on dream transition mindgames (audio que during freddys final invis phase, make sheep block base)
---
-Remove freddys repair debuff and replace it with gen TP (Far less obtrusive, less rng depentant and makes freddy much better on large maps)
---
-Give him dream pallets (due to his ability to get easy first hits and even downs with the dream transition or by makeing plays with aura reading i feel snares would be too strong, not only that but dream pallets encourage the survivors to check their surroundings to get an idea of whats real and whats fake (very freddy like) and would give newer freddys at higher ranks a chase tool to play with).
---
Although what is listed is a lot, in comparison with the full rework, freddy will retain all of what previousely made him freddy as well as have all of his previous draw backs fixed and have more strengths to work with, i feel like new freddy is too generic of a killer and him being seperate from reality doesnt feel blatant enough, i feel pallets on their own are too weak as they are compleatly reliant on survivors and dream snares are too boreing as they dont do as much in the survivors head as the pallets.
---

Not sure how this is controversial. I found it funny because I have never seen or heard tru3 react like this before, despite watching him for years.
---
I also thought it'd be more funny to clip it like I did, for more of a comedic effect.
---
Billy seems more likely, he fits the conditions for the entity pretty well
---
They guy payed some fiverr guys to hold a sign saying: "death to all jews", just for the sake of edgy humor, and besides that he said the n word on stream. No matter what the articles have said, that's kinda off hard of a stain to get removed.

After rank reset there is usually a MASSIVE skill level difference between players of the exact same rank.
---
When i play killer i sometimes face survivors who are total potatoes (cannot even look behind themselves during chases) and also survivors which are so good i have to give up the chase. its insane lol
---
Well the clip didnt show that so i dont know what i was expected to think.
---
Killer needs to be more intimidating, honestly the only killer is intimidating Michael Myers true killer. He is the only killer when you see you leg it you don’t try to loop you just leg it as far as possible. the rest are not as much. 
---
Clown needs a huge puff of course. Freddy is good. Nurse is scary on good hands only. Chainsaw not much.
---
It doesn't really derank you, if you're smart about when you camp, if i have a swf player hooked in the middle of 3 gens which i can patrol without losing sight on the hook you bet i'm going to camp, swf players always go back to save their friends, it's practically free kills.
---
Hag is by far my best killer, but I don't like playing her because of how much I have to focus with her.
---
That's what it clearly says. But it DOES stack
---
look for the shimmer, if he sneaks up on you just run to pallets and learn how to chase an M1 killer.
---
ez game ez life
---
The auto chat filter, like it shouldn't be there for everyone just those who want it and choose to turn it on
---
no one got destroyed he got stuck for a whole game and the survivors died at end game makes sense why he did not pip OP never bothered to put in some context about the situation
---
If you can get a free hit, take it. If you make a t2 hook it's a good one. Also if you will scare someone from a jigsaw box, it means they have to run back without a heartbeat and waste more time. So it's not THAT useless if target is close. If it's a two second chase, it worth it even for a deathhook because it's sure -1 surv.
---
Still no point in actually running a mile for checking a box or actually making a long chase after trapped guy. Better to consider more appropriate targets.
---
Oh that's nice I'll have to use it more often
---
Fun fact for those who haven't seen saw 3, that is the outfit Amanda died in.
---
Complaining on a Reddit thread is sad, yet here you are, responding to “sad” people. 
---
I’m assuming you’re new to the game, but a team of good SWF will beat every single killer. And that isn’t exciting, nor balanced gameplay. 
---
How about this: We could get rid of ranked reset so people stop playing with shitters. Big brain thought, I know.
---
r/dogelore
---
Is he complaining about his teammates or is he complaining about rank reset? 
---
I'm not sure how reading anything that OP said led you to the conclusion that he was complaining about his teammates.
---
well it really is clickbait and made to look like he destroyed them but yet did not pip
---
Just bring offerings 
---
The map selection is random anyway so you are probably just unlucky or you notice the maps you don't like more
---
I wish all of my games would be on those maps, they are the best one for a reason.

Does it really matter? Let the man have his victory 🥳

---
Oh yikes this community can't just have a laugh can they. Time to ignore all other comments on this thread
---
Ghost face and legion are very different
---
killer will immediately manifest bloodlust 7
---
Agreed, but it would make it more intimidating if you didn't know you had about a 70% chance of out running them as long as you can bait out one M1 attack lol
---
I'd opt for Crate of Gears over one of those two
---
Random Claudette: Oh no! It’s the kille- wait, why are your pants wet?
---
If you have a flashlight shine it on him while he's cloaked it burns him which is basically just a stun but he can't do anything about it
---
Last night on a brand new Freddy I used about 1.1mil Bloodpoints (maxed + 3 dailies) and hit lvl 39, but I definitely could have reached another level or 2 if I hadn't gone out of my way to grab iridescent add-ons a few times
---
You can download the Xbox app and download whatever you screenshot/recorded pretty easily.
---
Actually brilliant. The killer one needs to be slightly nerfed tho so that survivors who try to crouch away stealthily wont be punished. And the killer should lose the effect once hooking a person
---
we can just with some context. you cannot really deny this tells us nothing. idk how it is even funny since it is a 5 second clip of him laughing nothing funny happening at all honestly
---
I personally hate it. I feel that it was unnecessary and it pierces my ears. Please BHVR revert this change because nobody requested this.
---
I see youtubers getting the same maps over and over like I do, All I find in chests are toolboxes and medkits, it's not very often I find keys or maps
---
*Hits on Head with bell* Shame.
---
Yea lol which keeps legion at a pretty low spot on tier lists. At least he’s more fun to play against now... mixtape legion was cancer
---
Ah yes, punish friends trying to have fun! Cause that totally makes things better for everyone! It totally doesn't create toxicity! This system of averaging out all of the SWF levels is way better than what it was before, and it is definitely better than pitting a level 17 against a level 4 killer. It shouldnt be a consequence of wanting to have fun with your friends.. you can't do anything about your friends being high ranked. You shouldnt be punished for wanting to play with your friends.
---
...no. That's now it works.  Some ways are just more effective than others. I mean if the trapped survivor is a big dummy and runs into you like a survivor did in my last game, yeah smack em down and hook em up. But trapping someone's head means you dont have to worry about them making progress for the survivors until their trap is back on.  Tracking them down again just defeats the purpose of the trap.
---
You don’t owe them nothing you don’t have to feel bad at all..

Yeah, nerfing FMT, making Deep Wounds apply to TR instead of chase OR ending Frenzy on a missed hit would have all been appropriate nerds. All 3 though!? Massacred my girl Susie

damn, you're really good.

Hey, that doesn’t rhyme. *Loads .44 revolver* You have 5 seconds...
---
Jake is totally the most neutral survivor out of them all, and wouldn't fit in here.
---
He can be a sabo demon, and a good looper, but he is not known for much toxic behaviour or immersion. It's quite refreshing most times, because Jake's tend to die late or survive because his team was toxic and got thrown in the basement. Super helpful with heals and blocking hooks, and is not to much of a try hard.
---
Created using Mematic
---
Still, two kills is considered a fair balanced game by the devs perspective.
---
Nonetheless I sympathize with being matched with high rank people, but you seem to be doing just fine 😋
---
Ok goo goo has gas cringe baby
---
sorry for trying to enjoy not only god meta perks
---
idk hopefully Karma got him later with a SWF that have flashlights; Like the pick up was not necessary as either hit them right off the bat or just let them go. No point in toying with people
---
Not toxic to have fun.  It’s not at the cost of anyone else’s either, so yeah, not toxic.
---
&gt;by having a near guarantee of preventing DS with basically no drawback, 
---
What are you talking about? There's an **incredible** drawback for dodging decisive. You have to let the survivor be slugged for up to a minute and risk them being revived, or waste a minute of your own time camping them. Are we talking about the same mechanic?
---
Oh right. Lmao. Whoops. I just quickly glanced at it while I was waiting for a match to finish loading in. I just saw the pictures looked similar.
---
Idk since your rank 1 why not post your gameplay man your obviously the best out there since majority swf parties that do the t-bag/flashlight clicking isn't toxic.
---
You post a video and I'll post mine
---
Oink Oink you capitalist pig

They do stack. But it's not worth running both.

---
\*laughts in lightborn\* yeah that was quite cold.
---
Yeah ive been having that a lot, od af for killers
---
Alright I'll admit that's a significant drawback. As I said before I really wasn't heavily decided either way. I don't think wasting even up to a minute is completely balanced with nullifying a perk, but at this point I'd agree that's more of just tweaking the balance rather have the killer being a dick
---
You did and that's perfect flash spammers are pure evil like they only waste their flashlight durability

Nah. Nurse would be like Tic Tac Toe except with only 1 square. “Tic”.

It's boring because survivor has no choice in the game. If the killer wants you dead and has an IQ higher than their rank, unless you get 3 competent survivors.
---
Maybe Switch?
---
That's only because myers gets stronger by staring at you. He's a good killer but not the most intimidating in the game.
---
It is about switch but how are you going to connect to the internet on the bus?
---
There's no competitive advantage to crouch spamming or spamming ur flashlight (which is a disadvantage since it runs out ur battery so no pallet blinds/flashlight saves for u good sir). It's a taunt, it's only meant to make the person ur doing it to annoyed and aggravated. Therefore whatever the result is, is irrelevant. If your behavior is for nothing more than to obtain a negative reaction from someone, then ur behavior is toxic.
---
&gt;It never was a discussion.
---
the truth is twitchy, the game was rigged from the start
---
If you're so inclined, you can free the killer by being injured and slow vaulting they they can grab you.
---
We did, haha

I think a huge part of the problem is that being able to be anonymous inherently gives people the feeling that they can be as dickish and mean as they want with no drawbacks, simply because no one knows who they really are and they will probably never see the person they're making fun of ever again.
---
I'm not really sure how temporarily banning someone would help the problem tho but I guess it's better than doing nothing about the problem

I do belive that this whole thread is just a huge bruh moment

When do I get that thar mask?

Oof
---
I don’t agree with a few things, like what’s so wrong with running meta perks? And blaming a hit on lag isn’t a bad thing. The player hosted servers are some horse shit.
---
Just don't give a f*** about what toxic idiots say.
---
i do not like this image, charlie.  it’s smug aura haunts me
---
one of the people that believe that most of the pewdiepie fanbase is children. Its like 20-30% children tho, he has seen his own analytics and most of his viewers are between the age of 15 to 24
---
Then they should just delete that line outright since the perk no longer allows you to cumulate. It was previously 25%/50%/100% and it would stack up to 100% but now it's 100% across the three tiers so it's pointless to stipulate. 
---
And before that it used to stack up to 300% so I mean I dunno.
---
That's the internet for you. Anonymity can bring out the worst in people. There's 100% people who are just never going to change, but encouraging people to do so I think would greatly improve this game's experience.
---
We need more people like this. The ps4 killers are toxic af
---
i gotta say, id like for pewds to play dbd but the pewdiepie subreddit is a shithole of stolen, reposted and unoriginal memes, fake tweets and petitions
---
My friend also just pointed out, that the first hit doesnt even connect [https://i.gyazo.com/thumb/1200/838148273e3c269e683434f3f87f98cf-jpg.jpg](https://i.gyazo.com/thumb/1200/838148273e3c269e683434f3f87f98cf-jpg.jpg)
---
Agreed on a individual scale. It's the fact that this is such a common place thing and even some streamers encourage this kind of behaviour that's the problem.
---
15 to 24? But his content is so cringey? 15 to 24 like that? ....ugh even more of a reason.
---
I don't understand the point of those I can never ever get one to actually go off
---
is this ironic or do you actually think he is a nazi?
---
Ghostface he’s fun
---
wraith voice: what’s up epic gamers today you’re gonna see an awesome little trick of mine
---
I completely agree on that, but when they purposely do it it should be a 3 hour temp ban or something.
---
I think the pig is fine honestly, she is my favorite killer and i normally get to rank 6 or 5 every reset with just her
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of bug: In game
---
Description: After matches I get a "an error has occured cannot update Rank"
---
Pretty self explanatory
---
I’ve been playing ever since it was added to Gamepass like a month ago. I like the game and have hit rank 7 for both survivor and killer before the rank reset. 
---
It goes without a hitch that half my games I have people saying I’m trash. I honestly find it hilarious, because it’s usually from the person who has been hooked three times and have nothing better to do than to wait for their friends and build up salt. I believe people take this game far too seriously and it speaks volumes when they send messages like that - it tells me they literally have nothing better going for them in life other than DBD.
---
I like to message them back and troll. I have a huge collection of toxic hate mail from these losers that my friends and I like to laugh over.
---
You saying “this is going on Reddit” makes me take the other guy’s side. 
---
/s
---
It doesn't match the theme for my other games. REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
How the fuck does "Plays for fun" describe me so well
---
*and zat's how I lost my medical license*
---
I have to agree lol, sometimes a survivor will try to run out the exit gate when its activated amd instantly kills them
---
I think it's a balance of time it takes to find the trapped survivor. If I can hear the survivor attempting to take a trap off, or fail a skill check within chasing distance, I'll go for the easy injured survivor rather than patrolling gens that may or may not yield another survivor. The purpose of traps isn't just kills, or gen pressure...sometimes it's just kill pressure. The trapped survivor is spending all their time and focus on taking off the helmet which makes them easy prey. If you can get two hooks on a trapped survivor it will make it all the easier when that survivor inevitably takes the helmet off. The worst situation you can be in is using all 4 of your traps with only one hook on each survivor, leaving you with zero pressure for the rest of the game
---
I think the only one who doesn't understand us u he's saying pewdiepie not cringey (which he's not) u just find things cringier than they really are. He's saying maybe u just cringe too easily
---
Oink Oink
---
Karen you toxic Nea, release me from this hook this instant
---
To infinity an basement camping
---
&gt;Thats what you said unless youre dumb and dont understand what you said
---
why? i just said that his content is not cringy and thats it, or can you use "cringy" to also refer to someone who gets cringy vibes easily?im not that good at english btw so im really asking right now
---
&gt;Being a pewdiepie fan im not suprised.
---
ok what? "ho yes, i see you watch some of this persons content, i assume your iq is below 0 at this point, really im not surprised by the inferiority of your kind" that was rude and unnecesary
---
Now I see why jane keeps alerting the killer.
---
After the endgame nerf to pig she cant really do much else tbh
---
I used the survivors to destroy the survivors
---
Meanwhile, Im facing this toxic killer all day whos been bringing ivorys just for me and tunneling me. You guys are very lucky.
---
I started a playing hag a few days ago and today I went against a full swf and they kept trying to break my ruin totem and I tried to protect it but eventually they broke it and all the gens were done  and they all were tbagging and flashlight clicking at the gates. 
---
But trust if I run into them again I have a ebony mori on my lvl 50 Myers with their name on it. Also I'll add the infinite tier 3 as well.
---
I was on your side until I saw the "this is going on Reddit"
---
Or really fuck you over😂😂🤷
---
Well survivors have a camera that can show what's behind walls without them moving a inch, even if you're hidden on your screen you could be easily spotted by them that or another survivor is following you and kicking you out of it.
---
Im done man. This is also why he shouldnt come his fans just add to the toxicity here.
---
So pretty much if your any way at all visible your screwed?
---
No you're right, if the trapped survivor is making themselves an easy target, then absolutely go for them like I said. I just mean that you shouldn't prioritize them over other survivors that are probably trying to rush gens. Don't tunnel them down because they're less of a threat toward ending the game than the other survivors.
---
Ahhh younglings soon you will be slaying the survivors
---
Ladies and gentlemen why we do not BM Micheal Myers😂😂
---
Yep but I believe they need to see atleast 25 % of your body for them to spot you. They probably won't do anything about because messing with the survivors camera could make it iffy all around.
---
- Dont hurt feelings on the dbd subreddit, Survivor rulebook tome 12 page 429
---
I don’t know why you added the “I never feel pain” part but I will say that you forgot to teabag after downing her
---
Just turn off messages
---
Remorse fits better but don’t feel like changing it
---
Whatever you say my guy.
---
Solo survivor is also a FUCKING NIGHTMARE. I'm like you I haven't played much since rank reset so when I do, I'm stuck at low ranks.
---
I don't want to turn off messages because I play other game and people message me from good things.
---
And sometimes I let the last survivor go (kill him, close the hatch, take him to the door, let him open it / escape), especially when one disconnects, and he thank me so I don't want to loose that either!
---
Huntress is free on PC though
---
YES PLEASE, as a killer, when they T-bag I just turn into reaper in the death bloom and repeatedly say in my mind DIE DIE DIE over and over and when I play survivor and they camp I just do the same and this could change that game, well killers could just watch from afar so it should do the same when they are looking cause they could just stay far away

---
I hate to be THAT guy. 
---
But without context, it sounds like you might soft patrol hooks and you do tunnel survivors. 
---
If you don’t want to get hate messages, perhaps playing a different way. 
---
Play your game how you want, just don’t get mad if people call you out for ruining the fun of the game.
---
Long as you don't slug, you're fine for me. Slugging makes you an asshole because you're basically admitting to making the game boring as that's what most people do if they only slug. Camping is only a good strat against solo survivors. Tunneling is only a good strat when theres no BT or DS at all.
---
are you sure, i’m pretty sure it’s not?
---
Nah I'd say he's the most intimidating. Certainly not the strongest but the jumpscares and his overall presence make him intimidating imo.
---
Nothing is scarier than Uncle Touchy's tickle basement.

Yes just decided to go on steam just now just to check she is indeed free

Nah you just didn't provide any context.

You mean they are just playing the game?

And here's a video of him failing, he's nice NiceJewksBoixD - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XFnqaZ-8RsI&amp;list=PLrwr92MFS_9F-0aPOsEYHq69YwfAuMzuu&amp;index=17&amp;t=2s
---
He can call me out all he wants but he can't back up his trash talk.
---
thank you. and yea i know!
---
Spine Chill is a good perk against him.  It will let you know when he is coming your way.  You will be able to find out if he has nurses as well if he immediately comes to you while healing. 
---
Other than that once he comes out of stealth it’s a pretty normal chase.  Know some good routes and be ready buy as much time as possible so gens can pop.
---
Okay so lemme extrapolate your logic real quick. 
---
Crouch spamming and flashlight clicking isn't toxic bc it doesn't elicit reactions. So that means that it would only be toxic if it *DID* elicit a reaction. Meaning the attempt isn't what's wrong, it's the result. 
---
Which means it's okay for me to attempt to do something bad, bc if I fail then I didn't do anything wrong by your own logic. 
---
So if I went to a public park right now and tried to lead a little boy into my car with the intention of molesting him, it's only a bad thing if he gets in my car and I drive away with him, NOT if he runs away and tells his mom and I get the cops called on me.
---
I attempted to do this with the last survivor who was stuck in a griefing team. Three of them all did the rushed enter locker thing in basement and practically killed themselves, tbagging near the hooks and stuff. They all dc'd after I got them down.
---
I located the hatch and messaged the last survivor, who just wanted to play the game normally, a regular dude. I don't think he read my messages though, and didn't go to hatch when I told him where it was, for like fifteen minutes. 
---
I decided to patrol the map and lead him to it, showing peace and what not, but he just got scared and ran away each time. He finally disconnected after seeing me for a fourth time. I felt terrible because I just wanted to help him. Getting onto a griefing team like that sucks.
---
Wherever you are, friend, I hope you've gotten matched with better teams.
---
YES! We definitely need more people like him in this game. :)
---
Also that noise has a decent range that survivors can hear it.  You can use this as sometimes hearing the noise makes them try to juke, you can wait for it and then throw when they stop.
---
They aren't real people. They are just bodies to slay
---
I like playing legion cause I typically run gen protector builds and Frenzy I use more as a means of getting from one place to another quicker. Of course killer instinct is really useful as I use it to find survivors who are off by themselves. More than once it helped me realize a swf was camping the exit gates. Though if I'm honest I don't think I'll get out of green ranks as them
---
"Doing gens, you?"
---
Poor Noob3... That gameplay was infuriating to watch. The edit he made from the Claudette's perspective was hilarious.
---
What?
---
It isn't toxic whether or not it elicits a reaction, it's sheer stupidity on the survivor's behalf for wasting their own time and flashlight charges.
---
It's perceived as being toxic by salty players.
---
Applying real world logic to video game behaviour does not apply here, that's an atrocious argument.
---
When a survivor has piss poor ping, when he starts revealing you, it won't start immediately like it should and he can reveal you from behind cover because he's lagging. On his end, he's been looking at you for long enough. On yours however, he hasn't. Lag ruins ghost face sadly.
---
The more popular the game gets, the more toxic it does as well. No thanks, I've already been called a slur almost every round this week even though I play fair and use off meta builds. Thanks though.
---
That sounds stupid as fuck.
---
It does.
---
Probably. I haven't played her much but i definitely remember struggling to get the second blink out consistently, there's not as much time there as i felt there would/should be
---
This we can agree on.
---
At what rank do they, "always talk about nerfing killers?"
---
You must be new to the game.
---
Also got 23000 points, 5000 more points than anyone else in the game, and is complaining that they have perks?
---
You seem to be well versed in the way of boosting.
---
Downvoted for speaking facts.
---
That's what I do, I let them jiggle out but I have to slug them first for a few douzens of seconds
---
Oh yeah my bad. I agree with you there, I kind of forgot the topic was the pig.
---
Theres no reason not to use your power if you lose line of sight. Crouching while stalking a gen will reduce your wooshy noise. Use walls as often as possible and try not to take chases that you don't have Marks on too hard.
---
Same here. I feel... Watched
---
Omegablink nurse is exempted from all dbd laws and physics. She isnt counted here.
---
I use Legion to farm BP for new perks/addons for the rest of my killers.
---
I got boosted to rank 6 by my 4 man SWF and I'm NOT  a good looper at all. They do most of the work every game.
---
escape cake and ice cream are on its way!
---
You get triggered so easily you poor boy, look at you getting all emotional and personal over a video game :') To think that wasn't even about you but you can't help yourself. Share everything you have if it makes you feel better little boy, I didn't care then and still don't now.
---
Where're your gameplay videos Mr. Bignote? Lmao grow up mate xD
---
I feel like a universal voice comm in the game while making people feel real, would just allow for more ways to be toxic. Look at CS:GO voice chats for an example. Even though you can put a voice to the character, your still anonymous. The survival/killer queue idea would be good for getting players to experience both sides and could eliminate some unnecessarily toxic behaviour as everyone would know how it feels to e.g be teebagged, camped and tunneled. The problem with that idea is people just prefer different sides. I personally don't like playing survivor without friends as I hate having my fate decided by people I don't know and i'm sure others feel similarly.
---
But... how did you know who was who?
---
I was 14-15 during my phase of dc’ing when games didn’t go my way, I was just your typical salty child on psn who had a massive ego when it came to games he thought he was good at. I was a shit player, I was a shit survivor a year ago. Can you really say I’m the same fucking person now? Dc’ing is so rare from me it almost never happens. I am not the best at this game, I’m far from perfect and I can be very toxic still to this day. But I NEVER make it personal like you do, I want to be better at both the game and being a good person which is more than you can say for yourself,
---
Sincerely,
---
The 16 Year Old that has kept you butt hurt for 2 years over a facecamp
---
But in that case a lot of players just wouldn't care. Locking GAMEPLAY behind a paywall, especially in a game with a base cost, is way more obnoxious than having cosmetics one must pay for.
---
Plus, if people were hacking millions of BP at one point for just a gameplay advantage, I'm sure people would look hard for exploits to get devotion points if those got them free premium skins. I'd rather Devotion give something unique, or just a fat stack of shards.
---
"Grabs popcorn"
---
What was said in the endgame chat?
---
I once had a Claudette hide from me in literal plain sight. She blended into the wall on The Game Map. Finally I took a chance and hit the wall and found her!
---
(If that person see this PS4)
---
Not every swf is deranked aholes. I play with friends who are actual rank 12-14 survivors, so they would have terrible time playing against my rank killers of insta chainsaw Billies, no sound spirits, unlimited level 3 Myers etc. You think it's bad what rank 2 survivors do to rank 10 killers? At least you can "win". Imagine what rank 1 killers will do to rank 12 survivors who just run straight and drop pallets immediately.
---
It's not a black and white issue of "survivors are toxic aholes".
---
Congrats?
---
He probably doesn’t have leatherface
---
I don’t actually dislike all your videos, maybe they are just that shit lol. I have been perma’d once, like I said, I was 14. I have not been banned ONCE on NiceJewksBoiXD but I have changed my name since then, Caaandy-Feng xD
---
I second that, most of them are assholes, now there are a few that are cool but most of the ones I’ve come across are just straight douches! Anything for a view, and I hate how any streamer out there just comes straight out and blames the reason they got killed was sniping! With the randomness of this game it was a fluke that you got into the same lobby, happens every now and then. We have no control over that.
---
Guys mad at slugging builds.
---
Thought this was gonna be that wraith video when he got really pissed off.
---
Perhaps you should take a deep breath and re-read what you've typed before saying you're not making it personal and calling me butthurt xD
---
Go on, give another not personal not butthurt paragraph, your walls of text are so enlightening into who I really am :')
---
because it's a team game for them bro. If they die just because they had two disconnects, it's a cheap win and an unsatisfying death for them. If you help them, they come back to get killed again. respect the prey bro.
---
Ok I take it back, I'm a console peasant, I don't know the wrath of a good nurse, I'm a dirty console player,  lock me up and pour hot wax on me as punishment daddy trapper
---
Is this you ending drama? Commenting on a post that had nothing to do with trying to call me out? Mmhmm not getting personal huh look how paranoid I am xD
---
Only slug if you definitely know where the last guy is. If not, just hook the guy you downed.
---
Uno reverse that when you can't buy the cosmetic, or one of them.

What, is Myers waiting for his drunk daughter to come home three hours late from “studying”?

Do you have sprint burst? That could help create some distance before he uncloak
---
I have a hard time believing that you're that bad, but hey maybe I am wrong. Wouldn't be the first time I've made a mistake.
---
I have some friends who aren't very good. I try to get them out but they usually die or escape but don't pip. Not that any of us really care.
---
Just a bug is all

Well he promoted a nazi propaganda YouTube video if I remember correctly and has said and/promoted anti Semitic shit. Call me ignorant, but sounds like some nazi shit to me
---
ghostface is in the a tier?
---
I guess there are exceptions to every rule eh.
---
I still stand by my post though.
---
Ya I disagree. I run urban evasion and spine chill every game and am mostly never found every game. Still find time to do gens and get people off hooks as well.
---
Thanks : ) I appreciate it! How much blood points will it cost?
---
I’m just sitting here watching this all go down 🥤
---
I feel like it is really easy to level up characters. Takes me a few days to get a character to 40 to unlock all their teachables, and most people get their perks from the shrine as well.
---
Plot twist: Jigsaw is the entity.
---
How is choosing to patrol boxes, instead of the objective that will win survivors the game, toxic?
---
I'm a Pig main, I don't do patrol boxes because it's a stupid thing to do but it's hardly toxic.
---
So weird. If someone gets kills by patrolling boxes and *exploiting(?)* the mechanic where people with a trap have to take the trap off, then let them *play their own game.*
---
The first one is pretty bad. 
---
Vs certain killers you crouch to avoid their power, with this you are getting punished for playing around their ability.
---
yeah seems a bit weird how they only care about stats in a game
---
Bruh that's literally a dummy good idea, Jennifer Tilly was awesome in the chucky movies so I'd be down, plus she'd easily be the new hottest killer.
---
Crate of Gears + Jigsaw Sketch on Ormond got me a 3k Game Over. Gave the David hatch as a reward for surviving.
---
In addition to what other people have said, Claudette basically literally becomes one with the map on the swamp maps.
---
Oh I don't, not sure what gave you that impression.
---
And you kinda missed my point because I'm *not* saying those things are inherently toxic. I'm specifically saying they aren't and that intention matters.
---
Thanks mate
---
"Look son, another perk, completly usless because SWF exists"  
---
"But Daddy this one is only a fanmade  idea and you shouldnt judge others for there creativity and engagement in the game they like"
---
Yup. Otherwise there would be three survivors and not four.
---
I should’ve worded it better. I was referring to tunneling. I think tunneling especially when on a Killer specifically designed to extend the match. Trap and hook, move away, sure go back for that rescuer, put a trap on them, but to completely ignore everyone to tunnel one person wastes your time and a trap.
---
I have no sons anylonger ! Because this gun is a genderbending GUN !
---
Sees that killer is shirtless myers uhhh nvm *hides gun*
---
If they rework nurse and she drops a tier this game would be done for
---
r/lostredditors ?  This doesn't really have anything to do with dbd, or am I missing something?
---
So if you hook the obsession in a match where everyone obsessed over hook rescue and slam everyone coming to the rescue by staying there...
---
Then I apologise, clearly this was a misunderstanding.
---
I still think that "toxicity" is subjective and since you can't gauge someone's intent in-game, it's difficult to define what constitutes toxic behaviour.
---
&gt;If they rework nurse and she drops a tier this game would be done for
---
Are you from the future?
---
If it's purely cosmetic I'm down. I'm too stingy to pay for them on their own but a $10-$20 battle pass doesn't sound horrible.
---
Yeah I heard about that and it changed my perception of him. When you make it big like him you have to be aware of your own image and how that affects others. Supporting Nazis and alt right groups was a choice he made that showed his true colors to the world.

Also, survivors need killer skins, for luls.

May have been out of character for Amanda to let someone go though
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhh
---
In Pig's defence, the RNG of the boxes can, in my opinion, often make one of her two abilities a non-factor, especially considering the charge attack is garbage already.
---
From there, you have the crouch to work with and I honestly believe there can be something in checking boxes, if it's getting you hooks and ultimately removing players from the game, why not?
---
And the outfit during the flashback in the first title, when she played the game with the Reverse Bear Trap.
---
I don't play killer much as my friends told me to get better with survivors first but I really only get ranked with high level killers even though I'm still around rank 20 survivor
---
Oh its one of those posts....
---
If you see a Nea with the face-mouth-mask-thingy you allways know that she's 100% toxic.
---
I think you only unlock that skin if you atleast get reported 20x times.
---
It's kinda true though. High ranking SWFs would run rampant with Haddonfield offerings.
---
It will never stop, BHVR allowed people like Ochido to promote their game, and they have basically balanced it so each survivor is as strong as a killer if they know what they are doing
---
Plus the major content creators do toxic builds, and I know at least with some it's not intentional, but stuff like that just makes it worse
---
Only way to fix it would be to make the game killer sided, ie survivors had to actually be good to win
---
Currently running around a tree is enough to win the game as a survivor
---
If all killers were strong enough to kill loops fast like Billy or spirit, and perks like ruin weren't required past rank 15 then the game wouldn't be this week toxic
---
Basically where this toxic stuff comes from is survivors usually as friends go against a bunch of m1 killers, and can wipe the floor with them, as m1 killers are pretty weak. The survivors start thinking they are good, then they get cocky, and bam toxic survivor main
---
At least that's how it was for me
---
Thankfully I nipped that in the bud shortly after it began
---
Google is hard huh?
---
Bill
---
There is nothing wrong with it.  
---
People that want to win are taking these perks.  
---
But also toxic people that try their best to stay alive as long as possible to bully the killer are also taking these perks.  
---
The "I only play for fun" type usually tries out different stuff and doesn't rely on OP survivor perks.
---
I mean it does discourage people from entering matches with bad ping. Happens in games like rainbow six, cs:go, for honor, etc.

This man, a full grown ADULT, making such a joke or mistake to his viewers who are young kids? Yeah that’s irresponsible and not just a simple mistake being blown out of proportion by the media. You trying to explain his behavior is like trying to excuse Trump’s racist shit pre-election, where it was all “just talk.” Yeah let’s not condone that kind of stuff, because it’s all just a simple “mistake.” /s 
---
You can’t just excuse and try to defend this. When he puts forward a sincere apology for all the shit and “mistakes” he has done then I’ll reconsider these mistakes of his. Until then Nazi-boi can keep to himself
---
Idk the people I see getting a high amount are the ones that get chased by the killer
---
Stream sniping isnt even a bannable offense LOL !
---
Get good you salty bitch
---
You don't HAVE to get a 4k. 3k can get you a pip if you weren't complete shit during the game.
---
Jumping off a cliff and being toxic are extremely different and shouldnt be compared.
---
Don't know why people are downvoting you.  
---
Atleast you are honest, buddy.
---
Due to the outrage the pig terror radius change never made it past the ptb.
---
I'm a pretty good PS4 nurse. Probably top 10 in the world. Omegablink is an auto win.
---
Points like to level your blood web? It levels so quickly already though man like a single full day worth of playing would put me up 10 levels
---
That's so fucking lame...
---
Oh, naw. I just use them because they work for me, and they’re good. I like to win, I’m not a t-bagging, flashlight clicking Nea. Though, I do play Nea with her nice outfits, or Meg.
---
still a tough task
---
The community's too toxic to welcome new players, so your game will continue dying :)
---
I always cheer for my Feng sisters when I see them putting in that good work.
---
Hey....that's pretty good!
---
Who would win: pressing literally one button on your controller / keyboard or taking a picture on your phone?
---
I always let them farm if someone DC's early on.
---
Ok
---
The unbalanced nature of the game by giving  suvivors all the power, makes it easy for both sides to be toxic and the frustration is going to explode on others that have nothing to do with your mood, yet creating more toxicity.
---
I have also seen lots of Pigs who just camp while crouched, then always tunnel down the unhooked, bear trapped survivor.
---
Anybody in this thread smoke weed?
---
Highest of koala tea
---
Have a snack Carl 🍎
---
Yeah I just mean like, per game, people are scoring a lot more points than me per game.
---
Plays for fun is on point. I mostly play Nea and David now but used to be an Ace main when i played on console.
---
Except for the nea part this also applies to me.  
---
I want to win. Most of the time losing isn't fun for me.  
---
So I play optimally.  
---
I am a killer main, but you can bet your ass I'll be running DS-Adrenaline-Dead Hard-BT(Or switch this one for something else) just to be as OP as possible.  
---
I'll be absuing every unfair loop spot there is.
---
I also play Claudette for her camouflage and mostly just do gens. Don't care about ruin.  
---
But I still won't t-bag or flicker like an idiot.
---
Wraith: *puts on gen-grabber build*
---
"I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move..."
---
Appreciate it. Died later in the game, but had some good chases against him.
---
Lol. Shes my fav.
---
Yeah but if they're chased the whole game they don't have time for gens so doesn't it balance out? The people not being chased do gens and get points for that instead of being chased.
---
Feng is the best girl. Do not @ me.
---
God help you if the killer is running ebony aura reading perks
---
Agreed IMO if you camp you should have a reason to do so such as people being nearby meaning that 2+ people arent working on gens however teabagging has no excuse and flashlight spamming if you mean spam clicking flashlight to make a distinct sound to taunt killers has no excuse but stunning them when they vault break pallets or get stunned yes its a strategy to do so
---
No I'm just that lazy
---
Thank you my good man
---
What do you mean by dialing back ?
---
Honestly just reading through this thread really paints a better picture as to why this post exists lmao
---
Cunt
---
Yeah. I agree with this statement. Aura reading is a must for killer on these kind of maps.
---
There is certain perks and items you can equip that make you collect more blood points when you do certain things. Just unhook people, escape chases, do generators. All those things should have you stacking points pretty quick.
---
Just turn your messages to friends only it’s what I did
---
Is this a real perk?
---
Then you let out a big manly moan even if playing as a female survivor.
---
Feel yah dude, I have been at red ranks so many times that I'm sick of it
---
I just want to chill, play some doc or ghost face and farm bp
---
I like how you’re reading my own post history and the whole reason im here back to me like I didnt just do it myself😂 oh no ive been exposed 😩😩 go boof a chode you weak ass pleabolite
---
It’s highly unlikely they would rework Nurse. Even if they did, there’s other killers who need it more or huge QoL than her.
---
Lmao more proof you're pathetic man ;)
---
You ever ran around a tree for a minute strait and the game kept letting the survivor dead hard
---
15 times
---
I agree with this because in my mind toxicity isn't what u do in the game it's how u talk to and interact with those ppl after the game is over if someone instaheals, flashlights, teabags, and bodyblocks I'm not gonna think of that person as toxic until end game chat when I get a "gg ez"
---
Unfortunately this sub has worsened it. I've become a serial tbagger. Every win now :'(
---
Question about the nurse. I've seen something about it but just wanted to confirm. Is it possible to "short blink" by holding the backwards movement key, or was that wrong?
---
That’s just more than sad. 
---
Like I appreciate all the new skins that are coming frequently right now but they should put most of their resources into bug fixing.
---
Whenever I have people not going to the hatch, I just close it and let them escape through the gates, or endgame collapse if they really aren’t wanting to come out.
---
I searched from top of year and just kept browsing for maybe half an hour. I really enjoy the memes in this sub.
---
&gt;It’s highly unlikely they would rework Nurse. Even if they did, there’s other killers who need it more or huge QoL than her.
---
They already extra officially said she is being / will be reworked, is just a matter of time.
---
Shit that would be cool
---
Most threads are about crying survivors actually, but id you don't like this sub you can leave :)
---
Can confirm, it's been ongoing on PC since the Wake Up bug as well
---
Add me then and we can settle this like 25 year old men you soft bitch
---
There are bugs still in this game from a year ago
---
My favorite is when all possible pallet spawns happen at once
---
Basically the only time I'll leave a match
---
Teabagging to get the killers attention is something I'm guilty of once in a while, but the idea of tbagging at the gate, just really rubbing a killers nose in their defeat, only to escape and find out theyre like rank 19 would sadden my soft heart :( Just seeing a survivor teabag is more a sigh moment then anything, but it's still fuckin depressing that so many people on both sides start this game up with the intention of tilting the other side.
---
golden feng? Can't tell
---
So it isn't if you simply catch survivors with traps. You have to actually pick them up directly from the trap as if they were injured. 
---
My only advice is, make sure you're in picking up range so you don't accidentally attack them instead. Maybe also use Insidious and camp around the corner of your traps to make sure they don't luck their way out of them
---
Half the roster need reworks/buffs atm
---
Someone's asked me for my nudes just because I'm a female. AnythonyMiqo is just stating facts. Younger men/teenage boys will generally watch women with facecams not because the streamer is good but because they're a female. Hell, I sometimes watch female streamers and a lot of people will watch the streamer because of that. They won't tell you stop being an ass, they'll tell you  how funny it was even if it wasn't. 
---
Proof: Look at Just Chatting. A lot of women will wear more or less revealing clothes because views. They want to do that for money. Same thing goes for drag streamers. People won't give a shit if you're toxic because it appeals to them.
---
I like it other than Dean's 2nd perk being worse empathy. Also I feel like protector should move you along one hook state when you use it to make it more balanced and it still makes sense lore wise.
---
It’s like it’s a Pig x Myers love child that skipped out on his training.
---
I believe he was outright stating it. No implication.
---
Yep same. I’m so sick of losing my damn shit and matches cause this fucking game is broken and I CANT WIN. I can’t walk through the fucking gate
---
(Xbox player) Well maybe Billy wanted to share it on his phone or something and didn't know that there are 3rd party software's to let u get those screenshots on ur phone so instead he used his phone bc without 3rd party ur very very very very limited on where u want to share ur Xbox captures
---
Funny enough this has happened for me with more than a few Kates.
---
*Swiggity Swooty*
---
Lmao I don't have xbox and wouldnt want to talk to you anyway. Plus if you're 25 which I highly doubt you've got a lot of growing up to do. Makes sense why you're looking for friends though ;)
---
Survivors think that a lot. Just because it has "A lot of uses" doesn't mean you're not being an ass. Sure, teabag at pallets or w/e. Just don't teabag at gates
---
I mean... killer can get gold gatekeeper with 5 gens completed.
---
Honestly
---
Im looking for little boy to play with and you are way too old so hop off
---
So should boosting (1 red/blue rank with a bunch of rank 10 and unders)
---
Haha ok there Jonny loud good luck finding even just one friend ;)
---
Who would be the killer?
---
Well, if you wanted Sam AND Dean in the game, it should be 2 chapters with 2 different killers. Or just have one of them be a dlc like Ash.

Not sure why you’re getting downvoted, but pretty much this.

If you think you’re good, play with no perks. You’ll find out that you need some work. Put perks back on after, you’ll play a lot more efficiently.
---
So youre praising yourself ? Not cool
---
OK but what's this got to do with me? This clip isn't even toxic.
---
Damn the entity was trying to take you away but pig said No I need to trap her head ! 💃🏻🐖.
---
Well the level 50 bloodwebs tend to be around 50k each if you're trying to keep them cheap, and the bloodwebs aren't quite as big at 24-35, so maybe 30k-40k each, so upwards of 400k probably.  If you try to get as much stuff possible on each bloodweb, you might end up well over 500k, but if taken cheaply I would guess in the 400kish range.
---
Jesus, this community is filled with a bunch of whiny milksops. Frankly, it’s quite entertaining watching a bunch of grown men throw a fit over a character crouching up &amp; down in a video game. You looked like you were having fun, so that’s all that matters. As long as you’re not telling kids to kill themselves in messages, do as you please. 
---
Good luck in the fog!😆
---
If you teabag at gates/hatch you're basically saying "Fuck you, I won and you lost." Any other point in the game though,  I find it fine  to teabag. You might not escape so it's not really rubbing it in the killer lost.
---
I think the loud killers should be placed above the object killers
---
Oh no, he didnt say he was the perfect Chad, guys we need to take him down and make him pay for his sins.

Yikes lmao reading this thread and replies from OP.... you have a shitty attitude, OP. Not a good look for advertising your stream.
---
Read the title and maybe think about it. With a flair like yours ik it must be hard but try. Also actually watch the clip, quote "I didn't know it worked like that" Myers is a common killer, even Freddy is
---
it's brown
---
So what if they teabag in the exit gate that's such a small thing to get pissed over just chase them out and move on to a new game
---
Then you’d get more tokens, meaning you recover from making hits faster. But it’d be more fun if you had Rancor as well, so you have no reason to go for the Obsession until late game, when you have been presumably taking out all the other survivors quickly.
---
Those messages get you banned on Xbox. I try not to message anyone anything other than GG. Happy to see a chill person in the community :)
---
Can you really blame bhvr for the toxicity of this community? Well i guess if theres problems with the game or if its unfair.
---
I was replying to what you said to AnthonyMiqo having said people watch you just because you're a female. People WILL watch your streams just because you're a female. It's true in every section. Why else would Jendenise get views if she's toxic? It's because she's a female.   Also toxic people will watch other toxic people because both of them will share similar views, such as dcing is fine  which is why some people will watch a few dbd streamers.
---
Still annoying because they'll spend almost the whole timer waiting for you to see them teabag at gate.
---
Wdym flashlight spam like flicker
---
Teabagging is seen more as a show off thing. At the exit gates it can mean 2 things. Thank you for a good game or fuck you your shite.
---
I don't teabag and I just leave the game at the exit gates. I play killer too and there's no points in extending the game when you could be queueing for a new game.
---
Again go to gate chase them out move on
---
I wish the entity had taken me earlier in that match ;(
---
T-bagging IS toxic. It's literally a representation of 'balls in your face.'
---
o ok. It looks kind of yellow in this pic
---
They forget Leather Face exists
---
I'm not on his face 🤔
---
Totally depends.
---
Teabagging once or twice to get my attention on purpose? Fine.
---
Playful teabag at the exit gate before leaving? Fine.
---
Teabagging at every pallet after you drop it like you’ve somehow done something that’s required a ton of skill and thought? Not a fan.
---
Teabagging at the exit gate nonstop and spinning in circles and refusing to leave until I walk forward and chase you out? I hate you.
---
I made a post expressing myself. Ur kind of contradicting yourself lol
---
3 of them are good the others kinda suck
---
I think it would be cool if leveling up your player level gave you small amounts of Auric Cells or at least Iridescent Shards.
---
just say you want survivors to spawn on hooks and then glaze over the actual toxic issues in the game.
---
Whether the survivor intends to be malicious or not maybe ppl should just chill and move on its not like the video game teabags are going to do anything to u if a survivor is teabagging at the gate I feel like ppl should just not care so much about it and move on
---
Thats the point of a grind, I get that youre upset, but you grind so that you can have a better chance when playing against a swf in the future.
---
Blink. Nurse is the slowest killer, you should float as little as possible.
---
I had a baby Jake follow me around earlier looking for heals with his bear trap at 1/2 done. He didn't make it
---
I P2’d mine and bought the devil mask.
---
 I understand why since lore-wise this GhostFace wants to stand out and all, but the hood stripes bug me.
---
Obviously? If anything all this hate made me want to actually tbag more. I mean eye opening about it this community. You're mostly killer mains and you're easily offended by teabagging with a little incel sprinkled on top. A lot of complaints about survivors and perks and cosmetics and pretty much everything. There's some sick art though, so there's that.
---
there is that trap in saw 5 i think, that shoots a metal bar to the head of the girl, who needs do walk in a hot air course and then use a circular saw blade to get the keys inside the guy.
---
I read it in a pirate voice for some reason
---
Yeah but anyway, she would be shit, I play nurse a lot and I can't even imagine playing without lunge on second blink, survivors would just wait for you to blink to do some sharp turn and you would miss them
---
This is just a lazy shitpost I made in half a second so don’t mind it.
---
Also I love the irony in the fact that you basically can’t see her in the picture 😂
---
Sorry for such a late reply. This meme is kinda like an extreme exaggeration of diferent players, especially noticeable on Thad, who is the absolute most perfect survivor there is (Gives fun to both roles) and the Inmersed Claudette, because not everyone is racist or can't hit even 1 skillcheck. Now, there is nothing wrong with using meta perks. I myself use the exact same Lad build xD. And about the Lag thing, it is making fun on the survivor wich always blames Lag, even with green ping simply because of slow vaults or mistakes they themselves did.
---
I see you keep complaining about flashlights... just use lightborn?
---
True 😂
---
It's because no one wants to take the time to learn how to play the game. Everything these days is about instant gratification instead of progression. Perks change the dynamics of the game but they don't mean an instant win for either side and they don't understand that aspect of gaming or in life.
---
Lmao you really came back to this? You're clearly a child I'm not mad at all you're the one name calling ;) I don't have an xbox which I've said but you're not bright enough to pick up on that. Ths isnt how you make friends dude I see why you're looking for some.
---
This hurts to look at
---
Same
---
Crossplay doesn't work in Shooter games and games like DBD. Controllers are slower than MKB so a lot of console killers would be steamrolled. It would only be good to cross platform XBOX and Playstation. It would also be harder to implement in this game because you have 3 seperate things players need to log into to play the game. Steam for PC, and whatever XBOX and Playstation has. You'd need to have a seperate login for DBD to SWF with someone who is on another platform. If crossplatform play did exist, you should have to enable it to make it be a choice if you want to play with PC (But only for XBOX and PS4)
---
Yah, I get that. If you check my page; the top video you’ll see is of THE REAL LAG.
---
Realistically the only way to curve survivor toxicity is make the game harder survivor side
---
The killer toxicity is far less at higher levels, but we have perks to counter tunneling and camping currently
---
Wow the comments here are some of the worst I've seen
---
If this is a rebuttal to what I said you must not have read the thread carefully.
---
His content is low effort, but the reason a lot of people don’t like him is that he is heavily right-winged. His content has repeatedly been racist and xenophobic, and nazis like him for a reason. 
---
Ironic racism is still racism.
---
Oh. That would’ve synergized super well with RM.
---
What you don't understand is it can be pretty tilting to new killers since they're basically being told "fuck you I won." That's what you don't understand. Stuff like that keeps players from playing killer since they feel like it would happen every game.
---
Get to R1 with spirit and then we'll talk.
---
Yeah, but how often does a killer hit you in a window? I'm a killer main and it doesn't happen much.
---
I’m surprised you were able to get it considering the amount of DCs that usually occur or other ways adept achievements get screwed over.
---
I agree but I assume they can't give away licensed characters because of contractual obligations.  So, something &gt; nothing.  Devotion is just meh right now so i figured buff it some
---
Are these add-ons useful at all? I have the equivalent to this on Legion and it seemed pretty worthless
---
#B R U H
---
Can still have a mute button like every other game with full voice comms.  Solves that particular issue anyway.
---
Was it made to avoid a previous ban?  Or perhaps the bot just bans any doubled ip address?
---
I mained Freddy,I did not want a rework...
---
Only people who wanted are people who think every killer should be like billy/nurse with tons of mobility and survivors who think he was broken cause of his sight skill..I kind of want my blood points and $10 back now.
---
If I'm not chasing someone I stay on my chase. If I'm not I go back. If I see the unhooked and their saviour I go for the saviour just because personally when I'm survivor I hate being saved and insta downed. However if I go back and only one the guy who was just hooked it sucks but down they go.
---
The game for surviors is to survive and for killers to kill it isn't any more complicated then that.
---
I know so many people have their own versions of what is toxic or game etiquette but ultimately its kill vs survive.
---
If you have fun being really try hard and get off staring at a hooked survivor or chasing only one person into the ground then you do you.
---
Personally I play to have fun and I just try not to do anything that would piss me off if I was on the other side of it.
---
The beauty of this game is every match can be so different just enjoy it.
---
Worst part however is no matter what you do someone will always have shit to say. Set your messages to friends only problem solved.
---
So I can get farmed or left to die on first hook by more potato Claudettes? No.
---
most of the times there are specific places on the map where the hatch spawns. killer shack is a common place where is spawns.
---
Summer is about 2 months longer they got time. However I also wouldn't be surprised with a delay.
---
Lmao he said the N-Word in a heated moment once then immediately apologized for it. Hardly a "Nazi"

Wtf was this
---
And Plague is also charging her Corrupt Vile
---
The only killers I can see it really working on is Myers and old Freddy because of his aura reading.
---
Myers in tier 3 with 16 meter radius is scary.
---
Sadly even under the full effect, the obsession dying and the effort it takes the build up is not worth it.
---
Yes, I know it happens in video games, but it can keep players from going killer because they're being told "Fuck you, I'm better because I won." What part do you not understand about what I'm saying?
---
Ok now I'm curious. What did you use for your build?
---
I’m really angry with goddamn Facebook simpletons using fucking emojis because they think it’s cool.
---
Yea i guess ur right it wont change a thing thro discussion.... i guess i was just so frustrated by those noobs killers ... 
---
I hope dbd developers do something abt it soon
---
Context?
---
Icons to differentiate which effect belongs to the according hex totem...A real time score count and pip progression bar on the ingame info screen...eliminate post game chat and replace with thumb up, thumb down, or meh button (still keeping the option to report cheating/abusing bugs)...
---

The rework was in no way a buff. The power is essentially useless in chases now, as it can't down survivors any more, plus the vaulting is much slower. After an initial feral frenzy hit Legion turns in to a standard M1 killer. If you know how to loop Legion is pretty terrible.
---
Surviving is toxic.
---
I think the following is still accurate:
---
To account share, with 2 PS4s, account A (needs to be primary on the PS4 that account B will use, and vice versa. This way they will always be able to use each other's content. The only issue is that both accounts always need an internet connection. 
---
Doing this actually means only one account needs to buy anything as the other account can always use it too, including PS Plus.

4 man SWF : reduce to 2 man SWF or give killer full access to add-ons or maybe show all survivors auras when killer is in chase with someone for X seconds with X cooldown. Just a few impossible solutions.
---
Tunneling : core part of game honestly, Survivors have DS which is basically a self BT. If they removed the obsession deboon which makes no sense it would be more common to use and would stop tunneling but encourage slugging.

was wondering the same thing

There will never be icons to show which totem is which hex. That would completely remove any chance of using Haunted Grounds successfully. However, having a counter to show how many totems have been done and which hexes have been cleared could be nice. And what is the ingame info screen? You mean the "pause" menu?
---
Yea, I hope the SB exploit never gets patched too. /s
---
Yeah I find farming really boring. I used to do it before they "fixed" the loading screen bugged because then it was nobodies fault. But if some stupid little cry baby dc's because I smacked them once then I still just kill the rest to move on to the next game as fast as possible and if they don't like it I tell them to go take it up with the cry baby who dc'd.

---
level fuck you bill perk  
---
make bill stop playing along and shoot the killer so many freaking time, and since the killer is immortal, he will have to suffer with no way to stop
---
Yeah. Especially if you do a TON of hooking, then the perk will not help much due to the fact that they're more likely to die on their next hook.
---
Companies do seem to like delays.
---
They do and it's just as toxic as the game. Be careful giving your opinion on there.

Tfw i used to play claudette but i o ly picked her because i used to be a newbie and stealth was my only way of making out alive (also empathy because it always told me where the killer is)
---
Throwing a game because a survivor looped you for a minute? Man that’s a bigger tantrum than Bubba.
---
it's the same question of why swfs with extremely different ranks and experience get the midground killers exist.
---
don't get me wrong, i'm a red rank killer, nothing surprises me. through a year and a half i'd get MLG survivors in full swfs of red ranks. it was and is devastating sometimes because getting crushed by a full team of people on voice comms where each can hit great skillchecks(therefore doesn't matter much if you have Ruin or not it can only save you like 10-20 seconds which is not even close to help with these people) and knows how to loop/mindgame is really unpleasant cause you're literally in the position of complete powerless. 
---
i'm also a red rank survivor and i often play solo and getting a camping and hard tunneling killer mostly(i'd say 70% of time if killer is Spirit/Nurse/Billy/Huntress/Hag or somewhat decent at the character they picked) resolves in 4k and team not getting over 10k bp each. because we as a team of randoms had no ability to control what other people do as efficiently as if we had voice comms. you can 100% feel the difference. this is where killers feel most power, i guess. though as a killer main i despise this because it's just not fun, i'd only camp and tunnel to punish for farming random teammates or hard bm/bug abuse/hacking. 
---
these are two main problems of the game. two main things that make people powerless and frustrated in the game. 
---
there need to be some serious changes applied, not some punishment, for both sides to not feel so frustrated and powerless. or better compensation for solo queue and killers who face over 2 people in swf. i don't even know what can be done to game mechanics to make it proper, really, since removing swf is not an option. maybe at least change matchmaking for swf and match premade teams with killers of the highest survivor rank? because i guarantee that facing over 2 people on voice comms is extremely frustrating for killers and most just start playing dirty cause, let's be real, playing completely fair for everyone to have fun is just impossible in this game. i play nice. when i chill with Spirit i don't use ruin or anything for gens apart from Thrilling Tremors. but even given the fact i down people in under 30 seconds 95% of time, hook them and leave immediately, the gens pop so fast i'm lucky to get 1 kill even though i legit outskilled every person in chase and just with the fact i didn't play dirty or with op perks/add-ons they've got to escape and i barely got Brutal Killer. of course next match i'll get Make Your Choice and Ruin/Pop Goes the Weasel plus some green or purple add-ons and make it impossible for people to do even 3 gens. 
---
past days i don't play as much cause every side is so fukin frustrating and unpleasant. feels like i'm not gonna play at least till Freddy rework is live. i don't like using clutch or crutch perks, i haven't used noed since Clown chapter(aka survivor nerf), i don't use Adrenaline and i only started using DS after its change. but my playstyle is really not rewarding. when i don't rank up, i end up amongst killers and survivors with much less experience and obviously not having fun cause there's no challenge. dilemma oof.

I had a pig that facecamps. 
---
Like right in my face.
---
Who the hell told you that?
---
Actually it sounds like you're reading a section of the ini that isn't even used and assuming the rest.
---
It is definitely not "locked to 720p"
---
Reminds me of that hilarious joke where he "accidentally" *wink wink* said a Gamer Word in a HEATED Gamer Moment while playing PUBG.
---
D’vorah got decimated by him!
---
You know what you're probably right. Just read what the killer was writing in the end game chat
---
It’s just the floor of the killer shack?????
---
Huh?
---
 So it is unlikely that you will be banished?
---
It depends on the rest of your team and the killer, if everyone is altruistic and helps each other then yeah more likely to win, but if you're the only one then its less likely because.you'll waste time saving people but they wont do it for you. 
---
Depends on the killer too, some.killers play around a hooked survivor, so if anyone tries to be altruistic they' get caught, some killers go far away from hooked survivors however and go to gens, so it's very situational
---
Its ok :v im sorry but i had to delete this post cuz there were some things i didnt thought about
---
It can depend on if your playing solo or SWF. Because whenever i get together with friends we end up surviving a bit more often than when i'm playing solo
---
It honestly looks like it
---
&gt; because.you'll waste time saving people but they wont do it for you.  
---
Jesus Christ you have no clue how many assholes I've had to play with like that in the game.
---
I agree, I always help everyone, no matter what, people dont usually help me though lmao
---
You telling my a large man In all black with a white face, and a big ass knife doesn't stand out?
---
Honestly people really overestimate Corrupt Purge. Like of course it's strong, but on a map with lots of LOS breakers or high walled loops the Plague can't use it particularly well (without Worship Tablet or something), and she's kinda forced to respect pallets or waste her power. I'd say make the cleanse decision based on the map.

It doesn’t, but if they pnly see the boxes they are most likely to visit them, thus patrolling them works better.
---
Well this adds to my already long list of why spine chill is one of the best perks for survivors
---
Sorry if its sarcasm but I get annoyed when someone acts like theyre better than someone whos pretty common in the game, hence, survivors who want to win.
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding, why wouldn't Killers activate this at every opportunity?
---
I see what you mean but that just sounds like an ideal game when in reality a killer should take advantage but good point
---
Dean
---
Didnt you heard about 50000 rules for killers in "Survivor rulebook for Killers"? How DARE you not respect them?!
---
Social Justice Warrior. Some use it as a badge of honor while others use it as an insult. I use it as the latter.
---
SJW's are people who are so knee deep in all the ism's that they'll foam at the mouth at anyone that so much as dares to think of an off color joke.
---
Ima stop myself before I bombard you with a whole bunch of jargon, but the tl;dr is like this
---
SJW's think Feels trump Reason and logic.
---
For instance. Your username is kinda funny, but if I ***FEEL*** offended by it, I'm justified in calling you a horrible person and demanding you change it.
---
Doesn't matter that it means nothing offensive or anything at all, if I ***FEEL*** offended, its your fault and you need to fix it.
---
Yes and no, kind of think of it like spirits power, if you use it in a chase then you can use I for map control and vice versa
---
So killers would have to decide when and if to use it
---
Also keep in mind my numbers are pure place holder, it would probs have a longer cooldown
---
I was wondering if I should put a Hag in Spirit Tier thanks to trap jumpscaring, but shes in lower tier because she doesnt looks as creepy as Spirit although shes still preety scary
---
These tier list posts are getting so old now.

I hooked someone in the basement of swamp, and it spawned on the top of the stairs on my way back up. I felt bad but it was convenient and easy points.

It only spawns on the lower level of The Game for example
---
1. If the Killer is ACTIVELY CHASING YOU why would you need to get their attention?
---
2. If you are at all active within this community, you know how annoying Killers find these things. If you do them in spite of this knowledge, you are being toxic.
---
This whole thread comes across like a white person telling black people what they can and can't find offensive.

Survivors rules for killer. Rule#473 if a survivor dcs prematurely the killer MUST let all the survivors escape and farm with them. Fuck those rules I'm not waiting till they get enough points so they can leave happy I just want to play another match
---
that's the problem with a lot of lower rank killers but didn't you say that these are rank 1's?
---
Yesterday I had a prety wholesome matcg as well. We were surviving in a four stack. Two of my friends got sacrificed and me and my other friend were downed next to each other, so we just started to spin in circles on the ground and we got a good laugh out of it as usual (we're all pretty new to the game so i wonder for how long that will still be amusing) and when the ghost face went back to us after hanging one of our friends, he was just staring at us and probably found it as amusing as we did, started to crouch and spin in circles as well, he picked my friend up to get them back in the wounded state and allowed us to heal each other and get all of the 4 remaining gens done and let each other get the max blood points you could get for destroying pallets and etc. After the match i sent him a friend request and played some more games with him together that night. It was nice to have a fun match after getting 3 matches in a row with killers that would camp you when they got you up on a hook :)
---
Just gen rush. Really, thats the best tactic. If killer camps survivor from the beggining to the end, then he near hook for 120 seconds. 2 goddamn minutes. At this time, other survivors (if their iq is higher than 10) should done at least 3 gens and be halfway on the other 2. This almost always guarantees that at least 2 survivors escape.
---
When would the appropriate opportunity be in using Borrowed Time? I've been avoiding using that perk because most times when I get unhooked with that applied to me, I still get chased until I get downed. Would its purpose serve for escaping basement? As for Killer, how would I deal with this? Any tips would be greatly appreciated!
---
There will always be salt
---
One time I got crossed maped by a huntress...that is terrifying
---
what
---
That's simply because every Autohave, Coldwind farm and McMilan estate has 5 variations, while other maps have at most 2. So there's much bigger chance you'll get one of the 5 variants of McMilan that The Game.   
---
I totally agree it sucks tho, I am sick of those 3 themes, they got so fcking boring to me
---
It's an exploit, they can use sprint burst whenever they feel like it.
---
There, their and they're 1o1
---
Tbagging is a sign of friendship :(
---
Yes, but same could be said of a Myers, or Billy, maybe even a Bubba in the same scenario
---
And with those killers there are options even without pallets, it just takes a slightly higher skill ceiling (stuff like 360, or forcing the killer to hit a way, also if a fellow survivor body blocks)
---
Is it against ToS or any other rule if I favorite one survivor over the others? The other day I noticed that I kept getting this one survivor down until she stopped and started pointing at them. It clicked to me that the other survivors were screwing her over in our chases - dropping pallets infront of her, blocking her, failing heals etc. - so me and her went on a rampage and killed everyone and I spared her. The other survivors flamed me and told me that as a killer I’m not allowed to target just them and that it breaks ToS. Is this bullshit?
---
I mean sure, but that hatchet hit the hooked guy so probably not.
---
Nice
---
Im a killer main, and im never toxic (tbag, facecamp, all that stuff) unless survivor is very toxic to me (flashlight clicking, tbagging at pallets and windows) then I tunnel him and facecamp. Yes, I know im gonna lose, and I know that im gonna get called a "bAbY IdIoT cAmPeR" but god, the satisfaction from killing and bullying this one fucking toxic survivor while all other peacefully escape, beatiful. (this is gonna get so downvoted lmao)
---
Another one applying real life logic to video games, seriously? Get in the bin.
---
"If you are at all active within this community, you know how annoying killers find these things" &lt; So what, I should stop having fun because somebody might get mad? Grow up, how bloody sensitive have gamers become? Here's a great idea: If you get mad over a video game, stop playing. I'm not here to preserve your precious little feelings.
---
I dont understand

I main killer and my last matches are only Virgin "Toxic Survivors", im so fucking triggered because of these little shitfucks. 
---
Also, Im suprised of how accurate this is.
---
The first one would just be a counter to toxic survivors. Perfect for a Racecar build.
---
Who buffed pig ? Why does she have a gun ???
---
I meant only the killer can see the totems. Info screen yeah, pause menu.
---
A lot of survivors mains are already complaining about "being nerfed at every patch". A lot are casual players and that would mean the death of them for most games.
---
I agree that killers should be stronger in general to stop survivors to be that cocky and laidback. But that won't happen, and if it did then the toxicity would switch to the killer side.
---
Happend now 3 times in a row help
---
It’s actually incredible how they managed to make LF a worse version of billy in every way possible
---
The saddest thing is that "Plays for fun" are almost extincted species, 90% of survivors I meet are Toxic Survivors

Lol. After every game is over all people do is call others toxic. I killed a guy the last day and boom..ur a toxic camper. I was MILES away from him after I hooked him and all 😂
---
Had a game like that once, two people dc’ed after I marked and downed them with ghostface, and the two who didn’t dc start complaining to me, one was chill and was fine with me just wanting to get to my next match after I told him, but the other went on a temper tantrum about how I’m toxic because I didn’t let him farm and how it’s more beneficial for my rank and points to farm with him , and when I told him to get mad at his cry baby teammates, he says “I already understand their reasoning for dc’ing” like it’s just cool for people to completely ruin matches and abuse a broken disconnecting system where you receive no meaningful punishment for disconnecting, some people are so stupid.
---
do gens, try to guarantee him only getting one kill. if not you could swarm him if he’s not a leatherface
---

---
Billy is pretty balanced. The only counter to a God Billy is the survivors being good and forcing him to M1.
---
Cool. How do you do these?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu7kVctkJ6Q (starts at 4:40) there's your proof
---
I played a game with one buddy and two randos on operating theater vs a wraith the other day. Our adh DCd as soon as we loaded in so the wraith let us farm, so we also let him farm. It was fun lining up to get hit just to heal each other and do it over again.made like 50k bp and got 3 iridescents (we let him hook us)
---
No. At all times. Since it’s easy to add someone to your friends and message them with the killer perks and add ons. It would be unfair for the killer if some one died early on and told the rest of the group they had blood warden or noed. So the rest of the survivors can plan around it.
---
First I drawn them on paper then I digitally color them! So glad you like them!!
---
Idunno about that.  
---
I Absolutely fucking hate looking at the plag.
---
Dang, I'd love to see a Dean by Daylight comic.
---
I love the drawings, but I also admire the love for Horror so much to actually use your own creativity for it. Thst to me is equally as cool as the drawings if not more so. 👍
---
Yeah I suppose, it's not a random thing then. Wasn't thinking about swf, just solo. So you'd be taking the chance with the offering
---
Wow haha good one, died from laughter

That sonic adventure 2 reference

Why would it be anything other than a gamer girl streamer with Spine Chill?

Something doesn’t add up here chief

Haha me too! With Me Monarch too!!

No prob. Not everyone is toxic on Reddit ha ha. I followed you to see more and how you develop this. I look forward to seeing it.
---
literally 2 and a half hours before you just without the blurred and black lines around the sides 😑
---
Wth is both of those things
---
I just don't get it. It's literally every other game someone dc's. I hate farming from a survivor side too. I'd rather just be killed and get it over with and move on to a match. Just wish the devs would do something about it.
---
I hope the SB exploit never goes away :)

To be honest, unless it's a scratched mirror myers he isn't gonna be in tier 1 for very long. Even a tombstone myers gets out of tier 1 pretty quick.
---
Let’s just waste that pallet
---
All of them would just kill those pesky toxic survivors. No entity means that when you die you die. No more ressurection. So once every single survivor is dead I think that all killers would go to the real world to get some more kills. They are KILLERS after all. That's what they do. Kill

I’m assuming he’s from facebook, halfwit

Do so at your own risk.

I, as well as several other people, have installed custom icons and not gotten banned for it. People have asked both EAC as well as BHVR and got pretty much the same answer from both. EAC said they won't ban you for it unless the moderators deem it a bannable offense, and BHVR said they won't manually ban people for it, but they're not willing to help if you get banned by EAC.  
---
So TL;DR: no, you won't get banned for custom icons, but be careful when editing game files.
---
The same shit goes for EVERY single Killer, it dosnt depend on the person playing the killer, it NURSE OR NOTHING, if you go with "useful" and "viable"  !
---
I trapped the hatch last night as hag. 1 or 2 people had DCd so I was going to let the David escape, but I wanted to be sure he saw me on the way out even if I didn't see him.
---
Really accurate, but why would dodging a chainsaw hit be toxic?
---
I've played most of my game time without Spine Chill, then i decided to actually see how useful it is and used it for a good while (like a month).
---
I'm now back to using other perks in it's place. It has it's uses but i can get the same information by being aware of my surroundings, i rarely get surprised by Myers/Pig/Ghost/Wraith because all of em are LOUD. 
---
The perk is quite nice to counter Spirit (although you can hear Spirit's footsteps when she's phasing) and Nurse. But vs Nurse you don't really need the info if you understand how Nurse is played (i'm a Nurse main so...).
---
*Entity releases legion with exposed effect on theirs frenzy.
---
No it doesn’t lmao, that’s not how skillcaps work. Killers like billy for example are really easy to pick up and get good as, the fact that GF can have his ability be useless if he isn’t good at stalking makes him much harder to use effectively, more experience is required to be good with him.
---
I love how you went full panic mode
---
I think is a PS4 bug 
---
I don’t think is a game breaking bug
---
It provides useful information but regardless 
---
The killer get loop easily
---
That one tuft of grass in lerys
---
I can have a long staring contest with Ghostface and still end up exposed. If that was fixed, I wouldn’t mind him so much. Haven’t bought him yet, so can’t speak from the killer perspective.
---
Imo, yes. Just stay out of the way while they're looping/in a chase
---
Billy can cross the map in .5 seconds and then go right back to the hook in another .5 seconds. His ability is always up and ready to go even though it’s the strongest thing in the game next to nurse. Billy’s just a better Myers in every way and he should have a cool down just like spirt has.
---
Hey Where's NoQueen?
---
Even those add-ons are balanced
---
Not to mention the nerf to mending where if you’re mending or in the killers terror radius it doesn’t even go down, making the one special thing about his ability really shitty, now he’s basically just m1 the first hit a little quicker then your ability is pointless
---
Billy has map pressure? This is news to me. Fuck he's so OP, you're right.
---
No one's saying he is a nazi himself, but it's absolutely undeniable that his racist jokrs and heated gamer moments in the past have attracted a lot of nazis to his fanbase.
---
I am survivor main tho, this is my first post so was lacking a title so added toxic
---
He can be anywhere on the map and still basically be the equivalent of hook camping, and he counters borrowed time due it it needed the terror radius. How about you make an argument about how he’s not OP instead of being a sarcastic cunt? Or do you have none?
---
I'm sure the road map said end of August
---
Not calling you a liar, but the Spirit could have been using Whispers. Also, survivors make noise whilst in lockers.
---
That is actually good. Please add these BHVR!
---
&gt;his fanbase isn't a majority of kids
---
(X)Doubt
---
The huntress was right on that one.
---
Try it, trust me.  Instead of reading it and calling me an idiot actually try doing it and see for yourself
---
Honestly when I was new to the game, for the first 2 weeks or so I didn't even know what the hatch was.
---
Shortly after learning what it was, I remember the first time a killer brought me to the hatch. She brought me, downed me so I was slugged on top of it. She just stood there. I had no idea that you could jump into the hatch while downed. I bled out and died on the hatch.
---
She was mega confused in the chat. But I thought she was taunting and trolling me by downing me in the hatch, as if to say "You want this hatch? Fuck you, you can bleed out and die on it."
---
Sometimes new baby players just don't know.
---
He prob talks about mobile version. There is AMA on reddit with one of mobile developers.
---
Negative. Whispers reveals a general area. Not a precise location to phase to
---
Always good to have a back up plan if one way to kill fails
---
The legions would escape surely, so does freddy and kruger, the spirit, i feel like too, so does the nurse, the pig too
---
The doctor, hauntress dont mind, they want to be there so they have victims to test their powers, so does ghostface
---
Literally just had someones head pop against a pig with the new skin

---
Wow, a hypocrite for laughing at a dated insult. I’ve seen it all
---
Ahhh it's the killer! No that's just Nea.
---
Billy is the balanced killer, he takes a lot of skill to use effectively against good survivors, he can be looped and he can mindgame with curving when you get good enough at it.  He can punish mistakes quick enough to keep up with how fast gens get done.  To top it off he can get across the map quick to start chases and apply pressure.
---
The most important thing to balance right now is maps, which are being worked on luckily.
---
Ok juust ignore his other problems I guess
---
Or flashlights. "Ah darnit, you're burning my eyes! Better drop this dead body and OH it lives again!"
---
She didn’t say anything in the endgame chat, she immediately disconnected. However, she messaged me via xbox message and started to harass because of how mad she was lol. I later removed our chat and blocked her at the end of the conversation.
---
Or hooks. "Ah let me just get ya off this hook. Oh great we're sprint bursting again. Almost as if my body didn't hang on a hook a few seconds ago!"
---
Dedicated servers will not fix this. If anything it'll make it worse.

Well that certainly ain't me, I would start endgame and then open a door, and then put him on the other side of the map after showing him the door opening, and then see how far he gets before dying.

Bullshit killer, to be honest

Billy does not stand a chance of getting a 4K if the survivors are good and coordinated. Even streamers like ZubatLEL have stopped streaming Billy as often because he knows the matches will he unenjoyable against the best survivors.

Show the rest of the conversation please

Well that's good to know

How come?

Another reason why I miss having Spine Chill on my Kate. Had to say goodbye when I prestige’s and I regret it so much 😭😭😭
---
And vaulting would be so hard while running,if you were trying to launch yourself through a square window at top speed like the game.
---
*Picks up dead survivors*
---
*Stabs again*
---
That argument can be made for every killer in the game, that doesn’t mean he’s not stronger than other killers. Some have easier time getting 4 kills than others. Billy’s easy as all shit to 4k compared to others. You’re basically saying a killer needs guaranteed 4ks to be considered unbalanced.

It's boring, no one at high ranks has fun playing immersed anymore

Lets be real here.
---
You play the game, you're toxic.
---
You play killer or survivor? 
---
Doesn't matter, you're toxic.
---
Hey you’re the one that started with being a sarcastic asshole, but IM the defensive one. Lets just forget about your problems huh? Very convenient for you. 
---
Maybe if you didn’t start off being a dickhead I wouldn’t be one too? Ever consider that? 
---
Ignore this because you know I’m right and you have nothing more to say. Next time don’t start off like a prick.
---
The way you worded it made it seem like you were saying he didn’t have good map pressure, but regardless keep on being condescending nonce if it makes you feel better pal 👍
---
6:22 begins the fun part, Just skip :)
---
Vincentvega is really awesome though
---
This is sick! If you're still bored and making these I'd love one but with Kate. The lighting is just so dope.
---
Could be. For me that wouldn’t make sense because I always wait for the healing animations to be gone before I move, whether I’m being healed or heal. But maybe some people are very impatient.

The fact that comment has 4 points as of now shows me that people understand I was joking. Not my fault you didn't pick up on it.

*Endgame collapse starts instantly with ten seconds left*

It makes them more helpless.

Still waiting on a fix for the times I've double pipped, gone back to the campfire and...
---
oh I didn't actually double pip. In fact that game never existed.
---
I see loads of people say it’s an amazing perk I just don’t think anyone really uses it
---
Man, anyone remember when spinechill was regarded as completely useless?
---
Its not even received any changes. What a sleeper.
---
Bug that should be fixed in the next patch
---
Right? :D so wholesome!
---
When they “mindgame” like this you can use a flashlight to blind them ;)
---
I prefer Premonition III.  It lets you know exactly where the killer is coming from (before there are audio cues if they are using anything that affects terror radius).
---
&gt; Playing to win/Playing fully optimized
---
I guess I don't understand why these have to be mutually exclusive. I will admit though, making killers RQ makes my day.
---
Sooo dont blame the guys actively abusing said exploit over and over again like the little cuntangels they are? Gotcha.
---
Yes. He expected me to go towards the window.
---
Bill and Ash together would just beat the ever loving hell out of any killer that tried to step up.
---
Poor example of how to play around Spirit though. Sitting behind the pallet, regardless of whether you think you'll stay there or stupidly vault at her, is a bad play 9 times out of 10. Leave the loop and force her to commit her power to going all the way around it, or force her to break the pallet. Standing there is just asking to take a hit, but not knowing which of 2 ways it's going to happen.
---
unlucky
---
...is that an iron cross on his collar?
---
Faker? I think you're the fake hedgehog around here! You're comparing yourself to me? Ha, you're not even good enough to be my fake!
---
If you finish a heal yourself you get 300 Survival points for Self-Healing.
---
They don't have to.  
---
But it's kinda related to the topic of this post where it differentiates between certain types.
---
&gt; Billy’s just a better Myers
---
lmfao what the actual fuck
---
That's pretty pathetic of you, ngl
---
I once died from a Myers that purposely never went to tier 1. Sombitch slaughtered us and we never heard him coming.
---
It was the hopping in the locker. Billy cant turn very well while using his saw but for the first second of his chainsaw run its like he has increased turn speed. So skilled billys can start a chainsaw early before a corner and when the chainsaw starts they can use the increased turn speed to turn 90 degrees while sawing and catch the survivor before they can round the next corner. Feng noticed what he was doing and barely in time hopped in the locker to avoid the saw because she knew she wasnt going to make it around the corner to the pallet.
---
I like my characters to look odd. Also I opted out of the skirt because of the hardcore rubberbanding of clothing that was going on at the time.
---
I dont wanna play with you anymore
---
Thanks!
---
Jesus that head fake.
---
This was r/f13thegame back in its heyday. Sometimes I check in and those same people are still there.
---
It's because the game punishes stealth play. Despite being one of the highest-skill playstyles, the game gives you fewer blood points and less progress towards pips for evading the killer.
---
The official one is hot shit, I'd recommend finding a different one
---
Huntress hatchets are balanced?
---
Yeah like lmao great mindgame standing still with no way of the survivor to know if you are using teleport or not
---
It’s a do at your own risk if EAC ever sees it someday maybe with a update or whatever and you do get banned the devs said they won’t unban you
---
I believe it doesn't go off when Michael's in Tier 1. After that it doesn't really matter because he's scary lol
---
Honestly the biggest thing keeping me from buying the game. 
---
Why would I play a game where the enemy team tells me to limit myself so they can win/have fun? Yeah, no thanks.
---
I like to combine different pieces to look as ridiculous as possible, just for shits and giggles.
---
I main meg (I started with her way back and p3d her when I reached rank 1 for the first time)  and I love some of the outfits on her just for that reason.
---
Killer or survivor
---
Both
---
Make sure we have long lasting flashlights
---
I’m bringing them
---
It was a joke on my side. :) I don't see the points of those downvotes either. You didn't insult anyone.
---
I use SC because my situational awareness might be alright but spotting a wraith, pig or ghostface can be extremely stressful if you're in the middle of a map.
---
Oh shit I didn’t even realize. I haven’t really used spine chill regularly since about the time Michael was released. So that is probably why.
---
So long as you carry a sharp piece of glass, it won't target you.
---
Private Ghost Face, make sure they get exposed!
---
Can I cite you in my dissertation titled "Leatherface is just a worse Myers?"
---
I like your steam ID
---
Dude it's just a circlejerk bad killers on this subreddit like to cry about holy shit
---
The best part being when you play killer and try to show them "Ay dude open the gate! C'mon! You can do it!" and you feel them getting it...
---
Oh lawd she comin.
---
I hated going for the achievement but it made me like the huntress as I improved
---
The Gloctor?
---
No not Doctor... Glig? No that's weird.
---
I like the gun is what I'm saying.
---
Same goes for surivor, but you get mor karma by trashing killers, like a toxic shit with stupid memes.
---
No
---
let this meme die already.
---
That's so..... innocent. :')
---
"Aaayyy let's just not press M1 to try it."
---
I imagine how the killer must've felt.

Honestly though
---
When you (random text involving gameplay) funny image that relates to dead by daylight, thank you for this original post

Yeah it says that his Evil Within 1 trumps all anti-stealth perks. Can't see his aura, no spine chill, no premonition.

Nah, my butt is to sensible for this crap ! I want to clean it after the work is done !
---
Staying in the same map as a Hooked survivor is now camping
---
That is true. It's something BrickyOrchid brings up in his video. That video is almost a year old and everything in that video is still true.
---
I enjoy playing stealthy and don't care about pips, but I also play Killer and know how infuriating it is to be unable to find Survivors. I feel the heavy punishment of stealth and excess of anti-stealth mechanics (Doctor, ~~pre-rework~~ Freddy, several anti-stealth perks that are added every patch) is meant to encourage "fun" chase gameplay for both sides. But this creates a lose/lose scenario as while the Killer is having more fun stealthy players aren't. And what's more is that Killers don't have fun when every Survivor runs chase perks and loops the Killer for minutes on end.
---
Stealth is a mechanic in the game and I feel it should be treated as such. And truthfully the mechanic is respected in all aspects other than ranking. You get no Bloodpoints (old ranking system) for playing stealthy say for a pitiful amount of Boldness if you hide in the Killer's Terror Radius, and now Emblems (new ranking system) give you barely any score for playing stealthy. But we have perks for Survivors to play stealthy (Iron Will, Calm Spirit, Urban Evasion, Spine Chill / Premonition...), and we have perks for Killers to counter stealth (Whispers, Spies from The Shadows, Barbeque, Rancor...) There are Killers who counter stealth like Doctor, just like how there are Killers that counter chases like Huntress, Nurse, and Clown. But almost every single new Killer is an anti-chase Killer (Ghostface instadowns to end chases fast and has pallet mindgames, Plague has a ranged attack, Legion vaults over pallets ~~tho TBH Legion is more "anti-stealth" than most~~, Spirit is Spirit etc.) and tier lists rank these anti-chase Killers above the rest due to the meta focus on looping.
---
Truthfully if you have trouble against stealthy players just run Whispers, the same way you'd run Brutal Strength if you have trouble in chases. The game is already built to effectively allow for stealth play, it's just that the game doesn't reward you for it.
---
Yum
---
lol nub
---
Holding M1 is the most toxic act of all.
---
😂😂 how true is that!
---
At which point the Spirit guesses you have spine chill (People usually make it tremendously obvious) and just turn away when in spirit walk the for mindgame. Such a fun killer
---
Only before hex:ruin was this a viable way to counter campers, where have you been the last 2 years?
---
That's Tapp
---
Oh lawd they aging.

Imagine reading it in Mr Torgue's voice.

TBH she's more of "The Wizard" stereotype than Claud. Claud is more of the tryhard.

Delete this meme it literally encourages brigading and breaking reddit tos.

"I've been escaping death for 65 years."

That's incredibly slow
---
Kate's hair changed with the age
---
That's not how it looks  when  I  first played this game: I pressed the commence match and I got into the lobby immediately, until a month ago it became into this matching shit. You mean that number of  survivor players has declined?
---
###
---
Lol maybe u just don’t have the glass to see them
---
I read somewhere that the spikes in Trapper’s shoulders and the contraptions on Doctor’s face are punishments from the Entity. So I think these two would escape if they have the chance.
---

Spinechill only gives 2/4/6%, and doesn't affect vaulting anymore.

They are unbalanced?

Oh finally! We got our Halloween H40 Laurie cosmetic!

"how dare you tunnel me and camp me, how dare you play the killer how you want to play, disgusting!"
---
Her hatchets are balanced. Requiriing good aim. And they can still be juked.
---
Iridescent Head however, is a different issue entirely.
---
You also probably spawned on the other side of the map you toxic fuck
---
This is the sole reason I use monitor and abuse on myers, I love grabbing the first survivor off of a gen.
---
Welcome to the game, enjoy your complimentary hook.
---
Everyone has that one killer they hate to go up against for whatever reason lol
---
For my girlfriend, its Pig. She hates her traps and ambush. And for me, its Doctor. I hate that I can't be stealthy when the bastard is around.
---
Every killer has a weakness though. Just have to learn them and figure it out. Maybe play as Spirit a few times and see your outcome being on the opposite end of things.
---
Megabytes not megabits that’s normal speeds man
---
Mematic is the circus
---
Actually I  don't exactly calculate how long it will cost every time, anyway it's boring and outrageous.
---
Ha! Your sense of humor isnt my own!
---
I’ve had it happen a few times. I think the survivor desynchs from where the killer sees them, and their model ends up running against a wall or something. Because the killer is host, downing the survivor on their screen is what counts.
---
I actually noticed the desynch happen one time when playing killer, a survivor that I was chasing on the Game just suddenly veered off the path and started running into a wall. I smacked him once and the animation of running got faster, but he still wasn’t actually moving anywhere. I confirmed with him after the match that he had still been running away on his screen and hadn’t actually been running into a wall.
---
If we get Billy mains they might be able to get in fast.
---
Half useless
---
It’s cool, but I don’t know who he’s talking about :(
---
You know that bodyblocking for an extended period of time is a bannable offense, right?
---
What is the list? I have never used it
---
2000 hatchets thrown
---
Yes it is, especially since there are different characters meaning different play style and perks, you might get tired of the same thing happening but in the end you will come back to play it, so I do think you should buy it
---
That’s megabits not megabytes they’re different units 7MB/s is a good speed which translates to 56Mb/s
---
Most of the helmet debuffs you listed can be achieved through addons
---
You’re wrong, 1 megabyte is 8 megabits google it.
---
I forgot to mention that he had instasaw incase nobody could tell.
---
I have 55 megabit download and 20 megabit upload, how is that slow?
---
Ye like 50% guess what a great mindgame lmfao
---
He would be better off buying the game and leaving this subreddit if he cares that much about what survivors think of him.
---
Those would all be broken
---
Is this post pure sarcasm, or is it actual salt?😅
---
they need to make an area 51 map and have alien as a killer
---
Guess you didn’t play a year or so ago. Lol. Bloodlust didn’t exist, vacuum pallets, 2 pallet jungle gyms, even more infinite loops than there are now, etc...survivor was easy as taking a piss.
---
Take a fucking walk
---
Almost impossible tbh.
---
already in there
---
it’s for the killer
---
Try to use her with no add ons like good Nurse players do. So fun and gratifying
---

---
I have a hard time believing you are rank 1 my dude. No offense but the things you say just don’t add up. 
---
Rarely will you see a rank 1 killer camp.  It’s too hard to pip by camping. If you camp, a decent group of survivors will smash the generators and teabag you at the exit. That’s just how it is at those ranks. I say this again, a good group of survivors will annihilate a camping killer. Period.
---
Skilled huntress is the only trophy for the game I don't have, and I barely have any motivation to do it. 100 hatchet downs at over 24 metres is ridiculous.
---
As a PS4 killer I want it gone too. I dont want to cheat but its so hard to just blatently ignore the knowledge that yep from across the map I know he's there. I also feel like its artificially boosting my rank because of this sixth sense which doesnt feel right. I feel dirty as a killer right now.
---
and quentin too
---
Hard to say. I feel like this is too much effort for someone who's salty though :p
---
and the worst of all is that i dontonly want to chill, but i want to have a chance at killing more than one person before all the gens get done
---
The numbers aren’t fixed, and it would obviously need to be tested to find a number that’s balanced. But the idea of these perks is to reward survivors that can hold their own against the killer, and the last one doesn’t directly help the survivor that has been downed, only indirectly. High risk, high reward, in order to get value, you need to be going after the killer and putting yourself in danger.
---
Only Rule I can think of is Have Fun lmao. Salt or shit I have no idea but people making up rules in any game is funny to me. I follow the rules of the makers of the game, not the players.
---
Use iri head and BBQ, Bitter Murmur, and whatever else you want. Had to play like 50 games in a row to do it
---
Janes skirt and high boots
---
She is thicc
---
Fun is subjective, for some players immersed playstyle is fun, for you it's boring. The thing is people who enjoy stealth playstyle are shitted everytime, even if they do 4 gens while everyone else is clicking flashlight at killer and insta dying.  
---
I like to mix things up, for me chases are fun but so is hiding.  
---
All in all, it's only a game so let people enjoy it.
---
Bond AND self care? Why?
---
Yes. PC is the best community. You will have more role playing killers than try hards.
---
Thicc Gilf Jane still clapping ?
---
But instead of being immersed, know how to outplay the killer in chases
---
Rule 9 is my favourite, but I’d like to amend it to include - The killer must allow themselves to be surrounded by all survivors during their thinking period and must submit to extended teabagging to prove their inferiority.
---
idk maybe the shooter knew it would hurt his name by doing so
---
&gt;offend his majorly racist/xenophobic audience
---
why are you saying that what makes you think that the pewdiepie fanbase is racist or xenophobic that literally came out of nowhere
---
&gt;but has no remorse insulting the other side
---
tell me the thing that you are referring to and ill break it dow for you to show you that you just unlocked the clown outfit by commenting this
---
You looped for over 30 seconds... no gems done
---
I saw a major bug last night against a Legion in the collapse. 
---
I caught video but my Xbox isn't cooperating so I can pull the video to post. 
---
Legion caught a survivor towards the end of the collapse. Somehow instead of the entity removing the survivor from Legion's grasp, she glitched. Every time Legion RT, The survivor would rise and fall as if being picked up and dropped by Legion. 
---
We could also hear the hatch nearby however Legion caused the collapse by closing hatch and no one had a key to re-open. 
---
So Legion spent the next 10 min swinging its weapon all over the area just to play this glitch/exploit. 
---
The game ended when eventually the killer DC'd game and the survivor was marked as escaped. 
---
Ill try to post a vid but, like I said, I'm at work and having issues with my Xbox functions so it coukd be much later tonight.
---
1. His fan base isn't a majority of kids his viewers are between the ages of 15 to 24

5. Wrong or not it was still a joke he is not and does not support Nazis He's not a bad person he just made a mistake or two.
---
6. He still apologized about everything he did sincerely
---
Because the rules are bull
---
The fade away middle finger. Amazing.
---
Exactly! It's not fair, you get wayy more information with it, It's like running a permanent discordance that activates if a survivor is on the generator. You can't just not go, knowing that a survivor is on the gen, but you can't just let them get fucked over a by a bug, and it's a problem. Sprint Burst is also broken, but the thing about glitches is if one glitch is helping people have power, if the other side also has it, remove them both at the same time. OP is the type of person that complains about the Sprint Burst Exploit, and then is bragging about winning because of a glitch.
---
I've never thought of it as useless. It gives you great information if you get used to using it and knowing what's a false-positive flicker vs. a true positive highlight.
---
I agree. It feels more true to the spirit of the Saw franchise.
---
Most people lie about their age on youtube to circumvent the age restriction, who would've thought.

And Myers is still tunneling her after all this time

---
Nurse needs just addons rework, they are way too powerful
---
He woouldn't be able to do anything. There's be too many for him not to get revealed lietrally every second
---
Don’t feel bad I can’t 360 well either but I made it to rank 9 I won’t say it’s not a necessity its just an easier way to get the killer distracted and probably have them just leave you alone
---
Petition to have the chase music replaced with Pursuit - Cornered when?
---
Tbh I just want Anna or Amanda to murder me. Preferably sensually.
---
Thanks :) glad Im not alone in this I rather focus on learning other stuff than doing those 360 that to me actually dont do much.
---
I don't know if it isn't Doctor who needs help the most at the moment. Maybe it's because I love Doctor's deisgn, he looks scary, he has evil laugh etc, but... he sucks ass
---
David King looks like Popeye
---
How the fuck didnt she heard u
---
You have downloaded an icon pack
---
You shouldn't feel bad about it, if that's how she handled it she deserved it anyways.
---
Facecamping is the easiest strategy in the game to counter. Do GENS. In the time it takes for them to die from first hook, several gens can be done. And survivors ALWAYS teabag and quite often swarm hook and then complain about killer perks. And I'm a survivor main. I'm just being real.
---
For the first one I would bring down the chase time to something like 60/45/30 and lose chase for 10 seconds without getting hit getting hit would reset the 60/45/30 timer and after losing him for 10 seconds instead of 30/25/20 I'd propose a just a flat 10 or 15 seconds straight killer aura and take out the dying reset bit. This allows the survivor a chance to know where he is and go the oposite way before it ends and wont give high lvl players the chance to abuse it because in the current form it would never go away if the survivor just hid the whole time feeding killer position info to his friends.
---
For the second one Id say that, instead of vault speed increase, every 30/25/20 seconds of chase you gain 1 token and you spend the token when vaulting allowing you to do a fast vault even from a bad angle. You would gain the 2% speed increase from the tokens but you would lose all the speed increase upon vaulting.
---
For the third I wouldnt say aura blindness when he picks up but when he hooks and only for 5/10/15 seconds. Killers rely a lot on auras and being blind to them can be absolutely detrimental even the 5 seconds counters BBQ but an entire 40 seconds can have an entire generator go by without any way to for the killer to effeciently defend his position.
---
So not bad perks but your times as you said would require testing and I personally feel like they should be shorter. Against a good killer an 80 second chase is a strech for the average player a very good player could do it but the game cant be centered around the players that are ultra in tune with the game. You got Bad/Good/Great players you build a perk for the good  players that has purpose and isnt a fluff perk and then think of how a great player could abuse it and design limiters to the perk that dont take away from the perks purpose.
---
mom pick me up im scared
---
I actually disagree. The characters in-game have infinite stamina, which is incredible let alone when you're fearing for your life. There is adrenaline but I do not see adrenaline lasting long enough in real life without the person just straight up shaking so bad from fear they would be borderline useless. Back to the looping though, the killer is straight up faster in every horror movie, including this game. You jump to higher ground? Slashes your leg. Jump through a window? So can he...legion style.
---
Also, repairing a generator? Yea, that shit ain't happening. I would be too scared to even touch it in fear of creating too much noise. I would seriously be the blendette urban evading across the map the entire time.
---
Aren’t there any trees or something?
---
For those asking, Bill is in a casket somewhere, Tapp didn’t get recognized as a human being (Don’t ask me why) and Ash was too busy killing demons so he unfortunately missed the photoshoot.
---
Rest in peace to my man Bill though.
---
Thats what we did, but if the survivor suicides which is reasonable considering no one wants to deal with that shit then it's not easy to counter at all. Plus there's basically no counter for the person on the hook.
---
You can see on her hair when she is phasing (you see it clearly on her basic hair) but if she has some other hair customization it’s harder to tell
---
The entity is proud of you, well done fren
---
I am not sure how many trees are needed to shield Danny boy from 400 000+ people
---
Trust me once you find what you’re good at in this game and find perks you like 360’s won’t matter much to you Hell I main Feng Min for a living Skill checks are easy for me sometimes I hit skill checks that I can’t believe I hit 🤣
---
Seems to me like you're the one bringing toxicity.
---
yeah it’s satire you fucking cabbage head
---
satire
---
Y’all ever lose the killer mid-loop and you think to yourself “welp time to die I guess”
---
You are correct. Can't beat Myers 1 :P
---
As a fellow wraith main who knows how it feels to go up against those players, I am proud of you. That was the right thing to do.
---
Well
---
I haven’t thought about that.
---
What about Frank, Julie, Susie, and Joey?
---
That spreads from survivor toxicity. Killing yourself on hook unless the other survivor found hatch is toxic cause you hurt the team. Tough
---
Yea and it's fucking killing me when I wanna play killer
---
Every. Damn. Time.
---
Well I don't use the P3 outfit, and thankfully I got Distortion in my build, so it'll probably be okay!
---
Every once and a while I'll just show survivors I'm friendly and follow them while they do gens and shit. it's good seeing them tea bag in a friendly way and sometimes one or two of them will EGC for me
---
as a spirit main I honestly don’t even know how to counter play her... she’s crazy
---
Playing with fire to hide in lockers against Huntress.
---
yeah, I don't want a nazi advertising the game
---
I feel your pain. I'm in no way a great survivor (I too am a killer main) but I'm good enough to know I'd at least get to purple ranks as a solo survivor, which isn't saying much because 99% of the red rank survivors are SWF and I know I'd easily get there by simply having competent teammates. Anyways, what I hate about low ranks, and this is just about every match, the people getting hooked always try to jump off so they end up in struggle state right away making them dead on next hook as opposed to the team getting at least one or two gens done. There's always one player hiding in lockers until crows come around. They can't hit a skill check to save their life, they miss it, they take off immediately. They won't go in for a save when someone else is being chased, instead they crouch around, hiding, opposite side of the map. They won't complete a single gen when I have the killer chasing me for literally 5 minutes. Killers always tunnel/camp hooks. 
---
You have to take things into your own hands, killers camp and tunnel, I bring in the following perks  Borrowed Time because most times it's a camping killer, make a safe unhook, I bring in Deliverance (because these low ranks aren't going to save you before struggle state if at all). DS for when you inevitability get tunneled. And Adrenaline, I know it's a crutch perk, but I don't trust anyone else healing me and I can't tell you how many times I've 99% a gen, and popped it just before the killer can hit me and I'm gone. Just get creative with your perk choices, instead of borrowed time and adrenaline you can bring in dance with me and lithe or iron will. Low rank killers won't find you when the scratch marks are gone. Sorry for the wall of text, but I experience this every day. I don't want to play survivor because it's more frustrating to me than going against SWF 99% of the time in Red Rank.

Can’t believe those tanks I’m so fucking pissed I’m gonna kill a tank rn

everyone who lies about their age goes 18 or 19 but its shown that a lot of 16 year olds follow him and idk why you would put in there 16 instead of 18 and the people that lie about their age made pewds have a loy of followers that were 60+ so i think that those are the ones that lied about their age
---
Contrary to what most people think, good survivors don’t 360 period. 360s are mainly used as a Hail Mary when you mess up your routing or to mess with bad killers. Honestly I would avoid learning it at all, just docs on pallet efficiency and window looping.
---
Faker? I think your the fake hedgehog around here
---
Ash at age 100
---
ace didn’t really change except for gray beard and invisible wrinkles
---
Always be near something vaultable. Then his chainsaw becomes useless. If you are caught in a deadzone your best bet is trying to run circles around a tree or whatever else there is (rocks, tires).
---
For low rank bubbas that might work and they'll bump into stuff. Higher ranked bubbas can navigate around those though.
---
&gt;accidentally
---
why you use these"", he actually said it accidentaly
---
Honestly the game needs more steps, gens are too easy, hell survivor as a whole is and that makes it boring and killer frustrating at times. There are exceptions,  but  that is the typical.
---
Hell I'm okay with the 2k average balance stuff, just make the game last long than 5 minutes without ruin, or give me another good slowing perk so I don't need to run ruin every game
---
Are you seriously crying about tombstone myers? That shit is garbage
---
I have no idea what you're saying, but it sounds like bait.
---
I'll make you eat those words!
---
It takes long to find games and when I do, it's usually bad ping (survivor)
---
By design there is no indicator for phasing.
---
this is the only comment that says the actual reason of why this idea was shit
---
 Tommy; Miss Strode hasn’t been the same since we found her in the forest.
---
Granny Strode: CAMPERS!! TUNNELERS!!! TOXIC KILLERS EVERYWHERE!!!
---
Does that make perk icons black and round in the bloodweb? Never had it happen before
---
The Cannibal has two really big weaknesses: Windows and Jagged Terrain. 
---
Bubba will only ever hit you through a window if you don't get a fast vault and he's right on top of you. Windows will force him to use his regular attack which will give you a speed burst to get to the next window area.
---
Jagged terrain is the best I can describe obstacles that aren't easy to move around. Autohaven maps have lots of debris that have strange proportions. If LF bumps into anything while chainsawing, he gets a 5 second stun. Unless you're playing against a 1000-hour Bubba main, most will avoid using their saws around these areas or they'll take the turns super wide to avoid bumping into anything.
---
When you're at a pallet, try not to throw it down if you think he will charge his chainsaw preemptively. If you run through a pallet and he tries to saw it, he loses a ton of speed. Knowing when to drop a pallet and when to fake it comes down to reading your opponent and learning their habits. 
---
Never hide in corners where LF can block you in. 
---
Never go for hook saves if he's facecamping or within saw range. 
---
Find out where the basement is in the map, and avoid that area like the plague. 
---
If you're in an open area and he starts revving his chainsaw, your best bet is to find the nearest tree/box/barrel or any obstacle and weave in and around them. Leatherface might bump into an obstacle or play it too safely and lose distance on you.
---
If you go against a facecamping cannibal, there really isn't much you can do. You can trade your life for the other survivor's with Borrowed Time. If you just power through gens then the camper will only get 2 kills at most on average.
---
I hope this helped. A lot of this stuff I know just from playing LF at rank 1 a bunch. Let me know if there's anything you need clarified or if you have any questions!
---
Rip, all that love for a perk when the tragedy is that they removed the vault speed boost
---
It breaks ToS? Terms of Service? Are they high? I had a guy in a game yesterday lead the Legion straight in to us, DC, and the killer hit us all with deep wound and proceeded to take us all down since we couldn't break away enough. At the start of the game. 
---
I had another game where I was killer and i got invited to party by a SWF pair. I normally don't because of what those chats could be but I joined the party. These two were upset at the Detective Tapp player and apparently he was the reason I got their friend mokents before. He blew skill checks and pallets, ran around the create scratch marks, everything I needed I hunt while he hid. They seemed legit upset at his play and wanted me to punish him and make sure he was foubd and didn't escape. I went on a very short chase and caught him in the window, hooked him, and let the last guy go by opening the door. 
---
Half the games in Friday the 13th play toxic like that too. 
---
You're the killer. You have map control. So long as you're not playing toxic, you run that trail however you want. Let them escape. Farm with them or off them. Whatever. They just sound like game spoiling trolls who were upset that you "listened" to her and gave her the escape.
---
Hes one of the weaker killers so in time you will probably be fine against him but just try to use palettes and windows, his chainsaw becomes useless when you do.
---
K
---
A YouTuber that posts DBD tutorials on everything basic to advanced
---
But as a response to them greiving that player?
---
Usually it takes around 3-5 minutes for me. Right now tho, it's taking forever
---
Definitely. The game has a roadmap of updates and isn't gonna die anytime soon. New characters(killers or survivors) are added on a consistent basis and it is very grindy(which is good because it adds to the longevity, just trying to prestige anybody 3 times gets you a lot of hours).
---
All killers are required to have an absolutely perfect 10 gigabit connection at all times
---
Honestly I really don't see it outside of videos, but it does happen to people.
---
My main reason for this idea was I dislike how current Bloodlust works as it wastes time, and feel implementing a Sprint would be better for killers in and out of a chase
---
Should have edited in the [Superman Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9vrfEoc8_g). Regardless amazing play.
---
Deserved it for being a toxic little brainlet ngl
---
Even without that, it's typically obvious from how they move and act when they loop. The high rankers will always have their character appear to be leaning against an object, and won't move in response to mindgames, while the newer ones will stand up straight while running and will usually keep running after throwing a pallet.
---
I do this at the exit gates when they run to open it and wonder why they can’t it’s funny as hell
---
Actually yeah I think it's a combo of those two outfits. Which is cool
---
Mirror would be even more dogshit if it did though.
---
No way I am getting Adept Nurse unless I purposely downrank to rank 20 and murder baby Dwights.
---
So the killer gets stuck and decides not to ruin the game by leaving and you stand there and fuck around? Smh
---
She let you leave
---
If shit my pants more than once due to a Myers jumpscare
---
What am i supposed to be looking at?
---
Karma is pointless and /s kills the joke so it’s fine
---
Most annoying killer. Can’t stand the humming. I usually disconnect. Sue me.
---
It was Jigsaw Piece, Iridescent Head and Infantry Belt for me.
---
Must have been hell as a survivor lol.
---
Played against a guy the other day who got real upset at me for opening the locker he was in when he was the last guy alive. You can guess who I was playing as.
---
Honestly just goin by his subreddit and the way the majority of his fans act.
---
I feel like Michael would leave, he doesn't like being controlled and really just want people to STAY dead, which they don't. 
---
Michael would probably just leave and hide until next halloween where he'd go put a knife in Laurie's normal teenager face. And also, let's be honest, Laurie would leave for sure, why wouldn't you?
---
Yes, except killers adapt and it’s very easy to use this “safe” presumption against survivors by making them think you’re circling around when you’re not
---
I think it's just 20 now. At least on Xbox.
---
Spine Chill has a shorter range than the Ghostface’s stalking ability. (30-35 meters compared to the stalks 60 meter I believe).
---
It still works super well tho if Ghostface doesn’t have line of sight and doesn’t know exactly where you are. It has saved me a few times before.
---
Don’t call me a cabbage head you fucking mong head cunt
---
No really
---
I just got Spirit the other day. I’m trying to learn her but it’s a bit of a struggle cause I suck at mind-gaming.
---
Agreed, but its so funny that I cannot stop laughing while doing it
---
Adam looks like bill Cosby
---
Shitpost.
---
Well rewarding perk. Never heard of a timed aura with a distance requirement
---
You are a professional retard the moment you put noed on Myers lmao
---
So this is what captain falcon meant when he said "show me your moves."
---
Mario would like to have a word with you. 
---
"Depiped"
---
I got one GG EZ haha.
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted when some of the saltier players I know essentially admit this is the reason.
---
I literally never face camped so I don't think that's true.
---
Garbage. Just find the hatch bro, if you are used to the spawns, it shouldn't be hard.
---
It does actually
---
Right in front of you while you are moving away 😂😂 and then you are a toxic camper questions hate mail..ya cudnt make it up!
---
Yeh dude, I wasn't too sure whether I wanted one or the other, so I put both lol, I'm open to any improvment suggestions tho bro
---
That's usually when I just leave and report.
---
I let the last survivor have hatch, few hours later I'm the last person down and Killer invited me to party chat and it was the same guy. He told me we going to find the hatch.
---
Lol, It was just a concept, thanks for the feedback but you ain't gotta be so blunt tho
---
It’s pretty rare but so satisfying when the basement camped survivor has kindred
---
That's a good one.
---
Could you escape?
---
The brown cosmetics have already been nerfed.
---
you can do this with literally any two killers you fucking 4head lmfao
---
Can you do this to my ex 🤣
---
low quality bait
---
Quentin looks horrifying.
---
Not really reportable.
---
It’s such an overdone meme that at this point every Bubba I see I expect it from. As a solo survivor who has had it done to myself many times and has witnessed it done to others, 99% of the time it just causes the survivors to immediately suicide on the hook. If that’s the type of gameplay that makes you happy and causes hysterics for you then by all means, go ahead.
---
Sorry, I was a bit of a dick, I agree.
---
As a Tapp main, I am pretty stupid in chases
---
After that much of a prerequisite requirement, I'd say no timer on the hatch aura reveal. Just gotta be close.
---
I picked them up under the pallet. The pallet was dropped on me after I completed the animation.
---
Not bait, I literally burst out laughing early today while I got survivors trying to unhook the the guy hooked in the basement while fully stealth
---
Couldn't tell you for sure, but they dropped it on me after I had completed the pick up animation.
---
Its good bro
---
Scratch  and blood marks  show litterally  where you went. When people sprint off a gen an I see the marks I know which direction  they went to hide. Giving me time to damage the gen then pursue the marks are a big part of locating survivors
---
I did and he doesn't care, he thinks he won't get banned because his reason being "remember legion's bug (the infinite mending) it took them weeks to fix, have fun reporting me it won't do much
---
Tunneling isn’t a reportable offense. 
---
Targeting is, and that’s not targeting.
---
Well 1. You could look at it as a light beam going into the sky which is cool I guess. 
---
Or 2. You could look at it as your character is holding a fucking lightsaber!
---
Just downvote and move on.
---
There’s the addon for the map to create this beams, it a marker
---
And killers complain about survivors bm’ing at exit gates when y’all out here doing this lmao
---
What consequences are there for playing alone besides not having good communication?
---
Also 3 ways out for survivors  isn't already catering to the survivors? Its 1 killer and 3 exits far from each other.  You do not need a hatch
---
Wrong. Farming is not against the rules. Farming while tunneling the non farmer is.
---
During 4 mins you can only do about 6\~k points from doing gens. All you have to do as killer is to go afk in corner so they can't start any different emblem.
---
Speak for yourself I’ll stay in tier one for atleast 2-3 gens just for jump scares
---
I hope you weren’t posting this to gain approval for being an asshole. 
---
You don’t even deserve a happy cake day.
---
Tunneling is NOT a reportable offense, the devs have stated this on multiple occasions. Do us all a favor and get your head out of your ass.
---
Been free.
---
Have a downvote as well
---
So farming me and not killing the others because I didn't want to participate in farming with him is playing the game? Hooking me is one thing, but only focusing on me throughout the entire game just to get me out of the game and farm is another
---
But whats that marker for? Is the killer hiding his secret -hentai- collection there!!???
---
Why would they sprint off the gens if there's no heartbeat? They'll have no idea the killer is even there.
---
It would help stealth killers by you never feeling the chill when the approached ever. It would force survivors  to listen in to the game more
---
The killer is done fricked now
---
I would imagine it could, especially if that particular icon was missing or corrupted
---
Mom is at it’s best a bad perk design. 
---
There seems to not be a middle ground it’s either very OP or very bad/hard to get.
---
Where tf do you mention 3 exits?
---
For another survivor to mark something, ex: the gen he is working or almost done
---
No it could be placed anywhere
---
Facing swf with 3 reds and 1 rank 20 while you're green. 
---
The game is weighed slightly in favour of killers in terms of having 4 randoms against a killer, but 4 swf have a significantly increased chance of winning
---
Did the pallet break? I always thought it was intentiknal on those.
---
I say just allow it to handle 1 instant down then it would be sorta worth the trouble of getting. Or just change the perk entirely cause of right now it’s worthless
---
Or maybe he wants to continue his farming without somebody trying to end the game and ruin his goal. 
---
You wanted him to play the game properly, so he plays the game, and you get mad when you die. 
---
Hmm.
---
It has always been free.
---
But there is no escape.
---
Protection hits is fine to me
---
Yes. The pallet broke on me.
---
Not a fan of these bait posts.
---
Says the person in the locker...
---
you typed /s anyway?
---
Against a good spirit, you literally can’t. She’s like nurse in a way.
---
It’s stupid.
---
You know how survivors purposely vault and use pallets to create attention before they head off towards the hatch? The beam is another use to trigger the killer
---
k
---
Spine chill still activates before his terror radius.
---
Good nurse players don’t use addons because they make her harder to play by changing your muscle memory.
---
For spirit, there’s no real reason to not use addons unless you just want the extra challenge.
---
No wonder the other guy DCed.
---
You talk as if good communication isn't arguably the most powerful thing in the game.
---
*Implying Mathieu doesn't control the Entity*
---
That’s a god tier video holy shit. Thanks again
---
Yeah but at T2 you have the reduced terror radius and you’re already at max walk speed
---
Pretty decent idea.
---
It’s fine how it is, being able to tank another hit is so damn strong, there’s a reason it was nerfed, at its core it’s a shitty perk design
---
I don't understand the 'intensity of the survivors aura' part... Need help asap
---
Killer can’t see the beam though
---
It’s fine in my opinion
---
I don't care if I get tunneled you can't get banned for that, farming with survivors and teamming is bannable
---
Such as what? I ain’t disagreeing just curious
---
No it's not lol I know your favourite streamer told you sniffing corners takes a lot of skill but I guarantee you that learning how to kite a killer efficiently and long enough for your teammates to do their objective takes more time to learn and is harder to pull off
---
Maybe you should play a bit more with other killers to learn the basics and then go back to huntress, her humming makes it really easy to notice her coming
---
There are these types of people in every game. They just need to stop playing multiplayer and play solo campaigns. They cannot accept the fact that there is someone on the other team trying to win just like they are and there’s not a chance they’d give props to someone who outplayed them. Lmao but let’s be real this isn’t most survivors. Most players in general seem chill it’s just the outspoken idiots who ree about.
---
A pig killer let me boop their snoot :)
---
The perk doesn’t do anything for the game until the last few minutes. It doesn’t help you reach end game and there’s a big chance you won’t even get to use it (dying/someone else opening door)
---
Unless this is a joke?
---
Yeah. Also how would you go about buffing no mother? I think you should get more bp, make the grunts of pain completely silent and make it so it doesn’t show the killer that you’re injured (the broken icon) until you are in a chase.
---
Killer mains need to assert their dominance after all these damn hatch standoffs
---
This.
---
Okay bud. Not gonna humor this stupid conversation anymore. 
---
Farming isn’t bannable. Don’t get hot headed over stupid shit.
---
Ya well I got a swf team yesterday the burned the lampkin lane offering and 2 of them brought insta  heals, one of them had a skull key and 2 of them where running prove thyself, then proceeding to infinite the hell out of me with balanced landing and after the game telling me that I was the most awful killer they’ve ever played against, although all of them were on last hook. Also adrenaline. For all of them. One of them told me that you have to be brain dead not to kill at least 3 people as killer and he told me that playing as killer is the easiest thing in the game.
---
Don’t you think the super safe loops near the house are op? Especially when three of them spawn? All of that compounded with jungle gyms
---
They better not make her bad. She's literally the only instance where the killer is the actual power hole. If anything, need her add-ons.
---
First things first as a killer you have generators highlighted so you should start the game off by patrolling the generators. If you’re running a hex occasionally patrolling your lit totem isn’t a bad idea. Some perks such as bbq and chili and bitter murmur reveal survivor locations if you meet the requirements of the perk. Some killers have abilities that help locate survivors. If you’re patrolling a generators and find one that clearly been gettin worked on check the area real quick as they might be in hiding. If I remember any more tips I’ll put it here
---
You got something against Tapp??
---
Oh it’s bait. He made an overrated/underrated list like 30 minutes ago and called spirit, Wraith, and hag overrated.
---
Bought Laurie to get decisive and the first time I got to use it was against a facecamping Ghostface and I ended up running out of the exit gates after I hit the skill check :)
---
I'm a 50/50 player and I honestly do not like Gideon or Lerys. If I'm killer I always end up against blendettes. If I'm survivor it's always spirit, GF, or pig. The entity hates me.
---
Atleast safe unhooks tho.
---
darn
---
Looping is a lot more than "running circles around a pallet". Jungle gyms, juking, pallet placement, 360s, and knowing when to break chase are things that go into keeping the killer busy while people do gens. There is a reason why people choose to play stealthy in the first place. It's because they find distracting the killer too hard or intimidating.
---
Can do totems as well, also hang in the basement. Locating thing with maps, re-uniting too. 
---
Just staying there are exceptions.
---
He talks about switch. It says at the top
---
Even better is the "do 3 gens solo, unhook 2-3 teammates, get found by the killer and chased for 5 minutes (breaking his ankles hard), last gen pops, get stuck on random geometry that shouldn't be there, smacked with noed, camped while your team escapes".
---
guess the killer is just the better player
---
Immersed is just the buzz word they use to describe someone who crouches around the entire game and saves their sprint burst for only chases. It just wastes a lot of time that doesn’t help anyone except for the scaredy-cats that need the mental security to play the game. At least in my experiences.
---
Good job lad
---
Agreed, Thompson House is the next to need a rework (after the Badham Preschool and Haddonfield that's already in the works). The one map with catwalks in the huge building and the long unmindgamable loop thru the side window also needs reworked.
---
I've been maining her for the last few months.  Fucking around with the different addon combos is a lot of fun.
---
Haddonfield and Grim pantry are pretty gross.
---
Thing is its hard on console
---
Huh?????
---
What other maps are you playing on?
---
exactly my friend
---
It can ruin a pig’s, ghostface, wraith and spirit stealth powers
---
Congrats! A well hidden Lullaby carried my games as well ;).
---
Dude really? Don't DC, there's no point in doing it
---
Kind of how Dark Sense doesn't work with Freddy?
---
Detective's Hunch is alright but it needs more time. Like tier 1 would give you 5 seconds like it currently does, tier 2 would give you maybe 10 seconds, and tier 3 could give 15.
---
https://youtu.be/9_9tF5Jkf-8?t=820

Props to the dad.

Not cool dude
---
indeed!
---
“Jump on high grounds” I appreciate your faith in us but I am too out of shape for that my guy
---
Jane thicc
---
&gt;I have no idea what you're talking about
---
You don't know what a fucking jungle gym is but you're sitting here telling me that running a killer doesn't take skill? Jesus christ.
---
Who would you suggest?
---
Go play a match where nobody deliberately extends chases and you get gens done without getting spotted.
---
You can't.
---
Because you haven't developed the skill.
---
"My buddy Keith tried camping out on top of a building once. He was shooting crows, but the police were too busy teargassin' him to ask what he was doin' up there. He screamed for an entire year every single time he opened his eyes! Oh, man! At first, it was funny; then it just got sad, but then it got funny again! Oh, man!" - Ellis, The Parish
---
I can’t wipe with something that doesn’t exist, OP.
---
What
---
Oh, no, I can 100% relate to this. This is the universe’s twisted way of getting back at me for something.
---
I see Claudette hasnt changed much...
---
It is against the killer rule book.
---
How do i keep track of them during a chase, i lose them as soon as i find them
---
Move up Wraith since he has good jumpscare add-ons. Fought a few with the silent bell and no terror radius/red glow on maps like The Game and Leri's and it definitely is a good jumpscare
---
A common complaint about Detectives Hunch is while the aura reading is actually pretty good (See all the totems, chests, etc.) it's way too short for you to take much advantage of it. If it lasted longer it'd be less worthless.
---
Instasaw is slightly op but they could just make carburetor tuning guide purple to balance that
---
And I bet you would be one to complain about Survivors tbagging or using flashlights huh? 
---
Not cool.
---
I love people like this. I was having no luck finishing a ritual earlier but a trapper brought me to the hatch instead of hooking me a third time. 
---
Now if only I was good at finding hatches so I could do the same for another survivor.
---
Ok so a lot of comments talking about the specific perks I picked. We can all agree that there are a lot of terrible perks, so if I said your favorite perk was bad, sorry!
---
We can clone them then we can make all of the invaders bleed and they probably might not notice it!
---
This really only works with swf. Otherwise it’s a stroke of luck to pull this off with randoms.
---
“Two totally incomparable killers”
---
“You can do that with any 2 killers” 
---
Pick one you fucking brainlet
---
The difference is survivor toxicity is annoying and killer toxicity prevents you from playing the game.
---
I’m buying the game for PS4, which killers not included in the base game are good/work well on consoles? I don’t want to buy killers and find they don’t function on console like some people say sometimes
---
It depends on your playstyle, with Wraith you’ll learn how to be a bit stealthier, hillbilly will teach you about mobility and quick actions, trapper about loops and strategy, hag basically same as trapper, doctor about map pressure and huntress is mainly aim and strategy
---
What the f is a role playing killer. And what’s wrong with wanting to win?
---
Fair point but still there's no need to be rash about it there is countless times killers have had let survivors get the hatch they did there objective but they still try to be nice.
---
I definitely identify with The Chad but sadly my p3 Ace has to be leveled up. I play Claudette but am an Ace at heart :(
---
Had a survivor in my game face camped because he used a pallet which the killer considered toxic
---
They added it back, spine chill affects vault speed again.
---
I consider myself a killer main, but if you want any credibility when speaking aboi t game balance you need to play both sides. Survivor is nice when I went to relax since it is so much less stressful than killer
---
she clearly wanted to let her go
---
They added it back along with resilience, it was an unlisted change.
---
Basement Bubba guards his momma's chest and only protects it's contents and WTF is wrong with role playing so the game is ya know fun as games should be.
---
Im on pc, this is good advice too thank you
---
It literally says in the description of the perk that it doesn’t.
---
&gt;	Cumulative Healing Speed bonuses cannot exceed 100 %.
---
no
---
Spine chill would become meta once again
---
Only for we’ll make it. As in you can’t unhook 2 people and get 200% healing speed.
---
You must always let baby survivors go, no matter what perks and items they are using
---
If a survivor wants to farm, you must farm with them or else that's toxic because they just want bloodpoints
---
You are not allowed to mindgame around pallets and loops because that's toxic and the survivor should be able to waste time
---
Certain builds are a bannable offense, such as Scratched Mirror Myers, Instadown Clown, Impossible Skill Checks Doctor
---
I say we send Jane in to distract the guards(;
---
I'm curious what killer rank you are?
---
This is awesome
---
Had this happen to me last night, the Billy then lead me to the other gate which had the same glitch then we looked for the hatch but couldn't find it.
---
u/nwordcountbot u/LlamaDrawsBad
---
Damn that's a shitty thing.
---
Once say a killers profile and their bio said that looping was an exploit
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
I have looked through llamadrawsbad's posting history and found 4 N-words, of which 2 were hard-Rs. llamadrawsbad has said the N-word 1 times since last investigated.
---
Okay so sound is super important, how do i get close enough to actually hit them. When ever i get to a gen that's obviously been worked on the survivors are long gone
---
spirit lmao get good
---
I purposely keep my killer rank as low as possible bc the higher rank you get, the more toxic survivors become :( and I’m just here to have fun and make people happy, man.
---
Gen spawn rng from my experience makes both swamp maps either worst or best map in the game. One time on the boat map two gens spawned on the pier and one in killer shack, those combined with the guaranteed boat gen makes gens soooo safe its insane
---
not cool no upvote
---
Amazing
---
Sounds like it was Nea who decided the game because you threw it away to be an asshole out of spite.
---
Not like they can catch me
---
It's 2006 all over again.
---
95% of Tapp mains I see just disappear on gens and never appear again until the gates are open. This includes me by the way.
---
I'm also still bad at chases and tend to drop the pallet early.
---
1. No one says NOED is "agaisnt the rules"
---
2. Everyone expects NOED regardless
---
You have to find the teachables in the bloodweb, just like with Claudette
---
No it's still there.
---
The background looks sick.
---
I just finished watching that video.So satisfying that a Twitch Steamer disconnects when he loses his precious flashlight
---
But for every 1 of those there's a million killers that didn't let survivors have the hatch. There's also countless times a survivor has let the killer kill them. There's more times when the survivor just tried to escape though. Your arguement goes both ways
---
It will have a chance to randomly show up in the bloodweb, may take 50+ lvls, but eventually it'll appear.
---
I have a level 30 Laurie and it hasn’t popped up yet
---
Small game should have a totem counter like thrill of the hunt other than that I think it works fine especially vs trapped or hag

Derp I read it off the skill check zones being 10% smaller. But it does still affect vault speed according to the Wiki, and I can tell you as a fact since I run it religiously that it does still affect vaults.
---
Yeaaaaaaaaaaah that ain’t for me fam. If this is what you’re looking for you shouldn’t you just do this on custom matches? Because most killers myself included are just gonna do what we’re supposed to do which is uhhh kill the survivors you know?
---
They just dropped it too soon or too late
---
Missed opportunity for thanos
---
Lmao this made me laugh till I coughed😂
---
ok.
---
True, I missed that part

you spelled Prayer Beads wrong
---
Thing is most spirits will maintain LOS with where they think you are as they phase
---
Did he ask to farm before the match started?
---
It has the same chance to pop up as every single other perk that you have unlocked so all default perks and all other unlockable perks have a chance to pop up not just the ones you want. That’s why this game is a big grind
---
I love when I get SWF teams. They are alturistic to a fault and it gets them all killed lol
---
Will do! Thanks.
---
He says thank you!
---
Or picking up someone in a pallet and hearing footsteps
---
As a Tapp main I'm so happy he got cool new cosmetics
---
Spoken like a true killer main 😂😂
---
I'm surprised that she didn't hear you, Claudette isn't that quiet when she is hurt.
---
Though I do feel bad for you reporting really doesn’t do much in pretty much any game and sadly I have doubts that anyone will get banned
---
Wow!
---
Top 10 underrated perks
---
I’m so close to red rank survivor for the first time, I can taste it.
---
Two DC's and you decide to be a dick to the last survivor alive. Eugh.
---
I already have all of them.
---
Is this gonna be love on all platforms Tuesday?
---
Killers: "survivors have too many rule!!!"
---
Also killers: "you will get facecamped and tunnled if you dare loop, pallet stun, bring a flashlight, potentially look like you're playing with a friend, destroy your ruin, or do anything remotely regarding trying to survive"
---
Would have to work for grabs as well. But even then for all the trouble you have to go and time wasted just to get it charged seems not worth it
---
It's called grinding. ISNT IT FUN?!?!?!
---
Also you should be thankful for those SWF teams if we didn't have SWF the queue times would be a whole hell of a lot worse
---
Not that they shouldn’t get banned but they probably won’t
---
Which map is that?
---
As a Huntress main, that's not true. It's actually more of a true 50/50 or even more leaning towards "How the fuck did that not hit?" than "How the fuck did that hit?". Survivors just only get to see the latter.
---
Hopefully, I've asked him to do more.
---
BHVR are basically making it lore. I don't know why.
---
Borderlands
---
Wait, is this for real? I never played with Spine Chill
---
Except for the ones he didn't earn and still gave himself. It was also alleged he gave himself infinite blood points. And it was the dishonesty after he was caught that bothered me more than anything. He really tried to get his fans to harass BVHR to overturn it and behaved like a child.
---
It's not worse than haddonfield against tryhards with BK
---
the amount of times I evaded and got away... spine chill deserves its own rank in the higher ups.
---
I love it too. In others I'm going to try to get him to theme it off other maps, maybe the Game for pig, swamp for hag etc
---
Thank you my sir
---
Happened to me in a game where a Huntress ended up facecamping when a survivor actually did bones. Said either deal with devour hope or get camped. I guess cleansing the totem doesn't count as dealing with it.
---
I've been consistently winning the majority of my games at red ranks using mid-tier killers without Ruin. I even ensure I don't kill anyone too early to maximize points for everyone. It just feels good to be able to play with the killers and perks I like without getting stomped like I used to.
---
whfa
---
*dead hard intensifies*
---
Sorry I should have clarified. I think the token part should just get removed altogether in this idea.
---
Same here lol. Intense but a defeat...
---
Doesnt mean it's not toxic. And idk why people are downvoting me lol, I'm being realistic. IM A SURVIVOR MAIN TOO, I just am honest
---
I play killer and survivor and Huntress hatchet hitboxes are fucked and as a Huntress main you already know this. Her hatchets do not have a curve ability so idk how tf I'm able to hit people around walls and shit. Come on bruh way more hit that shouldn't. It's rare I don't get a hit that I should have. The only time I even experience this issue is when someone is vaulting a window doing a medium vault..
---
I read it as samination trapper
---
Delete deja vu. Buff the bloodweb
---
Future baby Killer that can blink and turn invisible maybe?
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I like most of those ideas, but i think a few of them have big issues
---
1. Why maps? Out of all the items to ban maps feel silly. If you wanted it to be hardcore, getting rid of items like medkits and toolboxes would make more sense. 
---
2. No heartbeat would be really unfun for survivors. A lot of the killer balance is around heartbeat, and even if it does help stealth killers like Myers, it would add less reason to play killers like huntress, who you would still be able to hear
---
3. No scratch marks would break killers like spirit, or at least serve as a big nerf
---
Overall this seems like a fun idea to think about, but removing mechanics that killers are pretty much based around would make the mode laughably unbalanced. I think better ideas for a hardcore mode would be like these:
---
1. Double or increased bps. Survivors would be going into a mode where they are at a massive disadvantage, so i feel like most would stick to the normal difficulty. For this reason survivorssl would need a reason to play. As for killers maybe give them more bps too,but they alresdy have a reason to play because they are at a advantage
---
Yeah, that's a really good idea. It makes the picture so atmospheric.
---
She got the buff skate boots and jus run u over lol
---
a killer running devour hope would say some shit like that.
---
I'm kind of like that. I usually handle the gens unless I feel as though I am the only one that is not trying to unhook teammates. I'm decent at loops and keeping the good pallets, but I prefer staying stealthy and being altruistic rather than being the distractor
---
Oh wow! That IS relatable!
---
Pretty much
---
hi I’m the crapper
---
I play on PC at 30 ping it's def not lag lol
---
Wake Up is pretty solid, and I actually love the perk, but it could use an increase from 5/10/15 to 10/15/20.
---
Detective's Hunch is good when you're just starting out and don't know where the pallets and totems are, so it's decent for getting  good idea of where to go next, but I think it should be changed to where it activates anytime any gen gets done, not just one that you did
---
I'm surprised you didn't put Up The Ante or Open Handed on there. They're both super gimicky, especially Up The Ante which requires your entire team to run it, Slippery Meat, and Salty Lips for the offering and even then it's still not worth it when you can just run Deliverance
---
For the Killer side, I think Territorial, Tinkerer, and all of Wraith's perks should be buffed at least a little
---
Feng Min because she actually says 'oof' sometimes when picking up items.
---
It is. Check Wiki, or test yourself in KYF.
---
Watch out , bvhr might nerf killers' FOV even more if they'll find out.
---
I play League and DBD a LOT and I can confidently say that DBD is more toxic, especially the survivors.
---
congratulations. very cool.
---
It USED to. Unless they changed it back and didn't put into the description of the perk
---
But the funny thing is tho. A good Spirit knows this and will always train their Vision as best they can to mitigate this. Spine chill only helps when she is coming to you gen and even then. I always run sideways to gens.

Where is Bill and Ash? :D
---
agree, i used dark sense a lot when i first started playing survivor. knowing who the killer is by the aura (if you havent seen them yet) and where they are at can be super helpful
---
Why am i getting downvoted for thanking someone for correcting my spelling?
---
Oh god david
---
I would use spine chill, If it will frikin pop in the bloodweb
---
Myers does have a terror radius tho. It’s just incredibly small. By the time you hear it it’s pretty much too late.
---
and it’s really good with wall hacks piggy too
---
You can pretty much hear it from that distance tbh.
---
Please, let’s not turn this thread into ‘who’s worse’ autism argument.

Does she even say that in the film? I watched Saw III the other day, and at no point can I remember amanda having any interactions with ‘young ones’ or children
---
I mean in the M&amp;A combo cases.  M&amp;A removes his terror radius until he triggers the chase.  Considering how insanely prevalant this combo is on any Myers player just because of how much more deadly it makes his tier 1 and 2, it is nearly a core perk for all Myers players.
---
Ironworks of Misery (Macmillan Estate)
---
Damn. That's how you know it's REALLY bad!k
---
I would have DC'd
---
Getting hooked means he has another chance to go back to crouching in corners and urban evading around the map like truly skilled survivors like him do.
---
It’s so tiring. I love this game and discussion about it but every single half decent thread turns to shit because of cry babies on both sides.
---
Wait, console has endgame chat? Does PS4 have it? Wtf how have I not seen it
---
Oh. Idk if they'll do that either.
---
Nope. I’m a pig main and that’s what I felt so I made this. It’s a shitpost, set your expectations lower lol
---
Start with Leatherface for BBQ, get it as a teachable, then go to Hag for Ruin. After that you have a strong setup and experienced how to work with instadowns and trap placements, making killers with those a bit easier. Huntress is hard to use at a low level to due her aiming. I'd highly recommend Myers once you have both, since he's a good killer with good add-ons and a good power
---
Sorry, didn't realize my team and I were capable of regularly doing the impossible.
---
It's not impossible, it's just hard for people who haven't developed the skill.
---
This is amazing! Has he done wraith? I'd love to see it.
---
I think you're missing 1 tiny bit here.
---
#ITS IN FUCKING EARLY BETA
---
Oh my bad my bad you are correct.
---
That would sound great but fuckin stupid at the same time....count me in
---
But the description of Premonition says that it trumps all killer stealth abilities.
---
She needs to get an interrupt on you entering/exiting the locker because she can't do Spacebar actions before getting blink fatigue.
---
If he does do more can you ask him to do The Trapper first?
---
One again I didn’t put ALL of the perks I thought were bad. I’m not trying to single out anyone’s favorite perks or anything like that. Wake up is terrible as there is no use for it until endgame. The perk doesn’t help you get to endgame and even if you do, there’s a chance it won’t be used.
---
That's one he's planning to do since TCM is one of his favourite films .
---
This is true but if people can manage it in Fortnite which is far more complex button wise then people can handle it on dbd imo. I do like the idea of a choice though! I haven't had the joy of versing a PC Nurse so maybe I'd eat my words 😹
---
I know it’s not intended in the design I’m just saying that you can see the moment she goes in a phase if you are close enough to see her hair
---
I love ghostface. He has the best bits of 3 killers, and while cloaking if someone is exposing you  you get a super hand indicator of where they were hiding.
---
Wait till his rework to use it
---
Sounds good to me lol
---
Yeah, I agree the moon should be bigger since the game had a whole offering based on moonlight in the past, so there should be a bigger emphasis on it.
---
Current build:  Brutal Strength, Overcharge, Discordance, Pop Goes the Weasel.  Combined with strategic trap deployment you can drag out the mid-game FOREVER by just constantly keeping every gen under watch and un-progressed.  Plus Brutal Strength helps a lot in chase which is very important for little Ms. Piggy.  If you’re finding that survivors are getting too much done early game you can swap Discordance for Hex: Ruin but Discordance seems to serve the same purpose as it allows you to pounce on any gen rushers and scare them into splitting up, which combined with Overcharge failures makes them abandoned any failed gens immediately for fear of an ambush.
---
Somewhere in the sky, ~~Nea~~ the Entity saw this and thought:
---
"Damn, that was cold".
---
It is pretty relaxing tho, you don't have to do anything!
---
that.... is amazing
---
Devs said they plan to add a better punishment system similar to R6 Siege or CS:GO where each time you DC you get a longer timeout. They also want the DCing player's character to remain ingame so you can hook them for a BBQ stack.
---
I think hes talking about the classic situation with spirit, on a pallet mindgame. She walks to it behind you and stops moving. There you can use the perk, and see if she goes around the loop or didn't use her power at all.
---
It's funny how the stress levels swap as you go up in ranks.
---
Does it kill survivors when they run past gste now?
---
One time I maxed out my bp and I forgot to spend any of it before my next game so I got jack shit for a pretty solid match. Lol
---
Kate’s face is nightmare fuel.
---
According to reddit hes F-tier, so you propably do play him wrong.
---
But to be honest, i consider Bubba as a strong killer, when i play him i keep getting 4k too, and hes one of the killers i fear the most as a survivor because once hes on your back, you are fucked. 
---
The whole reddit-circlejerk about bubba being the worst killer is, in my opinion, some elitist behaviour because "duh-in the higher ranks only nurse ans billy are viable, if you would be as pro as me you would understand"
---
I am stoked for 3
---
Perhaps my brotha, perhaps
---
Bruh you were literally tbagging at the gate.   
---
  
---
That's toxic.
---
Does this work with the false doctor cone that chases you?
---
I'll see what I can do, I've asked for wraith and the spirit but I can see which he wants to do.
---
Removed - Repost
---
Jeff is not a girl
---
Mkay nice
---
So a character that completely eliminates all chase mechanics and turns every single loop into a 50/50 guessing game is fair?
---
I had a dream where i picked a survivor up and every single hook in the game was sabotaged. I woke up swimming in my own sweat.
---
I play both and just browse this subreddit for memes
---
I don't care very much with the Legion killer he's going to draw (if he draws haha), but on Myers, I'll be waiting and tell him that Billy's got incredible
---
SABOTAGE SQUAD ASSEMBLE!
---
WE WILL GET RID OF THE HOOKS.
---
Wonderful, I liked it
---
Standing ovation to you,  very true statement right here
---
That's not important
---
It’s beautifully drawn but horrifying, perfectly representing Billy’s nature
---
Are there usual hatch spots or is it completely random? It takes me forever to find the hatch sometimes and other times it’s right there by the gate lol
---
Again, purely cosmetic items boo hoo. And remind me again what does his pay fuck ups half to do with his current self?
---
Ma'am control yourself
---
They should look. It all comes down to survivor play
---
billy has thicker thighs. he ain't a model :)
---
But then survivors could troll their teammates by alerting the killer to them
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
**If it’s active**, attempting to escape through door or hatch will trigger a Game Over.
---
There is no saltshaker on that table therefor I disprove of this Meme!
---
Good picture.
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;There's a lot more to succeeding at stealth than crouching in a corner.
---
Okay. Then enlighten us with all the nuances of being an immersed survivor.
---
I can brother
---
Some people wish they only have 5m. waiting time, consider yourself lucky!
---
Feng Min's final form... Roseanne!
---
If you are low ranked, I'm not surprised. Survivors that don't know how to loop get destroyed by Bubba because of getting constant guaranteed chainsaws. He was the first killer I tried and I experienced the same. Against good survivors though, you'll never land a chainsaw and he becomes an M1 killer with no ability.
---
Oooh I apologise. I thought it was meant to be a quote 😂
---
Billy is a THICC Boi.
---
this picture is gon a haunt my dreams. tell your dad he did a great job 👏
---
&gt;“Honestly like, she’s not even being toxic. Like. She’s actually doing really well. I’m just like....”
---
GUESS ILL DC.
---
This is a joke btw
---
Comedy target to 12 YOs.
---
BILL ON PS4?!?!?!?!?!
---
The usual lol
---
I amazed BHVR hasn't released a statement threatening with killer bans for abuse! That usually happens when they're to lazy to fix an issue...
---
Faker? I think *you're* the fake hedgehog around here. Comparing yourself to me?! Hah! You're not even good enough to be my fake.
---
&gt;The perk is literally hard mode right now and that’s not a good perk to have in the game.
---
Except the devs purposefully made No Mither to be hard mode, so survivors would have a challenge. If you don't like that challenge, then just don't use the perk. Besides, not every perk has to be on top of the meta perk list.
---
Thats an actual nightmare oh my god
---
Ruin; Thanatophobia; Dying Light; Sloppy Butcher.
---
Mix those with her traps, and you got yourself a hell of a "slow survivor progression" killer.
---
I have honestly never seen complaints about survivor cosmetics.  Perhaps you mean stuff about "Immersed P3 Claud" or "Tosic neon Nea".
---
i don't see how facing a purple pink addons rank 1 Nurse or Spirit is more relaxing
---
Billy main by any chance?
---
I have nothing to smile about. I want to quit this stupid game again. I'm tired of every single red rank killer running BBQ and Ruin. The two most annoying perks to a survivor. And they camp and tunnel too. That's how you get to red rank, run the best perks and just camp. Voila.
---
Of course, who doesn't like to see a sexy park ranger on the end of that chainsaw in your chest.
---
LOL.
---
Just tried sloppy and Thana, it seemed to work I’ll try it some more
---
No actually, he picked this one because it looked the coolest. I've asked for either spirit or wraith next. But he might choose trapper or someone else based on looks.
---
Yeah this game gets less fun the higher rank you get usually, as does any game. It sucks
---
BBQ
---
Survelience 
---
Overcharge
---
Fertive Chase
---
Not even I just really like that sort of thing dk why. Did your dad ever do art in school or is he just a legend?
---
i pretended i was afk against a gen as legion and did the exact same thing, just pushed up against a survivor and stayed there
---
Mmm, that's something new to me. Still, it'd be better if we got a clear indicator instead of that.
---
What a wonderful perspective you have! I wish there were more people like you in the world.
---
Now I wanna try this some time on Léry's; see if it's repeatable or if this Hillbilly just got lucky.
---
Most of the matches you will get chainsaws. But once you go against a group of decent survivors, you will regret bringing Bubba to that match, that's why it's low tier. But I'm pretty sure he's deadly in 7-20 ranks.
---
I don't see how facing 4 man SWF with toolbox, key, insta heal and crutch perks is more relaxing
---
I like that Icon:
---
**Hookwhisperer**
---
You can befriend local hooks.  
---
After a mere 20-15-10s. of channeling the hook becomes your friend if a killer approaches the hook while carrying you the hook spontaneously breaks when he tries to hook you causing you to instantly wiggle free.
---
1 hook per map, doesn't work on basement hooks (they are to HC to care).
---
There is. Every map has hatch spots, it's not random, what's random is which of the spots the hatch is going to spawn
---
lol maybe ur just rekt
---
maybe they should fix issues in the game instead of ignoring them and banning people
---
That is fucking awesome! Fantastic job!
---
Oh, so that’s how a Michael was able to stalk me from a distance of a few feet for so long yesterday...
---
I have fun in red ranks when I play a 4 person SWF because then you can tell everyone what's going on and everyone can have a job, but when you're playing with randoms it's like 1 person gets hooked and all 3 other people come over to unhook and no gens get done and you all die. I really wish the devs would have a solo only version and a SWF version, or punish killers more for staying near the hook or tunnelling the person off.
---
Wholesome
---
Lol maybe you need to learn how to spell and make a proper sentences
---
I’ll give it a try, haven’t really played with the new surveillance.
---
Does he happen to like Ghost Face a lot? He must've been growing up with Scream. 
---
But holy shit, that's some serious skill.
---
Killers have very fragile feelings unfortunately. One hook drop later and they DC :(
---
Yeah you’re not playing properly 
---
You have to face camp them
---
Kate: *jumps down* Hugs?
---
Bubba: .......... REEEVEEEEEEE
---
That's just a little bonus ;)
---
Beast of prey should remove the bloodstain without conditions.
---
I wouldn’t worry about him. He’s probably a new, low rank player. His statement was “thinking bubba is bad is elitist hurr durr”.
---
I like it because those two are permanent. Ruin is good at slowing the early game, and by the time they cleanse it, you may have taken out the obsession and they're still slowed for the remainder of the game. Even better if you kill the obsession while ruin is still active... Progression barely trickles at that point haha.
---
Rank 20 probably.
---
It’s just the game, so many bugs
---
Campers was an entirely unnecessary addition to your comment, wasn’t even camping just making the guy suffer by watching him crawl to victory then dragging him away to do it again right as time gives out.
---
It was a TDI reference, but ok
---
First off I never called him an asshole. Secondly I can do extremes too. Hitler probably wouldn't try to commit genocide again if he tries again get back to me until then you can't talk trash on him. Noob3 broke the rules twice and handled it badly both times. He may be different now, but I don't feel like giving him a third chance. Anyone who wants to is more than free I don't know why everyone is so defensive about what he did.
---
That’s why, you need to get to a higher rank because killers won’t want to disconnect at a high rank.
---
Barbecue and Chilli, Hex:Haunted Ground, Pop Goes the Weasel, Surveillance, there are much better perks for her.
---
What’s BMing?
---
Also, don’t recall ever doing this to a survivor.
---
So you dont play myers because you're dumb enough to run NOED on him?
---
100% going against scrubs. Try him against good players and you'll see how trash he is
---
Its free as much (or more) as americans are free
---
What the fuck are you guys talking about.
---
He obviously said shirtless Myers
---
That is a very good point! Im trying to rank up!
---
You’ll get there
---
This has me thinking.....canonically, do people age in the entity realm?
---
Now only one left is she kills from the void
---
if they start entering spirit walk then you can easily duke them by doing fake scratch marks, running towards them just goin to a corner. it’s about knowing if they are in spirit walk.
---
Survivors often won’t stray too far from the gens they’re working on when they hear a killer’s approach. Look behind any nearby objects, rocks and walls and such, they are usually hiding nearby. Sometimes even in lockers, and if they do hide in one you can actually faintly hear the sound of a locker door opening/closing, which has gotten me some locker grabs before.
---
Another thing, huntress is really good, but I would say she is not a good starter killer as she is slower than most and is very easy to loop as a result without good prediction and aim (and sometimes that doesn’t even matter bc of janky object hitboxes. I play a lot of huntress lol). The three original characters, Trapper, Wraith, and Hillbilly all have different strategies but I would say they’re really good for learning. Hag is also pretty damn good, and sometimes a bit easier than Trapper. I would definitely suggest looking up some tutorials on Youtube if you haven’t already, that helped me quite a bit when starting.
---
It's not a circlejerk, it's a fact. You think he is strong because you're facing trash players. Try playing him at higher ranks, against players that actually know what they're doing.
---
Honestly I didn't even look at the perks. I main either Ghostface or Myers and was just doing Legion for the Ritual. 
---
But it's still decent enough. Anything that saves time downing people in EGC isn't bad.
---
I play as the pig, I ALWAYS let one person go, and my choice depends on how they play. If they seem generally new and try to save their team without body blocking and being toxic, that's usually the one I go with.
---
Tell people like that next time that you don’t care.
---
idk if you got that this is satire
---
Never claimed to be good just don’t like having to rely on EW to get instadown late game. But thanks for the hostility stranger!
---
Thanks bruh
---
Oh you don’t need to look at him positively I was just awnsering you question as too why people look at him so positively. Because people change. You shouldn’t have got downvoted for asking that original question, it was probably just salty fanboys.
---
Why are you salty that’s an easy +1 but you didn’t do enough to get it so it’s only yourself to blame
---
Then he would have to remove the main point of the perk and make that the only bonus.
---
Holy shit! the detail on this one is really amazing!
---
Unrelated note
---
Swamp. Hatch can spawn in a corner.
---
I tried getting adept nurse on rank reset and even with practice I can’t do it
---
This guy here seriously thinks all 4 survivors are doing gens without ever getting into a chase. In actuality, he is the survivor who does gens while others kite the killer and then he immediately leaves through the gates. Probably also the type to immediately go down when found.
---
Damn Pop and Surveillance would be great, haven't found them on her bloodweb yet, use those on Ghostface and works well
---
Well no ones really going to listen to you. 
---
Yeah while it’s annoying getting flashlighted a lot just learn to look to the side and continue walking at them. 
---
Look to the side and then back at them and then back tot he side until you get a hit.  Pallet break/stun flashlight well at least they wasted time in trying to blind you.
---
Yoshikage
---
Yeah it's just completely imbalanced around here how often killers get called out for being toxic compared to survivors.
---
Suvivor does anything ==&gt; Toxic
---
Killer is a total asshole ==&gt; They're just playing their game, the goal to get kills by any means necessary, survivors probably deserved it anyway
---
yeah im guessing you havent gone up against many spirits. Your chance of surviving is based on how good the spirit is, not how good you are.
---
Do you stream? I’d love to learn this god tier stealth ability you have.
---
I think they only made an animation for grabbing while climbing into a locker and not out. They just used the climbing-in-grab for both?
---
Kate serving Jocelyn Wildenstein realness.
---
Try using lightborn. majorly good perk that always give me a chuckle when someone with a purple flashlight trys to save or flashlight at a pallet. Usually ends with a hit.
---
What’s that?
---
It’s because this reddit is mainly killer mains, many of them being extremely whiny and unable to take accept that they lost a game.
---
I actually cringe when I see downvotes on so called “survivor main” comments who make a fair point about something genuinely unfair on the killer side. 
---
And to further prove my point, I’ll probably be downvoted on this comment.
---
I can't believe someone calling stealth the most skill intensive form of game play has 20 up votes. Proves how little this sub knows. 
---
I started the game as a stealther because I sucked at looping and didn't know better. Its really easy to do but useless for your team against good killers. The guy who can loop the killer for 2 minutes is 10x more useful and skilled than the blendettes.
---
It's better to look down so you can see where you're walking.
---
Try making one where kate or ash is opening the gate while someone is on the lookout and the nurse blinking towards them
---
Damn mimics!
---
it probably wont get completely fixed lol
---
Make your choice is talking about the killer. Down the injured survivor who was just unhooked or down the healthy survivor who has exposed. It's a killer perk and the killers choice.
---
I usually respect Billy’s that can pull off curves, but that’s a just silly
---
I don't have time to teach a scrub the most basic parts of a video game right now, but I can give you some pro tips.
---
1) ABDG: Always Be Doing Gens. If the killer isn't coming towards you, do a gen.
---
2) You can't do a gen if you're crouched in a corner.
---
3) You can't do a gen if you're in a chase.
---
4) Learn how to quickly break line of sight, know where the killer is coming from, and abuse the crap out of their limited FOV.
---
5)  Steath play is not "immersed." "Immersed" is what bad players call the players who aren't dead after they've been caught 3 times. 
---
6) Situational awareness is absolutely key to stealth, but most people aren't aware of anything except pallet and window locations.
---
7) One of the most funny things in the game is having a rank 1 nurse repeatedly check on your gen, confused by who keeps touching it after she smashes it, and popping the gen right behind her and leaving while the gen notification gives her a blind spot.
---
8) There are many bad stealth players because effective stealth is hard to pull off. Most players switch to looping because it's easier.
---
9) Don't get caught, and have a backup plan if you do. Know how you're going to break a chase. Iron Will and Window of Oppirtunity are great training wheels for this.
---
10) Stealth is hardest after the gates are powered, because there are only 2 objectives to check. Have a person ready to open each door as soon as the last gen pops. If you can't open a door fast enough, keep the killer bouncing between the two gates.
---
Bonus: There's more than one way to be an effective SWF team. Some are harder than others. The ways that take the most skill are not the most popular, for obvious reasons.
---
Tiktok. It’s very common.
---
That's the point I was making you said the marks were wonky but the killer finds them useful and the could also have one survivor  playing lookout
---
I don’t see sue a getting called out for doing anything here and if they do they get downvoted to hell. As I see it: Survivors being toxic is flash light click spam after dropping a pallet and tbagging after dropping a pallet and for killers being toxic is actually face camping for **no reason** (building so people understand its acceptable in certain situations). It’s not fun for you or for them.
---
A love how none of these stereotypes fit me as the killers I play. 
---
But I do agree with these stereotypes lol.
---
This is amazing!!
---
Oh I see perfectly fine doing what I do. 
---
I guess it depends on who you are.
---
user name checks out
---
I don't know how long it takes the artists to make cosmetics but I'm assuming it'll be mid chapter patch after the next chapter
---
Rank 8 survivor just played a game with a camping tunneling ghostface and the game after that was an insidious camping billy. I wish rank meant the end of this crap but it seems some killers at every rank are happy to de pip to secure 1 kill.
---
Nothing wrong with just wanting to kill people but role-playing makes games like this way more fun. That's like saying "why wouldn't the DM just want to kill everyone in D&amp;D?"
---
Well sure...he can...but it's fun to make more out of it
---
Rank 8 is higher, you will still experience camping sometimes but the teammates might be better, I mean high rank by like ranks 4-1
---
I played a round as Ghostface. I thought it was weird when I finished marking two specific survivors working on a gen and both refused to get off it. Turns out they were both 20 and 19 or something. I felt real bad after the fact. I planned on letting one of the last two survivors go but put them on the hook one last time only to accidentally kill them.
---
That wouldn't make sense in the context of the movies. 
---
The victims of the Saw movies are told the choices they have and to "make their choice". What your saying is that it was John or Amanda's choice as the Jigsaw killer?
---
Sure thing bud, but it's bad advice. Killers who are good always Looks jo or down.
---
Well there's about a hundred a day of actual new players saying shit like this on Reddit. Try to make a better joke I guess.
---
Also you calling him an asshole was a mistake on my part that was another commenter.
---
Oh wow she is haha thanks!
---
Bill already died
---
Some people wouldn't save you if an Icon would show them that the killer has Myc. Some people don't even have the balls to complete the last gen with other people doing it with you, even if it is nearly done, when the Killer comes towards them.
---
bruh talk about thirsty.
---
Holy shitballs, your dad is amazing!
---
Hypocrisy-the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.
---
No, it was an afk wraith. Pretty boring trial.
---
Not really, and on a tiny map where the killers terror radius is unreliable and gens are hard to find
---
I'd like to have an argument please.
---
What I'm saying is in the game it's a killer perk and therefore the killers choice to decide to go for the injured survivor or to one hit the healthy survivor. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
I can't tell you for sure since I stopped the recording before showing the end-game screen but I'm pretty certain he didn't have any turning addons.
---
The nice messages i get when i let the last 2 survivors get their points and escape :) 
---
Only thing keeping me playing at this point
---
How dare you insult *it*
---
GG! Ez baby killer!
---
Total Drama Island, that one 2000’s animated survivor parody.
---
With all due respect, I’ve played around 600 hours of DBD since spirit release, and around 300 before that. I understand scratch mark jukes and how they work, but that’s just not enough to throw off decent spirits. The killer has many clues including scratch marks, grass movements, bodyblocking, survivor breathing/moaning, and footsteps. Playing survivor against competent killers is not as easy as you might think.
---
yeah, hi this was me
---
Your *Dad*? That's badass. Not only is he an artist but he likes DbD
---
It’s way easier than huntress, nurses calling and thanataphobia actually help compared to going in basically perkless with Huntress’ perks. Just use range addons
---
Survivors have sooo many tools to counter tunneling. And it's so much harder to pip as a killer. You can depip when getting a 4k, like wtf, I played my role and killed them...
---
Hell. Yes.
---
i finally found a full premade to play with at red ranks. FINALLY!
---
What if they buffed Wraith so that while invisible, he's like T1 Myers where he cannot be detected by perks (OoO, Alert, Spine Chill, ect)
---
It wouldn't be enough, but it would be a cool buff
---
All the other kids with the pumped up kick, better run, better run out run my: weapon name
---
Hey man that wasn’t a very nice thing to do
---
I use ash as my survivor, Freddy as a killer
---
New Shape cosmetic: stonks market head
---
I can see where you're coming from, it's just there's other perks that break that rule e.g. Remember me is a killer perk, but it could only be referring to the survivor remembering the killer.
---
What did this originate from?
---
It’s not THAT bad
---
Kate and Ghost Face. Maybe Freddy when the rework releases next Tuesday. Pig is fun against potatoes. Have you got BBQ from Leatherface yet?
---
Play nurse man. At the beginning you'll be bullied but then... uuuu then... they will literally crouch in front of you asking for mercy, even in the middle of a chase. Oh my god noe everybody respects me, even at rank 1.
---
Thank you! ^ ^

This is going to give me NIGHTMARES it’s so accurate and frightening, especially in that medium (pencil? Looks like). Either way, SCARY good.
---
When you play 50/50 and circle jerk everyone =D
---
He is super good agaisnt me because his shock thing makes my frames drop to 5 fps 🙄
---
Myers actually wears a sheet with glasses in the movie?...
---
You could add bonus bp to the unhooker. Make it a real choice.
---
Legacied almost every survivor, useless perks pop up 98% of time.
---
What the format is based off of, i feel like i have seen it somewhere
---
Hes middle of the road because his ability doesn't help him end chases directly. Which is the problem with a lot of killers because it makes them easily loopable.  Basically if you can loop, learn the jungle gyms, and get good with pallet chaining hes just another smuck who needs to wack you the old fashioned way. Also his whole thing is keeping people in his massive terror radius so unless hes on the otherside of the map you always have an idea of when he may be coming. Which reminds me, hes not particularly good at large maps.
---
A lot of his issues are shared by any killer that can't teleport, mind game pallets, or throw  an axe across the map to down a survivor.
---
Nurse is WAY easier on PC than console. You'd get really tilted versing a PC Nurse because almost every Nurse (excluding ones who are bad at her or don't play her much) can steamroll a game and it's harder to play against her when they have Ruin and all that shit. A PC Nurse can easily adapt to survivors so if you want to do the same thing twice it's hard. She's that uncounterable.
---
PC Billy on the other hand is counterable if you're on Lerys or The Game but hard to counter on more open maps that he can easily land chainsaws on. 
---
Us PC users don't get many facecampers except in ranks 16 - 20  where there's a LOT of campers and tunnelers. That would make a lot of Console survivors want crossplatform play. I've seen one Console stream and god the facecamps seem annoying.
---
I like that idea 👍
---
They had sections for that yeah
---
Ahah, no, never! I'm a Meg main, but never toxic: no teabag, no farmed teammate, no dcs, no gg ez baby killer! :D
---
You think stealth is crouching in a corner. Effective looping is 80% running circles around pallets. Effective stealth is almost never crouching in a corner. I can't imagine how dumb you would have to be to think crouching=stealth. Maybe I just assumed people who could type were smarter than that.
---
&gt; Thematically, you should be trying to escape the killer, not hang out with him as long as possible.
---
Not true, as there are plenty of perks that match thematically with getting the killer's attention on you.
---
What do you mean?
---
I main laurie just because she was the only survivor labeled as hard.
---
Yes, poop!
---
Players
---
Order
---
Our
---

---
Ohhhh, poop!
---
I guess if your new to DBD
---
Why? The game is fantastic and full of safe pallet
---
Yea in the first one
---
Love it.
---
Although Id switch around Wraith and Pig in my own experience. Wraiths tend to be facecampers and not so 'chill' while I always enjoy meming with the pigs
---
there are legit issues with the game, but camping, tunneling, ruin, noed, and spirit fury/enduring + killer rules and surv rules dont count to the problem and are annoying to hear constantly. Complaining about it isnt gonna fix it bc people can play how they want toxic or not. There are legit issues, talk about them, not the same regurgitated toxic crap from every end game chat. no one wants to hear it anymore.
---
If you get looped for 3 minutes it's your fault not the survivors maybe you'd rank up if you learned when to swap targets and apply map pressure 🐸☕
---
What killers do you use? I have a lot of difficulty with any killer since the emblems are so hard for killers.
---
ye, I know
---
Your dad has mad skills! He could design his own killer with that talent!
---
Damn you are a hero. I would love to see more players like you :D
---
Fucking died laughing.
---
When boys sing to you.
---
Corey Taylor: I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound.
---
Is just stuck in my head.
---
I like to play David because his scream doesnt wreck my ears when he gets hooked.
---
You must be dumb as shit to think stealthing takes skill. Funny you talk about intelligence not knowing what the fuck a jungle gym is. By all means continue being a useless ass teammate at rank 15 you troglodyte.
---
My point stands regardless, I don't think anyone thinks I hold suicide in the same league as poor sportsmanship.
---
I let a baby Dwight open the Exit Gates as the last one alive. I was crouched next him in a bush watching, and any time I would charge my ambush (so I could make the cute growling sound) he would immediately let go, run away a few feet and stare at me.
---
He was so afraid it was adorable
---
Yeah. Considering Michael is just sneaky and he can't be seen by auras, but Wraith is supposedly in the "Spirit World" while invisible yet can be seen by auras.
---
Iron Will is an extremely solid pick at red ranks, the logic being 
---
- If i'm against nurse/spirit, Iron Will is amazing
---
- If i'm not against nurse/spirit, It's fine being a a mostly dud perk
---
Just because you want it doesn't mean that you need it.  Hell if you're going to slug, look for hatch then when you find it hook the slugged guy then stay near hatch until he gets unhooked (if he's not on the 3rd hook)
---
it's because the killer was rank 20 aswell...
---
&gt; will always refill bottles next to hooked survivor. 
---
well yeah as you're using BBQ
---
If you want to go for the best perks? Go for the hang and leather face. But If you want to have a different experience, go with doctor or the plauge
---
Squidward working the Krusty Krab
---
There are times obviously when either internet disconnects, the killer is sluging everyone and Bm'ing, or you want to give the last person hatch
---
I feel like a good solution would be that if a survivor DCs they can't join a new game until the current one ends
---
Tbh, might start being ig 'toxic' as a survivor if it makes games so easy against babyrage killers. Touch a lil ctrl after palette for a free game for three people? Sign me tf up! ultimately it's like, if they're not saying nasty things to you, what IS the harm? Why is such an insult? Why is it so personal? Why can't you move to grab someone else, why can't you practice your chase skills with them, why can't you appreciate the time they've put in even if they're being smug about it? Survivors being toxic in game shouldn't be such a blow, and if it is that's something you have to temper yourself.
---
Negative, don’t have leather face
---
I gotta hurry up and get borrowed time on my survivors before they make us get his teachables.
---
Already have the doc, forgot to mention him.
---
Sounds like someone’s projecting a little bit of anger.
---
What’s wrong buddy?
---
It depends on your play style. How do you play the game? Who is your favourite killer you have so far?
---
There's no anger these posts are just annoying
---
I second this
---
Billies and Nurses are some of the easiest. You don't have to run to stay out of line of sight of a Nurse and Billies like to smash and run if they don't see a survivor. Doc hard-counters stealth, but you can still manage okay if you know how to manage screams. Freddy and Wraith are actually the hardest to stealth against because you can't break line of sight if you don't know where they could be coming from.
---
If a survivor runs to that loop I just walk away. Unfortunately, it’s getting to the point where every survivor just run straight to it and loops it until the window closes off.
---
Nice.
---
Use Franklin’s, Lightborn, or Overwhelming Presence.

''ppl can play how they want toxic or not''. Same goes for talking about this game. No ones gonna change their behavior based on this, that includes bitching.
---
This is what Space Jam should’ve been.
---
You know the perk is made for the killer to choose right?
---
It's more pointless than the old surveillance x\_\_\_x super hard to stack, super easy to loose stacks and the effect is super pointless
---
It's a quote from the movie when the victims aka survivors have to make a choice.
---
what is that Adam
---
None of what you said shows you need skill. This is like the brown rank "how to avoid the killer" guide.
---
Tell pops that he got some fucking skillz
---
Stereotypes that fit me/players I get against
---
Trapper: I use the Ornate mask and pain flail. The thing is I can't pick up my traps for a good 15 seconds so thats similar I guess.
---
Wraith: I used to do good at Wraith before I decided to buy other killers. Now I'm just a basement chest camper Wraith.
---
Hillbilly: I only get against the first kind. They tryhard like they have a fuckin gun up to their head.
---
Nurse: Always godly. They also tryhard like their fuckin lives depend on it. The second they fuck up it seems like they're going to get murdered.
---
Myers: They either DC because no tombstone or they're a fuckin memer.
---
Hag should've been "A proxy camper. Won't leave too far away from traps because  they'll just instantly teleport when a trap gets set off. Most tryhard"
---
Doctor: Ok this is true
---
Huntress: Every Huntress twitch streamer I've seen done this.
---
LF: The most true one.
---
Freddy: For the new one it's either that or because they had a splinter.
---
Pig: Stays far enough away to use MYC. Even if they're in the open.
---
Clown: You're right tho
---
Spirit: This is also correct. Sadly :(
---
Legion: If they use Frank they're new. If they use Julie they're probably a dick. If they use Joe they want to look cool while being a dick. If they use Susie it's bcause Susie is bae (which is why I use Susie)
---
Plag: This is somewhat correct.
---
Ghostface: now that I think about, this is more correct than the LF one.
---
For the team!!!
---
I think this is what makes the toxicity go round.  It's unfortunate people have to act so childish. It really takes away from the fun of the game.
---
No, the perk is designed for the killer to choose. Either exposed or injured, risk and reward
---
Gen tapping wastes more time than just powering through Ruin.
---
I dont see how survivors are as strong as killers but if the killer is 4 times stronger than each survivor then that would cause the worst snowball. 
---
If a survivor is unable to loop the killer then they will just be downed, killed then it becomes a 3v1 with the killer being the power of 4. It would be impossible to win or escape as survivor.
---
You never said you went to find the hatch at any point. All you said was you slug because you want the 4k.
---
If that's the case then it's a confusing reference. Do you have a link to this by any chance?
---
That is badass. He should do all the killers!
---
It was more the 1337
---
A lot of that is map design and perk/item design
---
Great example for you, why is there two pallets side by side on the games basment area
---
But another issue a lot of killers have is mobility, all the top tier killers can zoom around, I feel I we gave that to all killers in one form or another it would fix a lot
---
Spine chill and iron will wreck her.
---
Hell, just iron will alone destroys spirit.  Spine chill makes anti mindgames easier.
---
God this post made me do an evil anime villain laugh
---
Link to what? Thats how the perk works if you let them unhook you "Make your choice" and either go for the healthy exposed survivor or the already hurt survivor. One gives you more points the other is scummy. There's no link for that.
---
u/PeterExplainsTheJoke
---
And NRA
---
When the meme is covered by the mematic watemark
---
And then they adrenaline away.
---
I'm referring to the Micheal who camped the basket all game.
---
Shirtless kate x Me.
---
Pop is almost s tier on mobile killers
---
I'm saying it's only logical to presume that if the devs are directly referencing a moment in the films where the victim is making a hard choice (e.g. Kill someone else so you can live) then that's what they're trying to replicate with the survivors. The licenced killers have to stay true to the source material both in look and gameplay. 
---
By the same logic, Remember Me is referencing the children remembering Freddy in the films. It's not talking about the killer remembering the survivor.
---
Of course it's a choice. When someone gets hooked, your computer doesn't take control from you and make the save, you choose to save them. You could also choose to do gens, totems etc.
---
People still make saves from the basement or during noed. You know when a hex is affecting you, this would be no different. Once you first get exposed by make your choice, does that stop you from future saves, because it doesn't stop me. Ballsy survivors will always be ballsy, regardless of the risk at hand. Immersed survivors will always prioritise themself first.
---
You are totally right
---
Red Paintbrush on original freddy is the sole reason I wish he wasn't changing.
---
Spectacular stuff! I know if he did a series (or even just a few killers) this community would love it.
---
And Adrenaline
---
First of all, you can add me if you want @Zhyrat
---
Second: as for Survivors it doesn't really matter. Claudettes Self cars is pretty good, Neas "Balanced Landing is good. But if you want a Survivor who has three always usable perks level Meg, she has good Perks for outrunning the killer. I main Nea but use only Balanced Landing from her. Look around and discover your playstyle. The rest is what perks you need for your style. 
---
Third: as for Killers it's a bit about control. You need training and good perks for Killers like Huntress, Nurse, Hillbilly (not much but at least some for handling) I recommend Killers like Hag, Spirit, Plague and Clown. I main Spirit and Huntress so I guess it's again discover your playstyle, use the perks that matches your style and good luck in the fog. 
---
If you still have questions or wanna play a round or two with me, you can add me. 
---
If I can't help you then... Git gud.
---
Damn, that really sucks man
---
Yes it is. Survivors working with killer is highly reportable.
---
This is **ultra beautiful**. Your dad has a very very good talent. 👍
---
A hag let me and another survivor go :) and I got to double pip
---
Oh this...this is beautiful
---
I actually love the ggs and memes and stuff, so now a days I spend a lot of time blocking cocky and salty players
---
Ace and Quentin didnt change much tbh
---
If it takes double the time, you aren't doing gens.
---
You're the one responding to me spewing nonsense.
---
Is stealth easy or skilled? You can't have both.
---
Or pay attention to the glass shards. If they light up then she is phasing...
---
The only thing worse than that is when you just casually walk through a pallet, and a survivor hides behind it, and throws it in your head
---
Its Boxface, run!
---
or just use a killer that can counter these loops or just walk away lol. and you aren't going to win every game
---
Yeah
---
Yep and that’s after i upgraded all my characters back.
---
I've gotten rank 1 many times, but this new emblem system is very unforgiving. Also pig and hag aren't bad killers at all.
---
Nice art!
---
User flair checks out.
---
OK OK EVERYONE THEN
---
Toxic survivors breed toxic killers &amp; vice versa. Tired of people that played like a holes for the entire round then complain when someone else treats them the same way
---
&gt;From what I can gather from what ya’ll have said is that cross-console won’t work because the field of view and visual advantage of players from Xbox and PlayStation means that switch players would be crushed
---
That is such fucking nonsense.
---
If it's a long loop, just keep looping, Doctor slows down massively while charging and his range is trash unless he runs add-ons, almost all the time he can't hit you after he shock you unless you messes up.
---
How many hours do you have?
---
He’s still hot
---
I know Hag is amazing. Pig is good but just doesn't have the consistent power of the higher tiers. She's very feast or famine based on map and luck.
---
David looks like a war vet holy crap
---
Stop responding to me with your brain dead rank 15 nonsense. No one said stealth was impossible, but is ineffective compared to keeping the killer busy. 
---
Learn to fucking read and stop responding to me.
---
&gt; They legally have to adhere to the movies
---
lol no they don't wtf are you talking about? For instance the Laurie Strode/Michael Myers lore in the game is different than the movies, fambamerino. 
---
Do you think Lions Gate was like "yeah you can use our characters BUT YOU FUGGIN BETTER USE EVERY QUOTE FROM THE MOVIES ULTRA MEGA GOOD"
---
lmao
---
&gt; Show me the evidence where they say they're talking about the killer
---
Where the fuck is ThE eViDeNcE that they're talking about survivors? The fucking perk belongs to the killer. ofc the instructions on it are referring to the killer. jesus fucking christ
---
I think more players play survivor on PC. Right now as killer I get fast qs but as survivor it's a minute q.
---
NOED isn't OP like some people say. It has a counter (cleansing dulls) and you don't need to go searching for dulls. If there's no known hex most won't cleanse HG. MYC doesn't have much of a counter. Just have to unhook when killer is nearby. Devour Hope can be cleansed at any point. It might not even get to the instadown part. Rancor has no counter except don't DS.
---
Stay brown ranks.

yeah survivor ranking is just mega fucky in general
---
Most of the times I’ve been disconnected as killer. With this issue lately, it’s been when the final generator is completed. My game locks up for a second and then kicks me to the ending screen for a second and then all the way back to the title screen. It frequently tells me I need a network connection for permission to use this service. When I do have a network connection and there’s nothing wrong with it. Happened when I closed the hatch once, happened a few times when final Gen is finished, happens within 5 minutes of the game loading in, etc. but it happens more often when something significant happens like last gen or end game. I actually stopped trying to play a few days ago because it’s so bad and a few of my friends have too until it’s fixed. Even playing KYF it kept happening to us.
---
I’m just going off of what I’ve been told my people who have played the game much longer than I have, so admittedly I don’t personally. Could you elaborate why you don’t think that’s true?
---
You can buy these perks in the shrine without leveling up the corresponding character
---
Hmm...I don't know. I mean, if we can have a bunch of messed up Canadian teens as killers, a guy in a sheet with glasses doesn't sound that far-fetched.
---
You get vault speed buffs too at T3 don't you?
---
If you were going to include Quentin you should've at least changed him a bit
---
This is amazing!! Crazy skills right there. He's pretty talented.
---
It’s random m8
---
I’m not a locker Dwight I promise!!!!
---
Impressive...... Most impressive.
---
Jeeez I wasn't ready for that... This is AWESOME, big up to your Daddy !!!
---
ok?
---
Meh
---
Damn you rank reset!!!
---
I meant just in terms of the movie, we already definitely have some joke skins like panda nurse, cowboy billy, etc. so the sheet Myers would definitely be fine. I'd rock that shit.
---
It's from r/imsorryjon
---
I wouldn't call A a bad habit per se, but you shouldn't prioritize that too much. You could get in a situation where you over defend those gens and don't get enough hooks by the time the survivors reach the 3 gen phase and you'll have trouble stopping them even though the gens are close
---
honestly i don't even know when i last used a 3 gen strat
---
Wow you're triggered. The evidence is in the films, go watch them and tell me where the iconic phrase "make your choice" refers to the Jigsaw killer.
---
When I say legally, I don't think you understand how licencing works. Why isn't there a cosmetic for Myers in a pink tutu? As epic as that would be, it would damage the image of the character. To create cosmetics or the back story, they have to run this by the licence holder. It would be illegal to create anything without their permission if it relates to their product. Why do you think the Saw cosmetics have only just dropped? Why do you think they aren't random and actually tie into the movies?
---
Stop being ignorant. I'm not starting an argument, but ignorance should not rule over reasonable thought.
---
watch streamers/youtubers play, see what works best for them, whether it’s learning how to loop or learning survivors’ movements and mindgaming. it’s helped me get better at the game immensely, as survivor and killer. have patience w the game and try your best to have fun, ik it can be hard at times lol
---
Have been doing that build for the last days, never got a green key out of chests. Got a bunch of skeleton keys though
---
Kira
---
Looks like a ZomBillie
---
I mean it doesn't do too much vs Nurse since she relies on line of sight, it does as much against her as other killers.
---
Against any killer that isn't spirit, Iron will is mostly helpful when you're mindgaming a loop and the killer can't tell your position/hiding.
---
Panda nurse?
---
Nope. 3 gen rule is good for preventing time loss. And sluging the 2nd to last is good to prevent getting through hatch that i pretty much always do it. But you gotta consider unbreakable bc that can change things drastically
---
How recently did you pick up the game?
---
These were babies tho with one perk each. Figured they were new players rolling with the Rank 9.
---
Revolutionary. Thank you for sharing, OP!
---
me: *doesn't get unhooked and dies*
---
How long did it take you to reach your soil point and is it better to start with survivor or killer?
---
If their was a basketball dbd game spinoff but in your good art style I would buy it but great art tho
---
While a DS is nice and all, you better have a damn good plan of escape or you just wasted a hook phase.
---
Bond and as an exhaustion perk use DH if you are good or at least decent at looping, if not, use Lithe (Balanced is really good but the map RNG can screw you over especially when you get caught and you're way too far from a hill)

Ah yes. A pristine depiction of Mountainous William.
---
Thx a lot for that one.
---
Huh weird, thats the only thing that i can see working on our favor if one day some humans were teleported to the entity's realm, other then that were pretty fucked in the arse
---
All they have to do is stop or considerably reduce the entity progression for the person on the hook.
---
what are you trying to show us?
---
I wonder if it’d be any good on Nurse too seeing as she’s slow as it is... idk I want to learn to play Nurse but I just can’t get the hang of it.
---
Ahaha true. Its one of the main reasons i dont really play survivor. Is because i only get dudes who farm points, dc or are just stupid potatoes.
---
as far as i can notice, no viewer of pewdiepie is edgy, literally all of his fanbase encouraged him to play minecraft and make a whole series about it putting names to every animal he encounters and people on reddit making posts to help him on his playthrough at the same time as people drawing epic and cute fanart about his minecraft pets, looks like you still think were on 2016, also its than not then
---
Made a couple friends from the Xbox DBD community seeing comments like that puts a smile on my face

I know Otzdarva made a video about which survivor to start off with, so I recommend watching that video

At the end of the day facecamping is bullshit and yes the devs should do something about it but wanna know the best way to punish the killer as of right now? Do gens. If survivors do gens then chances are he gets a 1k, hardly any BP and a depip. Too many face campers get away with it because no one does gens because they are all around the hook. Is it fun for the person on hook? Fuck no, but at least they don't die in vein.
---
Nurse is kind of weak, you def should play top tier killers like Leatherface or Doctor. 
---
anyway, if you wanna stick with Nurse, her best build is Bamboozle, Brutal Strength, Spirit Fury and Enduring.
---
Unrelenting is kind of a training wheels perk for new killers. Really you should work on not whiffing at all since the higher you climb in the ranks the more survivors will punish you for missing a strike. They know killers need to go through awkward animations and stun phases after a hit and they will abuse the hell out of it to escape, body block, unhook people right in front of your face, etc etc.
---
And remove Benevolence penalties for other survivors
---
They’re a good source of fibre
---
You know everyone started out like you. The problem is that the stealth strat is just bad, because:
---
 1. when you get found you are probably giving the killer the first hit for free, if he has a one shot you are just dead. 
---
2. Crouching in a corner is not that much more exciting for most people.
---
3. You are giving 3 other persons time to do gens. You got to decide either you spent your time doing gens or you hide you can't do both at the same time.
---
I never said that you can't play immersed and hide in a corner but it's just plain bad and any semi decent killer would destroy 4 immersed survs. It's just a bad game plan.
---
Fair. I play both
---
It's a noob perk, that's all. As in it helps noobs but is worthless if you know how to play the game.
---
THAT SAID, it's completely fine to use and can be very helpful if you're new to the game, don't be ashamed to use it.
---
Stuff like this always reminds me of Dark Souls, were the pros practically don't wear any armor and heavy armor is considered "noobish" cause all the pros are like "jUsT dOnT gEt HiT iN tHe fIrSt PlAcE". Which, I mean, is fair, if you're good enough to not get hit then armor just ways you down, but newbies are going to get hit. 
---
Just like newbies are going to miss strikes in this case
---
Buy a print screen button with it
---
Ohhhh I like that. After 15 seconds (or whatever) of facecamping, the entity progression just stops. That’s an easy fix.
---
This is such a selfish attitude to have, whether you’re a killer or a survivor you should still try to be a good player and treat others how you would like to be treated.
---
Remember that there’s human beings behind the characters on-screen, and they just want want to have fun like you.
---
Nurse and Spirit = OP.
---
SWF = balanced.
---
I have the worst of both worlds: I feel like every other game as killer I get a 4-man swf party, and every survivor game I play has me playing with potatoes.
---
You know what i would do? I think i would just let them kill me every time. I sure as hell cant  keep running forever, i can barely change a light bulb, let alone a generator and i dont have any healing capabilities. I would just let the entity take piece by piece of my soul until i get the sweet release from death.
---
I try but when we got 5 gens or someshit and a guy gets hooked once dces because they're salty they fuck everybody else but the killer up.
---
Don’t forget about the add ons
---
I want a water sheep survivor
---
The solution is to play minecraft on mobile  instead
---
Kindred, decisive, bond, and maybe an exhaustion perk. Especially Head On that ones my fav. If you do run that trade out decisive with quick and quiet
---
Obviously the entity would have to progress normally if another survivor is in the range of what is considered camping to prevent them from abusing it but yeah it would be an easy solution.
---
you should play the way you wanna be played against. i guess if you don't mind if you get facecamped when you play survivor, then by all means
---
That's me too lmao. That or i get matched with rank 6 survivors as a rank 13-14 killer.
---
Maybe make completed gens give points to *all* survivors?
---
I like the game it's a good map for survivors because it's way easy to lose the killer in the basement thanks to all those walls. Helps get rid of nurses too since the whole stare down to reduce distance thing will take them to the basement instead. Only thing I don't like is the hooks are too close. I just don't like playing Myers on that map because it makes it hard to stalk with all the walls. I mostly get Lery"s or MacMillan estate anyways
---
Im excited. Also i followed your insta i love your style
---
Nice post, just some advice though, "you're going on Reddit" is pretty cringey.
---
Bit of context, the guy drops a pallet on my head then slaps his ass on the ground a multitude of times. Granted I did send the first message as I found it funny, but his replies are pure gold 🤣
---
Yeah well it was my first match of the day and all I could see was blood. LOL
---
No I don’t mind In fact I yell at my team to not unhook me and to just get the gens done and make sure the killer gets 0 blood points. I get that it’s not fun for the person being faced camped but it’s also not the killers responsibility to make sure u have fun
---
But what if her vomit has some nasty pieces of food she ate earlier?
---
Haha nice :D
---
He’s behind you
---
I play it on my switch and this is gonna be the same when dbd comes to switch.
---
I guess it's hard to notice.
---
How is it still not fixed?
---
Same, it got old ages ago, and even then I didn't enjoy it.

If he’s on Xbox, you can uninstall DLC separately from the game itself and reinstall it.

Incels, It's Obviously Legion
---
Woooooah that's siiiick
---
Dead hard. Don't use to dodge hits, use it to extend loops.
---
how the fuck do you have fun camping your survivors? fuck off.
---
Telling by these comments nobody like pewdiepie and their reasons do make sense as well but still making a small decent game into a large game can be a bad idea since the devs are already dealing with server problem and other stuff into the game and bringing more people can possibly can overwork the devs and BHVR like how fortnite had problems like that (using fortnite as a example) and you seen the pewdiepie fan base like how someone hacked into printers to say subscribe to pewdiepie and if someone hacks into BHVR we’ll possibly lose our game. I like pewdiepie but still but bringing the fan base can bring a lot of cons instead of pros. So this is why we shouldn’t bring the pewdiepie fan base here.
---
Damn good drawing, your dad is awesome man
---
Hatch bra
---
Oh I meant another perk that has that ability but I dont know it's name 😅 They still camp but at a range that you become exposed due to their perk and then they go kill you and camp you from I distance. Like face camping but not. I do counter BBQ now cos its so strong if you dont! 
---
I might need to watch how people outplay Bubba cos he seems super tough with his high mobility and flexibility 1 hit ability. 
---
Bruh in my last game the killer focused me and my friend, teabagged us, mori'd us and didn't to our team mates. He then messaged me that's what I get for teabagging at the gate. So yes. I'm still getting sh"t for this clip, even in game 😹💀 The last comments I got have been finding the toxic commentators silly.
---
why are u desperate to prove your point
---
I find it funny that ever since samination made the survivor rule book skit, there’s been a lot more “killers are bad” posts. Looks like a nerve has been struck
---
Sorry but I’m not sacrificing a 4K as Freddy so some Meg can escape and I get karma points for being a “non toxic part of the dbd community” frankly it’s stupid how many people get angry because the killer didn’t complete their goal and instead drop them off at the hatch because that’s what they want and they need to get their way. I know what I did was bad but the Meg came up to me and tried to farm just because she was the last survivor, no one dced and I fairly won as Freddy. In my opinion people who get angry at killers for not giving them hatch are worse than any toxicity (par facecamping) for the community
---
Do you even math?
---
I see nothing wrong here.
---
I hate self are unless I'm playing killer. Purely because it wastes so much time. Take a med kit, get teammates to heal you but selfcare users get so dependant on healing and it ends up benefiting killers. I run adrenaline, resilience, iron will and dead hard. That way if I am injured I can make it work for the team and adrenaline will give me the heal when it really matters.
---
i just don't get what the post is i guess
---
tbh the "reacts" thing is kind of an obnoxious buzzword at this point but i couldn't think of a better title, it's a shame so many people are writing the video off before watching it because of that though
---
huh i didn't know that
---
After the rank reset I was put at 14 and I've only gotten back to 13 and either I am getting paired with people that haven't already gotten back to their original rank, or there is a big disparity between my level and who I'm getting matched with.
---
You will never lick his abs. NEVER.
---
You're unworthy.
---
(Is this too much?)
---
Bit of context, he dropped a pallet on my head before slapping his ass on the ground a multitude of times. So while I did send the first message, his replies are next level, oh yeah, it’s big brain time.
---
I never said u have fun face camping 😂 that’s the opposite of what I said actually
---
lol okay well i hope your team ignores you they can get some altruism points and benevolence emblem progress rather than depipping despite escaping
---
I'm on the same timeline as the guy you're talking to, I have almost 60 hours into it now and I'm still shit at survivor but can usually get 4k's as killer. Solo survivor is ROUGH. 
---
I think killer is easier to start with, that said, the times were I improve the most is when I take a break from killer/survivor and play the other side. Getting that perspective is very helpful
---
As a survivor main: use Spine Chill. She’s not bullshit, you just have to learn how to counter her.
---
Shaming another player and the player as a whole for using a particular perk is bad, and not something I believe should stay under the guise of free speech. 
---
Talking about a specific type/set of perk(s) in a civil way and *why* you don’t like it, should. It’s not a matter of trying to overly censor anything, it’s a matter of keeping things civil and not bullying or harassing others all because you didn’t like the perk that they happened to use in that screenshot.
---
I mean sorry, I thought he was still a big name.
---
You are not required to escape to "win" the trial as survivor. Though it gives a bunch of BP ofc. Also you can blame the team lel.
---
As you play killer, you have no one to shift a blame on (except swf maybe) and 3-4k is the victory condition which can be way harder against good survivors.
---
Its either a bug with the last update or he missed up the timing as i pallet saved vs a hag with SF and she dropped the survivor while breaking the pallet at the same time
---
i'm talking about killers, as a killer how do you have fun just being a camping bumass?
---
10/10 would smash
---
In case anyone need this
---
A good way to mitigate this is by running Save the Best for Last (particularly on M1-only killers). Not only will it reward you for getting hits, it stops bullshit that the survivors can do to abuse the successful hit cooldown, and makes chases significantly shorter.
---
They keep downvoting but it’s whatever dude. Everyone teabags. I can assure you that. Idk why these people are all acting high and mighty.
---
Thanks. Never thought on using bond
---
thats the weird minority theres obviously going to be people like that with 97 million subs, ok i guess i used "literally" in a wrong but still yall be saying that all the fanbase i edgy when thats not true
---
It's taken a few week since he's spread it out, he's putting it in a frame for me to hang up.

Killers run Noed like survivors run dead hard, adrenaline ect. Because they are 2nd chances at winning.

---
If your internet disconnects often enough that it affects the outcome of games, you need to call your ISP or replace your hardware (router/modem etc). Or stop playing on wifi like an imbecile.
---
The game is still far from balanced but it's much closer now than it has ever been. Trouble is all the cry babies do is bitch and moan and then BHVR cater to them. That's why at red ranks it's all spirits and nurses because most of the other killers aren't good enough against good teams at high ranks.
---
4 kill, killed all 4 survivors
---
Oh yes, forgot that. FD exists though.
---
Are you gonna get it done by your dad cause this looks like a tattoo artist did it lol
---
I've had a guy in game focus me, tea bag me, Mori me then message me "Its what you get for teabagging at the exit gate" so yes they are definitely more toxic than I am 😹 I dont send hate mail like all these nasty people. Their down votes dont mean anything either, doesn't effect me 💞

Don’t forget Doctors with level 2 Ruin! Like he said, the least skilled role in this world with the least skilled killer 🤣 if I was using the impossible skill check build with a mori I’d understand, but hey, I guess I’m just that good! /s

Yeah totally 😂
---
YEET
---
Here’s my base build(it does not have self care) and I’m always able to easily get to rank 1 using it: Spine Chill(Informational), balanced landing(exhaustion and arguably the best exhaustion perk), decisive strike(Anti-Tunnel), and adrenaline to assure your victory once all the gens are done.

I don't belive that all of poopiepie's fanbase is a bunch of toxic gamer's with capital G's, but when youre fans fucked up so many times(and probably keep fucking it up) i raise both of my eyebrowns, especially when you have someone that says your name before a shooting. But props to you and the others who are pretty chill about him and dont go after a kid that doesn't know who Keanu is
---
ok but that looks cool they should make a 2 v 9 game mode or something the extra survivor would be because 2 killers could corner survivors which would suck
---
Might wanna wait and see how the Freddy rework is Tuesday.
---
That's  Make Your Choice. MYC =  when X meters away from survivor on hook, the unhooker gets exposed status. LF is easy to outplay for me. He's slightly slower when revving his chainsaw but his chainsaw is hard to hit if you aren't good at him.
---
LUCKY YOU! In my most recent game, there was a tunneling Ruin Nurse and Jane that farmed everyone to death. Whenever Jane unhooked someone, the killer went straight for whoever got unhooked while the Jane ran off  to hide. He didn't go for Jane at all until all except me and Jane were alive. She slugged me then went looking for Jane. Nurse needs a rework so shes not as hard on controller but not as easy on KBM
---
What’s even the point in posting this? There’s no names, no context, didn’t show points or even a video. It’s just here-say. Nothing.
---
Did you just post this to spam up the forums and complain ? Everyone has bad games, doesn’t mean you have to post it every time you do.
---
its not like they could find if a survivor has been stuck somewhere or if a killer has been standing somewhere near a survivor for an extended period of time right? yeah they would just always have collisions disabled
---
1) If the killer gets close enough to you  to hit you before you're leaving, you've already failed. Stealth is not sitting still and definitely isn't sitting and waiting for the killer to hit you.
---
2) You should never be crouching in a corner. Crouching in a corner is not stealth. There is no objective in a corner and no way out from a corner.
---
3) You can absolutely do gens without getting spotted. All it takes is strong situational awareness. In fact, it's a million times easier than doing gens while in a chase. 4 people doing gens is faster than 3 people doing gens, even if you have to take a 10 second break every minute or so. If you can be doing gens, it's better to be doing gens than dragging a chase out.
---
4) "Immerssed" is a word angry streamers use to shift blame for screwing up. "Immersed" is not stealth. Hiding is not stealth. Crouching in a corner is not stealth  Stealth is doing the objectives efficiently without getting caught. It is viable at all ranks, depending on the killer, assuming you're skilled enough to pull it off. In fact, it is easily more effective than looping vs a Nurse.
---
If you're not on a gen, that's because the killer is actively searching your area, which wastes just as much time as a chase, but let's you get back on your gen faster or switch to another gen faster than being in a chase does.

Really, no matter what, either side is gonna push blame on anything other than their bad play. If Survs played badly, it was because Noed Endfury tunneler camper metawhore Billy/Spirit/Nurse, if Killer plays badly it's because DS DH Sprint Burst Medkit Instaheal Flashlight SWF teabaggers.

Look at the killers perks. She plays the easiest PC killer but runs Ruin and NOED (which killers rarely have in red and purple ranks)

You praise the Entity you didn’t get a Billy, Nurse or Spirit and loop the fuck out of him. At least that’s what a good survivor would do.
---
Two got away, i killed another survivor with three hooks. Don’t try to trash me and go 99 some hooks instead.
---
Killer and the top survivor might have been working together. Happened to me once and it sucks  but I there'se basically nothing you can do . I hate that people can farm and always get away with it. The killer will probably let it happen since its another free hook and the survivor that is farming just gets free bloodpoints.
---
 The people trying to play normally get punished by no fault of their own, but by their teammate's greed this is probably why people run DS
---
I admittedly did dismiss it because of that, I'll give it a watch in a bit!
---
&gt;when you have someone that says your name before a shooting
---
thats obviously made so that pewds gets a bad name, the shooter knew it would look bad in pewds part, he probably hates pewdiepie, the thing about the shooter had been brought so many times but it is so obvious that it doesnt even matter and that the shooter knew it would hurt pewds reputation
---
It’s two minutes flat to do gens. If three people work on three gens, then evade the killer well, it’s going to hurt the killer more. It will only secure one or two kills. It’s not even that good of a strategy
---
If you already have him, you can't buy him again.Try doing a hard reset on your console or clear your cache to see if that works
---
"Assaigned Dwight at birth"
---
Woops lol
---
Coming from a killer main it’s not just “toxic high ranks” it’s toxic survivors period. How would you feel if you were a killer and dealt with tbagging, flashlights, and intentionally playing a way to make your experience less fun. Killers don’t have it easy in this game. They actually have it harder then survivors do. Which in my opinion shouldn’t happen in a game based on killers hunting survivors.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Still bannable.
---
I love the idea though I fear this thread will not be well received veterans don't like drastic changes like that, they just want their pallets and loops
---
Is that confirmed to be happening?
---
its just a silly party game dude relax and have fun. people take this shit way too seriously, maybe go play some Civilisation if you are not having fun. its a good game.
---
Tell your dad Reddit thinks he's a fucking legend
---
Ah I guess you don't get escape bloodpoints but you do get an iridescent escape emblem score.
---
I love this. I've actually screamed this same thing
---
Quentin looks like someone ran over his face with a truck.
---
Depends on the person behind the screen. I really chill more when playing survivor and with killer I put my best in it except when i come across potatoes and can relax a bit.
---
Did you bag the killer before you escaped?
---
Myers base kit seems much stronger. With no add ons you can easily snowball an entire round.
---
Maybe it’s my lack of experience with GF, but I just don’t find him all that great. His stalks are really fucking hard to get off so it seems like a waste of time to do it. The amount of time you spend trying to expose a survivor you can just run up and smack them. Maybe it’s because I played Myers for so long and I just haven’t gotten my GF groove yet.
---
Explanation of the game: The Nurse was tunneling everyone off hook when she realized the Jane was farming everyone off the hook. We only got 3 gens done because of this. She didn't even go for the Jane until all but me and Jane were left alive.  She waited for Jane to unhook me then slugged me to look for Jane (who hid near me waiting for the killer to leave) resulting in both of us dying. We might've gotten out if everyone commited to the generators instead of hitting a regular skill  check (with ruin) then running to a different gen.
---
Wraith’s *w i d e* body is actually also amazing for blocking people against gens to get a free hit.
---
For consoles, yes. If you already have it Unlocked you won't need to get his teachables but if it's not on you character then you have to level him up.
---
The dipshit Blendette crouching in a corner doesn't deserve a single fucking BP I gained doing gens.
---
thanks bud! actually worked for a while on this and i think it's the kind of thing i'd enjoy even if i wasn't responsible for it; let me know what you think!
---
I’ve played as killer before and have faced survivors who use flashlights, run me the ENTIRE game, and tbag me... and I have never disconnected. It is frustrating, just as frustrating as going against a killer who runs Hex Ruin, a mori, Noed, tunnels, camps and tbags. I personally think killers have a bigger advantage in this game than survivors do, 🤷‍♂️
---
Hmm were you playing Hag?
---
That's a pretty good curve ngl.
---
Such a cool drawing! Your dad is amazing
---
&gt;tells me to stfu, and brags how 10 alt accounts subbing to his channel is good
---
&gt;tells me to grow up
---
She killed Jane  when me and her were the last two alive after the slugging me and nodding at me to rub it in we lost and she won (basically the killer version of teabagging end of game). She slugged me whenever she could probably because she went to my reddit and saw I had Decisive. No idea how Jane is rank 5 with all that farming, probably because the killers always do the same thing in her games, let her get away with unhook farming.
---
I’m sorry for being toxic, I just can’t help it but baby dwights are an exception because awwwww look at the way he slow vaults during a chase
---
360s arent nearly as good as they were when killers didnt know how to counter them
---
Spine chill doesn't counter her, she can just face backwards and fake teleport the same way.
---
Only if they’re looking down mid chase
---
But shes asian...
---
Apple a day
---
I’ve literally never seen a killer so that not even once but k.
---
Apple a day keeps the p3 doctor away
---
I hear about the both of those, usually in combination all the damn time. Usually it's talked about in a similar manner to NOED; being a bad killer crutch for people who can't chase well and can't work around pallets.
---
Unrelenting is pretty much a bad perk on any killer.
---
BTW: I had a "Huntress is on the hunt" banner when reading this thread...it looks weird.
---
Yeah, not sure why I got downvoted. There's no way she could've get away even if adrenaline healed 2 health states
---
It's strange though, because a lot of the 'Nurse is OP' talk gets upvoted but Spirit gets a free pass
---
Name is still there under bloodpoint total
---
Again, what’s the point? You’re complaining about a killer using perks and addons intended to be used? Are you just hoping for other survivors to come in and chime in with the “baby killer” comments? So what? This kind of stuff happens all the time, it’s nothing new to DBD.
---
But you have no ed
---
I don’t know man. With all the new killers and survivors, you’re gonna be grinding bloodpoints for thousands of game hours. It’s really a ridiculously, outdated system that completely fucks new players. That being said, it’s not as bad of a grind for survivors if you intend to be a survivor main. If you’re a killer main, you’re completely fucked.
---
If it doesn’t bother you not having meta perks for a very long time, go for it. It can be a pretty fun game.
---
The problem with this is that ''endless'' loop can be countered if you are skilled enough . You just need to mind game the survivor. You just CAN'T counter camping since well... HE CAN'T ESCAPE...
---
What's not fixed?
---
The toxic players will bring, flashlights, a sack of batteries, and pieces of sharp wood just in case they get picked up.
---
Thats a one time down, at the end of the game on oen conditinoal survivor. MoM was every game for free, adding an extra minute to chases sometimes
---
This has not happened to me in so long, it's basically a non-issue.
---
No one needs your scam and spam. Go away
---
Huh? Am I that famous? How do you know that? 😭😄😂
---
Should've lel
---
He is
---
&gt;No one says NOED is "agaisnt the rules"
---
What are you talking about? Tons of survivor mains on here endlessly bitch about how upset they are after dying to NOED. There are several accounts created just to post on every post mentioning NOED to shriek about how trash the killer must be for running it.
---
&gt;wink
---
;)
---
&gt;That and maybe i don't know giving a shout out to a white supremacist channel on yt,
---
the thing that happened there was that pewdiepie shoutwd out like 20 channels and the last one had racist and nazi jokes but he only promoted 2 videos which were about death note "he does anime reviews" thats what he saw and after all that he admited that he was careless and had to check the channels he promoted before promoting them
---
I saw it on your steam profile
---
Strange, but interesting.
---
Well you find a way to escape him and you ''snap out of it''
---
He said the N word when he was frustrated, if the first thing that comes to your mind when you're frustrated is THAT word, there's something else
---
Nazis liking him is true... but Nazis like alot of things
---
I forgot sorry I think it was a recent stream or event but they basically said they will come up with a season system and your rank will be reset every season not month.
---
I always see this kind of comment and wonder if we're even playing the same game. Lol. The amount of camping I have to deal with at red ranks is actually disgusting. It's why I love rank reset; I finally get games where the killer doesn't sit nearby admiring my beauty.
---
holy crap, I want to practice now.  That looks like it might be doable solely because of the seats.  Also billy has the ability to turn a lot deeper into objects on his right side (almost none on his left) so this looks like it really skirts the line between someone who REALLY knew what they were doing, and just game fuckery.
---
Common sense? on the internet? get out while you still can!
---
Anyone who tries this "change my mind" bullshit is stuck in their ways and is never going to actually change their mind.
---
Amazing how these crying fucks always say bullshit like "Huur dur, I'm r1 kiLLeR" when they are clearly lying
---
Pretty sure you can't make any of those skins uglier.
---
*Uno reverse card*
---
No. Bad habits are respecting pallets with Enduring, running straight to your Ruin totem or consistently giving survivors an advantage because you want to “play fair”.
---
You’re fine.
---
I just had to put in my word because I don’t like it being generalized to all killer mains when I am one myself. I do think dc’ing should be a bannable offense but I can’t say that I haven’t dc’ed before after dealing with insanely toxic survivors when I first started.
---
Yeah, it's known, and I believe it's supposed to be fixed in this patch.
---
If he was really rank 1 killer (which he got in 6 DAYS btw, what a god!) he wouldn’t be saying the game is killer advantaged lmao, I don’t know who he thinks he’s fooling 🤣
---
He just out a filter on the photos with face app, it's not like he did the art himself.
---
Not saying it's bad or lazy content, just that it's not as special as you're making it out to be.
---
Fuck, I really wanted to be a huntress main.
---
You want killers to get banned because of a bug they have no control over?
---
It's true
---
Nice bait
---
Dbd is a fairly simple game my friend. You may like to hide, but please don't try to tell people that it's either viable or good. As you said the theme of the game is to hide from a killer. Good players broken out of the mind set "I got to hide from this killer". I know what a surv and a killer can do and you claiming looping doesn't take skill and you shouldn't  deliberately extend chases makes it clear to every surv at high ranks that you are simply not that good yet. Obviously running up to the killer and clicking your flashlight isn't good either and you still claim that 4 people could do gens while saying that you would hide while he is searching your area. Please choose one of the two.
---
I’m pretty sure your mind can’t comprehend such things that require an actual brain to think of worse skins.
---
Do people at red ranks not know that you loose emblems or whatever if you camp?
---
I don’t know if it lasts that long, but a good thing to know that for a few moments after starting sprint, Billy has a way better turning radius before it becomes hard to turn again.
---
he said after that he said it to himself but i guess that doesnt change things now
---
Hitboxes would be irrelevant since killers would just grab and shank the shit out of people.
---
That's exactly my build as well. They should take self care out of the game, goddamn is so fucking annoying to be hooked and seeing all these useless teammates self caring in a corner of the map only to be hit again because they can't loop for shit.
---
lmao, none of you are getting the point of the post. I'm right. Survivors have never directly been nerfed, since they're all the same. The only things that have been nerfed are things around the survivors, like maps and perks.
---
I think the Entity would be confused. Thousands of people *willingly* enter its realms and start causing mass chaos purely for their own entertainment.
---
This. Exactly this.
---
Every ghostface I got against: Brings franklins when there was only one brown medkit with a gauze roll, "oh wait, haha I DO want to farm with the survivors my bad :)", or the game just started about 20 seconds ago but I fucking hate this one survivor in particular.
---
I can't stand team mates like that!!! I've started muting them so I know to find a different lobby. Why doesn't everyone run borrowed time or unhook smart???? I wonder if the Nurse left Jane alive cos she knew Jane was dumb enough to f the team over.. Or maybe Jane was a double agent 👀🔪
---
Tell your dad this is awesome!
---
It has a passive component that is relevant on a fair amount of maps, and only really has like 1-2 maps where it's hard to trigger consistently.
---
Wow okay thank you so much, sounds like killer might be easier to start then
---
Don't tunnel.
---
Don't camp
---
Don't  slug
---
Whenever someone gets hooked, you must hide in the corner of the map even when there are players nearby.
---
You can't hook survivors more than 2 times. Any more means you're a tryhard. 
---
Don't go Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Ghostface, Hag, Clown, Plague, Legion, Pig, Leatherface, Doctor, Huntress, Wraith, or  Trapper. You must go Myers and Myers only.
---
Don't run NOED, Ruin, Nurses Calling, Thanatophobia, Devour Hope, Blood Warden, Remember Me, Bamboozle, Pop Goes the Weasel, Corrupt Intervention, Discordance, Spirit Fury, Haunted Grounds, Rancor, Make Your Choice, Barbecue And Chili, Franklin's Demise, Knock Out, Overcharge, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Furtive Chase, Thrilling Tremors, Play With Your Food, Dying Light, Save The Best For Last, Agitation, Tinkerer, Unnerving Presence, Huntresses Lullaby, or Hangmans Trick.
---
If you play any of the forbidden killers, don't run any perks or addons.
---
You shall not run any cosmetics.
---
No nodding, teabagging, or Mori spamming.
---
Scratch that, the only Mori allowed is a yellow Mori
---
If a survivor wants to farm, you must farm. No exceptions.
---
You must open the gate when the survivors get every gen done.
---
It’s an add on and they spawn in the bloodweb pretty often. Not long at all, but they are consumable. Also, if you are playing Huntress you definitely don’t want to rely on Iri heads because they are arguably the best add on in the game for killer.
---
That is sick! Must have been a bear shading all of that in!
---
Thank you, i will try these rules !
---
I'm surprised that Nurse such an issue yet they haven't needed her, at least for PC. They must know it's an issue
---
Nah send the tunnelers first
---
Yea pretty much
---
Not a direct nerf to survivors.
---
Very nice
---
Using your technicality, you should’ve just said “it’s a healing nerf”. Would’ve been equally as dodgy but actually make sense, as they didn’t specify self care.
---
Then yea, I can’t think of one
---
The killer felt sorry for you and you got lucky.For one game. Hope you enjoy it.The next killer you face will not show any mercy on you
---
its because they’re mobile
---
I want this on my wall
---
Thank you so much that's so kind of you! I'll definitely add you tomorrow it would be good to not always solo queue. 
---
I think you're right I should probably rotate a few before deciding who to level. It's just knowing there's such a grind I don't want to waste time and bp but I guess I don't really need to since I can try out their perks on those characters before getting them teachable
---
This isn't really an unpopular opinion at all. Not with a majority of this community. They may not agree that they're the absolute worst types of players but they'll at least agree that they're close to it.
---
Killers don’t need to stop DCing, everyone needs to stop DCing. It’s a ridiculous trend that plagues this game. IDC if you’re a survivor or a killer, if you DC because you are losing, you are bad.
---
Agree
---
nah the terror radius can get confusing cause they could be either above or below you
---
....
---
......
---
.........
---
DEJA VU
---
😂
---
Or Civ 5
---
Use bond, is much more versatile. If you know where your teammates are you can get a lot of advantages from this. For example you can get healed by them, you can known where the killer is just watching if one of your team mates around you is chased, you can go help a team mate with a gen and when someone get hooked you can also know if a survivor is already going for the save so you don't waste time and keep doing the gen. Honestly after 1000+ hours I have all the perks I want for survivor and I never use self care. My build is bond,dead hard,adrenaline,Ds. Sometimes I use borrowed instead of bond but I bring a med.
---
Id buy a beer for your dad anytime! Thanks for sharing too :3 ggez
---
Iron Will makes healing less of a necessity.
---
you can't do two killers in kyf lol
---
He’s gone to fight the entity
---
I thought that was me
---
Until I saw M1
---
I’m referring to Leatherface cause I was playing a match where I facecamped a Laurie for the sake of it
---
Yup, however survivors can no longer be grabbed while jumping into the hatch
---
Tell your dad that his art work is too good
---
No thanks, i just menaged to clean my recommended videos from his minecraft lets play and meme reaction vids, im not going to mess with yt's broken algorithm again
---
I want to point out that this is a single perk which has no cooldown and completely invalidates a killers entire power on pallets and infinitely more through any number of matches.
---
Now imagine this survivor has iron will, dead hard and decisive. How do you win against that build as any killer? Pretty insane the complete imbalance in this competitive ranked matchmaking game.
---
Darn, you're right. Well, mistakes can be made, this is my first time doing this kind of thing after all.
---
It’s bannable
---
Platform?
---
I forgot how ugly that filter is.
---
False. They have been directly nerfed. (Yes I know you posted this before I told you about the falling stun, but that’s the price to pay for saying this as an absolute)
---
It's nearly impossible to not get complaints from salty survivor mains 
---
(Although some mains that outrank you by alot may decide to give you some pointers)
---
One time when I was playing killer they only had one gen done and I killed one of the survivors and I DC because it was way too laggy and some Jane message me saying that I was a camper even though I never camped it's honestly funny sometimes when they come up with the most random shit ever to try and get to your head.
---
Have you ever watched one of Steven Crowders Change My Minds? He puts them up so he can have a debate with people. This guy wants to debate with people
---
I do this to make it easier to catch the buggers with adrenaline.
---
I’m not a programmer, but I’m not sure a phone would be up to the task of being host to a five player game?
---
Maybe reduce her distance she can teleport? Or unable to lunge after she teleports so she's got to be super precise? I guess they just gave up on it :(
---
Unless you dont run NOED I'm perfectly fine with how anyone plays tbh
---
Leatherface needs to be changed so that he isn’t a worse billy, and actually has different Addons and and ability that can be used more often rather than only in chase or for facecamping, and pigs addons need to be changed as a lot of them hurt you or are useless, and her ability needs to be less luck based, you can lose an entire match because the survivors got lucky with taking their trap off fast
---
You are a killer, why the hell do you need to follow the morale rules of these filthy survivors
---
It's a known bug. I can't really see it unless I pay attention tho.
---
Well, it's not even meh. Meh would be like 500k BP or 2000 shards for Devotion. It is currently insulting, in being nothing.
---
I'm not sure how the contracts work, either, but it seems like six of one, half dozen of the other to give away auric cells.
---
This is good.  The sooner you get away from running Self Care the better off you'll be in the long run.  That perk is such a waste of time and encourages really bad prioritization when it comes to decision making.  
---
Build wise I always recommend Adrenaline so you aren't afraid to repair instead of heal yourself out of habit.  Dead Hard to extend chases and loops and also to help counter campers a bit.  Decisive to punish campers and tunnelers.  And for the 4th I mix it up but typically roll with either Bond, Hope, Balanced or We're gonna live forever.
---
David and Jake because they're hot.
---
It's less that people respect you and more that people hate going against a broken killer, man
---
No it's not..
---
Top 10 Survivor’s Rules for Killers
---
1. No perks
---
2. Never hook survivors
---
3. After hooking a survivor, make sure you are 100 metres away within the next millisecond. If not you are a camper
---
4. No breaking pallets or damaging gens
---
5. If a survivor makes a mistake you must let them go
---
6. You can never chase an injured survivor. No exceptions.
---
7. List of killers you can’t play as: Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse, Hag, Doctor, Shape, Legion, Clown, Cannibal, Spirit, Pig, Nightmare, Plague, Ghost Face, Huntress
---
8. When a survivor attempts to blind you with a flashlight you must allow them to do so. No exceptions.
---
9. If you chase a survivor more than once you are tunnelling and must allow every survivor to escape.
---
10. If any survivor disconnects at any point you must allow the others to escape.
---
I hope windows 7 has that :(
---
I didn't think it was true until I saw a Legion farming a Survivor before repeatedly hitting the last one on hook. Maybe I just don't belong here.
---
10/10 troll response.  God tier Nurse build for sure.
---
The only time I’ve ever despised playing on The Game was when I was playing as Hillbilly for a daily ritual. His chainsaw sprint is almost useless on that map.
---
No, people still complain when they escape
---
It really do be like that. Was playing killer when I hooked someone in the basement super early and was picking up hatchets from the locker right beside basement hook. One of the survivors thought it was a good idea to attempt a save right as I was doing that, and I ended up hooking both of them in the basement. They both gave up right away and died like &lt;5min into the game with no gens done.
---
Felt bad for the 2 other survivors but they kept running away every time they saw me. What I did eventually was I downed one of them, plopped her in front of a gen and hit it a few times, then picked her up and dropped her repeatedly until the wiggle meter filled. She got my point and started doing gens. 
---
The other survivor never understood lol. Apparently she didn't know that running into lockers creates a lot of noise either so it was pretty easy to track her. I yoinked her from a locker and plopped her down in front of the other survivor doing a gen so she could get healed and do gens together. As soon as she got healed she just ran away again and kept hiding around.
---
The game ended up being the single survivor doing all the gens and opening the exit gates. The other guy just booked it out of there once the gate opened.
---
Or maybe they don't want to just like with NOED. I don't really know  either way. If they said something about it they'd have said it on the DBD Forums and not on Reddit
---
Quentin looks better
---
Or alert with old Freddy. Love knowing he's kicking "something" "somewhere" on the map, real big help game
---
For a game over you get 500bp flat, compared to hooking a survivor 3 times which is 2000bp
---
Just having the 1 teammate makes any game better, hopefully you get more people to play with. On Xbox its a little easier because of clubs. Unfortunately I'm not switching to PC any time soon but if they bring out cross play I'm down to suffer at the hands of PC nurses together 😸
---
Must've been another clip cause I recorded this today
---
“BrO iT’S hOw ReAl KiLlErS wOuLD dO, lEt Me Be ImMeRsEd”
---
Reminds me of Alf, have a +1! Hope to see more of your work. :)
---
Spooky.
---
If anyone watches PainRelievers, he loves spine chill and uses it more effectively than other any other player I’ve seen. He‘s convinced me of how good the perk is.
---
"a bit broken"
---
&gt;8 rank differences
---
Question, if they nerfed Clown’s vault speed would you consider that a nerf?
---
if you report them they’ll get comm banned
---
Nice! Make your team 3v1! You’ve cracked the code!!!!
---
I’m not complaining but you sure are.
---
Oh yeah! I remember now lol.
---
Yea absolutely. It is easier than ever to play killer with many bugs benefiting them while very few things heloing survivors. Killers can literally see survivor outlines on gens, yet they complain that survivors are toxic for overcoming the odds and celebrating a bit. 
---
Nothing is worse than the people that complain about ds lol. Perk is literally 60 secs after being unhooked, one time use and it is considered "op". Embarrassing
---
Wow
---
I mean I respect him. Though he may have camped he simply said he was playing the way he wanted to. As long as he isn’t trying to disrespect you he’s just another bad killer, let him play how he wants. He’ll stop eventually
---
You dont get full sacrifice points you only get like 500 or 800 points for a DC
---
Object of Obsession does not work on the survivors end to reveal Freddy but will reveal the survivors aura while looking at him. He trumps all stealth perks.
---
You forgot to do claudette
---
Maybe you have Discordance
---
You forgot no perks but double bp :(
---
Please! This subreddit loves seeing its members put out art :)
---
i was thinking about how cool it would be to have the Patient as a Meyers skin the other day, absolutely love the idea!
---
That’s a very fine Hilliam Billiam.
---
Immediately reminded me of [Harold](https://i.imgur.com/3ZTVro3.jpg)
---
The skill to crouch in a bush OMEGALUL
---
Healing Speed Reduction, Removal of progress granted by good skillchecks.
---
Removal of pallet vacuums, Removal of Double Pallets
---
Addition of a stun after falling from a height, making a yelp noise while falling.
---
Slowed Down Medium Vaults, Adjusted Fast Vault conditions to make it much more difficult to fast vault.
---
Entering lockers gives the blindness status.
---
Also the killer could have an obsession inducing perk
---
The killer is probably running an obsession perk then.
---
Same, region locked servers should be a MUST.
---
You are one of those people who runs away from a gen the second you hear a heartbeat huh
---
Killer with bbq
---
Yea but that would decrease their profits so greedy devs will def not do that. It isn't about what would be "nice" for us, it is about their money.
---
Anyway, besides the greedy devs, I think shards are fine where they are. I have made enough to buy premium perks every time they are in the shrine(BBQ, Bamboozle, ds, MoM, etc). I also have bought the spirit and still have 13k shards remaining and I am only devotion 2. Not a ton of playing time but not a little. If you want skins, buy them, they are purely extra.
---
even the killer can have a bad time, cause to be honest, playing killer is more stressful than playing survivor
---
fuck your survival, right?
---
Can't wait till dedicated servers.
---
This takes me back to those scary stories tot ell in the dark
---
Soo true haha
---
Translation?
---
I'm hoping it would fix a lot of the false hits
---
That and i doubt you'd have the stamina to run for so long without getting tired.
---
If you’re playing survivor start with David so you can run We’re Gonna Live Forever. Gets you a good bit of BP (But be nice and don’t farm people.) 
---
For Killer play Cannibal or get BBQ and Chili teachable.
---
Glad you’re enjoying it man, but maybe not the smartest thing to post, you’re gonna prolly get some hate for it.
---
you’ve been had
---
I'm like NURSE OP but then I don't even try as nurse because I just want the blink achievement. I bet the huntress hatchet and blink achievement is a fuckin joke for you Console users tho. I hope they bring crossplatform play one day tho. Maybe that will get more players. 
---
When do you stream anyways (like what time in what time zone and day)? I don't have much to do except play DBD and watch twitch streams.
---
Your dad should be a tattoo artist
---
I understand what you are saying, but how are you going to play a competitive match and complain that people are boasting that they won? Same goes for other games and even sports dude, if you don't like competitive shit talking, don't play a competitive game. That simple.
---
The the equivalent of 3 completed generators I'm going to assume

It's not out yet but it seems likely that the 'archive' system they're working on will feature Bloodpoints rewards
---
Kill em all, hide the chat if you don't like the tears, I just love them. Haha
---
Do the bones next time then
---
s p u n
---
I would get 50k a game on Cannibal running BBQ with thrill of the hunt
---
Of course then :D
---
This game is not a competitive game at all. If it was, they'd seperate all the ranks so only red can only play with red and purple, purple with only red or only green, green with only purple  or only yellow, yellow with only green or only tan, and tan with only yellow.
---
But if a survivor in the game is running an obsession perk, and I'm not, aren't they supposed to be the obsession?
---
It's not that... that last hatchet should have hit.
---
Thank you very much.
---
They do, at least mostly. That is the whole point of the ranks. The matchmaking is busted but the premise is to match similar ranks, which happens most times. 
---
Also, you're saying it isn't competitive because sometimes people face a higher ranking opponent? That makes no sense. "Oh man, we face the number 1 ranked team in the country tomorrow, guess it won't be competitive". See how that doesn't make sense? 4 people vs. 1. It is a competition everytime.
---
not cool man... you nearly cut down that tree
---
Was going to say Spirit haha. This is amazing!
---
Cool, now go spend them.
---
Honestly that looked fine. 
---
It looks like the tip of your bar hit her then the tree.
---
So what was it that you said to him? 
---
Can't really determine if you're an asshole or not just off of his comment. Did you message him to try to helpfully give him tips to be better and not need to camp? Did you message him to try to make him angry because him camping you made you angry?
---
Not how a chainsaw works... 
---
Yes I know you’re trying to make a joke but still...
---
Nah it's not too bad. Most of these super immersive players just hide around and slow the game down.
---
Then what's the point in survivor perks placing the obsession status on someone when the killer isn't running an obsession perk?
---
Get it, it is alive and well on all platforms and expanding to switch and mobile here soon. BHVR is still producing content and has some big developments planed for the next year.
---
So that the survivors don’t know if they are running an obsession perk
---
But that makes no sense.
---
Watching this hurt me, but no worries- You'll get stronger.
---
Why?
---
Meanwhile I don't really like people with view like yours. Yeah, it's better than before but why stop here? There is clearly an imbalance if people are complaining about seeing the same killers played at high ranks most of the time
---
It's a filter...
---
“He can stop you from throwing down pallets, why is this allowed?”
---
Go up against a good nurse and you’ll which you would go against doctor instead of her
---
Charity Case DLC iirc
---
I feel this deep down in the gaping hole where my hope used to be before it was devoured
---
Always a wraith who does this shit.
---
We represent the 7 deadly sins throughout all our life.
---
Ah so youre who i hate.
---
That actually would be awesome we need to send this off
---
I have no problems with my metal, why do you ask?
---
Just saying you spelt allowed wrong or autocorrect did it for you
---
Tell your dad that it an amazing image and he's very talented :)
---
Oh..... then it should have that filter? I’m dumb :/
---
Amazing! Keep it up, try to draw the rest of them I would tell your dad.
---
So you can have a totem light up while you watch them escape?
---
Why wrath
---
Because why would a survivor perk protect the killer's?
---
So harming 3-4 other people’s gameplay experience. Checks out.
---
Must've been a nurse.
---
He’s all about inflicting pain upon others. 
---
He doesn’t do it for money or anything. 
---
The reason why he took the job is because he was able to do his work alone and inflict pain upon his patients aka prisoners.
---
Exactly that; it takes a WHILE. It’s such a lengthy process for something that, sure, is powerful as hell, but it takes so long to get that you can just never get Tier 3 (if the survivors know what a wall is).
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
How do i do that?
---
i want to see huntress next would be cool to see what he will do.
---
This one longing for the hatch, that one wants to get 4K.
---
Hell yeah
---
We’re do I sign
---
Better pyramid head, and Robbie a interaction for leaving the fog world.( Like the alarms from Freddy)
---
you get around a thousand depending on how many times you hook and for the entity summon then you get more for them dying on hook so you dont get full credit
---
A team of survs are already more powerful than a killer, so 9 wouldn’t make sense
---
It’s 20 downs on console. I have four so far. It’s a bit rough
---
“We only have Decisive Strike, Head On, 20 pallets, and sometimes flashlights.”
---
An unsympathetic female killer would be awesome and I rather want an new oc killer. But hey it's just my opinion
---
And the bridge is doing totems
---
How do we activate this? Please tell me! I wanna try this out with my friends so badly
---
This would be super fun!
---
SWFs will always be the most toxic. We can all happily agree.
---
Whether you’re a “random” that has to be the one who “ruins” it for the SWFs, or if you’re a killer experiencing them. SWFs are the worst.
---
Huntress hachets and plague counters iron will. Unfortunately
---
For me it's super obvious. Like when I'm walking to a group of 3 gens to check em, it's like "Oh! There he is." Or even when I'm walking to a gen and they hear my terror radius I can see if they walk/crouch past the gen.
---
Really? That sucks. Imagine doing super well in a game and you're accidentally looking at him the entire time. That would be heartbreaking
---
No, it's not an aura or notification.
---
Your dad is a fucking mad lad
---
How could you ever forget about buba
---
I'm not though. I have no obsession perks and still the obsession. Even happens in games when the killer is not running obsession perks.
---
He would marry Kate in a heartbeat.
---
I don't get what you're saying.
---
This isn't PUBG. There are no bushes and crouching, let alone crouching in one place, doesn't win a game.
---
Trapper
---
Self Care Is probably A Tier Or Possibly S Don't Know why you put Plunders Instinct At A But Okay. Kinda Flawed
---
i feel like slugging the 3rd survivor is now less needed now that you can close the hatch.
---
Perhaps you can spend that time also looking for the hatch, and once you do, see if you can get the third survivor killed and then shut the hatch before the last guy gets it.
---
granted, you'll have the exit gates to worry about. But the survivor is timed and- unless map rng was against you, patrolling between two spots on the map should be simple, specially if trapped.
---
Competitive and strategic are different things. If a game pits two teams against eacother and the outcome is determined by skill, wouldn't that be competitive? Also, just because there is no reward for ranks that doesn't mean it isn't competitive. 
---
It sounds like you are just comparing two different types of competition my guy. Wouldn't you agree most teams would win if they didn't make mistakes since their skill would outweight the opponents? Picture this, an overwatch match where one team makes no mistakes, they don't miss, they coordinate perfectly, run a perfect counter comp against the other team, and use their ults at the absolute best time. They would always win correct? Still competitive, they are just great at the game and in turn, deserve to win. Simple, best teams always win the competition.
---
Nah. 
---
Next killer is just Fuze as a whole. 
---
The normal weapons is his shield and he doesn't give the normal hearthbeat sounds but you can hear the "CLANG CLANG CLANG" of him running with the shield. 
---
The cluster bombs can be prepared on surfaces and activated remotely. 
---
Maybe in this game he will be competitive lol
---
Indeed
---
Personal preference i suppose.
---
sometimes it really do be like that
---
Stramger things i guess its chpater 14 because that chapter just includes a killer, and  dont realeasd any kid survivor
---
RIGHT!!
---
The logic here is incredible.
---
What perks are you using
---
Had this happen a few times on PTB, looks like it'll be pretty fun to do when everyone's asleep
---
Yeah, It Is easy to counter but the 4 survivors are four different players, you know? 3 may escape without a problem, but the 4th will be annoyed as fucking hell
---
That is so annoying
---
Ez 360 junk awesome pic tho !
---
I'll wait till dedicated servers are out.
---
Well, it's only Jane fault. Nurse played smart by going  for the injured one. You know... Killing is her objective.
---
Killers being able to work as a team&gt;9 survivors
---
This isn't necessarily true, it's not all about balance, there are some funny memes (although they aren't about knack being the best so they actually fuckin suck) some cool drawings, showcasing.
---
I dont think The Third Seal is worth a perk slot since it's a Hex Perk, and you would want to keep it for a longer time. It would probably pay more off to have Devour Hope active a whole trial, than having Third Seal active a whole trial, but thats just my opninion
---
I’m curious, how is bringing your friends cheating?  It’s an option in the menu, “Survive with Friends”. 
---
Besides, in every horror movie where there’s a group of people surviving against a killer, the group is 99.9% of the time a *group of friends*.   Not a group of random strangers who just happen to end up together, against the killer. So it actually makes the game closer to the horror movie troupe, to have a group of real friends against the killer. 
---
If they wanted to go a step further they would adjust the game to be a range communication feature and not be able to talk to your mates across the map.
---
it keeps me fwom twipping at nite uwu
---
Okay I didn’t really think about the killers focusing the same surv, in that case then it would be interesting
---
How is it protecting the killers perk?
---
Its dus to the killer grunting that initiates a jumpscare 🤣
---
Oeiginal chapters are way more cooler than license ones... but with license characters there is way more hype than a original one.
---
I think the leather one is fantastic
---
He has a lot of shit add-ons, killer instinct, the ultra rare, detection range, stalking speed (Myers has this shit add-on too)
---
Tfw people don’t know this is a shit post
---
Think you mean WGLF.
---
Just hit 1 mil
---
Nah, too obvious. He was probably playing as clown.
