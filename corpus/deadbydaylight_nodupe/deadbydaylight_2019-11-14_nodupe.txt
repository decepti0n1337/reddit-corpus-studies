Depends on the rank really. If you want the game to be balanced based on the high ranks skilled players she is totally fine. Some youtuber killer main had an experiment to down zubatlel as fast as possible. He got juked for 34 seconds on average. Just imagine how many gens can be popped at this 34 seconds+the time to find survivor+ the time to hook him(spoiler: 3). This game is ridiculously unbalanced towards the survivors at top skill level. But yea, if you just gonna play at green-purple rank solo.tham you are pretty much fucked facing good spirit with
---
---
---
It would also make sense for Spirit to be the survivor due to lore reasons because it would show the entity's power of being able to reach across timelines and intermingle different itterations of the same person. My partner also pointed out that another reason Spirit would attack herself (as Run) is for the fact that maybe she doesn't even recognize herself anymore. Herself anymore.
---
Down 5 survivors with 1 activation of The cannibals chainsaw.
---
Yeah, exactly
---
It‚Äôs like Adam‚Äôs hair all over again.
---
With all respect, I have to disagree. Depending on the way you play, it can be a 4k.
---
The Ghostface outfit is bugged atm. The flappy bits cover nearly half of the screen when you use your power
---
Oh god it‚Äôs gonna be like Jiro from payday 2. He was a Japanese man who joins the gang in order to track down his son who was sent to America. He only spoke Japanese in an extremely fast high voice. I believe ‚Äúhe learned some English‚Äù after a few updates 
---

---
Fun fact : There were entire mods dedicated to silencing Jiro
---
Maybe it's Rin's great ancestor, reincarnated as an Oni hunting Mr. Yamaoka as a survivor as revenge for destroying his bloodline? Sounds plausible enough I think.

Feng comes with Doctor DLC which is free on PS4

Cut me some slack would be way to overpowered imagine a swf running it that equals basically 12 more pallets with confirmed stuns, it would be fun as though and I like the idea maybe only 2 a match though m. Because imagine creating 12 shack pallets. I‚Äôd just dc

Rift Challenge: Escape, come back as Tommy Jarvis and kill Jason.
---
Fyi you dont need monitor on Scratched Mirror anymore, his default terror radius is 0 now
---
It will keep your progress
---
That's the community fault, not the Devs. They should be challenge that can be completed by simply playing. If people are going to just play to complete them and not to play the game. what the fuck are they suppose to do about it. People should be playing to play and not chase some carrot on the stick. Only thing they could do to make people not play that way is not to include challenges at all.
---
Thanks!!
---
That might be because you have a very little knowledge about it and people are always afraid of something they don't know + you might be used to Western horror stuff so your brain might be like: wow this is fresh new, I never saw this, I am scared etc. :)

"Hey Jake why are you trying to eat me"

I don't run meta perks, but it is both an extremely inefficient perk and unfun to use. It wastes too much time even with the default 32 second heal which can be extended tremendously by Sloppy Butcher, Thmatophobia, Dying Light etc. Some killers will abuse people that try to rely on Self-Care if they notice it. 
---
If I run Nurse's Calling against survivors I can tell aren't too experienced I just leave them be until they heal and hit them again to repeat the process to buy time for other survivors who prioritze right. One of the skills in this game to learn when you need to play injured and when it is good to heal. I've lost games where a survivor literally wants to heal next to a 80%  gen and we lose the gen progress to perks like PGTW or just really needing the last gen powered. I even got some survivors healing against NOED and not splitting from the team to open separate gates. One instance caused the whole team to die.
---
Sadly most instances in the game are just not doable with Self-Care and just letting someone else heal you saves a perk slot for thing else. It was meta prior to mid-2018 forward because of faster healing times, tons of pallets, pallet vacuums, old DS, among other things that gave survivors so much time to play inefficiently. Now survivors have to be efficient sometimes to the point of saving a pallet over a health state.

---
I assume that's a glitch though
---
That's some fair criticism, and I appreciate it. :)
---
I used to use bond but I dropped it for small game because of the current hex meta.  Frankly, as I've said, teammates are too unreliable, I've sat there waiting for heals while a guy ignores me and just works on a generator, blows a skillcheck, then runs away leaving my wounded ass exposed.
---
I generally only play survivor with friends, so I don't really bond now anyway.  Usual setup is Balanced Landing, Self care, Adrenaline, and Small game (or other utility perk).
---
No, I don‚Äôt think I will. I‚Äôm gonna mash my button until my fingers cramp. No hatch for you, babes.&lt;3
---
Depending on survivors mistakes. If you play weak killer you only depend on survivors mistakes and that they are not very good. You can win even with perkless wraith on rank 1 as OhTofu did, but as he said the same - it depends not on you, but on aurvivors who are not that good
---
No problem, I‚Äôd love to see more survivor perks that are useful, It‚Äôs been a while since they have come out with a new decent survivor perk
---
Lol, not gonna lie...that was smoothe as shit.
---
Survivors physically see you chasing them around a loop but your spirit was actually by the pallet the whole time and then you suddenly appear when they reach the pallet and you smack em. Like ekko ult from league or tracer backtrack
---
Nah mate, It's not new to me at all. I've been addicted and hooked on Japanese Horror.
---
That would be pretty cool actually, both sides hit skillchecks and whoever gets more wins. if it's a draw then i dunno.
---
Hes right, hes not a conservative, hes a crypto fascist (probably)
---
It‚Äôs strange because the version the switch has currently has all the outfits in the files all they have to do is release them
---
You get the cloak for 400 cells, not the whole outfit. The cloak is what you want though. I don‚Äôt really like the knife and the mask is almost exactly the same as the default one except it‚Äôs cleaner.
---
Be interesting to see when the other surv
---
ivors recognize Survivor Rin as Killer Soirit.
---
The huntress is about, if not, just as tall as myers. Even if she's slightly shorter, running should beat walking since their height difference isnt extraordinary.
---
It's FINISHING a gen. You can do a total of 1% on 3 gens, as long as you're on it when it finishes.
---
Yamasmolka
---
Arguing? Dont come in this sub for help then deny any answer giving to you. Just leave we dont need you in our community
---
It's being on a gen as it's completed.
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
Also Mad Grit if you‚Äôve got it
---
Anti sjw is just synonymous with bigot so every hate crime committed counts ad anti SJW ruining lives.
---
He‚Äôs your saviour. You should be giving thanks and praise.
---
just a joke dawg
---
You have until the rift closes, so like two months.
---
It‚Äôs a reference to one of his videos lol
---
dont forget to change sweaters after calling the cops
---
He should have palleted Becky.
---
I agree.
---
The Entity could have used the opportunity to snag both, one enraged with madness, and the other enraged with fury. Twofer special.
---
Rin's dad should be a survivor. Maybe perhaps an ancestor as the killer?
---
I also really really like that third perk, and we need more blood point perks for survivor, you do a better job are making perks then the devs, I may be a bit survivor biased though :)
---
Oh no! How can they expect you to play more than one killer? And you have to be *unoptimized*? How dare they!
---
***Oooooof Unlucky***
---
That‚Äôs what I said in the post! You could also mix in other great locations since it‚Äôs a movie set. Make it a combination of Sidney, Stu and Casey‚Äôs house.
---
Those were all set in the entity's realm
---
But... her powers are tied to the fact that he killed her (she is a ghost). Why would he also have ghost powers? Did he die too?
---
Would you like to set sail on this ocean of flavors with me?
---
Noo Nancy... :(
---
jesus
---
Did indeed report in-game, and I'll go ahead and hit the official site as well. I hope by now he's already banned and not ruining other games, though.
---
i just ran stridor(level 2) on spirit to test and i heard jane and claudette moaning on a gen on badham from DOWN THE STREET it‚Äôs ridiculous
---
Legion + Franklins = no items for survivors
---
Prepare for a trouble
---
And make it double
---
Devs have specified. Not tested, so it might not be working that way, but that's how it SHOULD be working
---
Nobody is making you play this game just leave üòÇüòÇüòÇ nobody gives a shit if you leave
---
Ahhh thank you!
---
I can imagine the Entity looking at the Legion and going ‚ÄúAh, whatever. I need to meet the quota, might as well take these four‚Äù
---
4 DCs today for me personally as killer. Random DCs as a survivor. Usually not me, surprisingly.
---
Is the sbfl intentional?
---
that mask looks scary as shit now in yamaoka
---
5 seconds into a match haha pretty damn quick
---
That is true. Could be used against her in certain situations.
---
 I've just had some bad experiences from people cleansing and costing the game for everyone else, probably poor plays by the whole team, but still. I'm salty hahah.
---
Some people just really need ruin man...
---
She'd be too broken, you'd hook/mori her and then she'd just spawn again over and over lmao
---
Inb4 incoming shorts cosmetics for Jane?
---
I've only ever been scammed on window vaults and pallet vaults, but never have I been hit after dropping a pallet AND getting the score event for stunning the killer. That's just a next level of bullshit, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I glitched and saw the level IV trials. They b crazy.
---
Dunno, she isn't that much of a problem. Base nurse was way scarier than base spirit imo. People are conservative and dont like to adapt. Why would you learn juking spirit when you can easily dc your way into a killer who keeps you in a comfort zone. (Every killer besides her and nurse can be somewhat effectively looped) that is the reason why a lot more people will hate exactly these two killers while they are viable. imo
---
New to the game.
---
A tale as blissful as this wiped the woes from my mind and left a now dry trial of tears on my face, I loved it.
---
Who the hell would play him honestly?
---
Exactly
---
Not dbd related
---
LMAO IKR
---
Consider grabbing Were Going To Live Forever from David.
---
Its a bloodpoint boosting perk like BBQ only for saving people.
---
Bro I‚Äôm a cop with like 20 years service. I don‚Äôt need that college girl BS. I‚Äôm like talking to her and next thing I know she‚Äôs phased into the other room to grab a beer. She‚Äôs a freak
---
I‚Äôm not arguing against myself lmao. It‚Äôs just obvious that you little fucks still have an old vendetta against legion. If you actually cared about holding one button you would‚Äôve play survivor at all. Full stop.
---
the bullshit never ends...my favorite is when I drop the pallet and they hit me through it and I stand there in shock and then the killer magically teleports to my side of the pallet after the stun and hits me down
---
Can't they just pull a Left 4 Dead and keep the gore watered down in those countries.
---
What‚Äôs the creepiest one in your opinion?
---
Pfft I wish, I reset to rank 10 from rank 1, literally bots as teamates, I ran a billy for years. He wasnt great, but the game took like 20 minutes and it got boring af
---
I knew you would say the "uhh anti fascism is fascism" boomer shit, so politically illiterate lol, you don't know what you're talking about, you dont even know what fascism is do you?
---
Most killers need their add ons as base tbh, like pig especially
---
The Oni
---
If I had one wish...I'd wish for DBD to have Friday 13th graphics  T_T
---
‚Äúnothin‚Äô personnel, ki- NANI?!?I*
---
i would say maybe half are actually weak, like dr, trapper, 90% definitely do not qualify as "weak"
---
spirit = op
---
nurse = strong
---
hillbilly = strong
---
freddy = strong
---
huntress = strong
---
hag = strong
---
demogorgon = strong
---
ghostface = fairly strong
---
Link?
---
Never looked into that perk before.
---
It's honestly insulting that it does nothing but increase BP, whereas BBQ is an amazing perk even without the BP.
---
Honestly, with as meta as BBQ is. They should just bake BT and WGtLF into one perk. It even makes sense already.
---
what you are saying is that he should run these certain perks to be able to play. I personally don't like tunneling, but what I am saying is the response to that should not be "just use these perks"
---
Sexy time has begun
---
Eventually you gonna buy them all. So just pick anything you want to
---
&gt;	He plays builds people give him so theres that
---
and then proceeds to complain the whole game if he doesn‚Äôt do well with the build lol
---
thanks man i appreciate that
---
I would definitely recommend buying Myers, he‚Äôs a pretty good killer. Legion is pretty bad (though I think he‚Äôd be fun to play, not sure haven‚Äôt tried him) and plague seems pretty ok. Also for survivors if you want to actually climb the ranks I‚Äôd buy Laurie for decisive strike. If you are just a causal player though then yeah buy Jeff
---
There was one time I got hit by a pig through a pallet, she was on my side of the pallet,she had enduring so she started to swing at me assuming she could hit me, and she teleported back to the other side. We both stood there like WTF
---
I mean, if you took even a second to look at your karma score on any of the comments you made for mine or this post, I think it shows who isn't wanted in this community. Lmfao.
---
Ghostface nerf looking good
---
Have you seen this community... it even has a dbd nsfw page, everyone wants shirtless Myers, and anything else I‚Äôm forgetting lol.
---
Is there a black circle around Sprint Burst?
---
This is all hearsay but I read in a thread a while back that due to how the entity's realm works a survivor can find a version of theirself that has become a killer (but they can't find a second survivor copy) so maybe we get a Rin survivor as well or something.
---
Is pure luck a skill? I'm still learning Ace
---
lol Fair enough. There are a few less, then.
---
this whole sub is a bunch of potatos
---
Understandable and respectable. But dear god, some survivors are just outstanding at being horrible people.
---
I believe there was I'm not home to check but I had to ask a question because it's been bugging me
---
It worked that way for me when hearing someone, I only actually healed them for 2 seconds and it counted.
---
The docter skill checks tho how whould that work he has madness 9001
---
Ive taken DH out of my perk setup. I dont even know how many times ive popped dh,got exhausted,and still taken a hit anyways. It's very frustrating. 
---
The only way to use it now is to pop it super early to get a little distance and make sure it actually works.....which makes it basically useless.
---
Also seeing a fair amount of bullshitery with window hits lately as well.
---
Question 38?? What is this from?
---
Literally they dont.... they might for games like mortal kombat where there is no camera control and it's all about coding combo.
---
But they dont for rainbow six, call of duty, tom Clancy games, and dead by daylight is identical to all these games as far as its mechanical controls.... camera control, input requirements, and efficiency of all these things are vital.
---
Cmon brother it's no secret console players are straight up worse than PC players in 90% of games because their straight up unable to be as efficient as a PC player using mouse and key boards precision vs the slow, imprecise, controller
---
Feng can sit on my face.

i tried xbox for the first time last weekend and was getting insta queues as survivor. Feel like you get the usual tunelers in brown/yellow ranks, the occasional face camper, and then its business as usual in green ranks. I'd switch to xbox right now just for insta queues if I weren't devotion 4 on ps4 lol
---
Yes but 60% skill check reductoin tho

*As the Spirit catch 3 survivors in traps.*

might be dope if maps had easter eggs to activate like bo zombies

6.3k karma from dbd,not sure about that one chiefston. Plus cant see karm in inbox LUL. Bit of a reee arent you
---
The bloodweb doesn't let you get all the items and perks on a level in the bloodweb. You did not royally screw up your character. Once you get to the next level of the bloodweb the perk has a chance to appear.
---
Why standing still shouldn't be a mindgane though? To learn some ways of juking her you can watch tru3talent. He even has whole video dedicated to it. The problem with the spirit is people just dc versing her. I really doubt that rank 1 hillbilly perfoms much worse than rank 1 spirit vs good, not babyraging, dcing survivors(i think hillbilly is more deadly on average, though we can check the stats lol). Dont take into consideration her couple of op af addons-those for sure gotta be nerfed.
---
Yeah. But that one is also time consuming. I‚Äôve managed to get to 8 in a couple hours of gameplay
---
Alright cool. I'd just hate to have an offering slot taken up with a useless thing. Messes with my OCD
---
I did it on first try. Had to tunnel tho
---
Obv its the bad match making, rank 18 paired up with rank 17
---
OMG just realised you stalked my profile, get out of here lmao. Fucking weirdo boy
---
Hey, you did better than I usually do. Rank 6 &amp; I‚Äôm poop at chases
---
I know im an asshole is all I can say. I saw a swf pop up with medkits. I equipped franklins.
---
Agreed. Got called a lag switching hacker for using spirit phasing to catch up to a survivor and he said he reported me for using my power.
---
Is this Otz cosplaying as Monto?
---
A name I havent heard in many a year...
---
i can't tell if this is a joke about actual new challeneges or if you think the current stuff is hard? i finished the survivor shit in 2 days so-
---
i have enough for a dlc and another character but i dont think there are any dlc's that come with survivors or killers i want :(
---
What‚Äôs the problem here
---
Killers should also get a bump for facing a swf.
---
Actually i think i might go with the Halloween chapter DLC and Plague ; ^)
---
Isn't it for depleting med kits? I don't see how you could do it otherwise...
---
That's why I said all players in the trial instead of all survivors in the trial get a BP bonus.
---
 Nea and David aren‚Äôt good people...
---
Game lags
---
‚ÄúKINGU  KURIMUZON!‚Äù
---
I haven't even played the other 13 chapters
---
Ive found that if i use my phones hotspot rather than my wifi it drastically reduces the disconnects. Not sure why my wifi would be causing this though. And its such a ballache to keep changing it over all the time.
---
Basically Genji in Overwatch
---
Dead by daylight isn't a game that gives benefits across the board for using a mouse.
---
Survivor is almost completely unaffected when using a mouse and keyboard which means that console killers would also be relatively uneffected by the change.
---
The only people that would be affected by crossplay would be the killers that are much more viable with a mouse and the survivors that don't know how to properly play against a Huntress/Nurse/Plague when they have consistent control of their abilities. Console players will eventually learn to adapt to these killers suddenly being viable anyway.
---
Oh yeah, my speakles and readles are bad

---
I actually rushed to this one thinking it would be the bottleneck.  Had game 2 and 3 be super close.  Game 5 I did 3 gens completely solo and a fourth that a teammate showed up for part way through.
---
I would definitely recommend myers, he's one of my favourite killers. His base power isn't the strongest, but his add ons are some of the most fun to play around with in the game.
---
I recommend holding off on getting too many characters/cosmetics right now if you're not in a hurry, I believe theyte having a black friday sale soon! Get more characters and get them for cheaper :)
---
God please no that's just nurse but even easier
---
I'm not saying you're a liar, because obviously there must be some Claudettes who aren't the worst, but I will say that online, everyone is always the exception.  Every leatherface will say they don't face camp, every David King will say they don't sandbag for WGLF stackw, and of course I'm the Pig who doesn't tunnel survivors wearing a RBT.  Even if you are an exception, which I can't prove or disprove and I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're telling the truth, that still makes you the exception.
---
at least it wasn't a Steve.

i like the idea. the community always finds a way to complain. if they didn‚Äôt come out with it, you guys would complain for lack of content. when they do, ‚Äúnerf spirit omg‚Äù
---
I played 2 player SWF for a while today. We didn't have any problems finding games.
---
Didn't they already do that? Since Rin became the Killer instead of dear ol dad?
---
oh damn TIL. thx! barely play him atm so didn't know \^.^
---
So? I don't see anything extraordinary other than the Ebony.
---
With Ruin gone and people never healing against him (negating Nurse's Calling, he is basically perkless until he manages to hook someone and get a BBQ reading.
---
So that's a 80% penalty to gen progression if you're in a SWF team?
---
Killers would still run Ruin, PGTW and use Freddy's add ons.
---
Damn, just let them buff the weaker killers. Shitty ideas like this just punishes solo players that end up with a SWF group. No.
---
I think it might have been because I‚Äôve been constantly playing these last few days
---
Lol that‚Äôs dead facts
---
Cant 90 degree on controller, cant quickly move your camera on controller to keep track of the killer on a tile loop so you dont get fucking rekt by a simple moonwalk, so 2 of the most important things, keeping track of the killer, and making optimal corners to maximize distance gain vs distances lost these are the literal 2 things that make a good survivor.... and controller just straight up cant compete vs a fast, almost instantaneous, mouse, and the instant, precise inputs of keys... if you seriously dont think or know about the separation between console and PC them your either too young, or too stupid on the subject to input a false opinion that literally pulls claims out of your ass easily snuffed out by simple proof of basic things like... PLAYING THE GAME.
---
Juking nurse is not random.  You have pretty good knowledge when she‚Äôs going to blink and where she is going to blink and about how far.  Spirit is 100% random.  You don‚Äôt know when she‚Äôs phasing, and have minimal idea where she is in phase
---
No you're reading wrong. The max is 20% with it starting at 10% for 2 players and jumping to 15 then 20. Ya derp
---
Can kinda do that with dailies
---
Bad use of the format
---
PLEASE
---
I respect that i dont think spirit is op though
---
That‚Äôs literally the first thing I thought of when seeing the teaser
---
And another tip: look behind you. The killer could have easily doubled back and hit you after you blindly took the vault. Because of lag you got hit anyway, but if you‚Äôre going to instantly vault, make sure you look behind you and know that you should commit to it.
---
Pretty much. Not a day goes by that I do not see his face. Still don't know who he is, just know he's getting lots of face time here. Free advertisement via "memes"
---
I have been this survivor. It's just a glitch. They can't get out at all.
---
Because the gagging is annoying and nasty
---
i dont believe they can leave if this happens
---
I‚Äôm prestige 3 level 50+ with billy and no BBQ yet, with how many times I‚Äôve leveled him up he should be level 80+
---
A whole new meaning for the term "Gen rush"
---
Scratch that, it went down. ;(
---
I can't stand Ghostface personally. He's the only reason I will disconnect us Survivor. Too broken and glitchy. I don't like inconsistent characters. Give me a spirit or iridescent Huntress any day of the week over Ghostface
---
Maybe give credit to the artist???
---
JUST MAAAYBBEE
---
I mean you aren‚Äôt wrong literally every game in high rank that I‚Äôve played against plague and someone cleanses i see people dropping so fast
---
&gt; I would love to hear the ideas of the community but I do ask you to be respectful with it
---
&gt; Please think before you speak instead of having a visceral guttural reaction to something.
---
So, you want people to be respectful towards you...while you attack others?
---
Except less excessive healing
---
Being a Plague player, I understand why people don't cleanse but it still seriously fucking pisses me off.
---
Nea is the Entity!
---
Get 5 iridescent emblems in a single trial
---
We don't really know honestly. I guess we'll learn what the hell happened to him if it does end up actually being Rin's dad.
---
Look at what he said first. Come in like an asshole, get treated like one
---
Honestly, I'm a Survivor main but Spirit is a much bigger problem than Ghostface right now.
---
Original Ghostface has the hunting knife. Pretty sure the switchblade was from Scream 2
---
Agreed with the bonus BP and speed reduction
---
I dont really ever see him complain. Mostly just gives pointers useful to both sides
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a LICENSED killer perk
---
just to clarify, it went back down after resetting.
---
Well they have stated multiple times that the ones people have seen in the 4th tome are just placeholders and will probably be changed. Hopefully that's true.
---
[removed]
---
Well the classic mask is supposed to be brand new, so I‚Äôm not sure what more detail they could have put into it.
---
All I'm saying is that they're good perks to use. But if you have to use a perk to counter a specific killer then its complete bull.
---
Cosmetics and the currency to buy the event cosmetics
---
To flex on other survivors and killers.
---
All my other points still stand. It's a bad idea. A BP bonus doesn't make it better.
---
Sure low tier killers would maybe have more wins, but it would make high tier killers better than they already are. Especially Freddy. Ya'll really need to give him another way to slow down gen progression. He's already annoying.
---
One of the community managers on the forums stated that that's not what it means. Something like you only have to be on the generator when it gets finished. It sounds like they just worded it poorly.
---
Yeah I understand it must be hard being a plague player in a world where top players don't cleanse to activate corrupt purge and that it misses out on a core feature of Plague, sorry about that :(
---
Are you 55?
---
This is actually a really good idea ngl
---
One of the other comments was ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs been in the shrine‚Äù‚Äôso no, it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs licensed because if that was true that perk with the medkit would cost 2700 as well because it‚Äôs a Quentin perk, there have also been many other licensed perks in the shrine that didn‚Äôt cost 2000 e.g. BBQ and Chili with Leatherface

You must be fun at parties

This is going to be interesting if the killer is related to Rin. Teacher? Her father? 
---
I am interested in the lore
---
I'm sorry that you don't understand that literally no other killer has the ability to stand in one spot and give you zero idea as to what is actually happening. that is completely unfair and not balanced in any way. oh and she has no vault animation??? even nurse has a vault animation. literally, you're talking like every spirit main ever. glancing over the fact that she gets dc'd on because of the reason that people can't determine what she's doing.
---
I‚Äôm so tired of the convenient narrative on this sub that every SwF in the existence of the game are tbagging flashlight spammers
---
Baby dwight was the first survivor I saw that game, I'm very sorry for what I did to them. 
---
 spent 90% of the game in the killer shack despite not camping. They just decided that saving them in my face and then running into the same 3 traps over and over would work out eventually.
---
Had plenty of that one the first level, and those challenges weren't that bad.
---
Don't worry about it. I'm working on a build that punishes them for not cleansing. So far I just have her ultra rare add-on for the aura reading and Thanatophobia.
---
Nah man it's tf2 spy's mask
---
This is most likely who the killer is, Rin's father is a possibility but this seems much more reasonable.
---
I've been wanting to get Plague for awhile but have yet to do it, she's the only OC killer I do not own yet.
---
Ripcord!
---
I used to do a meme strat when I was first starting out where instead of kicking a gen, I would crouch next to it as the Pig and pretend to be working on it. Worked way more than you would think lmao but this was also back when i was like rank 18.
---
My meme but i don‚Äôt really have to I just got it from google
---
And every decent killer that comes out gets a nerf, do you actually read the patch notes?
---
Are you sure you know how to play as a survivor?
---
I honestly think cleansing is the better strategy for at least 75% of the population.  Most killers aren't zubat, and they dont know how to get the best use out of corruption. Also, being wounded as a mid tier survivor is just a quick down for the killer. This whole reddit thing that you should never cleanse is bad advice for all but the highest skill level of players.
---
Downvotes incoming.
---
Lol my girlfriend always gotta spectate killer giving me hatch
---
Must successfully hit Great Skillchecks with Ruin activated AND repair all 5 gens by yourself. And then escape through hatch with a key with all 3 survivors.
---
She's fun when survivors actually decide to cleanse.
---
This is Quentin arguing for his face rework
---
That‚Äôs a lot from someone called bow down to satan
---
Bad post
---
Make sure to overwhelming presence to make sure they get less use for them.
---
If i wasn't poor i'd gold you.
---
I‚Äôve just seen a few perks that have been in SOS previously that are still 2700 unless my games been bugged but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not?
---
So why the hate from survivors
---
That's your opinion. 
---
Which I might add could've been stated without spewing it like some elitist. As I said I want a discussion on what we 'could' do. And gave an idea. There was no need for you to speak the way you did. People acting that way is why this community has the reputation it does. Not everything you don't agree with isn't trying to attack you. I would appreciate it if you could not be so defensive when it comes to a discussion of ideas. I appreciate your opinion. But I gotta ask, do you have anything constructive to the conversation you would like to add?
---
Not just that but instadowns have more counterplay than some of the shit survivors have lmao.
---
Easy, just never throw a hatchet the entire game
---
Didn't the devs say it was the entity that made him kill Rin?
---
Leatherface in my opinion since he can instadown off it and has a way to quickly break the necessary pallets.
---
Not to mention instadowns have more counterplay than some of the shit survivors have.
---
Wdym, this challenge is so easy, just as long as the killer isn‚Äôt running ruin you should be fine!
---
What about proximity based voice chat?  Like you have to be in range to hear them?
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA SO FUCKING FUNNY AND SO GODDAMN ORIGINAL
---
"Stalked" Who'd wanna stalk you? Lmfao. I was checking to see if you gave up on being chilidish on my post and moved onto another, which you did and continued to be childish. Lmao.
---
M1 killers and/or killer that got a oneshot ability.
---
Notably: leatherface, myers, hillbilly, spirit, wraith.
---
It works with almost everyone, though (except nurse who ignores pallets), but you might want to be careful when using it on ghostface, plague and legion. Their power gets disabled when they are stunned.
---
Just cosmetics, it gives cells back too actually
---
If you had the Tome IV spoiler bug you know that one of the challenges is &gt;!get two flashlight saves in a single trial!&lt;, assuming they don't change them since they accidentally showed the whole community lol. So if you think this one's gonna be hard just you wait!
---
That could be an idea. Having an ingame chat feature could mitigate some of the players using outside communication and make it so that the SWF would have a means of communication with the random while in a match.
---
Play killer, youll get a match instantly
---
Ummmm playing ghostface like that not only makes Him stronger but also viable at rank 1
---
It's just ring, if you're not seeing it in your webs then you're just having some bad luck.
---
It would be really funny if quentins fist arm would be 3 meter long as a payback for Freddys huuuuuge lunges.
---
he's 4 sure t r i g g e r e d
---
Omg stop with the spirit problem she‚Äôs not that hard to deal with the only time I have ever had a problem with her is when she runs anal beads
---
Any survivor will do. Use the one who you leveled up the most, as This is not happening is a generic perk, not linked to any survivor.
---
I suggest to run it along with Self heal and, maybe, Botany knowledge. You can heal yourself to 99% to work on generators while injured, and finish the heal as soon as you hear the heartbeat.
---
The first showcase of GER showed it sending blood back into diavolo, I know thats not exactly its ability but still
---
Sorry but they're not gonna nerf people just because they're in a party. That would kill a huge chunk of the player base and it just doesn't make sense to punish players for playing with friends even if it is strong. There's also the albeit rare instances where people are partied up but don't have voice coms. They'd be punishing players for something they're not even doing.
---
I guess you are supposed to derank and then go into a full SWF group that will have only support perks and flashlights so you can peacefully sit in a corner and do 3 full gens with like spare part toolboxes.
---
In soloQ most likely impossible.
---
Theory: Rin's Father will be the survivor, to go along with him being terrorized by his own daughter. Then the Killer will be "The Ancestor" a malevolent spirit from ancient Japan.
---
No. He called me "bud," so I called him "chief." Good joke though. Kudos. üëè
---
Same happened to me
---
What about 3 SPIRITS? NOW THAT WILL BE A SURPRISE!
---
The new map was found in files visit leaksbydaylight for further answers
---
SAME
---
very much doubt the teaser would be for a rework
---
No he Freddie Mercury from a different timeline where he didn‚Äôt die
---
"waste points" you act as if it takes months to get 1 million bp. If I go for maximising BPs I can get around 90k per match. Not even including when others use bp offerings or double bp weekends.
---
removed uncivil
---
You aren‚Äôt a very fun person to be around at parties huh
---
Yeah I dont play him much anymore either but the new Undetectable status erases your stain and TR. He can now be detected by spine chill at T1 though, so it's kind if a trade off
---
I can hear this picture
---
You: puts forward logical argument.
---
Op: restates opinion and ignores what you said.
---
Tbc I was referring to the use of it although it does pop up very fast in the web.
---
For those wondering, it says "It's yours, it's Yamaoka's."
---
Jokes on you I have no friends and therefore dont go to parties
---
No.
---
Must kill the killer. Now, that would be a challenge lol
---
Definitely not, iirc it's only a 0.5% increase per prestige so 1.5% at p3
---
Ooof
---
Even in the long run?
---
Wait I‚Äôm dumb why wouldn‚Äôt you cleanse?
---
The title of the teaser says its for chapter 14 not a rework lmao
---
I think your dead wrong here. The game is a carrot we have chased for years and this new challenge system is the new proverbial carrot as it provides the best progress in the rift as grinding out normal xp is staggering. 
---
The players will play to complete the challenges until they are done. If the devs did not want this particular problem they should have created grindier challenges rather than difficult ones.
---
Or. I can use franklins so they get no use at all.
---
Well Michael, Freddy and Leatherface are all from America and all killers, therefore all the same! /s
---
Bro shut up I just want a spirit rework :(
---
Store them, you never know what happens in the future. I habe 100k shards so far, I buy every character with them and sometimes perks behind a paywall
---
It does seem to be one of the most common and early encountered in the bloodwebs. But jake was also the first character I got to level 50.
---
ü§£ü§£ I fucking cackled
---
Well you and her do have something in common.
---
Okay? So what's your idea for an alternative? As I stated this was an idea and I'm looking for a discussion on what we can do to balance the communication advantage that most SWF do take advantage of. I'm not attacking SWF groups. I play in one regularly, it's like I can play on autopilot compared to solo surv or killer where I actually get to seemingly play the game for real. If you don't like my ideas that's fair, but I also ask you to add something constructive to the discussion.
---
Holy sh***t it coming to together Bhvr now going to change the killer due to us knowing
---
I‚Äôve been thinking of something like this. I basically want the Faceless from XCOM 2 as a killer. Maybe if you ‚Äúwork‚Äù on a gen, you‚Äôd get a skillcheck that would not just pop and regress the gen but also damage the survivors on it, would that be broken?

‚ö†Ô∏èVIVZIEPOP CONTROVERSY DEBUNKED!‚ö†Ô∏è

üéÉDeezyüéÉ [Commissions Open] (@NotDeezy) Tweeted:
---
PSA ABOUT THE VIVZIEPOP/HAZBIN HOTEL CONTROVERSY
---
[Long Thread, Please RT!!]
---
So lately it's been thrown around that @VivziePop is a bad person. I will List what the allegations are taken from another Tweet, debunk them and it's basically how this thread will go. https://twitter.com/NotDeezy/status/1189570171050057729?s=17
---
Also, they‚Äôre in Hell, of course they‚Äôre terrible people.
---
I usually never make it below rank 10 before rank reset so that might be why I rarely see it.
---
Simple explanation- The Entity has to torture him into service.
---
When a player cleanses they corrupt that fountain, plague can then drink out of the corrupted fountain to change her power temporarily from vile purge to corrupt purge. Corrupt purge is used the same way as vile purge except it damages players instead of infecting them, the range of corrupt purge basically turns Plague into an unstoppable killing machine until it goes away.
---
This honestly makes sense.
---
Addison‚Äôs a guy
---
People have done comparisons between standard and P3 lvl 50 bloodwebs, there‚Äôs basically no difference. In fact in some cases non-prestige gives better bloodwebs.
---
I‚Äôve prestiged a character myself and again no difference.
---
Any difference is so small that random chance outdoes it. You could very easily unlock all perks at default which is like a billion bloodwebs, then all perks at P3 which is another billion bloodwebs, record the stats and have an equal number of rare items, or more items you want at default rather than prestige.
---
This is George Maxwell, a stalker from Clock tower 2: the struggle within.  This game is the black sheep of the clock tower series, but he is one of my favourite stalkers to come out of the whole clock tower series.  As he follows you, you hear his knife scraping against the ground.
---
Once you see a damn good cosmetic pack and really want it.. But you also see its purple rarity and costs 21k shards... Well Then you will kinds regret "wasting" them shards like that. Unless you have enough money that you don't care about byung these (imo expensive) skins.
---
Killers that can‚Äôt do shit at loops.
---
You could just...idk...not watch him. That's something I do when I don't like a YouTuber. Something to consider, maybe.
---
Never heard this...? They are?
---
Interesting. I think premonition and object should work on spirit while phasing.
---
Hell what about pebble?
---
I think he's too immature to know the definition of that word "competitive'
---
Disagree, I absolutely love the crisp clean version
---
That‚Äôs good to hear. The wording on several of these challenges doesn‚Äôt seem consistent to what‚Äôs used in the dailies.
---
Usually I get the start of the animation and then the person just runs away like nothing happened.
---
Can get you downed with ease in more situations than you might think
---
I love Trapper with a few of the addons but other than that I just can‚Äôt enjoy him. By the time traps are set, you‚Äôre massively behind, and it‚Äôs rare people get caught in traps unless you‚Äôre already chasing them (so it doesn‚Äôt really save that long).
---
Maybe I‚Äôm using him wrong though
---
While yes that makes more sense. I would love the idea and concept of rin being both a survivor and a killer.
---
But it's cheaper to get it from the shrine? What's the point of spending 1 mill BPs to level him up when the shrine one costs an equivalent of 150k BP?
---
Because your dumbass bought the entire outfit instead of just the cloak. The mask and the knife are basically the same as his old shit. I personally never buy an entire outfit the weapon is nearly always a waste of money.
---
Okay but like fighting and graffiti is different from slaughtering your whole family
---
Little toys that are barely visible as survivor and sweet looking on hooks as killers, plus cosmetics and the halloween skins, plus plus your money back if you grind enought
---
You'd still be punishing them at the start though. And 4 hooks? One of your friends could be dead with that and you'd be by yourself if your only in a 2 man. So that penalty definitely isn't worth maybe 500 extra Bloodpoints and ontop of that you would've just been a burden on the solos just because you wanted to play with your buddy. People would probably start looking at swf as the new p3 Claudettes, they're just gonna be a burden and not wanna play with them.
---
Actually I did. Hence why for every hook action you have the opporitunity to take 3% off the regression total. Meaning that an optimal full SWF can lose that progression penalty in just 6 hook actions.  Although I did just think of numbers off the top of my head because again, I'm looking for a discussion on what can be done. Not a million reasons my idea is bad without you even giving ONE idea on what can be done. Like, c'mon buddy, you got any ideas of your own? Hm?
---
10/10 I'm downloading em now
---
Nea burned down the asylum and David was just a huge asshole to everyone. I get what you mean but they still aren‚Äôt good.
---
Because it costs 2,000 Shards to get it from the Shrine which takes longer to get then 1 Million BP.
---
Wow, I‚Äôm an idiot.
---
Looking for all the fucks he gives
---
Did you take note of the names? I'm a Jeff main around rank 4!
---
Plague, her power is unique and very fun to play with and can be really powerful when the game goes right. I‚Äôd also recommend Michael as he‚Äôs really fun to use.
---
Each survivor has a set amount you get from them, there's no way to reset their amount so once they're empty that's it. That's why ghost face is played as a "better Myers" since he can stalk as much as he wants but it's only one at a time whereas Myers can get multiple at once
---
It could be a reference to themusician Akira Yamaoka, who made the soundtrack for most of the Silent Hill games.
---
That, or it's just a name.
---
It's just random chance when it shows again. You might get offered it next level or not for 50 levels.
---
Cool story bro do it again.
---
Showing no mercy lmao
---
why is he so super tall bte
---
Nurse is still better than Spirit, easily.
---
No sorry, taking names of 501 survivors is a lot of work lol, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I did play with/against you!
---
Again? They never did.
---
no joke
---
Would recommend plague I have lots of fun with her and her teachables are all solid. Although, Micheal is fun as well and in the right hands very powerful especially by using tier 3 well. Another killer you should look at is ghostface. Stealthy, can instadown and has nice teachables. (Some)
---
Yeah, the bar is pretty broken lmao. I guess there are worse things that could break in this game.
---
Can we have the exp formulas or a bar fix?
---
The socalled "Bloodpoint Economy".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just kidding, it is a tool to keep "engagement" up. Game companies that provide live services love "engagement".
---
They should definitely add Shaggy.
---
This has been me with Enduring on Wraith. I have him at III-50 and have probably levelled him ~40 times since then (most pre-web changes so only 1 perk at a time but still) and don‚Äôt even have it at level 1. I just wanna try double Shadow Dance pallet breaker wraith :(
---
Yeah, I don't think i'm going to complete it either. Takes a while to level without challenges, not sure why they said it takes an hour a day when it doesn't.
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
This is a cool idea but I‚Äôm 90% sure it‚Äôs going to be an ancient demon/evil connected to their family rather than Rin‚Äôs father.
---
Nurses and Franklins. Is just mean and uncalled for. I luv it! I want to give fellow survivors Bros a little heads up. I would change your challenge for healing in a game for a day or too. Like I said. Killers are running NC,FD,SB,DL and thanatophobia. It's a powerful soft counter to all the Claudette's in med kits. Don't camp pallets unless you have to. Once I see a guy camp a pallet I'm going to chase him slowly because I know this guys going to drop every pallet just to get them out of the game ASAP. Don't stay at the other end of the map to stop 2 basement hooks. Again you are leaving a dead zone. Less for killers to patrol. If they have education then maybe stay away from the basement. Then again if killers are staying next to the basement and you can gen rush. At no DCs for me in 8 games? That's a record!!! I love people want to stay to get points towards challenges. I'm just saying we are all telegraphing what challenges we are going for. Be mindful. Maybe switch them around. I'm loving today boy. Fun as hell with no DCs . Lastly. Don't be that guy that screws over your other teammates so you can finish a challenge do them naturally.
---
Most likely it‚Äôs the Yamaoka who came to Japan. It‚Äôs his mask, so it‚Äôs his katana. And it‚Äôs more likely that we should know next to none about this killer, too. The only two playables who connect are Jeff and Legion.
---
When I play survivor I‚Äôve had to wait about 3-5 minutes every time
---
üëçüèº
---
I mean yeah it's Spirit's dad I'm sure but...just for shiggles:
---
Chapter 14: Kill Bill
---
Billy is good with enduring and spirit fury for sure
---
Please dont buff hag either, please. Unless she gets reworked along with it.
---
I'm jealous but lol understandable with this challenge xD
---
True, let me rephrase it to goodish survivors
---
I think it‚Äôs a bug, happens to me too as survivor but *ONLY* when someone puts bloody party streamers. For some reason that add on always kicks me out mid match
---
Ah i see your a Person of culture with your skin choice aswell
---
If he hit you before you went in you would‚Äôve died. I learned it‚Äôs quicker for the killer to finish cleaning their blade then it is the survivor to fall, meaning they could‚Äôve shut it first
---
MRROFLWAFFLES!
---
Hi guys!
---
Why would someone have to have an idea to say they disagree with your proposed solution? I agree SWFs is just as much of an issue as it‚Äôs ever been but adding a base penalty isn‚Äôt a good solution. Even ignoring how builds based around that could either render it soulcrushingly OP or completely worthless, just making base actions take longer is a bandaid fix at best and actively makes the game less enjoyable at worse. 
---
I don‚Äôt know the key to fixing SWFs but I don‚Äôt have to to criticize an idea.
---
Yes, apparently all of a sudden it's the worst perks there is for a bunch of made-up reasons. People say it's quicker to have a teammate heal you blah blah blah. But it's just everybody jumping a train that one person started.
---
It's interesting to me how heavily those two game communities seem to overlap
---
Lol exact opposite for me. It said I got kept at my 9K and 11S ranks but I got moved to 15S and 14k
---
Okay, so tweak the numbers a bit. This is just a rough idea for something to do as well as it being balanced around skill of rank 1-3 as we should not balance a game around low skill play, we all saw what happened to Freddy when they nerfed him because the brown ranks weren't having fun. I've been hanging around the red for awhile now. Do you know how often a survivor is dead by the time 4 hooks and heals have happened at those ranks. None unless the killer desperately wants to tunnel which again at high rank play is not often or beneficial.
---
‚ÄúGarbage perk‚Äù that ‚Äúcounters two of the best killers in the game.‚Äù
---

---
I reached Rank 3, I rather be rank 12 and troll bot killers for my entertainment lol
---
She shouldn't be, though. It's stupid. She can't be both when there's only one of her. If they add Rin as a survivor, they're going back on all the lore they've tried to build for three-plus years.
---
gg piece of shit
---
Fuckin dumbass lmao
---
No I said Rins father would be the survivor not the killer
---
You can tell by how quickly and sharply they are able to turn, how consistently they are able to avoid mindgames due to quick camera control, how little they get stuck due to again quick camera control making sure they can keep.track of you and where their going... watch survivor gameplay on console and PC and I think you'll figure out a difference.
---
I don't spend my shards on cosmetics though. And I'm fine with buying dlc killers. They're all licensed ones atm now anyways.
---
I literally self healed half a health state and still got it sooooo idk lmao
---
Edit: "Reddit knows wraith is worse to play against than Spirit or Nurse"

Clown: You wanna hear another joke, Kane?

Chapter 14 has new killer and survivor not sure bout map. Check out there website to see the road map but yea there gonna continue adding killers and survivors
---
I cant seem to find that option.. only see things for cells and shards... :(
---
japanese pronouns are really neat
---
Just saying, instructions + Socket Swivel is the trihard toolbox
---
I'd love to see side-by-side comparison videos from both the survivor and killer's point of view, just so we can get a feel for how badly out of sync it is.  I had a match on the family residence a while back‚ÄîI caught a Claudette standing oddly in some corner and thought to myself, "that don't look natural," but eh, what the heck.
---
I walk over and perform several extreme acts of horrible violence.  Terrible screaming, blood fountains gushing over the walls, organs flying, all that jazz.  Then the game freezes for a solid ten seconds and suddenly I'm standing a good fifty yards away, facing a rock, there is no Claudette‚Äîand yet the Claudette player (who screamed from across the map after the matrix glitch) was shown as downed in the UI.
---
And that was the match where I murdered a rock so hard that Claudette, on the other side of the map, died.
---
Xbox is exactly the same anyway
---
*‚ÄúSpoiler‚Äù*
---
Better find a farming killer
---
I know the feeling. You know it. We are hurt
---
I know! I‚Äôm saying that whoever their reading, whether it‚Äôs survivor or killer, isn‚Äôt going to be her father. 
---
Maybe they‚Äôd release both a killer and survivor at the same time though?

Now, I may be wrong because I‚Äôve only recently returned, but isn‚Äôt self-care 50% of the speed of being healed by a different survivor? And, assuming that is the case, surely it‚Äôs just as efficient for 1 survivor to take 200% time as it is for 2 survivors to spend 100% time? In fact, given if 2 people work on the same gen it‚Äôs a bit slower, it‚Äôs surely even less effective for someone to heal you? And this is ignoring the fact that having 2 survivors together is rarely better than them being separate anyway (at least in my experience as a killer).
---
Indefinitely until they go bankrupt I‚Äôd assume
---
&gt;Xbox is exactly the same anyway
---
Except servers aren't enabled on consoles.
---
My tip is to play dwight with leader and prove thy self
---
2-3... plus 3,000
---
Well yes, everyone can be wherever they want haha. This is just encouragement for those who are struggling n.n
---
How the hell would we know
---
This is pretty easy since you only need to to activate three gens, not do them by yourself. They worded it badly.
---
&gt; Balance is this. "If you miss the skill check, you are broken for the rest of the game. If you succeed, you are broken for 3 minutes."
---
Hmmm. That's better than what it currently is I'll give you that much. But in the end we both know that they'll never give a survivor's perk a drawback that is in any way helps the killer out in any significant way. Because they suck at their jobs.
---
&lt; in defense of dying light
---
There is no defense of Dying Light. It was nerfed and they called it a "rework". It was another lie on top of their many lies. A 25% debuff when one survivor is killed is MUCH MUCH better than getting a measly 3% per hook. And though the obsession was given a ridiculous healing/unhooking buff it didn't matter because the obsession was the one that the killer had to kill to get the debuff on the other survivors.
---
But killing the obsession fast was "not fair" so they nerfed it then lied about it being better. Killing a survivor fast is the whole damn point of being a killer. Not to these low skilled survivor main devs and their low skilled survivor main players though. In their eyes, a killer is suppose to two hook everyone, kill one before the endgame, kill one during the end game, and be happy about it. A 3k or a 4k is something they couldn't get if their lives depended on it.
---
&gt; There HAS to be some kind of catch for it.
---
Well, when they give survivor perks catches then a killer perk should have a catch. Until then, no killer perk should have catches. Do it for both sides or don't do it at all.
---
But if I were in charge of the perk it would be:
---
*Each time you hook a Survivor that is not the Obsession and the Obsession is alive, gain a Token. If the Obsession is alive, all others Survivors get a 3/4/5 % stack-able penalty to Repair, Healing, and Sabotage speed for each Token. If the Obsession dies, your tokens are frozen in place unless another survivor becomes the Obsession.*
---
The **only** drawback to STBFL, PWYF, and Dying Light should be that the killer can't gain more tokens if the Obsession dies unless another survivor becomes the Obsession. It does it for STBFL, and it should do it for all the other Obsession perks too. Obsession perks are not fucking hex totems, the killer should NEVER lose his obsession perk in the trial just because one survivor dies. It's not cleansed, it's not a hex, so it should always stay in the trial. What moron dev really thought this was a good idea? I wouldn't hire him/her to pump gas in my car, much less balance a video game.
---
Hey devs, while your overcharging on nonsense cosmetics and the battle pass.. how about actually tweaking perks that actually improve the game. But that doesn't make you money though amiright?
---
I think considering the fact that we got two survivors with unique perks last chapter, not having a survivor with this standalone killer would make sense. It‚Äôd be nice to have a new survivor but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we didn‚Äôt get one.
---
Yeah you right. I feel the same with others - hag only needs body, billy only needs torso, etc
---
It was a bad situation made worse by bad conditions, but plenty of people have sick family members who've lost their home and HAVEN'T murdered their fucking family over it. Even in Japan.
---
My problem is luck cos I keep getting sent to Springwood and the basement is at the shack instead of the school where they like to run around :(

Right, it counters the 2 best killers in the game!

Sorry it took me a while to reply, I was waiting for some friends to come online so we could double check. Your reply made me question myself since I was 70% sure I couldn't see a cloaked Wraith under Kindred in a public match. 
---
As it turns out, after double checking, I was right. Kindred **does not** trumps Undetectable.

It‚Äôs not her father it‚Äôs the original man who made the Yamaoka name mean something in Japan, enraged at the sad excuse that became his family name when Rin‚Äôs dad murdered her and her mom.

Thats just not true, the best legion in the world doesn't stand a chance against the best swf in the world. As nice as the idea is that every killer is viable in any situation is just isn't true.
---
You don‚Äôt have to do them start to finish FYI
---
MY MOM!!!!! WOOOOOOOO
---
I usually only experienced these kinds of hits on peer to peer connection. But recently I've been getting hit much more in odd positions on dedicated servers. Peer to peer is understandable, dedicated servers is unacceptable
---
Nice. Challenges seem alright, am looking forward to it.
---
I mean we can have four Claudette‚Äôs running around at once, someone who is both a killer and a survivor isn‚Äôt too out there, especially since the entity is capable of pulling people from different periods of time.
---
Thanks for the amazing response.
---
Just gonna shame me for wrongthink instead of explaining why I'm wrong...  
---
I mean, Meliora is straight up saying they want a EZ way of basically rendering a Killer's power useless, especially in high ranks, and I'm calling them out, but sure. I'm "up my ass".
---
You agree with them completely, I assume?
---
But leader does nothing to gen speed
---
Bone Clapper (yes, the yellow add-on) + The Ghost add-on on wraith has allowed me to already get maybe 10 grabs in about 30 games. Surprisingly good combo given it‚Äôs just a yellow and brown add on. Just uncloak behind wall, wait a couple of seconds so their guard is back down and pop out (or just uncloak behind a wall and utilise the speed boost and hope for the best).
---
Did it one match so i wouldnt make my teammates suffer longer than they needed too. God bless us all
---
How u 99 a survivor?
---
I did none of the dollar actions
---
If I remember correctly, the reason boxes are used in place of bodies in Bioshock: Infinite is because Germany has a thing about dead bodies laying around in video games. So, some of these countries are definitely in the EU.
---
I'm pretty hyped myself as well
---
Ahh, I have that problem a lot when grabbing from lockers, so I know what you're saying.
---
It used to be you just had to get hit, they made it so you need protection hits and protection hits are super buggy and unpredictable
---
Ah dang. not banned but now if you are uncivil again you will be banned like you deserved the first time
---
All of whom can be thrown off somewhat if the survivor doesn‚Äôt make pain noises.

There was just a mistake with the upload, it's getting fixed ASAP according to Behaviour
---
I've honestly already been acting as a non stalky and it isn't going terrible so that video was spot on  what I need
---
Honestly the reason I decided to start playing again was because I heard about these challenges. They genuinely made me switch up my playstyle as a killer, and have motivated me to play survivor a bit more. They‚Äôre a great addition, despite some of the challenges being ridiculous
---
One time I had one person on hook I got destroyed all game as trapper so I hooked one person and I guarded it and the whole survive with friends group got so cocky and one person ended up stepping in a bear trap on accident I down to them than the other person try to go for the unhook I pulled them off and then put them both up right next to each other as the timer was nearing an end so I got two kills out of one because they got too greedy
---
Pig doesn't have a terror radius whole crouched.
---
Awesome, thank you. Grinds going to kill me.
---
Here's my take on this: I believe both Spirit and survivors need nerfs. I think the best way to buff lower tier killers is to nerf survivor progression/loops, since like you say, the game is heavily in favor of survivors versus most killers. The problem is, survivor nerfs cannot happen organically without nerfing some overperforming killers (i.e. nurse who's now a better balanced killer imo), otherwise every game will turn into a hatch game.
---
But first, I feel like you are misinterpreting the numbers to fit your narrative. Taking 30 secs avg to down someone is actually very much in favor of the killer. Sure the first couple of gens will gain progression, but the killer also gains momentum with every down. After the first hook, another survivor will get chased, one survivor will go for save/heals, which leaves only one survivor potentially on a gen. By the time the rescued survivor is saved/healed and on a gen (which is easily 30 secs), you will have another ready to go on hook. This basically keeps only 1\~1.5 survivor working on a gen at any moment, unless you get in a particularly bad/poorly played chase. But survivors also have 5 gens to work on (through ruin/DL which tends to add a lot of time), and killers have the option to go after the death hook if they want to slow progression. And with 1 death the progression slows down drastically. It takes many mistakes for the Spirit to lose in the above scenario. Instas/BNPs used to kill said momentum, but not anymore. Besides, survivors (unless in SWF) tend to be very unreliable even in red ranks. I often see one or two survs who don't pull their weight even in rank 1\~2 range (and occasionally immersed blendettes). You can't balance around super optimal group of survivors or SWFs, when most of the games are played by solo/duos at best with disorganized groups. So against most red rank matchups, Spirit has the advantage imo.
---
So yes, I believe Spirit needs a tweak. She has too much in her package with practically zero downsides atm. And her ability being on a super low cooldown (5\~10 secs if you're using it in chase) just makes it extra unfun for those in the receiving end since that's just nonstop mindgames which you are forced to participate in. But of course, I agree that survivors are too strong atm (I'm tired of having to wait for rank reset for the chance to play weaker killers like wraith/doctor/bubba/etc and still have fun). Which is why I think a universal rebalance is needed.
---
that's ghostbody, ghostface's little brother
---
Hail to the king, baby.
---
Ghostface ain't OP, but he is fairly strong. One of the reasons why the motherfucker can get a 4k just from using the power without crouching or stalking at all
---
Well, if you are not using those shards anyway, you might as well use them. Or wait for the next killer who is probably not going to be licensed.
---
&gt; I hate Spirit but i forced to play her because any other killer suck so bad vs good SWF
---
SWF shouldn't be that common though.  And Spirit is only broken right now because Survivors get 0 information from her when she uses her ability.  The "shards glow when she uses it" tell is a joke and can be covered up with skins if folks can even see it in the first place.
---
Why does it say in a single trial? Bugged?
---
Seems you're confirmed dishonest then.
---
Nice projection BTW. Thinking I'm complaining about vaults and walls when I'm just naming his weaknesses.
---
If you're too scared to run ruin I would recommend trying surge it causes a 17% generator reduction on any generators 32 M away anytime you down someone so it works and you don't have to go out of your way it's not as good as ruin but it's more consistent than ruin
---
The one for the crows you can disturb the crows on the boat in the swamp and it will count all 25.
---
You know, after a brief look at your comment history, you seem like a pretty toxic guy, and that‚Äôs sad to see. Being nice costs nothing, why not give it a try? :)
---
god i love you so much thank you for saying this
---
Looping is the only thing that survs can do to survive? If survivors just ran in a straight line like im sure u want them too, then games will always end in a 4k. The 'loopers' as you call them are the people actually decent at the game and dont go down on 10 seconds. The fact that you think spirit is fine as she is astounds me and its clear you have a very heavy bias towards killers. Play the other side and you may know what it feels like to go against a spirit.
---
Well then. You might wanna direct yourself to r/dbdgonewild

Man you know never to listen to someone when they call you a 'survivor main'.

It's really not that she's OP, it's that she gives 0 information for Survivors to work with when she uses her ability.  That is the core problem.

What the fuck? She looks like Michelle Visage

Maybe one day ;-;
---
Well CoD zombies is done. Come on over Milo!
---
Also right, you can run a perk that slightly throws less killers off 
---
*Or you can run a perk that actually does something powerful against EVERY killer good or bad*
---
like I said prior, no survivor wants to waste a whole ass perk slot for the CHANCE of running into 2 killers.
---
I'm ok with a totem counter being base for solo-survivors only if NOED is made base for killers (without the movement speed buff - just the one-shot ability after the gens are complete.)
---
If that version of lesser version of NOED isn't base, then a totem counter shouldn't be base either. 
---
Further, I don't think these devs have any intention of buffing solos. They talk a good game, but their priorities are only with whatever makes them money. If the playbase drops enough then they'll start trying to buff solo survivors to SWF levels.
---
"Which loopers LOVE and always default to."

Agitated Advantage bugged for me...shows its completed but doesnt do anything when I press and hold the button.  The other branch lets me progress just fine.
---
The resolution on that milk compared to legion is absolutely horrible
---
You just crouch next to the gen and walk forward so it kind of pushes your pig head into the generator. When she's crouched she kinda looks like she's in the repairing position and doesn't have a terror radius. Works better if you put yourself on the side of the gen that's less lit up. Definitely not optimal but hilarious when it works.
---
Ash, for sure, but the problem is there is no way for him to ever ***really*** die. Sure, he gets sacrificed in-game but he never actually dies. He's the chosen one. If he and all the Killers were put into a cage match with actual stakes being put out on both sides, Ash would win and walk away to fuck up his life again.
---
Escaped with a medkit, also counted, i don't understand those challenges anymore.
---
Everyone else: Who?

Clown is looking pretty good body and head. The last one I want is hag's body(oh my) and I think I'm done with serum chasing.

Ash. Why is this even a question? Lol
---
Because Joe Keery is 5'11".
---
Mine seemed much quicker a week ago

at least he succeeded stunning the killer? lol

Because I guess he's the Youtuber/Twitch streamer? who's popular on this subreddit right now or something.

God this is the lamest meme in this game. And I'm pretty sure survivor's take advantage of it. Every Dwight I've seen in game has been an absolute dick. They either lead the killer to me when I'm on a generator or tea bag on the other side of every pallet when I play killer. Dwight is an asshole.
---
Hit em with the combo wombo
---
As someone with no real interest in cosmetics (I mainly play killer and they‚Äôre fairly worthless for someone in first person), but likes to support the game by paying for the DLCs, I spend iridescent shards on teachables I already have for the 150k bloodpoints. The goal of the game (for me at least) is to get every character to prestige 3 with all perks, so I don‚Äôt see a reason to buy new teachables when I‚Äôll just be levelling that killer eventually anyway.
---
No, the main reason it annoyed me is bc it was instantly after the save. So it didn‚Äôt do anything
---
Had the same thing happen on PS4. I depleted a brown kit, and it said I had done 3/6.

Not that I am complaining mind.

I know it was heavily implied but I forgot where it says that she did.

Urban Evasion, Iron Will, Quick and Quiet, Spine Chill
---
The higher the ranks go, the cockier the survivors get meaning they‚Äôll go for outrageously bold saves and you‚Äôll be able to do this one easier. Also using the Trapper for this one is optimal in my opinion. Hook one person in the basement. Go get a trap. Come back/wait for the unhook and place a trap somewhere at the exit from the basement. Yes, it‚Äôs pretty scummy, but you‚Äôll have to do it once and then never do it again. Not our fault the challenges are made up in a way to make us change our play style and play a certain way (that survivors may not be too fond of).
---
Yeah üòÇ
---
Sorry for the bad cropping, I tried to make the oni mask trasparent but I kept messing up so sorry about that
---
Got the same 'problem'
---
I would like to interject
---
Thats true, and I often see the counter argument of "you waste time looking for another teammate to heal." Sometimes though due to how long it takes to self care, you don't actually get to finish healing before the killer is on you again, while you have a better chance of finishing the heal if youre with another survivor. 
---
I guess it's more of a playstyle thing? I've seen instances where people will not stop self caring to rescue someone off hook, and theyd die in the process.    
---
Also, you are taking up perk slot with self care, healing others doesnt require one. Its a trade off, I suppose! I've just never been in an instant where I was like "damn wish I had self care right now" haha
---
I assume you don't want to argue if you're just going to ignore everything I've said. Especially the middle ground bit. Seems to be a thing a lot of Survivor mains like you REALLY want to ignore... ;)
---
Vault animation isn't necessary, that's the thing. Trash Spirits are super predictable with vault mindgames and great Spirits still don't fully understand how to do vault mindgames. It's a stupid complaint that can be understood easily.
---
I saw a *wonderful* post on the forums explaining big weaknesses with pretending to be phasing at a vault and how it can cost you loads of time plus the Spirit losing a chance to get a hit and giving time for the Survivor to run to the next loop.
---
inb4youthink"bluescratchmarks"isagoodideatoo
---
Like old Frank's Mixtape, Prayer Beads is the only thing resembling a legitimate complaint. And people on the official forums seems to disagree on that, as "reliable counterplay" CAN and WILL be abused by Survivors with a brain. Also, Trusted members proposing ideas like "blue scratch marks"... Their proposed nerfs don't account for the full repercussions of what they are asking for. People didn't know how to use Spirit until they realized sound was a major strength. Those nerfs will be taken advantage of in ways that nobody expects, simple.
---
It's really good on hillbilly, but i have found by playing that only works one time, once they know u have SF they drop the pallet early and that sucks, enduring alone is just as good as this combo imo.
---
&gt;That isn't supposed to be able to happen on dedicated. That was the point of getting servers.
---
Not really, depends on the quality of the server. I know a bunch of games that have server instabilities from time to time, causing packet loss and whatnot.
---
Looping is what a vast majority of red ranks default to. Stealthy isn't in their rulebook, they play VERY aggressive and confident and cut corners. Adrenaline is meta for a reason...
---
I see Survivors who run in straight lines as easy BP or high level counterplay against Frenzy, actually...  
---
Loopers can make chases go on for long enough that gens pop. That's all Survivors need to truly beat the game. 1 hook = 1 gen. Killers need 12 hooks to win and a minimum of 2 kills to even black pip at high ranks. If Survivors make one gen pop per hook, Survivors win.
---
It's why Killers bring NOED. It's why Killers play Spirit. Low tier Killers can't kill people fast enough for them to breathe, which is why they bring moris.  
---
This game is asymmetrical in such a way that nobody wants to play the other role in the game. There is a major issue that nobody wants to address because they want Survivors to remain the power role.
---
"Play other side" Oh YIKES, the amount of people who said that with Legion because they couldn't run in straight lines... People had legitimate complaints with Frank's, but Frenzy tunneling caused gens to pop, resulting in a loss for Legion, and they struggled to end chases without using Frenzy to down people. Making things very unfun for Legion. New Legion lacks the "gotta go fast" appeal old Legion had and has a all-around trash power that requires perks to actually matter.  
---
I actually play both sides. Sorry, Survivor main. ;) I've played Spirit and I know how difficult it can be to land hits with Spirit outside of power, and how easy it is to screw up a power hit.  
---
I would rather go up against a prayer beads Spirit than a fucking Trapper.
---
I saw a meme earlier about this, and now it makes sense.
---
I am on console and cannot do that.

This really isnt a thing after the new bloodweb changes lol

How tf was it more fun to find people then wait 7 seconds to be able to hit them? In comparison to having fake pallets/snares and being able to teleport?

Well while we're at it... It's "You're". If YOU'RE gonna be a grammar Nazi... Be accurate.
---
You don‚Äôt have to heal with the actual perk, healing a health state in any manner will activate 1 out of the 2 health state heals. It can‚Äôt tell whether or not you are healed with the perk or without it, so long as you heal and you have the perk equipped it will still work. (Plague cleansing, adrenaline, medkit heals) I think it just doesn‚Äôt work if another survivor heals you. Can anyone confirm this? I‚Äôm like 90 percent sure but I‚Äôd rather not get torn apart by reddit and I can‚Äôt play the game to confirm myself
---
Get fifty great skill checks, must be completed on the first generator started during the trial. 
---
-Must be completed during one trial
---
Just use what you like. I use Self Care because I hate relying on my teammates and med kits deplete after a while. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone else, it‚Äôs still viable
---
You‚Äôre right bubba&gt;nurse.
---
Gonna have to decline that offer, fam.
---
Sorry brethren
---
Absolutely correct, I'm disappointed in myself. I usually catch those auto correct errors.
---
YOU'RE only human ;)
---
Scarifying 2 obsessions would be doable, hard as hell but doable.
---
Kill your obsession then tunnel the next unhooked survivor and pray they have DS.
---
Damn people really hating on self care when it‚Äôs still very viable at rank 1. It‚Äôs situational just like many perks, obviously against an anti healing build it‚Äôs not good but at that point you probably won‚Äôt be healing anyway. And then you just play with 3 perks which is still more than enough for survivors to dominate a game with.
---
Fortunately, I was able to get this by trading with someone who was trying to do the Agitation challenge. Unfortunately, the only character I have Agitation T3 on is Trapper who I leveled first and has pretty much no other good perks. üòï
---
Yeah, arguing with someone like you is a waste of time.
---
You aren't arguing. You're ignoring what I say, cherrypicking the parts that are easy to attack, and trying to dance your way out of a argument you've realized you can't win.  
---
Here is the post I mentioned. It bugged out and didn't actually post the link I pasted into my reply... [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/821893/#Comment\_821893](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/821893/#Comment_821893)  
---
You're definitely dishonest. And exactly what I expected from someone who demands Spirit nerfs. You all are the same, I *swear*... jfc
---
Literally impossible? I've done it before. It just takes a garbage team.
---
Had the same bug recently. Thought it was caused by some weird mistake with urban evasion I was running. It was hilarious to run twice as fast as the killer. Eventually I was afraid that he might report me and I could get banned so I apologised  to him and explained. Pretty chill guy.
---
Don't know about the worst but she is definitely less enjoyable with the whole cooldown thing. You have to wait X seconds (if you used both blinks) while you watch the survivor you are chasing running in the distance. 
---
I think old base Nurse with add-on rework would be the way to go but devs never try one think at a time.
---
Nah, toxic is attitude not clothes. It's just that most people who play that cosmetic are trying to be Noob3 by being toxic but they have no sense of self awareness or irony like him.
---
Only way u can do it is if u lag a lot and jump in and out a couple of times and u get that
---
I believe in this instance it'd be lowercase (?), like Mettle of Man being MoM
---
I'm in agreement here. It's that as a survivor you have no way of knowing if shes near by when using ghee ability but unless you sit still and touch nothing she can see you. If there was a way of knowing it wouldn't be so bad
---
I'm not saying that it \*can't\* happen. I'm saying it \*shouldn't\* happen. The devs cheaped out on the servers and it was never even worth the switch. The reason that fans asked for them was so that these situations wouldn't be typical but they're super common.
---
Or, or... just hear me out... these are meant to be hard. You aren't meant to finish them all in one day.
---
Maybe. Just maybe.

ME AND CLAUDETTE WERE SELF CARING IN KILLER SHACK WHEN SHE FUCKED UP A SKILL CHECK AND PROCEEDED TO RUN RIGHT OUT OF THERE. 5 SECONDS LATER SHE RUNS INTO THE KILLER AND IS DOWNED. SHE KILLS HERSELF ON HOOK AND I GET AN ANGRY MESSAGE AT THE END TELLING ME IM A SELFISH BASTARD FOR SELF CARING INSTEAD OF HEALING HER.
---
ANOTHER GAME: 10 SECONDS IN, SOMEONE GETS DOWNED NEAR BASEMENT. 10 MORE SECONDS: SOMEONE GETS DOWNED ON TOP OF FIRST PERSON. BOTH GET HOOKED IN BASEMENT. THIRD GUY RUSHES BASEMENT WHEN KILLER IS STILL THERE. IS DOWNED. ME, BABYSITTER STEVE, IS COMPELLED TO TRY AND RESCUE. 
---
LOVE RANK RESET.

Violence to promote a political idea usually means the idea is terrible, and they have no coherent logical arguments.  Violence means you already lost.

If Entity already chose Rin instead of Rin's Dad, then why would it double back now?
---
Get gud
---
do you mean connect backstories?
---
nah, it's the road they're going down (what they'll be facing in the next match)

I made the meme I just used the picture and I just got the picture from google lol
---
You could ask any survivor and they would most likely rather go back to P2P connection if not for queue times alone. Dedicated servers have only hurt this game. The best thing that came about them was not having to re queue with your friends after every game and even that is messed up after every few games.
---
They are almost the Exact same thing
---
Are they out now?
---
Claud and Trapper are barely a quarter complete to be fair
---
Ok boomer
---
Spirit has always been using the wakazashi, they just had it labeled wrong for some reason.
---
Honestly, we need more mythology of various types in more games in general.
---
I think everyone is kind of sleeping on the African Grootslang. Done correctly, that thing would be an amazing bossfight.
---
Are you saying challenges should just be stuff that's likely to happen anyway? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of making them challenges?
---
If Sidney ever gets released then I‚Äôm 100% maiming her. Sorry Kate, but Sidney is where it‚Äôs at

It's not called Asperger's anymore. It's called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and she is high functioning.
---
That you're bullshitting, making tons of assumptions, and trying to provoke emotional responses.
---
Just because it offends you doesn't mean it's dead
---
Already do. Asian chicks are hot af.
---
Its called a katana in game however im pretty sure she has an addon that mentions a wakazashi
---
Depends on where you were at.  [Wiki has a list of what you'll be reset to based on rank.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank#Rank_Reset)
---
I mean, in the lore it does say that the entity can drag anything or anyone at any time given, which probably means that the dimension the entity‚Äôs realm take place on probably doesn‚Äôt have much notion of time
---
Freddy
---
Please don't say it like that
---
Freddy can reach her
---
Asperger's is what high functioning autism used to be called. It's now called Autism Spectrum Disorder. And it's a spectrum. She'd be high functioning. There's also low functioning and a kind of middle ground between high and low.
---
I guess every idealogy in the world has already lost, literally every government uses violence in some way to maintain structure, the police are a form of violence.

Holy elephant that is a beautiful creature... In the sense of the googled images and not like actually seeing it or something.

obviously Jeff met the legion
---
I know there's not many but there are more connections then just the one
---
That's a good point, it could be either really.
---
Carrot on a stick grinds belong in MMORPG and RPGs anyway. Not objective based PVP games. If the game isn't fun or engaging enough to stand on it's own then it's shit game anyway. 
---
Worse thing to every be added to these fucking games and completely ruined them. Old man rant here but I fucking miss the days people would just play hours up on hours of DUST and 2fort for months or years simply to win and be good.. now if a game doesn't crank out some fucking bullshit to grind towards every week it can't hold anyone attention.
---
Okay in that case it‚Äôs a server issue. But that is by far the worst I‚Äôve seen and I watch a very large variety of streamers so this definitely is not indicative of how dedicated servers are despite their problems 
---
But also survivors tend to say that about literally every hit so I also have some doubts about the veracity of that claim
---
And when all perks are meta.... None of them will be.
---
Wow, I did not know this. Thanks!
---
ITT: People thinking that optional challenges should be easy, require no change in build or tactics, should not require expenditure of resources, and should all be gettable on the first try
---
If you‚Äôre gonna play Bill you gotta swear right, it‚Äôs Bull-freaking-horseshit.
---
Technically you can escape twice in one trial if you get one of the few existing exit glitches where you escape but re-enter the match.
---
I know that the crossplay is just between Steam and the Microsoft Store, but like, before this was introduced I had absolutely zero lag (aside from the occasional killer who was using the data from their 2009 Blackberry to play the game), after this was introduced I get lag that's not only consistent, but sometimes makes the game unplayable.
---
Apparently if other people deplete medkits you get credit for it. Now I don't know if it has to be used on you or in general.
---
Stalking as Ghost Face, don't complete you're full stalk circle.
---
If I saw that thing in real life....
---
I have no shame, I'd probably shit myself.
---
Then uh, you may wanna check out some of my future content. Yes this is advertising, but i'm writing some more Feng, so...
---
.
---
If he's (an) oni, apparently there's a saying in Japan that's roughly translated to "a child who does not look like his parents is the child of oni". If that's really a thing, then it would make more sense.
---
To confirm, you only need to be on the gen at the end. I ran Prove Thyself and Better Together and it worked out well.
---
Or maybe Rin before she was killed could be the new survivor, it would make sense since bhvr said that a character could be both survs and killers at the same time and the entity can drag anyone from any time being
---
his mori is hin wasting his dragon blade then yelling at the mercy for not healing him
---
*as survivor
---
Until the game stops making them money.. tbh they could have a decade worth of content just from the plethora of horror franchises there are to choose from
---
Ah shit. We're going down down, baby... oh shi
---
A man driven to insanity by the entity is interesting to me, I kinda hope its Rin's dad + the ancestor though, like a possesion deal.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm so damn happy that Pennywise isn‚Äôt coming (at least for now). Would have been so disappointing for me
---
He could used the father to anger Rin and then be able to feed off her
---
I'm not going to try and reason with someone whose idea of an "argument" is 10% points and 90% personal attacks and smugness. It's fun to see you write a book in response to my one or two sentences without fail though.
---
Write her sitting on my face.
---
Oh okay that makes sense then, thanks!
---
I definitely did not deplete 6 medkits by myself and still completed the challenge so that might be true
---
Too hard for them to write some words in characters discerption obviously
---
No one:

Genji Mains: 
---
#*I NEED HEALING
---
Everyone always talks about waiting 7 seconds, but they never mention how much fun the aura reading, slowdown, and ability to choose who is allowed to see you was.
---
Old freddy was bad, unique and very niche. New freddy is viable, and that's all I can say about him. He's just another boring killer.
---
&gt;You could ask any survivor and they would most likely rather go back to P2P connection if not for queue times alone. Dedicated servers have only hurt this game. The best thing that came about them was not having to re queue with your friends after every game and even that is messed up after every few games.
---
The funniest part is, this feature was also present while P2P was still a thing.
---
Nope, people are just complaining to complain
---
Lol, how could I forget
---
As a survivor main I respect her the least of all the killers. Once I hear the blinks, I‚Äôm just sprinting around the map full tilt, no stealth needed
---
The picture is of an oni, a creature from Japanese mythology. Just in case you didn‚Äôt know.
---
Ash's only real threat is Freddy tbh. And it's the fucking remake version, which is nowhere near as powerful as the OG Freddy, whom Ash has fucking bodied in a fight before in the comic book Freddy vs Jason vs Ash
---
And now I'm going to be making left tit jokes about Jane for the rest of my years playing DbD.
---
Holy shit i did not realize how much i wanted this until now dammit
---
I'm loading up in a Lobby to play Trapper right now. I'll confirm that I can do it, but I know for an absolute fact that I can. I can walk over the Trap immediately after I have set it. I've never tried waiting any amount of time after I set it to walk over it but it does work immediately.
---
Oh sh**t just call me Fred if these mystery because I‚Äôm getting to the bottom of it thank for the starter point and sorry for the terrible joke.
---
so hes wearing a toupee?
---
So much this. I feel like i have to play lv 3 BBQ every game until i have all the perks i want for all killers and at least 1 survivor. Only then i will be truly free
---
ah so you are the 3 year old ..
---
Nope.
---
Ngl I legit thought it was the game because of the purple lighting. Take my updoot you fantastic cosplayer
---
No I specifically said 4 years old plus
---
It does say by any means ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I went there too but I'm no good on that map .-. Maybe the Jigsaw map would be good

Is this why I have only seen the og ghostface skin like 3 times out of my 30 games I played today?
---
Someone said on another post that you just have to be on it when it pops
---
Chainsaw two survivors as the Hag.
---
I apologize, i read at a 3 year old level
---
Must be an unusually large number of 3 year olds on today
---
I despise using Self Care, but looks like I‚Äôve got to run it now lmao
---
Bruh, SAME
---
Maybe the guy who made the Yamaoka name feared? The guy who wore the Oni mask in the first place?
---
Actually ive heard theories about the whispers. (Sorry I forgot those were mentioned in the lore :b ) Instead of it actually being the Entity it's the Oni that is connected to the mask. It belonged to a fierce warrior the spilled lots of blood with the same katana Rin's father used. So from what I heard, after The father spilled the blood of the family maybe it awakened the Oni? In the teaser we can see the blood moving towards the mask. I see this a one of 2 things. 1. It's shows that things are reverting back in time 2. The 1 I believe is that a blood ritual has been done and the Oni is being summoned. That's what I think. Do you have anything that goes against what I said or any comments?
---
That's not Tru3 wrong hat color, must be some impersonator.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised actually! They use the new chapter launch to balance Spirit AND start that trend. I like that a lot.
---
I nearly got it as the trapper but she DC'd but also that's a good tip thnx!
---
I wonder if you heal yourself with inner strength. Would it still count?
---
He has the same voice and looks eerily similar to him
---
Console killer FPS  is so shit. I like playing survivor because it‚Äôs a bigger challenge (inb4 crybabies come, solo q survivor is MUCH harder than killer. Solo q &gt; killer &gt; SwF)
---
True
---
I just find it hard to belive sonce Rin(Spirit) swore vengeance against her father. She wants to kill him. So that's why she kill for the Entity because the Entity promised that vengeance.
---
You could get the This is not Happening trial with autodidact
---
Well fuck it‚Äôs spirit 2.0
---
Thank god and also you
---
You clearly have a short attention span, I said ‚Äúusually‚Äù violence indicates the ideas are bad ones.  The difference between different forms of violence is whether it was in self defense in response to a tangible physical force or not.  The American Revolution from the oppressive British Empire is a classic example of violence in self defense, taxation was a tangible physical force oppressing the settlers combined with little free speech to express the suffering they were going through.  The only way forward was to ignore the governments laws and force their ideas to be heard, then the SHATW happened and the rest is history.
---
Antifa is made up almost entirely of spoiled, sheltered, mid-upper class echo chambered white students who haven‚Äôt had a job in their entire lives cosplaying as political activists spurred on by their leftist professors, Twitter mobs, and mainstream media to commit violence against a non enemy.  While they are in a daze rioting and causing millions of dollars in damage to public property, macing innocent men and women, people are actively turned away from their degenerate regressive ideas and learn to hate them and their black masks used to hide and cower.  They instigate violence against whatever is nearby, mostly innocent people that aren‚Äôt bigots or whatever.  
---
I have nothing else to say to you.
---
Ooh, good comeback
---
Ive found out juni b jones books are bomb if you want recommendations on some new stuff to read
---
Just heavily put your attention on gens, i‚Äôve done it. Did it take 3 games to get it? It actually took me 4 games to achieve it.
---
How are the perks blue?
---
Beginners mind, shunryu Suzuki
---
I thought pig only existed to be nerfed?
---
Seriously though at least give us kore bp for these challenges or actually make it so that all these challenges give you a total of 1 million bp so you can hit at least level 35 on a killer
---
I hated that challenge, man. If you aren't in a SWF, then you need to burn coins to generate enough chests to go search and loot enough chests to get them done. It sucked.
---
There actually will be 2 survivors, 1st one is top half of the mother and the 2nd one is the bottom half
---
I did it, but it cost me a ton of blood points I kept trying to drag everyone to the basement regardless the distance lol.
---
Proxy camp every hook in stalk mode. That's what every Ghostface I go against does.
---
Spirit was vaguely promised vengeance for being murdered in exchange for killing people in the trials. Having the dad as the survivor would allow the Spirit to have her revenge.
---
Sloppy, ruin, thana, and nurses are pretty good perks for him and hes really easy to learn as long as your main goal isnt to stalk people because it wont go well just use the shroud to sneak and stab thats pretty much it
---
*myers on three stacks of PWYF
---
What the fuck is going on
---
Stop ruining my main
---
He wants a different finger than the chicken fingers he had earlier
---
I said. Its a smol price to pay for looking cool, who cares if its "deifying physics." i deify physics all the time.
---
I'm convinced it's purely a "Fuck You" to some element in the match.
---
Whether it's:
---
* "Fuck your BBQ stack, not getting extra points from me!"
---
* "Fuck your emblem points, not getting credit from me!"
---
* "Fuck my team, I hope they all die!"
---
* "Fuck this specific add on/map/whatever, I don't like it so I don't want to play against it"
---
Basically, something along those lines where people view D/C'ing as some sort of spiteful action that will make the other players feel bad.
---
If/When BHVR actually creates the 'husk' system where a temporary body sticks around in the match to be hung on a hook then these rage quits will lose all potency.
---
Don't forget the obligatory revved chainsaw face camp after you have your 2 hooks.
---
Glad to hear you got it! With agitation plus iron, you can drag those pesky survivors halfway across the map.
---
Anyone that uses NOED uses the speed buff since that's part of it and can't be avoided. No one will purposely slow themselves down.
---
And since even a lesser version of NOED isn't ok, then neither should a totem counter for solo survivors. 
---
Killers are the ones that could use a totem counter anyways since more information for us is of more importance than for survivors since we are truly alone in the game and can only depend on ourselves. Survivors already have Small Game which makes getting rid of totems *stupidly* easy. No doubt thought of by a dev who has the skills of a five year old when playing survivor and needs a lot of help to find totems.
---
Small Game should work like Whispers and only give a sound alert if the survivor is within 48/40/32 meters of a totem, not when you are right next to the damn thing.
---
Oh yeah, It's Big Brain Time
---
Umm okay..
---
because dumb ass survivors don't like losing and think that disconnecting counts as a draw. it's stupid and repeated offenders need to be punished
---
Okay but why 'normalize' something that isn't normal?
---
I'm conflicted because Hag blight body makes her so cool but there is also the skin from the rift, and some other cool cosmetics for her on the store. I want the Blight skin for so many killers and its so limited in quantity! Doctor body+head is really cool. I do wonder if skins change the hag traps and doctor hallucinations
---
Thank the Spirits that Spirit isn't getting nerfed Entity rejoice!
---
Diavolo looks ten seconds into the future to see what everybody will do. Everybody moves exactly according to that prediction, except Diavolo. He is the only one not trapped in the ‚Äúerased time.‚Äù When the ‚Äúerased time ‚Äú is over, everyone forgets what they did during it except Diavolo.
---
I see what you did there

So confused

I see the resembelance but the eyes look off
---
‚ÄúWell time to jump out another window, this time off a skyscraper‚Äù (great art btw)
---
Well I'm a fucking idiot.  I definitely can.
---
That is 100% Tru3...
---
Good thing I finished it on my first try, I'm afraid of the other challenges though 0_0
---
Maybe. I dont watch Tru3
---
Aren't Oni only female?
---
Downvoted for speaking the truth
---
Classic Reddit
---
Same here. I thought we'd at least be more than Quentins
---
Bad game servers lol. Maybe killer lagged out or something
---
Im not very savvy with things like this, but is there some tutorial somewhere on how to get this in your game?
---
I mean, my second game as Survivor I busted out three gens while trying to get my Self Care challenge done. So it's definitely possible, if maybe a bit improbable.
---
As an aside; Jesus christ guys, there's a Self Care challenge going on. If you unhook people, don't crowd around them, wait a second or two to see if they start self-caring to get the challenge done. Sorry, not sorry, thems 35000 bp is more than we're going to make in the match anyway.
---
As an aside to the aside: DE, why the heck did you put "You must self heal" **in the same damn bracket as** "Heal other people"? That's just going to cause a ton of frustration to everyone.
---
I was thinking about this a while ago and I dont think swf would fuck with it as much as people think it would. Obviously it would fuck with it to a degree, but there would still be times where you get the drop on people. 
---
And from a player who does swf regularly, they would automatically become the most fun killer to play against due to the clusterfuck that voice chat would become.
---
I made the mistake of trying vs SWF I dropped one due to overestimating the distance to the basement and 2 to some sort of god tier flash light.
---
Classic Ghostface Robes suck to play as. The sleeve and arm tassel block 25% of the screen while in Night Shroud. Really shows Devs don't playtest all too much, can't believe the robes were shipped the way they are.
---
Impressive! Those are adorable!
---
They didn't actually post this BTW.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for my stonedface
---
That's not a joke.
---
It's fact
---
What doesn't work like that? The challenge or tangible proof?
---
My problem is the idiotic design of these challenges being completely illogical and tedious.
---
don't be afraid to stalk from far away, survivors may struggle to see you if you're leaning from a distance and may also stop you from being revealed. always 99 a survivor then use your stealth mode to get close and the rest is self explanatory
---
Thank you!!! :3

im sad i lost bloodpoints for this match ahahah

Myers three stacks PWYF + Bloodlust 3 + teir 3 NOED + Sprint Burst
---
poor legion...
---
Why does this seem like exactly what happened ?
---
I‚Äôm glad u do
---
What indication do we have that the new killer will be anything like spirit whatsoever?
---
No, death refuses him. That‚Äôs why he haunts dreams. He can‚Äôt live physically, but his soul can
---
Just saying I would have liked it better. Also satan as a killer seems better suited than a alien demon dog.
---
Lol. That's ok tho. BP racks up pretty quick when you just play and have fun. Glad to have you in our community. But be careful for the really toxic people here.
---
I'm on mobile but its by J√§ger Himself Too video called 2016 pros are 2019 coppers or something from 8 months ago. Hes there in the last 5 mins of the vid
---
Damn, guess some people actually need an /s so they can see that it's obvious sarcasm.
---
I like the P3 Freddy below it. The poor screenshot makes it even more red-tinged and Freddy's expression pretty much says "I had to kill so many fucking people. I'm the dream demon and I'm actually fucking tired of doing this shit."
---
do you want funny memers or people who help you git gud at the game, otz,scottjund,ohtofu and painreleiver make good tutorials videos and guides.
---
didn‚Äôt expect to see milo on here lol
---
Double points if the survivor easily survived but was on the 2nd hook.
---
Creepy man, Tru3 should really learn about this impersonator.
---
They said they want to keep the game going for at least 5 more years
---
No, as a Stephen King reader im legally bound to inform you that Pennywise is formless alien goo light. And if we ever want to chance at defeating it we need the help of the Galaxy vomiting dead turtle and a known as TSCHUUUUUUUUUUUUTH.
---
Everyone wants punishment and I get it but all we really need is this "husk" system and the vast majority of these DCs will fall away when people realize they are not screwing over the killer in any way.
---
Oh joy, another mid-tier-at-best killer. Cause after what they did to the Nurse and want to do to the Spirit, this new killer sure as hell won't be on their level. Nor Freddy and Billy's level either.
---
Can't wait. I'm sure it ~~won't~~ will really add variety to the red ranks.
---
Thank you!!
---
You just have to be on a gen when it finishes, three times. What is illogical or tedious about that?
---
This sounds like if Lovecraft wrote something while on copious amounts of LSD
---
I dunno, I've never encountered any of those yet except for those who knows how to hide while moving, but that's applicable for any survivors so that doesn't count
---
The in a single trial part.

Yeah it's nice when a healthy survivor accidently hits my traps mid chase, but other than that, survivors dodge my traps once they figure out I'm playing trapper.
---
As I recall they didn't actually get the movie rights they got the costume rights because this ip is a shitshow where they costume came before the movie leading to different non-partner ownership
---
What's so hard about being on three gens when they finish in one match? Did you think optional challenge rewards would just fall into your lap?
---
I always wonder when she showed up in the fog if the other survivors were like ‚ÄúHoly shit! It‚Äôs Jane Romero!‚Äù or what the aftermath of her disappearance was back in the real world. I hope someday her lore is expanded and we get some more answers.
---
Wonder if he will be similar to Bishamon from the Darkstalker  series. Possessed armor/sword
---
what the fuck
---
Use stalk from the jump. If you can get the exsposed effect off do it but it's far more useful to use it to gen yank or get a free hit. It's also good even if they see you first because you will know someone is near.

You know what I'm not arguing with someone who's clearly not willing to listen. The challenges suck, everyone agrees. You're wrong deal with it
---
It's really fuckin dumb tbh lol. A game that is already on the cusp of being considered toxic and salty along with other competitive games, and they design a game mechanic to make everyone play retarded as survivors, and sweaty as fuck as killers. They just fostered the worst environment possible and this is just the beginning.
---
Huh okay thanks for bringing me up to date
---
Stealth bubba mode activated.   Then again, even if it starts working, someone will dc
---
LOL
---
Mine actually bugged out and in one match using a brown medkit, it supposedly counted as 3. Next game counted as two and I finished the challenge by the third match.
---
We want smut. 17 shades of the entity. Bang a new killer each night to escape. I know it's not your story but a spin off wouldnt be bad.
---
down for speaking the truth
---
They will just then using killing the self on the hook as a work a round
---
I assume for colorblindness, op could be colorblind
---
I love this boi so much ;w;
---
That makes sense
---
Do you *know* how good some of these totem spawns are? It takes forever for me to find a totem with solely Small Game on some maps.
---
The totem counter would pretty much serve to bridge a little of the gap between 4-man SWF and solo queue.
---
I don‚Äôt see how this would affect gameplay at all. I see how it might affect gameplay if it shows you the *hex* totems, but if it‚Äôs just totems then... how?
---
Also Small Game is nowhere *near* broken. It‚Äôs pretty nifty, but little to no people run it because they‚Äôve already memorized totem spawns.
---
It‚Äôs literally just training wheels for totem finding, like Fixated is for scratch mark jukes (kinda).
---
Lol sorry
---
To be fair she's carrying 3-5 hatchets and a woodcutting axe at all times
---
Unless the Entity is a multi dimensional creature, capable of pulling different versions of people from different dimension. For example, David and Jake from the 1930s.
---
Mate half of this subreddit is over saturated with reused memes, give it a rest yourself and let the community be happy. Man you‚Äôre a buzz kill
---
Oh my god, thank you I actually was in the dark about this, but I still have the same thing
---
Don't eat the poo poo
---
Yeah I would think her father would be too obvious.
---
She looks so scared lmaoo
---
we're on the internet u fucking nerd
---
Oni killer?
---
man he needs to stop drinking if he's stumbling all over the place
---
And that's an insult how?
---
The Jane rework looking better than the original!
---
Oh, I just assumed there was a vacuuming noise in the background lmao
---
Feels. What‚Äôs more is having legit 15 minute queue times on killer bc you have no rank and live in australia
---
I wish I could get some ass to suck :(
---
What movie is this from?
---
Good let him suffer not being able to see. Ghost face is irritating
---
Thanks man
---
Ta da

ü¶Ñ

I'd admire it first while peeing my pants.

And hopefully it won't eat me

it's bad
---
Must be completed in a single trial
---
I can keep a secret too
---
&gt; gets stabbed by her dad again
---
Door is a physical thing ig
---
Your title implies he thinks this is how every killer should play, which is not what the actual post says at all. Also i agree with his stuff up until bullet 10.
---
Challenges are challenging
---
and urs was? ahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah you think you insulted me by saying what you said??? ahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhaha.. I wasnt trying to insult you nerd I was just stating something.. ahahahhahahahahahahahha
---
Ash kills the evil dead though. You member Linda? I member linda
---
Strange considering it literally says heal yourself
---
Well people usually say "don't let the door hit you on the way out."
---
Please don‚Äôt use unrelenting
---
Haha thanks
---
The Entity is capable of pulling killers and survivors from different dimensions... I think it might be capable of pulling the same person from an earlier point in time from a similar alternate universe, if continuity is really that important to you in a multiplayer 4v1.
---
yes! here is a tutorial from @datgeistra on twitter!
---
https://twitter.com/datgeistra/status/1118292376810872833?s=21
---
I mean, "Unhook another Survivor during EGC and have them escape the trial" would be a challenge that relies on another person but there's a very definite shared interest going on there.
---
"I must Heal you" and "You must heal yourself" isn't challenging, it's just frustratingly obtuse since we're arguing over the same health state.
---
I'm 22 lol.
---
This game is overall a joke toxic gaming at its finest lol get a game that‚Äôs actually fun or worth it &amp; not so toxic &amp; rage inducing
---
I don't play killer because of the low frame rate on PS4. I feel like I'm watching a slideshow when chasing survivors.
---
WHA-
---
Yeah exactly how I feel. I think the Ok Boomer/ Zoomer is even worst than "Nobody : Not even a single soul :".  
---
Although the absolute worst is "Hold my Beer". I can't stand that one anymore
---
It's like the blue eyes attack stat draining when Kaiba uploaded a virus to help Yugi against his doppelganger.
---
I saw 4 due to a bug and some were like in the endgame unhook 3 surviors. Must be done in a single trial.
---
Blind a killer 2 times while he's carrying a survivor. Must be done in a single trial.
---
for real my dude if you crouch at the end of the game near the exits you will make 9.9/10 killers wanna kill themself! its sad that a simple press of a button can do that to humans. they have not played halo
---
You know what the funny thing is?
---
I played Fortnite for a while there because a friend of mine was into it, and it's considered bad manners if you dance after killing someone in that game.
---
But whoooo boy did I get more hatemail with some good old fashion t-bagging.
---
Last time I babysat a baby its bones broke almost instantly. how do I sit on this mf without killing it?
---
\*Running\* \*Tripps\* \*Camera keeps moving and you just hear a faint sighhhhhh\*
---
I try my best not to tunnel because i find it more effective to spread the damage around, but if the guy unhooking you is obnoxiously trying to get my attention for a chase, im not goin out of my way to chase him like he wants me too.
---
Lol you got me
---
And me: "haha you have no friends you toxic immersed bitch!"
---
Bond prove thyself dark sense and run around checking gens til you find ones almost done with people on them
---
At least you are honest
---
Lol, I'm gonna be honest there's no way I could pity Claudette after what the playerbase has done to her.
---
your name is teddy bear 69 i hope ur not over the age of 15
---
I afk in the basement and make everyone depip, if I am going to be harassed by neon neas I want to earn my salt.
---
Personally, the problem I have is being able to do x number of things in a single match. For example, I'm lucky if I get two unhooks out of ten games, much less a single game. If match making wasn't so pisspoor at time, it would be easier.
---
This happens to me more when I play killer. Dumb luck will net me hooks all the time. More so than some of my intentional plays. I guess it's best to just try and pay attention so you dont make mistakes lol.
---
Yup.
---
The challenge is bugged and counts any heal
---
I mean killers are a lot harder to make than survivors because of powers but anything's possible
---
You don't even need to selfcare yourself, just heal with a medkit when you have self care equipped.
---
I was repairing a gen with a baby dwight yesterday and another survivor came in. I saw they wearing red and I thought it was a Claudette in a the fashion leather jacket (we had two on our team wearing that exact outfit).
---
Did a double take, realized it was pig, jumped out the window and got away.
---
Tedious and damn near impossible. Whoever made these challenges needs fired and shot
---
A game theory!
---
Tysm
---
I got bullied earlier for getting a 4k as a level 7 hag
---
It was my first time playing her and the most toxic guy was the one with head on, d strike and adrenaline
---
Protip for my killer friends, if you afk in the basement and spin in the corner you can make the survs depip.
---
Very nice work even if it hadn't been.
---
Didn't think about that
---
tecnically, you can but the survivors need to be extra potato, you can still grab in treatment mode
---
In either hers or the map's, yeah
---
Thank you very much
---
To me the Ok Boomer/Zoomer thing is basically in that same realm of braindead low effort retorts as the "your mom" ones.
---
Its only bannable in situations where the entire game comes to a halt, like if all 4 of you were up there and he didnt try to down any of you but instead just blocked the stairs and waited for everyone to dc. It's a dick move to do in some situations but in his case he probably considered it strategic, and he did eventually move.
---
I totally get why those situations are frustrating though.
---
All the negative likes are killers that lobby dodge and use spirit or survivors who cant reach red ranks
---
It counts even in the middle of the match. At least it did for me.
---
If one guy DCs and the Spirit still is gonna sweat a 3v1 with 5 gens left I‚Äôll just point to a hook. Don‚Äôt really care
---
Smh my head, looks like the entity is having itself a Great Depression
---
the first yamoka: watches from heaven proud as his descendant, the man of the house, works hard to keep his bright daughter in school and wife healthy\*
---
dad: has a bad day and kills family\*
---
the first yamoka: that's it im gettin me katana
---
10 is why I run head on
---
I did this today. You just gotta be on the gen when it pops
---
They mentioned the CGI is super expensive so it's unlikely they'll do much more of that quality.
---
Yeah when I DC it's purely to let the killer know I think something about what they're doing is bullshit. I know they don't really care and probably think it's funny but it's a principle thing
---
...Really. Because I don't see the problem in a battle pass. It's how it's executed that worries me. Red Dead Online did it well. You simply earn experience by doing what you've always done.
---
Tegridy*
---
knowing dbd spagetthi code, doing that might make myers able to stalk the ground and level up 
---
~~no wait~~
---
I feel like this is better for the killer, with maybe the dad as the surv.
---
O H N O
---
Not at all bannable. Dick move? Yes. Bannable? No.
---
Rebuttle. Continue to say it like that, infect let's make it an official way to refer to them having g a rivalry
---
Every dwight I find is in a locker.
---
They're related, sure. But why does anyone think they'll play similarly? Rin's power and gameplay has nothing to do with her libeage; she is a murdered ghost so she has ghost powers. Unless the new killer is also a murdered ghost (which we have no reason to assume, and which could be assumed just as appropriately about every killer BHVR comes out with) then there is no reason they would play sinilarly.
---
They might both use a katana, but all of the killers' weapons are identical mechanically (if I am not mistaken) and several killers already use the same weapons already.
---
That's the ideal. If every storyline just led to no payoff, I'd lose interest pretty quickly.
---
No, you'll take your pixel hair and you'll like it!
---
Jk, yeah they should totally change his model to the cinematic one. Also I feel you on the fact they should do a new one. It'd be really cool to see Nea,Ace, Feng, and David with The Huntress and
---
Adam, Jane, Jeff, and Kate with The Spirit in sequences like that.
---
What if he was just schizophrenic and it wasn't diagnosed?
---
I would really like them to release something original, which rins dad is original but it's still just basing off something else and I really hate how they have run themselves dry of ideas
---
What I did was practice timing my skill checks on gens to hit great ones. After that, DS came a little easier. Good luck.
---
He‚Äôs on pc, you can go into the game files and change the perk icons and portraits for survivors and killers.
---
even in NA i usually sit in queue for 30+ mins before giving up
---
....... no holes reference.
---
grabbing is sooooooo easy! use the doctor, hook 1 person, switch to treatment mode, spam the attack button behind someone who tries to rescue the person to grab them. drop them or hook them and repeat.
---
upvoting cuz turtle
---
I mean, have you seen how much Ghostface stumbles in the original movie? The guy should‚Äôve worn a black morph suit or something.
---
Oh it absolutely means flashlight saves. The devs are notably bad at wording phrases on things that matter. There's no such thing as blinding a killer that's carrying a survivor without a flashlight save. If you get a blind while he's mid animation, it doesn't really matter if he's technically carrying them, they aren't carrying them yet or are not carrying them anymore if you blind them mid-hook or mid-pickup, respectively.
---
My first was with the demogorgon but sadly the entire thing was blocked by a wall so it wasn‚Äôt watchable
---
I agree, the devs just didn't want to put much thought into it. Aw well, shoulda, coulda, woulda...
---
Wraith would be #1 because if he's hit by a pallet while cloaked, he's stunned for longer (even though he doesn't deserve that and it doesn't make sense). Enduring reduces THAT stun, and he's an M1 Killer who often can't attack, so he tends to eat/break pallets anyway.
---
am i boring or is this just desperately unfunny
---
My boi did today because some survivors bullied him :‚Äù(
---
i would mainly take away the time-consuming grinding ones like Golden Age T_T i'm okay at the risky ones like stun a killer twice in one match. that's doable enough. but the ones that require a lot of time are tedious. like the 13 sacrifices one too
---
That's Rockstar though. The difference of talent, staff, direction, foresight, planning, and good ideas between them and BHVR is like the difference between a Benz and a tricycle.
---
But then what makes a challenge Very Hard? Nothing in the game is terribly difficult on its own; and if it's all just "do X lots of times" then there's only so many things for them to have you do.
---
I mean they're not though. They have a mummy, werewolf and vampire are all original ideas that they could do instead of the demon thing they are doing now. Killers being unrelated is better imo because  it's completely new and exciting.
---
Even still, save your shards for a good perk. You can make BP fairly quickly, but if you see a perk you want on the shrine and you're short on shards, you're boned.
---
Reward: 3/10 of a level.
---
Papa Yama for survivor
---
Ancient Yama for killer
---
But two can keep a secret...if one of them is dead
---
It's actually pretty obnoxious if the devs ever claimed it improved anything.
---
So she‚Äôs op
---
Sucks they have to make impossible challenges.
---
It's slow, and being slow also makes it more vulnerable to Nurse's Calling.
---
That's what I want. Killers with no relation. Also they bent the whole humans thing with the demogorgon. I just think they are out and are dried up. Licensed killers are fun n all but can only go so far. To people thinking about pennywise. Its A BAD idea. Just stick with original. Make something that we haven't seen before. Ok cool spirit woah she can go invisible wow. No one cares. Don't bring her dad into this...
---
Or you just hear him faintly saying off in the distance ‚Äúf u c k-‚Äú

No, the servers are just trash. Apparently everyone's getting this problem around 5% of their matches. I'm changing games until it's sorted out, personally.
---
Actually no. It's a fact that self care is the least efficient way to heal in the game. It takes ages and wastes a crap load of time not to mention in you are mangled it's even worse. You are better off just doing a gen injured and waiting. That or bring a med kit.
---
I belive you do not. Once you have the perk, outside of being exhausted , it will always activate. I dont use to often so I could be wrong.
---
This meme doesn‚Äôt apply to me cus I‚Äôm a rank 13 survivor.
---
I kind of just skip the intro cinematic, so I'd rather see the budget go to making the game actually function properly.
---
Because they don't play the game.
---
You know you can just not get the mask right?
---
Don't worry; the servers are also broken.
---
&gt;it's literally the only objective.
---
It is the primary objective that allows you to escape. totems,  dull or hex serve as a side objective that gives bloodpoints while simultaneously denying killer perks (the hex in case of lit totems,  reducing thrill of the hunt and reducing the odds of noed for dull totems) not to mention that every map spawns with 3 chests that contains items that the survivors can loot to have an additional item to use against the killer. The issue comes down to these secondary objectives being ignored by the survivors in favor of solely doing gens and escaping.
---
I find matches almost instantly lol
---
My secret is to not buy cosmetics.
---
Most Survivors have good enough outfits to start and only four Killers can see themselves.
---
Not for me, people repair, slow, but they repair
---
Name of the original clip?
---
Probably more like White/Black Guardian, honestly. A protector mode to patrol, then a violent mode to attack.
---
Now we're talkin'.
---
For that reason alone. Definitely not worth it. The literal only reason to p3 is for the bloody cosmetics. I do it simply because, what else is there to do with blood points lol.
---
The ones using perks that only activate when injured or self-healing and the like are tripping me up because I generally play a more stealthy build overall so there's a lot of times where I'll get a bunch of gens and rescues and never actually get hit.
---
Its bugged. Itll be fixed
---
can it?
---
Why do you think it's a female demon mask? Just the long hair? It's not uncommon for Oni masks to have long hair.

---
Happy cake day!
---
Nah. I'm honestly shocked it took them this long to do it.
---
I agree. But what do you think about the suggestions I listed? In my opinion they are the killers I'd like to see added, mind you I'm a bit biased since I'm a huge fan of that stuff.
---
Personally teabagging is a disadvantage to them. If i can't catch someone after they tbag then it honestly means that i deserve to be tbagged.Flashlight clickers just want attention tbh so i don't care about that at all.
---
Its just a jeer, like when if you fuck up throwing a ball they would go "Nice throw dipshit" or something. Its just trash talk in a game where they can't do it, if you can't handle it then the internet and competitive stuff really isn't for you. Its kinda my wish that proximity chat would be in the game cause it would make the game so much funnier when you pallet a killer and go "Taste my wood bitch" or just jumpscare the fuck out of people
---
School them back by downing them. Sure maybe tunnel them a bit harder but facecamping just means they won lmao.
---
I play ghostface and when someone does it i tbag real quick and continue on, or tbag when i get the down once and continue on
---
Obession or jealousy..... that doesnt fit the mold for her mother does it? I'd still say its her father just wearing the mask.
---
„ÅÇ„Åò„Åå„Å®
---
I want every face of every current survivor and new survivors that get added in. 
---
Also, I want ‚ÄúSaw is family‚Äù chainsaw from that one atrocious movie. But it was an amazing line in Tcm 2.
---
Agreed, i think people are overestimating just how many 4-man doomstacks are roaming around, playing 100% optimally and escaping in 5 minutes tops. Is it possible for such a thing to happen? Yeah, absolutely, and it definitely shouldn't, but simply allowing broken killers to exist because only they stand a chance on the off-chance you bump into one such team is bullshit, especially since most of the time they'll just be facing uncoordinated randoms who will be easy pickings. 
---
IMO, alongside the Spirit nerfs, there needs to be some sort of SWF nerf, or at the very least a buff to soloqueue players whose existance is simply miserable at this kind of meta.

The third is open they have ascended!
---
I used the beads to destroy the beads!
---
Your edit conclusion is spot on. Sorry :(
---
I would love a except demogorgon is quite similar maybe. A mummy hell yes or maybe a vampire
---
No totem counter. Proximity chat would be nice, then you can talk with survivors when near each other and let each other know if they've done any totems.
---
Thats why we are blendettes, we dont want her to get hurt again ;-;
---
Also for Rin's father letting the estate fall into disrepair and be [repaired with shitty sub par materials.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dw09g6/who_did_they_awaken/)
---
They're amazing! I hope he/she likes them!
---
That‚Äôs how I play with my wife! Giggity goo!
---
This person gets it
---
That's the point of the perk
---
Yeah exactly. The grind was fine like 3-4 dlc ago but now its just insane. They are growing the game but not lowing grind to compensate
---
Like using the all popular "it's only 60 matches to get enough shards" argument. It's on average around 10 minutes a match. That's a lotta hours that need to be played for a single dlc character (not a dlc pack, shards only buy a half, ie if you buy demigorgan you dont get steve or nacy along with it)
---
And then there is the shrine which is garbage but if there is something good you need to spend your shards that you just finished grinding for
---
And then there is the forced prestiging which doesnt even give you a bonus. It's just to slow down shard gain progression
---
I agree majority of survivors do not hit every skillcheck
---
"Sticks and stones may break your bones but wipes and chains excite you"?
---
The game isn't rewarding to killers, period.  You'll have assholes teabagging, gen rushing, flashlight clicking, telling you to kill yourself, every game.  
---
If you have the fortitude to slog through, I would suggest getting your paws on Ruin (Hag teachable) asap, alternately (and arguably better for lack of RNG) Corrupt Intervention (Plague). "Gen rush isn't real"....bullshit.  Game slowdown by any means = more bloodpoints as you have time to get things done to earn them.  
---
Beyond that it's just slog slog slog until you gradually start picking up the tricks and getting better
---
I'm in central US and would love 15 min queues, btw.  Try throughout the week, I've heard it fluctuates and you might have better luck on different days.
---
Its not impossible, but unlikely.
---
Huntress, Hag and Demogorgon are pretty solid choices, and Trapper or Ghostface can definitely give even red ranks teams a run for their money if played optimally. There are definitely a lot of underperforming killers, but don't try to make it look like there are no viable ones besides the 4 you mentioned.
---
I guess The Spirit is going to switch to survivors (probably taking place of Adam) and the father is going to be the new Spirit (with the nerf/rework/whatever) plus a new Estate map
---
Instead of making memes about it, I encourage you to write to the devs and express your opinion.
---
We can get change if we all ask them nicely. Over and over.
---
It like sayin with lithe I want fast valt but not use my perk
---
No, thats the downside of the perk, you can't use drop areas unless you want to exhaust yourself, otherwise it would be fucking busted. imagine having the passive effect all the time during the loop and then when the killer finally catches up to hit on the drop, you just speed away and reset lmao.
---
Ask the people that hold the rights for Leatherface. BHVR would love to make skins for every single killer and survivor but only the people that own the rights to those said characters can say yes or no.
---
You just have to be on the gen when it pops.  Run prove thyself, better together, dark sense, and your favorite exhaustion perk, take a good tool box and just stay on gens
---
You kissed the part where a rank 1 survive was going to drop the pallet lol
---
Hag gets gradually weaker with good survivors.  Untill rank 10 aproxamitly she can compete quite well,  but at high ranks survivors just wait untill you are in a chase and then trigger every trap they can find, which makes her pretty damn weak. Also counterplay and actual map awarness also increase with rank, which are 2 things hag simply cant counter.
---
If your teammates are making unsafe unhooks right in front of the killer it makes little strategic sense to not go after you. You‚Äôre already injured.
---
Yeah totally, unless for Lore related stuff they remove Adam (and be replaced with Spirit survivor)
---
TBH if they play this right it could be a great addition to the game, instead of getting a whole new loreset to develop in the future instead we pull from the current pool and expand it killing two birds one stone.
---
No /s

You're right, it is the least efficient but that doesn't mean it's useless or the worst perk. When playing solo you can't always rely on your teammates and sometimes you want to bring a tool box instead of a fucking medkit. So it's not useless and it's not the worst perk plain and simple.
---
Imagine getting hit by a fully charged corrupted purge downed if all shots hit.
---
Pointalism, huh? Good job!
---
He already has blackface what more do you want?!? /s...
---
Seriously though, if we can get grandma Laurie then we should be able to have more licensed cosmetics.
---
*DCs after seeing to players get hook at the same time*
---
Out of the corner of your eye you spot him
---
shia labeouf
---
It would be cool if the killer could hear it too. Even as a joke I would love to have this in a custom game.
---
It‚Äôs not the spirit... it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúSoul‚Äù!
---
I have fun with the cannibal.....
---
If you ignore the first half of the meme, yeah, that's the point. Why do you think the first half is there?
---
Imagine caring about pips in 2019
---
&gt;Kayako and Samara
---
And our girl Rin
---
What happens if they release the mom too what would she be
---
Ahh, a legion main. Stay gold, ponyboy.
---
I mean, 32 seconds for 1 rather than 16 for 2, exept for other way perks, its the fastest way around if you dont happen to have a medkit.
---
Pretty Woman is the go to choice, but I'd at least want the rest of the non licensed survivors as faces
---
Makes sense
---
i doubt its her dad. it'd probably the first yamaoka and the survivor is her dad
---
Yes, that's why I'm using then for enduring. I try to always have at least 2000 saved up for that.
---
I do partly agree, especially with nerfs to SWF. Perhaps matchmaking can be tweaked so players can't get around it by queuing up at the same time (make it so same group cannot be in same lobby multiple times in a row?). Thing is, even non SWFs in red ranks can still be incredibly strong. I guess the randomness of matchmaking and there being quite a few boosted red rank survivors kinda hide it, but any 4 optimal survivors will make mincemeat out of most killers. SWF with comms is simply beating a dead horse. There definitely needs to be another way of slowing Survivor gameplay (of course in conjunction with Spirit nerf and maybe small nerfs to Billy/etc).
---
  
---
The only concern is that red rank balance isn't quite representative of lower ranks. With even most purple ranks being unable to hit ruin skill checks and having to waste time looking for it, this might skew lower rank balance pretty badly.
---
The heart?
---
I‚Äôm fine with them releasing new killers. It keeps the game exciting and fresh. They definitely need to touch up killers more often in mid chapter patches though. It takes them way too long to adjust the game and it makes the meta stale. They don‚Äôt need to constantly adjust it like league of legends, but they shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to make a large degree of changes to killers or survivor perks
---
&gt;Or use Bond and let teammates heal you...or use Adrenaline and screw healing...and so on.
---
Bond and getting to someone is still slower, since Self care literally takes twice the time for half the manpower.
---
Have you seen Kate in her leather pants? Gah damn, thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
---
yes. then once you reach epilogue you unlock the second tome
---
Then I am fucked. Lol

True.. though we don't really know much about Rin's mother. It was just strange to me to see a mask representing a female demon to be worn by her father.
---
Wow the downvote is real. Chill guys, it was legit a joke
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
The new feng buff looks op af
---
How does the killer open the gate on PC?
---
Same speed, literally takes 1 person instead of 2 and doubles the time. Even Ignoring the get to someome time its exactly the same speed as getting healed for all the killer cares.
---
I never said it was the worst perk. I've never heard anyone say that actually. There are just much better perks to run. It's not worth the perk slot to me and many others. Why so hostile?
---
What I think they're saying is she's balanced, but she isn't interactive enough on the survivors end to face. Meaning its un-fun for survivors.
---
in the lore of the yamaoka estate it said it was a man, so no
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dw4u3i/game_breaking_dc_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It was specifically stated in the lore that the Entity saw more potential in Rin's anger than her Father's despair.
---
Her pappy was driven to kill, but didn't have the "gift" that the Entity was looking for--the WANT to kill that would make him loyal beyond killing the one's he immediately blamed for his hardship. Now it's revealed Yamaoka *got* her rage from her distant ancestor, who was a mass murderer.
---
Rin's father would make sense as a Survivor and the first Yamaoka as a killer because it adds multiple dimensions to the Hope which can be harvested by the Entity:
---
It would put him within Rin's reach, which would renew and reinvigorate her urge to kill. At this point she *must* realize that her Father is a world away from her and she will never get her revenge, and that's going to make her burn out way too fast. Bringing him in spares the Entity the effort of having to replace Rin, since she will charge right into every trial hoping to catch him from now on.
---
Rin's late ancestor was already a killer, which is preferred, and because Rin's pappy shattered the bloodline and destroyed any possibility of continuing the lineage, he's sure to be furious. It's completely within the Entity's power to retroactively go back in time to grab him post-mortem, so he has the chance to reclaim the honor of his bloodline by killing the one who tainted it.
---
And finally Rin's pappy is going to realize how horribly he fucked up, and spend eternity clinging to the hope he can escape his family and repent for his actions. He didn't have the nerve to become a killer full time, but his presence serves as a catalyst to stoke the anger of not one but TWO killers, whom have a personal vendetta against him.
---
It's a pretty solid plan.
---
It's because Myers is more experienced and know that Power Walking is a far more efficient and sustainable metod of hurrying.
---
Popular streamer who is by all means the least toxic DBD streamer to exist.
---
Exactly, there's not enough lore rewards for it to stay as it is, so they're probably not actually going to be master challenges when it's released.
---
Or the paranormal
---
I was confused with the teaser. It seems like d√©j√† vu. I just think it would be a waste of Adam to just replace him.  Might as well add another survivor to this convoluted realm. I honestly don‚Äôt think there will EVER be a Dead by Daylight 2 with the rate things are going with all the adding of more content without having a completely stable core. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really enjoy this game and hope for a better future.
---
Post phase is now her being a spooky beyblade of death, M1's anyone within a 8 meter range of her.
---
What makes you think the new killer is going to be like spirit?
---
I think the specification of transfem is significant here. Particularly with you not being downvoted.
---
I wouldn't call the cast incredibly diverse, but it's better than most, particularly wrt non-stereotypical black characters.
---
If the mod team doesn't act on transphobia, things like this are liable to get downvoted, and the subreddit's going to have a sizable undercurrent of transphobia, particularly transmisogyny.
---
The point was that the Entity lied to her and gives her the promise of being able to have revenge but then never follows through, keeps the hope dangling in front of her face while getting her to kill survivors, I feel like it ruins it if the Entity actually lets her do it
---
Eww no way
---
Exactly what I said just look up dbd nsfw and you‚Äôll find it.
---
Literally everything up until point 4 is fair game.
---
If you got unhooked when i just left, close enough that i can make it there, you just got farmed homie blame the teammate not me. When the unhook happens if i can swing for the injure on the unhooker i do it, then down if possible but most of the time your the only one left.
---
Why would i accept the bodyblock? If their bodyblocking it means you clearly don't have BT so its free real estate. All i have to do is slug you for 60 seconds, and even if you get picked up, thats 15 seconds minimum that i took 3+ survivors out of the game.
---
If i just happened to find you because you got found first, thats your fault for wandering from the safe zone of the jungle gym/pallet loop you got hooked at/nearby. If i see both of you, ill try to choose the unhooker, but if your the only one im not gonna let you leave and search a jungle gym for a chance to find a healthy survivor.
---
I have like 60 on derpface and use them every now and then just to flex
---
Good ol Ash, I love the evil dead and Ashs personality plus Bruce Campbell actually voices him so that's also a bonus on why I like him
---
If I'm not mistaken its dbdgonewild.
---
Technically they outplayed you if your the one dying my guy.
---
If you outplayed them, you would of escaped.
---
I did this on my first try it was easy imo o-o
---
A kill is a kill
---
I didn't die lmfao. wasn't even playing. this was in an ohm video.
---
Why tho? That's just harming the whole community.
---
Black metal Jeff for obvious reasons.
---
Well, then it sucks that it doesn't trump stealth abilities. 
---
Besides, have you checked only wraith or every undetectable killer? There is a low possibility that still some of them can be detected via kindred, but I'm not sure now
---
Wtf bhvr, why did they nerf clown's thiccness :(
---
It *can* rewind time, but that's not the extent of its abilities, as it can override other phenomena such as death itself. The reason it rewound time when it was first revealed was because it was undoing the effect of King Crimson.
---
King Crimson jumped forward in time ten seconds and observed the trajectory of events from point a to b, so GER sent him backwards in time and sent those events back to the origin point. Sort of like adding a negative number to a positive number, and getting 0.
---
wouldn't know, I main survivor and if I ever played killer, I wouldn't camp like a pussy
---
I‚Äôve never gotten the point of calling someone a tryhard.... lol.
---
She really isn't. Her base kit is balanced, they just need to tweak the way certain things work. There needs to be a visual queue of where she is and she shouldn't be able to collide with you while she's phasing. She also needs a window vault animation. They do need to work on her high level add ons. They're pretty OP. Meanwhile we got Billy out here yeeting across the map in 2 seconds and one shoting people LUL
---
Exploding pebble technique!
---
Do you mean leave via the exit gate or do you mean dc? Because exit gate you absolutely should keep the item as that is a mechanic.
---
"DoN't TuNnEl"
---
i think they made this because the new killer is related to spirit
---
And the difference between a challenge and an achievement is.....?
---
NOT the P word!
---
I get why they made it, but I see no reason to assume the killers will have anything in common gameplay-wise.
---
I main Ace for the smug dad quality.
---
Maybe but even looking up dbd nsfw should get you to the page.
---
sorry to tell you bud but i doubt the new killer is her dad
---
(SPOILERS) Personally i dont think its gonna be rins father or mother. Due to the fact that the leaked sound files are labeled ‚Äútomb‚Äù and the leaked map file being a shrine i think its gonna be some type of separate (maybe ancestral) demon thats came from said tomb/shrine maybe its even the voice that drove rins dad crazy.
---
Yeah, I guess you could take that completely at face value, if you don't know how to read anything beyond the text
---
Oh I would KILL for haunting grounds. I was upset when temple of purgation wasn‚Äôt a giant temple, I wanted to run around something like a castle.
---
I would love a Og clocktower Jennifer but Idk if I‚Äôd want scissorman as a killer just cause he‚Äôs so small, so maxwell is perfect.  Although anyone from haunting grounds would work so well
---
Which we were already told are mostly placeholders
---
so 3 gens done in 80 seconds cause I got fucking ormond means I am shit at the game?
---
okay sure man.
---
Honestly. I especially love the irony of the "It's a game" statement
---
Thank you. I'm gonna go in my room for a bit now and listen to Christian music with my door locked....
---
Is that a pro genji?
---
But we already have an actual cannibal :(
---
This sounds fun as fuck though.
---
It's from a "Draw your squad/OCs" template. There are like hundreds of them.
---
Luck is solely used for the purpose of attempting escape on the hook, nothing else.
---
You can do it twice on the same survivor. Just did it on a teabagging Claudette.
---
The point would be to be based on skill and not luck
---
I've uploaded a video of the event leading to this message for anyone curious
---
Who was the killer and what perks were they using? 
---
How does the killer not kill anyone but was able to kill everyone after the hens were done? Without a endgame build of course.
---
No disconnects in the match and don‚Äôt let a survivor drop a pallet at all
---
I'm sorry... God
---
Poorly worded (as is the case here; you just have to be on the gen as it gets completed IIRC), can only do one challenge at a time, many challenges that are needlessly grindy (yeah 13 is a cute number of sacrifices and all but did you maybe think that making me do one extra game for one more survivor to sacrifice is retarded) or niche (even getting the chance to unhook someone who unhooked me isn't a challenge, it's just luck). Really disappointing mechanic as a whole. Hope it's better next time even though I know it won't be given BHVR's track record.
---
And there you have it. You have no clue what the other half of this game is like to play. You play the easy power roll where all you have to do is sit and hold m1 most of the game.
---
I think it‚Äôs not that big of a jump, they aren‚Äôt meant to be completed immediately either, technically if you spend more time on one you‚Äôll get more xp meaning more fragments.
---
idk, might have been a legion
---
If you‚Äôre camped on first hook it‚Äôs not really about being ‚Äúoutplayed.‚Äù
---
Quite anecdotal don‚Äôt you think
---
Hahahah
---
crazy
---
I suppose lol
---
Jake, because of his halloween skin, and the homeless jake skin from the rift
---
I think having Rin as the survivor is much more interesting.
---
You got downed, therefore you didn't outplay them. Just don't get downed (4head)
---
*Sheds one manly tear* Respect.
---
Anyone who says it's the worst perk is heavily exaggerating or trolling. It's a mid teir perk. Its works fine but there are much better perks. Also I havent seen 1 post about self care tbh and I'm on here a decent amount lol. All I see is "nerf spirit"
---
Ruining the fun for some one isn‚Äôt even a valid argument. It‚Äôs a pvp game I play killer with the full intent on making it the least enjoyable for the survivors and the survivors play with the intent on making it the least fun for the killer. If a survivor can use the argument of its not fun for me if you camp then a killer can use the argument of its not fun for me if you have some one un hooks you before I get another down. If I feel it‚Äôs necessary for me to secure a kill on a single survivor in exchange for letting others live that‚Äôs my choice.
---
If you want to write fic, you should do so. Worse-case scenario, you'll learn more about writing and develop your craft.
---
I might suggest looking at something other than a "crazed gunman", but that's just me. If you ever develop a mental illness and read a lot of horror, let alone study the statistics on sane people vs crazy people committing random violence, you'll know what I mean.
---
Well what else am I going to do once the gens are done? I can leave and let the guy get rescued, or camp and secure the one kill.
---
My first game with her was also very good, but I was rank 20 at the time, she became impossible to play when i reached rank 16-15
---
I have a complete end game Freddy build where I want 2-3 survivors at the end. 
---
But
---
I also have a Bubba who can‚Äôt win unless 2 survivors are sacrificed. Even then one will most likely escape. So I camp when gens are done. Survivors just need to escape and they won‚Äôt die when all gens are done.
---
So you're suppo6to play a PVP game and not give it your best ?? You're supposed to play like an idiot and purposely lose ? .... hes so mad bruh haha
---
But you definitely can get more, 3 gens left on the map means you can patrol easier. What‚Äôs the point of ruining the fun for someone by ‚Äúensuring a kill‚Äù just because you didn‚Äôt well.
---
you could, but I've had multiple killers clutch this without end game builds
---
Gawdette
---
It's supposed to be a joke based on their new (assumed) killer reveal. In the reveal they said the name "Yamaoka" which is Spirit's name (Rin Yamaoka iirc) so everyone's making jokes about BHVR trolling everyone that's been asking for Spirit nerfs.
---
Imo Spirit shouldn't be nerfed though, she's pretty much the only really good killer on PS4. Instead, the other killers should be buffed slightly to make them more on par.
---
And Nurse's halloween outfit doesn't show the cracks on her left arm when she's about to blink. This makes me feel like they don't even test the outfits
---
Rn I'm in r13 i kept getting trashed so I stopped playing today was the first time I played her in a while and I actually got someone to ragequit and double pip
---
It is minimal-effort, and yet it's not always done, that's why it's good to let companies know that we appreciate it anyway.
---
Anyone but Quentin. I don't want to look at that ugly mug in my games ick
---
Exp is calculated purely on time. 1exp per second up to 10 minutes (600exp). So afk'ing, especially as killer, is an ok way to rack up points, albeit incredibly scummy and probably bannable.

While hooking the last survivor that gen is gonna pop. 
---
And you‚Äôre relying on a three gen which doesn‚Äôt happen often
---
Ah so the entity saved him from a near death experience kinda like tap
---
Ikr lmao
---
One time a Quentin jumped in a locker and had ds. I just stared at the locker. After a min, he got out real slow and crouch-stared at me. Adorable son of a bitch played me, I let him go.
---
this happened to me too with head on and ghostface, by its only ghostface, it's really weird, [look](https://youtu.be/zDsG4IMjDbo)
---
*I think we did a...*
---
Not being the dude that the killer sees first.
---
Cha Cha Real Smooth
---
would you ssy these are fair changes?
---
Yeah, but at this point I think Adam would've rather died at the train crash
---
Urban Evasion flair checks out. 
---
You can hop in a locker when the killer picks someone up, or move in one direction for 5 seconds post-hook, then move back to mislead the killer, or get closer to the hook. It has plenty of counterplay, and something like Ruin, PGTW, Discordance, etc, could go in that slot.
---
I‚Äôll take it into account! I thought crazed gunman was a bit to vague as well so maybe I‚Äôll try to make it a bit more personal to the characters like it‚Äôs a friend whose snapped for no reason at all or who recently started showing signs of insanity or depression(kinda like Rin‚Äôs dad)
---
I mean.. why are people assuming he could be similar to spirit? Original killers are never similar to other original killers
---
Camping is only a legit play style in low ranks where survivors don‚Äôt know how to do gens quickly or they try to unhook in front of the killer. There‚Äôs a reason survivors have 3 hooks, it‚Äôs hard to not have anybody go down at least once unless the killer is absolute trash. Killers also lose BP for camping, so BHVR discourages it.
---
I'll probably just do the Bullshit ones by messaging the survivors so we make a deal and fatm
---
David and Jake.
---
Ace and Bill aka Lucky Strike and Marlboro Red.
---
I quit smoking cigarettes and live victoriously through my (trademark pending) Nicotine Boyz
---
Its a family member therefore same killer or some shit logic like that
---
Which TV looks better
---
F
---
I think all the survivors would rather die tbh...permanently
---
True, but Bond is also useful for more information, not just self-heal.
---
How viable is the American terror radius?
---
when spirit was released in the ptb it said "you start with his first 3 perks" or something but they fixed it in the live launch
---
Most likely he committed seppuku, that's why the blood in the teaser is around the mask and not where he killed Rin.
---
Mine the one on the right
---
I'm just glad they confirmed they are doing changes to her.
---
I don't like how we have to Yamaokas, I'd prefer new lore
---
You only have to finish the gen not complete 3 full gens. You juat need the perk to activate 3 times in one match. I did it with Bond and Prove thyself staying away from killer and not trying to do a whole gen by yourself
---
Imagine if after all this speculation that it's gonna be a new killer or survivor and the devs just end up changing spirit like they said they would by removing Rin and just making it the ancestor instead with the same powers and add-ons to troll people
---
*pebble would like to know your location*
---
i wish there was a version with his mask he wore in the caves
---
That's not fact that's just speculation. Until confirmation, you *think* it's the first Yamaoka. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
yea... just dont?
---
Yep, but at least we have the killers.
---
well according to the picture you seem to have completed it, so do share your secrets
---
It's enough to make a grown man cry, and that's okay.
---
It could be the entity, but im personally not so sure, the entity hasnt really driven people to a point where it can snatch them i think, i think it came along and sensed an opportunity, i suspect this was two separate entities working here. The whispers in rins fathers mind just didnt sound like the entity, but i havent really done my homework so its just speculation.
---
This is so good lmfao
---
I‚Äôve was running Feng and then Claudette until I got one of the outfits for Dwight and I‚Äôve mostly been using him
---
I agree.  Why make a completely new chapter with the same killer when they can just give her a skin?
---
&gt; a metal club with studs or spikes being their weapon of choice
---
This makes me think that maybe we'll have a pallet break animation that's one large hit instead of 2 small hits, and now I really want this.
---
If there's only one survivor left the killer can force EGC by closing the hatch or opening an exit gate. I know its space bar to close the hatch probably the same.
---
The Real spirit nerf you all wanted. She's a survivor now and her dad is here to Fuck. Shit. Up.
---
Ghostface, that is all.
---
Funny enough, it works with anything that heals you so long as you have Self Care on.
---
Plague Fountains, Inner Strength, Second Wind, Health Kits... Doesn't matter how you heal, so long as you heal without another survivor healing you and have Self Care as a perk.
---
Hybridpanda and Monto aren't even that good at DBD either. Morf is better than HybridPanda.
---
Damn a living armor type killer would be cool.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that she OP it‚Äôs that this particular aspect of her character is OP.‚Äù
---
There's like 17 of us!
---
I think it could still be an ancestor, they never said it was a man anyways
---
TBH I could understand it if he had a casual mode or something where people just goof off...but DBD only has one mode, and it¬¥s ranked...
---
He looking thicky thick. 
---
All jokes aside, it looks great in game!
---
This guy has zero friends in life, I guarantee it
---
Maybe the survivor will be Rin's mother, or her mother will be the other vengeful spirit/killer.
---
Just keep playing! She gets much easier with practice. It‚Äôs mostly timing and tracking survivors. I recommend playing without addons.
---
I‚Äôm real glad I did this challenge on my first attempt and didn‚Äôt have to use Self Care twice lmao
---
5"11 ain't tall.
---
Also when I say toxic I don't just mean players that are good and are "tryhards" it's people purposely teabagging and running infinites to be toxic and pointing and shit
---
Unpopular opinion: Spirit is fun and scary and shouldn't be nerfed
---
Maybe the oni has possessed the fathers body. Unless oni‚Äôs don‚Äôt do that
---
*zips belt back up*
---
whoever it was, was in with 1-10 ranks
---
I'm surprised they don't have a system for detecting afking for rift progress.
---
This sounds like a neck beard.
---
What about the Nea cosmetic with skateboard, she could use that as a weapon lol.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they just reused the Stranger Things Teaser as the intro for it.
---
Ds, strong perk? Did you post this meme with internet explorer?
---
You're right, I forgot about it. Still, sacrificing 7 survivors in one match could be quite hard to do.
---
Yeah that would be dope.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not her dad... the entity chose Rin over him and the mask in the teaser belongs to the first Yamaoka
---
What I like about the spirit is she is quite accurate to what it might be like having to contend with a crazy katana ghost irl or in a horror movie.
---
That's far too cool to actually be what we're getting.
---
To put what I'm trying to say bluntly... 
---
To use crazy people as an easy 'in' for the violence your story needs is very common in horror. It's also inaccurate.
---
Your typical "crazed gunman" like Anders Breivik or Dylan Klebold has written an entire manifesto outlining why he did it. It's an outlining of political idealogy with zero evidence of mental illness. Likewise, the vast majority of serial killers are not driven by delusions, hallucinations, etc; look at Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer, the biggest names. The only mad serial killer I can point you to is the Sacramento Vampire! And I know a few.
---
A great many mentally ill people have our lives ruled by sane people's revulsion and fear as much as our symptoms. I feel it's important that horror chooses not to salt that wound or oil that fire. 
---
I've been friends with diagnosed narcissists, schizoid PD misanthropes, and people who think bugs are crawling on them. After severe trauma I spent several years with my empathy snuffed out like a candle flame and my delusional brain gnashing and yammering at me to eat people and that violence is the ultimate beauty. None of us ever hurt anyone. Not one of us were violent.
---
If you want violence from our histories, you've got sane abusive brothers, abusive fathers, doctors, nurses, passerby, sane people all. 
---
So if you were to choose to use madness this way... 
---
Well. You can, and it's easy, but I would encourage you to sidestep that.
---
I'd be happy to throw out some possibilities or give information on real-life violence, if you want.
---
are you kidding me? every other surv match in purple or above ranks makes me feel completely outmatched, i feel helpless all the time playing survivor. and everybody who plays DBD will play against a toxic killer/SWF, old or new.
---
i actually don't like the corrupted vommit so i rarely use the fountains.. i'll usually leave them up and use one so they don't reset
---
I don't think they're too bad. Get 20 gold or above? Pretty easy tbh. 
---
Trap 4 survivors in one game? Not too bad. 
---
Deplete 6 medkits? Just equip an instaheal if you don't care about them. 
---
Of course some tweaks could be made but all in all I'll probably be able to get them done today.

I have the opposite issue where I'm a red rank killer playing against survivors that don't know what a pallet is. Even mosy of the "toxic flashlight swf" teams that "genrush" aren't particularly that challenging as most swf that do that on rank rest are purple ranks. Lol
---
Don't let anyone tell you rank does not matter, there is quite a noticeable difference between red and purple ranks, and purple and green ranks.
---
But yeah, as others are saying, the game should return to normal in a few days.
---
It's related to emblems. You need three iridescent and one high gold or a 4th iridescent to get it.
---
They could just say it‚Äôs a light plastic prop.
---
??
---
What?
---
I keep getting brainless teammates and godlike killers, I can't wait until everything evens out again
---
Looking really neat. Well done!
---
C H O N K face 
---
(I really like thicc ghostface in my opinion)
---
I've been rank 5-8 survivor for ages and yeah I can feel like helpless but it's straight up im screwed, whereas as killer there's always hope that keeps getting crushed
---
Exactly, why would you want a shitty perk like DS when you have Stake Out already
---
it's tagged speculation
---
Surely they could just say it‚Äôs a light weight plastic prop.
---
Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero
---
Depends on what rank are you playing
---
Thank you!
---
Isn't Legion like that too? I might be wrong about this one.
---
Good to know ty
---
i guess you have never been teabagged by a ghostface during the whole 2 minute collapse, because your team either died or left you behind
---
Or his pants...
---
Honestly i agree. I wanted to play wraith cuz he is a fun killer but i stopt because of toxic survivors with flashlights. I duno if its just a survivor thing but lightstunning the wraith is just a dick move. And now im playing hag. At great effici√´nsy
---
Nothing is easy pickings at red ranks
---
Very much so, even people just throwing pallets can eat 80 seconds. Knowing when to break off is possibly the single most important killer skill imo
---
Nea said ‚Äúnah bitch wrong locker‚Äù
---
Can't say I've been in that exact scenario were you on hook?
---
I was reading up on the legend of the Oni and it‚Äôs describe as a large orgre creature 
---
Edit correct if I‚Äôm wrong
---
I was joking about that. Nea could also just take her skateboard and beat the crap out of em. Guess maybe they forgot...? Maybe they didnt want any big skins as it would make your more visible? also the yellow gloves destroy that theory...
---
it's something to do with the spirit
---
nah dude the feeling is the same regardless of which team, getting stomped is still getting stomped
---
Perhaps I treated Claudettes to harshly.
---
EZ just learn how to land greats, derank to rank 17, use an offering for a map with hard totem spawns (like the new lab) and watch 3 morrons trying to find the ruin when you complete one gen after another
---
slugged
---
I don't think that last one is going to change when you go during class. üòπ
---
I don't think anyone really thinks they'll be almost the same. Just an easy thing to meme about.
---
Wow that great here take my upvote
---
Careful he's a hero
---
Everyone ? Lol. You should put there survivors instead of everyone.
---
Rin's dad was easy to camp because of his horrible life situation. We're not sure that it was the entity either, it could've been something possessing the mask or even him already being mad.
---
Well yeah I'm not saying killers aren't toxic I just meant that spirit players are usually "forced" to play spirit cause it's the only real counter to toxic survivors
---
Nah you're all wrong it's Doomguy
---
Absolutely, we went insane after literally losing all hope, no way he‚Äôs a survivor
---
No tunnel = no ds, stop pretending killers aren't assholes aswell.
---
Not sure why you're downvoted, you're right. he's much better, but he's a little less fun. Old Freddy always felt either worthless or like a god. His downsides were massive, but when you were having a good game the info made him a beast. I genuinely loved playing old Freddy, now I barely touch him. I won't complain about the rework, it was needed, but I kinda wish we could choose to play as either version
---
CoD Ghost it‚Äôs back!
---
not really, its just that prayer beads spirit is the most OP addon
---
Totally agree with you we dont want to play with clown tier killers we just want to now when she is using her power
---
My xbox handles it just fine
---
Yeah, you're probably right
---
The true story of Tapp
---
I did 3 gens and did not get hooked at all. After two of the other survivors were mori‚Äôd, me and a Steve crank out the last gen. We get it done, I go to the gate nearest and proceed to open (hoping to take aggro, really). I hadn‚Äôt been hooked, so I could take the killer for a spin, and even if I get hooked, deliverance, dead hard and dstrike can save me. Anyways, I of course get into a chase, get instadowned by ghostface (he followed me and stalked me to full), only to see that the Steve that didn‚Äôt do shit the whole game had already left.
---
ah. well I suppose you see it like I do then
---
what makes you say that?
---
Thanks for correcting me. My auto correct was on
---
They are the only form of actual progress for the battlepass. Xp grinding takes 8000 XP for a single battlepass level, and the Tome exists to alleviate the grind.  These aren't "end-game" challenges, these are battlepass challenges.
---
Both shows sucked
---
Well everyone has their own way :) but when killers can use noed why is ds a problem then?
---
Your link was just you getting a head on stun after inner strength'ing, not sure what that had to do with my post but nice video üòÖ
---
&gt; There's this ghost girl who has a smile carved into her face. She approaches you, and asks you if you think she's pretty. If you say "no", she strangles you to death. If you say yes, she carves up your face, so you look like her. The only response that saves you is "You look normal."
---
fun fact, this is what we thought spirit was gonna be
---
For the most part, yeah
---
Yeah, idk why we‚Äôre talking about this. 
---
Killer can camp if they want to
---
Yeah I hate auto correct, but between you and me I like THOUGH!
---
Yeah toxic, when killers are the ones face-camping and tunneling for these damn event challenges.
---
If i haven't ran it in a while i will bring in a brand new part hitting those checks are alittle smaller than ds helps prep me for later
---
There are ways around flashlights and "genrushing" is literally just survivors doing the objective. You may have a more difficult time because you're playing a m1 killer (Especially a killer that is usually on the bottom of most people's tier list) but still even then, there is a noticeable difference between red ranks and purple ranks.
---
I play a lot of Billy and I don't mind garnishing. I don't even bring ruin on my billy.
---
Yikes
---
I just nut when I see the points pop up.
---
I was a survivor this game. This is a survivor + survivor convo, killers being toxic is a whole different topic
---
Then the team is being far too altruistic if they are losing with 4 people and the gates powered. Securing the hooked survivor is the smart decision for the killer. Just because the survivor isn't happy they couldn't be saved doesnt mean it was a bad play by the killer.
---
I like how you ask rank as if it validates anything.
---
I‚Äôm wondering what his rank is because red ranks usually know what they‚Äôre doing. When you solo queue, you can see the stark difference between red and purple ranks.
---
Jake forever!!
---
I haven't seen tome 4; was the 3-ECG challenge in a bottleneck placement? Or is it possible to reach the end of the tome without it?
---
Haha ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
OK that's epic!!! üòÇüëåü§£ü§£
---
I got 2 iridescent in that game and 3 gold
---
Ps4. The two that made me go eat dinner cause I got salty were : One had a Feng in her tracksuit. ‚ÄúKingOfDbd‚Äù or something. She wasn‚Äôt the problem it was a laggy claudette in her group. I just remembered the name cause I was like ‚Äúoh shit. Sweat time.‚Äù That was on the wrecking yard, I think. Another was a group with an Adam Francis who started off with a map and the got a flashlight. That was the map with the zombie horse. And there was another group on wrecking yard with a Steve that was lord of the flashlight. My name is frashu and I run a trapper with the bone mask from the rift and no other cosmetics.
---
well yeah, and it used to take a lot less time to get holiday items too. I don‚Äôt want to waste all of my holiday trying to get some stupid glowy item that would be free or a lot easier to get in another game...
---
I felt this way too. I feel like the game is abit more sluggish. Maybe they lowered the speed abit and haven't said anything.
---
Yeah fun game as cannibal do u mean insidious ruin noed and bbq?
---
You will also see a lot or action after rank reset nobody really sitting up at rank 16 to 20, so normally after the first week of reset most ppl are in the green ranks
---
You messaged them first tho

As a pig killer main to a survivor! You went out a hero fer that your friend has earned a victory! Well played
---
A little late, but yes! I was just working on a gen that was about to be completed and it gave me the point for it.
---
It‚Äôs based on your medals at the end and it gets harder the higher your rank. Rank 13-20 requires at least 2 Gold, 2 Iridescent. Rank 5-12 requires 1 Gold, 3 Iridescent. And rank 1-4 requires all 4 Iridescent.
---
That sounds good. 
---
Cause I dont understand the negative effect of allowing them to see you too. I dont think the perk is strong enough to have a drawback
---
Wow you‚Äôre late, and how is this the best billy map ?
---
No you got downed. You want a second chance equip a perk
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o36-byW6ZTo DBD is 20 seconds in.
---
Aren't there addons for extra chainsaw reach?
---
For killer it depends on what killer you have, as some are slightly slower than others (like hag or huntress I think) 
---
Some survivor can also feel slower than other survivours based on their model although they are not actually
---
You can, but the only other route is get 3 EGC kills with NOED in a single match. Either path is still bullshit how much you have to go through. Other awful challenges are: Complete 4 gens with Dark Sense, Hook 5 Survivors in basement with Agitation, and Sacrifice 4 Survivors in the basement. All of these must be done in ONE match. I think it's blatantly clear that no one who helped plan for this actually plays the game.
---
Ah yes, cuz killers definitely get points for slugging and get closer to killing survivors :3
---
Yeah the problem is once she's got her superpuke there's almost no counterplay to her. You'd probably love longer injured vs normal puke than full-health vs superpuke
---
Oh no! The survivors broke one of my 4 hooks within 20 feet of eachother, what is a killer to do?
---
No mither my dude
---
Well, presuming you play the game, let me ask- what would YOU select as some top-tier challenges for this game?
---
Not to mention theres clearly lag. The character was exactly where ghostface swung at like half a second after she moved away. "Hitboxes". Sure. Keep telling your selves that hitboxes are the size of cars.
---
Yeah, I have figured out how to look around amd dodge the flashlight. Just not in my ‚Äúpick up‚Äù animation. Like I am just stuck. 
---
And yeah I have played against plenty of purple ranks. (Why? I dunno. I was rank 12 playing against 5‚Äôs and 6‚Äôs). There is a strong difference between those ranks and the ones I am playing today. Main difference to me? Todays survivors have no idle time. There are on gen 24/7. The purple ranks I normally play against, which are still challenging for me play ‚Äúhero‚Äù way more. Gens get done slower because they will lurk and wait to support, off-hook, and heal a survivor. Todays ranks will use most of the first hook timer to finish a gen instead of going for the insta-save. And I have noticed kinda the same behavior when I made it to red ranks as a survivor. 
---
What do you mean by garnishing?
---
Being better is not going to help when:
---
The game doesn't load
---
The game crashes mid session
---
Squad DCs when they find out what killer is playing
---
Squad DCs on first hit
---
Squad DCs on first hook
---
Squad suicides on first hook
---
Killer is camping
---
Killer doesn't get a chance to hook
---
Everyone but you is part of a swf
---
At some point I feel the challenges aren't going to be able to be done unless I swf up, which takes most of the fun out of it for me.
---
with the minor balancing, spirit is way easier to vs
---
Hag is slower than most killers but that's fine as you don't chase as hag. You place traps and only chase survivors if you think you will be able to down them before they get to a pallet. If you play hag like most killers then you have a bad time, that is also the reason most people say she sucks because they play her like every other killer and that just doesn't work.
---
Billy imo, is the most rewarding killer to play, once you get good with Billy there is rarely a point in a game where you flat out lose, as Billy has a very high snowball potential. With Billy, it is all about constantly using the chainsaw. Something I still do on occasion that is good for getting better at Billy, is just to never m1 a survivor, always use your chainsaw. Doesn't matter if they are healthy or injured, just rev that chainsaw. After you learn the basics of Billy the best advice I can give you is to watch a guide on YouTube, OhTofu does a great one hour long advanced Billy guide.
---
You know what it is. Get tunneled in style boi!
---
Well lucky for you they made event items purchasable in the store when it's over making all of that grinding literally meaningless
---
They haven't balanced her tho
---
It's not her father
---
I don‚Äôt think they are too bad except of course ‚ÄúBlind the killer twice in a single trial‚Äù because RIP console players.
---
Exact same! I watched tru3 starting out and then never looked back once I saw Otz.
---
Tru3 is "Look at me im the best!"
---
Otz is "Look at this, this is fun"  
---
And yeah Tru3's constant negativity is a real downer and makes me like the game less the more I watch
---
The entity wouldnt do that.

"Merciless Killer" is based off the number of pips you get at the end of a match. Depip is Entity Displeased, safety/black pip is Brutal Killer, 1 pip is Ruthless Killer and 2 pip is Merciless Killer.
---
Garnishing is genrushing under the plague of autocorrect.
---
Dude, thanks for the advice. I got my trapper to 50. Maybe Billy is the next one for me. I was thinking Ghost Face or Huntress. But you make a strong case, and having a good guide will help. Coming into this community as a noob is so overwhelming. I really appreciate your help, like you have no idea.
---
i stunned him with head on, but he was far away and it was delayed, similar to what happened to you dropping the pallet
---
Try to lead the survivors to dropped pallets, windows, etc. During the jumping animation they are vulnerable. Also try to predict where the survivor is going to be during a chase, and having a good aim of course :)
---
Give it time, the rose colored glasses will fade out. You'll realize that the points are more of the same complaints themselves.  But yeah Tru3 is overall a good player and you will learn a lot from him, if you find him enjoyable then thats good. I for the love of me cant though
---
Again, they aren't top tier challenges, they are battlepass challenges with a different coat of paint.
---
Darn, too bad BHVR made these challenges mandatory
---
And if you don't complete 100% of them your account gets charged $30
---
And then the game uninstalled itself and deletes System32
---
Edit: oh wait
---
Kill all survivor
---
Counterpoint: Spirit is fun and she is scary. However she doesn‚Äôt give any feedback so other people can play against her and some kind of noticeable feedback isn‚Äôt a direct nerf to her lower. Even something as simple as actually making her shards truly light up or giving her some punishment for losing a mindgame can make the push and pull of playing against Spirit enjoyable for everyone instead of enjoyable for one person.
---
They should of said the baseball bat is plastic then.
---
Lmao. I was like ‚Äúahh crap. Another term I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù This game has it‚Äôs own language. ‚ÄúBlendette, NOED, Etc.‚Äù
---
This is a meme, not someone yelling that ds should be nerfed into hell.
---
And no one said that all killers are perfect little angels that can do no wrong.
---
That's why I counter spirit on daily basis lol
---
You just don't know how to, like crying about nurse because you wanna loop her
---
otz is most fun I think, puppers is the super relaxing no toxic for me
---
Why message randoms? Just move on.
---
I dont blame the guy for just laughing at you
---
The best teacher out there is Scorpionz (on Twitch). I'm not nearly as good as him.
---
I'm doing OK'ish - usually get to purple ranks playing like an hour a day on average. Have no interest playing in red ranks. But for a r1 achievement I played Amanda with the same build.
---
That's the last thing I look to counter her
---
I guess people really play only one side..
---
There are four tiers. Each is harder than the last. This one is the top-tier. I don't know what you think that means.
---
Just wait until you start getting death threats from 15 year olds

yeahh boi, you do good , get free adverts via "memes"

---
poor blendettes weren't confident of their stealth abilities
---
To be honest I am not so sure these are a good combo even though it makes sense. The killer being able to see your broken icon means they'll more than likely slug you until it disappears.
---
I did, yes. Good observation.
---
And for the record, I am not arguing from a ‚Äúi think I am right position‚Äù. Just some observations from the three weeks I have played. I am sure you have a more informed opinion.
---
Try to always fully charge your hatchets before throwing whenever possible, this greatly reduces travel time and arc allowing for more direct throws which (depending on the distance) get harder to nearly impossible to dodge.
---
Hook everyone twice minumum and hit everyone at least twice, break every pallet and generator, if someone dies on first hook you won't get it
---
Noted
---
Head on's hitbox includes the doors of the locker, also head on slightly lingers after exiting the locker, so there was nothing weird about that clip. It's just how head on works.
---
My friends when we're goofing off in KYF
---
The new Switch release is looking pretty good, I'd say
---
What build and idk how I watch his stuff and I get the mind games but his survivors just don't do gens and I don't get it, even if 3 aren't being pressured they just don't seem to do gens
---
Unbreakable for the ultimate trio.
---
I can move on, be this dude will continue fucking over us good survivors. And I wasn‚Äôt asking about rank to be condescending.
---
I mean it's easier than making a whole new map. With plague they kinda cheesed it already
---
To be honest this chat just shows how toxic and entitled u are .
---
Not really a counterpoint, an opinion rather. A good one, though. I mean, if they make her slightly more fair, guess it will be even more fun. Just don't push her to the ground.
---
He looks very sassy and huggable.
---
BPS is like a guaranteed fuck you anytime I use it. Constantly get the most toxic teams with it for some reason.
---
Nah mate
---
Like thinking in the spirit teaser we were getting a samurai killer..
---
It didn really go that way did it?
---
And I play with a lot of the same people often. Might as well share the knowledge with them. I message lots of people and give them good tips and tricks. I guess I‚Äôm making the change I‚Äôd like to see in the game.
---
I didnt even know that was a thing appreciated  !!
---
Agreed, I'm leaning more towards the killer being an ancestor now, the mask is either representing Rin or the ancestor, I thought about it being Rin's mother mostly because it was a female mask and it would make more sense to me if her mother was the new killer and her father a survivor rather than a killer,  it wouldn't make sense for her mother to be a survivor since she would have to go against her husband but also Rin if someone picked her as a killer in the trial
---
Heres a tip, in the video, a survivor ran up to you, and you m1 him. Dont, hit him with a hatchet, so you dont get a weapon wiping animation, then hit him with a basic attack, thats how you basicly instantly down survivors.
---
That's way more likely than the stupid idea of rin father
---
When you bring BPS, survivor spawns on Ruin, gens get done in three minutes, all four survivors wait at exit to teabag and flashlight click, "ggez, fuck you kys"
---
What's your point?
---
Where did you get a female demon from a  Daikijin¬†oni mask?
---
Honestly, you seem to be just as toxic.
---
Intro to Voodoo: how to hex a friend
---
I want to hug the C H O N K but I‚Äôm gong to get the shank if I tried
---
How is this in anyway toxic or entitled?
---
‚ÄúHey man, you should have helped your *TEAMMATE* out‚Äù
---
I fail to see the toxicity
---
Note the rank 1 requirement.
---
Cannibal's worst nightmare is people who can rush through gens due to his low map pressure, won't fall for his classic insid camping because 80%+ of high rank survivors tend to SWFs just to have some coordination, and people who know how to loop because he is one of the most loopable killers in the game, with almost no answer to any loops.
---
AKA people in rank 1 in a nutshell.
---
&gt; You see how the ‚Äúfun‚Äù argument doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
It was you who said that your goal is to make the game unenjoyable for other players.
---
&gt; Stop being entitled. Your not entitled to have fun.
---
Same as you.
---
&gt; No one cares about your fun. It‚Äôs fun to me to ruin your fun.
---
If you don't care about my fun, why are you targeting it? If you specifically play in a way to ruin someone's fun, do you really *not care* about it?
---
&gt; don‚Äôt hate the player, hate the game
---
Nope, there's nothing in the game that forces you to play in a way that ruins the fun for other players. It's you who chooses to play it that way.
---
Or use it as a way to get away from the killer faster
---
Just so you know this guy is either a troll or an idiot, never worth talking to.
---
I don't know the second kanji they used for her name but just by guess it means Â±±Èô∏ mountain's land. Again, I have no idea which kanji they used on the name, Yama is pretty simple but oka have different meanings depending on which kanji you use
---
I've played for over a year, genrushing is something you just learn to deal with, no point stressing over it as it is going to happen.
---
As for flashlights, as annoying and situationally useful as they are, are probably actually the worst item they could bring. I'd rather see a survivor bring a flashlight over a toolbox, a med-kit, or a key as a flashlight is the only thing I can actually play around.
---
With flashlights you can look at a wall, fake a pickup (trapper is actually amazing at faking a pickup as you can place a trap instead of picking up a survivor, and most survivors will run out of hiding to position themselves for a flashlight as soon as you bend over), or just look around the immediate area if the flashlight person is constantly following you around..
---
I mean, you do though.  And a slug is generating map pressure for you.  A hook, slug, and chase means only 1 survivor on the map is doing anything at all.  And if they are even remotely smart, that "anything at all" is almost without a doubt going for the unhook and healing up the slug.
---
Not all heroes wear capes... but a reverse bear trap
---
That makes one person in the comment section I guess.
---
Yep, got it done on the first try.
---
Messaging anyone but an absolute new player is a waste of time. They know how to play and are not gonna listen to a random. Especially the amount you get messaged by people. 
---
Accept it that some people are selfish
---
Feel free to explain
---
She doesn‚Äôt even really need any kit related nerfs. Just feedback the players can read off of to interact with her. Hell the only thing I‚Äôd ever change directly is Prayer Beads and make it do something more mindgame-y or more threatening. Shit I could do that right now: Prayer Beads: While in Yamoka‚Äôs Haunting, the phasing elision sound is global. Tremendously increases duration [+10 seconds] and speed [+55% bonus move speed] and  tremendously decreases speed of power recovery [+12 seconds] 
---
You know have this lightning fast fear bomb who can keep the entire map on edge cause she really could pop up anywhere she wanted to.
---
Can't wait for double killer bug with spirit and her dad chasing each other around the map
---
I nean NOED is literally just stands for No One Escapes Death. Lol
---
There's nothing better than her swinging me over her broad shoulders, sweat dripping from underneath her bunny mask, and shoving a hook through my shoulder while humming me a lullaby. You can chain me in your shack any time, bunny mom.
---
Legends never die
---
I'm gonna be so hyped if we get an Oni killer with an ancestral tomb map.
---
My build is Enduring, Whispers, Monitor &amp; Abuse and BBQ with Combat Straps and Shattered Syringe (?). First 3 perks are kinda essential, fourth one is a wildcard (Brutal Strength, Spirit Fury, Surveillance, Nurse's - I saw people using those successfully)
---
&gt; his survivors just don't do gens 
---
No. Don't think that you get different survivors, and he's just lucky to get "friendly" lobbies. That's not the way to think, if you want to improve your game.
---
I've been playing the pig a lot, I've changed my mind for the game, I don't play to win I play for boops, I do agree there is a cause and effect for the toxic survivors but people can just be toxic for no reason other than it brings them joy. Give me boops and I'm happy regardless of the players.
---
Professor Oak: Are you a boy or a girl? 
---
You: WOW, can you not?
---
I mean I dunno why you'd plexpect anything else during rank reset. Its gonna be the most tryhards trying to rank back up.
---
Finally the buff ruin deserve ü§£
---
Feedback. Devs usually crank one out after a chapter or two has been out for a while.
---
Primarily just the fact that you felt the need to dm this guy and interrogate him. But if you can't see it, it really isn't my problem.
---
So kinda like legion's button
---
Solo queue at anything but red ranks is a 4k almost every game. Urs not a surprise
---
I never even though about faking a pickup with a trap. That‚Äôs big brain.
---
Idk about that, i main mike and trapper. It‚Äôs more about understanding map pressure, which nurse, spirit, and billy are naturally good at and more forgiving. You can literally 3 gen any map with any killer and 3k pretty easily.
---
Ghostface is not bad, objectively hes not "top tier", but he has a lot going for him. That sais, If you want a killer that is consistently good and rewards you for playing well, Billy is the way to go.
---
Down 4 survivor with a single use of the hillbilly chainsaw.
---
‚Ä¢ Must be done in a single trial.
---
You crouch and press 1 as a survivor to a crouching pig.
---
I‚Äôm only level 93 and only have 11days total play time, which is probably nothing, I didn‚Äôt get dead by daylight until ghostface was in beta, in fact I never got to experience the original ds
---
Yeah that's true I think I need to get better and make Chase times lower before I do anything else
---
I see what he complains about but its usually legit issues. His main point he tries to make is that dbd is a 4vs1 game while the devs any many of the playerbase treats it as a 1vs1. 
---
Sure DS is fine on it's own (though hardly "anti tunnel") there is 3 other people that could have it. Same goes for every most strong surv perks. On their own it's fine but as soon as theres multiple people in a match all running the meta it becomes a major issue. Also now that there is dedicated servers there can be a icon saying when there's a SWF group

On a semi related note *fuck keys* not sure if true hates them but I do. Even back when I mained surv I hated them. It's super BS that the survivor(s) can just nope out of a match by just happening to be running in the right spot. Like moris are shit to but you still need to do things to actually use that. To use a key you just need to let teammates die
---
As a main for Huntress myself leading them to pallets, windows are so good for hatch throwing its a guaranteed hit if you aim it good! Also if your in the chase try not to constantly pull out and aim your hatches cause that‚Äôs how you lose them since your moving speed is reduced a bit
---
Slugging is downing them but not hooking them, and MYC is make your choice where you can insta-down a rescuer. And I have no idea what Stoobuffle is. Super trapper buys furry llamas? Nailed it.
---
Oh of course
---
I'm not sure of the difference but if you research the samuri mask it will give the same description for a oni mask. Idk how to tell if a oni is a boy or girl but it says they wear the masks to ward away evil spirits.

To be fair, he also was a fan of stbfl

No signs, no sounds, no cues and no nothing. And this is what Tru3‚Äôs toxic army calls balanced.

Lemme tell you a story about it- it'll be more interesting than this meme, that's for sure
---
You know you don't have to be a dick about it, right?
---
Flashlights barely do anything anymore. If someones flashlight clicking they srent doing gens and half the time die trying to get saves
---
Also if you run unbreakable you won't be slugged, it's one of the few constants in this universe
---
easiest challange il do all day level 1 bubba on rank 1 here we go

üòèüëâüëâ
---
So i know console is littered with bugs and shit...but do flashlights just straight up not work there?
---
But then that would mean that the entity‚Äôs side of the deal is complete, meaning that The Spirit (and possibly The Ancestor) will no longer obey the entity
---
What new stuff did ghostface get?

Yeah, I have around 900 hours on PC and I still suck

And the reason is?

Save The Best For Last. It is a Myers perk, what it does is that every time you hit a non-obsession survivor you get a stack up to 8 stacks, and every stack grants 5% reduced (basic) attack cool down up to 40%. The downside however is that every time you hit your obsession, you lose two stacks. The perk is really great on killers that rely primarily on their basic attack to down survivors (like Trapper, Hag, Pig etc. less effective with Myers [ironically], Billy, and Leatherface)

Luck only helps you to find better rarity based item in chests and chance escaping hooks and bear traps. (Doesn't affect baptism traps)
---
Really? I didn't know that.

I'll try to make this constructive: you tell me what challenges you would come up with if you were in charge. I'll try to give some honest responses and see how that works. How does that sound?

Spirit is slower too

Honestly only "Decisive Light" and "No One Escapes the Endgame" seems hard. Well all need to level up freddy and trapper now lol.

---
&gt;rins father was originally ment to be the killer.
---
In the lore.. that's story telling, and especially based on that would be a very lazy and poor story if his dad will be a killer too. Very, very lazy
---
I hope we get something
---
Or when it's a baby Dwight
---
"I'm sorry, little one"
---
I warned my teammates ahead of time lol
---
Its really fucking obnoxious that we all get punished for "toxic survivors" when that's not the norm in my experience. I avg around rank 8-6 and people are relatively chill. Why the hell do all of us have to be treated like shit for a loud minority. 
---
Seriously even when killers are blatantly toxic I keep my cool but this is getting stupid. Starting to think i may as well become one, at least id deserve the shitty treatment
---
This and where's our BBQ&amp;chili
---
Is that a problem tho?
---
No hate intended either but I get hated on for saying anything about the Spirit in general. Brand New Part should be removed the game. Thats it. Its a dumb mechanic to have it in the game especially when 4 SWF can all bring it and wreck gens. I play killer too and I know. 
---
But I hate it when people say ‚Äúnerf DS‚Äù or ‚Äúmake it so DS deactivates if another person gets hooked‚Äù which defeats the purpose and lets the newly unhooked person get tunneled without any penalty for killer (especially now with janky hit boxes)
---
It doesnt matter that the Prayer Beads are purple. Everyone is bound to get them and they will run them for sure. Its not like we run into the same person using the same killer twice.
---
The game is intended to be fun but the developers don‚Äôt make it balanced for all parties. Make it so 3-4 man SWF people do gens a bit slower and so OoO is not as effective with larger SWF parties. Very same, make it so all killers are balanced. Fucking Legion is picking their butts with the same 4 boring perks while other top tier killers have viability with a wide range of Perks for games.
---
&gt; Securing the hooked survivor is the smart decision for the killer.
---
If you're sure that this will give you better result ("brutal" instead of "displeased"), I can see the logic in securing the kill. But is this true for most of trials? I doubt that.
---
Yeah that would be cool too as well. But the problem would be if they would unhook 2 or 3 survivors and than you can t really tell who was hooked and who wasn't so the only way to play against DS is slugging
---
Spirit 2: electric boogaloo
---
Yeah because that's totally an acceptable way to respond that makes me want to keep trying!
---
You're probably one of the people who do the shit that make people quit playing killer

But he‚Äôs not based on the movies. The Dead by Daylight Ghost Face is actually competent.

my final message

goodb ye
---
\*beepbeepbeepbeep\*
---
You'll have to be a sole survivor or just be lucky tagging gens first in a race between you and your colleagues, although prove thyself will help a lot combined. 
---
I must say you'll be way too lucky to be low rank Survivor and completing this is an easy gig. But be advised once someone is on a gen you can't do them, cause you didn't start them and it won't count. Another additional factor to note is that you still pip or gain higher rank for doing this trial... basically you'll go against experienced Killers so the more bothersome this will be.
---
Otherwise good luck finding a friendly Killer.  Oh and if you need a perk build?
---
Bond for knowing your Survivors' locations.
---
Urban evasion if needed to avoid Killer on rare cases.
---
Prove thyself obvious reasons.
---
And probably sprint burst or self care for trying to survive but depending on the match how it goes and the challenge perk.
---
I agree, I wish the game was more diverse at higher ranks but as you say if there‚Äôs a meta or unbalanced mechanic there is always bound to be people that are going to exploit it. 
---
I think that spirit needs an add ons rework like nurse, as right now it‚Äôs what keeps her viable against strong survivor parties. 
---
Also having the grass move when spirits phasing  would be a good idea (not my idea but I‚Äôve seen it floating around a few places)
---
And btw am a TrU3 fan, generalisations and stereotypes are never fun :(
---
He knows I‚Äôm getting chased because we finished last gen together and ghostface was right on me after üòÇ
---
And pro tip: Red ranks a vastly different from other ranks. Purples and greens, sure, they‚Äôre pretty much the same. But red rank survivors are far better than other ranks, and you can see it clear as day. With exceptions of course.
---
Don‚Äôt disagree with you on your post overall, but in what way would making Rin‚Äôs father a killer be lazy and poor story/implementation?
---
It should deactivate in many situations. Whenever survivor healed, started working on gen, went into the locker, another survivor hooked, stepped in the trap etc. Ds should be anti tunnel perk, but has too many ways to exploit it
---
 Don‚Äôt think it will be playable
---
I did this one on my first attempt.  (I actually finished 4 gens)
---
Here's the build I used: Dark sense, resilience, we'll make it, iron will.
---
Here's the strategy, tank a hit from the killer (it's easiest to do this after someone is picked up, you simply block the killer from getting to hook)  After you've tanked the hit hide for a bit.  (you're basically no mither (but quieter) so you're very fragile.  Use dark sense to choose which gen to do after you complete a gen.  Walk away from your gen if you feel the killer is near.   Abandon gens altogether if a chase is nearby, and if you need to go in for a save then try to get healed first.  After you're healed you can tank a hit again to get hurt safely.
---
Hmm 'the samurai'?
---
Wait till they have us do it to 2 or 3 people. You'll HAVE to slug and shit.
---
and thats how the killer started face camping me after getting downed with nobody escape's death
---
As a survivor, hook 3 killers in the basement in a single trial without running or crouching
---
Is this true? Many others have confirmed that you only need to complete the gens.
---
I think you need to wait for ability reveal before claiming he'll be 10x stronger
---
always run it with DS then
---
I wish more people thought like you, alot of these people who say these things are pure survivor mains who don't get why killers must do what they do
---
yea, sorry for tunneling in the END GAME
---
Can you link me the survey, I could do it on Xbox but it‚Äôs a pain
---
What? You are still on the map? Cancer camper
---
lemme wait 60 seconds when the gate is open. totally won't crawl out.
---
Ill be honest, after playing ghost face for a bit, i wanted voice chat but exclusively killer talking to survivors, i know its not going to get implimented ever but the thought of rounding a corner and yanking a survivor off a gen, or marked stabbing them from stealth while just saying "Waaaaazzzzzzuuuuuuppppp!!!" Is too funny to me.
---
I take gf with ebony and have fun teabagging faces of such bastards
---
Entigram is the best I have heard
---
Because that's what heroes do
---
Then you're fucked, what else to say lol
---
Wondering how you slugged, tunneled, and camped all at the same time. OP, are you a real gamer, unlike us fake gamers?
---
70% of my matches I do 4 gens. Maybe you guys should start doing the objective.
---
Why would you do that? Just find another survivor whose ds isnt active.
---
But but only survivors are toxic!!
---
The best ones are the games where 2 survivors disconnect/crash within the first minute, the killer slugs one guy to go for his precious 4k then gives it the GGEZ noob team at the end.
---
Had a few of those. I‚Äôm guessing these people don‚Äôt get to win much, so they brag at whatever chance they get.
---
PWYF, Award-winning Chilli, The Beast's Marks
---
Bubba train has no brakes
---
That would be great! (Sarcasm)
---
A killer more afraid of the survivor than the others already are
---
Do you follow leaks by daylight? People think its the dad of rin because of its powerset, crazy state normal state. We didnt have that with legion or spirit.
---
I think it's gonna be the ancestor. Clearly. Maybe he actually possessed Rin's father and he led the family to fall ?
---
It‚Äôs a rant, dummy. Tagged as such, too. I don‚Äôt want anyone to ‚Äúrag‚Äù on anyone and I don‚Äôt expect to escape every game (which is totally irrelevant I this situation, where I specifically one, single game). I posted the rant and I did move on lul you‚Äôre the one taking a rant to heart, seemingly offended.
---
Why does everyone think Bubba can only play with Insidous? Either your rank 21 or you‚Äôre delusional.
---
How about, instead of just saying "rEaD tHe WhOlE pOsT!" You ACTUALLY EXPLAIN?!
---
You talk about the problem with Freddy slowdown builds - I have mentioned that Swing Chains could be nerfed.
---
You called slowdown perks a crutch - I explained how they aren't.
---
You complained about sitting on gens for ages - I told you to get off the gens for a bit.
---
Could the game do with more objectives for Survivors? Maybe, but them Survivors would need more hook phases and maps would likely have to be bigger. Adding in extra objectives pushes gameplay more towards Friday the 13th.
---
10/10 drawing
---
That was just corny. You can‚Äôt insult a person when you look like that lol
---
Tru3, is this your burner account?
---
They could've altered the core design somewhat. The masks seen in the movies aren't perfectly symmetrical, often with one eye being more curved than the other and the mouth being wider than this.
---
Perhaps that's a rights issue, though.
---
Hes my favorite!
---
you don't have a spare minute in the end game.
---
"womans"?
---
Just wait until page 4.
---
As the other reply it's really bad with some killers, I've ran into 3 that have literally had there name as "AFKRiftFarming" or something of the like others may have had legitimate issues with their net or PC. I maybe wrong with some of the survivors, I'm just kinda assuming they are doing it too since the AFK'ers became much more common for me after this update in particular right after the second page was released.
---
what can I say, I give the people what they want

As Ghostface, chainsaw 6 Survivors during the Endgame Collapse, heal the equivalent of 4 health states, kill a single survivor twice by your own hands, wake up Jake Park 5 times, hit a generator 7 times after blinking, collect 3 new items, and escape through both the hatch and exit gates in a single trial without breaking any pallets.
---
They just learned a few words and wanted to say them
---
Just google "marth88 depip squad"
---
No it doesn't take ages to get points, but you can't tell me that it's not a waste of points.You spend them on something that you are never going to use.
---
I'd rather use them on something I'll play.
---
You're my hero
---
They are just hard as hell to aim with, I‚Äôve been playing for the better half of 2 years now and I have never been blinded or blinded a killer unless it was a 100% not gonna  miss blind like at a pallet.
---
they also didn't release any survivors with **THE** ghostface, and still called it chapter, so they had time to make 2 for stranger things
---
For a moment I thought how funny would it be to have Eustace as a killer
---
Hook 5 Survivor in the Basement. Huh?
---
Gameplay first, cosmetics second. 
---
Once you've gotten the perks that you want you won't have anything to spend your shards on, at which point you can start gathering them to buy a cosmetic you like.
---
I destroy any uncoordinated group but a full 4 man always makes me have to tryhard, I think that‚Äôs a problem with game mechanics not survivors
---
\&gt;  the Entity originally wanted Ron‚Äôs father 
---
Confirmed killer Arthur Weasley?
---
black metal Jeff has ascended!
---
Me @ the Ruin/Bamboozle/NoED Billy that hardcore tunneled me in solo queue for 5 gens and complained about getting an Entity Displeased
---
I'd love to play as the killer in Dead by Daylight unfortunately the queue times are 10+ min on PC. That's as long as I wanted to waste time waiting. 
---
Instead I queue in as Survivor and hope my team mates dont ragequit first time they get hit by the killer and we are 3 v 1. Or be the only person repairing generators in the game. Mind you I started playing this game just a week ago. 
---
Other games my team and I get stomped in 2 min by killer killing everyone. Other games I watch my team neither repairing nor picking people up. I get killed and I watch Claudette run ing around uh and just hiding from the killer the whole vame.
---
Yeah I bet survivor mains wanted all killers to be like wraith. Comparing one of the worst and bad designed killer in the game with the only viable isnt that smart. His power is complitely useless and hes only viable with powerfull add ons and after many work. Also, he can see the survivors and spirit dont

---
I didn't even see what happened the first time I watched this because I blinked.
---
Ohhhh thanks
---
New killer? Crab boy.
---
With the mask apparently being a Hannya mask, associated with female demons, and the blood that is being drawn into it belonging at least in part to Rin's mother, I could see that rather than Rin's father, or the warlord Yamaoka, Rin's mother is being conjured as a vengeful, sorrowful demon here.
---
There was an oath made when the Entity took Rin, promising the revenge she sought to bring upon her father. So it would make sense for the father to be taken as a survivor into the realm, tormented relentlessly then not only by Rin, but also by the other woman he slaughtered, his wife.
---
And stabbed 28 times
---
JOJO, TAKE THIS!! MY FINAL HAMON!!
---
Same but with survivor. I can't loop for shit
---
Kill them all
---
ohhhh
---
Chapter 14 is only going to be a paragraph tho. That means we'll be getting just the killer and since the teaser was all around Yamaoka it's most likely some ancestor or a demon possessing the mask.
---
Bruh I feel you, just gotta be lucky and find a farming killer, basically the only way to do it
---
&gt;  its definitely going to change the way you play.
---
Like suiciding or DCing when they realize they won't be able to get it, thus ruining the match more than these dumb challenges already do.
---
becaaaause noed doesn't counter ds? what type of comparison is that
---
Her wig got snatched
---
Watching him makes me wanna play survivor again, but then I get tunneled by a spirit and my 3 team mates DC
---
I got my 4K challenge done by me dcing
---
Okay. And how it was relevant in this conversation?
---
Nobody's saying that it's the same thing, the purpose of the comparison and this imaginary fully invisible wraith is to show what the problem with the spirit is.
---
Not having any feedback on the survivor side isn't fun nor fair.
---
If you could actually see what you could buy, it would look dope!
---
Yeah, but if you're even slightly competent you can easily hear survivors and most of the time even guess where they'll be. And that is if you don't even take scratch marks, blood pools or moving grass/corn into account
---
And before you start about "survivor mains" again: Rank 8 killer and Rank 5 survivor. I mained Spirit before switching to Legion. Spirit is incredibly bland and unfun to play as, and unfair and unfun to play against. She needs changes

I'm 100% sure I'm going to get severely downvoted too for just speaking out my opinion, but this 'OK boomer' meme is getting boring and stale really quickly. As the person commented above said, it applies to literally anyone who they disagree with. 
---
At least, the 'nobody: somebody:' and 'he protecc, he attacc' memes can be funny if done well and in a different style than usual despite those memes are also overused, but 'OK boomer' is just a low-effort meme. 
---
Also, your original reply isn't really offensive, but the amount of people who downvoted you is a lot :O And I applaud to you that you were still cool with your replies and didn't get angry despite people still downvoting you. Personally, I only downvote comments that are toxic and mean. I would never downvote a comment that I disagree with if that person is polite about it.
---
It's funny that the 'OK boomer' people say that you're offended but the way they reply seem like they're the ones who are bothered by it  XD
---
After spirit nerf there won‚Äôt be one single killer who is clearly the best though - so variety will increase 
---
Probably see more Freddies, GF, Plague and Billies
---
I had Unbreakable which lets you get up from dying state once per match.
---
Lol. Man after my own heart
---
This is from my thoughts as a killer main. I think a better way to fix it is to activate on the first and second hook. The timer should either stay the same or be reduced to 45 seconds since there will be two charges.
---
They're not jerks for using perks to avoid tunnelling jerks but they could make it so DS deactivates if they hook someone else.
---
Probably another loopable killer with very weak power with hotfix week later to make him not legion tier, but still bad
---
I think people are just tired of the generic, low effort ‚ÄúSurvivor r bad,‚Äù memes that often get to hot on this subreddit. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a hot take, but disguising your genuine opinion as a ‚Äúmeme,‚Äù to deflect criticism is really dumb. You could say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not their opinion it‚Äôs just a joke,‚Äù but these jokes are so recycled at this point you could classify them into:
---
- Toxic Nea/Claudette makes a mistake and killer is smug
---
- Toxic Nea/Claudette use items and meta perks and/or bright cosmetics because they are toxic
---
- Survivor is toxic in post game chat after being stomped
---
- Basically what equates to r/enlightenedcentrism wherein the OP jerks themselves off about playing both sides while killers and survivors argue
---
It‚Äôs the lowest common denominator for content on this sub, and just repeatedly harps on this strawman of toxic survivors created by upset killers angrily typing on Reddit after losing a game.
---
How did you know that?
---
Couldn't get the hair correctly sorry if it looks weird
---
what really bothers me is that he‚Äôs so nonchalant about openly not caring about ruining someone‚Äôs game (7). Like I play both sides, mostly survivor not gonna lie, and I understanding wanting to win and everything. But tailoring you‚Äôre play style to make sure others won‚Äôt enjoy a game they have every right to enjoy just because you don‚Äôt want them too? He just seems like a major asshole tbh
---
or for you if you chose to go on the other side of the map for something and she ignores it. it's almost like going to self-care in the corner of the map, but it also makes the area deadly
---
It also tells the rest "ABANDON NON-CLEANSE" and makes the area around it more deadly
---
and because you told everyone to cleanse, she will have at least one close by in the end
---
Lmao no

Damn, I felt that lol
---
To be fair rins dad might be innocent. It wasnt his will to kill his family the entity corrupts people. Look at the wraith, dude never wanted to kill anyone until he found out he was a mass murderer. That moment right there made him kill his boss (and rightly so) and at that point the entity corrupted him. Its the entity that tortured him until he could kill innocent survivors.
---
This.
---
And that the killer has pop goes the weasle.
---
[lel](https://youtu.be/yeInSY1Khnw)
---
You don't know they have DS though lmao...
---
That's because people seem to forget that they can flashlight him out of his cloak for a free stun even when hes in the middle of uncloaking. Only one person has done that to me when I play Wraith.
---
I doubt they will fix these until next patch or update, and you'd be surprised to see how I did few activities but still gained more than usual for a challenge. I did count, and they're miscalculated bugs.
---
There is also where you still gain assist points if you were once close to your Survivors but once far away and if you or someone else takes damage you gain free assist points for no reason.
---
Great to hear, good luck!
---
Bro I can never detect him I look the fucker right in the eyes and 80% of the time nothing happens and I just get marked
---
Ok thanks, now I will make sure I save my DS after my first hook for the time I am unhooked for the second time, just wait till all the survivors will do this
---
Ghostface outfit too

It will get better. But for killed it only seems to get worse

If you unlocked a teachable perk then that perk can appear in all survivor bloodwebs. Its just a matter of rng. Teachable perks get unlocked at level 30/35/40 (each survivor has 3 perks). Once its unlocked all survivors can then get the perk

You keep levelling Kate, and the perk will appear sooner or later. It's a random thing.

I used to use dark scenes and it's actully Good if you haven't figurer out THE Killer or if someone finishes a Gen before your about to and you van se IF THE Killer Us going to you or not. It helped me allt of Times. Tip: Play with Four friends and communicate to get 3 gens
---
You were playing the game before it was even announced
---
I was able to do it after only three tries! I was so glad, worst quest done. The fourth Tome is gonna be fun though...
---
It doesnt even take a garbage team, it just takes a team that does gens WITH you
---
Detective Tapp. A goddamn American Hero.
---
I like the idea of Rin's dad taking up his ancestor's mantle and serving as a vessel, at least in his eyes (The entity (probably) can't bring back those who didn't die in its realm, this would be the perfect solution for both.)
---
I want to say that's a heavy quote but I've been playing him recently and haven't herd him say that
---
You wrote the same word 6 times...
---
4k swf but there‚Äôs another rando? What.
---
Adam's dad... Adad. A dad.
---
Or just fuck with then cause it's fun
---
 I need a hero  
---
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night  
---
He's gotta be strong  
---
And he's gotta be fast  
---
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
---
Yeah, survivors can sabotage them without consequences unless you have the ultra rare bloody coils equipped.
---
Lol why do i feel like we were in the same match xD
---
The effects only work if they step in it.
---
I saw it happen a few times and in the past few patches it seems like you can "enter" the locker you're stuck in to reset into the correct state
---
I like the idea of the entity making Rin's father think he's using himself as a vessel for his ancestor in order to reclaim his lost honor.
---
Damn. I think I do. They're purple.
---
payday tomorrow and im getting it, looks amazing apart from the few issue with it
---
inside jokes are a thing
---
Yasuo confirme for dbd?
---
Nope, not on switch, they haven't addressed anything either other than a week or so ago in the patch notes saying still not on switch, no eta. 
---
Keep in mind they said something was on  'all platforms' like 2 skin packs ago and never said anything about the switch not actually having it, so why change now.
---
I think switch is like 1 big patch plus like 3 skin packs behind now, or something like that, assuming at this point new killer will be out before it gets caught up.
---
Ultra-rare are red. Sounds like you may be thinking of the honing stone. (inflicts dying if they escape themselves) a team mate can rescue them without them dying. If they don't get caught in it, they can just walk up and sabo it without any problems.
---
I need an Oni killer. I didn't know I want one but now I NEED one
---
possible if the gold were 1 bar from iridescent
---
Map control, patrolling generators as killer makes it easy to find survivors and difficult for them to make progress, I would recommend trapper for new players
---
I NEED A HERO!
---
Not in November my friend, you gotta respect the NNN.
---
look at legion's hand (that doesn't hold the milk)
---
It's also blurry
---
All they had to do was making the milk-holding fingers more blurry and that would look decent enough
---
ye i bought it right after drop and it looks a bit weird when you‚Äôre in night shroud..hope they gonna fix it soon. but yeah the outfit looks amazing imo
---
I don't think the entity can bring back people who didn't die in its realm. He's probably done torturing Rin's dad into wanting to kill and has made him think he's serving as a vessel for his ancestor to reclaim his honor, like how The Nurse thinks she's purifying people or the Doctor thinks he's treating people.
---
The devs said that entety controlled him I belive.
---
That's the joke
---
They said on Twitter? That they had some progress with switch issues they had and it might be coming next week.
---
I like this idea! I always wanted a way to try new things. Routes, perks, killers and etc. There is no casual mode or even something to play against bots, so trying silly things is always kind of... You are destroying someone‚Äôs fun. Also, imagine being able to be in that lobby you are talking about while waiting for queue.
---
We'll get Xmas event in July!
---
Happy Cake Day
---
That voice in the teaser sure sounded female...
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Atleast someone gets my drift
---
I like the idea, but in this form it is horrible overpowered. You would never been able to play him, cause people would instant leave.
---
Okay thats fucking amazing
---
(Shh; most people still think you need to solo all three gens, and they haven't bothered to test it themselves.)
---
the mask looks better than vanilla mask imo because it‚Äôs like a clean white but yeah in most outfits the body part is enough
---
Google translate has failed me
---
Ok, any ideas for balance
---
What
---
These perks currently are mandatory, yet when survivors are suggested to use perks that were made to counter other perks/killers they scream.
---
It's not really funny then, you're just saying the same thing over and over again it doesn't get funnier if you say it more than 2 times
---
I have like 200 on Ghostface and don't play him that often anymore. Gonna keep them for a while lol
---
We'll see. Be ready to be ridiculed in case you're wrong tho
---
I was like "why tf does he crawl there and don't get up right... oh that's why."
---
Yeah, you're right. Criticism is something you can't avoid
---
If you‚Äôre talking about ‚ÄúThis is Happening,‚Äù you don‚Äôt actually have to be injured and *use* the bonus from TINH.  You just have to hit Great checks while TINH is equipped, even if you‚Äôre healthy while you do it.
---
‚ÄúDeplete a Medkit‚Äù also seems like it‚Äôs supposed to read ‚Äúdelete the *equivalent* of a brown medkit‚Äù because I got credit for using 3 medkits after using a normal kit with charge add-ons

actually, I forgot that she has her copies pop up. I'm a disgrace.
---
yes, those change as well. let me edit my comment
---
If you play on steam you can verify game integrity and fix broken files
---
That's super helpful, what survivors do you recommend? Are they all pretty much the same?
---
If you run Deliverance, you'll get found first
---
If you run DS, you won't get tunneled
---
If you run Unbreakable, you won't get slugged
---
To get net worth out of it, run all three of them together. Now you have a free slot for something funky, yuppee!
---
Not when she can kill him over and over again for eternity it is
---
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable
---
I'm not arguing with you so stop while your ahead.
---
The problem is that DS lasts for so long, that I once hooked 2 people after a DS user was unhooked and I still got stabbed. And I hook one survivor before accidentally finding DS user on regular basis and still get stabbed. That shit is extremely annoying.

Sometimes my connection crashes right when I'm in a chase, leading my character to stop moving, get downed and then DC. I assume people think I'm trash because of it.

The evidence is so e evident that OP didn't include it in the meme.

Survivors: Oh no! Whatever will I do!?

Yeah you got it right,that's heavy

New killer is actually the corrupted monk from Sekiro: Shadows die twice confirmed

Why not

Blue fog is for Fog Whisperers
---
Key - I think it's a hammer (?) and it's for DbD (not reddit) mods/community managers.
---
You can't have them as a normal player
---
That's the thing though. There can never be a payoff because the entity feasts on hopelessness and basically just holds a carrot on a stick infront of the people he abducts. I doubt he has any intention of letting the people go
---
Why did you expect better from them, exactly? 
---
*Pretty good job so far*?
---
Well, I‚Äôll add my thoughts here I guess. 
---
I‚Äôve read the comments here and I don‚Äôt remember ever seeing it written that it was specifically the entity that called out to Rin‚Äôs father to make him go crazy and kill her mother and Rin herself.
---
So I would pose that, after watching the teaser, the next killer would be known as ‚ÄúThe Oni‚Äù.
---
Given the nature of the entity as an otherworldly being, it wouldn‚Äôt be crazy to assume that myths in our world could be real as well. Oni can refer to a wicked ancestral spirit, so if the original Yamaoka was an evil human, it‚Äôs very possible he became an oni after death. Add in Rin‚Äôs bloodline, and it could be possible he used his influence over his own blood to possess Rin‚Äôs father at the moment where he had a mental break and killed her and her mother. 
---
There are two other killers already in the entity‚Äôs entourage that had a mental break before being taken by the entity, so I imagine that the entity could have A.) taken Rin‚Äôs possessed father who had fused with and become The Oni, or B.) promised the Oni spirit itself fulfillment in the entity‚Äôs realm. 
---
Given that from my research of Oni, only the most wicked of men become Oni (and Rin‚Äôs father doesn‚Äôt seem very terrible besides a mental break) I‚Äôm leaning more toward B, as the teaser felt more like the killer was leaning toward the First Yamaoka and if so, I think Rin‚Äôs father would fit the bill for the survivor, as it‚Äôs possible the Oni or the entity could‚Äôve lured him in with the possibility of seeing his daughter once more (unbeknownst to him as The Spirit).
---
This is all speculation obviously, but the Oni mask was a very interesting thing to have in that teaser as Oni are notorious for killing humans in Japanese lore, and it would mark the first original killer from a historical folklore perspective as opposed to ‚Äúhumans becoming deranged killers‚Äù.
---
So we now know the dad was always planned to be a killer...now a little over a year latter we get him as a killer. NOICE!
---

---
I like the omnidirectional thing.
---
Survivors are only reskins of each other, the only difference being their perks. Once you reach level 30 on a survivor you can start earning their teachable, meaning you can get that perk on any other survivor. As far as good perks all of Claudette‚Äôs are useful. David King has one to help with the bloodpoint grind, Dwight‚Äôs perks are also good for helping each other out.
---
A soul for a soul.
---
We didnt know about the perk at the beginning of the game. I was saying we notice his speed at the beginning of the game lol
---
F.
---
Your STBFL stacks or your Nae Nae privilages, your choice

DS players are baiting you to it every single game. not a problem at all

Adam's worst nightmare would be surviving trials with one of his students.

Oh I see, well I don't believe any of those effect speed so that is strange.

Detective Tapp has made his choice.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhSHXGM7kgE
---
Counts medkits depleted by whole team I believe.
---
If you save up enough iridescent shards, you might be able to afford a a sense of humor!
---
I mean, Rin's backstory is mostly about her father. He's the one who killed her, but the mask isn't her father, it's just an Oni mask. Considering the Oni mask in the newest teaser seems to be watching what happened and soaking up the blood, I'd say this killer is just going to be an Oni, they're believed to punish evil or unjust people, also believed to spread disease which may hint toward a Plague-esque power maybe?
---
Flair checks out
---
Ghostface, hag, and spirit should be s tier with legion as well, my favorites. And Damn piggys mori isn't much but its way better than nurse or doctor, those are probably the most boring moris
---
remember when ppl thought the DS "nerf" was gonna be shit?
---
Hard to believe but it‚Äôs true and I been doing some research on the sub reddit seems like others have the issue I‚Äôm having. It‚Äôs a buggy game u can‚Äôt just throw that out the window not saying it‚Äôs a bug but not saying it cant be either u feel me
---
ah interesting. thanks for the tidbit of information. just remember that being the first thing regarding DBD that I watched. started playing around that time back in 2018
---
I can agree with ghostface and hag but not with spirit
---
Also happy cake day
---
I... Accept this.
---
And a couple of seconds later a teaser for the next chapter comes out and steals the attention of the outfit's release
---
When you unlock a teachable perk, it will start appearimg like every other shared perk. It will pop up sooner or later
---
A soul for a soul...
---
Aww... truth hurts you know.
---
Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed
---
Uncertainty is precisely what *makes* something a mindgame.
---
If you could see her, it *definitely* wouldn't be a mindgame.
---
Not saying that can't enjoy the outfit though! :)
---
Well yeah, I feel your pain and I never said it was fair or justified but a lot of the salty killers are because or toxic survivors as well and they turn normal survivors into toxic survivors and then it's almost a never ending cycle
---
Well except for nurse.. who is clearly the best right now... so the best killer actually wont change. At all.
---
The Geist
---
Yeah man, same for me on xbox one. Him and hag are the worst
---
Take Claudette. She is one of the sneakiest ones because of her model.
---
I helped a friend to do this mission in a 3 swf, we two distracted the killer while he does 3 gens, well, he did it, but forgot to equip dark sense xD
---
3 gens with Dark sense is actually driving me insane. Other people won't 99 gens and leave them for you to pop . It feels like the devs expect us to play in SWF otheriwse fuck you .
---
Is that a fucking finger xd
---
Xd
---
As a Kate main, I have to upvote your comment because of your flair.
---
The eyyyyyyeee
---
Tell that to the entity
---
Yeah to play as . By the way just because something isn't in the lime light of being broken doesn't mean it doesn't need to be nerfed. By that logic we should only nerf by who we complain about.
---
‚ÄúThink we‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far‚Äù
---
Pink?
---
Imagine being so toxic you endure the matchmaking and then refuse to play the game.
---
Also, you can easily secure the safety pip at red ranks (and the pip at lower ranks) by doing gens and all totems and going near the afk killer to get either chase or stealth points for Evader. It's easy iridescent unbroken, gold/iridescent lightbringer, and bronze/silver evader depending on your commitment to the pip.
---
The voice sounded pretty manly
---
And this is why we bring a Mori lol
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Some of them have ticking a ticking RBT on their head instead.
---
DS isn‚Äôt strong though. It‚Äôs much worse than what it used to be.
---
Idc who the killer is I just want to see it,so stop arguing about something we don‚Äôt know
---
I actually think it was recovering on the ground. I died with like 3 gens left but I self cared to like 15% before going down and I fully recovered on the ground.
---
YOU THOUGHT ME GONE BUT I CAME BACK JUST AS YOU WAKED UP HAHA
---
"I believe it's nothing to do with Rin's dad"
---
Few hours later: Your blood belongs to the Yamaoka!
---
no one is saying that she's overpowered; in fact she's not. People say that she's unfun because you almost never know when she's using her power.
---
Also all tru3 did in his video was say "uh that's nut what i said" he didn't really say anything to disprove scott
---
It's as little fun for the killer as it is for you... The best choice in this scenario would be to let the other survivors gen rush while you take your time on the hook. Doesn't help you a lot, I know, but it's the best you can do. This way the killer also doesn't get any points and will derank. It's a stupid thing, yes but for now we are stuck with it.
---
I bet you are one of those people who think people hate spirit just bc she is good and for no other reason.
---
Love ol' Leatherface but he fucking sucks. Still, the noises he makes and the chainsaw keep me coming back. XD
---
survive with friends.
---
Aka 4stacks.
---
Dude why should killer get stunned because survivor was farmed, also iam talking about it going off after you hook another survivor
---
Lol do you need encouragement...
---
Go on little guy, you can do it! Keep trying to play killer.
---
Ohh right so it could just be coincidence and timing. Makes sense. I will update you if the error fixes on my end. Also UK here.
---
If your team knows how to combat camping, your team will win, and killer will lose. This game is not about a single survivor, it's about team of survivors (even when you play with randoms)
---
11...I'm not the best, I only started playing this game 2 months ago.
---
57 on my trapper
---
They are asking for me to use franklins as killer because of the flashlight one xD
---
ruin is tbh overrated and kind of inefficient. I know that this is unrelated but a perk like Corrupt Intervention works wonders in a situation like that
---
bruh
---
at red ranks you assume all 4 are running it
---
I don't have anything against normal use of ds but ppl just abuse that perk
---
Bro it‚Äôs horrible but unfortunately the response u will get is either ‚Äúget gud‚Äù from the community or from the devs ‚Äútry civilization‚Äù
---
If you allow people to abuse DS then that‚Äôs on you. It‚Äôs perfect as it is.
---
I always use corrupt over ruin but if you cant find the totem than ruin is a nightmare for lower ranks
---
this my friends, is the show of true bravery and sacrifice. Guess Tapp really is a great policeman, who cares what jigsaw says?
---
"I have 50% of the survivor team doing nothing, i can easily counter the survivor that is chasing me chase this other person by baiting them and downing them 2, leading to an easy snowball into my victory."
---
Yeah it‚Äôs likely coincidence. Your whole internet would go down otherwise, at least that‚Äôs what happened when the guy did it to me.
---
Which platform do you use him on
---
Becuase Scott's whole video was saying Tru3's methods for beating spirit are wrong, but then went off on some tangent about stuff tru3 never talked about.
---
If you actually watch the full video he does in fact explain exactly why the methods he stated work and breaks down literally every part of Scott's video and points out many places where his tactics would have been far superior to what was shown in the video.
---
But yeah watch 5mins of a 50min video and then say it didnt say much lmao
---
Also, tons and tons and heaps and loads of people say shes OP. Including Scott jund. Soooo yeah not sure where you got that bullshit lol
---
As someone who plays both games, I still think DBD is way less toxic than LoL, in my 300ish hours of DBD I encountered less toxicity than I do in about 10 games of league. The community in DBD just looks at everything as toxic, for example using the perks in the game (and yeah, J do think excessive teabagging is toxic, and I do play both sides equally).

* Most crossposts are automatically removed, as they are typically unreleated to Dead by Daylight.

*Pretty good job so far
---
Yeah let's say you hook 3 survivor 4th one rescue them so now you can only chase one survivor
---
imo the best change would be this 
---
for survivor : pause the ds timer as long as you are in chase or in dying state. 
---
for Killer : if the survivor heals or touches a gen then ds should deactivate
---
this should make it truly anti tunnel
---
Ps4. No map pressure, ability doesn't help with loops, strandard lower tier killer package.
---
Still he's fun, just frustrating.
---
They already are on many levels.
---
Seems a bit unfair for the farmed survivor if killers get no punishment for tunneling. Tunneling is a strategy, just no surviver likes it.
---
&gt;you'll know if you don't run any obsession perks and theres still one
---
Not really solid evidence - Now you are getting into the territory of using DS prediction builds and guessing rather than anything to do with deliverance and being broken. You can do that anyway if you suspect they have DS.
---
IMO there is really nothing wrong with DS. When I play killer, it just gives them another chance and I'm usually feeling bad for a survivor anyway if I down them within 30 seconds of them being hooked.
---
As you say the only place it gets really frustrating is if you use it at crunch time at the end of the game. And that isn't in the survivors control. THis is also when the perk is most fun for survivors to use.
---
In all honesty I stopped using DS after the nerf. It isn't that good a perk in comparison to other that will help you multiple times in a game. It is only meta because it is fun, and it turns the tables on killers by letting you slap them.
---
People are getting pissed off because of builds like inner strength, DS, Head on. I'm like dude, that is 3 perks they are using to create a fun, tailored build, that gives them the upper hand in 1 situation, where you are likely able to catch them again anything. Not to mention it relies on totem cleansing..
---
&gt; It's as little fun for the killer as it is for you... 
---
So you're saying they're playing in a way that's not fun for them on purpose?
---
If you have adrenaline then you‚Äôll just always be dead before the last gen pops. Or is that just me
---
I see you‚Äôre at least a man of culture as well
---
One minute is more than enough time to hook someone else and often have the DS user come in for the save. Plenty of skilled players with DS will also hop on a generator right after unhook, often while injured, knowing DS allows them to do it. 
---
If you just want to stop tunnelling, let DS end the moment the user touches a gen, or somebody else gets hooked.
---
Scott said that she's not overpowered, he said that the lack of counterplay makes her feel overpowered (see: old legion). People that think that she's overpowered  don't see the actual problem with her
---
you‚Äôre not supposed to use it to dodge the killer attack. using it to get it windows or get to pallets is the best way to use it
---
I would‚Äôve honestly preferred if it were like 12 legions pre rework than another spirit lore character.
---
Yeah but because it happened so early in the game I lost a pip because I wasn't able to do anything, that's why I think it's unfair :(
---
They will not rank up and won't get much BP, so they do already get punished. The people that facecamp don't give a fuck though. They do it specifically to ruin the fun of others. Bunch of sad people playing this game.
---
Doesnt the roadmap show that chapter 14 is comming without a map?
---
Your fault then.
---
You always fall the way your character faces. Position yourself correctly and you will escape automatically once you get downed
---
Well they definitely succeed in ruining the fun :/
---
I'm red rank and I don't run it because it genuinely isn't as good as other perks - even if it is fun and can get you out of a sticky situation.
---
It is quite meta though. Still this has nothing to do with deliverance or being broken - you are essentially saying 'just slug everyone in red ranks'. 
---
As someone who sometimes runs tenacity because I find it fun. Bring it on.
---
shhhh we dont talk about that...
---
Who hurt you?
---
Not all heroes wear caps, oh wait
---
What a mediocre streamer.

---
Shut up, Timmy. You don‚Äôt even know what they do.
---
Why you people will learn, that you are not supposed to escape every game. Sometimes you have to be a sacrificial lamb.
---
Sorry whats playtesting?
---
Don't wanna start a lengthy argument, but: If it's not about your own plays ingame (as survivor), but the overall teamplay, why are you measured by your own actions then (Pips)? In that case it would make more sense to split the points evenly across every survivor at the end of the match. But somehow I don't think that this would work.
---
I thought this was Reddit, not your house where you decide the rules
---
He doesn‚Äôt want the inevitable nerf so he feverishly panics and shows a montage of him doing really weak outplays and says ‚Äòlook guys there‚Äôs counterplay to her‚Äô
---
The best of course being when the spirit clearly switched targets and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄòLOOK GUYS SHE CAN FIND ME THAYS COUNTERPLAY‚Äô
---
I am one of those people that didn't even know that DbD was also on windows store.
---
And well, didn't know that it's ran by SteamAPI on the Steam version, thought that BHVR run their own servers or something, but I see now.
---
No tool in this game is toxic. People and their actions are toxic.
---
Just don't even open the chat. It has no purpose other than spreading disease
---
The other day I was playing as Freddy. The second they realized I was playing him, one of them disconnected. I downed and hooked a survivor shortly after, and as soon as they were hooked, they disconnected. Within seconds a third disconnected. After that, I let the last one find the hatch.
---
Within minutes I was greeted with a message from the survivor I had hooked. It just read ‚ÄúFreddy is trash‚Äù
---
I was laughing so hard at that.

I‚Äôm not deciding the rules I‚Äôm just saying we don‚Äôt know who the killer exactly is so stop arguing
---
&gt;you can never be DS if you don‚Äôt tunnel
---
Please tell me how hooking someone, then going after another survivor and downing/hooking them, then grabbing a now fully healed survivor off a gen and getting dsed is 'tunneling'? DS is a meta perk not because it's anti-tunnel, but because it gives you a minute of impunity.
---
It should deactivate if you perform any action other than healing and once you're fully healed.

Most survivors don't do their objective sadly. That's what hurts me.

y
---
So, it's not fun, it's not profitable BP wise, it's not a viable strategy (according to reddit)... then why are there so many campers?
---
As a doctor main I help make sure they don't do their objectivrs. You're welcome
---
The issue is there‚Äôs nothing in the game to disincentivize tunnelling, a lot of the time it‚Äôs the optimal strategy. Like I‚Äôm wondering if even just a time buffer should be on a survivor who got unhooked so hits and hooks against them within that time reward less blood points. Too much of a buffer and it becomes unreasonable so it‚Äôs tough to balance
---
That seems like a hitbox problem
---
they aren't transfered, you can't earn any rift fragments after the rift closes
---
To keep it short: because ranks are stupid.

My pc fucking dies down there, especially if I'm playing freddy too

Fuck you, I felt that

Nobody:

Streamers with custom perks:
---
A killer called The Pig puts reverse bear traps on downed survivors. Once a generator is completed it activates a timer that counts down unless you‚Äôre being chased or in dying state. Survivors have to find Jigsaw boxes to interact with and ‚Äúfind a key‚Äù to remove the trap but I kept getting interrupted and ultimately downed with only a few seconds remaining. I used those seconds to rescue Steve.
---
You did alright. You can rest now :'(

Damn, thanks for update, but seems like it's not happening.

Poor thing

Or if you know they could be hooked just do it closer to one less person in the game
---
but don't the challenges stay open or will they only award blood points when it closes?There is a new rift coming in January/February
---
I'm in purple ranks, which I think is average, and while I do encounter toxicity, I think most people just overexaggerate it a bit.
---
HOLY MOLY IS THAT A JOJO'S REFERENCE?!??!?! XD ORA ORA ORA MUDA MUDA MUDA!! OH YOURE APPROACHING ME FUNNY FUNNY LINE COME CLOSER YARE YARE DAZE!!! /s
---
Jokes aside I love jojos lmao
---
Hex: Ruinn't has been buffed do to several complaints of not countering Hex: Ruin enough. Therefore, Hex: Ruinn't matches up with Hex: Ruin. Thank you for your patience as we resolved this issue.
---
I don‚Äôt care if they do it; they paid for the game so they have the right to play how they want. I just wish blocking did something, because I never want to play with these boring fucks that invalidate every single survivor that isn‚Äôt DS, BT or exhaustion.
---
Are people going to speak memes in the future? 
---
I believe it. Is going to be it's own language 
---
(Don't boo me I am right)
---
This isn't a bug, that's just that the entity is on crack
---
When I did this challenge I hadn't even healed but I was getting chased the whole time while gen after gen got popped then he dced and it said I completed the challenge
---
Farewell, comrade.
---
The original mask looks intentionally silly or stupid
---
This just looks unintentionally silly or stupid
---
Scare factor is unarguably superior in this mask
---
Freddy is the new Doctor of the consoles
---
He uploaded a video of the match in another thread. The last survivor was standing on the hatch. He ran over and closed it right when it opened and then downed the survivor.  Who knows what happened before that but it could have been enough to make the survivor salty.
---
Looks like a new skin for Hag tho
---
Franklin's on survivors? When you DS, he drops his camera.
---
I doubt he‚Äôs gonna be similar to spirit though
---
Seriously. The whole point of them is to give you another objective/playstyle to complete during your match. Some of them might take more than one match to get it, but still easily done.
---
Personally, I'm enjoying the tome.
---
Try this hat on:
---
I knock down the person who unhooks, try to knockdown a TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON nearby and the person who got unhooked previously jumps in to take a hit and then they crawl ON TOP of the previously downed person so I will pick them up and they DS me.
---
Who is tunneling who now? (and the first person who says it's a smart/legit strategy is getting the stink eye from me)
---
JOJO THIS IS THE LAST OF MY HAMON
---
Complaining about gore when you're playing a horror game makes no sense.
---
Oh I know. It was just to point out that the devs seen the community complaining and did the opposite of what they should have done ü§£
---
Press F
---
I dunno I‚Äôm pretty excited for the new killer
---
That was a wild crazy ol' Nuxinator reference.
---
You guys do realize they could just have a different version of the game available for those countries?
---
Germans know this well. A lot of their games on steam have kiddy versions with blood replaced with flowers or teddy bears. Nothing stopping BHVR from leaving the current version in for the countries that require it and adding a gore toggle for the other folk. Nothing except laziness, of course.
---
I‚Äôm outta loop, what is this
---
Ahh, so today‚Äôs killer good survivor bad content: survivors shouldn‚Äôt use their perks because that‚Äôs scummy.
---
(I haven't played for a while) Why are there so many memes about spirit being op? Does she has been buffed or something?
---
I want to adopt you
---
Welcome to playing killer against certain SWFs.
---
Right????? 3 gens is a breeze! 
---
&gt;prefer ones like this than scare fucking 20 crows
---
Exactly! Where's the skill in that??? It's not a challenge at all!
---
He could‚Äôve played normally at least and gotten way more points out of it. He most likely depipped and ended with 14k BPs when he could‚Äôve easily gotten close to 30k. And he was playing Pig. Against a non-SFW lobby. After rank reset. Cmon now.
---
Removed for oversaturated content
---
I remember back with old freddy, Id stomp low and mid ranks with him. I got called so many names and threatened alot. 
---
Freddy was the worst killer in the game too.
---
Good but  you only drew 10 strands of hair going up and 4 strands of hair going down.
---
Ghost has 12 strands going up and 5 going down.
---
Otherwise it‚Äôs not bad!
---
Huh
---
I just don't see pwyf ever being good. Stbfl is definitely a lot of fun and very similar but pwyf? Do you have a certain playstyle to make it fun?
---
You think only newbies die and lose pips to camping killers?
---
I wish I could draw :(
---
if anything it'll be a legion style skin
---
Then load in game and can only see 3/4 ths of your screen
---
Your a good man soldier I salute you
---
My bad...
---
Because she has no counterplay accept it already.  Before (and probably even now) Nurse was better than spirit but she was less frustrating to play against because you could really confuse her when breaking line of sight, and you could often confuse her running around in the preschool or in the pantry. But every chase with spirit is a coinflip on what side of the pallet she is gonna be, that's often negated by the fact that she can see on what side you are due to the very fair mechanic she has while phasing, collidion.
---
I mean
---
Gates are open. Why wouldn‚Äôt he camp a survivor he caught during open gates?
---
Not telling you off or anything but asking why you think it‚Äôs not ok to camp when gates are open and you just caught another survivor/your only survivor.
---
Ah figures. Thank you.
---
&gt; I just wish blocking did something
---
RIP MLGA. I don't think we'll ever see a blocking feature in this game. And even something similar to "reputation" system.
---
Because leatherface makes us moist.
---
Yep,  we're talking about a community that can't decide which side is more unbalanced, it's almost like the majority of balance complaints are from people who are just bad at the game üßêü§î
---
The three killers in endgame chat: are you **toxic SWF group**?
---
3 people in the swf, one rando.
---
Got stuck endlessly vomiting.
---
&gt; why would he move on
---
To catch them, simple.
---
What if rins dad is the next survivor. All his perks make him the obsession.
---
Had a rank 2 survivor telling me killers dhouldn't have powers because they're already faster and should all be skins like survivor.
---
Lol I hope u rag him after
---
What if everyone has been hooked once and all have decisive strike? It‚Äôs happened to me before and it was quite unenjoyable.
---
This isn‚Äôt a great counter because if your on the hook and get saved and the savior has borrowed but then goes down. The killer can hook the survivor right away and then chase you. The borrowed time runs out and you go down and right onto another hook which pretty much ends the game it‚Äôs hard to come back from two hooks so close together. Also if you touch a gen to stop it regressing your DS shouldn‚Äôt cancel. If I know a survivor was just hooked I‚Äôll just leave them on the floor. It applies the same amount of pressure and allows you to patrol gens or the hooks of you hooked the rescuer.
---
The anti-DS offering
---
**i like this idea**
---
Never said it wasnt.
---
Yin‚Äôs dad bout to be here presumably, if so, spirit gonna be upset
---
Me: *ignores the survivors I hooked and focuses on the only survivor I haven‚Äôt hooked yet because of DS PTSD*

PWYF depends extremely on the Killer who it's being used with.
---
The best users for this Perk are probably Wraith and LF.
---
Wraith simply because his cloak will stop a chase immediately, getting rid of the "look onto the ground for several seconds" shizzle.
---
While Leatherface on the other hand, is the most busted Killer when it comes up to movement speed buffs. He just becomes a pain train Survivors can't do anything about because he'll almost always be able to chainsaw you with that 130% speed.
---
I forgot there were challenges in the game
---
Alright. Since you think getting better and playing something else if you don‚Äôt have fun with how other people play isn‚Äôt adequate, what is your answer then?
---
NOT WHEN IM PLAYING HIM
---
you‚Äôre the exception for not running it then. 
---
‚Äúanti tunnel‚Äù perk that lets someone get a free pass 60 seconds after unhook, where they can heal and do gens.
---
Chased all game? Adrenaline, Dead hard or Balanced, Decisive, and maybe a detection perk to find either your friends or killer easier.
---
As a killer main playing survivor I can loop pretty well but if you think I'm not going to miss every 4th skill check you're absolutely wrong old chap.
---
It worked fine for me, I had my friends 99 two gens after the one I finished and ran past them and drive by tapped them xD
---
They do... Losing points for proximity to a hooked survivor, while not in chase, or another survivor in 16 meters
---
urban evasion, Iron Will, pebble, walking, etc. all are  really reliable counters
---
That information is pretty easily accessible, and fairly anonymous. People who think they are ‚Äúleet hackers‚Äù are just trying to intimidate you. Literally just ignore and block them.
---
As far as i know only one person, can be anyone, has one obsession perk there will be one, and yeah if there is DS expect every one to have it and be surprised if they don't
---
What is your idea to fix this ‚Äúbroken‚Äù aspect then?
---
I have only balanced landing so what is the best way to get those perks
---
You say there is, but I don't think anyone else thinks so.
---
Balanced landing is a really good perk, keep it. You should level up Meg, she has 3 good perks. Based on what I see, I'd swap one of those eye perks with spine chill. You can also sometimes take resilience with a medkit, and 99% your heal and repair a gen to use the bonus. If the killer comes to you, it will take 1 second to fully heal.
---
You say that but the majority of this subreddit still thinks Ranks mean something,  which is disappointing
---
‚ÄúKillers are jerks‚Äù for also using perks = REEEE SHUT UP TOXIC SURVIVOR MAIN SCUM
---
So funny how DS was made into a completely fair perk and we STILL have morons complaining about it.
---
You should add 'rank 1 console players" to explain it
---
Yea ik but how do I upload on reddit via ps4?

Imagine still complaining about DS. You must be one of those killer players who wants survivors to start off on a hook for you.

Funny thing is with that pose and face expression jane looks like she shit her self.
---
4.4k upvotes my guy
---
Balanced landing (Nea) adrenaline (Meg) Self care (Claudette) Decisive strike (Laurie)
---
Bruh using the red puke isn't gard
---
Dude it feels so good to 360 a leatherfaces chainsaw :D
---
Yeah. They haven't done anything yet, so that's what I've done. thanks for the reply. :)
---
That's a really cool idea tbh, I'd love it
---
Level up meg and get teachable adrenaline, and landing for nea
---
But then she can just puke on you again next time she sees you, there's really no point in doing it
---
I got stuck in the middle of basement hooks once and killer couldnt kill me. (pre End game Collapse) I had to leave match, as it was unfair for killer.
---
prob just a glitch for me then you know-how this game is lol
---
My fps will be a clean 30-60 while playing him but will randomly drop to 0 right before i get the chance to lunge
---
Sadly, this game is an absolute grind fest, and will take you months to get what you want, unless you play killer with BBQ. Otherwise, level up Meg for her perks as well, they‚Äôre all good.
---
Lol I was playing wraith with agitation for the basement challenge.
---
At the end they say "lol such try hard for nothing".
---
Really? Try hard with wraith running agitation?
---
Thanks
---
Level up Meg for Adrenaline, level up Laurie for Decisive (although you may not have her owned), and David for Dead hard.
---
Also every week they update the Shrine of Secrets in the store and can be updated with perks you want.
---
I ran ruin one game and it lasted the whole 10 minutes that game was. They completed all 5 and I was left with a sad 5 hooks and one kill as Myers.
---
Is yours S or X? I have a fat and fps goes crazy everytime
---
Just so you know, you‚Äôre never going to get a reply because survivor mains don‚Äôt care that there is a trade-off
---
Yeah better answer with one word after being proven wrong in every point.
---
Pathetic
---
This happens to me pretty regularly. If you get pallet stunned it resets.
---
I know, that's not a great fix.
---
The higher the risk, the greater the reward? XD
---
Neat idea but clearly just an excuse to expose the killers location &amp; make the game easier for you
---
Your build is pretty good. If you're being chased a lot you can swap dark sens or urban for resilience. But your build is good as it is.
---
that sounds legit ngl
---
r/angryupvotes
---
Press f to pay respects
---
I think we just need a casual mode that doesn‚Äôt effect rank.
---
Ok thanks I cant tell but apparently ptb is SUPPOSED to release Tuesday according to the leaks but idk
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
I‚Äôm sure the next killer will be an envoy of the emperor himself
---
That is hilarious.
---
idk about a ptb that soon, but if it is Tuesday possibly then definitely a stream tomorrow or Saturday
---
He might have been all this time. What we see in game is a tiny pocket of the entity's world and the flow of time is completely messed up.
---
Rin as surviver plz
---
Im pretty sure its her ancestor, due to her ancestor being mentioned as wearing a "devilish mask", and in the teaser the mask was shown. Perhaps the mask was shown in First Cut because the ancestor possessed the dad, due to the Yamoka Estate being cursed
---
Not broken.  Doesn't speed up wiggle timer.  The killer just isn't blind so he can see the hooks.
---
Honestly if they just change prayer beads and give a vaulting animation then she'd be a whole lot easier to face
---
Yea it's a tough tell but leaks by daylight is usually right so I'm just going with it
---
I havent seen their latest post
---
a friend of mine is alway wondering why i only play survivor :D .... wellllll......
---
The problem is that 95% of the time I get hit with DS I hooked someone completely different before going for them.
---
Guess I should just stop being a filthy tunneler /s
---
Lightborn or Franklin's demise.
---
Seriously just get the robe. The default knife and mask are still pretty accurate.
---
It‚Äôs STBFL, not SBFL. Etc ok meme.
---
WHY PLAY SPIRIT IF YOU CANT JUST GIT GUD AT A NON LUCK BASED KILLER
---
Whatever, I play survivors only for archives yet I don't find gf difficult to spot. I just thought that sound would be a cool addition to him, for reasons I listed in another comment in that post.
---
It gives the spirit less information on where you exactly are making it to where survivors can still pull fake outs while injured without needing iron will.
---
your small yamaoka ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
It looks unfinished and sloppy. Idk. Something is off with w the coloring. 
---
But the show was pretty good. Sad there wasn‚Äôt a third season
---
Absolutely, killer should hear it too, when in proximity.
---
The drama!
---
I get 360d on hag so often because the survivor disappears after I drop to 5 fps.  Absolute garbage.
---
I would say it's more likely as a new player: your teammates are more likely to be hiding in a locker or scared of ruin. At higher ranks you're now supposed to either communicate with your teammates to get them to not do gens or hope that they don't do anything. Neither of those feels great to me.
---
All spirit needs changed it remove spirit beads and give her a vault animation and she's good
---
Yea they leaked ptb date
---
This is the second time trapper is required as the killer. I was hoping they‚Äôd switch it up this time for who was required
---
well i hope its soon, this seems to go by fast
---
Me too lol
---
No it‚Äôs still a guessing game. Ofc you know they‚Äôre injured and in the area or you wouldn‚Äôt be phasing already lmfao you‚Äôre just making it so that she has to guess now
---
And a pallet stun causes her to lose it, as well.
---
No, he wasn‚Äôt driven to insanity by the Entity, though I can see why you thought that‚Äôs what I said. Rather, similarly to the Wraith, he caught its interest after brutally murdering someone.
---
Probably the most useless offering in the game.
---
That is what I‚Äôm doing. I enjoy the guessing game. I want both sides to have equal information.
---
Well if you take a look at the lore page of the rift, trapper is the only killer there with lore, so
---
All ass is enough.
---
~ Sincerely, Feng/Ash main
---
im pretty sure its the first ancestor mentioned in the lore, due to the fact that the ancestor wore a "devilish" mask, and when the father brought dishonor, an "old anger was awakened".
---
So manly!
---
Dadam
---
1. Pips literally mean nothing. 
---
2. Blame your teammates. If he is camping, they should have been ALL over the gens , not you. When he sees three or four gens pop fast, it‚Äôll scare him into patrolling instead.
---
Lol you got baited. There is no new map coming. Have you even looked at the roadmap ? https://deadbydaylight.com/images/roadmap/roadmap_year4.jpg
---
Hahahahahahahaha!!
---
###Ahahahahahahahahaha!!!
---
I feel like you‚Äôre just saying this to cover your ass, but it‚Äôs consistent so whatever
---
Neat
---
is there a way i can read the lore because theres no way i can do it  bc im bad;-;
---
You got some problems, man.
---
Hit boxes have been wonky with dedicated servers. I notice them more as a survivor for some reason.
---
The only thing someone could ever do with your IP address is track you to a certain state (maybe city if they are smart enough) or over load your router for a couple minutes.
---
Nothing beats the original mask
---
*Every* non-licensed killer has released simultaneously with a survivor.  So I think the point being made is the theory that the killer will be an ancestor/oni/mask demon and the survivor will be the father.
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt think they will, but I‚Äôd love the father as a survivor (though I‚Äôd be disappointed if he were a killer).  Several of the killers, when their lore is explained, are sympathetic/innocent/good people at heart before the entity twisted them.  I‚Äôd like to see one of the survivors be a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù as well.  The entity doesn‚Äôt care about your morality, just how good a killer you‚Äôd make.
---
That's a real hero right there.
---
Boomstick and chainsaw.
---
He sacrificed himself PepeHands
---
Iron will nullify stridor, I have try it

Now that is the purest definition of a bruh moment

‚ÄúThis is the last of my Hamon, Kate! Take it from me!‚Äù

Yea I'm not doing that challenge. The bloodpoints/rift/tome is not worth playing that toxic.

"impossible"

yet you did it huh?
---
Oh we're really getting a Lord Himuro
---
Read Steel Ball Run
---
You should be able to use them next year as well, so it‚Äôs not a total waste.

If you're laughing, it means you aren't a good player, just saying... üëÄ
---
Ebony mori intesifies.
---
You‚Äôre... on console?
---
Nice job including 7 survivors. I especially like your design on Claudette.
---
Xbox?
---
I would be okay with it but only if they also integrated PC controls as well to the console.
---
Nah i feel ya, i dont mind xbox to ps4 or even switch but i dont want to vs pc players unless im on pc
---
If you're being down-voted, that means you're wrong. Just saying.
---
Hell yeah! You back-lash those toxic whiny survivor mains!
---
Shush
---
We do not need to hear you opinion
---
Same happened, with same characters. I got off my second hook, stalked to full by GF for the second time. A Claudette with no hooks body blocked me so I couldn‚Äôt take the vault out. Whenever I see anything like that or shitty internet I grab them and let them go because it‚Äôs a big mood. A feng pallet me, but also made me down a Steve. He dc‚Äôed and the Feng got mori‚Äôd. Afterwards me and the Kate who were lagging talked and people were trying to stream into her inbox with parties and messages.
---
I can confirm as a survivor who faced a hag last night that this is busted
---
I don't like the idea to play against PC god nurses on ps4. Crossplay between consoles would be really cool
---
The problem is other people rushing it basically means your team is throwing the game lol. The throw 15 pallets while in a chase meant every team member wasted pallets if the killer so much as glanced at them lol. Being at rank reset doesn't help anything either.
---
That's not what this is.  The survivor would start the trial as normal and then be possessed by the Oni.  That would cause the possessed survivor to transform into the killer.  The killer would then have control of that survivors body, putting them into a sort of spectator position until they were able to get back control of their body.
---
Myers has a very big problem early game, since he is slow AF in tier 1 and has to stalk people for a while till he can become a regular 115% killer. Experienced survivors will usually spot him and make sure to break line of sight, therefore keeping him locked in tier 1 for a long time, which guarantees that 2-3 gens will pop by the time he hits tier 2. Therefore you really need Ruin and/or Corrupt Intervention to help buy time while you are at your most vulnerable. He is definitely far below Nurse, Billy and Spirit tier, and IMO below Hag, Huntress, Freddy and Demogorgon too.
---
Hehe fix spelung to beee fanneh hehe funny spelking naratzi
---
Deaf boys ear seems to work better
---
You're probably right
---
Can you make a bush for Claudette I would love to see her face peeking out of a bush. I feel it would make the already cute doll into a more cute doll
---
Beautiful execution
---
This is such a nice reply thank you! Im not giving up yet! :)
---
"Game Over."
---
Holy fk your hands are having a seizure??  Are you alright? xd
---
One simple feature so everyone can be happy have a option to go against console only players or all players!
---
Yeah, it sucks. On some loops it can give you a hit if the survivor plays it badly, but usually it doesn‚Äôt do much.
---
Hmm, that could work i suppose
---
You‚Äôre the one who chooses to react to it. Not my fault you let a picture control your emotions.
---
People will just git gud with other killers and then you will call for nerf on the next and the next
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/entitledsurvivors/comments/dlszhe/countering_the_survivors_perks_is_the_definition/

---
pain noise w/ Stridor: 150% along with 125% healthy breathing
---
pain noise w/ Stridor + Iron will: 50% along with STILL 125% regular breathing
---
If Spirit has Stridor she is still capable of easily hearing you whether you have Iron Will or not, with the addition of hearing you easier while healthy as well.
---
Oh I'm excited to. It should be pretty cool. I love the spirit btw dont get me wrong lmao.
---
Yeah, even outside of loops, it just feels like total RNG. I hear the whoosh, and stand the fuck still behind a rock or something waiting until I can see her again...and welp, she wasn't going to look behind the rock, but she did happen to be passing by and against any other killer I just move around the rock to obscure myself from them and easily hide, against her I'm now easily spotted.
---
Basic traversal across the map for her exposes survivors *by accident* all the time.
---
A good strategy I have sadly it only works for people who get their first P3 and rarely upgrade other survivors. It's to get the survivor to P3 and get all available perks to level 3 then go back and start getting the teachables you want so you can get them in your bloodweb without the hassle of waiting.
---
Well did you know that switching to Geico could save you 15% or more on car insurance?

Agreed although ebony is more op.

It‚Äôs not about using or not using it, it‚Äôs about it NOT working as intended.
---
Do you own Reddit?
---
Umm... go watch scorpionz and get back to me on that "useless" ambush... I just dont think your using it for its intended purpose.
---
The ambush literally ignores small/mid loops making them free hits, which every kill other than nurse has to deal with these loops and you tell me her ambush mechanic is useless.
---
Get this rank 20 pishposh outta here and go watch some scorpionz to achieve the gud.
---
The problem is that this sub has a lot of low ranking players, as well as mostly survivor mains. The only time I feel that I have the power role is as Spirit or Ghostface (barring things like insta-saw Billy, iri heads etc)
---
&gt; Change the ranking system for survivors
---
I want to agree with this, but the current matchmaking system punishes high ranks tremendously. At rank 1 survivor (in the EU at least), queue times are taking 5-10 minutes. If they actually prevented people that don't deserve it from hitting red ranks, queue times would take even longer.
---
You can turn much faster with a mouse, that alone makes a big difference.
---
You also do not lose save the best for last tokens if you chainsaw your Obsession
---
Perk on the left, Franklin's Demise: Hit a survivor, they drop the item (The lost Item is damaged in the fall, losing 0/5/10 % of its base amount of charges.)
---
Middle perk, Lightborn: Resistance to Blindness is increased by 60/70/80 %.
---
And last but not least, Save the best for last: For every now and then
---
What a beautiful world we could live in
---
I honestly enjoy when my survivors have decisive because not only does it give survivors.a bit more of a.chance (especially if your a.good killer) it makes it to where I get a bit more of a chase with a really fun survivor. Most of the times I'm learning how to loop by having survivors.loop me, so it adds more time to learn. (It's also absolutely hilarious when they do it and think they can get away. Same with flashlighters)
---
Remind yourself than playing one shot killers or similar (Myers, chainsaw killers, plague...) severely affects your pip ability, since there will be less chases &amp; less time spent injured.
---
If you wanna double pip with these killers, consider using basic m1 attacks if you're ahead in the game
---
Don‚Äôt save right in front of me
---
Trapping 4 survivors is not overly challenging and the time in general is not ‚Äúbeyond insane‚Äù in difficulty. Give me a break
---
Its area of effect and "body block" isnt full proof ... you needa place it correctly on order for survivors yo be unable to go around.
---
Do you know if it‚Äôs possible on console?
---
Thank you!!!
---
Found the rank 20 lmao
---
You can see Level 3 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvsyuu/tome_i_level_3_tasks/
---
Dash is not for ambushing near the gens, it's for loops
---
According to their post history, Reddit doesn't really tolerate them in general.
---
I really like it tbh
---
I‚Äôve been fortunate not to run into a lobby like that yet; that sounds awful. Lol. It makes sense how the tome hunting can ruin a game for everyone, whether or not you‚Äôre going for them. Again, I think it‚Äôs just an innate problem with most battle passes found in any game. :/
---
O rlly? How? Because the last two days have been people screaming about Spirit 2.0

But okay.

I guess ‚Äúno u‚Äù is actually devastating. Nice job.
---
They learn someday.
---
Maybe I'm just blind then, because when I pause the clip he misses his swing and is still outside the pallet, on the outer edge of the doorway, then the pallet is thrown and he zoots into the shack through it.
---
I'm okay with challenges for trapper even if I don't use him normally that's fine chance to try something new.
---
Grinding challenges like earn 200k BP or drop 15 pallets etc... are fine I don't care if it takes me half a dozen or more trials to do one.
---
The part I do have a problem with are the luck based/situational challenges.
---
This tome isn't too bad at all wait until you see level 4... things like kill all 4 survivors in basement or multiple safe unhooks in the endgame stuff that rarely ever happens if at all.
---
The challenges should rely on hoping to run into a situation should be able to be grinded or something that happens during normal gameplay using a certain killer, survivor or perk.

So how about get over it... do the challenges... and get rewarded.

Saying it cant be helped is a terrible attitude to have, anything can be helped with effort. A simple nerf idea that allows you to still play with your friends is a stacking debuff to action speed for each swf to gen repair healing and sabotaging. There are ways to deal with the problem but BHVR doesn't want to. They certainly won't please high rank killers by restricting their options by nerfing the viable ones.
---
Thanks for the advice, it was a little bit snotty the way you passed the advice over to me  but il still check out the video anyway. 
---
üôà
---
The map looks really cool but if you are playing survivor you might as well just stand there and let the killer down you if you are found cause every single pallet on the map is extremly unsafe.
---
Can someone explain the hype behind PWYF as Bubba please?
---
Obviously i can see how going fast helps, what i cant see is how a killer who struggles mightily in chases to being with, has pretty much no mobility, can afford to waste time losing 3 chases (even with proxy chasing this takes a lot of time) when survivors will just split up and bang gens.
---
Gore isn't an integral element of horror, period. It's appreciated as a subgenre, but that's not the only part to it at all (cough cough, psychological horror, tension to climax, uncanny elements).
---
Ah thanks üôè
---
oh shit really. damn then yeah there needs to be something. she feels so frustrating because i domt die due to my faults. i just guessed wrong
---
Tbh I had several games as a killer where bps are spent, only for the survivors to massivelely gen rush and exit with very little points.
---
I don't like noed, but again, cleansing totems is something to do, instead of purely rushing. Also, when you're new to the game and don't have teachables, noed is actually one of the most decent shared perks one can pick.
---
Better luck next time
---
Almost done with tome. I hope they make it harder.
---
Yea, from what i can see from videos it seems PC sensitivity is dependent on how fast you move your hand/the mouse, while on console once you get used to 100% sensitivity, too bad thats as fast as it gets.
---
Scorpionz is the best pig player to ever draw breath, arguably the best killer player in general and tell me if her ambush is useful after watching him win at rank 1 over and over without crutch perks or addons shitty killer players use to cover up their lackluster gameplay mistakes.
---
Nothing bad can come from his gameplay.
---
Really? xD I tried to make a joke but what I said was true... Nice xD
---
I dont think DS needs anymore nerfs. Its already really situational. I find myself not really using it in like 90% of my games when I have it equipped.
---
There was a third season, Scream Resurrection, it just wasn't connected to anything prior.
---
Damn that's evil!
---
Yup, didn't know those things but that's kinda what I thought just by the teaser imagining what I would do if I had to write it
---
Still, those info are very useful! Thanks, good to know
---
Welcome to pallet town choose your starter killer

God tier perk against tunneling mongoloids

You only have to be on the gen when it pops. Dont have to do the full gen by yourself.

It's better than the hospital imo

Wow, this tome is really making a lot of ppl cry.
---
What the point in removing moris if tombstone myres and devour hope exists and also some other Mori perk or add on?
---
Replace it with Haddonfield
---
Otzdarva wants to know your location
---
I‚Äôll check their schedule in the forums and see if it says anything. But I don‚Äôt think there is one
---
Scare them away and they will leave. But if you have BBQ you can get 1200BPS for 2 hits if a surv lets you hit them (EZ EZ points imo), which is a nice thing, isnt it? I get punished for it, though, so I guess a standard tbag will do from now on. No one cares anyways lol
---
That was quite dramatic.
---
Last time I used that add ons was years ago cause I dont use trash.
---
Becuase tombstone myers and devour hope actually have requirements you have to fullfill. And these requirements are pretty difficult. Tombstone myers has to stalk survivors for a VERY long time. And devour has to somehow stay alive for half of the game. A mori just requires you to hook someone which is your goal anyway.
---
How did you remove the HUD?
---
I play on ps4 and there isn't any dedicated servers yet for console
---
Who even run self care anymore? It‚Äôs all about that inner strength
---
JOJO! TAKE THE LAST OF MY HAMON!
---
Yeah that two makes it more of a mind game on the pallets for her as well making it more of a 25% chance that you'll get hit
---
Derpface
---
Oh jesus
---
Im already red ranks both, hitting rank 1 tonight with swf group. Will hit rank 1 killer this weekend. 
---
Its easy.
---
Nobody cares.
---
When you have balanced landing its pretty good and not all pallet just the hallway ones
---
Seriously, just leave, don‚Äôt wait for them. It‚Äôs because survivors tbag at the gate I assume none of them mean well.
---
OOooh the sweet rank reset...
---
Yesterday i just literally ran around the map in circle unhooking and healing everyone, looking for ruin. It was hilarious. Literally, clockwise, around, unhook heal, onto the next hook. Even the killer caught up with what was happening, sent me a message "lol wtf, your tm8's haven't touched a gen yet, and dropped every single pallet around, imma let you get one gen at the end so you'd have some points apart altruism lol". I mean it's not killers fault, so i don't blame him. He didn't camp, or tunnel. They were running around like cockroaches dropping pallets lol
---
My mans got whooped from both ends
---
SWF bullies? Bring a mori, rancor, devour hope and noed. Enjoy.
---
Damn son!
---
*cries in wanting 2v8 mode*
---
i just edited this in PS..wish they would add the feature to remove HUD ingame tho
---
Unrelated and  I doubt it would ever be possible but Richtofen would be a fantastic survivor...
---
Instead of #teamtrees it should be #teamwazzaa
---
It's also why gen grabs only work about 30% of the time.
---
Gotta love how its a Tome challenge now too!
---
I always leave if others arent in danger. I just wait to make sure i can save them/die so they can leave. I dont wait just for the killer lol
---
Well if the company that made the original mask made that one too, then we'll get it.
---
Im sure they'll announce it on their official Discord server if they are planning to do a dev stream today.
---
Oh, good job! I wish they added that too!
---
Watching FunGoose on twitch helped me alot. He also has a YouTube channel you can check out.
---
Most people dont run balanced. And no every single pallet is unsafe. I have experienced that as survivor and killer. Or maybe there is some unknown super safe pallet i dont know about but i doubt that.
---
Indeed, my good sir!

i wore a halloween costume similar to it except the mask was traded for a black see through face with red glowing eyes
---
Mine did.
---
Brother it's a garbage add on that has no reason for existence you use it for the extra BP it gives and maybe a meme build.
---
If its bugged who cares it's not a game win or losing difference
---
No... no its not... an escape is the cherry on top to aim for. The objective is to Pip
---
Yah whatever the killer is it probably going to a p**ssed of killer and it probably going to be scary I have hope it‚Äôs something like this it a big orgre so it a Asian shrek
---
"Dont slug" "Dont Tunnel" "i got DS so ima run at the killer real quick"
---
Did you even look at the meme
---
I play with low lighting.
---
There's that moment when they drop a pallet and just sit there because you're not moving either, and then they remember, oh, right, Myers.
---
When her wooshing was directional, she waa too easy to beat. People keep forgetting that.
---
Hell yeah!
---
I think moris/keys should be removed at the same time as they are similar in that they‚Äôre kinda cheesy. 
---
You‚Äôre totally right though that devour/tombstone should stay because they have requirements that aren‚Äôt super easy like just hooking someone.
---
I honestly think they should take moris out and just give you the option to mori the last survivor if you catch them during EGC since they‚Äôre not getting away anyway unless you let them, since I get that some people still want to be able to kill survivors.
---
Japan is big on blood superstitions, particularly blood types.
---
So maybe the Yamaoka family had an oni ancestor, so they all have some degree of oni in their blood which began to manifest in the father when he went apeshit.

'old author was racist and we have to bring this up everytime someone discusses his works as if it makes any difference' - and other exciting tales

That doesnt even make sense... I dont see why this would make it fun for the survivors.
---
I care. Winning is not the only fun for me and when there is a bug, it should be fixed.
---
Remember when her wooshing was directional? There's a reason they changed that.
---
It was interesting, but very weird.
---
If you think that dedicated servers are bad on DBD, play any shooter game on roblox. You‚Äôre gonna suffer more
---
They shouldnt be removed just make it so they can only open the hatch when the exit gates are powered.
---
They never do streams on Fridays or Saturdays. If the PTB is next Tuesday the stream will need to be today.
---
Then don't run right at me after you're unhooked trying to bait me. I'm seeing a lot more of that happening lately which is pretty fucked up.
---
2PM Eastern maybe?
---
‚Äúbroken‚Äù perk. There fixed it for you

This would work if the devs are afraid of the animations going mostly to waste.

Same here. Tbh I think that'd be the only ghostface I'd see in game at that point.

DS3 already lasts 60 seconds
---
It's only bugged when paired with waterlogged shoe... or rusty shackles anyway. Niche thing to complain about for a known issue from the devs.
---
I don‚Äôt think it was soaking up the blood. It looked like it was going in reverse, especially if you look at the smoke from the extinguished candles.
---
I personally love getting morid lol. It's alot cooler than dying on a hook. That 5 stack devour hag mori is iconic.
---
i did, where is the Dead By Daylight
---
Except that Legion's button is garbage, and people will still complain about this. Because "feedback on her power" to most survivors means "I get to win whenever I want". 
---
The bitching will never end.
---
This is not true. You have to complete the equivalent of 3 full gens.
---
I did 2.5 gens (was there for all 3 popping) and it did not complete.
---
I did over 3 gens worth of work, but only actually was there for 1 popping, and I completed the challenge.
---
The most important quality is that it looks silly, but it‚Äôs mostly just context sensitive, have fun with it and react however makes sense with it.

Like people who DC because they don't like the killer or addon they're facing?

Vault animation is literally her gimmick. Go fuck yourself with that. I'm fine with phasing collision but people need to stop with this vault shit.
---

BRUH the objective is to escape the pip is not in ANY way an objective
---
Lol
---
Guy in the bottom pic of this always reminded me of the CGI Denton from Deus Ex.
---
Maybe it's worse on ps4. I like the challenges but my team has for sure been going strictly for the challenge. Self care over taking we'll make it fast heals, getting in a chase and throwing down every pallet they encounter, killers camping basement etc.
---
If nurse just wins, why doesn't everyone play her? Or do you think a difficult to use character should have no reward?
---
This community is straight bollocks
---
You sound so optimal
---
Should be fair game to get a killer on PC. PC would have the advantage so if you're on console and really wanted to play with your friends on PC then the survivors should be at the disadvantage not the killer
---
Out played!
---
NGL though I found him randomly and he was talking over and over about this perk. I was like fine, fuck it. I'm gonna run this shit and contest a hook or two once I get 6+ stacks
---
Whelp, I love this perk now.
---
I love the way he sees the game literally ignoring all survivor rules and slugging when they make super high altruism plays and guarding gens aggressive as hell when they're trying to rush
---
It doesn't, but if you hit the end of the timer, it won't go off in a box
---
I'm gonna laugh if it is rins dad and he comes in to nerf her in the most brutal way possible. Omeganerfs
---
So she loses collision with survivors while phasing and prayer beads be made an ultra rare as well as be given a downside. What else would be required for the crying to stop? Because honestly, every time a killer "overperforms" they get nerfed into the ground and abandoned by the killer community. Since the devs count protest disconnects as kills.
---
I'm also surprised to see people preferring to play against nurse vs spirit since I get nothing but hate every time I play nurse. Confirmation bias is a hell of a drug.
---
Selfcare isn't horrible. Its situational, and had its uses if used intelligently.
---
I just don't get what people are so scared about honestly. If they nail it right they could just enable keyboard and mouse on consoles and then introduce INPUT based matchmaking where controller players (yes even controller players on PC) against other controller players, kb+m users vs kb+m users and mixed lobbies with mixed lobbies problem solved for the most part.
---
no they didn't, that would be at the beginning of the round, but you can clearly tell from the already hooked person it ain't the beginning
---
Is that new? Because I've died on a box before
---
*The hell you ain‚Äôt*
---
Adda ni ka dingir asar ku me
---
This is very true.
---
There goes my hero...WATCH HIM AS HE GOES!
---
Yes that makes sense. Hopefully they integrate an option to matchmake with all players, or opt to matchmake with same-platform only.
---
Just leave. If you get picked up at the exit gate it is 100% your own fault. When I play killer I don't care about the extra bloodpoints and just want the survivors to leave but if I down one because they were stupid enough to get caught I'm going to hook them.
---
This thing looks like a spooky sex mask.
---
More people are playing her nowadays. That's really it. Whenever a decently strong killer gets popular, survivors immediately get sick of it since it represents an actual threat. They will pull out that old chestnut of "unfun" as if losing is fun for anyone.
---
Ever notice how that the killers survivors find to be "fun to play against" are also weak as fuck? I'm just waiting for them to start hating Ghostface again like they did during his PTB.
---
Incredible.
---
Mistakes were made.

i turned down Nurses 3 last night for BBQ 3 on Ghostface, he's only level 42 and i just flat out cannot say no to BBQ 3 ever. It's so much goddamn points. Add that to all the survivor puddings i'm getting whilst levelling and i'm getting (idk if its 200% or multiplicative or whatever) a lot of bp
---
Glad someone else spotted the irony of the 'no background png'
---
Could use some overwhelming presence
---
Yes, the tree is obviously trying to leaf the trial.
---
I think it's due to the text at the bottom. It will say "place portal" whenever you are able to. But usually in a chase you will be going around corners and places where a portal cannot be placed. So it's alternating really quickly between no text and text
---
killers should learn how ineffective camping becomes once they start ranking up and facing competent survivors.
---
Half the time when people do that it‚Äôs to mock the killer from my experience. They always insult me by crouch spamming at gate then snap at me for hooking them, never mentioning anything about giving me a free hit for points. And I really have no reason to let them go most of the time unless I got an easy 3k or more than 1 person DC‚Äôd.
---
As a survivor in these scenarios I never struggle because I let them run up and swing at me while I wait at the very edge of the gate exit, facing said gate exit.
---
you did tbag the killer multiple times, didn‚Äôt deserve to escape
---
I also watched the video but could it not be Rin's father resurrected as an Oni perhaps? His evil, twisted soul became a demonic one when he passed?
---
Remove collision during phasing. Leave her vaulting animation alone.
---
Jake crawled so that Steve could run
---
That's basically word for word parroting from a youtube video. While that dude isn't exactly wrong theres also her collision while phasing that needs to be addressed as well. You shouldn't be able to body block loops while phasing or just arbitrarily bump into people while doing so either. It makes sense when wraith does it because he's still physically on the field of play. When you phase you fuck off into the ghost realm leaving only your husk behind so you're not physically on the same plane as the survivors while your phasing. 
---
Remove phase collision and revert the change that was made of no phase sounds around the husk and she'll be alright to play against. At least someone will have a chance at surviving for longer than 2 seconds in a chase.
---

I'm not afraid to die here. But I am a proud member of the Tapp family. So you see, it's in my blood. Something like this might mean absolutely nothing to a demented and inhuman monster like you. My father didn't recognize me, but he sacrificed his life to save mine anyway. My grandfather gave his Hamon energy to save Steve's grandfather, right before he died. It's tradition, I have to do something. I can't let my life's flame, just flatter out to darkness. This the Tapp family spirit! Handed down from the past to ensure the family's future! It's the human spirit! Steve! This is the last of my Hamon! Take it from me!
---
Glitch? Like turn the killer? You have to be on custom games/kyf
---
I would just say try it before you say its unfair though. You just seem dead set on how unfair it'll be to play with pc players. l play gears of war on my pc against console players i don't have an advantage imo it feels fair to me . i dont do any better then the ppl on xbox. Having more ppl to play against isn't a bad thing so at least there's a bright side right ?
---
No, because some like the pig aren't directly related to any movie or at least that what I think, the one from Amanda is a bit weird to be honest
---
Me and you both
---
There are two safe pallets in one of the long junk rooms filled with boxes and shelves with stairs that you can walk up.
---
Tapp!!!!
---
Your math is wrong. If one lobby out of 100 blocks killer, his pool of survivors for queuing is 1% less, not 75%
---
You aren‚Äôt understanding the frustration about playing against her. You can disagree with the changes they are proposing, but are you denying the lack of feedback and guess work that comes with playing against her?
---
Yes, that was her original design, but so was Legions to be able to stab someone 32 times to death. The Devs don‚Äôt make good initial premises many times.
---
Obviously, the Killer is the power role so the onus for every problem is on them. Genrushing isn't real, they need to apply more pressure as one character with limited movement outside of the Big 4. SWFs don't have an unfair adantage just run Ruin, but never NOED. You're scum if you run NOED. Adrenaline is different.
---
Of course, it's not everyone, but that's what I think of when the term "Survivor MAINS" comes up.
---
Did Steve escape? Was your sacrifice not in vain?
---
Thing is unsafe pallets are useless unless you get the stun. But most killers run enduring.
---
Having more people to play with is absolutely the best thing that could come from this, with less wait time between games. Definitely a bright side there
---
I've seen stranger things with this game happening
---
Yeah ik what I mean is it only lasts the 60 seconds OR until your fully healed
---
Americana denim jeans do
---
I like them they give me more bloodpoints and so far I haven't had to throw a single killer game and I'm halfway through level 2
---
Go save yourselves I‚Äôm a goner!
---
Its a multiplayer with human players, they do human things that arent always optimal. Would you complain if its a bubba guarding a chest in the basement? You wont be able to play the game as well since there is no killer. The deal is, its not always like that and sometimes you get the short end of the stick. 
---
If you put all things in the survivors handbook you get a farming game. Go ahead play killer and 2 hook each survivor without hooking the same person last time. See if you get "wow fair killer" instead of "gg ez"
---
lmao delusional. That is literally what the post is you fucking damp sock
---
See, now that would be interesting. Right now the Entity is godmoding everything, but other beings with similar levels of power would add a bit of conflict.
---
He did! The only one of us to make it out.
---
That's what I mean unless the devs don't understand the concerns have about kb+m then yeah it could be a bit bad.
---
The only people who think that "don't tunnel" is the solution to dealing with DS are survivors who never play killer. 60 seconds is too long. The timer on DS should just end if another survivor gets hooked. Im a survivor main by the way, but also play enough killer to know its just really annoying.
---
It looks like a Hannya mask, which is used in Noh theatre to represent female demons.
---
That pallet isnt safe becuase there is only one exit. If you run in there you are trapping yourself.
---
I would prefer it to be related to her father for lore reasons, but I'm excited for the new killer either way!
---
A game hypothesis. A theory is tested, validated, and proven.
---
You probably still have time to get to another pallet before the killer hits you though.

I think I know why! Doesn't borrowed time also give survivors the Deep Wound effect? Maybe you downed some survivors with borrowed time and that's why it counted it :) hope I helped

Borrowed time and styptics/syringes gives "endurance" which make it so that if they're injuried and hit, instead of being downed they get "deep wound" status, that's why you get progress even though you don't have legion

I get to post the exact same meme next
---
i insta bought it and i mean they gonna fix it soon and it isn‚Äôt that annoying to play with so fuck it xd
---
It‚Äôs meant to look funny that‚Äôs it
---
And that‚Äôs where the line needs to be drawn. Making Spirit have even a tiny bit of feedback is enough because in her current state the survivor is just flipping a coin to get lucky. It‚Äôs not engaging to either side because you‚Äôre playing a a game where you have all the cards but one and you get to see your opponents hand. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt need to be so extreme that Spirit has no options but if she makes the wrong choice she should at the least get punished for it. Even something as simple as ‚Äúshe is forced to make a specific pose and noise when using the power‚Äù or ‚Äúshe lights up like a Christmas tree when she activates it‚Äù is enough to put the remainder of the pressure on the survivor to take that read and adjust. They can still misread the remainder of her action afterwards but they at least have something to work with. 
---
Also Iri Button is Legion‚Äôs best addon. Among their only good ones anyway which are like 5 tops.
---
She hasn't been buffed, but Nurse was nerfed out of the meta so now Spirit appears over twice as frequently and people who lose at high ranks can mathematically almost only lose to her as a result.
---
And they don't like losing.
---
Nurse got reworked (read. nerfed) and now Spirit is the strongest killer. 
---
This sub consists out of 2 things which are whining about the strongest killer/perks and memes. Spirit is now numero uno so que whining about her being OP.
---
Yeah as if walking and hiding will work all game Sprit can still easy catch up to you even if you are walking because you won't make much distance.
---

---
Lucky. At least you got into a game
---
There is a difference between nerf and balance. 
---
Nurse was not balanced. She is better now. 
---
Spirit is not balanced. She is not OP, just cheap.

I think OP wasn't playing in the spirit of the game personally

---
Bro I‚Äôve seen you comment on a last post with a similar energy. I agree with to an extent of what you‚Äôre saying, but stop projecting bro.
---
Allows you to loop the killer for 20 minutes
---
But everyone also whines about Doctor and Legion, and they're low-tier.
---
Like, the "fun" Killers also aren't allowed any slowdown mechanics. Wraith and Clown, but I heard people DC against pinky Clown so also nothing that gives Exposed ever. Actually, just bring back Self-Care being faster than Killer hit cooldowns and I think people will love it.

Hex: No0b3
---
Your eyes become sunken in the back of your head and you fov is 100% wider. You also mildy resemble a sex toy. When the hex is destroyed, you return to normal.
---
Nah. Plague with myers mori. Shoving her incense burner into you instead of a knife.
---
Damn.
---
Wait how can spirit mori without consent? You just mean rancor? But then doesn't hag count with devour hope?
---
Killers are morally obligated to concede one escape.
---
Survivors are morally obligated to absolutely nothing, even after bullying.
---
Not to mention you don‚Äôt know which way to walk.
---
Don't go out of your way to prevent people from completing their challenges, there's no reason for that.

---
I'm not excited about it, unless Xbox allows the use of a keyboard and mouse in lieu of a controller. I still think frame rate will be a major issuee though. 
---
Wouldn't say no to console crossplay though. My wife wants to try playing with me, and I have all three consoles, I just don't want to buy another Xbox to play with her, i'd rather buy a PS4 copy or a switch copy.
---
Posted the same thing three times
---
He has a point, though.
---
Shhhhhhhhh
---
Nice one.
---
I think it's even worst because at least your mom is often told ironically
---
So this guy gets to be a tunnel digger and Steve doesn‚Äôt? Cool art though
---
Sorry, Nurse is still better.  You just can‚Äôt cheese the 3 blinks like you could before. A highly skilled nurse is still just as lethal, if not more from the addon rework.
---
How am i supposed to make use of the unsafe pallets?
---
Nope. Only held hostage if you trapped them and went to work, leaving them there for hours. Survivors can trigger egc and move on. You played smart in the situation.
---
*Hero  from nikleback plays in the background*
---
They already make Michael Myers grunt in pain, because shooting out his eyes does nothing but a little wood to the knees is beyond even his tolerance.
---
I checked the killer's build after he rage quit shortly after and it was indeed Ruin. These totem spawns are honestly ridiculous.
---
from the logical reasons provided video i think most likely its the first yamoaka
---
That Prayer Beads change is interesting. A lot like that one add on for Wraith.
---
Either way, Oni are dope, gonna be a fun killer!
---
How to spot a survivor main xD
---
Myers with plague Mori. 
---
Vommy Daddy.
---
I love how the first two people were like ‚Äúomg this is so broken!!1!‚Äù 
---
If anything it would be a useless meme add-on. Which I‚Äôm all about btw
---
Guys I've never played shape I don't get it
---
Here‚Äôs an old (but not outdated) tutorial ScottJund made early 2018, he‚Äôs a Huntress main with over 1000 hours on Huntress alone, I used this video to help me out when I was starting.
---
Some quick tips you may want though:
---
Don‚Äôt spam hatchets: It‚Äôs a much smarter decision to hold onto hatchets and be careful with your aim, throwing them ASAP means you aren‚Äôt predicting what the survivor is going to do so they can easily juke it out, holding it means the hatchet gets thrown faster giving survivors less time to react to a mobile hatchet.
---
Don‚Äôt follow survivors with your aim: it‚Äôs better to not move your camera when holding a hatchet, survivors will generally try to go left and right in attempts to juke your hatchet, after swinging to one side they‚Äôll typically juke back into the middle of your screen which can land you a free hit.
---
Melee Hatchets: Don‚Äôt use your hatchets at range, instead you‚Äôll want to get right next to the survivor for an easier hit, then you can follow that first hit up with a normal attack after the short cool down that comes with hatchets.
---
Hope this helps and good luck, she can be a tough one to play.
---
Lol when i was a rank 19 and didn't know how to loop i thought wraith was opü§£ he's arguably the worst killer in the game.
---
Imagine a BHVR event when players can submit maps and other fan content for a chance of it being added. Maybe have a community vote and add the top two killers, survivors, and maps as a big update for the anniversary.
---
I had the exact same problem last night it was odd because it took my XP and when I fixed it I didn't receive the XP.
---
Myers doing Demogorgon's Mori. Fingered and vored
---
You did not deserve that escape.
---
Oh god no.
---
&gt;Exclusive Cosmetics for all players
---
Can I get an F in the chat for dumbasses who bought these from eBay?
---
Myers moves pretty fast when nobody's looking.
---
Man I feel bad for the people who spent 400 bucks on those cosmetics on eBay like Golden Feng, lol.
---
I‚Äôm happy that everybody will get a chance to use some of them but I would be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt a bit sad that the event items we grinded so much for are just available to everyone now, I rarely ever saw another David on PS4 with the jacket
---
No...?
---
Ahahah sometimes when I play killer I press shift to run.. all match. :|
---
I thought NOED only gives speed boost when all gens are done
---
Hag would, but Devour hope is always cleansed before 5 stacks.
---
Original xbox one, not an S or an X
---
They do mention that Tome 4 is hard and they want it to be hard but they must be out of their minds if they think some of the Tome 4 challenges are possible.
---
Awesome
---
Nobody is spouting that bullshit. All I'm saying is maybe don't hate a single player out of the game for the crime of choosing to be unhooked in an unsafe manner.
---
Time to hear a whole bunch of salty killer mains complain, I‚Äôm one myself and I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre right but... time to watch that all go down &gt;:)
---
Cant 360 your way out of everything
---
They 99% the gate lol they had a chance to leave.
---
Imagine Myers stretching his mouth over a survivors head and tearing it around
---
Lol, yeah, worth a shot though
---
Spirit's universal changes are just removing collision while phasing and giving her a vault animation which survivors  can see. Both totally fair.
---
Prayer beads being changed from no phasing sound to a global phasing sound seems like a reasonable change. It functions the same way as far as giving the survivors no indication that you're phasing near them while also giving the survivors a chance to get away.
---
Spirit will still be arguably the best killer in the game, it will just be more fun for survivors to play against her/it won't feel completely unfair to play against her.
---
If you look closely he is actually the player being facecamped
---
and once you're in a chase???? what do you do
---
DCs aren't rampant? Tell that to survivors and a spoopy myers. They disconnect faster than you can say michael myers.
---
Can someone copy it? Site is blocked on mobile. Thanks
---
Mods
---
Holy fuck this community is utterly impossible to please in any capacity and completely insufferable. God you fuckers just suck
---
Ugh I still remember that Quentin who was tbagging in a pallet at me stalking.
---
Needless to say, that dude was downed before throwing a palled down and disconnected before I was able to pick him up.
---
Shhh, we don't talk about that here
---
I, for one, am happy.
---
No not really. A lot of people who play this game are really salty or toxic. Happens regardless of how the game goes
---
People have spend thousands of dollars on exclusives. This is actually sad that they are doing this
---
These are really nice changes, thankfully they didn‚Äôt butcher her like they did to Legion. I know these changes won‚Äôt satisfy everyone but I hope it‚Äôll at least ease the current spike in hate towards her.
---
Nah, I'm a chill guy. I just did this meme when I read yesterday about it, not hard tho.
---
I mean, I even go and help/ask people when playing survivors if they have challenges so I can help, even to this one killer I just played, it was a Ghost face that was hitting a gen and then walked behind me, obviously wanting the grab challenge from the rift
---
Check edited post. This made me realize that well I just overreacted a bit.
---
Ok fellas
---
...read the full sentence mate.
---
This, every chase feels like a coin flip. If it‚Äôs heads you get hit, if it‚Äôs tails you escape. Throw in some addons and it feels more like rolling a twelve sided die, where 1 = escape and 2-12 = dead. 
---
Whenever i play against a spirit and lose her during phase walk i never feel like i outplayed her. It always feels like i just got really lucky.
---
That and having to run iron will just kills the fun for me, as if the spirit is half decent and you‚Äôre injured you‚Äôre fucked.
---
yeah since you can activate it a lot faster
---
I dont understand why everytime they Tbag or stand still, the second I down them with EW3 they disconnect, like c'mon that's on you for letting me stalk you!!
---
Only if it‚Äôs active. If it was placed after all gens were done it won‚Äôt blow up
---
WU NAI TIANDI.
---
Am now reminded that the new Wu Lin character came out and I've gotta try them, thanks op
---
Once in my life i write a stupid joke and this happends :c sorry ;(
---
As I understand it, she also got some reasonable buffs. Unless I'm mistaken, she can now pass through solid walls and stuff.
---
There has to be balance. If a killer is OP then it makes it easy for you and not fun for survivors, leading to more rage quitting and people not playing. I play both sides evenly and this is a big concern either way. 
---
Plus, do you really enjoy wrecking people and not having a challenge?
---
They probably do. Unfortunately, there's a pretty high risk they'll get BM'ed to high hell, and won't stop camping anyways though
---
Survivor buffs and good killer needs, I'd love to see recent stats on survival rates and whatnot, though to be fair they do have to cater to survivors as they need to have fun trying to survive so that the player base is healthy and even
---
Spirit is weak to fake outs, don‚Äôt ever freeze at her 50/50 after a pallet breaks
---
Happens on Xbox too man. I messaged the killer/survivors and all said no one dced
---
The exclusive items are given for free? I would get them all but I feel bad for those who got them because now its just common. 
---
Spirit changes seem alright, but We'll see on the PTB.
---
Of course there are better alternatives for healing, but when used correctly it is more than just a perk to heal. Iron will can be used in a lot of different ways and I use it a lot, it is very good with other perks like it. Bond is nice, but I find it non-effective until tier 2-3. If a gen is part way done then I would just finish it and not waste time healing.
---
My main man wraith has an anxiety problem! Someone get him the help he needs!
---
by far the worst part of it. They dont have codes so theyre not being resold for money and everyone had a chance at getting them. Fucking BS.
---
I mean if you want rage quitting run spoopy myers lol.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwbsik/hey_bhvr_since_you_are_giving_everyone_exclusives/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Killer emotes would be so cool. I assume they‚Äôd all have unique ones because it‚Äôd look kinda silly if they did pointing animations like survivors.
---
Is it becuase of that light over meg and nancys heads?
---
Im fine with them giving away the other skins, but man, we actually grinded our asses off for the event skins. Why are they giving them to everyone? Thats like giving everyone Legacy and normal prestige by default. They also did not include all the paid exclusives which is super weird.
---
RIP gen grabber spirit.
---
New map mob of the dead,
---
New survivors primus crew
---
New killer the warden(Brutus)
---
Lol that‚Äôs fun as fuck as a survivor, he‚Äôs fkn spoopy
---
What was even the point of the event if the stuff we had to grind for is just handed out to everyone? At the very least they should keep the requirements that the items can only be earned during upcoming lunar new year/summer events.
---
They are just jealous they didn't think of it themselves. I love the downvotes, probably the same people who want universal basic income aka the give me things I didn't earn crowd.
---
Alright at least she didn‚Äôt get gutted
---
Wow, as a Spirit main, these changes are pretty good. Good job devs
---
\&gt; *Prayer Beads Bracelet*
---
* Phasing sound effect is now global and can be heard anywhere in the map rather than silent
---
Not to imply that I'm psychic or whatever but I literally JUST suggested this last night to my sister. The day before, I said I thought Overwatch should buff armor back to it's OG state, and what did they do...?
---
So I'm not saying I'm psychic, but if anyone has an balance suggestions you want me to yell into the void then let me know
---
If nothing else, Ace's hats and Golden Feng should've REMAINED code only items, due to their absurdly expensive status. Spending $150 on Dweard and getting it given out for free is already bad, but literal thousands like the Ace Hats and Gold Feng? That's just too much imo. I also think Hound and the Untamed Donkey Jacket should be exempt, as those were event items that were *earned*, not bought.
---
I'd say they're smurfing but honestly at this point I'm not really trying to guess anymore. It's just the pattern. Maybe it's always the same guy, exactly that dude from that episode of South Park about WoW. Who knows? Certainly not me.
---
I got it first game with a Stakeout,Dark sense,Urban Evasion,Sprint burst build.
---
Lost my save in October 2017. They gave me like 115 mil BP to get back my levels but can't say the same for my legacy.
---
It'd be nice to be shiny again.
---
Nice changes to spirit imo not overkill and makes her take more skill. For event cosmetics i feel iffy about them being given but the ones that needed codes is great as it stops scammers and it allows everyone not needing to spend like 1000$ just for a purple reskin of Aces hat
---
Wrong
---
Lol that‚Äôs fun as fuck as survivor, he‚Äôs fkn spoopy
---
Well my window mini games are gone. Prayer beads is useless for me now, and the speed I probaly dont understand to much since I dont play wraith to understand it but imma figure it's good.
---
So thanks survivors I guess?
---
"we already have a japanese killer" is what you said, why does that matter
---
He‚Äôs talking about the event items which never had codes and therefore could not be resold.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwbtjt/gotta_love_this_new_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It‚Äôs a trophy for stalking and tiering up 100 times and he‚Äôs about to down ace
---
Myers is at Tier 3 and is lunging- in fact, this is just before he‚Äôs about to hit Ace. And even if you‚Äôve never played Michael, you‚Äôll know that Tier 3 Shape instantly downs healthy survivors.
---
Lost back in October 2017.
---
The Aparition.
---
I mean you could argue that since she isn't 9 - 10 ft tall and impervious to damage, then her hunting abilities can be utilized to keep her alive.
---
What worries me is that there's no mention of current IV being amended - they only refer to future Tomes.
---
As a survivor main and a hopeful killer in the near future, I can say I like the sound of the changes. I wouldnt really say she got nerfed, just more balanced. I feel with prayer beads you can still scare the crap out of survivors and still enjoy getting that 4K
---
Why not? It's been years since the event may as well
---
I‚Äôm glad the code cosmetics will become free for everyone but I agree with you on the event ones. I think maybe they should‚Äôve released the event ones in the store but for a high price in auric cells, so not as many people will buy it, and they still keep at least *some* of their uniqueness..
---
Basically saying survivors are mentally challenged. I can get behind this.
---
Kensei so mad everyone called the new hero in For Honor a copy of him that he ran away to DBD.
---
they are giving us the opportunity to get these cosmetics because some of us couldn't get the chance to get them \*caugh caugh divorced parents weekly shifts from mother and father caugh caugh\*
---
I would rather play lery's because it's not the size of china
---
Why are you all acting like such a clown?
---
Cartoons from the 1900s style chase, or like a Scooby Doo chase scene
---
Did you fully complete 3 and the dark sense proc? Or did you do like 3/4 of 4 and be there for 3 dark sense procs?  
---
Basically I wanna know if I can get away with doing 240 on gens and be there for 3 completions or if it needs to be exactly 3
---
Thanks!
---
Spirit changes seem good, but We'll see on the PTB.
---
Maybe they should just give everyone legacy for free because hey why not? Let's just remove all exclusive stuff that people earned while it was available, am I right? /s
---
Thank you! :3
---
I'm pretty sure they said he's "overperforming"
---
Bigger maps are usually better for survivors
---
Jojo fans when they see an unsucked cock
---
I don't see why people have a problem with her
---
You either get a stun on the killer so you can run to the next pallets, or you mindgame him. If you know the killer tries to mindgame you a lot, the best counter is not to panick and stand still, he'll try to scare you away 2-3 times on the other side of the pallet. And when he sees you're not vaulting he'll actually try to hit you on your side, so you have to be careful.
---
Also, pallets aren't that unsafe, the unsafe ones are mostly in the corridors, in the rooms the pallets aren't that bad and can be played on both sides. You can get hit but you can also mindgame the killer a bunch. Also if you have Balanced Landing, it's heaven for you.
---
Oh yeah. Faced him yesterday and everyone dced but me. Shit myself as well. Yay brown pants!
---
I guess it's nice for me considering I lost all of those cosmetics about a month ago now :(
---
If it just started happening yesterday, I'm guessing maybe because of rank reset.
---
ITT:  People mad they can't stroke their epeen by showing they have more money than others with cosmetics.
---
I think the devs need to look more so at the ranking system before adjusting actual strength of the killers. If a lot of low skill players are being matched with the high skill players, it may be leading them to think that killers like Freddy or Hillbilly are overpowered when in actuality it‚Äôs just the skill level of the players.
---
Not a fan of the event exclusives coming back for everyone when you had to actually work to get them. :/
---
 Welcome  to the November edition of our Developer Update, a series of posts  detailing upcoming changes and our progress on ongoing issues.  As always, we'll start by recapping on previous topics before jumping into future updates. 
---
## Dedicated Servers 
---
For a little over a month, dedicated servers have been live on the PC version of the game.  Over the course of this test, we have often been asked why the servers were left on without any updates.  We'd like to take this opportunity to explain a little more about this test. 
---
First and foremost, we can tweak certain values behind the scenes without requiring a game update.  This includes things like what the game deems to be an acceptable connection and various matchmaking elements.  This way, we can test a variety of changes without forcing everyone to update their game repeatedly. 
---
Leaving the servers on also allows us to collect far more feedback.   We are hard at work making sure that as many gameplay issues as  possible are ironed out before the full launch of dedicated servers.   We have been including fixes for some of the most pressing issues in  recent updates, including a fix for delayed stalking in the 3.3.2  hotfix.   Thanks to the reports we have received thus far, we are looking to  improve certain Killer powers, perks (eg Dead Hard), and the interaction  system (eg Kicking Pallets or Generators). 
---
 Finally, this test gives us an opportunity to test the upcoming  disconnection handling system, which allows us to better punish people  who disconnect excessively.   We want to make sure that disconnects are being tracked accurately so  players aren't wrongly timed out, and to do so, we need to leave  dedicated servers enabled in order to test the new detection.  In case you missed it, you can find the details of this system here: [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/73858/](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?anno=2&amp;depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=gd&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/73858/&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271,15700280,15700283&amp;usg=ALkJrhjPJoyusOYsqM54UZ2orKgaj9sxNA) 
---
## The Archives 
---
With the last Mid-Chapter patch, we launched a brand-new feature: The Archives.  We are happy to see the mostly positive reception so far, although we are taking note of feedback as well.  We'd like to address some of the common feedback we've received from this first Rift and Tome. 
---
One of the main talking points is the difficulty of the first Tome.  The first level of this Tome is fairly easy to complete, often taking only one match to complete a given challenge.  This was an intentional decision by our team;   we wanted to make sure that this level served as an introduction to The  Archives so everyone could get an understanding of how the feature  works. 
---
At the same time, due to an error, some of you may have seen a sneak peek of the fourth level of the Tome.  This level is significantly more difficult than the first.  The intention is for the levels to gradually become more challenging the further you progress.  With that in mind, we intend to use the following levels to gather feedback and adjust future levels and Tomes if needed. 
---
We had also previously announced the dates each level of the Tome would release.  However, due to the unforeseen delay of the 3.3.0 update, we needed to push back the release dates for these levels to match.  The new dates are as follows: 
---
* Tome I: Level 2 ‚Äì November 13th 
---
* Tome I: Level 3 ‚Äì November 27th 
---
* Tome I: Level 4 ‚Äì December 18th 
---
## Exclusive Cosmetics 
---
Alongside the launch of Chapter 14, we'll be granting *everyone* the following cosmetics: 
---
* Chuckles (Trapper ‚Äì Ultra Rare Mask) 
---
* Dweard (Dwight ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head) 
---
* Sharp Mustache Jake (Jake ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head) 
---
* Studded Jacket (Jake ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body) 
---
* Retro Windbreaker (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body) 
---
* Claudette's Weekend Shirt (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body) 
---
* Purple Cords (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Legs) 
---
* Leather Hoodie (Meg ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body) 
---
* Retro Sneakers (Meg ‚Äì Ultra Rare Legs) 
---
* The BIG Hat (Ace ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head) 
---
* The TPGS Hat (Ace ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head) 
---
* Lazer Bears Victory Polo (Feng Min ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body) 
---
* Lazer Victory Shorts (Feng Min ‚Äì Ultra Rare Pants) 
---
* Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body) 
---
* Hound (The Huntress ‚Äì Event Mask) 
---
* Untamed Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Event Body) 
---
* Pro-Pain Hammer (The Hillbilly ‚Äì Event Weapon) 
---
* Free Song Bird Slip Dress (Kate Denson ‚Äì Event Body) 
---
There are a few reasons why we've decided to unlock these cosmetics for everyone.   To start, most these cosmetics were unlocked using Steam codes and  could not be unlocked on the console versions of the game, meaning we  couldn't give these codes to console players.   Given this limitation, we have moved away from exclusive items in  recent years and want to continue the trend of making cosmetics  available to everyone equally. 
---
Most importantly, the codes for these cosmetics were also being sold by code resellers for exorbitant amounts of money.  Others were taking advantage of this by creating fake listings to scam people out of their money.  This is not something we endorse, and not something we are able to support if someone does fall victim to one of these scams. 
---
By giving these cosmetics to everyone, we hope to put an end to shady resellers and scams while also including *everyone* , regardless of the platform they play on. 
---
## Future Events 
---
 Recently, we've changed the way we handle in-game events and wanted to  take a moment to explain why we're putting elaborate objectives on hold.   Unique event objectives take a huge amount of time to create and test,  taking up time that could be spent fixing bugs and creating new content  that's available year-round.   Going forward, events will be focused around extra Bloodpoints (through  Offerings and/or Blood Hunts), Archive challenges, and event-exclusive  rewards within the free track of The Rift.  This allows us to focus our efforts on game health, which we ultimately feel is for the best.
---
I want to launch survivors with my big long halberd.
---
Its because they need to learn how to counter her. Most people play her the same way and for people who play her differently try and adapt. Literally the same with old nurse.
---
## Spirit Changes 
---
The last thing we'd like to talk about today are the changes coming to The Spirit in the 3.4.0 update.  The Spirit has been a polarizing subject recently with a lot of players finding her to be frustrating to play against.  We also noticed that she appears to be performing far above expectations.  With all this in mind, we have made a few adjustments that should make her feel fairer for everyone. 
---
**Collision during Yamaoka's Haunting** 
---
Currently, the Spirit maintains her collision while using her power.   Since phasing prevents The Spirit from seeing Survivors, any time she  bumps into something she can't see, she immediately knows that a  Survivor is there.   This takes a big part of the skill and counterplay out of the equation,  allowing her to know exactly where someone is before reappearing.  With this in mind, we have removed collision from The Spirit while she is using her power. 
---
**Window vaulting animation** 
---
 Although The Spirit appears to climb through a window from the Killer's  perspective, a Survivor currently sees her stand at the window briefly  before phasing through it.   This left the Survivor with very little time to react, leaving the  Survivor to guess whether she's actually vaulting the window and hope  for the best.  The Spirit will now play a window vaulting animation from the Survivor's perspective. 
---
**Adjusted speed curve post-phase** 
---
 The Spirit currently retains her phasing speed for a short period of  time after exiting her power before returning to her normal 4.4m/s  movement speed.  We have altered this curve to be more gradual, similar to The Wraith. 
---
**Add-on changes** 
---
We have also done a pass on some of The Spirit's more problematic add-ons. 
---
*The Katana Tsuba* 
---
* Decreased the post phase speed boost duration from +0.25 seconds to +0.2 seconds. 
---
*Wakizashi Saya* 
---
* Decreased the post phase speed boost duration from +0.5 seconds to +0.3 seconds. 
---
These add-ons allowed The Spirit to cover a large distance very quickly after phasing.  By toning these add-ons down, she will now need to be closer to the Survivor after phasing in order to follow up and get a hit. 
---
*Yakuyoke Amulet* 
---
* Removed recharge rate modifier. 
---
* Increased haunting duration bonus from +1 second to +3.5 seconds. 
---
* Decreased haunting speed modifier from +10% to -15%. 
---
This add-on increased various aspects without any tradeoff, making it a clear choice in any loadout.  This change gives the add-on a more unique identity, trading movement speed for extra duration. 
---
*White Hair Ribbon* 
---
* Decreased charge speed bonus from +30% to +20%. 
---
*Bloody Hair Brooch* 
---
* Decreased charge speed bonus from +50% to +30%. 
---
*Prayer Beads Bracelet* 
---
* Phasing sound effect is now global and can be heard anywhere in the map rather than silent. 
---
 By far the most controversial add-on, Prayer Beads Bracelet would  previously hide the sound effect that would play when The Spirit is  phasing outside of her husk's terror radius.  This meant that Survivors were constantly at risk of being pulled off a generator with no warning or chance to react.  By making this sound global, Survivors need to be on edge, as they won't know whether she's near them.   This allows the Survivor to choose if they want to take a risk and  continue what they're doing, or if they want to play it safe and move  away. 
---
These changes will be included in the 3.4.0 update and will also be available for testing in the upcoming Player Test Build. 
---
This concludes the November edition of the Developer Update.  Be sure to let us know what you think!

Babysitter Steve strat : breakdown, borrowed time, babysitter, and we'll make it.
---
No it isnt. Was just there on mobile. Spirit change- no collision while phasing, speed drops off after coming out of phase, prayer beads make the phasing sound map wide. Also they are giving out cosmetics that were earned during events to everyone for free.
---
You know what? I'd actually be okay with that. It would give more meaning to all of us who slaved away grinding those Lantern points. 
---
Let everyone have the option to have the cosmetics, but those of us who went through the event 'save' ~$30-$40. It's such an insignificant thing but just the mental satisfaction having unlocked it for free would feel good.
---
These spirit changes feel fair and justified. Good moves devs.
---
I did.
---
Better get in quick if you want to get that grab Challenge done...
---
Because spirit has no counterplay in her current state, and, no, having to run iron will to counter her isn't viable
---
yeah
---
You mean like how killer players move from survivor perk to perk and bringable items to bitch about?
---
It's called finding the gens and finding where to go in a chase
---
Nice insult coming from a pig.
---
Not everybody will know this, especially newer players. It's not gonna be an obvious tactic to wait to cleanse until everybody knows this tactic, and to coordinate a group cleanse with a bunch of randoms with no mic is quite difficult, especially with everything else going on in game
---
No collision during phasing is going to affect her a ton, more than people realise. The vault animation is pretty significant also.
---
Did you submit a ticket?
---
This deserves the upvotes
---
I‚Äôll just Ghostface for it
---
But you can't just say that lol I could say rancor always hides until someone else opens the gate. But neither of those ALWAYS happen.
---
If we are going to include one perk that gives a possibility of a mori, we should include them all. Just becuase one is more or less likely to work shouldnt matter.
---
I mean in theory hag could mori all 4 players without a mori. Only her (or someone with the teachable obviously) and Michael can do that.
---
But I thought we didnt count perks becuase they can be used on anyone. Whereas only Mike can use his tombstone.
---
If only they were smart enough to correlate the fact that they're getting bullied so much is because they're playing in such a way that allows the more dickish survivors to do so
---
because their character models are all different they would probably be a lot of work, but still be in the same category
---
So everyone could have say, a wave, a point, and a dance
---
Uncertainty is present in regular chases with M1 killers, due to tall walls, T and L walls, unsafe pallets, etc.  But spirit you have 0 idea where THe killer is  so you act on your own will.  That‚Äôs not a mindgame that‚Äôs straight up guessing
---
The voice that drove rins dad to insanity was the entity
---
Yes, this is exactly the change I wanted.
---
Just more people learning how strong she is over time and playing her, and everyone playing her getting better over time.
---
Nurse on release wasn't really considered strong (ironically, the Wraith held the S-tier killer spot during that time)
---
oh wow.
---
Why should I give a shit? I wasn't playing when legacy was around so how bout they give everyone free legacy.
---
i actually really, really like this change
---
*now if only they could change legion...*
---
Literally survivors just need to adapt. Thats all.
---
Those Spirit changes are absolutely juicy.
---
But prepare for a lot of people to say she‚Äôs been nerfed into the ground and a lot of other people still calling for her removal.
---
You may be mistaken. Which one makes you think that?
---
careful killer mains are going to be offended by you posting this
---
It's really the perfect change, it's no longer the most OP add-on in the game, but still worth spending BP on. I like it.
---
Exclusives?
---
wow the collision change on spirit is gonna be huge
---
By definition any decrease in power is a nerf.
---
Im sure you are gunna get downvoted for this. Survivors love escaping, its not enough for them just to pip so im sure many will be against it.
---
BHVR really doesn't know how to do gradual nerfs do they? Really no reason to touch her vault animation or gut that many of her add ons.
---
buff legion*
---
Can you make it so the dev‚Äôs give us shirtless Ash? Thanks in advance
---
Now that petals are off my web, I _might_ be able to consider something other than BBQ. Swear to god, I saw maybe one Dead Rabbit the entire time, but I've had three since yesterday.
---
That's beautiful man. Well done.
---
No. Ruin can be cleansed at any time if people look and its not like totems spawn in decent hiding places half the time lol
---
I'm actually a killer main by a ridiculous margin haha. I don't have a single survivor over level 40 because it's just not fun for me. OP just really loves to start fights and make people upset. But eh   ¬Ø\\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  nothing you can do about it
---
Nah, I rarely use ruin anymore. I was so excited when I finally unlocked it as a teachable and used it quite a bit but now it just seems to get cleansed too early. It's frustrating having a wasted perk slot 1 minute into the game. I prefer Pop Goes the Weasel much more now.
---
Yeah... lol. I think the sentiment from the killer's perspective is that you punish the survivors as a whole for their misplay, but the reality is that the poor soul getting farmed's game play is being on a hook all game.
---
Oh absolutely. I got paired with this dude several times and had a bit of a rivalry so there was BM‚Äôing on both sides. I didn‚Äôt deserve the win but it was incredibly satisfying.
---
it means that they pray to their lorde and savior jesus christ aka the entity
---
A shit load of people lost them a couple updates ago. I feel like a part of this is to return them without admitting they messed up.
---
God, these jokes are just cannibalizing each other
---
I think legacy should be like prestige 1-3 bloody outfit 4-7 legacy lol
---
It literally is but okay I'll just read it later then. Thanks for nothing.
---
the events were just completing a certain amount of generators and stuff so, they weren‚Äôt really a grind.  It just depended on if you played during that period or not.
---
How are you supposed to adapt to a killer that has a kit that turns into a game of chance in chase? Every other killer has counterplay, you cannot just leave the other side without counterplay. Players shouldn't have to run the same perks every game just in case they run into one killer out of the 15+ possible
---
BHVR flew in a few reputable streamers this week to address things in the game.
---
I.e.
---
- OhTofu - often talks about how the maps are the biggest issues, not so much the killers.
---
- Scorpionz - the go-to for Pig mains spoke about talking to the devs on multiple developments in the game.
---
In due time man.
---
sprint burst using the skateboard would be cool.
---
because they earned it while these cosmetics are event stuff that can be easily earned if we got a second chance. back then the blood web was twice as difficult as it is today bloodpoints were hard to gain and the web was more expensive
---
Or you could git gud and learn to hit a skill check. Go disable v-sync in the settings. [How to have ez skil checks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjKllKJrdBE)
---
You have no excuse for missing those skill checks.
---
Thank you for not tea bagging
---
I mean thats mike. Wraith. Etc.
---
A scientific theory is tested, validated, and proven. There are multiple different kinds of theories in multiple disciplines, so the way he used it is perfectly acceptable, if we're being pedantic.
---
Sacrifices must be made!
---
So, just like legacy? Whats your point? People grinded for them - end of the story.
---
Agree. Everyone, even the console players had the chance to get these. If you didnt play back when these events happened then you shouldn't have them. Otherwise they better start giving us free legacy, the dev-shirt for Nea and all the non-public streamer cosmetics like H2O mask, Ohmwrecker and DiaHype as well.
---
Lmaoo I read it with the voice of that youtuber that always plays trapper
---
Are you saying Michael and wraith don't have counters??
---
That Prayer Beads change... Hoo boy.
---
I mean at one end of the spectrum sure new players will struggle finding it which sucks for them if they get a killer who's decked out but at the other end of the spectrum you have good players who can work through ruin since they hit greats more often and know common totems spots. 
---
In another way ruin helps players in the long run because if you work through it you're trying to hit greats and over time you'll get the timing right and ruin wont be a big issue. 
---
If they did what you're suggesting then it should be a regular perk with a time limit of 5 minutes honestly.
---
I think it's an auto include in every build. Even if the totem gets cleansed right at the beginning, the survivors still wasted time. And if it stays up longer, then it gets a lot of value. Im purple ranks with killer and survivors still seem to blow up gens with ruin still up so I only have really good experience with it. Only reason now to take it is Devour Hope, because you don't want them to search for your totems.
---
EXCLUSIVE COSMETICS
---
Alongside the launch of Chapter 14, we‚Äôll be granting everyone the following cosmetics:
---
Chuckles (Trapper ‚Äì Ultra Rare Mask)
---
Dweard (Dwight ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head)
---
Sharp Mustache Jake (Jake ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head)
---
Studded Jacket (Jake ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)
---
Retro Windbreaker (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)
---
Claudette‚Äôs Weekend Shirt (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)
---
Purple Cords (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Legs)
---
Leather Hoodie (Meg ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)
---
Retro Sneakers (Meg ‚Äì Ultra Rare Legs)
---
The BIG Hat (Ace ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head)
---
The TPGS Hat (Ace ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head)
---
Lazer Bears Victory Polo (Feng Min ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)
---
Lazer Victory Shorts (Feng Min ‚Äì Ultra Rare Pants)
---
Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)
---
Hound (The Huntress ‚Äì Event Mask)
---
Untamed Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Event Body)
---
Pro-Pain Hammer (The Hillbilly ‚Äì Event Weapon)
---
Free Song Bird Slip Dress (Kate Denson ‚Äì Event Body)
---
So you want them to Nerf a perk that gets cleansed in less than 2 minutes anywhere above rank 16? Just because a very small portion of new players have trouble with it doesn't mean it needs a time limit.
---
Stop! My penis can only get so erect!!
---
I think instead the timer could work this way:
---
All totems on the map begin as dull. The timer begins counting down from 5 minutes. At the end of the 5 minute timer, a random dull totem will light up and reveal itself as the hex. The totem can still be cleansed before the 5 minutes, but the survivors won‚Äôt know which dull totem is the hex, which would reduce the likelihood of it being broken in the first 20 seconds of the match as it usually is.
---
Thank you
---
They are getting healthy changes, hardly nerfs.
---
I say she's pretty balanced from these changes. I just hope they don't change her anymore
---
People complain about everything, don't expect that to change. Imo, the spirits changes are pretty good.
---
what the hell
---
I think legion is most likely going to get a rework. But we will have to wait a year or two to see loloolool
---
Isn't this what borrowed time is for?
---
They didn‚Äôt even give a single reason for why they were giving these items to people either.
---
Yeah, learning killer around ranked reset is kind of brutal. If you're just starting to learn I'd wait a bit for strong SWFs to rank out of your rank.
---
Unless the issue is DBD matchmaking. If that's the case ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Brings a tear to my eye
---
Especially since we were told before they weren't coming back. I didn't spend on Gold Feng or Ace but I did save to buy SF Claud/Street Meg and it does feel kind of bitter.
---
Yes, but in regards to prayer beads specifically, the global sound effect is a lateral power shift for her I think. For the survivor it helps, but it doesnt really change her efficacy. At least thats how I feel, I'll have to see when it rolls out.
---
Killers are all beefed up by the entity
---
Yeah. These changes are basically exactly what i wanted. She is still a very good killer but ppl gonna cry like when nurse got changed
---
*~~Pssst, it's Kate, not Laurie!~~*
---
I can't control what people bring. It also doesn't help if the killer continues to come after you after the first hit.
---
‚ÄúNo cortez, fuck you‚Äù
---
Most importantly they changed prayer beads
---
Totally fine with this change.
---
Then I'm afraid English has eluded you because you are reading it incorrectly.
---
I'm happy to see one of my favourite obscure memes return.
---
Richtofen as survivor when
---
its good when phasing to people since the survivors dont know where you are coming since its map wide its not like billies chainsaw
---
:( while I understand I'm still sad that the chuckles mask I won in a giveaway of Tom/72hrs will now be available for everyone
---
I've been downvoted for less, And i'm sure everyone agrees that the hatch is annoying, Though as a intentional side benefit for survivors, With 2 Gens being marked for the killer there's a higher chance she'll/he would spend more time checking on them which buys more time for standard generators to be done. Essentially like a hex that survivors would like to destroy but could make it through without it. I would imagine most killers would certainly take the initiative of making aggressive patrols around them /expending pop goes the weasel etc to keep those gens down. It's an interesting balance, If the killer neglects them then there's literally no room for him/her to blame the game or RNG because it's spawn is no longer tied to RNG, They would have earned it
---
They removed collision. Is that just for survivors only? If so, that kinda blows, but oh well.
---
I was excited to see that. I think the new prayer beads will still be useful. Although any players running SC or Premonition will know whether to get away or keep working.
---
Nah, she's pretty much objectively worse.  People know when to tap now, so she's not going to be getting grabs, especially without being able to feel around the gen
---
When was this?
---
Can we get... An f... For my fallen soldiers.
---
Rip My weekend shirt, my street Meg, my science fair claud, my dweard, my daddy Jake, my chuckles, my donkey jacket
---
Legacy COMPLETELY revamped the bloodweb and awarded those who prestiged, it wasn‚Äôt an actual event.  These skins were not much of a grind compared to legacy.
---
yes, and the cosmetics are a token to show you were a part of the community back then.
---
i intend to just Bloodlust the crap out of someone and not attack when i've caught up until they vault a window or something
---
yes, I do.
---
I also don't chase the same survivor for 5 gens, if I feel like I'm getting outlooped I'll change focus and try again after getting somepressure back.
---
Ty for showing this
---
Honestly I think these changes are fair. Which is surprising considering the devs track record
---
That was an ultimate chad move
---
Guess not being able to tell if spirit was phasing wasn't as big of deal as people acted like since that wasn't changed and nobody has said anything about it
---
JOJO, MY HAMON, TAKE IT!!!!
---
It‚Äôs on the dev post, this is gonna happen on the 3.4.0 update.
---
I understand the PC exclusive cosmetics that console aren‚Äôt able to obtain, but event cosmetics should be limited. Every other game has limited time cosmetics, Idk why Bhvr won‚Äôt do that
---
Sure.
---
And I could easily earn the legacy if given a second chance. Bad argument.
---
I‚Äôm perfectly fine with them being given away for free, exclusives are stupid and I can see why the devs don‚Äôt want exclusives in the game, not everyone played back then and not everyone had the chance to get them, the devs don‚Äôt want people getting scammed by going on eBay and trying to buy ‚Äúexclusives‚Äù also no one in game is going to care wether or not you have an jacket
---
killers can open the gates themselves if the survivors refuse to do it.
---
RIP
---
I think it‚Äôs for the best, don‚Äôt want to phase into a rock and be stuck there for 10 seconds.
---
I much rather have them release new legacy skins than giving away old skins people earned at events.
---
Here come the shinigami. Will we get Lord Death from Soul Eater, or Kenpachi Zaraki from Bleach?
---
I don't have any problems as killer at rank 8 atm.
---
I wait 10 min at least as survivor at rank 10
---
Spirit does. Either A run across your blood marks and around the spirit or B stay away from pallets until shes out of phase and loop her to hell.
---
Than I will DC when you have a challenge to mori me!
---
... oh wait, that counts towards the challenge completion
---
It‚Äôs time to face the facts, these puns are great.
---
... There goes my $200 Brazil Claudette, $70 David Jackert, and $115 Bloodletting shirt...
---
It literally isnt. I'm on mobile and the link works just fine. I also told you what was in the post.
---
All I can say to this post is, enjoy your 18K games, while I'll get 25K if I don't have any kills and had a fun game filled with chases and mindgames.
---
I think she will still be a top tier killer, the games will simply last longer than 30 seconds. I haven't played her personally, so I can see if you do why you might feel that way. A lot of other killers dont get constant gen grabs and still win. I guess like I said, ill just to wait and see. If i plow through all of them and survive every match then I concede.
---
The game was practically unplayable during howling grounds. That jacket was my proudest achievement and now it means nothing ‚òπÔ∏è
---
That's actually a pretty good change.
---
Oh I don't expect it lol. I also think the changes are are fair. Interested to see how much it effects her though. Still seems like she'll be top tier.
---
"outplayed" or even "played" are 2 words I don't think of when I hear spirit main.
---
What do you mean by gradual curve ?
---
I edited it thx lad.
---
They are pretty much useless now. Global phase sound just mean as soon as you hear it you move or stop the gen, when you cant hear it start again. Gen grabber spirit is done. And prayer beads at a pallet... you're going to know exactly if she phased, no mind games, no need to be looking out for glowing glass.
---
At least buff his add-ons! They are just so weak...
---
If anything I see more survivors die trying to open the door the last % than saving people.
---
It's fine. It exists to end the game not rush the end and get free kills

Developer Update | November 2019

---
Ôøº
---
Welcome to the November edition of our Developer Update, a series of posts detailing upcoming changes and our progress on ongoing issues. As always, we‚Äôll start by recapping on previous topics before jumping into future updates.
---
Dedicated Servers
---
For a little over a month, dedicated servers have been live on the PC version of the game. Over the course of this test, we have often been asked why the servers were left on without any updates. We‚Äôd like to take this opportunity to explain a little more about this test.
---
First and foremost, we can tweak certain values behind the scenes without requiring a game update. This includes things like what the game deems to be an acceptable connection and various matchmaking elements. This way, we can test a variety of changes without forcing everyone to update their game repeatedly.
---
Leaving the servers on also allows us to collect far more feedback. We are hard at work making sure that as many gameplay issues as possible are ironed out before the full launch of dedicated servers. We have been including fixes for some of the most pressing issues in recent updates, including a fix for delayed stalking in the 3.3.2 hotfix. Thanks to the reports we have received thus far, we are looking to improve certain Killer powers, perks (e.g. Dead Hard), and the interaction system (e.g. Kicking Pallets or Generators).
---
Finally, this test gives us an opportunity to test the upcoming disconnection handling system, which allows us to better punish people who disconnect excessively. We want to make sure that disconnects are being tracked accurately so players aren‚Äôt wrongly timed out, and to do so, we need to leave dedicated servers enabled in order to test the new detection. In case you missed it, you can find the details of this system here:¬†https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/73858/
---
The Archives
---
With the last Mid-Chapter patch, we launched a brand-new feature: The Archives. We are happy to see the mostly¬†positive reception so far, although we are taking note of feedback as well. We‚Äôd like to address some of the common feedback we‚Äôve received from this first Rift and Tome.
---
One of the main talking points is the difficulty of the first Tome. The first level of this Tome is fairly easy to complete, often taking only one match to complete a given challenge. This was an intentional decision by our team; we wanted to make sure that this level served as an introduction to The Archives so everyone could get an understanding of how the feature works.
---
At the same time, due to an error, some of you may have seen a sneak peek of the fourth level of the Tome. This level is significantly more difficult than the first. The intention is for the levels to gradually become more challenging the further you progress. With that in mind, we intend to use the following levels to gather feedback and adjust future levels and Tomes if¬†needed.
---
We had also previously announced the dates each level of the Tome would release. However, due to the unforeseen delay of the 3.3.0 update, we needed to push back the release dates for these levels to match. The new dates are as follows:
---
Tome I: Level 2 ‚Äì November 13thTome I: Level 3 ‚Äì November 27thTome I: Level 4 ‚Äì December 18th
---
Exclusive Cosmetics
---
Alongside the launch of Chapter 14, we‚Äôll be granting¬†everyone¬†the following cosmetics:
---
Chuckles (Trapper ‚Äì Ultra Rare Mask)Dweard (Dwight ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head)Sharp Mustache Jake (Jake ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head)Studded Jacket (Jake ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)Retro Windbreaker (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)Claudette‚Äôs Weekend Shirt (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)Purple Cords (Claudette ‚Äì Ultra Rare Legs)Leather Hoodie (Meg ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)Retro Sneakers (Meg ‚Äì Ultra Rare Legs)The BIG Hat (Ace ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head)The TPGS Hat (Ace ‚Äì Ultra Rare Head)Lazer Bears Victory Polo (Feng Min ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)Lazer Victory Shorts (Feng Min ‚Äì Ultra Rare Pants)Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Ultra Rare Body)Hound (The Huntress ‚Äì Event Mask)Untamed Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Event Body)Pro-Pain Hammer (The Hillbilly ‚Äì Event Weapon)Free Song Bird Slip Dress (Kate Denson ‚Äì Event Body)
---
There are a few reasons why we‚Äôve decided to unlock these cosmetics for everyone. To start, most these cosmetics were unlocked using Steam codes and could not be unlocked on the console versions of the game, meaning we couldn‚Äôt give these codes to console players. Given this limitation,¬†we have moved away from exclusive items in recent years and want to continue the trend of making cosmetics available to everyone equally.
---
Most importantly, the codes for these cosmetics were also being sold by code resellers for exorbitant amounts of money. Others were taking advantage of this by creating fake listings to scam people out of their money. This is not something we endorse, and not something we are able to support if someone does fall victim to one of these scams.
---
By giving these cosmetics to everyone, we hope to put an end to shady resellers and scams while also including¬†everyone, regardless of the platform they play on.
---
Future Events
---
Recently, we‚Äôve changed the way we handle in-game events and wanted to take a moment to explain why we‚Äôre putting elaborate objectives on hold. Unique event objectives take a huge amount of time to create and test, taking up time that could be spent fixing bugs and creating new content that‚Äôs available year-round. Going forward, events will be focused around extra Bloodpoints (through Offerings and/or Blood Hunts), Archive challenges, and event-exclusive rewards within the free track of The Rift. This allows us to focus our efforts on game health, which we ultimately feel is for the best.
---
Spirit Changes
---
The last thing we‚Äôd like to talk about today are the changes coming to The Spirit in the 3.4.0 update. The Spirit has been a polarizing subject recently with a lot of players finding her to be frustrating to play against. We also noticed that she appears to be performing far above expectations. With all this in mind, we have made a few adjustments that should make her feel fairer for everyone.
---
Collision during Yamaoka‚Äôs Haunting
---
Currently, the Spirit maintains her collision while using her power. Since phasing prevents The Spirit from seeing Survivors, any time she bumps into something she can‚Äôt see, she immediately knows that a Survivor is there. This takes a big part of the skill and counterplay out of the equation, allowing her to know exactly where someone is before reappearing. With this in mind, we have removed collision from The Spirit while she is using her power.
---
Window vaulting animation
---
Although The Spirit appears to climb through a window from the Killer‚Äôs perspective, a Survivor currently sees her stand at the window briefly before phasing through it. This left the Survivor with very little time to react, leaving the Survivor to guess whether she‚Äôs actually vaulting the window and hope for the best. The Spirit will now play a window vaulting animation from the Survivor‚Äôs perspective.
---
Adjusted speed curve post-phase
---
The Spirit currently retains her phasing speed for a short period of time after exiting her power before returning to her normal 4.4m/s movement speed. We have altered this curve to be more gradual, similar to The Wraith.
---
Add-on changes
---
We have also done a pass on some of The Spirit‚Äôs more problematic add-ons.
---
The Katana Tsuba
---
Decreased the post phase speed boost duration from +0.25 seconds to +0.2 seconds.
---
¬†Wakizashi Saya
---
Decreased the post phase speed boost duration from +0.5 seconds to +0.3 seconds.
---
These add-ons allowed The Spirit to cover a large distance very quickly after phasing. By toning these add-ons down, she will now need to be closer to the Survivor after phasing in order to follow up and get a hit.
---
Yakuyoke Amulet
---
Removed recharge rate modifier.Increased haunting duration bonus from +1 second to +3.5 seconds.Decreased haunting speed modifier from +10% to -15%.
---
This add-on increased various aspects without any tradeoff, making it a clear choice in any loadout. This change gives the add-on a more unique identity, trading movement speed for extra duration.
---
White Hair Ribbon
---
Decreased charge speed bonus from +30% to +20%.
---
Bloody Hair Brooch
---
Decreased charge speed bonus from +50% to +30%.
---
Prayer Beads Bracelet
---
Phasing sound effect is now global and can be heard anywhere in the map rather than silent.
---
By far the most controversial add-on, Prayer Beads Bracelet would previously hide the sound effect that would play when The Spirit is phasing outside of her husk‚Äôs terror radius. This meant that Survivors were constantly at risk of being pulled off a generator with no warning or chance to react. By making this sound global, Survivors need to be on edge, as they won‚Äôt know whether she‚Äôs near them. This allows the Survivor to choose if they want to take a risk and continue what they‚Äôre doing, or if they want to play it safe and move away.
---
These changes will be included in the 3.4.0 update and will also be available for testing in the upcoming Player Test Build.

To be continued...
---
Survivors like you are so obnoxious. Like why can't you just leave and win the game? Why do you feel the need to stay back and continue to taunt the Killer?
---
No offense but why would you ever spend so much on a single cosmetic?
---
The Spirit changes seem fair and necessary.
---
I don't really mind other players getting outfits I had to grind for.
---
But why do they think Tome 4 is doable if you're not farming?
---
Overall good update though.
---
Why is any of it on there. They're exclusives, they're supposed to be exclusive. I own half of these that I spent actually money on and it's all for naught. Actually very disappointed by bhvrs decisions, as per usual.
---
And what‚Äôs the point of that?  There are cooler skins anyways.
---
Nope. It's already near impossible to get the gates open as a solo survivor after the hatch has been closed. Not only are you fighting against the clock, but you've also often have to open the gates in phases while dodging the killer as they bounce between gates. 
---
This would make it even more difficult. 
---
Killers, certain ones anyways can already take steps to slow things down at the exit gates, or traverse quickly between them. Killers don't need additional advantages in regards to the gates.
---
4th perk should be ruin, to slow the game down *just a little bit*
---
*laughs in 60 second slug watching*
---
Well, I'm guessing that part of the longer animation took him into the pallet...
---
Nobody cares about the ones people bought with codes, we care about the event cosmetics we grinded for
---
Good spirits will be able to hear your footsteps and grunts of pain, and tend to realize once the scratch marks end that you've either started walking or backtracked. Not to mention that running back on your scratch marks can give her a chance to bump into you, effectively ending that chase.
---
The changes make sprit much more tolerable.
---
Being honest aside from a few busted addons killers have very little broken shit now.
---
Hopefully the balance more maps soon
---
Yes but thats more of a concession. You cant defend the hook if you walk over to close the gate.
---
O_o
---
It's an extra chance to give me dat hook. Shouldn't people be greatful?
---
Or like the legion button addon as well! Once survivors catch onto it they won‚Äôt know if the spirit is actually there or if she‚Äôs somewhere else
---
If you want to argue like that, which is fine, you have to commit to it. Give everyone literally every old skin, like legacy. (Thats coming from someone who has legacy skins btw). You cant just pick some random skins people played for and give them away to everyone.
---
Well tbh "logic" or even "smart comment" aren't words I think of whenever I see your username pop up in threads on this sub so I guess we'll call it even.
---
Isn‚Äôt that 3-7 hatchets?
---
Too bad. R1 is a top light.
---
Prayer Beads are now interesting, instead of annoying, at the very least
---
Honestly, I never made the connection.
---
I mean, they did. But ok.
---
The fucking Texas Chainsaw Massacre Leatherface dance lmao.
---
all of her other add-ons are good. People are just going to move onto the next best add-ons and there will still be people crying about spirit until the devs nerf those add-ons as well until she is gutted.
---
I'm famous ik
---
Yes, ‚ÄúRIP‚Äù
---
they are not dead, they are just interesting now.
---
The hatch exists to end the game. It's not perfect but it stops 30 minute endgame where a survivor just hides.
---
A killer already has a 3k at the point just take the win. Or slug if your that bothered
---
So no collision means she will walk through trees and walls like a nurse. I think her problem was some addons and pretty much her synergy with stridor and how she sees blood when she is fazing and you're injured. She is like a legion but she downs with frenzy
---
Yes they did. Did you not read the developer update?
---
ThEy CoMpLeTeLy GuTtEd SpIrIt!@^$^$&amp;@
---
Legacy should be put in the game for everyone but not for free, I think legacy should be earned because I see it as an extra prestige, maybe make it a reward for devotion or rank or something
---
Yes! Literally any supernatural monster from the show would be perfect lol
---
They were, though. You had to play a fair amount and you had to suffer trough a mediocre event. Its just the same as legacy. A limited time frame to earn a lot of points.
---
Huntress's hair and bunny ears create drag.
---
Fungoose is a strong killer main that likes running PWYF bubba: https://youtu.be/oqnTWw06Ljs
---
He also explains his thought process for a lot of it.
---
The collapse was meant to fix people holding the game hostage and to also address hatch standoffs. There's nothing wrong with people 99%'ing a gate
---
lol somebody at bhvr clicked the wrong button
---
As someone who has a decent amount of time into Spirit, some thoughts on the changes.
---
I think pretty much all of the general changes are fair. Any good Spirit player doesn't rely on collision during Phase Walk and can usually triangulate exact positioning via sound and scratch marks anyways, so it's more than fine. I'm just curious what kind of bugs we can see if I unphase directly into a survivor hitbox though, as that can be unintentionally hilarious. I always thought it was strange she didn't have a window vault animation as well, and with it being a thing her passive phasing addons might actually be worth using now on certain maps.
---
I'm surprised more that they didn't address the the base recharge speed and functionality of her power. The fact that the power starts recharging from where you end it rather than draining fully means most Spirit players use the power in short bursts in chase and the only time the power bar actually gets drained is if map mobility is needed urgently. Having the power bar drain entirely when her usage ends ala Legion would have probably been too heavy a nerf, but I think there should be more of a penalty than there currently is. Also surprised they didn't even TOUCH the biggest elephant in the room, which is indication of her power usage to survivors in a chase. This has been the subject of most content creator videos and I'm guessing they will all still continue to whine about how "unfun" it is to play against her.
---
On to the addons, the Prayer Beads nerf is more than fair. In fact, the effect is probably going to be the same and the only thing this is going to affect is the ability to grab people off totems/gens. This change allows the addon to still be ridiculously powerful while making it less of a complete "I Win" button. That being said, going to make sure I get the grab challenge in Tome 2 done before 3.4 goes live. :)
---
What I DON'T think is fair, however, is the Yakuyoke nerf. While I do agree that the add-on as it currently is, is just way too much value in one addon...removing the recharge rate ON TOP OF nerfing the move speed during phasing is going to make this thing entirely useless now. Spirit already struggles with large maps, and any decent player in a chase is going to break into a run away from a loop if they think Spirit is phasing. The extra duration won't make up for the loss in move speed to counteract this. They should have just removed the recharge modifier, or the move speed and left the other variable as is. For now, all this is going to do is force Spirit players to use this addon every match until 3.4 to get rid of their stockpiles so enjoy dealing with hyper-mobility Spirit every game.
---
On that note, I'm really not a fan of ANY addons that aren't Ultra Rares giving massive drawbacks such as this, because what ends up happening is they show up constantly in bloodwebs and you're forced to take them to get to whatever you were trying to obtain, and never use them.
---
The pseudo-Windstorm addons getting nerfed also wasn't a surprise. I would have rather they modified the move speed after phasing instead of the duration of the speed lunge, because right now using both of them in tandem is almost too hard to control at times. Again, a fair nerf and won't really affect their power at all for veteran Spirits who can accurately triangulate survivor positioning while in phase. The recharge speed addons getting nerfed was a bit of a surprise, but again very few people actually use them since the other addons are generally considered more effective and her power recharge is plenty fast at base. Now that we know their exact values though, I may play around with them a bit now as well as in PTB testing.
---
Girlfriend. If 4 years xD
---
*proceeds to flicker the lights*
---
Strange, my OG console handles this fine as well. Hardly ever have and FPS/lag issues. No a very demanding game to begin with
---
We all know that's not why.
---
I did something similar, was against a ghost face while on hook I saw someone cleansing his noed but was chased off it, so, I went and cleansed it, even though it got me killed (I was on death hook) since I knew it would give the other 3 a chance to get out
---
Yes. I didn't realize it was on my lense until it was too late
---
It‚Äôs not possible. Lmao
---
Just put your toe at the line of the exit. When you get knocked down, you'll automatically make it out. The only worry is tombstone Meyers grabbing you but you never give Meyers free hits unless you know they don't have that.
---
‚ÄúThe devs don‚Äôt want exclusives in the game‚Äù
---
The devs: Just made an entire outfit exclusive to the Nintendo Switch
---
As long as they made sure its the same amount of grind - alright. Thats clearly not the case with the event skins, though. Old players grinded them while new players just get them for free.
---
While I will miss the vault animation, at least killer shacks mean something against her now. The collision on the other hand, that's gonna hurt a lot, probably 1/3rd of my chases end because I felt survivors while phased.
---
Agreed. When you're the last one and that hatch is closed, unless you've got a key, that's pretty much it for you.
---
Ok you're blocked. I'm also reporting you to the mods. So screw you
---
Im extremely happy with these spirit changes i was terrified that they were gonna take a fat dumb on her and call it a day like they did with legion. All of the changes seem really fair and they changed the bad things abt her with out really touching her power (besides the phase out stuff but thats not a big deal imo) and the addon changes arent bad either. As for the cosmetic stuff as a ps4 player it makes me happy to get cosmetics i thought id never have.
---
And queue times are conveniently 20-30 min ;)
---
They were free for old players too? If the event cosmetics weren‚Äôt in the game before would you have quit? You were playing the game and getting a reward it was barely a grind
---
What's the point in any exclusives in any game? To give players who supported the game early on, or during important times a small token of gratitude as a reward. 
---
I would've been completely on board with deactivating all the unused codes for exclusives, because they werent meant to be sold years after initial distribution, but outright removing all the status from them is fucked up.
---
If they die in the less than 2 seconds it takes to tap the gate then start the animation they werent gunna make it anyway. And i dont view chasing a survivor twice, (three if they had adrenaline), downing them, transporting them to the hook potentially through body blocks, then defending the hook for as long as 2min from a three man bum rush where if you mess only have to mess up once for them to get the unhook as a free kill.
---
They said it was because people were charging hundreds of dollars for the codes and scamming people out of their money. They didn‚Äôt give any reason for the event exclusive items though
---
I have seen such selfless herosim only [once](https://youtu.be/k-Tm0h0Wxfs?t=3m32s) before.
---
As a Spirit main, I really like the changes. I won‚Äôt feel quite so bad for playing her anymore.
---
The one other change I wish they added is for survivors to see grass move as she‚Äôs phasing through it.
---
No collision means she won't bump on survivors when she phasing.
---
Tapp has redeemed himself and may finally rest. *slowly fades from roster*
---
Yeah something on that front needs to be done about the exit spawn locations. In more maps than most you can stand in a spot and see both gates.
---
Myers is the most fun killer to play against
---
oh now i get it
---
If you haven‚Äôt tried it, Dead by Daylight is great fun, especially before you hit high ranks and everybodys still learning how to play.
---
That's awesome to hear . I'll take free cosmetics anytime. The people who had these exclusive cosmetics had them for a long time so I see no problem here. What I do feel bad for is the people who shelled our $100+ for a cosmetic skin code on eBay...
---
Nah you still had to look for it. The worst ones are the ones you spawn in facing lol.
---
The event skins? No.
---
Meg's mum :(
---
Gonna take some good old fashioned killer/survivor cooperation.
---
The intention is for the levels to gradually become more challenging the further you progress. With that in mind, we intend to use the following levels to gather feedback and adjust **future levels** and Tomes if needed.
---
No offense but it is actually beyond stupid to spend ‚Äòthousands‚Äô on a fucking recolored hat in a video game. At least now scammers who would actually charge that much can‚Äôt sell them anymore.
---
I've been playing since release and probably have given a killer hits at the gate around 2000 times and there hasn't ever been a single time where I was picked up, grabbed, or remotely close to not escaping.
---
The people failing this and dying are fucking up something that is incredibly easy to accomplish that has 0 risk.
---
Replying to

@DeadByBHVR

Any news on the Switch update or is it still no ETA?
---
Dead by Daylight
---
¬∑
---
32m
---
Sadly no, we do not have an ETA but as soon as we have more information we will communicate about it. Thank you &lt;3
---
Yakuyoke nerf was too harsh, it's now effectively a self-cripple addon like old Hag Waterlogged Shoe was. It's going to really hurt anyone still putting bloodpoints into her since you're going to be forced to take it at Rare quality sometimes.
---
Oh yea only 100 hahahhaha^hahahhahah
---
If you are using a high pressure killer, corrupt intervention can potentially be a better perk with less rng. However with good rng or on most other killers, ruin still takes the cake.
---
it isn't an argument it's a statement
---
I am more than ok with this.
---
I own every single exclusive and I think it's ridiculous honestly, like yeah it's fine and dandy and i can flex on people with my cool outfits but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't help the game and is just a silly side edition.
---
I'm ok with everyone getting these exclusives.
---
No collision with survivors is a HUGE nerf.
---
From Twitter:
---
So you either troll or you play full sweaty, there's no in between ? You are already in SWF to be honest that's enough of an advantage, camping and tunneling only works because survivors don't have communication normally. But you do, meaning that you can stay on gens if the killer does that, meaning he has no pressure on 3 of you which is a big deal.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs that it has to be that way, because in a very raaaares occasions I‚Äôve met cool people.. killers or survivors..
---
I think the event exclusives should stay exclusive but whatever.
---
Thank you dev. Now I can loop the spirit.
---
They werent though? You had 2 weeks to play a pretty absurd amount of games - which -newsflash - is hard for people who actually have jobs / uni / what ever.
---
No they didn‚Äôt. All the reasons they gave only applied to the steam code ones.
---
Nature's Wrath is his ability that actually does something.
---
Yeah, it's still good really. It's just like the Legion's addon.
---
I‚Äôm trying to figure out what activates the trap though. If you look closely the trap isn‚Äôt active at the beginning of the clip
---
Does this mean we're all getting golden Feng or nah?
---
Pretty sure they meant limited time exclusives, the Nintendo switch exclusive can be bought any time
---
Bruh, that's exactly what it is.
---
Im not doing it purely for that, im doing it for the scary feeling dbd rarely gives me nowadays. 
---
But just be mad bruh
---
I don't really rely on sound. I'm hard at hearing. Sometimes I use the headset but most of the time we just turn her tv up and mine down because I can't rely in sound anyway
---
&gt;Barely a grind
---
Ohh boy someone didn't play base DBD. One bloodweb took like 5-10 survivor games to go thru, at best. Plus no WGLF or BBQ, no escape cakes, no party streamers, nothing. The game was the literal definition of a grind back then, and both event skins and legacy is a way to reward players who fought thru it and stuck with the game for doing so. I'm fine with code cosmetics being released, but event skins and legacy should, imo, stay locked.
---
Did people honestly think she was getting legion'ed? I thought it was p obvious they where gonna pull a nurse rework with her, by making her more fair whole keeping her status on the tier list.
---
I'm purple ranks too and it just seems to get cleansed way too soon for me. I prefer a perk that works all match.
---
I'm just going off the top of my head lol I remember seeing a dweard head for $150 once.
---
So do we still not know when spirit is using her power or did I misread something?
---
As a Killer main who likes to think they're pretty damn good at what they do, and understand where Survivors are coming from 90% of the time in regards to frustrations against certain Killers, I'm very proud of BHVR's actions towards Nurse and Spirit. It really feels like they understand people want fun and powerful Killers to play as and against and these past few Killer adjustments (Freddy, Nurse, and now Spirit) have been incredibly healthy for the game in my opinion. Good job BHVR, keep it up in the future please.
---
What happened? I'm a bit out of the loop.
---
If you lost your main objective of getting out by doing gens then also lose your second chance of finding the hatch, im sorry but youre lucky to get a third chance after that at escaping at all. Also if your the last survivor and you progressed one of the gates then hid the killers gunna hang out by that gate anyway.
---
Which dev update. Did they put one on YouTube?
---
What‚Äôs the change?
---
Chase em out!
---
I never understood this. One game we had 3 survivors running around in circles at the exit gate doing what we assumed was just a meme as the killer watched and waited for collapse to end.
---
In post game chat, they were angry at us for waisting their time and not just leaving. Lol, they opted into the time wasting just as much as we did. They could have chased us out or hooked us if we didn't leave, so I don't really understand it. Maybe they were joking in that example or something.
---
The in-game event cosmetics were all available for both PC and console, it sucks for the people who actually stuck with the console version in 2017-2018 to lose their only token which show their loyalty.
---
And the twitch exclusive skin they just released recently
---
Why does everyone think all survivors I like this? Jesus fuck, some of us just want to have fun.
---
Any update? Did it get all the way to +6?
---
They explained why they were giving them to everyone in the update notes, didn't they?
---
I mean he‚Äôs said prayer beads needs a nerf before, but ok.
---
The gate being 99ed wont change that. The end game collapse takes a long time with people hooked. 
---
Also tbh there is no way to lose a camped survivor if you face camp. Just hit the unhookers and they will trade hooks till one us dead. Unless some BT/DS and right by a gate
---
You need to be able to read your opponent and anticipate their actions. 
---
Most mindgames are like this. 
---
When a killer moonwalks around a jungle gym, you don't know their location, so you may very well get hit, but if you anticipate the mindgame you can negate it.
---
Think how against Trapper, you don't *know* where his traps are, but you can still be damn sure he's going to put one in a place like the shack window, or in a grassy corner in a pallet wall tile, so you're going to play on that assumption.
---
It's the same against Spirit. You don't know exactly when she uses her ability,  but you can bet that once you break LOS or open a gap with what looks to be her husk, she's going to move.
---
You don't know where she is, but you have a good idea where she thinks you are, and that's something you can use.
---
It's certainly in her favor, but that isn't a bad thing.
---
Has downright ghostly at face value!
---
Tell me why passive phasing is a good mechanic?
---
It's completely rng, you don't interact with it as killer. But you will sometimes randomly get a hit thanks to it because from the survivor's perspective you were moving in a different direction before passive phasing happened. There is no reason to keep it.
---
&gt;Vault animation is literally her gimmick.
---
So? This isn't an argument for keeping it. It's another example of her not giving feedback.
---
As a toxic survivor, I 100% agree with this. Certain killers are jokes and others make me go through 6 deodorant sticks a game. Like legion and pig. Absolute jokes at the moment
---
But let me guess your down with them selling the lunar exclusives because it‚Äôs recent and not in ‚Äúbase DBD‚Äù where playing the game was grueling and super hard
---
Connsoles run like crap, u cant pass thath sorry
---
UwU
---
As you can see im garbage at making memes, but i thought this fit pretty well. 
---
It's NSFW because Spirit got fucked pretty hard with this patch lmao.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen, most rookie killers don‚Äôt camp but instead leave hook immediately to find other survivors. Only when I‚Äôm dealing with green to 13 rank killers do they start camping, usually resulting in a 3k because the other survivors hook dived despite said survivors being purple to green when doing so.
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that unless it‚Äôs a rookie who has heard of basement bubba, they always leave the hook victim behind to find more survivors, and I‚Äôm gonna guess by the teabagging gate survivors I end up with that they insulted the poor rookies Moreno French than not in Xbox messages. One time I congratulated a rookie ghostface for his 3k. He said the others were mocking him for being a rookie and that was it.
---
If he blocked the exit and wouldnt move. Trapping them in the game it kinda is.
---
At least 1 person agrees. I bet the same people downvoting me are the ones who t bag and gen rush.
---
I'm only Rank 13 as a killer and I already get outplayed by toxic builds 9 games in a row without a sacrifice and few hits while being t bagged at e very turn. Never doing it again
---
I just learned that myself 2 days ago lol
---
Yes, it would be comically busted if it was for all obstacles lmao. This is to prevent the super common occurrence of spirits just phasing around a loop and just waiting to bump into a survivor, and coming out of phase when she does.
---
That's when you run to the other gate.
---
And again all I'm hearing is you arguing more advantages for killers at the gate, which they don't need. 
---
Shit by your logic the third chance is so generous the entity might as well just impale the survivor when the hatch is closed.
---
If we‚Äôre gonna be equal and all, I can‚Äôt help but notice the absence of Meg‚Äôs Deathgarden mask..
---
With no collision it means Iron Will is ACTUALLY a counter now. Before once she collided with you it was over.
---
Not my Song Bird Kate top );
---
Hope is also a thing
---
Imagine pallet loops against a ghost spirit. You drop the pallet, she just phases straight thru it. Every chase would last 10 seconds.
---
Nice gatekeeping. I'm sure you are kn favor of people paying hundreds of dollars for codes they may or may not be real.
---
&gt;not everyone played back then and not everyone had the chance to get them
---
the event cosmetics were specifically FOR people who played back then as tokens of loyalty.
---
&gt;the devs don‚Äôt want people getting scammed by going on eBay and trying to buy ‚Äúexclusives‚Äù also no one in game is going to care wether or not you have an jacket 
---
so make an announcement that you're deactivating the codes, wait a week and then deactivate them all. Rather simple honestly.
---
Why would you use extra hatchet addons without irihead?
---
Did they change beads????
---
spirit was overperforming, freddy had the most kills per game or something like that, but they never used overperforming, it means different things
---
Zoom in so you can see the words
---
Seriously, this Billy was just having a chat with me after the game even though he told me my teammate was tbagging him through the match.   
---
One of the reasons I rarely play killer, I'm way too salty for that :')  
---
Also I started a redbubble:  [https://www.redbubble.com/people/blinkingbat](https://www.redbubble.com/people/blinkingbat)   
---
Thank you [SnarkmasterB](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnarkmasterB/) for suggesting the site! &lt;3

You can sell most counter strike and tf2 items on the market though
---
I've said this in a personal Discord, but I don't necessarily think it's related to Rin's father, but it is. I've assumed the trailer takes place in both realms, so the intro is in our realm but the trailer gradually goes into the Entity's realm. Obviously the statement about Yamoaka's blood is what makes me think this but; basically Rin's father came back to reality or whatever, and realise what he'd done, in the shame and horror he committed Hara Kiri/Seppku aka ritualistic suicide to regain honour, however the despair and Hara Kiri's somehow awakened an ancient Oni/Yokai from the despair hence why the Yamoaka blood line is mentioned. Because iirc there are SOME Oni who come into our world from a great deal of grief/despair.
---
tl;dr Rin's father came back to reality and committed seppuku and the mixture of spilled blood, seppuku and despair awakened an Oni.
---
I already did a ghostface pun you Hag! (Again, not real insult, just doin puns)
---
Legit? We're getting these?
---
Actually back when they first said they didn‚Äôt want to do anymore exclusives, they were referring to PAX codes etc and specifically said it was because they didn‚Äôt want console to be left out. But now they‚Äôre fine with leaving out all platforms other than Switch
---
Loyalty isn‚Äôt knowing about something first, and it‚Äôs easier to just give them to people in the game
---
How can you anticipate something you physically cannot see.  You don‚Äôt know when she‚Äôs using her ability, how long she‚Äôs using it for, and where she‚Äôs gonna go.  How can you anticipate that in any way
---
... The one he linked in his post lol.
---
Nobody is arguing for directional phasing sound, what are you on about?
---
Tbh I rarely if ever use BBQ, as I stay nearer to the hook and don‚Äôt often spot the aura across map. Ruin usually on indoor maps or other good totem map.
---
I got those things for 15$ back in the day. Rip all my excusives.
---
Have her drop to her knees in a prayer position while phasing. Remove collision. Done.
---
you never heard of games like CS:GO, league of legends, team fortress 2? people love to have unique things and will spend tons of money to have them
---
also, no, I didn't spend a cent on cosmetics in this game
---
A Purple add-on that is horrible. It had to change but now it's useless.
---
you're just salty cause some of us can now get cosmetics you worked for
---
I assume that goes for the killer cosmetics as well lol.
---
DBD was an objectively worse game back then and the current game exists only because people were loyal enough to still keep playing it and supporting it back then. They outfits themselves aren't even all that good compared to what's available for money, what them nice is the fact that not everyone can just have them.
---
Well, for most of the skins - yea. But there isnt a single reason to give away the event skins people grinded for. You cant sell those or anything. Its just screwing with your loyal player base at this point.
---
The Hatch isn‚Äôt a free win.  It‚Äôs whoever finds it first.  Equal odds equal opportunity.
---
thank FUCK
---
Not to mention she would totally negate the very safe loops like on iron works or on Thompson‚Äôs. Basically making her a nurse maybe even better since it wouldn‚Äôt require much skill either.
---
I think they mean collisions specifically with players.
---
If the game could‚Äôve ended without him moving, how is it holding the game hostage?
---
When you're rank 1 and unironically run botany knowledge and self-care, we'll make it and urban.
---
It's always weird to see people who probably were never rank 1 complain about perks.   If you're good at looping and delaying the killer, almost all perks are good.  Also botany makes sloppy butcher basically nothing. 
---
Source: rank 1 survivor
---
Yikes. Like wraith bell from anywhere addon. Always makes me nervous.
---
Or Bone Clapper. I haven't read in full but if they didn't change that her phasing isn't directional it's not like you have a clear idea where she is.
---
I think this is fair since most of these were not earned in game. I think Legacy should stay exclusive though and I don't even have any.
---
*Big stronk huntress
---
The existence of near unobtainable exclusives is harmful to the community.
---
*fingers crossed*
---
The biggest issues were tackled, first and foremost prayer beads. I for one am happy now.
---
Ironically enough, in the game as teir 1 myers (when nobody is looking and youre undetectable), you move the slowest.
---
Except for Michael.
---
Ryuk from Death Note or nothing please.
---
Fair changes to the spirit. She'll still be a top tier killer but now I'll feel slightly less cheated when I get shit on by one.
---
Yes I am. Why not just make everyone rank 1 and give out prestige 3s while we are at it.
---
I'm curious as to where you got that this was a hannya mask? When you google hannya mask, you get [this](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/011/717/723/large/leon-tung-snipaste-2018-07-08-20-50-53.jpg?1531054761). The mask in the Yamaoka Estate more closely resembles an [Oni mask](https://images-platform.99static.com/WAyx0p5ydzKmmA0_GL1Sw2Gs-OQ=/0x0:960x960/fit-in/900x675/99designs-contests-attachments/109/109685/attachment_109685452). 
---
Onis in Japanese folklore make more sense in this context. Onis are the punishment dealers of the afterlife, who are evil and deal with wicked and evil people. The Entity's realm is easily comparable to a sort of hellish purgatory with its endless trials of pain and torment. We know Rin's father was driven mad by the Entity, so it's a much better assumption imo to say that he will be the new killer as the Oni since he now believes he is responsible for punishing the "evil" survivors.
---
Either that, or an actual Oni spirit was dormant in the mask, and the spilling of Rin and her mother's blood awoke the Oni, which now seeks to dole out punishment on Rin's father for the murder of his wife and daughter, but who is ultimately being used by the Entity. Either way, I think Rin's mother is the least likely to be a killer.

Good. They were too common and too cancer.
---
It will definitely either be up on the dead by daylight wiki or released on YouTube.
---
I missed the link oops.
---
Pantless Myers or nothing.
---
&gt;Vault animation is her gimmick.
---
I fail to see that as an argument for keeping it from the gameplay perspective. 
---
&gt;If you could hear her phasing, her power becomes just a MS buff after you stand still
---
No, not at all. You still don't know where she's actually going, it's the same thing you have right now. She can still easily get hits on you since she's invisible and really fast.
---
&gt;and without the vision
---
Please, there is a reason people say all you need to get good at spirit is a headset. You can easily locate people with audio from footsteps, breathing and painfully yelling.
---
Man...I need this mask!!!!!
---
To do it you go into a custom match and when you all ready, the UI should come back to switch to Spectate/Survivor/Killer but you have to do it quickly. You should keep your cursor over the button.
---
because rank and prestige is easy to get and pretty sure the devs don't want to make the same exact event every year
---
I'm actually surprised they did this but very happy. It's gonna be harder to get grabs but will still be difficult for survivors.
---
Yeah, I saw. That's really disappointing since they said they hoped for a mid-week release.
---
Make it a perk a killer has to waste a slot on and I'm 100% fine with it.
---
That's a fair point, I guess it depends on whether or not future levels includes "finalised but not currently released", i.e. the current IV.
---
Would it count as a new map if we just had a new variant added to the Yamaoka Estate, featuring a shrine as the centerpiece instead of the house?
---
If you didn't play during the event you shouldn't get the skins it's that simple really.
---
Yes. Its official and confirmed.
---
Not on XBOX though. :(
---
That's actually a good idea. So many survivors I go against hide for the entire 2 minute timer and it's just boring walking between gates.
---
Thanks God my bloodletting is safe, I mean, they did specify it was a limited offering and bringing it back like that would've looked like false advertising...
---
I mean it's the same for survivors though. Pretty sure Ash and Bill could kill some of the killers, even when armed with nothing but a flashlight.
---
Get gud and you can dodge
---
Or run franklins
---
That's not why you play the videogame.
---
I still think global sound is super powerful since it's non-directional. It's only going to affect gen-grabber builds, if anything it will still make as powerful of not more so in chases.
---
The Yakuyoke need is bullshit though. It's now a meme add-on like the old Waterlogged Shoe.
---
Nice. That‚Äôs gonna make it far better. Plus, intimidation factor.
---
Seems like the game detected that survivor as being chased, which stops the timer.
---
That would be only way I complete the trapper challenge (trap all 4 survivors in a trap in a single trial) because I am god awful at trapper.
---
I am genuinely upset about this.
---
I only own Dweard (and I didn't buy it), but why advertise something as an exclusive if you're just going to rip that away in the future?
---
It's false advertising/theft on a degree that is unusual even for BHVR, their usual tactic is to release a really strong perk on a paid DLC and then nerf it after they have everyone's money.
---
What Twitch exclusive?
---
All of the parents in this game would literally be perfect for killers. Lets get Claudette dad in here and his power is being disappointed in the survivors
---
The faster they get the challenge done, the faster the annoying builds stop and the game goes back to normal.  Actively trying to prevent specific challenges just means the disruption to normal game play goes on for longer.
---
(Not saying you should deliberately let it happen unless you‚Äôre feeling generous, but actively preventing them outside of the normal game flow is stupid)
---
Sorry i didn't wait for it to hit 6
---
These aren't event cosmetics you doof. They aren't giving us things like the Chinese new year David and Feng cosmetics, these are cosmetics which you could ONLY get by finding a steam code for them, either by going to a convention or a giveaway.
---
Take off your fookin jacket.
---
I don‚Äôt think those Spirit changes are enough, but we‚Äôll see.
---
It‚Äôs a surprise :).
---
I would unhook the crap out of him. I‚Äôm a bloodpoint whore.
---
Oops meant switch
---
Where is my Gordon Ramsay killer?
---
*pulls Dwight out of a locker*
---
You donkey!
---
Oh yeah. It's all coming together.
---
I'm 100% a survivor main, but I definitely compliment killers who try whacky builds. Recently I played against an impossible skillcheck doctor and it was such a nice change of pace!
---
Yes. It's there in the list as the Lazer Bears Victory Top/Bottom.
---
But it's already in the game. At least I'm positively sure I saw that
---
OwO
---
Wow, a streamer interacting with chat... never seen before in DbD community... give him all the upvotes.
---
dunno ive never got that far before
---
Now prayer beads even has intimidation factored in. Great!
---
No chef don't say that please!
---
SEKIRO DLC ?! oh HELL YEAH!
---
What do they mean by "granting everyone these cosmetics"? Like it'll show up in the store or we literally get it for free?
---
i think a dance emote would be an awful addition. at least 1 emote on killer is okay, but please no ridiculous ones imo
---
Agree i wish spirit was same idea but no fat rolls. I just bought the sword lol.
---
Remember all the sound bugs?
---
Thought I'm on r/CODZombies for a second lol nice meme
---
My plan is to use the hag blight body with the rift poison claw!
---
I mean, they could easily just sell them in a pack for $6.99. Its a far cry from the $150-500 a piece  resellers are asking for on Ebay, but instead they're giving them to people for free. 
---
People are downvoting you for sounding stupid, not because they disagree.
---
Ngl, I don't even have any exclusives and I would be pretty pissed if I would have payed money and then everyone gets them for free.
---
I refuse to use these ~~except the leather meg~~
---
Darkmok and Jalad at Tanagra
---
I try to forget
---
The Huntress, David, Billy and Kate ones WERE event exclusives.
---
Not really. Any decent Spirit is going to know exactly where you are without bumping directly into you. In fact, this so going to make her MORE powerful in certain situations since she can now ignore bodyblocking (intentional and accidental) entirely in certain situations to get to a specific target.
---
They made the point of most of them only being available on pc/steam, and not console. The mask falls under that category. So how do I get it for PS4?
---
camping is stupid, wether you're killer or survivor.
---
It'll ruin your BP and score, let's not forget how boring camping is.
---
NOED is a ‚Äúplay like shit and get rewarded‚Äù card.
---
Gotta make sure to get one game with it before the nerf since there‚Äôs a challenge on the archives to grab a survivor!
---
These are pretty good changes that don‚Äôt completely make her shit. I didn‚Äôt even know about the window vault animation, and prayer beads need a rework.
---
Wrong.
---
F for the poor fuckers who decided to spend 100's of dollans on these items kek.
---
Cue clip of Big Boss saluting over The Boss's grave.
---
Just wait till the Huntress gets her tome that's gonna be a tragic animatic
---
Maybe I will post this on for honor for even more confusion &gt;:)
---
Ruin is just a good perk to throw on, and I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm not running BBQ to get extra BP lol
---
So you're a camper?
---
ü¶Ä
---
Classic BHVR :D
---
Yeah i learned about the window vaulting the hard way
---
If you're on Xbox the game runs better on the internal harddrive. Best way to go really.
---
Im just saying the egc didnt do anything, theres no added pressure to leave you just 99 the gates, which is how me and my friends played before egc anyway as a super easy counter to bloodwarden. Im just saying that making your third chance of escape slightly less strong shouldnt be taken into consideration. Also my idea doesnt even hinder you running to the door i said it can regress super slowly so if you get it to say 40% then hear a tr and hide the killer will still see progress on that door and will still see progress on that door if he stares at while you make it to the other exit gate and completely open it. Id suggest like a .5-1% regression per second not being touched. Again just enough to not hold the game hostage. Or you can even have it to where going into egc doesnt cause the doors to regress at all so that way if the hatch gets closed doors wont regress at all and id be fine with that.
---
So... not only have I lost my legacy cosmetics which have not been returned for years... but will not lose my chuckles and retro windbreaker and purple cords for Claudette.
---
Thanks devs.
---
Okay you got me their, point still stands that it's unhealthy for the community. Be happy that more people have more cosmetics. I've been playing this game since release, gotten every event cosmetic and a lot of the exclusives, I'm glad that more people can have these cool cosmetics. I bet you're only mad because you were one of the idiots that spent a fortune on them.
---
The problem with Legion is there is no saving Legion as is. Feral Frenzy is just a fundamentally bad power.
---
Then just send out a request to deactivate all unused remaining codes after a warning period. 
---
The Steamworks API allows you to do that.
---
This is a spit in the face of the legacy community.
---
I‚Äôll try that out! I do like capture in general though, taking clips can be fun.
---
when are they just gonna remove that shit tbh
---
No, the dbd community really likes to complain about everything. Nothing new. Although, prayer beads are a bit too strong, coming from a p2 spirit main.
---
Why do events at all? You obviously don't need to play you will still get your cosmetics.
---
My bad, but it's mostly unobtainable exclusives.
---
But that mask is a more feminine one
---
Nice! Thank you, sir!
---
I like the idea of the code ones, because being able to go to a 2017 gaming event to get an exclusive Feng top was pure luck. I don't love the idea of old event skins being released, as people actually worked for those. It'd be like releasing legacy for free, just kinda a small slap for those who worked hard back then.
---
Love these moments
---
*w o t*
---
Imagine Cothe  or a dev  saying  that  haha.
---
That was before the console release though so we never even got a chance :(
---
Ask them, maybe they'll give it to console players. Bill was only recently added to console, that's a whole character that console didn't have for years, I'm sure you can handle one cosmetic.
---
It‚Äôs just the sad truth about the current consoles, they were underpowered at launch.
---
I mean you still have to make guesses right? They should fix the grass movement to if they want to do a proper fix.
---
People play to have fun, but for many fun means winning by any means or ensuring nobody else can have fun, which is why I tend not to play multiplayer or PVP, like, Dead by Daylight is the only PVP game I play regularly because of the entire premise of Dead by Daylight, where it's survivors hiding from killers and killers hunting the survivors. It used to be fun, a real horror game where as a survivor you're scared and having to be very careful, on watch, and tense, and as a killer there was just this unadulterated fun of hunting people down and terrorizing them, but now on both sides it's just annoying and "Okay, how am I gonna work around these assholes and these meta perks?" this is just the game now.
---
The absolute best part about this is that you just had enough time to point (to where I assume the exit was) before your head popped, and you watch Steven run in the complete opposite direction in your dying moments.
---
When you watching the camera pan around the character and you see it.
---
Read any of my previous comments. I got one code (Dweard) from a physical event. 
---
I understand you may be frustrated and upset that someone's opinions differs from yours, but calm down.
---
Just a thought, the blood you see is "spilling" in reverse, and the audio at the begining sounds distorted like its being play in reverse. I know people have translated it to mean "Your blood belongs to the Yamaoka" But I wonder if playing it in reverse would reveal anything.
---
There are some rooms that are stupid with balanced landing, some busted pallet loops in the main rooms, where the fk do totems spawn, what the hell is that second floor, half the pallets are useless, other 47% one little mistake as survivor = hit, whereas killer makes one little mistake = survivor can't capitalize (killer getting stunned is a big mistake btw), gen spawns are aids
---
Hillbilly killed his parents
---
Last Gen Richtofen as a Killler when?
---
Even Micheal supposedly, Freddy too, the entity is suppose to be budding these guys.
---
I WANT LEGACY FENG
---
I assume you didn't switch to survivor, because there is no way you could handle other survivors AND toxic killers.
---
still no golden feng tho
---
Sounds fun and can potentially be used to clear a hook
---
This was fucking great.
---
Remember how people spent $50+ on Dweard?
---
I love the legion too. And I agree those too should be the baseline
---
Just annoyed that you could be so selfish.
---
Never thought of that. Is it easy to transfer data from hard drive to internal? Thanks for the comment.
---
ok listen here you don't get far in life if every little thing pisses you off just chill and let others enjoy things for once
---
Biggest 'Fuck You' they've ever done. 
---
"Some people were scammed out of their money by code resellers, so we're going to scam *all of them* out of their money ourselves!"
---
Killers have to get a 4k. It‚Äôs not enough to pip they need it.
---
That‚Äôs what you sound like. Our goal is to escape, yours is to prevent that. The hatch is a game ender so one survivor isn‚Äôt stuck doing gens alone for a few minutes to have a chance of escaping.
---
Maybe dad identifies as mom
---
Yeah, keeps the survivors on the edge all the time but isn‚Äôt as ridiculously ridiculous
---
Spirit players tend to follow a pattern.
---
1. Run at you until they feel they need to use their power.
---
2. Stand still, watch how you react.
---
3. Once they have a bearing on your direction, they use their power to approach your last known location.
---
4. They either predict your location and head you off or they chase you down, tracking via scratches/sound/collision.
---
5. Go for a hit, wait for power CD, rinse and repeat.
---
You can see when they start step 2.
---
You can assume that they will use their power for real once you've either opened a large gap or you've been out of the Husk's LOS for more than a couple seconds.
---
Nobody's saying it's easy.
---
Outplaying a good Spirit is a lot harder than playing Spirit well. It can be done, though.
---
You just need to be familiar with how people play Spirit, really get into the head of the other guy.
---
It‚Äôs better than some of the nerfs people suggested for it.
---
Yeah, they are so op, that the unique thing I will nerf, like maybe instead of totally eliminating the sound to reduce the are to 50%, or that it's a 2/3 seconds interval where they don't hear it and then it sounds like normal
---
'Thank you for coming to our event at Comic Con and supporting us from Day 1. Here is an exclusive code for you as thanks. Also, now eveyone has it, so I guess it wasn't really exclusive at all. Sorry."
---
You could still run Stridor to counteract Iron Will. This isn't as big a nerf as people think it is. In fact it's a buff as you literally cannot bodyblock a Spirit from her intended target under any circumstances, one of the main strengths of Nurse versus SWF.
---
I'm a little annoyed at the nerf on Brooch/Hair Bow because those were my go to addons but I'll live lol otherwise quite happy with these
---
Wait how are they doing so? I don‚Äôt see those items in The Rift like the Huntress mask.
---
Ok listen here you don't get far in life if you expect things to be given to you for free. Earn it or fuck off, I don't need life lessons from a child.
---
Yeah, sometimes I have extremely good plays I wish I captures, but usually the gain is worth it. I notice it more in games like PUBG, but it may affect DBD too. Also, I noticed some of it is internet latency. It sounds dumb, but a lag spike caused by a hit or teleporting people I experience drops at times for a few moments.
---
Freddy definitely- apparently the Entity ‚Äòweakened him in some aspects and strengthened him in others‚Äô. However, Michael is already evil personified and an unstoppable force. And his power in DBD reflects what he already did in the movie- stalking his victims before making his move. The Entity seems to have had little or no hand in how Michael works in its realm.
---
Legacy was something hard to earn.
---
Event cosmetics are no where near.
---
I have legacy on 2 survivors that was a huge challenge, doing some event challenges is piss easy in comparisson.
---
It was always a counter though..? Either that or you‚Äôre still going to be shit with her new changes
---
Rule 1. Be civil. So be civil before the mods show up
---
Its very easy to get the save if you bait the hit. You have 1 person fake the unhook and get hit then run away to the gate as the second person unhooks while the killer is cleaning his weapon, this person will then take a hit. You then have the third person to take another hit as you make your way to the gates and if the saved person has bt you can have them take another hit. Like i said this wont hinder the saves, at most it forces the team to think whether they can pull off a 2 man save while they have someone camp the door if they wanna start egc to go for the full 3 man save.
---
How is this a spit in the face of the "legacy" community? You didn't have to grind for these cosmetics unlike Legacy. You just had to pay money, sometimes hundreds of dollars. 
---
I think releasing these cosmetics to the community just ends up being a better idea business and consumer wise, sorry you feel cheaped out after recklessly spending a few hundred on some in-game cosmetic.
---
Or against plague
---
It's simple, just go to manage the game and then transfer all data, it'll take about 10 mins. Done, game will now run better overall.
---
Boy have I got news for you
---
stay mad see if i care at least i'm getting a laugh out of this
---
I think the nerfs are fair save for Yakuyoke getting completely dumpstered.
---
Feng didn't exist when the Legacy cosmetics were released. You can only get Legacy cosmetics for the original survivors.
---
Not sure where to ask. Can we no longer get scary torch lights and medkit in bloodwebs?
---
All my friends are so jealous of my jacket and now it‚Äôs worthless.
---
I love cannibal, he's just a delightful goof. He's also not so bad once you get good at knowing when to chainsaw, you can use it more often than you'd expect. That said, I mostly main low teir killers so my perspective is wack.
---
The hero we need but not the one we deserve.
---
There‚Äôs still a few unless people aren‚Äôt posting the whole list. Stuff like the youtuber and streamer cosmetics, or at least most of them, are still gonna be exclusive.
---
Yet here you are replying again. Laugh away little charity case.
---
Toxic killers pisses me off but not half as much as the toxic survivors when I'm a killer when I'm not the killer I don't care what the other survivors are doing but if I see them tea bagging I won't save them from the hook I'll let them die in fact I'll use them as bait
---
I'm long past the point where I enjoy running BBQ.
---
However, there is still so, so, SO much left to grind it almost always gets a spot regardless.  I'm eager for the day where I've got everything I've want maxed out and missing out on 2x BP every killer game won't matter.
---
Is this real? They have you do these challenges at rank 1? Or is this photoshopped? I‚Äôm an idiot so I need the clarification. Haven‚Äôt done much of this event because of Death Stranding.
---
Then legion proceeds to never use his power once that game and tunnels the shit out of you
---
I feel you ;(
---
XD
---
I don‚Äôt run it often, but this is why insidious is my favorite perk on Michael. When they‚Äôre T-bagging at the gate, get the evil within as close to level 3 as possible. Walk away and around the corner of the gate and wait insidiously. Very often, a curious survivor will get cocky and walk out just a little when they don‚Äôt hear a heartbeat. Stalk to evil within 3 and one hit them. It‚Äôs the most satisfying feeling in the game by far and if you‚Äôre lucky, teammates will try to save their downed ally.
---
I think you might still be able to do it, where you start phashing with the survivor just barely inside your terror radius so they won't hear the phase
---
You know how many fucking game crashes it took me to get that david and huntress cosmetic? That event was a mess, now people can get it for nothing. Awesome.
---
The entity took Michael because if left in the real world, Michael would kill everyone and everything, robbing the entity of new toys to play with
---
Your parents for divorced because of you XD
---
They're not op, bc this really cool perk called spine chill exists! Oh wait, all the people who complain about it are too bad to play without their crutches like sprint burst and adrenaline. If they would actually try to fight against her they would see she actually has counterplay.
---
Idk Micheal is doing a lot more running that I remember him doing in the movies
---
Love it when the two most toxic games I play get a crossover episode
---
A lot of them were exclusive for 3 years, that's quite a long time be one of only a few people to have them. Compared the the skins coming out now they don't even look that good. You want to keep these from people just so you can feel good about yourself that you're special.
---
I can see this is going nowhere so I'll leave this here. I'd normally wish you a good day but you're not only wrong, but also a selfish asshole so go fuck yourself.
---
Wait Dweard is available for everyone?
---
I mean sure but also getting blinded at every pallet and every single time you go for a pickup is annoying as shit.
---
Watch survivor mains still bitch about spirit even after changes.
---
Wow, now dbd is doing a crossover with For Honor
---
With the reasons they gave it would make more sense to give everyone legacy then give them the event items. This is just stupid.
---
You're the best kind of person
---
ok is that suppose to make me sad my mother's a bitch so i honestly don't care
---
We salute you
---
You can't read her very much while she's phasing, but you can learn to read when she's actually phasing versus when she's just faking it.
---
Once you learn that, you can learn to start making the killer misread your position.
---
Nurse isn't even garbage though.
---
I believe a rough translation was "Your blood belongs to the Yamaoka."
---
WHERE'S THE WAHHHRGH SAUCE?!??
---
how can you learn to read that?  I wanna know.
---
They just announced both of those.
---
That's right. This is the episode where they switched bodies right?
---
Could they buff trapper already =(
---
I don't get what this is about...
---
This just seems so silly, that must have been a pretty funny game.
---
Keys are probably the single most bullshit thing in the game, balance of any character or perk included. There's nothing like setting up a 3 gen, and then the game turning into a ghost town for the next 5 minutes while the survivors slowly comb the map for chests and actually get lucky and rewarded for it.
---
It will be when Chapter 14 releases, along with every exclusive code cosmetic (I.E. street meg, Science Fair Claudette) besides Bloodletting.
---
Stand still mindgame lives on
---
May as well! Exclusive cosmetics are toxic! You know what, we should just give the rift cosmetics away too after the event has finished. Why not?
---
Either this or one of them is replaced with Haunted Grounds
---
It's not the heat
---
Why nerf activation speed addons? I‚Äôve never heard anyone complain about them, just seems unnecessary. Other than that these changes seem pretty good, other than the fact that you still can‚Äôt really tell if she‚Äôs using her power.
---
I like the idea that it's Samurai killer Dad survivor
---
Because they're not the same, both of those are achieved through gameplay progression. These cosmetics were free cosmetics that people are using to scam and profit off of, while BHVR sees nothing from those sales.
---
Your comparison to ranks and prestige is a bad one and doesn't invalidate BHVRs decision on this.
---
Imagine dodging maps with literally 80% unsafe pallets.
---
Fucking brilliant well done survivor mains, Hillbilly is next
---
Dang. No more gen grab Spirit, since as soon as she phases, everyone's gonna be off the gen until the phase sound goes away
---
It's a free win, You're doing well, everyone is being shut down, gens are being stopped. Easy 4 kill game right? You catch something out of place. The last survivor! You chase her and land a hit! She flees, As you pursue she escapes via hatch. The only requirement is to essentially out last your randoms and even then you can see the hatch as you play and run there first or open it via key even after it closes. The only legitimate debate would be that it's needed to prevent a game from being held hostage but there are better ways than an RNG hatch and i'm pretty confident i just gave you an example of one
---
I agree with you. I skipped out playing during the lunar new year of the dog, and I'm missing the mask and jacket that were given out. But I wouldn't demand them, because it's a marker of "yeah, I've been here, grinding this game in this timeframe". It is as much a mark of the "age" of an account as is legacy. And it doesn't make sense to couple them up with Dweard&amp;co. because event skins can't be sold. 
---
So I don't think people should get the 2016 legacy skins, but they also shouldn't give out "legacy" event skins.
---
Unsafe pallets. Safest rooms and vaults. I think it‚Äôs fair. 
---
As killer nothing better than playing as billy or Ghostface here.
---
Many event exclusive items are going to become free for everybody to use.
---
Devs have decided to just give away every exclusive cosmetic away for free, except for legacy.
---
I'm fucking crying I'm so happy
---
...no? Look at my comment history, I've made multiple in the last hour or so about how I don't think event skins should be released for free. Anything a player had to work for in the past shouldn't be just given out.
---
I mean she's def top tier. It's hard to try to avoid what you can't see.
---
NNN actually raises your risk of prostate cancer.
---
That's good for me, I never had a chance to use them because I am console. Some of the event ones being no longer exclusives seems a little bs but it's understand why they did that. People were selling fake accounts with those cosmetics on them for like 200 dollars.
---
I am on console unfortunately I cannot affoed a better computer and current one is very bad:/
---
Mk. I'll be waiting for my free legacy outfits.
---
No, she hasn't been changed in over a year, there has just been a surge in popularity over hating here, maybe it has to do with popular streamers? Idk
---
Alright guys, next are the Ghostface nerfs, get those D/C primed and ready! /s
---
Wut
---
I've got a lvl 38 Spirit and haven't seen a single Beads. A lot of red Glasses, though
---
Bubba: \*happy yes moans\*
---
I‚Äôm new to the game, it seems like camping is pretty effective in making sure one of the survivors dies.  Why isn‚Äôt it effective?
---
Could make cute terror radius perk builds too
---
Hope not.
---
Billy is totally fine. The only things about him that could have ever been considered OP were the flick (removed three years ago) and instasaw (already nerfed with the Tinkerer rework).
---
He's a major threat with a pretty high skill ceiling, but unlike Spirit and Nurse he has some pretty obvious counterplay.
---
Personally, he's one of my least favorite killers (he's clunky, finicky, and ugly) but I'd still have to call him one of the best, most balanced designs in the game.
---
Here for registration
---
The only 'nerf' she deserved was the window animation, it was just really confusing. This community is gonna ruin every killer in a few months...
---
Shouldn't a reverse bear trap catch flimsy straight fellas?
---
Oh, sorry.
---
Are any of those cosmetics from the event?
---
The majority are unobtainable without steam codes, like moustache Jake and Dweard.
---
Anna‚Äôs been in the woods so long, she wouldn‚Äôt even recognize her mother. She‚Äôd kill her.
---
THIS THIS THIS, ITS SUCH BULLSHIT
---
Wait long enough to post the new killer in a For Honor map to ensure confusion.
---
Detective tapp is my boy
---
Yes they are.
---
Because typing in your credit card on ebay requires so much work.
---
The new killer is not Rin‚Äôs dad??? The mask belongs to the first Yamaoka, and the entity already chose Rin over her dad. The katana master in the family was also the first Yamaoka, explaining the disappearance of the katana from the estate. Can we please stop these memes
---
And yet, I began to tire of conventional extravagance.
---
Is he complaining about that? Dont think so black and white, there is more to do as a survivor other than looping and being immersed.
---
She doesn't move grass. I've tested it in kyf and in a normal match when I randomly matched with my friend on survivor.
---
She doesn't move grass, corn, bamboo, nothing.

They weren't hard, but they took time. Legacy obviously significantly more, but it's still just a time investment. Regardless of the amount, I don't like the idea of releasing something that took some players time and effort to the community for free.
---
Ah crap I collected to 800k bp :(
---
I know nothing other than star scream is a traitorous prick and that other guy has tron in his name
---
Then why not a lever like on gates? Why does your solution require an extra gen of time plus finding gens, plus finding hatch? On top of that, can the killer close the hatch still? Seems ridiculously in favor of the killer current way
---
BHVR, do not give away the event cosmetics.
---
Hex screennames always make me laugh. 
---
My favorite was Hex: Post-Nut Clarity
---
PepeLaugh imagine spending 900$ on golden feng and then everybody gets it for free.
---
They didn't know PepeLaugh
---
weirdly exciting? yes
---
It's probably meant to nerf her "stand still and watch" tactics.
---
I don't really agree with it, but these changes force her to actually start using her power sooner in order to catch up with a survivor, meaning survivors can start trying to juke Spirit sooner after she stops moving.
---
As much as a lot of people hate the old event cosmetics being given out I'm extremely grateful to be able to actually get them now having been in the hospital and missing out on them. Thanks BHVR!
---
This was like literally the biggest complaint people had about her and they didn‚Äôt even touch it lol
---
And it's fuckin deserved, collision was so cheap. I fucking love devs so much
---
Can someone please explain the difference between tames donkey jacket and untamed donkey jacket for david

Devs tomorrow: ‚Äú*Spirit nerf 2: Electric Boogaloo*‚Äù

Haha, survivor r bad, give karma.

Ikr?

May as well throw my Propain (and Propain Accessories) hammer in the bin...

Why crouch instead of walking?

Look man, I know she‚Äôll be cucked soon enough, but tonight I party.

Legion can be unlocked with play time.

For me Pig is more fun than Ghostface.
---
Maybe just stop putting yourself in a situation that allows for her to do the stand still mindgame
---
I‚Äôd rather they just leave anything earnable alone. Don‚Äôt bring back legacy in any form and keep event cosmetics event exclusive
---
Ah yes outplay someone with hatch yes
---
Clearly it's not hard to guess your IQ. It's negative
---
The focus should be buffing the shit killers, not nerfing the viable ones?
---
Apothicon killer added ontop and you got yourself a banging dlc
---
Stop exposing me
---
Then you have the names switched. Nea is on Megatron and Kate is on Starscream.
---
And he's not a prick. He's a bitch. Big difference.

#TENACITY TOP TIER PERK CHANGE MY MIND
---
Her ambush is just a longer lunge, change my mind.
---
So.... if they don‚Äôt complete the 2 ‚Äúhatch gens‚Äù what would happen.  The game is held hostage AGAIN, like what happened before.
---
Don't expect support here, this subreddit is basically a killer cieclejerk. Just read one of the 10000 posts that complain about "toxic survivors"...
---
Why don‚Äôt the just release revolted ones for everyone so the people that grinded them out are still noticeable? Like what sea of thieves did with dukes market
---
I asked a dev about that, and I'm paraphrasing, but essentially they're unlikely to release further stats because of the vocal negative response to the last set.
---
It's a shame, because I really love that kind of information, but I can see the logic - why go to the effort of extracting and parsing the data into nice charts when people are going to loudly insist that the information is either heavily massaged or simply an outright fabrication?
---
(Huntress main on ketamine) So will huntress get buff to recover hatchets stucks from the ground and cetain walls.
---
Did they change her going into phase animation?
---
so they really did say that? thatd be so stupid
---
Steveeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnn!
---
Fun fact, it feels off cause it‚Äôs technically not the Scream Ghostface costume. In the movies the arm flaps are two seperate pieces on each arm both with two forked ends not single jagged Doritos shapes like this cosmetic (have a look at them whilst he‚Äôs chasing Drew Barrymore outside in the first movie). Scream Ghostface also has cuffs that are closed around his wrists with some kind of tie so they don‚Äôt slip down his arms instead of the jagged ones seen here and a Velcro sealed opening down the front so the hood is a tighter fit.
---
This cosmetic is actually the Funworld Ghostface halloween costume (that weirdly is used for random shots and scenes, mainly close ups, in the films) that you can buy yourself. It‚Äôs a significantly lower quality costume than the main movie one
---
Exactly, it's so easy with him.
---
People are gonna bitch. Just wait and see.
---
Still bullshit BHVR is giving away EARNED EVENT COSMETICS
---
Maybe. Another round of stats from devs would be nice to see
---
I think Ghostface is the best option. The Pig has her moments, but she tends to be frustrating, due to the random nature of RBTs and how often she keeps getting mini-nerfed by the Devs (though they recently buffed her crouch), and the Legion is in a very poor spot right now in terms of balance. You'll have fun at first, but you get bored fast, and then you have a killer with very little power or ability. Ghostface, on the other hand, has a ton of options available to him for fun games, with lots of builds and add-on combos working very well with his loadout. Even if you aren't that experienced, Ghostface's Night Shroud hides your terror radius and red stain, two important tools for new players that have now been robbed. To top all of this off, The Legion and The Pig come with survivors in their DLC's, though they are not the best. Ghostface's DLC is a bit cheaper as a result. If you only care about the killer, Ghostface is worth it. Don't buy the DLC via steam, because the bonus you get for paying a bit extra is a robe with white highlights (which makes you easier to see), and a knife with a white handle (barely noticeable). However, if you want a DLC package with a killer and survivor, it's a toss-up. Legion is not very good, while Jeff has some fun perks and is an enjoyable survivor. The Pig is in a decent spot, but Tapp is not a great survivor as time goes on. For a newer player, though, Legion will be easier to learn and use, while Tapp has perks perfect for newer players. It's all up to you.
---
No collision in phase walk, she now has a vault animation, and some addon changes like prayer beads having a global sound fx instead of none at all.
---
Its okay not your fault, i hope bhvr works an idea out though.. would be nice
---
And a gift to those who missed out on the cosmetics but play and support the game
---
I‚Äôm not really a killer player, so I did that one by tricking the survivors into thinking that I‚Äôd be generous to let them do their objectives. They were all at the exit gates, powering it up, and as soon as it opened, I hit a few of them with NOED and ended up sacrificing 3 of them. I‚Äôm so sorry, Dwights! :‚Äô(
---
Fuck. I forgot negation was the grey boi and star scream a colorful boi.
---
did you have it activated
---
agreed. granted theyd be able to be done quick enuff that there could be 2x as many, but yes itd be nice to do the bloodpoints one as u do the healing-others one, for exmaple
---
Yeah, that's probably why it's less toxic, and it also adds to it that I feel leaving a league game is a lot more punishing with the LP and honor losses, so once you're in a game, you're kinda just stuck there with everyone for 30+ minutes, no matter how they flame or grief.
---
How is that grinding lmao
---
Imagine reaching this far to blame survivors for killer‚Äôs deciding to camp. üíÄüíÄ
---
Your drawing style is the cutest. Loved your previous stuff too. Please keep them coming. &lt;3
---
Just play ghost face
---
I bought Ghostface and The Pig during their last sale and so far, The Pig has been very fun. Ghostface can be, but it's way more difficult to be impactful, especially now since everyone runs Spinechill. It can be a straight forward killer, if you ignore the stealth part of him and just use his power to hide your red stain.
---
I love Legion's perks but I absolutely hate how the killer is designed. I didn't liked it when it was stronger and I didn't like him now.
---
My advice would be to get The Pig. It's a fun killer plus Surveillance and Make Your Choice are good perks, Hang Man's Trick is not that great. David Tap, the survivor you get with that DLC is also pretty great, he looks cool and his perks are fun.
---
Spirit can see scratch marks when shes phasing.
---
Tapp mains all go to heaven
---
Imagine. Caring about karma. My comment could go - and ill keep it up. I really don't care. 
---
Survivors are easy targets because they often lack any form of intelligence.
---
I've had this idea for a For Honor/DBD crossover with Apollyon as a killer with the faction vanguards as survivours, being able to swap each of them around similar to the legion. I have no clue what any of their powers/perks would be though, but I think it would be really neato.
---
Wow... no door for the Pig? Is this a new era for this subreddit?
---
Depends on intention. Are they doing it out of fear and a desire to live, or rather to sate a kind of sadistic desire to watch the survivors perish? If it‚Äôs the latter that would show some kind of corruption in the survivor‚Äôs sense of morality, which the entity definitely has a hard-on for.
---
It does seem possible for survivors to become killers, as teased by the alchemist‚Äôs lore; though, to be honest, the easiest solution to a survivor binding and experimenting on your killers is probably just to make them a flower addict and switch them over.
---
The only exclusive that was actually a grind was legacy and its staying exclusive
---
Good spirits will always wreck survivors and I‚Äôm totally fine with that! But bad spirits who rely on lazy mechanics like collision and prayer beads will no longer. I also play Spirit quite a lot, I‚Äôm very happy with these changes.
---
Theres nothing stopping you from triggering the egc yourself bud
---
I main Spirit when I play killer, actually. You'd know that if you read any of my other comments. I'm more than happy with the changes and I'm glad they didn't nuke her from orbit like Legion. And I'm interested to try her with no collision on PTB as I think it's actually a buff in certain circumstances (as I've stated).
---
Yakuyoke nerf is bullshit though. That's the only one I'm completely opposed to as it shows up in bloodwebs far too much for how useless it is about to become. Essentially it's now going to become Vanity Mirror 2.0, completely useless add-on to clog your bloodwebs and a trap for new players.
---
And streamer stuff
---
I've only been able to blind a killer once. Flashlights are hard as hell for me to use, but I'm still relatively new. Rank 16 surv, 19 killer, account 53.
---
Thanks, I need to test it myself tho. I always avoided grass when playing Spirit lol.
---
Everyone talking about Prayer Beads and the exclusive cosmetics.
---
Meanwhile I'm sitting here and think...So how excactly does it fix the "pallet-scenario" ?
---
Like, she has a vault animation now. Nice. But that wasn't the main issue of the reactive counterplay lacking features. The BY FAR worst one is once there's a dropped pallet between the Spirit and the Survivor.
---
If the pallet ain't as godly as a shack pallet, a phase can easily cut off the survivor from behind, regardless of the loop being "safe" in general or not.
---
As a wraith player, I can tell you he does. He feels bad about how loud the bell is. Stop making fun of him.
---
What a perfect Screenshot
---
I think he could do with a slightly and a mean very slightly longer chainsaw(not attack) cool-down after a chainsaw then maybe buffs to those add-ones that reduce it. Whiffed chainsaws would mean more to the survivors, he would also patrol egc gates less easily etc.
---
Yeah the quests usually cause people to not work on gens but there is really no other way to go about it. They can't make every challenge a variation of "Do this gen this way." Just how it is once the next level gets released. It all normalizes after a few days/a week though and it's back to normal.
---
One person could have sacraficed to let the other escape so the fact that they refused to move or do anything was their own undoing.
---
Just shows people don't pay attention to their surroundings. Prayer Beads still didn't keep crows from flying and grass from moving.
---
Killers these days post how SIIIIICK it was when they caught this TAAAXIC survivor who waited at the gate.
---
It's super fucking gross.
---
Survivors have waited and given hits since the game started, and someone somewhere convinced people it's toxic, and now idiots are taking advantage of it.
---
I only give hits when the killer was cool and I'll fall out of the map or have two health states these days.
---
So stupid.
---
Neat, free stuff is always cool.
---
Yeah ill be honest here. I absolutely hate spirit, most unfun Killer to play against and even i would want to wait to see how this turns out before doing anything else to her
---
Problem is, it would be a very big balance change. I'm not sure BHVR will do anything about it.
---
"What are you waiting for?!"
---
"I dunno a spirit nerf I guess..."
---
ur a gatekeeper
---
May this man lay to rest now and be held ever so warmly in the sweet embrace in all that is holy. Hallowed be his name!
---
what joaco said, also you lose emblem points if near a hook that will most likely result in a loss, if you want to get better you should learn to apply pressure around the map
---
search fungoose on youtube, he is a killer main that plays both sides and is probably the best educational dbd player out there, he explains every decision he does
---
*Spirit gets fucking deleted*
---
That's unlucky, they dropped fairly often for me, more or less every 2-3 bloodwebs.
---
Got plenty of them as I leveled to 50. Now I'm sitting at 16 Wards and 9 prayers so basically 25 prayers.
---
Second option
---
Dark sense is my go to dwight perk because hes just lvl 33
---
Go to forum.deadbydaylight.com and the November 2019 Developer Update should be the first thing you see. They mention that they're gonna give all players the previous Ultra Rare and Event exclusive cosmetics for free because of scammers and stuff.
---
I'm glad everyone will have a chance to obtain these cosmetic pieces, but I feel like just giving them out for free is almost a spit in the face to everyone who previously obtained them.
---
Zetsubou No Shima
---
Ghost boy big is really fun too
---
DS is active even if you aren't the Obsession. They changed it, so it doesn't matter if you're the Obsession or not, it will work the same way: you get to Decisive Strike the killer if they pick you up after a certain amount of time. Your struggle might be the timer itself: if it runs out, you will not get the DS prompt. You will also receive the prompt even if you aren't the Obsession, but you'll become the Obsession if you DS the killer (likewise, if someone else performs a DS on the killer, they become the obsession). No worries, friend, it can be a tad confusing sometimes. It only works once! Remember that.
---
It‚Äôs because some people were scamming people claiming to sell them the cosmetics only to get a code that‚Äôs was already claimed. The only way they can stop it is to give the cosmetics out to every one.
---
It‚Äôs a clean pure white like in the movies instead of the dirtier weathered off-white default version. It‚Äôs basically just there for people who want the more movie look. It also only cost 200 cells since the devs know it‚Äôs just a recolour
---
People still worked their asses off for those event things though. That's like giving everyone the Hallowed Blight cosmetics just because it's Halloween.
---
Nah the Event Cosmetics were a grind as well. Just not an unhumanly one.
---
I main Spirit, run Stridor and I think last night out of 12 or so matches I had only one that wasn't a Merciless Victory, on Rank Reset (aka SWF) day no less.

Didn't they say they were never going to make the legacy stuff non-exclusive?
---
Well i was thinking maybe like subtitles or something when you are in a proximity of the sound? Like a handicap option, for injured breathing, generators being worked on, obvious noises that are easier for others to hear
---
There is a finite supply of red pixels a screen can display.
---
Give us legacy back!!!
---
When was spirit and Nurse gutted?  I‚Äôd like to know enlighten me please.  Spirit is getting quality of life changes because she was over performing.
---
Lol they never stated any of this. Just said that they had a single game where the SWFs were acting like tools. Even if they didn‚Äôt claim all SWFs act this way, a large majority of them still do.
---
New killer is gonna punch through borrowed time with a sudden and unexpected flurry of unblockables
---
Please use the pinned Megathread.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are the obsession or not. DS now triggers when the killer picks you up instantly so they can‚Äôt dribble or swing to make you miss. Maybe your DS just runs out. It‚Äôs definitely not bugged
---
Well, you tried.
---
Not really, no. What does it even matter that you have a skin nobody else has? Do you think the players around you care? They don't, really. I have a few of these exclusives, and I'm completely fine with them being available for everyone. Not everyone was playing when they were around, and now everyone has them. They're just pixels on a screen.
---
The wiggle mechanism was removed, ds is now fully anti tunnel perk.
---
If your unhooked and the killer downs you and picks you up within that window. The ds skill check will pop up giving you and opportunity to get away.
---
And then that's it no more ds you have one use on it.
---
Or you can save it for your next hook up to you.
---
Unhooked
---
60 second timer before DS deactivates
---
Killer downs you 15 seconds in
---
Get picked up
---
Skill check
---
You miss decisive is wasted
---
You hit decisive works and doesn't activate again for the rest of the trial
---
Rip my dweard and big hat for Ace
---
Imagine, you're a Killer, beginning your day of murders in the name of the Entity, but then, some newcomer Survivor you come across just screams "INCREDIIIBILIS" and start punching you.
---
green key just works with addons and does not open the hatch
---
purple key opens the hatch but have a minuscule duration to any other uses 
---
red key opens the hatch and pair well with addons
---
As someone who does not purchase stuff unless I can pay in shards, I feel I should ask for permission to be happy about this or not from you. I don‚Äôt wanna rub it in is all.
---
That shouldn‚Äôt affect the e ent cosmetics though
---
When you've been unhooked, a 60 second (for the Level 3 version of the perk) timer starts counting down. You can visually see it tick down over the perk icon.
---
If you are picked up/grabbed/pulled out of a locker during this period, a skill check appears.
---
If you hit it, you escape the killer's grasp and the perk is deactivated for the rest of the trial.
---
If you miss it, the perk fails to activate, you don't escape the killer's grasp, and the perk is deactivated for the rest of the trial.
---
If you intentionally don't press anything during the skill check, neither hitting or missing until the skill check disappears, the perk is saved and can be reused the next time you are unhooked.
---
Thank you.
---
The event ones are bs, but the others are sorta justified. Console players never had a chance to get those code ones. But those events were here on console, so those are sorta bullshit.
---
or spoopy myers...tier 1 mirror myers gets easy grabs on maps like lerys hawkins and the game
---
When she stands still, she's doing one of two things.
---
1. Making a beeline for your location. If you're in an open area, it's probably this.
---
2. She's just standing still, trying to make you think she's using her power. If you're playing a tile, this is most likely the case.
---
If she's faking, she's going to keep observing you until she feels like she knows where you're going to go.
---
You can, however, force/bait her into phasing.
---
1. If you just start running away, she has to phase quickly or she won't be able to catch up before her power runs out.
---
2. If you break LOS for a couple seconds, she can't observe/track you without phasing after you.
---
3. If you run in a direction for a few seconds, she'll feel like she knows where you're going.
---
The best advice I can give is to play Spirit and familiarize with how she plays.
---
Just don't lollygag around in front of the Husk waiting for her to make her move, and for the love of god please don't vault towards the Husk, because I guaran-fucking-tee you that every time you try doing that, she'll wind up never having moved from that spot.
---
You're like mixing old and new DS together in the weirdest way.
---
Right now, DS activates for 60 seconds after you've been unhooked, if you are downed and picked up within those 60 seconds, you get a skill check regardless of Obsession status. Landing the skill check stuns the Killer for 5 seconds and gives you a free escape.
---
Please just fix Medic on PS4
---
But what are the other uses?
---
Scummy as shit and I'm thoroughly dissapointed (but not the least bit surprised) at the ridiculous amount of support you're getting for this in the comments.  It doesn't get much scummier than what you did to those survivors.  Trapping players like that and for that amount of time isn't remotely cool.  The threads on this post just serve to prove the insane amount of bias that exists for killer bm on this sub.  If it's a survivor burn them at the stake.  If it's a killer erect a monument in their honor and parade them around the town square.  Absolutely absurd.
---
performing over what they expected for her on her release
---
Its a tricky perk to understand. After you are unhooked and you have a timer of 60 seconds where if you are downed and picked up in that time it will trigger the skill check. Note the timer still keeps going regardless if you are downed or not so many killers will slug you if they think you have that perk. It only works one time and can work on any down you occur as long as it happens with 60 seconds of being unhooked. It has nothing to do with being the obsession or not though having the perk is much more likely to make you the obsession.
---
No, I mean it is a fundamentally bad power from a mechanical standpoint. It is a power to let the killer do what the survivors while still moving faster and with minimal commitment, which completely negates most options survivors have in a chase. There's really no way to balance that in a way that is satisfactory for both sides.
---
There's no real survivor response to Feral Frenzy. Legion uses it, so you get hit because there's not much you can do to stop it, then you either mend or don't based on whether or not Legion leaves. Since getting your hits is pretty much guaranteed, BHVR is very limited in how they can buff Legion without making them oppressive.
---
Their current solution kinda illustrates that - you can't do lethal damage in feral frenzy leaving the power weak and nonthreatening. Your power lasts a while but you don't get a very large speed boost because otherwise no one around you would ever get away. Like it's better than it was when Legion was about as weak but also completely brain dead, but it's not much better.
---
Real shit
---
Maybe he‚Äôll start throwing more than pebbles now. Maybe his own shit
---
I'm sorry I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I started it and couldn't stop lol. Gave me all those hearty chuckles.
---
Lost mine, emailed bhvr for 2 years and still got the same answer
---
I'm pretty sure we aren't getting them back.
---
The code ones? Yeah, those should be given to everyone. The player base was alot smaller when the Dweard and other cosmetics were given out with steam codes. Lots of people couldn't even get them because they were console, and lots of people scammed others by offering these for like 200 dollars when they actually didn't have it.
---
The event ones? Those should be exclusives. People worked for those and they should keep their hard work. It was very cool to see people who had those, as it shows skill. If they aren't exclusive to those who worked hard for them they don't mean anything.
---
I found a bubba who had his psn profile all about facecamping. I asked him who hurt him but he didnt reply.
---
Entirely reasonable mindgame.
---
I agree that her addons are broken and the nerfs on those are fair and good. Also the vault animation. But if you don‚Äôt use collision a lot, it means you either use strider and is very good at spirit or you played her incorrectly. Collision is a very big nerf but it‚Äôs a good thing because now you need to track people with listening and predicting instead of pressing w. Which requires more skill and gives room for survivors to get away. You also missed one of most important part which is the nerf to her lunge distance. But we cannot know exactly how influential that will be until the patch is live.
---
Lol this is great.  Fully agree too.  They're just babies they're still learning their shapes and colors at yellow rank.  If you get camped up there expect it and let it roll right off you.  Salt is pointless at those ranks.  They don't understand what they're even doing.
---
Doctor with skill check builds will give you lots of visual cues on less-experienced survivors. His addons put the stain on survivors, show auras, show hallucinated doctors, so you're less reliant on audio cues to know who's where.
---
&gt; Im trying to find a killer to play that people don‚Äôt hate versing
---
This option probably isn't on the table. You can relax in your games if you sense folks are having difficulty, but playing anybody well is going to frustrate somebody. My rule is typically all four stacks of BBQ, a few extra hooks here and there, and then casually chase - doesn't matter who I'm playing, seems like everyone leaves happier than they might otherwise.
---
Time to sort these comments by controversial
---
It really just seems like worse base spirit. Like it might make people Gen tap during the sound, but destroys pretty much any other plays.
---
That was the third season, it was just a reboot of the show (that i like better than the first two seasons)
---
The stand still mindgame is too high caliber of gameplay to change, I understand
---
Now this pleases me
---
you look at Bubba and tell me he could run at 9.6 meters a second.
---
Points can be changed
---
Mettle absolutely deserved to be nerfed and ds wasnt nerfed it was reworked lol ur bad
---
I see no toxicity here. You didn‚Äôt teabag or click with the intention just to mock the killer for example, instead you just tried to make him target you instead of your pals. You didn‚Äôt mock the killer at gate (I‚Äôm guessing) but focused on merely escaping instead, You know, playing the game? You did nothing toxic lad, take this upvote.
---
Same, i double and triple checked out of confusion.
---
Event cosmetics should stay excusives, they should at least give people with exclusives before the end date something, like a charm or something.
---
i don't think it's fair that i spent the time putting together a cosplay and going to pax to get the dweard,chuckles cosmetics just for them to give them away by the 1000s in giveaways, but the company has been making bad decisions for years
---
hol up 
---
SIDNEYS HOUSE?!
---
Only mediocre Spirit players relied on the collision mechanics to find people in phase walk. In fact, it's more of a detriment if you're against well-coordinated SWFs since you can bodyblock a doorway to prevent her getting to an injured target.
---
Prayer Beads needed the nerf, and the change is still plenty powerful. Without being able to judge where she is during phase walk at all, you're going to have to abandon totems you're working on which will still have the desired effect of disrupting cleanse actions. You just won't get the free grab anymore, and that's fine.
---
bubba can do whatever he puts his heart to

---
Thank you for the explanation!  I‚Äôll watch some videos tonight
---
I can see how some people would say its not fun to play against. It's pretty much just a pallet mindgame. It's not an auto hit like he was saying though either.
---
It really be like that though
---
So we're agreed what you did was wrong lol.  And I have no bias man I play both sides evenly.  It's the killer side of me that's particularly disgusted with what you did.  But no I've been on this sub a long time and killer bm typically gets a lot of support around here.  It is a recurring theme.
---
Yeah maybe i should just go for 4 stacks and let people go, it seems the harder i try, the more i pip, and the more I pip, the more angry people get with me being there
---
Yeah but it's an example. I'll give a better one.
---
It's like giving people the Summer BBQ cosmetics when they were for the event.

They fixed one piece of the puzzle, I have a feeling like it's not enough. She is still gonna be wayyyy 2 easy to play

Trapper statistically is one of the top 3 killers when it comes to kills, dont tell me that trapper is top tier, the statistics are misleading because there are so many god awful players and the devs count dcs and kills in games where survivors dc as kills, in their eyes a game where two survivors dc then the other survivors get destroyed is the same as a fair game where the killer 4ks.
---
This literally makes it a mindgame.
---
Put yourself in Spirit's shoes.
---
Think when you'd phase.
---
Then, given your movements when she phased, and the scratches you've left since then, you can get a good idea of where Spirit is going to be phasing.
---
That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt mention the lunge distance.
---
As for the collision thing, I play Spirit at red ranks and constantly 4k (hence why I don‚Äôt use her as much.) The collision just seems situational. If the survivor is injured, you don‚Äôt need it. If you are playing the stand-still juke at a dropped pallet, it MAY help but even if you completely miss the survivor you can still down them when you come out of phase since they will likely be in the same side of the pallet. As I said, collision helps me out like 2-3 times per game. Who knows though? Maybe it‚Äôs a bigger deal than I think it is
---
Licensed implies it was granted to them. BHVR created them. So you‚Äôre wrong.
---
I am. It says "comment removed by moderator"
---
Not "account deleted"
---
And somehow a majority of them are more interesting then the actual licensed killers
---
So now it is just her power with wraith's bone clapper?
---
Ah gotcha, thank you
---
Well mediocre players won't be getting as many kills as good players now. They have to actually learn her power now instead of just being a bumper car. It will make her more bearable to play against.
---
God I read the map name and it hurt man I wish we had a Woodsborrow Map
---
Because there was a severe imbalance in information provided during Phasing. Here's the information both sides recieved:
---
Survivors - Non-directional "whoosh" when more than 24m from the Husk (can be removed with an add-on), Spirit stands still (although this doesn't confirm she's phasing), can bump into her.
---
Spirit - Scratchmarks, blood trail (with an add-on), moving grass, breathing (volume can be reduced by Iron Will, but increased again with Stridor), footsteps, grunts of pain, pallets dropping, locker doors moving, can bump into Survivors.
---
THAT is the problem people had. This update goes a long way to address that.
---
i agree, another clownshoes decision by this company, everyone gear up for legacy skin return coming soon probably
---
Game needs a killer who was a survivor. Like how Vigo looks in the Rift lore entries.
---
People are still crying about Ds.
---
I'm sad about the event cosmetics being listed, I just don't get that. Trying to lessen the scammers selling bad codes for the exclusives I understand but is also frustrating for people that were able to get them by attending live events/getting lucky in giveaways/etc.
---
All in all probably it's the most disappointed I've been with the devs in awhile.
---
(Although if they make Bloodletting Dwight free for everyone I may riot)
---
Is it genji yamaoka
---
How exactly would devs measure chase time? The chase mechanic is incredibly inaccurate regarding when a chase actually "ends"
---
There will always be a ‚Äústrongest killer.‚Äù The point isn‚Äôt to make her suck it‚Äôs to give her more counterplay
---
So you're saying it should be more fun to go against her right?
---
Is the challenge for a gen grab?
---
Otherwise, you can cheese this pretty easily waiting for a hurt survivor to vault when in range.
---
I actually think that would be some pretty neat gameplay.
---
I think this is probably easiest with Spirit, Michael, or Ghostface. It would be hard with prayer beads on Spirit because any time house them, it guarantees a 4 person DC. So fucking stupid.
---
I‚Äôm still waiting to see how those turn out. They may potentially be the ones that actually make a difference. Too early to tell tbh
---
I'm sure Jake's Dad was a good guy too, he just wanted to see his son succeed.
---
these comics are always so cute. I love it, take my upvote op
---
It‚Äôd be so cool to have that play as your RBT ticks away
---
YwY
---
Wraith is already in the game.
---
I didn‚Äôt come on here asking for sympathy or opinions on what I did. I asked if I would get banned. :/ Yell at the other people for their opinions if ur mad, not me.
---
I love how nurse and spirit got slight changes after being proved many times they where (and still are) broken. But as soon as they are touched people act like they got MOM'ed. 
---
Billy is perfect, the only things that need to be changed about him Is insta saw.
---
I literally have clicked the page that give you lore once. So I‚Äôm not an idiot. I didn‚Äôt know it was only about trapper and Claudette. Jesus.
---
Do interrupts also count? Because it's pretty common to grab someone vaulting a window or jumping out of a locker when they try to locker juke you.
---
Still not sure what you're talking about but the main reason I think people should just be able to purchase Ultra Rare and previously exclusive Event cosmetics in the store instead of getting them for free is because:
---
1. What's the point of a cosmetic being Ultra Rare  if all players get the cosmetics for free?
---
2. People who took the time to work for these Event outfits are getting giyped.
---
3. The Dev's already said that all Rift exclusive cosmetics will be coming to all players after a year, which would also make these outfits entering the store make sense too.
---
Eh was demanding
---
"When used correctly it is more than just a perk to heal".....
---
How lol?  That's all Self Care does.  Heal yourself very slowly and at the expense of your teamates who have to repair your gens.
---
Sorry my man, but that sounds a little worthless. I can see your reason! Say you're working on a gen by yourself and you get it. Then boom. Easy Adrenaline play. But remember the reason behind Meg's perks. Her perks are all about getting the distance in a chase. Adrenaline giving you 5 seconds of 150% speed boost is a seriously good perk in that regard. But having Adrenaline be ranged dependent is just not smart. 
---
Think of it lore wise as well! Imagine if you hear that horn/siren of the last gen being done! You fill up with this sense of "I can still get out of here alive! I have to try!" 
---
I used to be someone who thought Adrenaline was too powerful. I used to make a LOAD of Rank 20 killers DC on me and it wasn't fun half the time. In a way I wanted it to be tweaked a little so I thought "Maybe make Adrenaline like an elongated Endurance buff" So I began brainstorming. What if Adrenaline was this perk that was like a temporary shield. Like how Adrenaline works in real life. Lets be honest, Adrenaline is only this FEELING. If you've been hit by a literal chainsaw, sure, maybe Adrenaline is gonna numb that pain for a bit, but the wound is still there and it does not stop the bleeding. So I proposed this to my brother and he liked the idea of it if Adrenaline should have a nerf.
---
Adrenaline:
---
Once the generators are powered, be temporarily healed by one health state for 120 seconds and run at 150% for 5 seconds.   
---
While the perk is active and you are injured, you have the Endurance effect active. Getting hit while you have the endurance effect will put you into the deep wound effect and you will have 30 seconds to mend. Gettng hit again will put you into the dying state and deactivate the perk  
---
If the timer runs out while you are injured, you are put back into the dying state and the perk deactivates.  
---
If you are healthy and the timer runs out, you go back to being injured and the perk deactivates.
---
Huntress should be buffed to chop down dumbass trees
---
No way, those were a bitch and a half to get.
---
Never trust game companies
---
The survivor response to FF is to stun him and break him out.
---
That's not "no real response"
---
He's weak but has great style in my opinion. 
---
Unfortunately the style is the most important thing for me so I like this guy more than the last two characters but the last two were pretty good.
---
Whynotboth.jpeg
---
It's the literal definition of the word mindgame
---
*hmmmmmmmmmm*
---
That‚Äôs a good way to put it
---
I'm assuming if you're within terror radius and the spirit has prayer beads, the effect is the same when she phase walks. If you can hear her phasing during chases and stuff, it completely obliterates her chasing potential.
---
All of those should yeah. I was just stating what completed the challenge for me in the first 15 seconds of the match
---
Please just shut up. I'm tired of this meme. It's stupid and not even accurate.
---
If your biggest incentive to play this game is for cosmetic items for your characters, why play at all? Why not plays SIMS 3 or 4 or whatever?
---
Because you grinded for it, nobody else should have it, you say. Well, I say that's dumb. Not everybody was around when this game was first released, but they could have just as easily gotten these items if they had. Let everyone have them. They're just cosmetics. They don't matter.
---
And the scariest, lol
---
The Entity just beefed up Mikey's legs
---
Survivors dont know what a mindgame is.
---
Man I hate it when the killer kills me. Thats so toxic. I think Survivors are seriously underpowered /s  
---
Here, I got a spare /s for you as well my man.
---
This map is just a maze
---
I hate it
---
Oh my god I will finally be able to wear chuckles. Feel bad for my friends who bought codes though.
---
So because I'm angry with their decision to give skins I grinded, for free I'm a gatekeeper?
---
Or maybe just maybe I'm mad because not only have I lost my legacy cosmetics, but the devs are kicking me when I'm already down, for no reason.
---
Whats weird is that they already have offbrand versions of SF Claud and Dweard, they could have just continued on with those. I totally get giving them out to console players though.
---
Nurse and Spirit are still good though.
---
It's a whatever grab. Pallet, gen, totem, sabotage, vault.
---
God I need to gee in their with Franklins and Infectious Fright
---
Looks like we cant embrace the trill
---
I want ‚ÄúAnxiety anxiety‚Äù as a flair lmao
---
Hol up. There's a grab challenge? I forecast a big load of stress in my near future
---
I hope that lawsuit ends soon. It already killed F13 the game.
---
Oh right bc it's obvious the devs have not been learning how to nerf/change things properly! Insta meds, nurse, and spirit are all actually legion lvl bad now!
---
100/100
---
Better to have a few bad killers then ones that make the game unfun.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôll be ready to send an angry message post game and I‚Äôll see the rank and instead send them kind advice that facecamping is for TOXIC CANCEROUS PIECES OF TRASH AND KYS AND DELETE THIS GAME. .../s.
---
*eye of the tiger starts playing*
---
Legion was literally broken on release, nurse is still high tier and is now easier to learn, spirit is still unquestionably the best killer.
---
Yeah its bugged I think, I'll but it when they fix it
---
I didn't get my account reset 4 times for this shit
---
I don‚Äôt know how to explain what my question was at this point. Here it is in seperate... words I guess
---
Can I be happy
---
That I‚Äôm getting free event stuff
---
Or will this be an insult
---
To veterans who got it beforehand?
---
you sound mad af, tbh this changes are great for her
---
Why would her mom be a better hunter than huntress? Huntress survived nearly her whole life hunting by herself. Presumably huntresses mother had her own mother or husband and child helping her hunt. 
---
Huntress didnt have anybody else to help so if she didnt bring food back herself she wouldn't of had any.
---
centurion as a new killer, he just yells INCREDIBILIS and combos you the rest of the game
---
YEET
---
Turns out when developers actually fix sound in the game after it being broken for months on end, the Spirit mains who adapted to those trying times are now basically Super Saiyans.
---
Same lol. I take those little grassless paths when prayer beadsing around.
---
I've always wanted to have 300 spoopy items. Finally reached it this grind. Feels great.
---
come on, the changes are great
---
Extremely niche example.  90% of the time this post holds up.  Tunneling is to blame for the overwhelming majority of d strikes.
---
Translation: Us switchers are the lowest of priorities, and will miss out on the event and archives.
---
I use corrupt, thanatophobia, pop goes the weasel and bbq. Got to rank 1 with this.
---
Give veterans like 30,000 auric cells as compensation. I‚Äôm no veteran but I feel it would be just barely a suitable compensation.
---
The difference between the toxicity in DBD to other game is its kinda a loud minority like I mean really loud you can mean like the coolest dude over dbd but then there‚Äôs the cunts and there‚Äôs a lot of cunts and they are the most toxic people I‚Äôve ever seen in any game
---
I feel like you cropped out your devotion on purpose lol
---
Its like every game you have some nice people and people who wanna be dicks. You will get better enjoy the game.
---
plenty of games have cosmetics as rewards for playing the game, sims is a bad example because there's no grind to it. there's nothing different from me when i started playing at launch now to someone just buying the game sans legacy skins now and it's pretty shitty feeling. who cares if they weren't around back then, that's the point of it? if you don't play a game because they had exclusive events years before you started playing you literally wouldn't be able to play about 90% of online games.
---
and that's my point, nothing matters in this game anymore, like why should i even buy the battle pass and level it up when i know and they've said they're just gonna release it all in the store anyways? when you've played this game for years and you realize it takes 6 months for anything eventful to happen, why bother?
---
It wasn't complaining, it was legitimate criticism. There's a difference.
---
I'm not mad lol, I'm glad these are coming. But I'm more glad that people are finally gonna shut up about her.
---
I don‚Äôt think this would be a great idea. People could just do the challenges and when they‚Äôre about to lose their items, they shut off their internet just to keep them.
---
Ghostface or Freddy. You can try out Freddy and Pig with splinters from the bloodweb. Freddy is probably the best killer besides spirit and nurse and people hate him a little bit less. Ghost face is a little bit behind him.
---
I agree with you on this. You can't win or lose with this community, everyone finds something to bitch about.
---
Eat my ass, spirit mains. ü§§
---
I made over 1.5k trading codes around a year ago, it was amazing
---
His power would be a giant leap attack that allows him to get to higher ground or to get over obstacles.
---
Me when wraith brings coxcombed + ghost
---
Manipulated*
---
At the end of the day these people are still responsable. Regardless of whether or not they snapped - Rins father murdered two weaker than himself and Sally strangled those unable to care for themselves.
---
Can‚Äôt they just put a filter like shooting games? Like blood/gore off and on?
---
Yeah, it's most likely that this guy's xbox has been treated rough or damaged somehow. I don't think it's  dbd issue
---
I dunno man, I don't see people instantly DCing as soon as they hear the phasing sound as fair or legitimate critique of the game.
---
Hero Feng, i dig it.
---
Shame everyone that plays her is cunt
---
I play a ton of killer and can tell you only bad killers consistently have issues with DS.  For those of us that never tunnel those are mostly 3 perk survivors.  If they throw themselves at you in an obvious ds play you slug for pressure and continue with your day.  EZ PZ.  Your statements about DS needing nerfs are absurd.
---
Just had a thought... What if when you hit someone instead of them bleeding you have the option to teleport to one of the other players (where they were standing even you got a hot, not following them) in range? It would have that aesthetic of a "legion", like they're everywhere but the ability ends after a teleport.
---
Going off of what they said in the dev update, it was to stop the resale of cosmetics at ridiculous prices on eBay and allow console players to use them. RIP original exclusive owners though.
---
They over killed the addons nerfa imo. Prayer beads is great but the rest were not really needed .
---
The rest of it seems great tho
---
Legion really just needs add-on changes and some slight tweaks, bubba, doctor and clown are the big three that could really use some love.
---
I used to play on a pretty low sensitivity in all my games. Little over 2 months ago I was like fuck it, I need to crank this up so I can get better, I started with DBD and cranked my sensitivity up from 30% all the way to 100%
---
I got trashed for like the next 3 days, but then I started getting used to it and now I can control it perfectly fine. It's really upped my game, not just in DBD but my other games now as well. Playing certain Killers like Billy, Nurse, and Huntress on console are pretty different experiences on console (note my flair) and I feel like if you can get used to higher sensitivities, do it. Ever since I upped it my Nurse game has been better than ever, and I love every game I play.
---
Hmm. I see your point. I suppose you could play something else and never return to DBD while the rest of us enjoy the actual game, not just it's cosmetics.
---
I try to get the hell out of those low ranks fast as I can. It‚Äôs all campers and tunnels. Which I understand if they‚Äôre new.
---
Meg‚Äôs mom was amazing, raised Meg by herself and provided for her.
---
Claudette‚Äôs parents are supportive, and want her to have a good life.
---
Jake‚Äôs mom cared about him. His father wanted the best for him, but it wasn‚Äôt the best for Jake himself.
---
Kate‚Äôs family encouraged her singing.
---
Jane‚Äôs father raised his child and encouraged her to pursue her acting and entertainment.
---
Adam‚Äôs dad while strict taught him lessons.
---
Huntress‚Äôs mother sacrificed herself for her daughter.
---
Those are the only good parents off of the top of my head.
---
Jane‚Äôs mom, Loretta Lawrence, wasn‚Äôt very nice.
---
Meg‚Äôs father left when she was a baby.
---
Trapper‚Äôs dad wasn‚Äôt good because his company was bad.
---
Clown‚Äôs father blamed Clown for the death of his wife. Drank to cope.
---
Plague was abandoned.
---
Spirit‚Äôs father is arguable. While he is genuinely negative, he worked hard to keep the place his family lived.
---
I have 100% on both killer and survivor
---
Would you be happy with a charm just for you guys?
---
It's not a mindgame if you aren't doing anything.
---
Standing still and reacting to what the survivor does is not a mindgame
---
I mean, they got to use it for all this time, so it's not wasted, they grinded to have it early
---
very early
---
My mains when I log in and they realize they‚Äôre about to die for a few hours
---
Okay thank you! I think this is the deciding comment
---
I think the previous exclusive Ultra Rare and Event cosmetic pieces should be added to the in-game Store, instead of being given to everyone for free because:
---
2. People who either already purchased the Ultra Rare cosmetics or took the time to work for the Event cosmetics are getting giyped.
---
3. The Dev's already said that all Rift exclusive cosmetics will be added to the in-game Store after a year, which would also make these outfits entering the store make sense too.
---
The head trap is activated when a generator is completed.
---
Yeah nothing would be more annoying than to find a killer who you think is farming just to have him dc after ten minutes into the game.
---
Did I miss something here. You don‚Äôt leave scratch marks when you‚Äôre walking. In fact, if you wanna see your own scratch marks, just run fixated (a Nancy perk) and you‚Äôll know what it looks like. Anyways, spirit got a huge nerf to the ground with addons and phasing reappearance speed and vault animation and collision. Basically all rounded nerf. Now nobody complains. Wait no, now we complain about Freddy‚Äôs dream fking pallets that makes me scared of every pallet on the map.
---
100/100. In general it‚Äôs good to get used to high sens when using a controller
---
Entity pleased
---
Hell, could do that, you could have Legion summon the other members like minions, or set them to ambush people, there's just a lot more potential options that haven't been covered compared to the very crowded mechanical spaces of "is fast" and "negates loops".
---
Literally who cares, it's the equivalent of tbagging
---
And you got the item exclusively for a long time and that‚Äôs great, i‚Äôd like to encourage you to be happy that now everyone can share your good looks, and you should continue to be proud that you had the item long before anyone who got it for free.
---
My favorite part of any patch cycle in this game is how often people expose themselves as having played the game for less than two years. 
---
"UGH all these Killer nerfs... I guess they have to cater to Survivors to make this game not die.. When will Killers ever get positive CHANGES?!?!?". 
---
It just becomes so blatantly obvious this person knows absolutely nothing about 2016/2017 DbD. Back when flashlights had insta-blinds, killers couldn't kick gens, BNP 100% completed a generator, gens took 40 seconds on default to repair, pallet and vacuum vaults were completely out of control, entity blockers didn't exist, self care being affected by We'll Make It (and just generally taking around 10 seconds to heal), etc.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwdg8o/hmmmmmmmm_5_survivors_0_killer_bug_game_got/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I find that, by default, the flashlight always "aims" higher than I think its going to - aiming down a bit helped me hit the face more often. But I still suck lol
---
The question is who will bitch louder, the people who play as her or those playing against her.
---
It‚Äôs a good one even on other killers. Most survivors assume you‚Äôre always in motion so stopping fucks with their expectation of your position. Notably Ghostface while shroud is active or wraith in niche situations.
---
That was the biggest complaint bad players had. The second biggest complaint is that Huntress can injure them from far away.
---
you have nice ping because if that was me juking, all of those would hit LMAO
---
Top panel: this meme a month ago when Joker came out
---
Bottom panel: Reddit
---
I literally made a post like three hours ago saying Prayer Beads should give you global phasing sound. I‚Äôm a got damn PreCog.
---
This reminds me of the idiots who bought savini jason for hundreds of dollars. I did feel bad for the backers though.
---
Plague better be watching her back because I‚Äôve started hearing survivors complaining about her same thing with Freddy
---
The only solution would be to make all killers AI so it can be run circles around by the survivors.  
---
People forget that it's a 4 player VS 1 PLAYER game. If the survivors can find and use cheesy and cheap methods of winning, so can the killers.
---
&gt;That's not "no real response". Situational, but not nonexistent like you say
---
Except that doesn't work because unless you were really far away when he started the frenzy he can simply respect the pallet then catch up to you with 5 m/s speed (125%) if you dont drop it or vault it and then hit you if you do.
---
you did? I don't know, maybe it's a trap, you trapper!
---
that's most likely my plan at this point, the new killer is pretty disappointing to me and it's gonna be another 6 months before we see another one, and they also stated they're never going to do anything beyond offerings for any future events, so the staleness will only get worse.
---
also i did enjoy the game and that's why i grinded the cosmetics for it, now somebody who wasn't interested at all gets the same reward i spent 80+ hours grinding for
---
Lol well, I just heard that we should try to aim at the neck, and it just kinds of work out more often than not. I'm playing killer now, though. Gonna try this some other time.
---
Quality of life changes because she was over performing? You mean a nerf
---
Even with these changes she‚Äôs still gonna get you.
---
My opinion is that the majority of the time if you would be literally running into someone you will hear their footsteps/breathing.
---
I see this making almost no difference tbh but if it will make people stop complaining about her I'm all for it. I think the window animation is a better change.
---
It's literally not.
---
News flash, sometimes you have to but add-ons you don't like when leveling up killers.
---
How will we survive?
---
Aw man you cant loop the killer all day in a 1v4 game.
---
Killers like to have fun and win too.
---
I think the game killed the game. It was already dead, in the coffin and being lowered 6 feet deep. The lawsuit was just the dirt to fill the hole back up.
---
Ghost Face
---
Oh, yeah. You could have a legion appear behind each player similar to the doctor illusions that you have the option to teleport to. You're in danger of being teleported towards until they disappear.
---
Personally I don't like the idea of ambushes. It would be too similar to either the trapper if they just damage you or hag if you teleport when someone triggers one.
---
Even the ones I don't like would be better than what we got. The idea behind his power needs to be scrapped.
---
Legit I always wanted Richtofen as a survivor.
---
Exactly!
---
Plus their excuse of grey market sellers. Do they not realize they are causing more damage to the people who bought their clothes from it? 
---
On top of that, legacy accounts are sold but we get no free legacy?
---
I don't see what you're saying. I work full-time and go to school full-time. I often go a couple days without playing the game, and when I do play the game, I don't have all the time in the world. I am perfectly on track to complete the rift.  I got like 15 levels just from finishing the tier 1 tome challenges, and the tier 2 give more fragments than the tier 1.
---
I also do not mind challenges. The entire point of a challenge is to be challenged. If that means I need to hustle to search some chests, then I need to do that. And if I die that game, whoopty doo. It's a video game. I lost a match. I think I'll live. It's not that serious.
---
I'm having the best time with these rifts. I'm playing in different ways to complete the challenge, using perks I wouldn't use, I'm making great progress, getting cool items, and I love the lore pieces. I like to have structure to my gaming, and the archives add great structure. I'm not defending all the challenges, because some are certainly ridiculous, but I'm happy and do not get the hate for the archives.
---
Yeah Ive been using legions cause the high light literally saves my life, its the only reason i can kill anybody, survivors tbag and what not even knowing that if i dont land the stab with frenzy chances are theyll get away, i wish legion didnt exit frenzy when he missed or lost scratch marks, scratch marks and his effect are basically the only ways i find people, i also run discordance and bbq but closets destroy me since i cant hear them
---
Adam is my favorite, got him p3 with most perks. I would love for a meme skin like shirtless David for Adam
---
Shhh dont tell feng I have her phone.
---
Yes.
---
also i appreciate you not having an instantly confrontational response unlike everybody else so far, thank you
---
Isn't chat always open anyhow?
---
You did the big funny
---
He literally said prayer beads is OP and needed nerfing all the time
---
Moris aren't even *close*. They have requirements to enable their use, they can't be looted on the map in question, you have a pre-match indicator that they're (likely) in play, and they're killer-side which means you can't just play keepaway to let you take the win. 
---
Moris aren't perfect or anything. They're clearly once-in-awhile things that skew the game in the killer's favor by enabling quicker eliminations that can snowball the game. But they don't reward poor play or punish good play the way keys do. They don't create an alternate objective that runs counter to the primary objective the way keys do (you're doing the same thing you always do - chase and attempt to down survivors). 
---
All this being said, I would sacrifice moris in an instant if it meant keys got removed as well. That's such an easy choice it's not even worth thinking about.
---
theres a perk for that kiddo
---
I'm going to miss my big hat for Ace being exclusive it was a small cosmetic but I love it dearly
---
How about it‚Äôs an map wide sound that only the survivors who‚Äôs been marked hears so he doesn‚Äôt know where GF is but he knows he‚Äôs been marked and also the other survivors aren‚Äôt tipped off its Ghost Face right off the back
---
üò∞üò∞
---
Yeah i tried plague for awhile i mainly play legion cause his frenzy effect lets me find people hiding without sound queues its my only way, ive tried freddy and man am i bad on him lol
---
*HELL YES TO THE SPIRIT CHANGES*
---
Steve: becomes god 
---
DANNY(ghostface): "I'm about to end this man career".

Do you enjoy science and are you a male?
---
I totally agree I think the spirit is a bunch of bullshit
---
You have dishonored the clan
---
Me after hooking a completely different survivors finding the fully healed other survivor downing them and sill getting hit with DS
---
50/50 bruh
---
I'm totally fine with that. I actually think spirit is in a pretty good spot. She's strong but with collision gone I feel like it's fair enough to be fun
---
This is clearly your video. Why else would you create a reddit acc 3 days ago and only post this channels videos. Your not fooling anyone.
---
;') bhvr doesnt even make exlusive things anymore either. Its much more profitable to put it in a shop. So now nobody can have anything that anyone else doesnt have. Except for legacy which they looked over. Even tho thats essentially the same as all the other events people put in extra work for extra skins.
---
&gt; corrupt intervention
---
I will never understand this, you're pushing survivors to leave max distance between last few gens and forcing them to do the gens they *should* do first, how's that good?
---
I mean yeah, you force survivors close at start but in the end you can only chase one survivor at a time...
---
That‚Äôs a you problem. All the killers have interesting strategies for every map and all have different builds and play styles. 
---
Survivors are just skins for one model.
---
It‚Äôs even good if they‚Äôre not tunneling, sometimes they just find you and slap you but it hasn‚Äôt been a full minute. 
---
Then you shriek ‚Äúyou‚Äôve activated my trap card, fool* and proceed to miss DS if you‚Äôre as garbage as I am
---
Survivors are still a free down once injured :/
---
Definitely shifts, as of late I‚Äôve been enjoying demogorgon. Was wrongfully dismissed as B-C tier within the first week of release and most people forgot about him, there‚Äôll probably be a streamer who actually puts effort into building and improving with himat some point and more will pick him up.
---
Besides that I really enjoy setup characters like hag/trapper. Making someone walk into a trap or generally snowballing when you‚Äôre set up really makes you feel like you‚Äôre a galaxy brain, they require the most map and survivor behavior knowledge to dominate. Hoping the eventual map reworks can put them up a few tiers.

People on this sub seem to think mindgame means knowing exactly what the other player is doing/about to do at all times and then reacting.
---
Nah, that game was balls from day one.
---
The survivor five seconds after being unhooked ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna do what‚Äôs called a pro gamer move‚Äù runs directly into killer
---
what do you mean bugged ?
---
Survivors complaining about trapper honestly makes me worry about this games future. Like really? Trapper? Probably one of if not the weakest killer in the game?
---
He's going S I C K O mode üò±üò±

Dado
---
Is this some kind of normal joke that I'm too weeb too understand ?
---
Yeah, same. I only play survivor now when one of my casual friends want to SWF, so we're real bad and lose every time lolol. Flashlight aiming not a factor!
---
Genuinely the saddest moment, I didn't even play the game but when I watched that on YouTube I actually shed a tear
---
Yeah a new menu option of just walking around to different pieces of fog to pick modes and being able to mess around with shut would be cool

Oh... I legit thought this was the Daimy≈ç Odin skin from Smite on first glance... this mixed me up even harder since I play all three games. lol
---
Bruh walking still leaves scratch marks, just less of them. Plus makes slightly more noise than crouching. You did, in fact, miss something here.
---
I think either Billy, GF, or Fred is next.
---
If they could just make a sound bar that let me mute screams completely life would be much better
---
I did preface that this is how 'I feel' so yes it is a me problem. No "Interesting strategies" come to mind, certainly not for ever map. Although it is interesting how the devs seemingly forget that huntress exists and make more and more indoor maps
---
I'm satisfied with the spirit nerf, doesn't kill her but brings get in line
---
The victory was short lived

 You're saying Legion always gets hits off with his power but at the same time saying he's weak. He has a unique playstyle. He also doesn't always get his hits off, not sure how you're playing against him but pallet baiting is the way to do it. Feral Frenzy-ing Legions always wait a second for you to throw the pallet down, so run to the pallet, count to 2, then throw it down as he lunges at you. Like most killers, there are unique/weird ways to play against most of them that just takes learning. He's honestly a decent killer who has very known weaknesses and strengths.
---
On one side, pallet looping just isn't a fun experience for killers, it repetitive and pretty annoying: You walk forward in a circle until you get bonked by some plywood, then you break the wood, then you rinse and repeat until the survivor fucks up and you can get a hit it. Then you repeat that until you down them, then you hook them, then you do it all over again with the next survivor.  
---
On the other side, survivors are just using the most effective method to play, so you can't really blame them.  
---
This is a simple case of humans being stupid and badly directing their frustration, like a parent coming home from a bad day at work and beating their kids.  
---
The fault is on the devs for not making the game better, and for not making a better chase system that doesn't involve running in circles.  
---
So when a killer complains that you gen rush or pallet loop, they are most likely not really mad at you for doing it, but they are actually mad at the game and devs for making it that way, but are just in the crossfire.
---
Balls, but fun balls
---
She just got nerfed
---
Dont sleep on that ORIGINAL VERSION
---
Am I the only one that uses BBQ for tracking?
---
funny enough ive been shit on by a cannibal on HADDONFIELD while i was rank 1.
---
I couldn't even get mad because it was the cannibal lol
---
I think the base changes are fine. I think her addons may have been a bit overkill. Prayer beads was the only one that was really needed
---
My heart &lt;3 I love wholesome chats w good killers after a match
---
Is this real?
---
Apparently it‚Äôs killer only, but other people claim they got progress on the survivor side.
---
I feel the same. The Add-On changes are nice, but her actual base Power changes aren't significant enough. You also shouldn't be able to hear Survivor's while Phase Walking at least.
---
I mean I think adam is a semi fit dude seeing as his lore says "¬†As a shy teenager with his nose stuck in books, he was the perfect prey for bullies. What he lacked in sports, he made up in grit. He learned to defend himself in the thick of it." So he was probably skilled enough to get through bullies. So a shirtless skin would be cool.
---
Can I get a link to the changes?
---
When you wanna play all 3 of your games but you don‚Äôt have time.
---
/u/Esoteric_Idiot
---
the nerf was 100% necessary
---
Ah... Well, most of them were kinda sucky? So I'm cool with that. I never use them.
---
I hate this argument. Good killers win chases quickly whether you can see them or not.
---
People are gonna cry on both sides of the aisle. I have seen bad spirit mains complaining she got gutted (I main spirit, and she did not) and shitty survivor mains complaining she‚Äôs still broken (she‚Äôs so not)
---
Are you talking about how unbalanced it was when the counselors grouped together?
---
Unless you run Left Behind.  Everyone hates you if you run Left Behind.
---
They want to all speak to the Entity's manager.
---
The killer is much faster then survivors he could just back up and avoid the survivors
---
That's fine when it's a garbage brown/yellow but when it's a purple worth 6k BP and you get 3 of them in your bloodwebs you can't skip, it becomes an issue.
---
It's kind of annoying that I grinded for those things but, i can finally use chuckles on trapper
---
That‚Äôs the kind Tapp gameplay I love to see :,)
---
Hahahaha very nice
---
ok boomer
---
It's actually my video, this person is my friend. And I believe his reddit account is quite old
---
People like u are a cancer to this community and will eventually start hurting the game in the long run.
---
The Entity has chosen me.
---
Yea sorry for being somewhat rude with that comment. I just love the map and really appreciate all the time and effort the developers put into it. I don't think just because it's sometimes tough for survivors who aren't familiar with the map to do well that it should be called a "shit" map, but opinions are opinions. Sorry again though for the rude comment I was just flustered by the post.
---
There's a difference between cosmetics which were given out on codes at things like TwitchCon and GStar and things like Hound mask which were grinded for and are tied to the account of the person that earned it (meaning you'd literally have to sell your entire account).
---
Not gonna lie, some of the lore is stupid and takes away from the mystery and intrigue of the game.
---
It's 3 days old u can look, but thank you for informing me
---
Spirit be like OK Boomer
---
They need a rework, the fact that they can't down someone in frenzy is just the worst.
---
I never said anything about her perks tho...
---
Spirit herself is not the same as her perks
---
Its literally the same with event skins.
---
Its not so much about the looks as it is that the whole purpose of the event items back then were to be exclusive. The only reason events arent exclusive anymore is because the shop will make money. People would be quite bothered too if all the legacy skins became open. Because those people were there and worked for them. I feel like the other events prior to the shop should be the same
---
I like all the changes, but I still feel like The Spirit shouldn't be able to hear Survivor at all while Phase Walking (grunts of pain, breathing, etc).
---
This right here this is some good shit
---
There was one in the middle of crotus prenn with literally nothing around it in each direction for about 20 feet. Felt bad for the killer. Never seen a worse totem spot.
---
It is her speed after phasing. But you are very likely to lunge after phase. And yeah, I am just saying collision is a huge nerf, but she is still strong compare to other killers of course. She has other better tools than collision.
---
One of you lies.. or is just wrong for some reason.. will we ever know?
---
RIP TrueTa1ent
---
Go outside
---
100 for survivor and killer
---
I don't play Spirit often anymore because she's too damn easy vs the effort/power she provides. I never run add ons and i can't really see how these changes would make me *not* 4k every game as her. Let alone someone who actually mains her.
---
I have a good headset so i can hear breathing, footsteps, grass moving etc sounds very clearly (and directionally) so there's pretty much nothing a survivor can do if they can't get out of the power's range fast enough. Her power by design is flawed and only a rework can fix that.
---
I'm ok with the base changes, but I'm still sad they nerfed the bloody hair brooch
---
Plot twist. He's playing as both, there's another monitor just out of view.
---
Fuck it we're doing it live

---
Took no effort other than being online during a specific time period.  Such status to jerk yourself off above the rest of the peasants.
---
TCM2 Chapter: Choptop as the killer, Stretch or Lefty as the survivor and a new skin for Bubba.
---
Consider that over performing is also tied with people automatically dcing when facing her.
---
But I know the pain of sweaty spirits, I got to red ranks (before the fucking rank reset) and yeah. It sucked having a sweaty killer and bitchy teammates that dced. I also play spirit when I play killer and she is powerful, but not to the unbeatable degrees people put her, at least not with a decent player behind the keyboard (which I‚Äôm not lmao)
---
I agree with you, the nerfs were balanced, not broken anymore and not gutted either. People who cry and bitch now are going to be either bad spirit mains or bad survivor mains.
---
Get 20 Gold or Iridescent.
---
So i've read some articles about it, and non-binary is that thing with "i identify as [something]"?
---
I wouldn't mind to have longer challenges, like 12 sacrifices or 10 generators. Bring 10 items to back to the camp fire, something like that. Survive a trial as X, using his 3 unique perks. That's fine.
---
Sadly most put you at odds with your team mates.
---
BHVR didn't force anyone to spend 400 dollars on cosmetics
---
Have you ever played Ghostface? Because that's literally all of his purple add-ons.
---
I have no sympathy
---
Why am I an asshole for supporting the game for so long?
---
Yeah adapting and overcoming is too much effort, we should nerf every killer into the ground.
---
That will be the day I uninstall
---
1. Multiple can escape through the hatch, If a survivor has a key and the situation calls for a hatch then YES. She/he will play very defensively to avoid dying with the key in addition to staying alive long enough for the hatch to spawn. Also! That isn't "my thought process" per-say because it's literally how the game works. If he plans on leaving early via hatch then everyone will be notified when one of the gens is complete so there's no surprise there- While in the current state of the hatch it is essentially "everyone for themselves" or (hides in corner) - Messages "i have key".  Gets reply* I'm at hatch, it's "blah blah blah". Until either one dies or the other is "forced" to leave dooming the keyless player/s. 
---
2. It's an optional secondary escape. The goal is to complete generators and escape, That's it. If someone wants to stop to search a box, destroy a hook, self care next to you it's up to them. There are worse ways for players to waste time. 
---
3. It now has a presence rather than being an rng thing, Two players could pop it in like 15 seconds or so (I don't actually know the times behind them) 
---
4.Wouldn't that mean the killer earned the win? It's the same logic behind getting gen rushed. It isn't enjoyable to one side but they were just very well coordinated. 
---
5. You're mistaking the free escape via hatch for the earned 4 man wipe early on, It's a feat a killer must preform, If the survivors are sloppy and unorganized they get dominated like a bad basement rescue attempt vs a terminal camping leather face. That's just how it is at times. - However This is NOT a free win for anyone, if anything it removes a free win that existed. 
---
6.I covered enough of that to not have to go over the rest again
---
Gotta say, i dont really care if Spirit is nerfed or buffed, she wasnt a real problem to me but everyone seems to like the changes so thats cool
---
What the fuck is that
---
You forgot no ed
---
The pallets are, at the same time, safe yet unsafe, they are still useful to you even when downed because the go around corners
---
Totally agree about everything especially the standing still juke.
---
That should have been the first thing to go.
---
Give her a different idle animation so you can‚Äôt do that stupid shit.
---
Use spine shill as survivor. It is really cool
---

---
Huntress. Those hatchets are probably heavy, but she throws 'em like a champ. Also, she's supa hawt. 
---
I always love playing against the Nurse, it's such a thrill, my god. Even when she downs me, I'm laughing my ass off. Her shrieks are terrifying, but dodging her blinks gives me such a rush.
---
This was kinda weak expected something really bad dude I make fun of my friend for his dad leaving constantly (his dad actually left him) and he finds it funny as shit
---
So apparently killers aren't allowed to counter DS by slugging and have to let themselves get hit by DS.
---
my favorite killer to play as is probably Plague, or maybe Clown
---
My favorite killer to play against is Bubba, or maybe Demogorgon, pretty much anything you can make crash into walls.
---
Nurse and spirit are both LITERALLY the exact same.  The nurse added a cooldown that just punishes missed attacks, and spirits Nerfs are to prevent running into survivors and to know when she vaults *as if I‚Äôve ever seen a spirit vault anyways*
---
Is this an actual question? God damn, holy fuck, you actually are unable to use unsafe pallets? I dunno maybe actually use some skill.
---
I get the decision to make the exlusive cosmetic items public, but why the in-game event items like kate's shirt and billy's hammer? If you wanted those you should've played during those events, just like legacy?
---
Its BHVR's patented Awful Archives Mechanic
---
That‚Äôs just objectively not true lol. Great players can still be outplayed plenty if they‚Äôre not playing nurse or spirit against an injured survivor. Seems pretty silly to think that it‚Äôs okay that spirit gets a guaranteed down once you‚Äôre injured with no counterplay available.
---
Spirit gets a speed boost coming out of phase so if I collide with her I'm already fucked. And how do you out mindgame something you cant see? She can hear you and see your scratch marks in phase and if you walk your not really gonna get anywhere fast. And most spirits do the whole standing still mindgame before she starts her phase to see where you are planning on going. So if you move before she starts then she will catch you.
---
You do realize without collision, and without strider, you have 0 ways to tell the location of a walking or standing survivor while phasing, either being healthy or injured with iron will. Yeah you don‚Äôt depend on collision too much in the current game patch because survivors know you can use collision to find them if they move too slow.
---
i feel like people kind of overblow how bad jakes dad is tbf
---
the lore doesn't say he was hyper pressured or shamed or anything, im pretty sure it just says jake decided that life wasn't for him and went his separate ways.
---
"Hmph he took my spotlight, I'm going to another game"
---
\*Angry Spirit Noises\*
---
"Orochi why are you here?"
---
It also ironically screws over players who bought codes for insane amounts
---
the cosmetic are sub-par in looks though compared to the stuff in the story, their only value is in their status.
---
Yesterday I got stuck in a chest which caused me to lose an easy hook, the survivor came back and waited for me to get unstuck.
---
Lol me too
---
Yeah, you are right about the lunge. Still, I think there‚Äôs some addons that fix that, right?
---
I now fear people are going to complain it isn‚Äôt enough and she /will/ get gutted now. To me she‚Äôs still strong but not so unfun to play against, to me prayer beads were the worst shit
---
I would like to see an add on, maybe ultra rare or smth, that goes with that idea someone had, I don‚Äôt remember the post now, about removing her collision but making survivors scream when she phases through them
---
Yes, the shop makes money, but some people would actually like to purchase them if they came to the game late, or were unable to play during an event. Exclusives make people feel left out of things, which BHVR has made moves lately to move away from. It's a nice gesture to make things available to everyone.
---
I once unhooked a teammate then went to break a generator, you're not alone
---
Is someone gonna tell him... or
---
It is good for that, and I'd never say otherwise. In this era of EGC existing I'd rather have Whispers though, and running both BBQ and Whispers is a little excessive.
---
But since I still need million of BP, BBQ it is
---
Of fucking course you would address spirit before addressing SWF or the fact that half the killers are a slog a high ranks. Peace.
---
Holy firecracker
---
That ghostface looks like he is about to suck my wiener
---
Actually nobody's really complaining all that much. But this meme's funny nonetheless.
---
Found the rank 20
---
She is def better now, but i do think she is going to continue being the easiest killer in the game in terms of skill to kills.
---
nothing about her hearing was changed, and thats the biggest issue with her.
---
Once again i will take it, but i feel like she can still use tweaking.
---
I'm quite fond of David's Hunting Grounds jacket tho, I'm happy I can still use it.
---
Why be so negative? It's something to show that you were there and supported and played the game during an event from a long time ago? It's almost no different than people who grinded for Legacy skins.
---
Literally almost all multiplayer games have them it's not different than like a Runescape holiday event item, and again no one paid for them so it doens't really cut down on the code resellers like the other cosmetics they're releasing do.
---
I didnt say that, I'm saying never trust game companies to care about your investments into a game
---
Absolutely. I'm a little sad to lose the aesthetic of her blink vault, so I really hope the new vault animation keeps her unique spookiness intact (somehow)
---
&gt;Thanks to the reports we have received thus far, we are looking to improve certain Killer powers, perks (e.g. Dead Hard), and the interaction system (e.g. Kicking Pallets or Generators).
---
So nothing about hit authority? I'm pretty sure "even more ridiculous hits" is the #1 complaint about servers.
---
Good on the moderate Spirit changes, surprised they actually figured to also tone down activation time add-ons, which were indeed pretty bonkers when stacked. Though I would like to see an on-model indication of her phasing, and maybe Spirit should also hear the whooshing sound herself, at a lowered volume, to make audio-tracking a little more difficult. Also maybe rethink the Iron Will vs. Stridor interaction...
---
Agreed, his style is the focal point of his character.
---
Because shirtless David is too OP.
---
It's not broken but it's more of a "fuck really" moments
---
IIRC in 2017 it was around 15k average players a day, currently I think it's closer to 40k, is having a few cosmetics as a token of loyalty for sticking with the game from the early stages really too much to ask? Also if you didn't play during 2017 you don't get to talk about this stuff because the game wasn't very player-friendly back then
---
tOxIc NoOb tUnNellEr
---
Usually phasing is good for cutting distance and downing already injured survivors, imo
---
You can run a survivor without being invisible and still get an early hit, especially with mindgames. That just dominoes your way into a down if you phase to cut their sprint and follow the bloodtrail/grunts of pain
---
I think it was at least partially a thing in the PTB -- I remember seeing a Spirit move grass right outside the main building on Thompson House.
---
I haven't seen it since though, so perhaps it was unintentional?
---

¬´¬†adapting¬†¬ª against a killer where you cannot adapt because the only thing she does is standing still.

I agree about the vault animation -- for aesthetics, I'm going to miss the eerie way she simply stands in front of it. I really am hoping the new animation retains her eerie movement
---
Don't forget Franklin's!

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dwdwaa/well_its_been_a_long_time_since_i_had_this_window/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Try and play anyone but them at high ranks vs consistently toxic survivors, then come and tell me everything is fine.
---
Yeah, just adapt to a killer that you can‚Äôt adapt to, good idea man. Spirit is easy mode and she has no counters on the survivor end, you literally just have to stand still to kill people. 
---
They didn‚Äôt really nerf Nurse that much but people aren‚Äôt crying are they? I still see good Nurse‚Äôs dominate at Rank 1, but I don‚Äôt care, because she actually requires skill to play. People don‚Äôt care about her, because she has counterplay, unlike Spirit. It was the same with old Legion.
---
- please educate yourself before telling me to ‚Äòadapt and overcome‚Äô
---
Mmm dem thicckum thighs make me coom all the tiem üíØ üçÜ üí¶üí¶
---
Is that a visual or audio queue perk? I didnt get too deep onto survivor since i couldnt even hear the heartbeat and died so fast lol
---
Out-phase Lunge add ons are also nerfed. But yeah, I think she is still strong. And I don‚Äôt want bhvr to keep nerfing killers to a point where no one wants to play killers anymore.
---
I main(ed) Tiandi, all I care about is style
---
I get a Myers grab almost every game.
---
For non-DLC characters, maybe the Wraith with the silent bell add on would be easiest? I get regular grabs with Nurse as well, but that took a bit of getting used to.
---
No good killers tunnel a survivor off the hook and then camps them slugged on the ground for 60 seconds
---
&gt; Do they not realize they are causing more damage to the people who bought their clothes from it?
---
It really isn't their problem if people are upset that their cosmetics they bought for $200 from a sketchy guy on the internet illegally selling codes are no longer exclusive.
---
I am partially deaf as well and I can never play killer bc my directional hearing is awful and my hearing aid is super uncomfy w my current headphones :/ I hope you figure out a solution though man
---
Dweard has always been free on console
---
Good
---
The codes were also finite. There was no reason to do this. Also i dont understand why bloodletting is omitted. I have it, so Im not complaining but still
---
Uh yeah to both?...
---
The hell are you on about lmao
---
Idk, since they're making the donkey jacket available I really dont like them making the lunar one too. Hound and Untamed aren't being sold for money anyways and they're really just neat tokens of loyalty to us who played during the dark times of the game.
---
Salad fingers lunge lookin ass
---
No one is saying that they're jerks
---
Prayer beads is now a game slowdown addon
---
BILL NIE THE SCINCE GUY
---
Where did I said it? Billy is stronger then her. She is just more annoying which makes her strong in another way.. I would place him over her but when plague has thana and dying light its not fun
---
Can't speak for OP but I got the GStar Donkey Jacket on David just so I could say I had legitimately every cosmetic for him (like a completionist thing for my main basically) but ultimately I think it's a good thing that they're releasing these since some of these codes were being sold for 4 digits on EBay and that's just ridiculous.
---
I never said it was, you said the vocal majority is low rank bad survivors but it‚Äôs clearly not
---
The best way for easy blind is making killer destroy some pallet and then just step away from him and aim for the head. The most common mistake is being too close to killer so make sure you are far enough.
---
That's every perk in the game tho, every good perk takes a bad situation and makes it better
---
What do you need explained?
---
Yeah survivor wrecks me too i can hardly hear the terror radius, would be nice if they added subtitles for us based on proximity, like if we were in clear range of the sounds it produces some sort of text, shit is hard man. I got used to using legion since his frenzy high lights people which is only way i can find them but i chew through add ons to increase its radius
---
That still punishes the buyers unfortunately. Codes are finite and there aren't as many sellers these days. That said, they could have just let it die out since it pretty much was starting to stagnate. 
---
That said, accounts with legacy are being sold and yet we dont get offered free legacy. Weird.
---
Two matches in swf which I don‚Äôt mind playing and they all DC - Can we do something about this ffs
---
I dunno what the deal is with the streamer skins, they might have to discuss rights with it or something, and I know bloodletting dwight was actually tied to a store purchase opposed to stopping by and saying hi at an event or something. I'm not super knowledgeable about the origins of a lot of the exclusive skins tho so Idk if that really excuses them from not being included.   
---
what's baffling me is the summer and chinese new year skins, giving those to everyone is kinda like giving legacy to everyone (and no i'm not saying they should be giving legacy to everyone). like if they wanted those skins they should've just played during the events?
---
&gt; Also if you didn't play during 2017 you don't get to talk about this stuff because the game wasn't very player-friendly back then
---
I have the event cosmetics, but feel free to keep showing how much of a gatekeeping jerk you consistently are.
---
But I did and it didn‚Äôt work
---
If you don‚Äôt use your power enough, you are a M1 killer with 1.1 movement speed. Some loops will take forever. Also you cannot see blood during phase. They won‚Äôt have sound if they run iron will.
---
For sure. But I was just vibing
---
They arent even going to the shop. Everyone is just being given them
---
Play more
---
And then proceeded to murder his wife and daughter
---
my hearing loss is only in one so that‚Äôs why my directional is so bad, but it rly sucks when I‚Äôm trying to hear the killer‚Äôs footsteps or figure out where they‚Äôre coming from and I‚Äôm totally fuckin lost
---
You son of a bitch. Now all of Dbd will know!
---
Damn it, I missed the skill check on that parry
---
i've yet to have a problem with ds, but in a game that moves as fast as dbd, 60 seconds is a very long time, especially later in the game once generators start getting done and things are really moving
---
That‚Äôs fair enough, I can‚Äôt fault you for feeling this way, all I can say is that as a collector I find these kinds of exclusive event based cosmetics incredibly frustrating, just because I wasn‚Äôt at the right place at the right time I have no chance to get these items. You still have the pride of having the items early and you still had fun grinding for these items, right? While a lot of people find grinding frustrating, but I always accept an excuse to just play the game and to enjoy myself while I do so, and I‚Äôd like to encourage you to do the same, or you‚Äôll just remain upset.
---
Nah, imo hearing is balanced because SHE CANT FUCKING SEE. It‚Äôs the same volume as any killer without stridor, and it is aside from bloodstains (that are not very reliable in and of themselves in long stretches/with good survivors) the only way she can track.
---
It is an easy killer to master because she allows to end loops easy in ways others can‚Äôt, like the nurse does, although the latter‚Äôs mechanics are harder. 
---
She is strong now, but not broken or unbeatable; so no, I don‚Äôt think she needs tweaking. I like playing against good spirits, although the prayer beads are the fucking bane of my existence, and I don‚Äôt want any more boring games with the same builds because every killer is lousy
---
You sure they werent perks?
---
I run it with Jake because I only play solo, and team loves the basement :c
---
Faith in humanity restored
---
1. Don't balance game around item, balance item around game
---
2. There aren't worse ways for players to waste time, this does literally nothing if it does come down to 1surv, and if they're done before that, it's just eng hatch again.
---
3.still not doing anything for 2survs to pop hatch for 1
---
4. Sometimes your team sucks and you don't deserve to depip. 3k is still a win
---
5. THIS IS A FREE WIN IN MOST SITUATIONS FOR THE KILLER, DOING THESE GENS ARENT WORTH SHIT UNTIL LAST PERSON.
---
I'm pretty sure that its impossible to hack this game on console.
---
Are you sure that he wasn't using a aura reading perk build?
---
Uh huh honey he's got the power strut.
---
I love that in the lore michael is just THAT angry motherfucker.
---
Behavior doesn't have a license to use the original killers, they own the IP.
---
My favorite killer to play is clown. His ability is fun to use for me idk why
---
Nope no aura reading perks
---
Then she would be completely useless.
---
&gt; That still punishes the buyers unfortunately.
---
Yeah, it'd suck to be one of those people. Still, you're consciously buying a limited product knowing the person on the other end is selling it illegally, and have to accept the risks of that. One such risk is that the product you're buying may become mainstream one day.
---
&gt; That said, accounts with legacy are being sold and yet we dont get offered free legacy. Weird.
---
Again, not the devs problem. Those people are selling their accounts illegally (and not just in the devs POV, but in Steam's ToS as well).
---
I think I saw it on PS4
---
It‚Äôs probably the first yakamoa not her dad
---
Jake gets all the good skins anyways. I main dwight ;3;
---
Nope not a single aura reading perk
---
Actually rank 7 right now but you guys are right. Crazy how i never knew that.
---
Huh... Interesting... You've just created a monster üòà
---
That‚Äôs kinda what I‚Äôm expecting. Looking at her lore, 
---
&gt;The ground shook with her father's footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.
---
&gt;A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.
---
&gt;An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.
---
Rin didn‚Äôt care about making anyone else pay. She wouldn‚Äôt make a pact or oath with the entity to join her dad in being terrible. Rin is the one who truly inherited the curse of her ancestors rage, and her father was a mere catalyst/conduit. It would make the most sense for Rin to serve the entity in exchange for being able to make her father suffer again and again and again and again. Her rage is so powerful that she would sacrifice her entire being just to exact her vengeance. If her father is introduced as a killer with no mention of being a survivor for a long time with some sort of retcon then we‚Äôve been robbed.
---
If her father was going to just be a killer right out the gate I‚Äôm sure Rin would have rather been a survivor so she could smack his face with flashlights and pallets.
---
I think we will be getting a survivor with some really weird perks. Maybe he will have some weird obsession interaction to complement Spirit‚Äôs rancor the way Laurie and the Shape have a clear thematic connection through perks. I imagine his theming will be built around regret and redemption. Potentially some sort of self-sacrificing perk. As someone who‚Äôs killed before, maybe he will have perks that reflect an empathy with the killers.
---
I really only like the prayer beads changes and the collision changes. I‚Äôll admit, the add-on is unfair (although it was fun) and collision might give too much survivor information away. Everything else, including the window animation, seems a little too far. Thankfully they didn‚Äôt destroy her, (hey legion) but I‚Äôll never understand what‚Äôs so scary about a powerful killer in the game. They‚Äôre fun to play. And with Spirit specifically, I have learned that Iron Will is already the biggest spirit nerf. Survivors just don‚Äôt really know how to counter her. It just seems routine at this point. Good killer comes out, survivors complain rather than learn how to counter, killer gets nerfed and is no longer as fun to play. I worry that the devs will be too scared to release a killer in the future that can actually take on a good group of survivors at base with no offerings, add-ons, or perks. Spirit was the only killer that could actually face a group of strong SWF. I‚Äôm becoming a survivor main now.
---
Sandbagging is referred to someone who stands in the way of other survivors during chases and often pop gens on purpose. Complete trolls
---
I am interested in the vod. Any chance you share it here? Also I‚Äôm sure you can submit a ticket through their official website.
---
I just noticed yeah, but I really wanted to use that Ash meme I had in mind for ages x)
---
If nobody is pissed, then i'm pleased
---
Plot twist: the arm is actually a survivor spam opening the locker
---
Likely he just thought he didnt do 3 full gens worth and was there for 3 gens popping. So he assumed. It's hard to gauge.
---
All I know is I completed the challenge in a game where I only actually finished 1 gen in the sense of being there when it finished, but I brought the best toolbox in the game and did like 75% of the total gen work.
---
It was a pig so we were 99ing gens and other people would pop them later btw
---
I have youtube link
---
Very difficult if not impossible to prove
---
A good Spirit will still run the table on the survivors, just like a good Nurse still will. I suspect that BHVR had some stats on the most effective add ons and they decided to make tweaks to them in hopes of reducing their effectiveness, and therefore balancing the kill/escape ratios a bit. Most of the changes were fairly minor, and that's probably best for both sides at this point.
---
rank reset
---
JUST MAKE HER FUCKING GLOW BRIGHTER DAMN
---
The mind game is she is either vaulting or phasing around. Completely killer sided and not much fun for the survivor. Now that prayer beads is changed it's not much of a mind game anymore.
---
So many times I forget to even search for auras with BBQ. Give me those BPs.
---
Dwearder has, not Dweard. And it wasn‚Äôt always there it was added quite awhile later
---
She exacly knew where to go and where we were hiding
---
Sh**t man you brought my hopes up with the the map name then I remember that doesn‚Äôt exist :(
---
Playing Jake against Doctor
---
Would you post the link here please?
---
The "literal definition" of mindgame doesn't fit the context of our situation, so being pedantic doesn't make you look more right. Mindgames, in the context of gaming, require a risk for the initiator of the mindgame. Otherwise, it's not a mindgame, just an uncounterable strategy.
---
You know what is a mindgame? Pig crouching and roaring to scare survivors away from the pallet, then standing up instead of commiting to the lunge. Hiding/showing your red stain at specific times can be a mindgame. Pretending to be aiming in a direction for a blink, then flicking right as you blink to catch a survivor is a mindgame. Pretending to not see a survivor while closing the gap is a mindgame.
---
Vaulting a window and getting a hit because the survivor has nothing to react to isn't a mindgame. The developers themselves said having no vault animation removes counterplay from the survivors side, and if there is no counterplay, it's not a mindgame.
---
if this wasn't Amanda, Tapp would live
---
Isn't the phasing sound the indicator she is using it? I thought the biggest complaint was about prayer beads removing it and now it doesn't. What's the issue?
---
I think it‚Äôs a good step for them to make some changes relatively quickly though, rather than waiting a year - or just nerfing her completely into the ground. If it‚Äôs not enough they can keep tweaking.
---
Not my fault she is easy mode, every killer is too easy. Even if they made a difficult killer survivors would cry because they can't handle losing
---
For some reason, my game disconnects while in the middle of the game. I cannot figure out the reason all it says it ‚ÄúYou lost connection to the host‚Äù. Very frustrating
---
Interesting, I try your version and reply when I've done it ^^
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not crazy. Every time I vs Freddy I feel like I am getting hit from the other side of the map.
---
I really enjoyed remothered, more then I thought I would. Laurie‚Äôs new outfit is lowkey Rosemary but a red nun killer would be so scary. I‚Äôm waiting for the devs to do a bug killer.. 
---
I just really want the clock tower series to get the love it deserves, it‚Äôs such a good take on the slasher chasing type
---
I forget which one we see, is it blood or scratch marks? Either way, getting an early hit is not that hard, and you cannot depend totally on your power, M1 is there for a reason. 
---
Depending on collision as a spirit when you have audio and visual cues (with the counter of iron will, I get it, but you can put stridor and, like survivor mains do, risk a useless perk slot like we do with iron will, spine chill, distortion, etc, that are very situational and strictly there to counter a killer/perk; or realize not every survivor runs iw, the same way not every killer runs bbq) is, on top of prayer beads, what made the game unfun for survivors, imo
---
Bloodletting was attached to official merchandise sold by the developers, and were specifically advertised as exclusive.
---
For legal reasons, they cannot give it out for free like the rest. Same applies to the Twitch shirts.
---
The rest, not so much.
---
I never get the map to learn it
---
Welcome to the fucking party I've been in this one for too long with other games
---
Can't wait for the basement wedding. I hear Bubba is a great pastor and he even keeps a box of toys around to keep the baby Dweets busy!
---
https://youtu.be/qDnYTWNOgf0  second game
---
Freedom for you Steve! Not for me!
---
Your boomer is showing
---
That‚Äôs fair. I wouldn‚Äôt go around butt-dancing just yet. She‚Äôs still far from bully-able.
---
Thanks. I will watch.
---
Heres a copy and paste of my reply to a similar comment:
---
That‚Äôs Dwearder with the red glasses, not Dweard
---
Was that the data set that like 80% of rank 1 survivors escape? That's understandable. If they didn't escape they would rank down and stop contributing data to it while the ones that do escape keep on contributing to the stat. I'd be more interested in purple - red rank rates.
---
Yep, as a Spirit main I‚Äôm not hating these changes at all (although the only one I believed that needed to be fixed was collision but I‚Äôll try new Spirit before deciding) but you bet your ass I‚Äôm using all my prayer beads and amulets up together now
---
I spent ¬£600 on golden feng.. I was aware that it was my responsibility for buying it but oh lord.. this feels like a kick to the face
---
Double check it, is it a killer only one?
---
Eac* but they had some false positives a while back i beleive
---
IT ain't much. But it's honest love.
---
yeah it‚Äôs the same w colorblind people also really struggling too, hopefully the devs work on somethin for us all soon
---
Yeah most of them would rather complain and nerf everything that learn how to play xD You are a well spirited killer!
---
Haha, No silly your meant to buy BHVR's Patented Auric Only cosmetics
---
And yeeting people with the kick, right?
---
Nearly played agaisnt bottress
---
I don‚Äôt remember, I‚Äôm sorry, I guess? But sure, go off
---
probably rank.
---
what
---
No aura reading perk, but did have Surveillance which means she'd know any time you touched a gen that she kicked. 
---
Also, best addons, beads with amulet meaning long phase range, speed, and recovery. 
---
First grab, you could hear the crows she disturbed behind you.
---
Second, you all ran around quite freely, easy to follow scratch marks.
---
When you were hooked again, she clearly didn't know the player was in the locker right near you.
---
Right after, you touched the gen in killer shack, alerting her to your position.
---
You were both injured when you went down again at shack, simply your audible cries, nothing out of the ordinary there.
---
Not a cheater, just someone better than you.
---
True, they are basically just recolours, never really used them.
---
You'll have to wait until the update. Most of the people will be upset because they don't read the patch notes and won't find out until they're in the game. It happened when d strike and hatch grabs changed. I saw a guy get to hatch and he didn't leave cuz he was afraid of getting grabbed.
---
thank :)
---
Better than the swamp
---
I need black ops 3 on pc and waw but I have bo4 with no dlcs and bo2 with buried and mob
---
Get off that high horse before you hit your head. As if running a bunch a pile of junk for a minute or two is high caliber gaming. Nothing in this game is "high caliber".
---
I still enjoy For Honor from time to time. They have updated it alot and still are adding new content.
---
I hate the 360 so much üò≠
---
Imagine thinking that you get to dictate how your opponent plays because you can‚Äôt stand them trying to win.
---
Fuck that'd be soooooo awesome dude holy shit
---
It‚Äôs a tad too strong, especially paired with STBFL. You can hit someone and phase right on top of them before they have time to make any distance. I used this combination once or twice before I stopped using it because it made me feel dirty.
---
?
---
ok coomer
---
Well, the thing about ghost face is that really stealth is the only thing on your side. Once a survivor reveals you, they take away your power, and then you‚Äôre just a base killer that can crouch.
---
Kinda wish they‚Äôd put them in the rift to fill slots instead. Then at least they‚Äôre earned.
---
I'd prefer that but they also aren't much of a challenge if you're able to complete five of them if you get lucky and get a match with a friendly killer or survivor.
---
DANNY(Jed(Ghostface))*
---
its just a joke
---
What the fuck, get away from me perv
---
Its like one of those cardboard jokes in cartoons
---
This is beyond science
---
The amulet changes were needed imo
---
Having one addon that positively boosts 4-5 aspects of your power without ANY trade off is kinda bs
---
Imagine thinking either of them have been ‚Äúdemolished‚Äù
---
lmfao
---
Hallelujah for this! Spirit needed to be tweaked. Im ok with her being good, but she just wasn't fair. Let's see how good she remains after these changes.
---
Then that very legion rips the team's anus open with infinite mend build and then all you see are Dis. Just saying it really do be like dat where you start off ballsy but then get wrecked
---
She has ears....
---
Problem is that when I play with friends, I SHOULD just work on gens when there's a camping killer. But I don't want my friends sitting on hook and having a boring game. So i try. And the camping killer ends up winning simply because I'd rather throw the game than let a friend not have fun.
---
Wonder what wraiths parents were like 
---
Probably nice I believe
---
What about 31:35?
---
4 gens
---
Collateral damage: the survivor will DC
---
Sounds like bubba himself.
---
Wait what do you mean she's accurate?
---
Could be, looks like they gave me the ban months ago
---
You got a yellow emblem not a gold emblem.
---
There are no gold emblems. Common mistake.
---
Cry harder lol
---
Wow EARS
---
Or Pig w/ Monitor
---
She's trying to get you to chase her so she can drop her 15 pallets
---
It‚Äôs a joke don‚Äôt skin me alive lol
---
I think it‚Äôs just normal spirit game play. Only one of you run iron will, so she can locate most of you with ease if you are injured. If you collide with her phase, she can also know you are there.
---
Nah, it's the lullaby she hums. silly goober
---
I'll try &lt;33
---
I'm going to enjoy wearing the hound mask and playing poorly just to give people like you a bad name
---
Noooo I wanted gold feng ;-;
---
I can be your hero baby
---
My only issue was the collision.
---
Not nearly as much though. I can fuck with them way better now that there's no collision
---
Not quickly enough.
---
Feng be like: you got games on your phone?
---
Luck *IS* a skill
---
How about the games been out on consoles for YEARS and we never got exclusive cosmetics. So how about you relax that asshole a little, you old can of sardines.
---
Not almost, he broke his jaw from punching him.
---
Classic, ‚Äúif he plays with it as well I don‚Äôt want it‚Äù
---
Well you called her a cheater when you were sprinting around and opening a chest. Of course she could hear you. This was just before you started telling your friends to disconnect.
---
I understand that. I was just  responding to the specific comment in your previous reply as to why things aren't exclusive anymore.
---
Viable ones.
---
I‚Äôm stuck at rank 8 and can‚Äôt rank up since the game bugged me there so I can‚Äôt flex on you with the red ranks but I do know how to play survivor
---
Wow really ? Can you sen video/picture of this
---
Shit man, sorry let me real quick barricade that door before the preperation phase ends.
---
She's pretty much Huntress with no hatchets now or slow billy
---
I wonder if that means the DbD Team sees all my false reports because I was using Mint Rag/Prayer Beads.
---
No F's in chat for the people like me who lost those cosmetics back when save files could disappear and were never given those event cosmetics back afterwards. I grided for that Hound mask back when I barely had any time to play. Lost my save the next week. Better late than never I guess...
---
31:35
---
Honestly some of the best balancing we've seen from BHVR they either don't do enough or they give overboard but this was good
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people can‚Äôt understand what a vac ban is. It literally reads right there that you were game banned. Vac bans are for; 1) a game that uses VAC (valve anti cheat) and is automatically given.( Like when a cheat becomes detected and is used). 2) a game ban is moreso manually reviewed and then given, such as editing your files to give yourself blood points or leveled up survivors with a ton of items or giving yourself legacy.
---
31:35 when she RUNS to the corner and then crouches and starts walking? She was following the scratch marks, and then likely followed sound (hard to tell as you tabbed away from the game right then).
---
One thing survivor mains like you don't know is that beads also remove the phasing sound for Spirit as well, so she can hear players while phasing so easily.
---
haha guys my turn uhhhhhh **pig**
---
Don't think they'll be repatriating us with auric cells or anything either, maybe if you cough up some money you can buy the new "I USED TO HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE" Shirt for only 1080 Auric cells.
---
I knew that
---
Give em to everyone. Most people don't know what these are anymore and they're pretty boring cosmetics too, so they may as well let everyone have them
---
Stridor is a general skill. 
---
I just remembered 2 perks, cant remember the killers they are from. First one is called "I am all ears" and it lets you see the aura of thw survivors when they vault a window or a pallet.
---
The second one I believe its calles  iron maiden. It just reveals the aura of survivors when they exit a locker and gives them the exposed effect. Not a solution to your problem but It may "path" it a bit.
---
We can also argue that sloppy buther, a general skill, will also grant you more visual cues. It makes them bleed more so you can see more blood in the floor when injured (they wont trick you that hard).
---
Im kinda a new player. Recently got my left ear a bit damaged and I have a very slightly deafness. But no, I cant really hear those guys breath. It doesnt matter if thwy are on my left or on my right. I do get them when injured tho.
---
Spine chill is a general skill but yeah, you are a bit fucked with those skill checks and it is your main objective
---
I wish it would be one hour a day. It takes ages to get on level on the rift it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
I had a 1000 cells when the pass released and just bought it. I regret it so much.
---
Glorious 100X2/10 beautiful romantic godly turbo fantastic sexy hot cute supermodel pun there, bubba.
---
Just means that you can see the cool mask more often.
---
I grinded and got the Hound mask, then my save file shat itself and despite my pleading and showing proof that I earned it, BHVR never gave me back that item. So I'm very happy I can finally get that item back after over a year and a half of being screwed out of it.
---
Like. She only needed 2 of those changes
---
What makes you say so? As a survivor main, I think he can be fun to play against, he has good map pressure but it‚Äôs not as annoying (unlike Freddy) and you get a decent warning that he‚Äôs coming (unlike Spirit). He also takes actual skill to use his ability effectively (unlike spirit or even huntress w her ridiculous hatchet issues) so it doesn‚Äôt feel as shitty when you lose against him. Plus, I rarely ever met a billy who tunneled or camped compared to other killers. Overall I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs the epitome of a balanced killer
---
An in game ban is through the in game service, this is a steam message, ergo, VAC
---
Personally, I dislike that ds can be used aggressively. Getting into lockers to either force a stand off, a grab, or to run away is lame. Also, when someone unhooks in front of you for free because they body block a hit. The saver will make distance. If you chase them another will pick up the other and you can't pick them because they'll just run away with ds.
---
At the same time, ds is needed to discuss tunneling. I just wish it could do its job without allowing survivors to do stuff for free.
---
Rest in peace to all the money I spent on exclusive cosmetics.
---
anticipate = 50/50 guess
---
The hitboxes are kinda whack
---
I think I'm done. They don't seem to care about the Switch version.
---
So let the killer kill my friend and not save them? That doesn‚Äôt sound right. Also it sounds like your blaming me for the killer DC. I was surviving not playing dead not my fault the killer was getting beat up. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big if that how you think it‚Äôs supposed to be played.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
I either feel bad for killing them or I want to smack my head into a wall because they got away, there's no in between. Yeah it's probably better I stick with survivor
---
it‚Äôs a shame he couldn‚Äôt read the laws, without his reading glasses
---
As someone with hearing issues, I can barely ever use the auditory cues in game. Like, I HAVE to play with the volume up and no other noise in order to do well in any form, but that's without listening for breathing, injured sounds, totem tinkering etc.
---
It‚Äôs only a coping mechanism
---
Many games do that. I was banned a long time ago for vulgarity in a browser game.
---
I stopped playing a week because I was on holiday.
---
I opened the game and "You banned".
---
I thought "banning people is supposed to be a punishment. How can it be a punishment if you don't even know why you were banned?"
---
Oh, and I was banned for saying "cunt"
---
I struggle to see how the entity beefed up Ghostface. 
---
"I give you the power to crouch and not terrify people by being in their vicinity"
---
yeah, license implies you didn‚Äôt make the idea
---
I think the purple wakizashi one is a bit too harsh. a green to a purple being that much of a boost is kinda rough. plus the 'all purpose' addon went from amazing to really pretty fucking bad. 
---
I actually wish they'd kept the window thing as it is too - that was an actual unironic mind game you could play
---
In that 61 weeks you could EASILY get Pig to P3, and probably get MYC for every killer....
---
owned with logic and facts
---
Thank you!! These comments are my biggest motivator tbh &lt;3
---
I think it was one for both
---
He failed to mention sloppy (makes cries louder), beads (makes hearing easier), and Surveillance (all gen touches on kicked gens gives notification and visible auras).
---
If you don‚Äôt use them you‚Äôre fucked
---
Yeah, I'll just stand around guarding them for 60 seconds wasting time because the second I run off one of their teammates gets them up.
---
Before 31:35, your teammates healed shortly after they were injured so she know both of them are near by. Scratch marks last 10 secs and meg ran around right before she get hit. The Meg also stand at a narrow path which increase the chance she bump into the phasing spirit.
---
Oof, I hope that didn't take too long!
---
It looks like one of the ones I did when I was first learning üòÇ
---
I'm happy for the Spirit changes, but am I the only one that's disappointed we haven't gotten our Doctor rework yet?
---
Sorry, that's what I meant.
---
To play as:
---
Pig, because mean and gets to punch. Legion because sprinting. Spirit because spookiness.
---
To play against:
---
Pig, Plague, Legion, Huntress, Nurse. Killers that have complex abilities, unique cosmetics and unexpected perks, and are played with dedication and passion
---
Who would win
---
Ancient entity that feeds on terror and suffering
---
Vs
---
Angry boi with a mask
---
Solid minute
---
\*cries in weekend claudette\*
---
Yeah it seems on killer id need bbq, iron maiden, discordance, and im all ears, pretty crazy the huge adjust that needs to made for having a disability, on survivor i can try strider and spine chill and just hope i can do something, i guess i could get that maintenance perk on feng meng and try to silence my inevitable fails, but im definitely never getting to high rank on either
---
All of my efforts reduced to ashes
---
No offense taken, everything's fine (:
---
Yeah, this guy is rank 13 and rank reset just happened. Probably a low red rank Spirit right after reset. Embarrassing the accusations when it's super obvious this is normal Spirit play against lower skill players.
---
So what? It really doesn't matter if someone else gets a virtual cosmetic.
---
I guess but it was purple and none of the effects were very significant. It was minor boosts
---
im not sure about what the alchemist is about, but the entity doesn't like it when myers just straighy up kills survivors, and vigo escaping I assume didn't really happen with the entity's blessing either.
---
Putting Rin's father into the game as a survivor would mean that the entity is actively doing something to appease one of his killers, which just seems out of bounds. It seems to get anything done that goes against the entity's will you would have to rebel against him in some way.
---
They willl remove Legacy, but you can keep it if you pay the low low price of 4080 Auric cells!
---
For real though BHVR and DBD have 2-3 years before a more competent team get a whiff of how much the assymetrical slasher genre can make and just kill it in a month
---
I'm gonna have to correct you there: Good nurses didn't complain but anyone who didn't play well without omega-blink or didn't play her at all were and are crying rivers of salt
---
I play the game every day but never find the map. The last time I got the map was probably about 2 weeks ago
---
I'm so happy she is getting balanced!
---
j.d.s power is to give survivors brain freezes lmao
---
I got access because I've been playing since launch and I grinded my ass off during the events to get them. They didn't just give them away
---
She also hunted armed soldiers, more dangerous game than her mother ever did.
---
Ikr? So many things can cause so much trouble, i was thinking like proximity based subtitles if we are in range where an average person could hear fine we get a subtitle cue to warn us, would help significantly
---
Same! Especially the ones where you compliment each other on certain plays, makes me feel like less of a potato sometimes :')
---
Legion (in both cases)
---
Why?
---
They have the coolest character concept in the game hands in my point of view, good perks, great cosmetics, fun power with the right build + I'm a big fan of being able to vault stuff the same way survivors do and being able to apply pressure quick over the map.
---
Why do I like playing against them the most?
---
By playing Legion I also learned their biggest weaknesses and I exploit them as much as I can
---
Damn, Dead by Spirit turns back into DBD... and that takes less than 3.5 years, like the fucking Nurse nerf! This is actually huge!
---
Well... Guess Spirit's Daddy will take over... xD
---
Freddy probably. I liked him before his rework and even more now. He‚Äôs a meta killer and just feels good to play with map pressure and ways to combat loops and can also soft counter borrowed time and do mind games. A bit of everything
---
Same ear that Hoyfield got bitten off LMAOO
---
Let's say I'm not that great with skill checks
---
But for real, Sidney's house would be cool. Even Sidney as a survivor!
---
Found the killer main
---
Unless they don't want to spend money on a Licensed Killer just for the teachables.
---
Find and down a survivor in the first minute, hide, wait for the unhook, tunel, mori. Rinse repeat. Match finished in 5 min. Yep, not even close. At least with keys you get to play the game for a while.
---
Keys need generators to be done unless it's endgame. We can see a key on the lobby and dodge it, and unless someone runs the very unmeta Plunderer's, it's very rare to see one.
---
Ebony moris have to go. Keys just need an animation when opening the hatch and maybe an extra condition.
---
That's the dbd community. Toxic as all hell.
---
It‚Äôs not 50/50. There‚Äôs more than two choices to be made and there is more than one party. Spirit player doesn‚Äôt choose her decision randomly so neither should you. 
---
Unless you want to throw and make things worse for your teammates.
---
ok now this is epic
---
Actually, his perks forbid this
---
Exclusive items I played for a long time - gone
---
Events, the only thing makes the same game a bit more exciting - gone
---
This is game is going the wrong way, sadly
---
The swamp is good but it has zero pallets
---
Bbq is meta and spine chill is still great. I get what you mean tho
---
 This is game is really focused on sounds
---
If you had one of these I doubt you would be too happy. How would you feel if they made the game free to play or locked Prestige cosmetics behind a paywall or just outright gave them away?
---
Dude you're supposed to give survivors free unhooks rather than pressure them like the critical objective that they are, don't you know? How else is this guy gonna get to red ranks if it's not by killers giving him a free pass?
---

---
Memes aside:
---
**Dedicated Servers** - ~~Turn them off kthnkz.~~ Honestly while I think the experience is worse with Dedicated Servers I understand why they're on live and not on PTB. I hope they'll be improved in the near future.
---
**Tomes** - The difficulty of the later tomes have been a big point of controversy, and I hope Behaviour considers making the later tomes easier. Tome 4 looked nearly impossible, and I suspect a lot of people will go into full farm mode to try to finish it.
---
**Exclusive Cosmetics** - Get cucked people who bought Gold Feng for $500 lul. Jokes aside while I understand why Behaviour is doing this I'm a little disappointed that they aren't giving anything to the people who already had these cosmetics. It was already bad enough when they made free versions of some of these cosmetics (Chuckles / Iron Chuckles, Dweard / Dwearder, Moustache Jake / Old Man Jake) but now those people are getting pretty much nothing for their devotion to the game. ~~Which also says nothing of the people who spent $500 to buy Gold Feng from a key reseller.~~ I really feel like these people should at least get a charm or something. You could make it so the keys don't work after the update, but as someone who has the event cosmetics from Lunar New Year / Summer I feel a little disappointed that the exclusives I grinded for are going to be given to everyone for free. ~~And again: I didn't pay $500 for them.~~ I don't think they should do "legacy 2" for these cosmetics since it doesn't fix the core problem about key resellers, but if those who had them were given a charm that would be a nice token of gratitude.
---
**Spirit Changes** - Woo boy here's the big one. I will say right now that as someone who's advocated for Spirit changes quite heavily these changes really **don't** fix the issues I have with her. Instead of fixing the core issues with the lack-of-counterplay with Spirit they instead gutted her addons to make her weaker overall. The issue is that Spirit's problem never was addons, as she is one of few Killers who can be played effectively without addons because you can't *tell* if she has addons. The main strength of Spirit is not her power itself, but how easy it is to use and how many abilities she has beyond her base power. (IE mindgames) But I'm just shouting into the wind by saying these changes are bad without going into why, so...
---
* *Collision during Power* - I feel like this was a non-issue that people invented as a boogeyman for why Spirit is low-skill. Truthfully this would rarely happen and the only real reason this was a problem is because of how it interacted with the Prayer Beads addon for the sake of gen grabber / totem grabber builds. A far bigger issue that I notice isn't mentioned is **Spirit's ability to fully hear sound while phasing.** The main issue with Spirit being able to hear sounds (notably pained grunts) is that this eliminates a lot of the counterplay to Spirit. You can't "juke out her phase" when she just follows the sound of your Survivor. This further leads to the infamous problem that Spirit can only be reliably countered with Iron Will, since it's the only way for her to not brainlessly track you when you're injured.
---
* *Window vaulting animation* - Thank god for this. Again I don't think this was the core issue but it was another problem on a list of problems that made Spirit a lot stronger than she needed to be.
---
* *Adjusted speed curve post-phase* - To my understanding this basically changes how long her lunge is after phasing. This along with the addon changes will help give Spirit more counterplay.
---
* *Add-ons (Prayer Beads)* - The only real addon change of note here is Prayer Beads which... oof. Got Frank's Mix Tape'd. I think 99 times out of 100 Prayer Beads are going to be objectively terrible and completely pointless to run. Similarly to Frank's Mix Tape it's really good that this change was done but it sucks that this addon is pretty much a waste of bloodpoints now.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
I wanted to do the 2 basement hooks with agitation and ended up with an easy 4k, all of them trapped around the shack. I gave the last one the hatch because it was clear he was new but i belive 1 hook in the basement will start a chain of traps going off of you aet it up correctly
---
They say it was incorrectly given, so I have no idea
---
I'm not playing survivors so much, so it doesn't work for me really. 
---
Still their decision is horrible. They are literally saying gofuckyourselves to people who supported them since 2016 and played the game ever since. Too bad this decision will not be canceled, because this time no one will listen to the minority.
---
Yea I know but I dont always want to run iron will.  It seems like his groans are so much louder than everybody else's. Smfh
---
It‚Äôs been confirmed that she can no longer collide with survivors while phasing, She now has a vaulting animation, and her speed boost coming out of phase walk was changed. And a ton of add on changes including a prayer beads nerf
---
Would you be okay with consoles getting a console only event where they could grind out the rewards?
---
Doubt. She literally hums the lullaby her mum hummed as she was dying constantly.
---
I can assure you she is still powerful at the right hands. If you get 4Ked against every spirit, you just need to get better at the game.
---
The Entity exists across time and can pull in dead people.
---
You truly are a vessel of the entity
---
Thanks for the advice man. Now i have become the worlds best survivor after your incredibly helpful tips and tricks!
---
No because nurse is still in the game no killer will be better than nurse but me personally I will feel like  better player when playing spirit if that makes sense
---
I doubt it. Spirit actually has a good candidate for her dad as a killer.
---
Looks to be the same up until she vaulted the window.
---
That's the worst totem in the game, and yet the devs say that Haddonfield has worse totem spawns.
---
Also very true. DbD is so very RNG and situational. That‚Äôs why I like it so much. You never know what might happen.
---
do locker pulls count?
---
The glass shards in her body start to glow when she phases
---
&gt; I'm playing in different ways to complete the challenge, using perks I wouldn't use
---
This is what I really appreciate about it, I've got my "go to" perks that I work well with, and I generally don't switch up what I'm using.  But the challenges are making me use brand new builds, and while they're rarely "optimal" I have fun with the variety.  I was doing the "heal 10 health states" last night and went full medic mode with Botany Knowledge, Empathy, and We'll Make It (and Alert because I don't want to be completely helpless lol) and I got 8 heals in one round against a killer running Thanatophobia; I really felt like a medic, and that I was actually doing a lot of good in countering the killer by healing injured states ASAP.
---
You do realise that this is a game with completely digital content that you have no guarantee to be able to access from one day to the next, right? It's in the EULA you agreed to when playing the game. That same EULA allows them to release whatever content they want for reduced prices, or for free.
---
You had the cosmetics for a good deal of time when few others had them - you know how you got them, so be proud of that if it matters to you. Don't rely on recognition from other people - it hardly matters what other people think of what you did in game.
---
yes.

did it, jsut need to be on the gen when it's done.
---
with the right speed addons you could be pig 2.0 tbh, I never undestood how missing your power gave you a reward instead of punishing , good change
---
SWF isn‚Äôt a problem, some killers do need a lot of love tho
---
Trapper's dad's company was bad because Trapper's dad was bad.

for sure! yesterday I versed a ghosty who killed everyone and after I messaged him gg and I told him how we kept laughing at how much he was exposing us and he complimented me on my 360s. and after we played a different ghosty who wasn‚Äôt doing super well (he wasn‚Äôt tunneling but he def could have to get more kills easier) but we ended up 3 genning ourselves (damn you Hawkins lab), so he got some extra kills. after we had a laugh at that map and he said he probably wouldn‚Äôt have won if we hadn‚Äôt done that by accident but I told him he was still a really good killer :) this game is way better when nobody plays scummy
---
A personal Fuck You to the people playing Plague now that everyone has to Self Care and spend Medkits.
---
Actually just a personal Fuck You to anyone who plays Plague in general.
---
Holy shit
---
Red glasses ruin the cosmetic
---
I like the hospital. Sure its hard to find gens but there are a lot of windows you can use.
---
:(

The title and simple stance change is cracking me up more than I would have thought

Behaviour: We don't want to add any perks that are too strong and become mandatory to use.

BBQ, Ruin, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Exhaustion Perks: *Nervous Monkey Puppet meme*
---
It's also perfect for an item farming build with plunderer's instinct and ace in the hole, but at that point you might as well admit you're sabotaging your team.
---
It all depends on the killer. You can get quick downs and snowball with killers like Nurse or Billy. With Plague I can vomit on the 4 gens and force the survivors to do nothing or get sick at the start of the game for nothing, which guarantees a 1-hit down or a Corrupt Purge. With Trapper you can basically secure a 3-gen because there's usually 2 gens that cannot be touched for you to set up around, leaving you with only 1 gen to worry about. With Pig you force people to walk around, getting you the very important early Party Hat.
---
1. It's not an item, It's a mechanic of which an item interacts. The key was mentioned because it's directly connected to the hatch, nothing more. 
---
2. There is. Powering the hatch is an acceptable way to spend time as some players destroy totems even though ruin isn't active. Something that gives survivors an additional means of escape is far from useless. 
---
3. You're just missing the point. 
---
4. A single person can carry, they have and will. This is probably the bottom of the barrel when it comes to anything you can think of to say "no it doesn't work because"
---
5. No offense but if "Everyone's dead and we didn't do gens, How am I going to escape now?" Is your reply I don't think your input would be any better than what I figured initially. 
---
6. I've humored you enough.
---
Honestly I think that a lot of killers don't like that they have to actually try finally, which happens around purple rank.
---
I envy you. I'm not sure if it's my region but all I get are death threats. The last genuine positive chat was 2 months or so back, but I will admit it was very nice when it did happen.
---
If I buy pig, it'll be in the shrine the very next week. I think it's my fault it's been so long

Well now we got our answers and guess what? XD

Imagine paying 500$ for a skin just to be fucked over by the devs 
---
I would literally cry
---
fun fact: Bubba's actor was so fact in TCM he had to intentionally throw himself into shit to slow down because he was catching up to Sally to easily
---
&gt;Mostly cause the Spirit nerfs don't address any of her core issues and are just bandaid issues to problems that the community QQed about which proves that Behaviour has no idea what the actual problem is with Spirit and just listens to Rank 20s who cry the loudest
---
nvm i was wrong, we're all getting it
---
Coming out of phase she keeps her speed for a second.
---
Oh my. So adorable!
---
It's almost like we all share a love of this game and hopefully through all the frustrations and annoyances can still be there to make it fun for each other because it's only through our interactions that the game comes alive
---
Really surprised more people aren't talking about the fucked-upness that is Bubba's family. Definitely the most dysfunctional family out of any of the characters
---
Evan was a good boy but he was beaten into being a monster. :(
---
Please keep calling her that
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to be a killer main.....
---
Power Name: Crippling Expectations
---
Id honestly wish you could do this on console Dx
---
 It's not that I always get 4kd...its that my teammates always either DC or die so fast which just makes the game harder for us. Thos is why I hate Spirit. No killer should have this much power and effect against players. It just ain't fair or fun.
---
Glad she's getting nuked. Fucc her and the ppl that always play her just bcuz she's OP
---
Its muddy, not great fps, skill checks are sketchy, but yet it's still my preferred platform
---
They looked like that before it was announced that they were becoming free. 500$ for a reskin is their own fault
---
Waaaghh! Boo hoo
---
How weird is it that I thought the Tome 2 challenges were easier than Tome 1?
---
Sure, there were some high numbers, but it wasn‚Äôt difficult, just time.
---
Let me rephrase, SWF with comms is a massive massive problem. The problem is the devs we're foolish and had the massive oversight when designing the game of people wanting to play together. they designed it for 4 total strangers with no way of communication. And they STILL treat it like that
---
you are crazy if you think she even moved on the tier list after these nerfs, her best feature being the power to pinpoint injured survivors, the ability to spam her power if used in short bursts and the mobility are still intact, these nerfs were much more quality of life changes for the survivors than trying to take down a killer
---
Same. 'Asshole survivors' fall right under '15 minute wait times' for why I don't play killer
---
Huntress buff to pick up and yeet the broken pallets as improvised weaponry when she's out of hatchets (also downed survivors)
---
In all reality they don't owe you shit.
---
It looks the same for me, but I know that it isn‚Äòt the same, WHERE IS THE DIFFERENCE
---
I'd like to see that just for the reaction from people who spent actual hundreds of dollars for that outfit. No offense but it's not worth nearly that much for the exclusivity, not even considering how the outfit looks..
---
They looked like that paying $500 for a default feng skin recollection to begin with üòÇ
---
35
---
I am saying it because both statements are true. Legion has very little power to get kills because their power actively prevents lethal hits. This is because it is extremely easy to get hits, as illustrated by the one "response" being to basically waste pallets. Like if they're super unsafe then sure it's probably a fair trade, but otherwise you're wasting pallets to maybe avoid something that A. isn't very threatening and B. will happen again shortly. It's like cleansing against Plague - the trade just really isn't worth it. If Feral Frenzy had some legit responses, worthwhile readily accessible options, then Legion could be buffed, but there just aren't a whole lot of options without fundamentally changing how Feral Frenzy works. Doubly so that they need to do so without encroaching on other killer's design.
---
Which again comes back to the point I'm trying to make - Legion's power isn't interesting and can't really be balanced because it's just an on command "do survivor things while being even faster" power. Feral Frenzy is basically a design trap, it's pretty much always going to be either neutered or oppressive. And BHVR will never make it oppressive.
---
Not really.
---
&gt;The huntressess' hound mask was something i was actually proud of. 
---
And now it's something we can all be proud of!!!!! :)
---
lol none of the exclusively being sold are worth anywhere near the asking price.  there are still a handful of exclusives not everyone will have, like bloodletting
---
&gt; ...some of the Tome 4 challenges are possible...
---
So you‚Äôre saying most of the challenges are impossible? Which ones, specifically?
---
Cause from what I gather, most of them are real easy.
---
- 6x Great Skill Checks with "This is Not Happening" -- Easy.
---
- 2x Blind a killer while carrying a survivor -- Put on a REALLY strong flashlight and stick close.
---
- 4x Chest Search with Plunderers -- I did the 5x chest in one game. Easy.
---
- 4x Pallet Stun -- Easy.
---
- Escape after everyone other survivor has escaped -- Ultimately easy, just takes a little luck.
---
- 5x Basement Hook with Agitation -- Easy enough. See any Youtuber‚Äôs Basement Build video.
---
- 8x Pallet/Gen Damage with Brutal Strength -- Easy.
---
- 180 second chase with Distressing -- You would have to purposely fail this one.
---
- 4x Damage same Generator -- Surveillance, easy.
---
- 5x Bear Trap Catch -- Moderate, decent with some luck, easy if you can get a farming game. Play friendly killer and you'll have survivors working with you.
---
- 4x Different Bear Trap Catch -- See above.
---
- 4x Sacrifice in Basement -- Easy with the right build. See Agitation challenge.
---
That leaves the two End Game Collapse challenges and the Dark Sense challenges.
---
And we‚Äôre pretty confident the Dark Sense challenge only requires you to be on the gen as it completes instead of 0-&gt;100%. Still hard, but not impossible.
---
So 3 of the 15 challenges, **on the last tier of difficulty** are actually hard...
---
So which ones aren‚Äôt possible again?
---
I actually haven‚Äôt tried it, but it would make sense to me.
---
Unironically shilling for corporate greed? Im done, don't even bother replying. Reddit was probably not the place to talk about this, most of you guys just Consume product and get hyped for next product
---
Not gonna comment the amount of your winter fire cracker
---
Yoink
---
First of all, her base power is not OP. I am glad her bullshit add ons are nerfed. And she is not the person who makes your teammates dc or give up, they made their own decisions because they don‚Äôt want to face strong killers, and you blame the killer for that? Interesting logic.
---
&gt;Billiam Chainsaw
---
YES! I love this!
---
Thank god I don't need to try and dig through ebay or other shady sites to try and get a fucking Dweard key for $50+ now.
---
right? collision is nowhere near something you can rely on. you have to literally stand on the one spot the survivor is and you only have 5 seconds to find it. and even then it doesnt guarantee you're facing them. even dumb Spirit users know to use their ears to compensate for the fact they jsut went blind.
---
You can see the mirror shards on her body shining if she's phasing, but it can be hard to spot.
---
Yeah, when you slug someone to chase someone else but the survivor wins the chase (meaning, you can't catch them quickly), the slugged survivor gets picked up and you end up with no hook instead of 1 hook of the first survivor. You might end up downing lots of people but getting no hooks while there is 1 person left doing gens in the background. Of course, if the survivors don't know what they're doing and can't keep up a chase for more than a few seconds or if they don't come to pick up and heal, they can't really recover from being slugged but they'd probably lose the game either way for the same reasons.
---

---
To be fair, decieve and borrowed time strictly exist to punish bad gameplay that is tunneling and camping.
---
Hope this isnt too dumb  of a question, but does this mean all skins will be available now? Or just everything that wasnt from an event like the summer bbq one? I just want all the skins on kate lol
---
You're not outsmarting a survivor by standing still if they can't determine if you are using your power or not. So no, they didn't fully fix Spirit. They made her fairer, but she is still bs. Until they make it so you can tell she is using her power or not, Spirit will still be OP.
---
Yaaaaaay
---
I'm a little bit butthurt about the wakisazhi changes since they were so fun but other than that its pretty ok
---
Drop and move on you'll either stun or have enough space to get to a safer looo
---
I think it's more that its irritating to have to stop and hold m1 when he hits you, also when your teammates waste time healing after. I think it's better to play vs him the same way you would plague.
---
Imagine still complaining about Legion after everything lmao
---
I doubt it will be Spirits dad ngl
---
There are lots of great reasons to take CI like you mentioned, I was only elaborating on that one reason because I think it's the only situation in which CI is a favourable option compared to Ruin, whearas in those other cases, although it's a great choice, it might be better but it might not be. Ruin is just a really good perk.
---
Have you heard Jane?
---
So yeah, this was bugged on PTB too and they didn‚Äôt fix it. It only counts one emblem PER GAME. Even if you got four iridescent or gold it counts one per game. So many of the challenges are still bugged :/
---
My game fucks around with me, and Disconnects me when it feels like it, I have seen others having this shitty Problem too, so maybe thats why, but some others do it because they dont like to lose...
---
the family that makes chilli together stays together

That was their reasoning;  make em free to stop grey market sellers. With that line of reasoning, they ought to also give out legacy too. Nothing is exclusive

I literally cannot rank up as survivor. I've had this game for more than a year and I can run around killers decently well, I'm a good killer (purple to red ranks) and I know what I'm doing yet the highest survivor rank I've had is 12. It's infuriating
---
Not always on certain skins
---
Imo she was barely nerfed. Once they make it so you can see her phasing more clearly then she'll be nerfed
---
The lack of collision is going to make it hard to tell what side of the generator the survivor is on.
---
&gt; So which ones aren‚Äôt possible again?
---
Mostly just the Last Minute Hero one/s, since Dark Senses were more or less confirmed to have been badly phrased in the description.
---
Just give them to everyone, cause why not
---
Any store cosmetic will still have to be purchased. They said that they're giving exclusive skins to everyone to stop key resellers from scamming people.
---
That being said I find it odd that some exclusive skins (notably the streamer skins like Ohmwrecker's Wraith skin) aren't being given away. My educated guess is that this is because they'd have to ask the streamers for the rights to give their "merchandise" away for free.
---
Still hoping for Charity Case 2 ngl.
---
Yeah, I went to hardvard
---
I honestly still don‚Äôt think so, SWF used to be a much bigger issue, but no it‚Äôs only a problem with certain killers.
---
Legacy is sold on the grey market too but i guess bhvr only cares about other exclusives
---
Once you get teabagged and SWF body blocked / flash lighted enough times, you start watching those old slasher films and are like "I totally understand the villain's motivation" lol
---
I know, I was agreeing with you and giving more info for other people.
---
If someone buys a $200 account for a couple pieces of clothing, that's their problem

I personally kinda want zombie Ghostface. It's the one I use to wear for Halloween as a kid.
---
lol no one paid that much
---
There's a whole discussion to be had about how camping and tunnelling are far too effective but I don't want to get into that discussion. I just want to say that I think it's bullshit that the only way to counter these mechanics is to run these perks, and even if you use them you still can't really stop someone who's sticking to these strategies.
---
archives should have a progression system similar to milestones on mobile, and the ability to choose from a survivor, killer or mixed branch with exclusive rewards for each tbh
---
I always explore different builds in the game and it's so much fun. I'm glad this game is having people use different perks, although I'm not sure if it'll make people switch their entire builds. I have a friend who religiously uses Dead Hard and Self-Care (with no medkit). So it would be cool if the game rewarded you for using different perks (that you already own). Maybe as a daily challenge or something.

On one hand, I have all those event cosmetics on PS4, and now I switched to PC, and I'd enjoy having them because I DID work for them, I just didn't work for them HERE.

But I'm pretty sure it's primarily just their fix to those people who lost theirs randomly, without having to address if someone REALLY earned it/lost it.
---
TBH I rarely ran her recharge addons because her power charge rate is already good enough and the other addons just gave more functionality. Kind of a weird nerf, maybe they figured people would gravitate to them after "Spirit Burst" and Yakuyoke got toned down.
---
Honestly my "every game" build is usually some form of talisman + shoes, usually the green ones.
---
I wish they could add Sidney to the game. It'd be really fun to have a survivor who's perks were based around being very experienced with serial killers targeting her, lol
---
That guys is wrong, Stridor is a nurse teachable.
---
There were also alt outfits of exclusives. Nothing matters anymore. Cant trust them when they call something exclusive
---
During the updates, a lot of my event items, including the hammer, have disappeared from my personalization inventory. I‚Äôm hoping to gain them back now.
---
definitely quick enough, its literally 1 second per blink if you take into consideration the time your fatigued
---
You don‚Äôt really need monitor for Pig since you can reliably just crouch near the gen while avoiding line of sight from the survivors then uncrouch to grab them as fast as you can
---
"Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad!"
---
This looks like a clip of a new hack people have been using. If you clip into an object, it treats you like you're out-of-bounds and transports you to a random place in the map. This Feng likely used the tool to force the game to clip her, and took advantage of that. People can also use it to just walk through walls or under the map. Please report people you see doing this.
---
Lol that's awesome
---
Fr tho. I played a match yesterday and got caught because someone threw all the pallets down presumably for their mission, and was left to die on hook because my 2 remaining teammates who didn‚Äôt kill themselves were self-caring. Some survivors just don‚Äôt care about throwing the match if that means they progress faster through their levels.
---
21....
---
You can only hear the vacuum if you‚Äôre outside of the terror radius of the husk she leaves behind. Her phasing sound is her terror radius from her actual location while phasing. Prayer beads makes it so you hear it no matter where she is on the map.
---
You'd be surprised. You can go to websites like Kinguin and find people selling Donkey David for like $200. In particular I've seen Ace's Taipei hat being sold for numbers in the thousands which is beyond ridiculous to me since it's literally just his regular head with a different coloured hat.
---
i‚Äôm not sure who the new killer will be but if you aren‚Äôt looking for memes this probably isn‚Äôt the sub for you. let people enjoy things
---
Who in their right mind would pay that much for a skin in the first place though? At most, I'd spend like 15 bucks, tops.
---
Really? That sucks the game after this one, I got 3 credited
---
I don't run ruin, I hate playing against it, I run discordance instead, I'll slow the gens my damn self
---
I wish.
---
I could do without the window animation, I would rather them fix the glowing glass or something so we can tell when she is phasing. Or buff her footsteps when phasing so the survivors can hear her. The collision thing is very nice but I would even give that up to see or hear her phase during chases.
---
Oh yeah it may be. Sorry
---
Just the skins that the dev update mentioned, these are any that are code-exclusive and given for free like golden feng, green claudette or knucles trapper + some event ones like the lunar new year
---
the rest are still paid alongside with legacy and skins marketed as limited (like the survivor t-shirt that came from buying on the bhvr store)
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
There is a number of skins that hides the shards, it's not even a consistent effect and you have to be right next to her to even see it.
---
Aw man, that's amazing!   
---
And sometimes killers just need a few pointers, as they don't mean to play scummy. Most obvious cases are trappers who place traps in front of a hooked survivor and stay near as they don't know better. I had one yesterday and he seemed pretty grateful with the advice to put traps around pallets and windows, as he trapped nobody the entire match. It just feels like it'll improve the experience for everyone :')
---
BhVR doesn‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs taken them this long just to get us a battle pass and also have the ability easily sync up with your friends and also be able to stay with the same friends after a match. Heck they can‚Äôt even get dedicated servers up and running or able to drop a patch without bugs. 
---
All you can do it just play thru and normally within the first 2-3 days most people have their challenges done and the game goes back to its boring self, rank is just a number anymore and I don‚Äôt even bother ranking up anymore because the higher you go the worst it‚Äôs gets in this game with braindead teammates and super sweaty killers.

---
Ah maybe it‚Äôs not bugged in the same way any more. But it‚Äôs still broken. You should have got four that match for definite
---
It‚Äôs 6 seconds total. After 1 double blink you go through a 2.5 second fatigue stun. That ends up being 3.5 seconds that you are left after ur fatigue to get back ur second blink. 
---
3.5/2 is 1.75 (since 35/2 is 17.5). You are closer to having a 2 second cool down per blink, not 1.
---
Google is useful to get a general idea, and aliteral translation, but not what the words mean together, tone, or...anything, really. Just a general idea
---
You aren‚Äôt really supposed to mindgame it. Since there‚Äôs so many you kinda just run and try to stun the killer. Also the infinite if you have balanced landing
---
I am talking about Tome IV, not many are easy. Either way, even if you get multiple of them, you won't be able to claim the rewards until you go down the line and do them in order.
---
Aww, claud‚Äôs dad was actually a good guy. It was her mom that was disappointed, but only to protect her.
---
I actually like them, it lets me see if Im at least doing alright in the game or if I was a total disaster.
---
More like "is this a rank 20 killer? How did we get a rank 20 killer?"
---
~~end game scoreboard~~
---
"Oh... Rank 7? I'm sorry little one"
---
15 damn y'all fast lol
---
Sound is a huge factor, I totally agree, but personally I hit a substantial amount of people because I run into them. Like say on a Autohaven map, a loop with two cars and a pallet, indoor maps, basically any map where there‚Äôs tight spaces, I hit survivors pretty often.
---
You dont need to do 3 full gens for that challenge.  Just make sure you finish 3 gens so the perk pops and that's it.  Did it my first try and I'm not good at all.
---
imagine paying 500$ for a skin
---
They're giving people the Summer BBQ cosmetics too, if you're referring to the Kate shirt and Billy hammer.
---
Thank you for this comment. People here seem to just want everything within a few days as if their time playing this game is so precious that they feel they deserve it all. It's just simply fun having something else to do in the game and people don't see that unfortunately.
---
Its apparently just a bug...i hope
---
they removed the only 2 things I liked on the Yakuyoke Amulet.
---
If Im not mistaken, you actually only need to be on the gen when it completes to proc that challenge. You could literally SWF and have friends 99 3,gens,then you complete them, lose, and get it.
---
That being said, why is everyone in such a rush to get the challenges done as soon as they can?
---
Well they obviously need to fix the glass on the skins where you cant see it. I thought everyone pretty much agreed on that
---
New killer: shaman
---
I've already ran into farming at level 2. There will 100% be farming for a week or more at level 4.
---
Yeah that
---
Well, tbh I just assumed you had her...like an asshole...and that's a good point, I bought the Strode back in the day and d strike was on the shrine that week...I retract my statement
---
The only challenge pissing me off is the hook challenge where I have to rescue someone who rescued me
---
No pun intended?
---
The whole reason why we have event outfits is cause you get a chance to get em for free plus they had event exclusive with summer bbq items and I‚Äôll be honest I never see them used
---
Go fuck yourself lol
---
They are also trying to shut down those who are asking too much for the cosmetics or maliciously posting with no intentions of giving the correct code.
---
The 2 reasons that map is shit is because it's open as hell and there's no pallets. It feels big because it's so goddamn open
---
The Event is just an opportunity to get the cosmerics for free or in the case of the battle pass to get them for the price of single full skin. The event cosmetics (halloween) will just be at the usual AC prices.
---
Ok crybaby, calm down
---
The fuck is this from?
---
Best thing about this is that we're all getting the Dweard.
---
I think it‚Äôs actually pretty good to have it in there. It makes it fun and more rng. It‚Äôs basically opening an empty chest.
---
And I‚Äôm not saying this as a killer main. I play both but lean more towards survivor.
---
&gt; 1 day ago
---
You're right, you weren't.
---
2.5 seconds for 2 blinks is nowhere near enough, would you rather them increase the fatigue to 4 seconds? personally i would think thats worse, wouldnt you?
---
Sure, give me free legacy. Oh we aren't doing that? Well then can we fuck off with item gatekeeping.
---
"to the killer mains " oh yeah we are on r/deadbydaylight i forgot
---
Window/pallet pulls count, so I would think the locker pulls would too, but I‚Äôm not sure.

If she‚Äôs phasing across the other side of the map, normally you can‚Äôt hear it. With this addon, you can hear it. Now you have to make the decision on whether to leave a gen every single time she‚Äôs phasing, or guess that she‚Äôs across the map and keep working on it. You wouldn‚Äôt be making this decision if she wasn‚Äôt using prayer beads, because if you heard the phasing sound, you knew she was near you.

Only real issue is it'd require some AI work.  But it'd be cool if instead the Legion was an actual posse of sorts and you either bounced between characters, could station them in lockers/etc. for ambushes, or maybe they could follow you around and assist in chases temporarily.
---
It's much more effective to just find someone else. Try and get better at tracking and finding survivors. A lot of killers bring some information perks to find people easily. YouTube definitely helps!
---
Its like the cycle of obesity. Camping makes them lose survivors more, so they camp harder.

Thanks for the down vote. I didn't notice that you didn't get credit.

i literally never said she shouldnt be able to hear people but ok.

Freddys nerf was ages ago, the devs are learning to actually change shit so a lot of the community are happy.

Real material here for /r/tifu.

Yeah, it's a bit of a shitshow which is a shame because I was looking forward to the archives but now I really couldn't care less.

You're assuming they have pig. Don't be a dumbass.
---
I don't think Michael is angry, just pure evil. I've always taken him to be emotionless because of that, and anger doesn't fit in his persona, especially because you never hear him roar or rage in any of the films or the game. To him killing is like taking out the trash. It's just routine and something that has to be done.
---
Well he plays like a worse Tiandi so
---
Damn I‚Äôm happy about my 5 minutes considering it took 10-20 about a week ago
---
The code cosmetics sure, but the event cosmetics such as
---
&gt;Hound (The Huntress ‚Äì Event Mask)
---
&gt;Untamed Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Event Body)
---
&gt;Pro-Pain Hammer (The Hillbilly ‚Äì Event Weapon)
---
&gt;Free Song Bird Slip Dress (Kate Denson ‚Äì Event Body)
---
Should not be unlocked. Those were timed events that anyone with the game had the chance to get, if you are new to the game then it does suck that you can't get them but its a completely different story than the cosmetics being sold/scammed on online.

ps4 has an option where it'll screenshot your game whenever you get a trophy. Then he took a screenshot of his screen ig

So basically just Montos annoying wraith build from way back but with overcharge swapped out for pop. Once unblocked stay in cloaked for the chase and eat those pallets or mindgame like a boss. You‚Äôll soon get the challenge üëçüèº

Especially with recolours in the in-game store I see literally no reason to buy Golden Feng tbh.
---
And now the people who did buy it can feel even more stupid. :)

Feral Frenzy is only good when you want to feel like a real edgy teenage killer who goes around stabbing everybody but doesn't kill anyone, his power is completely useless
---
No, you're completely wrong, some game bans are in game only, but this is still a game ban. It literally says game ban, if it was a VAC ban, it would have said VAC.

I want Centurion as a killer to just punch through pallets and eventually punch the survivors

This is my next challenge and I was going to do the bog standard boring Doctor build but i‚Äôm definitely doing this now. I even have a Wraith daily too.

Darn I played long and hard for some of those exclusive cosmetics.

Lol you played yourself op... live and learn.
---
That's how it works, lol
---
The event was fine, it was the same as most of the other events of complete gens and use special hooks, what made it a rough time for the game was that it was during the SAW chapter iirc which pretty much broke the audio of the game which is pretty important in this game.

Hey Neoninfinity,
---
love your work on the icon and add-on packs. Been using them now for \~3 months and I'm not getting tired of them.   
---
I'm aware that you're kinda busy and a lot is going on right now.   
---
I was kinda curious if you could provide me the .psd file for the black perks. (black base/white icon)  
---
I would happily edit them myself and maybe even upload the files for all the other fellows around waiting for an update. Of course just if you're fine with it. All the credits are going to you.   
---
I'm not in a hurry about it, just nicely asking.  
---
Have a decent day, pal.
---
Look for someone else which you should be doing anyway and come back later or pick them up and get it over with and carry on chasing them it's really not difficult. Don't tunnel and you'll be amazed. One stab isn't going to hurt your game if anything you're hurting theirs by tunneling.
---
well yes but actually no
---
But I want to see a breakdancing, headspinning Billy using his chainsaw to propel his spins!
---
Ah yes, the reactable mixup, my favorite.
---
i have legacy 3 survivors and i wouldn‚Äôt care if they handed them out to everyone lmao. it‚Äôs seriously not a big deal
---
Right? The least they could do is hide it behind a tree or something.
---
I was playing a normal match with my brother, we were facing a Myers and everything was normal. He got me for the second time and put me in the hook and that's when the trouble started by me not making the sound of getting hooked, and then my camera kept following him as if I was on his shoulder and his animation would bug out, also he wasn't able to jump windows or break pallets until he grabbed another survivor. He was able to put the survivor in the same hook as I was and my avatar had the crows around the head also was moaning as if I was at the ground. Anyway, he killed everyone and closed the hatch, at this point I went to the bathroom thinking the game would end with the "time's up" but to my surprise it didn't and he disconnected before I was able to.
---
are you a low level or nah?
---
what, are you going to not play one more game?
---
Yeah, no one's saying that; I and a lot of other spirt mains are really happy with these changes.
---
Nurse basically only became more punishing if you're bad at her. The servers hurt her infinitely more than the nerfs.
---
I've had hearing problems on and off for a while now and the game is so much harder if you can't hear. Some things I've found helpful:
---
For survivor - Use spine chill or premonition. I use spine chill and it basically means you know when the killer is approaching you just by looking at the perk wheel. I use this even when I can hear fine if I'm in a party chat as it means I can focus on listening to my friends rather than the game. 
---
For killer - Any perk that lets you see auras will be helpful. Whispers would be good too so you know when to leave an area. Some of the people in the thread mentioned stridor but in my experience it's not loud enough for a hearing impairment so I'd recommend perks that give visual effects. BBQ, I'm all ears, bitter murmur, rancor, nurses calling are some off the top of my head. Discordance/Surveillance are good for monitoring gens. 
---
As for your question about survivors getting scared and having a good time - play whoever you want really. Scariest for me would be Ghostface and Myers because of the stealth, Spirit because she's so strong, Hillbilly because of the instadowns. I love playing against Huntresses too because if I dodge a hatchet I feel like a god, and if I get hit by one I can't help but feel a little impressed.
---
What are you talking about? Just build anti healing and everything will be... wait where'd my gens go?
---
You're a comedy genius
---
THANK YOU
---
these are the old game icon. the black borders was larger there were perk of red rarity
---
But why does it need to be a challenge perk? Aren't the purpose of perks suppose to make improvements to your gameplay?
---
How dare all players who didn't even have a chance to get that jacket get the privilege of enjoying an amazing cosmetic! Get fucked.
---
Nope, all stock, no changes
---
You have Dwearder. It‚Äôs red glasses instead of black.
---
Ya know you can point and click to move outta the way

 I know my skill rating is low because I'm simply terrible at the game I won't deny that I get my ass handed to me 9 times out of 10
---
Agreed. People who didnt play during the Lunar/Summer events shouldnt have them. The code-ones maybe, since they're being sold for insane amounts of money and the devs should probably stop that from happening, HOWEVER, the Hound, Untamed Donkey, Sunset and Pro-Pain aren't being resold for money (because they dont have codes) and should never be re-released. I hope that they at least give compensation like an alternate version of the cosmetics that's maybe like pure gold or something for us that you know, actually earned them.
---
What the hell is that rose offering above the bloody party streamers?
---
I'm pretty sure it'll be an ancestor, not her father. Can't wait to see!
---
remember when trees could make killers stuck between pallets and prevent you from vaulting/breaking one?
---
She‚Äôs still going to be insanely frustrating to play against since it‚Äôs still going to be a constant guessing game, but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction
---
As far as the perks go maybe try something that gives more visual cues than sound. What comes to mind right now is Spies from the Shadows. It really helps to not lose ppl in a chase when the disturbed crows give you notifications. Also Surveillance makes the sounds of gens louder so that might help. Obviously Stridor as well. You can also try Demogorgon since you can see when ppl step on your portals. Those are just a couple of things that came to mind.
---
Man I always slap on spine chill. Makes me wish that there were mics so I can scream to my fellow survivors "MOVE MOVE MOVE!"
---
haha I love this meme template
---
Yeah, me too! Was scared it was just a giant waste of time, but I actually had it in hand when I got back to the lobby. Pretty cool cause usually when someone dc‚Äôs I don‚Äôt even get a chance to move around.

---
No, we don‚Äôt need to change your mind, only your lack of empathy
---
Made the map hella dark but there others that made the map brighter as well. These were a Blendette's wet dream before they got retired as an offering.
---
The lunar and summer ones should be kept fully exclusive or they should give alternate versions of them to us that actually earned them. Especially the Lunar ones were an actual nightmare to get since people would cosntantly sabo your hooks and the balance of the game as disgusting. The code-ones I'm kinda on the line with, but would rather they just deactivate all unused codes for them personally.
---
Unblockable.exe is soooo far from being kensei... *presses dodge right and heavy* .... nvm
---
I‚Äôm honestly just curious if the models will glitch out if you stand on a survivor then phase back in.
---
That's pretty cool
---
That‚Äôs terrible! I didn‚Äôt play much survivor before going killer, but I remember the demo instantly getting all of us. Only thing worse than a Demogorgon is a pug.
---
Automatic upvote material
---
No
---
if you‚Äôve only repped 2 characters, that could also be why. the game doesn‚Äôt have a massive influx of new players, so it‚Äôs hard to find a balanced match
---
You need to think about the potential of the loops in each room. Something people who aren't the best as survivor think, is that, you need to get somewhere with a safe pallet or else the killer gets you but they dont think about the potential loop set ups you can do with just windows. Many rooms in hawkins have some great window that you can use as a way to extend the loop. Also if the killer does trap you at an unsafe pallet, the best you can do is bait him to swing so you can get the stun, but this does require you to get a good read on your opponent so it can be tricky.
---
It's not a mindgame if you have to guess?
---
Are all fighting games complete skill-less coin flips then? Because in most fighting games, you are only two bad guesses away from losing.
---
I wish they would revert legion to his release build, each rework they've done has just made him worse
---
Sound is especially hard to balance.
---
With colorblindness, anything highlighted in red including scratch marks likely weren't added with the intent of potentially making them hard to see, so allowing one to tweak the colors or make this information more available doesn't seem unfair.
---
With sound, though, things were designed around it being hard to hear. For example, a directional indicator that shows where a survivor was heard would be way OP.

Yeah I've noticed that my skill level always grates as lower than my enemies and my allies simply because I haven't played the game enough but not being able to find matches is why I don't play enough I've also noticed that for some reason when searching for a match it never wants to leave continent it'll change skill rating it'll change connection but it'll never change to global and I think that might be the main reason I can't seem to make it

Court just needs his cloud to disable the repair action, and the bottles to fly like huntress hatchets at full charge.  So you have map pressure by throwing bottles at far away gens.

It is fun that for the most i have played and been played with her i didn't know it and i haven't still seen it in-game or video of this to know if this is true.But yeah,it is needed. It is only used to fake her power in pallet which is ridiculously strong

*Before going into the concept, let us all pray that Konami would be willing to give BHVR a license to use content from Silent Hill.*
---
*Okay then, let's get into it.*
---
#New Location: Silent Hill
---
##The Pyramid Head
---
*Music: [Chase](https://youtu.be/WShknpNpHbY)*
---
###Primary weapon: Great Knife
---
###Ability: Strangle
---
The Pyramid Head grabs a Survivor by **tapping the Power button**. Once the Survivor is in The Pyramid Head's grasp, he begins choking them. The Survivor will be faced with a skill check, giving them an opportunity to escape. If they succeed, they free themselves, but are put in the Injured state. **Strangle** has less range than The Pyramid Head's standard attacks, but can bypass the Injured health state, if the Survivor **fails** their skill check. If a Survivor is already in the Injured state, they will not be given a skill check, and The Pyramid Head can carry them to a hook immediately.
---
###Passive: Terrorize
---
The Pyramid Head's presence is so distressing to Survivors, that repairing generators and using items takes **10% longer** while inside his Terror Radius. This ability scales with Survivor perks that buff repair and item-consumption speeds.
---
###Perks
---
**Creature of the Fog**
---
You have a way of getting inside the minds of your victims. If a Survivor is rescued from a hook, they are afflicted with the **Dread** status effect for **60 seconds**. While this effect is active, the Survivor takes **5/10/15%** longer to use items and repair generators.
---
**Exhilarating Hunt**
---
You are aroused by the thought of tormenting the sinful. After putting a Survivor into the Injured state, gain a **25%** bonus to Bloodpoints in all categories, stackable up to **50/75/100%**, for each consecutive time you put a Survivor into the Injured state. Hooking a Survivor or putting them into the Dying state ends the chain, meaning you must put another Survivor into the Injured state before you can continue gaining Bloodpoint bonuses.
---
**Deliverer of Punishment**
---
You can sense the hope building in your prey. When a Survivor is hooked, the aura of any other Survivor within **8/10/12 meters** of them is revealed.

---
**Promise**
---
You have vowed to protect one Survivor. Their aura is revealed to you at all times, and you heal them **25%** faster than normal. Additionally, you gain a **6/8/10%** repair speed bonus while working on generators with this Survivor.
---
**Repentance**
---
You are determined to reconcile the sins of your past. For every Survivor you fully heal, gain a **25%** bonus to Bloodpoints in all categories, stackable to **50/75/100%**.
---
**Escape Artist**
---
You perform well under pressure. While being chased, pallets are highlighted through surfaces, and you can drop them **5/10/15%** faster.
---
A gentleman of culture, I see!
---
Maybe you could have multiple challenges activated at the same time so you don't have to throw the game to do something very specific. Flashlight save, pallet save, fully repairing a gen while injured are examples of things that **IF** allowed to activate at the same time reward altruistic gameplay and doing objectives.
---
What you're saying in your response is that you don't like doing the challenges, but you do them because you just want to have the rewards/achievements and don't care about the actual gameplay of Dead by Daylight...
---
Or if the pig drops you past the trigger you can crawl out even if it‚Äôs active
---
I'm really hyped for purple pants for Claudette and Hound, tho more for the pants.

If ur having trouble with sound then u can use stridor, nurses calling, deerstalker etc.
---
Legion would definitely be better with those 2 things but rn bhvr has other stuff to do.
---
Dude, console had those event, what the fuck are you on about.
---
I was wrong they made the speed curve more like the wraith. Sorry for the misinformation.
---
Judging by how often I fuck up parries or fall for feints. It is.
---
I‚Äôm not sure. I play a lot of killer because I solo queue most of the time.
---
I thought this was real for too long.
---
Fuck this is a shitty update
---
Right. Would not be as bad if they removed the ‚Äúin one match‚Äù requirement. Would allow casual play.
---
Ye bo4 sucked sadly. Next time I buy a cod game it's probably gonna be bo3 for shadows of evil and mods
---
When I was in the loading screen this sounds started, I was thinking that was the spirit breathing XD.
---
I will never understand some people's logic behind that. You pretty much just lose twice when you DC. So frustrating
---
I said its annoying. Even if you down the person and slug them to wait out the timer that isn't really a fun thing gameplay wise. Plus a survivor can counter being slugged by running Unbreakable along with DS. Its a poorly designed perk because of the unfun dynamic it creates between killer and survivor, I never said I had a problem dealing with it. People need to learn the difference between design and balance.
---
New killer apollyon perks
---
Hex: it all ends The same. When all generators are completed your miss recovery is 60% faster and gains 5% more recovery per successful hit in a tow to a maxium of 6 tokens  perk ends when the exit gates open
---
I bring war: The thought of the survivors getting away to a peaceful rest angers you when all generators are done all survivors suffer from oblivious 
---
Only wolves remain "the survivors will learn from this experience " if you are able to sacrifice three survivors and if the last survivor escapes through the exit gate you will receive 100% bloodpoints bonus
---
Power :Apollyon's insight : while in chase you can prepare your blade for a gleaming strike thrusting you foward and if it makes contact with a survivor you rush foward bringing them with you if they hit a wall they are pinned against a wall and will be downed and suffer from deep wounds
---
Dropping a pallet is point and click survivors are cheap.
---
billy is the perfect killer, he is easy to pick up but hard to master, Fun to play against and fun to play as, He is strong but fair.
---
you are prob talking about billys who back scratch (when they wait to use their chainsaw till they are basically touching you) which you can easily avoid. 
---
Bad billys are M1 killers till you are in a dead zone, When you spawn in check your surroundings to see where pallets and vaults are, if you see a dead zone. Dont run there.
---
If you have an issue with curving (which if you are playing against curving billys you are good enough to know billy is an amazing killer) then try to be unpredictable, understand the billy is going for curves and work around it, dont hug walls.
---
Run SB if you want to get out of Dead zones, if used properly its the best exhaust perk in the game.
---
Honestly dissapointed...
---
Was the Donkey Jacket for the event also the one that was available at the Korean event?
---
You are incorrect. Currently spirit continues at phase speed for 0.5 seconds after phase ends then drops to her base speed immediately afterwards. With the changes her speed will scale from phase speed to normal speed over the 0.5 second duration post-phase. This is unequivocally a nerf of spirits base kit on top of nerfing most of her powerful add-ons.
---
Yeah, Nintendo has always been picky about the games it allows and updates. Happened like that all the way back to the NES.
---
Yeah. That always gets me whenever I see this meme.
---
I know lot of people lost their event cosmetics, this is a good thing for them at least.
---
Yea I dont understand it either, I mean you also lose all the Bloodpoints and have bassicly wasted the whole round for nothing
---
I hate it when everyone destroys the totems out in the open/corner of the map so when NOED proc's we can't fucking find it! Lol
---
Jake dad's was a slave driver. I am surprised he wasn't a rich southenern with a cotton plantation.
---
My group tried making me a tank in a healing chamber (best armor for the time, honey, campfire, etc).
---
He killed me in about a minute after my potion. Even with all of us hammering him, the lowest we got him is 40%. Maybe next session...
---
Yeah I just reread. I‚Äôm sorry for the misinformation.
---
I second this
---
Rip
---
Uhm...these are actually pretty easy, yeah the next ones are fucked but...I only have like 3 challenges left, they are honestly really simple..3 and 4 are gonna suck biiiiig dong but these are indeed do-able.
---
There is still reason for complaining. The reasons aren‚Äôt as bad, but there is still ample room for improvement on both the killer and survivor side. Just because it was worse then does not negate the issue now, especially with 1 vs 4/5 competitors coming out more and more.
---
And so is running slower bc of connection. Yes Bill might have had hope, but we can't know that
---
A good name for the killer would be ‚ÄúThe Shogun‚Äù
---
Bunnas screaming with Billy's ability is horrific
---
Centurion as survivor please. One of his perks is to punch the killer in the face and stun them.
---
While Michael can stalk anyone from the survivors to then turn that evil on the entire team of survivors he isn‚Äôt as efficient in stalking as GF is because while he stalks each person individually he can do that faster than Michael and doesn‚Äôt have to worry about being spotted as easily. I feel like the entity sends out Michael when she‚Äôs looking for a quick fix and GF when she‚Äôs looking for dinner and a show. Michael is McDonald‚Äôs to the entity while GF is that elusive burger joint that‚Äôs only open on February 29th and costs $500 to even get in line for.
---
It‚Äôs actually just that particular window, I‚Äôve seen a handful of clips where the same thing happens.
---
Near impossible if they use the schoolgirl costumes.
---
Imagine being this pressed over a non-gameplay changing addition. 
---
also comparing legacy to any old event is an incredibly stupid comparison and you should refrain from that.
---
A Tentacle Monster who is ~uguu~ Kawaii on the streets, and a Lovecraftian in the sheets.
---
Yes. I guess i should have worded it differently and i like your example so i‚Äôm not gonna try and make it better!
---
I assumed my font choice would show the sarcasm in the post...
---
So many people assumed they were gonna nerf spirit into the ground.
---
1) If they are so dumb and desperate to get codes and buy it from scammers, it is their fault. 
---
2) Even if it is for people that do not have exclusives and are desperate for them, it is a HUGE disrespect for those who already had them. For me at lest. I supported Devs since Beta and bought everything they offered me, just because I wanted to support them. And now all I get for my devotion - this. I don't feel like I want to support them anymore if they treat old players like this. 
---
3) It changes the fact I earned them legit. If I knew they are going to give everything I worked hard for so long later for free, I wouldn't waste my time playing those events.
---
4) I got all my exclusives either from events (in case of hound mask f.e.) or from events like PAX 2016. I never bought exclusives and I am deeply offended by their decision to give away skins that were valuable for me. They still remain, but they will no longer the same as they were.
---
5) If everyone is super, then no one is.
---
I wish I could give you more than one upvote
---
nurse kinda has bad mobility, all you have to do is be unpredictable and then hide well and she‚Äôs lost you. only once have I played against a nurse who absolutely demolished against that tactic, and that was before her god-sent nerf
---
Damit, Dwight, stop tea-bagging infront of him!
---
Rank 1 be like
---
Pop, ruin, nurses, bbq is what I use
---
Well you made most out of your situation. Everyone liked that.
---
And how do you think the survivor who just got downed as soon as they stepped off the hook cos the killer? DS isn't supposed to be fun it's to punish asshole tunnelers if you don't like it don't go after someone that just got off the hook be a good killer and go for the one that unhooked them. I do it every time without a problem even if I'm losing and have no complaints and it's actually well designed after it was retouched up and nerfed, they're not going to nerf a perk just so that people can tunnel you need to learn how it works mate.
---
What buff did you read? All they did was nerf her in her power, out of her power, and nerf her add ons.
---
Oh rip, I thought you were going somewhere else with that.
---
Wait like, the dog? Because mine is a lil cuddle buddy ;^; I love my pug
---
Not really. Laurie is only in like two or three of the Halloween movies that are consecutive events in the same canon. And they are really just one large event as opposed to a series of isolated ones like the Ghostface killers.
---
I was also posting this suggestion at a lot of places.
---
Hey dude, logged in on my alt account to upvote you again üëç
---
Every other fucking game this seems to happen. I even got someone accusing me of hacking on xbone (lolwut) because I one hit downed him. 
---
Most survivors are pretty cool though, keep being you friendos.
---
He audibly angry grunts in Rob zombies Halloween, however that movie made Michael much more human
---
One guy DCd on the hook, but it still let it register as a sacrifice :)
---
That's not really a compensation, the pallet is useless if it's unsafe. It doesn't matter that there is 10 of them.
---
According to their November Developer Update, they are giving them to everyone for free to stop sketchy resellers from trying to sell them for hundreds.
---
I‚Äôm really excited to see how it turns out.
---
I feel ya. Many people got these when the player base wasn‚Äôt as good but now at lower ranks players are better and have decent perks.
---
"affect"
---
Free
---
Weird use of template, but ok
---
It‚Äôs requiem bro
---
Something's wrong I can feel it.
---
It's ghosty for me, I'm a pretty bad survivor but against that boy...fuck, he just appears out of fucking nowhere. Lots of fun though!
---
Pebble or stake out on survivors amazing for deafness. I share audio with another pc so we never know whose in the tr unless I have those two perks.
---
Also an equalizer is designed exactly for this. Some computers even come with one

I wouldnt say it's good for billy, your power gets cucked since you can't go around the map as much.
---
You can just do 3 gens together with your mates tho

Honestly it'll probably be slightly worse for getting phase hits but way better for disrupting the game.

For injured survivors sure,but without stridor and with the noise that her power makes it is very hard. For survivors it is not much but for the average spirit player is huge nerf,as now you have to guess the survivor's location instead of blinding running the loop and collide with them.
---
Tge window animation make her no longer immune to flashlights and yeah it was a thing that It was only for easy mind games
---
Crouch does nothing for Ghostface except hide his profile, making him harder to spot and Reveal. Your power can be broken if you attack, but it can also be broken by survivors looking at you. Your terror radius/red stain removal is tied to the power, not his crouching. However, crouching does make it easier to stalk people while in Night Shroud, as you are far more likely to avoid getting revealed during your stalk. Some Ghostface tips:
---
1. If you have half a bar of stalk or more, don't hit that survivor, even if they break you out of stealth. Walk away and save them for later.
---
2. Sometimes, it's better to grab a survivor off a gen instead of stalking them.
---
3. Really, save stalking for the mid-late game. The early game allows you to take advantage of your abilities as a stealth killer. On top of that, stalking can be risky, as you could be forced to chase as survivor with partial stalk, while still losing your power, whereas a grab is an instant down and a near-instant hook soon after. 
---
4. Take advantage of leaning. It makes you stalk faster, and makes you harder to Reveal.
---
5. Survivors can't hear you or your breathing, but they do hear your cloak rustling as you move, so grabs can be hard to get. This is where crouching comes in.
---
6. You can teabag survivors, with how fast you can crouch and uncrouch.
---
7. Aura-reading tips help a lot, since you can see them but they can't see you.
---
8. Ghostface excels on maps with low visibility, such as Lery's, The Game, Yamoaka Estate (the bamboo and reed stalks), Hawkins' Lab, and last but not least, Mount Ormond Resort (despite his black outfit, there are so many rocks and props that catching people is easy.
---
9. Stick to corners and the sides of the map for approach, so you aren't as obvious, but switch it up as necessary.
---
10. Use your power in the chase to trick survivors with your movements and intentions. Especially useful if you have his two best add-ons, Chewed Pen and Olsen's Address Book. These increase your Night Shroud recovery rate, and this allows you to gain your power back in RECORD time. Not only does this encourage repeated usage for any given instance, it allows you to chase a survivor you're close to Marking, wait for your power to come back, and then Mark them mid-chase for that sweet, sweet instant down.
---
And last, but not least...
---
Don't be afraid to just stab! You don't always have to mark and stab. Sometimes the best solution is simply the easiest one.
---
 Exactly how am I being dishonest?
---
I had a brief thought that Rin will actually become a new survivor, and Spirit will be reworked so extensively that Rin's Dad is the new Spirit. With masks.
---
Well, now you have a better chance as a survivor to avoid being hit with your random direction walk/run. You still have to randomly guess the direction and what you will do, but at least if you are full sprinting in the opposite direction, she has to do a 180 to hit you instead of just pressing M1 when she collided. 
---
Good spirit users will just use smaller phases around loops and come out of phasing earlier. Since her recharge meter codes not fully reset, it will still be a pain. 
---
I am hoping the speed boost reduction is a huge help.
---
I don't like it, it's not unbalanced but it's just annoying to play against. Like Iridescent Button Legion
---
HAHA I‚Äôm in danger!
---
I play both sides, but a map that allows you to completely feel safe against 90% of the killer list will never count as good design in my book.
---
Wats the one with the dunce hat
---
I'm just imagining Richtofen's annoying but splendid yelps when he gets hooked XD
---
I looped a Pig for a while and blinded her at a pallet just because I'm trying to learn how to use flashlights properly. All 4 of us escaped and she messaged me asking if I was the Ash. I was afraid she was gonna be mad at me but she just wanted to compliment my Hawaiian shirt and shorts lmfao it was so cute
---
It's not considered a grab unless you interrupt the locker entrance/exit
---
If anyone wants to know what other cosmetics are going to be available too
---
That sounds pretty fun, though it could become op. Instead, have the timer remove one gen at a time every minute
---
I‚Äôm putting my money on Billy or Plague. The next complaints are gonna be about killers that can insta-down. 
---
Make Billy have to refill his chainsaw with gas at a locker /s /s
---
But then you hear the Halloween theme and see a skull on the edge of the screen, *chuckles* I'm in danger.
---
"Pallets go **thwapm**"
---
Wow pc player are lucky af they get all these skins for free
---
I did this on my first game, I'm so proud of myself
---
I'm a 50/50 player and I only enjoy Killer when I'm ready to push myself and feel focused and confident. If I'm in a bad mood or tired, I play survivor
---
Corrupt is even better on hag.
---
The code exclusives were being sold for stupidly high prices and scammed- not to mention console players never had a chance to get them. However if you wanted to talk even exclusives I would understand. I think they should be earn-able only in their event.
---
Everyone is getting them if I'm correct not only PC players
---
sometimes you just have to fuck around a little bit. Slug a survivor every now and again. It keeps the game going and you get more progress. A 4k definitely helps but you can get merciless with just sacrificing three. It took me forever to get adept wraith. Just keep playing, you'll get it.
---
I just got run around on groaning storehouse trying to do adept wraith and was pissed at the end of the match when they all narrowly escaped. The one who I spent most of the match chasing sent me a gg though and I calmed down and we had a good friendly conversation. I was glad they messaged me.(ps4)
---
Buffed how?
---
I don't think it was at the top of the list, was probably one person on maybe the cosmetic team took upon himself to do and no one stopped them because it was super easy to do.
---
Make it so the survivor has to put down the item they are carrying to pick up the fuel can as well.
---
My favorite killer to play is Freddy. I was so stoked to have him in the game from the first news and even after the reworks he's a fun and unique killer to play. 
---
Against is Myers. The fact he has no terror radius and spinechill doesn't work in tier 1 is just horrifying. I also love when he sneaks up behind us and gives us heart attacks.
---
Fucking same. Its bullshit
---
Genuinely curious, how come you make a post, delete it, then repost it over and over again, like daily?
---
Nah they just felt survivors were still too op for killers so just like how they implemented screams for when survivors drop they  improved killer swing hitboxes when survivors are near windows to adjust for "infinite loops"
---
Bless you, I had a period where I felt like I HAD to run ds because it happened so much. Luckily I can use that slot for sillier perks again, partly thanks to people like you &lt;3
---
Just to clarify, there's no required level, and you don't have to do anything special to get it to appear. Also, you keep your unlocked teachable perks even after that character prestiges.
---
Normally the matchmaking is fast, the problem is often how far outmatched people are regularly.
---
Maybe something similar to a killer shack but without a pallet, one door, and maybe a window. but I‚Äôm thinking that the actual chests would be in a basement similar to the killer basement but without hooks and it‚Äôs filled with lots of crates and stuff to hide behind. There‚Äôs still flashing lights, smoke, and the whaling of the entity we‚Äôre all familiar with. The actual chests are locked by the entity until the required amount of generators is complete; no need to search them. Of course the chests loot raises in rarity for every one unlocked, the first having the loot pool of any other chest, the second chest has browns and yellows removed from the loot pool, and the last having the only purpled and reds. I‚Äôm thinking maybe have one open at 1 gen completion, than another with 3 gens completed, and finally once all the gens are done the last one is opened. Tell me what you think?
---
Personally I still won‚Äôt enjoy going against her but at least anal beads is not shit to deal with.
---
Hell yeah, light, light and then top heavy to insta-mori those little Meg mains!
---
Thanks you so much man! I wish had money to give you gold but I am spending all of it on ghostface
---
70% bad memes, 20% Otz, 5% good memes, 5% complaints.
---
Imagine if she gets the giant middle tree in shelter woods.
---
You have either not seen what it is at high ranks or a literally full of shit.
---
I know its an anti tunnling perk lol. What I'm saying is it gets value even if the killer is not tunneling. After a survivor is unhooked, I could easily find another survivor, chase them, down them, and hook them, and then find that survivor who still has DS active, down them, and gets DSd even when I am not tunneling. If the timer went away when another person got hooked, the perk literally would still punish asshole tunnelers as you call them, but not be so excessive that you can still use it well after you get unhooked.
---
Your point?
---
I fully get that, but the YouTube series uses the scientific definition wrongly. They pose hypothesis and do not fully vet it, but call it a theory. 
---
It annoys me as you have people denying certain aspects of science because they don‚Äôt understand what ‚Äútheory‚Äù actually means in context due to those situations. 
---
TLDR. I got the reference and know it is a joke.
---
Lad if you are gonna be sure about your statement at least do your research vac isnt used in dead by daylight, dbd uses eac
---
I don‚Äôt know why so many people can‚Äôt figure the meme out. The more I see it the more it just kind of irks me
---
This sometimes happens when a web is generated with too many available nodes for its level. As you found, restarting should rejoin some of the disconnected nodes. If it doesn't in the future, put in a support ticket on the official site.
---
Imagine lookong at a video game like work. Get a life
---
Looked it up. Apparently it‚Äôs a perk called underperform that was in the unreleased killer ‚ÄúThe Teacher‚Äù files. No one knows what it was supposed to do
---
Run a build that capitalizes on injured survivors. Problem solved.
---
the stand still strats practically never work. it's all about cheesing the damage ticks and it needs to be precise to a point that requires immense luck with packet loss and whatever. Just do rotations and if only one guy is alive prioritize surviving. We had 3 guys and me
---
Give people legacy, no accnt selling. Give people exclusives, no exclusive selling.
---
it's a perk that is not used by the game and it has no effect
---
this is why i run ruin AND pop goes the weasel.  
---
i'll slow down those gens one way or another.   
---
i'll also couple it with devour and thrill of the hunt sometimes.  or haunted grounds, but i just unlocked it so need to get it on some killers first.
---
When all 4 survivors are running DS you gotta pick somebody up eventually
---
As a Spirit main, needs were always gonna sting, but I have to admit it's fair.  I'm satisfied with this
---
I don't think they'd add that mask for any reason other than to stop people from asking for it. The cosmetics for killers aren't really jokes like that one is and while it would be fun to run around with that mask on it would also shatter the very little "horror survival" aspect this game has already
---
I'd imagine that they will still make SOME change to her to add counterplay, rather than just removing collision, but if they did all of that in one patch people would be crying it was another legioning
---
Nah man their whole new policy with the switch was to not mess around with 3rd party decisions besides the whole thing with the updates is on BHVR‚Äôs side
---
When I do that as killer I feel super awkward when it takes a while to find the hatch, but as survivor I love it to just be carried around like a sack of potatoes for a few minutes
---
That's not hard to swallow, that's just basic air, i was inhaling that before people started to complain about spirit
---
&gt; I mean they did advertise this one as being available for once and never again and people had plenty of time to support the devs by buying from the official dbd shop
---
did you actually use this as your argument when the developers released all of these exclusives originally, but didnt cave in to the whining that not everyone got them (and thus made look-a-likes as a middleground)?
---
thats rich lol
---
As someone who was extremely opposed to changes to the spirit I'm happy with most of these changes. Good spirits can still wreck survivors with mindgames at pallets but survivors now have more options.
---
The add on changes are fine as spirit is a killer who can do ok with not much help.
---
If any anti-spirit players think these changes aren't enough then kindly never make comments about balance again because you're an idiot.
---
I feel that
---
Sorry... PC only player. Never followed the console side of things. Did not realize they had equal chance at getting those event items.
---
Though: Did Switch get a chance at them? Would you be okay if consoles that didn‚Äôt have those events got them for the sake of grinding out the rewards?
---
What lawsuit?
---
*Head Tilt*
---
Say goodbye to 90% of purple rank survivors and all the red ones, lol
---
Except you can dodge, parry and counter in fighting games. You can react. You can see a punch, kick, or windup. Survivors don‚Äôt have a way to react to something they can‚Äôt see. 
---
Also, in fighting games, you have more than 2 hits to win. A single bad guess is not critical. 
---
Think about if fighting games only allowed one person to attack at a time (alternating rounds) and the other could only block high, low, dodge right, dodge left, or jump, but they could not see when the other person moves. Alternatively, the attacker could only see the shadow. That is what playing against spirit would be like in a fighting game. The attacker has full control and is not punished for missing other than a bit of lost seconds on the clock. The defender only knows the person is going to attack, but not from where. 
---
No collision will at least give them a chance to change direction if they hear something, but it will still be a guess.
---
Hanoi incoming.
---
Nah your allowed
---
Source: am ace main
---
Imagine
---
I mean every single game usually has a "dev skin". Why would they give us a dev skin? Also the hype nea shirt is still exclusive too. I understand fog whisperers getting something though. For the other skins it makes sense, they were all free codes given away at events.
---
I can't even see aura on most maps, but I still run BBQ for those sweet bonus BPs. Feels terrible to not get them after a match now, if I don't have it equipped.
---
If you get triggered by someone teabagging in a game you should probably stop playing.
---
S P O O K Y
---
I wasnt the killer, the killer is human, and i really cant help how he played. 
---
A lotta people in this sub act like im being extra toxic with a flashlight and teabaggin every pallet or something. Literally had a pixel left in endgame collapse and wanted to share that
---
Instead everyone focuses on how the killer played and call me obnoxious for playing in a risky way. Arent the people who teabag right before leaving more obnoxious? Or am i because i had the balls to go out and try to redeem myself for not juking well earlier? 
---
Man you guys just bring so much negativity to my posts when all i want is to share a fun experience i had.
---
Console does too dude
---
Mostly get these comments before i say anything...
---
&gt;Only mediocre Spirit players relied on the collision mechanics to find people in phase walk. 
---
this is absolutley true but it will still come into affect vs good spirits too. Previously if you started walking as survivor, you had to compensate for the fact that you could bump into her, so you would make a big U-turn or walk a loop very wide to avoid it. This would obviously make you lose a huge amount of distance. Now that's not a factor, so survivors can make more distance in certain scenarios, even vs good spirits.
---
Yea Ik and I understand their motives
---
~~cornstalks~~ **no stalks**
---
And I'm perfectly okay with that. Sometimes I just like to come out swinging anyways
---
I'd ditch lightweight with either borrowed time or adrenaline.
---
they're only inviting good players, thats why
---
I know my comment was a joke.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with left behind? Works great with object of obsession and sole survivor
---
Right. I have a feeling future changes will still happen for the spirit. Good players will just use shorter phase walks in a chase to compensate for overshooting. I have a feeling when that happens, they will make the phase fully reset after any time of use.
---
Don't forget the flashlight pallet stun change
---
If you're on PC, possibly the dedicated server delay?
---
It would be very rare that all would have it active at the same time what even -.-
---
Okay, but what about the bug that disconnects me from every single game I try to play, causing me to derank, miss out on the blood hunt, archives, hallowed blight, and all the fun things everyone is getting to experience?
---
I‚Äôve submitted too many bug reports by now. 
---
Yeah yeah do, I recognise your username at this point. I've seen the silent hill on about 5 times. Before that it was the terminator. Just curious why?
---
Wraith confirmed to be in DBD
---
Said no real gamer ever.
---
yeah these were pretty small. I'm totally fine with it and seeing how she stands afterwards before doing anything more or less to her though.
---
They didn't tackle the big problem of having zero indication if she's phasing or not which is where a lot of the frustration comes from: the "coin flip"
---
I always dc against prayer beads spirit, it's my rule. Other than that, I don't dc no matter the reason
---
I finally just completely turned my messages off. It's been a lot more fun for me personally.
---
Interesting. If you have it recorded it'd be worth taking a look at. If you happen to have info from the game such as perks the killer used, perks you were using, and offerings that affect luck, I'd be interested to know. I'm always curious to see if there is a bug in the mechanics somewhere. I suspect it was probably just a de-synchronization between you and the server. Maybe it showed you struggle on your end, but the information was momentarily interrupted somehow. Regardless, you should send a report to BHVR through their forums if you have something like this happen. They catalogue this stuff to fix during the bug patches. There has to be enough information for them to either reproduce the bug, or figure out what caused it though. You can report bugs [over here.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/bug-report-pc)

If I want to stalk and get the exposed downs - enduring, brutal strength, ruin &amp; corrupt intervention
---
If I want to sneak around and smack people without stalking them - thanatophobia, bbq, ruin &amp; nurse's
---
They should implement mini games into the lobbies while you wait, add chess or sudoku. I should be able to checkmate someone before I find a real match.
---
WE NEED SHIRTLESS MYERS
---
I think as long as you don't hit them down as soon as they're off the hook and you go after the other person instead and hook them it should deactivate as for the timer it's perfectly fine because it stops people just standing there and waiting out the timer and practically still tunneling. Only hooking someone else should disable it.
---
Yeah. Exactly, challenges are worded poorly and some of them will be extremely difficult anyway as they're making it so you need to get 4 kills in the endgame, which often there arent all 4 survivors left at that time. And even if there are ita going to be very difficult to get all 4 of them. I feel like they need to make it doable over multiple matches
---
Give me Carrie, I want that psychic girl to yeet me through a fucking wall.
---
Maybe we could have the classic "invisible spirit that shuts doors sometimes and YEETS people across the floor"
---
We could have stupid loud ass jumpscares as a killer
---
Maybe splitting up and looking for clues could be a survivor.
---
Just chill out, if people are tbagging you and you are making a reddit post about it, that is literally exactly what they want. You are making yourself look like a clown.
---
Toxic SWFS are cunts, but you can work around it. if you are not new you should prob get around a 2k each game.
---
I would get rid of spine chill, lightweight and sprint burst.
---
Balanced landing is a better all around perk then sprint burst. Lightweight is honestly not great and spine chill is alright but idk theres just better perks. 
---
Reason I left quick and quiet is because I run it with head on which is fun to play with.

I never posted this before. You can get uppity all you want. Things usually get reposted in order to garner more attention, increasing the likelihood of devs considering them.
---
Perhaps you should take a break from Reddit.
---
What the fuck is this?
---
It‚Äôs not that, I think survivors have always been toxic some more than others. Like I had one time in 2017 when lots of survivors reported me (on Xbox BTW) and so had a negative rap, don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like on Pc or PS4 but I assume much don‚Äôt change with the players

But can you really blame people for using meta perks?

I Mean they are meta for a reason.

This is really cute
---
Nurse is still the best killer by a good bit. Ask any good nurse main and they'll tell you that she is only slightly less viable. Spirit is definitely 2nd best though.
---
You don't have to rely on something for it to benefit you. If you use bbq+c for BP's you don't rely to tell me where the survivors are, but it will.
---
I don't rely on bumping into survivors when mind gaming, but I do, and when I do its pretty much just a free hit. This was like the only thing that needed to change about the spirit
---
Matchmaking at its finest
---
Exclusives should literally never be a thing. It's unfair that players who are new to the game cannot obtain them. I'm find with making them being only obtainable by being earned, but they should never be timed exclusively.
---
To be honest, I‚Äôd rather smaller tweaks over time than giant swings of nerf/buffs that end up ruining things for weeks on end.
---
Peanits just posted on the dev update that you are correct. That's kinda a big bummer tbh.
---
I never posted this image, or this exact concept. Who the fuck do you think you are anyway? The internet police?? Get a life, and stop harassing people. Imagine being so pathetic, you dig through someone's history, just to satiate an innate desire for confrontation.
---
That Trapper challenge, to catch 4 people in traps in a single trial.. I higher I climb, it's easier for people to either anticipate or straight up tail me and sabotage my stuff. Last season, I played Trapper a few times and not a single soul got trapped in a couple of games.
---
It's literally just a zoning tool. Chase a guy, he drops a pallet you plant or pretend to plant a trap to cut him off and continue chasing.
---
It's gonna be fun, this challenge alone will require at least a day for me to complete.

No.  The devs are too cowardly to actually implement.

Yeah the game takes a while to find out your matchmaking rank. So the more you play the faster you'll get matches
---
Not sure about that. I know many times updates on Nintendo consoles were delayed due to Nintendo vetting the content, either for subject matter or bugs.

Possibly True in this case, but we have not heard anything other than ‚Äúwe are waiting for approval‚Äù from the devs.

---
what is really frustrating about spirit and they are not changing is the feel of playing a 300ms match because the way spirit moves.
---
also there is still no indicator (yeah, ik, the glowing glass, but no) of her entering in phase walk, so the meme of the spirit just standing still in a loop without a way for the survivor to counterplay without depending on chance, which is probably the #1 reason of why people are hating on spirit rn 
---
it's nice to see bhvr reacting to this but imo they could do a little bit better
---
"2 gens got done and I did 2, ruin is so op... " he's just flaming his mates
---
Her nerfs were actually nessicary tho, and barley affect her effectiveness. She's still in the top 3 if not the best killer in the game.
---
I can guarantee you Google translate will atleast give you a decent answer for this
---
People love to waste pallets, and self care. They‚Äôre called shitty players

Fair. It‚Äôs still a valid point but it wouldn‚Äôt be as bad if they decided to bring those back. I only want the leather hoodie(maybe since i need to see it in game with my normal outfit to decide).

You may need to use a map offering like the game or Leary‚Äôs that has many corners and windows. You then can herd people into areas.

4 traps is feasible in one game.

I get a message from a player whinging every time they get sacrificed, rather annoying.

I understand getting annoyed at games sometimes but to get so mad about something so simple is a bit much. And whats constitutes a real gamer? üòÇ

Yea, I suppose you're right about that lol

Is that the mobile version?

Yeah, but once he got me while I Was approching the opened e it gates and all rank 17 survivors left me and left, luckly I Was bringing thoose 2 perks

Same for me, they really think they should escape every time

I actually would love also having Mary/Maria as survivor.

Korede shimaida!
---
aww those pigs are the best &lt;3

wait what where‚Äôd you here that? If true that‚Äôs good news
---
Just don't take every single game you play serious? I hop into games sometimes knowing I'm gonna die, might as well bring a toolbox and sabo every hook I see, once I get hooked just try the 4% and move on to the next game. There are some really fun perk combos if you just wanna fuck around and have fun. Granted if your playing solo your teammates won't appreciate them but it's every man for themselves sometimes
---
They're doing it so people can scam others out of their money with the promise of currently unobtainable skins.
---
All of us Claudette mains are the like that, promise! 
---
Well I'm not at least lol
---
By that logic, if I were to have an old friend who loved Bohemian Rhapsody, and I constantly had that song stuck in my head for 20 years, I would be able to remember exactly what they looked like. Audible memory is not the same as visual memory. Sure, she would remember that her mother would hum it for her, but Anna absolutely would forget what she looks like after 20-ish years by herself in the forest. She likes to kill adults for sport, and she wouldn‚Äôt recognize her mother, so she absolutely would kill her own mother if she were to see her again.
---
Pig, she decided existing
---
To be honest I don't really blame them. You took the original, removed the logo to fiddled with the contrast a tiny bit
---
DH(Devour Hope), HL(Huntress Lullaby), HG(Haunted Grounds). I abbreviate them because i don‚Äôt like typing them out. I‚Äôve seen HG as Haunted and DH as Devour before though. Lullaby seems widely accepted too.
---
Good point but in all fairness there won't be emblem system where it judges your poor decisions and all. If players are going to camp you, tunnel you or whatever they want to be. Let them do it.  Ranking system existed probably for one thing? Competition? I'm questioning this because I really don't know the answer why was it implemented in the first place. And I suppose endgame timer shouldn't really exist either. Alternatively they could've added beta branches of previous versions of Dead by Daylight so folks could go back and play old versions. But that one obviously will never happen...
---
What I'm saying is, the game is suppose to be fun.  If someone is still going to ruin your experience in both gamemodes then let report system stay.
---
I only follow these subreddit games and love this
---
It's really sad cause I liked using my untamed donkey jacket. At the very least could they put them up on the store for iri shards? At least then players have to grind for them the same way we did. This especially applies to god-tier cosmetics such as dweard, which should honestly be given a whole new tier in the store itself.
---
A killer should never be in a situation where the counter is a perk.  Survivors can‚Äôt see what killer they‚Äôre facing, and if the only real counter to a top-tier killer is a perk, all it means is that survivors always run the same perk, killing variety in the builds you see.
---
I do agree with the general sentiment of some others, though: they nerfed spirit without necessarily fixing the actual problem.  Spirit‚Äôs issue isn‚Äôt necessarily how strong she is (though her strength definitely contributed to the *amount* of complaints), but the fact that playing against her was less about skill/map awareness/teamwork and more about dumb luck from the survivors‚Äô side due to the lack of audio/animation clues about what she was doing.  A terrible spirit could still catch a much better player out simply because there wasn‚Äôt enough information for the survivors to make better decisions.
---
The rework does help a bit, but the lack of information on the survivor‚Äôs side is still present.
---
They actually sent me an email this morning saying they are no longer adding in earned items manually. Guess this bug happened to a lot of people (including me).
---
He's saying ruin is OP from what I can see

Why is there no Bubba and Pig buffs?
---
Couldn't agree more. Logging in to do dailies is depressing, like a chore feeding the sunk cost fallacy. 
---
DBD is implementing this as a way to mitigate the bb grind and bring some spice to gameplay that people have figured out in year 2. (at least from my perspective) I guarantee you that this will fall to ashes as soon as another game comes along in the same genre that is better at holding players attentions.
---
Same here, but then it usually seems to reward me with Lery's afterwards.
---
No, it‚Äôs the version for the GameBoy Advance.
---
That would make sense if Dead by Daylight is their fun game. But if Dead by Daylight is the game they play the most it wouldn't be a 50 50 split. Competitive players play the comp game mode far more than they play a more casual game mode
---
Pretty sure it's only 1 pip now.
---
Nothing to fix ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To be fair, I haven't seen my biological mother in over two decades and wouldn't recognize her if she hit me. Anna was just a kid when she died, so I'm sure she has this fantasy version of her that's nothing like her

Always reminds me of one of my first games with a friend we got to start playing with us, we were a 4 player SWF and three of us started together, with the new guy across the map from us

Why is it that almost all for honor players are dead by daylight players? What is it about those 2 games and why are they connected?

Now it‚Äôs going to be billy.

Bubba for his perks, bbq is the best perk for farming bp and will help you advance other characters
---
Spirit was extremely rare for me
---
I don‚Äòt really understand, do you have to begin and finish it or how does this work?
---
I don't think it even works on dying state in general.
---
Well what's your play style?
---
bullying any player isn't fun or okay. you're playing against another human not a bot.
---
That makes total sense! Would love to see that or other implementations similar to this concept.
---
Well I have bbq from the shrine
---
Not completely useless. If you plan on prestiging the trapper, use all your bloodpoints leveling him up then use bbq with the trapper to farm those bloodpoints back
---
Fun fact: a cancelled sequel called all American massacre was made but never released starring chop top
---
I pressed f. You are a hero, man!
---
It could be ok but his neck makes it look weird
---
Oh in that case the spirit meta is strong right now
---
I might as well be a bot with how bad i am at anything but skillchecks so it‚Äôs a fair matchup to me. Bullying is probably not the best wording but it was the only one i could and still can think of off the top of my head.
---
I would understand having the mental image of someone‚Äôs face forcefully burned into my head like that, but for at least 20 years? That‚Äôs not how memory works. Also, this implies that she gets a good look at her mother‚Äôs face before butchering her. She would just see someone in her forest, and instinctively chuck a hatchet. Then she‚Äôd go up to her to finish the job. Only then would she *probably* recognize her as her mother.
---
What's the problem? Camping is boring as hell, yea, but easy as hell to counter.

---
For a failry simple starting killer with solid perks, Michael is a good choice. Leatherface is a little cheaper and gets you BBQ And Chili, which is a great perk for getting bloodpoints, but isn‚Äôt all that good himself. He is still an option you may want to consider though.
---
Both can stomach horribly unbalanced and punishing game mechanics? Lol
---
I have no idea I play on console. I think there is a way to turn off in game chat and stuff though.
---
I mean, they summer ones weren‚Äôt really that much of an effort. Hell, you could die two seconds into the match and still earn the count toward your Kate shirt. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd call that working your ass off.
---
The ownership rights of Jason Voorhees.
---
They didn‚Äôt solve the main problem with spirit though. The problem wasn‚Äôt with her being strong. It‚Äôs the fact the gameplay surrounding her is taking guesses and not having good counter-play. Her anal beads being a universal sound is good at least.
---
I can't say I know what that means lol
---
Lol I got it about level 80 or something (30 times the level 50 bloodweb)
---
Yeah the flashlight thing will be like a one and done thing.  Usually you'll just deal with it after breaking a pallet or whatever.
---
You have to have hands on when it finishes. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much progress you made before that.
---
But she recently got nerfed so I didnt know if it was as bad as the pig
---
I hate cold wind as Myers
---
I love playing against jumpscare myers! It's one of the few killers that actually makes me paranoid and as I mentioned in another comment: a nice change of pace :)
---
Don‚Äôt forget poor Billy; his parents were absolute garbage.
---
or people need to start ignoing ranks and play how they want. If your build is weak because you have more fun with it, then you get to play with others who are either not as good or using fun builds themselves.
---
The ranking system is there to give everyone a fair challenge, and everyone is making the mistake of caring more about the rank than the point of it. If you are using a weaker build you are less of a challenge so you are put against others who aren't as much of a challenge as you with a meta build but as you with your fun build
---
For survivor, there are perks like stakeout and diversion which start their timers when in the killers terror radius. You could also use basic detection perks (ie alert, object, dark sense, etc). 
---
As for which killer to play so you don‚Äôt irritate people, refrain from clown, hag, plague, spirit, and bubba. Imo those are probably the most frustrating and least fun to play against.
---
Seems like most of us Spirit advocates are happy with the changes. The window change seems a hit harsh but since all they adjusted otherwise was her collision I don't think it will be too hard of a nerf.
---
Hopefully now we can focus on buffing the multiple low tier killers like they did freddy and buffing some of the shit survivor perks.
---
Yah I saw someone talk about all Their was a trailer and that was it l it was about how choptop when went to Vietnam it sounded pretty interesting also fun fact I met the met actor of choptop Bill Mosley
---
I agree it's great for pallets, but to me Billy's map presence is a big part of his power. Having that restricted severely hurts him.
---
Underrated comment lol
---
I do, most of the time. This encounter was just hilariously entertaining
---
Legioooooon
---
The Entity is a bitch, no killers to take right now? Fuck it let‚Äôs posses this samurai to kill his family, only to take his daughter‚Äôs spirit for its own gain, lol
---
I just imagined highlander as a survivor, giving the killer the ol‚Äô famorian kick cancel into caber toss into agressive stance unblockables all day, even if you strip him of his sword, the first part requires no weapon, can just see the highlander now, tossing killers through windows ahahaha
---
This
---
They be like 
---
&gt;Kill 5 Survivors as the Trapper using Tombstone without any perks or add-ons (Must be done in one game)
---
lol
---
Sounds like a person who was pissed off at life so they took it out on you. That's all. Nothing to do about it but report them for unsportsmanlike behavior and move on.
---
Actually they nerfed that
---
Well that's a whole different rant on it's own. (Tho' technically all we do is kill/get killed for points normally too)
---
Well that's a good point but there are some other killers with great mobility. Also what about frenzy?
---
I view it like this. 1 kill I lost. 2 kills I tied. 3 kills I won. 4 kills I dominated. Of course as long as long as I got my 4 stacks of bbq and had some fun chases then I really don't even care how many escaped.
---
I'm not complaining, tho I might be biased coz I don't care about exclusivity in any game. 
---
To me the looks are the most important.
---
I've have him but I'm just not that good with him
---
Also look up Otz, as he‚Äôs a good teacher as well.
---
I'm pretty sure it is
---
I for one am glad I don't have to scour the Internet looking at shady sites just to maybe get a Dweard.  
---
Like for awhile it wasn't that bad because Dwearder was basically Dweard but with different colored glasses, but then they just made it look horrible in comparison.
---
to see more color I guess
---
ranged 3-man knockdowns?
---
Exactly. Which says a lot about the game when so many people run them
---
Who don't you have
---
Ah, so you will still bitch about a nerfed killer.
---
People like you are great for the community
---
Still the no collisions is big
---
With what
---
Spirit mains
---
What rules are you talking about? The main objective for survivors is escape by doing gens,  while for killer its simple. (Kill them all) There are no rules lol
---
I can't wait to be phasing and end my phase inside the body of another survivor and just break everything.
---
damn you're super angry because i was confused on something so small lol. still doesn't matter, they're fixing bugs, and have been doing a good job, they also have to get more money so they can pay their programmers to fix bugs that you're so angry about.
---
Same
---
He's no traitor is he?
---
I just find it hilarious that I got downvoted for mentioning a real, factual, viable counter to the "pallet-scenario" lol
---
People just wanna complain I guess
---
I wish there was at least some extra bonus for people who earned the event skins.
---
Sometimes this happend when a new Ritual comes in, but, I dunno
---
Gen rush. Don't be that guy crouching behind a tree wasting 2 minutes for a save that won't happen.
---
How do you channel her power and cause all injured survivors to drop to the dying state again?
---
idk man maybe it‚Äôs just me but rank 1~3 is consistently DH, BT, DS, and adrenaline. The exhaustion perk changes sometimes. DS is just super useful for punishing the killer for making the best possible play, which is sometimes tunneling someone 30 seconds after unhooking.
---
 /smallestviolin
---
I went in with Dark Sense, Prove Thyself, Bond, and Better Together. Helps you find others already on gens and them to find you with super speedy repairs. Main thing to keep in mind is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how much progress you help with. As long as you have hands on the gen when it finishes you get credit. Good luck!
---
Freddy or Ghostface. But I've seen some complaints about billy starting now.
---
&gt;Im fine with them giving away the other skins, but man, we actually grinded our asses off for the event skins. Why are they giving them to everyone? Thats like giving everyone Legacy and normal prestige by default. They also did not include all the paid exclusives which is super weird.
---
Event skins were *no-where near* as difficult to get as legacy.  Hell, even prestiging is harder than most event cosmetic grinds.
---
Me too. The odd occasions where I play survivor I love going up against Ghost face. I'm a little too familiar with Myers, but ghostyboi does the same job and scares the shit out of me.
---
Unless you jumped to level 42 in the time it took you to post this.
---
You've got 18 levels to go
---
Ah yes
---
i dont get how it runs so fast and doesnt cause earthshattering hippo footsteps that give away its location. u just know it be trying to eat the picture of the cake in the escape cake offering
---
I'd rather you didn't fuck over everyone else by going for the 4% and then givig up, you might as well just dc at that point.
---
There's not taking the game all that seriously and then there's being unsportsmanlike , survivors get fucjed over hard by that mindset because the game is so killer-sided when someone just gives up immediately
---
Freddy,bubba,Myers,spirit,plague,and clown
---
No no, you want the game to go *faster* to give them less time to complete the challenge
---
sounds like it was for the best
---
Same tbh.
---
You said 5 hours in your other post. Reported to the cyber police, you done goofed, kid.
---
Looks great though!
---
Because some folks are willing to pay exorbitant amounts for cosmetics that are deemed super rare.
---
he's so scared without them though :(
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about some of the black ops zombies characters but that would be 4 survivors and no killer (unless they made zombies?)
---
Really holy sh**t yah his name was Gunner Hanson and I think he came from Norway I heard that too so now you know leatherface is A Norwiegn even know he from Texas
---
You do know teachables are at 30 35 and 40?
---
That feeling when you eat raw cookie dough, thinking that it was the edible kind.
---
yeah but it at least progresses the gamestate
---
It hasn‚Äôt good meme take my upvote
---
You're completely wrong then. They did that too her at launch and she was useless
---
Angela from Sleepaway camp
---
A nerf to the spirit's add-ons is a nerf to the spirit.
---
and yet everyone bitches about her being nerfed. her addons were carrying people so bad
---
does Mr.X from resident evil 2 count? idk how he‚Äôd work but itd be dope to see him, along with leon kennedy or claire redfield as the survivor that comes with him (rpd station or raccoon city could be the map) ! 
---
i also really love how people have been saying silent hill 2 should be added to the game also (seeing james as survivor and pyramid head as killer would be awesome!!!)
---
Freddy, Myers, and clown. In that order are my recommendations. Freddy more fast paced with teleportation and snares/pallets so he's more of an all put attack kinda killer.
---
? Excuse me? She is still invisible during the phase and you still don't know whether she phases or not.
---
Because players were hitting you consistently from collision, not from being stationary.
---
Expect to see a lot of bad spirit players get outplayed
---
And then the Dedicated Servers decide that you did activate Dead Hard _but_ the Killer still downs you anyway.
---
dude we can see your username in the comments of that post with the exact concept
---
BHVR doesn't care about switch man, as much fun as I'm having with the game, are we really gonna keep getting shafted on these updates?
---
That was the ultimate tag team smackdown.
---
No you were not confused. You tried to lament me under some umbrella of bigotry to score feel good points.
---
They have enough money, these are problems that should have and could have been dealt with for awhile. What have there programmers been doing for the last 2 years? Huh, can you answer that for me. Fixing some code so hooks get placed at a more equal distance from each other? Dedicating months to roll out dedicated servers that just showcase all the shortcuts they've taken in years past (hitboxes)
---
Damn right im angry at you. If you don't understand why then you should leave the basement and talk to actual people for once.
---
You do know you unlock teachable perks on **that character** 
---
This is hot the teachable version
---
This is clearly the Trappers blood web, if you had unlocked the teachable it's a random chance to find it on all killers regardless of vel
---
Otherwise if your hunting for the teachable perks they are GUARANTEED on **that character** at level 30 35 and 40.
---
"no offense, but anyone who was fucked over by this ridiculous exclusivity system is an idiot". 
---
There should have never been codes to be sold, what is this, 2002? BHVR had a decade of evidence as to why this system does nothing but help scalpers and screw over your most loyal fans.
---
Read again.
---
Actually that‚Äôs not true. People that have ds and borrowed effect usually do the dumbest shit in front of my face and get away with it due to those perks. It‚Äôs really irritating
---
Imagine a 4 on 1 fighting game and the people on the 4 side want to 1v1 the person all the time lol
---
No, that's a game ban, not a VAC ban. Game bans have to be triggered manually by the devs (or automatically by a system they handle themselves), do not affect other games, and are listed on your profile differently than VAC bans. 
---
VAC bans are automatic (through Valve's Valve Anti-Cheat), affect all games using the same engine, and are (obviously) listed as a VAC ban on your Steam profile.
---
maybe stop downvoting because you got called out lmao
---
I played a 3 man swf where someone wanted to do the mission, he dis a gen alone, me and a friend 99% two gens and let him finish them, but it didn‚Äòt work
---
So.. what did they tell you?  
---
\*\*Looks at some dead Samurai soldiers\*\*  
---
I don't speak Japanese.
---
I don‚Äôt get it ?
---
No you won. They just wanted to rub even the smallest thing in your face to feel like they did something. As long as you got two kills it's a win/tie imo
---
I think it's either the first Yaomoka or a spirit/demon he made a deal with but broke it. Like, maybe he made a deal with a spirit/demon to make him rich but he had to keep his family name pure and when rins father killed his wife and her it tarnished the name and now the demon is mad.
---
Told you I didn‚Äôt have to :)
---
because *this* isn‚Äôt a problem
---
No it‚Äòs still like that
---
The game be like YOU WANNA PRETEND I DONT EXIST 
---
Community:no 
---
Hawkings lab:oh hey guys I‚Äôm new here what do I d-
---
Community:hahaha fuck you map it‚Äôs safer to not use a condom on a girl in her period than use your pallets 
---
The game: yup I‚Äôll just hide here 
---
I know that was terrible and honestly I might downvote myself if Reddit let‚Äôs me
---
Nurse and spirit were both needed changes, doctor is already confirmed for buffs, and from what we've heard, pig might also be in line for buffs
---
If only end game chat was on xbox
---
Except that the "bullying" happens regardless of what they do. Some people BM in response to the killer doing something they see as toxic sure. But there's a great majority of players who BM just to BM no matter what
---
Same here buddy
---
It won't necessarily make it easier to avoid spirit in moments when the collision would have helped, but it will stop people calling her cheap. Now if you get caught it's for the same reason as with any other killer, they can hear you.
---
Then you kill someone with the tombstone and get "OMG I forgot he could do that!!!!" messages
---
if it was 42069 or something maybe
---
Can‚Äôt gen rush when it‚Äôs rank reset and you‚Äôre the one on the hook
---
They made a promise to not give out legacy to everyone, I wouldn't like a company who doubles back on a promise tbh. It sucks to lose legacy over a bug but they shouldn't break a promise.
---
Personally, I really enjoy Clown, Freddy, and Ghost Face. None of them are meta, but they're really good and fun to play.
---
The spirit changes are fair and balanced. Now I hope the meme stops so I can do my spirit rituals and not have people wish death on my bloodline. Honestly BVHR. Good job.
---
Hmm I wonder if he wanted you because of that flashlight ü§î
---
Are you saying that letting players camp/tunnel would some *decrease* the amount if disconnects? Am I reading that right?
---
Mate it can't be healthy to have that much salt in your system.
---
Prayer beads + SWF.
---
"Spirit is phasing"
---
Mind-game gone, which is one of the biggest issues with her. Nice for BHVR to put in toggle spirit nerf.
---
‚ÄúBack in my day!‚Äù
---
Yeah fuck then man, I‚Äôm just about done with their negligence, and that‚Äôs fine. They are pretty god damn awful at communication, and I don‚Äôt know how you can have that be your job and not want to calm people‚Äôs worries.
---
She hasn't been nerfed yet, not until the 3.4 update.
---
Then rank up. Like everyone else.
---
It's not OP just because low skill players don't know how to counter it.
---
The survivor can just stand under the pallet and wait from which side you come, bamm, pallet in your face
---
Found flashlight in a box that game. Was under impression he was farming as he kept downing one guy and letting us heal. This was after I‚Äôd blinded him purely for points. Soon as he downed me he hooked me then proceeded to do this for the next two minutes
---
Jealousy‚Äôs a disease bitch, XOXO Get well soon&lt;3
---
You get one attempt to hit the skill check in a match, but if you don't attempt to hit the skill check and let it go through, it's still good for your next unhook.
---
If you hit or miss the skill check, DS is then disabled for the rest of match.
---
Side note: you probably want to use DS whenever you can. There's a good chance you don't get tunneled again or don't get unhooked, or match wise using it earlier was a more advantageous situation.
---
Sidney only has 1 up on Laurie though with 4 occurrences. Granted hers were 7 killers overall so more experience to Laurie having 1
---
More free cosmetics is objectively a good thing.
---
"Hook a total of 8 killers while playing as Nea"
---
Yeah because I‚Äôm really gonna pip against people like this the day after rank reset
---
pretty much sums it up.
---
Lol 4v1 is being killer sided? I've had all three of my teammates DC but after smart plays I still managed to get out. Our own individual skill decides whether or not we survive/get more bp than the killer(win). Me having a lone wolf mentality when going into a game shouldn't affect you if I'm still completing gens and running the killer around.
---
i like that map
---
This really amused me. She just flops over like "fuck it I need a nap" and bill looks back as if to say "Umm WTF ok bye".
---
I'm assuming the auric cells
---
Sandbagging is deliberately dragging your teammates down. It's most frequently seen in the form of running the killer to other survivors, body blocking other survivors, farming survivors off hook, deliberately failing skill checks, etc.
---
That's a very unfortunate word that you forgot lol
---
Shit? Do you even *play* Hag?
---
I can hardly read it
---
...just ignore ranking. Boom there‚Äôs your casual mode where you can fuck around
---
did anyone else pronounce ‚Äúwallet‚Äù like ‚Äúmallet‚Äù in their heads?
---
You'll lose one pip. Big deal.
---
Run billy run.
---
That's just... Awful. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah i had to scrunch the screenshots to fit them. 
---
Hindsight i shouldve typed it all
---
I am
---
i dont get it...
---
They weren't trying to Nerf her to the point where she's not good, the were balancing her in parts where she had an unfair advantage.
---
You are a great person
---
Anubis help us if they ever add a second objective to this game. People are gonna lose their shit ha ha
---
I thought the challenges would be way harder.
---
Ha I like this
---
god i can‚Äôt wait to parry his top heavy unblockable with a pallet
---
Legit guy got farmed all game and on his last life he said I should‚Äôve let him go even though he stuck around healing right next to the basement. I was on the other side of the map when he was unhooked, I came all the way back to the gas station/ basement playing as trapper so I‚Äôm moving at a brisk jogging pace and he‚Äôs just healing in the gas station next to the basement.
---
OH FUCK THE NEW KILLER HAS DODGE ATTACKS AND HYPER ARMOR
---
pls nerf
---
Both why why and how they got hit by that?
---
12 years later an he enjoys getting facecamped?
---
This isn‚Äôt just one game though, I see a fuck ton of Bubba‚Äôs do this. Only positive about this one is it wasn‚Äôt in basement with insidious
---
I doubt they would have cared to fix that.
---
[Uhhhh....](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/103996/developer-update-november-2019#latest)
---
Yeah, but the occurrences of Michael trying to kill Laurie are much more spaced out throughout her life. In the final one, she just lies in bed most of the time.
---
INCREDIBILIS
---
Here's an idea: just play how you want to play. Ranks only matter if you let them matter. You don't need BHVR to add a new game mode for you to play new builds; you can just do it. Nobody is going to stop you.
---
Giving hatch isn't the only nice thing you can do as killer tho! Just playing fair means a lot more!  
---
~~Just don't be that facecamping huntress I just went against, or the tunneling spirit with a mori before that lol~~
---
Am I joke to you I posted this yesterday:(
---
.. Nancy didn't get a booty üò™
---
aww, impressive what one gg can do! :')
---
some of the streamer cosmetics are still exclusive, and the H20 mask is still one of a kind.
---
As opposed to you being rewarded for face camping and tunneling? It's not fun to get tunneled, nor is it fun to get faced camped. Instead of nerfing blood point gain from doing either of those, they make perks that try to deal with it, and then let killers juggle survivors to counter act one of them.
---
If you're getting caught before you can pip THAT often, maybe you're at the rank you belong.
---
What? Playing a game *for fun*? What madness is this?
---
Just appears behind you and you have no chance
---
You sure? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen anyone sporting that jacket. I figure there would still be a few people running around that have cosmetics I couldn‚Äôt find in the store. It‚Äôs the same jacket Tyde Tyme likes to use on David, right?
---
No James spoiler is the killer he use pillow attack I‚Äôm sorry for the terrible joke I let my self out good concept by the way though
---
He's showing off how many cells he has
---
Lol yea that‚Äôs the stuff I avoid as much as possible. I get nervous people will think I‚Äôm campin when their friend saves them before I‚Äôve even had the chance to leave the area so then I just pretend they didn‚Äôt and go after someone else. It doesn‚Äôt help that I play spirit so I try to appear as fair and fun as possible
---
People who care about gaming cosmetics this much are a joke. It's a game. Go outside and care about something that matters.
---
The left one will be more rare.
---
Glowing yellow eyes are the ratest non-legacy skin now.
---
Of course I have ideas, but they‚Äôd have to be tested.  They‚Äôre only suggestions, I‚Äôm not part of a 200 person dev team, I‚Äôm a player who subjectively views the gameplay in a certain way.   Gold express is a game that is extremely similar to Dbd but has more objectives.  And Friday.  There‚Äôs also Secret Neighbor, Last Year the nightmare and so on.  They could easily take inspiration from those games and implement new gameplay features that still keep the game feeling like current Dbd but less reliant on slowing the game down.  In January of this year every match I played was 10-20 mins max.  Now every single match with those perks lasts 30-40 mins.  This isn‚Äôt Civilization VI, that‚Äôs insanely long. Zzzzzzz
---
After the Rank Reset last night I was getting like 2 minute wait times. I was so happy I could cry.
---
No I think it‚Äôs always been like that, if you have your hands in a box, it lets you finish it before it goes off. Obviously if it‚Äôs the right one your safe if not you die
---
I feel like the sarcasm was obvious from the CapItAL LetTErS üòÇ
---
So you can read it
---
Oh, shit. They‚Äôre actually gonna do it. I had no idea.
---
\*stares on confusion\*
---
So you're saying that she's going to be nerfed got you
---
New Survivor: Lieutenant "Lefty" Enright.
---
New Map: Texas Battle Land
---
New Cosmetic: Dinnertime Attire, The Cannibal.
---
Awesome keep up the good work :)
---
Debatable for bbq. People usually use it for the bp. But the aura ability is solid especially on some killers
---
Well, shit is a pretty good way of describing tome two...
---
Exactly. If people weren't asshole and scamming people for outrageous  amounts of money, BHVR wouldn't be handing them out for free. 
---
People need to put themselves in the shoes of those who were scammed. Imagine thinking you're getting an exclusive cosmetic but instead you just got scammed out of hundreds if not thousands of dollars?
---
i'd give this a yeah
---
"Haha why's the halloween theme playing?"
---
OH SHIT my bad I think I accidentally replied to your comment. I saw one that said ‚Äútoo bad I can‚Äôt read‚Äù or some shit sorry about that man
---
If you don't make a t-shirt until tomorrow with that boop I'm going to  make one myself.
---
Preach
---
Damn! That must've been intense!
---
Fire.
---
I thought it docks you a couple pips? Is that not true?
---
Okay good sir I understand that you're upset but when it comes down to it. Every killer is doing this just go work on generators because against the Bubba camping you're not going to win that confrontation. If your teammates were smart then they would have done generators and not bother ring trying to save when it's not going to happen
---
It‚Äôs frustrating when they act entitled though I didn‚Äôt really want to hook him because he legitimately got farmed all game, but when he was on his last life he started complaining that I should let him go even though he stuck around healing right next to the basement. I was on the other side of the map when he was unhooked, I came all the way back to the gas station/ basement playing as trapper so I‚Äôm moving at a brisk jogging pace and he‚Äôs still just healing in the gas station next to the basement. I told him not my problem take it up with your potato teammates because I got tired of being nice and getting my kindness taken advantage of.
---
all I've heard is good responses about the Spirit changes, especially from Spirit players.
---
Plague have good perks
---
how awesome would that be though? Myers cosmetic for Billy
---
Tru3 is a moron when it comes to game balance.
---
By moving at 175% movement speed while knowing their exact location, while the survivor can‚Äôt see you lol
---
I want Sam from Trick R Treat. I think they could definitely work something cool into either his power or his add ons around the Rules of Halloween. Plus it would be fun to chase after and stab Survivors with his lollipop. And for his Mori he can take off his mask and really get down to the business of killing.
---
Yah I love unmask ghost face he look like the person who would sell you drug in the back of gas station and work at a McDonald‚Äôs in the morning love you work man keep it up
---
Hmm. I don‚Äôt know, then. My match I participated in 3 gens where one of them I helped 100% of the progress, one of them about 50%, and one of them I only helped the last 10%. Had hands on as they completed and I got my challenge. Maybe 1% isn‚Äôt enough to count. Or it‚Äôs a random bug. Better luck to your friend next time.
---
Happened to me last night. I'm getting ready to loop him, is he going left or right or ... just staring at me ... shit.
---
does distressing stack with bbq?
---
That sound awesome did you post it here just asking
---
Wouldn't that basically make him a clone of Freddy?
---
How much did you waste though?
---
I really like those Spirit changes. I thought they'd mess up and put her into low tier, but the changes seem to be almost perfect. She will still be a good killer, but more fun for both sides and more fair. Also happy that they're doing the DC changes soon, no more disconnecting to steal my BBQ stack.
---
Well I‚Äôm glad that vibe came across well :,D thanks so much for the kind words
---
Did you just say Spirit was heavily nerfed?
---
Aaaah. I forgot that I can always see all injured survivors and also have my power up 100%of the time.
---
No I wasn‚Äôt the Myers but Myers looking pretty thicc
---
It's almost as if DBD is so vastly different from a fighting game that it's a terrible analogy to use
---
No. It started with dedicated servers. It could‚Äôve still been a somewhat common bug back before then, but now it happens so much that it‚Äôs enough to make someone wanna rip the hair out of their own scalp with their bare hands.
---
let's puke together
---
first off: it's basically 3v1 when someone immediately dcs upon getting downed early, which your mentality would result in every so often
---
Second: killer sided doesn't mean they always win, and getting out as the last survivor isn't much of a feat considering the hatch exists and the endgame collapse after, and if you mean by doing 3-5 gens then I'm sorry to say buddy but that was a killer who didn't know what they were doing, not you being extremely skilled (yeah of course it would require some smart play and skill from your side, but a decent killer would still catch you 99% of the time)
---
And now I'm sad thanks alot.
---
I think Dweard is actually more bald than Dwearder in-game. It‚Äôs hard to see but I know a while back they made Dwearder have a bit more hair than it did. My Dwight main friend dropped Dwight for not being totally bald like before lmao
---
Stop trying to make excuses. The verdict is out. You're a toxic dick and you didnt deserve to escape.
---
All of the people commenting here have obviously never owned one of these exclusive items lmao
---
WOW! Just played a game, and it runs extremely smoothly now, great skill checks are now easy to hit consistently. I haven‚Äôt played the PS4 version 3.2.2 yet, but Switch 3.2.2 runs more smoothly than PS4 3.2.0. 
---
Its well worth the wait, though I wish their communication was a bit better.
---
AND XP EARNED SINCE ARCHIVES RELEASED ON OTHER PLATFORMS IS ALREADY ADDED TO THE SWITCH VERSION SO WE ARENT PLAYING CATCH UP.
---
Yes  I love your work ghostface usually give me a doomer vibe who snapped who are going to do next
---
I had been in the debate for a good amount of time on trying to buy the Dweard skin, as it's closest to my IRL appearance, but I knew it was an unsafe deal. That change is a huge weight off of that debate. Thank you BHVR &lt;3
---
As someone who sometimes plays killer, Jesus Christ.
---
OMG thats me 
---
the saddo catto hello reddit ask me anything
---
What if it‚Äôs both? Or furthermore, what if it‚Äôs all of Rin‚Äôs ancestors, forming a conglomerate of Yamaoka blood and pure fury?
---
"Only killer mains are on this sub"
---
hence why half the posts on this sub are people bitching about NOED and ruin lmao
---
\*laughs on overwatch dps queues\*
---
Yeah i know it's a crazy take
---
i was just saying why does her being japanese have to do anything, not that deep, no need to throw insults at me, and also they literally have been fixing bugs for the last 2 years, obviously more bugs will appear and they're trying their hardest with the dedicated servers and trying to fix them, they literally canceled the summer event because of it, and also with all the stress the community is putting on them insulting them it sucks. no need to write an essay on how "i tried to lament you under some umbrella of bigotry" because i was just asking a simple question. don't respond to this i don't feel like explaining to you how this could've ended in 1 reply again lol.
---
Only if you think essentially removing her strongest addon, nerfing another handful of addons, removing her lack of vault animation, removing collision *takes breath* nerfing her post-phase speed is a nerf....then yeah. I think it's a substantial nerf.
---
Raider the stuff of legends!
---
I explained this in another comment but I shall explain here too, because it seems you‚Äôre not trying to be condescending and I appreciate that
---
The killer gave the impression we were farming. He was letting us heal each other over and over and letting me get blinds with a flashlight I found in a chest. After he downed me, he hooked me and this was my screen for the next two minutes. It didn‚Äôt matter if my teammates were smart or not, because he let everyone go after I died.
---
Yeah, it's like nobody goes against Myers in xbox, but I've gotten into so many games against him I just don't even know
---
this meme makes no sense
---
WHAT DID YOU BRING ON THE CURSED LAND!!!!
---
 I love it that terrifying you getting my upvote
---
I don‚Äôt own any event exclusives and I honestly think this is a really unnecessary change. People worked hard to get those and now everyone just gets them for free. Really isn‚Äôt fair at all.
---
The change allows for interaction between the player and the killer whereas the old version didn't allow any for the survivor.
---
*Much* better.
---
But it still takes a bit more skill to kill things with her other than bumping into a survivor and her most toxic add ons have been fixed.
---
You don‚Äôt need to see them when audio pinpoints your exact location
---
&gt;User
---
Just as thicc as my blood in his knife, if you know what I mean
---
Killers don't like when you escape with the hatch, and survivors don't like that you planned for them to die.
---
I have all the event items on Xbox
---
Otz post two GF build videos this/last week, go check it them
---
YT: NotOtzdarva
---
Mmmmm give me the pipe Myers
---
A lot of killers can counter pallet play. Trapper and Hag can drop traps to break the loop, legion can just vault it, etc. Spirits counterplay is phasing/phase-baiting. It's really not that hard to just watch her husk for the glow effect and react accordingly.
---
hmm I‚Äôve already done spirit and was thinking of doing the huntress next
---
What sub am i (now we need warframe ,dbd  and for honor)
---
Rank 15-20 ?
---
So are killers tunnelling or juggling survivors? It‚Äôs starting to sound like there‚Äôs just no pleasing you.
---
That be pretty sick thanks for the hard work
---
We lost the battle, but won the war.
---
Killer was rank 13
---
According to today‚Äôs dev update, they‚Äôre working on developing a punishment system for constant DC‚Äôs. Honestly it can‚Äôt come soo enough. I‚Äôve had four matches canceled today due to disconnects.
---
Thank god they didn‚Äôt touch dried cherry blossom/juniper bonsai, that add on build is my favorite killer build in the game.
---
It‚Äôs random
---
When the survivors turn on each other instead of working together
---
Exactly killers with good mobility are usually the top ones. 
---
Frenzy is his second power.
---
That be pretty sick
---
Dude, opting to waste previous chase time in order to attempt to fake out a survivor is 100% a mindgame, what are you talking about?
---
Whether you like it or not, these changes were needed. She remains top tier, granted you do more than just standing still waiting for a free kill.
---
One, a killer that has had a nerf announced. Two, just bc somthing has been nerfed doesnt mean its balanced, we will wait to see how good she is after.
---
Thanks so much! I appreciate your words so much
---
Yeah... I‚Äôm just gonna keep using my P3 mask instead.
---
Just adding context to the discussion - was too lazy to edit the original from my phone.
---
I feel bad for slugging at times, I hope survivors can understand that I‚Äôm not trying to ruin their fun. Slugging is just sometimes the logical plan.
---
Wait are glowing yellow eyes exclusive?
---
Did plague go somewhere?
---
Both were free on PS Plus could be one reason
---
he just says fuck it and attaches his chainsaw to a rope and throws it at you
---
Spine chill. Not only is it helpful against every single killer, if the spirit is staying still at a pallet and spine chill flashes off for a second then you know that she‚Äôs coming around.
---
If someone is toxic toward you in post-game chat, yell swear words and racial slurs at them in Russian. You‚Äôll scare a few people.
---
Stop being disingenuous and trying to back pedal. 
---
It should have been ended in one reply, because I replied back with proper context. You were the one that kept crying "BUT WHY DID YOU SAY JAPANESE!" as if that had anything to do with my criticisms.
---
I'm kind of disappointed we don't have any variant of those cosmetics for new Survivors/Killers too.  The Halloween cosmetics are the closest.  Wouldn't mind if they opened up extra Prestige levels to obtain similar stuff.
---
If Spirit has Prayer Beads you do the exact same thing you do against Freddy: get off the gen for 3 seconds and if they come for you then keep hiding and if not then keep doing the gen.
---
Yah Mr X , imagine doing a genny and all hear is stomp stomp stomp that be f**cking terrifying
---
This makes me want to stop playing INFINITE mend legion
---
I‚Äôm all for buffing weaker Killers, in fact I welcome it from both sides. I‚Äôm also for buffing certain in game mechanics for favour of helping weaker Killers. 
---
However the Devs don‚Äôt seem to want to buff weak Killers. It falls on deaf ears. 
---
It‚Äôs fine to have complaints about very overpowered Killers as well as having complaints about weak Killers, it‚Äôs up to the Devs to implement changes.
---
I've had games where it felt like I lost 2-3 generators in less than a minute, because I don't have ruin unlocked for any of killers and I was chasing 1 person. Those games are so demoralizing as killer, especially on really large maps.
---
90% sure this is a myth
---
We need that as an ingame emote, like the "come here" or "go there". Would love to say hello to a Michael.
---
Wtf. This community really sleeps on Jeff
---
I‚Äôm a fan of Nurse‚Äôs, Pop, STBFL or PWYF, and Ruin. Discordance is another great perk on GF as well.
---
Mate it‚Äôs the same for survivors against Freddy. You might think I just 360ed you, but I actually have no idea what just happened :D
---
You literally said it doesn't make sense to you, so obviously you didn't understand their motives dude.
---
Sorry, I tried :( But why does it make no sense though?
---
No no they Bhvr should release a ghostface mask that has his tongue sticking with a tux dapper ghostface
---
why is Spirit dead?
---
Don't worry I'm not being condescending but here's the problem.
---
Usually when Killers do that to you they try and hopefully allow others to come and pick you off the hook and basically stop trying to kill you once you're dead hooked. 
---
However did he just so happened to send you a message? If you didn't then it means that peace was never really an option. Also be very careful because the devs actually hated when we Farm.
---
I can‚Äôt see which meg shirt that is, but I‚Äôm 90% sure the Delirious trapper mask isn‚Äôt being given out for free like the others.
---
So change ruin for noed?
---
Oh no I completely agree but now since spirit is fixed now people are gonna try to hate on Billy now.
---
Meh, i prefer his leather suit
---
SPIRIT NERFS, LETS GOOOOOOO
---
I mean if I read the patch correctly it said how she gains speed will be like wraith, which sounds like it could kill her. But I'd wait til the PTB to pronounce anyone as dead.
---
It's like you didn't read it all, it has no effect on making money because the event will be included in the free track and making a small event for a week long duration takes time away to fix glitches and other things and once they actually start fixing things and everything they could start bringing back elaborate events, I know they dropped the ball on game health for a long time but with them live testing dedicated servers and using that info to improve, the game will improve which allows them to focus on better content for their players
---
Why would you dodge Badham? Even before its rework I‚Äôd say it was still a really fun map.
---
He didn‚Äôt message, but he put on BPS and hooked another but let him off almost immediately without tunnelling or anything. I was thinking it was odd he didn‚Äôt message but i play on Xbox and figured he was comm banned. How wrong was I lol
---
I'm very curious to see how she's gonna play now. Also I've been trying to improve my flashlight skills and I guess now I can try the window-blind tech against her. Usually I would just run away since there's no way I knew she was phasing, also the hitbox is kinda weird hahaha but I agree with you man
---
OMG I didn't even realize you made this one too!
---
I would totally read your comics every day/week/etc.
---
That is one of the most satisfying moments in the game. And when it happens you know that killer is salty they just got looped so hard
---
They wouldn't be giving them out for free if people weren't scamming others.
---
Blame the assholes who decided to try and profit off these exclusive things and not the company that's doing the right thing and stopping it üíÅ
---
why u gay?
---
Wtf do you mean we want every killer nerfed? no we just wanna have fun. Solo is BS. they need to just remove 4 man SWF's.
---
 they own the right to that because it funworld own to so technically they can drop this in April 1st think Bhvr think about it
---
*Gets up from chair*
---
Let‚Äôs make it work.
---
That's rank reset sweaters for you, baby!
---
Oh my god, thank god I thought to search this sub. I just played a match with this add on and I was FUMING that it wasn‚Äôt working.
---
Learned out the hard way and took a pallet to the face, which my trap should‚Äôve prevented them from dropping in the first place... :(
---
Tbh I had none oh these so I‚Äôm excited rip to the people who had the before
---
Just the best template that I find relevant.
---
Aint like dead dead, but more like getting hit with a nerf hammer and some rework :( If you ask me, still a nerf.
---
also whats with Nurse? shes still killing it
---
I am not even against some of the changes and I agree some of them are nice. Doesnt change the fact that makes 2 outta the 3 or 4 meta killers will be nerfed within 6 weeks of each other. That's a quick route to narrowing the meta.
---
It's obvious the devs are more concerned about 'over performing' killers than buffing ones that struggle. Meanwhile competent survivors can depip a killer at a rate of 75%, if that's their goal, which has been shown time and time again
---
BLEND
---
Excellent advice. And always remember to push them towards your traps during a chase if possible! It's totally doable :) Not gonna be easy on the first try, but that's why it's a challenge!
---
It's not about logic. It's about mechanics and rigid body mechanics dont work that way. Each player occupies a space and you both cant be in one place due to the physics engine. I'm sure they could code killers to be "heavier" but as it stands that's not a thing right now.
---
I literally said i never bought exclusives
---
Nurse and Spirit are still God tier tho
---
Both sides do it because they think they're funny. Nothing else to it.
---
*The IRS wants to know your location*
---
You're talking like he isn't a top tier killer for a reason
---
Window hits are intended. Sorry bud
---
Yeah that's the thing. I play on PC and Playstation 4. The rule of thumb for console is if you are a killer you have to message the survivors and let them know that you plan to farm. Otherwise it's an obvious trap. For instance a guy that was playing trapper said he wanted to farm but instead of sending the message to everybody he only sent it to one person in my group and he brought a Mori. That is a dead giveaway that it's a goddamn trap
---
I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic to the comment you are replying to or agreeing with it. They person you replied to wasn't the person that started the fighting game analogy.
---
You just got bamboozled. I hate to say it but these things happen
---
I understand your frustration, but they have body blocking as an achievement source in the game too.  It can work both ways. I personally feel that after 30 seconds of collision, the survivors should be able to pass through the killer. Some killers will stall the game or trap survivors in a certain area. 
---
I‚Äôve seen it happen to one of CowsIAMs‚Äô friends in a game on coldwind, and also I‚Äôve seen a screenshot of a doctor trapping two survivors in the Thompson House.
---
Every game, huh? 
---
Doubt
---
&gt;  but that's sort of on you to learn and out-outsmart them
---
I can "outsmart" any survivor by pinpointing their location based on hearing their breathing &amp; footsteps while they can't see me. Good luck outsmarting that.
---
I've got all of the Doctor's, GF's, Freddy's, LF's, and Nurse's perks available in every killer's bw. I've also got some from Wraith and one or two from Demogorgon. So I've got a selection, but by no means is it a VAST selection.
---
I can still hear your breathing and footsteps and pebbles are obvious as hell.
---
I'd actually say - deflects are skillchecks with their timings.
---
Lol, that pig was probably thinking "eh I'm good, the trap will kill her"
---
Not to the length they have been lately. Sorry bud
---
You're right. I agree with that change and the lack of window vault. Thing is, this isnt about just 1 piece of the change. It's the whole list and it is a good sized list. They gave survivors nearly everything they asked for in this nerf. It's so much.
---
Compare these changes to the Wraith 'rework'. Gave him a small natural windstorm. Wow. Woot. So overwhelming. 
---
When a killer is 'over performing' they nearly will gut it and take away all that survivors ask for. When a killer is under performing, they trickle in 1 or 2 things that generally leave it as a C-tier killer.
---
A Survivor can not push a killer, dunno what you are talking about.
---
The should remove it from the shop until then üëçüèª
---
Nerfed yeah.  In an objectively healthier state? No, not by a long shot. Spirit is sadly broken by the fact her power is guessing on the survivor's part with the killer having almost absolute control. New Nurse i have to commit my time to learn her now instead of using crutches like omega and 3 blink, nerfed Spirit will still give me those 3ks and 4ks like rain.
---
Didn't it keep grass from moving?
---
I was under the impression the spirit doesn't interact with the environment while phasing, so no corn, reeds, grass, etc.
---
Nothing more cringe-inducing than ‚Äúthis is going on Reddit‚Äù oof.
---
Not true. I was never toxic until the survivors thinking it's funny made me that way. Of course I think some people are just shit at the game so they camp because otherwise they wouldnt get any kills. There are a multitude or reasons. The best course of action is to wait out the reset and just not be toxic. Just play the game.
---
she thique
---
If they gave Michael the ability to traverse the map like that I'd shit my pants in fear
---
maybe because you didn't answer me, and also i said stop replying now, i don't feel like replying to you anymore when you're filling my notifications
---
Facecamp with Family &gt; Survive with Friends
---
It's weird, I don't remember scrolling through twitter but this post found me anyways. Hunh.
---
the changes are good because they discourage bad players, while still leaving great players to play her in an ungodly fashion
---
I also love Hex: One-Shot but it's only really useful during endgame.
---
I'm well aware of it, I'm actually thinking of something else to help killers with those situations but will take some time to balance things out to make sure it doesn't sound to OP or just useless.
---
This happened to my friends and I on an auto haven map. Ruin in the crane spawn. None of us could cleanse it
---
I don‚Äôt run into many killers that farm in the first place so it was unexpected. If the offering didn‚Äôt flip I wouldn‚Äôt‚Äôve gone near him with a 10ft barge pole. I got trapped by 100% extra bloodpoints. It‚Äôd be funny if it wasn‚Äôt for the facecamp
---
THICC
---
Nurse is still best
---
^^ I feel like I can never lose spirit on swamp cause of the loud mushy footsteps and the ridiculous amount of vegetation
---
*from everywhere on the map at all times
---
I dont think I've ever escaped a spirit as survivor. Maybe I suck maybe shes op. I have a hard time with plague too.
---
Do you think camping (new killers doing it) can be blamed on the tutorials for not teaching new killers about applying pressure?
---
Juggling referring to after downing a survivor they pick up and drop to make the survivor waste D.S, so you infact do both tunnel and then juggle. It's a term that's existed since the release of Laurie.
---
I believe it's still unannounced what they are going to be.
---
I can never get anything going with that one but when it works it works. I just unlocked Hex: Deepthroat...can‚Äôt wait to use it next game
---
Spies from the shadow. Knock out and deerstalker are both good for slugging.
---
Oh okay I didn't know that
---
Go quit a game right now and look. Its 2.
---
And this is why I feel "Hello Zepp" should play during the last ~10 seconds of an RBT. That would have elevated this already fantastic clip into such a cinematic place.
---
I mean... i can‚Äôt remember the last time a killer was absolutely gutted besides legion who rightfully deserved a major change to his power because it took no skill.  Nurse had some small changes and overall made her add ons more fair and fun.  It‚Äôs good sized but it makes her power require simply more skill, like Nurses cooldown.  They still have EXTREMELY high potential and can take down 4Man SWF toxic gen rushers with enough practice.  I 1000000% agree they need to take it up to a level or buffing bad killers.  Doctor, clown, and Legion should be getting reworked and improved heavily soon.  If every killer was in skill between Michael and Hillbilly this game would be so much better.
---
Bruh The Shining Chapter
---
Killer shack window mind game is fun to do and fun to play against.
---
Does this challenge mean do 3 generators yourself in one game or end the game with at least 3 generators completed?
---
Body blocking is a viable strategy, fellow killer. If they want to do that nonsense drop the survivor you are carrying and slug away. Punish them back for their behavior.
---
If I think about it yes. I played tutorials first when I started. 75% of the game I had to learn by going on YouTube and watching videos. My first match I facecamped because i didnt like how people didnt just die on the first hook because I didnt fully understand the concept of the game yet. Same with survivor sides. They dont explain looping or how to play properly. I still dont fully understand how to properly do some loops and I'm 500 hours in. It seems like some killers and survivors have a much better grasp on the concept than I do.
---
Futa :^)
---
For those who don't follow:  
---
Killer - Green (Me)  
---
Survivor 1 - White\*  
---
Survivor 2 - Yellow\*  
---
Survivor 3 - Orange  
---
Survivor 4 - Didn't say a word &lt;3  
---
\*   - SWF
---
Not a couple, maybe 1. But what does that do? You get it right back after a few more games lol.
---
I think it's mostly for gen grabber spirit, where you could position yourself precisely behind the survivor by trying to collide with them while they're working, giving them no time to react to the grab. There's been occasions where I've lost track of someone with iron will, but accidentally bumped into them and got a hit, but that's rare.
---
Sometimes you have to tunnel the OOO especially when it‚Äôs a Swf. A OOO destroys some killers and sometimes all killers just in general, especially a good OOO player. 
---
Otherwise you can‚Äôt do much and they can just give the team all the resources they need. But usually when OOO goes down the team isn‚Äôt that good. 
---
You‚Äôll see people block hits for the OOO because they need that person alive.
---
Hey wanna come clean out my gutters for free?
---
Also include bugs, broken hitboxes, and extra toxic ghost face t baggers.
---
If you were camping your totems than do the gens?
---
Also God tier perk when killers are absolutely shredding the team and they have to wait to pick up 3 people for no reason. As a survivor it never comes off my builds. As a killer the only time it changes my game play is if I'm doing too well. I don't tunnel because being tunneled ruins my game when it happens to me. If it deactivated after hooking a different survivor id be happy on both sides.
---
I just dislike the Emo-Rock part about him. 
---
And his metal-esque cosmetic.
---
No I did answer the question. I just didn't lay down and take it from your bullshit question. If you didn't want responses then maybe you shouldn't have engaged to begin with.
---
&gt; *and the tier 2 give more fragments than the tier 1.*
---
According to my screen, the total number of Fragments in I is 93 while the total number in II is 84, so you're getting less Fragments.
---
For comparison, the PTB Fragment reward totals were 93, 84, 90, and 85.
---
Deerstalker is the one, yeah I tend to spam hatchets a lot so people often get downed a fair bit away.
---
*Heavy Raider and Warlord breathing*
---
If you do it every game I'm sure there's something.
---
Saw a complaint that billy was just point and click to win
---
Pig's adoptive father was a serial killer who trained her to kill people.
---
Omg!! I just checked. Downloading now. Thank you
---
Spirit never returned to the Earth. She became half-salt machine, half-animal and floated forever through space. And though she wished for death, she was unable to die. So eventually, she stopped thinking.
---
Ahh then yeah, but can I point you toward not otzdarva my friend? Lol. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even know scottjund was that popular.
---
Literally couldn't care less about Nurse change. I don't play her or Spirit, but I liked the vault animation. The collision change would be plenty. I don't see a reason to do 4+ nerfs at the same time.
---
I like the idea that the entity is basically like a child who doesn't really *get* people.
---
*Conqueror flail swinging intensifies*
---
I think I'd better blame those who got scammed because they were so naive. 
---
I'm not justifying scamming. It's disgusting and disgraceful. But their victims made mistakes which are going to be a good lesson for them.
---
Agreed. Most of us Spirit vets rarely use those add-ons anyways unless we want to screw over a particularly nasty SWF or cause them to DC.
---
Yeah I don't really know what people are freaking out on this one. A challenge, but not remotely impossible.
---
So if I could make a build with what you have I'd first be sad I don't have Devour because that is my favorite perk to run (just a fun playstyle building up to those sweet moris and surprising everyone with oneshots).
---
But you've got some stuff to play with here.
---
Bbq will beat out thrilling but either can do what you need to, which is being able to determine the next hits after you've finished off the chase so bring either (personally you should run bbq rather than tremors).
---
You could actually get some milelage out of Surge. Using bbq, you'll know where those backwoods gen-jockeys are and can use your stalk to get the jump on them. Mark and one hit right next to the gen for a guaranteed Surge proc.
---
I've heard of success running Thanatophobia on Ghost Face's that don't bother with the one hits and just like to sneaky-sneaky so that is certainly a contender for a slot. Especially if you are looking for a stall perk to slow the game down
---
Freddy's Remember Me can be hella useful if you need are getting pushed back to the end game often. You'll be making sure that survivors are stuck at the exit gates looking like a tool taking \~40 seconds to pull a switch down. This can give you time to mark and one hit or scare them off of the switch and prolong the game.
---
Nurse's Calling is just always a fun perk to play with since it will give you sweet wall hacks on those particularly ballsy survivors healing right next to you. If you do a lot of Mark &gt; One hits, this perk loses a lot of mileage but can still help you tunnel in on a claudette that decided the tree right next to the hook was a good place to heal.
---
Speaking of wall hacks, I'm All Ears is an excellent option as well. A survivor is fleeing into a jungle gym and you get to open your third eye and checkmate them with some 4th dimension chess moves. It is incredbily effective and fun if played around with.
---
Sorry for the tsunami of text over here, but I just wanted to go over the perks you had in some detail.
---
As for what I would run in your case:
---
**bbq, i'm all ears, surge, nurses calling** would personally be fun to play with and you can swap in perks here and there as you see fit to make the build your own. You'll be able to easily snipe people off of gens and utilize surge very well and in a chase situation you'll have the fun bonus of i'm all ears and nurses call for some wall-hacking intel.
---
Oh trust me, I watch Otz the most especially to the variety in perks he runs. I picked Scott because he‚Äôs up there and he is the only one (to my knowledge) that has directly crtiqued how True sees the spirit.
---
personally i don‚Äôt consider pipping to be a win, but thats entirely subjective.
---
Legion dooooo iiiiiiiiiiiit
---
Super Sprint that builds up an exhaustion meter which prevents even normal running?
---
I didn't think I could fall more in love with that Kate skin
---
And now today happened
---
I wish Bubba was a better killer, I bought this game to play as Leatherface. Imagine my surprise when I realized that literally EVERYONE ELSE is miles ahead of him. 
---
What does [Acceleration] even mean?
---
It‚Äôll be harder to play her with collision gone and it‚Äôll be easier for survivors to juke her, but shes still a very strong killer it seems from the notes. Billy will be the new number 1 killer I guess though. 
---
Rip Queen Spirit, your reign was short but supreme. *October 2019 - November 2019*
---
Myers should honestly just be programmed to do it if you're facing a survivor who is hooked haha
---
I'm strongly on the side of "killers should be brave enough to leave the hook and keep the game engaging" but even then, as a survivor, the ECG is the last resort for Killers to get their kills.
---
It's pretty reasonable; a hooksave during ECG should be incredibly challenging and take as much teamwork and wit as possible
---
*hamon
---
Very easy just bring the right perks and play smart üòÇ
---
Then that's a YOU issue.
---
I play as Killer with Surveillance, Ruin, PGTW and Thrilling Tremors/Haunted Ground.
---
My matches always last 10-15 minutes.
---
After the locker change the tracking is almost meaningless.
---
The sound design on Demogorgon is top tier for sure, everything from the worldwide portal sound to chase music puts me on edge. 
---
And I love it.
---
What's the situation with Im all ears? Like what does it take to do that or to have it activate, and how long does it last?
---
This is true with every killer, if a good spirit at 110% gets you before phasing you're basically screwed, yes. If a good nurse catches you wounded you're pretty much screwed.
---
If I'm playing clown and you're wounded, unless you're literally next to a pallet you're screwed.
---
I can find you with any killer if you're close enough to be heard.
---
You should only be getting away from a killer while injured if you're at a seriously abusable loop/set of loops or the killer flat out fucks up lol
---
I think you'll find that spirits will lose a lot of their power at loops simply due to collision. You will be inured less often from being bumped into, so you won't have to worry as much about facing the spirit while injured.
---
There's no version of this game where being injured is "fine so don't worry about it" unlessit's a version of the game with hilariously pathetic killers
---
Got any friends you could do swf with?
---
My main problem is when you're injured there is literally nothing you can do against her, hell even iron will isn't reliable because stridor hard counters it. Also her being able to see you move grass but you not being able to is super frustrating.
---
No, I'm assuming it happens occasionally, and when it does the right response isn't to just give up and go to the next game as you seem to have implied you do no matter how far you got.
---
You are absolutely right that when survivors have 2 or 3 gens left it's not a big deal, although probably still a bit annoying, but I'm talking about the occasional few times where someone is downed early, then gives up or DCs and leaves a team of 3 to do 5 gens, which again, is still very possible but not nearly as likely as the balance is offset a lot. That is when the mentality is BS and you are making the game less enjoyable for those who can't quite deal with this situation
---
I don't know about that, I'm not entirely convinced yet.
---
Probably some kind of fetish video.
---
Can't get the achievement if you use those perks. That's kind of the point.
---
You wrongly assumed he was just letting people point farm, so you walk up to him, let him hook you for free, then create a post complaining about being hooked?
---
Struggling to see the point of this :s
---
It would be the worst strategy in most cases to let the survivors rescue their friend while you chase another out the door. They're asking you to do that and trying to punish you for not doing it.
---
It feels especially bad to be on the hook when freedom is, like, right there, but don't get shit-talked into a losing strategy. Most other actions at that point are equivalent to going AFK, unless you're certain someone is nearby and ready to go down.
---
Iirc it was a retexture.
---
Yeah but this outlines how stupid op Spirit is
---
Excuse the low quality meme, I'm salty and this is my first meme :(
---
Then Meyers, then Fredward, then ghostface... with pig getting nerfed between each round of nerfs until her ultimate nerf.
---
You FOOL! THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK!
---
Putting them in the free track does make them money. Just look how they handle it now. They encourage you to grind up to Level 47 to get the full set. And while doing so, you are always reminded what you would get now, if you buy the premium track. Besides that there IS event related stuff in the premium track as well. An exclusive charm and a time exclusive Nurse cosmetic. Only available through the Rift.   
---
But to be fair. Their main problem probably was that they had to put so much in the recent time frames. They gave us dedicated servers, a new swf lobby, archives and the typical new chapter changes. And because most of them is basicly brand new is why the last couple of patches were probably more bugheavy. That really will go away with time, when those system are both running.
---
Was that part of it too? There have been so many flashlight or pallet changes I don't remember.
---
Would make sense of it being scared of Myers...also another reason why Michael is the BOI
---
People aren't taking into account the experience you're gaining while doing the challenges.  It can take 6-8 games to get all of the requirements finished, so in the time it took you to finish a challenge and get 5 fragments, you've already gotten another 3-5 just from normal gameplay.
---
Ormond Resort especially kills any aura perks for me, I can‚Äôt see any red on that map :(
---
I was adding onto your huntress on ketamine joke but alright my dude
---
Because the devs are smarter than our little bitching asses, analyzed the data available to them, and with that information identified exactly where they thought it was best to make changes to pull Spirit back to a tolerable level maybe ? 
---
Vault animation, collision and prayer beads were also in the top priority of complaining players lately also.
---
Please go fuck yourself
---
Yeah because no one else uses the same perks over and over.
---
I don‚Äôt see a problem in tunneling OoO. The idea behind the perk is literally that the killer sees you most of the time and if you get chased you already pretty fucked up.
---
Wasn‚Äôt spirit phasing sound global outside of her terror radius anyway?
---
Billy can be looped easily, his chainsaw is fair but can be incredible in the right hands. The "salty survivor mains" are actually people wanting to have the broken killers fixed.
---
No. If the last gens are powered what is there for you to do? There‚Äôs nothing to patrol and more than likely they‚Äôre going to rush the hook for the save.
---
Nah, I angerey.
---
That's unfair. How are they supposed to know they're being scammed? Especially if it was some kid. Though, anyone who spends ridiculous amounts of money on pixels is kinda dumb. 
---
 I applaud BHVR for doing something about it.
---
Lucky you! Since the dedicated servers I've experienced the disconnects frequently and usually it says I did it, so I de-rank. I guess my 100mb/s+ internet isn't good enough to stay connected to DbD :(
---
As a survivor main I can say this: survivors aren't entitled to anything.  
---
If I'm farmed I appreciate if killers just slug me and chase the unhooker so I have a chance to get back up (if my team helps at least), but it's not a right.   
---
Let alone killers giving you hatch. I love it when killers do it, but again I'm a survivor main: of course I fucking do. I secretly hope for it, but never expect it.   
---
His team made mistakes and so did he, that doesn't give him a get out of jail free card :/
---
At minimum if you want to get the challenge done in 4 games, you have to sacrifice 3 survivors for 3 games and the last game you have to sacrifice 4.
---
Nice
---
I've heard that too.
---
Neither nurse or spirit have been affected by the "nerfs"
---
I wonder if Trapper taking his victim out of trap counts as one. Anyway, it is pretty easily doable on window/pallet jumps.
---
&gt; It's way too powerful in its current state.
---
It only has a certain time frame to use it, only able to use once you get off hook, and can only use it once per match. How is that too strong?
---
Oh, great, didn't know that. I have all the exclusives and I was super happy about it. Is this true?!  
---
Is there any good reason why they unlock it for everyone? Why don't they just make new skins, recolors of our exclusives?    
---
I've been making one or two posts about my lost legacy per year, but in 2019 I gave up on it. It's very unfortunate but obviously, if BHVR wanted to do something about it, they'd already have done that. They had plenty of time...  
---
I hate to say it, but I love exclusives. I've been with DBD since the very beginning, what is wrong with giving dedicated players certain skins they can only unlock if they are/have been there during a certain time?
---
If someone is dumb enough to buy an account then they don‚Äôt deserve to have money or be on the internet
---
That‚Äôs true but that‚Äôs her power tho. It‚Äôs her base kit to phase and follow ambient cues to find you, idk what to tell you, it‚Äôs like complaining Michael can save his tier 3, or that wraith can bodyblock
---
Oh yeah. If you want, I would suggest checking out some of Otzdarva's videos of his use for it. He really makes the most of those 6 seconds and shows off how much you can mess with a survivors mind.
---
I honestly dont understand the appeal of exclusive items. Does it make people feel special or something? Honestly its just a video game and you dont get any gold stars for starting to play a game before someone else in real life.

Thanks for your response! Unfortunately i have no control over the other survivors as i‚Äôm only playing with one other person :‚Äô) 
---
I actually got Myers instantly and remembering to break los was actually helpful!
---
There‚Äôs two locker sizes apparently?
---
Think of it this way. You leave the hook. They go I hook the hooked person. You chase a rescuer then you manage to hit them one time. They get a burst of speed and almost every time run injured out the gate. It‚Äôs often very hard to secure a kill in the end game collapse scenario. If you want to guarantee you have a kill at the end of the game camping is the least risky strategy. What is your other option in the above scenario? Tunnel the person who just got hooked and maybe they have DS or Borrowed Time and you wind up losing them anyway?
---
Some people just can‚Äôt stand blood on their clothes
---
But they're not exclusive tho
---
I only watch OTZ tbh
---
What "exclusives"?
---
Oh it‚Äôs increased for sure.
---
Yeah hes self affirming with a huge ego.
---
Dude all killers are about the same. Getting a 4k was easy and still is with all killers, except for old freddy, who was fun but since ¬´¬†BuFf WeAk KiLlErS¬†¬ª, he got a rework and is now trash. All killers are good, and demogorgon is op.
---
*laughs in iron maiden/bbq huntress*
---
Otz is the G.O.A.T
---
Man and I was literally just looking at his channel and thought "Damn he hasn't uploaded in a bit"
---
0-1 kill = loss
---
2 kill = tie
---
3-4 kills = win
---
DC counts as a kill
---
Happened to me too. Reported it.
---
The outfit is pretty crap at the moment. The forums have a post with 5k views showing images of it.
---

---
Because it's certainly better to have people selling these "exclusives" for $1,000+ online. Riiiiight.
---
Noob3 is a good one but he is a survivor main.
---
no because gen speed is already an issue
---
How about stop worrying about some damn lockers and help out your sqaud
---
Well you watch Fungoose and Otz, you‚Äôre already on the right track, those are the only people I watch. 
---
But Scottjund is pretty good and a amazing huntress player.
---
Once had a survivor say ‚Äúyou are so nice‚Äù - gave me the feels
---
It's more that people slug to avoid Decisive Strike, which by the way dEcIsIvE cOuNtErS tUnNeLlInG cause the Killer totally isn't just going to slug you.
---
I just want Shaun from Shaun of the Dead as a Survivor.
---
i got level three bbq and my myers isnt even level 50
---
if it's console idk but PC is fine with me and my friend, although queues were terribly long especially because we're normally red ranks so it runs us like 10 mins to find a lobby and that's if the game doesn't boot us after waiting and loading into the game, just dbd being dbd as per usual
---
I still get terrors when I see a cent now, despite him being a wet tissue now
---
The end of iron giant be like
---
The way I have always seen it is if the survivors are dumb enough to let you trap them then they cant complain when they die. Since you had a terror radius and everything they had plenty of oppurtunities to get away and chose not to.
---
Aww that's really cute, but don't overthink it! If their friend messes up like that, don't be afraid to punish them! If you REALLY are afraid for a mean reaction, just hit the friend once and move on to the next target so they have to waste more time on healing :)  
---
Also a quick question since I don't have spirit: is iron will mandatory against them or are there other ways to avoid them? When I play without it they always seem to get the second hit for free with their power, but I don't like to always have to run iron will just because a 'what if it's spirit?' mindset.  
---
Sorry if it's a silly question, but I'm really struggling against her and don't know her weaknesses since I can't play her :')
---
Keep playing the game?
---
Getting hooked is a part of the game, in fact thinking about it with the current ranking system and how everyone cares so much about rank, you're screwing the killer as well because they are going to have a much harder time reaching those 9 hooks for iridescent sacrifices.
---
I don't really know how else to respond, it's like you're asking me why you shouldn't just give up when you are hit once by a boss in dark souls or why you shouldn't just fold every hand after losing one hand in a game of poker, there's still so much left in the game so why leave?
---
If we all bitch at the same volume then that equals balance?
---
I‚Äôm new to dbd what does p3 mean?
---
Sure. When they deserve it and cant abuse collision.
---
Oh wow, I had no idea there was a difference. Thanks so much!
---
I love running Infectious Fright, Ruin, BBQ/ deerstalker and some other perk. Works great.
---
Wait, are they making _all_ the exclusives unlockable now?  Except maybe Legacy
---
You're a good noodle &lt;3
---
Somebody give this man a reddit plat
---
Finally no more free hits because stupid collision
---
HybridPanda is a good one to watch. He does a weekly show where he talks about the perks on the Shrine of Secrets and explains them and then uses them in a game to show them in action. He has videos on every single killer. He also does survivor stuff as well.
---
You still got it for what, a year? 2? 3?. If other people enjoying something makes it so you can't enjoy it, you probably didn't deserve it in the first place.
---
I HATE when a killer plays fair, doesn't bm, camp or tunnel and then a player tea bags at the exit gates. Like seriously? I guess those players like facecamping bubbas more.
---
IKR! Thank you!
---
Love Otz
---
No argument from me there.
---
 What a pointless point
---
147.6 hours past 2 weeks

Hey what headset do you own? I own a Logitech G933 and basically when I change the equaliser on pc, it saves the settings for when using on console. Basically just turn down the treble and up the bass / midrange and you'd be good to go.
---
Didn‚Äôt let him hook me for free. Two of us were healing a guy who repeatedly got hit with him watching us, as soon as he got close he revved up his chainsaw w/ tuning guide. I didn‚Äôt have sprint burst. Given the circumstances it was fair to think we were farming. 
---
The post is mainly about face campers, which I see all over the community. A lot of things have been nerfed because of community feedback, like insta blinds, BNP‚Äôs were nerfed into oblivion, nurse, spirits getting changes because none of those were particularly fun for one side or the other. Face camping is unfun for both sides yet there‚Äôs somehow not a solution against it?
---
Selfish? They played events and grinded for items. It sounds like *you're* the entitled one. Just gotta have the special item because bhvr owes it to you huh
---
I mean it was the only other real option to find a Dweard code unless getting stupid lucky at a giveaway or making plans to go across the country to some convention that they might hand codes out at.
---
There are way more fun alternatives to Ruin that are also way more consistent. Try them out!
---
I play both sides and unless you are literally running away for a full second, its intended. A fast vault doesn't mean iframes fam
---
cant find the original post but THAT is a repost. exactly the same images
---
yea like, gimme your setup then
---
They should just put them in the store.
---
The most common one is t-bagging, especially at the exit gates it just hurts. Sometimes it's constant flashlight clicking, but that's more bait and just an annoyance.
---
And last and not least: people can be fucking nasty in the endgame chat, it can be quite sad at times since it's basically a 4 vs 1  in an argument so you might actually start to doubt yourself :/
---
We earned these items under a false pretense of them being event exclusive. The devs lied, op is right to be annoyed
---
 ***Ryujin no ken wo kurae!!!***
---
I don't mean the rift exclusively. I mean everything. I know programming is a different team than cosmetic design and all that but that time and resources has to go somewhere. New cosmetics do involve some programming and tweaking so that does take SOME time away regardless. You don't see them saying "We are going to hold off on working on new DLC for game health" do you? Their road map doesn't say "X amount of new cosmetics every chapter" does it? They keep churning it out because "Dolla dolla bills ya'll" (or in their case Loonie Loonie Toonies ya'll).  
---
I get they have to make money to pay people to fix shit but you really think taking a month or two off not focusing on DLC and focusing on this "game health" they keep dangling in front of us would shut them down? Hardly.
---
My point is it all feels like corporate double speak BS to me.
---
I'm honestly lost 
---
Why the fuck do people think Spirit will become weak or unplayable? That's not the point of the changes
---
And why the hell do people think the changes were to make her weak?
---
The changes were made so playing her wouldn't reward you by playing lazy or winning because of prayer beads
---
The vault changes are EXTREMELLY welcome too, It wasn't about mind gaming, just something confusing, her vault being confusing was not their intention in the first place
---
Must be nice to have that kind of disposable income
---
Well I haven‚Äôt played against any survivors using it and they usually still do pretty well. Keep in mind though I‚Äôm not the most skilled player lol. My matches usually vary, I always get at least two survivors though. I don‚Äôt tend to rely on my power as I‚Äôm not great at reading the situation during loops/chases but I know some spirits rely on the power so I‚Äôm not too much help. From personal experience though, iron will seems like it‚Äôs probably helpful but I‚Äôve seen plenty do just fine without it! My personal weakness is the whole 360 thing, I struggle to follow someone‚Äôs trail if I‚Äôve had to spin and end up losing myself, also when I use my power I‚Äôll sometimes take a shortcut which ultimately throws me off more than help me in most situations. I‚Äôd say it depends on the skill of the person playing the Spirit. Sorry if this isn‚Äôt much help, just tryin to answer as best I can!
---
I guess you play way to much for me then fam, i didnt expect you to do literally nothing but play the game.
---
I can assure you it's not, can send you proof if you are so sure about it being a repost ^^
---
Its gonna be "nerf ghost face/plague" in a couple months. How much y'all wanna bet??
---
aww yeah welcome back survivor buddy!!
---
In any multiplayer game, your 'ally' can always fk you up in any shape or form.
---
I'd honestly rather get tunneled and die quickly if a killer is going to do that, versus spending a bunch of time on the ground cause I keep getting slugged.
---
I honestly don't have a problem with it, because I want more players to feel included.
---
Myers and Ghostface already have 0 collision when using their power. Nothing will happen
---
Despite all the negative things about it, I wish the consoles also had an after-game chat.
---
Dude you sound like those chumps who cry about their fortnite skins being rereleased lol 
---
I for one am glad they're giving these out seeing as some of my cosmetics vanished into thin air  despite me filling out a support ticket and giving them everything they needed to confirm my account i never heard anything back or got my cosmetics back. You'll be fine kid
---
The punk ass bitch couple, I like it :')
---
Lmao.... yeah I may had exaggerated her posterior to my personal preference a bit..  haha
---
Bhvr: *"Seeing how we wanted to stop grey market sellers, and the grey market sells legacy accounts for thousands of dollars, we've decided to give everyone legacy"* 
---
The rework is good, and balanced. What I think is going on is that people are saturated with spirit. She‚Äôs all you apparently see in high ranks, and the community is crawling with discussions about her.
---
She‚Äôs not unloopable, or I have been playing against potatoes, and yeah, you are severely fucked when she has a hit on you without IW, but the rework is doing it‚Äôs part. The vault, the speed post phase, the collision, she is getting more balanced, I don‚Äôt think she needs any more work
---
She‚Äôs a fun killer to go against, her base kit is alright and it has always been, when she was considered weak at release I think her base kit was the same as now, right?
---
He belives killers need more buffs, he belives hatch should be removed, he belives spirit is underpowered and needs more buffs, he popularizes the killer vs survivor hate train causing an even larger divide in the community, he has a massive ego and blames whatever that defeats him ingame on a balance issues and devs listen to him, he's just really unhealthy for the games survival.
---
Dat booty tho
---
Believes*
---
A Xenomorph for sure. Since they seem to be ok with non human killers now.
---
Whenever I go for the 4% it's because the killer is tunneling me hard, survivors farmed other teammates, other survivors are low skilled/doing nothing but hiding, or I just want to try my luck and unhook myself.
---
The only way of losing as killer is displeasing the entity, so just have fun ignore those losers.
---
Definitely not bannable as EGC will force the game to a close.
---
Possibly scummy/toxic/(whateverwordyouwantotusetodescribeit) as you're purposely taking advantage of a mechanic to guarantee Survivors can't escape unless you move out of the way.
---
I see as they messed up by being up there when gates were powered/opened.
---
I might have to try that out
---
I hate when that happens, especially when I went out of my way to save them. Like I risked my life for THAT!?
---
I feel like Father's Glasses makes more sense for this meme except for the fact that no one uses it.
---
Later you'll also see why people eventually stop to use it
---
You lost me on this one bud. Let's take Meg who could be the lightest survivor. Let's say  she  ways 115-120lbs and the clown who would be about 300. It would still be hard for him to push through a Meg who he is 2.5 times heavier than. Also is you tried to push through someone who is in front of you would most likely trip and fall
---
Did you only respond to my comment to boost your ego then?
---
This statement holds true if you‚Äôre roughly Rank 20-10. Play against actual survivors instead of sentient cabbages lightly bumping their controllers and you‚Äôll quickly realize that the killers definitely *aren‚Äôt* basically the same. Kills that lack map pressure will struggle heavily to maintain an upper hand if they don‚Äôt have an exceptional early game and carry that momentum for the duration of the match
---
IT's crazy how similar the community is for both of these games
---
But as op said, it hasn't been in the shrine for a couple of months
---
Legion had problems since the beginning, Nurse and Spirit are still the strongest killers. Hillbilly is one of the most balanced killers.
---
&gt;Wrong. It takes half the time, but requires two people. The time spent by the team is the same. There is also a time cost for finding an ally to heal you.
---
You don't have to waste time "finding an ally", if you don't see them in a gen, they are doing something wrong.
---
I knew it!
---
if you take away breathing, moaning, scratch marks, and grass moving, when a spirit phases they can juke your ass and be on the other side of the map lmfao
---
Event cosmetics were formerly exclusive rewards for completing various challenges. You may not understand this, but some people like to stand out- these cosmetics showed what they had achieved in game, nothing wrong with that
---
Okay say the devs sort the overall speed out, then do you think this perk would work well?
---
Killer mains lose their fucking shit when needed balance tweaks for killer is made but let it be for survivor tweaks and no one gives a shit lol
---
It's a double edged sword, but I mostly enjoy it! If I'm salty I just leave lol
---
*nurse and spirit get changes that keep there position on the tier list, top tier mains are hardly effected, and they are undoubtedly still OP but more fair* 
---
Reddit: OMG GUYS SURVIVOR MAINS ARE GETTING ALL THE KILLERS NERFED!&gt;!?!?!1?? NEXT IS BILLY!!!! NURSE NEW LEGION! SPIRIT NEW LEGION!
---
They said they‚Äòve been meaning to not release any exclusives anymore. The reason why they will release the exclusive skins is because they weren‚Äòt available for console players and because people used to sell them for a ridiculous amount of money, some even scamming people. 
---
Or at least it was sth like that, it is def stated in their developer update if you want to look it up.
---
This would actually be a neat little improvement to the store, I agree.
---
No, becuase i didnt expect anyone to actually play over a weeks worth of gametime in 3 weeks this early into the rift. Your sleep schedule  must suck or you just dont work
---
Thrilling tremors freddy is op. I wouldnt use devour idk tho
---
i litteraly saw these two images 2 months ago, but sure
