Or you know you could not act like an asshat and give it time. We all were at this point you know.
---
---
---
You were new too at some point, don't be a toxic dick just because someone is new.
---
It's sadly still very common. But the irony here is hilarious.
---
Swap ghostface for Freddy in your explanation. Ghostface only really needs to consider stealth and stalk, and while takes a bit of time to master is easier to understand on how to place. Freddy has 4 factors to consider when playing-    1. Snares/ pallets placement, 2. Teleportation to working gens 3. Dream cycle + escaping dreams 4. Players being effected by the snares . *BONUS* his massive fucking lunge.
---
Yup the biggest problem for me is the constant FPS drops when playing Killer, I thought it was only me.
---
It's a sign. Delete the game.
---
Me

You should check out zubatlel on twitch, all his emotes are crying cats!

In my experience the Myers Killers have been the most fun to go up against

Honestly it's not that bad because it also serves a huge open area for the Nurse to just teleport on you.
---
So wholesome god damn thought I’d never see the day!
---
while lobbies are long i've only dodged 1 cause it was a 4 man swf with toolboxes
---
I absolutely loved this skit, like holy hell I laughed so hard the first time
---
Many people stay on the previous version without realizing there’s an update
---
That makes sense. Just what i thought i remembered hearing. Im red/green colorblind so being killer is a major pain in the ass for me lol
---
The fog has *no concept* of time.
---
Up is down, *left* is RIGHT, mustard is **ketchup**!
---
^^Many ^^things ^^are ^^not ^^what ^^they ^^seem ^^in ^^The ^^Fog
---
Doesn't that say something about you if you're constantly getting matched with these new rank 20 players?
---
Do they know tunneling is bannable lmao
---
Yeah no thanks. I’m glad I didn’t put myself in that misery.
---
What is a tunnel? I play here and there not a whole lot, but when I do its killer.
---
This is all null and void if you play at higher than green ranks lmao
---
That's awesome, well done! Excited to see what else you create
---
Tunneling get you banned and I’m a rank 3 it’s not hard to fix you just need to be good I guess
---
Nice, following for more.
---
I'm so glad I am not the only one! I can 360 every killer in this game but Freddy now. I don't know what they did to him. But unless I nuke him into the Shadow Realm. I can't dodge him without Dead Hard now.
---
I believe it is when you chase the same person repeatedly till they are dead? Idk man. I hooked 2 others before this guy died first
---
I meant to put "Wes Craven's Estate". However the question remains: could this affect Freddy boi here in the U.S.? Would bhvr have to renegotiate with the estate after a certain number of years?
---
He’s dead.

---
Give her the hatch
---
It’s in his biography on the wiki I belive
---
Surprisingly well
---
That's cool. You should try territorial imperitive and make your choice. So fucking op
---
mmhmm its a big bummer :(
---
Sadly she DC'ed before I even found her. Probably had connection problems.
---
The mans got family
---
Rank 3 killer? Like idk how not to tunnel? I hooked 2 other guys before he died first
---
Matchmaking is broken worse than usual right now. There’s big discrepancies between matchups. :(
---
I got a message saying I was going to get banned for wall hacks. I was playing scratch mirror Myers and told him to look at the add on. Never replied back.
---
I was thinking using Surveillance and Ruin. Ruin would help get up some portals before too much gen progress was done, even if it was cleansed fairly early
---
May we please get a moment of silence for out lost soldier
---
(Tapps *softly plays in the background*)
---
Hey... I drew that! 😂
---
Baby Scoops is akin to Baby Dwights in my opinion &lt;3
---
And Behaviour wonders why all Survivors run Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike.
---
No need to worry about the message tunneling isn’t a bannable offense, just another salty survivor that can’t admit they lost
---
I'd be willing but it doesnt matter who. We just need someone its ridiculous
---
Thank you so so so much!!
---
About the second point, yeah, its good strategy to get the easier sacrifice, but to the survivor it might feel like you're picking on them, and not letting them play the game, since all they get to do is sit on the hook. 
---
Personally, when I'm survivor I get it, but when it happens that I get found and sacrificed to death before anyone else got hooked for 3 games in a row, I can get a bit moody.
---
Tunneling isnt against any rules, but it can make survivors salty. I do this version all the time, especially if the guy who unhooked vanished and the guy loudly moaning and leaving a trail of blood is easier to find.
---
This is great, nice work!
---
I played that. I really wanted it to be so bad it’s good but it’s just bad :(
---
someone better not get hooked lol
---
that would actually be good on him. You can hardly lose once there is only 1 gen left
---
In the video that I used, it said that it was what plays when myers is stalking. Might’ve been an unused sound though.
---
Hah, you can’t even catch me!
---
Nice. Play Myers, hes a solid killer with some fun add ons. If you want a really fun build youll need monitor and abuse to play peek a boo myers
---
Lol. I like this guy
---
*The Entity is especially amused by hatch interrupts*
---
Thank you Mister, I see you have a heart.
---
I tend to get facecamped and hit while on the hook using Steve
---
Well, it sounds like they got the rights to the original films and the original Freddy. DBD’s Freddy is based on the new films, which the article doesn’t specifically say the estate has control over. (Unless I misread something.) So, I think DBD is okay. If it was based on the original movies and the original Freddy, then there might be problems. But I think that the people who did the remake can legally argue that they own that version of Freddy (from the newer movie) and there’s nothing really that Craven’s estate can do about it. I think.
---
Copyright law is tricky and inconsistent, so it’s hard to say. But from what I’ve learned, the DBD Freddy is most likely safe.
---
jokes on you I am non-binary
---
I feel like this would be a great ghost type chatacter since this is very diffrent from what demo has now. Adding thing on top of shred seems a bit much
---
"Heh, Scoops.. Scoops Ahoy."
---
Wraith was my first killer. He’s super easy to get the hang of. 
---
My second vote goes to Michael lol. He’s loads of fun to play as and easily one of the most immersive killers in the game. The jumpscares and the gotcha moments as him are awesome.
---
Funny, that literally just happened to me. I started with "Hit 4 Hatchets", "Heal 3 Survivors", and "Be chased for 120 seconds as Claudette". Post game I looked to collect (The healing one, I'm not good enough to do the chase in one trial) but it had changed to "Chase Survivors for 180 seconds as the Trapper". Disappointing :(
---
op af dud
---
I would love to get into wraith but I'm so impatient so uncloaking is a nightmare to me. Also I just suck in chases with him.
---
You were robbed almost as bad as the saints were last season. You can contact BHRV and put in a ticket to resolve it, buuutttt... if you don't have enough evidence or your story isnt convincing they'll just say you're trying to scam
---
This happened to me before, the guy kept insisting he was a good player.
---
He stayed in a locker all game, idle crows going off every second, didn't help with a single gen
---
Yeah I definitely get that. Theres a few addons that make it quicker to uncloak and as for the chases, try bloodhound, unrelenting and if you can somehow get lucky with the shrine or buy him, ghostface’s I’m all ears perk is great against pallet and vault loopers.
---
At rank 5 I've been getting pretty good results, even with just Blood Warden and Overcharge for perks. Of course there's games where I get stomped into oblivion but otherwise he's a pretty strong killer.
---
This game is awesome fun.
---
Even better with friends.
---
I never stick around for post game chat no matter what because someone lost and someone won and it doesn't matter who - with this community - someone will always be a salty jerk ass about something. 
---
Watch some  YouTubers. Ohmwrecker. noob3. There are others people here really back, but i like those 2 because they are entertaining and you can still learn a bit. 
---
Don't sweat the haters. Just play and enjoy it. And when it comes to the day when you are a killer still play how you like and don't let any morons around here tell you you are being a bad killer. 
---
Most of the time i don't care about eacaping as a survivor. I enjoy the chases and helping others. Still gets me some points. And it's how I enjoy playing.
---
Actually putting TTV in there name is very informative it lets you know who to Mori
---
F.
---
Yeah I've definitely noticed a lot of noob steve and nancys. probably think it's a stranger things game lol
---
It's so silly, just played a game and before I even left the basement after booking the first guy all 3 survivors were basically standing right outside the killer shack...easiest 4k of my life, didn't even use insidious
---
Yeah turns out your skin color isnt the same when you're dead as when you were alive
---
That’s an odd situation cause even thought things are different between the original and the remake it’s still Freddy Krueger. So I’m going to assume the right all fall on the Craven estate. But since they’ve already established Freddy in the game I think it’s fine depending on if there is a limitation to the length of the contract. But look at the Friday the 13th game. Despite the legal issues with that the game is still going. In a way this might be good. Maybe Behaviour should contact the Craven estate and get the real Freddy Krueger. They might allow the likeness of the original Freddy which, as I understand it, New Line forced them to use the remake version.
---
oof. get WAAAAHED
---
👎
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Wow your back with a new reddit account to spam your videos here again
---
I asked my dad too, and he brought up the concept of Royalties, which is actually probably the best answer.
---
Ok? I’m sure a lot of people have completed this.
---
I don't feel it is worth it at all. Just put your portal directly next to the gen. Then it basically means that gen is a no-no. Mostly due to the fact regardless if they do the gen, you'll know, effectively doing the same thing surveillance does, while also meaning they have the oblivious status effect, allowing you to sneak up on them, and it's the same thing if they try to cleanse it as long as you check with your ability every so often. I see the idea of sneaking up on people but I personally feel it would be more rewarding to use said strategy above, especially when added with the fact it doesn't require a perk slot.
---
Should have shopped Nurseface on the face and "wheeze" on the text.

---
The mask says Ghost Face Killer but the timbos say Ghostface Killah.
---
And none running no mither shameful.
---
Good suggestion. Thanks!
---
I wanna know their reaction to the name now
---
He insults both you and himself in the same sentence, that’s skill.
---
No, because what you're proposing is the survivor doesn't get touched for 60 seconds. They can make any stupid ass play they want and get away with it or the killer gives them an infinite DS.
---
That's not only overpowered, it's downright idiotic. I can be injured, in full view of the killer, and I can actually finish a gen in front of them, bodyblock a chase, make a rescue, cleanse their Hex Totems, heal in their face, heal *SOMEONE ELSE* in the killer's face, and if they try and down me, I'm literally invincible for the entire game.
---
At least with current DS, the killer can slug if a survivor tries to be do anything risky. But in your world, that survivor could literally do whatever they want without getting punished no matter how stupid it is. Then imagine if all 4 survivors could do that. Because every survivor would run DS if it got that change.
---
The worst part is, you'd be among the first people to bitch and moan if killers had a perk that were even nearly as broken as *CURRENT* DS, let alone that super DS.
---
Huntress is a ton of fun imo, if you arent on console do her 100%.
---
Hopping on the accessibility train: 
---
1) Can we PLEASE change how struggling works?? I got to rank 1 as survivor and literally had to put down the game for quite a few months afterwards cause the game made my (already bad) arthritis way worse. Even in games where I wasn't on the hook, I was struggling (no pun intended) to manage the pain in my hands and press buttons properly after mashing x for the past 5 rounds in a row. I can only spam a button for so long before my hands stop working properly. I love DBD, but I can't physically play it for longer than an hour at the very most due to the struggle feature being so godawful. How about you do what every other game with a dying state mechanic and just have a "Hold X to give up!" option with living being a default? What is the point of button mashing to live when the game will lag out half the time and kill you anyways? I know there are fixes for this on PC (and pressing spacebar is easier than pressing a tiny x button on a controller) but I play on console and I don't want to drop a few thousand dollars just to make a game playable
---
2) I think maybe there should be a larger font option for menus and such? Almost all games have a large/bold text option (unless the feature is already in the game and I'm literally so blind I can't find it lmao) and it's just a massive struggle to read stuff. Yeah, it's not a HUGE part of the game, but it'd make things easier for some of us :)
---
3) is there any way to turn off the music that blares in a chase?? Or turn it down?? I literally cannot hear what's going on and I either have to put up with the loud music just so I can hear the game itself or I turn all my audio down at the sacrifice of not being able to hear the game itself. Maybe it's just a PS4 thing, but the audio balance is pretty terrible and downright grating
---
But it's so much fun
---
Guess who's on console😂
---
Correct.
---
And if you *have* the killer, you will just equip the load out you last set up on them.
---
Bing bong = Updoot
---
I think this a bit truthful
---
It’s kinda nice but not nice nice.
---
I like the cut of your jib!
---
I don’t have Twitter, only use Reddit. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I mean even though I am not colorblind, I use colorblind modes because a lot of the time the colors look a bit better in my opinion.
---
That's what I was wondering. About it as an intellectual property.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But if they get the original Freddy, they might have to pay Robert Englund for his likeness.
---
this happened a week ago and i was so mad :(
---
I assume this isn't common then? I'm on PS4 btw.
---
Matchmaking is extra broken right now and they are working on a hot fix.
---
Nah, but a few are dead giveaways-
---
Neon Nea.
---
P3 Claudette/Legacy skins.
---
Tiger Robe Ace (50/50 on them, they either meme and stomp you into the dirt or DC on first down).
---
Shirtless Davids/No Mither players. No Mither players scare me more than ANYTHING else, because if they’re bold enough to equip that shit, they don’t need a second health state. They’re just going to demolish you. Plus, they have no concept of “fear”. It is the ultimate flex of your confidence to run No Mither, because it says “Fuck you. I don’t need more than 1 health state to destroy you”. They scare me.
---
neither does Ghostface but we wont talk about that
---
Gangbang
---
Nice
---
Indeed, it is quite a place
---
It happens :P I always get downvoted for mentioning keys. Good thing i don't care about fake internet points!
---
I don’t understand
---
Oh thanks I have to change that xD
---
HALLELUJAH MY DUDES BH FINALLY!
---
I can't tell if this is sarcastic, but over 500 hours on this game and I just found this today 😂
---
I love your work u/DasCorfil!
---
I'm... kinda sad at the thought of what "The Hag" might have looked like before her change.  I'm also kinda excited to see your work on her!
---
Was it a SWF game? Is it an *actual* team?
---
This is why I now try to emote at the beginning of every match. If it doesn’t let me, I know it won’t let me exit through the gate and I need to find the hatch as soon as the last gen is done. Not being able to use dead hard is also a giveaway that the bug is happening. It doesn’t happen that often, but it’s good to know in advance that you need to make an alternate escape plan.
---
..Assuming the others gtfo and give you enough time to use the hatch.
---
Shit I can’t change the title
---
This willer might be a little too weak, since when survivors move they make sound on the ground, the killer can see the survivors when they move or make noise, so when standing completely still the survivors cannot be seen
---
Clown can anti loop, lf and wraith cant without certain addons
---
I am :v
---
Let me first specify that I am speaking for myself, and as a new mod to the community.
---
As someone with nearly 2000 hours in the game, I am completely obsessed and in love with this game and also  it's community. (most of the time)  I'm not a dev, I am  just a player like you. I work a 9-5 job in IT, DBD is a hobby. 
---
**Nobody is censoring anybody**. The bugs are well documented and well known - and posted about again and again.  That's an easy conclusion to make, and conspiracies ARE fun, but that is just not the case here. 
---
When a user reports a post here on /r/deadbydaylight \- or anywhere else on reddit, you do not see the name of the person doing the report.  All a reddit mod sees is "User reports &gt;&gt; "Oversaturated Content/Unrelated Content/Spam...." etc. The choices depend on the subreddit rules.
---
These reports are then filtered into a 'mod queue' for review. That allows us to target points of contention around the subreddit faster than having to troll every thread - which would be near impossible. So, the majority of the moderating actually happens by the user - the moderator just makes the final decision based on the rules.
---
Because of the new DLC, we have gotten a lot of new people to the subreddit, a lot of new posters, and with that, a lot of repetition. Our efforts are done to keep the subreddit active and interesting for everyone. The sticky posts are to help create one stop shops for information. Have you ever tried to search on reddit? It's miserable. 
---
I hope you can see things from my perspective a little bit better now, having said that. If you or anyone else have suggestions on how to improve our community please let us know in mod mail!! I would love to create some fun events, talk about the current state of the game, help new players learn the ropes, and just have fun.
---
I appreciate your comments, thank you for reading.
---
I wish they kept the original stalking EW1 sound
---
Speaker of truths right here
---
You guys are getting perks?
---
it sucks to, most of the time I don't want to run those perks but feel like I have to since the handful of games I try different builds turns into a Trapper standing at a hook with all his traps, Wraith standing at a hook cloaked, Hillbilly/Leatherface standing at a hook with his saw revved, Pig crouched at a hook, GhostFace in his shroud around the corner from a hook, Michael holding his EW2 at 99% at the hook...you get the picture. That feasibly only the "meta" survivor perks can counter.
---
The whole point was to have it be that way. In my mind I would like the idea of getting off a gen and having the monster stare right at me and walk away. Kinda like in the movies
---
Leatherface is best killer
---
I'm a time traveler. And yes they finally fixed it. What year is it btw?
---
You know what should have top priority right now, the matchmaking going into a infinite search loop for a host with absolutely no option to cancel it.
---
I literally have to quit my game in order to play it when this happens.
---
I like how they put corn offering
---
I think this is a really good concept that BHVR should incorporate into future killers or maybe this will be a future dlc, but one question, What is the power?
---
This is awesome!! Great work
---
Mods are removing them as they see them.
---
The meme is garbage. What do you want me to do? Lie?
---
This reminds me of one of my first matches. A gf let me and my friend complete the gens and we al teabagged then the other 2 randoms joined in and teabagged as well. Good times
---
lol why ppl gots to be mean to the ice cream boy
---
Oh shit I missed that. Sorry I just joined this sub reddit
---
I’m a rank 1 survivor. If you want to party up PM me
---
rank 2s will literally stare at you on a hook while the killer is carrying someone else on the other side of the map
---
All you had to do was find their door.
---
That’s why I put my twitch name in the chat so I can keep all the hatred to the chat
---
&gt; Then they could adjust the power/duration/etc. of scratch marks as a whole,
---
you said it.
---
Don’t worry. It’s just that he is dumb enough to keep appearing in front of you. Please have fun with the game :). I usually reply them creepy shit like ... yes your thighs are delicioudc🍽
---
Lol
---
Well messaging is half the fun and sometimes I am sad I can’t congratulate a good player... or say stalkery shit to them hehe
---
Yeah, after thinking more about it, disabling gens would be too strong. I have an idea to make it more balance, though.
---
About Don't Stop Me Now, I think it is a lot better to increase the duration. Since it can only block one pallet at a time, by doing so, you can disable one loop, on the other hand, it gives Survivor a chance to choose another loop until when the Perk is up again.
---
Close the chat. Play both sides. Watch some youtubers/streamers, plenty of guides available.
---
PMing you right now
---
Why does he have the apron? Looks dumb.
---
If you're on PC (since PS4 has one of these free), Hag and Cannibal (Leatherface) have the two most used perks of any Killer, with Hag's being Hex: Ruin which makes good skill checks regress generators and greats don't add a bonus (this dramatically slows the Survivor team's progress), and Leatherface's being BBQ &amp; Chili which increases Bloodpoint gain at the end of a match based on how many individual Survivors you hooked at least once, as well as reveals auras of far away Survivors after hooking one. Basically it doubles your Bloodpoint gain and is the absolute most sought after perk in existence.
---
God fuck off with this shit template
---
Plottwist Bubba is the killer
---
Well, well, well, if it ain’t another tired ass Invisible Cunt meme.
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but how does someone be toxic on DBD?
---
Big rip for the hate
---
I downvoted you because you had - 19, and i like clear numbers like 5,10,15,20 etc... I don t know why other downvoted, you didn t say anything wrong :(
---
I dont think they increased chances of it probably just bad luck but what i do if i keep getting bad perks is ill just buy the perk esp if the other perks arent that great and it stops showing up for awhile eventually it gets to level three and it wont show up at all:))
---
Spoilers for Freddy VS Jason
---
It's from Freddy VS Jason. After being pulled into the real world by the final girl (I think), he can be killed as he isn't a dream anymore. He sees a pretty pissed off Jason after attempting to kill him in a dream after getting jealous of his kill count because he was losing his powers as people didn't believe in him anymore, so he resurrected Jason to make people think it was him but it backfired and now he's here. Commence final battle.
---
YES LOL PLEASE
---
Would be nice if they would disable it. Getting DL almost every game now, probably people abusing the bug, as usual
---
His power is still under work. I got a lot of ideas from the feedback here, so I will post a clean version next time.
---
Welcome Home's strong point is that you can skip the closing animation, thus reducing the time needed to check lockers. Leaving lockers open is also independent from the aura, so the Survivors will not know which one is still being highlighted by the ability. It is quite useful when coupling with BBQ, as long as you set up the lockers before hand. Furthermore, you can deny lockers of an area, thus making Survivors coming to this area particularly vulnerable.
---
Wasted Time is quite strong atm, so I have a better and balanced idea.
---
I said "Sans the instant down." As in, she doesn't have the instant down, but she is like a more controllable billy. But getting injured against a good spirit might as well be an instant down without iron will; she'll appear right on top of you via injured grunts.
---
I \*need\* this tbh. Great job.
---
yeah, that has been happening. (And I'm not trying to disagree with everyone). but they dc'd right after I downed them. Yet again though, could have been a coincidence, idk.
---
-18 is a clear number too ;( but yeah idk, guess people thought it was an "attack" on using low graphics when it really wasn't?
---
See, I think the problem is that if they add colorblind auras and scratch marks, sometimes, depending on the colorblindness, can make them a lot easier to track for non colorblind people, giving them a very big advantage over people who don't use it.
---
I still support the idea of colorblind settings, but people will abuse it, so that might be the reason bHVR didnt add it yet.
---
Thanks for the input, this is very helpful!
---
Thanks.
---
10/10
---
Ok thanks, well then the mystery deepens.
---
A lot of the gen rushing swf teams have come out the woodwork this update I swear
---
That's gold
---
It’s just typical DBD stuff. Lag spikes like these come often after new updates.
---
Can someone explain to me how this is a good thing for Freddy in DBD? I want new cosmetics, especially the classic version, as much as the next guy but if Cravens estate owns the US rights and WB owns international rights (which includes Canada where BHVR is) this would only make it harder since two companies are involved as opposed to one.
---
100% serious, I overlook this stuff and it literally just clicked in my mind when you pointed it out
---
What region are you in? I could play some SWF tonight
---
I don’t think you can
---
Just laugh and text by why you mad it's a game you dont have to be mad and than never answer
---
Their arms are incredibly long. Just like in game so nice job
---
Buddy I was running this game on medium with a 750 at 60fps. If you cant handle the game then you likely have some weak hardware that is in dire need of an upgrade.
---
North America
---
Seconding Myers. He’s a blast to play, and he’s a solid killer too.
---
wdym?
---
Whats your psn? Ill add you
---
I’d honestly take this over the Quinten face rework
---
Honestly. Just change the killer BP again for DC's to be equivalent to 3 hooking them and give Survs a bp bonus as well. No one would complain after that.
---
WhErE diD you gET thIS DoG hEr EyEs Are SO liFeLike
---
Would love to see this treatment done to either doc, huntress, or the legion. Good job OP
---
Susie lookin thicc like a bricc, Joey looks like he can rip my ass, Frank needs a hand (literally), and Julie is uh she’s Julie. Overall, im gonna use this as my wallpaper

A more recent experience from SoulCalibur VI just cemented the thick skin to not let the matchmaking get to you. Sometimes it matches you with SWF trolls, SWF that steam roll and throw a gg, or truly clueless people doing solo queue. In SoulCalibur, you would face the highest rank ever as they were the ones mostly on. 
---
That game’s excuse was the low popularity as is the case with fighting games. They’ve done a few things to combat the huge differences in rank for new players, but matchmaking just ends up being like RNG ones from battle royales. In DBD, the devs acknowledged that the matchmaking here was actually an issue and something with popularity. It could just be all the players from the sales or free deals this week making the servers work overtime. 
---
Just like with SoulCalibur, though, it’s beneficial to play in these games as you’ll see what the game’s played like at the highest ceiling. Are survivors baiting you to follow them the whole game? Have they been doing gens in a way where you can’t “3 gen” (having the last 3 gens in the game be close to one another so that you can track and patrol them easier as all that is needed is one to open up the exit gates)? Are they reading your swings so they know when to 360 you?
---
Simple stuff like that is what you’ll start picking up on as killer and survivor. You’ll learn what to do and not to do. Sometimes you just have to learn in these lobbies (especially around like midnight or so when only the tryhards are up). When you get the fundamentals down, start gaining perks to see how you can up your game a little, watch some vids on YouTube (otzdarva is a great person to start with) on how to up your game, etc. Before you know it, you’ll be welcoming these lobbies.
---
What is wrong with you?

I've just posted my take on the Nurse :D
---
Poor killer.
---
bruh
---
I saw! It’s really good OP.
---
And don’t even get me started on ruin
---
*loses game against a spirit with ebony mori* fucking hell. I need to take a break. *Goes on Reddit and sees this*
---
It's already annoying if they open the gate right away when the fifth gen got repaired.  Does this happen on higher rank?
---
Allstate
---
I love the outfit that Nurse has
---
I had someone tell me that prayer beads were really rare and you hardly get them.
---
I believe they were wrong.
---
Imao
---
It is essentially a free party streamer for the round, so its just another +100% of your base bp.
---
endgame and if u start hooking each one after u down them, they escape. a valid strategy i think. with it's own risks that if you are too slow or one of the survivors is amazing, you can lose all the survivors
---
As a killer main, I apologize on behalf of those guys
---
It could have either been, the dedicated servers had a bad connection to them. The tried to play it out, it didnt go well, so they dipped. The other option is just "entitled survivors get downed, think its bs, then baby rage."
---
This should be an automated message to everyone who makes these posts and the post is deleted.
---
While your artwork is great, I don’t think this fits the character. To much flash, not enough immigrant just working to make a living. Looks like a modern day bling rapper and nothing of a dude working to build a life. 
---
1/10 the art is there but the character is not.
---
Thank you!! :)
---
Thank you, you absolute gem!
---
Maybe your ping sucked?
---
Thank you so much !!
---
congrats, have fun with the killer Adept's they're much harder.
---
Hehe Nea killer
---
Mah heARRt Is hangin' here on this hula-
---
Now that i think about it, i was wondering why i couldnt use the emotes.
---
Please censor usernames in the future. Thanks. :)
---
I think they've had those for new killers since, clown, if I remember right.
---
Sorry I'm new but have really enjoyed the game so far. What's blood hunt?
---
If you aren't actually lag switching, you're fine. Worst case scenario someone will investigate the matter and see you just have crap internet.
---
It's [Shawn the Sheep](https://youtu.be/cj_FlzcDwU8)!
---
Sad thing is. It's on both sides. Although the whole "turning the game off so no one gains or loses pips" thing killers do is seriously petty. Tbh though, some survivors think they deserve to win every match. Hint. They're wrong.
---
Actually no, your wrong. I’m not sure who your arguing with but I never said they should be invincible nor unsluggable. I simply stated that it MAY be beneficial if there were a cutoff time which countered killers waiting out the DS timer on slugs. Seriously, where did you get this idea that I said they can’t be slugged?
---
If you read my original comment, it was simply a suggestion. Actually, I was much more concerned with the downvoted comment not getting it’s fair shake as it seemed to get shut down with out reasonable cause and was looking to open the conversation to further discussion. 
---
Actually, the user ducksmatter opened my eyes to why DS is balanced in its current state (I was viewing the situation from the perspective of the survivor being tunneled as opposed to the 3 survivors who gain an additional 60 seconds while the killer would hypothetically camp said slugged survivor). He did this all while remaining rational and respectful, maybe you could learn a thing or two from him.
---
You make a lot of assumptions of my character based on a loosely held opinion of mine (emphasis on held). I’m not sure who you think I am, but I can assure you that I’m not the evil survivor main your making me out to be.
---
Can the game just flat out say "You won't rank up or get as many bloodpoints if you camp"? Holy crap the amount of camping 19s/20s is getting ridiculous
---
kindred trumps all forms of stealth within its range
---
I uh um ...
---
oh alright I was afraid they massacred my poor boy
---
Except Myers tier 1.
---
Is that still working nowadays? Not to doubt you since I saw that build from Jendenise but with the amount of bugs each new patch introduces I have no idea what functions or doesn't.
---
Thank you for your empathy from my picture &lt;3
---
With overly altruistic survivors, it's easy to get hit with DS even when you're intentionally not "tunneling" (I think that word is stupid, honestly, and is applied FAR too broadly). If a survivor is foolish enough to unhook right in front of me, I don't give a flying fuck if I down the unhooked person too. I typically down them both.
---
My point is the stun and the feeling of DS is annoying, like you've done something wrong when all you've done is try and complete your objective as killer.
---
You can't deny that it's satisfying to down and kill someone who has DSed you. That was my point.
---
People with TTV in their name are more likely to get bullied as the killer, tunneled, camped, sandbagged, and moried
---
Another brilliant picture, I'm loving these. The putting on strong face really shows. Fantastic job again mate.
---
I like this. The crooked smile is apprehensive like she doesn’t know how the asylum will affect her. This pretty lil’ thing is shortly going to choke out a patient. She doesn’t know yet murder. It’s in her blood.
---
I feel like they could be villains from Hunter X Hunter, apart of the Phantom Troupe, no? 😁
---
Free kindered and bond
---
I saw it from some guy named Aaron on YouTube I think. And yeah, somehow it still works. I tested it in KYF about a week ago and you can almost always out-vault the killer lunge if they aren't right on you.
---
I have seen someone type her sitting on someone’s face with her ass would be her mori
---
No they are not . Being gay is a good thing .
---
nope! it would still be full price
---
no
---
Change your interact button to circle. It's saved my butt many times
---
Anyone hear whistling?
---
Take off sloppy for pop and whispers for thrilling tremors. G E N P R O T E C T O R
---
How is spirit in a match with demo and hag??
---
Damn that's annoying.
---
He probably didn't notice you unhook yourself and was celebrating too early. I will admit that I did that when I first started playing.
---
They could put symbols over auras.
---
When Michael stalked one of the survivors for too long this played to make the survivor aware that they are being stalked. They deleted it later, because it defeated the whole purpose of being stealthy.
---
I just added a second link to my original post, it will take you to the wiki page to explain it!
---
Anyonr challenges just change on their oen it gets really annoying once I do it and I dont get my bloodpoints
---
What a cutie
---
Added that wiki link to my original post :-)
---
Don’t think I don’t see you there in the corner billy you can’t fool me
---
The details look great! Truly lovely work!
---
Also just realized you did the Wraith portrait. Keep up the amazing work! ^^
---
I feel like it has something to do with the match making changes.
---
Awesome thanks. I really don't know why i had a brain fart and completely forgot I could look it up... I'm dumb lol
---
Ive healed someone by myself to one full health state and i did not get my second wind, little frustrating lol
---
Lol it’s okay.
---
Ghost Face looks so precious ^^
---
No, the Survivors can see which lockers are open. However, you can spam this Perk to open all Lockers. The highlighted aura is only for the last 2/3/4 Lockers, but the Survivors cannot know which locker is being highlighted.
---
By using this Perk to open all Lockers in a small area, you can monitor that area from using Lockers. That's how you can deny their usage. Either the Survivors have to enter the Locker to close them, which then alert the Killer, or avoid Lockers in general.
---
Anyhow, the Perk is being reworked. I have a better idea for this.
---
Streamer: *dies* 
---
Streamer: gGeZ sTrEaM-sNiPeR
---
*Sweats in Bungie*
---
I wouldn't recommend that anyway unless you are a full on killer player
---
Rank reset is the only time trapper is honestly useful
---
Depends how much time is left on the timer. 
---
If it’s over hallways gone I’m out. No chance I’m staying
---
Ah don t worry, People forgot how downvote is meant to be used, but here have a upvote for this comment, i can t reverse downvote from your first comment, but i will upvote this and If you comment my comment i upvote and then that - 1 karma i gave you will be +2 so you will be in plus. It was nice doing karma bisness with you.
---
But the thing is my wifi just started being like that, so it is a bit sus. I think it's because the bill may or may not have been payed but if it starts working right again wouldn't they think something's wrong?
---
I just killed a rank 6, 8, 12 and 20 SWF with Demo lol. He is pretty good in my opinion. Love him
---
Yeaahh fucking Primus!
---
I play a nice mix of both and eventually want Nancy and Steve but am primarily a killer player. Only reason I ask if because I sold bunch of cheap items from my steam inventory because I wanted a cleanout and I got $6aud worth. But I'll just wait until I get paid now and put that $6 towards the chapter DLC
---
Dang
---
I slay with clown. If I'm gonna get looped I'm gonna make sure they can't see while they do it.
---
I'm getting the reverse. Rank 11 solo survivor only get rank 20 free week players vs rank 10+ killers running Ruin. 
---
I thought playing solo survivor normally was demoralizing but fuck sake I almost just want to quit the game once and for all at this point. I'm not even mad I'm just depressed. I can't run the killer for 20 minutes because then my teammates don't know what ruin is or can't find it and can't hit skillchecks. I can't do gens because my teammates go down in less than 10 seconds.
---
I literally just left a game where my fresh teammate went down to huntress in 20 seconds and then disconnected. I proceeded to do an entire gen solo, run the killer for 6 minutes straight, eventually break away long enough to kill Ruin, run the killer for another 5 minutes, accidentally run towards another fresh teammate, watch them go down in 10 seconds, watch them get hooked and kill self on hook, get downed myself because of lag warp, get hooked and insta-die despite the game displaying I still had a live, 4th teammate. I'm just tired and split between the opinion that people running Ruin during free week has to be one of the scummiest things you can do and grateful that killers are gatekeeping more shitty new survivors from wanting to play the game.
---
I’ve dropped BBQ for Pop Goes The Weasel and I’m liking it a lot more honestly.
---
this isnt a shitpost. constructive criticism, pls, treat it as such or i will report you to the mods. if you want to use memes use the hex memes mode.
---
you just got a new follower
---
The one's that DC'd after being downed were definitely intentional. They have decent perks, but they could also just be low rankers. Looking at their names, specifically the one with the racial slur in it, they appear to be a toxic group.
---
Just to let you know though you should black out names next time you post a screenshot, it's considered witch hunting and against the rules.
---
I bought the pig chapter and she came with the offering haha
---
I genuinely can’t tell if you’re serious or if I’m be r/whooshed right now, by as far as constructive criticism goes, good players will just bang out gens and leave as soon as they know you’re insidious camping a basement hook, especially a SWF that’s coordinating
---
i own swfs all the time, they hook dive becausei  get looped for 4 gens and they all think im  bad but its all part of my plan to get them to hook dive
---
Selfish baby survivor.
---
I honestly have never seen the doc pic until today, I'm mostly on mobile. I had to hop on a computer to even understand how crazy the bloody doc flair works.
---
Territorial Imperative has a requirement that you be AWAY from the basement in order for it to work, specifically to try and prevent from using this type of build. Smart survivors will realize what you’re doing, especially since you’re playing Bubba. They expect it. You’ll get gen rushed
---
yeah, probably. And sorry, I had no idea about the witch hunting rule. I'll make sure to black the names out and thanks for the warning! :)
---
Thanks! I made one with the demon skin taking a selfie too! uwu
---
Yeah the key words were “good players” not brainlets that managed to claw their way out of rank 20
---
People really hate that Legion adds another non-interactive 'hold one button for - seconds" mechanic.
---
No reason. People are just toxic. You gotta learn to ignore it if you don't want to go insane lol
---
All the ones I met are 4 swf double insta heal/BNP so.
---
i legion that trash? should i use a better killer?
---
lol haha no, theres no such thing as a good survivor main.
---
doesnt matter, they hook dive and die to noed, why are you survivor mains so dumb, READ, use your EYES
---
You realize the exit gates can be blocked until you die, right?
---
You’re an idiot if you gamble with Blood Warden
---
First time on Reddit?
---
There was one that was on the app store that was a bigger rip off with a super similar name to Dead by Daylight. I don't remember much cuz this was months ago. I guess it got taken down.
---
I shudder to see the trapper
---
Ok I need answers. You’ve gotta be shit posting, right? Because this is a hauntingly convincing Rank 20 killer impression, but my bullshit detector is saying you’re shit posting
---
use Whoever is fun for you
---
That hair tho I just can't
---
No problem. Figured you weren't aware of it since you're not coming across as provoking or anything.
---
Please let this be the start of a Parks and Rec/DbD meme renaissance.
---
Dude on a double DC, show some mercy my man. It is so infuriating when a killer shows no mercy on a double dc
---
I'm too nice to intentionally go after the person who just gets unhooked unless they're a huge threat.
---
im rank 11. i was in purple ranks before rank reset. im not rank 20 you stupid fucking retard. i dont know what you think my build is, but its not a rank 20 build. if it was i would be a rank 20. im a rank 11. and i was rank 8 before the reset. 8 ranks away from rank 1. let that sink in.
---
Hey if it works and it's fun go for it. It's a yes from me.
---
I even get that shit on Xbox like my laptop isn't in the other room or that I just pulled the stream up on my phone
---
That's not mass, it's sass.

This happens to me on xbox one, DBD tweeted the other day that they're working on this issue but i hate it. Im rank 15 killer and they put me with red rank survivors and one green rank. Guess they think the green rank levels it all out 😑
---
*The exit gate + 3 generators.
---
If I were the killer she would've gotten premium treatment. Instant evacuation of hook, elongated chases (bp xoxo), and the hatch.
---
It would be if she suffocated them to death with her thicc ass
---
As a pink hair Nea, that's fair.
---
its bugged. Has been since tuesday. Widely talked about. Well know. Hotfix is coming.
---
I wish they kept it though, it’s so scary, even worse than him actually grabbing you
---
It use to be a staple way back when. having that extra time to get away from a gen before the killer showed up was a godsend.
---
Thank you. That's honestly the dream of a TTV survivor
---
Yeah, not slugging. ESPECIALLY not for a one use perk, that has a timer to be used or be gone the whole match, that also only activates once you're unhooked. Don't see killer perks going through that many hoops to work.
---
As a TTVer, ppl want flame me before I wan to flame them.
---
And?  I'd rather have some people switching colour palettes to play 'optimally' rather than have some people barely able to play at all.
---
Works out okay if you get the stun, slide across the pallet and tea bag.
---
Could've put NOED
---
Without seeing actual gameplay, there's no way to really explain it. 
---
But with Legion, 9 times out of 10, most players STILL don't know how to play against him/her and will take that out on you. I don't think I've played against one that wasn't running discordance and  my teammates always jump on my gen and wonder why he's coming towards us. That and like Ghostface Halloween Mask, most Legion killers are just really bad with him and will likely camp the entire match. 
---
Again, without seeing footage, I can't explain it.
---
Lmao. Try playing prayer beads Spirit and watch how much the hate increases. Survivors just think the killer is being toxic if the killer outplays them. Take their insults as a badge of victory lol
---
Wait what happened

The demogorgon has 5 mouth flaps. Not 6 :/
---
I don't know this, I dont mind this. I like it though.
---
i usually roam but if i put someone in a hook there's a 100% chance that ppl will go save them so sometimes i juke their FOV if i see them far a way and wait for another easy kill and at this rank maybe im playing with not so good ppl and i down them fast.
---
Haha, this is why I run Calm Spirit. :)
---
That and my ears bleed if I don't have it when I get hooked.
---
thanks! i will see it this way onward
---
Plauge
---
I think this should be a shitpost. 
---
If this is how you always play,  you're garbage. People always wanna blame "ToXiC sWf" for their shitty game play. When all reality you're a salty little shit who gets mad when people actually save their team mates. Body blocking hooks is in the game, it gets you points. Flash lighting gets you points, it's in the game. I would t bag you as well, if you wasted all match face camping. Streamers probably make more money than you,  so I'd say that's a "real" job. Your whole post is literally shit. 
---
So yeah, lololololol. YOU enjoy being toxic,  quit blaming swf or t baggers. T bagging doesn't ruin your game or deny you points,  what you're doing does. You are the problem. But yeah, keep using your build. When you get out of high ranks,  smart survivors will gen rush you and you'll enjoy getting 1 kill per match. Congrats,  on doing nothing to better your skill. Something to be real proud of and want rated,  when it's nothing special all noobs use it. Yawn.
---
I haven't seen many offerings in awhile but, did you get a pale rose. Against sawdettes?
---
Someone's getting sandbagged
---
Michael looking like a chad
---
I havent had any issue.
---
It's too hard to tell, survivors will throw their pussies at you for every reason under the sun.
---
Just keep kicking ass and don't let the cunts get to you.
---
Whoops, thanks for letting me know. I mean, the reference I used almost looked like it had 6
---
Difficult to navigate, and no real place to hide as a survivor. I've never lost on it as killer, too easy to track people.
---
Is that my dad?
---
IT HAS BEEN SUMMONED, BROTHERS
---
Omg xD
---
Hilarious.
---
I feel like the lack of actual decent loops in most areas doesnt help with that, the hallways have absolutely nothing to work with but extremely unsafe pallets, so you either get to one of the ridiculously strong inner rooms with 2 pallets in time or you just die. Kind of RNG based to loop on that map, which sucks.
---
I’m giving this a like because of Scream
---
Watch otz's new ghostface video
---
I've had some really bad games against SWF. Unlucky early game portal placement can be a pain in the end game if you guess the high traffic areas wrong, leaving you with useless portals on the outskirts. That's only a problem if you try to use your portals earlier, but great placement  (if you place the portal a little further than 8 meters from where a survivor may be, ie the generator and away from where they would watch normally) can lead to picking survivors straight off a generator and if there is a second survivor, a possible wound. It can be hit or miss, as the permanent portals are like chance. If you have good portal placement, I will stop mid chase against a fruitless chase to teleport to a generator that I know or suspect has a survivor and attempt sneak attacks.  
---
  
---
That's the one thing that demogorgon has going for it, the ability to use the comfort of the survivor, thinking he's safe since the chase is happening well aways.
---
Yeah me getting derank, at rank 6, by a rank 19, that clearly is facecamping, and saying hey thanks for the asshole move. Thats me being an asshole. Should’ve said “hey man, so glad you camped, deranked me and ruined my experience. Don’t know what I’d do without this game. Thanks!!!”
---
I do the headshake too, but i never hook them if they wiggle too much/bust out. I'm giving them the hatch dammit :V
---
&gt;maybe if they spent less money on cosmetics than maybe it be more playable.
---
Wat
---
What does cosmetics have to do with the issue you are facing? 
---
Also, haven't you see the amount of scoops playing right now? Not only people bought his character (either standalone or the entire DLC) but also his cosmetic, which isn't cheap. BHVR is definitively making more money than "spending". Money which will be used to pay for servers. 
---
I never understand these ignorant mentions to cosmetics. 
---
Regarding merging the SWF, perhaps they will tweak it in the future but this change is definitely for the better. Personally I have multiple friends that instantly came back to DBD after hearing the inviting was gone.
---
It’s petty
---
I have great internet for most games, but on dbd im lucky to get 150 ping. Sucks to be called a lagswitcher because i literally have the best internet for where i live. I cant even get ethernet because it will cost 200$ to get installed
---
Yeah. I used a Pig Splinter and bought the pig after that game. I liked playing her...
---
Please.... please be kind to us baby killers. We’re trying our best 😭 
---
Pretty sure I had two swf groups tonight and both were so nice. I hadn’t hooked anyone and there were maybe 1-2 gens left so I just started meme’ing. One group stayed when I refused to kill them and let the entity get them when the timer ran out. The other just let me chase them and would come find me if I lost them. 
---
We’re trying, ok.... one day we’ll be good. Maybe.
---
They’ve had three years though.
---
Not for the better if it’s constant connection issues even when my internet is stable, and good for them happy they can enjoy the game, it just be nice that some of this stuff was acknowledged.
---
Freddy is a very formidable killer, ESPECIALLY in lower ranks. I’d say invest some time and points in him if you like the gameplay
---
I don't have Freddy I used Smoking Splinter
---
Well thats very nice of you haha. I always try to be nice to the last survivor if the game just doesnt go their way. Ive just had a few survivors wiggle out then run the opposite way of the hatch and I'm just like... Well.
---
Halloween 3 is an okay horror movie. It's better than some of the later Myers movies. I always say if it was a standalone horror, it wouldn't be so hated...but yeah. No Myers...which is what you're there for when watching Halloween...
---
Welcome to the true DBD experience.
---
wraith has godly map control, dafuq u on about?
---
Right when it became good...
---
this is so succinct i love it
---
try running Inner Strength.
---
Imcowz is Probably waiting for the new technique
---
&gt;They’ve had three years though. Not for the better if it’s constant connection issues even when my internet is stable, and good for them happy they can enjoy the game, it just be nice that some of this stuff was acknowledged.
---
They had three years, so what? Its finally here, thats what it matters. People complained because we didn't have the feature and now that we have, people will continue to complain because it didn't happen sooner?
---
I am happy with the change, it works and I haven't had the issue you are reporting nor did my friends when they went to play solo. This probably means the issue isn't affecting everyone so tracking the cause and fixing it might not be that easy.
---
&gt;To be fair, you ignored them when you purchased the game without checking if it's suitable for you.
---
Its not ignoring if it isn't there in the first place. As far as I'm aware Behavior has only mentioned this issue in forums, and only as responses to questions. 
---
This isn't the ESRB rating, unless OP goes scouting for it, he'd never know the game doesn't have colorblind settings, which he'd have no reason to because the majority of multiplayer games have colorblind settings and that information is not included on the box or steam page, regardless of whether or not its there.
---
It's largely because putting it in your name gives off an air of desperation. Sure, all streamers want to grow and most of them cherish every new viewer. One issue is that confidence is a major part of being entertaining and desperation is never helpful.  
---
On top of that, it doesn't even show commitment to wanting to grow. Putting in your name also feels like a fire and forget way of hoping for views. There are people who also ask nicely in post game chat for you to check out their stream. Those people tend to get far more respect partially because they're putting an active effort in each game. This also shows that they are willing to put themselves out there knowing full well that some folks will be terrible enough to make fun of them and put them down for it. So going out and asking for viewers shows another level of confidence.
---
Increased movement speed, small terror radius, and you more or less know where everyone and it will only be D-tier? Even Old Freddy didn't have that much information.
---
Except it is.
---
I feel like if they didnt attach the "Halloween" name to it, as well as making it the third installment, it would've probably gotten more
---
They could’ve kept SWF but added the no need to invite every single time. Well maybe if they had better customer service then maybe they could maybe track it? If it was least acknowledged I’d feel better.
---
screenshot of your killer rank?
---
Nope just the party chat system with your friends u less you invite the randoms
---
Eh. That's fair. I was there for the fight. And honestly it was pretty solid.
---
Why is billy so low?
---

---
Ah, a man of culture
---
IMO inner strength is way more beneficial then the self care, cleansing totems so no NOED, takes about 10 seconds, could be used to heal and avoid killer aura reading perks
---
We do have that one valentine’s day skin where the only face covering she has is that blindfold tho
---
lol then don't suck 4head! It's that easy!!
---
I had that happen twice last night, where the radius got so intense, I thought the nurse was about to blink on me and fell through the floor only to land right in front of her. I'd definitely be up for having it muffled so it's there, but not so dominant.
---
I am guessing it is both positive/negative since if  Wes Craven's Estate plays nice they can add everything from the classic Elm Street franchise (anything from Classic Freddy to New Nightmare Freddy) however this could end up a bloody mess like what had happen to the Friday the 13th licence which is now in court room purgatory in which case Freddy will probably cease to make cameos in places like DBD and Mortal Kombat.

Thank you, I don’t know why I don’t remember them. 
---
Were they always fully tinted so you couldn’t see her eyes at all?
---
Because you didn’t buy the dlc duh you’re legally obligated to only play new dlc killers for at least 2 weeks after they come out
---
As you can see, the Ruin getting cleansed scared the everliving shit out of me lol
---
Against bad survivors? Yes, you'll be able to M1 them pretty fast.
---
Against anybody who knows how to loop... well, you're an M1 killer with 115% speed and no other bonuses.
---
It's totally feasable that you'll get looped for 3 gens.
---
With Tinkerer and Franks+Study, you can bring back some of old Legion's bullshit anti-skill. If survivors get a gen done mid chase, you get a free down.
---
How goes the fight against Sangvis Scum?

Better be careful, they are still logging data for people who do this glitch and will be banned per the devs at BhVR...

On the other side it's very gratifying to out play the killer and be so toxic you make the killer DC.
---
I don’t know if it’s the same on console, but on pc if the killer pulls their internet to dc it won’t give you survival/escape points.
---
If the killer force DCs like unplugs router everyone loses items, offerings, bloodpoints meanwhile if they just quit survivors get to keep everything.
---
It said he disconnected,  but it's been saying that killers do when they don't because it has been glitchy. So I don't know if that was the case. Would be pretty shitty if that's what he did,  but it shouldn't of effected me. I ran straight out,  two other team mates did stay to t bag but I left and it took forever to load back and then gave me more survival points.
---
My chairs started levitating when I read that aloud.
---
Survive with friends
---
I ran straight out as the doors opened,  because he didn't do anything toxic for me to even think about taunting him so I wouldn't think it would of effected me. Unless he did it as soon as we opened the door.
---
What are you taking about? That knife CLEARLY connected, maybe you just saw it wrong
---
But that would make sense since I did lose my key. That fucking suuuucks.
---
Lol. Frame by frame, the top of my head is lower than the catwalk when it 'connects' :(
---
Ethernet cables are cheap
---
if they could actually get robert to voice freddy like they got bruce for ash that would be so sick
---
Because it is rotated
---
That's not nice maybe their new players
---
Happens on console too
---
It's a bug. It has caused me to lose about 10 chases earlier just because I couldn't swing to hit a survivor.
---
I’m a low ranking killer (generally sitting at rank 14) and I keep getting matched up with purple ranking survivors. Yeah.. I get humiliated.
---
She is the 2nd best killer in the game amigo
---
Learn some grammar
---
Yeah, but complain about something in this community and they just going to whine at you. I don’t get it man but I totally agree with you
---
Literally ive ran into killers who have had trash internet and have had people dc bc they couldent connect lol
---
I got into a game with 3 day 1 newbs all rank 20. What’s funny is that the killer doesn’t see all the ranks. And yet he just somehow knew that I was the one he should tunnel all game.  Still 0 gens completed by the time I was dead though.
---
We’ll have to disagree, I just don’t think so from my experience
---
Yeah. Guess people dont know that little tidbit of the word's past
---
Or "The Werewolf"
---
I can understand that lol.
---
But it makes no sense in the context of the sentence
---
Then who is? A good spirit can just say no to pallets and beats any survivor, cant loop a good spirit: source 2700 hours at rank 1
---
For some reason when playing demogorgon, the framerate drops dramatically to the point where the game stutters and playing with the new killer becomes a truly arduous and unfun experience. This is especially true when playing on the new map "Underground Complex" as well as the Badham maps. This does not occur when playing other killers on these or any other maps, however, i have noticed this problem only significantly with the Demogorgon on the aforementioned maps.
---
You shouldn't get downvoted for your opinion.
---
Hello Joke Police
---
Which add on would it use if you do the secondary action?
---
Any good player can do that tho, #1’s are Nurse and Billy.
---
Unless the Killer was chasing or about to hook you it was probably another survivor. The Killer isn’t going to sweat a random DC.
---
Its reddit. I’m used to it.
---
The first hook is usually the most important because that's when all 4 survivors tend to be on a gen. Ruin and Whispers are big for this, because a) the time you take to find a survivor is shorter and b) the time it takes for the survivors to pop gens is longer. Other perks that can be useful are Corrupt Intervention and Discordance. 
---
Usually there will be at least 2 survivors who spawn together (never use Shroud of Separation) so if you find the gen with multiple people on it, you've already got an advantage. Otherwise, when you're chasing a survivor, find time to take a look around every once in a while to see if there are other survivors around the area. If you see easier targets, it's usually wise to break off your original chase and go for the low hanging fruit.
---
Basically, to stall gen progress, make survivors prioritise secondary objectives - going for a save, cleansing hexes, and healing. 
---

Didn’t it used to be 3 gens, the hatch spawns and can be opened? I know they changed some stuff for the EGC but I don’t think they changed that. I could 100% be wrong, since I was on hiatus when the changes were rolled out.

that doesn't really matter when you are in chase, since with OoO he won't be able to play any mindgames cause you can just see him, so he has to just run through the loop

Ghostface's bar goes down because you left stealth. Legion's goes down if you miss a hit on a survivor.
---
I hadn’t played on PlayStation for quite some time and went back last month. It hasn’t been the same since it was added to PS+ sadly and will probably not play there much moving forward. I stopped getting DLC for it before ASh released.
---
What console do you play on?
---
It's just a Nerf so they can't hit and use their power consecutively. Just something to slow the game down a bit to not overwhelm survivors.
---
mmm glue
---
Wait, what console are you playing on that you need to press and hold the dpad to run? My dpad settings are up to point, down to motion "come here". Did you maybe mess something up in your settings?

PS4
---
It's not optimized well for PC either. But I've found it's the most stable platform followed by Xbox One X and then PS4 Pro. The base consoles were really bad before they started optimizing with Xbox One being the worst. 
---
They are constantly working to improve performance though. You should send their support a message or post at the official forum about it. While they do post and read comments here, that is where they are most active.
---
Pc or counsel
---
honestly trappers traps are a mixed bag. on one hand, if you manage to hide them in surprising spots you can get the people in traps. on the other hand, if theyre putting so much pressure on gens you dont even get to place traps.

---
I see you're very knowledgeable lore-wise. This is really interesting to look at
---
This is really well crafted. Good job, you should make comissions or something, I'm sure people would love to have similar necklaces for all assasins.
---
You loop them on the wrong side
---
And I don’t get how anyone could think that indoor maps are killer sided. They all are one big infinites if you have balanced landing and know where you’re going.
---
Lery’s is a windowtown. You can run around the map diagonally and the killer will never catch you.
---
The Game has 8 godpallets, many drops for Balanced Landing, many corners and places that change the light level for scratchmark jukes and the safest areas around the gates in the game
---
The new map has a fucktone of pallets, drops for Balanced Landing, some of the safest areas in the game and the best gen to leave for last, that’s so safe you’ll see the killer is comming before you hear their terror radius and have 4 options to run
---
All they share is that they turn potato survivors into mashed potatos. Those maps are survivor sided IF the survivor knows how to play them, but most people are like “yea fuck those maps” and don’t even put a single thought into them
---
What's the deal with pink hair Bea?
---
I play on PS4 and use L1 to sprint
---
I've been having weird games. when i play with my friends we get 15 or lower killers. I play by myself? I get me (rank 7) two other rank 7s, then a rank 2, and a rank 7 killer (or close to it). They messed up matchmaking for the swf lobby but its broken half the time. we go back to the lobby and someones having a "server issue, some social features not avaliable" and need to restart the game. or we just get booted back to our one man lobby going wtf just happened. then theres a weird bug where we go back to the lobby, we see everyone but one guy goes "where's everyone else" because he can't see us even though we see him in the lobby. wtf is going on
---
Pc?
---
true^^
---
Camaraderie is bad, but I guess Kindred could be used with it, to get more value out of the latter.
---
Babysitter is also bad, but Distortion makes for a neat combo (if that actually works - it should but I did not test it).
---
Second Wind is good, and perks to go with it would be stuff like Empathy, Bond, Aftercare, We'll Make It, Autodidact, ... i. e. stuff that helps you heal other survivors. Sprint Burst and Dead Hard are good with it, to have some means to prevent being farmed off the hook, so that you may get into a chase during which SW then heals you.
---
It has been varying in how often it's broken for me. I've asked about this before and I was told that the devs aren't putting this as a high priority because it's only the minority of people who are getting the glitch. Maybe we should get anybody who has the glitch to report it on the DBD forums so that it is a higher priority for the devs once they see how big a problem it is.
---
Just because he is fast doesn't mean he has map control. He is probably the easiest killer in the game to loop just because of him not having a power that helps in a chase.
---
Thats great and all, but looping is superior.
---
I noticed now that BHVR always pretends to not see any bug we've mentioned. Not the exit gate bug, not the shitty looking hair issue, not the demo portal highlight, and definitely not these.
---
They only address things they can easily band-aid. 
---
As a  relatively new player, their attitude and lack of communication are very disappointing.
---
Yeah, you have increased movement speed so looping is irrelevant. Try looping a killer that has one stack of Play With Your Food, it is a lot harder and it is only a 5% difference.
---
It was a stream although I can't tell you which one - I believe it was somewhere around 1.5 years ago. But the thing you have to remember is bhvr were criticised for presenting some stats in a misleading way. The specific example I remember was actually the perk pick rate because on the surface Self-Care having somewhere around 20% pick rate seemed low. But the way the stat was presented was frequency of appearance - and since you can only equip 4 perks and only 1 SC, 25% would mean everyone was running SC.
---
Ding ding ding. Meeting will now come to order.
---
I main Freddy so I would never want him to go however I have seen full triple A games delisted for stuff as simple as loosing the rights to a song or two on their soundtrack.
---
Seriously this or add more secrets.
---
Seriously it's not difficult to know what's going to happen when you see a secret on the offering screen.
---
Yeah, I guess, but thats logic only applies to Perks, not to SWF ratings :b
---
Yes and it’s a one person gen too
---
Personally I think frenzy is more of a handicap as you need to hit tour target for it to work. As long as you don’t feed legion and avoid his strike, he’s easy to play against him. 
---
With that being said it’s still a great way to break up gen repairs at the start of the match depending on where survivors spawn and if they know it’s you. 
---
But, as I said, even knowing it’s you ... most players still ignore discordance which brings you right to them.
---
That's what's called a pro gamer move.
---
But chase potential is different from map pressure. Hillbilly, for example, has good map pressure.
---
I'm not denying Wraith sucks in chases.
---
I really hope I find the hex totem soon irl
---
so you’re complaining about a control YOU set?
---
i actually had the same thing happen lol. i didn’t even make the connection to me being colorblind, so i just thought i was dumb.
---
Unless you’re laughing in Enduring also we’re off to the next loop
---
this power would need to be coupled with something else. also what about instead of a teleport, lockers make him invisible. this way he can search areas before deciding where to go, at the cost of speed. it would be pretty unique
---
*seriously*
---
so people can complain about hitbox bugs, but I made a post asking if somebody experienced the same bug I did and got deleted? 🤔
---
I'm pretty sure everyone knows that well besides a few but it's good to do a PSA  on survivor behavior and what means what, I usually try to make sure they're implying they want death by wacking the hook and nodding.

Good manners. Killer was clearly in your way.
---
If I see someone randomly dc while they're on a gen or aren't even being chased and nothing crazy is happening in the match I assume their internet farted.
---
His power helps in a chase. This alone brings him upto huntress tier. Have you tried the killer shack loop with the demigorgan?
---
On top of that he has a secondary power, you can place them near hooks, gens and exit doors. It takes time to destroy the portals, and you are alerted. Great for pressuring them.
---
All in all a very effective killer indeed.
---
What program is that? I've been trying to find it ever since I've seen people "Potatoe-fied" their games, but no one ever said what the program was.
---
those survivors abusing pallet stun….
---
Thats badass

How do you do this?

Are you using Dying Light? I heard that's been crashing the game since the update.

And lose your hand in the process xD

Honestly? I kind of imagine her being cute. Look at her! She has a little pixie woman build

I feel horrible for her. Moreso than any other killer

I was in alexisplaying's chat when this happened. He was the killer and was very confused lmao

Nah sorry, I have other priorities for now
---
Steve should be the most sexual character in the game change my mind

You are correct on the speed part. It gives you sprint burst when all the generators are powered.
---
Watch out man your privilege is showing
---
Great now I vaguely want that.  Fuck me right?
---
I just wanna *see* it man.
---
But how can they delist it if people paid for the character? Sounds like a big chance of getting sued. And if they have "compensations" like 100k Iridecent shards it probably won't matter, it's not what the consumer paid for.
---
Imma check it out
---
r/whoosh?

I had a game where I played demogorgon and as I hit a character they just disappeared. Still showed them in game, I spent time looking for them to find out at the end that they dced but still showed them in game. Feel bad killer moments

I had a baby once, as Michael Myers. The other 3 were actually pretty good. I had stalked out Dwight to the max and managed to hook him, then the other 2 went for the rescue and I had EW2 at 99% 3K game. The first one escaped.
---
TBF, they can still be SWF. When I play 4-man swf 3 of us always load in instantly but one needs like almost a minute longer to appear in the lobby.
---
Mine crashed too when I played as Freddy on PS4 but that's mainly because of Dying Light.
---
If u get that then Freddy gets 
---
“ Welcome to my world bitch”
---
I'll usually do that if someone dcs or kills themselves. Mostly because if I just kill the rest too fast, I get shit points and so do they. It's better when everyone leaves with tons of points.
---
No im just laughing at things like people leaving swf groub lobbies idc who im playing with but nobody has escaped me in ages

Perks are meant to be used to help you.
---
Oh boy just wait till you get higher in rank :)
---
It's something you don't even have to think about. You normally hook survivors to begin. I wish WGLF worked the same way. At least give you the killers aura when you unhook someone.
---
U have 24 ping killer is host so he has 0-1 ping 😋

I have to vote for my main. SPIRIT she a bad bitch, Iv gotten 12-13 perfect games with her (8K bloodpoints in all 4 categories &amp; a 4 kill) plus its extremely satisfying to gen grab. “Gotcha Bitch”
---
*queue the accordion*
---
Eeeeeverything you know is wrong: Black is white, up is down, and short is long. And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter
---
It's a shame that you can't equip 3 Moris
---
Still, don't worry about it. Just wait for dedicated survivors like me and the other wifi gamers :)
---
No
---
Look's cute :)
---
If you looped a killer for 5 gens, what else do you expect him to do? He has nowhere else to go which would be generators to patrol. The game is over and people trying to rescue you is the next objective he must defend. 
---
If he is playing smart, he will use your hooked body to bait rescuers but without going too far. 
---
If he is just salty, he will just sit in front of your hook and this isn't wrong either because he has nowhere else to go.
---
I believe it goes weapon body face if I remember correct for P1, P2, P3 respectively but I could be wrong.

" After ending the Repair action, the Survivor is afflicted by the ***Exhausted*** **Status Effect** for **1**/**2**/**3** second(s). "
---
This gives SB on demand. Stopping exhaustion recovery is super situational and not so useful.
---
I'm also new to the game, but I think you should go for the Pig. You'll get the hang of it quite easily. + if you're playing as survivor IT'S SO ANNOYING OMG
---
They downvoted him because he told the truth
---
Jason would definetly be possiple but I don't think Chucky will be added. You wouldnt even be able to see him in the grass because how small he would be.
---
Theres only one ttv ill ever tunnel or mori, and im not saying his name for privacy reasons. Other than that, couldn't give a toss
---
or you go straight for the Stranger Things DLC and get that white demon thingy (I keep forgetting the name xD)
---
Someone having ttv in their name when I'm killer  makes no difference for me I'll just play like how I would regularly do, although I like watching the game back on their twitch page to see what the game was like from their POV
---
Ahh a fellow Scottish player.
---
Great play by the way.
---
Learn to look behind you when running away it gives alot of information and saves alot of useless pallet deops
---
&gt;" After ending the Repair action, the Survivor is afflicted by the Exhausted Status Effect for 1/2/3 second(s). "
---
&gt;This gives SB on demand. Stopping exhaustion recovery is super situational and not so useful.
---
As an occasional SB user who doesn't walk everywhere to save, it isn't "super situational". You will find yourself working on generators while exhausted more often than not.
---
Ugly, useless, higly overrated, and emo?
---
Oh yea I forgot to ask as well, should I buy the  Dead by Daylight - Stranger Things Edition or just the standalone game?
---
when you want to try a dlc caracter out and use an offering just to see people dc because they think you have a mori
---
This is awesome, please do more!
---
Uhm, so what you are saying is that in theory I could use up my sprint burst, press M1 on a gen for 0.1 seconds and then wait 3 seconds and voila my sprint burst is off cooldown again?
---
I need to test it. I knew about this build but I think they fixed it, maybe not, would be nice of it still works
---
Well the spirit is a dead body.....
---
I mean, Dead by daylight is such a competitive game streaming wise, you need to stand out with TTV if you want any traffic to your stream
---
In one match there was a Legion who basically just stood there guarding his hex totem and didn't even try to stop my teammates and I from doing gens. It was hilarious since I've never seen a killer do that before.
---
Bet you hate him more than he hates gay implying he actually hates them.
---
Im saying hes top 3 faxxot
---
Can't wait for Hag.
---
If you main Steve, killers won't want to sacrifice you.  Unless you wear this cosmetic combination.  Then you'll get tunneled.
---
That he should have hooked first, closed second.
---
It’s......a look....
---
I don't think Demogorgons counts as furries.
---
So true, so painful.
---
See that I can totally understand, I’m not a fan of seeing survivors scumbag other survivors myself so I always make the effort to be more harsh on those people (unless I know it’s a swf and they’re probably just messing around with each other.)
---
True enough.  There have been some vague copycats.. And the nearest one seems to be identity V for mobile...   But we haven't had a copycat to the extremes that LoL copied DotA yet.
---
Oh, thanks. Anyway, that's nice, this license holder change means we could actually get that coat.
---
I have a friend who has her TTV set as her name and she refuses to change it. It's impossible to play with her or watch her play, because the killer is always stream sniping or the killer is always tunneling her or the killer is bullying her or the killer is going try-hard on her or the killer is lag switching. My favorite is when she claimed the killer hacked her game to switch up her controls. ....I wish I was joking but I'm not. :c
---
Almost done with season 2, so excited to get to season 3
---
Same
---
As much as I hate fortnite, I’d love some better gestures in the game.. let us choose between 4 or 5 different ones. Dancing ones, clapping hands, raising the roof, etc. yes they’d be abused by the toxic people but that’d make the game so much more entertaining than just pointing..
---
Clown is decent. His map control is what sucks.
---
It happens occasionally, but I don't think it's purely Dying Light. I've crashed using other perks.
---
I don’t play often as killer but whenever I do I get people calling me a noob and gg ez stuff. Turds.
---
Sounds funny but probably gets irritating really soon. Moring the TTVs is pretty much a meme at this point and she should know that.
---
I went from rank 3 to rank 1 tonight thanks to matchmaking putting me against rank 14-18 all night.. I got the achievement! But at the poor baby killer’s cost..! :( I’m sorry
---
I'd be down with extended stealth out of teleport, auto detection of Survivors, or indestructible portals.
---
You're gay.
---
Ooh I love it!! You're doing a great job, looking forward to seeing more!!
---
There’s a bug with dying light still that’s causing issues, it might be better to avoid the perk for the time being until a patch/hot fix is dropped.
---
Pop is always good on Killers who can travel around quickly.
---
Why do people say they are streamers i dont get it. Whenever i see someone with TTV or YT or whatever i just want to fuck with them more
---
Overcharge working perfectly
---
Jason ain’t possible with all the bullshit lawsuits going on
---
Now imagine having your name jukes for days I ran into someone named that on ps4

That’s absolutely weird. The only time it would have done that if you were the last survivor alive. Doesn’t seem like anything on your fault and rather just some faulty bug.
---
Imagine playing on console.
---
Lol someone has apparently  never used Play With Your Food. It is probably the most inconsistent perk in the game, but when you have 5-10% additional movement speed you can end chases a lot faster even against the best of players, it nothing else you'll  get survivors to drop pallets faster and make dead zones a lot more dangerous if the survivor accidentally runs into one.
---
What did they say?What's with the icon
---
This has to be fake all I ever see is hate messages.
---
The Wraith
---
The Weekend?
---
Please censor usernames next time just in case. Thanks!
---
Looks like a baby meg ;)
---
Yup. That's when you can tell they're lagswitching without a doubt. If you're choppy the whole game, chances are it's their internet (or yours, whichever). If everything is going perfectly fine but the ping tanks when they're losing or specifically in chases, that's a big red flag.
---
Haha nope. I main killer and survivor, but I felt bad for the killer getting bullied so I sent him a little love letter! It was an added bonus he was a new player too, don’t want him thinking our community is all toxic. :)
---
Let me know hiw it goes, i finally did get the perk tonight and tried the surge and surveillance combo. Only tried it one game though and it only worked once as only one person went down within 32m of a gen that was being worked on, but I was able to stop that gen from being done as I knew they were there second they touched it again.
---
Will do! Thank you for letting me know.
---
We need more people like you sir!
---
She's a red head though :P
---
Hence why they are trying to promote with their stream as their name.
---
Not as hard as nurse but kinda feels like playing huntress, you need to have a good aim. I’m doing better than average so far.
---
Meg my ass,that's the Jane's thicc totem
---
I used to be rank 8 but took a break from the game. And no they were not "baby's" they used meta perks only except for claudette and tried to loop me and flashlight click me multiple times.
---
It’s probably your specs
---
&gt; Why are you even trying to denounce the idea of changing colors of scratch marks/auras being a time consuming thing in the first place?
---
I'm more annoyed about these shitty memes I keep seeing that offer no value.
---
It’s been happening to me too. Killers have it worse right now though because they get disconnected mid game and lose blood points
---
Maybe, but I definitely remember him spinning around and looking at all the fire in horror.
---
If you mean the fps drops, new map is pretty smooth on ps4 and there shouldnt be any lag since you are the host. Im really enjoying the new chapter at the moment.
---
&gt;If he was playing smart he wouldve abandoned the chase and went after someone else
---
I was talking exclusively about the situation with zero gens left.
---
Idk if it's just me but pink hair Neas are usually the niciest survivors I face. I'm getting a lot more toxicity from Claudettes, Feng Mins or Aces (they're probably most toxic tbh)
---
Oh cool, thank you &lt;3
---
If it offered no value why did over 3k people upvote it? Unlike you I find value in this post. Hell posts like these are the reason Quentin is likely getting his actor's likeness into the game.
---
You’re welcome! Have fun :D
---
GG nice killer :) just means that you let them escape
---
&gt;Uhm, so what you are saying is that in theory I could use up my sprint burst, press M1 on a gen for 0.1 seconds and then wait 3 seconds and voila my sprint burst is off cooldown again?
---
What he is saying is, you can walk everywhere to not trigger your Sprint Burst. When you start working on a generator, it will give you 3s of exhaustion which means you can start running everywhere, pause for 3s and voila, sprint burst on demand. 
---
He isn't wrong, is just there is more to mindbreaker than this. Not saying the perk is top tier but is also not hot garbage.
---
There is still a tipp that you can grab a surv put of the hatch 🤷‍♀️😅
---
That's not true, freestyle only works in selected titles unless you willingly downgrade your drives and mess with certain ways to get other games working. DbD is supported natively, but not all games are.
---
I approve of this meme, very funny, did indeed laugh
---
People still commonly called Mods that in lots of subreddits.
---
Yup. I also had dying light not too long ago and my game crashed after hooking someone
---
I miss it too why did they remove it
---
This needs a thousand upvotes at least.
---
Why was it taken out?
---
This is the same thing I do. One time I carried a survivor a while without them struggling while looking for the hatch, ran past at least 5 hooks, THEN they started wiggling and wouldn't stop for headshakes, so I hooked them. I got told in the lobby after that I'm reported for trolling. Just wanted to give the hatch, jeez.
---
This is why i hate him.
---
You’re best off just running and trying to dodge line of sight. If I want to reveal him, it usually leads to me needing to force my character to be in a certain position, which often puts me in a bad postion where GF gets a free hit anyway.
---
I’ve played as him before. Reveal feels more consistent there but there are still instances where survivors stare right at you and they cant break you out of stealth.
---
did the killer had NOED?
---
Seen it done but it is rank reset so that’s probably why haha
---
Rin main big brain (no)
---
This is like Debbies Nightmare where Freddy loops Nancy in circles
---
To play devils advocate, the Spirit is ungodly on Hawkins, you have next to no chance of escaping her if the player is even halfway decent... and the Hag, Demogorgon and Nurse are also laughing on Hawkins.
---
I’ve seen the plague and Billy suffer on it. 
---
I’d also be interested to know how the Clown and Trapper go... I feel like the confined spaces and rabbit warren-eque style of the map should work to their advantage in a chase, but I can also see how it could hinder them too. The same for Ghostface and Myers.
---
But we already know how she was looking like, from the valentines day cosmetic
---
You are streamers
---
I see victims of a mori
---
Because only green ranks and above have ever used the Bloodweb during an event. Whatever it is you're smoking, you should lay off it before you start having ideas about being able to fly.
---
Damn I’d be pressed if it quit kid game. It’s easy for me to find a full lobby of survivors whenever I choose killer.
---
Actually my go-to joke when I start the game with friends in a Discord call xD
---
Knife at p1 although I rock the default but with the p3 mask
---
Billy on any indoors maps isn't great, even less so when you have no perks.
---
So true .
---
This is me
---
You should do your research before you comment. Not to nitpick or anything.
---
Meg's just like "you *skank*"
---
I prefer the current nurse tbh. Jokes aside you did a very nice job!
---
Oh yeah with zero gens makes sense but was responding to OP. If he camps you after looping for 5 gens he isnt being smart, hes being salty
---
but then again the oblivious change means that once freddy hit someone with borrow time they borrow time user will go down to freddy if freddy tunnels the dude
---
P1 is the knife, p2 the body and p3 the face.
---
If you get the full ste you are the most scary killer of the game..
---
thank you, people of the fog
---
Yes it's bugged.  Don't use it until they patch it.  Crashes everyones game once you get a certain token count.
---
ikr as soon as I threw the pallet thought it was going to be free hit.
---
False, you can hear the footsteps, and also spine chill is a thing
---
Lights are on so it's been completed already my guy 💯
---
His eyes. Right.
---
\- It doesn't work if you half heal two people (theorically one complete heal state) and it doesn't work if you heal someone from the dying state.
---
Remember when you had to invite your friend every single game
---
Yeah it was always late game. Usually right around you're hooking the last or second last survivor for the 3rd time haha
---
Love Twitch streamers! They rarely rage DC and are generally more wholesome. Also you can watch yourself in the replay.
---
Added permanent lobbies and removed the switch button. Why?
---
Also, remember when SWF lobbies had a chat? I hope this is a bug.
---
I believe it was removed because if someone in a SWF party accidentally hit the switch button, it broke the game.
---
Yeah, most of the time the ttv I get are fine, but now and then you get the ones who insta dc when they get up against a killer they don’t like so as not to look bad on stream or something and then be toxic as hell when they get called out.
---
Color blind killers will just need to rely on their enhanced sense of hearing and smell
---
This happened to me the other day
---
Just give them stalkery remarks on how they should bare their legs a bit at least
---
idk my dude
---
Did they leave PTB mode on? I'm getting 1 game in 10 which makes sense the rest is either new players who shouldn't be matched against me.

so the killer had a bad connection and decided to act immature? ok then, is that what "toxic" is these days? are we throwing that around so lackadaisically? immature yes, as far as i understand a killer being toxic is a billy cornering a survivor and just trapping them in the corner with no way out other then disconnecting, losing out on blood points.  
---
or face camping any survivor that they catch, other then that i don't see anything else being toxic, highly immature yes and definitely not someone to continue conversation with but not toxic.
---
Lol that's an awesome way to get it congrats!
---
Man his foot steps and his roar actually get me nervous. They did a great job with it.
---
Consider yourself lucky, even then the chance of receiving “ez baby killer noob” is pretty high..
---
That's a funny name for an Omegablink Nurse
---
The moment the gasp happens and the screen gets the border, that's when you have a longish charge enabled
---
It grows in distance a bit and caps right when the effect on the sceen fades out
---
It doesn't really give you anything useful imo. It's super situational.
---
Killers like this are why i stopped playing survivor. Now i play killer and make sure everyone has a good time. Dont care if i get a 4k or a no kill. As long as everyone had fun.
---
Had a leatherface who found me doing his ruin earlier, He hit me so i ran off and healed. I returned, he was still roaming around it. He chased me down and downed me (But not before 4 gens popped.)
---
Jane rescued me from hook behind him, he chased me down again. Slugged me and stood ontop of me. All 3 of my team mates were like 3meters away from him but he refused to go for anyone if it meant I was getting up.
---
I crawled to a pallet, they got the res, I got tunneled again and went down in the exit gate. He was chasing the rest of my team but I almost got out so he came over and picked me up and the other 3 ran past.
---
He was very angry about me finding that hex ruin, pretty sure he was trying to get a rise out of me so I just hit him with "GG that was funny game ^^"
---
Fellow killer, trust me when I tell you it is worth it to stick around. Gather more experience and soon you will crush these sort of players.
---
Try Spirit, she was always my favorite killer and rose from zero to hero, now being considered the best killer after Nurse.
---
So proud of my girl &lt;3
---
Right?
---
Prayer beads isn't really outplaying them though?
---
As a fellow hillbilly: Use Distressing. You only need to chainsaw people twice and you got over 4 k Deviousness points.
---
She actually has two brains one for each cheek
---
The play as survivor symbol, somehow
---
I've been trying to let the clear newbies go but some of them don't get it.
---
This meg ran past the open hatch twice earlier "running" from me.
---
that name of yours.....i like it
---
I think there are more for killer, Not sure why but it's also my experience with them.
---
How is your ego so fragile. Just take the L and move on.
---
agreed
---
When survivors think you’re farming but you’re actually trying your best *sad trumpet music*
---
This!
---
I hate the new "last survivor gets the hatch" mechanic, it is stupid and rather typical for our time where "everybody is a winner" even though they didn't do shit and did not earn it. Seriously, if the killer manages to keep all 5 gens running, he deserves the 4k.
---
We don’t talk about that
---
I started a new account on PS4 as rank 20 killer to get some nice experience for the newer players .. is funny
---
For me he is lowtier
---
I'm not colorblind and I'm struggling with scratch marks in the endgame, maybe I just suck but they blend horribly imo. I can't even imagine colorblind people having fun as killer, it just sounds painful.
---
I’ve tried TI, and it only worked about 2 times in about 20 matches, but I’m definitely getting spirit fury when it comes out on the shrine again
---
If CoD Ghosts with 65 people on MP lets you find lobbies then surely DbD won't have any issues with MM :^)
---
As a new player and been a survivor main, I mostly just spend all bp on levelling survivor I liked and when I saw a killer mission. I just go no perk as a killer and have fun. Tbf I’m now only rank 12 on survivor, but still being an absolute dumb r20 killer.
---
daily on a killer people didn't lvl up
---
Oh Leslie, when will you learn.
---
Meme templates are different. 
---
Momo if you want to see 14 screenshots of someones lobby feel free to sort by new. No one is stopping you.
---
He’s getting a hotfix next week so that his Shred will destroy pallets by default and his ultra-rare add-on will be changed so there’ll be no need for Brutal or Enduring after that.
---
They’re so fucked up.
---
If you suck, it’s “ez baby killer”
---
If you’re good, it’s “noob, report”
---
'cause you think low rank killers would have made them enjoy the game ?
---
yes now i remember he was really surprised after he she pulled him out of the dream world
---
I fully support this. I've been wondering for a long time about a colorblind setting, too.  Just popped into my head one day: "Wait, what if the killer is colorblind, and can't see our scratch marks? *Oh no.*" 
---
Please, keep it up!
---
Oh yeah forgot about that, I got excited when I found a good loadout lol
---
thank you
---
Egc?
---
Welcome to the fog fields...
---
Cause the game was like awe a baby well time to throw u to the wolves
---
Honestly this never bothered me. I prefer that over this new bug they added
---
bruh, these console players
---
It's the novelty of it, like running four no mither's
---
Where is bloodwarden?
---
Nah.
---
Corrupt Intervention is a more consistent, but ultimately worse, Ruin. The latter may often get cleansed earlier, but sometimes it doesn't. Plus, CI does nothing to slow the 4 gens that *aren't* blocked.
---
Enduring and Brutal Strength will be made redundant when the hotfix goes live and Shred auto-smashes pallets.
---
Discordance is too easily countered, once Survivors work out you have it.
---
Thrilling Tremors is great, though. I'd replace Corrupt Intervention with Ruin, Enduring with Pop Goes The Weasel and Brutal Strength with a perk of your choice. I'd recommend Surveillance.
---
"Stealth gameplay of survivor" hey you should learn to play agressive it will make you a better survivor
---
I am a new player. Thank you
---
but you can get more without a useless perk
---
Alright, I’ll try it out
---
Whole lotta no gen-defence, right there.
---
Any half-decent SWF group will have 3 gens popped by the time you get your first hook, then momentum will be so heavily in their favour, you won't recover.
---
thanks!
---
i contacted them threw the game.
---
Me as a kid dropping off a ladder
---
Thanks for the info
---
I wish the hatch generation was much easier and more simpler to locate.
---
&gt;The entire mechanic of closing the hatch is unfairnin my opinion. Last year the developers tried to implement it without End Game and they previously deemed it as too unfair.....don’t know how it’s fair WITH End Game now but ok. 
---
I agree with this, and wish that they would revise this mechanic.
---
The entity has decided to help the survivors
---
The crow perk is watch from the shadows which gives you a sound cue when the crows go off. But thanks for the constructive criticism
---
Not all killers have an M2 that hits anything.  Also exhaustion doesn't normally go down while running, it is paused.  Is it different for this generator exhaustion?  The idea is meant to be that they have to walk instead of run for x seconds until their exhaustion goes away before they can rely on sprint burst, dead hard, etc.
---
Maybe they're just stupid
---
Can't relate I've played like 20 games and no demogorgon
---
That's a good point
---
End game collapse
---
At World's End
---
Looping a killer, learning loops and being chased is a lot better as you give your team time to do gens, plus you stand a better chance at living if you know how to chase because you will get caught if you’re hiding.
---
this looks like darling in the franxx
---
You sound like a baby killer
---
Yes you can, with the nurse you just have to zig when she screams and for spirit when she phrases stop running and double back
---
You don't know how the game works. Also if he's a loser, then guess what you are?
---
I play ghost face a lot and this is honestly the bane of my existence
---
“I never even play clown and look I got 4 kills”
---
This is cursed, but in a cute way
---
Need to use a chainsaw a lot more, it’s better 1 shorting them then forcing a M1. As if they’re injured they can use dead hard(which is likely). Plus you give them more time/space to get away. He just takes a bit of time to get used to but don’t be afraid of losing games because you wanna learn the chainsaw
---
As you recommended, I watched a vid: [this one](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). 
---
Is it a nice tutorial?
---
&gt; I kind of imagine her being cute
---
*That's What I Mean!*  She'd probably look all sorts of wholesome &amp; kind, now she's... that.
---
Who's Joe?
---
It do be like that
---
That’s putting it lightly.
---
To me, the guy in FvJ isn’t bad, but he’s close to like Jason in Part 3, almost just sorta there
---
It is either that, or they call you out and taunt you for being a bad killer or something
---
He had just been dragged back into the real world, after having fucked with Jason and there he was...kind of pissed. Lol
---
survivors unhooking other survivors right as they're hooked is a common occurrence and an idiotic move. don't feel bad for immediately downing those people. if they think it's a smart move to try and unhook someone right in front of the killer, it's not your fault that they get downed. there's a big difference between strategically waiting for the killer to leave the area and helping the survivor and immediately going for the save while still hearing a heartbeat or seeing the killer still near the hook. they have no reason to complain when they themselves made a bad call.
---
Congratulations! You can piss killers off with twice the effectiveness!
---
&gt;" Bad move. First it should be noted that all characters can share their  perks once leveled but anyway, I feel like Claudette is a little bit of a  noob trap. "
---
Damn, I wish I knew. I made Claudette on my account to 9lvl.
---
Scariest killer, but not that good
---
Only spirit mains can relate
---
Dwight how could you
---
Just report those posts. They are regarded as over-saturated content, thus breaking the sub's rules.
---
It was taken out to make it work properly with the new party system. (EG not being able to switch killer with 4 people in your party so we end up with another 2 killers in a game bug) . They're working to get it back, but promise nothing
---
And that’s the point, it’s either stay there and hopefully not get caught or try to run away
---
Thats evil
---
Don’t get used to that :(
---
Ignore the advice you just got, play who you want.
---
Jane looks like Marguerite Baker from RE7. Is that just me?
---
This is like the only comunity that can take a wholesome meme and and make it hateful.

No it's doesn't. I say it all the time even if I get killed

Click on the equipped perk in the selection screen?

Happend a game when I played with no mither + self care.

Epic
---
Are you stupid? What the fuck is he gonna do after 5 gens? In case you played this Game before, 5 Gens is all the gens. Read the dudes comment before replying, dumbass
---
Its been exceptionally bad since the update. Constant babies in my lobbies even though I am in red ranks
---
Find the perk you want to remove from the Inventory/Perks list and click on it, then it will be removed.
---
HHHHHHHH
---
I figured it out like 3 seconds after I made this post haha. But thanks you1
---
Of course I do. Every killer should be viable and shouldn’t get absolutely stomped on. However that logic doesn’t apply to BH and I don’t think he’ll ever become that strong. But who knows maybe one day they’ll give him some love
---
It's not hard, but anoying
---
Yeah they are a bit slow
---
We're not toxic to new players. We just don't like people who don't play the game for long enough and come to the conclusion that the game is bad because the didn't do good in the time they did play.
---
So true. This is why I stopped paying attention to pips and started playing by less subjective win conditions. As long as I 4k (or 3k with hatch ) I consider that a victory.
---
this game would be so much better with a casual and ranked mode
---
What do you propose they do?
---
Honestly, this has been my entire experience as a killer newbie. Everyone has been really nice and wholesome!
---
I've gone through about 68 levels on my Demogorgon, and I still don't have BBQ &amp; Chilli
---
Pls help ;_;
---
fix it? I have faster queue times in challenger LoL games than this.
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
I've never had issues with hand cramping when using my Xbox remote to play dbd. It's actually much more comfortable for me, I even use it to play on pc too. I'm confused about holding down the analog, on xbox you press lb to run by default. Is that not similar to the way you do it on ps4 or what?
---
Reminds me of sometimes when I hear the terror radius increasing when I'm on the second floor of a building and I try to sneak out the window and land *right in front of them*. Oops
---

-BHVR, probably
---
Eh, You could say that but he did also ask for tips.
---
It's a rough learning curve, especially with broken matchmaking and all the assholes running around with moris to capitalize on the broken matchmaking.
---
No shit, League has like 100x more players.
---
How do you make these? I want to make killers doing the kazotsky kick
---
no this is getting a 4k win as billy in the hospital
---
No it’s not just you, I had one earlier and then again that don’t seem to realise that moving five steps away from the hook and not looking at it is still camping
---
Now bring fire up, brutal strength, bamboozle, Iron Maiden, and his addons that increase his action speed while invisible. See how fast you break things.
---
If the person your chasing takes more than 30 sec to get the first hit then leave them, look for a weaker link in the team. That person was just using up your time, remember it takes survivors 80~ sec to finish a gen
---
Let me disagree with you. OP wanted to know how to earn the score Event
---
I’m a simple man. I see TTV, I go onto their stream,  get their location, tunnel them and listen to them get more and more annoyed
---
I don't care if they place a portal and run away but it's when they just stand a few feet away waiting to lunge at someone is just shitty.

---
1. Play how you wanna play.  You're not camping you're actively looking for players and they're just wasting their own time by running around the hook and not getting gens. 
---
2. Welcome back
---
3. You can ignore whatever is said in the chat. I main killer and wouldn't want to turn off the chat cause I've had really cool conversations about the match.  Sure I've also had toxic survivors/killers try to get a rise out of me but they have 0 effect on me and they don't know me, fuck em
---
Lmao can't wait to see a tweet for that
---
Easiest way to learn about the game is to watch YouTube videos as they can give video examples of what they are explaining etc. Tbh it kinda suprises me that people don't go to Youtube first.
---
I usually get called a fair killer even when I 4k. Feelsgoodman
---
Yeah but that is in the future (though the ranking system is so messed up right now  that it might happen sooner than later) In the higher ranks most killers stop becoming viable unless you have a ton of skill. The main three are Nurse, Spirit, and Billy, but don’t worry about this so soon, try and learn wraith, it will teach you good habits, and if you really want to get better you can watch some tutorials on killer which will teach you some more advanced things like hiding your light and how to run certain tiles, but I would say for right now enjoy the game and don’t let the survivors get to you :)
---
Still a good meme though!
---
cool, he looks like JayBlac from youtube. legit..
---
No, was supposed to come in the summer is been pushed back to fall this year but no date
---
But make sure to DC once a while to derank. You literally cant "play how you want" and have fun at the same time in high ranks.
---
As someone who plays a lot of killer and I mean this in the nicest way possible, go fuck yourself lol.
---
And that's my tip to you. Go play something else. Call it "toxic". I don't care, people just throw that word around because it's the cool thing to say. But am I wrong? Do you not like this game because you're not winning right away? If you were winning, you wouldn't be here.  There are tons of streamers, YouTube videos, guides on-line to help. A simple Google search would get you everything you're asking for instead of making a Reddit post saying a game is "meh" when you're new to it.
---
I love Brush! Awesome meme
---
The problem is you almost gotta run one or the other, cos they will always find devour while they are looking for ruin, in my experience
---
Replace doc with spirit and that's probably accurate
---
A rank 2 survivor versus rank 15 killer, totally fair
---
I sometimes play Clown with Devour. Clown sucks but I've gotten quite a lot of 4k's and moris because of Devour
---
Fixing soloqueue would help. I don't have the patience rank up anymore in this game as a soloplayer.
---
The issue is that Wifi in my experience, is not constant. It keep switching ping, whereas ethernet is way more stable.
---
Why did they do that... Come one i m fat i don t live that much... Make my life more simple
---
You have a red stain (light) in front of you that survivors can see. They can use it, for example, to decide which direction they should go around the corner. So learn to backpedal and turn around to make yourself unpredictable.
---
Coming to the DBD subreddit and making your title "dbd is meh" might upset some people but also yeah the loudest part of the community is toxic.

I also main survivor but since I bought the ST dlc i deciced to play Demogorgon (rank 20) and I got put against green ranks I got wriggity wriggity wrecked
---
Proud of you
---
Disgusting
---
I sincerely hope you're joking and aren't that cruel
---
I see the bottom of a bowl of spaghetti. What the fuck is wrong with me
---
Can you say me how to di it? Private or whatever
---
I had a rank 2 jake loop me when I played nurse for a chase daily. I went after him as much as I could and it helped a lot when he clicked his flashlight and ran up to me so that I would chase him. I got 1 hit on him the whole game and I got my daily. The next 2 games I played as Nurse got me a 3k and a 4k. I appreciate the Jake for giving me experience with nurse
---
HE FAST AS FUCK BOI
---
They can’t just fix something that’s not broken. Just to many killers not enough survivors
---
Never in my life did I realize I needed something until I received it. 
---
I’m def on board with this idea. Any specific variation since I believe there are a few or do you suggest they’d create their own remix?
---
Multiple people pick their killers then switch to spectator. Last person to ready up does a countdown, all spectators switch to killer just as the final person readies up.
---
rip, I've never played the demogorgon yet but i find it really fun to go against
---
Well considering they came out and said something is wrong with matchmaking and they're hotfixing it, but to his complaint bigger player base would fix it
---
I thought that they were going to be part of the Archives? That you earn as a reward by completing it?
---
My net likes to suddenly and erratically 2-3 times a day go to 2k+ ping I get accused 100% of the time for lag switching when it happens even though if it happens I stop chasing or doing anything because of potential unfun bullshit hits usually lasts no more than 2 minutes but I don't like ruining people's fun with lag
---
I said the game is "meh". The game is not bad - I wouldn't say that.   
---
It has parts, that drags it far from being good, like repeatedly done objective every single match and some imbalance, but also it has stuff that doesn't make the game completly bad, like the setting, characters, and thrill being chased by a killer.
---
I'm speaking from the point of a new player. Are you hooked right away? Good for you, enjoy the game. From my perspective, if I wanted to buy the game, it has to offer more than the ones I currently play. DBD did drag me for several hours, but seeing comments like yours made me think it's not even worth to be a part of all of this.
---
I asked for the tips; specifically for the support role in the team (I even mentioned I liked playing Claudette, for her initial perks). I even edited the post to state it clear. 
---
Your response was toxic, unhelping, you didn't even bother to read the whole post and help a new player. You had to act like a fandboy, because someone doesn't find the game as good as you do.
---
She could've picked it up in-game, by which point it's pretty easy to miss.
---
They need to make Bracelet Ultra Rare.
---
Not your net definitely your pcs fault, I play on literally 300kbps+ and load fine
---
I mean I understand getting mad if the killer just stomped the whole team with no DCS. But there were literally 2. So.
---
An issue is, is that they'd need to get in touch with Charlie Clouser as the filmmakers don't own the rights to the soundtrack, Clouser (as the composer) does, and I'd imagine it's just a case of getting in touch and see if he's willing to do so.
---
So you just Make it worse againts you eh?
---
The only thing wrong with matchmaking right now though is just there is no rank balancer just like it is in the ptb pretty much that is the only issue. Since OP is having trouble even finding games right now i don’t think that is the reason
---
baby myers doesn't know how to grab &gt;&lt;
---
I haven't either. Get in games quicker with better pings.
---
Remember when you couldn't invite friends at all?
---
And to get that you have to follow the advise the other guy gave
---
You do understand the animosity towards killers just doesn't come out of a no where right?
---
did you just waste a pallet??
---
1. Play play play
---
2. Don't chase someone you obviously aren't going to get but also kinda try to learn how they were able to avoid you. 
---
3. Patrol gens. 
---
4. This goes with 3 but make sure you're damaging gens.
---
5. Watch gameplay of other killers and see how they handle things. 
---
6. Find the right perks that work for you. 
---
7. And most important, practice
---
Wait what
---
So rather than fix the bug, they got rid of the feature. 
---
Very cool!
---
You forgot the key or the map.
---
I wanted to just stack my BBQ and let them out after I realized they probably just started playing, but unfortunately those two died on hook in struggle phase. Saved atleast 2/4 I guess?
---
My favourites are Hello Zepp itself from the first Saw, Final Test from Saw III and Zepp Eight from Jigsaw, but I think they should go with a mix of their own since the length of the Endgame Collapse tends to vary. That being said the default length of the Endgame Collapse is 3 minutes and the original Hello Zepp is also exactly 3 minutes so there's a nice coincidence right there :D
---
It is the same glitch then,i will try, thanks!
---
I’ll happily send a gg if a killer doesn’t play like a dickhead. So many killers feel like they just HAVE to down and hook the first guy they see no matter how many gens they lose during the chase, like just nut up and take the loss. Then they complain about “genrush” after as if they didn’t sabotage their own game from greed
---
Yea I know. Clouser is an amazing composer and this'll probably never happen but one can dream :)
---
My mum doesn’t even know what twitch is
---
Yes, they can apparently view your progress on their side so anything that you’ve lost they should be able to see. Open a ticket with them and they’ll sort it out.
---
Submit a ticket to dbd on their website.
---
Everyone is asking how to do this, so I'll spill the beans.
---
1. Go into a custom game. 
---
2. Have one player as survivor and the rest killers to set up perks and such. (Optional)
---
3. Have all but one of the killers switch to spectator.
---
4. Have either the survivor or killer ready up.
---
5. The other player starts a verbal countdown (3, 2, 1, Go!)
---
6. On go, the last player readies up and all spectators switch to killer.
---
If you see one survivor and many killers on the player list on the right side, congrats! Have fun. Be careful though, one of the killers may spawn outside the map on indoor maps like HNL.
---
You're flexing on how you used to be rank 8 but I'M bad? Alright champ
---
Boy its early for dumb post yea hitting m2 and having no counter and don't tell me to run a perk what prey tell am I going to do hmm
---
Okay awesome, thank you.
---
Commodius toolbox with clean rag and swivels is better
---
You need spirit fury my friend.
---
That's actually pretty common. Fixing the bug most likely involves quite some re structuring in the codebase. So they remove the feature, fix it slowly and bring back the feature in a future update.
---
Lol, she is slow. Run her around and don't take a hit. Then when she start phasing start to walk away from loop. On rank 7 works in 80% times.
---
Claudette working on a gen. Thats impossible
---
You forgot self care, decisive strike, borrowed time and empathy
---
Hah got em
---
Oh, thanks. Didn't know that :)
---
Bruh who runs engineers toolbox
---
It's just called Leatherface
---
What dont people understand about they cant fix matchmaking. People are queuing on killer and there arent enough survivors to match them with, therefore the long wait time. It's like a first come first served system. You queue and wait your turn.
---
Remember when you could get to the shrine without opening the store
---
You mean loop a killer you can't see half the time and you can't walk away from a spirit because 90% of maps have grass not to mention if you're injured
---
You know those little things in your rank that help you rank up? That’s a pip
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah.
---
I'd like to consider this subreddit the bridge between the killers and survivors that don't go batshit at eachother for their plays.
---
This is sanctuary away from the toxicity.
---
I'm sorry, I never use items :(
---
My response was anything but toxic. I did in fact read the whole post. 
---
If I was fanboying I'd mention how I believe how the game is impossible to dislike and that the game is perfect in every way. Just because I defend the game doesnt mean that I think that way. 
---
I'd welcome you saying you didn't like the game if you seemed like you had played longer.
---
Nah i'm good
---
Once a while a wild toxic player pops up and gets a shitload of downvoted. 
---
*Gotta love Reddit*
---
r/nicegamers
---
So its just demogorgons, you've never had any other killer camp you, or "tunnel" you. If you die to these "Gorgon mains" that "suck", surely they aren't the bad one. You should think about what you post before you just put a bunch of salt because you're annoyed about the game you just had.
---
I miss that most
---
It always seems to be my low level killers too. God forbid I get a nurse or spirit one. I get a fucking bubba one
---
Rip that actually sucks the one part about the update I don't like
---
...no?
---
Here's the thing. I don't run self care especially since inner strength is a thing. That being said waiting for a nonswf teammate that will never heal you can be worse than you spending the time to heal yourself
---
Hearkening, the metre range is too short.
---
Fun fact: Mangled + Tier 3 Thnatophobia with 4 survivors injured takes 25 seconds to heal or 50 with self-care.
---
The flashlight.
---
I want all killers to have a personal theme now that would be legit
---
Thought it was Adam before I read the title
---
To move up in the ranks, you need a certain amount of pips. A pip is earned in game as both survivor and killers using certain criteria to award, -1,0,1, or 2 pips. For killer, it will tasks into count how many hooks you get overall, how many generators you prevent the survivors from doing, chases won, and injuring survivors. Survivors gets pips by escaping, winning chases and not getting downed, doing generators, and healing your teammates. The higher in the ranks you go, the more of these categories you have to do well in, and makes it more difficult to get a pip.
---
Im running Iron will vs all killers. It's a good perk. And if u get injured, well, it's her mechanic to hear and see spots only.
---
Would doubling it work do you think?
---
Okay I'll just put myself on the hook
---
Don't. It'll crash your game.
---
Sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do. I try not to tunnel, but if ove only hooked one guy, two gens are done in 90 seconds, and my ruin is gone, I'll definitely tunnel the shit out of the first guy, so I can slow the game down.
---
That would completely kill matchmaking. And how would ranked mode work? This game isn’t nearly balanced enough for that.
---
From The Clown onwards they fortunately do. Albeit it's a variation of the Dead By Daylight theme itself but it's something :)
---
i talk about this a lot but then sweats could come on casual and a get ez 4ks
---
Or fucking freddy
---
ranked would work like the mode we have now but with actual rewards for the rank
---
The whole "self care sucks" is a myth imo. Yes it takes double the time, but you also do it alone instead of wasting 2 people's time. Its actually more time efficient since u don't waste time finding a teammate. Also less risky since u can do it in a safe spot instead of going around looking for a teammate.
---
If you can equip a good med kit instead, that's good tho.
---
Getting blinded at pallet is not being bullied.
---
There are actual kids getting bullied daily. Your inability at countering online player's action should never be compared to these actual victims.
---
Nice one mate. First of many 4ks I hope
---
I just want a Freddy who talks :(
---
Damn thats harsh
---
Wait what?
---
The other secret ingredient is potatoes.
---
But in reality tru3 is mid tier xP
---
He also makes some cool animations
---
sprint burst automatically applies when you start running. aka sprinting. it leaves you with a temporary exhaustion cooldown before you can use the perk again. try to avoid running until you're in a chase, or switch it for a similar perk like lithe or balanced landing, which both have specific conditions where they activate instead of just running.
---
also don't feel bad, we were all noobs once
---
Imo billy is bot that hard to understand fully
---
With Sprint burst it's activation is whenever you start to Sprint. It's an exhaustion perk which means once you activate it you'll have to wait a certain amount of time before you can use it again. Basically if you don't want to activate it you'll have to walk around the map. Other exhaustion perks such as Bea's balanced landing can be activated by sprinting off tall things
---
His upper body seems longer than his lower body for some reason.
---
and it works!
---
Sorry if u think curving is very hard, but for me, it is not
---
Lol just use your ears. I always pretend to pick someone up and wait for any sound in the area. If I hear something I chase the dude with the flashlight
---
You Don’t Need To Heal All Of The Time
---
Oh I'm fine with them rarely do I get stunned and drop someone but pallets man. PALLETS
---
I use my phone to play this game
---
It happened to me as well! And next game I got with 2 toxic survivors rank 8 and got my ass clapped
---

A true pro gamer move
---
Keep that weirdchamp shit on Twitch pls
---
If only you did a 360.
---
Just because you’re injured doesn’t mean chase will end in 2 secs(unless you play a stealth killer) you will hear the terror radius and you can make the play by escaping the area or hiding in a locker. every time YOU see the killer doesn’t mean there needs to be a chase
---
I'll blind you at the pallet with both max bulb addons
---
I wish we had more emotes
---
As a furry degenerate uwu nuzzles your throbbing testicles.
---
I love facing Spirits, even if I have no perks to assist me against her (notably Spine Chill and Iron Will). The key is to remaining healthy for long periods of time and walk/run off loops while breaking line of sight simultaneously.
---
I've been chased for long periods by Spirit and enough to have them leave me when I'm injured, sometimes even without Iron Will.
---
It also helps knowing that I play her a lot (or used to rather) I know her movement speed, duration in phase, charge time, etc. all instinctively. I can tell which add-ons she is using with about 80% accuracy and adjust for that. Accounting all that I just intuitively know when to drop a pallet on Spirit in phase walk to stun her. Spirits also get impatient if they can't get the hit/down fast, so I punish those a lot with pallet stuns.
---
I've also had two games using Fixated while against Spirit and it can really mess with her.
---
I just wish Prayer Beads would be changed entirely. I often run Spine Chill so I don't get grabbed, but in those rare cases I don't, being grabbed off gens or seeing other survivors grabbed makes for extremely boring and frustrating games where chases don't even occur because the Spirit is so anal about getting grabs only.
---
I am aware of the whole "run adrenaline and don't heal so gens are done super fast". The problem with this strategy is that at red ranks sometimes even if you do plenty of gens and you escape, that's still not enough to pip. You also need plenty of "evader" points and those are easier to get if you are healthy.
---
Huntress is a furry because she wears animal costumes.
---
It take 1:15 to do a gen empty handed and with a good toolbox usually around 1:05-55secs people could pop a  gen if they use their time right

I would never recommend to bet only one one horse. If you get a camper and catches early.. all is gone. If you split it to multiple matches, it is much saver to earn a bigger amount.

1.5mbps is enough to game on and doesnt change load times. It's either you have a slow harddrive or CPU (or both).

that sounds strange
---
I mean it's only relative

You need chases to get a good evader score.

Lose the UI and this is a dope wallpaper

Hiding in killer terror radius will give evader points pls give it a try

Not much different there, he was born with his face and body deformed
---
You don’t NEED to heal every time you get hit ( unless stealth killer) especially in late game. If you know you’re chases end fast just bring a medkit
---
I miss it. I pretty much only play killer for dailies, so I'm used to switching back to survivor after finishing it. But now I have to hit back first? Bullshit.
---
Try a medkit bro
---
lmao holy shit ppl do this?
---
Ha you sly fool, you have activated my trap card! Mindbreak!

I still do this I’m not afraid to admit It

They are ultra rare quality but the only ones that exist are for Leatherface, Freddy, Myers and Pig. There used to be one for Doctor and Hag but they removed those because the purpose was to give players a chance to try out DLC killers but Doc and Hag are available for Iridescent shards so it didn't make sense. Demogorgon and Ghostface have come out and still don't have one though.
---
Born in 30s, finger found in 50s
---
Fun Fact: That isn't enough to get top emblems needed to pip at red ranks

Maybe they want any map except that damn new one i get this alot now too since people dont like it haha they prefer lerys or meat plant over the new one
---
You complaining and bitching about how to game sucks and blah blah blah because you don’t know how to play is why those assumptions came into place
---
Looks like pennywises mouth
---
Who said anything about "Tunneling one guy" you can get everyone to phase 2 of the hook and get one person killed over the course of the first 4 gens and then BAM entity displeased/3 escaped even if you're playing fantastic and keeping the pressure up. Having one kill after 4 gens is pretty damn normal; especially at red ranks were 2-3 gens typically pop in the first 3 minutes (if that) regardless of perks being ran.
---
If a killer is straight up camping and doing a "Tunnel" with a mori and the 4K happens then the survivors deserved it for applying 0 gen pressure in that case. Notice the killer is camping or focusing an unhook? Leave them on the hook for a bit; finish the gens.
---
Keys are broken as fuck and no amount of words will change that. They are in chests. Add-ons to keep them regardless of use or dying. Can take all 4 survivors out instantly skipping the gate phase or 1-3 survivors before the final gen is even complete. 
---
The fact that people here honestly believe keys aren't worse than mori's actually boggles my mind right now. 
---
&gt;Killer applies pressure and 2 hooks everybody getting 8 total hooks during the first 4 gens.  
---
&gt;Killer gets a single kill before gen 5. 
---
&gt;All 3 survivor leave before the final gen is done and the game is over before the killer can even realize what happened.  
---
&gt; Killer loses because even though they played well and didn't focus the one person who brought a key in.
---
Tapped post twice

Uh yeah? cheating is usually annoying.

---
Works for me especially when I popped a lot of gens and get a generous amount of saves and at some point in the game you will get chased and you might be healed on top of that doing gens brings teammates you will eventually get healed. You can still get chase points
---
I don't personally use it, but I'm always extremely grateful for the survivors that have it since they can get me off the hook and tank a hit again on the way out if there's only 2 of us left.
---
She is one the killers I want to request. I can see her as a mixed race looking Asian girl and it will be a refreshing change to see a killer who is not physically intimidating but psychologically intimidating.
---
Since Doc and Hag actually, but Doc's and Hag's were removed because the purpose of the splinter offerings was to allow players to try out DLC killers that weren't available to purchase with Iridescent shards. So only Licensed killers have them, except Demo and Ghosty :(

Matchmaking seems content to put red ranks in every game when I’m running killer daily’s and my first real game I was with all rank 20’s. 2 hooks on everyone before a single generator was done , fast vaulting into lockers , dropping pallets and them Slow vaulting .... I decided despite all my depips what was one more and picked one up and dropped them at a generator and backed up. A few people got the idea so I got my chase time and brutality , got a safety pip and stayed behind to talk and tell them the ropes. 
---
Been getting red rank killers when I’m just a 17 survivor as well. Matchmaking at its finest though amirite?
---
Dude you are the one coming to me, get off my lap lmao.
---
Ingenuity is such a great idea. Definitely give some use to the brown items in chests
---
The best binds are the ones which suit YOU the best not the others.
---
Can't tell what's scarier, the fact you used an emoji, or the low chances of getting hawkins
---
She’s a ginger but otherwise she looks amazing well done
---
Why don't you just use a PS4 controller to play?
---
Knowing BHVR and the very common multiple killers bug that's been around for a while, it probably very well would've turned into filling up a lobby then hitting switch to killer and now you have a 4-man killer lobby.
---
I will make it legal.
---
It used to disable it for swf couldn’t they just make it disable once another person joined the lobby? Idk anything about game development or code but is it that hard?
---
It aint that stupid. 25% for each map. They discluded any other map.
---
What?
---
I'm coming back after a long break and most of the survivors have been pretty chill after steam rolling me. The worst is just getting passive aggressive "advice" from people that don't know how to play killer. e.g. You should lay more traps when I laid like 30 traps and the guy doesn't realize how good his team was at cleaning up for him.
---
Good point but they will leave you extremely angry if they self care while it’s only one gen left or if you’re getting chased for 40 seconds and you need them to pop a gen or get a gate or even save another teammate
---
This is so well made! Do I have the permission to repost this on Instagram? :) With Credit of course. 💕
---
Happens to me on Claudette to. Don’t know if it’s a big or it just doesn’t work for Claudette
---
Cuz you're a fucking moron acting like you didn't play a bunch of babies. People who aren't red ranks are baby players
---
Well you got 4 downs out of a potential minimum 16 downs, 4 hits out of a potential 24 hits, and 4 hooks out of a potential 12.
---
While I get that you probably shouldn't depip from matches like this, I personally don't think you ever would outside of it being your own fault, do people really expect matches like this to be instant 2pips?
---
Iron will is not a good perk vs every other killer because of blood I say this as a killer main with 3000 hours and like I said before iron will on works on indoor maps because a good spirit will use grass movement
---
Second wind is trash it hasn't worked once
---
game glitched
---
Ope, just gonna squeeze by ya here
---
Ok
---
Where can I use/make a wheel like this?
---
It‘s Plague
---
let's say best case this does mean we can have classic freddy skins (not saying we will but hypothetically let's say), does that mean that there might be issues with the potential Quentin face rework or would there probably be no issue since he's specifically from the reboot?
---
And a split player with terrible balance. It wouldn’t work.
---
I’ve gotten the portals to work plenty of times, you just have to hide them around the corner from gens because when you come out you have no red stain or terror radius and then the survivor/survivors get taken by surprise and you get at least one free hit or even a grab if you’re lucky
---
You can pick 30 min queu times for balanced matches or unbalanced quick matches you can only pick one.
---
Wow cool man
---
Take it as a learning experience
---
This is BHVR you're talking about.
---
The re-lobby system was introduced after 3 years.
---
There's still no colorblind mode.
---
Freddy.
---
When you escape after doing 4 of the gens unhooking 2 team mates and not even being noticed by the killer and then earning the adept ash trophy.
---
Well I didnt know I had bad wifi until I got into the game
---
Hawkins with Billy is basically gg from the start. That map is so unfriendly to him.
---
different times indeed
---
Lmao. I only get that map playing billy and hunt. It's so irritating
---
Assuming the computer has Bluetooth capabilities:
---
Start -&gt; Search for "Bluetooth" and click whatever pops up -&gt; connect a device using BT -&gt; hold the "share" and "playstation" buttons until it starts flashing -&gt; click the controller image that pops up on the computer.
---
You'll also want to, unfortunately, start steam in Big Picture mode which you can do by clicking the "Enlarge" looking button in the top right of the Steam homepage.
---
You should then be good to go for now, though I would recommend having him download and set up a program called "Inputmapper" for you later that remaps the ps4 controller to act like an xbox controller. This makes it more compattible with a lot more games that don't like Playstation controllers for some reason and it just generally makes controllers work a little smoother.
---
I hope this helps :)
---
And this is an issue because...?
---
/s
---
Well with those perks (adrenaline, head on and ds) its actually an insane combo If u can pull it off
---
What shirt is that and how do you get it?
---
I Feel your pain I am a killer that lives with his parents
---
I had someone call me the best killer ever, although I was playing nurse
---
Thanks for the advice, but I'm not gonna try this myself. I don't trust myself with technology. I'll show your comment my boyfriend when he gets home and he'll probably be able to do it. Thanks for the help
---
Is no one going to point out Myers in the back.
---
honestly where he is now is fine META wise
---
you can delete the less upvoted post
---
Same. But I missed the skillcheck lmao
---
It doesn't work tho every time I heal someone to full health it never activates
---
Not even close
---
What about console players?
---
I’m rank 9 killer and last night I only got red rank survivors. But I discovered they aren’t as good as they think they are. I got 4 k most of the time with Freddy.
---
They don’t hire voice actors, the devs themselves do the voices. I don’t think it’s the same one as Quentin though
---
Except right now its 30 min queue times with unbalanced matchmaking
---
Like do you wonna see my steam acc
---
Probably got lucky ended up in base field anyway
---
Well I fucked your dad so we're even. :)
---
Oh. Except for the part where I bang your mom too on your bed.
---
Nah, this idea is a flop
---
This is actually a really good point. It has taken me forever to learn to run as a survivor, and I'm still not great by any means. On the other hand, killing new survivors was super easy when I started the game. It's almost like survivors have to learn everything early, but the real learning for killer doesnt start until mid ranks or later.
---
Lmao u mad af
---
It's a flair. If you go to the subreddits main page and click the three dots on the top right and select change user flair you can add one
---
nah, u gotta get that inner strength and Q&amp;Q. much better
---
throws off the game balance, makes it not fun.
---
Yea why actually did they remove that button?
---
They sound similar especially when they are put on the hook though. I just think his voice should be raspier.
---
Oof. Good play. Luckily no noed.
---
Sure
---
Survivors that know what they're doing, or survivors that are apt to spread discontent around them.

Love it.

Halloween
---
Really wtvr killer sounds fun to you. Watch some gameplay. Also look up meta relevant perks and whose teachable perks they belong to as you can level that person up and unlock the perks for all other characters. The Halloween chapter is pretty good and the spirit is good too.
---
I don’t know why they took that out, really upset about it.
---
Coldwind Farm remembers.
---
Ay I’m just gonna pop this on because I did suggest a rework for clown involving his map pressure. Not trying to promote myself that much but just thought it was relevant and necessary. :)

Yeah but they did follow through with Freddy
---
Ever since the rework this is the first time ive seen someone pull it off
---
I know what I’m doing but the terror radius going through floors really fucks with me
---
eeeeeh not so sure. I thinks he lack a bit of something to be at the right tier. He got a way to move around the map which makes him more able to pressure gen than huntress but he's not at the level of Billy or Freddy in the matter.
---
It's fun for you and your friends, and most of the time you still get your ass handed to you

I have the same issue, hope they fix soon because this week we have double bloodpoints.

What do you think of the perks? I tried to think of things that could work in the current meta and still be balanced.

Tap time.

Yeah they did, but the time they spent to do it..

No it allows you to get up but only once
---
Hyper gay move
---
Yeah, but a *lot* of people think the Minecraft circlejerk is responsible for it, and not something wrong with the game itself
---
I am relaxed, but I'm just paying for it \^\_\^ At least killer seems fine and survivors' perks are interesting.

Glat that you're bubba and not nurse, ez escape

yez

Better idea
---
No, but the Demogorgon was able to stalk
---
&gt; Salty he can’t get views without DBD forcing him to play a game from what I’ve been reading on this sub over the summer, general consensus seems to be he gets less views if they don’t stream DBD or another popular title for streamers.
---
This is very frequent BTW. If you gain most of your viewer base in a specific game you are likely to get a big viewer drop if you play something else, especially if the new game has nothing to do with your main one.

Claidette worked fine for me but David and jake both took about 5 times before it unlocked. Just keep doing it and eventually it’ll unlock

I play on XBOX and this happened to me last night. I lost about 400,000 bloodpoints and went back from Rank 5 to Rank 8. I also lost everything I purchased in the bloodweb during that time period. I'll file a ticket today as well so they know it's affecting multiple users/platforms.
---
um excuse me how is this a shitpost
---
I have never seen such comedy in my life
---
3 is where the fun really starts
---
Thanks
---
He shook his head no after every down, bm goes both ways
---
I like him. He’s honest and doesn’t really have this separate persona that a lot of streamers tend to have. He’s also good at the game and explains why he does things in a blunt, non-confusing way, which I prefer
---
I once hooked someone, BBQ didn't go off and after looking around for like 20 seconds I left and ran halfway across the map. Came back and downed both guys and then I got called out for camping. Feels bad man.
---
If you’re gonna play killer, Leatherface is #1 cause you can get BBQ &amp; Chili, the best perk in the game that gives you 2x bloodpoints for hooking all 4 survivors.  Besides that it’s choice, but some fun killers you should buy are Freddy and Michael.
---
It's a no from me
---
I usually run Ruin, Surveillance, monitor and abuse, and usually whispers but I replace that one periodically. I’d also recommend when phasing pay attention to movement in grass and listen for footsteps. Some survivors run iron will which can really mess you up if you only listen for their pained noises.
---
He had noed, we stayed until it was cleansed
---
He’s gonna be upper B tier once he can destroy pallets with his lunge, and he’s already good enough.... not sure why people want him buffed so badly when LF still exists
---
Not really
---
*I'm you*
---
He's very dismissive and sometimes downright insulting to people who don't agree that survivors are OP. At the same time whenever he loses as survivor it's because of his 'bad luck' and bad teammates.
---
Yea I run haunted and ruin already. I’m thinking for my last 2 perks I run nurse and sloppy
---
Midchapter
---
60 min.

Would you like anything similar to the perks in game? The IP doesn’t really matter I just had a theme to help think of some new perks.

Otz ran it w him so I might give it a try tbh
---
I missed it and threw it down

Hey, that's my birthday.

You too chief

The button was never in SWF tho, it was only in Play As Survivor/Play As Killer, which is solo quene...
---
Survivor symbol is cool.
---
Killer is borimg generic spooky skulls.
---
Why would a survivor ever bring a Gideon’s offering
---
perfectly balanced nerf decisive strike
---
"Need" is a strong word. 
---
We really do not "need" any extra licensed expansions.
---
I love otz but I ran this myself and it’s honestly op
---
With the amount of errors me and my friends have been getting, we're still doing that.
---
But what else is The Killer supposed to do in that situation though? As u/DecutoR said, The game is over and people trying to rescue you is the next objective he must defend.
---
My thoughts are nothing because I don't really know him and only ever see him play games on twitch?
---
I don't get this mentality that twitch streamers have to be goody goody and not say bad things. Like... most of us do it - Stop calling them out for being normal people.
---
We all get salty, we just don't all stream it. If you want a fake streamer who is only ever in a good mood, there's a few.
---
Phil mama
---
Are you hitting great skill checks/using a medkit/healing with someone else?
---
It takes a long time, yes, but more than a year for a single feature is just ridiculous.
---
Pwyf is garb
---
So, I was reading the forums last night and since your friends are in your lobby in a SWF they need to figure out a way for that to not happen when you switch to killer. That was their words.
---
Np my man
---
I only turned the art into poster style, just cropped them and added the dbd logo. of course I did not draw either of them, should've been more clear about that probably, my bad
---
Damn fina is really getting some action, seems like they finally got li to get into bed with them
---
Oh look, a match making post.
---
And did you receive permission from all these artists to use their art like this?
---
I mean considering he’s the worst killer in the game I think a rework or buff is completely justifiable.
---
It's just pixels moving up and down, it shouldn't piss anyone off.
---
i got dropped to lvl 17 from 14 i think.  first few matches with my new shiny baby demo (cant even get him to lvl 5 yet)   i got matched with some lvl 8s and 10s.   
---
oddly enough i felt like i barely did anything and still got brutal killer.  i had maybe 4 or 5 hooks.   no kills.
---
When you were about to leave the building but you got the scream and aura in the next room over
---
_Doctor kazotsky kicks_
---
You need to get a full health heal state equivalent, not just heal someone to full. If they already healed a bit then yeah it’s not going to work. Also you realize you need to get unhooked as well then it’ll proc
---
Yeah, he learnt that matchmaking is god awful
---
Freedy was an entire rework, not a feature
---
Ik right haha
---
I just wish the portals could be recycled. I think adding that with his lunge improvement would be enough.
---
Put a crouching Pig there too
---
I agree with this. The rarities of the Bracelet and the Mother-Daughter Ring should be swapped, imo
---
what does -rep mean
---
No clue
---
True. But it takes less than 1/8th of that time for them to make a completely new killer.
---
I’m also on PS4 and have been experiencing the same thing.
---
I love how a few of these clips are cut because you clearly didn’t pull off the save....
---
Have you seen SAW 7, though? There was another person helping from almost the beginning.

---
Oh look, I don’t care
---
Personally speaking, there aren’t many games out there where the difficulty is entirely dependent on your team and the opposer. There are even fewer where they interest me.
---
DbD has a hard starting learning curve, but that’s it’s appeal to a lot of people who play it long-term. It doesn’t matter how good you get, there is always one person out there who challenges you.
---
I will agree it’s repetitive objective-wise, I can’t argue against that... But the objective itself is to escape, what you do to escape ultimately doesn’t really matter... if it not generators it’d be finding keys or something... they need a time consuming activity and generators are the most logical.
---
To get better, what you need to do is learn the killers abilities and exploit their powers back at them... e.g. hug walls against bubba so he has a chance to hit them and stop... crouch walk over the hag traps... zig zag &amp; double back to confuse nurse and spirit etc.
---
Learn the rough distance a killer has to lunge at you and 360/180 them just before you anticipate they’ll attempt a strike. Plus you haven’t even been able to touch on mix-and-matching perks by unlocking them from other characters.
---
The same goes in reverse for killers... Learn what the survivor meta is and orchestrate killer abilities with perks to combat it.
---
Then you can start creating builds that break the meta and exploit what the status quo does so you have your own advantages and catch people off guard... 
---
At face value, yeah it’s frustrating when you’re new. The game is designed to be unbalanced, at its very nature it’s 4 v 1... But it’s definitely not cookie cutter and if you give it a chance you’ll see it’s not as repetitive as you think.
---
I remember seeing somewhere in the devs updates that they don’t start working on killers right when the previous one is out, they start wayyyy before that
---
Basically what happens whenever I ask my friends where we should go for food.
---
It just means “I had a bad experience with this guy”
---
I’m laughing so hard at this.

These are so cool, I’m excited to see the legion

Well did you camp?

That’s tuff

Maybe reported? Idk

so this is what its like to play on console

Cant wait for them to fix matchmaking so that you guys can complain about how long it takes to get into a match.

Thanks for your input i appreciate it

What? PC players don't BM? I watch loads of streamers on PC, all Tbag, all BM. Maybe they just use mouse and Keyboard on an Xbox?

*yawn*

It’s BHVR, it’s pretty much guaranteed that leaving it in would have resulted in 4v4 games

Can’t wait till you realize that matches don’t come regardless of how ass the matchmaking is

Imagine what the entity think when everyone brought map offering

I gather artwork on my pc without having the names of the artists so I can't credit them unfortunately, but I'm pretty sure none of them would react to their artwork being used as a shelf art in a platform in a negative way.
---
Fair point.
---
“Alright time to get out of thi- AAAAAAAAAA”
---
Well I don't play surviver so I don't know that
---
Yea lol every pallet besides 2 are unsafe, sure there are a few decent loops you can do but 2 of them are completely reliant on Balanced Landing and the other is still pretty easy for the killer. The gens are all in unsafe locations and most of the map is straight aways allowing for the killer to find the survivors in .1 second lol. It is an amazing map for killers and if you say otherwise thats kinda a bruh moment lol.
---
They're too busy making pachinko machines
---
Probably "no u"
---
Could be.
---
It would be no different than hag traps though and I think would be the buff he needs. It sucks to get stuck near endgame and have portals out of position due to gens being rushed on one side of the map with no way to replace them. You should at least be able to close your own portal to regain its use.
---
Spaghetti code does apparently make it a problem. They said in the most recent dev stream they never expected the $20 at launch game to get this big. Not an excuse just what I’ve read lol
---
It's a very new map, there are good spots for traps. You just need to practice and find the spots.
---
Oh.
---
60 secs and more with add ond
---
Maybe not hag since she's like a wendigo, but David and detective would legit beat the shit outra them almost by themselves
---
8. Get ruin and BBQ and Chili ASAP
---
9. Play extremely close attention to your ears. Sounds are key.
---
10. Learn to identify good loops and unsafe loops. Avoid good loop locations.
---
11. Don't get obsessed about getting 4 kills, your first objectives are learning and farming points.
---
12. Don't be afraid of getting pallet stunned. Swing across every pallet. More times than you think you'll get a hit and the pallet down.
---
13. Don't camp people in hooks unless they rly rly rly deserve it. It is not a wise thing to do and makes the game unfun.
---
14. Related to number 5, a streamer called otzdarva is great for learning killer gameplay. A YouTuber called int3r4ct makes great killer analysis in extensive 40 min long videos called "entity education"
---
I was nurse main, but now i think it's bad to main her.
---
Match making is bugged right now so you probably got experienced killers. Also with the new dlc that dropped killer q times are higher then normal. 
---
As for tips you just need to practice.  Knowing when to keep repairing a generator or to dip is a huge part of surviving. Don't run everywhere unless you know exactly where the killer is. You leave scratch marks that the killer can follow when you run. 
---
At rank 15 to 20 perks really don't matter that much in my opinion as long as the killer is the same rank(match making will be fixed shortly). But having good perks does help alot. Look up a guide to see what perks you want to get.
---
Going for hook saves you should wait until the killer fully leaves if possible so that it gives you and the person you save the best chance at getting away.
---
Also learn the maps, know where pallets are located and use them wisely. Also learn spots where you can run around so that the killer can't catch you. You will waste his time alot so that other people can get some generators done. 
---
If you have any specific questions just message me. Not all of us are completely toxic.
---
cause they merged SWF with Play As Survivor, so it would either 1. create a pointless swf lobby every time you play killer or 2. make a new swf lobby every time you switched to survivor
---
Just out of curiosity; What’s the risk for epileptic players ?
---
Well it will get removed most likely, but hey do you.
---
I try to make sure I'm aware of the closest hooks before it becomes and issue. The staircases tend to have them if you need them for the 3rd floor, that or drop down the hole, and there tends to be one nearby.
---
He’s not even that bad of a killer. He has more in his arsenal than the Legion. I hope he didn’t get a buff
---
It’s when you’re staring down a survivor on hook while staying next to hook
---
Eat my ass
---
Me: play killer for the first time
---
Post match chat: haha gg ez noob killer *t bag*
---
Nurse and Spirit share the same problem imo, when someone is really good with them you don't have any chance of surviving. All they need is a good headphone.
---
 I absolutely despise going against her. She is not fun to against in the slightest, since every chase is a coinflip. It doesn't feel like you get outplayed by her, you just guess wrong.
---
Also, if you need specific perks to have a chance against a killer,that clearly shows imbalance to me.
---
That hit he turned as he lunged
---
borrow time and we'll make it is like sprint burst and dead hard.
---
I've had to use iron grasp instead of my other perks
---
That makes no sense. They could make the button take you to the exact same screen as when you click play as Killer or play as Survivor. What you say would only happen if the devs are incompetent.
---
I only did it because all 4 of them keep using the flash light on me
---
When it happens to me as Mike they usually get away because after breaking the pallet I can't tell which way they've gone.
---
WHY IS THIS A THING?
---
Very nice, Keep it up!
---
Spirit doesn’t need a nerf, but she isn’t fun to play against. It feels so unrewarding when you get hit, then she uses her power 2 seconds later and get’s the second hit - which you can’t really do anything about without iron will. 
---
Speaking of iron will, I don’t run it, because I’d rather run different perks - it’s just not for me. I’ve seen loads of people that are just like ‘oHh DuDe JuSt rUn IrOn wIlL!’ That’s not the point though is it. If I have to to run a perk to counter every single killer then I’d need a lot more than 4 perk slots.
---
No. NEVER GIVE UP.
---
Survivors messaging me usually ruins my night and I get progressively more angry and toxic, just to win to avoid them talking shit post game.
---
Those are some strange things
---
Don’t perk shame me, i usually run no mither and self care w

"Some barebone shelf art I did for Dead by Daylight"
---
Maybe claiming you edited instead of making would prove less confussion, since your bassically saying you did this, which you didn't, and didn't even credit the original artist
---
Where's this 4 man gen?
---
I don’t think you have to buy maps. Survivors must be bought separately
---
Correct
---
&gt; It would be no different than hag traps though
---
Hag is the killer with who you don't chase like at all and despite that has the potential of a S tier killer.
---
Don't make any comparaison between her and Demo who is a chaser.
---
The word "bandwagoners" just made me puke a little.
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion! I love seeing everyone’s ideas as they workshop perks so I wanted to give it a shot.
---
There's this transgender Overwatch streamer named KolorBlind (Who, if you haven't guessed it, is indeed Colour Blind) who spent a long time advocating for better colour blind settings. They eventually did implement the settings, as she had a bit of a streamer platform to go off of. Maybe you can check them out, or even private message them on twitter for ideas. I'm sure she might have some useful input that would help. Best of luck to you. It definitely took a while for it to be implemented, but persistence was the key.
---
Mindgames are unreliable
---
not enough blood UwU
---
It's the music that does it for me.
---
Aren't you a noob unde that description?
---
Oh I know and I giggled at that line. 
---
I do wonder what this code looks like myself and if it could even be organized at this point without starting from square one. 
---
Also whether they thought it was going to be a big game or a small one, spaghetti code is generally caused by people who are new at programming and for some reason I've never been under the impression any of these guys are inexperienced. It's just odd decision making for a game whether a $20 game for 100 people or a dlc driven game for 100,000.
---
it was supposed to be a joke, but I didn't convey that good enough
---
Every. Single. Ticket/report. That I have made for the last 3 months minimum, has been given the exact same automated message, automatically set to “resolved” and never been further responded to short of “hey can you rate how well we helped you?” The ONLY ones I am ever responded to personally on are player reports. And even then they don’t seem to care. I’ve reported people using actual exploits and cheats, and never had a single one resolved despite video evidence. 
---
I’m so glad you get help. But a lot of us don’t get the same help, for literally the same issue you had and even worse ones. I once bought Franklins Demise in the Shrine for shards a long time ago (not the most recent time) only for it to suddenly disappear from my learned teachables, bloodwebs, and loadouts. I was basically told there was no evidence that I bought it and never given it back or refunded the shards I spent on it. For over a year I’ve lost BP and rank pips between lobbies and after games that I shouldn’t be losing. It’s never been resolved. Not even once. For a month long period more than 50% of my games I couldn’t escape through the exit gates. Never been resolved, never been compensated for the points I was wrongfully denied and essentially stolen from. Yet the killer gets points they didn’t earn. 
---
I literally reported the game giving me an infinite sprint burst, an unfair advantage against the killer, that I myself had to find a way to fix mid game so I could fairly play. But in the end it gave me such an unfair advantage for so long that I denied the killer the kill on myself and two others, when he likely could have killed all of us. They didn’t even read it. Just the same copy paste. What if I ended up reported for cheating? And then banned? There are people who intentionally abuse the sprint burst glitch, they could have assumed that’s what I was doing. But they literally didn’t even care to read the report. The response to my report was less than 3 minutes, another indication to support my assumption. 
---
Multiple people talking about the same subject isn’t spam. Spam is one person or persons posting the exact same post over and over and over again or posting the same fake content over and over again. 
---
Spam is defined as:
---
- *irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent on the Internet to a large number of recipients.*
---
They are not irrelevant. They are a discussion, and report of an issue to bring attention to it so it will be resolved faster. 
---
I am not spamming, I am not shouting (its literally the internet are you kidding me?), I am not “ruining” reddit. All I am ruining is the bubble of ignorance you want to stay in. We are post factual evidence of a serious problem, and discussing it with each other. Want it to go away? Tell them to fix it. Bottom line. You don’t have to click on it or look at it. Don’t sort by new posts then. Sort by best. That’s the advice you gave me just in reverse. Take your own advice then. And gone beyond the matter of, “they aren’t doing it fast enough.” 
---
You know what does ruin this subreddit? The constant toxicity I see on a day to day basis that goes completely ignored. But hey, even BHVR doesn’t care about that on their own game or forums so I guess I get it. 
---
Cut the crap. Trying to further argue your point is only making you, and them look worse. And frankly it’s hilarious. Your just giving us more proof that they and you, the subreddit mods, cannot handle criticism of any kind and don’t care about the community.
---
Haha, Me and my friends did this a while ago on Xbox just to mess with the killer and see which map we would get
---
If this shelf art thing is intended to be shared among other Steam users, then those artists are going to want credit, and you should definitely be asking for permission to do this.  
---
Don't just assume these people will be happy that you're using their art however you want without their consent. That's an incredibly shitty thing to do.
---
This is a veteran meme
---
Looks like you've been face camping a bunch. Expect salty messages when you do.
---
Oof.

How did you get insta healed after that down?

okay ty
---
Awesome! Exactly how I got mine lol
---
Preach
---
Once you get the hang of the hook locations, you shouldn't need it anymore, unless someone is sabotaging your hooks.
---
Read the description.
---
Balanced is really good on it, too bad my nancy hadnt gotten it yet
---
I do agree that pips should be weighted. That would prevent people from sand bagging one person in their swf and then getting free pips on the newb killer.
---
It's not "fun" but he may enjoy it from a survivor or killer POV. Stealth killers obviously have an advantage on the map, and good survivors get to enjoy a veritable smorgasbord of safe pallets.
---
Singular pieces of clothes of that rarity are 400, the full outfits are at discount because stonks.
---
I wish he'd give up on the whole "Ruin is neccessary" schtick especially when 90% of the matches I see it's destroyed real early or the survivors just power through it
---
The worst is when I start to type “Gg, Whoever was the Claudette who ran me for 3 whole gens was pretty awesome! Good job” but before I can fully type it I get flamed with “Wow man you’re a pretty sh*t nurse. Stop playing killer loser” 🙃
---
Fucking love it.
---
Second Wind is a high tier perk because it allows people to focus on gens much more readily. Don’t get me wrong, inner strength is sexy too, but don’t underestimate this blessing.
---
Each purple cosmetic piece is 400 auric cells, so you would need 1200, not 1100. You would’ve got more value if you just bought both outfits fully. But yes, you can still buy the left over cosmetics you want if you get more auric cells.
---
Low graphics tho
---
that's the thing though, you won't lose your rank in this scenario, this is a black pip unless he facecamped someone extensively or let them bleed out on the ground.
---
Most of the individual cosmetic pieces cost 400 cells but if you buy the full set instead of separately you get a 10% discount so it only costs 1080.
---
Ok but can the sound play as soon as she starts phasing instead of like 3 seconds after because I'll be against a spirit and think I lost her then bam I'm dead
---
There are a few. Gens in Killer shack for example or in Autohaven or crotus penn
---
Hahahahahahaha! Good one. Winning WILL NOT stop that :)
---
They aren't too terrible as long as you got some decent add-ons to burn and knock them out around rank reset.
---
does sabotaging a hook alert the killer?
---
If you're asking why I mentioned it, I wanted to explain why I'd be playing at brown ranks when I play a decent amount, and why my opinion on the new player experience should be considered informed.
---
If you're asking what's different as to why I made the switch, I had friends playing DBD on pc and not on console, but at this point the main reason I don't come back to console are the frame rates. Trying to hit spinning survivors on console made me into a god at hitting spinning on PC, and that doesn't even touch how wonky skill checks can be.
---
It's easy to avoid flashlights.
---
And don't get mad at people for calling you out on an action you did..
---
Your info ain't worth spit tho
---
Those perks are really good
---
You could do push ups? Idk I just watch YouTube.
---
* Arrogant, unpleasant and eccentric.  
---
* Chooses his moderators based on who can kiss his ass the best.  
---
* Dismissive of any opinion that isn't his own.  
---
* Complains about survivors playing optimally when he's killer and wishes for survivors to play optimally when he's survivor, in a painstakingly hypocritical manner, mind you.  
---
* Genuinely believes he's far better at the game than he really is, and unfortunately his fans believe it too, meaning he has stopped improving at the game, because in his mind, which is reinforced by his fan-base, why would he need to?  
---
All in all, he's a great guy, please give him money, suggest a build for him to play, and watch him complain about the build being bad while seemingly refusing to use it as it was obviously intended.
---
This just happened to me as well. I couldn't wiggle as well when I got picked up.
---
Except streamers are their own bosses, So they can decide what they deem appropriate.
---
Nothing in the job of "Streamer" means you cannot vent.
---
Who is the maker of the professional streamer rulebook?
---
Yeah I guess but it’s still annoying not having any rank progress regardless and it being negated constantly. 
---
It would definitely be worse if matchmaking was how it used to be. I’d be salty asf if i was stuck with low ranks for eternity.
---
Lol yea i usually play on my phone.
---
Finally someone who uses that white board meme correctly
---
The Nightmare, obviously, stronger than ghostface and a lot more fun to play with a good map pressure
---
Don't forget that when doing a viewer build and he loses with it he just calls it bad instead of knowing the point of it (not including meme builds). He also doesn't admit to making mistakes as killer either and blames it on everything else.
---
Unless you tell everyone everytime in lobby you have no right to complain. And even then I wouldn't count on some random to find and cleanse them all, especially if they wait with cleansing so they can charge up Inner Strength again after they got hurt.
---
I can’t speak for you on PC and have no idea how that works. That being said as a PS4 player I can confirm that even my PS4 has issues with how demanding DBD is. It’s a running joke that PS4’s sound like a plane taking off when DBD is running. The game is indeed very demanding on whatever platform you’re on. Not having a good connection seriously and even can adversely affect your ability to play. And the console ports are all automatically having issues because they have previously stated that they do not care about the console ports nearly as much as the PC version. 
---
Can’t really say much else like I said. The only thing I can recommend it asking PC players about it. Hope some of this helped at least.
---
I want to be able to do that "running a thumb along your throat" gesture as a Killer.
---
The higher rarity changes only affect Items, Add-ons and Offerings, and the difference isn't that great due to the limited number of higher rarity Unlockables we have available.
---
It does not affect Perks.
---
But why you dc just stay and get your points and leave
---
at least they can’t say “gg ez” that’s what matters...
---
And permission. You'll make sure you have their permission as well.
---
Gonna be honest with you, I love Ghostface, probably my favorite of all the killers and my go to for a good time as Survivors will almost always meme with you when you play him, but if you're looking to climb ranks and stomp people mercilessly, go with Freddy. Freddy is in the same tier as Billy and spirit, really good in purple/red ranks and all around bullshit to play against since his lunge range is longer than it seems and dream pallets give survivors a false sense of safety, while dream snares deny loops hard af. Both are really fun but Freddy is who you want for climbing.
---
of course the first build sucks, it has Self-Care in it.
---
With the demo ultra rare item, with the good timing, you can break the pallet and hit the survivor at the same time with the shred
---
I've actually seen an animation of the Huntress kazotsky kicking.
---
It’s LITERALLY one extra click of the mouse.
---
People will complain about everything...
---
You mean my third most wanted killer, Pyramid Headboi might become a possibility again?

100% perfect
---
What I was playing the game that I bought with my money and they're going to tell me what I can and can't do
---
Man, why would anyone hate on them and try to drive them away? They more players = the more money the company gets = the more content we get later on. 
---
If we never get new players then the game dies. Me and my partner could still be considered new players cause we only got the game a few weeks before Legion dropped.
---
You still have to of console
---
GGEZ I guess. Matchmaking is currently bugged, it's horrible
---
Ghostface is also up there with Billy and huntress tbh. He's not a bad killer by any means you can climb the ladder with him. Although to be fair it'd be easier with Freddy
---
Well when i found him at the hatch, he just closed it and downed me. I would have stayed if he just put me on a fucking hook but he just left me on the floor, and I pretty much just wanted to leave already.
---
Dude fuuuuck yeah !!  I’d love that!!
---
Nightmare. Why? Simple. Stronger.
---
He just personally's man.  It's a personally thing you wouldn't understand.
---
Damn you’re a sensitive little guy aren’t you? Lolol grow up.
---
**LEAVE MS. PIGGY ALONE**
---
Both are okay, I still don't like the nightmare and would choose every time ghost face.
---
Can’t grow up if I ain’t 18 Douche
---
Best times
---
Old Freddy was the only killer I saw get CONSISTENT 4Ks.
---
Times have changed. In this year alone we got 2 new top tier killers, the most expensive license to date, and fucking Ash. It’s been a good year.
---
you mean the worst add ons for a flashlight?
---
This. People like to say "just learn the mindgame lol" but as a survivor with basically zero feedback about Spirit's position it doesn't feel like a mindgame. It's not some reactable 50/50 scenario, in 90% of cases the only thing that matters is which side of the window/pallet the spirit decides to go to, which as a survivor you have no control over. And she only has to guess right twice for a down while you have to guess right basically every time or you're just fucked
---
Classic
---
If it makes you feel any better the pallets are all massively unsafe on that map so survivors kind if fucked there.  I played Trapper on there yesterday for the first time.  I had some success with trapping the drop down vaults on top of the stairs loops as well as some of the very narrow hallways.
---
well you could take a piss or get a drunk in those 2 minutes and still keep your points
---
ORA!
---
They’re just salty survivors, just let them get mad and p’ay the way you want, camping is not a bannable offense
---
Not at all. It's not that great of a perk since it's like noed 2.0
---
Console players play on console
---
That bad?
---
I’m everyone else
---
Well yes if the five gens are done the gates are open the killer dont have other options
---
Combine it with Thanataphobia. If you want to take advantage of the healing debuff as well, you can run sloppy butcher along with the two. The other perk(s) are really your choice (:
---
Should I stay or should I go
---
You're welcome
---
Curving takes a lot of practice, i found spirit and nurse much easier to learn than him. You have to know exactly where the survivor is going, know the map and layout of tiles, and know when to m1 and when to go for a chainsaw. His power is definitely less complicated but you have to have a ton of game knowledge to use it effectively
---
Unless it's me then I relentlessly teabag on GF
---
I was
---
Ah, swf, a fun balanced gameplay. It does look like fun though, i just feel bad for the killer.
---
Lolol you hurl insults around because people call you out on your low quality post then you get all salty about it. People like you are the problem not with just the online gaming community, but society in general. You my friend ,are a certified dumb fuck. Congrats
---
I'd say the Nightmare because he has 2 play styles. Pallets and Dream Snares are both viable and incredibly fun. The map pressure definitely helps him out too.
---
Is that a perk or item?
---
&gt; And there's a good reason as to why they're usually more popular.
---
But they're literally not?
---
Ninja, Tyler1... These people are not your beams of positivity that your looking for.. Seriously what platform are you watching streams on? Top streamers are never fake, Even DbD... right now Tru3 is top with almost double that of Otz....
---
Really not sure where you are looking to be honest.
---
already done
---
Yeah, they'll do that. They won't take that into account when they message you. Either way, seems like you're still a bit new and face camping definitely won't earn you points for your bloodweb, typically you'd want to move onto another generator and start working on your next hook, if you want the most points by the end. A survivor unhooking also isn't bad for you (multiple hooks instead of one hook will get you more blood points), where all the generators getting done leads to the game ending sooner than you'd like. Ultimately, DBD is a game about time management and decision making.
---
Yeah right now adept shap is terrible I unlocked it the first day of the bug and you basically just have to remove the obsession from play ASAP which renders all his perks useless so basically M1 killer myers.
---
Why’s that?
---
You’re not a clown, you’re the entire circus
---
I get these kinds of matches as Killer too. You just have to take each match for what it is and try to have fun whether you win or lose. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
To be fair one of them was using all lvl 1 perks and wake up
---
I haven't gotten Q&amp;Q yet on Nancy unfortunately, but god damn do I love inner strength. How are you liking Better Together or Fixated however? I find Fixated niche cause I tend to sneak repair gens and walk away as soon as terror radius comes by me, rinse and repeat. I feel it fits into my playstyle a lot.
---
You’re never going to get it the way they want to.
---
My advice? Ignore them. You’ll get plenty of messages but seriously, fuck that. 
---
In my previous game, I killed everyone and they were one of those tbagging players. I ended up getting a message “I reported you”.
---
Bullshit like that is very common. I’m a person who plays survivor as well as the killer and I __can__ understand frustration on both sides.
---
If you play as a survivor, you don’t want to get hooked. So they get angry and send a message or something. Just let them be. Play the way in whatever way you want.
---
You want to tunnel? Do it.
---
You want to camp? Do it. 
---
Every tactic that you use __could__ be countered. 
---
Camping killer? Survivors can gen rush.
---
Tunneling killer? Survivors can gen rush.
---
So the point of my reply: 
---
Play the way you want and don’t let anybody tell you any different
---
Seriously, if someone told me a year ago I'd need Freddy in red ranks to have fun I'd have laughed them out of the room. Times are strange for DBD.
---
I never let go of the mouse, I just had really bad luck. REALLY bad.
---
Wtf, so you're whole team fails at what they are supposed to do and then you cry because your freebie escape was found before you could so you DC because you were outplayed. Says it all really. You lost, end of, you and your team. The hatch is not a free escape, you have to find it first and get out before the killer sees you. 
---
Title needs to be changed to
---
"Me and my team failed miserably so I threw a childish tantrum and disconnected. I need validation because I can't handle thinking of myself as a bad loser." There all better.
---
Deep wound is a status effect that comes with the perk borrowed time and the legion. When a survivor is put Into deep wound, they have to mend. If they do not mend before the orange bar at the bottom is gone they go from the injured state to the dying state. When you mend you lose deep wound but you remain injured. 
---
Aura reading is actually pretty basic, as killer you see the auras of generators at all times and auras of hooks when you pick up a dying survivor. There are many perks for both killer and survivor that reveal auras. For example, plunderers instinct is a survivor perk that reveals boxes when in a certain range and kindred reveals the auras of all survivors to your teammates and reveals the killers aura if they are in range with the hooked survivor. 
---
With time you’ll begin to understand the game better but don’t hesitate to ask any questions, I’d be more than happy to help :)
---
My go-to excuses for failing checks are "ruin", "3 o'clock skill check" and "oh fuck, it's Meyers!"
---
I feel bad for whatever survivors she faces next. It's not gonna be a fun game
---
That guy darkshadow is a huge asshole. Why are you playing with him?
---
oh man that really hurts. Do you and op suck one another off regularly or is that just a monthly thing?
---
Its a great map to offer if you are the killer ;)
---
Thanks man, I'm starting to get that. I was hiding in EW1 yesterday keeping a close eye on a hooked survivor, and of course someone went for the save and I hooked them too. How is that my fault? They took a risk and I got 'em.
---
Thank you
---
Hmmm, not sure that's how this meme format works
---
Because you get messages from time to time, I don't believe they all were toxic. More I think you camp them on hook
---
Maybe not play at 3am then
---
Eleven is that you?
---
If I buy another cell pack I’ll have 1400 and if buy the left over cosmetics I’ll still be missing one cosmetic between both of them and have about 200 cells left.
---
So your whole team needs to leave all totems alone so you can use your one perk? Actually yeah good idea, please teams do this. 
---
        
---
Signed "Killer that likes to use NOED and wants more opportunities"
---
Ah that’s fair. Thinking bout it there’s that Damn double bus/ vehicle loop. No where near as annoying as haddonfield though. That’s almost a guaranteed stress fest for the killer
---
Most of the pallets have low walls making them super safe to loop you can waste alot of the killers time if you know what your doing
---
Ah okay, thanks!
---
Better together is practically useless, because you should be aware if someone is getting chased into your gen and doubling on gens is inefficient. The only use is to combo with prove thyself, which is an even bigger waste, really. Fixated is great if you make smart preemptive decisions.
---
It's probably because the way he walks and how he is a literal monster instead of a human it's more a placebo effect as he still moves as fast as the trapper and wraith etc etc, for the lunge just move left or right ez peezy
---
I think ingenuity percentages need a change so that it's 15/30/45
---
How is that being outplayed?You're actually fucking retarded. Sounds like an entitled killer main to me, but whatever.
---
How about an add-on where as you travel any survivor within a certain range has their aura revealed to you for like 3 seconds after you get out?
---
Next time I will indeed get drunk
---
He has the same base speed as an uncloaked wraith (115%)
---
He did? Huh.
---
If you want to play by the “rules”, you should hook someone and just find someone else.
---
 
---
But that is what makes me angry, rules.
---
The survivors would want you to play by the rules but __will__ tell you that you suck at the end of the match. 
---
I’m not going to lie, if I play as a survivor and a killer tunnels me, oh god I hate it. But I let it be. __After all, how sad can someone be if they let a virtual game affect their emotions?__
---
Decided to check out the stats on this. 
---
Counted 21 failed attempts, and since there is a 75% chance of failing for each attempt, the chances of this are 0.75^21=0.23%, or about 1 in 420 chance. 
---
Crazy bad luck, but actually not as bad as I thought it would be. Would probably see this more often if not for the trapper almost always being close enough to get you after you hit one of his traps
---
What the hell, this is crazy. I'm already mad then it takes 7 times but this is a pain in the ass!
---
I think they should change it to 10 times maximum, because this is simply bullshit
---
To be fair, I think she was in or nearing Shred distance. That may have bought her some time she needed.
---
Me and the boys jamming out to the Micheal Myers Tier 3 sound at 3am
---
It was Survivor Pudding haha, I just didn't wait for it to reveal before taking the screenshot
---
meant a water or something, but sure you can get drunk :)
---
I had dumb teammates, and it just so happened that the doors spawned right next to eachother and the killer was on top of the hatch, right next to the door. That's not being outplayed, that's just a stupid coincidence.
---
Ok thanks
---
hhhh its hard to enjoy the clip when u dont look behind you and waste pallets T\_T
---
Cheers to that!
---
Figured they were going to run into some brutal killers soon enough lol. My first survivor game was not a pleasant one at all XD best not to put others through that.
---
Freddy for viability GF for fun in my opinion

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d7ciya/anyone_know_when_the_hotfix_is_supposed_to_happen/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
When you enter a custom game and play, then leave to play normally, the game does not save any of your progress so you lose all bloodpoints or levels on killers/survivors that you do that day. This happened to me this morning as all my progress from yesterday after playing a custom game was not saved, so my level 45 billy was put back to level 33. Hopefully they are working on a fix. PC btw.
---
You insta downvote everything I say because you're a pathetic nerd who wants to feel good at the game, but you're not
---
Ik I'm late af, I'm at work, but when I play dbd I try to be a distraction, I run around with a flashlight/insta heal and try to waste all the time I can so I tend to self heal mid chase alot, a medkit helps but I'm used to the time of sc now. If I had the new dlc, then I would replace sc with inner strength
---
I am glad i am not the only one who wants to hear him say "bitch" in game
---
This happens to me too, every damn game i play as killer...
---
Poor guy.
---
Is that why you have -5 everywhere? I pity you if you care about those internet points lil kiddo.
---
Thanks, yea I wanted to try that but my rl friend doesn’t have the Saw dlc 🙀😢
---
Are you implying Otz is "fake"? Based on what? The fact that he's not a toxic piece of shit?  
---
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you might have some weird, deep-seeded trust issues.  
---
Also, my dude, what the fuck was that camgirl analogy? You couldn't have it more backwards even if you went through a full-body prolapse.  
---
It would be unprofessional for a camgirl *not* to have her boobs out. If selling your body is your occupation, it's literally your job to put it on display.
---
Yea sure I threw in some ad hominem, but the point still stands
---
I just wanna hear him say One liners ending with “BITCH”
---
It’s an ultra rare addon for medkits, it allows you to fully heal from any health state, but instantly uses the whole medkit. It also reduces the medkits charges by half
---
Oh no, I was laughing the entire time. I also missed an axe that ended up hitting someone I wasn't aiming for.
---
Wasn't that Saw 8 and Jigsaw? I don't know who you're referring to when talking about saw 7
---
It really is
---
You lost, how hard is it too understand this? 
---
But it's the old "my team was bad not me, it isn't my fault". You still lost as a team. I'm sure you'd take every advantage over the killer you could and not give yourself up because the game spawned a crappy version of the map for the killer.
---
Stop crying and either accept your loss or play another game because this isn't ever going to stop happening.
---
Says the person who actually bothers to downvote lmao
---
What about the other 3 characters...?
---
Everything about him is si boring though, his voice, the way he ralks about the game, his personality, his stream... I don't understand how people watch him.
---
I also run that, my main build is dance with me, quick and quiet, lithe, and self care. I love the set up because it lets me get around so fast and unnoticed
---
Sorry I didn't know I haven't had Internet for 2 months now so I'm abit behind
---
What show just that? Or is it a movie?
---
Xbox: Can’t play with my friends, we all get in the same lobby, ready up and then end up in different games or 1 gets in a game and the others stay in the lobby
---
That happened to me as well and I have 2k hours in this game
---
I hit them through a pallet?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d7cq08/connection_issue/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Its got a lot of safe pallets
---
Inner Strength, Head On, Decisive Strike and Quick and Quiet
---
Abetment is too strong. Chase mechanics can be weird sometimes, and imagine being a 110% huntress and seeing 112% survivor run away from you. Even at 115% killer it will take ages to catch up to someone. Nah, speed buffs for survivors shouldnt exist imo.
---
Yeah the "total of one health state" is a trick. It has to be in one go from testing my friends and I did in a KYF match
---
Man I mean you roasted that guy to shit with that one roast. He needs an ice pack after that burn.
---
You know what. You’re right. I’m sorry for calling you names. My standpoint is different, I believed you said something that was what I perceived as dumb and I felt it to be necessary to call you out for it, but I went overboard and insulted you. My apologies.
---
Coldwin is not that bad imo but the all swamp maps can burn in holy hell fire
---
What makes you think that? It's probably the best map for killers and looping as survivor is really easy on that map
---
I believe when multiple survivors heal another survivor they both take credit for the heal meaning both get 50% which is why it doesn't activate, you need 100% credit of the heal
---
I dont feel like he runs any faster. He's kind of a weak killer imo. Either that or every single one I've played against is complete and utter garbage as a player, but I dont think that's the case.
---
Guys keys ain't broken neither are mori's. Now the one we need to fight is legion.
---
I cri everytime
---
**Platform: PS4**
---
**Audio:**
---
- Firecrackers and party starters will sometimes cause the Killer to have the muffled audio/deafened effect for the entire duration of the game. 
---
**Visual:**
---
- Hair for female characters disappears from certain angles and during certain animations, making them appear bald. Occurs from both the Survivor’s point of view and while playing as Killer (ex. during pickups, pallet drops). Witnessed on both Nancy and Kate so far. 
---
- Dream pallets don’t appear as an obstacle to the camera while playing as Survivor, allowing the camera to clip through it.
---
Yes DL is confirmed to crash at 5 stacks
---
reread what i say
---
Second wind is good af. I dont know if it needs a nerf but holy fuck is it good
---
Sad but true
---
This is during normal daytime hours.
---
My original idea was terror radius, but that wouldn't work with stealth killers. Then I was going to do a certain radius, but it once again ruins stealth killers. The only thing I have left is chases. If it wasnt as clunky it would probably work better
---
I would love Emotes in DBD  like the ones from r/identityv
---
Same. Only 1 match on Hawkins as well
---
Yeah, you're right.
---
Making fun of you for caring about internet points and actually voting on posts doesn't mean I care about the points, fucktard. It's just another thing to make fun of you for
---
I can just continue to focus on you being a literal baby at this game who hasn't been above rank 8 lmao
---
My favorite game!!!!!
---
So if I get on and notice I have bad internet I should just dc?
---
Agreed
---
Inner strength, head on, quick and quiet, and that new nancy perk that lets you heal in lockers
---
I did and I gave a theory on why it isn't working for me it's been pretty eh?
---
same thing happens to me but its obnoxious freddy or ghostface lunge that sounds like a whiff but it's so delayed :/
---
damn. I like to believe it's a "bug" that is going to be hotfixed
---
So if a killer needs certain perks to have a chance against survivors its unbalanced also right?
---
You got beat by a Legion, arguably one of the worst Killers. Doesn't matter what it is, the Killer can camp. The ONLY person who broke a rule here, is YOU. Therefore, I hope to see you punished appropriately, good day!
---
&gt; Are you implying Otz is "fake"? Based on what? The fact that he's not a toxic piece of shit?
---
What the fuck are you even on about? Where on earth did I say that?
---
I don't even watch him, He is just the second highest person.
---
&gt;If I didn't know any better, I'd say you might have some weird, deep-seated trust issues.
---
Oh look a reddit psychologist. Yeah - No. You can fuck off with your dumb assumptions.
---
&gt;Also, my dude, what the fuck was that camgirl analogy? You couldn't have it more backwards even if you went through a full-body prolapse.
---
Quite literally what it is.
---
You're tuning into a streamers channel, They get to dictate the content that happens there and how they behave. Don't like it? Don't tune in. To say "It's unprofessional" because you don't like it is dumb as fuck.
---
&gt;It would be unprofessional for a camgirl not to have her boobs out. If selling your body is your occupation, it's literally your job to put it on display.
---
Oh look at that and twitch streamers sell their **personalities** it would be unprofessional to act like you don't have one!
---
The double Head On! 
---
I kinda like getting teams like this as long as it's a meme game. Everyone getting pips and points
---
But you have to heal someone to get the perk to work anyway. I don’t believe the perk really increases or decreases any gen focus time. It’s the same as Inner Strength imo. You still have to do a thing that takes a bit of time to get an eventual heal off but you have to jump your hoops which is fair.
---
well this hasn't aged well
---
That is inner strength but thanks!
---
Happy Cake day! :D
---
(Also, happened to me with a group of swf consisting of a rank 15, 20, and 20. They did not know how to crouch against Hag and wasted pallets, blew up gens. Adorable but kinda annoying since this was a laggy game as well :(
---
wow dude… i literally said i did it in coop for more than one total health state for me.
---
have you read what you wrote
---
I'll have thine know that "Windstorm" exists....for a reason. That plus "Swift Hunt" makes him a fast horrifying killer.
---
I like your thinking with ds because I can’t get tunnelled thank you!
---
What the hell happened here
---
*my video that I want to spam because I put no egfot into my videos
---
I would say I have to agree.  I've only been in the community for a few months now, but the guy is not an ideal streamer for me.  Like most have said, he just brings excuses for his loses.  Always talks in a condescending tone, whether it be to his viewers or to the survivors he's playing against.  That last point also makes me feel like he's a little arrogant.  Not the biggest concern, but the dude never hosts anyone when he ends his streams.  Never understood why he doesn't. But I don't know why a streamer as big as himself doesn't either.
---
I mean, most people don't tryhard in SWF so it's pretty easy to lose - especially because you never want to leave your friend to die so you might die when you don't have to.
---
Yes I know you did it in coop so I'm telling you why it most likely didn't work which is that both survivors take 50% of the credit meaning it doesn't activate second wind
---
Oh I’ve needed that for so long thank you!
---
Demogorgon is not faster at all, perhaps his animations from a survivors perspective just look weird because he is not human
---
I'll reply here, the reason I went with blonde is because of the gasp mask head :P
---
Right now I'm a 2 because I DC'd a beads spirit earlier but we're all 1s. Albeit we have insane hours in the game
---
New player here, how do I find out the characters lore?
---
That’s a first hook death for Jane
---
No, I mean the 5-8 range.
---
\*Sees this meme or variants posted literally daily since the ST perk reveal\*
---
\*Has yet to play a SINGLE game with killer running Iron Maiden\*
---
it's not clear. Are you saying you need to do one health stat in one shot or to cumulate for a total of one full health stat in multiple healing ?

I personally find Freddy boring as crap for some reason. Good? Of course, one of the best. But when ever I get his daily ritual, I either absolutely cringe at the thought of having to do it or I just scrap it for another. Of course, that’s just me. Some could argue that he’s both one of strongest *and* one of the most fun.
---
Just based on your post history, you still seem pretty new.  Survivors are the power role in the game still, if a killer makes a few mistakes that's pretty much gg.
---
They hated him because they told him the truth.
---
Not that I agree with DCing, though. You can just dick around to keep a low rank in mid ranks without wasting other people's time.
---
Should be cominh this fall, they said...
---
You should consider Botany, you heal yourself in 21 seconds and the others in 11 seconds..it's pretty good
---
Yep, nearly every pallet on it is safe
---
I understand the stream setup anger...Every...damn...time. Even with all the bugs that happen, and I’m sure you can agree, I love streaming no matter what.
---
Fuck no it isn't, not unless you're Nurse or (arguably) Spirit. This isn't 2018 anymore, that map has shifted entirely
---
Love that you watched the details, the forced smile and all that, since from the momment she entered that place she was in a dire situation without even the entity.
---
Platform ps4 
---
Bug type in game 
---
Second wind doesn’t seem to work. I will fully heal someone from injured state to normal state and it will not activate at all.
---
I've been seeing that bald Kate after I hook her for quite a while (probably a month ago or more) but never while she wasnt hooked
---
Yeah he’s the only one I had time to grind for, I don’t even play him much but I loved his haha
---
To be honest if you aren't able to see the bright vibrant red of scratches from across the map now (and aren't color-blind) you should consider adjusting your monitor settings to proper levels. I've played 2k hrs since launch and I've not had a problem seeing scratchmarks on any setpiece my PC rendered in the distance no matter how far since the very first scratchmarks rework that made them a lot more visible. I understand the concern, but as a killer main I don't believe the colors they would need to implement for the 3 color-blind types would be any more visible than the bright neon signs I see now on my monitor.
---
Doesn't sound too different from what we have now. If we have separate modes we can at least guarantee that one of them isn't going to pair you up with people who are way above or below you.
---
Second wind is a pretty normal perk, i would rather just get healed by the person unhooking me than using a slot for 2 heals per game
---
You need to do one health state by yourself I THINK  meaning if you heal someone with another survivor it doesn't count towards it and I think if you're even one millisecond off with healing you don't get it.
---
Why wouldn't I camp at end game? Did you want me to wave goodbye as you walk out of the fuckin door?
---
Autohavens H shaped map is the worst in the game imo. Killer can just find 3 gens on one third of the map and patrol until they win.
---
How is this on the same plane as bazookas? It’s a simple gesture that could make more people smile, like, imagine someone dancing by a pallet then insta-hatchet happens then a mori. That’d be some hilarious shit
---
They proceeded to crawl around in the area out of bounds while I had to wait, they didn't seem to be aware of the bug as they were just as confused as me in post-game chat
---
Sometimes I’ll put TTV in my name...Ironically it’s in my reddit name (Lost my other account and wanted to keep LightGhillie) usually I will put TTV in my name if I just feel like it to see who will stop by, has gotten interesting viewers before (People asking for bathwater lol) and I do that at the moment because I am still working on trying to build a brand on other platforms aside from Youtube.
---
Try Monitor&amp;Abuse and Save the best for last, then Hex: Ruin and bbq or discordance. I have lots of fun with this build
---
now I see kate with different eyes
---
Technically a little less just because one offering doesn't make it have a 100% chance to go to that map. And the chances of not going to any of those maps are really slim but that would be so hilarious if they went to another map
---
This bug has been happening for ages now, I believe they don't even have a way to fix it it more fixes it self when a update occurs or it stays
---
I like it. the map is easy to understand once you get the initial layout, the aesthetic is cool, it's spacious enough to not feel awfu like lerys or the lab, the basement is always in the same spot, and most of the pallets are decent.
---
This looks traced but I’ll stay in my own lane
---
He said that he cared more about the button to switch between survivor and killer more than stayi g in the swf after every game.
---
It would work like what we have now. We've all been playing ranked mode this entire time, whether we want to or not. Which is stupid. And I honestly can't name another game that does this.
---
So this game being balanced enough for a ranked mode is a moot point. The only real issue is separating the player base.
---
Definitely not the worst thing am I right? Hillbilly never feels unfair but man as a strictly solo player sometimes my teammates are the real killer
---
...hes the worst killer in the game.  Only way you're using that chainsaw is if you're camping hooks, or if you get a survivor seriously out of position.  He becomes the most basic of m1 killers after that. At least wraith can be "invisible" 😂
---
I don’t think OP is saying you shouldn’t camp in endgame they’re saying that it sucks when you managed to loop the killer for all the gems and get killed in the end
---
Spirit = Nurse on a wheelchair, change my mind lol
---
It really is. People say I’m tunneling when they make stupid choices like saving someone the second I hook them and trying to loop me when they just got unhooked. I had someone get unhooked and immediately run straight at me, and then message me calling me a tunneling PoS. I really don’t get the mentality of surv mains.
---
I use all my items/offerings, well the good ones at least before prestige. Spent hard earned blood points that I don't really want to go to waste.
---
Does their rank really matter though? I've seen rank 18s play better then rank 1s lol.
---
what does that have to do with what I said?
---
remember when the game dudnt exist
---
There are better perks, that is all.
---
Besides it's highly dependant on the map, on maps like Lery's is pretty good since there are crows everywhere, but in others it hardly matters.
---
I have been protecting the white rank survivors with my life as a red rank. It honestly makes the game more fun. Especially if the killer is also white rank.
---
&gt; its evident most people don't take this game seriously
---
how naive you really are. how many threads do you see about killers whining that "SWF is an exploit" or "I got bullied so I brought nurse/spirit with mori" threads daily in this subreddit? People constantly take this game seriously and treat it like an E-Sport they care so much. That's why there's so much shit talk in post game chat.
---
Whispers is just better for tracking in general. You always know if a survivor is close by and when there is one left and the hatch is closed it really helps find that last survivor. Its pretty useless unless its T3 though.
---
That being said there isn't a rule you couldn't use both, like survivors running Balanced Landing with Dead Hard.
---
That's why I try not to worry about getting too many good event items on any characters that aren't already P3'd because I know eventually they'll go to waste, even if I don't prestige them now, I'll want to someday.

They’re coming with dedicated servers
---
Which map did you end up going to?
---
damn that sucks actually
---
Didn’t know that, thanks for the correction
---
Alright. No shitty unfun offerings? Remove map offerings. All they’re used for is making the map really bad for killers. Azarovs key, strode key, red forest. Killers can try to get shelter woods or one of the few good maps for killers but hell, survivors will still have a better chance of getting their map
---
I think it used to be faster, but it's still a lot faster than the normal vault.
---
“I sure hope no one else cleanses totems so I can use my inner strength! After all, they shouldn’t weaken my powerful, niche perk!”
---
“WhY iS nOeD aCtIvE tHeY sHoUlD hAvE bEeN cLeAnSiNg ToTeMs”
---
The human - overly altruistic teammates
---
Dog - me in "Oh shit mode"
---
The fire - Myers stalking all of us
---
?
---
I just got a game with a killer lagswitching that hard it booted me off the game. Wouldn't want to get banned for somebody else's mistake tho.
---
I find if you let the killer get a hook every once in a while, they're less likely to D/C
---
“I think we did a pretty good job so far”
---
Hmm yeah, makes sense if it means that.
---
Really scared of givin out your steam info huh
---
I remember you was conflicted
---
How can a map with 3 infinites be bad as survivor?
---
He's more stealthy since your stealth ability acts on a recharge unlike Myers, where once you level up Evil Within it's harder to surprise people. But you have a separate stalk meter for each survivor so you can't steamroll them like Myers
---
Who's Joe
---
Best chapter is the Stranger Things chapter. Its a huge license and since they got the license now there is nothing impossible now. With such a  license of a huge show there is nothing in the way to get other licenses.
---
Joe Mama
---
Well I liked it
---
I think he means joey
---
Imo tunnelling is when you either are chasing someone for TOO LONG or when someone is being unhooked and you purposely go for that person
---
Gottem
---
I thought this was a shit post
---
using instaheal is shameful enough, tbag just makes you sadder
---
He means joe mama
---
No, i main survivier :) and if i play killer, i play Legion or...daliy killer xD... and i hate haddonfield, its just a poorly made map...its so easy to get distrance, its..just.. so badly designed for 90% of killers...and its so badly designed for most of them, that its even boring to play against them on that map.
---
It’s an error that used the wrong icons for the rewards, they fixed it, but rn there seems to be another error with the icons that use the unknown icon instead.
---
the cake charm looks just like the gruesome gateau offering
---
You redrew the perk icons just so the art style would match Steve... that's some fucking dedication to your memes
---
Oof and thought I was childish alright buddy
---
That is such bullshit
---
There once was a man named Walt Disney....
---
And that's where furries come from.
---
Healing somebody is pretty inevitable.
---
YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN’T HIDE BITCH
---
Yes, i Shaw go back in time and murder him
---
I like sometimes to run Bond (from Dwight) instead of selfheal, but it depends on my mood
---
Yea I forgot to do apologies, but I forgot to mention the survivors were pretty chill about it after the game had ended so I guess I was not that salty after the game.
---
Honestly Joe mains are the worst lol
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9j3heYZAk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9j3heYZAk8)   
---
This was all I could think of. This is you.
---
Healing somebody is inevitable, totems are not necessarily inevitable on average.
---
Your post kind of implies you knew going in. It sucks having shit internet, but plugging in directly with an ethernet can help a bit.
---
Also, once servers come out it's just going to be affecting you.
---
It just wastes time, 40 seconds with sloppy butcher, when you can spend time working on a gen for half of its progress. If healing is so important, you can bring a med kit, much faster, space for another useful perk. Bond, find teammates to heal you, plus other useful information, amazing for solo, or inner strength for a fast heal, doesn’t matter if they have sloppy, counters noed and totems give you plenty of points anyways.
---
Like I said do you. If you consider sucking your homie off childish then that’s your call.
---
First time I played spirit, I was up against at least one other new player. Couldn't go down the hallway in Hawkins lab and thought it was a glitch till I yooped out of spirit mode and the survivor was right there. I'm pretty sure they were just as surprised as I was because it took several seconds for either of us to react properly
---
Yeah and when theres an angry killer mad at an SWF, theres a teabagging SWF moon walking out the gate. If they took it seriously they would just leave normally. Likewise, when a lot of killers get 4Ks, tons will fuck with the survivors in multiple ways. Such as nodding furiously at the sacrifice camera. The players play silly when the game itself is trying to be serious.
---
I'm talking about the tone of the game. Nobody takes that seriously. Therefore, why wouldn't a winning enjoy silly dance emotes? Because it might break their immersion? In THIS game? Sounds like an outlier's problem.
---
Do people get angry at losing? Sure. Its a terribly balanced game revolving on a lot of rng. I'm not arguing that. And I'm only supporting dance emotes for survivors, not whatever the hell you quoted for whatever reason.
---
The 90s called they want they’re joke back
---
oh cool then I can delete this, thanks
---
I don’t know that guy, but you should go get some ointment on your ass cuz you butthurt
---
I mean yeah you can have that. But rank really matters. Hit red ranks and that will be very rare to see.
---
You're such a condescending jumped up little cunt aye. Have fun dude.
---
You keep on saying it’s cheating
---
No it's only for walking
---
M'k thanks, have a nice day
---
At later stages, the more you see them, the more you hate them. They take up slots for useful items for the killer you're currently leveling
---
Whispers is way more versatile and accomplishes pretty much the same thing, *if* you understand how to use it properly, so it's generally considered better in most situations(on top of it also being a nearly-undisputed meta perk for pretty much every killer).
---
This game last night was perhaps the most exciting game I've ever played. This is not sarcastic. Allow me to tell my thoughts:
---
I saw all four of you join the lobby. You packed the flashlights and toolkit. I could tell who your runner was and you planned to stun lock me. I did not dodge. Instead, I put Franklin's on my bar, replaced Ruin with Devour, and hit ready.
---
Ironworks of Misery. Already a mapped stacked against me, but I did not waiver. 
---
Immediately I could spot your runner. I gave chase for a time, took your flashlight. We chased for a time until I found more of your team. For fifteen minutes, we danced. Jumped windows. Traded blows. I dodged about as many flashlight stuns as you gave to me. You stayed near the pallets, forcing me to trade bloodlust for you to shift to another tile.
---
At no point in time was there rest really given for either side. I got a few hooks, and chased after your distractions, only to double-back and be nearby when another teammate went for the unhook. I even managed to get one of you in the middle of the animation, the instadown was sweet.
---
You found my Devour, but it was obvious by that point it wasn't gonna save me. I needed to keep the pressure on you all, and I could tell that you were in comms. There was no way your team would have worked so well together, trading players after one got hit for fresh one, after each hit.
---
Finally, after the gates were opened, you didn't t-bag. I didn't face camp. You let me have the smacks on the way out the door, and in the end-game chat we exchanged GGs.
---
I should be upset by the matchmaking on this. By all rights we shouldn't have been paired together. But instead of a one-sided slaughter or gg ez, it was a fight where one mistake and the entire match unravels. You guys screwed up less than I did. And I learned much from this.
---
Thanks for not being dicks. See you in the fog.
---
You will walk and crouchwalk faster independently than a normal survivor.
---
ah i see you are a vault master legion of culture as well
---
It’s supposed to be rare bruh
---
Sure. Liar lol
---
r/angryupvote
---
Hm.
---
These fucking incel white knights come out in every fucking Susie thread. It's absolutely amazing to be there are so many of them.
---
Wish you saved a clip. Would have liked to see that ha
---
Basement Bubba main
---
Only use the lunge if they aren't looking at you, are going through a narrow space like the bus on Autohaven, when they are going for windows like the Shack, or to bait either an extra loop for a hit or to drop the pallet.
---
Ghostface for fun. Cannibal for bbq n chili.
---
It’s literally because they are that salty
---
I’m more amazed you got mettle to work
---
One game I had 3 high rank arseholes who kept flashing, looping, teabagging and just taking the piss in general. Which made it more satisfying when I killed them all
---
I tend to stay near the basement with legion. Like not enough to were I'm camping but enough so if anyone rescues them I can get the rescuer with make your choice
---
Tbh i never even used it. Whenever i play dbd i start up and only play one or the other
---
He's not op at all. His lunge is easy to juke. His ability is Balenced.
---
Then you finally get to the injured, just to get stabbed in the back
---
If you are playing SWF they are quiet evil for killers
---
Probably the same guys who think lewding huntress is wrong because she was left alone as a child.
---
For real, this is a thing?
---
It was added to every platform in the Stranger Things update :)
---
No its because of Joe
---
Agree. It Isn't exactly a secret when you are basically yelling "HEY GUYS I HAVE A SECRET"
---
It's confusing that killer mains forget the other four people are players and think slugging and now freezer locking people for up to 8 minutes is something they want to deal with. This is 150% just a legit reason to disconnect. Knock them down. Hook them. Move on to the next game.
---
No more splinters. Im tired of buying DLCs just to increase my number of ebony moris
---
I mori or facecamp every game
---
Yes, I know DbD's bloodpoint modifiers are additive.
---
However, if everyone uses BPS right now the game has a 6x modifier to all bp. If everyone uses BPS during the Bloodhunt the game gets a 7x modifier to all bp (not counting BBQ or WGLF).
---
And even if you are the ONLY one using a BPS it's still a 3x modifier instead of a 2x modifier because of the Bloodhunt.
---
With coordination you can get more BP than you ever could otherwise, and even without coordination you'll get more BP with 1 BPS than you would normally.
---
ooohh the legion. gotcha
---
I did lol
---
It’s not every day that a transformer streams on twitch
---
Isnt it even kind of nerfed since there is this new strong totem cleansing perk, making it more unlikely that one of your dull totems survive? (Of course if there is one or more survivors running the perk)
---
Because he's pissing himself, knowing he's about to go toe to toe with Jason in the real world.
---
I have a huge love and hate relationship with Second Wind right now.
---
It's really frustrating and difficult to get that "one full heal on someone else" because if someone else helps you or if the other person so much as taps themselves with a self heal, you won't get it. It's really frustrating, especially since you can only use the perk twice in a match.
---
Also i swear to god it has the "deliverance effect" where if you run it you'll be hooked first always....
---
Yeah, but survivors just don't cleanse totems in my games, it's weird.
---
How is it not? You're using a 3rd party to obtain info on your opponent to gain an unfair advantage. Of course it depends on the game. For some games stream sniping does literally nothing and for others it's near game-breaking. A lot of 12 year olds love to do it though so people defend it. It's cheating.
---
He’s basically a more aggressive, and more self-reliant/less map-reliant Freddy. He takes time to set up, but once you’re able to open up portals on pretty much every gen, you’re able to either force the game to slow down (with survivors constantly having to close your portals instead of working on gens, kinda like how Pig can slow the game with RBTs), or force survivors to permanently show off where they are when working on gens
---
If you like Trapper, but would want to trade lethality for map knowledge and time wasting, Demogorgon is what you’d get. His shred is pretty fun too, but his real strength is in how much he’s able to slow the game down with portal cleansing 
---
He also gets MAD bloodpoints. I don’t know how common this is, but I’ve already had a match with 32K BP, and I don’t have all the perks I want on him yet
---
Sry if ur feelings are hurt xP
---
24 should be the absolute max as it would just be a better Object if it was much larger than that. 16, 20, 24 maybe?
---
Console bad pc good. Shut the fuck yo
---
That strategy will end up either borrowed time triggering or getting Decisive striked
---
What, I never dc
---
Okay, we are posting comments from this sub as threads in the same sub? Thats a new low
---
Yah people are getting hella boosted now lmao (no offense)
---
*Franks mixtape wants to know ypur location*
---
this is how games should go and most do with competent survivors. I guess its not as common in lower ranks for noobettes to save anyone and instead just immediately leave tho
---
Yeah, if you pay attention to the screen they fly off the offering screen instead of being burned up.
---
I think there's a tutorial explaining this somewhere in-game.
---
Did they actually mention that it's broken and slated for a fix? I might have missed that in a dev blog or patch notes.
---
Green map offerings give you a 9999% chance to get that map according to the wiki.
---
This has been the most even matchmaking I've seen all week long, damn
---
I guess they want people to play both roles
---
Healing a teammate is wasted seconds?

As a huntress main don’t listen to this guy, it’s fine the way you designed it and I really like it :)
---
Personally its got to be trapper because i play with friends and they always fall for it
---
That is my go to for perk combos. Sometimes I add quick and quite to the mix.
---
I got 4 red rank survs in a game (I am a yellow rank killer), but somehow managed a 4 k with 3 gens left
---
Bro literally every online multiplayer game that has even a shred of competitiveness to it has its toxic side. League, Overwatch, Rainbow 6 Siege, you name it. If i had a dollar for everytime some random stranger online told me to kill myself I'd be loaded
---
I’m not saying one is better than the other, I’m just pointing out that people are hyped by inner strength, but Second Wind is an equally good perk that they should consider.
---
But the hitboxes are more fair as the Demogorgon. The huntress can hit three feet on all sides of you and you’re still hit, that’s why I love the Demogorgon haha he takes so much skill and is very sneaky if you’re not paying attention!
---
Same thing with when they're the only survivor sacrificed
---
Thanks! Obviously I have no way to test it, so i cant be sure on anything, so I like to listen to everyone's opinions on things
---
"my now shitty internet"
---
And uh, why are you playing online games, especially ones like this without dedicated servers yet, with shitty internet? 
---
Ever occur to you that it's, oh I don't know, your SELF ADMITTED SHITTY INTERNET that's the problem?? Just a thought!
---
Wastes insane amounts of time that should be spent on gens.  Self Care Gamers often get carried through their games by other survivors who focus objectives.
---
Use iron Will and walk away from loops when she goes into phase mode
---
Spinechill works even when she phasewalks but I  suggest to watch this video https://youtu.be/s2bXIO0c0CY by painreleaver
---
What are the categories? I seen stuff like get x amount more BP for actions in deviousness category and other things
---
yall forgetting about billy wtf is happening on console
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
Cause the game used to work on my internet, since my other games won’t but since 3.0.0 I’ve had nothing but problems so, also sometimes it works on other stuff and it is probably on their side too.
---
I was meaning "is it now region locked or just xbl being crappy?"
---
My wig always being snatched at that gen..doesn’t matter who I’m playing as 🤣
---
Iron Will is still a thing, and some survivors have brains (myself included)
---
They haven’t arrived yet as devs said they still want to keep working on them.
---
No.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216/status-update-dedicated-servers
---
shut the fuck up
---
Damn the fat shame is real.
---
Freddy just because its annoying same with hag or trapper. I love going to face Myers the doctor nurse bing bong any killer who doesnt have a very annoying kit. The pig also if they tunnel well trying to get the mask off.
---
Don't fight fire with fire. Point out their toxicity but have some respect to yourself and the game and don't stoop to their level.
---
Not all killers can do that dummy
---
I mean, if you just want to completely say "fuck it" with the license and do stuff that's never happened in the original source material, sure
---
is this why i am getting downvoted? ;-;
---
There’s always a few sour grapes, but it doesn’t mean the whole vine is spoiled.
---
Yes, they have mentioned and acknowledged it. However, I don't recall if it was on the official forums or on Twitter. I'm currently trying to find it, and will update if I do. If I don't update, it means I suck butt and I couldn't find it.
---
Possibly lol. People are jealous that your survivors arent rank 1 while you're rank 20
---
I hate my life. Ever since I started to play this game again I've been waiting for this event and had plenty of time. And now you chose exactly those days where I'll be away. Someone just mori me please.
---
There are no dedicated servers out yet. Nothing is region locked. You experience other issues. I would suggest you both restart the game and try it again. If this doesn’t work out you you are not alone - many people have issues with joining/lobbies. What you can do about that? Nothing. Behaviour has to fix this.
---
stop being an asshole and you'll stop getting those messages
---
If I stay there will be trouble
---
You never even seen me play
---
Yep, you gotta know when to chase and when to go for another objective.
---
For survivor, there is survival, objectives, altruism, and boldness. 
---
Survival is staying alive, objectives is repairing generators, altruism is for rescuing and healing other survivors and boldness is getting chased by and looping the killer
---
For killer, there is brutality, hunter, deviousness, and sacrifice. Brutality is injuring survivors and damaging generators, hunter is finding and chasing survivors, deviousness is how well you use the killers power, and sacrifice is hooking each survivor as many times as you can before they are dead, maximum is 3 hooks
---
Billy is 3rd best on both platforms
---
I agree. Because of that I try not to care about my rank but it's really hard, because the whole game is ranked mode.
---
Not bloody likely, seeing as how, again, you are stating that your other games won't work on it.
---
Yes, but it still manages on the game or used to is the point.
---
YESSS
---
I have yet to play a game where I dont let at least one guy go, I'm a survivor main so i guess I'm just doing what i like to see from killers
---
There should be a perk that whenever you miss a skillcheck on a gen you get a repairspeed bonus for like 30 seconds. Its really good but the killer then also gets a notification. It's high risk high reward
---
spirit isnt a good killer, shes overpowered. tell me, how many games have you won against a spirit in high ranks?
---
Ive been using spinechill alot lately because of ghostface, great perk. My problem with the spirit is, i cant seem to lose her in a chase. I tried with dead hard and sprint burst, and she still eventually catches me. I think ima equip urban evasion again.
---
I've only got 64 hours under my belt in dbd and I started survivor. Personally, I thought it was sweet of killers to let us farm bp but I  wished they would have just ended the match so we could move on. Now that I'm a killer main, if I got a decent amount of bp and they weren't bad sports I'll sometimes give the last one the hatch.  Only problem is the new crowd thinks I'm trolling and won't stop wiggling lol.
---
but... it wasn't my fault... \*cries in the corner\*
---
Yeah, but what did they say
---
Seems to me that the only way to escape freddy now is through a hatch
---
I don't think medkit matters, I picked someone up with an instaheal last night and it activated
---
Look what you've made me do
---
True
---
Oh I know dude, welcome to the bullshit that is reddit lol
---
Such an enticing, wet, big mouth...
---
**Tight** ***thrussy***
---
Ight imma head out
---
you obviously play like you have a stick in your ass
---
i haven’t played my switch in a hot minute but damn! Can’t wait for Nintendo Switch players to join the Fog!!
---
He is easy just annoying with the alarms and dream world.
---
why’d ya farm that other Nancy tho?
---
It's not so much about being the best per se, just know that red ranks are fairly competitive and you'll run into folks that have too much time on their hands and/or just lack basic decency.
---
Don't sweat it.
---
nice username lmao
---
I hate going up against Doctor and Plague. Especially since it's hard to get away from Doctor because of his static field and same when trying to loop him. I hate Plague because my teammates always cleanse and then she has her death puke and it's an ez game
---
https://vimeo.com/361528579?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=vimeo-cliptranscode-201504&amp;utm_campaign=28749 Idk if this will work but hopefully you can see the clip
---
Legion IMO...his whole mechanics are just unfun for me.
---
I’m thinking it’s mostly the newer Demos who don’t quite know what they’re doing yet. Had one who camped and didn’t use a single portal the entire game. 
---
I’ve had both though and the ones who use their power for map pressure are super fun to go against and the chases are genuinely kinda scary and thrilling. 
---
There are good ones out there. Just like all the killers. Low skill = camping
---
That's hella toxic.
---
I've never related so much to a post.
---
For Spirit, she's pretty hard to counter but what I do is try to get away from her and when you don't hear the heartbeat or don't see her, assume she's using her faze walk and start walking so your scratch marks won't show.
---
I am from asia and they were all talking in thai which was outputting as white blocks for me but there were a lot of 5 which is there equivalent of 'ha' so probably lot of salt xD
---
Same. Often I'd just be called a "camping, tunneling, toxic killer" or something like that. It's like some players are just throwing random game-related terms at you expecting to look right.
---
I find myself going up against freddys with tinkerer though, making it super hard to finish a gen unless my teammates are keeping him occupied. Which... majority of the time they are not.
---
Unrealistic, Scoops Steves always get tunneled and moried
---
Oh wow you used head on for no reason.
---
Ah, ok
---
That’s a horrible idea lol, it would literally make it worth it to miss every skillcheck
---
Yes, I don't care. Thats why i'm responding to you and trying to understand what you are saying.
---
There is no reasoning with you. You made up your mind before this conversation happened. X is bad Y is good, mean people, rah rah rah.
---
Yeah, the token cap is bugged, once the perk reaches eight+ tokens, it causes the crash
---
dude can only get dial up in the killer basement.
---
The doctor is still very op in my opinion. He can easily kill a loop by just shocking you so yeah I understand.
---
&gt; Should I stay or should I go
---
If I go, there will be trouble
---
And if I stay it will be double
---
Right? Some of the changes they’ve made make no sense and are more inconvenient than anything and just dumb.
---
Damn me and my siblings (total legion fans) wanted a cosmetic for a marauder joe!
---
It's a reference to Steve slamming the door open when he sees that Dustin (Henderson) is back.
---
i linds forget, but i thinks its be in the left 4 dead steam group. For the red shirt, own any of the two l4d games. i may be wrong about the order or anything but thats the general idea you can prob find it on yt
---
I accidentally did this in a game just now. The guy didn't realize what happened and went around to the side I should have been on, if I had any brain cells.
---
Ight ima head out
---
Ladies and gentlemen, on the left you’ll see a bigot - hopefully they will be shot into endangerment and later extinction.

Hexy isn't top viewed, he is up there but not top. That usually goes to Tru3 or Pug simply because of the hours they put in. Noob3 and Jendenise used to get a lot too when they streamed it more consistently. Like as of now it's Tru3 with  415,853 viewer hours and Hexy is third with  262,708 viewer hours.
---
Damn. Greed for the best of that Nea. After a hatch standoff with another survivor I would’ve just left.
---
Why are you booing him? He’s right!
---
I love hillbilly his one shot chainsaw ends chases quickly.
---
I’ve tried it. It works sometimes but not always or reliably.

What does rank have to do with earning an event offering?
---
I was able to take a shower and come back to a loading screen. Maybe 20 minutes total. Great game!
---
I dunno man legion is pretty fucking strong with that knife. Dunno if freddy could take em.
---
Or any totem related perk, or getting the BP, emblem score or just to cleanse out of fear of the unknown. 
---
You call healing someone productive but that’s still two people not on a generator so if you wanna split hairs we can split hairs. Both perks can assist you in survival and securing your escape. The noting of efficiency is minuscule, almost laughable because the raw numbers don’t factor in anything like perks or killers, what you may be doing or have already done or anything. The variables make judging the perks by “oh this one takes longer cause it’s 4 seconds more and so it’s bad” is just short sighted.
---
Especially since the time was about to run out.
---
My go-to excuse is "I decided to leave the generator right as I got a skill check"
---
This is almost always the truth too, it happens so often...
---
why is this getting downvoted? i assure you theres not a single transgender person in existence who would be offended by being called a transformer
---
maybe a petition would help?
---
You’re still living in the past. If you get that map as a m1 killer then you’re not really playing a multiplayer game anymore since nearly every pallet has no mindgame potential to it. Also the room of fun next to basement still needs a change.
---
TIME OUT
---
ok time in
---
I did and your post is full of bull shit that every single person that would suck says
---
She was clearly feeling a little greedy.
---
Yeah man a demon that enters your dreams definitely couldnt stand a chance against.an edgy 19 year old with a switch blade... guess all those teenagers Freddy killed were just missing a spoopy mask.
---
Yup very.
---
Most ppl still don't know that her traps can be destroyed with a flashlight lol
---
Hey man, what you got against sour grapes?
---
What Rank are your friends? Trapper is a really easy killer to escape, I've only seen one Trapper that was literally impossible to win against and I've been playing this game for 3 years.
---
He's literally the reason I run both perks.
---
Yesterday I was looping a Billy fairly well, I pulled the pallet as he swung, stunned him before he was even into the pallet (???), was clean on the other side during the stun and still got injured (???).
---
56 ping. It's really getting old.
---
Ima just start using urban evasion again.
---
haha I've gotten killed by the same thing fucking fat shame spots man
---
Very poor odds if you own the dlc. So basically I have no idea because I own them and I don't get the offerings anymore. I did amass quite a few before I did though.
---
This happens to me all the time as the demogorgon, since I hide a portal behind walls close to the hook, and go through as fast as I can after they get unhooked
---
They joined because of stranger things so there new but im not that goof either so i cant teach them
---
i had this happen to me but it told me killer dc'd. i showed up as still alive in game to everyone else, and then hatch spawned while i was "still alive" allowing another surv to escape. pretty good job so far
---
I do not own it

Those are literally both my favorite maps. So easy to be sneaky in the tall cattails and corn stalks.
---
Its specifically blood lodge that can suck. A lot of the other maps are very rng reliant when it comes to getting good map generation.
---
I mean, really. That whole place is pallet hell.
---
Now this is epic
---
Nurse
---
This is infuriating.
---
They don’t taste good! Neither do salty ones!
---
That's kinda tunnel if you chase the unhooked one for me.
---
The doctor really isn’t op, he’s one of the weakest killers. His shock is so inconsistent it’s insane, it barely actually works how you want it too
---
That's the logic of a child. That doesn't make sense. This is why most stream snipers are kids or neckbeards. You're a shitty person. Quit trying to project your shitty-ness onto the streamer.
---
Imagine telling someone it's their fault they got robbed because they wore nice clothes or went out at night. Imagine telling a girl it's her fault for getting cat called because she dressed up. Telling a streamer it's their fault for advertising their stream???
---
Not if you have make your choice
---
Actually, these generators can easily play in the killer's favor. If he finds the generator before it's done, he can scare all survivors off at the same time. Not to mention working with 4 people on the same generator gives everyone a progression penalty, so while you get this one generator done sooner, the global gen progression goes slower.
---
Man, RIP Pig.
---
*notices fungi bulge* UwU
---
4v4 killer TDM sounds fun tbh
---
EXCUSE ME WHAT THE FUCK
---
Its just a game of map roulette
---
Aight, imma head out
---
If you have make your choice and go for the unhooked one it's useless. But yes, if you chase the unhooker and and hit him with make your choice, it's clearly no tunnel
---
I mean, he runs as fast and has the same lunge as every other killer. I dont know what to tell you
---
Have alot of fun my friend
---
Literally did the same cosmetic set up lol! I like to think the Demogorgon is actually dart just fully grown since he died
---
Wow.
---
How is this fart humor? Someone is dancing and it’s funny. Nobody’s farting here
---
While the killer wastes a perk slot to be petty. Then proceed to complain about getting genrushed cause they ran 3 perk build all game.
---
Nurse, just know exactly how to play her and you have won
---
Sounds cool
---
Im curious how big the Switch community will be. I'm happy for you guys!
---
look behind u!!!
---
Billy, I have to play immersed as fuck or I’m insta downed and camped
---
Can we get more Susie skins and actually have Susie and joe prestige skins lol?
---
Just buy all
---
Until the devs fix it, find some pals to practice in custom games with. Not much else I can say.
---
wrong sub
---
Iron Will is a strong perk against every single killer in the game.
---
Nope. Matchmaking is broken, but they're looking into making it bwtter
---
Ruin is non existent in high rank. I am super excited for the new dying light because in red ranks survivors know all totem spots and also can hit great skill checks with ease. The thing with spirit and nurse is you need to play the stealth game to win which isn’t the meta at all so that’s what people struggle against because you can’t loop them.
---
I know man i tried but the leash broke! Ill try and get a better one.
---
This is especially funny for me because in my experience Quintin players fail skill checks the most often.
---
I think the point is that's a "lame" meta build, not that the perks are bad. But self care gets hate for obvious reasons
---
My powergrid went down one time while I was destroying the enemy team and when its back up I see “Reported for dcing, have a nice day.” Not sure how you can be so ignorant.
---
The map is super killer sided though. As people already metioned, 90% of the pallets are super unsafe, you just need to bait the survivors to drop them and then they're basically fucked. The only way to make this map more torable is with balacing landing by exploting the second floor drop and the room with a bunch of stairs. Just don't waste time breaking them, there's only one kind of loop you need to be concern. GGs
---
Listen, I know you’re a new owner, but get your shit together before coming to the dog park,

Nurse is the strongest. Demogorgon so far is my favorite.
---
Jesus
---
Alright man! Can do i swear he wont get away from again!
---
We’re never gonna get a 2 v 6 mode ):
---
Are you stupid? The pig mask was used at least once to conceal a trap.
---
Just keep at it and don't be disheartened by those bullies. They'll hopefully fix the rank issue soon. You got this!!
---
Well that's a tough situation, just make sure you and your friends know what each killers abilities are and what your own perks do and you should be fine to be honest.
---
Keep taking losses and working on your nurse main.  You'll figure out their strats over time and end up being a beast.  Hopefully not on xbox
---
Play killer a lot, get leatherface for bbq and chili. You,ll save yourself plenty of time on the grind, if you play killer and stomp the survs a lot they letting the game go on for longer for more BP
---
Good luck man
---
Can’t wait to see Thompson’s OP house flicker. Tons of lighting there!
---
Clown especially if they're running exhaustion addons.  Extremely unfun killer to play against.
---
same :/
---
I mean, you're wrong in literally every single way imaginable, but alright.
---
It would have been better if I had a mori, unfortunately I used mine up on a game with one mori kill, two dc’s and a hatch escape
---
No one should ever get mad at tbagging. I just deal with it when I play killer because  there's no point at getting mad at tbagging at all.  If I feel like playing survivor I tbag if I escape by gate right as the killer almost gets to me, when I hit DS, and (if the killer is bad) when I drop a pallet on the killer.  When I play killer (I do most of the time) I just don't give a fuck about tbagging. There's no reason to get mad at pixels moving up and down in a video game.
---
Sure, bm them back by nodding them and hitting them on hook, just don't get pissed because you can't handle something that isn't even that hurtful.
---
Aww, thank you! 
---
(I don't know why but this comment sounded very endearing in my head)
---
No thank you
---
Get off the Internet is the only way
---
I am using it right now vs whispers because I have it at higher ranks and whispers at its lowest rank is too big an area to be all that helpful. 
---
Spies is actually fantastic on some maps. It’s great on Hawkins.
---
Is that a fellow Quentin main I spotted?
---
Iron will and fixated
---
Thanks, and I'll be buying leatherface soon since I'll have leftover money since the dlc is on discount
---
Yes sir we’ll upcoming
---
I love it! Nice work!
---
They made it so if you're playing survive with friends, you don't have to invite them after every single game (you'll stay in the same lobby). Long this broke the button, so they dropped it for now.
---
While I'd love a colorblind option for this game (I'm not colorblind myself but more acessiblity options are always a good thing), I don't know how talking to an Overwatch streamer about Dead by Daylight (2 VASTLY different games) problems would help us. Besides that, Overwatch (at least before the colorblind update) already had a colorblind mode, although bad (current one isn't even that perfect too from what I understand, it's just better than before) and in that case the devs already knew that people wanted better colorblind options but it wasn't on the "top of their list". So if a colorblind option for Dead by Daylight were to be made I suppose that they would need to put some effort into it.
---
Nonetheless, I still think that contacting her would be good. I mean, if it wasn't for her Overwatch devs would probably never even have batted an eye at those issues. And besides that, any help is good already.
---
She dc'd

I literally never said you guys suck. You’re literally just making more crap up on that front. I didn’t respond to you because frankly, I don’t have to, was annoyed, and did not want to converse with you further at that point. (Now however, I’m just the right amount of annoyed to keep responding.) You say I made my mind up before this started, that’s also untrue and an assumption. You’ve literally just pushed me to the point and solidified the decision. 
---
I’m just a user on this subreddit. I’m not a mod. I will not claim to be able to do better or to have knowledge to do better. However I will say that while it may be “annoying” to see virtually the same topic posted over and over, there is really no excuse to remove them simply because it’s *annoying and uninteresting to you specifically.* 
---
As you yourself said there a lot of new users here now because of the new DLC, something I literally said before. The vast majority of these are new users who are coming to talk about it asking questions. That’s what a huge section of this subreddit is for. Removing them makes absolutely no sense, as you’re removing the ability to see responses or anyone coming to ask the same question and post the same thing to see it before they do so. If you’re actively removing these then how is anyone coming here supposed to know? Not everyone searches by new, or thinks to at first. Most of these posts don’t make it past 100 upvotes, meaning the only way to see them is in the New/recent filter. 
---
And again, just because it’s annoying to someone, doesn’t mean it makes sense to remove it. 
---
No, you shouldn’t “limit it to 2-3” because these people aren’t doing anything to warrant post removal. Leave their posts alone as they are not breaking any rules. One could argue that you’re just abusing mod power and status at this point. That being said, maybe a post made by you as mods addressing the issue and making so it was easy to see and find for now would in fact be a good idea. A sticky I guess it would be as you said, where people can ask, post, and discuss this topic. In fact one about the exit gate bug and other various and commonly reported bugs should be turned into topic posts where people can go and ask for advice. From there, people could decide if they still want to make their own post, if they feel they want to discuss it further. (In the example of they didn’t find the answer or discussion they wanted so they created their own.) But even then. That wouldn’t excuse removal of people’s own posts when they do not violate rules. And a good amount of these posts about matchmaking do not. 
---
This will be the final time I respond to you, even if you respond again. I’m grown quite sick of this pointless back and forth. You say I made my mind up already via your own assumptions. I’ll go ahead and say the same to you. You’ve taken an already bad experience and multiplied it by 100. Imagine how that looks and feels to the already clearly upset newbies. As a person who loves this game, you’ve literally just made me dislike and not want to continue playing it more. So thanks for that. 
---
Good luck.
---
I like that

Thank you! I can’t wait for his face rework
---
A good example of people quitting (abandon) penalties is rainbow 6. If you leave/disconnect a ranked game it sanctions a 30 minute ban, you cant find a game for the next 30 minutes. Consistent offenders escalates the sanctions to 60 minutes and so for. Nobody ever tries to disconnect while playing.
---
Sorry, he's just hungry

on the right youll see someone who doesnt understand basic biologly
---
Brother, there is nothing wrong with not pipping as killer
---
They finally let friends stay in the same lobby after the match?!?
---
It’s been all over the reddit for like 2 days that match making is broken broken right now and they are working on a hotfix.
---
You sound like an idiot when you say biology because it’s actually a psychology thing. Lol.
---
Having trouble with hands?
---
Yea lol when her face rework comes around i will be very hype as well.
---
It is a shitty thing to do, and then try to blame the streamer for your own shitty choice to stream snipe is extra low. 
---
I know no one is getting robbed dude, those are just examples of other situations where people try to victim blame.
---
Oh yeah it’s all coming together
---
It is definitely a map where some killers are gonna struggle big time. I am a Freddy main though and I’ve 4K every match I’ve played on that map so far.
---
This is a killer I cannot stand.. I forgot all bout him.
---
RNG: *fuck this guy in particular*
---
What's especially annoying is that you can expect every billy to be running tinkerer.
---
[David Mains](https://imgur.com/gallery/N6beCkp)
---
Matchmaking is messed up in general, it is known. They’re working on a hotfix.
---
Hopefully matchmaking will get fixed next week but until then don’t let it discourage you. Most of the survivors who are acting like that will go back to getting wrecked in their own ranks soon. 
---
Also, if you’ve got noed it might be worth it to use, if they don’t cleanse totems you will have a second chance to get some kills in end game.
---
Yeah, this is indeed what they're going to do but I assume it's harder to do than we think
---
Really Jane really.

What was she doing looking at the floor she was doing a generator

He is one of those streamers I don’t watch or support because he is an asshole. I don’t want to support streamers who contribute to the nasty atmosphere of the internet.
---
I have around 70 hours played and I never seen any map offering that wasnt green in my bloodweb
---
If you want BBQ for your other killers, Cannibal is a good first buy, if only to make blood point grinding easier. He isn't consider a great killer otherwise.
---
He's an endgame killer, thrives on the last couple of gens and EGC. I'd say run location perks when you get 'em. Do your best to make them 3-gen themselves. Place portals next to gens and use Of The Abyss. If you're quick, they won't be able to close them. You know a game's gonna be good if you're going from chase to chase..then it's all up to "matchmaking" giving you red rank survivors or babies. Good Luck.
---
Naw it’s Billy’s with bbq, they’re like legion but better in every way
---
I like to spin around crazily or moonwalk if I'm Myers
---
Cant be survivor, i thought that killer was always host? every time the game ends is because the killer leaves/disconnects
---
Isn't that for DC's?
---
That's a pretty big booboo from BHVRs perspective
---
Nope. Just matchmaking :)
---
delete this
---
She was so immersed she was playing in first person
---
Patience. Use it as learning experience. In the long run it is better to face better survivors.
---
Abetment is a good idea, but chase mechanics are so dopey that it would just allow survivors to make huge distance before a chase starts or if you're forced to break the pallet and lose them for a few seconds.
---
There is no chasing somebody too long. If the killer wants to throw the game to learn some survivor moves, nobody wants to hear the survivor complain they had to survive.
---
Then she'll stand still. "Mindgame" you to see where you stand  and get her hit.
---
Hol up you might of done something

Can't forget how good the demogorgon can be with a basement build, Otzdrava did
---
It'd be like if the killer got a one-hit down ability right as the survivors are on the cusp of escaping.
---
^^/s
---
Survivors like when they lead the chase for ages
---
They don't like it when they got first downed in a deadzone, rescued during a proxi camp, chased specifically and run to a zone you didn't know where were no pallets in, get downed again, hooked, get unhooked and the killer avoids hitting teammates body-blocking trying to save your ass
---
That amount of attention on a single survivor only bites you in the ass- you give up like 3-4 gens doing that shit
---
this is so annoying but theres really no way to fix it. if the devs got rid of this you could just stop repairing for a second every time you get a skill check
---
Non-green map offerings used to be available in bloodwebs but were removed. People who had them saved can still use them but can't get any new ones. They did the same thing with a smaller chance per level/color.
---
Suck yer mum gay boi
---
Are you stupid? The mask was used to trigger the trap, not to conceal it for shits and giggles
---
Billy's a hard one. Strong tiles against him are kill shack and jungle gyms. Kill shack can be rough though if they have the charge speed add-ons I've found. Never get caught out of position. You always want to be close to a window or pallet, and don't let him get between you and it. He can body block you while charging the chainsaw for a free down.
---
why was this downvoted, its true lmao
---
I mean maybe but the matches are literally less than 5 mins because of genrush

According to the patch notes, survivors can only hear the portal open within 8 meters. If you place your portals in a way that they won't hear you come and won't see you, you can get some easy grabs at a generator. You can see what I am talking about in this clip https://youtu.be/gSRavNV_Xjk
---
&gt;And if I see someone being unhook naturally I’m going for the injured one because I have more than 3 brain cells.
---
PepeLaugh
---
Hm I have noed I'll see how it goes
---
You’ll end up with like 2 at lvl50 like 6 at prestige 1 and like 8-13 at prestige 2 and they will be randomly and character you don’t own I got like 6 jawbone splinters and 4 black splinters because I own Freddy, if you buy the dlc they stop showing up but won’t delete the offering if you still want to burn it for fun.
---
Survivor: Get We’re Gonna Live (farm) Forever, unhook alot of people get WGLF stacks and burn through BP offerings.
---
Killer: Use BBQ n Chilli, other perks that give extra BP and also burn through BP offerings.
---
Hopefully, Im on PC btw
---
I disagree. Micheal is still better spooky boi
---
What my understanding was as well but the timing was perfect and wasn't the first time I'd experienced that (first as killer though)
---
Because the killer (host) thinks the game isnt worth completing so he disconnects and ruins everybodys game, then that shows there is a problem. I have had loads of games and somtimes i killed 1 person, on the rare occasion everybody escaped. But i dont DC, its just sour grapes doing it and its clearly being exploited by salty killers
---
Sprint burst/fixated meta

I just prestiged Nancy the other day.. she's now level 35 again, and so far she has about one rank of each shitty perk in the game.

I'll keep trying :)
---
Yeah I just got a glass shard, sorta killed the excitement but it’s fine
---
Its a real shame
---
Similar story: guy downed where there were no hooks and he crawled to the corner instead of following me and then complained I let him bleed out for 4k instead of let him get up.
---
I do think cross platform will be added by the middle of next year, there are so many hints towards it. Im not sure if it will be progress though
---
Ah yes I love long dead meme formats
---
If your understanding of biology is that everyone falls into either XX or XY  genotypes I've got some bad news about your own understanding of basic genetics.
---
Seeing as we're talking about changes, have they fixed it so you don't have to invite a friend after EVERY game if you're playing survivor?
---
I don't have many friends who have the game, so i rarely play SWF, but that really needs to be addressed.
---
With every fail, the success chance should increase to some degree or else there is a possiblity that you will never get free from such situations.
---
Killer obviously going to make more bloodpoints. If you want to play survivor though, my bp build is prove thy self, wglf, bt, and sabo. Saboing gives points in the bold category in case you don't get chased enough. :)
---
Remember when you didn't have to restart your game every other match because lobbies can't sync everyone together 80% of the time?
---
Well so whatever it’s fun. Why are you being a fun killer? An not the fun kind of fun killer.
---
You think Michael is worse than Ghostface?
---
Hitting the person getting unhooked at the end game is a bad play anyway. Just asking to hit a borrowed time and lose.
---
I consider this a success and my reward is a makeout session with the killer
---
Wait then i don’t understand the meme the fucking normie i am :(
---
Arrogant without the skill to make up for it
---
I hate clown, I want to waste his time but now I’m on my second hook oh god oh fuxk

It’s a game about murder, losing feels really bad and winning deals really good and it’s a scenario that you have a bit of power over others.

He basically has acts like he’s the best player and when he loses he complains like a 9 year old girl

Description: If you begin to close a Demogorgon’s portal as it’s about to be closed by another Survivor, your game will cease responding. You cannot move, and can only look around. I haven’t been able to replicate this due to having no friends to test with and not playing much Survivor.

If people teabag me or blink their flashlights at me I absolutely camp them when the gates are powered. Can snowball pretty well bc I run NoED :)
---
i think it would be cool if u could just invite someone straight from the end game screen, like a little plus next to their name u can click that would send them an invite
---
They likely aren't actually rank 18 if they've been playing that long, they're likely only that rank due to reset
---
Just because a person feels a certain way, it doesnt automatically change their gender.
---
Yea not as bad as Haddonfield though...literally all vaults
---
Had a survivor who kept getting farmed in front of me at the end he called me a trash tunneler
---
I don't even want to complain, i mean, i got the farm and pro survivors, but i don't care. I'm kinda new, so i would like to ask if this bullshit is related to the rank reset or it is just normal. I remember that before the rank reset i met 9/10 people of my rank and 1/10 red ranks, but now it is every damn match, is it happening to everyone?
---
Ps i already know i should git gud, don't even bother
---
Definitely get Ghost Face since he's a licensed killer that can only be bought with actual money
---
Same.  I've been trying to play killer but I keep getting frustrating matches against purple ranks. (I am not)
---
And as survivor, I get teamed with grey and I'm guaranteed to have a frustrating fast game.
---
As a Quentin main, I resent that. I'm the only person who even bothers to work through ruin. Talk to me when you aren't farming for wglf stack, psh david mains.
---
 Second wind plus empathy
---
Yeah because he is
---
irrelevant to the discussion
---
Don’t play him, he has no map pressure unless you get a 3 gen stack or are against low tier survivors.
---
It may not fit, but tell me you wouldnt enjoy being a killer and see survivors dancing like this at the exit. It would make me giggle. Or if a killer wants to just play around or whatnot they can emote it in some way. I dont know, it was just a thought.
---
Except for the fact this trailer was announced months after the clown released.
---
F y
---
Oh geez why didn’t I see this!!!
---
Don't use oddbulbs. They don't do anything after they nerfed flaslights ages ago. Just run battery or grip add ons.
---
_WELCOME TO THE ROTTEN FIELDS, MOTHERFUCKER._
---
btw this is not me, it's some random teammates I was spectating.
---
I actually did do that, this was the second trap. I stepped over a window into a trap, escaped, healed, then immediately sprinted into this second, much more obvious trap. I just trimmed that part out bc it made the video too long.
---
I have not managed to get anywhere with her on Xbox so I haven’t bothered. I am not the best killer though, rank 10 so I am sure there are people who play her on console and totally slay.
---
No you see, if OP keeps posting these, he gets sweet sweet circle jerk karma points! And then when he reaches a high enough number, BHVR will personally invite him to their studios and cater to his every demand!
---
Just gotta milk the same damn post every day until he makes it big baby!
---
Bruh mama
---
2 min? U stupid shitbird theres 10 mins of loading ba
---
PS4, just switched to pc, and I think she'd be worth learning to be halfway decent with.
---
Try a different killer is my advice because 
---
1) Other killers can be easier at the beginning 
---
2) Nurse is unfun to play against and people like to insta dc if the nurse is good/has good add ons.
---
True mr.wrinkles is cool tho
---
Go to the wiki
---
Stay but make sure the killer doesn't see you but see the other one instead. Works 80% of the time.
---
So basically stab everyone once with your ability and it’s now a 4 min game? or am I missing smth?
---
we are all still born with a specific type of gentials. (excluding samesex individuals) Sex determines if we are Male or Female. XX and XY goes far beyond "mah feelings"
---
Yes?

Same folks behind it, I believe.
---
DAY AFTER MINE WOOO, b-day bros :)))
---
Russian roulette to see who the killer decides to chase.
---
For fun and good but not Op, Freddy. If you just want someone that’s plain Op and unfun to play against then Hillbilly/Nurse
---
*trapper mains
---
“I want someone to oppress” is honestly what this translates to
---
Leather face because of BBQ it’s a must have. Also it’s cheaper to buy the entire chapter on the store than auric cells. The dlc is also on sale right now
---
&gt; The next game tunneled the first guy he saw down for like 3 gens
---
That's not tunneling though. Tunneling is when the killer ignores other survivors that he sees...goes around them...to keep chasing someone. Usually someone who is injured and has been hooked once. The killer is super sweaty and trying to "secure a kill". That's tunneling.
---
If you can loop the killer long enough for 3 gens to get done, hell yeah!!! You did your job. You're a great survivor. Pat on the back. But you didn't get tunneled.
---
M1 doesnt reach them, can only get to him by jumping down but that leaves enough time for him to run away. Easy to get Evil Within up though hah.
---
I think the probability of escaping the trap should be increased every time you try to get free like if its your first attempt something around 20% chances of escaping, the second one 30% and so on
---
So basically spine chill kind of if the killer goes straight to you? Even though it’s like 4% or so, it works out in those clutch moments where that boost could help get the exit gates open and start up people’s adrenaline perks.
---
Same, we only got one game in all night last night
---
No you can’t
---
I'm a clown and legion main at red ranks. No I don't know what's wrong with me
---
no its facts fan boy the addition of survivors yelling from a two foot drop is ludicrious hand holding thats not an opinion its a fact. The killer base are honestly really dumb if you cannot find survivors with the scratchmark system. Killers are faster, have more abilities, have infinite ways of detecting survivors. Its just facts mate, if you are gunna deny the facts so hard then get a licence to marry the game.
---
Quentin:  Well these claws ain’t for just attracting mates!
---
David:  ...Is... is any part of you?  DOES any part of you?
---
Hillbilly because he is flat out OP
---
I believe the medical term you are looking for is called "Gender dysphoria" 
---
Heres a link: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/
---
Proper treatment for this condition is NOT a sex change.
---
I think confined maps play better, more mindgamey with guessing which hall or room they'll cut into around the corner. On wide open maps it's just hope you reach the next little cluster of crates/pallet in this wide open field.
---
We have the rank system so new players dont go against top tier killers. I agree it needs to be changed, and its being changed. Just wait.
---
Maybe I have, my PSN is N1nja_Surferz
---
You just made an unattended joke..good lick man
---
The same could be said for any game that has separate ranked and unranked modes.
---
Your friends are just fucking stupid, never listen to them again if they say something like that...
---
Also according to you, sex change is not a proper treatment for anything. So does that make you invalid?
---
This happens to me and my friends too!!!
---
We just memed to set up Head Ons during the match. How is that toxic?
---
If you as killer got looped by a single survivor for the completion of 3 gens, you are tunneling. As you get in the lower ranks you’ll learn. You shouldn’t not be getting looped for that long, learn when to rotate
---
The shock of getting DH cucked is so great it multiplies the pain of getting hit, leaving my survivor so full of rage he convulses like a JRPG character taking 999 damage.
---
I'll keep an eye out for ya.
---
There's definitely an influx of new players right now, and since matchmaking is broken as fuck I've ended up in a lobby with some rank 20s.. they pretty much always immediately put themselves into the struggle phase when hooked.
---
I don't think it matters who you main, it's just an example of being a slower killer
---
I’m rank 9 survivor and today I was matched up rank 18’s and 17’s so I’ll probably find u cuz the matchmaking is shite
---
Damn I never knew that was a thing, I'm going to try and find the source ingame.
---
Not sure if you have her unlocked or not, but if you do, try playing a few rounds as her. Check out how her phase works. 
---
The phase has a limited travel time as well as a certain time to get her power back. Both of those things can be modified with addons. The cooldown is the one you should focus on more as the survivor. She can't be phasing constantly unless she has really good addons, and even then, there's still a cooldown. Don't let her fake you out on that. In fact, most spirit in higher rank will always watch where you run to before phasing at all (at least while at loops). If you are dead sure she's phasing, walk away from the loop.  Be mindful of grass. She can see it move while in phase mode. 
---
My final advice is be unpredictable. Bad survivors are easy as spirit because there's no predicting to it. They will vault back into you, you can phase and run into them, and you can assume they'll hug the pallet. When you run into good survivors, you have to predict their location (because they avoid line of sight like the plague) and hope you time your phase correctly. 
---
Hope some of that helps. I typically run spirit when I play killer. :)
---
What a shit idea

Alright but did you need to ment--  
---
Ah, fine.
---
Can confirm. I would love to be a transformer.
---
Not a fan of using it in regular matches but yeah if I notice pregame that they all have good tool boxes or all flashlights and are prob swf, I'll switch something out for it because I know I'm about to get gen rushed or flashlighted the whole match so hopefully I can at least slug them all at the end.
---
I'm still salty about MoM. Turned it from a must-have into a shit tier perk. Now all of Ash's perks suck.
---
Do it yourself coward
---
Yeah! That’s works just fine too.
---
My buddies and I do this and we call it Russian roulette. The goal is for whoever gets the map offering they put in is the winner of that round. It's silly but it's something to do while waiting in long lobbies. Also we aren't a toxic group so we just try to amuse ourselves.
---
It should still be obvious unless you're using the Mother-Daughter Ring Ultra-Rare that removes the ability to see scratches in Phase. There's a light blue (I think) filter over the screen when she Phases however that could be what's causing your interference.
---
I love Lamp.
---
I've played against a couple of *really good* nurses on console, but they are very rare.  Most of the time, nurses are potatoes.
---
Now, spirit, on the other hand, will make me shit myself.
---
Seems like Leatherface is a must then by consensus!
---
Yes lol typing fast is really hard
---
i love this part of the community the helpful kind people that talk about ease of use and simple changes to help the game, contrary to salty survivors screaming about killers using “toxic builds” or killers saying any perk that slightly effected their game needs to be nerfed
---
My swf typically stays at rank 1-3. Well usually there's only 3 of us. Holy hell. Real rank 20s out of the woodwork started showing up in our lobbies. Which meant we were getting a lower rank killer too, so we would just suicide at the end of the game because it's not fair to the killer. Poor 50 hr hillbilly. We won't bully you. :(
---
Will adrenaline kick in while the survivor is on the hook or activate once they are unhooked? I know it kicks in the injured/dying states.
---
Ghostface
---
I’d rather have the old party system back because it wasn’t so buggy
---
Yeah sadly that's not the case a lot of the time....
---
Low ranks is super try hard killers who only play Nurse, Billy, and Spirit, and the survivors always seem to be garbage.
---
Could be, suppose I could try adjusting my monitor to see if that helps. Thanks
---
I'm not i just find it weird that people take the time out of there day to report me and comment dumb shit on my profile just beacuse I played a different way like I only started recently and I'm getting shit for not knowing
---
it would make sense for it to work but i dont think it will, tho i havent tested it, if so thats a great part of a build right there
---
Plague. I don’t think she’s OP but she’s just really annoying to play against.
---
This is just an idea, but maybe if you got a friend to do a custom game with you you could technically have unlimited time to just warp around the map and become a god tier nurse (this works with rocket jumping in tf2 so the whole isolated practice thing might work). 
---
Anyways, be sure to keep in mind that the survivors that bully beginning nurses WANT to discourage you from playing nurse, since she’s so strong. Deep down they are afraid that they will have to deal with a god tier nurse later. You will get better over time, and it does take some practice to become god tier. Keep at it and you’ll be golden. Additionally, I’d check and see what perks people tend to avoid as nurse. It makes sense that you likely won’t have the meta perks yet, but try to run with a synergy with your perks. Good luck!
---
Since it's a Hag Teachable you your best bet is to get it luckily from shrine of secrets
---
How about don’t tunnel the guy who got unhooked? Borrowed time is completely fine
---
I've never ever seen any legacy be accused of hacking wtf lmao
---
It looks cool but you stand out like fuck so I'm def not sad I don't have it😂
---
Hey, I’m pretty new to killer but I’ve played survivor almost two years. I’m a casual player and even I just had a game where I was bullied, taunted etc. 
---
I usually laugh it off, truthfully, but these guys got down to one gen and they were *really* good SWF (honestly I was more admiring them for their communication and map knowledge and the ability to use a flashlight on PS4, which is something I can’t do yet!) - but it was the taunting by jumping in and out of lockers over and over and over and over that made me just stop playing.
---
I don’t understand it, play the game, welcome new players to the community, you know? There’s no game without both sides so why would you want to taunt and bully so that pushes them away? I always say to whatever survivor team I play with, be humble and grateful no matter what kind of game you play because you never know what kind of day or mindset the person is having on the other side. 
---
Keep at it, this is a wonderful game and awesome community most of the time - every now and then you get someone that’s an ass, but stick it out. 💜
---
This gen rush term shows how low down on the scale you are and most interacting with u lol. Its called pressure apply it and stop govong terms to whats suppose to be done you hook rusher you xD
---
So does it work or not
---
But they've addressed this issue in the past, maybe not quite to the degree they are in the future but they've still made attempts. Making players unable to depip back to 20, emblem system &amp; changes with it to help distinguish playstyles and place players based on them, discouraging players from using scummy tactics, changing how players queue together in a lobby, etc, and the issue is still present. I'm not exactly sold they're going to fix it this time around just because they say they are.
---
Sadly no. Only had 1 trapper game on that map. Otzdarva might do a video on it soon though, hes a pretty good trapper
---
Pretty much gave everyone the expected response. You just want to complain, you dont understand how things work even when it is explained to you several times.. and when given the opportunity to be contructive you disappear.
---
Okie doke. See ya.

https://youtu.be/BN1WwnEDWAM

Couple weeks ago we had survivors ranked 11, 16, 19, 20 against a rank 2 nurse with full add-ons.  It was pathetic.  We didn't even get a gen half done.
---
Had this happen the other day. My teammates were being toxic af, killer ended up dcing when the last gen popped. I’m assuming it’s salt
---
Welcome!
---
There's a Shrine within the in-game purchases menu. Each week it will update with different perks for you to buy. You can use your Iridescent Shards to get it from there!
---
Imo Ghostface is one of the most fun killers but every killer is fun based on playstyle, i find clown boring af but liked old freddy which was the most boring killer for the majority of players try to look into gameplay videos and see what catches your eyes.
---
&gt;\-hitting a survivor unhooked right in front of you
---
This one IS tunneling tho 🤔
---
I never get people who think my legacy is fake weird
---
I'm having lots of trouble getting games as killer and it never used to happen with the old party system. It's been constant ever since the new update but I get games on survivor fast.
---
Huh? You just said save them. But if you use it now, you’re still getting the same bonus and giving the same bonus as you would if you saved it and used it during bloodhunt
---
So if you have it, no need to save. Use it whenever you want. It’s still the same bonus any time
---
I started running it a few weekes before the new chapter...the first 2 times I used it I got a bunch of downs with it... Haven't got a single one since the new chapter came out... ._.
---
I'm probably one of the few people who think the legacy cosmetics look low effort/quite bad, no?
---
I'm sorry but did you get MoM to actually fucking work?
---
For best perks = plague and clown
---
Most fun (my opinion) = clown (can do the most legit dance ever) and ghostface (counters tbagging)
---
Fun is more important so you better try to figure out wat killers you have the most fun with.
---
This would be great to stick on a pumpkin, draw the outline and then cut it out and show it with a candle!
---
I read this like they’re yearbook superlatives.
---
Aww
---
Usually wen ur bad at a game it sucks to play. Get it?
---
wig flew to Mars
---
Thank you! I had "Sabotage 2 Hooks" which changed to "Demogorgon Shred 5 Survivors" and "Chainsaw 3 Players with Cannibal" change to "Level Up Evil Within 3 times"
---
Neck's a bit long, other than that and her lack of hands it's great.
---
Ohh, is the Shrine the same for everyone or is it specific for each person?
---
My friends and I do this all the time. We call it map roulette. It’s fun to see whose offering wins each game. We even do it during custom games.

Maybe play him instead of making an entire post sounding derpy xP

I think so yeah! I don't feel it's bad quality and it looks cool as fuck, just practically I don't like to be a christmas tree in game xD
---
You can already do this, this is what people do to significantly decrease the chance of getting ruin skill checks and it only adds like 20 seconds to gen repair time
---
Literally just had that happen, everyone but Steve went for saves meaning my NOED turn my 1k game into 3k, that Steve was pretty smart to just leave then and there then save and risk death
---
https://youtu.be/j2K8SILr3ls here watch this video by otzdarva he explains it really good what to do and what not to do. Hope it helps!
---
I do have Spirit unlocked, but I've only played her a few times back when I first started. I didn't find her fun, and ever since I started playing Pig, I haven't really wanted to look back. As a Survivor, I try to keep a good idea on her phase times and all (Obvi if she used her phase to get to me and I run to a pallet loop, she won't be able to phase again for a little bit) but I struggle predicting past that. (Which, honestly is hard to practice when every Spirit you go against in top tier just eats your ass, and when you go against a Spirit in any lower tier you would think they just installed the game.)
---
Thanks for the advice though! I try to walk when facing her best I can- I'll probably end up going for more of a Houdini build from here on out. I feel like the new Nancy Scratch Mark Perk will be a good run versus Spirit as well, for easier Scratchmark jukes.
---
It happens to me daily and I’m just at the point where I’m like yeh bro 👀
---
Hey! Welcome to DBD!
---
Truth be told, Matchmaking is currently pretty bad. However, don't give up! This upcoming September 26th we have an event that gives double the blood-points, which will help you level up your characters rather easily.
---
At first, losing feels pretty shitty, but that's how you learn in this game. Engage and play! Don't be afraid to fuck up and have fun! As long as you aren't a dick most of the playerbase will be pretty nice and understanding.
---
Tag yourself, I’m Spookiest Boy™️
---
From the perks perspective, I'd say clown and plague. Both the killers and survivors of those dlc have very interesting perks. I also find both killers rly fun to play.
---
Shrine is game/platform wide, every player on every platform gets the exact same shrine.
---
Hey at least those claws will do *something,* which is more than what 90% of my usual teammates are good for
---
Did they change the rank system or is it just becuase of the free week + influx of new players from stranger things?
---
God fucking damnit Gubbey not again.

I got the same problem but for Ps4. While they connect to a game I get the error and cant join. Its really annoying. Even when I play solo I get Nat type error

Description: The Summer BBQ cosmetics have gone missing from the customization tab. There's no sign of the PROPANE hamer or Kates dress anywhere.
---
It's super crazy right now. I haven't been able to finish a ritual, because it keeps changing. Thank you for reporting yours! :D I hope they can do something about it, because that's just lost BP.
---
I think this community gets a bad rep because of the few rotten apples, but I’ve had quite a few examples of this community being good/fun.
---
Example: I was playing with my brother and the other two survivors quit on us so the killer let us finish gens and escape out of sympathy for being given up on.  Good stuff.
---
God, this one is absolutely awful. I once had it happen to me three games in a row. At this point, it's not even the 5k survival points I'm not getting that bugs me; it's the long wait to get back to the lobby. It usually results in me having to close the entire game and open it back up.
---
I’m thinking it has to be a bug. Because 8 games or more in a row is a little less coincidental.
---
That’s reassuring, I guess I’ll have to decide on my own as I play.
---
We received tons of complaints and reports from members of our subreddit about these types of posts.
---
First you need to level up the killers until reach the teachable perks on level 30, 35 and 40.
---
Then, those perks will show up on Bubba's bloodweb.
---
The other option is to buy the perks in the shrine of secrets.
---
It's cool man I agree he is definitly one of the more renowned streamers and up their with the top ones. Like I said I think Pug and Tru3 only get it because how often and how long they do stream.

Yep. That's right, that's me baby.

Did you get your BP back?
---
Oh I only bought legion around a week ago and I got it in level 4 bloodweb, so it's kind of a substitute till I find something more useful.
---
Yes, but not exactly, you will have the characters, but their perks are only going to appear after you reach lvl 40 with them, for example: you wanna self care to appear on a bloodweb of dwight, you have the characters needed but you still have to up claud. Or you can buy the perks you want when they appear on the shrine, if you buy them on the store, they will appear on the bloodwebs.
---
Well yeah because you DC’d. Only time i’ll DC from lag is if the Killer is obviously doing it on purpose. You could have still been unhooked and cleansed some totems or worked on a gen to help.
---
Gideon doesn’t have that many safe pallets and when the killer eats through them then he’s guaranteed an M1 at certain spots. You can lose a gen or 2 to create huge fucking deadzones
---
or you can just take inner strength and activate it easily and choose when to use it when you want.
---
Platform: Xbox One X

As survivor "Quentin Smith" level 13, Sometimes get an error when trying to get into a game. It retries, and never finds a game. Also, when as a killer it frequently searches indefinitely and never finds a game.

Today is my day off and I cant play. Ive restarted the system 2 times and searching isnt working currently.

I honestly thought I might’ve been going crazy when I chose his beard cosmetics and it wasn’t there, they have stolen from our boy!!
---
True or you can not have that perk because I haven’t gotten it teachable yet
---
These types are why I don't give hatch.
---
I’ll break my own rule I made and say:
---
Look in the damn mirror. I did give you an answer. Now you’re simply baiting me like a petty child.
---
Thanks for proving me right! But I’m the immature one. 
---
***Hilarious***
---
seriously? that’ll be so useful
---
I believe it got delayed to fall
---
To be fair, it's the most logical option to pick as they were just on the hook and increases your chances of sacrificing them.
---
They released a statement saying they wont be able to. Now it is scheduled for Fall
---
Maybe he could have a spell shoot out from his wand, similar to huntress in speed / frequency of use
---
Could have serpent shrines where he goes to recharge his energy , etc etc
---
It could work! You introduce harry / hermione as survivors, and then you're not just killing teenagers but also wizards

Bug Type:  ingame, menu
---
Ingame:  I've had an in game bug several times wherein I successfully complete a skill check on a generator (I even have "good skill check" pop up on the screen), but the generator still blows up as if I'd failed.
---
Menu:  infinite loading screens
---
A good Doctor can also stop loops if its not a very long one
---
You were happy to play till you got tagged.
---
Entity: “I want you to make them suffer, then win” is more like it
---
What map you went to?
---
Love the one who the reference is from... no homo tho
---
Was assigned the gender male at birth, is actually a woman. therefore, she/her
---
Fool, don’t you know if you use Jane’s perk you IMMEDIATELY gain her THICC-ness.
---
no because they delayed it
---
I know but I'm playing this game to have fun, doing gens and totems and avoiding chase just isn't fun to me. The game was garenteed going to be an unfun mess, and i personally didn't want to go through it. That with the salt of being downed from getting head-on cucked by connection just ended it for me.
---
He still has to get two hits in
---
*laughs in ghostface, myers, pig, and insidious*
---
Yea well it's only an idea no need to complain
---
I keep getting gen rushed by swf lol. I don't mean doing gens quick, I mean all four on an individual generator so that they all go off at the same time. It gets really old, so I made a plan. Normally they teabag you at the gates, well all ř were at the gate so because I was a legion, I activated feral frenzy and let my NOED combine with it and I just wiped them out, only one crawled through the hatch. I reckon they need to at least make an option if you want swf on your matches, and if you allow it you get some more blood points or something.
---
Same with me
---
Her pronouns are made obvious earlier in this comment thread

**Platform**: Xbox One
---
**Type of Bug**: Matchmaking
---
**Description**: The game's Matchmaking becomes completely inoperable after receiving a pop up error when trying to queue up for a 3rd match
---
**Steps to Reproduce**: Play 2 matches then try to queue up for a 3rd match happens both with SWF/Killer.
---
**Expected Result**: Being able to play another match without issue and being able to cancel it.
---
**Actual Result**: It will show a Matchmaking Error and attempting to a search for a match will result in it searching for a non-existent host indefinitely without an option to cancel matchmaking.
---
**Reproduction Rate**: 100% of the time, it's that easy and annoying.
---
1. No, Fixated doesn't increased your crouch speed, it even says in the description
---
2. No, it doesn't, the only perk that affects your recovery while you're in the dying state is Unbreakable
---
Or when it’s him and 3 other female survivors: "AHOY LADIES I DIDNT SEE YA THERE"
---
hope the switch community will be big
---
To be honest matchmaking is fucked on PC too. I usually run in a swf and we're purple and red ranks. We're not try hard mind you, we just play for fun but when we come out to see it's a rank 19 killer it's just bad that it can happen. Not only do we sometimes even depip because the match was so easy but even worse is the fact it's a free week and it's just gonna put new players off.
---
What survivors see when the Demogorgon moris them lol
---
And don't forget that Billy, Huntress, and Plague also are limited in their power use with this map.
---
I'm curious how big it's framerate is gonna be
---
Yea well it's only an idea no need to complain about it
---
The ones they threw on the ptb with the stranger things update... did not perform up to expectations. (They need more server centers, idk how they're doing it but they need to just rent out to microsoft) I think they're trying to do it the cheapest way possible but they're finally figuring out that you cant skimp on servers.
---
Ooh I had this and thought I'd lost my mind.  A survivor ritual literally changed to a killer ritual on me.
---
Because?
---
Borrowed time is fine, it was always dumb that you basically had to run self care for it to work
---
Okay?
---
You should just name this list post "I'm bad with legion".
---
“Stating a fact” lol, no you’re not. Gender and sex are not the same.
---
Gender = how you identify and express yourself
---
Sex = biological makeup.
---
Yes, you can be born one gender and feel like you belong more so to the other, neither or both - because it’s *identity*. 
---
You’re welcome for the education.
---
You should’ve switch Myers and Ghostface since gf can tbag and peekaboo myers is the spookiest
---
I laughed so fucking hard at this format, jesus
---
Maybe because it's a rank 20 killer that just got the game and dc's over anything. Shit's been happening a lot, my friend pallet stunned a guy and he dc'd
---
I'm so happy I understood this
---
That's just how it is. It shuts down that specific window. Just use the other vault on the tractor. There are alot of those on haddonfield at upstairs window locations to the roof as well.
---
MoM had the potential to be the new meta, but it just shows how terrified the devs are of allowing a new meta to form. But, considering DS and MoM when combined can make you a tanky, slippery fucker, one of the two simply had to go and they opted to keep DS the meta. Perhaps it was the better choice since it has counter play. However, MoM could've just been made to have counter play rather than hard nerfed like this.
---
The pallets are unsafe but they're everywhere, almost no loops, many pallets, that's the balance of it.
---
Ah my bad.
---
I blacked out the names of discord overlay and steam cuz they might be offensive lol
---
It’s a good location I use it when I’m on those maps
---
Clown should be “best at stopping loops”
---
hmm, a potent argument for sure, but i don't quite buy it
---
I just did this during a Michael challenge to level up evil within 4 times. So I spent the game just staring at people like a creeper and 360 spinning. I even opened the exit and let 2 people escape. At the end one of the survivors still went "aw poor Michael doesn't know how to play."
---
You just can't win sometimes.
---
that's just how some maps are like the strode house on haddonfield once the traps are up there they are not accessible
---
Why would you want solidarity on a locker build?
---
Can we fuck off with these types of posts? “Is It CaMpInG iF tHeY uNhoOk RiGhT iN fRoNt Of Me???” Obviously not
---
- Platform: Xbox One S
---
- Type of Bug: Menu
---
- Description: Daily rituals, particularly survivor ones, either disappear or are replaced at random
---
- Steps to reproduce: Have 3 rituals, including a survivor one. Play a game or two without fulfilling them
---
Campings lame, it often works but ruins the game for all involved.
---
Gotchu
---
Just bought saw DLC, why pig no fun?
---
the worst one is the open a gate
---
You're on coldwind farms as a survivor, you can't really complain about anything
---
I'd argue Hag, Clown and the Demogorgon all have decent moris that stand out from the others. Also perhaps Leatherface is among them.
---
Guys, i managed to get dbd back, thanks to everyone who helped! :DDD
---
Why would you want any perk to be a must-have? That kills variety.
---
You dont have to buy it, thats what you are. Let me know when you decide to hop off the non-binary bandwagon, yeah?
---
sometimes me and my swf do this lol to see whose map gets chosen
---
Yeah its the exact reason they removed this option
---
Pretty sure it's against the rules to show people's names is why and he's trying to have you avoid getting it taken down. Not sure
---
Well two things. A. yes this could work but B. He needs a basic melee attack and C. Behavior has openly said they will not have children as survivors and so you can't have teenagers hence why none of the kids from stranger things made it into the dlc
---
That's not tunneling, your just trying to deny the rescue which is completely normal behavior for a killer.
---
Tunneling would have to be chasing only one survivor, killing that one survivor and ignoring the rest.
---
Why is nurse not d tier? She's annoying af to play
---
makes good skill check a
---
I think it means more than PC tbh. A lot of more braindead survivor teammates since there are more kids and casuals. And the frames are downright fucking awful so killer (and surv) is harder
---
Read the rules.
---
Not working for me :(
---
I would main Joel for the rest of my life.
---
Killer wait times are so long theyve clearly relaxed the matchmaking. They need to stop rank reset every month, its made ranks even more pointless. As survivor I get a brand new rank 20 in every game until past rank 10
---
As a side note i dunno why you are complaining about sabo and luck offerings, its better than them just doing gens.
---
yeah killers who leave are biiittttccches
---
Actually you should be role-playing as trapper by trapping miners in a mine irl
---
This update broke the game, my friend can't play at all.
---
So you disagree with my second point, but how about the first? Do you prefer the bleeding of Deep Wounds or was the original black and white better?
---
Tell me about it, being a red rank vsing a lvl 20 gets old real quick. Hopefully shit gets fixed soon.
---
No it's like the splinters but for survivors, just forces the killer to play the hag
---
Suffering from success
---
Wraith doctor and Myers are mah bois
---
a persons genitals determines their sex, IE Male or Female. And no I dont need to check there are other indicators of sex.
---
One of the basilisks fangs or a sword made of magic or some shit
---
I agree with this statement so much. I just want fun Mrs. Piggy add ons, hell i want all killers to have 1 or 2 funny add ons
---
&gt; there are other indicators of sex.
---
Such as?
---
Ok, thanks
---
What is wrong with new players wanting advice?  
---
And that's not even what was said in the post  
---
They camped around the hook to save their friend and I camped back, I wanted to know who was in the wrong
---
Cannibal has Barbecue and Chilli which is a great perk for killers, it allows you to see survivors auras for 4 seconds after hooking someone for the first time, also gives you more blood points. I’m a Freddy main and he’s pretty fun to play. He can teleport to generators. And has some good perks like Blood Warden.  Don’t buy clown or plague bc personally I think their shit tho clown I think has bamboozle which I think is a good perk. Plague is just shit. Legion is alright, The Shape is really fun to play as you stalk survivors and level up evil within, if you get evil within 3 you can instantly down survivors with one hit which is really nice. Ghost face is the same with the shape except he can crouch. The spirit is a top tier killer but kinda hard to adapt to. She also has good perks, like rancor which allows you to kill your obsession if all the survivors are dead. Haunted grounds is good too. The doctor is good too
---
Leaked shoes from the hookers
---
yeah but this time it was a group (I checked their steam later, they all had eachother added)  
---
I think with the party system it will be far easier to find people running these kind of strats that can only be countered by cancer strats
---
Or, ight imma head out
---
Exactly, I don't like camping, but their entire game resolved around camping around me to free the hook, they were throwing themselves for me to kill and complained
---
Well the Trapper is the face of DBD.
---
Rank 20s be like
---
Only for half a gen though...
---
Yea it’s the worst:/
---
Yeah, that's why the Trapper trapped it. 
---
There's also 3+ places on Haddonfield where traps can't be disarmed, and a few places on Springwood, The Game, Coldwind Farm, and Autohaven where traps can be placed partially under the ground and are nearly invisible.
---
Given that it takes Trapper so much time to set up, that he's just an M1 Killer if you avoid his traps, and that there are 3 individual Survivor Perks specifically designed to screw him over I don't see anything wrong with it.
---
Fun times indeed
---
Same thing as they. Don’t see why there’s a problem...
---
You're the one advocating for complete and rigid following of the source material, why should he be the one drawing the line?
---
It was pretty difficult, those bloodwebs were nightmares compared to what we have now. I only have one legacy on trapper and people accuse me of cheating for it but like, why and how would I only cheat for the weapon legacy?
---
or a SWF full of rank 1s against a baby trapper
---
I hate Legion, Hag, Doctor and Plague. Hags been pissing me off lately tho
---
Especially when it's after you looped them so you feel all good but nope it's just a fat fuck you to the face when they can d/c penalty free.
---
So, for example, using the "other indicators of sex," since you can't check genitals, you would consider [Zach Scuderi](https://twitter.com/sneaky/status/984161058775490560) to be female should you see this person delivering pizza.
---
Yep that's exactly what I thinkg when I got NOED especially when they got Adrenaline
---
sometimes on xb1 you have to restart and choose the profile when you load back up
---
Here's news for you: you do have a problem with transgender people. You think they are lying to you and to themselves. And that's a problem. And using caps doesn't make your argument any less wrong. And can you explain what you mean by "at the core"? I thought penis = man, is a penis someone's core?
---
This looked way better in my head. Just like the hair physics were.
---
When you say clown has the best dlc your referring to dick length and circumference right?
---
They literally said I was a baby killer
---
Gender and sex are the same thing, they literally are. You cannot change your sex, it's biological. You'll never be a women, you'll never be able to change your chromosomes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system
---
Nah i queue solo and use it
---
It's quite common; most killers move from chase to chase to chase
---
I mean i didn't put any words in your mouth, you just confirmed that you think a penis is the core of men's identities.
---
Is it still at the neck, or at the face now?
---
Since this conversation is about semantics, it makes sense to narrow down the terminology. 
---
Does what you're saying include putting the recently unhooked, and then subsequently downed, survivor on the hook immediately again? Or, are you referring to denying the escape, and going after another survivor after downing the unhooked survivor?
---
Holy casual racism Batman.
---
Also it's Coldwind.
---
As the other guy already pointed out, there are different descriptions.  
---
If you look like a female, but you were born with a dick, then your sex remains male.  
---
However her appearance, demeanor and most probably her wish is to be seen as female.  
---
That's why her gender identity is female.  
---
Although her sex is still male.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system
---
It literally is dick = man, pussy = woman. it was like that and always will be. You're not a snail, you're not that one bird from borderlands who changes sex during its lifetime. You're either male and have a dick or you're female. On the off chance you're that one person in 100,000 who's born as hermaphrodite good for you, but taking pills or claiming you're a woman doesn't make you one.
---
Dude.. I asked for his opinion on the matter of where he considers it too far off. I dont even know why this needed to be explained to you lol
---
I was playing against a rank 20 Myers and I used head on so he dc’d
---
A penis is what determines if someone is male or female. That is what i said. Nice try on putting words in my mouth once again. Seems like you resort to making people say what you want in order to make yourself look better.
---
Meta builds do include perks like Dead Hard, Iron Will, Quick and Quick, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike and now (IMO) Inner Strength and Fixated (Fixated more for playing against Spirit). There are other good perks but these are probably the most meta right now.
---
If you don't like Dead Hard and you can make use of Balanced Landing then that's not a bad choice. Lithe for me is only useful in Houdini builds with Dance With Me and Quick and Quiet, I simply don't use Lithe because I do not trust windows in this game. Sprint burst is just garbage tier unless you're playing against a Legion.
---
Respect to him for leaving you alone.
---
Adrenaline is a great perk, dead hard can be useful in some situations, decisive is iffy, self care is really only useful if you dont have a temmate around
---
Offerings guarantee that you'll go to that specific realm/map. In the code it's not a "100%" chance, but you'll never see another map if it's sitting at 99.9%.
---
I like your strategy. I'm not sure how else I'd buff her honestly.
---
Im Sorry I Get Matched With Rank 10+ When I'm A Rank 2 P3 Nea
---
Yeah, you're missing something. 
---
Mending is still a thing, it's just that you can heal before you mend if you so choose.
---
Stop flexing on me ;( /s
---
Thank you :)
---
Survivor: I dont need selfcare i will just use a medkit
---
Franklins Demise / Overwhelming Presence: Im about to end this mans whole career
---
Gender and sex are [not the same thing](https://www.who.int/gender-equity-rights/understanding/gender-definition/en/)
---
I have decent games when running add ons that make you move faster while crouching and that make the survivors stay marked for longer.
---
I've also noticed that when I'm in a pallet loop chase that if you crouch down in the middle of the chase that there's a chance the survivor will double back right into you.
---
Above all..practice makes perfect  :)
---
I was just watching that
---
Ds is fine. If ur scared of it slug til a minutes up
---
Why would you want poised in a locker build?
---
Im a rank 4 and I have to use almost every game for being tunneled the second I get off the hook or being proxy camped and then tunneled in the end game.
---
It doesn't count as a escape for survivors.. and boo who they lose all of the 0 rank points they got from me looping them.
---
I agree with that but it's not going to happen any time soon because the change they did make at least makes it bearable
---
I meant what I said....
---
Dedicated servers won't fix this. Sorry to break it to you. 
---
This was a hit caused by latency and latency will still be a thing with servers.
---
so many self cares
---
&gt;Dying Lig
---
Yes i can confirm this too. 2 times happened in a row for me aswell. Lost like 100k points at least cause of it. +1
---
If you have a portal available, you can slow tbag with Demogorgon
---
What dimension do you come from.
---
not to mention incredibly ignorant. smh
---
I’ll take it you haven’t seen the movie then lmao
---
Once you get the hang of him he's fairly decent.
---
When you're in stealth mode keep an eye out for the other survivors that you're not trying to stalk as they might end up revealing you.
---
Hopefully a killer main will comment and give better and more detailed advice.
---
Well honestly just like you said, giving the survivors a reason to cleanse is the ideal buff for her, it's just what form does the buff entail.
---
One the one hand making her vomit slow the game down more is great, but how big is too big and how little is too little? I mean, survivors already don't care for Thanatophobia on her cause what it adds like just less than 13 seconds to a generator (Let's be honest they obviously don't heal so Thanatophobia only has one aspect to her)? That's like nothing nowadays given how quick gens are already. So it'd have to be more than Thanatophobia cause ideally it should be baseline to her kit, but again, how much is too much?
---
There was an idea I had where it could interrupt repairing by like forcibly making you break a gender after an amount of time to force you to cleanse, but is that too much? Is that too little? If you can get people to cleanse Plague will be in a very nice spot balance wise cause Spirit/Nurse will still be better than her. But what you should do to her is tough.
---
You could maybe just as a little fix make each gen completed give a corruption pool like that Ultra Rare addon she has as baseline cause let's be honest that addon is fucking shit and causes depression to every Plague player when you get this out of an Ultra Rare box instead of the one that shows auras of people vomiting.
---
Idk, she's hard to balance because if you make it so that you absolutely need to cleanse she may be too powerful, but say if the tactic is to have 2 uninjured and cleansing while 2 are vomiting and broken then that'd be great too, but is hars to theorise what will work and not break the game and make the children cry.
---
I dont gotta tunnel them. they're easy enough to catch.
---
Does it force the killer to turn into that against their will, or does it wait to put the survivor in a lobby with said killer?
---
DS is in the most balanced state it has ever been. Either wait 60 seconds, go for someone else or just get over it already. And stop falling for bait grabs. We had to adapt to use it properly. You should learn to adapt too.
---
Claudette working on a gen? That's unpossible!
---
Haha true but would still be funny to see Meg doing a Billy chainsaw stance, I just want more than pointing and waving, killer deserve some too maybe a throat slice emote
---
I'm just trying to help you see the flaws in your argument. But you're stuck in your mindset, so there's not much more I can do for you without resorting to personal attacks. Cheers and hope you feel better buddy
---
Who cares stop looping if you’re so upset about facecamps lol
---
When this happens I’ve also been unable to escape.
---
Just looked it up, glad I haven't
---
Played for 4 hours a few nights ago and only one game was I against anything higher than r14 (I'm r6).
---
Tunneling is when you focus on only one surv and ignore everything else.
---
I only play killer and I only have legion as a dlc killer and legion became quite difficult after the "rework"
---
I'm desperate for more original characters. The Nurse and Huntress especially have such creative designs and lore. I want something new that I haven't seen before
---
When I see a freshly hooked survivor, I ask myself, "WWJD" (what would Jaws do)? Well, any Great White would go after the "easiest to kill" prey and not concern themselves with anything else. So whoever that happens to be at that moment...
---
u rite but i still KEKW tho
---
Fuck off

---
I actually think that might be my friends and I. We play map roulette. One of use brings in the game map and the others all Bring in a different map. We hate the game map so that’s why we use that map as a constant map and then just bring in a random map.
---
I’m in agreeance 100%
---
Indeed, but NOED and BBQ have counter play. Sadly WGLF is useless and it needs something else, something similar. Perhaps it needs "When you unhook a survivor gain 25% stacking bloodpoint bonus after the match, stacking up to 100 and reveal the auras of all survivors within a 64m range for 4 seconds."
---
I was a frequent watcher of his and even gifted a bunch of subs once. 
---
One time though some guy gave him a tip, something like "you probably shouldn't have tunneled that guy down and went for that gen instead." It was pretty harmless, lacking any ill intent and true. When True read it he freaked out, getting super defensive and acted like someone just insulted his entire existence. Like he way over reacted. His chat then, of course, attacked this poor guy to oblivion. They were literally bullying this kid, calling him names, telling him he needs to leave and blah blah blah. The chat did it for several games, even after he apologized and said he didn't mean to offend. 
---
True did NOTHING. I personally think he loved the fact that like 30 people were "defending" him. 
---
I private messaged the guy and told him I'm with him just so he didn't feel so attacked and alone. 
---
Ever since then I have steered clear of any TrueTalent content and think very poorly of him and his community.
---
If you're that good that you're downing and hooking all 4 of these guys within 60 seconds then I doubt you'd be complaining about this kind of scenario.
---
At least Quentin doesn't have a big meaty dick like you David.

• Platform: PC

 • Description: I'm stucckkkkk
---
 • Video: https://youtu.be/0mhqSv0gHYI
---
What’s a grammar kid?
---
Type of Issue: Frame Rate
---
Description: When playing as The Demogorgon, all frame rate is reduced and almost makes playing him impossible. I believe the only time frame rate isn’t an issue is when your traversing the upside down but I could be wrong. Just haven’t touched him much due to this which is sad.
---
Technically Demogorgan is the fastest possible a killer moves but I'm not saying anything.
---
I think this is an excellent post and highlights a real problem with the game. But, 625 BP isn't jack for a survivor dc. It hurts the killers potential BP gain, but it also makes the game a lot harder for the rest of the survivors who don't plan on dcing. Both sides need to be punished in some way.
---
the words of a very wise and open-minded person
---
in this game, you can lead horses to water, as the saying goes. 
---
I regularly play with 1,800 hour players who cant loop to save their lives.
---
It was the first pic I found of a quitter bonus. Didn't feel like queing up until I got one of the 16 I usually get in a day
---
Pennnywilly?
---
I am ok with different perk types, but not same perks.
---
As for survivor, you need to have one exhaustion perk (but there are multiple good choices, and it depends on your playstyle).
---
As for the killer, you must bring some gen-slowing perk (again, variety — pop, ruin, etc).
---
However, adrenaline and NoED are not good perks, as they often tend to limit the variety. This way, they are designed to be too strong, and must-have, making all other perks useless comparatively speaking, which is nowhere near as good as it should be.
---
Ghost face and plague
---
Yeah I’m using that rn until the shrine of secrets decides to give me all my stuff because I hate having to play other killers to get their perks. It’s definitely working well
---
How bout no
---
Just space out your drinks and make sure you have a full stomach before drinking. I personally hate when I say dumb shit while drunk, it's fun at the time but not so much the next day lol but DBD is very fun while drinking so I say do it.
---
so basically, of you use meta perks on killer, then it's ok, but if you use any of those on survivor, you are an instant pussy?
---
I upvoted to 68. Whoever gets number 69, enjoy
---
Not only that just refer to them as what they are now, shit that’s what the whole point is right?
---
Haha, in the nicest way possible I'll continue 😎🔦🔦
---
If you cancel it,you hit them with normal m1s. That explains it.
---
I like how she is now tbh, but if I buffed her, I would probably make sickness slow survivors before breaking them.

That's not balance though.  Pallets without loops don't do anything.  Unsafe pallets don't do anything.  They're just free hits for killer.  I've gotten that map with numerous killers and it's been a clubbing everytime.  Very killer friendly map.  They can't keep chases going on that thing.
---
Yeah that happens at times 😥
---
The meta build covers all survivors. It consists of :
---
No Mither
---
Self Care
---
Pharmacy
---
Left Behind.
---
Super solid even your teammates will thank you for sticking to the meta in post game chat!
---
The face, but Neck area will still work.
---
Wow these comments are becoming toxic
---
When you’ve been playing the game since beta but stopped playing during the legacy event 😥
---
Soooo what if I use Flip-Flop and Buckle up paired with Dead hard and DS?
---
Oh that’s buuuuuuuullshit
---
I don’t think that’s worth my time to prove to an anonymous internet user. You either believe me or you don’t.
---
Yea, and people say the Perk is bad. Like it's really good and can save your life at moments.
---
As someone who's been playing a lot of Trapper lately, I really dislike it being random as well. I'd rather have a set time for how long you have to struggle to get free.
---
That way I don't have to worry about a trap being set off across halfway across the map and ending up useless because the Survivor escapes immediately and gets away. It'd make choosing between an active chase over the trapped person less uncertain, because you could gauge how long you need to walk to get to the trap.
---
It also would make the traps actually more useful for map pressure because you know how long at least one person is occupied. Make it so people helping the trapped Survivor speed it up too.
---
In terms of instant downs, sure. But 8/16 meters is higher than 0.
---
Devs should add survs getting blinded by flashlights too. Just for the meme potential.
---
I love when they do this, I tell them to check my achievements (For date of proof for reaching P3 before Legacy) and they say, "Doesn't matter I'll still get you banned."
---
I really just want Joel from the last of us as a survivor but I guess a clicker as killer would be cool too though I'm unsure about what their power would be
---
About once every ten matches or so, I can’t use Dead Hard, I cant wiggle, and I can’t escape out the exit gates. I’ve noticed they are correlated, so I just DC when I realize I can’t use Dead Hard. Very frustrating.
---
Understandible have a nice day
---
Every time I strayed away from **DS + BT** for **Head On + Quick &amp; Quiet**, I ended up facing a hard camper followed by tunneling killer. Immediately making me regret not having DS + BT.
---
No I'm just saying survivors don't really need them they're more so insurances they get to live while killers actually need them
---
I feel like every map is terrible for wraith except maybe lerys and the game
---
Same thing on PS4. So frustrating.
---
Nah
---
Lmao
---
That was fast
---
I agree it helps in all categories of the game
---
Explain
---
Being the killer is not fun at all because of this. In fact being a survivor and watching my survivor teammates do this shit is not fun either.
---
This game is just not fun unless you are stacked AF.
---
Yup they've been huge pussies had about 5 dc against me last night and these were all legit babyrages no Dying Light Glitchers.
---
Weird as in r/dbdgonewild territory?
---
When you get home, there's gonna be another story on your house.
---
So many concept named "ripper" in this year on reddit...Also please fix your grammar
---
Noice. My first perfect game was with spooki girl, and whoooo boi that was a hell of a game.
---
I mostly play them, they’re useful if you can use the ability properly and using a mori gets it done much quicker
---
Killer was sick of their shit and brought a mori
---
This is the most biased thing I've read on this sub all day.  There is literally no difference between a killer running meta perks and a survivor running meta perks.  None at all.
---
Going by past shrines, I feel like devour hope might be in the shrine soon so you could get very lucky
---
Yes and no
---
It doesnt help with the most important things you do as a killer. Finding survivors and chasing survivors . Thats just me i dont wanna stand still as a killer
---
Pallets without loops are for making distance. You can vault over the pallet/go through the pallet, the killer has to go around (or they could risk getting it slammed on them), which means they usually have to take a longer way, which can give you enough time to get to another pallet/vault. If they're free hits for the killer, it's cause you're looking at them like you look at those ultra safe loops where the killer can't play around them and they have to break it to proceed chase. It is a killer friendly map, yeah. But I've ran killers around on that map, it is possible. You just really have to profit off the distance you make. Going against enduring and spirits fury can be hard on that map but it isn't impossible to face. That map is especially good for lithe and balanced landing
---
Pop is really good now post-buff, but Ruin is still the undisputed meta for killers as it well should be, as too many of the killers don't have gen pressure without it which just makes games a walk in the park.
---
Idk if my reading comprehension is crap here, as I'm not sure whether you mean good in general or good for the meta, but I'd argue Adrenaline is the only good situational survivor perk tbh; free health state, 5 second sprint burst and a quick wake up if you're playing vs Freddy. Yeah it takes up a slot until the end, but it doesn't require anything to activate it bar doing your objectives. 
---
NOED isn't good, is reliant upon survivors leaving the totems alone, and is a crutch for killers who aren't very good.
---
Ultimately I think having a meta is unavoidable, but that perks like Ruin/Adrenaline/BBQ etc. are all necessary, as to nerf them would be to force survivors or killers into using perks that don't fit a build or are straight up unviable, which makes it unenjoyable for the players. They'll never be able to find a good way to balance all perks and actually make you think twice about what to equip, so it's necessary to make some perks must-haves.
---
My current build is Lithe/BL, Adrenaline, DS and Distortion/BT. I rarely switch from those unless I'm doing a meme build, and I doubt I'll change my loadout at all barring significant nerfs or buffs.
---
if they unplug, you don't get to keep anything. I've had several matches the past couple days where the killer DCed and I got no points at all, but I got to waste my offering which is nice.
---
Don't be mad cuz ur bad
---
When the matchmaking actually works
---
Lol!  Oh god I can already tell this one is gonna be good.  So just for curiosity sake you're against your opponents running meta perks so surely you yourself don't run them either.  I mean I'm sure you couldn't possibly be a hypocrite right?  What's your typical killer loadout look like these days friend?
---
Yea I guess so, actually I guess all perks are just insurances
---
So far, our experience is that our rando forth matches the rank of the killer, *even when we get there first*. If you do feel bad, maybe try jumping lobbies until the 4th is respectable in rank
---
thanks cant wait to get thank you for once gg
---
I dunno it has been always fine fir me
---
My luck EVERY TIME with traps
---
&gt;don't play with bbq, ruin, noed, pop, discordance, nurse's calling, bamboozle then
---
BBQ **helps** survivors more than you think.
---
That's a thing? Never happened to me I just 0 pip
---
I’m still liking Ghostface better than Myers. But I only use his power for the Stealth, I don’t actually try to use the expose at all.
---
110% support this topic. Can guarantee you the support team (i.e Peanuts, Patricia and Gabrielle/NotQueen) check this forum everyday. Keep up the excellent content.
---
Ya there’s some pretty... Rough parts of that movie to say the least :P
---
It's .25 more cooldown on missing. They're gonna be making it so you can break pallets with the shred
---
And Hag
---
Id take party streamers over maps so everyone can use them more often
---
That's the thing.  The pallets are so unsafe there is no need to break them at all.  They toss you go around the incredibly short loop immediately and take your hit.  And those are the ones they tossed.  If you catch them at one of these pallets they haven't tossed they are effectively trapped like rats.  The only way you pick up distance on that map is if you're playing a potato that breaks every pallet midchase.
---
And that’s not even counting the travel time which easily adds 10-30 seconds
---
Except when a survivor has kindred and everyone can see you twirling around eagerly thinking your going to trick someone into stepping into your web
---
Yeah when’s that happening I want it now !
---
Do it! Be careful or else you might end up puking more than the Plague.
---
How in anyway is it trash ? It makes healing takes forever.
---
Yeah. You are right.
---
Sorry about the NoED thing then. I swap between playing Identity and DbD. In identity there is NoED perk called “detention” which is a NoED you can’t cleanse (but has limited 2 min duration when the gates are powered). It is a must have perk there, which is annoying at times both for killers (resorted to use the same “optimal” build) and, obviously, survivors.
---
Was that before or after ghostface
---
Because he could spam shred to go faster than normal speed. His shred ability isn't to do that, since he has portals for mobility instead.
---
yeah, as it turns out leaving other people who are trying in a game where they have a massively reduced chance to win or enjoy themself because of an unfortunate situation is in fact a dick move.
---
With the new pipping system it’s pretty good to go for the unhooker. You need to get as many chase, hit, hook points as possible. If you always go for the unhooked you’ll likely end up with less hooks and chase points. Unless of course all you care about is the w and not pips or bps, then chase whoever you want.
---
Before, but I highly doubt GF is in the running
---
I think a cool cosmetic would be [this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2F66.media.tumblr.com%2F45b86f131fadb4af42cebc2925e488b5%2Ftumblr_pmq8zjmP0w1uqglbzo1_400.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tumblr.com%2Ftagged%2Fhalloween%2B2007&amp;docid=zelpwdyZ1yuumM&amp;tbnid=-hYWzcV6bLlEGM%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwjt0KSwgePkAhX_ITQIHfbJCr8QMwh2KCcwJw..i&amp;w=355&amp;h=600&amp;bih=969&amp;biw=1920&amp;q=michael%20myers%202007%20remake&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt0KSwgePkAhX_ITQIHfbJCr8QMwh2KCcwJw&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8) from Rob Zombies Halloween.
---
Oh shit that happens to survivors? Omfg I’m sorry
---
Depends on whether or not you want people to heal more slowly. If you can land hits on multiple survivors, it will slow down gen rushing a bit. You can also use it with certain add ons to really benefit like Leprose Lichen for the Demogorgon lets you see injured survivors in the upside down when moving to portals. I know Otzdarva uses Sloppy Butcher in quite a few builds. He describes it in this video in some example early game builds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_yixIT0p58
---
No headset? The under $50 chinese ones on amazon are actually pretty good, you should consider if on PC. Makes sense though, id run OoO id deaf though.
---
You can? Its under custom game
---
It can be good to keep survivors busy healing also pair it up with nurses calling it can help you catch them off guard if there healing
---
Similar artsyle to darkest dungeon, I'd like to know too
---
As usual, rank?
---
Lol, haven't played on months, went to play a couple Killer games today.
---
First game I brought my best Perk loadout in Myers and 4ked a bunch of Baby Survivors. Second  game I played a Wraith with just farming perks and tank into a team of Green ranks. 
---
Went back to a kitted out Pig and 4ked a bunch of one Perk Survivors.
---
Closed the game and moved on.
---
to be fair im a surv main just decided to give killing a try a few weeks ago
---
Bloody shiny butthole.
---
So many michael but you have hag up there.
---
You know we should start using perks as meme formats
---
They do but not getting hit isnt a counter. Your insidious counter makes sense because you're preventing that situation from happening altogether. "Not getting hit" is either skill or chance, breaking totems is preventing it from happening altogether=counter.
---
I JUST MISSED UPVOTING TO 69 NOW I’M LEGALLY NOT ALLOWED TO LIKE IT DANG IT
---
The problem is he's shit in stoping loops :(
---
IMO legion accomplished the hard task of being both boring and weak. But if you use things like tanathophobia, sloppy butcher and ruin you will be able to more boring and probably less weaker.
---
Me after a fun night out with the boys
---
Yep
---
Mmm toothpicks.
---
Expect people dcing as well...
---
Rank 9 is it just me or are the most dcers in green ranks?
---
i don’t count that much as if he hits something it stops him. while mike myers is continuous
---
Plague is sick.
---
That's pretty much a r/TIHI
---
I love red ping survivors complaining about my internet. Like if it was me who pressed their ready button.
---
Purple Rank Tier 3 Whispers is the only good whispers. Because it usually covers your terror radius and works exceptionally on Stalking/Stealth Killers (Myers to find more people to stalk or tier 3, Ghostface, Quite obvious why its good on him)
---
will you love me? owo
---
Now ur just meming me
---
This isnt related to the meme but does anyone else agree that it's ok for wraiths to camp as long as they dont go for the person that just got unhooked?
---
I see where you are coming from, but you are wrong. Not getting hit is about skill only, and if you think are good enough to try and argue that insidious is not the best perk then you probably should just not get hit.
---
I might be going crazy but I think it was much brighter and shinier and looked better when it was first released. I got it for my Dwight because my thought process was I never even see my killer.... I never use it anyway.
---
Ive been meming since the first one
---
Amen
---
Myers is temporary  and needs to be charged with direct eyesight while the Hillbilly can pop his sprint anytime.
---
Errrr...
---
Dedicated servers aren't live yet.
---
I would say one of them definitely died coz of farming.
---
Who the hell mains wraith?
---
Oh xD
---
Because most i've seen are. I report every legacy i come across if it's a private profile (or obviously hacked = achievements don't match).
---
I wasn't always like this, and I wasn't talking about replies to me.
---
Are you scraping your ass along gravel?
---
Stfu, it’s viable. I like him.
---
fuck off
---
I wouldn't have teabagged but i definitely would've walked away in silence
---
But then everyone on this subreddit will lose their fucking minds if they find out you used a "dissaproved" perk.
---
The same way Amanda "too weak to hoist Detective Kerry into her own trap according to her own universe's lore" Young gets David King onto the hook.
---
The Entity increases and modifies all of the killers' strengths.
---
Unfortunately, the game rewards tunneling. It is the optimal way to play most of the time.
---
For some reason every few games the game acts like the killer disconnects immediately after I leave the match and for what ever reason the game then no longer accounts for my WGLF stacks. I’m maxed on stacks and earn around 25k points but only get rewarded with those points
---
david has a perk that increase BP earned, up to 100% bonus, by safe unhooks and taking a hit fro friendlies, claudettes self care can be nice, as well as neas quicker crouch speed
---
Fuckin' preach. 
---
"Here, bust your ass for 10-15 minutes for 17k bp *if you're lucky* and don't have one of the other three dipshits disconnect. Enjoy!"
---
So **fucking** sick of solo queue.
---
You know this isnt the Stranger Things reddit and not everyone finished the series, right?
---
Thanks!
---
Well I really hope I can at least choose my add-ons
---
So... just the legion theme?
---
A total badass cosmetic would be [this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.syfy.com%2Fsites%2Fsyfy%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F920x514%2Fpublic%2F2018%2F08%2Fdemon_freddy.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.syfy.com%2Fsyfywire%2Fthe-15-most-insane-freddy-vs-jason-moments-on-this-its-15th-anniversary-week&amp;docid=99ggwyQqV2GlUM&amp;tbnid=ex9RsddfNIbIdM%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwjt6cH5iOPkAhVpGDQIHWQpCIwQMwhfKBgwGA..i&amp;w=920&amp;h=514&amp;bih=969&amp;biw=1920&amp;q=scary%20looking%20freddy%20krueger%20freddy%20vs%20jason&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt6cH5iOPkAhVpGDQIHWQpCIwQMwhfKBgwGA&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8) I could definitely get behind a Robert Englund skin.
---
You gave credit to original source! Here is an upvote
---
Oh shit Oh fuck
---
Yeah, I think that could be changed to a little higher. Calling it garbage is wrong though
---
I looked into it and these both look like a bunch of hoopla.
---
"wohoho never have I seen such a toxic dweet"
---
Hag no, Ghost Face would be but he and the Entity are #brosforlife so he'd probably intervene. Pig and Legion are screwed if David found alchohol and got drunk during a trial though. The Entity would probably make David hook them
---
Well, I think they are designed to be overpowered. Don’t get me started on One-hit-hatchets.
---
Similarly, survivor red add-one (instant heals, flashlight hotter than the sun) are hell to play against too, sometimes.
---
However, survivors forget that the game designed to be so that 1 survivor perk = 0.25 of killer’s perk power. Otherwise, killers would be screwed much more than the survivor, and it makes some sense that killer’s add-one are so op. (Imagine 4 insta-heals on one survivor).
---
Instasaw Billy is not that bad, surprisingly. I played AS instasaw billy, and it is not that strong (surprisingly, I find normal time be much more convenient and useful in loops and to 99%). It messes up with muscle memory, similar to all the Nurse’s addons. (Oddly enough, those are two killers who do not have ultra-rares).
---
Similarly, I found pulling people off gens as No-sound-Spirit difficult too, even though I play her quite well. In a way, it makes very little to no difference, aside from some pulls. In a chase, mind-gaming people is also slightly easier, but only if they made it out of the husk’s terror radius, which happens very rarely/some exhaustion perk was depleted. 
---
Some red add-ones are relatively nothing, except some convenience (Ghostface, Hag, Spirit, Legion, Wraith mb?, Pig, Freddy, Demi (pallet breaking will become base kit soon), Trapper etc.)
---
While other are, well, insta downs and that is it (Myers, Huntress, Clown, etc).
---
The only true good ultra-rare addon’s are those, which change the way the killer is played (those are well designed and fun to use). 
---
(Doctor, Michael (Tombstone one), Spirit (Movement speed/no marks), and so on.
---
As for the NoED, it is, counterintuitively, a game stalling perk (clean totems, or be damned). And by the time the totems are cleansed, you got those few extra-hooks, making the perk have practically identical effect on the overall game. 
---
Of course, some of those can be abused, but it does not mean they do not convey the right message.
---
Just bought the plague, she is so underrated.
---
Nobody ever sticks to the "dont cleanse" rule, so 4ks are pretty common.
---
Darling you’ve got to let me know
---
What about monitor and abuse
---
Still, the servers were bad that day
---
She was giving him extra points
---
These are nice, now I want Joel as a survivor even more
---
They’ve been following him for a couple years.
---
If it was my meme, it would be exceptionally bad and low quality.
---
The theme song for when Legion was released was a metal/rock cover. Kind of like how Clown has the carnival cover and the Dwmogorgon has the 80s synth cover
---
Leather faces hammer hit right before chainsawing them always makes me cringe. I feel as though that singular blow would be enough to end them right there
---
Run scoob would be the funniest thing ever. Absolutely amazing chapter idea.
---
my favorites are the last 4 released. this might be me being a bit biased, since I do Main Legion, but theirs are my favorite, followed by Demo, Plague, and Ghostface, in that order
---
Well as someone who greatly enjoys awful memes, I personally would still upvote :3
---
SPOILERS YOU FUCK
---
Idc ClaudettexHillbilly best couple in the game
---
Here is a guide made by one of the best killers in DBD, ScottJund: [How to Run All Generic Tiles as Killer - Dead by Daylight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ)
---
You can't prevent looping but, what you can do is chase survivors in a smart way instead of just holding W. 
---
First of all, try to get the pallet down ASAP. Don't pause every time the survivor approaches the pallet (afraid of being stunned) or change directions completely just to avoid going near the pallet. If the loop has high walls, change directions to shorten the gap even faster while also hiding your redlight. Once the pallet is down, don't mindlessly break it, force the survivor to the side that will either push him to a deadzone (an area where you previously broke other pallets) or he will have to run past you, reducing the distance gained.
---
Yeah you're right tbh, glad we had this conversation! Think we're both in agreement that the devs need to think about balance going forward, but then again I think the game's in the best state it's been for a long time.
---
Legion should be best at never giving the chance.
---
It’s fun for me. Fun is subjective.
---
No, You cant chose addons and you can only use M1. You will also spawn on old coldwind maps with infinities.
---
^(/s Its a joke post)
---
Bruh 😂
---
well, either they cleanse or they are permanently one-shot and loud AF, kinda a lose-lose situation for survivors
---
Just play the game and stop complaining. It becomes a lot more fun when you don't take shit so seriously.
---
I go against at least 1 legion a night. My experience with Demogorgons is them using their tunnels to tunnel the person who gets off hook right away.
---
*Curb your enthusiasm swells in the background*
---
It becomes tunneling when both survivors get a healthy distance from the hook and the killer goes for the one that was on the hook, but sometimes that is a coincidence so truly the killer has to go after the unhooked person both times confirming the kill. Being farmed and being tunneled are two separate things that are so intertwined by salty survivors.
---
Ok but I have a somewhat decent explanation for this ship
---
I know its great.
---
I'm sure it's awful to play against, but I've never seen another plague player.
---
If they are just really good and giving you a hard time on a loop that is difficult to catch a good survivor on ignore them and go after the players working on generators. A lot of the time a SWF group will have someone who is very good at looping and will try to distract you to keep you off the objective survivors.
---
I appreciate all the memes on here too!
---
I would love Joel as a survivor so much, or Ellie since she'll be grown up in 2
---
You're not wrong. It's 60 seconds of free fuck around time by idiots who think that quick hopping into a locker counts as them getting tUnNeLleD.
---
What is?
---
YES!  
---
Adiris is my queen and I'm glad she's getting the love she deserves.
---
I have an headset but i don't use it 'cause reasons.
---
I could use a headset, play in swf, play range addons Nurse and use a green mori every games.
---
But then i'm not a gamer anymore, i'm just trash.
---
*^^all* ^^killers ^^mid-lunge
---
You probably camped and tunneled
---
What servers?
---
Why the fuck would anyone want to go to the game?
---
Legion could be best vaulter tho
---
Don't respect pallets and don't try to bloodlust safe loops.
---
In my experience the camping gets worse as your rank gets higher.
---
Oh I hear you. I like both perks. They’re solid without being overbearing in any way. Balanced, as all perks should be.
---
Now, for God's sake, he can't even drive a car!
---
Sure it is totally normal behavior, but doing it twice in a row to a survivor that has no way of protecting themselves from the farming is BS. Sure it isn't tunneling but it should be noted that it is a toxic thing to do. I get that it is good for the killers game, but that one survivor was just forced out of the game because of external forces completely unrelated to them.
---
its the same for me and Clown. people really underestimate the power of AoE slow in a chase-based game. When survivors notice what I'm playing they are like 'phew, free win', quickly followed by being proven wrong, yet I never ecounter clowns when I play survivor. Plague and Clown are really the sleeper club of the DbD.
---
The only reason I havent bought plague is that even watching her gameplay on twitch/youtube made me kinda sick, I've dealt with enough vomit during my short bartending career to not feel the need of introducing it to my free time
---
I swear, a bunch of teenagers and kids flood this sub and it lacks so much maturity and respect. Y’all are some clowns
---
Legion one had me in stitches
---
Best DLC because of Kate ♥
---
I'm pretty sure it's just my mouse. It started acting up in other games too. Just got a new mouse so that probably should fix it.
---
Left Behind
---
His power doesn’t need a change, you can’t base it of going against weak survivors. Standing 5 feet in front of him aiming your character at him you’re gonna get exposed. You don’t reveal him by aiming your character at him. The centre of your screen has to be be looking at more than 20-30% of his body. But your own character can block this that’s why you get exposed. He’s very hard to play against average/good survivors. Not weak but an average tier killer.
---
left behind its bills perk
---
Damn, you really pissed off the limp-dick bigot crowd.
---
Good.
---
Pretty sure it's been broken for a month and the enormous pool of prospective players has just made it waaaay more visible. I wonder how post-demo sales are going to be impacted by these thoroughly broken lobbies
---
Dwwwwwight! That’s right!
---
As a hag main, “worlds okayest killer” is not an understatement
---
Lol if you wanna ruin his day, let the other survs escape, and block his escape, endgame will iill him
---
Tunneling is literally the killer chasing after you right when you get off the hook.
---
I mean it's one thing to let someone open the gate, it's another to screw with people for that duration. This isn't that bad, but I've seen much worse with doctors
---
David is the most important survivor to level when it comes to teachables for me - We’re gonna live forever (WGLF, level 30) and dead hard (level 35) are 90% of the time my choice of perks. Usually running bond and iron will with them
---
Thanks for the tips! I’ll watch that video now!
---
Type of Issue: Can't move
---
I was playing dbd fine this morning, until I returned to it in the evening. I cannot seem to walk continuously by pressing W - the W key is fine, it types fine, it repeats, fine, it works fine in other games (tried Witcher 3, NBA2K), just not DBD. Anyone experience this?
---
Trapper mains rise up!
---
I'll give Bunny Mom worlds #2 Best Mom now that Steve is here
---
Imagine needing a terror radius to tell you where the killer is.
---

I must've been Stalin in a past life to deserve this!!!
---
Great idea
---
Are *you* in good hands?
---
Absolutely. Permanent one shots? Yes please. I often rather people not cleanse, especially when running thanatophobia.
---
Right now I’m a rank 11 Killer I got a 2, 15, 18, and 13
---
I remember back when maps weren't free (swamp and institution). you couldn't use their offerings and it will not burn unless you buy the DLC. now everyone gets to choose maps.
---
"worlds okayest killer' Ok, that one is NOT cool. Thats insulting. 
---
"Lookalike Contest Winner"
---
there you go hag, you sexy  minx
---
Cheers for the massive spoiler matey GJ.
---
There’s two of those things?
---
The regular ones
---
Yup I camped and tunneled one guy so then the whole SwF DCed......you’re a moron lol
---
Somehow I also notice that if I press W and A, I move just fine, and I move just fine afterwards with just W too.
---
But just pressing W from the start will not work.
---
Good luck
