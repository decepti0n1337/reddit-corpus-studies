My experience has been endless prayer beads spirits. People using them up while they're still broken I guess.
---
You seem to be forgetting the fact that closing the hatch starts a 3 minute end-game timer now. Didnt used to do that before.
---
That's one clumsy football team that the killer had to chase after...
---
I need 10 heals... 3 more to go out of 5 games
---
How would they be rank 17 and not know what a pallet is
---
Which is weird, because when they rolled out the new policy they specifically said trash talk is fine. I was under the impression that as long as it didn‚Äôt directly insult someone it was allowed. I think the issue is that it‚Äôs an automated process, so when it‚Äôs too short for you to appeal it you‚Äôre screwed by it
---
Nurse still has the ability to traverse the map quickly and to ignore every defense mechanism survivors have. She ain't weak. It's just that her blinks feel stubby without her old range add ons, and her recharge mechanic feels clunky as hell.
---
Spirit, is getting hits to all her best add-ons, is losing her potential to play the killer shack for hits after the pallet was dropped, and can no longer tell when she's run into a survivor in phase (which is a much bigger deal than it sounds). Despite all that, none of these nerfs make Spirit *feel* any worse to play.
---
Nurse dropped off the face of the earth after her nerfs, even though she's still the strongest killer in the game.
---
Spirit is gonna stick around.
---
Nerf pig?
---
Bruh, ultra rares on survivor are pretty stupid as well. Gens already go way too fast with toolboxes and then you slap insta percent with BNP on it? Insta-blind flashlights? Old insta-heals? Just....no.
---
Sure, some killer ultra rare add-ons are broken as shit as well, but at least it is only one of them instead of 4 BNPs on commodius toolboxes.
---
Placebo Effect (noun)
---
A beneficial effect produced by a placebo drug or treatment, which cannot be attributed to the properties of the placebo itself, and must therefore be due to the patient's belief in that treatment.
---
In other words:
---
The placebo "works" not because it does anything, but because you think it should.
---
So in this context; you "see" the shards glowing, not because they are actually glowing, but because you think they are glowing.
---
I guess it's easier to just say "WAAAAAAH THERE'S NO COUNTERPLAY PLZ NERF" instead of learning the matchup lol.
---
Why do the challenges rely on sandbagging yourself or you team?
---
Want to play together? I can PM you an steam friend code and we can hang out together and ‚Äútry‚Äù to have a good time, haha.
---
I love all the perk ideas though, my personal favorite is Cat's dead, details later.
---
I was fucking back to camping pallets like a rank 21 with that challenge and the "pallet stun the killer 2 times in one game". What a disgrace lol.
---
Hell I just popped syringes and styptics. Instant depletion!
---
The joke is that there are people like you out there who eat it like a whole onion.
---
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt expect to see an actually joke on this subreddit, certainly welcome, got anymore?
---
My philosophy when i watch content creators is, if i would get annoyed playing with the person in chat- i probably won't watch them.
---
Nerf ME
---
Gen repair noises can be used to hide loud sounds like healing, though, so maybe they won't notice it.
---
I don't think Otz is that similar, he plays rough, but he gives explanations and his whole gameplay is like analysis, critique, and improve. He teases too, its an interesting balance.
---
You kinda just proved my point , there is no way they can tell who got it legit or who bought or is selling them. Better to just give it to everyone :)
---
Rancor should be great on stealth killers now hey?
---
For a starters you need to either A) all tag team one gen, which is risky because he can TP to it but it gets the gen done the fastest. Or B) heavily split all gens on the map making sure you don't 3 gen yourself. This makes it borderline impossible for Freddy to intercept all of you on gens. You cannot have an in between, its either you tag team one gen or split them. In my experience option B has worked most reliably.
---
Of course for this to happen you need to take advantage of your early game where none of you are asleep (unless RPB) and maximise gen speeds. Make sure to be having long chases and wake up whenever you can.
---
If ur on that gen and can‚Äôt see that totem u blind and deaf
---
Yup - It's a mess out there.
---
There is something pure about that
---
I still feel like I'm in my 20's, I'm in my 40s though. Fucking life man.
---
Hell yeah it‚Äôs 270 time boiz
---
I own it as well. Why do you care so much? ^But ^muh ^exclusive ^cosmetics
---
I really like trapper tbh, pick 3 gens and gradually set yourself up around them cutting off all loops.
---
Otz is the most wholesome and informative killer main ever: Hes the best!
---
I'm of the mindset that they should just give a big ol' "fuck it, let's do something crazy" approach and add in extra Prestige levels that give cosmetics like that to every character. Adds in a ridiculous extra level of grinding for anyone who really wants those cosmetics on whichever character(s).
---
I don't understand killers who going full sweat mode when a survivor DCs.
---
As a killer, a survivor DCing early is a sigh of relief for me since it means I can take things easy and goof around with the survivors for a bit instead of having to sweat and try my heart out for that first hook to get the ball rolling since I play low to mid tier killers who don't have high mobility.
---
Reach for the Clauds.
---
No, but I fapped to it nonetheless.
---
NONE OF YOU ARE HELPING!!
---
100% man. People say it's salty survivors, but I cannot count the number of spirits I play that are horrible at playing pallets or loops and can only get downs with their power. Just bad gamesense and little knowledge of survivor movement and pathing, most of those run stridor because they even need help hearing. Spirits that are actually good at killer in general are terrifying, as it's with them you see just how busted spirit is.
---
Yeah, I never leave the safe house without it
---
I even spun in the Clauds.
---
Can confirm grabbing someone from a locker does not count.

Looping should be bannable, for sure. And jungle gyms are cancer. And the kill shack should be nothing but a basement.

Shoot we might‚Äôve been in a SWF/KYF but not friends if that‚Äôs the case. It‚Äôs really weird though, because we learned that the game starting to offering is one continuous map
---
Tap tap wouldnt install the game for me.
---
Lol, you said the need wouldn't happen anytime soon. Proven wrong.
---
Got you..........good talk.  Bye.
---
Clown has absolutely no pressure, meaning that even if you get a down in 20 seconds (pretty fast), gens will likely pop by the time you can get to them. Add the fact that most good survivors actually know how to loop Clown (yes you can loop Clown, it just requires wasting more resources and playing safer), and all of a sudden you've gotten a couple downs but all the gens are done.
---
Spirit 2 yamoka drift
---
I only support this comment because it's just toxic on toxic, so it balances out.
---
So why are you proposing to add an extra ability that does something she can already do? Whats the difference from the survivor not knoing where to run becouse there are 5 clones around him and the survivor not knowing were to run becouse there is a real hag and a clone that could switch at any time?
---
You eather don't know how to use her or you are just thinking about flashy powers without considering if they actually do something new or usefull for the character.
---
For me the second option is much worst than the first one, so I gave you some credit by guessing that you just didn't know how to play her.
---
Yeah it just wasn‚Äôt a good game aside the subject matter
---
You are forgiven.
---
Did you find a solution. Having the same issue on PS4
---
He looks like an oily frizzy haired rat that hasn't been splashed with water for over 2 years, I can SMELL him from my screen. Absolutely unbearable. Bold of him to be this toxic and rude looking like that
---
That shit happens to me all the time through windows and I freak out the same like fucking how not even close its really annoying. At points Id wish they'd take a month or 2 stop dropping new shit and iron out hitboxs fps matchmaking bugs etc. Id rather have a much smoother and better experience then continuously get new shit that breaks more.
---
Both your and the Feng‚Äôs reactions are great. The little pause like, ‚ÄúWait wHAT?‚Äù And the turning back and forth like, ‚ÄúDid that just happen? You saw that right?‚Äù

Now we just need the POV of the person you hit. I imagine it‚Äôs something along the lines of,

Starting to hurt visiting this subreddit.

What?! I get this map far too often!

Psh, that's nothing. I got facecamped before because I was a "runner."

---
If it wasn't for seal six SWF teams which is wholly unfair, wouldn't bring out Mori's to curbstomp people with.

Sad thing is, I did backup. I backed up a lot. Unfortunately when I lost my legacy they had just migrated the saves onto their own servers, so I couldn't replace them.

I really tried my best and prepared as much as I could, but the devs still managed to let me down.
---
He gets to teleport to the nearest locker and when he rushes out of it the John Cena song starts playing and the killer gets blinded
---
Both very solid, though I find Spine Chill more useful overall.
---
I still dont know how the terror radius works when uncrouching, how does m&amp;a help with grabs?
---
Hag, I get to rank 1 consistently.  
---
Bubba slides down between 5-8.

I'm not saying he's top tier, but he isn't abject garbage.
---
Formal petition to get this to happen?
---
I still hate how they nerfed her terror radius from 28 meters to 32 meters
---
I'm already an absolute unit, so I'm expecting that shortly
---
Just wanted to go for something crazy is all. She was sitting behind a hill so I think my only angle on her was a super steep one like that too. I also just felt like YEETING it over the tower and seeing what happens.
---
It's even better when the killer hangs around and you know they're losing emblem score for it. Go on. Stab me again, I love it.
---

means ace in the hole is active , you have a passive luck boost

"No idiot we're all wearing different charms you toxic tunneler"
---
Good Legion would be nice
---
I think quite a few of the killers could do with a little buff. Trapper having 2 traps as standard would definitely be nice
---
I love it
---
Only thing I'd recommend other than playing her a lot is to always try and throw a hatchet at someone if you have a shot on them, don't worry about missing. There's no trick with learning the distance on her hatchets other than playing a lot of games with her. The more hatchets you throw the better you'll get at throwing them basically.
---
Rank 13-14 from Rank 8-9(?) after reset. The Meg went on a tangent about how they're a Rank 4 (They were Rank 14 as well) and criticized that I couldn't get bp above 12k (I got 19k almost 20k this match and killed everyone), even going as well as to say they were "bored" after I called them out for being salty. I responded with a screenshot of the scoreboard and told them to get therapy because they were seeking validation from a fictitious rank system.
---
Wow you must be young lol this is Xzibit from Pimp my Ride. This meme format has been around for a long ass time
---
Up the ante, ace in the hole gives you extra addons when you search chests.
---
*unzips pants*

It's never been like that as far as I remember. Not for the past year at least, it's always been the same.
---
wtactualf
---
yeah, i know the meme and it‚Äôs origin

just haven‚Äôt seen it in like 8 years

Nope. It‚Äôs been the way it is for a long time now. I hook someone and you get bonus healing speed to others for awhile.

The placebo effect 1)only effects the subject who the lie has been told to ( so i wouldnt have an actual succes rate. How lucky can i be?)

---
Would it really hurt to just unlock Legacy on all for someone who at the very least unlocked a full Legacy outfit?
---
Honestly people getting high and mighty over exclusive cosmetics are the worst either way.
---
Up the ante. You or another player has that perk which increases all survivors luck by 1% for every survivor alive.
---
It is annoying when a perk gets countered, yes. That's part of the game.
---
Okay, I didn‚Äôt know that, thank u. 
---
Still, those add ons change her base kit, so they have unavoidable setbacks incorporated to them, which is what iridescent head should have, an unavoidable 1 hatchet in the belt
---
I thought dumbass Feng's were a thing. I swear every game with a Feng has her doing the most frustrating shit ever but I'm sure you're just being hard on yourself :)
---
Killers can do a lot to personally fuck you over. They can camp tunnel and 3 gen you if they really try. I personally havent had a huge issue with being stuck on 3 gens. I've have survivors do it to themselves before though when I play killer. I'm sure it could be fixed easy but as it stands it's not the biggest issue in the game and not a lot of people talk about it enough.
---
Not surprised lmao
---
Just take my fucking upvote
---
[removed]
---
Adding a reconnect option would be good,  however the idea of not letting the killer know would be problematic, as a killer main if people dc I usually take it easier on the remaining survivors, so if I didn‚Äôt know they dced I would just keep killing them without mercy
---
Honestly survivors should just stand under hooks and wait. How dare they even try to run away at all?
---
Steam: Stennick
---
Looking for SWF that won't DC just because they got hit at the start of the match or because or any other strange reason. Basically just tired of playing solo every match and either being left to die on my first hook or getting three DCs' in the match and being squatted down in two minutes.
---
I can't even begin to explain how bad of an idea this is.
---
Cool dude you play vrchat? Whats your username
---
Lol I'm dying. I love when I get a 3 or 4 kill and (usually the first person I killed), messages me and tells me I suck
---
looking forward to what you make &lt;3
---
Why y‚Äôall so salty i had this too and the killer and me laughed so hard after that
---
DING DONG UR MISTER WRONG GO BACK TO START
---
And I'd assume this is for perks like BBQ or daily rituals that require hooks. Not to trick the killer into wasting time on a survivor that doesn't even exist.
---
Yea, on those its really your fault but maps that are more square are insufferable if you dont have 3-4 survivors left
---
I used the 4 hexes prayer beads on Spirit for this but I did it by just walking up to someone who was slowvaulting and picking them up and didn‚Äôt even get a single grab with prayer beads
---
"bUt ItS eAsY tO gEt PoInTs As KiLlErRrRr!!!1"
---
That‚Äôs the game though. Which gens you work on are already up to you. The killer can do stuff like trap some of them, but not all killers have traps. They can over patrol some, but if you‚Äôre smart you can lead them away or do other gens and leave them with no kills. Some killers can pressure the whole map effectively in which cases 3 gen hardly matters anyway. You just need to pay closer attention to what you are doing.
---
I watch Otz and Umbra. Her humor is a little different but I enjoy it more than when I first started watching.
---
Remember what happened to Bethesda when we thought their bugs were cute too?
---
"Is that a Snickers? It tastes so good!"
---
If it's more desirable to be at higher ranks, then people will fight for it. But until that happens, until there's something to fight for, you won't be able to dissuade folks from playing shittily.
---
üéµ Here comes the Crapper... Better watch out for his craps...üé∂
---
I don‚Äôt understand how 360ing works. Like as killer I go to lunge and someone and they walk in a circle and I somehow miss. I don‚Äôt get it.
---
I just wish this game had functional bots so I don't have to tank my rank trying to learn her.
---
(Do you have other places you post too?)
---
Yes because it's a literal hole big enough for a fully grown adult man to yeet through of course you can stab someone through it.
---
but self care is totally absolutely 1000% useless haven't you heard
---
you should've gotten one of your teammates to heal you instead üóø
---
Not if you're the last survivor in the trial, they don't lose any emblem score for that.
---
I hope he let's you do that to him.
---
No.
---
Honestly this is the best way to get people to play. They need to start giving out rewards for reaching rank 1. Until they start doing this, then nothing will change
---
Possibky, but it's definitely not a guarantee.
---
I enjoy the challenges. It helps players step out of their comfort zone and hopefully helps expand their strengths as whichever character they are playing as.  
---
However, im that sweaty mf that ignores everything because i want 50 trapper charms and the rest of the fucking serum!
---
I decided I‚Äôm playing friendly for first week of every tome. People need it.
---
Why do you have to hurt me with the truth?
---
It's the Entity (Nea)
---
Also happens on Auto Wreckers with the bus.
---
Exactly, no need to t-bag if the survivors are just playing well. But if this bitch t-bags and flashlight spams all game you bet I'm gonna t-bag on their DS-thirsty downed ass and then murder the dumbass who unhooked them.
---
"Thank you, I-I made them myself *laughs*"
---
&gt; They need to start giving out rewards for reaching rank 1.
---
I'd argue that the rewards need to be inversely proportional to rank, so that everyone gets something. I'm never going to be a rank 1 killer, but if the rank 8 killer I am gets 1/8 of a rank 1's extra rewards, then I'd be just that much more likely to give good games.
---
Thank you.
---
First time on the shrine
---
Yeah I guess that‚Äôs it. But still
---
should i? I have an art instagram, but i just started making DBD art. Do you want that info?
---
3 gen is something survivors do to themselves 99% of the time. You‚Äôre wanting the game to be changed over something you have control over.
---
Plenty of dlc perks have been in the shrine for the usual price
---
Should've specified. Recent dlc perk.
---
I've had a game as old freddy where 1 survivor was in the basement, and the other 3 were all asleep around the basement. I could see them all crouched around waiting for me to leave, waving and clicking at me. I know you're all here, I'm Freddy, what do you expect me to do?
---
I personally think it‚Äôs enough as it is, if someone is working on a gen with you you get bonus BP for cooperative work, and you get objective points by opening gates and doing basically anything with someone else. I‚Äôve maxed objective points plenty of times, it‚Äôs not that hard. I do agree somewhat with what you‚Äôre saying, but gens isn‚Äôt the only way to get objective points.
---
if anything, AAA means low quality in 2019.

There are definitely good and bad content creators. I usually watch No0b3, Scott Jund, Otz, or Ashlie9596, to name a few
---
How do you know that's the reason they DC'd?
---
For context, I brought in a honing stone and a purple bag. This was his first hook, and he dc‚Äôed on the stairs. I didn‚Äôt care until I saw it again and thought it was some wood sticking it as a bug
---
Yes.
---
It's dbd reddit,  so no.  Lol
---
I can predict the future.
---
He's slipping back and forth between the present and the future
---
Tbh they should get English translators :D
---
last week this wasn't happening survivors are dcing when im not even chasing or about too hook them and it usually right after a gen completes and its usually the third gen, if a survivor hasnt completed a gen yet they failed so they just dc
---
so yes I dont know for sure but theres strong evidence supporting my case this happens more then once this week
---
i straight up thought 'yea cause it was like two years ago' before it hit me that 2020 means 5 years and not 2
---
Pfft whatever
---
I refuse to run Self-Care on principal so I feel like that challenge is a personal attack tbh.
---
1. You can get like 2 skill checks on a gen or like 20. It shouldn't be random.
---
2. Prove thy self only works if you have teammates working with you which you'd know didn't happen if you read the post.
---
3. Boldness get's up really quickly. Between chasing, totems, and pallet stuns it's maxed out very quickly. Plus that literally does nothing to help with the objective category. 
---
4. I'm not complaining about not getting bps fast enough, I'm complaining that if your teammates and distracting the killer and saving each other while you do gens you get almost no bps. It doesn't make sense that you do all the work while your teammates get all of the profit.
---
Survivor:I'm going to try to do this challenge for bloodlines
---
Also survivor: Dc's and loses all their bloodpoints and challenge progress for that game
---
Like seriously how stupid are people, it's btter to just finish and get your BP.
---
Ikr
---
I'm pretty sure they mentioned this in their developer update, something along the lines of wanting to focus more on gameplay and bugs other than these huge events and updates
---
Damn she farted on my-
---
The only way to was close and reopen everytime it happened unfortunately
---
The non licensed characters have their own fancy names, the licensed killers are the killers name.
---
This is why I keep running detective's hunch with a map.
---
well if they know its mathematically impossible to do the challenge anymore like the 3 gen one, they just dc so they can get another game sooner to go for the challenge, 
---
there needs to be a DC penalty like if you DC the next game you cant work on a challenge
---
Couldn‚Äôt they just make a T4 that doesn‚Äôt remove items and perks and just goes to a max level Web, which would then reward legacy skins when people convert over to it.

I have the dlc for Clown and Legion. Everyone else was purchased with auric cells

You're a bit of a cunt I see.
---
you're a wizard, harry
---
K
---
I did the same thing. Sometimes u gotta do what u gotta do
---
Ya but thats just events Im talkin period like cosmetics either take an extra month and release a chapter or mid chapter later then normal and focus on giving us the most important things for the health of the game
---
Gens, Skill Checks, COOP, and the exit gates are the main ways to get objective bps. Most of the others rely on the what killer it is or the hatch. 
---
Gens only give 1250. 6250 if you do all of them.
---
Skill checks are completely random. You can complete a gen and get no skill checks or you can complete one having done 30+ skill checks. It shouldn't be rpg deciding if you get bps in that match or not. 
---
COOP is relying on your teammates. If your teammates are focused on doing gens then this can go up really fast but if your team is focused on running the killer around and saving each other than you aren't going to get any points. 
---
The exit gates are really helpful for getting bps but there are only 2 so if any teammates beat you there you're out of luck. Sometimes you can just simply run to the other one but if the killer is chasing you at the endgame you don't have any chance of opening one. 
---
There just isn't a reliable way to get to 8k bps in objective. I don't think that all of the actions need a rework but it doesn't make sense to sit on a gen for 80+ seconds only to get 1250 bps.
---
Ouch
---
I'm afraid you are alone in this.
---
Actually having DC's pause challenges without telling the player would be perfect.
---
It'll punish those that are instantky joining a new lobby after dc'ing.
---
I been playing for 2 hours and still haven't finished that challenge
---
Are you sure? I heard you can do it with teammates as long as you're on it when it finishes.
---
\*At all\*
---
FTFY
---
I think she says "pretty good job so far"
---
git gud
---
So with keys and hatches as a solo que player feels balanced. In my 400+ hours I only recently got my team to hatch escape with bo coms. That was after a dc and bond being the best perk in the game.
---
I fell
---
Yeah I‚Äôm all for the change, I‚Äôm not acting like it doesn‚Äôt fix anything, I love what they did
---
but the main thing people complain about is the pallet scenario and not having much counter play, especially if the killer runs stridor which makes it even easier
---
So I dont think this change will even affect high level play, at most the vault animation will help survivors react faster, but the non collision doesn‚Äôt affect much except body blocking, because if youre literally inside a survivor, you will hear them breathe
---
I‚Äôm the happy one! I would never disappoint you.
---
I don't think they suck personally, they're my favorite cosmetic sets in the game. I really like how they glow although it makes it easier to see you its a risk im willing to take. especially as a claudette main so people cant call me blendette LOL
---
I have been gone since just before Ghostface came out, came back to the overwhelming amount of shit to do with archives. And honestly I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I just had one with sabotaging hooks, and I just maxed them to the point that I could just tap them and destroy them, saved two people doing this and we escaped. It‚Äôs definitely allowed me to break the old Meta monotony that got boring because it wasn‚Äôt worth using anything else.
---
For me, it‚Äôs spirit
---
It comes back gradually over 4 seconds. So, say 1 second after standing up, your terror radius is 25% of its normal size. 
---
Without monitor and abuse, at 1 second your terror radius is 32m*0.25= 8m. 
---
With Monitor and Abuse, at 1 second your terror radius is 24m*0.25= 6m.
---
If they're having fun is that such a problem?
---
And I'll go around damaging gens and closing the hatch for extra points, it's a win-win. Idk why some killers like to stand around and wait
---
Take your loss as a lesson and do things differently I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. It‚Äôs part of the game and it‚Äôs not going to change you‚Äôre just going to have to figure out how to not 3 gen yourself. The killer doesn‚Äôt have much reason to press you that hard and keep chasing if they don‚Äôt have to because you screwed up.
---
After looking at the situation more closely i am lagging by pressing any button on my mouse or keyboard if i leave it alone i don't lag
---
Too OP. Dev's plz nerf.
---
If it makes you feel better, dream demons or w/e aren't real, so they can't ever hurt you.  
---
  
---
Hatchets on the other hand ARE real and definitely CAN hurt you though.  
---
So make sure you buy my [Hatchet Shielded Bed!](https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Lubes-Percent-Silicone-Lubricant/dp/B07J1TWYG2/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=barrel+lube&amp;qid=1573868693&amp;sr=8-3) to protect yourself from any intentionally or accidentally thrown hatchets while you sleep.
---
That's ridiculous, hatchets aren't real, if they were, we would be in trouble.
---
I have a teir list of survivors 
---
Won't kill protect at all cost
---
Kate baby dwight's baby Steve's 
---
Will kill if I have to but will aways get the hatch
---
Feng bill jeff nancy 
---
All others are fair game
---
Nailed his speech pattern lol, gets annoying after a while
---
Too tier shitpost OP.
---
I'll definitely try his videos then! Thanks a bunch
---
demi is fun to watch! aaron plays (i think thats his youtube) is another funny/not whiney survivor main you might like. he‚Äôs really good at the game
---
Why does he look like manlet Wolverine?
---
It's good but my OCD
---
To be honest they need to do away with these "all in one game" challenges. I get it's meant to make them more difficult, but it can sometimes ruin the game for everyone when you're off self caring a sloppy bucher hit or purposefully ignoring gens to find people to heal or hook saving with borrowed time to get technically safe unhooks but not really. Just stuff like that where you play the game different enough to where it impacts the whole team negatively.
---
Then again this could be considered a killer buff.
---
I swore they said we would be able to continue to chat in the end lobby after the killer left the match. Kind of strange eh?
---
Yea but idk, his content is kinda stale after a while. Noob is innovative
---
The Communist
---
I printed a 16x20 version of this and put it on my wall. Great content ‚ù§‚ù§
---
Give them some privacy!
---
Is it just the Switch or did Prayer Beads get the "nerf" everywhere? On Switch it now emits the sound all across the map just like how they said it would be AFTER the next ptb finishes.
---
"Reality can be whatever I want."
---
And he brings you to the entity :)
---
It's because Leatherface is technically a paragraph, like left behind paragraph
---
Bad driver/add on software?  Yeah got nothing for that one.
---
Haha, you changed up one of your perks in a few matches? Haha, yeah, you're a real mother Theresa! Don't worry, I have no problem believing that you mix up ONE of your perks every now and then! How old are you?
---
And dw, I run lightborn every now and then too, so I guess we're both taking it easy by your standards then!
---
And I never said I don't say gg, I say gg every match that is a gg (I.e, no blatant genrush, toxic, rage quit and so on). Now it's up to you to be honest with yourself, would that be often or not? I havent said anything about me not saying gg. 
---
But hey, you addressed the lesser arguments in my last comment, which was a small minority of the text, so I'm guessing you don't have anything to say to that :). I know I went back on my word, but I just had to reply, the most logical thing is that that was a bait, because it was so ridiculous, but I don't care, I just had to x)
---
Dont you mean WAAAAAAA
---
Don‚Äôt talk about my husband like that
---
I think a reason they keep the pallets looking the same is so new players can tell what is a pallet that you can throw down, if it's your first time on a map and you run past a rock you might not think that you can drop that like the tree in the last map you played (examples of if they were individually skinned) it wouldn't be a huge set back since people would learn what can and can't be dropped but it helps newer players get into the game since they can see something that clearly doesn't fit the map aesthetic and is the same thing in every map
---
Yes because they are throwing the game for the other 4 people....?
---
I just lose my mind in chases sometimes, so I go from a fairly strategic player to an absolute goose just running around aimlessly.
---
I won‚Äôt disagree. Having to predict 2.5 seconds ahead of your opponent is difficult unless you‚Äôre running out in the open or have a lot of speed behind you. 
---
But even in a neutral case LF can get a pallet out of his chainsaw threat. Legion would actually benefit from taking a pallet stun vs normal fatigue. But even LF has tons of other glarin issues that I hope the devs address with a whole new power because ‚Äúgive him more speed‚Äù is not the right idea because at that point he becomes a less skillful Billy cause you can‚Äôt spin a LF
---
Not to mention the whole M1 simulator.
---
L√©gion ? Can somebody explain ?
---
So true lol, even as a streamer he's always late to his own streaming hours.  The highlight of his resume is working at gamestop, nuff said.
---
Its over Ace I have the High Ground
---
 No, we‚Äôll be Staying Alive.
---
I did the challenge by being a little scummy, I closed hatch and played friendly with the survivor and let them open exit gate and at around 99 grabbed them, let them wiggle out to open gate and win.
---
Isn't this image based off that edgy over-head view shooter game? What was it called again?
---
&gt;he's probably the worst killer in the game
---
You take that back right now!
---
Just as often the killer will smack the window sill while you're mid vault. Windows as a whole need to be more consistent.
---
I did it my first try, so
---
Damn no one on Xbox huh? Took a hiatus from dbd and hoping for a friendly group to play with as I get back into the game.
---
Xbox gamer tag: TMPO Proxima
---
holy shit.
---
Huntress is in her own limbo of a threat. On the right map, she doesn‚Äôt need to walk everywhere because her hatchets can provide an insane threat range. Now I‚Äôm not suggesting every huntress is Zubat/Scott level of amazing but when you go against a practiced huntress, she could be a third of the map pressuring multiple people. 
---
Ghostface has two unique types of map pressure, one being a fucking ninja who randomly threats a section of the map, two having the ability to instantly cut chases in half with prep time. By that extension, his map presence is just as high as if he had access to high mobility.
---
Why is this a thing?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
That's about as good as a shot gets, congrats dude
---
22 here.
---
This sub is full of bitching killer mains lmao
---
Sounds good, but Biohazard is WAY to strong. Injuring survivors is painfully easy and preventing them from healing themselves at 3 is crazy. Make it 5 to prevent healing and that is its only effect or make it a Hex Totem.
---
Long live DBD.
---
I see a lot of people on Reddit complaining about how the game is dead to them because of something they don't like and all I to say to that is:
---
IF YOU HAVE COUNTLESS PROBLEMS WITH DBD MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T LIKE THE GAME. MAYBE YOU LIKE SMALL ASPECTS OF IT BUT NOT AS A WHOLE. 
---
My advice: 
---
Uninstall. We don't need people bringing the community down like this.

Your money could fall out of your pockets, its a killer perk that makes you drop your license and ID on hit. It's called
---
Karen's Demise
---
I mean, it's a little of both, but I think it just differs with regions.
---
The Shine perk seems a bit pointless. It's a perk that only has the use of countering another perk.
---
Other then that, it was a great read! Interesting idea imo:)
---
here's johnny- break a pallet faster, AND cause 2 nearby generators to POP!

Usually you then load in as that killer on the lobby and you can continually play the killer, even accessing their bloodweb.

Wraith imo, shadowborn is good maybe but the others meh

I wish I could like Freddy, but whenever I run into one they‚Äôre running the sweatiest shit. Forever Freddy should be what they nerf next imo
---
No one is doing that with ds, and if they do; just hit them, let them ds you, and then hook them and they can't do it again. Not really a big deal. You're still chasing 1 person and keeping them off the gens.

I versed a demigorgon running a basement build with territorial imperative. He would hook the basement and place a portal, then as soon as territorial imperative went off he would portal back, even mid chase. Was so toxic but it worked.
---
I‚Äôve always hated quintin, every time I see him in my lobby I assume he‚Äôs probably got 2000+ hours and he‚Äôs going to dunk on me as killer. A week or so ago I bought him and decided to embrace my inner hatred for him, p2 50 now just saving up a mill and using up his shit.
---
I mean that with dedicated servers, nobody is a host. All 5 players connect to one server. If the killer leaves, the survivors *should* still be able to talk to each other, because they don't need the host to be present.
---
Play the TrueTalent way it‚Äôs much better
---
Nvm, figured it out, it's called 'Hatred.' Literally just had to search 'edgy overhead shooter' lol
---
23, I can't play as much as I'd like. I got a 4 year old and 6 month old daughters I gotta take care of. On top that, I work nearly 11 hours a day.
---
ah, so youre an angry survivor, i see
---
Only like. 8. I hop between For Honor and DBD too often. Im on a mission to get nurse teachables rn tho. So I've been grindiiing
---
Okay, but there clearly is a pattern of host disconnecting that stops people from talking after the game. It seems to be random as well which makes me think it definitely is a player we‚Äôre connecting to and not a dedicated server.
---
cute! üò≠
---
So half of the power is just brutal strength... Ummmm...
---
Ave DBD, Ave Behavior
---
How do you win the chase though if Killer just leaves the chase to close hatch?
---
He does have an Axe.
---
Seeing the same meme format over and over again it's boring.

Damn. That's. Crazy.

Yup, I'm somewhat of a sadist, I always look forward to rank reset

I finally got to do this last week. A Laurie was trying to bait me after unhook. Like, following me and flashlight clicking and everything. So as soon as she jumped in a locker I trapped it before headon could charge and just left. She was stuck in that locker for the next 10 minutes while I hunted down the blendette. She finally slow exited the locker into my trap when she saw me coming to her, that was the funniest after game chat I had in a long time. She didn‚Äôt get upset or anything, just laughed along with me and said she‚Äôd never even thought of that
---
Wraith or huntress tbh
---
NOEFD
---
Huntress
---
If they‚Äôre in a locker they‚Äôre untouchable. Can‚Äôt slug them because you can‚Äôt hit them.

Fucking facts shes way too short
---
It astounds me how many people think Spirit is unbalanced but keys are completely fine
---
When is this going down
---
37 here. Just 5 more challenges on level two of the tome.
---
I don't think they'll be that generous, lmao. But I would appreciate something like that, or maybe bloody versions of that cosmetics.. still it wouldn't be that fair for those who didn't have them. The rarity difference will not create more exclusives, yet it will give some credit to those who earned or owned them before the giveaway. 
---
It shouldn't be as it is now, as it is just unfair for those who got some of that stuff earlier.

dude u dont have to be a dick about it even other players like Otzdrava have had the same problems
---
I don‚Äôt think every killer needs mobility, and I was never said they did. My point was every killer needs some form of map pressure. And clown has neither mobility or map pressure. For most killers their mobility IS their map pressure and that‚Äôs enough. Huntress, like I said is special and so is GF. A killer like Clown may never be an inherently weak killer as long as the meta stays the way it is. Having fast chases doesn‚Äôt mean much when you gotta slog it across the map for 20-25 seconds.
---
Either that, or the sweatiest survivors known to mankind. I swear whenever I bring a bps in red ranks, It‚Äôs like I am asking to have three gens done in the first minute of the game. It works on both sides... sadly lol
---
The only thing that needs to be reworked with hex totems are their spawn locations.
---
Such is life on Volg
---
The surveillance perk re-work lets you see auras of totems now..
---
I've literally been staring at the shards for 2 hours with my friends to see a glow and we can not see anything significant
---
Bring a map lol
---
How about The Caretaker instead of The Jack?
---
Of gens not totems?
---
Try detectives hunch
---
Poor doctor
---
Surveillance is a pig perk?
---
2 more tiers of Tome 1*
---
Spirit was unbalanced, in a big way, because of how saturated people became with her. She became the most viable killer, an easy one at that (I am a fucking potato and I 4K as her) and the ‚Äòonly‚Äô way to stand ground against swf, so everyone that wanted to sweat played her with op add ons and shitty meta builds. So, of course, people grew tired of facing the same killer whose power makes it very hard not to be a secured down once you are injured
---
If every survivor brought a key to every game, toppled it with adrenaline and idk, dead hard I guess, then yea, you would have a point. But the dimensions people like to paint of how often survivors bring keys, especially coordinated groups or multiple keys in a single group are so so so disproportionate to reality it hurts
---
Things can be unfair, like moris, iri heads, keys; but they become unbalanced if they are a base kit for something, either a survivor or a killer. If every survivor had the capability to open hatch, it‚Äôd be unbalanced, yea, but them having to put it on or find it and then survive with it till hatch is just unfair to the killer to a certain extent, like moris are for survs
---
My opinion tho
---
Succ
---
Zappy boi needs more attention
---
I dont play bubba so forgive me if the change is actually needed, but doesnt every killer get a slow down while charging their power? Billy, Huntress, Demo get slow down, Myers gets slow down while stalking, Freddy doesnt get slowdown while putting snares but fuck freddy, even spirit has an activation period.
---
Oh shit my bad Detectives Hunch
---
Nea is the N-word
---
Detective Hunch**
---
Hex totems aren‚Äôt overpowered they are just an annoyance
---
Oh yeah it‚Äôs good now too :)
---
I swear to god, I see glowing. Either I‚Äôm a tard and imagine shit. Or your blind. Seeing as y‚Äôall see nothing I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm a dumbass.
---
Tome: do 3 gens in one game
---
Me: ok that seems easy enough
---
Doctors with a mori, ruin, and unnerving presence: ***THIS IS NOT OKIE DOKIE***
---
Yea I was like ‚Äúwow they actual made it viable‚Äù
---
Yes, you have 70 days overall to do the tome, with challenges spread evenly between that.
---
We're now in week 3 now so by Wednesday/Thursday your aim should be to make it to rank 21 (1 tier = 1 day) so you're ahead of the minimum pace already.
---
Keep in mind 2 weeks of passive XP was added to the start by accident though, but the challenges are the biggest chunks of levels.
---
"there were riots in the streets" you pretty heavily implied it.
---
YOU need to work on your wording.
---
Moris were such a good idea as well.
---
Just looked it up, didn‚Äôt realize this was a thing. Looks pretty legit actually.

Just the Entity‚Äôs way of protecting you from the sandbag.
---
I guess Small Game, Detective's Hunch, Maps, learning spawn locations, 1000 Boldness, and Inner Strength doesn't exist
---
What you're calling "throwing the game", someone else might call "engaging in the only other objective BHVR has given us". Why is your definition more valid than someone else's? Why does it matter if you win, if you have fun playing? What if YOU'RE the one "ruining" the game while someone else wants to just goof around (and the game incentivizes doing so)?
---
The video contained no actual evidence of her shards not glowing. I tried doing my own research, but unfortunately nobody seems to have tested it out and posted video evidence. I‚Äôll have to test this myself on a custom match when I have the chance.
---
Bruh...small game, detectives hunch, map. Or literally look to your left cuz you probably spawned 3ft away from it.

It doesnt cause 10%. Missed skillcheck does. SUrge do not trigger skillcheck.

Not true at all, a good spirit can still keep track of them by listening for footsteps, watching grass, listen for breathing, looking for any scratch marks, etc etc.
---
Different comment because I'm curious, what do you think the biggest problem is right now, what do you think the devs should change to help genrushing and loops and which streamer or YouTube channel would you recommend?
---
‚ÄúThe Author‚Äù(?)
---
Strange and interesting, thank you for the information. Also how long does it take for the pig to uncrouch again?
---
This is correct, i did it last night just by finishing gens teammates were working on, so you don't have to do it solo, or do 100% of the gen. It's worded awfully and it makes it sound very difficult
---
This is actually brilliant since I think Doctor is getting a rework.
---
Power: Lenin's last breath
---
All survivors share the same health state, for example, if a healthy survivor is hit all survivors are injured, if downed they are all downed, if any survivor heals all survivors will become healthy. Survivors may pick themselves up from the dying state.
---
It says that once all other players have left the lobby iirc
---
Trapper is a solid killer as well.
---
Not the only one
---
Gotta treat him like a m1 killer unless your right on top of survivors
---
Its not from one specific place, go to r/meme formats and then search for woman yelling at cat. One of them will be this one, and if it has any text just look at the descriptions
---
Sure man, I can level with you. I'll say this. When I'm playing spirit, or Ghostface, and the few times I don't hear 2-3 gens being popped off after the 1min (genrushing)... I do calm down, maybe focus more on the scare factor, play a bit more around jumpscares, and then watching them scatter like critters, just really turning the psychopathic side to 110, stop focusing on winning, more about milking the horror factor and not the competitive factor, let them unhook each other all the time because there's nothing like putting them back on the hook again and so on. In a few cases where I see that the survivors are playing in a higher rank than what they are in, I even let 1 or 2  escape (the least good out of the 4) so they can keep their items.... But I'm not gonna lose pips just because one out of 4 DCed. Which is what a lot of survivors cry about post match "we had one DCer! You should have let us escape!" that's when I go "nah, fuck yall" and turn my winning instinct on. I'm never toxic in game chat, when survivors start their group bullying I just laugh, report and then continue with my stream.
---
I'm not saying I'll never be nice. But the second people start expecting us to be, I do my very best to jank them down a notch and show them that me being nice is a gift, not a right. And in the beginning there, it really sounded like you demanded it. Which is not a right any survivor has. It's a 4vs1 game. Not a 1 for 4 game.
---
In what way was self care useful in this situation? 500 points and negative points towards your benevolent emblem for farming the dude that died anyways? 
---
Selfish care is an awful perk to have.
---
On a serious noted if you check the roadmap on their site there will not be new map with this chapter. Just so people aren‚Äôt excited
---
And a good day to you!
---
They did say they were gonna rework doctor, or his addons at least, when they said they were going to rework the nurse.  So i'm excited for when that finally happens

Im not suprised u/stalebagelz considering your username demonstrates a wheat surplus.

20,000,000 kills, yeah I think their qualified.

I feel you, going in solo queue as survivor right now is asking to be in a 3v1 because some dude d/c at the start if the killer get them, it's really annoying and making me lose interest in playing
---
Well, he is
---
Well, that is factoring in perks, but Michael's main "thing" seems to be that he has lower power than Ghostface in exchange for his advantages being automatic. Well, the other way around, since Michael came first, but Ghostface can eliminate his terror radius, while Michael has minimal control but has a smaller one. Ghostface can much more easily down individual Survivors, but he has to be able to stalk each one, easy as that is.
---
Although in most cases, Ghostface doesn't need to down more than one Survivor at a time, anyway. In practice, it's much better to have more power with a higher skill requirement, especially since Michael's skill requirement to fully use his base kit is exceptionally low.
---
Breaking totems against a spirit? Big oof
---
Well, the devs being lazy is another issue, although that does suggest Ghostface at least seemed too strong to them to give much in the way of options.
---
They said in another livestream that the roadmap is just the minimum that they will do. They even said that there might be a possibility of having a new map but they didnt made any promisses
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
Jesus dude grow up a little will you?
---
im not doing the challenges till later on.
---
i‚Äôm now very unsettled thanks op
---
Oh, you mean like... Complaining about camping? Aka, doing the objective?
---
I mean he is a self described noob
---
They‚Äôll be coming with the next chapter release and will seemingly be free
---
*OUR* new killer
---
that's me, and I main Steve. Funny thing it triggers *Camaraderie* so I get some extra time for BP
---
No cause camping leads to you losing because the other survivors are doing gens. Also my name isnt related to dbd but whatever. Someone who complains about looping is too delusional to talk to.
---
Evil ash you mean?
---
1. In the movie, Jack sabotages the radio and the snow cat to make sure Wendy and Danny doesn‚Äôt easily get away.
---
2. If the survivor successfully hides/runs from the killer, their aura is revealed for 10 seconds (depending on if that survivor evaded the killer before). 
---
3. I feel like The Shinning was something fans wanted slightly more then Ghostface because of how well Ghostface and The Shinning fits with DBD and everyone might get/use jack for a while meaning the perk might be in use for matches where Jack gets used. 
---
4. The perk would work exactly like that.
---
Watch trash, become trash.
---
Sorry.  I don't like her morbid obesity.
---
He can consistently get downs I guess
---
i don't mind playing as her, but every time i encounter a plague as a survivor i want to dc. i think it's just the amount of retching and vomiting is almost viscerally upsetting for me even though i think her concept and design is really cool. similar to the doctor in that i think he's conceptually cool, but one of his sound effects is way to close to the feeling of brain zaps when i'm off my meds and i hate it.
---
right now i've got a real hate-on for hag because i'm trying to do the 15 hook saves challenge and you just *can't* against her. does that count?
---
Killer ones have actually been easier compared to the survivor ones for me, lol
---
Drop pallets while in a chase? Ghostface after Ghostface
---
Stun a killer twice with a pallet? Every bloody pallet respecting killer in a row
---
Heal people? HOLD STILL FOR 30 SECONDS, WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU GOING?
---
*sigh*
---
Shit, i wasn't expecting such an awesome compliment! Thank you!
---
The pig roar is supposed to be during not before :/ they fixed it but then broke it again and now dodge the topic
---
I just spent half an hour in a lobby, why would I want to play the game less.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think you're just mad because Killers bring up valid points.
---
I always get downvoted in this subreddit any time I point out that the only way to really win the game is to seize the means of generator repairs
---
All short killers cause you cant see crap, and spirit because shes way too easy to use
---
Sorry, I didnt specify. I meant in rift cells
---
Totally I know that feeling of the doctor. That‚Äôs the main reason I play killer just to avoid the doctor due to my fear of electroshock therapy
---
If you miss x5 times you gain a hit that‚Äôll hit x5 the distance.
---
It gave me a good laugh, 7 / 10 rant.
---
I disagree
---
Drop 15 pallets was soooo annoying- it‚Äôs super punishing as a very conservative looper. Some games I dropped 1 or 2, some games literally zero.  Didn‚Äôt help that one of the times I was like damn I just need one more pallet the game was like ‚Äúrunning in front of hillbilly‚Äôs chainsaw sprint then running to drop the pallet 2m away? Ain‚Äôt no chase :)‚Äù
---
Because he can get me without out playing me at all. If I step into a trap that's placed in tall grass, he gets a free hook.
---
Had one do this and he was smart and very good, all but 1 survived!
---
Wh- why?
---
Basement camper! ‚ÄúPoints‚Äù
---
I typically burst out of the locker the instant that happens.
---
love, because dinosaurs are sick and so is ghostface!
---
Well if each tier is 10 rift fragments, then 450?
---
This is obviously an easter egg featuring the Entity's secret language. This particular symbol means "survivors who hide and wait for the hatch instead of fixing the last gen"
---
Question is, Why not?
---
Pretty amusing must say.
---
Give it time this game corrupts. My bio used to be "I always give the last survivor hatch" now its "don't blame me for how you get done"
---
And then I go "LET ME OUT, LET ME OUUUUUUUUUT!"
---
This is really good
---
Or where you‚Äôre from.
---
Depends on context and trends, but usually yes. I just know I've seen people use it in that regard, like the toxic game followed by a smiley face, etc. but everyone's different
---
This is like all those 'drawing disney princesses as ____" things, but better
---
Battlefront 2 Myers.
---
Have a nice day usually means the conversation is over as you can leave now when used aggressively
---
Ghostface as a Disney princess....
---
Please do more!
---
She survived due to the hit boost.
---
I'm not sure weather to be happy to max out scoring categories on a match now or be pissed at my fellow survivors.........
---
Literally just happened in my last game. Confused the hell out of me too
---
Bloodception...
---
He do got them legs tho üëÄ
---
Ok boomer
---
Sabotaging g ens is Op and would require everyone to run the counter perk. Stupid idea
---
I think Tru3 doesn't really use stalking and he gets a ton of success
---
‚ÄúThis community doesn‚Äôt need to be negative‚Äù. Mate who wouldn‚Äôt be if there‚Äôs constant bugs and problems lol. 
---
That simple. I don‚Äôt think they game will die out but I think after the first month of every dlc it goes back to the small player base it has because it gets very stale and old. 
---
You kind of sound like the people in WoW that say there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the game. When really only a handful of people love retail (I actually quite enjoy retail). There‚Äôs problems and the community needs to speak about it. 
---
Yes they can go in a much better way about doing things.
---
Guys loook I just used Dead hard to avoid the killer's attack
---
(1,000,000,000 upvotes)
---
Special edition. Yay!
---
How could you say something so controversial, yet so brave
---
I was very curious about the rank of that survivor, so I looked up the video. He was rank 4.
---
Imagine playing Spirit and complaining about other people's playstyles being no fun
---
So are bad killers lol
---
thanks! it was accidental btw,
---
i‚Äôm so afraid of making perks because of swf so i really had to scrap so many. it could really improve if it had a team cooldown!
---
ty, i might change this one too because i‚Äôm afraid of the auras being seen a little too much if the killer is smack-happy.
---
Just saying that might not be entirely true, I remember them mentioning that SWF make up a small amount of the players base, and with crossplay coming in queue times would most likely improve; in addition I'd like to state that having SWF actually clogs up queue times because sometimes they are a trio group and the game then has to find one random dude to fill in the fourth slot; all ransoms would be faster
---
So I‚Äôm starting to think you are talking about the kind of person that just screams about stupid things for no reason. 
---
Like the people that bitched when ds got reworked or when spirit/ nurse got nerfed.
---
I share your sentiments, man. The infinite loading screen is abysmal. it makes me furious. I JUST WANT TO LOAD IN.
---
I think I say "I haaate this fucking game" out loud to myself nightly. It's seriously so broken. Instead of spending time, money and resources on cosmetics or new killers, address the current problems. Because there is a laundry list of them. And before anyone jumps my case, or yours, I understand that's what patchwork updates are for. But I think these are problems a little bit bigger than that. It's the game as a whole. 
---
My brother keeps telling to wait it out, wait it out, and reminding me it'll get better. He is a *huge* fan of PUBG, and I remember watching him play that game at its absolute trash ass worst. 
---
"Jesus man, how do you play this shit?" And he would always say, "I have the patience for the improvements."
---
 And sure enough, those improvements came. It took a year of HORRIBLE rending, glitches, being kicked from matches, literally falling out of or through the map, bullshit spawning, etc. It was bad. Really bad. I watched in disbelief that he could play a game like that, or even give it his time and money. But it all came together eventually. So when I tell him about DBD he laughs and says, "Remenber PUBG?" And I know he's right. DBD is a great game, or at least has potential to be and it's seriously one of my favorites to play right now. I'm holding on to hope that eventually it will be fixed.
---
Lol yeah
---
Everyone would turn toggle swf off cuz swf is incredibly unbalanced and no ones wants to deal with it. Then all the swf groups would cry about it and bhvr would rather cater to them than actually address how insanely powerful they are.
---
Oh please. You can like something and be a fan of something while still being critical and wanting it to improve. It's a healthy attitude to have. People pay money for games and have the right to demand quality. What you are asking for is blind fanboyism with the usual attempt of fanboy centered reasoning. "It's hard to make games don't judge!" It's hard to build a car too, I sure as hell can't build one but when I buy one I expect the brakes to work.
---
Yeah. That's the kind of person.
---
Or just go do a gen.
---
For real! ahhaah
---
Ahh my bad mate lol.
---
Any clip that ends abruptly with a Billy sawing out of nowhere is a good clip.
---
Why would the killer be sad, if everyone is mucking about healing and not doing it properly, it would be a easy 4k game.
---
And then the killers have the audacity to call you bad post game
---
Mate no one likes versing a Swf. Your idea would essentially kill the game lol. 
---
Yeah people already dodge but not always sometimes they just want to get in. 
---
But if they had an option to always dodge then you bet that option is on 24/7 for almost all killers.
---
I'd say if SWF groups complained it wouldn't make too much noise. I forget the exact percentage but it was around 10% if I remember that correctly.
---
I don't think the outcry will overwhelm the cheering
---
No prob man.
---
Ive  done it a couple times its fun to 360 them into trees. I have personally misjudged distances while chainsawing
---
Why not just make two separate playlist.? One ranked, the other one isn‚Äôt.
---
No from what I‚Äôm getting know is he‚Äôs talking at the people yelling at the screen about they need this nerfed because they don‚Äôt like it (like some guy was complaining about franklins demise...)
---
I don't understand why this is being disliked already, this would literally solve the problem by making communication harder but still possible
---
I've been in all four spots, and honestly the 4k was the worst. I even messaged the survivors beforehand one match and they all agreed to farm and let me get the 4k. but I got one kill and the other three dipped on me. that hurt so much
---
I mean, if we're going down this road again, then let's focus on
---
&gt;Just find someone
---
Why even let someone else heal you, that's just wasting time. Better for both of you to be working on a gen instead.
---
What I‚Äôm getting is he‚Äôs talking about the people yelling at the screen because they don‚Äôt like something and it needs a nerf when it doesn‚Äôt like a guy was complaining about franklins demise out of anything lol.
---
As long as both earn bloodpoints I would be for it
---
r/dogelore
---
We complain because we care. If we didnt care we would just quit the game and move on. We call out issues we see because we want them to be fixed so the game can grow and be successful. Think about if everyone didnt complain about v1.0 of this game with all the infinites and double pallets and instead just quit, this game wouldve been dead years ago. Id say the only reason its still alive at all is because of how dedicated its player base is. To say someone isnt a fan of the game and should just quit because they have criticisms is a bad mentality.
---
This is awesome haha
---
You already did it, but in case they do this one again, you actually didnt have to heal yourself. As long as you had self care equipped and healed anybody, it counted
---
It's mostly a solo queue thing. In swf you wouldnt need it, but a lot of people who play solo use it a lot.
---
Ngl legion w/ basic mask looks like he is performing a vibe check
---
How would it kill the game, the number of SWF is miniscule, the toggle would just ensure you'd never run into them. It's like spinning a wheel and every 10th try you'd land on a disaster space.
---
It would most likely squeeze out a big part of the dbd community. 
---
Who wouldn‚Äôt toggle on not versing swfs. Everyone would because no one likes versing swfs mate. Then the game might actually fucking die for real  because the wait time would be excruciatingly longer because a big portion of the fan base can‚Äôt get games.
---
LOL right, that shit is so weird
---
what is a ‚Äúbig w comment‚Äù
---
Can relate. Even deliverance is a great perk to have as solo because swf half the time wait for nobody
---
They sweat their dicks off against a bunch of baby survivors and vice versa.
---
Plague doctor
---
I personally would love this feature
---
That'll have to be worked on, the current system is just not sustainable, the game has been bleeding killers and it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot rather than fear monger a crowd because of a possibility. If we look at other casual games ((I'll use Overwatch as an example again)) most high level players often stick to ranked because casual provides no challenge to them.
---
If you're going to heal, there's no real time loss between Self Care and having someone else heal you (not counting healing perks or medkits). It's either one person off a gen for 32 seconds versus two people off a gen for 16. It evens itself out. The only thing bad about Self Care is people tend to over rely on it and refuse to do anything else until they heal themselves. As long as you're being smart about when and when not to Self Care, I don't see the problem in using it.
---
Makes no sense that survivors can just leave with traps on their heads. Kills with them are cool but nothing else. They give you even less points than a Mori.
---
I don't see how they're any more overpowered than blood Warden or anything else that prevents survivors from leaving.
---
The developers seem to love making weak Killers week or so everyone has to play the strongest killers. And then of course they have to deal with those killer is being annoying and getting nerfed into the ground.. making killer unplayable and survivors having to wait longer for matches.
---
Watch out, he's got a singular function while I as a person with the capacity to discuss have a variety. What shall we do?
---
Equivalent exchange
---
I wanna suck it
---
How do you know when the "chase" begins
---
Just a silly way of saying I agree with him
---
It looks like an edgy artsy emo early 2000s video.
---
I was today years old
---
[cheers bro ](https://imgur.com/a/zYTVS8o)
---
Yah it feel like some green indie sh*t you record in your basement
---
Ash should have been a killer to begin with. -.-
---
Also if you're going to reply to me, do it here because I had to block the other guy; he was being problematic.
---
Cant use those in kyf
---
my brain hurts rn i didn‚Äôt know swf was so controversial
---
That's narsty
---
The first time I splooged.... 
---
(Probably too fucked up of a joke if so, sorry mates lol)
---
When the baby Meg brings her fellow baby Meg
---
Yes, I know you took the hit. When I said be the real hero, I meant not SC'ed, let yourself get hit for the down and let him escape with the time that would have been left from not SCing.
---
Yeah sometimes the games like no ruin for you lol.
---
I feel like ruin spawns in a bad spot 70% of the time. One time I remember playing survivor and ruin was right in front of me when I spawned.
---
yeah, if you really need heals cuz you‚Äôre on death hook are something then yeah but just try to find your teammates on gens
---
So then the killer just respects it and now you‚Äôre going down??? What a terrible idea lol
---
I just wanna earn blood points guys stop being so mean :(
---
One guy is in here throwing insults in it's defense lmao
---
I think hes role-playing the clown
---
Honestly it what killing floor 2 did and honestly we could have some balanced maps? üòÇ
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
‚ÄúLook how they massacred my boy‚Äù
---
I say give a week and then play dbd. Honestly I've just been blowing through the killer ones without even using add one and just having a bloodpoints fest with the Bros.
---
Pretty sure that one says ‚Äúcomplete the equivalent of three full generators‚Äù.
---
We might due to doctor sleep, I mean that‚Äôs not exactly The Shining it‚Äôs a sequel but ya never know. Or we can get the killer who ever it  is, for. Doctor sleep.
---
I find feng's and david's cosmetics the best of all survivors.
---
Dude I‚Äôm actually in first year, you‚Äôre scaring me!
---
I've heard and will continue to hear worse, all good
---
This idea is amazing honestly
---
I feel like the Doc needs an addon where after he gets a survivor to tier 3 madness the next time he uses his shock it can break a pallet or something. His power is intresting and fun to use, but unfortunately that doesnt help him with getting looped to hell
---
Its pretty much jumping on the band wagon of the complaining about a killer. But I can understand why you would say it has nothing to do with the comment above it.
---
to be honest, i like playing swf in a non-toxic way with one person or whatever. i don‚Äôt personally think that being able to toggle would be a good idea since it rules out the option of choice. for example, some people would dodge a 4-man lobby but wouldn‚Äôt mind a 2-man. i‚Äôd say just let the killer make a new decision every time. you can almost always tell swf if they load in together anyways!
---
Holy balls
---
I feel it's too "Lively".. What do you guys think? Should I make it darker and more evil looking, or should I keep it a bit cheerful?
---
So when a survivor is outside the terror radius when she activates it. That survivor wont be able to hear haunting UNTIL the spirit is within the survivors terror radius?
---
i love david. i don‚Äôt like the way feng‚Äôs shoulders look in her tops tho :(
---
Killer main, I can notice the groups who are doing objectives. Its raised a bit. You still have the SWF xssholes ruining the game with gen rush/t-bag nonsense but less so with objectives.
---
I used scratch mirror Mikey. I got a few grabs but overall lost the game lol
---
I wouldn't mind playing against a duo squad, just let me know what I'm facing to prepare and not hate the match I'm loading in
---
Exactly and if there was an option everyone in the world would have it on.
---
chase music starts
---
I mean, she is getting a nerf. It's not as big as people wanted it to be, but she is.
---
They‚Äôre balancing it? Honestly beads is better now because everyone knows when she‚Äôs phasing, and not just who‚Äôs near by
---
Fixing a broken addon doesnt fix the issues with spirit
---
No collision anymore
---
I was able to four gen a survivor team once because the gen placement was disgusting. I could've even five-genned them, but I didn't care enough about the fifth gen to do so.
---
Proof they need to be nerfed.
---
If your not in her terror radius you cant see her husk anyways
---
Maybe OP was almost healed up.
---
That‚Äôs not quite how perception of time works. Otherwise 50 and 60 year olds wouldn‚Äôt bitch and moan about waiting in a lobby because it‚Äôd seem 3x faster to them than the 18-20 year olds with them.
---
I would say watch people play as well. 
---
Like Fungoose on twitch or notOtzdarva on YouTube. 
---
Also Ardetha has some videos of criticizing footage his fans have sent him. 
---
If you are ever bored just watch any of these people and try to get a grasp of what they‚Äôre doing.
---
yeah, lobby times for swf would be depressing. 
---
they‚Äôre already getting a little dicey but it‚Äôs a small price to pay i guess.
---
Ever used Shadowborn? It's pretty great actually
---
Photos taken moments before disaster
---
‚ÄúBut muh toxic 4 man commodious toolbox, teabagging, flashlighting, altruistic SwF excuse üò¢‚Äù
---
Who benefits from our labor? Not you or I! Its the teabagging Nea and the Dwight hiding in the locker the entire game!!
---
But that would create a huge problem for dbd and how that really be fair. 
---
The Swf people get screwed over just because they want to play with there friends. Even non Swf people would get upset, the person that reaps the rewards is the killer. 
---
It‚Äôs more then a small price it would be huge and possibly have a big community against the devs for doing that.
---
Take out Moris first, completely
---
No problem friend; just return the favor by not 4 man queueing while tbagging because that makes us very sad
---
40 minutes is a problem by itself
---
I've known for quite a while.
---
Mathieu C√¥t√©*
---
I agree with that.
---
Oof
---
But that is very brief.
---
That's happened to me before lol. It looks like they finished their day working on the set of dbd and they're packing up and theyve turned on the high beam so they can see the set better.
---
Dumbest shit I‚Äôve heard today. You overall gain pressure because all you have to do is tunnel that survivor off hook and now it‚Äôs a 3v1 and that survivor has offered no value to the team or very little to the completion of gens.
---
This is why I play the hag. If I'm getting looped too bad and someone sets off my trap you already know I'm mashing that teleport button
---
No, it could potentially give survivors a one time use easy out while also making that area more dangerous in the future, in ways a broken pallet could never do. With some smart map design, you could add some more varied gameplay by closing off paths.
---
Your inner locker boy is showing mate.
---
My number one recommendation for you (and any new player, for that matter) is to play both sides. Understanding each side's POV not only improves your skill, but it makes it easier to understand what is and is not fun to fight.  
---
What is "fun" is, of course, subjective.   
---
Usually "unfun" means something is so hilariously unbalanced that the other side can't reasonably be expected to do anything against it. This doesn't necessarily mean "too strong". Old Legion was absolutely retarded design that removed all skill from the chase and was the most hated killer for that reason. People would DC against Legion on sight, despite the fact that Legion was realistically the 3rd weakest killer *at best*.   
---
There reason why Spirit in particular is hated is because her *base* power doesn't afford much meaningful counterplay. You can't even be sure if she's using her power in the first place, let alone how she might be using it.  
---
Prayer Beads exacerbates this by extending that outside the chase. If a Prayer Beads Spirit grabs you off a gen, basically a free down, you were supposed to do what, exactly? Bring Spine Chill? You can't see her, you can't hear her, and you have no time to react. She certainly didn't outplay you. Fortunately, this add-on is getting reworked alongside her other super strong add-ons.
---
üò¨ü§¢
---
Everyone is Dwight, even the killer; thats the entity at work
---
that also doesnt fix the issue, most spirits use the sound of survivor and not the feeling of them there, but it is a nice change.
---
The issue is that in a 1v1 situation, The Spirit always comes out on top, she has full control of the situation and the survivor has very little choice
---
This is why I love this community, just one teaser gives way to a lot of good memes
---
Uh take off monstrous shrine it doesn‚Äôt really do much. I would put on just a better perk for killing like STBFL.
---
And I, oop..
---
No, this just adds more requirements for matchmaking to search with which will:
---
Alienate most of SWF because most Killers don't want to go against SWF.
---
Alienate Moris/Add ons (apparently) because Survivors don't want to go against a Mori/ Killer with good add ons.
---
Make Matchmaking take MUCH LONGER because of these filters. (No it won't improve it at all because it has to look for 4 randoms near a certain rank instead of a swf to fill some of it and a Killer who isn't using certain addons/offerings)
---
Here's a better suggestion
---
Killer is allowed to see who's in a SWF in the lobby, if they want to dodge then they can dodge.
---
If they didn't then then they get the following:
---
2 Player SWF = 50% Bonus Bloodpoints Post-trial
---
3 Player SWF = 75% Bonus Bloodpoints Post-trial
---
4 Player SWF = 100% Bonus Bloodpoints Post-trial
---
There, Killer now gets a bonus for dealing with SWF and it doesn't impact matchmaking times.
---
(And Moris will probably be adjusted soon anyways because if Insta-heals got nerfed then so will everything else stupidly strong)
---
Good point. I added Monstrous for flavour and to avoid kobes, but Save the otz for last would really work much better on shutting down saves.
---
Locker build for survivor is Head On, DS, Inner Strength, and Quick and Quiet
---
Save the otz for last? Do I smell another otz fan lol.
---
LMAOOO
---
Me, crawling along the floor, slugged by a tunnelling Huntress who caught me because I stopped running to finish off a medkit: HA! You're too late! The guy so desperate he changed his name has already done two and a half gens himself!
---
Id love a casual mode. Cuz its really not possible to try out fun builds at high ranks cuz games end in 3 min with no ruin.
---
I used to be a Bubba main. The bane of my existence is how badly I got slowed down when revving my chainsaw; sure Billy also slows down, but that‚Äôs right before he gains a huge speed boost in a single direction. Bubba is far different in that it takes him a while to slowly build up speed and even then, if you‚Äôre not right on the survivor‚Äôs ass then you cannot even catch up to them half the time without add ons (even if they just ran in a straight line).
---
Also the chainsaw is so easy to dodge. Like, painfully easy. If the survivor starts turning tight corners near walls or loops, you have an even harder time hitting them due to your larger hitbox making you take slightly longer to turn the corner. And the fact that you have to make sure you don‚Äôt accidentally bump into the wall so you do not turn the corner as tight as you normally would.
---
Please BHVR just make it so that Bubba isn‚Äôt slowed down when revving his chainsaw and he could actually be a really good killer.
---
This. It threw me off for ages. For some reason the explosion sound goes off a second before the action actually completes.
---
play a different game this one isnt for you. Try the 40k Dawn of War games, their fun RTS's, a little dated graphically but the gameplay holds up and it can run on a potato of a computer. Helps that its dirt cheap as well.
---
What's the valid point that killers have? Looping bad? Looping toxic? Tunnel good?
---
Bruh moment
---
You‚Äôre right
---
I constantly see survivors say it, even when the killer lets them have hatch
---
It's pretty weird. I got it just cleansing twice against Plague.
---
Trapper for me
---
Yeah, next he‚Äôll be saying chainsaws are real, or even more ridiculous, Doctors!

Focused + Object of Obsession would hurt me deeply; and patch up is too similar with We'll Make It. The first one sounds great though; would be super fun with Flip Flop!
---
Dark senses tome has me depressed, who tf is gonna repair THREE GENS in ONE MATCH?
---
Or being the only decent source of battlepass progression.
---
honestly, with how many people already dodge lobbies &amp; how obvious it is to see 3 people just ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù loading in together, i don‚Äôt think it would be the worst idea to just give the killers a little clarity about who they‚Äôre playing against. if a swf has to go thru a few more lobbies, so be it, so do claudettes and pink-haired neas. it‚Äôs a very small price to pay considering how much a 4 man swf can kick the killer‚Äôs ass. i barely see people dodge lobbies anyways especially how long the lobby times can be.
---
Same here, just want BhVR to really improve and fix their game, they have a excellent game that keeps people coming back and putting up with the bs problems. 
---
It‚Äôs year 3 and they are well established and should have a good revenue stream coming in and they are the only leading horror game on the market right now with exclusive rights to some of the all time killers in the horror field. 
---
The infinite loading screen has been a problem for some time now and I‚Äôm now getting the infinite load out screen after a game, or my game crashes. Heck I can‚Äôt even go past the first readings without my PS4 crashing and giving me the blue screen with error message.
---
I can agree with this accept the know when a Swf is joining. I love the bloodpoint incentive this is a fucking good thing. 
---
The whole Swf joining notification isn‚Äôt my fancy because people already have a tell by everyone joining at once. But I guess it really wouldn‚Äôt matter if the killer got a good incentive to face a Swf. This is a change I can see that can happen and create more good then bad. 
---
I like your idea mate.
---
One time, I played vs a team that had three Brand New Parts. This was back when they instantly completed a generator. I sure was outplayed by a team that could pop three generators before I could get into Whispers range of the fourth guy. They were clearly the better players.
---
You won‚Äôt get the trophy using a Mori. Just saying.
---
Anything is possible on this subreddit!
---
Why can't we just do all the missions at once, man? Is that so wrong?
---
It's almost like the condition of doing everything in a single match was a terrible idea.
---
Thanks I‚Äôm scared of tall women now.
---
They could add their own little marker to them, like maybe some reflective tape/auric shine from the Entity creating it. I don't know. I just think it would add a little more fun and variety to maps.
---
1-7
---
Murder is fine, next to the exit gate is just being a dick
---
They were probably signaling for you to check your killers handbook. There really are just too many rules and variations of them to keep up with. I think you were doing fine though. Survivors tend to forget their actions have more control over the Killers movements than the other way around.
---
THE COIN DECIDES
---
Not sure about the speed curve thing, but I'm actually surprised they're not just slaughtering Spirit completely. I really thought they'd do something like making her Wraith-visible during phasing or making her stun like Nurse coming out of it, which would obviously just make playing her feel terrible.
---
Collision never did anything for me, anyway, and Beads are for chumps.
---
Hush, we only suggest mindless, strong ass buffs just because around these parts
---
Or Doctor. People don't realize he can grab in Treatment.
---
There is no wrong way to play.
---
So you're saying Legion actually can use Distressing well?
---
What are you talking about the game rewarding someone? They opened the hatch, thats not playing bad, thats using the tools given. Its not a one man game, sometimes you have shit eammates, sometimes gens dont get done. You you arent good enough to kill one person during endgame after closing the hatch, thats youre fault. 
---
This whole post is just you being but hurt because you didnt get your 4k. Get over it and play another round.
---
Ever use a Mori? It's the same thing, it's a party item. It's not exactly fair but it is balanced and it's a fun addition to what is a fairly casual game.
---
I actually do think the challenges are fun &lt;3
---
They literally glow bright red when you mark them, mate
---
Remember that thing BHVR hates? Time to do it explicitly because of what they imposed on us!
---
I don't bother and do pretty good. All I care about is dem jumps.
---
That line is beat to hell, time to move on fam.
---
And that was okay, because... wait for it... downing a good survivor was literally impossible.
---
Such a rarity it begets posting.
---
Just here to give you an updoot, my friend. Fun can yet be had in games even when shit goes wacky :)
---
Quentin Qontains massive amounts of power, he just keeps it all down just so he doesn't scare the entitties
---
No, don't feel bad. This is their fault and the fate they chose.
---
I'm sorry, but I'd like to respectfully disagree. While you do seem to have your fair share of game knowledge, perhaps surpassing mine, I'd like to note that you don't seem to take into consideration the mechanics of Wraith. I do admit that your suggested build would work amazingly with a killer like Leatherface, I would like you to note that I have tailored this build towards the Wraith and the extreme advantage that his stealth and speed can give with a basement build.
---
1. Iron Grasp. It is very fair to suggest a perk like Iron Grasp in a build like this, perhaps replacing Monstrous Shrine, I chose not to use it due to the redundancy that combining Agitation and Territorial Imperative with the perk brings. Is it not fair to assume that if I go after the survivor who triggered Territorial Imperative, then in a best-case scenario I'll only need to use Agitation to land a basement hook?
---
2. Insidious. Again, I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt in the possibility that you tailored *your* personal build towards Leatherface. This build is *not*, and I repeat, *not* a camping build. There is an obvious fair share of territorialism (pun intended) involved with this build, but I would like to note that the strategy I went for is a hit-and-run one. The goal was to find a survivor entering the basement with territorial, down and hook them, then move onto the first person to fail a lullaby ~~vibe~~ skill check, then return the moment territorial triggers.
---
3. Mad Grit. While the possibility for a body-block scenario is a very scary one, I trust that I will likely not need the use of Mad Grit. It's an absolute favourite of mine, especially combined with agitation, but I do believe that the perk is unnecessary. I *will* swap out Monstrous for this perk for now, but I believe that I would do much better with Make Your Choice (once the bloodweb gives it to me) instead of Mad Grit. While the distance requirement is harsh for a basement build, I believe that the double windstorm addons and Territorial Imperative do more than enough to make up for this fallback.
---
Didn't even fuse them so you could be Spirit with Evil Within. Weak.
---
OMG it's you again!! The C H O N K  lover.
---
Guess im genrushing then
---
That would be freaking terrifying seeing that in the distant that terrifying
---
I'm pretty sure it can happen on all platforms
---
If BBQ didn't show auras I'd use it on pretty much everyone. It's still good on Freddy though.
---
Next chapter is a non licensed killer, and it's spirit's dad. The stephen king hype was unfounded.
---
It's time for The Story.
---
See, once upon a time I played a MOBA called SMITE, and in that game they had a Season Pass not unlike DbD's new installment, where you grind out exclusive items.
---
One day, I realized that they were selling it at the same price, but with FAR less time to actually get the points (unlike DbD, this first pass didn't accumulate points until you bought it, and relied on betting on eSports matches that were now past), so I went on the forums and suggested they might want to ramp up the point gain, to make it a more enticing investment and give everyone a chance to catch up. Please note that I was totally caught up at the time.
---
On that day, I saw the ebony hatred that lies within the hearts of men.
---
People were F U R I O U S. Made every accusation and insult they could at me, screeched about people not deserving handouts (it was a massive time investment they had to pay to get into), everything. Having things that others do not is SO IMPORTANT to people, it makes millions. Nevermind that you can only use one cosmetic at a time, nevermind if it's downright ugly, people will value things solely based on the exclusion of others.
---
You got downvoted by a killer main because god forbid you think killers and bad
---
Well, Makes sense since GHOSTFACE is my second main and as a Survivor I always play Dwight...
---
After that, his shocks start dealing damage. 
---
Maybe not as a hit damage, but rather as 0.5 of a hit damage, I guess.
---
Isnt it Wraith?
---
Jokes on you, you got hooked next to the hatch
---
Still being a dick
---
basement boi build = basement build.
---
If it's a basement build, you are meant to camp with it or it's not a basement build. If you're trapping the basement as trapper, it's called Trapper's Home. If you're not camping the basement but just hooking, it's called Stay Out of My Swamp. If you're trapping the basement as Hag, it's called the Jumpscare Shack.
---
You are using a variation of Stay Out of My Swamp, which is not a basement build.
---
But how does it trigger camaraderie. Another survivor needs to come near for it to activate right
---
I really hate that totem spot, only because I can never really tell if its lit or not.
---
We must not why but we must ask where to buy a clown one
---
I had a rank 9 survivor tell me i shouldn't use myers stalk because it makes him "op"
---
He just posted his POV in this subreddit
---
Nice!
---
Well, they still got the achievements to prove it.
---
Invisible all the time. Can phase at 200% speed AND can see survivors while phasing!!! Automatic Exposed effected every 30 seconds. Map wide terror radius. Worst possible passive power: survivors cannot dc.
---
I play on ps4 [NAE] and my survivor queues are like a minute or less and my killer queues take forrrreeveeeer.
---
Ohh I love him loon at those lanky leg awesome
---
Monstrous isn't worth it at all, here's the numbers for it at level 3.
---
&gt;9% faster Entity progression: 120 seconds - 10.8 seconds = 109.2 seconds
---
&gt;15% increased difficulty on escape attempts: 4% - 0.6% = 3.4%
---
&gt;9% increased penalty to escape fails: 20 seconds  + 1.8 seconds = 21.8 seconds
---
run it if you want to but don't expect anything big
---
Step backwards if they try to run it. Gives you a larger opportunity to hit and most survivors don't expect it.
---
Ayy. I'm not complaining!
---
Yes, but all three times the Killer was cool about it.
---
One DC, I just get sweatlorded into oblivion, though.
---
Angy
---
I liked how they used to glow. Very bright and sparkly orange. Now it just looks like yellow paint with glitter.
---
Healing your self, healing others, and decisive strike are all UNIQUE actions in the game with skill checks.
---
I'm not fluffing anything
---
My criteria from the start:
---
1.Is an action in the game
---
2.Has skill checks
---
All 3 of those fit and you look kinda sorta just maybe like a huge tool.
---
I listen for start of the lunge or start of the simple attack sound, I find it easier against nurse idk why, and then try to go in a tight or loose circle around the killer, depending on distance and are. It‚Äôs a panicky reaction, muscle memory from the days I was actually good at this game, but they were hitting me anyways so I try and I get to dodge them. 
---
It never fucking works against Freddy and the rare pig, but I think that‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm bad
---
Im like that too. "Aight im gonna give coop gen a try with ruin. One bzzt and im out"
---
The Ultimate Troll Power.
---
You cannot quit.
---
Everything seems good, but I'm not sure what that speed ramping change will look like and that worries me a little.
---
I'm sorry, but I don't stick to these "Basement laws." You're arguing with my name choice, not my build. You're not providing anything to the table. I used the flair "Looking for advice" in regards to the build, not to what I called it. Now, I'm asking respectfully, do you have any advice?
---
First off that awesome work give me Tim Burton vibes and come over the clown is not a creep ssh shh he not
---
Seriously? I got my first salt message first hour i played.
---
See: TF2
---
Fair enough. I've got a few responses further down in regards to the possibility for Make Your Choice. I'd love some tips there too.
---
#FreeTheNip
---
Territorial is disgusting on demogorgon. 
---
[Proof here. ](https://youtu.be/1-qix4OYfzU)
---
Yeah... I love David, but Dead Hard is kind of a hard perk to use. Once the killer realizes you have it, they kinda just wait for you to use it. After that, you can try to do it just before they actually swing, but it's hard to time, not to mention you have to keep the camera behind you so you have no clue where the hell you're going.
---
Nah, it may reward skill, but it's still really annoying.
---
I'd honestly rather Ruin be reworked as a perk and all Good checks be nerfed to regress 1% without the progress freeze implicitly. That pause is both frustrating and happy hour for randoms to make things worse.
---
She moans for like a solid 5 seconds after getting hit. Why is it so long
---
Ay me too! I played like a friend killer at first. But now i do what i have to do without remorse. Game felt a lot better without holding imaginary rules
---
Just an addon rework and a nerf.
---
They should just reward legacy by resetting prestige 3 back down to nothing. That way it‚Äôs about the same grind as before and it‚Äôs achievable.
---
You've got it a bit backwards here, but alright.
---
Well shit.
---
Tip: Slug the last survivor until the other one dies, so that the last one dies instantly and you don't have to worry about waiting.
---
There isnt really a secret technique to it. You just try to. Usually the survivors will experience BS hits on their screen so their sense of timing will be messed up, which benefits you.
---
Tru3 playing GF actually disgusts me. Stripping away the fun stuff from GF, making him an alternate Wraith. The most optimal way to play GF is knowing when and how to stalk. Its just too hard he doesnt even bother. It just works cause hes good at the game enough to not need it
---
They literally do say safe unhooks
---
Well let me explain that better...
---
If it's tier 3, for each survivor alive there's a 3% luck, so if 3 survivors are alive there a total of 9% of luck, you have a base luck of 4% so you get a total of 13%, it does stack so if someone brings it as well you gonna free yourself pretty much all the times by yourself, anyway, if 13% doesn't look like it's a good thing for you, remember you can try to free yourself from a hook 3 times, making it really nice and underrated as a perk
---
This is why I run pop or overcharge
---
How so?
---
I'd even say keep everything you've unlocked/upgraded at the lowest tier you don't already have implicitly. So teachables are near-guaranteed to be T2, every Perk you acquired is T1 after first prestige, then T3 teachables, T2 of those first perks, T1 of any new perks, etc.
---
4 prestiges to have T3 everything at level 1 is more than fair, especially when you need level 15 to use 4.
---
This is pretty cute
---
Agreed. I hate griefing as much as the next guy, but anyone who can't tell the difference between griefing and enjoying a long-awaited feature demands no respect from me. If I couldn't enjoy a game where I'm not winning, I would be an extremely unhappy man!
---
Yeah I love wraith but every time I go against a really solid swf team I can‚Äôt do anything other than maybe get 1-2 kills if I‚Äôm lucky. The spirit nerf is just the devs getting one step closer to having a dead game (No more killers to play against)
---
This is just my opinion but I‚Äôve seen with my own eyes how a 4 man SWF can completely destroy a killer if they aren‚Äôt using nurse/spirit/ghost face yet the devs keep nerfing killers because that‚Äôs the only thing they see in their notifications is survivors sucking BHVR‚Äôs dick when a killer gets nerfed meanwhile the killer players watch from the sidelines as they slowly lose interest in the game
---
also did he just kill freedy
---
I do NOT like Ghostface, but I'd sooner buff Michael to let him swap back to Tier 1 at will than nerf Ghost beyond his free notice of who revealed him.
---
Spine Chill seems fine, though. Handy, but not OP or a free second chance like DS or Adrenaline.
---
I'd still only run it with Slippery Meat, tbh, and then I'm using a perk slot on Slippery Meat and maybe it's better to just not count on RNG like that.
---
Its when your alone on the server or after some time the dedicated server terminatea your lobby
---
"I don't need to make thought-out suggestions for reworks or do any critical thinking about game balance, just remove the thing I don't like entirely and *then* you can consider reworking an unrelated balancing issue."
---
Do Moris need to be looked at?  Yes.  The Cypress mori doesn't need to change, it doesn't have any sizable impact on the game and lets some variety in.  I also am a big fan of the Devour Hope method; Survivors get a warning it's in play, it can be disabled, and the killer can't actually use it until every survivor has had a fair shot at objectives.  Personally, I think one of the Mori's should change to you can use it on all 4 survivors, but they have to be on death hook. (It's still powerful, because there's no flashlight save/body blocking/wiggle/DS opportunity, but let's be honest: if you're on death hook and already slugged, there aren't very many scenarios where being Mori'd would have any different result than picking you up and taking you to the nearest hook.  Most Mori's last longer than the walk to the hook would take anyway.)
---
That's pretty normal, actually.
---
Yea nah I agree
---
Well, there goes No Nut November
---
 Not everyone can concern themselves with this, but this man did. He's a hero
---
you forgot the not between im sorry

OK I was wrong about that point, thanks for letting me know - those that farmed didn't get what they wanted, so I'm glad about that.

He ate his broccoli as a child. c:

Well i only referenced the original design from DBD, he's one creepy ass killer.  also i bet hes really nice, but like a back alley smoker kind of nice.
---
The perks I use for the kind of build you want to run are Iron Grasp, Agitation, Territorial, and Ruin or Thanato. There are other alternatives to the "Stay Out of My Swamp" build that you can use, but you have to find the one that suits you. Not every build is good for every player.
---
1. Iron Grasp
---
Increases the amount of time a survivor has to wiggle. When paired with Agitation, you are more likely to get to the basement with the survivor you are carrying. 
---
2. Agitation
---
This increases your movement speed while carrying a survivor. This is good with Iron Grasp because you move faster while survivor has to wiggle more. 
---
3. Territorial
---
When you're the distance away from the basement that you need to be for it it to trigger, you can see a survivor in the basement. This is a good perk in the "Stay Out of My Swamp" build because you can see the aura of a survivor in the basement for 3 seconds. It helps you find a survivor in the basement. This perk is needed and can not be replaced.
---
4. Ruin or Thanato
---
It can slow the game down a bit so you can get more hooks  throughout the game. With this build, you should try to keep one survivor in the basement at all times. I use Thanato because someone will most likely be injured no matter what happens.
---
I'm with you on the passive or 2-3 at once approach.
---
If you squeeze it murky swamp water comes out
---
If you're an actual newbie, you don't need Spirit to win in your killer matches. I'm  someone who started in the last two weeks and play on both sides, and I'm just gonna say I evade  Bing Bongs and Hags just as unsuccessfully as Spirit. It's just that Spirit taught me nothing about reading the killer in the noob stages, I've had mercy from Spirits because they've seen how lost I was against them.  
---
On the killer side, as a nab, I've had success playing Freddy and Demogorgon. I don't have meta perks unlocked and I started playing this game so close to rank reset that shit gets brutal sometimes. That's about it. You just have to play the game and learn and not crutch yourself with Spirit.  I don't have Spirit, I enjoy my time with the killers I like to play.  What the heck you need Spirit for as a newb? As someone who prefers to play killer, there's more important things to learn than being undetectable. Baby survivors and killers are mostly pretty blind, myself included sometimes. Learning away from that is more important, and you don't need Spirit to do it.
---
But I get points too when they close the hatch lmao. Think it's like 200ish or something, but it's better than nothing XD
---
Now I would like to see each killer matching their animal counterpart (it'll probably look like a furry convention üòÇ).
---
Oh yeah for sure. It all depends on what the rights holder would want to give out. I can see Bhvr prioritizing to try getting the rights to the 1980 Shining movie and Jack Nicholson's likeness first. But if that doesn't happen then yeah, maybe they'll go for something else. Also R.I.P Wes Craven :(
---
&gt;Gets "escaped" notification

---
&gt;*FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK*
---
this 'challenge.'
---
Listen, Idk what platform you're on but If killer is having a rough match I'll run up to the hook and crouch and shake my head yes until I get hooked. Most times I do this the killer downs me and brings me to the door D:
---
The fact that she stayed the whole game in spectate **just** so she could say that to you says everything anybody needs to know about these idiots. Lmao
---
1) I absolutely love this. So cool!

2) You‚Äôre missing a huge opportunity if you don‚Äôt do Plague + the Venomous Puke Dinosaur from Jurassic Park next. :P
---
I LOVE IT!!!
---
I would love to see a velociraptor(my gamertag) and a demogorgon, put together!
---
Hmm ok
---
Wait, please say that is false, I would commit neck rope immediately
---
If you meant to do it, you wouldn't have walked away..
---
/s
---
At least it's not another Hazbin Hotel screenshot
---
Hitboxes and latency are the some of the biggest issues in the game imo. I was playing as huntress, survivor was in killer shack hiding behind a generator from my hatchet. I was at the window and I still managed to hit her while aiming a bee's dick above the generator. Couldn't see any part of her at all.
---
*OMAE WA MU, SHINDEIRU*
---
Expected the second caption to say something about how you‚Äôre already injured... 
---
Ah well, fitting either way
---
I'm just going to say what I think about the perks because I never know if a power would be balanced on paper.
---
* Survivor Perks
---
**Fortify:** This perk should have a few tokens that you can't regenerate, a cooldown, or a longer time to fortify the pallet. This perk would give a survivor who can't loop more time in a chase. Chase time is precious for a killer because the perks a survivor uses can change outcome of a match depending on the perks that they bring. 
---
**Gerat Escape:** Knowing how you can escape a chase even when a killer is still following your scratch marks, I would say no to this one. They would have to make the escaped chase more accurate for this to be a perk.
---
**Test the Scales:** Unless this doesn't show that there is a hex perk when you are hit when you should've been exposed, this should not be a perk. I'm not saying this because of NOED in case you're wondering, I'm saying this because it could make Haunted Grounds a trash perk. If you do 3 gens with Ruin still up and the killer also has HG, then the HG gets destroyed instead of Ruin and the killer went for the player with Test the Scales, that would be really annoying.
---
* Killer Perks
---
**Trapped Treasure:** I'd say it's balanced because it works similar to how Iron Maiden does, but the time the aura is revealed should be lowered to 3 or 4 seconds and it shouldn't change depending on the tier of the perk.
---
**Cursed Tomb:** It's basically a worse version of Iron Maiden.
---
 "You open lockers 30%/40%/50% faster.
---
Survivors who exit Lockers suffer from the Exposed Status Effect for 15 seconds and their location is revealed for 3 seconds."
---
We don't need useless versions of a perk that already exists.
---
**Mummification:** The perk should have tokens that you can't regenerate, a cooldown, or a longer time to wrap the generator. Either that or the generator should not be able to regress when it is wrapped.
---
Today..
---
You all forgot the hidden stat: *-Makes Survivors quit after being downed once, just so they can avoid your BBQ Stack*
---
Playing an interesting match for once and then ruining it with farming bullshit*
---
Fixed that for you
---
Me and the boys just had a talk about this, we're literally just going to all pile up in the basement and let the killer find us.
---
New Killer revealed: **Dachael Kingers**
---
As long as you can get at least 1 level a day you should be good
---
700h on pc and nothing like that ever happened to me. Everything I get, winning or losing, is pure toxic salt. I'm considering quitting this game for good, honestly.
---
Omg i hear it and i know its not her and i freak out bad
---
Because it's about making the game easier for survivors, not for killers.
---
Scared the shit outta me
---
Thank you, kindly!
---
honestly i feel like i'm losing my mind. i mean we've all bitched ad nauseum about the poor design of putting 'healing others' and 'healing yourself' on the same tome, but it makes for a stressful game where instead of completing objectives you're chasing eachother trying to figure out who wants what. i've taken claudette up from rank 5 to 10 just buying med-kits to do the botany challenge. i've definitely met the requirements for a bunch of other challenges, but i'll have to wait to do each one in turn.
---
if tome 3 and 4 continue on this trajectory, it feels like we'll be spending hours on stuff that's either pure luck or completely at odds with the objectives of the game
---
This is why the challenges are great
---
Hell yeah :)
---
Ehhh I‚Äôm an Xbox player and never send messages for this reason. When I play killer I always give a thumbs up to the good respectful players.
---
Time for some QUICK MATHS:
---
Let's say you play killer (not legion or doctor) you are getting like 25 - 28 k average which is pretty fair if you 4k every game, thats a whole 8 games just for 1 challenge, don't bother trying survivor it would maybe ~12ish games. For 1 CHALLENGE I remind you. Tome 3 will make me cry I swear.
---
Why. What made you want to turn this psychopath into a dinosaur?
---
That's great for you ladies and guys who are into that sort of thing but...
---
Feng when BHVR?
---
Bruh..
---
I like the use of the word "theme" instead of anthem implying that the Soviets were actually like a fictional T.V show or something
---
Not only that, but it so often means people are just wasting pallets and throwing matches for a dumb challenge.
---
Personally I did it with friends while they had other challenges to work on, and I ran OoO because in other attempts killers would flat out refuse to chase me.
---
It sucks to encourage something dumb like this.
---
I'm having such bad games recently. Both on survivor and killer. Soooo bad :(
---
Lol I remember watching this match.
---
This was the match where, in order to avoid accusations of tunneling/camping/toxic etc., he:
---
* had no perks;
---
* had no add-ons;
---
* could not hook the same survivor twice in a row.
---
Map was Coldwind Farm, Rancid Abattoir if I'm not mistaken.
---
It was hilarious. Twitch chat constantly kept accusing him of camping/tunneling for everything from spotting the same survivor twice to starting a chase.
---
At the endgame chat, this survivor asked why there was no phase notification sound, and that was the start of the longest conversation I've ever seen in endgame chat. This triggered accusations of "Camping the endgame chat" from Twitch.
---
10/10 would watch again.
---
And it's a bannable offence. I think very few people would risk losing all their progress and purchases just for legacy.
---
Why is she mad? This should be reversed, it's her ancestor being added in, not her dad. Her ancestor is gonna be pissed off when he hears about her family's stupidity.
---
The colon thing is paragraphs vs chapters. The rest is fucking heresy.
---
That way only works if you're a good M1 killer or against specific teams. Otherwise you're just Wraith with a faster uncloak. Stalking can be seriously clutch too, you just need to know when to use it because in the right scenario you can end a chase before it even begins and be right back into the game. It's not a catch all build, it's good against some teams and bad against others.
---
If you honestly believe a recharge rate on her base kit when prior to it there never was one is not a bad rework or a nerf, then we have different subjective views! ;)
---
It's not her father, it's her ancestor. You know the name of the map, "Yamaoka estate", Yamaoka is the name of the guy who bought the estate, he was a war hero who slayed on the battlefield with his Katana. He made a legacy for his family, he's gonna be pissed when he comes into the picture.
---
The spirit nerf is only a minor inconvenience. A good player is still gonna fuckin dunk on  survivors. :)
---
+100
---
Yes
---
I always knew the entity was in fact cocaine
---
On pc it's all in game. Look for a support page on the console otherwise go to their website.
---
Nah, he'd probably take out his frustration on Spirit because he can't get to her dad atm (due to the entity trapping them in its realm).
---

Try to force them into an easy hit, You can hound them but instead of swinging wait until you can actually confirm a hit rather than leaving it to lunge range. Takes a bit longer but they usually end up lagging away from most normal hits

Yeah dude. By far the most infuriating aspect of this game is not playing killer, rather its playing solo survivor. Billy is clearly chasing the obsession far away? Lets just crouch walk to my generator. Two people and down and one is being chased? Let me just self-care at the edge of the map.

Yes, I‚Äôve said this. If you do this, you won‚Äôt have to camp last hook.
---
He manchild's up all the time when anyone disagree's with him as well. Watch his basement Demo video.
---
Shout out to random team mates who do three gens on one side of Suffocation Pit / Azarov's Resting Place!
---
But... I was a survivor. I swear I didn't tunnel or camp the killer. :o
---
And no, I'm solo, I don't teabag, I can't even loop properly and can only use flashlights to flash them at my teammates butt.
---
At the end of the match, two were dead (including potato me). So there wasn't even a "haha, I got out"
---
Dunno, maybe because of no 4k? Or they felt offended by my potatoness.
---
I‚Äôd like Steve to kiss my baby, I need a babysitter blessing
---
Depends on the situation really, like if your flashlight saving or at a pallet to try and escape a chase sure thats not toxic, but some people take it to an extreme.
---
Thank you!
---
And lol that was the Dilophosaurus. But I‚Äôm doing accurate dinosaurs so we‚Äôll have to see
---
How the fuck can you even fake them without actually resorting to cheating or messing with the system?
---
Survivor mains don't want to hear it dude I play both so I understand how both sides feel about certain things but the whole concept that just cuz u vault a window u should be able to be hit thru a hole in the wall is stupid
---
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnope. getting those struggle points. \*dabs\*
---
:) I might make another, darker version
---
unless they have borrowed by the time the person goes down again it is a safe unhook
---
His power is you starving to death.
---
That great you have awesome work going on
---
Iirc the entity isn't actually female. From my understanding it was just a translation error that it was referred to as her.
---
Clicky clicky is toxic. Just using it. Not toxic. Saves aren‚Äôt toxic. Pallets. Meh. Why? But not toxic ig. Old flashlights were toxic cuz it physically hurt your eyes. Lol. Like the screen was AWFUL.
---
lol yeah, most the vid is me missing survivors right in front of me
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJNt1DR3fCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJNt1DR3fCE)  this is the original video if you care to see it
---
If you spam and teabag to clearly be asshole then it is toxic. If it is just for saves then it is ok
---
Hmmm, good to know. Seeing as how this was 3 months ago, I done forgot about this and had no intention of replying til I actually reread the comment. But before this "gift card" scam I was supposedly running, and even long before this post actually, I hadn't been on in months. So whatever this "gift card" bs was about, it sure as shit wasn't me. If I was gonna run any kind of scam, I'd target religious people, not gamers. People of religion are easier to fool.

Meowth confirmed for next chapter
---
Or make the illusions more about causing uncertainty as opposed to just making everything annoying.
---
So what? Its still a bad play to do that?!
---
Nice
---
https://youtu.be/JY2HREvAd3M
---
I mean. No one has to farm. Stop making up rules. He doesn‚Äôt wanna waste his time on a pointless game. Stop getting mad cuz killers don‚Äôt play by survivor rules.
---
When you put it that way, he‚Äôs the kind of uncle to buy you something nice for your birthday but ditch your party half through to take a drive to Maryland.
---
Hahah aww jeez thank you. I suppose my sketching skills are good for something :) I appreciate the love!
---
I really hope the new killer is viable with an enjoyable power. I'm desperate for a high tier killer I enjoy playing.
---
You‚Äôre right, he dances all night at the killer shack, on hooker Tuesday‚Äôs.
---
Flashlight: not toxic
---
Click spam: mildly toxic
---
T-bag and click spam: mori time.
---
Conclusion: I agree, and will do the same thing that others do to me. You chill? I'm chill. You go toxic, you get BMed once or twice (slap on the hook with a headshake before leaving) You go TTV wannabe on me, you get the mori.
---
Seeing this makes me want to learn Huntress so I can do this as well, but it feels so difficult learning her :(

I used to watch Monto, but in my opinion he tries too hard to be funny. And he's an ass hole sometimes.
---
Depends on the lag. Sometimes you have to do it for distance or early if the lag is against you.
---
No he your run of the mill stoner uncle who think he still in the 70‚Äôs and has a stoner van
---
Depends on my mood and the survivors. I personally don‚Äôt like being blinded. So I‚Äôll shake my head when they try. If they still try. They die. And if I‚Äôm giving someone hatch and they struggle. They die. I try to give them fair warning. Like shaking in circles and stuff and swinging when they start struggling. Going up to hooks and shaking and walking away. But if they get off my shoulder. Better find that hatch before I get to em.
---
Meh other killers have different opinions. Dry them tears and move on to the next I guess.
---
The solution to this is to increase the amount of times these actions need to be completed but also make it so all challenges progress at the same time. While doing a Trapper challenge, I got all 4 Survivors in the basement hooked at the same time. But it doesn't count for that next one in part 4, so I have to somehow pull off that miraculous feat once again that I've only done once before in my 500+ hours because it's impossible to find any teams without Borrowed Time or Decisive Strike.
---
I can't get enough DBD content on YouTube and the only daily DBD YouTubers are Tru3 and Monto :/

Oo yeah you‚Äôre right

Lmao
---
I want a Santa wraith now he see‚Äôs you when your sleep he see‚Äôs  when your doing a gen so you better be be good or the wraith is going to give the bong  and the thwack
---
To people who downvoted this, he's allowed to insult a streamer you don't like. Stop defending him like you actually know him. People in the public eye open themselves up to criticism.
---
Wait. Have you tried to play killer at a decent rank? Q times are actually stupid at most times of the day. Like I just lay down and look at memes while I wait to hear me get into a lobby literally 15 minutes later.
---
I don‚Äôt know how to cross post
---
It works both ways. It‚Äôs just what really happened is different from what shown on your screen.
---
I'm so confused can someone explain? Is there a new killer leak or what!?
---
It's less because there are four of you with different perks to help. Killer is one with just 4 perks.
---
Am I‚Äôm right I can smell the clown being like old 70 smoke and weed and coffee and he like really in 70 music and he‚Äôs has that weird porn star mustache and he give you a playboy for your birthday and then at your party he passes out on the couch
---
lmao all the survivor mains in the comments trying to salvage anything they can possibly get from a situation where they're dying on hook and the killer is watching xd
---
.... I used to run away from the last survivor to avoid this... this changes everything
---
I don't think I would even be bummed if you did that to me. I'd be confused.
---
What if you kobe? üëÄ
---
I am agreeing with you. I was defending you.
---
You vault the window, run 2 meters, got hitted from the other side of the window. Works both ways :). Dedicated server'd.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt pip most likely anyway. Just quicker that way tbh.
---
I think you played like 6 months ago.
---
Doc needs a full rework. Madness is annoying but doesn't win games at high rank, but in low ranks it stops all forms of stealth which is literally only way low rank plays. (Unless rank reset)
---
Get rid of the calm/order. No passive madness gain beyond tier 2. Broken status at tier 3 by hitting tier 2 with shock therapy. Even then it's a similar tier to plague. (Although you get better search via illusion and shaking skill check...which does fuck all tbh)
---
love this game
---
Friendly bubba is better. Get ruin. Guard it with franklins. Lol. ‚ÄúFriendly‚Äù helps them practice hitting ruin checks. And if they try to blind. Your flashlight now.
---
I just like to leave them like I have something better to do than watch them die. I usually don't
---
Just going off the the gameplay my choices for some characters are...
---
Trapper: "Nero forte by Slipknot"
---
David king - "Invisible by Skillet" 
---
Nea - "Smells like teen spirit - Nirvana" 
---
Freddy Kruger - "Monster by Skillet" 
---
Quentin Smith - "Monster (Under my bed) by Call me Karizma"
---
Demigorgon - "Kill everybody by Skrillex"
---
The Legion (joe) - "Lite the fuse by The death set"
---
The Legion (Susie) - "Think shank by The death set" 
---
The Legion (Julie) - "Monster by meg and dia" (A lot of monster's lmao)
---
The Legion (Frank) - "A wolf in sheep's clothing by Set it off"
---
The pig - "Bury a friend by Billie Ellish"
---
The shape - "Threats of romance By Marilyn Manson"
---
Ghostface - "Another way out by Hollywood undead"
---
Bill - "uprising by muse"
---
Meg - "Holiday by greenday"
---
Jeff - "The state of massachusetts by the dropkick murphys"
---
The plague - "kannibalan by Apashe"
---
The spirit - "house of memories by Panic at the disco"
---
If you're on ps4 you'd report them to Sony since it's using sony's messaging system, not the games like on pc.
---
Dc fucks killer too.
---
Keep practicing! You can do it!!!
---
I understand your point. But you don‚Äôt need to learn coding to criticize a game. You are a customer.
---
salty spirit players who can't play her without abusing wakizashi and prayer beads are downvoting you x)
---
I thought these were legit candyman animations lmao
---
literally nothing besides ghostface
---
The green pin is actually very good, especially with STBFL
---
Cuteee! Bing bong the wraith Boy, has a jolly happy bell, with one whack of his happy stick he bing bong bings away.
---
I would be glad, if it was easier for killers to pip.  
---
I mean, queue times for killers at red ranks would be at least hours long. But for me it would be quite nice to meet killers of my own skill and who are not necessarily aiming for a 4k in middle ranks. At the same time there would be high rank killer who are deranking, "because of the queue times" and spoil the fun. 
---
But, meh, can't have it all.
---
It‚Äôs not good because legion is punished for hitting twice. It‚Äôs reliant on that perk which should never be the case for an add-on
---
And someone dcs
---
Your perks are so unique.
---
I have never seen them before.
---
Make unranked mode normal BP, then make Ranked mode, can only queue solo and will not match people with friends in the same party. Double BP...then make Ultimate Rank, SWF queue and Triple BP
---
Pretty sure it's easier against slower killers (like nurse)
---
It's likely based on Akkadian, but I have no idea whether the words are based on anything real or are just approximate nonsense
---
Nope Bhvr need a Santa cosmetic for wraith a Santa hat like Jack Skelton Santa suit and In Christmas wraith bell play a Christmas song Bhvr needs to get this down
---
Wtf that‚Äôs rad dude
---
lol ttv wannabe im a surv main and even I find that funny
---
Tell that to the people who got the ‚ÄúUnachievable‚Äù achievement in the Stanley Parable.
---
That‚Äôs why as killer I only farm if the survivors want to and I feel like it. If I don‚Äôt feel like it I‚Äôm just ending it quickly. But if survivors are begging to farm. I‚Äôll farm if I‚Äôm feeling nice. Just to the point where they don‚Äôt depip. Then they die.
---
I know and I appreciate it. :)  
---
It's just what I learned from this comment section: Don't be nice or they will think you are being sarcastic. I don't think that there is much more to discuss here. :D
---
play her as an m1 killer, no puking, corrupt purge doesnt count as chaser and if they cleanse or become broken it will effect chaser and malicious. 9 hooks in total with each survivor being hooked once should get you the devout. derank to 13 if possible then you can get 2 iridescent 2 gold and still double pip
---
Roflmao
---
also slug if you need to
---
Nah I think some challenges are bugged in general, I competed the self care challenge after self caring in a game for legit like 2 seconds (And then I got morid). I also played a game as hillbilly while I had the "fully deplete 6 medkits" challenge selected, and at the end of the game I apparently completed it lol
---
Zombies is at least also a videogame that deals with gore/creatures and dark gritty aesthetics.
---
Hazbin is just a cartoon that Tumblr-Adults are overhyping. I sound biased but it‚Äôs been in SEVERAL subreddits with zero context.
---
Thank You for the tips. I will try this!
---
Not even for the baby dweet?
---
I keep forgetting what gg WP means
---
Yeah, 3/4ths of players are looking for ruin.
---
I just want to do a gosh darn gen
---
Already killed more than the entity.
---
Because the money you give them goes to Death garden not into DbD
---
Its better to report directly to sony. You will suspend the reported account for 7-365 days...depending on how bad it was...but also report to the game directly, just for bonus suspension points üòÇ
---
2 pip without dying is not equal to 4k.
---
Rush 4k is equal to gen rush in 3-5min and escape.
---
Doing both ways gives you a little amount of BP and depending on rank black pip.
---
You would think that, you'd be wrong though. that's probably what 95% of the original ban wave was from lol. Cheated progress and fake legacy.
---
Good game, well played.
---
good luck. it's hard but doable, theres a reason it's the rarest adept besides demogorgon
---
I agree, They're definitely grinds in place of actual challenges, "Drop 14 pallets while in a chase", "Destroy 8 Totems" etc etc. it's especially annoying when there are challenges locked behind one another meaning you often have to do things you could of done in the same game through multiple games. An option to complete multiple challenges (+1 per maximum tier) would of been pretty useful. As for the "Challenges" they could of just went with insanely easy ones for the first 2 tiers but they could of easily had some actual challenges for some players such as escaping a chase without using a pallet, Complete a game without being hooked, Achieve a chase time of X seconds in a single match, Have each survivor step onto one of your traps etc etc (They are mostly Claudette and trapper based) The only real plus side would be that most of them can be done while playing normally but the fact that you need to play multiple games for some sucks.
---
Had 5 games in a row when ruin spawned within 15 meters of my spawn/gen. All cleansed before a single person even got hit.
---
Then 6th one was a haunted grounds. Luckily person in chase was already injured so it was ok (....)
---
It's all good for survivors but ruin placement sucks balls for killers lol
---
For what? Lol
---
I do the exact same thing...
---
I agree with you in principle, but cuz of the dailies I've found a lot more teammates willing to BT save you or heal you. I've been escaped more regularly than ever lmao
---
That's what I am asking right? I mean, he is basically asking to cheat the game.
---
Ds is literally stronger than ever. The only counter play is to slug. Even if you aren‚Äôt trying to tunnel they can just body block making you waste time hitting them. And you can‚Äôt pick them up cuz 5 second stun that can‚Äôt be shortened anymore. Old ds had more counter play and had a shorter stun. Especially with enduring. Don‚Äôt try to say ds was a nerf. That‚Äôs just bs. I play both survivor and killer and I run ds damn near every game. And spirit didn‚Äôt need a hard nerf. I don‚Äôt disagree with anything else you said. But I also don‚Äôt really agree with it. And you can‚Äôt really say certain survivors aren‚Äôt good or bad cuz they‚Äôre skins. So they don‚Äôt change much for survivor based on that. I think the game is still survivor sided as that‚Äôs the main community. And it‚Äôs only being driven home by spirit being nerfed. (Ig we‚Äôll see how hard they gut her, if she‚Äôs unplayable anymore or not at least top 3-4. You can‚Äôt really say the game isn‚Äôt survivor sided.) gen rush is what survivors do. I hate how other killers say ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù wtf are survivors suppose to do?? But the swf in coms is op af. Especially if they run OOO which I think should just be straight removed. Went on a couple tangents. Gl in game.
---
Flashlights aren‚Äôt toxic it‚Äôs the people I
---
Using them
---
Umbra was a complete jerk towards my friend once in a game idk if she was having a bad day  but it ruined any chance of me or my friends liking her.
---
Some people just need to grow up...why be toxic about a loss or a win...then again, I havent won a single game as killer or survivor in 2 days, and havent had problems with toxic players...
---
This is so cool
---
Please explain the joke or else üî´

I tried for Adept Doctor once and had it denied by a couple hundred emblem score thanks to the Jane in that game disconnecting in the middle of the match. I haven't tried again since then. I do agree that it is complete horseshit that killers need to play a perfect game with usually horrible base perks, whereas as survivor you can legit hide all game with a key if you really want your adept.
---
It‚Äôs rank reset right now so that‚Äôs another reason but imo you just have to get that first hook as fast as possible and slug 1 closer to the end of the game if needed.
---

Thanks. Almost quit cuz someone said it looked like a toddler drew it
---
Ight I‚Äôm a killer main. But play both sides. Wtf is gen rushing my guy? What do you expect survivors to do besides their literal only objective? Gen rushing is a term made up by salty low rank killers and used as an excuse. Stop making us look bad. It‚Äôs like survivors complaining ab tunneling when the injured survivor literally runs into my face. That‚Äôs not tunneling. That‚Äôs me just playing the game.
---
FYI doc is already reworked. His power didn't block survivors actions on release
---
Making someone crawl to the gate when there is less than 20 seconds on the endgame timer, and watching them die by the entity's hand, is being a dick...
---
Dumbass
---
Comic wolverine is suppose to be a manlet btw
---
Wow your artwork is  pretty terrifying in a good way don‚Äôt take people sh*t for your drawing who care what people think
---
Gen rushing isn‚Äôt a thing. Gens do go too quickly imo. But complaining to survivors won‚Äôt do shit. That‚Äôs their literal only objective. Complain to devs. But they won‚Äôt fix it. I‚Äôve lost hope for BVHR
---
Its only me or hes "wholesome" content is too cringy to watch?
---
Spirit really isn‚Äôt OP enough, even pre-nerf, that a new player can pick her up and instantly climb to red ranks without a variety of perks; not even close. Despite this, she‚Äôs easier to learn than nurse and the skill curve is significantly more gradual. If anything I‚Äôd recommend you learn a simpler killer in order to get the basics of running loops and learning survivors‚Äô behavior before maining anger ghost.
---
Spirit‚Äôs power is designed for chase; she has no inherent slowdown or tracking perks, so strong builds for her tend to focus on slowing down the game as well as finding survivors. If you‚Äôd like, I can give a few examples of strong builds which don‚Äôt require you to buy a character.
---
I'm running into the issue where it's impossible to get decent gatekeeper score on a killer whose base kit has no way to slow down generator progress. I can get a 4K but because gens got done too quickly it's only a bronze gatekeeper.
---
Best feeling, until you fail the skill check
---
I play both survivor and killer a lot, I see so many reasons why survivors die. It wouldn't be because of tunneling/camping, etc. It's usually the main points such as
---
1. They cannot loop or properly lead chases well (some times you can't help it and you get a bad moment it happens).
---
2. They don't utilize their perks properly to counter-play.
---
3. They still do not understand the fundamentals of stealth and not being seen in the first place.
---
Thx
---
Mr.Yamaoka  nerfing spirit to the ground  - 19?? colourized
---
Seeing this post reminded me of a match i played against a michael...i thought he tunneled and camped, but the one guy was just really annoying...when the "Tunneled" guy dced after second hook, I think the michael felt bad for downing all 3 of us in rapid succesion and decided to give us a free win...I am ever greatful to that Michael who risked a Mori and Super Rare Add-on just for us 3 to escape safely (And also thank the team who didnt tbag the michael)
---
So yeah it's pretty bad for game play. For survivors
---
I like how archive brings out a bit of challenge. I just wish it would bring out more creative builds.
---
I mean 'trap a survivor 4 times' is rank 20 shit. What about hit survivors 4 times while carrying a survivor using mad grit?
---
Sacrifice 2 survivors using hag with no teleport (use mud collision or something)?
---
Oh, No. he can‚Äôt be banned. He hasn‚Äôt broken any actual rules.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry! I didn‚Äôt let go and last two survivors were at the door and attempted to unhook me, we all died!
---
Ahh, appreciate it.
---
dedicated servers at its finest
---
Happens to me as Doctor
---
It‚Äôs probably just a kid who doesn‚Äôt know better. Doesn‚Äôt really warrant a permaban, if anything would be better to tell him why he shouldn‚Äôt beg for points rather than trying to shame him, name uncensored, on the subreddit.
---
Oh actually yea I might take it down... Apologies
---
Please don't self promote.
---
The virgin cross-map hatchet vs. the  C H A D hatchet singularity
---
I would rather heal myself  while others arw on a damn gen then waste time looking for someone taking them off a gen for the killer to find us 2 secs later and im injured again. Also most times i run into the stupid killer trying to find someone to heal me.
---
It's actually sad because I try to maintain a sportsmanship-like conduct when playing all games, but I've never got the hatch as the last survivor over the past few weeks.
---
tbf I'm not expecting or am feeling entitled to the hatch as the last survivor, but it's like the lunch lady giving you a free apple when you don't have money to buy a meal at school.
---
I really wish kindred worked on stealthed killers like it says it does
---
The most fun I've had in a game was being Huntress with Iridescent Head and Devour Hope. I brought Devour hope on accident and it ended up being a ridiculously broken combo. I got 3 hooks in the time they did 4 gens. They never finished the last one once devour hope came into effect...
---
Yeah they said they fixed that. They did not.
---
Honestly im all for changing it as a surv main i think its BS i can just hide and win adept.
---
May this match forever remind you to always try harder XD
---
I wouldnt bother with those honestly they are just rng since they changed them
---
Meanwhile when I play killer, people hit perfect skill checks and gen rush even with ruin.
---
Thank god on PC we can tell people beforehand.
---
I'm 50 50 but I think I might have been that nurse
---
This is why I love freddy, the mindgame potential with faking teleports is unlimited.
---
The "Bottom" needs a "Solid" foundation afterall.
---
With add ons and 3-gen strat perk he becomes the most annoying POS to play against.... :( those are the matches that make me wanna kill myself asap
---
Probably region. I'm in south america and the playerbase here reeks toxicity. I'm either a tunneler/camper piece of shit noob(even when I get 4k with devour hope) or I'm a baby killer noob ez. Fucking tired of this. Not even counting the harrassment ingame, when the survivor drops the pallet and teabags after it every fucking time. With all those crutch perks to have so many second chances. But if you use noed you're bad. If you camp you're bad. If you BREATHE you're bad. Man... Fuck this game.
---
Also, check how my comments have been downvoted. Seems it's not only south america players being little shits.
---
You dont have to complete it in one game or anything. Dont rush
---
1. This was a joke, he didn't actually send that message
---
2. You're going to have to be more specific about the basement demo video because I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Legion could've maybe worked in place of nurse.
---
Ah okay thank you
---
Damn ok thanks
---
Idk, sometimes they spare me for my sheer thiccness, just to see my fat ass crawl away
---
NOED and Thrilling Tremors over the Enduring/Spirit Fury combo on any M1 Killer widepeepoWeird
---
Everyone always forgets Legion
---
This is good for a basement build but monstrous shrine is pointless even in basement builds with its miniature bonuses. Try a good chase perk instead like STBFL, enduring, brutal strength and many others.
---
Not at all if you're bout to play Legion
---
Dwight johansen
---
You playin?
---
Well bonus bloodpoints (from bbq and bps) don't count to the challenge
---
I dont know why I actually expected something educational in that link
---
Legion SHOULD be punished for hitting twice. Or are you one of the people who thought pre-nerf legion was good for DBD
---
&gt;a few examples of strong bids
---
Please do
---
Its where you guide survivors where you want them to go.. which is your traps. There are lucky traps that you forget you go "wow nice! someone stepped on it!" and then there are times when trapper is deliberately blocking of paths and take non optimal pathing so that your only choice is to go where traps are
---
Then he shouldn‚Äôt have an add-on that encourages him to.
---
Poor Doc, I remember I used to hate him so much when I was new. Now, he just seems like he has his own problems trying to keep up with the loops :(.
---
Why not
---
Yeah. Chases are wraith's weak point, hence why I added Territorial to guarantee a pretty easy down in basement. You reckon the build would do better replacing Monstrous with something like STBFL (Helps catching them before they leave basement), and replacing Lullaby with Make Your Choice (Same idea as STBFL + Ez Snowball)?
---
How recently have they changed them? I have done them with most of the free killers.
---
Of course! Just lay down and I‚Äôll be there.
---
It also made it better for me as a survivor. Tunnel or camp me as you must killer! I will not make it easy for you!
---

"Unhook a survivor who unhooked you earlier in the match - safely". Alright Killer down me, I won't stop following you till you hook me, because I'm so good you're not gonna find me till the end of the match otherwise.
---
do you want to talk about what happened
---
By 1min max if being generous
---
What for?
---
I want to jump into a bush
---
It's trapper, we all know this. Meanwhile Hillbilly is the Meg of killers, and Nurse is the Claudette.
---
Dont let downvotes get you down...its not like anyone here can understand what its like to live in a country where servers arent a thing in some games, but in others they are blooming...basic matchmaking as survivor takes 10 minutes then the ping is 400-600...dont see me complaining about it...so if anyone wants to complain about your message, they should speak up or shut up and move on with their lives
---
She wears traditional Russian clothing, if anything the color and pattern is more important than having an identical garb. You may be able to ask some of the other huntress cosplayers on this sub, search ‚Äúhuntress cosplay‚Äù and shoot them a message.
---
Less than worthless, my friend.
---
I actually had a similar idea via limiting the visibility of the survivors based on proximity by having "The mist" from the movie "The mist" but that's about as far as i got with it since it is made up of random monsters than a singular being.  The mist concept came first which is why I decided to think about applicable killers for it.  lol This one sounds like a better version of it l, though a problem i had with the mists concept is that the survivors would essentially know where the killer is from across the map and essentially run away from it. (Thought about giving the mist warping powers for this ) but your killer has the same problem, Once in the sand storm survivors would essentially be able to know where he's coming from making it easier to avoid him. Not to mention if they're always up, even as a 115% killer. 
---
The walls of fire are definitely too strong for it to immediately put players into the injured state with that range and duration. This killer could run it through most jungle gyms/pallets and kill the loop entirely or use it to go through both shack doors or snipe players on a gen, protect a hooked survivor and it lasts 30 seconds which is far too long for an ability like this. 
---
Maybe you could base it around range (with an initial range nerf) whereas the longer the flame, The less time it lasts. You could also chain it to an animation whereas using it would slow the killers movement until released or it expires. Lastly you could change it from a cast to a trial allowing him to leave behind a trial of fire (at the cost of movement speed of course) also for a TR based killer you left out his TR lol 
---
As for the perks 
---
First one is too strong, At least lower it to like 1 or 2 chests, But all of them? Lol My goodness man 
---
The Second one also lacks any real limitations as well, Maybe it could reveal them after being in a locker for 9 seconds (Or one second afterthe  max level of Inner strength procs)  
---
No limitations again for the third one and 30 seconds is a VERY long time lol I would limit it to generators that are not currently being worked on while lowering it to 9 seconds but making it stackable. (With a visual queue to show if a player has been unwrapping it)
---
Survivor perks- Very strong and essentially guarantees an escape if the killer goes for the destruction, Tbh it would probably lead to people dropping all the pallets on the map to fortify them lol To help balance it? I would actually combine it with an idea i had which would have the player scavenge through a broken pallet for pieces granting a token, And you can fortify them with said tokens while increasing the time it takes to destroy it by like 2 second per token used (based on your durations) In hindsight they may end up quitting if it happens twice. 
---
Perk 2- movement speeds alterations are always a bag of worms but vaulting speed increases with no limitation would probably lead to legitimate infinite loops. Maybe increase the speed per token while having a fast vault expend those tokens. (An exhaustion limit effect could be good as well since it will probably lead to a 5 seconds los block which grants the survivor a free token 
---
(Los = Line of sight) 
---
Perk 3- I like it, But it actually is strong for perks like noed which it completely counters. But against someone like The Shape and Scream (or a make your choice perk) It would definitely be useful. I don't think we have any perks that specifically counter another completely so maybe it could use a bit of a restriction among how much progress the survivor must contribute to earn a token. - Also would it out right counter infinite T3 The shape? Lol while that's broken, this would be as well. You actually could just block an exposure effect for 30 seconds per token 
---
Overall- Definitely a good idea, The only real problem I'm seeing is the lack of limitations of a lot of it. 
---
But this is the guy that actually thinks spine chill could use a nerf as a survivor main (It would just light up for 3 seconds at a time when proc'd so it isn't so obvious when a killer is heading towards you as since we can currently use it to deduce a lot of killer perks. (Not to say some killer perks couldn't get a tap on the shoulder)
---
I want to talk about Kbps and upgrading to mbps
---
Excuse me but Unbreakable is lit af. Sad im the only one that runs it on my solo adventures.
---
what if dude did use this program in past?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a dick move lol
---
*haah intensifies
---
cause it was a bad rework! :D
---
By taking the time to open part of (if not the entirety of) the exit gates. It's certainly hard to escape, but exit gates retain progress so you can afford to bail from them a time or two before getting a deadly spider hug.
---
I love it when a survivor unhooks a teammate in front of me while I‚Äôm still Tier 3 Myers without BT, it‚Äôs like‚Äî what was even your plan??? Don‚Äôt screw things for everyone else smh
---
People like her because they can go in a random corner and not get found for a long time
---
I just search for ruin for my teammates, so they can finish a generator within the time span of 10 minutes
---
Only when its being done to me. Doing it to someone else? *chef‚Äôs kiss*
---
*Scarred by P3 neas in baby Dwight clothing, he spares no mercy to the innocent, forsaken souls at brown ranks*
---
True.
---
 Though it doesn't explain why behavior seems to favor her so much
---
Did my "jook two people in the basement with agitation" as trapper and after completing that, I kept downing some meg, set a trap right in front of her and pick her up, rinse and repeat. She escaped the match with a ton of points
---
Don‚Äôt have any other perks on her unfortunately. Didn‚Äôt even get to use it because they were on their A game and did bones.
---
He's honestly just mad because he was gonna die and wanted someone else to die along with him. I'm sure it was a shitty little kid who just likes to be petty lol. It really is unacceptable. I'm sorry this happened to you though.
---
damn.. think I'd rather get moried from the get go. Giving you hope was just downright cold but Myers right..

It‚Äôs not a nipple, it‚Äôs a mosquito bite

If there were 100 players, that would be 75 of them, i think is good ratio. xD
---
These challenges are harder than master challenges by far.
---
I pretty much did every master challenge in a single match while these took me up to 8 matches for a single one.
---
Doing bones? Impossible!
---
if you pointed out (which i forgot really for some reason) that she is from russia, then maybe i can google and find in internet "russian clothing"   
---
if i dont find anything, i will ask you i guess, thanks for offer ;)
---
I hope he does get banned lol. There's no need for stupid toxic shit like that.
---
I'm saving mine. I think the change to prayer beads is a good one. It's just like wraith bone clapper, except when wraith uses it, you just need to be aware of your surroundings for the distortion and uncloaking animation. When spirit uses it, it will only gives you PTSD
---
reports do nothing lol
---
The new Prayer Beads aren't bad though? Now Survivors hear the Phase sound effect at all times whenever she Phases, so know they'll be paranoid when they're working on Gens. 
---
"Is she actually Phasing to me right now or am I safe? Can I work on this gen without getting grabbed off it."
---
I think the new Prayer Beads is BETTER than old Prayer Beads, it'll cause the game to slow down as Survivors become paranoid.
---
I cannot like Aces or Wraiths, ever.
---
Any killer with that can hear you will do that. Nurse? She don't even bother to go around things and when in fatigue she can still hear you and know where you are
---
Better shit on spirit tho, even if Nurse is x10 stronger
---
okay.
---
I've only played this game like twice so far so I don't know much about anything yet lol. So thank you for telling me.
---
Ohhhh okay, thank you! Tbagging is an asshole thing to do though. I didn't know shaking your head as a killer even counted.
---
that's the point! to be an asshole!)
---
same problem, haven't found any solutions. saw some threads in their website, and some other posts about it in their discord but not much in steam discussion, apparently it's mostly common between middle eastern and russian players who connect to the EU server. they keep saying they're aware of it and they'll fix it in the midchapter update, funny cuz they said that before the previous midchapter came out.
---
I play both roles so I know the frustration on both sides... when Im in a team that completely whooped the killers butt I typically think about  if I have yet pipped/black pipped or not, and when I have I typically just run up and point at the hook :)
---
Iron Will is ONLY good against Spirit and MAYBE Nurse if she's good enough. Any other killer gets no benefit from it if you play correctly
---
Fun fact: the devs actually wanted to make Spirit completely naked but decided against it
---
I mean, yeah. You're right. I've just never done it, but maybe I should start lol.
---
Yeah this killer was m1ing me on hook when I was looping him while skipping the entire match. Feels bad
---
Find ruin or my team will get slaughtered with maybe 1 gen done.
---
What a Lucky ax
---
Had this happen to me and I just waited 10mins for the survivor to DC. Want my points!
---
No, not by a long shot.
---
This is such an underrated post
---
Wakizashi isn‚Äôt even that OP and that‚Äôs not even getting reworked, it‚Äôs Yakuyoke Amulet that got completely screwed over
---
It happened to our wraith, claudette glitched on hook, EDC timer ran out, he just walked around, i specced him and told him he needs to DC, was sad.
---
I typically try to cut it really close for survivors... sometimes they make it sometimes they dont
---
Bro dont worry,  hes just talking shit because he cant 360 bubbas chainsaw. I can do it as well, once you understand how to do it  it really isn't hard. But we're not here to tell these fuckers how to do it, let them figure it out on their own like we did.
---
The unhook 15 survivors challenge is the worst. Every game I've played for the last 2 days has just been constant hook bombs to the benefit of nobody but the killer. Super annoying.
---
Maybe they just missed
---
Yeah i do the same thing, this is one of the rare moments where i tunnel, because if they wanna spoil the game for the others, i'm gonna spoil his/her game.
---
In one perticular game, there was a blendette trying to show me baby meg, who just got unhooked in the basement and was now hiding in a locker there. So i hit the claudette, to make her run away, get meg out of the locker to slug her ('cause i knew her friend another meg was in another locker down there) and start to chase down that claudette, to bad for me, that noone came to unhook her :D
---
At the end i had a fun game with the other survivors and even gave hatch to the baby meg from the locker :)
---
I would have choose spine chill bc I love the icon but it is great
---
Lmao guess nobody likes to use meme builds anymore then, sad times
---
Personally I don't think Wraith pulling people off of generators would be too powerful. He would still be less stealthy than ghost face. You can see him almost completely fine while he's cloak and he has very loud footsteps. I can see him across the map while he has cloaked no issues. So can most players who pay attention. He would be nowhere near top tier because he still has no chase potential and can very easily be looped. Of course once you know that it's him he would never get someone off of generator again as well.
---
Trapper only has 6 traps. They spawning opposite corners of the map away from anywhere players would usually be and take forever to set up. 6 traps on large Maps is nowhere near enough and having to give up on pressure to go find more traps is horrible. Even if he spawned with all of his traps he would still have to waste time traveling the map to set them up and pick up the extras.
---
Play Trapper without ruin and multiple generators will be done before you have half your traps set up. Even if you spawn with all of his traps ruin will probably be gone and maybe one generator will be done by the time you get them placed. Depending on the survivors you were going against of course.
---
Personally I think another cool feature for Trapper would be the ability to trap lockers or chests.
---
It‚Äôs bug. I got it once on pc and i couldn‚Äôt stop running or do anything.
---
His biggest trait is giving hitting double to get the broken effect and then deciding if you just leave the survivor after giving him another speed boost and stunning yourself or going after him and wondering why you even bothered to give him the debuff
---
Until you get into a game with no obsession, then you bet your ass is getting picked up.
---
Yes, I think so
---
How the hell does MS manage to ruin everything they try to do?
---
Just remember, if you pallet stun a frenzied Legion *and you're already injured* you've inadvertently given them an advantage.

---
Just peoples opinions, I guess most disagree
---
gg piece of shit
---
No I've been pulled off the hook twice and still escaped
---
For some reason NOED is a unique arguement, even though most killers get like 1 down before it gets cleansed in my games (on both sides).
---
Youtube it? He bans a dude for saying "Territorial Imperative" is a "Do Do Perk". If thats not the most childish manchild on the internet shit I ever seen. Its also not the first video he pulls this shit in either. I unsubbed after seeing him pull this mental gymnastic 3 times.
---
obviously it's possible lol. didn't say it wasn't
---
Could be an error on Microsoft, could be an error on BHVR. My money's on BHVR
---
It's not a hook state 90 percent of the time. It's a health state, which if the killer chased a survivor they hadn't just hooked the player would have gained anyway.
---
Console be like:
---
I was there for that stream he didn't ban the guy, he was joking.
---
Imo gens are fine. The average DbD match is anywhere from 9 to 15 minutes long and gens take about a minute and 30 seconds to get done.
---
There‚Äôs even that one perk plunderer I think, the one that‚Äôs increases the chances of getting better chest stuff. At tier 3 I get a purple or pink key almost every match if I manage to open most of the chests, so with swf that can be every game of what you just described
---
https://youtu.be/QTQY9vlnNP8 link to the video I found this image
---
That was me. Ha. Ha. Ha.
---
I remenber doing it in my first try, but i could never do it again
---
That looks like he wanted to kill you but also save you
---
No fucking duh, we are talking about in the future mate....
---
Doesn't affect stun time for DS
---
Lmao because that was so clear. He said next chapter, which anyone would assume means the next chapter coming out...
---
Really bad basement build. Use iron grasp and mad grit instead
---
SOMEONE STOP THIS MAD LAD
---
Make the illusions walk forward
---
&gt; When survivors break LOS, grunts of pain can be a vital determinant on not only if or where they are playing around a wall/loop 
---
Walls block sounds now
---
&gt;Iron Will enables more aggressive and riskier play while injured. 
---
I ALWAYS play aggresive and risky when injured, I don't need Iron Will for that
---
&gt;avoid BBQ 
---
Why? OH NO KILLER KNOWS WHERE I AM! They still have to catch you.
---
&gt;A reduced necessity to heal means that survivors can attend to more pressing matters than running around looking for someone to heal or self-caring/using a medkit. 
---
Unlike people addicted to self-care, I don't need to heal myself for anything.
---
In my case and with my playstyle, Iron Will MIGHT be useful, yet I'm doing fine enough without it AND I already have Spine Chill to counter Spirit alongside many other stealth killers. I don't have a free spot in my build for a tool that will only help ME against one killer that shouldn't be so bullshit to begin with
---
I don't see what's wrong here?
---
He's saying the devs shouldn't have added a battle pass system not that you should boycott it. 
---
You Nimrod
---
Can‚Äôt become paranoid if you put your headphones down.  *Tips head*
---
You won‚Äôt get them done at the same time, of course, but since there‚Äôs so much time and only two tomes are out right now you‚Äôll definitely be able to finish it (assuming you put the time in and complete challenges with efficiency).
---
But it was, only a blind person maybe like yourself wouldn‚Äôt notice another incoming chapter to dbd after a reveal trailer that a shit ton of people have been talking about....
---
I've been getting instant killer matches recently...
---
It looks high contrast...look post game...you will see whats wrong in this pic
---
Best drawing of yours yet
---
what's lol about it
---
*ITS BING BONG*! BOTH OF YOU GO TO YOUR ROOMS AND THINK OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE!
---
I've explained my reasoning behind not using those two perks in other comments. Iron Grasp is redundant with Agitation, *especially* if they're already in the basement (Territorial imperative)  
---
While I do see the merit in arguing for Mad Grit, I feel like the build would work much better with Make Your Choice.  
---
Additionally, this isn't a basement *camping* build, just a build that plays around the basement in order to achieve a fun way to finish the archive challenge shown in the screenshot.
---
From Personal experience, I gotta say, when I was at lower Ranks (15,14,13,12 etc..) it was this scenario, but when I was at green Ranks it became lesser of a thing, then as soon as I was at Purple Ranks, people just do Gens even with Ruin, and even succed in escaping fast.
---
Thank you for posting this question
---
Otz would never, this must be the work of NotOtz.
---
It takes me way too long to figure out what killer it is when i see that deep wound timer under a survivor's name at the start of a match..

3 survivor must do 4 gen to make the hatch spawn, if you want to complain you should at least know how the game works!
---
Show me on the totem where trapper touched you....go on....you are safe here....
---
Oh it's a graphical bug, I'm blind sorry.
---
Ahhh yes. You got me lmao. I‚Äôm a blind person who has reddit and plays video games. Also could you tell me what language you were writing the rest of your comment in because it literally makes zero sense. I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre saying that I didn‚Äôt know a chapter was coming out after Chapter 14 or if you‚Äôre saying I didn‚Äôt know Chapter 14 was coming out??? Either makes zero sense and isn‚Äôt a very effective insult either lol.
---
Lol wtf
---
So about the end of november?
---
Crawl towards a killer when on the floor, so many will think 'fuck that, they must have DS' I crawl away and pretend I'm trying to hide, I get picked up almost always unless they slugging.
---
I'm on Xbox and I've only failed it once, so..
---
With all their talk about "fun" as a factor, I'm really hoping Doctor loses a lot of the random "you escaped a chase for the 4th time, but RNG screamed/got an illusion so he's back up your ass again" and gets more of a power within a chase. I just find him incredibly unfun both to play as and against.
---
There is no omega nurse anymore and i did.
---
You can finish the entire tome in a few days
---
You will easily be able to complete it all
---
Damn you bruhs are salty
---
I'm so scared NEFD, it's so OP!!!
---
This does put a smile on my face.
---
I...
---
I play clown...
---
It worked on DS a while ago, now it only works on pallet stuns
---
I‚Äôm just going to ignore you due to stupidity.
---
Is Doc's adept hard to do too, asking at red ranks
---
Cant wait for the archives 4. Nothing but lightborne for me!
---
Idk if this is 100% true but I‚Äôm pretty sure Chapter DLC‚Äôs includes a survivor and a killer
---
There are 70 levels to the rift. You have about 60 days left, I don't know what level we'll be once we complete every challenge including level 4 but I'm guessing if you only do challenges you will be around rift level 40 ish, that means you need about 30 levels without the assist of challenges. That's going to take the longest, you won't be able to gain a full level in 2 hours but depending on how much you play in the weekends you might get fairly close to 70 by the end.
---
Except he does say it sometimes while playing the killer
---
Don't waste your time, they won't care about your letter at all
---
Lol
---
Nearly everything done for survivors is in an attempt to divert them from their goal, surviving, whereas literally every aspect of the killer feeds into their goal of killing.
---
That's always been my biggest problem. We don't need twenty million distractions, just increase repair time and put the majority of rewards (pips, points) into escaping so that you can reliably increase repair time without further condemning those trying to play to win/survive.
---
Killers and Survivors are supposed to be playing against each other naturally as a result of objectives that contradict one another, yet half of the time a survivor can get away with not even trying to escape as long as they farm everything except the objective.
---
If they would address generator repair times so that parties can't bulldoze through them at mach speed, they would need to fuck randoms and others over by forcing players to jump through hoops that don't help complete the main objective whatsoever.
---
Chasing is a good example of this, where you're effectively punished for avoiding coming into contact with the killer, even though you would never want to run into them if your goal is to escape.
---
Bruh why are you even mad? It‚Äôs not my fault you write like a 5th grader. Learn how to structure a sentence before you call others stupid &lt;3
---
It's when you exclusively go after one survivor no matter what, ignoring any other opportunity just to kill this one person. Especially directly after an unhook. 
---
My advice? Don't worry about it. People will call anything tunneling if they feel like they died too soon. If you're trying to win, win, and nobody has any right to get mad at you for doing that. Etiquette is up to personal taste.
---
Yeah honestly what with all this console propaganda idc if its "pc master race" or anything because either way it's stupid.
---
Why would i be hyped ? Oh i know DWEARD
---
Adrenaline will also count. Only healed myself once and was healing myself a second time when adrenaline popped. Got the challenge.

Me on mobile.
---
the skillcheck is the same size as the old ds skillcheck for some reason. not to mention the skillcheck is laggy sometimes
---
First of all I didn't "attack" the clown idea becouse I liked it, but I guess if I don't agree with you on sonething I must be an asshole that hates every idea.
---
Second making fun of me becouse I like writing is probably the most patetic insult I ever got on reddit in the last 3 years, so thank you for the laugh.
---
What killers have been nerfed as "killer of the month"? Nurses and Spirit got tweaked to be more fair other than that Killers have been getting buffs and tweaks in their favour. BHVR doesnt favor anyone, they try to make the game more fair
---
Doesnt work like that anymore
---
There is a simple answer to this question.
---
They are not going to remove keys or mories.
---
but works better on pallets thankfully
---
Thank you üòÅ
---
WAZZZZUP
---
i bet you close the hatch right infront of a downed survivor too, dick
---
I'd say hag since she has ruin and devour and is stronger than plague when played well plague also has two very good perks in corrupt and Infectious but she is weaker overall but still fun imo
---
yeah but who decided that the coin would do that? thats right, you being a dick
---
I have all of  hags perks, but don't have any of plague's. Who's more fun in your opinion?
---
What‚Äôs your playstyle? Those are two very different killers. Hag is all about tricks and trips, a lot of mind games and thinking ahead. The Plague is continuous pressure throughout the map, very loud and proud of you will.
---
BM? BloodMoints?
---
Im sorry little one
---
I think plague is more fun overall especially when you get to use sniper vomit and thye think dropping pallets will save them plus if you already have hags perks I'd say get plague just for the perks
---
Looks pussy
---
Ah none of them are my builds, just uses and synergies I‚Äôve picked up from watching better players.
---
Since survivors, generally, don‚Äôt want to stay injured vs spirit, Thanatophobia with sloppy butcher is a very effective combination. Healing takes a long time using Sloppy and even longer with Thana, so it will either slow the game down as they heal or leave them vulnerable if they choose to stay injured. Combine this with nurse‚Äôs calling and you can phase up to healing survivors for a surprise attack. Sloppy is available in all bloodwebs and both Thana+Nurse‚Äôs are on a killer who is unlocked by default. As a side note, survivors do not like this build and most people don‚Äôt have much fun playing against it. Do what you want though, you paid for the game.
---
Monitor and Abuse is strongest on killers with an inherently smaller terror radius, namely spirit and hag. On spirit you can sneak up to people with a 16 meter terror radius, get the surprise hit, and while you chase your terror radius will swell to 32 meters; since survivors don‚Äôt hear the phasing noise when within heartbeat range, you can deny information or go for plays that spirit is usually incapable of. Monitor is available on doc, so I assume you already have it teachable.
---
As mentioned by /u/Otzdarva , Devour Hope has the potential to be very good on spirit when used without ruin. Survivors see a lit totem with no ruin and may not cleanse it for fear of activating Haunted Grounds. Devour is available on Hag, who is a default unlock on console.
---
These are just a few suggestions based on killers you likely have unlocked, feel free to ask any questions.
---
Ah I forgot that DLC. Good point :)
---
Ive already reached rank 1 before so I'm not really interested in that, especially rank 1 not being alll that fun tbh. I want to be at around rank 10 to 8, is she good at these ranks?
---
There's so many things they nerfed about him it's fucking crazy lol.
---
My biggest gripe is how they made Deep Wound not go down on Feral Frenzy hit but also it doesn't go down if you're in the terror radius anyways? And then they made it so that he can't see the Deep Wound time at all? Don't get me wrong some changes definitely needed to happen but Jesus Christ you can make a huge list on what was changed in a single patch. Likes it's actually insane how hard they nerfed him lol.
---
He's toxic but he's nice, never an asshole, never disrespectful and never bullies someone. The others are entitled asf, just watch Monto and you'll notice the difference
---
Try and take them to the basement with agitation then booby trap the shit out of it.
---
Can you explain what you mean by mobile? I didn‚Äôt know there was a mobile version of the game.
---
Its less you like writing, and more you feeling the need to write a thesis paper on someones 2 cents on making a killer more interesting, WHILE coming off as a douchebag over it. Thats on you my guy. Yes, you are actually coming off as the asshole youre mentioning.
---
Shame on the survivors still chanting on a next nerf like nothing happened.
---
Then buy Plague. 2 of her 3 perks are top tier, with the 3rd being fun as well. She is also a very fun and different killer.
---
Hag is strong, but quite campy and since you already have her perks it is not worth it IMO.
---
I didn't think of that, lol
---
Its always so much worse to hit great checks for ruin when the bar skips like half the whole check every jump.
---
Yo, can i get some of these Ghostfaces fam? All i see are tryharding cunts running Spirit with Yakuyokes and Anal Beads to use them up before the nerf, and it's getting pretty tiring.
---
Isn't fungoose even more toxic than noob? iv'e heard hes an asshole but i haven't watched him in a while.
---
*Color palette
---
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve don‚Äôt really think I can associate toxicity with being nice. It still just comes off as obnoxious to me.
---
I‚Äôve seen plenty of Monto, and I don‚Äôt care for him either. Honestly, a problem I have with all the big streamers and the stupid ‚Äúfog whisperer‚Äù bs is that players put them on this pedestal, and give
---
them the impression that they are better then they actually are. 
---
For example, people always talk about how amazing Tru3 is at the game, and that to me is laughable when Fungoose exists. He‚Äôs on a whole different level compared to most of the people you see brought up the majority of the time. Not saying Tru3 is bad by any means, but he isn‚Äôt the god some people make him out to be.
---
Ah i see
---
Legion is definitely not top tier, but he\she can be pretty good if you keep enough pressure
---
Best of luck, raise that money quick.
---
I dunno about donating to Macmillan though, have heard some pretty sketchy stuff about the owner and his son...
---
if you mean nerf then you were dropped
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dx5v51/how_many_bloodpoints_do_you_need_to_get_all_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I honestly haven't seen anybody asking for a nerf since they announced spirits. Atleast not alot of people anyway
---
I assume someone else is immersing around the map looking for Ruin and most of the time I'm correct, however I'll never work on a gen with someone if they don't know proper procedure for working on ruin
---
It‚Äôs the first rift, if the items don‚Äôt appeal to you it‚Äôd probably be better to save your auric cells for the next one.
---
Serum can be used on any Halloween skin IIRC, not just the 2019 outfits.
---
39
---
I don‚Äôt for the life of me see how. He gives hatch as killer if he feels the survivors earned it, pretty much always friendly in the post game chat, always helping his audience with builds and suggestions, just a really good content creator in my opinion.
---
I personally haven‚Äôt seen him be toxic, not saying he hasn‚Äôt had his down moments, but I wouldn‚Äôt put him anywhere near Noob, Monto, or anyone like that.
---
How had I not made that connection!?
---
Trapper's fine though, we've listened to the archives, he's just misunderstood!
---
I must h@ve one.
---
It's okay if you want to believe that, but it's just not true.
---
Silly killer, hitting a survivor is against the rulebook!
---
This template is so old and starts getting annoying
---
Multi proc single target Haunted Grounds with an aura reveal seems excessive, especially when it is significantly harder to spot/guess if it's that perk
---
Yea but this sub is full of that shit as always. Will still destroy everyone with spirit though. And beads got stronger imo.
---
What‚Äôs not true about it then?
---
well. what i mean is that there is a mobile version.
---
Lmao HELL NO beads are not better. Old beads literally have the Survivors no warning if she was phasing or not, now it's a global noise that alerts the Survivors that she is phasing
---
The archives are actually better than Ruin
---
&gt;  Halloween skin IIRC
---
so far i seen 3 survivor skins with the serium.
---
Jake / dwight / cloudette.  is  there more? (non killer)
---
Same happened to me when I got pig
---
Yep but it gives everyone PTSD and that makes me happy. ;)
---
Lol, will add that one to the list of things to do on the game
---
Since the hatch rework, a good amount of killer love to torture the last survivor! They bring you near the hatch, wait you on top of it and when you are close enough they close it in front of you.
---
Well now they get a warning while in the past they didnt. Even though you may get a first hit off of someone you wont get a grab anymore as they know you might be coming to them.
---
You can tell a killer main on the street because they‚Äôll have an aneurysm the moment they see corn
---
About walls. You can hear that they are there, but wall blocks like 50% of the sound and makes it harder to judge the exact location
---
&gt; I‚Äôm sure a professional arguer can agree that anecdotal and personal experience can not be broadly applied to everyone when discussing the efficacy of a perk. 
---
The biggest mistake I made is not adding "to me" at the start of that comment. To me, Iron Will is only useful against Spirit and I shouldn't HAVE TO run a specific perk to have a chance against a specific killer
---
Keys are like Cypress Mori's
---
I love how you looked down at the end
---
There is no host. The host is the *server*. Like someone else explained, the server terminates after a while because they need to use that server for a different lobby. It makes no sense whatsoever for it to pick a random host, because if that host was a survivor, and the survivor DC'd, the game would end, which is never the case.
---
i was sad :( i brought a party streamer :(
---
What's the proper procedure, other than great skill checks?
---
Shouldn't be teaching people how to gain a competitive advantage.
---
&gt; Force the hatch open. Make it so that once the hatch appears, you can interact with it. You have a progress bar (like with totems) that you need to fully charge in order to open it. This could take something like 45 seconds or so.
---
I feel like this is terrible, if the hatch is on the other side of the map near a complete gen it just cucks the killer, it adds another thing the killer needs to find or they lose a kill(s) while patrolling the last gens
---
For survivors? Those might be the only three, Halloween events tend to have more killer than survivor skins added
---
She crouches and stands up in 1.3 seconds, and her terror radius and red stain disappear over the course of 4 seconds.
---
There should be a crap post category for crapper related posts on this subreddit.
---
I dont think tru3 is against doing gens. He's just very irritated about the fact that gens get done too quickly. And he's right about that if you ask me. If you don't bring ruin might as well write clown on your forehead.
---
It's a useful perk but you can get it from the trapper who is a free killer, it takes about 800k bp if it's a level 30 perk (I don't remember if it is off the top of my head)
---
When someone triggers the regression the gen will pause progression for a few seconds. Good practice is to not work on the gen for those few seconds as you can still trigger skill checks during that time and if you happen to miss a great and only get a good skill check, especially if there's multiple people on the same gen, you can easily lose a huge chunk of progress in no time at all
---
Where are you from?
---
Ensuring is a Hillbilly teachable.
---
*hillbilly
---
They changed the german perk names so often...  For example: Urban evasion... They translated urban correctly but for evasion they used the word invasion (in german it's Invasion). The problem is that there is a "small" different between evasion and invasion... xD
---
I meant hillbilly, sorry
---
Okay thanks all I needed you to do was repeat what you said before.
---
People don't want to face Spirit. Surprise surprise.
---
yea, and thats what sucks
---
Ill probably wait for somthing better then thx.
---
I think he wanted to tell you that there is a mobile version of the game.
---
I've noticed this so much I'll be working on a gen with someone, it'll get halfway up, the killer will come by, we'll hide, he'll find them, the chase is on, I go back to working on the gen and it seems like they run the killer RIGHT back to the gen we were working on. I'm not saying you do this but man its the most frustrating thing in the world.
---
Now you can play double the Freddy!
---
Without prestige, to go all the way from level 1 to max out all perks takes between 4-5 million, if you have all teachables unlocked.
---
He might as well have set up a tent at the hook that match /s
---
Put some black incense and Thanatophobia on her and watch the fun.
---
People don‚Äôt want to face a challenge. Surprise surprise.
---
I fixed it for you.
---
European part of Russia
---
Yea, I expected that much. When someone runs out of smart things to say, calling the other guy names is usually the go to. Just look at this comment chain. I didn't insult you once and just said that I don't think you know how to play hag, and you insulted me in every single one of your responses. But hey, I'm a douchbag, an asshole, a "keyborad master" (still find that one hilarious), so what do I know?
---
Also killers used to have a longer stun time and then they buffed all killera overall so it's less useful than it used to be, people usually combo it with spirit fury (from the spirit) which automatically breaks pallets when you break 2 pallets (at max rank)
---
H@ve it y@@h..
---
If you can't accept the game for the way it is, uninstall it. It's childish to think everything should always go the way you like. I don't like full SWF all with meta perks, but i rarely even dodge the lobby.
---
Don't really see it.
---
I‚Äôll dm you, I may have a solution.
---
Tnxxx for sharing.. Do they ship worldwide. I am asking for a friend who lives outside USA. He will lov this. Anyway tnxx for this.
---
It is meant to be a ‚Äúspooky‚Äù event, so naturally the scarers would get more attention. Survivors get some very good October holiday themed skins around the same time, they‚Äôre just not connected to the event and can‚Äôt be bought with serum.
---
The blood web hasn‚Äôt blessed me with thanatophobia. 43 levels and this is the best I got. 
---
Tomorrow I‚Äôm wiping out 6 black incense so play killer haha
---
The only hex perk for survs.
---
Yeah, just lvl up billy tbh. Keep your shards.
---
HELL YEAH
---
I HAVE LEARNED NOTHING
---
I love DS but anyone saying it got a nerf is lying, its far stronger than it ever used to be.
---
Here we go bois!
---
That‚Äôs exactly what those survivors did and you‚Äôre still mad
---
Fatal obsession and dying light would probably go well together. You get to hook everyone instead of abstaining from one person
---
True talent has made quite a few videos recently showing exactly how to counter her.
---
I hate teasers  , i wanna know when i can get my hands on  that sexy dweard
---
This!
---
I Just realized i typed add on and not offering, i feel dumb
---
Literally the only thing you can do is hope someone else uses DS on the killer and becomes the new obsession. There really is no counterplay to it.
---
Me
---
Im suprise this scam is still going around
---
OP IS 1 DAY OLD ON REDDIT
---
THIS IS A SCAM
---
Had the same problems first. Rank up and it will shorten the queues. Just enjoy the free farm at low ranks
---
Why is freddy on C??
---
it's because everyone left.
---
Cursed Legacy is a cool name for a chapter
---
How can i be mad? If i make them quit, that's like a win for me. If they don't have fun on dbd, they might find fun somewhere else...i heard Civilisation is a good one!
---
You need to learn the alphabet
---
Oops, hes A tier, i accidently put him there
---
The hatch is open at start and the killer has no legs
---
Wait what is decisive can someone please explain it to me and how to obtain it? I‚Äôm a noob
---
Yeah? You'd also be crying if he killed you so? I love survivor mains, they're like a whole other breed.
---
Alot
---
I hope they nerfed spirit thinking on her ancestor who must be way better. I hope nothing less than a top tier killer. Not another legion or clown.
---
Even with the spirit nerfs?
---
Ok, thanks!
---
People don't want to actually have to chase. They wanna stand still to win. And this is coming from a killer main rofl
---
Yes, only gen grabbing got nerfed
---
wow that's a very oblivious thing to say. Wakizashi is literally double the distance of Wraith's fast lunge when exiting stealth except no 2 seconds delay with a visual and sound indicator. do you even realize you're underestimating one of the strongest purple addons in the game lmao
---
they didnt nerf her for canon reasons lmfaoo she was just overperforming
---
GiTu GuDo
---
Yeah I think there's a possibility that there may be a mobile version of dead by daylight
---
word is PTB tuesday so dev stream thrus would be kinda late.
---
Did you give him the hatch
---
I dont find her too hard to play against, and while i dont think shes the most fun to play against I dont feel like I want to d/c if I get one.
---
Whats fun for one person is not fun for another. For me personally I‚Äôd have Legion deleted. In fact I‚Äôd take 10 prayer beads spirits in a row over 1 forever Legion.
---
Id rather have a killer kill me quick than bore me to death with an M1 sim
---
&gt;Feast of failure--when a survivor fails a skill check in your terror radius they become exposed for 10/14/16 seconds. 
---
*Laughs in Doctor*
---
&gt;Hex:entities wrath--at the start of the match the hexes presence is immediately announced to the survivors. If the hex totem remains for 4 minuites all survivors become exposed. If the totem remains for a further 5/4/3 minuites you can kill survivors by your own hand. 
---
So Devour Hope exists
---
&gt;Fatal obsession--you become obsessed with one survivor. The obsession suffers from the exposed status effect. Every 50/40/30 seconds the obsession changes to another random survivor. If the current obbsesion is downed or hooked the obsession will not change. The perk deactivates when one survivor remains. 
---
So free mini-NOED with no downsides or requirements
---
&gt;This is the end--when the final generator is completed you can kill all survivors by your hand (does not grant insta-downs) in addition, your kill animation is 5/10/15% faster. 
---
So Rancor exists
---
&gt;Hex:unknown threat--1/2/3 extra dull totems appear in the trial area (in addition to the 5 totems that spawn by default) cleansing one of these extra totems exposes the survivor performing the action for 40 seconds and reveals their aura to you for 4 seconds. 
---
So Haunted Ground exists
---
Overall: slapping exposed/mori onto every idea isn't creative
---
Would be nice, but then they would need to drop the stream as well as the trailer much sooner. TBH I was expecting this to be a trailer, not another teaser...
---
Yes, indeed as i said, i rarely dodge, usually, worst case, if i feel like it's gonna be a tough game, i bring a mori, but normally, i don't dodge. But disconnecting is a whole different thing. The game hasn't even started yet when you lobby dodge, and since the beginning, the game was designed like that. The killer should have the advantage ever since tha lobby starts, and as a survivors, it should be a surprise who you are gonna face, and if you can't accpet this, you simply don't like the game, period. You just can't defend disconnecting, in any game, it's just a loser move.
---
They should be featured skins
---
Legion buff looking great
---
I‚Äôve never hit a DS skill check on Xbox - I hit Brand New Parts for fun but it always seems to skip over the DS‚Äôs zone for me :(
---
honestly would it of pissed off alot of people to remove spirit and replace her with an entirely new character? Would basically be like what they did with freddy except the model.
---
Could of made rin a survivor
---
it just says cursed legacy in japanese i think
---
Wouldn't be shocked to see trailer monday, dev stream tues leading into PTB post stream.
---
dont be sorry for playing normally
---
&gt;Now that he has Undetectable, Jumpscare-Myers is pretty much unstoppable on certain maps.
---
Spine Chill is a thing
---
If we make the killer louder then what point do perks/add-ons/powers that reduce terror radius have?
---
I don‚Äôt get how the Nurse changes are bad? She‚Äôs still great, just not as great.
---
I didn't get him with auric cells
---
I'm not complaining about those perks...
---
When the Killer is closing in, all you hear is terror radius. Thus, you can't make an informed decision regarding your movement.
---
It's all to easy to walk *into* a Killer. Meanwhile, Killers can hear your footsteps prettt clearly.
---
Spirit has counterplay, but no reliable counterplay - in many situations it mostly comes down to luck whether you end up not being in range for her to hit you out of haunting. The core chase gameplay that revolves around pallets and windows more or less turns into a series of coinflips against Spirit, in which the survivor has to commit to one side of the tile and hope Spirit does not reappear on that same side. Walking or running away from the tile are regularly not an option against competent Spirit players. There is something to be said about reading and playing around tendencies, but exchanges are just too short-lived and any two players barely meet frequently enough to really establish a basis for as much.
---
And if Spirit hears you, bumps into you, follows scratchmarks, uses specific add-ons, or has you caught in a dead end tile, it's not even a 50/50, but more likely a guaranteed hit.
---
Spirit without collision, with an on-model indication that she is phasing (which currently does not exist), and without Stridor/with a sound effect that makes it more difficult for her to hear survivors while phasing (or alternatively not being able to see scratchmarks while phasing) would be fair and fairly fun to play against, unfortunately we are only getting one of these things with the update. I also think her ability bar should deplete completely on every instance of phasing, so that she can't just spam short-burst Phases, which are rather oppressive. In turn, I think passive phasing should be something the killer player can actually see and deliberately use to their advantage that way. Hell, with a 15-second cooldown on every instance of using her ability, she could even be a 4.6m/s movement speed killer. Without collision and with an on-model phasing indication, she could even have baseline Prayer Beads...
---
I just wanted to mention if you the premium rift you get a full refund on your auric cells by the end
---
Hoping for a girl survivor üôèüèº.
---
The Archives or The Rift?
---
Actually, survivors get 15 cosmetics and the killer 16. Thats just 1 piece of cosmetic that the Killer gets more. And if you play through the whole pass you get all your money back and all these cosmetics for free.
---
What's the difference between them? I thought they were connected
---
&gt;I'm not complaining about those perks...
---
Sounds like you are when you talk about Jumpscare Myers
---
&gt;When the Killer is closing in, all you hear is terror radius. Thus, you can't make an informed decision regarding your movement.
---
WTF does this have to do with Jumpscare Myers?
---
&gt;It's all to easy to walk into a Killer. Meanwhile, Killers can hear your footsteps prettt clearly.
---
Yeah, the point of being a Killer is the fact that he is supposed to track you 
---
&gt;Also, TR-reduction perks are never worth running.
---
Monitor and Abuse is not worth running? Okay.
---
There is a very real possibility that the multiplayer survivor horror game given the title Dead by Daylight has been redone and remade for portable cellular devices.
---
Me: I'd like to see the killer  
---
BHVR:  Áï™Âè∑
---
She Just get off of the Power with two addons to make her boost more longe and swing when was falling and bug
---
Man i'm hyped but please BHVR just reveal him already, no more teasers
---
I think everyone from r/Codzombies is taking shelter here for now lol
---
Free BPs are free.
---
Yes I mean I'm totally not completely into these things.... I didn't hug this pillow all last night for any weird reason but yeah...
---
Please BHVR answer when Feng?
---
(my friend said there was only David and a female but I forget which one but I know it wasn't Feng)
---
Can you explain what you mean by cellular devices?
---
Why that Overcharge part ?
---
1. Myers has Undetectable in EW1. That means, at base level (without any perks or add-ons), he has no terror radius in EW1.
---
2. Jumpscare Myers was an example. But, if you could hear is footsteps (which are directional), you could counter-rotate him more reliably.
---
3. Which is what perks amd scratchmarks are for. Everything needs a counterplay. Besides, easy approaches should be for stealth Killers, not a near-universal thing.
---
4. Over perks like Ruin, PGTW, BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Nurse's Calling, Thrilling Tremors, etc? No, it isn't.
---
Lore-wise, I wonder if the deaths of the Yamaoka family ended up awakening something other than the Entity's interest, so to speak. I love the implication of a few killers sharing some type of relation to each other outside of flavor text.
---
So it was a couple days ago and we were having a little argument about pulp and we decided to look it up to see if it was true. I forget about it till my friend showed me a picture of an old post here about Wikipedia. Decided it belonged here.
---
**laughs in detective's hunch**
---
Lmao I knew dead by daylight only increased your deppression levels!
---
*nurse noises.
---
Noone expects the haunted grounds nurse
---
TIL there is a mobile version. Is it any good?
---
Wow this is super helpful to know, I‚Äôve been moving up in rank recently and noticed people doing this and wondered why
---
That is true.
---
Most likely, considering Steve was the last survivor and they alternate every chapter.
---
There is always 1. I am that one personally, but it‚Äôs rare at rank 10 even that people just stick to a Gen If Rubin is active.
---
The Overcharge most likely makes them fail a skill check, which fucks up the grab since they're not working on the gen at that exact moment. I've failed way too many grabs because of it, yet I can't give up on the perk since it's such an essential part of Doctor.
---
He doesn't need to chase.
---
Considering 99% of Jumpscare-Myers players bring a L√©ry's offering, you can't see him coming from very far off. Yet, he has wall hacks.
---
He hits you, drops chase, then uses his stalking to track you down.
---
Also, his breathing is WAY quieter than it used to be. You can even tell from your own POV when playing him.
---
Level I was well balanced in terms of it's rewards to difficulty. Level II frankly isn't, and the future tomes look like an outright joke. 
---
The reward for collecting 50,000 BP? 15k. 
---
The reward for collecting 200,000 BP? 25k. Yippie.
---
No its trapper.
---
Every single trapper with unnerving presence I just feel sorry for
---
Then how‚Äôd you get him. He‚Äôs a licensed killer so you can‚Äôt buy with iridescent shards. Did you summon Freddy into account or performed some hoodoo magic.
---
It's decent. There are lag issues from time to time tho. And it does have some bugs
---
Like: sound cutting out, specific teachable perks not being unlockable, invisible garage door and I think that's all for the current version. Thankfully they are working on a fix. They respond quickly to bug reports
---
The Archives is where you progress through the Auris Web to complete challenges and unlock lore.
---
The Rift is a limited-time only form of progression (open for 70 days, as I understand) that can allow you to get special cosmetics. Rift progress is determined by Rift Fragments (the shiny blue spiral-ish currency)
---
Trailers are cool and all but SHOW ME THE SAMURAI BHVR
---
*misses skill check every time*
---
Oh cool, next were gonna have dead by daylight: fridge edition
---
The thing is, without short burst of use of her power, she would also be a M1 killer, just for less time, so you are kinda asking her to be more loopable, when in reality, you still have to reach the max charge to use again the power, hence that's the risk, if you use it bad, you have to wait seconds of 4.4 movement speed to use it again. Of course is more difficult for the survivor, but really, that's how it should be.I think is cool to have unique killers than cannot be looped, otherwise, we might as well just make killers like skins, and everyone being a basic: chase -&gt; loop -&gt; break pallet -&gt; get survivor -&gt; repeat
---
If someone has an emotional reaction strong enough to make them disconnect because of little stuff like that, yeah, I agree, they should not be playing this game online against other players. But there are situations in this game that to me definitely seem to justify enough frustrations to want to just end a round. For example, the scenario I outlined earlier, where another survivor disconnects and the killer refuses to kill you when you signal to them that you want to move on to the next round (in these instances I will usually play the round out and just play for the chases, which can still be good even if the round is lost).

---
I like the way it stands now. It feels pretty balanced for both sides, I don't understand why some players are saying it needs another nerf/removed.
---
youre totally gonna ignore the ‚Äúfull control of the situation‚Äù and im talking about a chase,
---
Okay now I wanna know the real story, if there is one.
---
Totally! It's way less predictable now, and it stops tunneling. Old ds I pretty much expected it and planned for it when I was the killer and downed the obsession for the first time.
---
Watch it be Pennywise fucking with us

[When you have to be toxic because you only got 1 blind for the rift challenge](https://imgur.com/a/3RmLLbX)
---
People getting gen grabbed with 32m terror radius killers.
---
It's just better that way. Whenever I catch myself feeling guilty about doing too well as Killer, I just remember all the times I've deliberately slowed down gens just to give the killer a chance. 
---
You know, all the not a *god damn* single time.
---
How tf is it a competitive advantage? This isn‚Äôt a FPS dude.
---
Well if that's the case they could just kill themselves on hook or just try to farm with the killer....maybe he'll listen XD
---
I mean, even the devs said that if you really have to go or you are giving up, you might as well just kill yourself then (in game ofc LEL)
---
It's just the basic to have punishment for Dcing. This is seriously the only game i know where DC is a "tactic" like to get the hatch, for example, and it's really, really stupid. I only feel that sense of frustration when i'm up against a cheater to be honest, which thankfully, is not a case for this game. Weird as it is, this game doesn't inspire people to cheat, maybe for how much stuff there is to have fun with, idk.
---
*Screeches in Leatherface*
---
This is why I always bring Small Game. When 90% of the games have Ruin or NOED, I'm gonna make sure every totem is cleansed within the first two minutes.
---
It's as simple as changing the color pallet of throwable objects to a more brightly colored set instead of their regular darker tones. 
---
All the trees in the area almost black? The throwable ones are a vibrant brown
---
Rocks all deep gray?
---
The throwable ones are almost white 
---
There are methods that can be put in place that are suggestive of the prop being able to be manipulated without tearing away from the overall aesthetic. 
---
And that doesn't even mention the fact that these objects are all gonna be in pallet spots? You know those little sections of map that are the exact same size everytime. If I see a big ass branch at pig tree where the pallet should be. I'm gonna attempt to throw it.
---
Sorry for assuming man. The rift grind is real.
---
How do you get the mobile version i cant find it on the app store
---
&gt;Madness is annoying but doesn't win games at high rank, but in low ranks it stops all forms of stealth which is literally only way low rank plays
---
have you ever been to red ranks?
---
Yes please do more, this is great and I'd love to see a hillbilly
---
Usually if I decide to work through Ruin, someone comes up to me, explodes the gen and sprints away.
---
prayer beads addon makes it so her phasing sound is heard everywhere.
---
she now has vault animation.
---
no more collision with survivors when phasing.
---
What is tunneling? (Also a noob)
---
If you have android, download qooapp from Google and download dbd through that
---
If you have an iPhone look up on yt on how to download it because I Dont know
---
Been there's did that, the game updated a few weeks later and refused to let me play after that because the files had been modified. I had to have steam verify integrity of files. You mean it's allowed again?
---
Blood Oni hypu
---
Both those are the reason Legion was no fun to go against. Legion had no counterplay. You couldn't loop him because he vaults faster than you. Doesn't matter if he's a worse player than you, any Legion could catch up to any survivor and down them with enough frenzy hits. Then if deep wounds worked like it used to, he could just deep wounds you once and then moonwalk you to death. If you stopped to mend, you died. If you kept running, you died. There was no counterplay and it was horribly unfun to go against any Legion.
---
freddy deserved a damn good rework for all the time he was shit tier.
---
It was needed ,now players have to actually be good at the best killer in the game. Before the  rework all you needed to do was use Omega blink or more blinks to greatly lower her skill floor

I usually run spine chill, and if possible blood amber keys, but I can rarely hit a great intentionally so ill just keep my eyes out for the killer.

&gt; I've been talking about that ever since they told us that battle pass will be a thing but people were just replying with "fortnite bad, so battlepass bad" which wasn't even close to what I was talking about
---
Battlepass =/= challenges
---
I know they are tied, but the real problem is the tome/challenges, not the battlepass per se.
---
Realm Royale battlepass is a good example: there are no challenges, you just level up your battlepass by playing the game.

Could you help a man out with a bit of context?

I don‚Äôt mind if you guys play doctor and I have played as him a couple of times because I‚Äôm a survivor and killer main. I‚Äôve only ever won one match against a doctor because their is no way to counter him. If you know any perks that will counter him please let me know. Last night was my first time winning a match against doctor and he tunneled me off of hook every time and he camped the hook but luckily my friend had borrow time.
---
I hope you have great dbd matches forever for that
---
Tunneling is when a killer keeps focusing only on killing one person, so as to eliminate someone immediately
---
You can always look at craft stores for a similar pattern on her wrap at the legs. :)
---
To be fair, there are currently a lot of people getting randomly DC‚Äôed out of games as well. 
---
I‚Äôve been DC‚Äôed mid chase at least 6 times since the most recent patch. And sometimes when it happens it tells me the killer DC‚Äôed so the survivors escaped. I don‚Äôt have the option to spectate and I can see the killers perks and add ons it the game isn‚Äôt over. I also keep my BP and item if I have one. Last time it happened was in a Legion match on The Game and it happened to 3 of us. First person was just walking up to a Gen, I was mid chase, and the other was trying to unhook the fourth survivor. Time before that was mid chase against a spirit like the Claudette there.
---
It could be survivors that are just sick of Spirits (and personally I don‚Äôt blame them because I‚Äôm getting sick of facing one every other game as well) but please realize the game is aslso just yeeting people out for no reason. Even killers are getting kicked out of their own games for no reason.

---

---
Dead hard is a health state. . . Lmao. I honestly dont even know what to say to that. 
---
Borrowed time means you were close enough to have it pop off in the first place. And then hit the un hooked person.
---
Adrenaline I'll give you but it also takes getting to the end game to use. So it's not a free health state. 
---
DS wouldn't be active if the survivor got healed got chased and hit twice, and if it is still active you should be good enough as a killer to chase them and get one more hit.  That would mean your chase and two hits was less than like 40 seconds. If they didn't have time to heal before you downed them you probably tunneled them which is what the perk is for.
---
I almost never give hatch, unless they had 2 DCs in the first minute or some shit. What I do is down them once, pick them up, then go as far from the exit gates as I can until they wiggle off. After that I don't chase them at all. If they reach the exit before egc, good for them, if they don't, I at least gave them a chance rather than just hung them. So far only like 2 people didn't escape, but the tension is there every time.

Crouching and staying in lockers is a good way to prevent screaming and tiering up for madness. Also if you want a perk to counter him I suggest using Calm Spirit (Jake Park) to help to not scream when tiering up. These are ways I counter doctor, coming from a doc main.

Use feng min for knowing where/who the killer is with alert, technician for learning skillchecks and lithe to leave the area. Level Bill for borrowed time. David for deadhard and we're gonna live forever (that with borrowed time is basically bbq on each unhook).
---
Is that image of Matthew McConaughey winning the oscar?
---
I think the huntress one is the best but you get whatever one you want
---
And it doesn‚Äôt even count BP offerings or BBQ
---
The add-ons mori, not the offering ones.
---
I brought mine from the microsoft store Halloween DLC and it didn‚Äôt show up, I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs still interesting, why would you need an offering that makes you a character you brought?
---
So far I've gotten the Spirit melee, Wraith torso, Jake head and Dwight torso. I like hiw wraith looks so I may finish that by getting the head but I can only buy two more things.
---
You arent going in the basement too much so I dont see a need for a stun
---
\*Laughs in no changes\*
---
Objection! The Huntress is known for her thickness.
---
 If Myers looks good with no pants then the Huntress would as well. Of course she doesn't match the greatness that is Myers but her thighs need to be respected as well.
---
He means someone intentionally dcing so the other gets a free hatch open to escape even when slugged. There is no way to fix other than have serious penalties for dcing.
---
That looks great, it looks very nice, yes, very nice...
---
But why?
---
why'd you... why would you draw this?
---
Omegablink made everything in her base kit overtuned, hence the term OMEGA.

Base kit add onless she was fine. lol

This is really creative!

Sometimes sarcasm is hard to understand over text, you can't even understand it with speech. Good job, very impressive.

---
It's awesome! Maybe a bit more detail would be good? This could also be exactly how the perk looks and I'm just dumb
---
Oh I'm with you.
---
Its all fun and games until they say your tunneling but the person who unhooked them is the real killer
---
Aww geee thank you :)
---
This is crapper
---
Uh, with all due respect, my fellow, did you watch the clip? Playing as Killer I sacrificed a survivor, went to a gen and downed another close to the hatch. I saw other one healing inside nearby the garage. When I was going to down him, she DC'd on purpose so her friend would get the hatch.  It wasn't long enough but it was very unsportsmanlike. When I question about fixes, just that when one SWF DC the hatch don't INSTANTLY open. I also play survivor and man, that's just bad ;/

This happens with all games. I like the rift for actually adding more content and incentives for different playstyles/perks but people killing themselves is a bummer.
---
I don't think it makes the game more toxic though. People were killing themselves without the rift as well.
---
Old Ds was only going to really help the obsession new ds means EVERYONE can use and have it
---
Thank you, brother. Yeah, I know it's rough and that would punish a solo player and that sucks cuz I play solo as well. But really? They should just make it something like it doesn't INSTANTLY open if someone is in proximity, idk, i am not a game designer yet lmao
---
Thanks for your reply tho!
---
Yeah, but as a 3 tiers tier list, No one can compare to the greatness of Myers, not even huntress. I am dearly sorry for this, but the truth must ultimately be accepted...

---
What if I‚Äôm a solo queue survivor and my team DCs for whatever reason?? Now I have to wait 30 sec for the hatch to open bc YOU don‚Äôt like the idea of the hatch opening immediately after people DC. 
---
Changing the hatch is just gonna punish the people that DONT DC and it would severely punish solo queue survivors for NO REASON 
---
Just bc this happened to you and you‚Äôre upset about it doesn‚Äôt mean it needs to be changed
---
I've been a New main since I got the game, and what I've found to be the best perk build is Spine Chill, Self Care (Claudette perk), Urban Evasion or Balanced Landing are pretty good (Nea perks), and I found Tenacity work really well, but since it's a Detective Tapp perk, you'd have to either buy the DLC or the character in the store. 
---
If you don't have a lot of items to bring to games, Plunderer's Instinct and Pharmacy are pretty good brought together or even separately (Pharmacy is a Quentin Smith perk, idk about Plunderer's Instinct). Highly recommend Borrowed Time (either a Bill or David perk) or any of Claudette's perks really. 
---
Feng's perk are handy, but kinda situational. Lithe is good, Alert is alright, Technician can be a hit or miss at times (even when at lvl 3). 
---
Hope this helps ya out a little!
---
If your after BPs then I guess BBQ is good, although for effectiveness, BBQ has no place in my build lol
---
Wow, thanks for suggestions. And I never thought of that spirit combo xd.
---
Played against a tier1 myers this week, didn't notice a difference (though tru3 mentioned sounds changed, dunno maybe my crappy headphones can't tell the difference)
---
And yeah that's how he is supposed to be, once he hits you just run away to your teammates, with 2 people healing you should be healthy before he catches up.
---
Other than that stay together and if one is injured take hits for each other, there's nothing he can do.
---
I called it, once spirit got dealt with GF was gonna be the new flavor on here.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I live watching Otz‚Äôs GF vids. He always 99s and plays like GF should be played.
---
Seriously though I am looking forward to DC husks. I find the "DC to open hatch" thing really stupid. If survivors are THAT annoyed about being slugged (Which at the very most will last 4 minutes if they've never been downed before and the killer can't find them) to the point they'll DC just bring unbreakable. Personally when I get slugged like that I like to simply crawl away and find a place to bleed to death out of spite. It gives me something to try and accomplish while I'm waiting and I keep my BP.

Just let atomiks analyze his profile. Thats his only comment on this sub ever, and by his up/donvotes, his comments and the subs he visits hes likes to troll. Its attention people like that crave, since they cant get it elsewhere. Dont bother responding to them in any way.
---
I did not expect that ngl
---
Lord forgive for what i'm bout to do...
---
"Too much" feels a little subjective though. Im really also thinking that they should expierience the same drop that survivors get in general - for example from small inclines where hooks are placed a top ive been able to run straight off the side into another chase almost immediately. I just felt that the basement was the best example of poorer map design showcasing a need for a similiar penalty.
---
I have 0 issues revealing him unless it's a laggy lobby, in which his model wouldn't be his hitbox so that makes sense. 
---
He is slower when crouched m'guy. He doesnt retain movement speed. 
---
As a survivor, you have a 3rd person camera that can be used to reveal him. You can hide behind something, which isnt that hard, and reveal him there.
---
Yep sadly
---
Just punish excessive DC and both parties will be happy.
---
Careful with having flashlight on when you run out, you *can* wear out the charges and lose the item :D
---
I agree that it should have never been added, but you don't need to insult people like that, especially when a comment can be taken different ways.

Red rank killer. The only time I have a queue longer than 30 seconds is if I'm playing from 3am to 6am for some reason.
---
Yes, i do that :D It's a a stretched 4:3 resolution with nvidia game filters. I never liked the default game fov and general luminosity, and unfortunately this game is not really creative with video settings, which i think is bad. I use it with Nurse too, and with her is even more of an advantage. It's not game breaking or something like that though. Now, it's not the case of this game, but in many games people use different resolutions to play smoother or simply casue they feel more comfortable.
---
Just nerf recovery addons and fix the dection system. And he is MEH
---
GET A FUCKING EBONY AND GET FINGER FOOD!
---
Why the reset though?

---
Good one buddy.
---
Eh, there have been complaints both for and against GF‚Äôs strength since he was on the PTB. If anything I‚Äôd expect people to call for neo-Freddy adjustments, since he‚Äôs one of the strongest killers against SWF teams
---
Wraith. His torso is open and he looks like a tree.
---
I'm not denying that but her ad ons decreased the necessary skill level to find success way too much in my opinion. At least comparatively to how strong she is.Which is why she was nerfed to be almost always around her base kit power level.
---
No i got it, and i agree, the game sometimes freezes and randomly crashes. It's very badly optimized, but this video was just not the case, please!
---
I always let T-bagging teammates die, even if it's not great for me lol.

Dont 3 gen yourself, simple solution
---
That's what you get you filthy N O E D G A M E R

Can you imagine if killers got a stagger when falling and having to play on Haddonfield against survivors with Balanced Landing lmfao
---
Nurse.. because.. I don't know, I like it very much and her weapon is nice
---
Poor ol‚Äô Billy
---
Thanks!
---
What are you talking about. Pretty sure OP's meme is talking about the disgusting build with thanataphobia, ruin, sloppy butcher and pop goes the weasel with the swing chains addon. It takes absolutely fucking forever to do anything. The killer using this build can just freely fuck around the map and never have to worry about more than 1 gen popping because nothing can ever get done.
---
All he said was that freddy and doctor needed nerfs. He can be annoying to play against depending on the addons used. Sniper doc with a hex totem build can be super annoying as per monto's videos. Haven't run into one of them personally though.
---
Okay so here‚Äôs my bit on this one: I do not think it‚Äôs going to be Rin‚Äôs father, but her distant ancestor, who supposedly came to Japan at some point with the blade Rin uses. The description on the katana, both prestige‚Äôs and original, says that it came with the first of her family to settle in Japan and that it shattered at the dishonor of spilling blood of the Yamaoka family, safe to assume when her father killed her with it. Also, multiple descriptions and the Hallowed Blight skin hint at an Oni being present in her family history, being her legacy to claim as she looks like in  the skin that I mentioned, plus how similar it looks to the mask in the teaser and the mask in the original trailer I think, or the original Yamaoka map.
---
Probably this is going to be completely shit or many people before me have already pointed it out but hey. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for, uselessness and shitty ideas :)
---
How about survivors that meme but you can't catch them.

Not my proudest fap.
---
Maybe because they had lightborn or it could be spirit's passive ability where their head changes direction constantly
---
I think it's because of how she moves when she's breaking the pallet. Unlike other killers, the Spirit moves her head quite a bit when breaking a pallet since she's swinging her weapon at it instead of just kicking it. The Hag kinda has this same thing too.
---
I was watching also, it was hilarious
---
If you read the lore behind Yamaoka Estate, you‚Äôre actually correct! Rin‚Äôs father has taken over what was originally a prized and history piece of property and because of their financial situations, the home they stayed in fell into a state of need for repair. Because he was working himself to death, putting Rin through university and dealing with his wife‚Äôs hospital bills, instead of taking the extra care to keep the house‚Äôs integrity intact he resorted to using cheap Katie raps and moldy pieces just to have a roof over their head. 
---
As stated, ‚ÄúAs the house was stripped of its integrity, an old anger was awakened‚Äù.
---
Entity wants those phanlanges
---
Wdym Enduring is totally meta
---
It means angry demon samurai.
---
Are you a Spirit main per chance?
---
Man, I am really hyped now. Because trust me it happens way too much on PS4. I love this game, just don't wanna be punished or punish someone for no reason.
---
I agree with you! It's just sometimes I GET you wanna move onto next game or do something else and dont leave all things plugged on wasting energy (i am that poor üòÇüòÇ) bleeding out because the killer wanna 4k it's just boring . But I agree with you totally. I most of the times I stay under a hook or do the same as you üòÇüòÇ
---
He should've closed the hatch first
---
Wait how is this guy sweaty? Is it his add-ons, bc I‚Äôm not familiar with most of Billy‚Äôs add-ons
---
I mean it a easy to unlock perk but hardly see people running it these days unless they use it with SF but even I havent seen that in a long time
---
What I did is get invidvidual pieces for each killer for 10 serum - like spirit's sword
---
As a killer, old DS was fairly easy to counter and play around, you could eat it when you wanted to, get it out of the way early, and 35% is a long time, unless people bodyblock chances are you are only dealing with 1 DS a game. You could run enduring, you could juggle to an extent. The problem was it was used by a lot of swf to have 1 good runner get chased for 5 gens, and they would always have DS, so when chases used to be crazy long, it felt like all that time was wasted for the killer, but good killers dont get jebaited into super long chases, they go off and try to apply pressue, so its not the same impact.
---
New DS is good for anti tunnelling, but the fact that its now instant, cant be juggled, everyone's gets the same obsession or not, so no way for the killer to know. The impact DS has had now is much bigger, it could stand to be tweaked so it dosnt encourage bad plays as much. and its a little op if you get hooked with gates open, as there really isnt a thing the killer can do about it if you have ds up and get downed within range of the gates or the hatch.
---
And, even though ive used this myself, if 4 survivors all have ds, and even communicate and coordinate a bit, it really amounts to 4 minutes of invulnerability between them, you can really make things pretty impossible for even a decently skilled killer if you play around that right.
---
Don‚Äôt forget when BVHR actually had the audacity to *buff* flashlight saves, by making it so that if you blinded the killer at any point during the pick-up animation, the survivor was instantly saved (rather than having to time it). 
---
Every once in awhile BVHR really fucks up with a killer nerf and I give them flack (Freddy for ages, obviously. Legion is definitely weak. I still think they went overboard on Miss Piggy repeatedly with multiple nerfs for like three updates straight), but there‚Äôs no question this is a dramatic improvement for them compared to what it was.
---
this was my thought and i think it would be tricky to balance but super fun if they got it right
---
Happens on pc too((
---
You're welcome OP! Bond will help you if you're in or out of chase to know where your teammates are and if they're being chased.
---
Fair enough. I hadn't thought about the obsession aspect of it. I haven't played the game much in a few months because all my friends have been busy and I don't enjoy playing alone, lol
---
I agree with this entirely. I don‚Äôt make a huge deal since Spirit is extremely strong even without the amulet, but it‚Äôs completely worthless once this update goes live. It‚Äôs just a weird design choice in an otherwise really well done nerf
---
Watch bhvr give us no survivors
---
Surely they can just lower the numbers or something then. You can mildly weaken an add-on (though I don‚Äôt think the Amulet was that much of an issue) without nerfing it to the point you‚Äôre worse off with it than without it. 
---
Spirit with Amulet now will actually be weaker than if she went base. An extra few seconds isn‚Äôt worth crippling her power movement speed and recovery time.

Platform: PC

Type of Bug: Unlimited loading after a match.   
---
Desc: Waited for 2 hours to confirm  
---
System specs: i7-6700, GTX-1050ti, 8 GB RAM
---
I think they should make his stalk decay after a while. 99% someone and they are a guarantee free hook because they stay marked for a very long time and he most likely won't change targets.
---
Yeah I wasn't really thinking about making it balanced haha I agree that everything is very overpowered, thanks for the awesome feedback though!
---
Okay but honest to god,
---
that would be the greatest bait-and-switch in the universe.
---
the reveal mechanic is a bit janky, but i don't think that's a ghostface-specific issue. i feel like anything involving line of sight can go either way in this game. i've had matches where i had no trouble revealing him and others where i could stare right at the jerk and nada
---
Cleanse, Wake up and Stop getting your cheeks clapped you've all got exhaustion perks &amp; DS so just use them, cant expect Devs to patchout everything you cant counter
---
JESUS CHRIST I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE PHASING SOUND! I said they should change all cosmetics to have a visible sign like the default skin does. The visible sign only helps IN CHASE, because outside of her terror radius, they already have the phasing sound. Just fix the cosmetics, i didn't say anything else. Other than prayer beads, which the Devs already removed
---
Yes! I can only get so erect.
---
Yes. I walk at 115% speed, suvivors run at 100%, even with a 0.5ms stagger, im still at an objective advantage in a chase.
---
Oh look... Someone who doesn't know shit.
---
And the animation must be the survivor scraping their soles in the ground while making disgusted noises
---
Sorry for the choppy text lol I made this while playing something which isn't uncommon. I had to keep pausing randomly, rereading for reference and essentially reiterating without cleaning up the left over text but of course!
---
Ok I was playing Trapper for a challenge with noes and downing traps. The entire game I got no hits as it was right after rank reset. After all five gens got done a survive tried to teabag me in a area I had a lot of traps. I down them with noed and another survivor runs for a flashlight blind right in my trap. I go to pick I start to walk to a hook but see another survivor try to heal the one on the trap and I down him with noed. The last one was crouching around looking for a chance to heal and steps into a trap. I got a 4K with just two silver emblems
---
Spine chill doe

If he would've stopped it a second earlier you would've looked like a complete jackass. I've had this happen a couple times and it's frustrating but really satisfying when they fail
---
Deceased before the moment the Sub ascends.
---
Instead of Monstrous bring and Lullaby, bring Iron grasp and mad grit
---
Not sure I see an issue with him. Having played against and as him a fair bit I think he is pretty balanced. As ghostface I get broken out of stealth all the time and against him I can break him out a lot too.
---
I literally said it can happen mid chase as I have SEEN it happen, and had it happen to myself. You don‚Äôt know for sure and cannot with the game in its current state. It could literally be either one of the things.

You dumb b**[oy who should stay in school and get very good grades so they can pursue a higher education and be happy in the future.]**
---
Thank you!!!
---
Swing chains should allow us to wakeup at any alarm clock or remove his teleport... Cause running around the map all the time to wake up isn't worth it - if we're all doing that then nothing will get done - it's hard to pop a gen as it is. Also, his teleport is TOO useful with this build.
---
Plus, the more gens you do the harder it gets. You can't counter this build. We can't run perks to counter every killer - it's impossible. We never know who we're up against. Not getting hit isn't really an option either... You're gonna get hit at some point. So anyone who says stuff like this is an idiot.
---
*sun
---
Yeah they can be interchangeable. Either way, this "slow the game down a little bit meme" with freddy is super not cool to go against. It doesn't slow it down a little bit at all. It puts it to a complete dead hault and makes it 100% killer sided.
---
Wasn't mean. Solid escape.
---
Oh sorry didn't realise being Nimrod would shudder you to your core enough to cry about it
---
I hope they rework haddenfield map
---
When I work on Ruin, I suddenly get 5 skillchecks in a row once I'm at 90%, and I don't manage to consistently hit the greats so back down to like 70%, rinse and repeat.
---
I swear, Ruin must have a hidden effect of increasing the odds of skillchecks when the gen is nearly finished.
---
Cry more you baby. Ghostface is not even close to top tier and is easily countered. If you actually tried to improve instead of just bitching every time something doesn't go your way, maybe you'd be a little bit better.
---
Think of all the killer games you‚Äôve played and remember everything a survivor has ever done that royally screwed them and made your job easier. Then, don‚Äôt do those things. It‚Äôs crazy how much playing killer can help with survivor. You should pick it up right away.

No fucking advertising your stream here

Seriously delete this post and advertise on your twitter or soms shit

DID YOU MEAN THE WRAITH
---
I play Xbox &amp; PS4 and don't know about this issue
---
I don't see me crying about it chief, but afaik people are willing to report you and you can get banned for mundane stuff that. I should know, I got banned for jokingly calling someone a moldy muffin, for 3 days.
---
I want a killer vs killer mode
---
they'll be complaining about spirits dad soon enough what with his instant downs.
---
I can't even play huntresses pink hatchets with out people wishing real life death upon me. there's going to be riots when this killer launches.
---
As frustrating as it is it's equally as frustrating to be a non tp killer and have the three farthest gens pop a minute into the game because your whispers is keeping you distracted by the one who's just looting chests nearby
---
It has to do with status effects popping up and memory leaks, you just have to reset when it becomes an issue
---
Yes, only, yes
---
The entity has rewarded you. Go forth, satiate your desire, like the free beast you were before.
---
I was playing while standing up and I had left my tea on the rug under my desk.
---
How to fix:make it so the downside add-ons don't break you out of frenzy but also don't refill the gauge. This would add a use (building stacks of stbfl) but it's also a risk hitting someone again as you'll lose some distance getting to the next survivor.
---
While you create another ‚Äúsurvivor bad‚Äù thread. Like legit your post history is just you bitching about survivors for the last 3 months lol
---
Honestly, I don't think Yamaoka would have cared if Papa had made the house extremely shoddy with cheap materials if he hadn't, ya know, **murdered his family**.
---
There's always a chance to get something restored if there are people who can restore it, and even back in ancient times family was super important. I could totally see it being mildly annoyed at the state the house itself was in but murdering Momma and Rin was a giant leap over the line.
---
I run Prove Thyself so if there's someone with me, we can just push through their missed checks
---
Unless you are playing on switch, which simply doesnt have a player base, survivor ques are much shorter, especially solo ones. Theyve actually been putting in effort recently to persuade more people to play survivor, thats why BP gains have been increased a few times for survivors recently.
---
The thick brick lives!
---
This is so funny. People called Ghostface absolute dogshit forever until Tru3 started playing him and now people are calling him OP. Not that his play style or whatever is optimal, but ever since he showed he can be played at high ranks we went from ‚Äúworst killer in game‚Äù to ‚ÄúOP plz nerf.‚Äù Y‚Äôall are ridiculous
---
Very cute &lt;3
---
I wish the dev's took animation inconsistencies like this more seriously.
---
Damn. I thought this was going to be another meme about him crying over someone saying something bad to him. LOL. Such a dull streamer to watch.
---
xbox one s
---
He was barely coming out of his cool down
---
Cheers, reset my console or restart the game?
---
He's very, very dull to watch.
---
Oink gang rise up! Beautigul art btw
---
When the killer dc'd on me and I didn't get the "escape one trial" reward.
---
Damn, maybe it's my console then but other games are mostly fine
---
Dank
---
Does he? Ha. I know he cries a lot when people type nasty words to him.
---
üê∑‚ò†‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Because I love dinosaurs lol
---
Plus your team mates can reveal him which happens to me all the time as ghostface lol
---
I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath for Miss Piggy. She‚Äôs never been above lower mid-tier and the devs still found ways to nerf her for like three updates straight. They *hate* her.
---
haha funny random
---
Cause boredom
---
Lmao i reply to threads more often than i create them and you're no different chief
---
I‚Äôd prefer to be able to just avoid them, but I would be willing to tolerate this. Tedious frustration might be worth it for tons of extra BP
---
Either or, just restarting the game helps like closing the app and reopening
---
Thank you. The amount of times I have been slugged to see my teammate on the other side of the map and the stumbling killer trying to find them while I get bored out of my mind is so fucking annoying
---
I have been at fault when I play killer of slugging, but only when I see both survivors, cause I know how frustrating it is
---
But who's gonna be the killer
---
Ah I hadn't really noticed that
---
I want using colour blind setting, the quality is just low to make it not lag, in fairness I was able to play DBD mobile in a mc Donald‚Äôs and an airport with the WiFi without getting any lag, so it works! Never had to wait over ten minutes for a lobby as killer and as survivor never longest I had was Seven minutes fastest was eleven seconds
---
Doesnt help 7/10 times the game gives you a coldwind map
---
I think the doctor and many other killers need a complete rework. I agree that the doctor can be extremely annoying to go against if you are using a stealth build, and on small maps he has an unfair advantage when running distressing.
---
Glad it's not just me lol. Ok I'll try the same, I'm on xbox one so might be a bit different but hopefully has a similar effect
---
People actually believed old Legion was good for the game, yikes from me
---
"oh, that's how we're playing... welp might as well..."
---
You have to reveal him with x percent of his body in the middle of your screen. I think it was Entity Education that did a whole video on Ghost Face with this information in it. 
---
I play a lot of ghost face. He is super easy to reveal. It is very difficult to get a full stalk off on someone especially people who are not noobs. They‚Äôre all running spine chill and whatnot. It can be a little janky but it‚Äôs jankiness cuts both ways as you will see if you watch the video.
---
You have a point but i think the devs are probably trying to figure out how to balance the game on all ranks . it's not as simple as making the killers stronger unfortunately. Even if low ranks play in a 4 man they'll most likely all die. The problem imo is survivor communication mixed with game experience and map knowledge.
---
Lord forgive me for what I'm about to do.
---
Best art style
---
Please
---
Yeah exactly what happens! Sometimes it doesn't even seem like the killer has hit me then screen freeze and boom I'm hit. And yeah when you get hit and that 150% speed kicks in it freezes and it gets wasted as I end up running the wrong way!
---
*places 5 traps around first hook*
---
True, no one has to farm. And no one has to stay in a partially filled game. You can't force survivor's to play with a handicap anymore than u can force killers to be nice. So, might as well DC along with the rest of the survivor's and end it quickly, right?
---
Maybe just increasing his base shock range. At the moment, you need mouldy electrode just to have a functioning power. I want to say he needs more than that but going against a good doctor, he seems strong enough already if you know how to use him. Definitely enough to get 2k which is what they balance killers around.
---
???
---
I guess Myers‚Äô stalking is laggy on dedicated servers or something https://youtu.be/Laq522dTt3Q
---
Killer opens kitchen cabinet, hatchets fall out. "HUNTRESS."
---
Some people just don‚Äôt have enough brain cells to calculate things like that.
---
This guy is a known crybaby killer main. Literally everything he says about survivors is a complaint or insult
---
What an adorable projection you got there, like the entire life of this game hasnt been survivor mains bitching until every killers nonviable past rank 15. Rank 1 before reset as im sure you've seen stalking my post history, so  you really aint got shit thats gonna stick
---
With great power comes great toxicity
---
No joke I would shit.
---
I've gotta ask, is dweard really that special? I had it unlocked as soon as I activated my steam code for DBD, I even had it on the console version. Same with the chuckles mask for trapper.
---
This was a game I had last night. I was the only one to complete two gens. He killed everyone else. Gens took forever because of his add one, dying light, a ruin that nobody could fine and pgtw. Most boring game of my life
---
This. I mean we got nothing we didn't have from the previous one except the title of the chapter. :C 
---
But I think this cements that it's comin' Tuesday/Wednesday. BANK THOSE BP BOYZ.
---
yes, I know moris exist, thanks captain obvious. That's not what I meant at all.
---
People are bored of the same killer every game. Surprise surprise.
---
challenge in a casual game, lol
---
Rather shallow and pedantic.
---
No reason dev stream on Thursday would be late. They've done it before. Release all the stuff first, then the next stream is simply talking all about it.
---
It didn't do that before with me, so i am thinking its a new big that'll hopefully get ironed out, otherwise idk. It doesnt happen to me to much, but when it does it is very noticeable. Sorry to hear it's pretty much every game for you
---
"Stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself"
---
So... Punish a killer for doing their job of hitting survivors?
---
The devs made it so rank 20-16s could get teamed with higher ranks in order to pip more easily, as you know a whole team with rank 20s would just get destroyed
---
That boob grab tho üòè
---
Bro u just posted cringe, delete it or the entity will add you to its cringe collection

what did he say?

Especially when you play spirit

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dx8saj/survivor_tutorial_unhooking_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
As far as I know it was the moonwalk cheese or the add-on drain. People didn't seem to have too much of an issue with the base timer reduction, as it required many hits thus wasting a ton of time, and with the multiple direct nerfs to the power (miss cancels it and it needs to full charge) they could've kept that in and just changed the addons that people complained about, particularly the mix tape.
---
They should rework all their add-ons. Make the 5 tapes augment Legion's power, with each focused on: speed, tracking, slowdown, damage, infinite(fuming mixtape) respectively. Rework all the VR add-ons to moderately boost 2 aspects of Feral frenzy, consisting of mend time, bleed out speed, recharge of power, and stun duration. I also recommend giving 12 of the VR add-ons fuming mixtape's current effect and make it actually work properly. Also just make the values on the brown-green add-ons give more than a 0.2 seconds of effects, similarly to how good Demogorgon's browns are.
---
After that just buff the base power to have faster movement speed, not punish you on a single attack, and properly reward you when you hit all the survivors in 1 frenzy.
---
Legion doesn't need much to be reworked, and the longer they don't do it, the more I cry.
---
Im not a rank 1 or anything but i feel like survivor by its nature should and would be something that requires communication. Its not like you can fight the killer back or dodge attacks like most ppl would irl. You get ran down and smacked on the head. I think instead of punishing people for having friends. They should find a way to make games more enjoyable for our killers. I dont think excluding a percentage of the player base would solve the problem. Growth comes from word of mouth no more swf thats gonna directly effect new ppl from wanting to join or not . i have a buddy i bought the game for him and he refuses to play alone. The only time he'll play is if we in a group with mics for communication. I haven't seen the data but i feel like most swf aren't the sweaty rank 1s you're up against. They're problem low ranks and get bodied by trappers. I wont pretend like i completely understand the game but i feel like a ranks 10-1 the playing field evens up a bit and a lot of killers dont like it. Swf are apart of the problem but i think it goes deeper then just 4 guys on discord.
---
I'm pretty sure it's just flickering because of that particular position of the cursor. This sometimes happens. It's not a big bug.
---
So a perk has to be meta to be worth a perk slot? suggesting that "most of the time survivors arent even near a locker" is just dumb, high rank players know where and how to use lockers correctly.
---
I never said iron maiden is some sort of must have god perk for these killers, i literally said its just good. thats it. its good. Just like half the perks in this game, they are just good.
---
Im both red rank on killer in survivor, but thanks.
---
Fuck all Myers
---
Jump Rope, Swing Chains, Thanatophobia, Dying Light actually makes me want to jump off a building
---
 Had a similar match where I (rank 10) was paired with all ranks 16s including the killer. I was at least able to get ruin and run the killer for most of the match while they did gens. Only two of the others got out due to NOED though.
---
r/deadbydaylight: *experiences minor bug that has been in the game longer then i can remember*
---
Also r/deadbydaylight: PRETTY GOOD JUB SO FARRRRR AHAHAHAHAH! PRETTY GUD JUB! PRETTY GUD JUB!
---
You all remember who started this joke right? it god old quickly.
---
This has been in the game for ages. But it honestly doesnt matter
---
PC. The survivor tutorial won't let me unhook Meg? I go into the basement and in the locker, but the Trapper doesn't pull me out and hook me. I'm assuming that's why the basement chest with the med kit doesn't spawn. I go to unhook Meg, and it won't give me the prompt at all.
---
It makes people play like idiots. The rift is a good idea executed horribly.
---
Hit em with the Marilyn Monroe
---
That's not even that bad
---
Why can‚Äôt you have challenge in a casual game? I‚Äôm sorry I truly don‚Äôt understand that part of your argument. The first part I can understand, but when every killer gets nerfed and there‚Äôs only a few viable ones to play of course you will see them more often. I bet the amount of ghost faces and billies you face will increase with the recent nerfs to nurse and spirit.
---
And in a month or so this process will restart with people complaining about the next top tier killers.
---
I've closed out of it and come back to it three times, and each time I get the same results
---
Oh yes, fuck all of them. wink
---
&gt; Mobile
---
I don't want to imagine how that performs, I get -on some maps pretty severe- lags on when playing killer on PC even...
---
Happened to our meg earlier today, the spectator cam also glitched so instead of following the downed/hooked/glitched survivor it followed the killer around. Killer had to DC after the end game collapse had finished and they were both still in game
---
Thank god it works like that cause i had somebody try to DC to give hatch when i had already gotten 2/4 moris
---
A killer has a good chase power (to down survivors before gens get done)
---
"This killer is unfun, no counterplay! I go down in 10 seconds no matter what"
---
A killer has slowdown (to down survivors before gens get done)
---
"This killer is unfun, you just sit on a gen holding m1 forever! Smh"
---
What is a good killer power that isnt "unfun" to survivors anyways?
---
Saying that ark and dbd are my favorite games this is just amazing to me thank you
---
If it worked by giving the progress based on whoever is healing when it's finished it would be better.
---
Like, actual horror. Nice
---
Fair point tbh
---
Im not camping the pallets when the killer is right behind me and i cant loop another time i stand at the pallet for one second then when i try to drop it i start selfcaring because i try to always get the stun
---
If you don‚Äôt have adrenaline and balanced landing, get them as soon as possible. And don‚Äôt be afraid of getting chased, it‚Äôs how you learn
---
Because I can
---
No ? Didn't think so
---
Wanker
---
Please get a life or end yours, idc which.
---
Like the ones where you need to hear people? Yeah. I have found all of them to be pains in the ass. It's because you need to chase down survivors except nothing seems to go your way and it takes forever. All the survivor challenges are like that. The killer challenges are so much easier.
---
I just loaded into a game where someone dc‚Äôd and I obviously got no emblems but it counted as 1 gold? Wtf is this game
---
and the lullaby when they're asleep.  
---
ive had so many people run INTO ME when they're looking behind themselves and i smack em square in the mouth.   so much fun.
---
In my case too. I know it's all random but I'll be damned if for a select few the games points a middle finger at every time.
---
Same issue here. If I go to ‚Äúselect challenge‚Äù on the rift it will give me a disconnected from host error and I can continue. If I leave the match normally it is an infinite loading screen every time. Seems to have happened after the cross play update.
---
Just got into a game and someone dc‚Äôd while loading so the match cancelled and I obviously got not emblems, but it counted as 1 gold? Wtf is this game
---
Trying to always get the stun is a stupid, stupid idea. Stop playing like that. You are the architect of your own problem.
---
Regardless, this makes no sense because, like I said, the pallet drop prompt takes precedence over self-caring
---
I'm still holding out hope that Rin's dad is the survivor and the Yamaoka Oni is the killer. Rins dad spending eternity getting sacrificed by the ruthless bloodthirsty monster he created seems like just the kind of thing that the Entity would do
---
Respect your elders, clown! üò°
---
Blood lodge
---
we are slowly but surely making the meme Nea is a killer more and more of a possibility.
---
Trapper got a buff with hag a while back, making them both considerably better.  The last time i remember them changing doc is when they removed snapping out of it from the healing classification
---
Do the stabby boi, legion
---
Oni as the killer, Rin's father as the survivor!
---
I‚Äôm legit a killer main, but ok lol. Just admit you‚Äôre salty bud
---
I‚Äôve had this happen before. I just close the window and start watching tv or browse the internet and check in.  I‚Äôm giving them the satisfaction to know it annoyed me.
---
Its 1 minute and 20 seconds not counting great skill checks progression - devs shown the data for average gen speed and it was 82 seconds with ruin and 60 seconds solo without ruin - dont post time if you dont know what are you talking about
---
But he loses all progress if he m1s the person so if you break him out or a teammate breaks him out he literally cant attack you unless he wants his stalk progress to get reset. But then again who actually stalks as ghostface?
---
It‚Äôs console
---
Yall going thru my post history to talk shit but im the salty one? okay pal whatever you say
---
iron will is only useful against nurse and spirit - see that's where you shown how worthless your entire point of view is - i am glad that people like you have no power to change anything

That‚Äôd be interesting! The one that ended the bloodline (she was the only child of Yamaoka her bio says) being hunted by the demon that, one way or another, looks over the descendants, considering the blade was not broken by the presumed Oni, but by Rin‚Äôs dad when he spilled his own blood
---
When a demon as more honor than you...lol
---
Yes the blood points and the lore will never go away the only thing you won't get is the rift fragments
---
also could be the first yamaoka mentioned in the lore of yamaoka estate, especially with lines like
---
&gt; No one could match the raw fury of his katana, which elevated him to a legend. They say his devilish mask haunted the dreams of all men.
---
Seems like someone got fucked real hard by a SWF team.
---
Is this ironic
---
I just played as an m1 and used the shock to find people early and occasionally stop pallet drops or window loops
---
Either that or sharing challenges would be great. I play with my fianc√© and she has a hard time with some of hers.
---
Im more concerned about the new killer perks they all seem to be the same thing 1. Reasonable condition 2. Mediocre to meh affect 3. Ridiculous cooldown for some reason. Like thrilling tremors, downing and picking up a survivor is a reasonable condition and the blocking gens is ok but then why does it have a cooldown? Surge is pretty much the same thing. So is cruel limits but with a god awful affect. Like i really like the recent survivor perks like inner strength,fixated, and even second wind seeing play every now and then but the new killer perks are way over balanced its like theyre afraid theyd be op with out the cooldown for some reason.
---
Lol I wasn‚Äôt even sure what he was annoyed by. Once when I was a rank 15 or something like that (hadn‚Äôt had a chance to rank up after rank reset yet) and two of my other teammates were around the same rank and my last teammate was rank 8 or something lmao. I felt so bad for them. I‚Äôm a pretty decent player, but they didn‚Äôt know that yet lol.
---
I never DC but Forever Freddy is an instant DC. I'm sorry, I know I'm making it worse for my teammates and I'm an ass because of it, but it's the most un-fun in a game. I'm not wasting my free time like that. Life is too short.
---
PC players are more eager to move onto the next match but on PS4 you'll get a message after every match
---
Can someone explain a bit more about those legacy cosmetics? I heard Scott Jund, say that he knows a lot of people who have or had at some point said cosmetics and that a lot of people cheated their way into obtaining them.
---
Were they a reward from some easily abusable event?
---
yea, because billy can do a lot to me when I'm behind a wall
---
stealth is boring anyway
---
but then when its your turn to be chased, you don't get the 'fun' part of the chase where you can use these tools to your advantage.
---
im surprised you cant burn the spirit like you can with Wraith
---
Sometimes ;)
---
They don't have to deal with the nasty stun from coming out of frenzy, so you put them straight back in m1 killer mode and you've shut a viable loop. All in all, a win for a Legion
---
I tried running altruistic perks like this once and literally every single fucking player runs to the very back corner of the map. It‚Äôs so annoying because half of the time the killer is on the other half of the map chasing somebody else. Even worse when I‚Äôm running spine chill, and they don‚Äôt think that maybe I‚Äôm not running away for a reason. Or worse x 2 when they don‚Äôt stop running and you just never see them again lol
---
When you confuse the words safe and late.
---
Freddy with 3-4 game slowdown perks and 1-2 addons that also slow down the game. Makes the gens, healing, and just about everything else go slow as molasses.

I like Amanda as the killer, but I just don‚Äôt like how the skin looks :| They did her dirty and gave her the body of a teenage boy lmao
---
You know it's not DBD related and post it anyway? Ok.
---
Thats every reset
---
Meanwhile I think there should be an assisted "snap out of it" where survivors can slap eachother to get them out of it, because I cannot break out of tier3 and am utterly useless. 
---
It's not the skill check zone so much as it appearing anywhere on the screen that fucks me over.

Behind a walk, in a locker, near a hooked person while injured, near a nearly done gen, while looking for a hatch injured, for mindgames

No uses at all - this just shows how bad of a player you are

Yes, but it feels especially worse on this reset. I'm actually starting to lose interest because I am currently losing most of my matches, and that is just unfun.

I usually only send rude memes to some of the absolute saltines I go up against, but I never thought about sending nice memes to friendly and helpful teammates.

We hear the footsteps behind us and think it's the killer.
---
Favorite moment ever in DBD was when this teammate took the time to call me a shitty player (during the match!) because he decided to run the same way as me and got stuck behind me and hit. After he was hooked in basement, I went down there, teabagged, then left lmao. Killer wasn‚Äôt even near the basement. Although someone saved him a couple of seconds after I left :/

Nobody believed old Legion was good for the game. But they do think they were over nerfed which they fucking were. This is why every time BVHR states they're "reworking" a killer people get prematurely upset. Be cfd ause they're demonstrably horrible at nerfing what's needed. Keep your yikes shit to yourself.

* _Platform:_ PC

* _Description:_ Permanent Flashlight Blind

* _Steps to reproduce:_ From the two times it happens if you Hag TP while flashlight blinded and then instantly do an action that locks your camera (picking someone up), you will keep blindness. I haven't been able to test this as the friends that play this game rarely do so. It has happened twice in game and both times I caused it to happen I was flashlight blinded, I tp'd and then hit someone and picked them up while flashlight blinded.

I don't mind giving the survivor 200 more points. The game isn't Killer vs Survivor, its Player vs a score requirement.

Talking from experience with a full legacy survivor and 3 legacy 1 killers, I wasn't a fun time, I spent countless nights with bs bloodwebs trying to finish each level before the deadline but I was definitely worth it. I wish I played earlier in the games life so I could get more but w/e
---
AAAAAHHHHHHH!
---
Bitch how dare you still live
---
Jhon kramer?
---
Think they hacked gamefiles to give themselfs the legacy items. The OG players back then had to grind the old shitty webs and it was a real pain in the ass. But we also had people who got fucked on their gamefiles and when reported about it got their bloodpoints back but not their legacy items. So yeah some of them hacked the gamefiles to get them back.

Franks plus SSS is still genuinely good, but you need Tinkerer and Dark Devotion to make it work.

BIG HENRY NO
---
Honestly I'm just confused as to why they didn't combine this with the teaser trailer. Would've been simple, to just have the second half of this teaser fade in right after the first teaser.
---
This is just auto haven
---
Depending on my killer I gotta score more points in Deviousness.
---
Like Billy doesn't make much in that category so I gotta just Zoom around the map.
---
Hag on the other hand normally deviousness every game, and with the ~2k bonus from getting a 4k its pretty hard to fail.

Mikey or Plague I just sit there and stare. Stalk and Vomit.

Wraith does the Bing Bong.

Im just trying to get challenges done and my teamates are aholes
---
What is that?
---
Thanks, but unless I just haven't seen it I don't think they have anything planned for pig.  They said they were going to update docs addons a while ago though so that's why i picked doc.
---
I just realized jeff looks lile ps1 haggrid
---
Probably to build hype.
---
lmao
---
A true soldier
---
During the Halloween event, I decided I'd let them finish the pumpkin generators as long as they don't try to struggle away when I'm trying to hook them on my special hooks. Never happened.
---
Bonuses don't count, just the base amount earned. So it's a minimum of 7 matches.
---
This was a joke
---
Lol this exact picture was posted 3x in a row
---
99% of the time playing against him I get killed, even with a full swf group.
---
I was everytime "teabagging" and making the "come here" emote to show the killer that I want him to hit me.
---
Now I understand why the killer almost never did come and was only standing and staring at me now I feel bad ^^
---
If you appreciate samination
---
This exact picture was posted twice before this in a  row. Look below your post lol.
---
Only the base amount counts, before modifiers.
---
I can‚Äôt commend the use of NOED but that was a pretty satisfying kill.
---
Oh sorry i didn‚Äôt know! Thanks!
---
Lore-wise, it‚Äôs the killer‚Äôs job to feed the entity. 
---
And she(/he/it) feeds on extreme emotions, like hope of getting out of the trial. Steamrolling the survivors = not much to eat = unhappy entity.
---
I had an Ash do this to me after he purposely got my attention.
---
 He ran straight into a locker and I figured I had enough time. So I pulled him out, waited for DS. All I saw was a DC 5 seconds later
---
For sure haha (I‚Äôm a killer main) but this is certainly for the memes
---
‚ÄúHAHA SALTY BABY KILLER SALTY BABY WHOS MAD ARE YOU MAD TRASH TUNN- *oh fuck*‚Äù
---
This was posted like around five minutes ago, check below my dude
---
Y the downvotes? I literally need the killer to focus on me for some challenges, and any experienced one will leave me a minute into the chase ._.
---
I use it for people like this other wise I'll drop them off at the exit
---
Indeed :P
---
I know that. But none of it was added at all. Not even the base amount.
---
I usually get survivors that wave me over. That's more preferred i suppose
---
The base amount didn‚Äôt even count
---
Moth San or Orange Juice?

This shit was fucking hilarious I love Otz

I'm in this picture and I don't like it

okay nobody cares about the lore

I think thats part of what I like! I've been playing since release and i just plain love this game, so a little extra spice and chaos is a good time in my book. Hope you're having a good time with these challenges, friend!
---
Until they have unnerving presence and you fail the skill check
---
Well played. I'd be getting so pissed lol. That Billy should have left you alone, he chases way too long with no hit
---
Cus they didn't wanna destroy a killer. They just took away her 2 most annoying things
---
Holy shit I'm an idiot, thank you

And nobody cares about pips, what‚Äôs your point?

Adept demo? That's pretty difficult

Four Tomes per Rift. Think of the Tomes as being episodes in a season (Rift).

We are on Rift 1 and Tome 1.2
---
She was playing nurse and face camped the 1st guy slugged the next sluged my friend found the last dude all fine but my friend used unbreakable got up they all lost anyway in the end which is fine but then she called my friend a trash bitch. Then complained the perk is too broken she then banned my friend from chat when she asked why she was mad at her for using A situational perk. Then umbra procceded later to use the same perk and wins a game because of it which was funny cuz it wasnt a broken perk when she used it.
---
It‚Äôs about sending a message
---
‚ÄúNea fucking slaughters the huntress‚Äù
---
I desperately need episode 2
---
I did something similar against michael so my teamate was hooked so I put the gate on 99 while my teamate opened the other one then followed my teamate to the hook where michael was camping I had hime chase me to the unopened gate while my two other teamates got away then I opened the other gate bc if it was opened he would just go back  too the hook before they got away opened the gate and got out saving everyone
---
Orange plant succ
---
People weren't just playing different
---
Most games were thrown trying to SUCC
---
My very first match after selecting it the BP I earned didn‚Äôt count towards it. But every match after that was fine
---
How is your FOV so wide without shadowborn?
---
Nea is the killer, that was thought behind it anyways lol
---
The devs still ban for it. Its one of their bannable offenses.
---
I definetly am, due to rank reset I a game with braindead teammates and a good killer. If it wasn't for the satisfaction of depleiting two medkits in one game for the challenge I probably would have considered that game as a pretty bad one
---
Ah yes, glowing lockers.
---
Gets downed again almost immediately
---
"Well this stinks"
---
Probably the same person trying to farm points to sell the account later
---
Great now you just have to sprint around everywhere at 200% and infinity loop and your cosplay will be complete!
---
They knew what they were getting in to when they added TTV to their name. Basically just turns the game to hard mode
---
That Thriller dance at the end tho
---
I use DH+ToTH so I can know if someone is going to be clensing my totem.
---
So still similar to Cursed Legacy, neat
---
But is that less annoying than tapping?
---
Don't feel bad, they'll use that to their advantage.
---
M1 just means their only attack is the Mouse 1 button (or equivalent). Wraith is an example of an M1 killer, but Billy isn't because he has the chainsaw. Plague is also not an M1 killer because she has her purge.
---
Hopefully this helps identify who falls in to which categorization.
---
Emergency medkit farming
---
I've been saying that she required skill this entire time unless you were using easy mode ad ons. And how is making the killer harder to play destroying her base kit. She's still the best killer in the game yet you say she isn't worth playing that makes no sense. I also never said it was a good rework but rather a necessary evil (at least for now) to keep the strongest killer fairly difficult to play effectively
---

This could very well be the multi-killer bug that can be done in custom, which isn‚Äôt nearly as much of a problem since it‚Äôs usually done on purpose. Hard to tell when all there is to go off of is this short recording of a screen

It's also good for this level of tome challenges, since three of the challenges either require you to heal others, or consume medkits, or both.

I have 4 different comments on this post explaining it

Then you take out your frustration on an innocent survivor
---
What add-ons do you have?
---
I'm a dick because I don't like other people being toxic? Ok
---
I was speaking to a friend about this. We joked about a twin sister away at book club on the night of the murder.... she has a special perk whenever being chased by Rin, Rin constantly cries and gets a rebuff on speed ü§£
---
same for arabic
---
It encourages safe saves and healing your team. What (new) idiocy have you seen?
---
I'm thinking it's around 11-13 seconds but I probably did the math way wrong.
---
most of them are trash and cute. but mostly trash
---
Uploading the full game, pre-lobby included, is probably the only way. There‚Äôs really no need for you to vie for the trust of internet strangers, nor is there for me to prove/disprove this is real; it‚Äôd be cool if you could report the bug to BHVR though, likely the best decision in case this is legitimate and potentially able to be reproduced.
---
Overwhelming? You pick missions which help with progressing the rift, which gets you free stuff for playing, and some of the missions give lore pieces
---
r/PerksByDaylight might be able to help you, there‚Äôs likely a template online if you do some googling.
---
Freddy has said bitch on multiple occasions.
---
He asked what perks to use..... 
---
those are good perks.....
---
To be honest idk how to flashlight the demigorgon either
---
Aren't the ptb's usually only a week long?
---
I hate the unhooking one , unhook 15 people safely
---
Everyone except leatherface and pighead hates their parents
---
Any killer that relies on their basic attack to damage survivors
---
 But im tired of just seeing meta perks. I'd always say the correct answer as every perk is good in their own right. So try get them all and see which ones you like
---
Dont care about this killer at all,waiting on the next one,hopefully more interesting.
---
Balanced landing opens up more opportunities to get distance than just pallets and windows
---
Well the only question I got is was this on xbox and do you remember the killers name
---
In all honesty, I agree.. I just though it'd be an interesting change to suggest.
---
I sure try lol, but the thing about Myers players they go full tryhard for their stalk lmao.
---
Its a fun perk when it works
---
See I think this is alright but the perks needs a timer as well.
---
Well that's true
---
Y‚Äôall not stuck in the game ya know.
---
how can you camp without camping ?
---
Also the vomit isn't centered, it goes slightly to the left
---
Tbagging is justified for this
---
Spider Piggie
---
There are certain spots by the pallet that will let you self care but only if you stand still. If you move and drop it at the same time it will drop the pallet instead of self care.
---
im not saying murdering next to the exit gate is toxic. im saying that purporsfuly letting someone open an exit gate and downed them and THEN hooking them/moring them is toxic. and what that 50/50 coin flip would do was decided by the owner. it could have been giving them hatch or just murdering them, not closing the hatch infront of their face like a cunt
---
I'm jealous I didn't think about this first
---
No I mean they place traps all around me but don't camp.
---
Survivor isn't kicking the killers ass it's no fun they don't want challenge they want to bully
---
I'd say she's balanced. But the recharging blinks can be frustrating when playing her. Combine that with her post phase stun and she's not fun to use.
---
just because it doesnt offend you, it doesnt mean its a bad thing to do and others just dont mind it suddenly either. the world doesnt revolve around you
---
I swear people will never be satisfied and will always have something to say about killers
---
I...what ? You do realise this is EVEN worse right ?
---
Forever Freddy...as in...gens DONT get done the second I spawn in?
---
WHERE DO I SIGN UP FOR THIS BEAUTY
---
I'm aware of this, but even being hit with a little bit of vomit will give a survivor the infection splatter on the hud (or injure them if it's corrupt). My problem is the game not registering any of the vomit at all.
---
Take off Self Care.  It's a garbage perk anyway.  Boom problem fixed no more accidental 1 minute heals when you're trying to drop a pallet.
---
You will be getting banned for DCs soon
---
Keep the timer and ur golden. I hate getting dsed after hooked someone else
---
I actually wouldn't recommend Dead Hard, it's not functioning properly and the killer can hit you in it, and sometimes it just flat out doesn't work
---
Easiest = Killer on beginner Ranks
---
Easy = SWF
---
Normal = Solo Survivor
---
Hard = Solo Survivor with potato mates
---
Very Hard = Killer on red ranks
---
"Its all about little special me, i chose what offends you, baby."
---
I remember farming relentlessly when there we plenty of bots infesting DBD. It took around 3.25 mil Bloodpoints to prestige when it now takes around 1.65 (I think) to prestige.
---
IT'S A HARD NUT LIFE
---
Must be nice
---
I think it's honestly funny and people should learn to laugh at it. Why get bothered by this shit?
---
see the issue is, a killer like huntress can easily down both people and just hook the other person first.
---
DS is fine as it is tbh
---
You're a sad sack of shit, rather than talk about the post im replying to your weak minded pathetic ass is stalking thru my post history tryna bully me about 3+ month old posts you dont know or care to know the context of
---
Swf is easier than killer which is easier than solo.
---
You should take a moment to reflect on things and learn not to be bothered by such things.
---
It's not like body blocking or hijacking the game somehow.
---
Apparently Freddy is the only one a build like this applies to
---
Killer Tutorial also doesn‚Äôt Trap Meg anymore, lol. The Trap is default closed and you can‚Äôt even pick it up
---
They released a trailer for something that's supposed to come out in a week. Check it out, it's on Vivziepop's channel
---
actually depends on your movement. when moving right, it goes left and vice versa
---
I think we're saying the same thing, actually. My bad. I misread what your first post said, and thought you were saying a new Rift starts every time we get a new piece of the Tome.
---
Cool story
---
It syncs your framerate of your computer to the framerate of your game to reduce screen tearing at the cost of a but if input lag.
---
I have a conspiracy theory. People use ruin to counter gen rushing. But to counter ruin either get rid of the totem or do great skill checks, so if you don‚Äôt use ruin you get gen rushed because survivors are good at hitting great skill checks now.
---
Just saying. Suck it up and take the loss or DC and get banned. 
---
Either way, it‚Äôs a you problem.
---
DS is already strong, this would make it way too strong.
---
I've done 3 complete Gens and finished all 3.. but I think you need just the "300%" and don't need to be at the second it completes the gen
---
750TI isn‚Äôt very powerful for this game.
---
I have a GTX950 on my older laptop and it just BARELY runs the game on Low Settings and 75% Resolution.
---
That's interesting. So does that mean the actual visible vomit is slightly misleading? Cause that might explain it.
---
Oh, thx
---
Went back to check, can confirm console
---
B-b-but I was told Forever Freddy was impossible to escape against!!!!!!!! The survivor mains told me it‚Äôs impossible!!!!
---
Your a good man
---
What'd they say?
---
This sub always finds something to complain about even after they're done complaining about not getting anything new or fun added to the game. Good god.
---
People in the comments actually defending these DC's make me question my sanity
---
then why was old Dying Light a thing for so long.
---
What if the timer was increased by an additional 30 secounds but if the killer hooked someone else before the timer runs out, it deactivates.
---
Or maybe not 30 secounds, just 10 or whatever people feel is balanced. I feel like some sort of change is needed to stop killers from getting DSed after hooking someone else

---
But they‚Äôre doing what they‚Äôre supposed to do? That‚Äôs their only power...
---
I'd be okay with it disabling if someone else got hooked but using it twice a game. If the killer doesn't tunnel its not going to make a difference but it'll punish killers who tunnel off the hook twice as much
---
Actually, this reset felt worse to me too. It feels like my teams are significantly worse than normal. Glad I'm not the only one who thinks it's been different lol
---
I'm on level 30 of 70 and it's just too much grinding. I just really want the first premium rift.. but I don't think I will buy the next one, it's too much time, too much grind, too much focus on completing Challanges and not playing for fun.
---
Freddy is the only one with significant Action Speed Reduction Add-Ons. No other Character has something so versatile and powerful when stacked with Thanat/Ruin/Pop/Dying Light/etc. unless you count Bubba‚Äôs Grimy Chainsaw Add-Ons.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs possible reach over -50% Action Speed, and it makes doing Gens take FOREVER and constantly having to wake up/heal a pain in the ass.
---
Reason why I always run prove thyself so we can get more progression on the generator before someone inevitably misses a skill check. Although I feel bad when the killer doesn't bring ruin. Game goes too quickly.
---
Yea I gotta say I‚Äôm in the middle of P3ing her and whenever I see the survivor look at their arms I always go sweet now I can leave him alone for a bit and hunt others she doesn‚Äôt have any infection like what?
---
So?
---
Yeah, I DC against that shit. I know it‚Äôs unethical, but it‚Äôs just so unrewarding and the matches are so long and boring. Throw in a ruin into that, a few potatoes, and you never pop a single gen because people just get hooked left and right. 
---
Instant DC. No, thanks. Longest match was 41 minutes and I still lost. Never again.
---
I take advantage and camp ruin with a trap set and have my insidious trapper hide to hook those whobget trapped.
---
This has been posted a minimum of 4 times in the last half hour lol
---
are you on PC?
---
Dedicated servers + vomit = weird shit. also, her vomit is actually not a line, those are multiple projectiles that are connected by a visual effect. this means that survivor might fit in between two projectiles and avoid the hit even tho visually they got cut in half
---
I do this and im sorry I feel bad I do but I try and help to take hits for others and do a couple gens but yea this has made the game less fun
---
Yeah
---
Yeah was gonna comment that, remember those jake mains my god how did we even play killer lol
---
Yes, but what the hell do you mean you side with yourself?
---
Wait, I thought he was PS1 Hagrid???
---
I hate that shit. I can understand 1 trap, but 5 traps, really? Entity shouldn't allow killers to put traps within 16 meters of the hooked survivor. It is ridiculously annoying to watch Hag put down all of her traps to make sure people on the hook get to the second stage or die.
---
Wait.. I already gotta wait 5-10 minutes before each match. That's a rather low queue time
---
My dude that one is ez just run borrowed time :D
---
Sure lol
---
Because no one else turns like that so it would never work. Also he ran towards him after opening the gate instead of towards the gate, I'm guessing because of joystick. If he would have ran to the gate from the start the 360 wouldn't have been necessary. I hope this explains "so".
---
Apparentely the ptb is on tuesday so i guess its somewhere around that time , probably before They unlock the ptb
---
Survive with friends, then killer, then solo survivor.
---
Monday I‚Äôd guess. I doubt it‚Äôs during the weekend, but I could be wrong.
---
Ironic. You've just perpetuated it by posting about it.
---
REEEEEE
---
These guys got it right
---
Just wait. Soon we will be able to hit great skill checks with our eyes closed. We get so much practice. I find corrupt intervention to be more useful personally.
---
it costed me my arm
---
Lol shut up go back to crying about how you cant tunnle or camp because survivors are op
---
Yeah.. who the hell wants extra exposure when the platform they use is already cluttered with thousands of streamers?
---
*Touche*
---
You just need to be on gens when they pop
---
I'm on console so I thought it might just be the odd survivor with bad ping. But I assumed the vomit was one long projectile so that probably explains it, thanks :)
---
oh my that was the closest indeed
---
I honestly don‚Äôt remember but it was some stupid,  salty ‚Äúsurvivor bad‚Äù shit
---
Then what happens to those who DC because of bad internet? This will make them suffer as well.
---
Assuming you don't get a row of flat maps decide not to run a train on your pathetic (/s) perk.
---
Lol, ok
---
This explains "how". So
---
Same thing happend to me also when i was using it and running out at the same time.
---
This is how I got mine. I finished two gens on my own, and joined an Ace to finish the last gen.
---
Not really an issue either way but ok.
---
That's what challenges are for. Lol. For those people who want something more to do. It's cool either way...dont like any more grinding just dont touch it. Want to grind some extra BP? You got the challenges. Super cool addition to the game doe.
---
Move on and fuck off you sorry excuse for a human being
---
Dinga ding dinga ding
---
They see me rollin' They hatin' Patrolling and tryin' to catch me ridin'
---
Lost my prestige nurse and claudette because of a deleted save file. Got back my bloodpoints but not the legacy. I'm still salty about that
---
I cannot wait to start seeing these toxic players get banned for DCs.
---
I played 12 killer games this week. That's 48 survivors.
---
I had 16 players DC. I played only two games from 12 where people didn't DC.
---
This attitude where people think it's okay to ruin a teamplay-oriented game simply because they are too bad (or lazy, or childish) to counterplay is seriously hurting this game.
---
That guy trying to justify his dc as "wasting his free time" is immensely poorly-reasoned. Forever freddy is part of the game, if you don't like it: bitch to the devs. Don't punish your teammates and waste the killer's time.
---
/u/jixezalox thinks his time is more valuable than everyone else's, and this kind of entitlement is exactly what we don't need in this game.
---
Shameful display.
---
What kind of 360 is that
---
Crouching pig hidden oink
---
Noob3 inspires all the bad, rank 16, triple prestiged Nea's to ''flashlight save''. Which is something, I am really grateful for, I love it when such player is tailing me, it's one less gen jockey and 98% of the time they just end up being useless hunk of perks.
---
Tf how many shards for a level up do you recieve
---
I thought they patched this out already
---
bans for DCs and delay the hatch opening by 1 minute for every DC. So now this ‚ÄúDC for hatch‚Äù thing goes away in its entirety
---
If you DC because of spirit or any other killer, you're a loser.
---
I swear, dbd people can be such crybabies.
---
It's a goddamn game, there are people that will be better than you, there will be people worse than you. 
---
"Hurr Durr it's not fun when I lose" cool, git good then.
---
Imagine if Killers had the power to instantly forfiet the match in exchange for instakilling a select player.
---
The scary thing is it would get used.
---
Auto locking is absolutely BS, somtimes when I go for a lunge it just forces me to do a short swing, which just makes me miss them and carry on the chase a bit longer.
---
literally the most annoying build in the game to go against and yet almost every freddy runs it every time i face against them so i always just say fuck it and disconnect
---
I love the angry as fuk meme
---
That mask is wild
---
Basically taking away part of her mind gaming ability, what she has is already a pretty easy tell
---
Its happening to me lately... maybe the rank reset?
---
I mean the main problem is still there: being forced to use a perk to semi-counter her because she doesn't give feedback of any kind (except when vaulting now).
---
Despite 90% of the dcs being intentional, we can start by punishing those that dc with the leave match button. Yes, people will start force closing their game but that's more time consuming, so they might not do it.
---
I haven't had lag issues since I turned them off and it's made the games a lot smoother. Other issues would be playing off an external hard drive instead of internal hard drive or just restarting the console to close out all running background apps. Turning off captures is my best advice though
---
I think that challenge is bugged. I got 3/6 by using a green medkit.
---
Wrong. The fact that this is upvoted and the guy suggesting you "play the game properly" is being downvoted says a ton about the kind of toxic mentality of people on this sub and in this game.
---
Newsflash: This is a part of the game. If you don't like it, just do everyone a favour and leave and go back to Animal Crossing. Or voice your opinion to the devs. Don't ruin the game because you don't like how the game is.
---
You people are objectively wrong to act this way.
---
Thats the main point of the joke, the nerf didnt affect the main issues which many survivors complain about
---
Dude did you even read his post lmao. What are you on about
---
Cringe
---
I want the cosmetics but I don't want to grind "that" much. It's okay to grind, but in addition that level 3 and level 4 will be hard to nearly impossible ... I'm not willed to grind and need 10 matches to maybe get 1 challenge
---
Honestly they should just give everyone legacy now that exclusives don't matter for people that aren't Fog whatevers
---
Some shards on her body glow but at a distance you can't tell if she's phasing and on some outfits don't even show those glowing shards
---
It's not that old if exhaustion exists
---
Did you grab any other during the trial? If you die with one on your hands it counts as depleted and sums for the challenge
---
Yo buddy hate to break it to you but there's only one loser here who's trying to "pick a fight" and it ain't scott
---
Any idea what button to use for the skill check with a controller on PC? I swear it‚Äôs different from the gens..
---
I think a popular streamer recently received a short ban for doing this.
---
i mean streamers are mostly assholes tbh, one time i played with 0 perk and addon ghostface and i was called sweaty killer and that i have small dick lol.
---
I wouldn't mind if you didn't get XP after 10 minutes, and also got XP from doing things instead of literally only gametime.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt pay attention in chases against her, probably also used to just going brain dead against other killers and running god loops
---
I bought the game so I could get enjoyment out of it. why would I keep playing if I‚Äôm not having fun? because my team might lose a precious pip?
---
Choose between noed and two moris, its testing you. Seeing what you'll pick.
---
Ochido school of editing i see
---
It's capped at 500 :(
---
You should be able to map the controller buttons in the game settings to be what you'd like
---
It's fun against killers with low IQ. Lol
---
I wouldn't of fallen for that as there is nothing over there and there is no way you had time to move there and start healing.
---
Never played another game where disconnecting was justified by the community, DBD is really unique.
---
Says the person literally crying blood over a fucking video game fucking pathetic
---
You're not committing enough then, any survivor can be caught
---
What's a forever Freddy?
---
The galaxy brain play is to DC when someone ELSE is the first survivor downed.
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty Cringey when Tru3ta1ent says that there‚Äôs a hive mind mentality in this community and that people like being a ‚Äúsheep‚Äù(as a metaphor) and that people like having their opinions validated (which is partially true although not everyone who thinks differently than him is simply forming that opinion because of others). And then some parts of his Community also do the same thing.
---
That's what I'm saying: Feel free to uninstall the game if you don't like it. 
---
But by queuing into a lobby and starting a game, you are implicitly agreeing to participate. Leaving because it's not the killer you want to play against is not your prerogative.
---
I mean people are asshole in this game anyway. I know alot of streamers that are perfectly fine  ( small streamers im not taling about the big ones). But because of confirmation bias you see the fact that an asshole also happens to be a streamer as the truh. Anyway what im saying is that being mean to someone just becuese of a hobby or job prospect or whatever they chose is realy shitty
---
Me over here tapping Gens like it's 2017
---
Heavily inspired
---
Nah, only the idiots get banned.
---
You DC x number of times: your GPU gets sent a highly complicated equation that makes it overheat and your PC catches on fire.
---
I've done it in two matches with farmacy haha
---
Just Myers bitchass
---
Silly Hag.
---
Should have seen the scratch marks going in the opposite direction.
---
Unless they didn't want to tunnel.
---
Yep sure is, and I hate it. Simple as that lmao
---
Really? Again?!
---
Some did, some didn‚Äôt.
---
survivors who leave don‚Äôt leave because of the killer. I could care less what killer I‚Äôm playing against. but killers have so many things they can do that just make the game completely unfair/unfun. people who use forever Freddy know what they‚Äôre doing. they know that the survivors aren‚Äôt going to have fun. so why would I sit there and let the killer hold the game hostage when I can re q and just have fun the next game. stop being a fucking dork and realize it‚Äôs a video game.
---
The lag kind
---
Even if you don‚Äôt see any indication of phasing at that point it‚Äôs knowing how a killer moves. Which requires skill, most people who complain about her don‚Äôt play killer, which makes it hard for them to understand how to mindgame her.
---
5 perks?
---
I miss Hex Skill Checks like 80% of the time, but I miss all regular Great Skill Checks like 20% of the time. I don't get it! FML. I am confusion! üíÄ
---
Tunneling is when the killer enters a match
---
I was starting dbdl at this moment. My 360 were more like kindergarten jukes. I post it for fun
---
It‚Äôs much easier though. Forces the chase to stay longer and you can only do it a limited amount of times
---
Your flair seems fitting but I've had those games, especially when there is teamwork involved that I have not been able to catch a single Dwight even with the brutal strength perk combos. It's been awhile but it's happened to me.
---
Console 360
---
Im a trapper main
---
Drop twitch link in post game chat.
---
I play both sides but I can't mind game her. and I also run iron will but still get caught by her
---
&gt; they know that the survivors aren‚Äôt going to have fun
---
This is where you're wrong. I have fun against every killer I play against. I'm not going to tell you that you do, but you don't get to tell me that EVERYONE feels the same way you do. You're wrong here.
---
I think you need to realize it's a video game. A team-oriented game. If you want to play like you are entitled to ruin the game for everyone else, go play LOL.
---
Same happened with me and the pig
---
Drop 15 pallets, 3 games in a row all pallets dropped in First 2mins
---
Disturb 30 crows amazing
---
Damn that's sweet, I'll have to try it then! Is this xbox one you are on too?
---
you = neckbeard
---
PS4
---
Spirit's hair looks blurry on the load out screen. In game, her hair gets in the way while phasing and a little while just walking around (you can see her hair in first person getting "in her face".
---
I would dc too. spirit? I don't know her. also using an ugly outfit that has 0 chance for them to know if you are phasing or not. and let's not speak about the perks nor i care
---
It‚Äôs usually too late before you can even do that if the others are competent.
---
Damn son, glad I ain't there yet
---
More like boob shank
---
If they are not getting views maybe its because they content isnt good... Have you thought od that?
---
destroy portals I must
---
i pay attention to my ESC -&gt; leave match -&gt; yes. that's why I pay attention to.
---
If you have to insult people to make your point, kindly realize that you have an unjustifiable point. 
---
You have my condolences on your inability to communicate with respect.
---
Mess with the hook, you get the claws
---
Download qooapp from the Google play store and get dbd on there
---
Must. Make. Squishy noises.
---
PS4 visual bug  
---
ghostface classic  chest piece blocks half the screen with the sleeve
---
She might‚Äôve thought they jumped a fence or something...Though after arriving, if they were semi-pro they would‚Äôve realized there wasn‚Äôt anything there. As for me, I‚Äôll easily get fooled once in a match by Diversion, then realize they have it. If I get fooled again it‚Äôs on me.
---
no this is just getting old and I can tell you‚Äôre a neck beard. you probably ask your wife‚Äôs boyfriend if you can use the internet to respond to me.
---
And you have no idea what you're talking about. Stop trying to sound relevant bud you're making me cringe . 
---
So many deluded ppl here who think they're mastermind gods with spirit because they abuse broken addons on her and actually defend them. you're gonna be so sad when she actually takes a brain to play bud
---
No he won‚Äôt LOL trust me pal. It‚Äôs not a common thing that has him DCing every other match.
---
This is such a drastic oversimplification
---
No. That's exactly where the killer should be. Based on the new matchmaking changes. SWF groups will search for a killer who matches their highest ranked survivors. Gradually matching down from there if needed.
---
You are now blocked for uncivil behaviour. I would suggest in the future if you want to have your opinion heard and for people to take you seriously, that you communicate with respect - as this is not an effective method of communication in the real world.
---
 My hope for you is that you are able to learn this lesson.
---
Learning loops is the most important thing to do if you're a survivor. It's about running around and trying to get as much time out of every pallet as possible. Unless you really have to dont use a pallet and try to never use a pallet if you're gonna get hit anyway, not only does it waste the pallet but it'll use up some of the speed boost you get from being hit. 
---
For perks you can really run whatever you want and still be successful as survivor because they arent as perk reliant as killers but I can list some good perks you can use.
---
Dead Hard (David King) - Gives you a short dash and makes you immune to hits during it. It's usually best to just use it for distance to get to a pallet or window.
---
Alert (Feng Min) - Anytime the killer breaks a pallet or hits a gen you'll see their aura in pink for 4 seconds. This can help you to know when someone is being chased and where the killer is.
---
Iron Grip and Calm Spirit (Jake Park) - these two are the strongest stealth perks. Iron Grip makes you 100% quiet when injured. Calm Spirit stops screaming from hits, Doctor, Clown and one of the new Nurse addons. CS is more situational but can still be fun for ultimate stealth.
---
Borrowed Time (Bill) and We'll Make It - These are your unhook perks. BT almost guarantees that the person you unlock will get away safely and We'll Make it helps you easily full heal them after. You can run one or both if you really want.
---
Like I said before perks are mostly optional on survivor so just experiment with whatever sounds fun until you find the build that works for you and what you enjoy.
---
Including me and the way bEHAVIOR designed his Kit is still weak. Tru3 made him work simply because of his Perks
---
so how do they camp without camping ?
---
ok boomer
---
thats... literally the point of her power
---
Yeah at that point I just sacrifice myself to them to end the match. The extra 15mins of BS is not worth the measly points or pips. If I get slugged I just dc in those situations. I'm not being held hostage because that doctor wants to sweat it out.
---
Join the discord, play in 4SWF and make sure someone‚Äôs taking small game. It‚Äôs so easy to get through and shit on if you‚Äôre coordinated.
---
It destroys her because they threw 2 long ass cooldowns on the same power for a killer who *moves slower than survivors*. Without her blinks, fucking *Leatherface* has better map control. 
---
And if she hasn‚Äôt been absolutely giganerfed, why has she effectively disappeared from red ranks? Bc she barely ever shows up at red rank anymore.
---
doesn‚Äôt work like that chief
---
Then dont play Demogorgon
---
Billy is already a deadly killer with his chainsaw, yet he still brought Hunted Grounds and Noed.
---
Sure but switching targets is a thing and unlike ghostface his tier 3 works with all survivors. So even if I get away from that particular chase, any altruistic players go down as well. (Snowballing)
---
41 minutes? Everyone who didn‚Äôt DC, including the killer, lost that match.
---
People have been uploading videos where Nurse chases survivors the equivalent of 2 generators where the survivor is doing nothing more than holding W and shift. 
---
There‚Äôs too much forgiveness against Nurse. You can make way too many mistakes against her and go unpunished now.
---
Sunday, dev stream monday with announcment of ptb tuesday
---
üÖ±Ô∏èAVID are you stupid?
---
(it was Dave in that chat)
---
I just got the game for PC and I have been having tons of issues disconnecting mid game. I have finished maps and after being sacrificed it says I dc'd and get no blood points. I've been disconnected in the middle of a game and it will say me and the killer dc'd. I've also had issues where it says error in updating rank and I get no bp, no rank, and kicked to start screen. 
---
I've had this game on ps4 and never had these issues. I thought I would be fun to be able to play on mouse and keyboard but have had nothing but connection issues so far.
---
Yeah, they‚Äôre all active at once unless it‚Äôs locking the next one behind it.
---
then wait til late game to place your portals
---
Then he‚Äôll start stalking other people, wasting a lot of time where he could just hit you. A lot of pallets would still be there too since he isn‚Äôt aiming to kill, but to get tier 3.
---
Before though she was too forgiving for poor blinks for the killer. You could have like 5 blinks and use each one to get closer and closer to the survivor.
---
Big doubt.
---
Its toxic on the killer part to not come to the gates to receive your teabagging
---
On Xbox and nah unfortunately, don't remember the name.
---
 New Killer idea: Kyle. Power: Drywall Punch; you can hit survivors on the other side of a pallet and through walls. Perks: Mee-Maw: memories of your mother lecturing your toxic masculinity infuriate you. Punching a generator 60 seconds after chasing a survivor regresses it instantly by 10% Totinos Pizza Rolls: Your prized food of choice. Survivors within 14 meters of any totems hex or otherwise will have their auras revealed to you Monster Energy: Punching a survivor inflicts the broken status effect for 60 seconds and makes their blood trail look green for 30 seconds
---
Or I just don't delete my own comments.   
---
^and ^the ^joke ^wasnt ^funny
---
And everyone agrees that was OP and needed to go.  Base Nurse was not 5 blinks. Base Nurse was not unbalanced
---
I'm not placing anything.
---
That's awesome, I enjoy me some trapper. Especially putting traps around common loops or the shack and then they walk into it. My favorite traps are the random ones they never expect and it ending up working.
---
Suppose so. I dunno I still see nurse as being an extremely high skill killer that most people aren‚Äôt going to do well with
---
Every Autohaven map ever
---
I can‚Äôt wait for this to come out months after for the switch version since they don‚Äôt care to update it now.
---
I literally never do
---
I do like the format though and there was a time where three rank ones could group with a 20 and expect to get matched against a rank ten killer. I even had a game against three ones and an eighteen while was a fourteen due to the reset. Luckily it wasn't a stomp because I normally play red anyway but that system was unfair to anyone who actually placed at that level.
---
The baby dweight
---
Would you consider Detective's Hunch now that it's buffed?
---
Mirror myres is so fun to play
---
xqcS
---
Yeah right. I mean, good way of approaching new challenges. I don't know them, better fuck off.
---
My outfit? Just get away from her when i stand still, ez.
---
My perks? OK sorry, next time i'll run the mighty monstrus shrine and iron grasp combo against the high  rank survivors always running DS DH and bt, feelslegit
---
I am a red rank Nurse main. And the addon rework was inconsequential. It didn‚Äôt hurt me since I never used her addons for the very reason BHVR gave behind reworking all her addons. 
---
But that basekit nerf was a bridge way too far. Her power was artificially hindered when it wasn‚Äôt problematic to begin with.
---
Due to the lack of relevance, I'm going with dense
---
I have never seen a window in that fence.
---
We need a chapter for [Rubber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_(2010_film))
---
I had one game where I had to DC as Plague. I was chasing a Dwight who was part of a three man swf, they were customized the same and all with flashlights, I had killed the other survivor and just downed Dwight and he DCs on my shoulder, getting me gitched into a rock. The thing is, it still counted him as on my shoulder but I couldn't drop him, meaning I couldn't use vile purge. So his teammates sit there T-bagging and blinding me for like three minutes so I just leave because there was nothing I could do and I didn't want to give them free boldness points.
---
This happened to me too lol.
---
The bar was never counting down.
---
Hex: Final Blind: when the gens are powered, the progress bar is obscured for the remainder of the match. When the hidden bar reaches 25% countdown, any remaining survivors are instantly sacrificed.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had some survivors click their flashlight at me or tbag and run straight to an infinite or god loop. For those just leave them alone, while they‚Äôre doing that they‚Äôre not working on gens so just let them waste their time.
---
I always run "no mither" and "this isn't happening", "stake out" and "resilience". Best anti ruin build. Worst build in general tho. You could probably add deadhard in there somewhere.
---
I believe hag is already connected to voodoo as well as Native American folklore
---
ew
---
Because BHVR, thats literally the only answer I can give
---
Thanks, I forgot how to explain it
---
Tome 5 and 6
---
Sometimes when I'm feeling like the games going too fast I only 99% gens as survivor, hoping the killer will kick it so I can get more objective points
---
This generally results in a team mate finishing it 0.1 seconds later
---
I tried
---
We had shattered bloodline, now Cursed Legacy. 
---
What's next, Messed up Ancestry?
---
Oh boo hoo cant use my broken add ons anymore
---
True
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Ignore her, she drinks too much.
---
as I said I don't care if you run stridor on spirit but giving them an unescapable challenge. I won't blame them for dcing. sure just run away when I stand still 6Head. the only mind game I would do I stand still and dc.
---
This was 1 month after sabo nerf, its still about 1/2 of the game's lifespan
---
Wow hahaha so funny you know what would make it even more funny? If you said the same jokes with the same garbage formatted 30 times over trust me it would be hilariousüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yup. Pretty much. But we only had 2 more gens to go and I was remaining optimistic. Never again. 
---
I used to time all of my vs Freddy matches with his dumb add-ons. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that DCing saves me a lot of time and frustration. Unless you are a SWF lobby, with people who know how to loop well, yeah, no. Lol
---
I dont think she deserved a nerf at all. And yes, im a survivor main.
---
I can‚Äôt resist
---
See I'm pretty sure what actually happened is someone used a perk you misguidedly hate in an attempt to save the final survivor left in the game, knowing how close he was to the open exit gate. Just because it failed doesn't mean she was "selfishly farming". If she were just farming she would have healed up then escaped, because dying costs more bloodpoints than healing gains. Instead she healed up and risked losing a significant junk of BP to try and help the last guy.
---
Same
---
You can do that?! I know who I'm gonna start playing now!
---
Or you can crouch walk to not activate her traps
---
Yeah, it's very enjoyable having everything just fall into place.
---
Are you for real?
---
If that's the case then thank you for the info, I'll try it next time I'll hop on DBD
---
Where do you see a T-Bag?
---
We're still on tome 1 bud
---
‚ÄúBut then you remember you have noed on a fucking Myers with T3 ready to pop.‚Äù
---
When I see that survivor, I just face a wall and start hitting it for giggles and then move on. Makes me not take the game as seriously.
---
Lol you can on xbox! Yeah you could run noed and insidious and wait for them lol. Also bitter murmurs so you can see if they go to the other exit gate
---
I am totally with ya :) having those little extra goals makes it fun even if you get totally stomped haha
---
I didnt know babies could use reddit.
---
Yeah if I see someone T bagging I let them hang.  They know exactly when they did.
---
 And now that I have witnessed at 1st hand that is going to go double for anyone that shows the killer where your teammates are after that 1 last night anyone like that is getting it back
---
I have 0 experience with the ps4 but I've seen a lot of posts saying it seems like a pretty toxic experience. I'm on pc and like 1/4 matches I'll have a guy being a dick in the postgame chat. It's even rarer to see somebody being truly toxic in game, like facecamping while nodding or survivor's sandbagging others on purpose.
---
If you‚Äôve memorized the layouts, you‚Äôd have to be decently pro. Not everyone has done that, especially when maps change things around each game. That being said, this game was while I was rank 5 I believe.
---
the more you know. keep your salt jar away :)
---
We literally haven't even seen it yet.
---
You do know that my original comment was made over 20 hours ago, when the comment I replied to didn't have any upvotes right?
---
Lately I‚Äôve been crouching but her traps have still been activating. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going.
---
Reminds me of something that Tru3 said, "why do they do this? Every time they do a semi-decent play they just gotta teabag".
---
I mean it‚Äôs Rank 16 and it‚Äôs obviously a baby huntress
---
That's not what I mean. They don't camp, but they place traps all around me.
---
the buff she deserves: .
---
Name checks out
---
As a console player you swung that wayyy wide
---
this would so good and scary at end-game
---
You‚Äôve somewhat misunderstood how an increase in speed translates to decrease in time taken.
---
Using just Resilience‚Äôs 9% speed increase, assuming one survivor and no great skill checks or toolboxes, the total time taken to repair would be 80/1.09 = ~73.4s (idk where you got that 120s figure from).
---
It gets tricker when you include the innate speed debuff from cooperative repairs, which is -10% base speed per extra survivor, which is offset to 99/96/91% for 2/3/4 survivors respectively when Prove Thyself is in use.
---
Assuming all 4 survivors are on one generator all using an Engineer‚Äôs Toolbox with Swivels and Clean Rag and all using Resilience we would get a total speed of 0.91 x 1.5 = 1.365 c/s per survivor, for a total of 5.46 c/s which would complete a generator in ~14.65s. 
---
I‚Äôm too tired and lazy to do the calculation for 3 and 2 survivors (plus I‚Äôm in a bit of pain atm) but hopefully you get the general idea. I think.
---
I've never had that issue. Which platform?
---
Only time lightborn is useful.
---
*Laughs even harder in Iridescent Button*
---
And that changes... What exactly?
---
If i see a strong looping survivor, i don't pay much attention to them, I will chase everyone else, and while they're wasting pallets the good guy won't have options to loop me with, then is where i strike.
---
I feel like people are reading this wrong. He wants his teammates to stop destroying the portals lol
---
I thought they fixed th..
---
Never mind.
---
Just make it like other games and add the timer on after it happens a couple times. If your internet drops that often you should know better than to try and play online games with it at that point
---
thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You know it says that all of only 24 years old and I am already at the point where if I see the OK Boomer mean I automatically ignore the person and walk away because I know that nothing I say is going to be even remotely listen to and they are unwilling to have a civil discussion that's all that mean does is show a blatant ignorance toward others.
---
Exactly, thank you
---
This. I encounter a true Forever Freddy maybe once a week.
---
Shhhhh
---
Yeah, unless they are place on a gate/close to one, just leave them...
---
In that situation just dont drop the pallet without also hitting your sprint button. Never just drop the pallet while injured, also be using sprint as well.
---
Huh, interesting. Thanks for the details
---
I know that, Billy and Freddy will be the next most used killers..but at least they are not Spirit.
---
Dbd is not challenging at all, its just a matter of time before you learn everything. Spirit is not a challenging killer, it's just a coin flip, nothing more than that..which is why i'm fine with the nerfs.
---
If they dont want people complaining, they should buff weaker killers and stop nerfing everything else
---
I sent this to my 4 man dbd party while in lobby, it's so ridiculous it's funny. For a solid 30 seconds all you could hear was laughing, it hit us all in just the right way, so thank you for that.
---
what the fuck is wrong with this comment thread?
---
Btw you're infringing on subreddit rule #3 by shaming another player by using the username and literally using the word "shame" lol.
---
You're getting increasingly more desperate with every posts to show your aggression like it means shit over the internet, you're seething with rage over my reddit history you absolute fucking loser
---
I like your style, stick to it! Only thing I would tweak is the length of her kitana probably and make it a lil bit longer. Keep drawing, and fuck whoever said it looked like a toddler drew it btw. Everyone starts at different stages and goes at their own speed, keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and post more because I‚Äôd personally love to see your art style grow :) 10/10 good job

It was kind of crazy how big the blood webs were.
---
Like there'd be something to buy on nearly every spot so they took 100k at level 50, and it only gave 1 perk.
---
It was kind of cool though, because it meant having all or ideal perks meant something.
---
People use to be very surprised at nurses calling on Billy, etc. Now, having every perk or great perks seems to be the baseline.
---
Every killer has an m1..perhaps you are asking which are the strongest killers? Currently Billy, Freddy and Spirit
---
Hes talking about his teammates destroying them, not him as killer.
---
Only thing I agree with was the prayer beads nerf. It was nice having a killer you cant completely abuse windows againt. (e.g. ks)
---
I was a bit lucky, I bring one in the match and got save my second with pharmacy and got both matches a brown one out of another box
---
Sorry for the unclearly haha
---
If hitting a great skillcheck in this scenario is harder than hitting a good one then I dont know what to tell you
---
Whats the difference lmao
---
...which would be why they got rid of it and won‚Äôt do it again?
---
I don‚Äôt understand your point.  How is ‚ÄúThey did something in the past and eventually removed it‚Äù somehow evidence *against* ‚ÄúThey said they won‚Äôt do it in the future‚Äù?
---
yep I hate tombstome
---
I just said something that is clearly not serious and people took it seriously.
---
I agree. I'm constantly telling my duo partner to stop cleansing portals near completed gens or hooks in the middle of a deadzone.
---
They're about as good at listening as some of the people in this thread are at reading :P
---
Perfect description of the game when BPS was a brown offering
---
You do know the hag only has 10 portals and those can be destroyed with a flashlight
---
If you look back at a lot of big time streamers at one point they had TTV in their IGN's. I know it's a meme at this point but people going after them for this is pretty petty IMO.
---
go into ps4 settings and choose to redownload all licenses. its very quick

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need friends they disappoint me‚Äù

Ps4
---
Survivor full stop. Idk why people think solo survivor is hard.
---
Is that a known fix?
---
No. That's not how this works. That rule is against shaming players by sharing screenshots or videos without censoring the names of other people, talking to someone and calling them by their name (or /u/ ) and disagreeing with what they posted publicy themselves is not against any rule. Also if you think someone broke a rule use the report function instead of trying to shame people yourself.
---
They are both old tbf
---
Just so you know I wasn‚Äôt trying to guilt you, I don‚Äôt really like the use of OP perks to begin with. not just NOED
---
Yes xbox one used to run captures and had ocassional lag because im also on wifi not ethernet. If you can use ethernet instead of wifi it should work better but still captures was giving me lag issues and now my games run smooth with captures turned off. Try and let me know if you think it works any better
---
They could use similar sounds to dismantling totems
---
I play hag, and she is my 3rd favourite killer. Most of the times I don't even bother putting traps by the hooked survivor, because those traps should use it to cover the whole map, should not use to camp the survivor from  distance. I don't like camping in general let alone "distance camping". That's why it disgusts me when a hag player puts more than 1 trap by the hooked survivor. They are wasting their power just to camp the hook. (Hell I've even seen some of them putting 5+ traps and yet still waiting by the hook when there is 2-3 gens to do.)
---
Also I didn't get what you mean by "it's too day" and what would it change when I play her myself. Did you get what I am complaining about in the first place?
---
Seriously hags, you only need to put one trap at a hook
---
Literally just have it in case of assholes xD
---
I can hit greats consistency and I did it too much with the med kit challenge lmao
---
I would like to see every change the game until now. Like a "Dead by Daylight evolution"

Wait, tell me again what does the iri mixtape do? Also the only good addons are power lasting more and faster power recovery

We kinda already have this. It's basically the equivalent of facecamping bubba/billy and the killer virtually guarantees he loses.

The player wasn‚Äôt being rude at all they just were a lot better than me.

Hello 5 tickets to autohaven please

I am super here for Survivor and Killer versions of the same character. Hope to see it happen someday! :)

LOL I hope one day your buddy and the people trying to read this thread will understand. Until then we'll just have to keep crouch walking away from the last gen every 20 seconds
---
I have lots of fun losing against ghostfaces who get good jumpscares on me but also don‚Äôt tunnel or camp, instant ‚Äúgg wp‚Äù from me even if I died
---
I don't think it's a matter of trying to push someone down because of circumstances that they cannot do much to change.
---
But if I had awful Internet, I wouldn't play a game like this, because not only would it be frustrating to deal with constant disconnects ruining my fun, it would also create a bad experience for the other four people playing. With all the games that exist out there, I'm pretty sure I could find something else to occupy my time without this same kind of baggage.

Awkward Zombie, probably. [She draws a lot of SSB stuff.](http://www.awkwardzombie.com/)

How?

You really haven‚Äôt been playing long, have you, pal.

Unless it's ghostface, then absolutely reveal that mammer jammer so he knows you're a gangster.
---
Then don‚Äôt fucking tunnel.
---
That‚Äôs why I camp. Use a flashlight on me once, you‚Äôre getting camped and tunneled. Fuck y‚Äôall.
---
What happens if your game crashes and you're disconnected from the lobby? Do you still get banned or is it like you have to physically go and quit the match in the middle of it?
---
Fellow unit

I‚Äôve been told BHVR is able to tell the difference on their end.

Did you try looking miserable? I sometimes face the wall and attack it a few times.

No. That would be too easy.

So (part of) the previous generation decided to badly stereotype the next generation then (part of) the next generation decided to... badly stereotype them. Should just break the cycle, not repeat it. Ignorance doesn't helps anyone.

*Ahem*

Ok boomer.

It's already easy.

It's also already tedious as fuck.

We can only hope.

As a survivor main I truely love mori spams. It is the funniest thing ever to me. Id rather be mori spammed than just get mori'd lol. When Ghostface mori spams it looks like he's banging the survivor. When i get mori spammed i crawl in different directions instead of just standing in one spot, makes it more hilarious if you get a 360 mori spam
---
Reddit is a damn trip sometimes.
---
As the killer sacrifices people you get credit
---
This is true. I'm still a fan of the system though, because it pushes players to care about more advanced aspects of the game, that they might not otherwise consider. Stagnation in gameplay is a big downside for a game like DbD, and the tomes give more variation from match to match.
---
I didn't get it from the Google play store I sideloaded it off the official website That's why I was skeptical at first
---
Yeah the only person I can watch anymore is No0b3. Genuinely good vibes in his vids. I tried watching Tru3ta1ent last night, and the very first match as he's loading in he says "wonder how bad I'll get gen rushed this game. My record is 2 minutes and 30 seconds." I instantly said fuck this and turned it off LOL
---
Even Azralynn (lesser known streamer?) has become insufferable for me lately. I've seen her being extremely passive aggressive to her viewers (someone told her to check out The Rift and she's like "No I already told you I don't give a fuck about it") and the people she's playing with in her discord. In one round a teammate got downed and someone said they were gonna hide in a locker to avoid BBQ, and she said something along the lines of "Nope he has a mori, you're wasting time" and rolled her eyes on facecam. It was pretty uncomfortable because the guy was clearly new too. 
---
She also played a round and did 2 gens without seeing the killer. Then she checks the basement for the chest and the wraith shows up and downs her and she says "don't care, reporting this guy for afk'ing" like wtf who does that
---
Plenty of online games implement this idea of "multiple leaves = a queue penalty" because it affects people that leave the game on purpose more than the people that know they can't connect to the game because the people that know they don't have a good enough connection to play it don't play it
---
Perks are helpful, but you can not rely on them. Information perks and efficiency perks are the ones I use mainly because information allows to make more decisive and concrete decisions and efficiency for repairing gens faster, healing faster, or doing things simulataneously to get benefit.
---
I do understand how good exhaustion perks can be and they can prolong a chase between a down and another minute. However, I notice tons of survivors form bad habits using them and I think it's better to just know how to position yourself and run the killer without them then start incorparating them into the game.
---
Well damn, I wish the pallet stun one worked as killer.
---
First of all exclusive skins were free codes, people chose to pay for them so it‚Äôs their fault. They never intended to make profit or money as that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt sell them at a price. The event skins were easy to get, however many people lost them. The game and company were smaller when people were losing legacies, it‚Äôs hard to give shit back to people. Most got BP.
---
Because you chose to get into a chase against the rancor player, you knew she had rancor.
---
Dude I remember you would get like 10 streamers before level 15.
---
When I see survivors do this it's always a DS survivor that thinks I'm gullible. I just down them then force the entire team to come for the unhook. Quite often do I get DCs for the DS survivor if I don't pick them up lmao
---
Uses NOED. Doesn‚Äôt count. Downvote me
---
This. üëç
---
Rancor is fair relax, it‚Äôs a waste of a slot.
---
The hat makes him look so sad and confused
---
Why do they need 3 people running it holy shot they‚Äôre bad
---
Because justice was served.
---
And if you pop enough adderol, Nurse

I don‚Äôt think it was that style. I remember one comic was everyone arguing about how many gods there were 3, 2, 1, 0, then that Goddess from Kid Icarus walks in.

It's True! My Friend Dwight was a gay furry for 13 years! But after a few trails with Doctor Carter he's been doing great for 6 months now!

Red Paint Brush + Jump Rope, Dying Light, Thrilling Tremors + PGTW.

Looping the killer for 5 gens then getting facecamped

It‚Äôs harder to find games at certain times of day and your rank can affect your queue times too. Just have some other thing you are also doing between matches. Homework, drawing etc whatever.

Wholesome Killers best killers
---
I would have saved the mori for the sabbo tbh, but do what you gotta do
---
honestly i hate people that advertise their stream in this game or their gambling sites back when i played csgo. but at the same time i cant stop myself from logging into their stream to see their reaction to my plays and to also watch out for my mistakes.
---
last time some streamer blinded me while breaking a pallet and just ran past me while i was blind like 3 times and it worked every time. that juke doesnt work on me now because i watched the stream.
---
Freddy is quickly climbing the ranks
---
Don‚Äôt see the correlation
---
ok, killer get whole outfits, survivor get a new head here and there,

Maybe a jacket or 2

Uh what?

It's the latest update on their Twitter, finally drops the chapter name :)

---
It‚Äôs funny that lore wise, Claudette is the nicest, smartest, and most caring person. The people that play her on the other hand...
---
As for Meg, it‚Äôs basically a dice roll on whether it‚Äôs a toxic little shit that‚Äôll throw the game and sandbag/farm teammates, they‚Äôre an Ochido wannabe, antagonize the killer all game and never do gens. If they win, ‚Äúgg ez baby killer,‚Äù and if they get killed first, ‚Äúyou fucking tunneling piece of shit kys.‚Äù
---
Hes becoming a really nasty killer with all the stuff you can do with him. Hes top tier now.
---
This would actually piss me off. I dont even mind my dweard or my chuckles being accessible to anyone, i can get behind the reasoning. But i grinded the fuck out of this game back in 2016 to get those legacies; if they became accessoble again i'd legit have a stroke. I know this sounds greedy, and its a lot less imoressive now given how many people just modded it in, but still, i. worked for those. 
---
I wouldnt mind a legacy 2.0 though, that anyone currently prestiged or something could get. Legacy bht with different colouring.
---
The right way to go about it tbh
---
Found the SM Myers main
---
This has to be a fake video because according to this sub killers can NEVER be toxic /s
---
Good work
---
Thanks! I'm so excited! It's so cool that we (ultra probably) are going to get a relative of the Spirit :))
---
Oh yeah for sure, just got a bit confused cause I already considered him a top tier killer even without this weird shit u can do with him
---
I dont think so because that's not an interrupt. You're just picking them up like you downed them.
---
This is so sad :(
---
Isn‚Äôt spirit bugged rn so you usually hear the vacuum even in terror radius?
---
then it's the same speed than being healed by an other survivor. 16s
---
No. That one is mainly black with red trim. The one I'm looking for is fully black jacket and fully red undershirt
---
I dont really get the correlation between hate of furries and dbd
---
Definitely post an update! I wanna be tagged in it so I can see but tbh I‚Äôm not sure if tagging is a thing on here. I only joined a little while ago to post my own art actually üòÇ
---
Of course there‚Äôs a comment like this
---
If they‚Äôre sandbagging or being a little shit to the killer, I‚Äôm not helping them. I‚Äôm a killer main first and foremost, so I know the pain of survivor players being shitty. If the meg, blendette, or Nea are trying to be Ochido wannabes, well, they get the hook and can stay on it.
---
That's my main meg I have XD
---
Same here, it just seems to make more sense. But then I keep seeing people suggesting that he might be a survivor and all I can imagine is poor Rin being tea-bagged at the exit gates by her father.
---
Nah Ghostface is way closer to the Nea of killers, oh wait..
---
Dude if you scroll down this has been posted a million times, and you didnt even crop it lol

I have found out how to fix this manually. In C:\\Users\\Name\\AppData\\Local\\DeadByDaylight\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor there is a file called Input.ini. In this file Killers are known as Slashers and Survivors are known as Campers (lol) and if you can locate which action you're looking to rebind use  [https://wiki.unrealengine.com/List\_of\_Key/Gamepad\_Input\_Names](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/List_of_Key/Gamepad_Input_Names) to find the name of the key. For example changing struggle to mouse wheel down would be finding "ActionName="Mash\_Camper",Key=SpaceBar" and changing it to "ActionName="Mash\_Camper",Key=MouseScrollDown"
---
Nope, unless they changed it, it is a hostage situation. The bar does not go down at a normal rate.
---
That‚Äôs the point. I wanted people to know it‚Äôs not my meme. I just saw this on a subreddit so
---
Yessir, for a good long minute there, too.
---
I don't care, and I'm not going to waste my time to debate with you on something that will not happen.
---
Wish you could change the moonlight in custom matches.
---
My spine chill went off so i hid in a closet real quick. A Sabo jake was doing a hook next to me, the killer hit him and he pointed at my closet twice before being hooked. I got out of the locker pointed at him and walked off to my gen. He killed himself on first hook.
---
Honest question:  what precisely does 'toxic' mean in the context of DBD?  Because I'm watching a YouTube series about toxic killers, but it pretty much just seems to be a good player using good killer perks and saying 'gg' at the end.
---
Oh that's not as bad as;
---
Surv A is hooked, Surv B went for the unhook with me but got on the chase, so while I go to unhook Surv A, Surv B seems to think the best direction to lead the killer in is directly to the hook. 
---
I genuinely don't get. Running on a survivor that's working on a gen can be dumb, or just dumb luck considering map awareness, but holy shit you can see the hooked Aura dude, run the fuck away from it.
---
All my point was is this is the same pictures that's been posted like 10 times today, one was posted not even 15 minutes ago and its spam at this point lol
---
Omg yes
---
I watched a few of his vids, very informational but I don't think I could watch his vids at 3 am while dozing off lol, I'll keep those for Noob3. Really liked him though but VEERY strenuous videos to make, I support him. Most commentators just shut up and focus on the game when they're tired and fuck up their gameplay, he's snappy even when he's tired and his commentating doesn't dull
---
Not to say it doesn‚Äôt exist but I didn‚Äôt see it. I just woke up to this pic and thought it was funny so

Who? I think you were trying to reply to the other guys about the nurse facecamping correct?

Tbh I wish that spirit didnt hear her own whooshing, I liked prayer beads because it's so silent so I can hear survivors easier.

It was posted 19 minutes ago dude just scroll down lol. I'll even link it if you're gonna say it doesn't exist.

---
There are no infinite loops in the game anymore thanks to bloodlust and window blocker.
---
Fucking lol, I need to try this sometime
---
Where?

Entitled. The most disgusting people on the planet imo are people who are entitled. It's just a game, man they get too into it

Because cute baby dwight is fucking hotüòç

I would if it showed up in the shrine

Did you even read my reply? I said NOT TO SAY IT DOESNT EXIST. I just said I didn‚Äôt see anything this morning in dbd memes cuz I just woke up and scrolled through feed and saw this pic and thought it was funny...

Nice! Ima check it out now

If someone called you a cheater for playing a killer, especially that one, then they were joking, because there's no universe in which that makes sense.
---
It's just a dumb meme that did what dumb memes do, man. It went too far and totally erased the functionality of a word because everyone uses it to be trendy now. And it'll be gone in a couple of months like Ugandan Knuckles and Harambe.
---
&gt; That's why they camp, so they don't have time to hook anyone else because the rest of the team did 3 gens in the time it took for that one player to die and now the match is over because camping is a terrible strategy 
---
My experience on PS4 lately has been I can always find a killer game always within two minutes but any survive with friends game take forever, sometimes to the point we just give up. Solo survivor queue times are quick though.

Its annoying, yes, but not an infinite. You will eventually catch them
---
I‚Äôd be cool if he could mori people inside lockers like he does in the movies.
---
Just brush it off nothing will happen
---
Then you were being accused of camping, which isn't an enjoyable playstyle. It makes sense when all the gens are complete and someone's opening the doors, but it's nothing to do with the trapper. In fact, the Trapper like the Hag is one of the killers best suited to leaving the hook.
---
One ytime a friendly huntress downed a survivor and they immediately dc‚Äôd
---
They don‚Äôt have do be buffed to Spirit or nurse tier just make them as good as like Billy and they‚Äôll be infinitely more competitive
---
back in my day we couldnt choose who we stalked
---
And yet the meme has devolved so that the people that only listen themselves using against anyone that tries to say anything they disagree with
---
I was slugging since it was the last 2 survivors and they knew where the hatch was.
---
Buff both. Both have some of the best cosmetics in the game too so it‚Äôs a shame they‚Äôre not better
---
Except it's not? A big part of the meme at this point is that the perfect response to people complaining about the phrase is just to repeat it.
---
It doesn't shut down meaningful conversation because the people that say it would never have responded otherwise. That's what memes are, it's what they do.
---
/s?
---
I have only one time I got called baby killer it was funny how low people will stoop
---
I've been noticing this at the shack pallet/door a lot against Trapper.  People are abusing the shit out of whatever this is

Oof. If that happened I would let them go. Still injured them, still gives them the stun chance
---
I've been on reddit long enough to know exactly how this works I knew that this would be the responses and the votes.
---
OK boomer
---
Bruh, my family has been threatened, racial slurs, and so much shit it‚Äôs like, ‚Äúcalm tf down it‚Äôs a video game, not real life.‚Äù
---
They Self Cared and then picked the slug (a P3 Dwight who was doing really well) after the Killer walked around the entire map. Killer immediately downs Dwight again and then chases Nancy out of the gate. Of course Nancy has to teabag at the gate as well.
---
Killer then proceeds to Mori Dwight with her Yellow Mori. Fs in chat the good boy didn't deserve it too good for this world.
---
Wow
---
if the survivor gets a genuine disconnect, it wont make a noise. Pressing the leave match button will make that noise, so all 3 survivors did it on purpose.
---
Made me laugh, thanks for this.
---
Also once you hit a healthy survivor with corrupt purge they gain total immunity to damage for 3 seconds. That 3 second immunity is also reset everytime a projectile from the same stream of corrupt hits the survivor. So if you use corrupt twice in a row without waiting the puke will hit the survivor but it won't do anything.
---
So on paper you could potentially get rarer items for a cheaper cost? 
---
I imagine in practice it was more like getting trash items for 8k bp
---
This is how freddy will end up getting nerfed lol. Survivors will complain saying hes ‚Äú unfun ‚Äú ‚Äú no counterplay ‚Äú etc. How it all starts. Thank god Freddy wont be getting touched anytime soon.
---
The doctor seems like a furry tbh
---
And no, I wasn't stupid enough to greed for a BT save against a facecamping Bubba. Sadly I was the first one to be downed :&lt;
---
Ghostface is a 90‚Äôs killer though
---
I am really curious how amazing the killer was, to have them all dc like that. Lol
---
Maybe not infinite but definitely some "can take most of the god damn match"
---
Yesterday an Adam did that and after about 2 seconds I realized there was no vault or locker for the loud, then I saw Adam bolting for the Dwight on the hook
---
If you choose to chase there for whatever reason instead of going to gens
---
Pgtw, ruin, brutal strength, bbq
---
How if the perk only works once?
---
I really rate my opinion that memes are actually making people less intelligent
---
I had to check to make sure she wasnt actually running self care cause I'd be shook
---
But then you miss the skill checküíÄ
---
Thank you for taking to time to reply it means a lot because I was crunching numbers all morning and as a little disappointed nobody replied. But moving I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôre in pain I hope you get better.
---
I guess I‚Äôm not understanding the whole thing. I don‚Äôt understand why increasing speed wouldn‚Äôt decrease time taken to complete the Gen.
---
Also I thought Prove Thyself buff to 99% so I thought it would mean 99%/98%/97%. If you don‚Äôt mind explaining how you got 99%/96%/91%.
---
The bottom portion I understand.
---
In the example I made of the Legion game that disconnected 3 of us, it made a noise every single time it kicked one of us. And I‚Äôve seen it do the same in other instances of people being disconnected mid game as well. 
---
So while that may be true, it‚Äôs not completely  reliable right now.
---
Yes I‚Äôve noticed it and he‚Äôs not terrible to play against but if **every fuckin game** is ghost face then its kinda lame...
---
I‚Äôve run across more legion/ghost face players in the last week than the last month and ghost face is okay but legion is toxic and not just bc his frenzy ability.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that people can‚Äôt play these killers and I‚Äôm def not asking for a nerf but if you only play killers that are popular then it makes the game a little less fun for everyone except maybe you... regardless have fun and stay toxic (except you Legion)
---
Do you actually think survivors choose to be chased or are you joking?
---
Hmm... for a dollar, id buy the off brand devour hope if it isnt a hex.
---
they give 2 things people asked for is the collusion and prayer beads. and the bullshit addons but it is not as important when she is using her power.
---
I'm running BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel, and Enduring currently, and using the Swing Chains and Jump Rope add-ons (I had a massive amount of them saved up pre-rework so life for those who have to face me when I play Freddy is going to be miserable for a long long time).
---
BBQ and Pop is pretty much the meta on Freddy because his gen teleporting really makes that combo strong. The other 2 perks you choose to run are really at your discretion though. As far as tips goes, it really comes down to getting good at laying down Dream Snares during the chase, which will come with practice. Have fun! Once you get some reps in with him, you're really gonna like him. He's also a bloodpoint machine, which is a big bonus.
---
Ah, there's no point discussing any further then. You're clearly part of the sounding smart = being smart crowd.
---
honestly as a survivor main I don‚Äôt find him horribly overpowered as spirit was, more just boring/annoying to play against
---
Freddy is balanced fine but I can never win a game against him because the type of people who play Freddy are toxic. Ive never won a game against Freddy because everytime I get tunneled.
---
Known glitch. Has happened twice to me in a year of playing. You can still get totems and run the killer for a short while, I suppose.
---
Flash lighting at pallets doesn't really help the survivor though, if killer is breaking a pallet that's like a 3 second headstart on running away to another loop. I'm torn between thinking it's a sub-optimal play on the survivors part or just straight up BM but either way it tilts me good
---
Since rank reset I‚Äôve had 1 game where the killer didn‚Äôt either camp or tunnel one survivor all game. Literally 1 game in 3 days.
---
I bet these are the people who cry about survivors being toxic and ruining their fun too lmao
---
The portals are useful when you make a build around them. So basically if you make a basement trapper demo, he can snowball people easily
---
Never seen this posted before
---
Then pull out your phone and do something else on there instead of just waiting on a trolls ego be restored
---
Thank you very much! This is exactly what I was looking for
---
Nope the most Extra Bloodpoints is the Gruesome Gateau which Adds a WHOLE 3% extra bloodpoints to a grand total of 103% extra bloodpoints
---
Yeah I realize my mistake now, but its still better to take them out early on because of the fact that he wont be able to use them endgame
---
Legion and Doc don‚Äôt need buffs and both are in okay places so if you don‚Äôt mind explaining **why** you think they need a buff so I can understand a bit better.
---
Im a rank 4 survivor/ rank 9 killer
---
None of the stuff you describe you are describing is a bannable offense.
---
That happens to me whenever someone's on the hook and I'm about to finish last gen. Usually I'll leave it at 99% to give the killer a reason to leave the hook and pop it immediately after rescue just in case they're running Adrenaline, but someone always comes along, finishes it, and condemns the poor guy to death.
---
Ok thanks ;)
---
That could have been me idk had to deal with alot of huntress
---
Docs power is pretty much useless especially at high ranks and legion is just weak in general
---
That‚Äôs so cool
---
yes. the entire point of hatchets is they make you rethink vaulting windows or dropping pallets as huntress can turn the tables and nail you then. unless they were machine gun hatchets you shouldve been watching for her to wind up and kept looping instead of dropping the pallet.
---
I just looked through available cosmetics for her, exclusives, archive cosmetics and store stuff and the closest thing to it is in fact the jacket the comment described. There‚Äôs no outfit for Claudette with a black jacket and fully red undershirt.
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
I don‚Äôt even stream and I do it for the banter
---
She was chasing me hatchet drawn. She had craaaazy addons
---
What doesn't count? The kill?
---
But it‚Äôs not. Making a decision off no information and hoping that it‚Äôs the right choice is not mindgaming, it‚Äôs just guessing. There is very little skill involved for either side, especially when standing still is considered one of her ‚Äúmindgames‚Äù.
---
I have the sudden urge to T bag
---
But how does my hit box being bigger than the whole pallet make any sense at all?
---
Dunno what to say, but "playing the Trapper" isn't "camping" and neither of those things is "slugging."
---
None of this is bannable, but if you're camping you should expect salty messages. If you're not camping, you should still expect salty messages occasionally. Turning off your messages will make your experience better, probably.
---
I think u are using the doc's power wrong if u think it would be same as plague this way
---
People camping pallets so all pallets are gone early in the game, Making people use self-care, make people run around disrupting crows because they want to do it in a single game, make people waste med kits, etc.
---
Sure thing.
---
As I said, cooperative repairs have a cumulative debuff of 10% per extra survivor repairing, so normally repair speed would be 0.9/0.8/0.7 c/s for 2/3/4 survivors respectively.
---
However since this debuff is applied first and is multiplicative an equal magnitude buff wouldn‚Äôt cancel it out, which is what Prove Thyself does on paper at 10% per survivor. So 0.9 c/s + 10% would be 0.9 x 1.1 which is 0.99 c/s or 99% speed. 3 survivors would be 0.8 x 1.2 which is 0.96 c/s and 4 would be 0.7 x 1.3 which is 0.91 c/s.
---
The same principle is true for other interactions affected by a speed buff and debuff at the same time.
---
e.g Sloppy Butcher‚Äôs 20% speed debuff is cancelled out by Leader 3‚Äôs 25% buff because 0.8 x 1.25 = 1.
---
Platform : PC
---
Issue : Sometimes for no reason my up
---
And downs get inverted just for the trial
---
That‚Äôs exactly how I do it. If I‚Äòm chasing a really good and competent survivor going towards a god loop after a long chase already, then I‚Äôll break and go for somebody else. I can usually corral survivors into going certain ways so I try to make the others go and waste the pallets at those god loops to make it inadvertently more difficult for the good looper.
---
Now when I play survivor, it‚Äôs a coin flip. I either get face camped for running the killer around, and god help me if I dare to try and use a flashlight to save a teammate, or I get abandoned and can keep doing objectives

---
Are you teabagging and clicking? = toxic
---
Are you trying to save teammates and blind the killer to juke them? = not toxic
---
Maybe it's not affecting your rank 10 games but at rank 1 when all pallets are gone after 2 gens because of an idiot doing a fucking challenge to drop them it ruins games.
---
I've only ever teabagged once. I was in a match where I got downed (and the killer left me slugged for a while), and one player came up, and instead of healing me he teabagged me for a good ten seconds before running away 
---
Later on, he got hooked by the killer. So I ran up, teabagged in front of the hook, and left him there.
---
He suicided right then and there. And I hate to admit, it felt pretty good.
---

[Patch notes from 1.3.0](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_Notes_1.3.0)
---
the pallet is sideways, not area-ways. youre vertical. imo it should be possible for a hatchet to hit you while youre dropping a pallet, but only if its aimed at your head. this hatchet clearly did hit the pallet but theyve got crap hitboxes.
---
Not joking,  he chose to compete the gen instead of locker hiding as rancor
---
I sit corrected lol.
---
Oh, and I didn‚Äôt mean to imply that speed increases DON‚ÄôT decrease time taken, just that a percentile speed increase doesn‚Äôt directly translate to percentile time taken reduction. It‚Äôs a little unintuitive I know.
---
Ok, at least I'm not alone in this then. I'm not complaining about Ghostface in general and think he's totally fine as he is, I just found it really really odd that he's totally taken over at least on Xbox recently. It's almost as if all the Spirit mains decided to switch over to Ghostface at the same time, joining with Ghostface mains to create a goddamn flood of them.
---
Drown them out would be horrible for the chest. Poor lonely boi ;-;
---
They've hit the pallet while it's being dropped before so it's probably just latency
---
I actually mori'd a ttv once then became a longtime fan because of how well they handled it and their general attitude.
---
Go for iron will
---
My build is slowly starting to evolve towards countering bad teammates instead of countering the killer
---
I've noticed these challenges acting a little weird. I specifically remember the 2 health states with self care one, I healed only once the entire match and was still able to complete it. I dont really get it
---
No, just catch them.
---
Use an ivory or if you dont have any you can always trade a daily for a new one once every day
---
Yeah I mean this game is far from perfect, but let‚Äôs assume the hit boxes aren‚Äôt shit for a min. I agree that it should hit me in a headshot scenario. But the pallet obviously hits the hatchet. It was so obvious I knew it before I clipped this. The hatchet never even made it to the other side of the pallet. It counted as hitting me on the whole other side. Even left blood lol. So that means during the animation, my hit box is bigger than the whole pallet itself. That seems a bit fucked lol
---
It's to discourage face camping, but all it does is punish good killers
---
that's kind of silly tbh. I don't see how it's any different from standing over someone while they bleed out
---
No, they just have to step in the trap. :)
---
You want Killers to be more like Survivors? Sure! They can stagger after they take falls, and run when they hold Shift for 130% speed.
---
oh yeah that is kind of ridiculous. and everyone keeps saying huntress is good
---
Similarly, I've seen people being called "basement campers" just for having insidious in their build.
---
They didn't use the perk a single time yet they are basement camping losers for some reason.
---
Damn mine always looks like dark sense, deja vu, resilience...
---
Chances are the teammate unhooking you don't crouch.
---
fr the only way i can rlly have a good game w him is if i use thw king piece and the green shock range addon
---
Just the fact that it made it look so bad on my end sucks. Like I took damage for the pallet lol
---
Where do you live my man? That is NOT my experience. But hey awesome for you ig
---
Or a bombardment if it's the ear.
---
Docs great at tracking survivors while having amazing add-one and if legion uses frenzy then he knows where the survivors are currently at unless they‚Äôre hiding in lockers.
---
Both survivors are pretty quick to top it off.
---
What ranks are you playing at that Doc is *useless* at?
---
*click click click click click click*
---
Nope. They just have to step in the trap. That's all.
---
I think his shred needs some serious love. He really shines during the last 3 gens but his early game is garbage.
---
Wait what did they say? Comment was deleted.
---
Yep. That's what I was (trying to) reference with my comment.
---
Yes hexy
---
Demogorgon is super good, people just don't know how to play him
---
Thanks for the replies.
---
Go for it. If I‚Äôm killer and someone dcs I fully expect more dcs.
---
She absolutely did, or did you NOT see the big thing saying ‚Äúsafe unhook‚Äù as Meg went out the door?
---
I made a post about this yesterday after I noticed I was getting credit for it playing Meg, LOL. Your own sacrifice counts towards it too
---
Yeah after the unhook u gotta run like hell. But it works when she traps at gens and stuffs. Also flashlights break her traps I believe.
---
I just farmed for a game and pulled someone off a gen lol
---
Ah yes, another perk that punishes survivors for doing their objective. Awesome design!
---
The title makes you sound full of yourself, like "Why everyone is wrong but I am right"
---
I feel like the addons between killers are no good. Ultra Rare on Ghostface is just seeing survivors for four seconds and more stalk, while Myers has unlimited T3 and Anna has iridescent. I could modify the add-one to be even. For Myers, if you wanted to down, replace unlimited T3 with detection and aura perks not working. For GF if Myers was kept the same, tape is now stalk progress and exposed is constant **if you aren‚Äôt stalking from a corner.**
---
Upgrade Honing stone to tops for Trapper, except if they manage to get out at all. (Stalls for him to get there even if they get helped out. Wraith is balanced. I have no idea for the rest of free killers because I don‚Äôt play them. Legion replace vaulting over pallets destroys them to stunned by them only while in Frenzy, doesn‚Äôt effect Spirit Fury progress. Spirit is getting fixed with prayer beads. If it was kept the same up it to ultra rare. Plague with the vomit addon is a-okay. I think that would make some of the killers with worse addons better.
---
Good if you have yellow bar or worse. 
---
I will day this person was probably a smurf or something. Maybe a deranked account tbh. Because they were supposed to be rank 17. But had 4 maxed out perks from 3 different killers (that wasn‚Äôt huntress), crazy addons, and would hit cross the map Hail Marys with bbq after every single hook. It was kinda insane. Avoided her most of the game until this shit.
---
Doc is GREAT at tracking- buts that‚Äôs the problem: that‚Äôs the only benefit to playing him. His power isn‚Äôt helpful in chase. If your power needs an add on to actually be good your power sucks and that add on should be base kit
---
You're still further proving my point
---
He isn't invisible though
---
I've seen footage of people dropping a pallet on a spirit fury legion who was using his power while they already had deep wounds. That's just shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Yeah... mori ritual -&gt; auto-trashcan. :/
---
(then again, I'm auto-trashcanning all killer dailies because of lags making it unironically unplayable and unfun on my current graphics card)
---
For killers, a good trick to tell if they're toxic is to say "thanks for the free hits" in postgame, and see how they react
---
BL still makes you recover quicker after landing even when exhausted
---
I believe the negated stun from the fall allows the loop to work, which isn't affected by the Exhaustion cooldown.
---
The speed boost upon the first drop is just a bonus.
---
Change your steam name to "One Punch Man" and play who you want with Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, Dying Light, and Rancor.
---
Don't hit the obsession until the last gen pops so you can insta-down and mori. 
---
I used to run this on OG Freddy (Dying Light was a "Tunnel the obsession" perk at the time, so I used Monitor and Abuse since it synergized with Classic Freddy's kit) and it was surprisingly viable even at higher ranks. (You can keep the obsession asleep so he's slow, can always see him so easy PWYF stacks, etc.) At the time I was running this with classic Freddy Mettle Of Man was very common meaning an Obsession running MoM + DH + Deliverance + DS + an instaheal would literally die (Mori'd out of the game) in one hit bypassing all perks and items.
---
Oh sorry I didn't see your post! I didn't know you're own sacrifice counted too, that's hilarious.
---
Also Yikes 2 Sacrifices with 1 gen done just one of those games I feel for you Uncle Fapp
---
It doesnt come out in a constant stream it comes on globs so you the surv couldve gone between the globs
---
So this is how people are disarming my traps so easily
---
Obviously. This sub is dumb as bricks.
---
How come there's no gore in the game? It's already rated M lol.
---
petty
---
Your point that everyone should have to explain to you in detail why you're wrong on a subject just because you're don't understand? That's just entitled idiocy.
---
spirit with prayer beads would probably be effective, otherwise myers in tier 1 or ghostface both can sneak up
---
Hi, my uncle works for BHVR and he said you won't get banned for that. So relax.
---
 I used spirit with prayer beads. Running both discordance and surveillance to know when people with on gens. I also used monitor so I could get close enough without them noticing
---
Imagine saying you DC and then calling the other guy salty.
---
PTB is expected on Tuesday according to leaks, so we should know a lot more in the next 48 hours or so.
---
Yeah, but Ghostface is kind of just a better Myers, so it's either shuffle GF's traits a bit or buff Michael.
---
Jeez. I just want 800 more xrp to put me at an even 1000. 
---
I wish I had got in on xrp when I read a Forbes article months ago stating ripple just broke into the top 100 crypto currencies.. but no...lol I was all "cryptos are gunna get slammed and crash, Uncle Sam isn't going to just let people have money"
---
Oh well i came to my senses at least before it hit a dollar. Haha. Live and learn.

"Grab Happy Doc" exploit. 
---
Doctor can grab in treatment mode, and since you don't swing your weapon and it has almost zero cooldown you can just spam M1 in front of the hook in treatment mode facecamping and as soon as someone goes to unhook you'll autograb them. 
---
I used to do this to win hatch standoffs.
---
Ghostface is the best killer to do this one with, but you can also pull it off (pun totally intended) with Tier 1 Myers and Pig. If you have the Coxcombed Clapper and The Ghost add-ons for Wraith, you can also get some gen grabs if you uncloak on the other side of a corner here and there.
---
I mean, not everyone that has TTV in their name is going to make your life miserable. If that person is acting like a toxic scumbag, then be my guest, and AFAIK, there are several of those out there. But there are some genuine people that just want to have a good time and are not toxic at all.
---
We need to stop with the generalizations. It's like some people in this game have this victim complex under them 24/7 and think that all the {insert player group here} are after them trying to ruin their days with endless toxicity. It's not like that.
---
Someone acts like an asshole to you first? Then that's justification for you to treat them like an asshole. Apply that logic to every player you face. TTV? That's far from being a proper excuse to act scummy.
---
well if you don't like what I said you can just DC
---
I think his Shred is fine besides the weird stuff like Of The Abyss cancelling while falling or your sensitivity still being reduced during your Shred attack recovery.
---
We love you too.
---
Legit happened to me. Nancy is either a really good player when I‚Äôm killer or stupid as shit as I‚Äôm survivor
---
Just yesterday I played against a Spirit who camped the first hook because "Ruin was down under 5minutes so you gotta do what you gotta do". It do be like that
---
!vredditdownloader

These are nerfs. They are changing an aspect to make spirit weaker. Nerfing her. Unless I‚Äôm grossly mistaken on the term nerf. That‚Äôs what they did. And slugging is boring for both sides. I dislike it as a survivor and killer. As for the BHVR topic. I just agree with some of the top streamers in the fact that gens go too quickly. It‚Äôs too difficult to pressure a good team of survivors. (By difficult I mean damn near impossible) since they will all be on different gens across map. And chases just can‚Äôt go fast enough tbh. That‚Äôs why high mobility killers have always been the best. Pressure. Nurse. Billy. Spirit. I like that stealth killers are becoming meta kinda. With ghost face. But I don‚Äôt think he will ever be nurse or billy or spirit tier. And any time killers complain they just release a ‚Äúcounter‚Äù to what we complained ab. Any time survivors complain. They change the thing they‚Äôre complaining ab. This time spirit. A while ago the review bombed the game and I can‚Äôt quite remember what they were complaining ab but it got changed immediately IIRC
---
*Laughs in Ironworks of Misery*
---
When you read the post before the flair
---
With gen rushing being o so popular perks that force those people to put some actuall thought into the game are what we need. I agree with you that there should be other ways to deal with gen rushing then punishing survivors for doing there job, but if all else is lost...
---
Less points. Harder to pip. 4K isn‚Äôt win. Pip is win.
---
you're correct! they even have haunted mattresses.
---
Literally all we know is Sword, Mask, Japanese. So either you know something everyone else doesn't, or you've just got a problem with Japanese characters.
---
The devs will 100% fix this issue now that you made a post crying about it.
---
The only thing that‚Äôs needs nerfing is forever Freddy, the rest of his kit is fine
---
Bruh, are you for real? Cause yesterday I played against a spirit who camped me on my first hook, I mean... I did cleanse her ruin tho, but goddamn.
---
Just play on Hawkins International Labratory
---
I stunned a Spirit while she was picking a survivor up, it registered it as a stun but she didn‚Äôt drop
---
TBH I think at this point they might as well just add in more Prestige levels and have Legacy cosmetic variants for every Survivor/Killer.
---
Well.. what's the best way to play him?  lol
---
I don't have Michael, though. Which kind of loops back to my issue that these moris mandate owning DLC if you don't want to BP grind out limited items and watch people DC away from them.
---
Yeah everyone including streamers playing the game thousands of hours doesnt know - but a Reddit rando does
---
I did just play a Trial were I just keep returning to hook and that went well.
---
True, but I already used my trade on "Escape with an item."
---
OH thats what they mean, okay
---
jesus you're really arguing for no reason huh. I mostly just said it as a funny off-hand comment since Dying Light was like that for literally 3 years, it's not like it was fast or that the devs recently found out the kind of playstyle it promotes when paired with an Ivory.
---
I'm glad devs are straying away from the kind of playstyle, but to think that the amount of time Dying Light was kept like that was a reasonable amount of time before being reworked is ridiculous.
---
F
---
Just grind forever against toxic [respective other side] to level up like 90 times to get rid of all the Dark Senses, D√©j√† Vus and Resiliences, ez.
---
Oh that‚Äôs good, I can honestly respect when a player is good but doesn‚Äôt taunt or anything. Seems pretty rare in all honesty
---
Those offerings don't pop up much.
---
Hide end game chat.
---
I did a 180 and survived.
---
I think it really easy to do with Freddy. Just place some pools around a dropped pallet or window and let him run through a pool. He will be slowed down and you will have an easy time to grab him when he vaults.
---
Did it 3 times in my first game I did the challange.
---
&gt; no passive madness beyond tier 2
---
&gt; tier 3 by shock therapy
---
And you said
---
&gt; thats like 2 shock therapy with addons to reach tier 3
---
Please tell me how thats different from plague? Who also spreads by interacting with objects. Also vile purge is so good as well. (And with add on she can see your aura till you cleanse...at which point you cost the game)
---
Doc addons are (besides current calm+order) all pretty useless. Nightmare does better job with fake pallets (which actually does something), doc slows down in treatmode (slow and even slowerwhen charging power). He is pretty much like any m1 killer but just have benefit in he can find survivors better. But he has no kit to actually end that chase quick or pressure.
---
Doc‚Äôs ‚Äòamazing‚Äô power to stop survivors from using pallets/loops are replicated by clown...and we know how much clown sucks. At the moment he is annoying, but not seriously threatening. He does need some rework. 
---
Lastly rather than just saying ‚Äò you play it wrong‚Äô, do explain your point of view please.
---
Hoping this killer's power works around blood considering everything they've teased so far.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really bother me honestly.
---
You are salty over 1 particular spot on a map - while trapper on the game or lerys Has no good spota whatsoever
---
I'm gonna start sending this to people who call me a camper when they do this shit
---
Trapper trap grabs dont count. Window vaults Locker hops, totem cleansing, gen grabs, and chests do though. Its easily easier to do by just forcing a window vault and grabbing them
---
Damn, why you discriminating against us p3 nea mains üòû
---
I loved this episode
---
Ah, they also need paid currency, nvm then.
---
Ironworks is an absolute fucking nightmare for killers at best, at worst you can get a pile of infinites that runs from the killer shack into the ironworks that makes it impossible to win against good survivors
---
Well, lore-wise the Survivors can become Killers once they have all of their hope stripped away.  
---
So maybe it could be possible to see a Survivor and Killer be reflections of the same person they once were.
---
Adding ttv to your name is basically asking to get morid‚Äôd or the equivalent on any other game
---
Dead hard, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline Legacy 3 claudette with a Purple Toolbox and will tbag at every pallet, x4
---
Ah ok
---
I feel you. To me, though, 1 wholesome game is worth more than 5 terrible ones, and this is why I keep playing. If I ever encounter you, I‚Äôll make sure you have fun. &lt;3
---
you can point your left analog stick in one direction (left or right) and rotate the right analog stick in the other direction to make an actual 360 on console. takes some practice to make it smooth and use good fakes with it but it‚Äôs definitely worked for me.
---
Ah see I'm on inferior PS4 so no post game chat. Most killers are set to private as well. I wanna make the jump to PC but all my perks and cosmetics and characters lol.
---
There's a difference between reworking a character and removing them entirely. Plenty of multiplayer characters get reworked (look at Torbjorn or Symmetra in Overwatch, hell Sym got like 3 reworks before they settled. 
---
If Spirit got a massive rework like Freddy, it would be problematic, but people would deal because that's status quo for multiplayer games, but if they just removed her? What about everyone who paid for her? Players who saved up hundreds of hours worth of shards to earn her? It would be a clusterfuck and I don't know how you could think it wouldn't piss off basically the entire playerbase. Because even if you hated Sopirit, it sets a precident, and what if your favourite was next?
---
In a way, however a small stagger wouldn't be a huge disadvantage to a killer, especially with the suggestion of the stagger only being applicable to a killer currently holding a survivor. The thought is that this recovery should apply to both sides, admittedly this change does mainly benefit survivors but again in most circumstances this kind of change wont be much of an issue, but incases where killers skip the first half of the stairway because they can drop and feel no stagger, it just doesn't really seem "Fair" for no penalty when even small drops affect survivors. Yes survivors do have an ability that allows them to almost fully negate this affect, im not suggesting that a killer wouldnt also be able to take a similiar ability, im also not suggesting anything big like 2 seconds. Also the way they fall because of no stagger looks kind of dumb.
---
They still ban for it because it's considered griefing. It has no strategic value and is purely for BMing. Insidious basement bubba? Technically a strategy. Slugging? Strategic value. Mori spamming? Does nothing towards the objective of the game. They will 100% give a ban for it.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dxd0p3/a_killers_nightmare/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That the next survivor had to be female since the last survivor was male (Steve). He basically said the sex of the survivor swapped back and forth from male to female every chapter. As you can see, his logic doesn‚Äôt hold up.

I've gotten facecamped before cause I had a flashlight. I didn't even use it once.

I just did that to a spirit 2 days ago because I got my tome challenge complete and she didn't kill anyone the entire game.

Wait, is that a thing?

I look at like I hit them so hard that their internet died.

---
Meh.  They do it because they're likely running a small channel and are trying to get views.  It's the equivalent to in LoL how small streamers would copy-paste a plug for their stream before/after matches.  
---
If anything I kind of like being able to rewatch a match that I'm in from someone else's perspective.  Assuming they're actually streaming while in a match with me.
---
Sure it‚Äôs possible but it doesn‚Äôt work 100% of the time. Doctor is a low tier killer for a reason. Look at Nurse Spirit Billy and Huntress, all top tier killers (obviously spirit and nurse more so) and they all have powers that help them down people. Doctor can‚Äôt down anyone with his power, it barely slows the game down as good survivors will still hit all the skillchecks and isn‚Äôt strong without addons. Do you honestly believe Doctor can compete with any of the 4 killers I mentioned in a rank 1 environment?
---
Sweet. Try it with the basement and with some basement perks
---
Accidentally brought the last survivor to a hatch earlier. Got a thank you message for it. Feels good
---
Last thing killers need is perks that punish survivors for doing good and reward killers foe doing bad
---
Kinda reminds me of this

It's basically what Rituals would be if they didn't suck.
---
Mostly it was the Moonwalk and Frank's Mix Tape. It was stupidly strong even as a purple. But a lot of people didn't like that even base Legion, even if horrible he's had no counterplay
---
and then when you finally get them and facecamp them like the stubborn killer you are
---
and then they say something like "are you proud?" to which i respond "yes"
---
Just curious, and I'm all in favor of buffing wraith, what would suggest be done to buff wraith?
---
Kea Narlson?
---
Only if you hit them 1st since they are awake after unhook and thus in your terror radius.
---
Better to just hit the guy unhooking and not have to hit them 1st so they get speed boost, also injures unhooking guy so they easier to catch later if they dont heal
---
Damn switch has a tier 4 of ruin?!?
---
DbD's biggest problem is its community, though. Those same people would probably DC just as quickly, so it's not like the lack of Challenges would make them better to be matched with.
---
You either do gens and he gets you into a chase, after which you will die, even if he chases you for 5 minutes, or you do nothing and drag the game on.
---
Hum... Its fair cause you got to see her all game.
---
Just realized, that's a hat, not a bowlcut.
---
And to be fair in the spirit of horror killers/films... it is the thrill of the hunt. It's not the Express ending, it's the fear inducing chase... üëç
---
Yup!
---
Mors Ambitio is pure suffering. Cypress only rubs it in.
---
I thought I heard they were making a "Husk" system where you can still finish what you're doing with a DCed player.
---
Angry much? It‚Äôs a game man, if you only have fun when winning you need to learn to not be a sore loser.
---
Yeah it instead of making it go back 5% when you get a good skill check it just makes it impossible to hit skill checks, it‚Äôs a really OP perk
---
ps4 is same
---
2 Knives plus sloppy plus thana is actually pretty good
---
That is also a thing. 
---
Basically my rule of thumb is hang at the exit for a bit, if the killer comes give them a free hit, if not then leave so you're not wasting their time. Sometimes killers won't want that free hit because they either don't care, don't agree with the play style, or are salty. 
---
Just don't teabag. A quick one to greet other survivors is fine and fun, but teabagging the killer is just a dick move any day of the week, no matter the circumstances (except for when a GF is playing around and teabags you, then it's open season!)
---
Seriously? Man I thought switch only went down to 10 FPS on skill checks lol
---
Character wise probably, but in terms of sterotypes:
---
Dwights are Trapper because they're default.
---
Megs are Hillbilly because they picked something strong and not too hard and stuck with it (playing Meg for easy sprint burst and adrenaline).
---
Claudettes are Nurse because they want the biggest advantage they can have (playing Claudette for easy mode 360s).
---
Jakes are Wraith because they know their character isn't the most effective but they're gonna play it anyway.
---
It just did the day before yesterday, I think.
---
I‚Äôm having that perpetually used for scapegoat feeling. Does it get boring ever? I don‚Äôt even spend that much energy on myself. I‚Äôm BBC anything you want so why be so negative?

Yeah, but in Horror killer films there mostly are not 3 other people with a master's degree in mechanical engineering running around, repairing generators and ending the movie in 5 minutes ...
---
I don‚Äôt make any content... Hazbin Hotel is a creative and very artistic show, that‚Äôs why people like making memes and jokes from it. It‚Äôs an inspiring and artful done project. People get inspired from something they like, and they want to make others laugh. Even if it isn‚Äôt original, sharing something positive and trying to make others laugh isn‚Äôt a bad thing. 
---
You don‚Äôt have to like everything that is shared, but being nasty doesn‚Äôt do anything but give you negative attention.
---
So he's in the perfect range where he can call anyone older than him a boomer and anyone younger than him a zoomer.
---
The "when all is lost" thing was just a joke. And ya some people will do what you said at the end, but  my main problem with gen rushing is how the survivors can get a gen and a half done before you even find them. I understand this perk wouldn't help really, I was just letting my frustration do the talking.
---
Opinion
---
No problem. Happy to help.
---
Pop totems and NOED is useless. Stop bitching about a super easy to counter perk, it's just silly.
---
Nobody gets your point lol, but you are right tho. It basically negates his power late game if the demogorgon has badly placed portals.
---
But I'm not wrong and I didn't ask anyone to explain it to me.
---
 But if you're going to be disrespectful I'm just going to end this conversation report you and put you on my block list so I suggest you change your tone and calm down
---
I didn‚Äôt complete the gen, I was being chased the entire game(the spirit gave me way too much distance) and when she finally got close enough to hit me the final generator popped, giving her an insta-down and a mori on her second hit of the game
---
Thats such a power move
---
Not a big wraith player but here goes: Complete rework to his power honestly. The invisibility is cool and I like the speed boost that comes after uncloaking but he needs something else in addition. Maybe a stalk mechanic but that‚Äôd just make him another GF or Myers. 
---
Apart from that maybe an ability to turn off the shimmer while cloaked for a few seconds and/or letting him grab while cloaked, It‚Äôs a tricky question.
---
They'd have to classify waiting at the exit gates to teabag the killer before leaving as griefing then. IIRC the devs said they won't ban for slugging people until bleedout, even during endgame collapse. (Where there's no gameplay advantage.) 
---
If a survivor is being a shitter and I'm lucky enough to have a Mori equipped yeah maybe I'd do it a few times before actually Moriing them.
---
Or make it like this
---
1-2 DC won‚Äôt earn do for match
---
3-4 DC  -8000 blood points
---
5-6 can‚Äôt play game for 10 min
---
7-8 Won‚Äôt earn Bloodpoints or xp for the next 5 matches (Matches you dc from won‚Äôt count)
---
9-10 Put in lobby‚Äôs with other DCers 
---
11-any amount can‚Äôt play for 1 day
---
There should be a dc ratios above the names like Naruto storm 4 tracks how many dcs they have so you can dodge the lobby with someone with a lot of dcs
---
Facecamping because the survivor had good plays is really the most toxic thing a killer can do. Survivors are toxic when they farm others, t bag after stuns, destroy all pallets on map for no reason, block other survivors in and or at loops so the killer hits them, and I've even had other survivors spam me with messages during the match after they lost to clog my svreen and prevent me from hesring killer (i okay vonsole)
---
I used to play on PS4 and I can confirm. It was even worse against Doc or during events.
---
Hahaha love it
---
Survivors don‚Äôt want to die. Ambitious survivors don‚Äôt want to die even less. Freddy‚Äôs add-ons drag the game out. Why the fuck should I run in the open and not even try to hide when he‚Äôs nearby? And we were doing gens. Like I said, we finished three gens. And that took forever. Eventually everyone started playing safe. Freddy would hit someone and go back to gens, hit again, back to another gen. Healing takes time. Don‚Äôt fucking act like only survivors can drag games out. I‚Äôm not going to throw away a game just because it takes too long. But that game was enough for me to warrant all the future DCs against Forever Freddy.

I have a video saved of a Spirt doing that to me near a pallet and we‚Äôre 360‚Äôing for a good couple of minutes. It honestly made the game a little better.

The message system on PS4 is handled by Sony, not BHVR. Submitting a ticket to BHVR would be useless. Instead, go to the conversation, hover over one of the offending messages, and click report. I'm not sure if you need to report each message individually or if one would be enough, though. You should get a confirmation message from Sony about 3-5 minutes later telling you the report has been received and handled. And 10 minutes to 12 hours later you will get another confirmation message saying the user has been warned, or if they're repeat offenders, eother temporarily banned or permanantly banned. I'm not sure if you can open a direct ticket with Sony or not but try their support website either way.
---
No it‚Äôs just unfunny when you do it 40 times a week, and to add onto that you make unoriginal jokes too. If you made an effort then you wouldn‚Äôt have gotten so much negative attention.
---
A killer with some kind of pokey long-range weapon would be pretty cool, too. (n this case I suppose, that would be a naginata?)
---
fair enough
---
Rank reset is a myth, nice try baby survivor.
---
Surge is great and demo is strong enough to do it, but ya the adept achievements are rough.
---
Surge applies a 10% explosion penalty + 8% bonus so its like 3/4 of pop goes the weasel, which is a fairly strong snowball perk.
---
Surge is really really nasty if you get a 3 gen going since it can apply to 2 or even 3 gens, super underrated perk
---
Just bring a map w killers belongings you get the exact aura at a larger range and save a perk slot
---
Yea it was pretty hard ngl his perks are not the best imo. But I got it soon after this game lol
---
You better treat that beautiful boy good, he is precious.
---
I like the idea of tracking ratios. Maybe give a shame emblem
---
Lol you're not missing out on much, his perks are garbage for the most part.
---
What does taunt mean? I am never even playing anybody? Who and where is this going on? Somebody hijacked my identity and then made me in their own image. The fiction is awesome, I mean who needs reality when you can customize to your own deepest desires and inflict or spin or sway or perpetrate and call it reality?
---
Thanks for sharing what a roller-coaster of a story haha
---
Yeah that‚Äôs good idea
---
So what your saying is if I bring dark sense, whenever the game is near to an end, I should not be able to take any agro at all or save teammates because ~25 seconds of aura means an insta down and mori? Which saves a hit/speed burst and 3 hooks which is at MINIMAL 1 minute(very unlikely that it‚Äôs below 2 minutes worth)?
---
Do you think I made this?
---
That group bombed the hook like moths hitting a lamp.
---
I have seen people act 100% like this, I wouldn't assume they were being sarcastic at all.
---
Is there any link for those and site removal that really works? I‚Äôm not any good at this or anything else but need to get off.
---

---
Lol all it says is flashlights are not toxic that's the point, flashlight items by themselves are not toxic, toxic survivors are toxic.
---
Iron 1 isn't really that good, Burrowed 3 isn't too important since it only extends the time to mend, DS 1 still gives you a obsession and therefore forces the killer to respect every ''fresh'' unhooked Surv
---
I‚Äôm not even talking about an addon, give him a button press while cloaked to get rid of the shimmer for a few (3-5) seconds. Maybe make him walk slower while active to compensate. Would pair well with the addons were you can‚Äôt hear the bell and he doesn‚Äôt have a terror radius for a few seconds after using it. Make him an actual stealth killer
---
Okay  I'm not gonna explain why keyboard and mouse makes juking easier and helps with precision. Just as you were saying. it would make puking with the plague easier. That's a competitive advantage.
---
Hey fuck negativity. You play your way and be nice if you want. Some people will take advantage but that's life. Don't let that stop you from being nice if you want to.
---
Oh boy so this means I will get banned more easily in future. Joy.
---
Same. Why I made this post. Killer facecamped the whole team one at a time with ruin. Blamed the whole thing on the ONE person with a flashlight and tried to act like he wasn't the asshole

"Toxic" can be one of two things: either being rude in general (taunting in chat, teabagging/flashlight clicking, or smacking on hook/nodding) or, in the case of "Toxic" YT videos, using the perks, add-ons, and offerings that give the biggest perceived advantage and taunting in chat just for the video

I‚Äôd recommend you get and learn how to use whispers if you have trouble finding people. It‚Äôs not a gen slowing perk but it allows you to make up for time you lose looking for people. Either that or bbq and chili.
---
Who said I was angry or that I was a sore loser?
---
I love being chased and looping killers. When killer chases me and there are 0 pallets left because my team wasted them, it's not fun, because I didn't actually get to play the game.
---
You're potentially ruining a game for 3 other people. Try to be considerate.
---
All I care about is if I pip, and standing still in the corner of the map won't allow for that. Granted it's hard  to pip when you die in red ranks, but the way you talk that should not be a problem for you. Just do your gens, when the chase starts your teammates can do gens since you buy time. The Killer can only ever stall the game out if you 3 gen yourself. I mean, keep DC'ing because you don't understand how the game works if you like, I just hope they ban you aswell since you completely fuck your team with that shit.
---
I think I'll pass, thanks.
---
yep. That being said, since the next one is a 3 day (I think, never actually had to memorize the progression, I don't get banned) It should be appealable. If you appeal it and win, it goes away and they might even check your previous one to see if it was justified. So, it's possible that you could have your whole record cleared if you get unfairly banned again

....What are you talking about?
---
Obviously you can 4k as doctor, I could 4k as a no blink nurse with no perks if the game goes well for me.  The doctors only advantage over any other killer is tracking, what he needs is a rework so he can actually do something to them when in a chase or at minimum make the shocks do damage when they‚Äôre in tier 3
---
Scratched Mirror Myers with a Lery‚Äôs Memorial offering. Just start stalking and when you see someone on a gen work your way behind them and grab them.
---
That's exactly what I said. The maps start with 7 generators. If there are 3 generators left, that means the survivors did 4 of them already, thus the 3 survivors can see the hatch and escape. Perhaps it is you who needs to know how the game works.

I had a hag them all around and like a good 50 feet around so there was no chance of getting. The bag then proceeded with to face camp me. It doesn‚Äôt really bother me cause I main killer but it confused me; what‚Äôs the point of putting all the hard work and letting them get two gens just to look at me and let them get the other 3 gens.
---
bt only works if you have friends lol
---
I have about 10 clips of it just straight up not working for 5 minutes. It seems to like struggle hugely tracking certain characters, but once it tracks them it starts working fine. But sometimes it literally takes 5 tries for it to actually work
---
What's the problem then? You pretty much got iri Lightbringer then so getting in chases literally is what you want, or getting the chance to heal others or yourself.
---
When have you ever seen a survivor give you a kill when you fuck up? In my 1200 hours I've had literally 3. I remember those sweet pure souls.
---
What a weird yet cool dream lmao, and I haven't dreamed about dbd
---
This is true, but it's often not the best strategy. If someone is looping you well enough, their team can fly through gens while you commit to the chase. Some survivors (especially SWF) will intentionally annoy the killer to get a long chase going and buy time.
---
I would of love to have seen the rest of the match, I wonder if the other survivors freaked out after that
---
Well believe it or not you put the text up there and this subreddit is for the game dead by daylight, not stupid hotel show. I‚Äôm surprised you can even read.
---
It's not "trus playstyle" he didnt invent it and it doesnt belong to him, it's not even that good, any ghostface knows that not every survivor can be stalked successfully anyways. Every ghostface already has nurses calling, we dont need anti heal perks.
---
me: are you suggesting the next killer is a maple tree hahahaha
---
you: THE WOOD
---
I agree and that beautiful boy will be even more beautiful when his face rework comes out
---
:0 nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs your opinion. BUT imo it‚Äôs the weakest from the trilogy. Great film but it has nothing against Shaun of the dead and especially hot fuzz
---
I don‚Äôt even see the point of running a match like that. I‚Äôve even seen them burn 3+ bloody party streamers and burn through the gens ASAP and leave. So... nice to get 300% of 10k for everyone I guess.
---
It‚Äôs either
---
You shouldn't play on Xbox One then, I'll play it with old friends from time to time, but the over all quality of the game on it makes the PS4 look like PC, so I usually just get myself in chases and altruism while they do gens.
---
Are the tomes the ones with the tiers to get story elements and the rift the one with the premium pass?
---
Jesus fucking christ you're making my braincells commit suicide one by one.
---
I tend to try and keep my survivor rank around 7+. I found that going in to purple and red the calibre of play style might be more "pro" but I find the players very try hard in their attitude... üëç
---
But if a killer downed people right away it'd make for a very dull game. I do feel like there should be something to slow down gen pops if they're going too fast but it should be for a killer to bring in... like hex but it only activates once the first 3 gens are done to lure survivors in to a false sense of security. üëç
---
Disconnects are annoying as it is... downing people fast would just kill the game. It's already annoying as a survivor at rank reset with face camping and tunnelling.
---
Play When I'm playing survivor you do not know how much heat should I have the person who destroys haunted grounds whilst I'm in a chase.
---
However whilst I'm a killer I want to give that person a massive hug because they just screwed over their team. 
---
I think my favourite ever situation was I hit three downs when they only had one gen left and I had 8 sacks of Save The Best For Last.
---
Thank you obsession Jane for being greedy
---
Doc is way too addon dependent for his power, for example he's got to be pretty close to use his shock ablilty. Due to this it can make it really difficult to use in a chase to help you.
---
Weird, I‚Äôve only been running into trappers, hag, and legion
---
Xbox One ? We were talking about PS4, and I‚Äôm on PC now.
---
i mean if they're really salty they'll use anything as an excuse
---
In the 1970s.  Technically anyone born after  1980 is a millennial so the generation before that which includes the seventies and Myers was born in 1950 that makes him a Boomer
---
I didn't say anything about bt
---
Guess I gotta wait a minute 45
---
I just bring an ivory and kill on last hook tbh
---
Does he have an add on that lets him kill? Or is it quite literally the Mori offering?
---
Actually no... If they have borrowed time and it activates it is because you hit the unhooked survivor. And when you hit a survivor they go to sleep and because of that their borrowed time timer goes down even while you are chasing them
---
I really like all the movies from Edgar Wright, but Scott Pilgrim has a special place in my heart.
---
No, I was just saying, if the PS4 is bad for you, then definitely don't try Xbox One. It's even worse, at least in my experience.
---
Doesn‚Äôt beat the foreshadowing in SOTD with the original Bloody Mary scene. Idk why I was downvoted on the last comment (idk Id it was you) but whether way Edgar Wright is an amazing director end of
---
In that situation, your best chance is to hook someone and patrol the hook for altruistic survivors. It is almost impossible that you don't actually have a hook in walking distance, but unless the hook is hidden by a wall it doesn't get the red aura, so keeping your head on a swivel and tap A+D to counter struggling survivors.
---
I disagree too, I don‚Äôt think never stalking is a good idea. Don‚Äôt take me as a TrU3 fanboy lol. I would never say that Ghostface is the 3rd best killer in the game like he does. 
---
I see the BBQ on Billy as more of a really logical thing. You see survivors auras across the map, Billy can quickly cross the map, profit. I‚Äôd say the anti-healing no stalk build is more unique than that. It‚Äôs a build. BBQ is just a ‚ÄúYeah, that just makes a lot of sense to pair with Billy‚Äôs power‚Äù type of thing. It would be a better comparison if there were someone who were purely M1ing with Billy (like TrU3 is only doing regular hits with Ghostface) and running a perk build to go with it. That‚Äôs sort of unusual. 
---
The attention comes from his Twitch streams and YouTube. From there, viewers share it to other streamers (which I don‚Äôt believe follow TrU3 since he‚Äôs kinda....the odd one out per-say lol), post on Reddit or forums, etc. Most people here and on other forums dislike TrU3, so I‚Äôve seen mostly posts hating on the build and TrU3. Which, like I said, you wouldn‚Äôt see if it weren‚Äôt for him. He averages at around 2k viewers per DBD stream, so obviously it‚Äôs going to get attention. For example, Otz has tried it a few times, though he couldn‚Äôt resist stalking multiple times. I don‚Äôt blame him though.
---
That‚Äôs also the point of my comment. If you use the flashlight as it‚Äôs intended, then it‚Äôs not a toxic item. It‚Äôs only toxic when the survivor themselves is being toxic.
---
I can also run Overwatch and even Devil May Cry fairly consistently at 60FPS.
---
Dead By Daylight is just poorly optimized. Even with my GTX1060 and 16gb of RAM, I will still stutter a little bit on Ultra 100% on Dead By Daylight.
---
I have good experiences with Nvidia/GTX Cards, so id recommend those
---
doc sucks mongo dong, so does legion
---
Happened to me earlier too was a purple one :(
---
i dont know why this appeared under your answers. this was an official comment lol
---
They are,  as long as you play optimal though. That beeing said, do your job and you will pip, effectivly winning. I don't see the problem, and if you lose against Doc, c'mon bro what are you even doing.
---
i break every single totem i see, dull or non. i ain't scared
---
&gt;We'd bever get annoyed over clan tags
---
Huh, people shit on people with FAZE, SoaR, Myth,OBEY, and Weed and stuff all the damn time
---
Lmao same!
---
Quitter bonus should be Sacrifice, not Deviousness.
---
I think they should be nerfing around Skill to kills.
---
Spirit was simply (and honestly will still be) way to easy for how deadly she was.
---
Obi things like nurse need to be nerfed, but honestly other then nurse and spirit, those are the only top tiers i can really think need decently large changes.
---
Misery, where I live, lol. Where only boys have opinions and happiness is not attainable because it was decreed from the top of the power structure.
---
Damn, this clip is from last year hallowed blight. why did you post it so late?
---
Lmao dude I‚Äôm just curious why you‚Äôre THIS buttmad over the whole thing.
---
Like, go outside or something. Get a hobby or get laid.
---
Just say you hate Japanese people and go üòÇ
---
I think if we were to get a samurai killer with a pole arm a yari would be more likely than a naginata, I believe in general they were a more common weapon. (Although I'm no expert on Japanese history so I could be wrong.)
---
Ohhhhh, I see. Yeah, I‚Äôm probably gonna stick to PC. I read quite a lot of complains about consoles each update, it seems to be getting worse.
---
Dwight mains are so entitled and delusional. Maybe there's no more totems left, ever think about that?
---
Plus she's using medkit there. Not self care. She can't save anyone if she's down as well. You expect her to stealthily save the Dwight first, which is ridiculous idea when she's the one who will get down too if she is still injured. Killer clearly used him as a bait to secure 4k.
---
I‚Äôm just hoping they don‚Äôt either nerf spirit more or aim for someone like Ghostface or Billy next. Spirit being good is just kind of inevitable because of what her power is, it‚Äôs never NOT going to be a guessing game. Her and nurse can both stay where they are as long as killers like bubba and Wraith get buffed up to probably a little bit under those 2.  The girls can stay the best, just make the others good
---
You know...balance doesn't mean fun sometimes, therefore, if you don't like something in the game, that doesn't necessarly mean it's not fair. But you are saying: it's not fun for me, so it needs to change, well...that's childish, if you ask me. Fun is subjective, what's fun for you might not be fun form me. What's you idea of "fun"? Running around circles for ages and taking the killer for 5 gens, a every killer is a basic one who can only M1? Well that's not fun for me. Let's just care about you fun i huees
---
I thought it‚Äôs a good fix
---
can I just do it again?
---
Pre nerf WGLF gave 200% extra BP though
---
That's definitely the truth.
---
what in the fuck? looks cool though
---
depending on rank, and opponents
---
Damn I will instantly main the new killer if they look like this, that design is fantastic
---
Love a good Circus throwback
---
Why would Freddy hide from Myers? I know people love Myers, but Freddy is stronger.
---
Evading a flashlight stun? Why does this have so many upvotes? Or is there a joke I‚Äôm missing?
---
I never said you would win or lose, I just said that they could make the game last long. 3 gen doctor is just like Forever Freddy, they are both capable of making the game last a long time if they choose to.
---
I just understand that a match that takes 20 minutes, or even 30+ minutes can feel unfun for all parties involved and both survivors and killers are capable of doing this, sure you might lose, you might win, who knows. But I doubt many people would have fun knowing they just spent half an hour in that 1 match.
---
I think they lied to us.
---
Does that mean it could be kind of like the bug that happened with the splinters a little bit ago? Because if that's so I'm quivering and hoping it happens to me, a poor boy from a poor family.
---
I started running detectives hunch to find al the chests and totems so they can‚Äôt say ‚Äúyou gen rushed me‚Äù

No safe unhook score event ever took place. In fact, it takes 15 seconds before you get the safe unhook score event to pop up to begin with. She farmed the fuck out of that dude with 5 seconds left to go and he DIED. No, 0, zip, nada safe unhook for that farming selfish care using scrub. The dumb bitch didnt even take a hit for him to make she he got out. In fact, she used the hit boost to ensure she got out. This has got to be the most selfish fucking game play I have ever seen on this sub.
---
/Babysitter in the Hole
---
well freddy relys on the victim's fear, myers is actually just evil incarnate so freddy holds no power over him. homie is short and has sharp nails, compared to tall myers
---
Gen speed is slowed down by perks, I think they‚Äôre trying to buff killers around the model of Billy for map control, I think the devs think Billy is the most balanced killer, Freddy and Demo are very mobile because of Billy‚Äôs blueprint, idk I prefer survivor to killer and have only made it to r12 with killer before but I like using corrupt intervention plus DH mixed with TOTH because it stops gens and adds a second objective that they're forced to do. 
---
What do you think about the possibility of them adding Ruin as a base perk? Good or bad idea?
---
Can you elaborate?
---
That's pretty much what Rancor can be used for, you just don't get to choose which survivor.
---
Looks dope! I like the way that the marker ended up bleeding in certain places. It gives it kind of like a texture look. Nice job
---
Only time I take ebony mories is to burn before prestige or when people have 4 medkits pre instaheal nerf.
---
Nw then. Idk why someone decided to. He‚Äôs making a new film next year called ‚Äòlast night in soho‚Äô can‚Äôt fucking waittt
---
Everyone talks about how annoying Doctor and Spirit and Legion are but Hag is number one on my shit list because they can proxy camp you and the only counter besides running around at the speed of snail is tied to an item you'd have to have knowledge of the killer beforehand to bring with you

It is absolutely imperative that you be able to choose which.

Most of the time they are toxic. Out of the two dozen ttv players I have ran into only one of them didnt flashlight click and teabag and was pleasant in post game.
---
Ah I find that to be my least favourite. However I like it but it‚Äôs the one film that doesn‚Äôt tailor as much to a general audience, defo aimed for comic book fan‚Äôs. Still quality though lol
---
At least that, yeah.
---
5 minutes is a loooong time to hook someone.
---
I feel yea. I bought all the killers and survivors so I could run whatever I so desired. Then I proceeded to meme build.
---
"streamers playing thousands of hours" - i hope you learn to read some day
---
It's common for toxic survivors to run DS so I guess you could let them DS you so you can mori them at the end of the match.
---
back in my day we could stack without being kicked out of our power
---
High ranks survivor is easier low ranks killer is easier. Solo survivor isn‚Äôt hard unless your team is trash.
---
Decisive strike =...
---
I don't have a gf so this is a totaly different case
---
Also, it happened a few days ago. And it was the only change

He's right. The tomes last forever but after those 50ish days then you wont get rift fragments for the quests, just blood points and lore.
---
Plugging you stream link in post game is the equivalent of plugging your stream link in chat in League.
---
Yeee
---
i second this. i love hooking altruistic survivors. i whoosh my spirit somewhere between the exit and the hook, wait to hear breathing or feet noises, and then casually go up behind them and hit them, then down them if they weren't already injured &amp; hook them further away. i've gotten all 4 survivors this way in so many games. i love EGC kills. and it lets them get a good amount of points by doing gens and totems and chases, etc, so it's still fun for them. sometimes i give the last person or 'nicest' person the hatch too.
---
Can you still unlock the little charm things?
---
Can't be exposed or broken if youre always broken to begin with
---
Base Freddy isn't actually that powerful. He has decent control over the environment and illusions, but you could physically beat him up like a regular man, even in the dream world. Freddy became powerful after he started consuming souls in the original series.
---
Reboot Freddy, the one in DbD, is less clear with his limits, especially if that cheap "he survived for no reason" ending is canon, but would still be inferior to Michael in the physical world, and it's not clear if Michael even truly sleeps.

You‚Äôre the one who keeps arguing a point no one is making.  Every reply I made and the original commenter‚Äôs post was about how a new killer/perks with ramp-up mechanics wouldn‚Äôt be released.  You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs obsessed with Dying Light.

Wait, really? Hitting A+D counters their struggles??
---
"Well, you kill enough people, sooner or later something's bound to make you immortal."
---
Your original comment had exactly to do with votes, which if you would take two seconds to process what I said, you would realize that your original comment fails to have logic.
---
Freddy is as tall as he wants to be, when you're in his world. And I imagine Myers being put in a situation where he is incapable of doing or hurting anything could stir some emotions
---
nvm, that makes much more sense then going after characters.
---
You're kinda late with this meme.
---
but this is literally what a perk is
---
Wow. This is such a good work.
---
I do when I have an Ivory, but you only level up characters you like to play, right? My Wraith stock is a bit sparse.
---
It's griefing and purely for bming, has no strategic value and is just to piss off the survivor/make the survivor feel bad
---
I really wish I couldn't relate to this
---
100% spirit. you dont even need perks and add ons if you're good, she's the best
---
Because Noed and instadowns means you can go from healthy to downed from 1 hit, and, Plague makes it so you can't heal past injured.
---
But with No Mither, you go down in 1 hit always, and you can never heal past injured.
---
It's just people meming saying that.
---
The scream when you eat her head will be always funny to me. It sounds like that scene from Lilo and Stitch when both Lilo and her sister scream with the face on their pillow.

No worries, they've said this year is all about the health of the game, so they won't just port the game to as many platforms as possible without making sure it runs acceptably well, and won't spend most of their time creating more monetization schemes. Optimization PASS will solve this.
---
That's not the point. It can still slow the game for survivors, it just requires you to apply the pressure.
---
THANK YOU, I'm sick and tired of people saying that it's bad for a perk to help you in a bad situation, that's LITERALLY what good perks do, perks that make you "win more" when you're already winning are pretty bad, not to mention unhealthy for the game.
---
Oh that‚Äôs great, honestly switch version runs so poorly, I really  am surprised they released the game in its current state
---
LMAO that's some 4th wall break type of shit.

As a rank survivor 18 survivor who always die first I can't relate.

Nothing, to this day fills me with glee and terrifies me at the same time as The Wraiths "DUF DUF DUF DUF" sprinting at me followed by his favourite song!
---
There is an unbannable way.
---
The addons are kind of a mess from go. Right now, Killers can often NEED addons to be competent, meaning the ones with bad addons just suffer. The most enjoyable addons seem to be "sidegrades," like Doctor's treatment range changes, Myers' T3 alterations, and...well, not Iri Head until it can't stack with 2 extra hatchets.
---
technically you could do this with that one glitch where you'd be stuck in the exit gate area and have to fall off the map and run to the other exit gate or the hatch to escape before the timer ran out!
---

NO

Actually i kinda always feel pink-hair Neas are the worst Potatoes that just bought Cosmetics for her after watching a single No0b3 video and disconnect if their techniques don‚Äôt end up working.
---
I think people are mostly saying not to run self care because well...it isn‚Äôt a good perk tbh
---
as a pink haired nea... i don‚Äôt trust flashlights.
---
insidious maybe?
---
Guys kindred is a bad perk design because it punishes killers for doing their objective - how you sound rn.
---
Perks that help you out in a bad situation are healthier for the game than perks that make one side win more just for winning, matches where one side is roflstomps the other are no fun.
---
I just throw the game to chase them because if I don‚Äôt learn it will just continue to happen. So Survivor, you might best me now but one day I will be strong enough to defeat you. Or not. Who knows honestly with the killer nerfs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ah thank you
---
Of course not. It‚Äôs not even a party without you. I need you.

At the risk of getting downvoted, I just want to clarify that it's still not an "infinite", it just takes a ridiculously long time to catch up so unless you have a 1-hit kill power/add-on/perk active it's basically not worth the chase.

But then again one of spirit's outfits has been having the same issue for over a year already (Not as extreme as this one but still)

I hope you learn how tho write someday. There was literally no reason to mention "streamers" on your comment. It adds nothing while at the same time tries to set "streamers" apart from regular players.

it's because they recently updated their graphics, which is bad, because of the way how this game is optimized is terrible.

In my own personal experience, I have never met a meg player that has actively participated in the game and didn‚Äôt throw themselves at the killer, just to DC on first down.

There are ways some could justify waiting at the exit gates. "I was waiting to see if my team went down so I could go back for them." "I was giving the killer last hit." There is no justification you could come up with for mori spamming. I don't know the point of trying to argue it with me when the devs are the ones who said it's bannable.

This game's pretty cartoony actually, yeah.  A bit disappointing, but it is what it is, I guess
---
Not the case at all. I legit have my teammates run the killer straight at me while I'm trying to do the objectives. Whether its intentional or they are just plane potato at the game it just urks me that I'm trying to do what they should be doing but end up getting screwed by them because they don't know where to go other then to another teammate hoping to shake the killer off on me rather then them.
---
Yes, that is correct :)
---
Need to take Perk: Hear No Evil. It grants you the good sense to just click "exit lobby" before anyone else has the chance to spew toxicity at you.
---
I mean it's the equivalent of a bubba face camping you, fair? Idk, but it's just the killer throwing the game to kill you, it's not that powerful to begin with so it doesnt deserve a nerf, theres not much you can do against killers who throw the game to tunnel someone
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs a lot for one game. $30 on top of $60 just to play that single game. And that‚Äôs assuming I get bored of the game and don‚Äôt play it for more than a year. Then I‚Äôd have to pay another $60. It‚Äôs too expensive to play one game, while on switch I actually play multiple games online and it‚Äôs at a reasonable price ($20 a year)
---
That's what I was curious on, if the time charms are always available
---
Nah the ultimate sin is failing a skill check while healing someone else, feels baaad
---
&gt;It says 52 days left, is that to complete the 2 current tiers, or all of the tiers?
---
You're referring to the challenges I guess? The tiers are what the levels of the rift are called. The challenges are part of the Tome. Tome 1 has 4 levels, 2 of which are out currently. The next two are due in 2 weeks and a month respectively. They are permanent, so you'll always be able to do them. 
---
The Rift is what is time limited. You have 52 days left to get all 70 tiers of the rift. This gives free rewards (like cosmetics and putrid serum), or you can buy the premium track and get the extra rewards (like more cosmetics and auric cells, enough to buy the next rift if you finish this one). 
---
In terms of grinding it, the challenges are your best bet. I play a shit ton but it's a real slog without getting the extra progress from challenges. 
---
In regards to the grind, survivor is your best bet. Exp is calculated based on time played. 1 exp per second, up to 600 exp per match, or 10 minutes.
---
You also get 300 bonus per day for playing each side, so ultimately the shorter queue times for survivor make it the better choice for grinding.
---
Not for one of them. One of them even says use a med kit and self care then heal yourself twice.
---
Ah thats awesome!
---
baby is a strange name for your fun parts
---
Just avoid the Killer then? If you want to run objectives make sure you've got perks that suit that. It sounds like you're not aware the killer is coming, so maybe use Spine Chill?
---
Instead of sashimi, y should be sushi üç£
---
Applying map pressure requires downing survivors I'm afraid
---
It was just weird, unfunny but most of all uncalled for. I didn‚Äôt downvote you btw but I can see why people did. Just take your L and move along a little more cautiously. No sweat.
---
I guess my sarcasm there was pretty subtle for anyone that wouldn't already be kind of disillusioned with BHVR and their development of this game. The "this year is all about the health of the game" statement was made roughly half a year ago, in the year 4 dev diary (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOtNQ60QaB8). But hey, that leaves them half a year to actually do healthy things!
---
I really doubt the ported versions will ever really run well. Their goal was to make them run at a solid 60fps, and I doubt they'd be able to make them run at a solid 30, i. e. without any drops, freezes, or stutters. Even the PC version performance has suffered again with the recent engine update, not to mention how some of the maps affect performance, such as the recent Stranger Things map. Hell, they've apparently hard-capped the game at 120fps, due to issues with how high framerates interact with their dedicated server architecture, which is obviously bad news for people that have monitors with refresh rates beyond 120Hz.
---
Because that's also a time challenge dingle berry
---
Stop being so damn cheap. $60 is one days worth min wage in a year. That's not a lot. Also, it's not a lot because as you can see, your Switch is shit compared to ps4 or xbox.
---
When you unhook the survivor they are standing up when they are unhooked I dont think you can prevent this without a flashlight
---
It's selfish for someone to not want to party with some who DC's, but not for someone who's likely to DC wanting to play knowing there's a high chance they'll ruin the fun for four other players? It's either both or neither. I get asked if I want to play basketball with friends, but most of the time I decline because I don't want to be the dude who leaves early due to work reasons leaving teams suddenly uneven. It's not a poor VS rich scenario, it's a scenario where you're literally pittimg your enjoyment VS four other people's. It's up to each person to decide on if it's worth it as we do all live in different situations but it's also not a free pass to do whatever you want without thought as to how you affect other people.
---
I can tell that you forgot to accept the challenge after completing it. Later gamer.
---
School nurse: just take some ice you‚Äôll walk it off.
---
God I *HATE* when survivors sandbag
---
I did forget lol but the next one is killer so it wasn't a big deal
---
Ps4 feels your pain. Whenever a skill check or whenever you're about to hit someone as killer it just sometimes shits the bed. Console optimisation when?
---
You can Cleanse before EGC just know when and where. Doing it far from the gens in the right moment can buy your team time to finish gens when she has to travel the entire map to go drink from that fountain.
---
I main ghostface so if they teabag I always excessively teabag them on the hook.
---
O don't cleanse until someone else does it. It's not worth it.
---
How long had it been since you worked on his blood web??
---
Maybe stop playing by an arbitrary rule set you've created for yourself. More importantly, don't expect others to play by that rule set. People get 4k's all the time despite adrenaline and decisive; if you're having trouble, the problem is you.
---
Makes sense because I am in a rural area
---
"doesn't count" what doesn't count? The point he got and the points the survivor lost? Tell that to the game.
---
I don't think I've ever seen an actual baby dwight in this game. Dwights are more often than not total monsters.
---
It's megs, clauds, and neas that are by far the most nooby. Meg by a longshot.
---
Neither do i tbh, but i don't see this post so much as hate towards furries, at least not in the same level as stuff you usually find in anti-furry subreddits. I did find this in r/furry_irl after all.
---
Im not against killers being able to take a similiar perk.
---
One thing that worked for me was gettin like really close to the guy, and when he starts movin to the sides you follow him with the camera and try to land a quick attack, the same trick works for baiting dead hard, anyways with practice u should be able to land some sick lunges, see top killer players, 360s don't work on them
---
You know that it'll just make people suicide on hook, it won't change anything.
---
Yeah I will get this done, but I don't will get the next one done and will not even try the next one. But I got my auric cells back and will spend it maybe on the 3rd or something.
---
But yes I hate the grind and I hope very hard they will change something.. but I don't think they will
---
It‚Äôs still fucking bullshit to the obsession as the only counter is to be immersed or just don‚Äôt do the gens, both of which I find bullshit
---
DBD on console doesn't have dedicated servers yet. You run off the Killers Wi-Fi
---
Eh, toxic survivors have the dumbest reasoning ever so that actually looks like something they would say.
---
[The original video] (https://youtu.be/xhMwi7mFa7g)
---
Yeah, he was an asshole and conversion therapy using shock torture was, unfortunately, really common in the past.
---
This is a pure delight, thank you
---
Resilience is not bad if you wanna do a semi injured build
---
I definitely wasn't expecting this
---
What you guys are talking about is the ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù said challenge. Yes, you can finish a Gen that was previously started by another. 
---
However, what I was saying was, when it says to ‚Äúfully complete‚Äù said challenge, that one will require solo completion.
---
The Claudette thing is so true though. God, I was playing a game as Hag last night and I grabbed a Claudette off a gen. I think it must have been a SWF because once I grabbed the Claudette, she DC‚Äôd, and then the rest of the team DC‚Äôd. And because it wasn‚Äôt at the very start of the match, I depipped.
---
The perk is activated. She doesn't need a totem. she literally just needs to step into the locker in front of her.
---
Why are they booing you? You‚Äôre right. Bunch of newbs have no idea what it used to be like.
---
Gonna cry?
---
That‚Äôs why you DC when you know there‚Äôs a Moro drop coming lmao
---
the killer can advance the state of the game as well, like wtf are you talking about? I'm sure your bias of thinking killers can't do a single thing and survivors auto complete gens in 10 seconds is messing up your thinking, but killers can literally halt games as well, infact it was just as much an issue of killers holding matches hostage just like survivors before EGC existed.
---
There are literally killer builds designed entirely around making the game slow down (which isn't a bad thing), but if the killer never capitalizes on it and just injures everyone and over patrols on gens without committing to downing or hooking anyone, the game is going nowhere and the survivors can't do too much about it, at least not quickly.
---
If she had her corrupt purge as her base power, I'd argue she'd be as strong or steonger than nurse. It's literally hunteress with infinte hatchets that are on a machine gun. When she gets that power for that time she's a fucking God.
---
To killers, infinites = loops that take forever by bruteforcing aka ironworks, haddonfield and sometimes ormond.
---
Actually if you use self care and get healed by anything you can complete the challenge, but I think you have to heal yourself a bit too, I don‚Äôt know.
---
If he's the last guy, hold W and don't cut corners wide. There are no actual infinites in this game, but if you mindgame yourself or run tiles incorrectly a lot of things can become an infinite. Following a survivor directly behind them and rounding corners slick will guarantee you catch up, cause pallets run out and windows can only be used 3 times in short duration.
---
How so? If I don't know there isn't a window there, I'm going to check that location
---
Still no idea what he's talking about, but this guy's growing on me.
---
If the survivor 360d you before get close to him, wait like half a second and then swing
---
Excuse me?
---
that‚Äôs why i always run spin chill. that or premonitionüëåüèæ
---
You fuck off. I love this game and I'm allowed to play it. I don't have to love every aspect of it. And I said I don't DC. I play the games through. So I'm not ruining anyone else's fun. So fuck off dickhead.
---
Back in my day we could combo stbfl with unrelenting to get no cooldown on atacks, and use a chainsaw at exchange of losing our body
---
You are forgetting that survivors that aren't on gens *are* prevented for the duration of TT. It doubles as a slowdown and a tracking perk.
---
That‚Äôs why I bought pharmacy
---
Oh for sure. That's how it works. It doesn't make it inherently good as far as design.
---
The iOS theme version is done, On November 20th I have to submit my theme example of the Android version to Samsung for them to approve it on their theme stores. Ive already finished it but waiting. Wish me luck.
---
Killer can only advance the game if he kills everyone or closes the hatch, and no, I literally only play surv because you can actually chill and have fun and killer is just by far too much stress. If you don't 3 gen yourself you still just can do gens, if he really camps gens hard just give him a good bait.
---
If you manage to clense in every fountain it resets them all to default.
---
There should be BP rewards in some of the empty slots. 50k or there abouts is a nice little boost to fill the slot and not exactly game breaking.
---
Good luck man! I'm really looking forward to see how it is going to be :D
---
I think I've seen this meme reposted more than anything on any other sub. We get it.
---
If you keep leaving early youll never how to deal with it.
---
Ummm, what are you talking about? You are free to dance in the killers face before the exit gates are powered, killers have to ignore you to get value out of the perk
---
Snort
---
yes that would be nice
---
Oh jesus do people even have a life in that sub? just leave people be and do your own thing
---
purge really isnt that strong. it still gets stomped by any form of los breaker, she gets a pretty noticeable slowdown when she charges it, and it has pretty pathetic range(for a ranged attack). nowhere near as good as hatchets in most situations. like the only time it's really better than hatchets is when you've got multiple survivors together. she's basically to huntress what lf is to billy: theyre incredibly similar but billy is gonna be super reliable and be better than leatherface 99% of the time because the only time his power is better than billies is in a very niche situation.
---
i agree, i really want them to touch wraith and LF next to make them viable
---
Ah yes that one. Thank you for your assistance
---
I usually solo q or play with my gf
---
Oh no, someone has an opinion, hold me, I‚Äôm going to faint!
---
Well they can shut the fuck up. You cant please everyone but you should atleast try to please the majority
---
Bigga
---
Fuckin' rude.
---
Dam, starts on my birthday. Cool present!
---
You thought it was a locker, but it was me, Dwight!
---
There is a very obnoxious loop I got done for in Lerys centre of the map with balanced landing. Its 2 different windows spots on top and I could never get where exactly the fucker goes. Also his friends thst died kept following me to give me a notification ping all game. Ended with 3 kills and that guy escaped.
---
Next game I got an ebony mori and 4k out of frustration.
---
God forbid people want a killer they cant see be more balanced.
---
Note: A user pointed out that this seems like hate content. I just wanna clarify that i didn't make this image and that i am totally against hate towards furries and homossexuals (i wouldn't hate myself that much), as well as homossexuality conversion shock therapy.
---
So you‚Äôre saying to counter the best slowdown build, you need to play as a 4swf all the time just in case?
---
yea im a strictly solo player as well. run bond and it will help with communicating that youre cleansing to your team(take them to the fountain and tbag it, they'll know what's up)
---
There was also one called brawl in the family you might be thinking of
---
I find "not respecting pallets" more useful
---
No I‚Äôm not OP. You aren‚Äôt the sharpest tool are you? Though you certainly are a tool
---
‚ÄúMeanwhile at another trial‚Äù
---
*spirit phasing noises*
---
Can someone pls explain how those symbols work when you are at rank 1?
---
Please elaborate now.
---
You already have a slow down I would go with enduring will get you hits on dumb survivors
---
I'm not sure if you played as or against stall killer builds at this point.
---
That still doesn't make sense to me. If you want to know EXACTLY when she's phasing; that literally reduces her power to "mobility" use only. Now that collision is gone there is literally no way to use it for mindgaming at pallets or during chases like before. (If you were to remove the husk and make her visible, I mean.)
---
Imagine running two one hits. Imagine running noed period
---
Makes it worse because I am in a rural area
---
that's pretty helpful actually. recently I've been a getting a lot of stealth killers so I'm running spine chill.
---
Or maybe people just like the way the cosmetic looks? I've never seen a single noob three video, whether that is.
---
Yes actually, that's what the rant flair is for
---
So you stand there literally all game, then?
---
What?
---
Both are perks that activate when you fail at defending the gens. One completely turns the tables in your favour while you're failing, the other simply gives you an extra hand at turning the game around with your own skill.
---
Pretty much
---
Theory time. Everyone is assuming that the killer's ability will deal with blood, and that could still be true, but I've also notice a theme of things reversing in both trailers.  The blood puddle in the first trailer, the glass in this one.
---
What if somehow the killer has an ability that allows him to revert back a few seconds in a chase or something of that nature? Sort of perhaps like Nurse's new blink add on but on a grander scale?
---
?
---
There are heaps of perks in Dead by Daylight at this point, and I think that we are missing out on some variety.
---
I think there should be some heavy testing but it might just work:
---
Five perk slots, yeah might be a little stuffed but come on we needs this.
---
What? In 643 levels I cant remenber one toxic dwight but i can remenber thousands of toxic megs , toxic neas  and for a long difference  toxic claudettes, god I hate the claudettes
---
Dedicated servers btw
---
Well if you want 30+ minute matches then sure go ahead
---
I mean, he was born in 57', so GF isn't wrong
---
We don‚Äôt.
---
i used to run spine chill alot too but i find bond to be a lot better. if you run bond you never have to run self care again, and you also get so much information from it. ive had many many times where i would not have finished a gen due to the killer being so close to me but i had bond so i knew he was on someone else and was able to comfortably finish the gen. it lets you know if someone is going for an unhook, it lets you know when a pallet gets dropped, it lets you know so many things that even if a 4man swf with coms you just would not find out otherwise. one of the best perks in the game imo, its severely underrated
---
Wow very useful and relevant info
---
He can't zap the gay out of me if i'm not gay
---
I think you got protection because you changed health state near another person so the game assumes oh took a hit for them because BHVR has spaghetti code.
---
I agree and im glad i know you didnt mean any hate by this post (which is pretty funny) as i always go by the motto that you should always accept people as long as they arent hurting anyone
---
I've seen no signs posted about not feeding the animals, I mean killers.
---
Imagine making fun of a rank 15 player who has had the game for a month or less
---
Tried it and it didn't help man, cheers anyway
---
Since this, after every match, an extra 1 has been counted towards my challenges. For the self care challenge I healed myself once and it counted as 2. I used 2 medkits and it counted as 3.
---
Opinions are like assholes. Most of us keep them to ourselves out of courtesy, some of us don‚Äôt mind sharing as long as others are open to it, but all of them stink, and when someone waves his around declaring his is the best and everyone else‚Äôs stinks more than his, that just lacks introspection.
---
She must be new or very confused then as they're two different inputs.
---
Elaborate or be terminated
---
Yes, I did. It's pretty much the only thing that gets played at red and, to an extend, purple ranks, since the killer just loses if they don't.
---
Discordance and go to town
---
Isn't this a scene from Joker
---
&gt;We'd never get annoyed over clan tags, so why is TTV such a sin?
---
Who's "we"? Lmao
---
Which countries is it banned?
---
Herbert West DLC? I'd watch that.
---
That worked. Can't believe I didn't realize. Thank you.
---
