Quentin mains are common compared to Tapp and Jeff mains

Which wouldn't be a problem if there was a separate queue/lobby for those people, but there isn't, and solo players get dicked because of it.

I‚Äôm a pig main too, defo favourite to play as killer. high five üôå

Playing survivor is fun and all but I like mixing it up you know.
---
Yo, while you're here since I rarely see you in my comments, how in the hell did you get your flair?
---
What's swf?
---
This guy is a moron. Killer red ranks is by far the most RAGE inducing swear fest i have ever faced. Survivior is only challangeing before you learn how to loop, and have the correct perks. But killer? God you have to have short chaseing and god forbid you tunnel cause you have to put pressure on the team before you lose against 4man tbaging object of obsession cucks
---
And Nancy
---
Because you could use 3 seconds of 150% speed at any moment whether you are injured or not so now instead of having DH where you would just make the pallet to drop it, you can use SB and not only make the pallet but actually loop the killer due to the speed. Why ever use DH if you could do this?
---
Pfffttt, all I get are the spirits, ghostfaces and huntress that had a terrible time and want to kill everyone all the time, I understand theres no mercy in 'killers' but....Cant you at least let me go ONCE
---

---
I play a lot of Trapper, and I use it because it looks very smooth.
---

---
Even if you bought a new weapon with shrads/cells, 90% of the choices are an ugly blade made of scrap metal.
---
Because sprint burst pretty much does give you hit protection if you use it correctly. You can force the killer to miss. I can't believe that anyone actually thinks this would be a good idea.
---
Dude don't listen to these survivors. If you were truly camping they should be blowing through gens. And the killer will only get a 1k if he lucky
---
what‚Äôs your preferred play style?
---
If this post really upsets people, I will take it down. I don't mean to upset anyone, I simply found this hilarious.
---
Let me guess: JenDenise?
---
Ruin is a must at higher ranks, then get bbq and chili, then for killers it‚Äôs really up to you and your play style
---
Yeah but you have to click dead hard early so it you don't get hit, even if it says its guaranteed it's not, Same will happen with sprintburst, Unless you're a stealth killer then theres no way you're hitting the person
---
Lol it was sarcasm from when I got dowbvoted to fuck for saying I message a killer gg bb ez killer every time they dc
---
Really not sure what it is with you two being so toxic. Have I done something to you in the past or is this just how you choose to interact with people? Dude asked for advice and I gave him some. If you don't like what I posted then why don't you take the advice of your last youtube clip instead of responding to me? Or maybe even offer up advice of your own and actually contribute since it seems like you only came in here to be a prick.
---
I use it as get me off the hook please I‚Äôm almost at stage 2 and all three of you are separately doing gens please no one is coming to me and the killer left right away please don‚Äôt let me go to stage 2 god I‚Äôll just kill myself‚Äî

Hey! I m not a killer main BUT I would def recommend checking out Otzdarva (or Not Otzdarva, same guy) on YouTube! He has loads of helpful videos and is super welcoming to newer/learning killers c:

It‚Äôs fine. You‚Äôre just not allowed to call out survivor bs here.

hello friends i help a baby dwight learn to do gens today. thank you behaviour for this experience
---
Thank you for your input. I knew that it was hard back in the day to prestige and i didn't really understand how hard. However, with this insight I can understand how a suggestion like this is insulting to those who truly worked for it.
---
Depending on the killer, corrupt is sometimes the better choice
---
No, won't say who, but browse the comments on any Dbd tweet and you'll probably find them with their biased opinions and disgusting insults to the devs.

Just play ghostface. I've been robbed of so many grabs but it's still far easier with him

Why did she not drop a link to her twitch?

Oh got it, thanks!

Do trap grabs actually count?

I am almost certain I know who it is then. Motherfucker told me to kill myself because i'm a killer main.
---
Salty salt. Your tears are so salty.

This describes xbox red ranks very well. Most of my mixer follows are high rank killers who played a good fair game. I play 4-6 hrs of dbd almost daily and see the same people as killers and surv. This is the reason I refuse to red rank killer. I need to play kinda scummy at high ranks and since I play mostly surv  I get matched with people who throw the game because the way I played killer against them.
---
Blame your team
---
Option A: Redesign Disturbed Ward, Coal Tower, Iron Works of Misery, Haddonfield, all Coldwind maps and all maps that can spawn hills.
---
Option B: Nerf one overused perk.
---
Hmmmmm, tough choice.
---
No one cares
---
Honestly, it's the most fun way to play.
---
I enjoy when my usual SWFs are getting peeked by Ghostface, they are so verbal it's hilarious.
---
It‚Äôd be actually insane. So many god tier loops would be ever more busted

Ah, you‚Äôre that Aussie lol.

---
IMO you should always start with a 115% M1 killer like Trapper or Wraith (Wraith being my personal recommendation for new killers). Two main reasons for this. One, it‚Äôs pretty easy to understand their play style so you won‚Äôt get overwhelmed. And two, since 115% M1 killers are the most basic killers in the game, once you get good with them you shouldn‚Äôt have problem with learning the other killers. If you take a killer like Spirit or Huntress for example they‚Äôre very unique and may take awhile to learn. Then because they‚Äôre so unique you may find that they‚Äôre play style doesn‚Äôt translate to other killers so you can have difficulty learning them. 
---
If you can win with Wraith you can win with anyone. Learn him first (or at least an M1 115% killer), and you will be able to learn the more unique killers much more easily.
---
As for perks, don‚Äôt worry about it too much right now. The grind for perks is a long one, just focus on getting good at a killer or two for now. Then once you‚Äôre ready you can start to think about perks, you‚Äôll probably want Hex: Ruin and BBQ &amp; Chili to start.
---
dude, I gave up trying to argue with them. People like this give the community a bad rap. If you have so many problems with this game, stop playing, don't insult other players or the Devs.
---
how does that help?
---
Because rank is equivalent to skill
---
Alot of those wwere just the killer swinging though a window which...all killers .. can do...
---
Very interesting, thanks for the tip. (Now survivors will know what the word pain means muahahah).
---
He locker juked a billy who can‚Äôt just cancel chainsaw, then just ran through a pallet. 
---
Not sure why he even posted this like it‚Äôs impressive.
---
lol yes.
---
If you're complaining about this change, you're a camper.
---
I doubt switch has a large player base for it to select from then you factor in things like rank the pool gets even smaller.
---
Speedo Bubba will be tier 999

Or..grooooovvyyyy? Its hard to convey Chop Top's voice over text..
---
&gt; By the way, you do realise SWF is pretty much the sole reason this game is even alive at this point, right? Because without the "forced addition of SWF," this game would have died before the end of 2017. Without question.
---
Oh well, c'est la vie. The world would have kept turning. Maybe next time beHaviour would place their game better in the market, or make a game the market actually wanted at the time.
---
&gt; This game doesn't need to bend to your will.
---
Never said it did, should or would. People can state their opinions on things without ever expecting something to change because of it.
---
I mean, I bought this game as well, I want to have fun too. Ruining everyone else's fun for your own sake makes you an asshole, no matter how effective it is. It's possible for both sides to play fair and have fun. I do it when I play killer, I don't camp or tunnel even if it'd be advantageous. Everyone gets lots of points, I get a 2k-3k and the only messages I get are from people saying gg and thanks for the fun game. Everyone walks away having had a good time. I don't know why it's so hard to treat the other side as human.
---
Favorite killer play is the Trap Daddy. Favorite killer aesthetic wise though is spirit.
---
Favorite survivor? Well I mean it‚Äôs obvious since everyone knows Feng is the best
---
I just dropped the last person on a gen and grabbed them off of it. I gave them the hatch for the help :)
---
I want this skin so badly.. it's so cute and why are they don't bring it to the game?
---
I was pig on shelter woods and got the obses on death hook but found them again so I left to chase someone else. Later when I was walking up to patrol a gen they run up to me and I just didn‚Äôt have the heart. Apparently they were grouped with some other people in the trial so now everyone was running up to me and memeing, but I still had my challenge to do. So once the last gem got activated while all 4 people are still alive I open the exit gates and down one on death hook and sacrifice them. Then blood warden activated and the three others still didn‚Äôt fully know what was going on. I saw them pointing to the blocked off exit. Using stbfl, all the other three are down before they could understand and I get to hooking. I felt so bad I only hooked two and let the other two go. It was by far the meanest thing I‚Äôve ever done in this game if by any chance this was you I‚Äôm so sorry. No one even said anything in the post game not even some flaming. I‚Äôm so sorry.
---
you know how easy it is to complete the third level? you dont have to do ALL the challenges to get to the end and get the charm. i think its like 7 or so challenges needed to finish the level
---
Well, you don't HAVE to but it certainly helps a massive amount, depending on if the hatch has spawned or not and where it spawned if it has, you could just close it first and then leave it down to the doors that are easy to guard with iridescent head huntress.
---
but again, this was low ranks iridescent head, infantry belt, ebony mori huntress with all meta perks, it was one of the sweatiest builds you can find and the slugging was just the cherry on top. And just to be clear: I don't mind slugging for the 4k that much, since I understand it is *almost* necessary for a 4k with the way the hatch works right now, so it wasn't that surprising that a huntress this sweaty was slugging for it, but it still added to the massive pool of sweat

Mike might give you a prostate exam. Be careful!

Like the way it has to specify "with his hands"...

Oh no

Calm down bud. I don't know who you are, I just responded to your comment. He asked for tips specifically, and you gave him the general "Just play". Pretty unhelpful. It wasn't the only thing you said, but I didn't respond to the rest of your comment. Don't post in a public forum if you can't handle someone not instantly agreeing with you.
---
but how would he figure? the rift has a full vial with pinkish fluid in it. not sure where this vial is from
---
—Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –Ω–∞ –≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–º —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–µ
---
Yeah.
---
They'll fit in with everyone here then.
---
Yeah, but it's not not camping if you won't chase farther away, check gens, and always run back to the hook in the time you think it takes for survivors to make it to the hook, every single time.
---
It's not 5brain plays, you're not literally not letting anyone newe hook, it's not fun, and it's fucking boring as shit that the counter play is to gen jockey the entire game away and depip because you can't get chase time, stuns, or saves.
---
These posts always get multi thousands of points, but far too many killers think of they don't face camp, then they aren't camping the hooks.
---
I had multiple people yesterday on survivor, whole literally just trying to get archives done, stop chases only meters from the hook and turn around to get the kill. You're not smart. You're camping.
---
I switched back to killer so I could relax.
---
Youi/Oni on dec 3rd Xmas stuff on Dec11th, if that effects ur decision
---
At low ranks no, at high ranks I usually get this one dude in my lobby every 2 to 3 games.

Nope

What this is the vial at the end of the rift it‚Äôs a pustule vial

Hillbilly is gonna get the bunny sweater

Yeah he was playing with Hexy last night and calling every killer dog shit in end game chat.

Cause the way cosmetics are handled currently won‚Äôt allow that since the head would clip a lot

THE GAME IS CURRENTLY KILLER SIDED, SO MANY SURVIVOR MAINS ARE NOW RAGE QUEUING KILLER. WHY PLAY A GAME OF HEX HUNTING AND SKILL CHECKING WHEN YOU CAN HOLD W AND FUEL YOUR EGO WITH CONSISTENT 4KS.

This is so nice it almost makes me ignore your questionable username

He‚Äôs not a survivor main

Freddy, Myers, and Claud

Lmfao

Learning how to mindgame is a big part. Helps end chases really quick. Also learn when to drop chases. No point in chasing a really good survivor all game while the other three do gens.

Facts
---
Nea and huntress.
---
If i had to chose more then it would be billy/wraith and kate, ace, and dwight.
---
What rank is that?
---
Some people really do play enough to grind it out while others bought their way through.
---
I imagine I'll hit 70 by Christmas myself.
---
No the next update comes out on Tuesday December 3rd.
---
I saw a few players in the first week of the Rift release who already had items from around level 40/50 and even came across one who had the Vial. Also i‚Äôm currently at level 60 and only halfway through Tome level 3 so most regular players will be completing it around now.

Imagine that they're just Facetiming each other.

Frank: "Yo, Julie. Where the hell are these nerds? I found a Claudette, but the others are missing."

Julie: "I see a Dweet in a locker. He hasn't moved from it in a while. Want me to get him for you?"
---
Frank: "Nah, just keep an eye on it for me."
---
Joe: "These guys are so fucking stupid. Like, they KNOW we can see them, right?"
---
Susie: "Maybe they're just not used to all of us here, right? Hey, Frank, there's a Meg bolting straight for you. Probably to get Claudette."
---
Frank: "Thanks for the heads-up, Susie. All right, gang. Stay sharp."

There is a difference between disagreeing with someone and posting some passive aggressive reply. I'm totally fine with people disagreeing with me, but your reply didn't contribute anything, it was kind of rude, and it ignored most of what I said. 
---
I don't want to turn this into a bigger thing than it already is, but I wanted to let you know why I took issue with it since you gave me a real reply. Before that I was starting to think you were trolling.
---
Probably playing with friends. The core gameplay is exciting as long as you aren‚Äôt playing against a killer that negates your experience as a survivor, which is an ongoing problem, but the pros currently outweigh the cons
---
Then god save his soul
---
He just likes survivor salt which tbf many people enjoy even other survivors
---
It keeps you constantly on your toes and there are different play styles survivors can adopt. Killers are just fun to use and them combining various perks on both survivor and killer, to me, are game changing because you get to figure out new combinations and techniques that help you get out of a bind / bully or tunnel / make you an apex predator.
---
...Or killer bs, for that matter. Lets face it, both sides have a VERY vocal minority.
---
Why wouldn't you just claim the challenges and not spend the bloodpoints?
---
I run Prove Thyself most of the time, if nothing else for the BP. Stake Out is still nice since I'm not one to hit the Great Skill Check every time, but usually another perk is better.
---
Doctor and Jake
---
I got help from a random streamer, luckily he was in a SWF so he let me complete it if I didn't attack one of the people he was surviving with
---
I didn't think to do that to see who the killer is.  Good to know!
---
You could've at least given the poor man a hit :(
---
Yeah I‚Äôm really glad there‚Äôs going to be penalties next patch because of this. It makes solo survivor so difficult when people DC when they get downed first against some low tier killer like Doctor
---
Ace and Clown, I currently main both.
---
Oh people do this. Theyre called whales and theyre the reason why Triple A games implement these F2P monetization tactics into their game. Because they know for a fact that people will spend $50 just to complete it.
---
This is calling to me. Thank you
---
Not only are they wrong they're flat out stupid
---
What do you struggle most with? First you have to identify the problem. Are you losing chases often? Not pressuring generators enough? Having trouble finding survivors in the first place? The more you climb the more you become dependent upon certain perks unfortunately. I main Ghostface and he‚Äôs my favorite killer. Once I got to about rank 10 or 11 I stopped being nearly as effective until I started running Ruin and Thanatophobia. I had a really hard time pressuring gens up until that point, and even if I was winning chases I would still end up losing the match. I say play to your killer‚Äôs strengths and let the perks cover your weak points. That should help you climb.
---
The devs also said to not take those stats as if they meant anything. :)
---
Probably? Lol they 100% did.
---
There‚Äôs always that person that plays survivors will swear up and down it‚Äôs camping even if the killer sees the whole team standing there.
---
Nice.

That‚Äôs my point. The Billy didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. He can‚Äôt cancel the chainsaw. He swung through the pallet. And he should‚Äôve gotten the hit at the window.

This man also thinks that lunging attacks should be removed and campers and tunnelers should be permanently banned.

That‚Äôs a Pok√©mon. (Thanks though)

Im a rank 1 killer on xbox so we've probably tussled before lol

Ok guys, so now we have to tweet a picture of this comment right? That's how the circle is completed right?

"Hey"

Inner strength. Bust out gens and find bones on your way to next gen. Don‚Äôt go searching for them all game

This is one of the first videos I ever made. I'm just getting used to editing and tried to have a bit of fun, hope you like it lol
---
Mamma mia marcello
---
Yeah since its so easy to rank up as survivor, Im sure others stop caring as much vs some killers if they're not swf after they hit rank 1, i know i do.
---
I find that ranks 5-10 are usually the 'better' teams as they are likely trying harder/more to do good and rank up.
---
It's such a power move on the killer's part. They're showing that they are in control
---
Hit red ranks ONE time, I am never doing that shit ever again. Made me fucking HATE the game.
---
I know the guy who wrote this, I'm going to send him this link.  He'll think it's hilarious!

Keep the change.

speaking of DC, that's Doctor Fate. op is a genius
---
Take my strong hand child
---
And they don‚Äôt even draw the dicks good either smh
---
Ghostface is the only killer who enjoys being in the realm of the entity.
---
Honestly this is the way deep wounds/BT should have always worked. Not to mention Legion is going to abuse the hell out of the Oblivious status effect next patch if they don‚Äôt change the functionality
---
Yes, playing with friends exist in every single multilayer game even games like DBD where they can do absolutely nothing about it at all to stop people but then again **it's not designed to be played like that at all** so why would enable something that takes away from the game?
---
There are perks that allow you to do what you ask in some part but maintain the core of the survivors, these types of ideas are honestly would ruin the game and make survivors OP beyond belief and this is coming from a survivor main. Knowing what people are doing across the map without a perk is something that is too easy to Gen rush and move the game quicker and killers are at a disadvantage.
---
Saying oh give the killer something then leads us to the point of why bother doing it anyway because what is it going to add to the game? It's a waste honestly
---
Edit: you're suggesting a major change in the entire game because there is a relatively smaller amount of people SWF and talking with one another is my point
---
Perks like empathy and bond would be useless, survivors would become way more efficient doing gens, healing and going for saves.
---
Killers would be hit with serious amounts of uncontrollable pressure if chases persist to long against non-swf.
---
made with mematic

I have literally over 400+ brown Add-Ons for Hag that I am never going to use.

---
Maybe the devs could do something like this but recolour legacy to red so it‚Äôd be similar to the endgame collapse. They could also keep your idea of colouring the prestige icon but make it red. This would keep the people who own the og legacy from feeling ripped off since they worked so hard for it back in the day
---
I think they should create a new mechanic for this cosmetic and future cosmetics where if you put on the torso it also forces you to wear the matching head piece because I don‚Äôt see another way of solving it
---
Lol, where are the survivor stats? I only see killer picks stats. Where's the variable of Survivor survival %?
---
Pretty sure there's crossplay between those two platforms, you might need to enable it in your settings.
---
Not every single game has a SWF team on it. Every single game does have generators. The killers need to see the gens‚Äô locations as it is their main goal to stop survivors, but by not giving the survivors‚Äô locations, it at least gives them a place to start looking. 
---
The game itself is about surviving by doing generators and saving each other. A survivor can not see others‚Äô healthy or injured auras for this reason, as it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for them to be able to see it, as that‚Äôs not their primary goal. That is also why a survivor can see a hooked survivor and downed survivor, as THAT then becomes their objective in order to keep themselves at an advantage above the killer.
---
This is unpopular indeed, and for good reason, as it would be game breaking. A killer needs to see gens to get an idea of where to go, a survivor does not because they‚Äôre meant to be lost and wandering aimlessly to find generators or each other.
---
I understand the desire for a mechanic like this, but comparing the ability to see every other player‚Äôs aura on a team that greatly outnumbers the other to the ability to see the other team‚Äôs main objective is not a fair comparison whatsoever. Also, with so many perks that allow this, I don‚Äôt understand how adding this in would be fair or balanced in any way whatsoever.
---
Edit: another negative factor would be the unfortunate incident where survivors then sabotage each other. I know, rare occurrence, but people can be toxic.
---
Still a dangerous game your playing. IIRC BHVR said that they would not unban you if EAC does end up banning you due to these.
---
It is easy to get in a single match.
---
Step 1:  Find and down survivor.
---
Step 2:  Carry survivor to gen and whack gen.
---
Step 3:  Drop survivor.
---
(Repeat Steps 1-3 until they start working on gen)
---
Step 4:  Yoink Survivor.
---
Step 5a (toxic):  Hook survivor
---
Step 5b (nice): Let survivor go and kill other survivors
---
agree agree upboats over here &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ninja bad
---
I just stay chill and switch in-between killer and survivor until I get bored of playing it and go and play something else. They key to liking the game is actually putting in some hours into it (I know that's basically for every game but it's key in dbd) and playing with friends and not raging.
---
So still the same killer just with a very very slight buff to his m1 game
---
That's sad that this is the determining factor
---
Yes
---
Maybe due to people disliking the map they took the offering off?
---
It's pretty far after rank reset, so there aren't many active players at low ranks.
---
Actually, real talk. But wearing green fabric bands around your arms/neck so the green screen makes them transparent would have been a nice touch
---
Half the time I miss it's because the check blends in with the background.
---
not even a question, inner strength all the way. way faster heals and it possibly prevents noed
---
Trapper pushes the survivor to the ground and cleaves them in the shoulder, kicking their face to dislodge his weapon. 
---
Wraith grabs the survivor by the neck and beats their head against the bell.
---
While most of the comments disagree, the fact is that steps are this are going to be a *necessity* if BHVR sticks to their goal of bringing parity to the SWF and solo experience. Information sharing between players in parties and solo players will happen sooner or later. 
---
I don't give a fuck if they have to give killers 5-6 perks to make up for it.
---
What? That hit should never connect after that vault lmao
---
Im not against something like this is long as they then balance the game out for the killer because a reason why killer does good is because survivors aren't always on coms and thus not optimal with gen time vs save time, so they waste time. The reason why swf does so good is because of this lack of wasted time with survivors doing the same thing, ie one hook save or all looking for totems, with the game being more solo oriented.
---
It would definitely bridge the gap more but the game already has balance issues, some from the disconnect. But a swf like basis would definitely make it a bit better in aims of competitively balancing the game.
---
People who have their entire Steam Profile decked out with ‚Äútoxic‚Äù screenshots/artwork, purposeful little annoyances/quips written on their Bio, and fighting back with people who comment on their profile instantly get blocked.
---
I don‚Äôt understand playing a game with that kind of mindset. Thats either severe mental illness, or someone with very low self-esteem on a power trip from playing like an asshole. Which seems to happen a lot with Killers/Survivors.
---
Since failing a skill check regresses progress towards that action, and regression doesn't subtract from your total, you can get more than 1 full heal out of an injured Survivor.
---
Ghostfaces are usually really toxic or really fun (no inbetween)
---
Comments like this serve literally no purpose in furthering anything even approaching a conversation, the fact that this has any upvotes is dumb.
---
So when he presses the button he just does a swing of the chainsaw or is it just that he gets to do that with pallets
---
He does a swing when you press the button. It's slightly delayed; like a lung attack.
---
Nah.  2 of these perks only affect that killer specifically. Perks are supposed to be compatible with every killer. A killer whose power has a high chance of actually helping survivors would be the worst killer. A perk that reads auras in a locker, that thing lockers specifically prevent, is a bad idea. 
---
Not trying to be harsh, but some of these are absolutely busted.
---
Those stats should really be taken with a grain of salt, those things are really easy to interpret at face value but there are several underlying factors that make it less clear.
---
It's not a gif dummy

---
I've had it happen before and you have to gentap all game or be in chase, you can't see skillchecks or anything. I just reset after to fix it
---
I walked..WALKED into a trap I saw earlier today. My brain didn‚Äôt register in time. Killer downed me, closed the hatch in front of me. Faked letting me escape. Hooked me and stood in front and nodded. 
---
My message to him?: ‚Äúhey your angel was wrong. Look a lil to the left next time‚Äù
---
He was happy
---
Not super related to the post but i've never related more to someone
---
This was what dbd looked like upon release
---
No fix, it just sometimes happens.
---
Still seems like a bad killer even if he has the power to break pallets at 1.5 seconds over the 2.6 base break speed he is still a pretty base m1 killer that is going to struggle just as much against good survivors.
---
lol Yes, you can keep your 'right' to dc and be an asshole, doesnt mean it affects op's point, at all.
---
so you keep dc ing and deny them some points, oh boy, but then they get the archive point for you being a poorer sport than them anyway is the point.
---
Spirit fury?
---
Rank 1-3
---
yeah, when it was just white? Extremly bright white
---
Always played in the dark, then had burn marks in my eyes after that fucking nea.
---
Quite possibly the last thing this community needs
---
Imma be honest, i saw a survivor do that to a baby freddy and he was running over to the next pallet. I droped the shack pallet infront of him and he killed himself afterwards.
---
Deserved imo
---
Not really,depends on who is playing. One might also argue survivor is easy cuz they need to either throw pallets or just press m1 the whole game to do gens.‚Äùone can be chased the whole game while the other 3 can do gens. ‚Äú-TrU3Ta1ent 
---
Thou it is the sad truth when you go against a coordinated swf. Killer is easy and hard at the same times depends who you start with.one can easily wreck a wraith if they have spine-chill and throw down the pallet early if he‚Äôs uncloaking near and one can also potato if they are just blind  and don‚Äôt hear the ding-dong.Killer can potato too . Like example trapper for instance , the difference is a good trapper will trap at sides of loops and bad one just in front of the pallet yeah...A good trapper will start to pressure survivors and set a few traps before hand and a bad one will take a whim and trap all the edges of the map and by the time he‚Äôs done poof gens are done . It‚Äôs not only about being bad the killers power a killer can get locked juked by survivors of they just loose line of sight for a few seconds , good ones can‚Äôt .
---
They could just make it so when the torso isn't paired with the head, the hoodie is shown down/off from the torso piece. When both are applied to Head + Torso then the hoodie is shown up.
---
Ruin is incredibly useful, but it isn't needed. I've hit red ranks never using it, and when you hit red ranks its usefulness begins to fall off. If survivors hit red ranks they're usually able to get great skill checks regularly or they know most of the ruin spawn locations. It's the most effective in low ranks, but still good in high ranks.
---
This was during a practice game with my friend. I could see both doors while standing in one spot at end game, effectively making her opening the door impossible. This needs to be fixed.
---
I think he means SWF, which isn't possible between Steam and Windows store players.
---
They could make it work by just having her not wear the hoody, and have the head part hanging on her back
---
red ranks lmfaooo
---
Of course, playtesting this would be the ultimate conclusion but that'll never happen. 
---
And like half the Killers in this game struggle against good Survivors but that's just a balancing issue.
---
I typically end up getting one or two hooks, by the time they are saved 2-3 gens are done and by that time my fate is basically sealed lmao
---
Both sides are easy but at times we lose our common sense and potato at times and lose the game be it a survivor or killer .
---
Never underestimate the power of the puppy eye technique
---
Man normally I'd be so down, but when I'm prepared to. This was just sheer panic vs Pig
---
Dude I tried telling them to play both sides before they form and opinion. But this person just went on and on about how broken the game is and why killers are op.
---
They need to make more cosmetic slots. Simple.
---
I see what your trying to do and it is hard because most killers have some fatal flaws that make them bad at high ranks but this change just isn't worth the effort as even if implemented it wouldn't boost bubba up much if any in playablilty
---
A soul for a soul
---
Who is it , I really wanna know .
---
NOED is short for the perk called No One Escapes Death. Generators with yellow auras are because of various conditions with perks. Red ones are normal.
---
It means it made his arms strong.
---
it's not murder if he fucked your mom
---
I guess his fate is locked to
---
"Gimme BBQ and goodbye"
---
ohh i didnt even realize it counted it like that. good to know thanks!
---
not gonna say, but you'll probably find them spewing shit in any comment section of a dbd tweet.
---
Had me up until the last word.
---
It means it's imperical, and not opinion.
---
Pretty much I would have no clue where to even start to change him while keeping his power. The main issue with him is that he has so little map pressure and his one hit is unreliable at best
---
NOED is just a abbreviation for the Perk No One Escapes Death. A Perk that allows the killer to down any survivors in one hit once all the generators have been completed, its a Hex perk, a perk attached to those skull totems you see around, as such if you can find its lit totem and destroy it it will no longer work, however it will only light up once all the generators are done, you can also stop it by just destroying all totems on the map before endgame.
---
No Yellow and Red gens have no mechanical difference, some maps just use yellow generators on indoor sections.
---
Not exhaustion. Hindering slows movement speed. They can still dash. But I relish those moments when they‚Äôre slowed, take a hit, and double back into the cloud. Kills their speed boost immediately.
---
Inner Strength. Its faster for heals.
---
Downside being that you could rob your team from altruistic points, you need a totem (there are 5 active on every map), your prone to being found by a reloading Huntress or Iron Maiden, and it could be situational. 
---
Pros is that you could be hidden from BBQ, its very fast and you could get out of a chase and back in as fast, and you can pair it powerfully with other locker perks
---
Yes it's an issue with dedicated servers. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
---
&gt;but then again it's not designed to be played like that at all...
---
But yet the feature is in the game. And unlike other multiplayer games, there's an easy solution. 
---
&gt;these types of ideas are honestly would ruin the game and make survivors OP beyond belief and this is coming from a survivor main.
---
HOW!? 4-mans have existed since the begining of the game and no one is saying that they're game breaking. But I give an idea to bring solo's to somewhat of a closer level to 4-man and that's OP? You don't know what you're talking about.
---
&gt;Knowing what people are doing across the map without a perk is something that is too easy.
---
4-mans exist. They give this exact info without sacrificing a since perk slot. But that's fair, sure.
---
There. I included both.
---
I single out Killers specifically because they are the only side that can ‚Äúdelete‚Äù people from the game and stop them from having fun, like being hook-camped to death or Mori‚Äôd/tunneled after the first chase. If a Killer wants to be an asshole, they will.
---
Das good shit. Ive been waiting for a pokemon Pallet Town joke
---
Red generators are the default aura colors for the generators when you have no perks that change the generator auras.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Perks that change the aura colors and what it means:
---
* Discordance, which means 2 or more  survivors are working on a generator together, lasts 8/10/12 seconds (Don't know fully how it works tho). Yellow aura and sound notification
---
* Corrupt Intervention, the 3 furthest generators from where the killer spawns are blocked for 80/100/120 seconds. Blocked gens get a white aura.
---
* Thrilling Tremors, when you pick a survivor up the generators not being repaired are blocked. Blocked gens get a white aura.
---
* Surveillance, regressed gens are highlighted by a white aura. When the regression is interrupted, the generator gets a yellow aura for 8/12/16 seconds.
---
Edit: On some maps, the generator is yellow and on others it's red.
---
Muahahaha I see I‚Äôve struck a nerve toxic cunt many have fallen to my blade and many have sent hate mail
---
They‚Äôll never balance around high rank. They‚Äôll continue to balance around rank 10. Literally no point to play red rank games anymore. 
---
Purple rank killer is the best because survivors actually try to mindgame and loop rather than hump OP structures. 
---
And purple rank survivor is better because you‚Äôll see a different killer than spirit.
---
New fighter pack looks promising
---
Says the no mither.
---
How's that infinite recovery working for ya? I bet you just love using that.
---
How can you tell if they‚Äôre SWF? Is there a tell?
---
Lord forgive me for what I‚Äôm about to do
---
Survivors can stop killers having fun if they harass them non stop. It works both ways.
---
My idea is basically like taking Tylenol for a broken leg.  
---
It's a bitch to fix and this won't fix it but at least it's something to slightly numb the pain.
---
dont stay out we need major influences to bring more people into this game
---
What about different types of Hex ? Do they have to be lit totems as well because I just been cleaning one totem and called it a day.
---
There's also perks that change the color of the aura for specific reasons. White for blocked or regressing, yellow for a survivor working on it.
---
Just no
---
&gt;Perks like empathy and bond would be useless
---
I mentioned above that the would need to be changed.
---
&gt;Killers would be hit with serious amounts of uncontrollable pressure if chases persist to long against non-swf.
---
Solo's would have the same, if not still a limited advantage compared to 4-mans, especially since they still cannot communicate.
---
Simple! Do two models for it, one with the hood up one with the hood down. Use hood down when interacting with other cosmetics.There's already characters with hoodies so hood down isn't an issue. Have the bunny hood as a separate cosmetic that's just a bunny hat type thing. And when worn together switch to the model with the hood up..... or just lock the player out of putting on a head cosmetic while worn
---
The devs are making this way harder than it needs to be.
---
As long as there's no shaggy, I'm good
---
Slugging is tOxIc and I have to deal with survivor mains salt afterwards. Or they have unbreakable and then fuck me because I literally can't do shit
---
Yes... operation health fixed stuff....
---
Here, have a chocolate honey.
---
Did you try to turn it off and on again?
---
Ya because that's stupid. Straight up, just dumb.
---
Agreed.
---
damn, poor soul paid 100 bucks for Dweard head
---
You sure you haven‚Äôt already over stalked that survivor and used all of their evil?
---

maybe not as simple as you imagine

---
&gt;Not understanding how I'm saying you're backpedaling and say it's illogical.
---
&gt;Proceed to ignore direct statements from the devs because of head canon
---
&gt;logic.exe not found
---
Not sure why I'm replying at this point, but there it is.
---
You're just continuing to justify why you say it's cheating because of some sort of bizarre mental looping to make yourself still be right.
---
&gt;(I mean, they could just have the game refuse to run/matchmake when voIP programs are running, but there's the whole phone issue rendering that kind of moot, anyway).
---
Which literally no game has done ever that I know of, at least not one that lived past infancy. Not to mention they'd have to compile a list of every progr- Oh wait Discord can be run in your browser.
---
&gt;Regardless, just because something isn't explicitly written against, doesn't mean it doesn't go against the intended spirit. Clearly, the game is supposed to be played commsless, and so clearly, anything that works around that goes against the intended spirit of the game.
---
&gt;Otherwise known as: Cheating.
---
Face camping also goes against the spirit of the game. Is that cheating?
---
Teabagging goes against the spirit too, is that cheating?
---
Tunneling goes against the spirit of the game, is that cheating?
---
Farming BP goes against the spirit of the game, is that cheating?
---
Chasing the killer around with flashlights in a group goes against the spirit of the game, is that cheating?
---
Your stance is as absurd as the above statements. The devs have definitively stated *it is not cheating.* This is *not* some opinion. It either is or isn't. They have stated it is not.
---
Nah shaggy is the killer
---
Did you put it in rice?
---
I doubt it have you ever made a game? The point is all cosmetics have a skeleton same with models so it‚Äôs a lot harder to make a brand new skeleton that wouldn‚Äôt mesh well with models the only other characters with a hood are the legion but all their cosmetics don‚Äôt change
---
&gt;Not every single game has a SWF team on it.
---
Every since game does have Survivors, and SWF's does exist.
---
&gt;This is unpopular indeed, and for good reason, as it would be game breaking.
---
So 4-mans get unlimited information on where everyone is, who's being chased, and where the objectives are, but giving solo's the same advantage would be game breaking? Makes sense.
---
It'd worthless from tomorrow right when the patch releases?
---
Scrappy doo from the live action movie
---
I had that door placement against an Iri Huntress a few days ago. 
---
3 of us were alive when gens were done, and only I escaped via the hatch in the end.
---
I'm of the opinion that doors should spawn on opposite sides of the map on all maps. Lerys does it best.
---
Honestly, the game keep getting balanced for the weaker survivors, that makes higher ranks more similar when it comes to wanting win, ie same perks. builds
---
This always happens to me
---
Thank you for the reply, finally something I can work with.
---
But to be honest I just think that people dont see what I actually meant with that. Mightve also just been me not explaining it properly tho.
---
The thing is that the penalty will only go for people who actually dc. However this obviously doesnt work for people who suicide by attempting kobe's and not struggle at all, resulting in a almost as fast quit of the game as a dc, which will be the next "strat" for players that want to quit games in a selfish manner without being punished. Removing the free suicide option frpm the 2nd hook phase will keep them in the game, so they cant bypass the penalty without being forced to stay in said game longer than they want to. It's a simple manner of "making abusing of the queue penalty less easy" , not more and not less. And honestly? In my opinion it IS a issue when they're putting up queue penalties in order to punish dc's, when there's literally a just as easy and almost as fast way to leave games without receiving the penalty.
---
Plus, when a Survivor wants to be salty and idle in-game, the other Survivors as well as the Killer will definetly use that to their advantage at some point. And even when that wouldnt be the case, there'd be possibillities to compensate the points properly. 650 is much too low anyway.
---
Is there even a counter to No Father? Been waiting for him to come back from walmart for 12 years at this point
---

---
Oh ok , gotcha
---
As an ex shirtless David main I didn‚Äôt mean it as a compliment or as an insult
---
I've deffiently had perks temporarily disappear. Dont know about the left side though
---
I don't think it should be that far, because that makes it impossible for the killer to patrol the doors. A nice medium between the two should be the spot the devs aim for.
---
I see a ton being used on PS4.
---
The other day I was wondering why I sucked at being a stealthy survivor and kept getting found urban evasioning as claudette
---
I then realized I haven't played stealthy like that in 2 years and the games lighting has became so shit you couldn't hide like how you used to lol
---
You can eventually catch and Hook-Camp that one Survivor though. Survivors CAN annoy and harass, but it‚Äôs usually very limited and doesn‚Äôt make the Killer have nothing else to do.
---
This isn‚Äôt me ‚Äúchoosing sides‚Äù, because I play both Killer and Survivor equally, and when a Survivor is annoying me/BM‚Äôing/purposefully being toxic, I can easily ‚Äòdelete‚Äô them from the Trial since I mostly play Stealth Killers, which means no Borrowed Time.
---
And the fact that it is not original.
---
Inner Strength.
---
As a survivor your primary concern should not be ‚ÄòI need to be full health‚Äô its generators. 
---
Most matches you should naturally come across a totem which is quick to clense and then when required (killer is coming your way, need to make a clutch hook save) you jump into a locker 8 seconds later.... full health.

After I took three of you guys down with that single Haunted Grounds, I was originally going to record a clip of that entire thing. However, I opened up the Shadowplay menu and noticed that the instant replay was off, so no record of that for you guys.
---
So I turned that on, went on to pick you guys up, proceeded with the match as usual, then this happened. Thank goodness I managed to turn on the instant reply for this recording. I still don‚Äôt know why the only audio recording is my mic and nothing on the in game sound.

---
I did the same 2 hours ago. I felt so bad :(((
---
Had a guy on Xbox who had the "survivors rulebook for killers" for the samination dbd videos. For those that haven't seen it, the joke is that survivors create rules for how the killers should play, and yell at them if they end up breaking the rules. 
---
At the end of the game he seriously sent me hate mail and told me to uninstall the game for how I played. Literally did not see the irony
---
When I'm playing purple ranked killer games, I get against red ranks because barely any red ranks have good queue times. There's 4 killers that are mostly played because they are the strongest in higher ranks. In lower ranks, you see more killers  than those four, and you generally see more playstyles, too. In purple and red ranks there is a meta that rarely changes, and that should definitely change.
---
The perks I see survivors run the most as killer are Dead Hard, BT, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, BL, and Lithe. The perks  I see killers run the most as survivor are Ruin, BBQ, PGTW, NOED, Thanato, STBFL, and Nurse's.  You can't just have fun in red ranks or purple ranks because of this fixed meta.  I generally see killers and survivors run 2 or 3 of those perks.
---
Basement time
---
Jake looks like loki
---
then what if you just wear the head piece?
---
Any survivor with a brain would use a god loop.
---
Thats what i play on.
---
Queue up at the same rank at the same time and hope you get together.
---
Of course they'll be happy if you got 0 kills, but that doesn't mean they'll say you're good when   
---
they'll actually say the opposite.
---
No more stupid than allowing all survivors to just see each other across the entire map at all times.
---
ew ecks bocks
---
What's wrong with him playing the game? If he wants to play it, he can play it. Just because he plays a game you you don't like doesn't mean he can't play a game you do like. I'm probably gonna get downvoted because I'm disagreeing with someone on reddit. Nice gatekeeping though.
---
Why'd u get downvoted? Carson is daddy
---
FUCK ILL DC
---
My guess is we will see them when the chapter drops dec 3rd. But this is just a guess.
---
i get instant queues as killer, depends on your rank and location though.
---
Yes they do, think of it like this, Every Hex Perk has to Sit on its very own Totem when its active or working. If a Totem is lit up, then there is a Hex perk connected with it that shall be deactivated when that totem is destroyed. If a totem is unlit there is no hex perk on it CURRENTLY but certain perks may light it up later, IE NOED, which only activates and lights up after the gens are done.
---
There are 5 dull totems on the map that can be used by hex perks.
---
Lol, I don‚Äôt ever give up if I get three gen‚Äôd or whatever. If 1,400+ hours of playtime has taught me anything, it‚Äôs that a killer can always turn the game into their side no matter what happens. You guys got so dam lucky that the Nurses eyes got permanently melted after the best Haunted Grounds play I‚Äôve ever made (and was unable to clip for myself :c )
---
You know this: michael is staring your friends you know the location of michael and you know you can work gens safe that is a big advantage againts the solo players
---
Lit totems are guaranteed to have a killer's perk tied to it. Every map will have 4-5 totems at any given time. N.O.E.D is an abbreviation for no one escapes death. It's a perk that let's the killer instantly down a survivor after all gens are completed if there is a dull totem of which the perk will instantly make a lit totem. A good way to play around NOED is to either cleanse every totem (assuming you know their spawning locations and the rest of the team is gen rushing) or to remember where a few dull totems are after noed has been revealed.

---
Link to vid plz
---
I knew the video was missing something.. so I thought a jumpscare bonus at the end is perfect lol
---
I just had a 4 iri match as Ghost Face. Have you given me the power?
---
So does autodidact work in a similar fashion for this challenge?
---
Every game does have survivors, so you are right, not every game has SWF teams. Glad we agree on that and are on the same page. 4 mans do NOT get unlimited information, but if they could see each other‚Äôs aura automatically would that not give them MORE power and potentially give them that unlimited information? Although within that, I also did say that survivors are the main point but showing their auras would be showing the key objective to the killer, which is unfair hence why only the generators - the survivors objectives - are shown. Not overpowered and gives a place for them to look when lost.
---
As pointed out in another comment, you can‚Äôt just make multiplayer games not have external communications between players. The way the game plays and the whole concept behind it is that you‚Äôre meant to be wandering in the dark. In terms of solo queues, since as you said, not every game has SWF teams. 
---
Being able to see your team at all time would be the equivalent to the killer seeing the survivor‚Äôs locations every 30 seconds in terms of balance and fairness. The game is about 4 weaker survivors banding together to try and escape a horrifying and scary situation. It‚Äôs not tag where you can see the people all the time, it‚Äôs essentially hide and seek, and THEN tag once you‚Äôve been spotted.
---
Although, honestly, write to the devs and try to make your point known. That‚Äôs the best way you can get the change you believe the game needs.
---
I was going solo, and NOBODY brought items and the killer (The Hillbilly) brought insta-saw with an Ebony Memento Mori. After the match was over he said "gg" I was like "hahaha no." 
---
Was I a bad sport? Yes.
---
Was I salty? A little bit.
---
Hotel? Trivago.
---
I'm on the other end; Instant games as survivor, but 20+ Queue times to just get a lobby to play killer... really making the archive missions a nightmare to do for killer :/
---
What have they done to spongbob
---
Steve?
---
Pink haired Nea escaped after letting herself off the hook, teabagging me, blinding me, and then launching herself out through the gate. Then the sweet gal messaged me and said "üòÇ"
---
Even if they're beatable they can still be much more frustrating to play against. I guarantee there are plenty of people who would be more than willing to pass on that extra BP to go against solo players.
---
Thank you
---
The good old days
---
Not entirely, no, but it will stop unavoidable harassment. It's easy to play around one survivor with really good gamesense, because they can't guarantee that the others are doing gens. When there are 3 or 4 survivors all communicating, it becomes extremely hard, if not impossible, to get anything done.
---
Then two gens pop at the same time as the SWF fucking laughs at your dumbass.  Lol
---
I'm not going to be able to find it, somebody posted it here on Reddit.
---
When I play killer its usually a lot worse, very rarely have I seen a salty killer do anything but dc.
---
Happy cake day by the way
---
I was playing a game and a Dwight pointed at a locker that his friend was in right before I downed him. I let him crawl to the hatch from the basement because, although I do accept bribes, that was a dick move
---
It saves time for the killers, but not the SWF who are suddenly having massively long queues because only a small portion of players are willing to play against an SWF.
---
Ooh there's the Qu√©bec flag at the start! Nice
---
Forgot to add I did chase them and let them farm points from pallet stuns, but this Meg immediately blinded me at the start whil I messed around a bit
---
That just wouldn‚Äôt make much sense.
---
She‚Äôs still easily one of the best, if not the best, killer. A good nurse can still reliably 4K without addons.
---
it‚Äôs chum
---
if they tunneled they wouldnt get another bbq stack you cabbage
---
I know right
---
Wouldn't really be sudden, considering the fact that, as I said, SWF lobbies are already being dodged quite often. Actual queue times would likely be the same - it might just feel like longer because the killers that used to dodge suddenly won't be there to dodge anymore.
---
The way I understand it was to prevent survivors from getting too much value from fast vaulting from a parallel angle.
---
Aw thank you! I‚Äôm terrible at killer and probably would get a lot of flack. I just wonder why people need to be salty or toxic to others. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going to help you do any better
---
It‚Äôs because like people 99 the exit gate and the go for saves so the killer can‚Äôt use the perk like blood warden thought there should be some like dual edge sword for making them so that the gate , it‚Äôs just a suggestion thou I‚Äôm not implying it should happen thought it‚Äôll be making survivors more on edge
---
No sweat, just gotta activate beastmode. EZ
---
no, just no
---
The devs need to fix the gen speed or that will never happen
---
Well I‚Äôm sure that is why they let the killers able to open gates now.
---
Yeah but it back fires at times if the whole team is taking hits so you can‚Äôt hook the person you‚Äôre carrying
---
Which is guts and viscera.
---
You should try some of the other survivors, this is kinda cool
---
brown through green yes 
---
red your gonna have a bad time
---
But killers can open exit gates...
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
I know you didn't ask my opinion, but it's the internet and I'll give it anyways.

Someone posted Nancy and Steve in the Sims a week ago and it got removed.
---
I love killers like this
---
What rank is he?
---
This wouldn‚Äòt make him stronger tbh, but I like the way you go about it. It‚Äòs similar to an idea I‚Äòve had.
---
I‚Äòd change this status effect to something different. The way you describe it sounds like the Intoxicated status effect. What I‚Äòd be suggesting is that survivors ‚Äúspasm‚Äú. Basically it would screw with their controls and they couldn‚Äòt run in a straight line anymore. As for his chainsaw I‚Äòd say he should be EXTREMELY fast and move very unpredictably. However, he‚Äòd be very hard to control and the camera would go haywire. Also get rid of bumping into objects.
---
Concussed is a straight reference to his kill in the first movie where he strikes that guy and drags him into the basement. And his new chainsaw rush is a reference to his tantrum in the second movie when the last survivor escapes and he just goes ballistic with his chainsaw on the road.
---
The concussed effect makes his M1 something to be feared instead of a ‚ÄúI want him to M1, free sprint burst lel‚Äú. And the chainsaw change forced the survivors to ‚Äúguess‚Äú where he‚Äòll go.
---
15 lol
---
Can I be let go too? *holding flashlight behind back*
---
Ooooh okay good to know. Maybe I‚Äôll post the licensed ones in their own post and add a disclaimer or something.
---
Thanks for the advice! Opinions are always welcome :)
---
Play with your food is great on him for the stay in Tier 1 sneak builds. It is also great to get an advantage as you are just an M1 killer when not in T3. 
---
Ruin or Corrupt Intervention is good to buy time until you get out of Tier 1. 
---
The other perks are up to you and depend on your play style. As a general M1 killer, Enduring is good on him as you will likely get pallet stunned. (Lunge in T3 through pallets early. The lunge is huge and can hit when they don‚Äôt expect)
---
For normal games, get out of T1 AS Soon As Possible. 
---
Learn how to 99% the T3 gauge and wait until you are just on a person to pop into T3.
---
I think the only cross play that was added was people who bought the game on Steam and people who bought it on the windows store. So its still all PC players.
---
i love my edgy foam blade teens gib me all their cosmetics
---
Also while playing killer I try not to join one person twice in a row if they get farmed instead I go for the person that farmed them (I still down the first person tho)
---
Because my friends looped in big circles around the killer shack so that the killer could easily catch up to them
---
I‚Äôll be posting Nea, David, Ace and Min tomorrow!
---
I fucking played against this load out yesterday with black incense and wanted to fucking kill myself.
---
I don't know much about Freddy and his add-ons, isn't this the popular build that causes depression on survivors due to how slow the game becomes?
---
For some weir reason if you let them loop you for a luttle (15 seconds or so) they eill always get really overconfident and make huge mistakes in the rest of the fucking match
---
This just happened to me. I've been playing for one day. I go up against a trapper with hex: ruin and an ebony mori. The guy was actually either really lagging bad or else not good at aiming though, since I managed to cleanse the ruin and then let him chase me for a few minutes while gens got done. Stupid ending though. I got hooked, someone rescued me, we ran away and healed, I take one more step from the place we stopped to heal, \*SNAP\*. He comes back and Moris me, but everyone else got out!
---
Archives
---
Or you'll have my luck, and everyone else is jerking off in the corner wondering why there are weird black birds following them around.
---
I love how people living in 2019 still think this is a decent suggestion, it amazes me
---
Is Spirit Fury a good substitute for Enduring?
---
In honesty, that would be better. The killer would be wasting time (even at 2x speed) that would allow the survivors to escape or open the other gate. The killer gains an advantage with a downside. So do the survivors as they can use it to bait the killer.
---
If you can do hoodies you could do the legion members!              
---
^Im ^totally ^not ^biased ^or ^anything
---
To bad I am main freddy
---
This has literally been all my games today. I'm rank 9 and picked up Huntress 2 days ago. I'm being matched with rank 3s and 4s, no one in green or purple ranks. I haven't been doing well against people who are obviously better than me and they just throw insults in end game chat. I'm a rank 1 survivor. I put a crap ton of hours into survivor and I'm fairly decent. I would never dream of being as rude as some of these people are.
---
Watch otzdarva on Yt he has some amazing Myers builds
---
doctor with distressing
---
Losing even with a crutch build OMEGALUL
---
They really need to fix their faces
---
It's a teachable perk from the Spirit, after you break a couple pallets the next pallet that stuns you gets instantly broken
---
Phone background and a half!
---
IM A JAKE MAIN AND I APPRECIATE YOU FOR MAKING HIM LOOK SO GOOD THANK YOU!
---
Too late until you prestige but discordance 1&gt;3
---
Maurice is the entity
---
And, everyone says ruin is a must when it is not, pop alone is much better, and discordance is a close second for killers with map pressure, or the ghostface perk that block gens not worked on.
---
I think your PS4 might have autism. PC master race
---
I was thinking that "match me with any groups" would be the default, and you could just turn off matching with SWF groups if you wanted, not vice-versa.
---
You are right though, some incentive to playing against SWF would go a long way. Maybe double bloodpoints, or your rank-up meter starts halfway to the safety pip, but in exchange you can't double pip?
---
Absolutely stunning! I deeply envy your talent!
---
Are you planning on doing other killers as well?
---
They are usually used together. Spirit fury destroys the pallet, then enduring allows you to quickly recover from the stun. 
---
I have not had good luck running spirit fury alone as the stun alone allows a survivor to get away. Spirit fury only works every third stun, and once they know you have it, they will  early throw safe pallets. Think about the times you got stunned on the same side of the pallet as the survivor and they were able to run. 
---
Enduring can be used alone and still give a benefit. Spirit fury, I have not gotten good use of without enduring.
---
Well that's not true. Show me where you can face 3 red ranks with legion and only ruin and get the 4k. Ruin isnt as good as people say it is. Maybe in the green and below ranks.
---
What about my teammates?
---
get outplayed nerd
---
Usually with Legion I manage to turn toxic games around with a toxic loadout. Sloppy, noed, discordance, and BBQ
---
Best boss music
---
You over-exaggerate
---
They could match with a killer that‚Äôs Rank 2-Rank 14
---
Why not just make this into a Legion cosmetic at this point at least?
---
Or make it work on Feng like how Legion‚Äôs do?
---
Welp, one win in the red ranks, pack it up, we're done here.
---
They are at least slightly less oppressive. I'm not actually that mad at the other two versions. Then again I'm still way too new to have experienced them enough to truly get salty.
---
He is a pedo, a toxi asshat and is known for cheating. He just bullies noobs in his videos and thats it. Not even remotely funny at all imo.
---
Edit: there is a good reason he got several bans including a hrdware ban on ps4
---
It is something on the to-do list for the devs. 
---
They said they need to look at how to merge accounts (if you have both a PC and PS4 account for instance). Don‚Äôt expect it anytime soon.
---
story of my life.
---
no, just got added a few months ago
---
If the killer didn‚Äôt hit ur buddy you‚Äôd be dead
---
Possibly. I feel this style would fit well with The Plague.
---
Also, thanks! ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
There are more dicks on that sub than r/dbdgonegay
---
Not normal dicks either. They are scary monstrous dicks.
---
The first time I used DS it was at the gate, I pressed the wrong button and died. I could've escaped with it but I'm boosted lol
---
Shit Fr? I only started playing in July i assumed they always could
---
How would that be Bun Min.
---
That‚Äôs not even the proper slowdown freddy tbh. You need to slow gens AND healing. Thanata/dying light, ruin, pop goes le weasel, and either STBFL, sloppy butcher or BBQ is what i use on sweater boi
---
*Laughs in Nea*
---
ye, it used to be pretty dumb before that with nearly Endless hatch stand offs
---
Even sometimes, as Killer, it doesn‚Äôt feel like hits shouldn‚Äôt have connected. It‚Äôs ended with me getting WAAAAY too cocky with my lunges.
---
Hol' up x4
---
Yeah i got you again, though i meant it would likely end up being that non swf match ups would become the defacto default for killers in general.
---
Its not a bad idea but i feel given the choice, most killers wouldnt want to play against swf, aside from the more extreme killer mains and such for challenge.
---
Im sure if it was implemented too that killers might save their moris and noeds to target the swf. if not choose to dominate the non swf instead of challenge themselves, making it more hardcore/less relaxed (good or bad?)
---
Its an interesting idea, Incentives would definitely help in your proposal but the toxicity in dbd also goes a long way as people wanna be in control and take advantage where they can.
---
i would love to see more killers if you ever make them!! &lt;3
---
Nope it got added with end game collapse. Before then, matches could take 30+ minutes if you were a potato. I miss those times
---
I get killer games instantly but have to wait a good 3-5 minutes for survivor. I'm not sure why as most people are opposite. PC player
---
I‚Äôm not enjoying the ‚ÄúSacrifice the Obsession 7 times‚Äù challenge because I keep getting tunneled as a survivor. The tunnel of being the obsession is so bad, you can get the 3 Gen with Dark Sense if you‚Äôre not the obsession. I was an unlucky survivor and became the obsession with no obsession perks and had a Michael Myers with Rancor tunnel me for 5 Gens. So pretty much I had a fun time getting my unhooks that game
---
Whats broken about it exactly? I don't know of any bug.
---
Feelsbadman
---
If you can't choose go with what you play the most. Killer main? Killer first. Survivor main? Survivor first.
---
Just basement camp with insidious. It's cruel, but they'll understand
---
I see. Takes about 10 minutes but after a few matches down to about 5 or so.
---
Instead of the escaped, trapped, and kill icons you should do the teachable perk
---
I love this btw
---
How high of a rank you are? Still new to the game and I'm in very low ranks.
---
You do know you have to unhook someone first right?
---
Wait to see what nerfs come for Oni. 
---
Get Oni for the fun if they are OK. Get Yui if Oni is nerfed to much for now.
---
Because ppl are upset about me insulting their fetish
---
How can people tell when it's SWF?
---
Papa Nurgles blessing
---
literally slap four slow-down perks on any killer and you can win by the war of attrition provided that you can actually catch people.
---
the matches just end up being 20 minutes long and the most boring thing ever.
---
I'm red ranks for both.
---
these would make awesome character portraits
---
10
---
This has been in the game for weeks if not months. I always run Kindred and get this if I DC. They'll fix it now that you made it public. lol
---
You have the perk activated and you are still not able to unhook yourself 80% of the time
---
You can buy unlicensed characters like Legion, Plague, Kate, Jeff, Clown, etc.  But you have never been able to buy licensed characters with anything but Auric cells or cash through the Steam shop.  So Myers, Stranger Things, Ghost Face, Ash, etc.

&gt;hugging walls around killer shack
---
lol but yeah I get the confusion
---
I have used it a lot and never encountered that bug before
---
I'm sure this was already suggested but scratched mirror Myers on lery's is my go to for grabs.
---
Yeah i think Pop would‚Äôve helped a lot in this game. I think i‚Äôm just gonna bite the bullet and buy the Clown for it, and swap Nurse‚Äôs out
---
but if you're wearing the head piece, you would theoretically be wearing the hood, unless the head piece is supposed to be you...not wearing it?
---
Doesn't look like an accident to me.
---
How does 16 days of play time indicate a new player?
---
What was an accident?
---
Heads up you posted this twice
---
I'm so mad about the fact that they consider it to be a bug!
---
If I see baby ranks in my lobby all I do is equip a medkit. Please don't take that from us bhvr it's the best thing ever
---
Holy shit I am horrified I was not expecting a fucking Nea to fuck herself with a sex toy oh my god get it out of my face I think I‚Äôve just lost my sanity oh god oh fuck
---
This was just both of you playing weird
---
Fun fact: 3 times actually, reddit didn't go back after posting the image and I didn't know if it posted so yeah.
---
I hope they all report you for ragequitting so you get banned
---
I P3‚Äôd Clown. Highly recommend. Pop is essential at high rank. Bamboozle‚Äôs a gimmicke perk but it works so well on Mikey, Legion, and Leatherbuns. And coulrophobia...well...just forget that one lol
---
Ah, you would have tricked me in a previous life, but since sub icons now appear, I will not fall for your Rick Roll
---
That poor guy..üòî
---
I have also never seen this happen. Could be a server based thing and your connection is screwy compared to ours? Who knows.
---
100%
---
But back in my day perks were ultra rare and cost 8000 blood points
---
*i wouldnt know*
---
yea maybe for something like minecraft or COD that would be a good amount, but for this game? hell no.
---
This game has one of the hardest learning curves period. 400 hours is not enough for you to be competent. I would say around 2k is when you actually know whats up
---
XP definitely is not capped at 600.
---
I was playing two man swf with my fiance the other day. I was bringing BPS so he said he would too. Mentioned it in pregame chat and the other 2 survivors said they were gonna bring them too. I didn't want a farm match, just wanted a decent game to get the most out of the 4stack BPS. Well, we got a wraith who hooked me, started another chase, but then decided it was better to immediately tunnel me off the hook instead. Literally chased me for 3 gens, camped me on 2nd hook, then tunneled me dead with BT. Then he camped my fiance and those poor Megs... god. They could've had the gens done and left while he camped him but tried a yolo save and he ended up getting a 4k. Post game chat I asked him why tho? with a gg and he said any means necessary to win and that I was just a salty survivor main. I got 10,000 points pre-BPS. It was a sad day.
---
I ALWAYS MISS IT WHEN I NEED IT THE MOST ;___;
---
There are rumors it happens more to people with uncapped FPS
---
Go for it. Theres only 2 days left
---
I love this! So unique!
---
Isn‚Äôt it kill the obsession?
---
I kinda like NC how it is. A lot of times while picking up a survivor I see another one self-caring behind a tree and I am like "*shit, should've looked around for the injured guy*". 
---
Current NC requires some level of map control from the killer.
---
Do you think Dying Light would be a better replacement than Pop? Or could it go either way?
---
What about ghostface crouching around in bright red
---
I still think if you 4% off a hook into a camping killer, the killer should be stunned.
---
Oh ok
---
Bruh just add vc to survivors and balance around swf
---
Can‚Äôt wait for Quentin
---
I spent 10$ so I would have a chance at that charm. God wills it
---
That‚Äôs fair it Also might that I play a FULL ninja build or a full catch me if you can build no move speed boost just a lot of things that lower time on red marks and give me more time to work with crouch and other mechanics I‚Äôm
---
Not looking to be seen, but if I am I‚Äôm trying to hide as fast as possible, I do agree though these neas do play like their pro play gods a lot of times
---
Anyone else thinks it looks like a baby hand?
---
Ya think it feels bigger in that hand?
---
We already have a dbd killer in league. His names kassadin (nurse). He blinks for days and murders everyone in sight... all jokes aside, I'd say spirit or nurse would be the only real options. Everyone else is to basic. Spirit would be a stealth melee jungler like Evelyn. Nurse would be....well... kassadin.
---
Ruin, Bamboozle, Monitor and Abuse, Save the Best For Last with a Dead Rabbit addon is probably the best build for him. Other perks to run are Brutal Strength, Enduring, Pop Goes the Weasel, Sloppy Butcher, Nurses Calling, that sort of thing.
---
Lucky
---
The thing is, they're not team mates. They're other survivors.
---
It‚Äôs 6 ranks above or below you, not 2. And if they were 8 ranks above you, that must be a swf.
---
Where? lol
---
I am in favor of a monthly reminder
---
I‚Äôd let you pull me off a gen...
---
Thx for the info guys
---
The forums.
---
Nah i want to get the achievement. Ive only played it 3 times max.
---
I understand, for me it typically gets use whenever an unhook happens so I can find the 2 people healing.
---
Sometimes the game is just unwindable. I just played a game on cold wind as wraith with a silent bell and wind storm, got 5 gen grabs. So 5 zero second chases and they still got all the gens done in about 7 min. I was still able to win but goddamn like how much pressure can you possibly apply.
---
I'm just saying this in response to veterans supposedly thinking that the game is kinda survivor sided, I don't really care for this person because it's clear they've never played killer before
---
If you play killer more then Oni, if you play survivor more then Yui. I‚Äôm probably just gonna choose Yui for her perk that can pick up pallets.
---
At first glance I thought claudette had a little beard lol. However it was just the shadow on her neck making it appear this way. Good stuff man!
---
I believe this is the simplest solution
---
You have to get 5 squares vertically but 7 horizontally? Make it 5x5 or 7x7 so it‚Äôs even. Plus you have two spirit squares.
---
Stats are still stats, even if there are underlying factors. Something is pushing the kill rates so far up that the only killer below 50% is one that has a very high skill floor
---
Okay David.
---
Trapper, Demo, Spirit, and Ghostface? I thought this was fixed
---
The only bug I can think of is when someone brings a luck offering then the chance of getting of the hook is more than 100% and this messes it up somehow, I‚Äôve never had this happen tho
---
I don't like how they made the male xbox avatars so feminine tbh
---
Dying light is a better replacement for thanata. You dont want to run them both its too much give and take on the slowdown. Pop is a must. Dying light helps late in the game when fred boi is weakest.
---
I'm only at level 40. It's impossible to go that fast unless you play all day.
---
I beat that one easily just keep looping around the pallet, and bloodlust them
---
Bamboozle isn‚Äôt great on Legion. Most of the time the perk doesn‚Äôt come in handy as when you use it in your power, you can only put them in Deep Wound and not down them. They can escape. 
---
Try switching that one out for a different perk.
---
For thicc Feng anything.
---
I know lol ‚Äúaccident‚Äù he says
---
I‚Äôll be real I‚Äôm blind as shit so I still can‚Äôt see that red fuck crouching behind me
---
"At 50 seconds" as in, at 50 seconds after the unhook, I should clarify. Not gonna wait the whole minute, but I'll def wait 10 to 15 seconds to put someone on death hook or eliminate a player.
---
Nope, guess it wasn't me then lol.
---
That‚Äôs just how people are. It sucks. 
---
Glad you are at least decent human being.
---
But you didn't sacrifice them
---
Nah man. The damn claudettes in the white and brown apron outfit with the gloves are the most toxic in my experience lol.
---
I'm working on fixing that right now. It's just hard to fill 15 spaces with all new material.
---
If locker grabs count it may be worth a try, I am skeptical though. But that'd make things easier.
---
I just got this game last week. I'm playing my first game as killer. I, as expected, get completely destroyed. Like 1 or 2 hooks and no kills. I'm going to post game chat and it turns out I was being matched against a green and purple player. Here I am just waiting for the "GGEZ uninstall noob" I knew was coming. One of them asked how long I'd been playing and I said it was my first game. He  just said "don't worry, you'll get better :)" really made my day.
---
That one made me so happy that in my next game once I got all 4 people down/hooked I carried the last one to the hatch and dropped them on top of it.
---
Because it's not actually a "fetish".
---
I rock nurses 3, bbq 3, tremors 3 and discordance 1.
---
Its been doing pretty well for me so far. Especially with some dream pallets in play (love giggling to myself as I chase them towards one) I always just view it as a "you win some, you lose some" thing. Learn from your mistakes and take the lessons into the next trials. I play a lot of survivor as well as killer, that way when playing my main (Freddy) I'm pretty savvy to the little tricks survivors like to pull to get away.
---
Fun thing I like to do with discord and tremors, if I see 2 people are on a gen or I just know someone is working on a gen, after I down somebody I'll act like im teleporting to the gen so they run away from the gen and end it just before and pick up the downed survivor making the other survivors wait for the gens to open back up. And if they didn't run then I'll see it lit up and my bbq will let me know if they run from it and what general direction. Nurses is just nice to have in general when you've lost that injured survivor you were chasing. 
---
None of this was helpful I'm sure, just a fellow Freddy main throwing his dime in there lol good luck in the fog
---
True, or just take out some of the squares to make it smaller. Idk have fun with it
---
Do you run ruin on billy because that‚Äôs pretty much having 6 gens if you have any idea on how to play billy properly
---
I view everyone as non toxic.... Until the first flashlight click lol
---
[While I work on the revamped Survivor card, here's a fully completed Killer bingo.](https://i.imgur.com/9hQP53u.png)
---
I‚Äôll buy it for you if I have to!
---
When you realize this game would be dead if SWF was removed.
---
No worse than Plague with Thana. If people just dont heal and knock out gens, you can lose. Even with a 16% slowdown, you can only chase one survivor at a time.  
---
In fact, dying light can actually hurt the killer here more than Plauge. That is a 33% healing bonus to the obsession. That negates all healing debuffs. And any time the obsession is on a gen, there is no dying light debuff on them. At least with Plauge, there is no healing at all.
---
I think it's ok. If anything maybe a shorter exhaustion timer? I've always wondered why every exhaustion perk uses the same cooldown values
---
I do mind game with the dream projection, but I hadn‚Äôt thought of running Tremors. The problem is is that I‚Äôm cheap so Freddy is the only killer i‚Äôve bought thus far. At this point i‚Äôm deciding whether I want to get Clown for Pop or Myers for Dying Light, although I think your suggestion for Discordance might be worth thinking about too. Thanks for the tips üôèüèª
---
All you have to do is put the leftmost column on top and add one more square for a 6x6
---
I love when things get serious, just not for every game. Sometime it would be nice to just chill as killer.  
---
But other than that i think you are absolutely right. I should work on that, i do beleive i'm more sensible than most people when it comes to dealing with free toxicity and insults, i just can't help to ask myself why ? Why would you be like that ? The fact that it's just a game and that people say such mean words over losing or to mess with you is just a big brain fuck for me. I will try to learn how to handle it.

You need to safe rescue someone, you cant use deliverance if you unhook someone who has been hanged 2 seconds ago and you make him go down again...

Welcome to the church of traps watch your step

Did you report them in-game?
---
This game would be dead without SWF.
---
How is this a support request you moronic bot?
---
This game is straight up broken lol.
---
The Claudette one looks the most similar in my opinion, nice creativity.
---
Slowdown Freddy only kills the guy still running Self-Care. Working as intended?
---
Just run Calm Spirit and Iron Will lmao
---
Beautiful work. Amazing talent.
---
????????????????????
---
Well yeah some of those were wierd
---
Hey, yeah I did cheers. They are still streaming, if you watch their most recent stream you'll see what I mean
---
But it‚Äôs fine when Survivors use up insta heals or BNP, right? Because Survivors can do no wrong?
---
Monitor, pop, infectious, and bbq/discordance, Dead Rabbit and whatever you want.
---
No hexes to guard, no obsessions to worry about. If you hit someone in T3, anyone within 1/4 of the map is revealed to you and you get HARD snowball potential.
---
Monitor, Surge, Surveillance, Infectious, Dead Rabbit is also very good and plays ‚Äúfaster‚Äù but less controllable.
---
The biggest trick is to maximize your T3 time. Get to the 95% mark of T2 to T3 and save the switch for when you can wreak the most havoc.
---
Good survivors will just loop you for hours. Don‚Äôt chase them, give up and go to someone else.
---
I hate running ruin, it‚Äôs just so rng dependent and a survivor can literally spawn right on it and there‚Äôs nothing you can do.
---
He was playing with Hexy last night. I tuned in for a few minutes and somebody was getting pretty pissed off, idk if it was Ninja or somebody else in their swf.
---
Lowest killrate for a killer is in the 60%. 
---
Hatch games typically end in the last survivor dying trying to open the gate.
---
Why is this buff to all killers necessary?
---
i think he meant the timing was an accident
---
83 days?? Lmfao gtfo
---
Well I think it's perfectly acceptable because of the add ons and bullshit op perks survivors get. Idk man when I see a swf all flashlights up with red add ons. I think its goes both ways
---
DS for sure! 
---
I've escaped so many times because of the killer tunneling me when the gates are open!
---
Iron will and DS
---
I can confirm that he doesn't read the information given to him while he's looking directly at it on the screen. Also he called some killer a hacker and then proceeded to fuck up a skillcheck. I didn't watch the whole VOD because it got unbearable to watch after the first 10 minutes.
---
Only thing I hate about tremors is the cooldown but paired with the rest of my build it works out. I love my mind games. I also will start porting to a gen I know people are on while walking towards it, let go just before you port and watch them come running into your arms lol everybody and their mother will probably tell you pop. At least thats what everyone told me when I was looking for advice on my build. But no problem always happy to help with little tips üòÅ üëç
---
I prefer Feng, thx
---
A Nea let me grab her off a gen several times for the Archives after not being able to do it for several matches due to survivors DCing or dying to fast. In turn I let her do all the gens and escape by the gate, giving her probably one of the harder survivor achievements in the process(Bill's Left for Dead achievement.)
---
I mean, it‚Äôs not really toxic if it‚Äôs the only way to secure a 4K
---
Not metal enough
---
Fragile would have been a better word.
---
I‚Äôll make him even more metal next time i‚Äôm sorry üòî
---
That was awesome.
---
So the other survivor just has to wait on the ground for several minutes while you try and find the last survivor? Seems a lil toxic.
---
For a dollar a day, you can save a Claudette from the endgame collapse. #claudettelivesmattertoo
---
I'm assuming the entity is using the horse to watch, kind of like how the crows are also servants of the entity
---
How do your game looks like that? Mine's look so much darker

---
can we buy rift tiers? because i don't think i'll finish it on time to get all rewards lol. if we can buy rift tiers how and how much is it?
---
I really enjoy this concept. Could I use this and credit you in a fan made ideas compilation?
---
Is thay the most OP perk set?
---
A generator is red when it has the lights above it, it‚Äôs yellow when it doesn‚Äôt have lights (such as generators in houses on Badham or Hawkins Lab)
---
That is conpletrly useless and against the idea of a key.It is like Moris can only be used on the third hook.That is useless.
---
Classy moves

#[STATUS UPDATE | ARCHIVES TOME 1 ‚Äì LEVEL 3 CHANGES](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/108232/)
---
Had it happen twice on ps4. Worst part was no skill checks showing up either, couldn't do gens or heal. Since I was a useless teammate I just ran the killer around as much as I could...
---
It turns into a gangbang? Interesting people.
---
So glad it's December now!
---
juggling as killer isnt gonna really change anything drastically bc like i said, gens go by way too fast. you cant control 4 survivors &amp; 5 gens constantly. a decent swf could pop 3 gens in less than 1 1/2 mins. its so stressful to play killer at red ranks these days.
---
Ok thank you :)
---
Yep.  You let yourself eat a few pallets and break them, and then basically automatically land a hit on the third as very few pallets are close enough to anywhere else that could help protect a survivor if the killer doesn't have to waste the time to break the pallet.
---
The counterplay survivors have to this is to drop the pallet early (Spirit fury only kicks in if it's a stun), but it will generally get you at least 1 hit a match before the survivors know you have SF.
---
I understand it it‚Äôs just a little sweaty, especially when that killer tunnels people off hooks and stuff aswell it‚Äôs just not fun for survivors, I just don‚Äôt want a bunch of survivors to quit because of it because sometimes it happens to me and it just makes me not even want to play, and I‚Äôm saying this because I enjoy killer and que times are already a bit long for killers
---
moris need to be changed as well. they are not very well thought out either.
---
There's no sort of cross progression, I really wish there was
---
Damn of course not, thank you!
---
[And so have I.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLBAFJWbd30)
---
I remember having nightmares about the sound it makes
---
Ds and deliverance
---
I consider letting your teammates die so you can get the hatch more sweaty
---
The Claudette one is especially cute. Well done, these are fantastic.
---
The name of the guy is R E C K L E S S
---
Like I said it‚Äôs all vague. Says go to the streamers channel...bring that it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúNovember challenge‚Äù and nothing else, I assume it‚Äôs the official? Go to the official channel, jack shit for info. Hence why I posted here
---
Hexy aint a good peraon to swf with for new players. That guy doesnt sacrifice or help teammates for shit
---
How about pantles Julie?
---
Which is why I tend to not even try to pip, I‚Äôve had my fair share of swf, and besides doing that they tend to be super toxic in game chat afterwards. Saying gg ez when they know they are just playing super sweaty
---
For me it's always red. Wait, is he talking about the aura or the actual color?
---
Edit: nvm its always red for me
---
"Cuties... for my hooks," your friend neighborhood *Bubba.*
---
nobody liked the challenges in the first level, they just didn't cross the line of bullshit yet.
---
Nobody liked that you had to go out of your way and in some of them intentionally harm yourself or the team to complete them, especially on conflicting challenges like the chest one.
---
I like this idea, and I was wondering if I could possibly use it in a fan made ideas compilation. I would credit you, and dm if you have any other questions
---
i said actual proof, claims are not proof
---
Well I mean, Spirit literally has a blue waffle
---
That wouldn‚Äôt work though. Cause if you have the hair on it‚Äôs own then when people switch the head but not the torso, they wouldn‚Äôt align properly. If that makes sense. Like her pony tail would clip through it. 
---
It would have to be a head cosmetic that is a hood. Would it work with all torso cosmetics for her? 
---
It‚Äôs a huge technical endeavor that I don‚Äôt think they can handle. 
---
But, I think they can def make a head for her with like, a bunny ear headband. And then make her hair similar to the profile and shape of the hood. That they could so do.
---
In game it says twitch challenges, with only one challenge listed. Doesn‚Äôt show any streamer name. Was the same last month. You go to ‚Äútwitch challenge help‚Äù and it says to go the streamers twitch channel( which I‚Äôm guessing this is the official twitch of DBD since it mentions no streamer) and the leaderboard is supposedly in the Gameon extension which I can‚Äôt seem to find. 
---
It‚Äôs all beta I know but still there are active challenge(s)
---
nou
---
NO NO BUNNY ASH ITS PERFECT HES ALREADY A TORSO AND HEAD COMBO ROFL
---
Everything is toxic, who cares anymore
---
Me neither ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è unpopular opinion here tho lmao
---
Ok ;p
---
*Teleports behind you*
---
Wwwwaaaahhhh
---
He peepin.o_o
---
Oh no whatever wil I do.
---
I am so proud of this community
---
Ah yes, blood lodge..
---
Things used to be worse, back when decisive strike was at its peak and not everything was exhaustion related it just sucks when the killer takes your account hostage until he finds the last guy. Like you know the games over for you but now you have to wait until you can find another match. And it‚Äôs not like we don‚Äôt need more survivors as it is because it always takes several minutes typically to find a killer game
---
Truly an unsolvable situation. Good heavens I've been outplayed.
---
You gotta use his perks or else theirs no point
---
That's the burdens of being a game developer. :0
---
I wouldn't know the details.
---
calm spirit fits him well. cause he is soft uwu
---
&gt;What and how do you get survivor legacy skins?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;Legacy skins were rewarded to players who prestige and grinded through the horrible blood webs before November 2016. Legacy is never coming back no matter what.
---
^(stolen reply from jendenise's !legacy command)
---
Killer made a big goof by downing that guy!

what made the bloodwebs horrible?
---
ninja bad haha bad fortnite man
---
Can you link it to me?
---
Nice to see EAC is doing  its job well.
---
Tbh if I was the killer I couldn't even be mad
---
You're on console, right? That means it's the killer's wifi that shit the bed.
---
Jealous people haha. Same set up here by the way, 65 inch with LED strip on the back of it that I always keep set to red.
---
Because he is a piece of shit
---
Great spawn peek
---
Sorry man, but you can't witch hunt on the reddit. All usernames must be censored. You can show the user hacking but you can't show their name or mention it in any way.
---
i had a fun game this week against a hag, she managed to get my team but let me live despite closing the hatch earlier and having noed! i opened the gate and she carried me to the exit, it made me smile bc she nodded at me saying she‚Äôd let me go (i also had a crappy game prior so it made my day lmao ), i also had a game where a spirit carried me to hatch even tho she was brutal all match, i was surprised she‚Äôd let me go! i thanked her and said ggüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Movie Quentin vs DBD Quentin.
---
I could bring distortion and replace it with balance that‚Äôs my favorite out of his perk set anyway
---
&gt;what made the bloodwebs horrible?
---
Every node was connected, you couldn't force the entity to consume entire branches of the bloodweb. You had to trade 1 for 1. 
---
Also, from what I've heard, back then there was no BBQ to help with the grind, bonus offering and bloodhunts were somewhat rare. 
---
[Dead By Daylight introduction to The Bloodweb guide part 2

---
Back when I played siege when it was new it was ok
---
Then I didn't play for the longest time, much after operation health
---
It was such a crisp, clean, new experience 
---
I saw the game in a different light.
---
Then all of a sudden R6 got super fucking popular again and everyone was playing / buying / watching it
---
Could be a coincidence but imo the bugfix shit is what did it
---
When ghostface is in stealth and someone is looking at him that pops up to show you where they see you.
---
That face you make when your arms are between jello blobs or muscley
---
I started playing dbd again today and I‚Äôm tier 5 without premium
---
Oooo. So did she fuck up by looking then?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fair, I see what you mean. Probably a better choice, yeah xD
---
In this situation yes but most of the time you want to break him out of stealth.
---
That's your business. I like to 4k. It feels satisfying to kill all players. I slug the last player and leave. Let his buddy pick him up. I dont like to go hatch hunting. Because I like to 4k. It doesn't make me toxic because I want to have a satisfying win. Toxic is not what you think it is. Being toxic is bad manners. Like t bagging and hitting on the hook that's toxic. Trying to win the game is not toxic. Also I enjoy red ranks. I get to play against goid survivors, and godly teams. Sometimes I cant even kill a a survivor. But I enjoy it because I play against good players. This is coming from a killer only main. I hardly play survivor
---
Play a chainsaw killer
---
They'll vault everything, just M1 everything and chase them cunthair close and grab them out of windows / pallets instead of M1
---
Before they changed the matchmaking I did if the group seemed suspect. Now that the SWF rigging is mostly gone, I don‚Äôt. Mind you, I would still play against them unless it was obvious they were gonna be asshats.
---
Got it. I got to be better at looking at him but i always run away lol. Thx!
---
Just give Feng bunny ears and a pink jacket
---
custom perk icons
---
Yea well there are plenty of killers who down the last survivor and just stay by the downed survivor waiting to come for you, and the devs don‚Äôt intend you to have a guaranteed 4K no matter how flawed endgame is they added it so if your playing with people that die right away your not stuck with an automatic loss.
---
That‚Äôs like saying I got a 2k now I deserve a 4k
---
Not sure how to get that...
---
walter
---
Ghostface main and kept sending it to hawkins. Took 3 ganes but the 2nd floor gen is super easy to grab.

r/PerkByDaylight may help you

That was actually a good build tho
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e4tzei/wraith_bug_or_am_i_just_misunderstanding_him/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Ds, Iron Will, Dead Hard and Inner strength
---
on Hawkins? 115% killers struggle in some places. There are too many safe spots on this map. It only works against bad survivors
---
This could be easily solved by not having indicator on how far the gate has been opened except for the one who's opening it. This allows for mind game and more satisfying endgame.
---
Sacrifice 5 survivors in the basement in one game
---
So true. When I started the game all I wanted was Min‚Äôs pink dress.
---
I've tossed resilience into my build, it really helped extend my chases cause of the added vault speed.
---
I like my solo queue build. Decisive for tunneling, Empathy to know who is being chased or needs heals, Sprint Burst (because Dead Hard is unreliable and Balanced is being nerfed), and Botany to help heal others. I'm on console so when the Kindred change comes in the upcoming patch I'll switch out Botany for Kindred.
---
I disagree I dont think its toxic at all. Blame your teammate. It's his duty to pick you up. The killer doesnt owe the survivor anything. He makes the rules and gets to decide how he chooses to kill. And the old way was really bad. Salty survivors would canp in the locker, just to waste time. This way is better imo because they cant just bm the killer. They have to leave or die. But I dont see slugging as toxic behaviour. It could be if they are camping your corpse. But if they down you and go looking for them. Then imo it's not toxic, and will continue to do it so I can 4k and double pip
---
The timer on bw would of probably still ran out actually.
---
Whenever I kick a pallet as Wraith it makes me wonder how weak these pallets must be for his little baby feet to shatter them
---
Ever since the nerf I keep missing them
---
Oh no... You have bamboozled the bamboozler.
---
His dick still long
---
Bruh I can see their dick prints da fk
---
I‚Äôm pretty certain it just means the survivors can continue to talk even after the killer has left/disconnected.
---
Everything is as it should be.
---
At least they aren't blendettes.
---
Lots of basement builds going around. Better get a sleeping bag were in for the night friends.
---
I've been hookdiving and throwing pallets early in chases yet I made it to rank 3 survivor. I don't get it either
---
I dont get it... Im prolly dumb tho so
---
I'll try but they usually pick me up and carry me to the exit.
---
Now I want to see all killers like this
---
The hitboxes are a problem, but it's not very often for me.
---
Missing a grab happens pretty regularly to me though
---
Strangely enough, I never have issues this big, and I play a lot of survivor. Am I the only one?
---
Also if it wasn't for the rng wiggle forcing the killer to miss the hook he would be dead.
---
Center of your screen, he‚Äôs not broken you didn‚Äôt have him in the reveal zone
---
You weren't looking at him, 45% of him has to be covered by the center of the camera.
---
true
---
I guess it‚Äôs his duty to pick you up and your right when survivors could just take the game hostage it was toxic but the majority of the time I‚Äôm slugged the killer will just camp or patrol the slugged survivor giving you no chance to actually play the game anymore. And when they I introduce the dc time outs the killer que times will be insane. I don‚Äôt agree with dcing but when I get slugged for a 4K I dc.
---
This is the content I love to see. 
---
If you end up selling prints of this, sign me the hell up!
---
Reminds me of Kingdom Hearts!
---
Pretty cool
---
I guess my internet connects to the server quicker because this doesn't happen as often as missing a grab
---
Call me cannibal
---
i would try and help but idk either i just run toolboxes
---
I agree with this. I play survivor solo in red ranks and it can be a nightmare. I can‚Äôt wait for the kindred change because it will now be way more useful for us solo survivors
---
Looks like someone didn't get the memo and thought they are making a horror movie
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e4ucz3/glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That‚Äôs not toxic, the killer has to slug for the 4K in most situations otherwise they won‚Äôt pip, unless you‚Äôre purple ranks or lower. It‚Äôs the way the game works, if they don‚Äôt slug they get punished. Not toxic at all. Things used to be a lot worse even before DS existed, unlimited vaults, genuine infinites, sabotages hooks didn‚Äôt regen. Exhaustion regenerates whilst sprinting.
---
If 400 cells were spent, then she might be getting screwed.
---
Seems like your replies in the comments aren't getting as much love though.
---
i usually aim with the button i use to control the camera
---
I saw the key and a survivor with toxic in the name. I fully expected a bad game :)
---
And his wife is irrelevant
---
Iradescent add ons
---
Altough DBD has a lot of glitches, this can sometimes be positive in my opinion because they always give me a good chuckle.
---
Speed boost for ~7 seconds because they'll be instant unhooked by the time it activates
---
PWYF stacks 15% speed boost btw, and it doesn't have a condition
---
This is a case of the perk sounding good but being shit
---
So then your not allowed to loop because it's not that fun for killers and if it's not fun for the other side it shouldn't be allowed. ;););) like that's just bs because they want to play the game and win . You on ps4 because I think you are a survivor who called me mean for slugging and said to kill myself because I'm playing dbd because I'm 13 like he was so trash a 5 year old could beat him. Sorry had to get that off my chest.
---
yeah I noticed that I didnt put ultra rare and was too lazy to fix it :/
---
Found the rank 14
---
It‚Äôs already fixed on the PTB
---
What I would give too. Would do something to lift Legion out of his current slump.
---
Tbh I think a reduction in the base fatigue after his Frenzy is enough to buff Legion from being one of the worst killers in dbd as it would allow use of it for mobility during a chase.
---
Micheal Meyers is the sexiest man alive. Where is my shirtless Meyers
---
Love it seems like something behavior made
---
Username checks out so well that I'm gonna assume this is bait
---
It's something that baffles me too, and ultimately I think it's too big of an issue to really figure out in its entirety. Is it a generational thing? Is it a technology thing? A human thing? And that's what probably makes it so upsetting, is that you can't make sense of it. But there's so much crap in the world that happens for no reason, if you let every single thing bother you, you'd have a stroke or something. Letting shit go is tough, but it's the only way you don't get bogged down with everything out there.
---
If you do enjoy playing more seriously though, maybe try getting good enough that you can perform decently enough with any killer, that way no matter what you play, you at least shouldn't get steamrolled. This also requires redefining what winning means like that other user was saying, which I think is really good advice.
---
FYI I don't play killer often. I had a daily to complete. You can tell I don't use Rin that much because of the incomplete perks.
---
Probably the perk "borrowed time"
---
Tbh secret neighbor needs more recognition

Hexy also yells at his community for donating and subbing even though he could mute it or turn it down

How is slenderman not a killer yet i mean..

Sacrifices are Kills, too. Moris are written as "Kill X with your own hands"
---
You‚Äôre a pedo, my little sister just showed me your messages with her. See, that‚Äôs not proof, it‚Äôs all just accusations. It‚Äôs easy to accuse someone or make up anything. Because he‚Äôs well hated it‚Äôs easy to just chuck on any allegation and go with it.
---
Play with WGLF/BBQ
---
Because the only people who bother to comment are killers butthurt that their playstyle is deemed toxic. You think people who agree are gonna come in just to say they totally agree. They upvote and move on
---
Can someone remind me what the killer perk that shows the aura of a hex totem being cleansed is called?
---
I can agree some are similar to already existing champions. However I do have unique kit ideas for each Killer, but the vote will decide which one I will use. 
---
I figured the community should have a say in which one killer gets in.
---
I will give peace for a flashlight user if he / she: doesn't spam, uses flashlight for its actual purpose and doesn't do too absurd actions.
---
Otherwise. **No mercy.**
---
I think got your six should be for 5 seconds and has a 60 second cooldown. Of course at max rank the cooldown would be 40 seconds
---
Did they remove the demon man? I didn‚Äôt see him in the store
---
You never really had him right in the center
---
you might have set shadowplay to record your mic to one track and the rest to another. you can check by opening the video and try to change the audiotrack to see if there are two tracks.

---
I rarely get bullied, i think i'm a good killer, i handle Swf well if i'm prepared, you can't play the same way against SwF you have to adjust your objectives and perform more. 
---
Ofc when i wasn't that good it hapenned a lot, was horrible, now this is fine, and i'm fine with losing anyway, i'm fine with survivors having 4 ds's, a flashlight and 3 toolboxes with prove thy self, survivor and killers have both their weapon and idc what you use it's okay. 
---
What's bothering me, is how people show off with all of that. 
---
Again, losing isn't a problem and if i wasn't losing how could i get better ? 
---
but people triying to get a reaction out of me to please their ego is. There is some teams that are really kind,cute, polite, even caring , it's not every survivor, but there's still soooo many of them that feel like everything is due to them, i even had some death threats every now and then. 
---
It's just making me sad and you are both absolutely right, i think i need to work on my way of handleling those people. It's an IRL problem to, i am very susceptible and get hurted by words very easly.
---
I thought she could escape in time.
---
Omg now I‚Äôm worried you‚Äôll be disappointed now the pressure is real
---
WGLF is in the shrine as well, although it's better to level david up since it's a level 30 reachable
---
Oh yes. That's the crossover I needed. Eileen the Crow would be a unique looking killer.
---
Just stretch your res
---
oh you should hear old kate
---
That 4% chance is just too shitty
---
Wraith going invisible
---
The only hoodies they have are ones with the hood down. Also I wouldn‚Äôt be confident doing them cause I have no idea what they look like under the masks!!
---
yea and it's pretty obvious that the survivor is also a pretty big noob. id criticize an ebony for a ritual especially when rancor exists but you obviously didnt tunnel so whatever.
---
just because some cunt noob tbags you doesnt mean you got  bullied.
---
Low graphic settings
---
Lol this reminds me of a SWF I played against as Freddy a little while ago. They were teabagging every pallet, swarming every single down for super aggressive pallet and flashlight saves, coordinated Head On plays, going for disrespect unhooks as I tried to kick a gen 3 feet away, teabagging in the open to try and bait me into running an infinite, the works. 
---
And I fell for none. Of. It. Not a single save, not a single chase bait, nada. They tried their absolute hardest to bully and got HARD punished for it. The game ended with 4 gens left, both of them injured, in the basement with me at the top of the stairs after predicting the timing for a teleport. They tried to crouch and spin around and look up and be cute but nope. Y'all made me sweat my ass off for this and tried to bully me every step of the way, there will be no mercy tonight.

Literally out of nowhere, this turned out to be great.
---
My only suggestion really is to watch other dbd killer streamers and see how they play and what perks they use to improve both your chasing &amp; understanding of how to run map tiles.
---
I still see other people run Enduring &amp; Spirit Fury if you want to end chases quicker. Only issue is that good players tend to counter this combo of perks by throwing pallets early.
---
Tru3 is a good start for learning how to be a good killer. Hes not the best killer player but he is pretty good. 
---
Fungoose is one of the best dbd killers I have seen and explains his reasoning behind all his actions while playing killer. He has had a few games of Myers games which might interest you aswell. Really talented and plays both survivor and killer. 
---
Scottjundd made a very good video, giving advice on optimal ways to run most of the structures in dbd to force the pallets down early or good mindgames that will usually work.

I think he got a new console or was unbanned because one of his recent videos have Ghostface in it. Forgot when he was banned tho

SoloQ is the weakest side in the game... people always complain about killer but they haven't really played soloQ. I know I have more experience than the average player, and definitely more adept and skilled at the game, but there is like... no good teammates. Their decision making sucks, their pathing sucks, they don't know when to get saves, it's just a nightmare. Then there's the killer. They're going to be someone stronger than you, and you can't rely on your teammates, so you just don't have fun because you're better than the average brain-dead teammate because rank is so unbelievably easy to obtain. You also get dedicated hit, and punished for having good knowledge.
---
Okay
---
If a killer is at the end, they don't deserve to be able to get all these second chances, just the ones they have now are balanced. this would just punish SoloQ, as a good SWF would just have gate campers.
---
Level 1 bamboozle is actually useless.
---
I accidentally bought No Mither from the shrine a year or so ago. I kick myself every time I see it pop up in a bloodweb.
---
git gud
---
Fair enough I understand your point of view but when someone doesn't play spirit much they suck with her powers or at least I do. So the ebony was well needed in my case. The key was still used If that makes you feel any better?
---
I can feel this addon that makes you undetectable for 10 seconds after leaving a locker

---
Hol‚Äô up x5
---
Beautiful!
---
Yeah facts. For those people I like to establish that they would be dead if I didnt let them go. But that's only when I let them go. If they're toxic they die. Sandbag teammates, tunneled. It's the way.
---
I will never understand why people hate playing vs flashlights.. I will always prefer them over medkits, toolboxes and keys. I have great headphones so I hear them even if I am blinded...also most of the time people with flashlights are trying to be heroes or annoying so no one is doing gens.
---
I mean I could just leave it here-
---
But I already cleansed it while having this thought at the last second, so *nah.*
---
I believe is better level up a character to level 50 and pass to other character
---
True I‚Äôll delete the post , didn‚Äôt give much thought to soloq , ik the pain as I do soloq my self .
---
i like the killers perks lowkey!! overall i like it! nice :D
---
this community is almost as bad as the teammates you get in solo queue.
---
I like how spirit is mentioned twice.
---
This really be a bruh moment
---
My personal opinion is one that may be despised, and I can understand why.
---
I find that the only bad challenges this time around were the endgame ones. The unhooks especially. 
---
Yeah, the grinding ones are bad. But it also kinda gives you something to progress on while giving progress towards the rift. Last thing I want is to get to the end of all the challenges and learn I need to do like 100 more matches without anything else to do to get that brand new part charm.
---
The only ones I don‚Äôt like are the ones that depend on pure luck, instead of skill. Those are the ones that need to seriously be toned down.
---
That, and the fix to the iridescent emblems that‚Äôs coming is good too, I don‚Äôt mind grinding, but only when it‚Äôs not broken.
---
Long story short, I personally am fine with the archives for the most part, but there are definitely things that need to be changed.
---
I completely understand the people that don‚Äôt want like 25 unhooks. I‚Äôm fully aware the grind is tedious, and I can agree, but yeah, at least there‚Äôs something to do while you grind those rift fragments or whatever the fuck they‚Äôre called, ya know?
---
Pretty sure characters are 500 auric cells individually :p all of them can be bought with auric cells too
---
K thx
---
Yes, all characters costs 500 auric. You can buy her with 9000 shards too since its not licensed character.
---
It looks like she was Tbagging feng but okay...
---
Nah
---
Leatherfaces are gona do things of leatherface
---
every new game is different and you never know what killer you are gonna play against. also i like bullying survivors @ rank 20 :)
---
Welcome new Survivor. Do you want me to introduce you our **C**l**O**w**N** m**AiN**s!?
---
I can see why you think that and to be honest it might have been the case in that specific clip but the game was quite long....
---
Speaking as the Killer here, such situations are just weird.
---
Bro, you¬¥re not helping him, either make a risky save and trade him for yourself or try to bait me away. At the moment you are just preventing me from leaving the hook, and your team from saving him since you keep me here.
---
well that depends on how much they nerfed the clubby boi
---
probably same as usual
---
Dear god,it can‚Äôt be. First keemstar...*now this* we‚Äôre in the end game collapse bois
---
My mentality is that you should expect *nothing* from your teammates. It's a bit unrealistic, but if you never get hit/hooked in the first place then you won't need heals/unhooks. If pipping is your goal, just evade the killer long enough to do a gen, unhook a teammate, heal them, and maybe be chased.
---
Yes, a few depips are unavoidable even if you do play perfectly. But that is the exception, not the rule. My unpopular opinion is that they balance out the farming matches. In the higher ranks you won't really run into something like feeding myers EW3 as often, so if you keep pipping that issue will get solved.
---
Can‚Äôt say I understand what you‚Äôre saying but thanks for the downvote :D
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e4usbf/bugged_back_button_could_not_find_a_match_for/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

I love it. I'll never call him Oni again

I know but when u make a open rant you should be aware that people will tell you that you are wrong

Bc he‚Äôs a one hit, after first game he flopped
---
Lonely Freddy didn't get the high five :(
---
I feel bad for being on 66
---
Feng Min mains also disliked that BHVR released this concept because now they have to focus on it super hard and she gets no good new skins.
---
Feels like I have some of the least variety in outfit of the older characters and just a bunch of duplicate outfits.
---
I mean I doubt Michael dreams I feel like he just sleeps no dreams nothing but in the realm of the entity the lines between real and a dream are pushed to their limits when Freddy is in the picture so who‚Äôs to say what Freddy couldn‚Äôt do with that power
---
I'm pretty new to the game. I had to idea that certain cosmetics are seen as "toxic". That's uh very weird to me. They just look nice lol.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed they put their heads in the sand and pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist when they get called out for it
---
&gt;"Oh well, c'est la vie. The world would have kept turning. Maybe next time beHaviour would place their game better in the market, or make a game the market actually wanted at the time."  
---
It's literally the most popular game of its kind, and it always was, despite being regarded as a failure for its first several months of being officially released.  
---
The addition of SWF very clearly did more than just save its own skin. It saved the genre. Nobody would care to try and copycat DbD if DbD had failed and died.  
---
DbD might not be the first of its kind, but it's widely regarded as the best of its kind, and with good reason. Other devs making this sort of game can expect to have their game compared to DbD, and other devs making this sort of game are expected to take inspiration from DbD. That sounds to me like a successful game, placed extremely nicely in the market.  
---
But fuck that, right? SWF is bad because people with friends are "cheating."  
---
&gt;"Never said it did, should or would. People can state their opinions on things without ever expecting something to change because of it."  
---
Sounds like a waste of breath. How fitting.
---
Which part of her adams apple do you not hear?
---
I just picture micheal murdering freddy because his dream was about murder anyway.
---
I just use Ghost Face. But yeah, I've had this happen multiple times. It's worse when they lag out while you're reaching for them.
---
Yeah brightly colored cosmetics usually means you wanna be chased which is usually done by toxic players
---
Survivors have challenges to actually escape, heal, save, open the exit gates, etc. These are near impossible with a shit team and a team that‚Äôs been downsized due to D/Cing. Almost any altruism or survival category challenge is effected by a survivor D/C.
---
**Thats it!**
---
You had enough of this Bullshit.
---
Each time you get unhooked and instantly chased again, earn a Token. When you have two Tokens, you can shoot the Killer.
---
*I swear, if you don¬¥t stop tunneling me, i¬¥ll be mildly irritated*
---
I finally was able to boop the snoot! 2 days ago I had a game with Oinky-Chan and I tried to do it in the middle of the match but it was unwelcomed. We were able to get to the exit gates and while everyone else was pointing and teabagging, I crotch crawled to her and she let me boop the snoot several times. We all left offerings for her as a thank you. I will always remember that moment fondly ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Ok
---
In Freddy vs Jason freddy kicked Jason‚Äôs ass in the dream world but got his ass kicked in the real world so I assume that it would be the same here Freddy would remind Michael of his youth likely turning Michael into that same young boy on Halloween night who was scared of what he had done
---
no I hated it
---
I guess that kinda makes sense. I dont see how wanting to be chased is toxic though. It's fun and good practice, also let's your team do objectives. I guess if they want to get chased to tbag and just make the game unfun for the killer though it makes sense.
---
*[Everyone disliked that.]*
---
What are you talking about? You do know most Survivors try to juke you or avoid Frenzy by going back to the vault Legion just did right? Same deal with pallets. Bamboozle doesn't allow them to do so (unless the game or perk itself stops working because it has been an ongoing issue for the time being) and you can easily get a hit when they try to do that trick. Even better meme build go with Bamboozle and Fire up.
---
The FOV for Legion is hideous when doing certain actions along with long stun and besides Legion vaults with two hands.
---
I think I can see an eye and his mouth?

For killers https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQefm3-mUKURJqC5UFtzE64_S-OitL9DK
---
Ok I will practice this. Since they've changed the hitboxes on console, it's nearly impossible to dodge with 360. I used this way of dodging on every killer than but now...
---
As a high rank killer main I know this topic almost as much as the toxic people themselves
---
why is this getting downvoted
---
Those were for something they did awhile ago I‚Äôm not even sure why it‚Äôs still in game I don‚Äôt think you can even sign up anymore
---
That is one thing i have noticed about this game, from grinding trials, from playing killers that are not S tiers, from getting literal rocks as teammates.
---
This game, this experience, its not about having fun, its about chasing fun, you keep playing, keep grinding, keep hoping, because MAYBE maybe this match you MIGHT have fun. Fun is not a constant, its something you hope for, its the thing that grabs you and pulls you into just another match, that idea, that chance that maybe this time you might actually enjoy your time on the video game, and the problem is it works, when you having fun you love it and its great and like a drug addict they got you hooked, you will sit through all this crap, you will slog away at the worst matches ever, all just for that payout, that chance that daddy BE will give you that fix of fun this time, and no matter how bad it gets, they will drag you back, because hey those last four games were bad, but maybe this one will be good, sure your trapper, you have no addons and your fighting 4 bloody claudettes with Flashlights and Toolboxes all with connected names, but there is that CHANCE, you might have fun.
---
In a way its almost impressive, how well this completely flawed game works at making you chase the carrot through all their BS, all their problems, all the worst play experiences, just because the carrot tastes really good.
---
I THINK-
---
Would you actually believe the slimey piece of shit is trying to worm his way back into the Last Year the nightmare Discord after getting banned off it? Check his twitter. The guy is a complete turd. + He was also trying to make porn aswell. Dude is a creep.
---
I believe the challenge just wants you to earn an emblem of iridescent quality for 15 matches regardless of the amount of emblems you earn.
---
The (S) makes me think its deliberately designed so that earning multiple iridescent emblems in a match only counts as 1 in the challenge.
---
Wasnt slugging OR not tunneling a counter to... Just saying but good to know!
---
ok
---
It is and seems to me its working fine
---
It matches you with players 6 ranks above or below, from what i can see the highest is a 4 and the lowest is 16
---
And now he is trying to slink his way back into their discord?? check his twitter. Dude is a piece of shit.
---
And people have a right to complete their challenges as a reward for correct play, and not have their bloodpoints or Archive challenges be decided by the whims of some petulant shitlord who DCs as soon as they're downed.
---
SO how likely are survivors to survive then? Where is that metric?
---
Imagine having Rank 20 Killer or Survivor.
---
I mean, with these terrible hit boxes I'd say the Killers have it pretty good right now. They straight up miss me yet somehow I get hit. I jump through a window and takeoff yet if they swing, I get hit. I drop a pallet ahead of them and they swing and I'm hit. I loop around them they swing, and it clearly doesn't touch me, yet, I'm hit.
---
Not say which is more difficult to play but at the moment, the killers have a bit of a helping hand.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that , thanks for that . Thought it was like same colour or one colour above and one below
---
Yes! I would either loot during match or one egc started. Didn‚Äôt get hit, Walked out the door and nothing
---
This ***is*** my favorite multiplayer game. But lol, I won't say its my favorite community by miles.
---
Nah playerbase is too low for that, would take ages just to find a match(Even though it does anyway)
---
Also your welcome
---
Which is funny cause fortnites new season challenges actually got easier. Source, it's what i move to when dbd kills my mood with its challenges so i go do its challenges
---
Decisive now needs a bigger skill check since it‚Äôs not used all of the time now
---
you‚Äôre very right. bhvr has us all waiting like ducks. somehow i still find enjoyment in this game. i‚Äôll just wait for the rage to subside.
---
It was a really hard match , had Lerys and I just started playing huntress , those addons really carried me . Had to slug everyone one in the end except last guy who found hatch
---
Thats right but the window will close after to many uses.
---
But it's all just exactly what I thought about.
---
So thanks for the confirm
---
Survivor : why do i hear boss music from the basement
---
ig it glitched a little bit oop
---
I get your point. I would also enjoy a game with everyone nice and friendly, but If I get ppl like this is I only get him out of the game and let the others go. (If it isn't a full SWF with the point of trying be as toxic as possible)
---
99% of them tbag me at the first pallet anyway.
---
Never thought about that. I'm more of a runner and looper, so this one never came to my mind thx
---
I think it's time for DDD. Boi!
---
It‚Äôs not your fault but I would be careful with the incoming timeouts coming this week with the new patch if it counts them. Have you tried verifying your game files? That‚Äôs all I can think of even though you‚Äôve reinstalled. Could it be your internet being inconsistent?
---
purple/red ranks for killers are instant before those it's slow
---
If you‚Äôre using a controller it‚Äôs considerable harder, it just takes practice honestly.
---
That‚Äôll be a amazing change and survivors who have were going to live forever will also get stack to make it fair for them ? Win win for both sides right in my book .
---
You and I may be addicted
---
nice just expect nobody to be impressed or ig don't expect anything
---
This video is the song of my people

sorry, you've got a TTV. i don't make the rules man.

Myers had Canned Coochie this whole time.
---
You have chosen the way of the murderer,
---
You have given up the way of the merciful.
---
Is this the path you choose.
---
üëâyes
---
    -no
---
It might or might not give you any at all if you have iridescent
---
not really countered more harder to hit but ive seen people hit a unnerving presence t3 doc shaky skill check DS so that means fuck all for me
---
The only perk combo on that list that fits your point is Iron Will and Stridor. (And you can still hear the breathing even with Iron Will, so... half point.)
---
Trapper‚Äôs traps still work with Small Game, they‚Äôre just less easy to walk into.
---
Lightborn users can still be blinded, it‚Äôs just nearly impossible unless you learn a alternate timing.
---
Distortion fails after three uses.
---
None of these examples make an aspect of the game unusable, just less attractive.
---
I play both sides evenly and I have a lot of experience and some survivors are so entitled that it's baffling. I definitely get BMd more by survivors than I do by killers. I just wish both sides would stop being toxic towards each other and stop BMing for no reason. I definitely don't suggest playing killer without Ruin even though it usually gets taken down within the first minute. If I had Corrupt Tier 3 on every killer I would probably try running that instead.
---
The post wasny loading »ôi I could only see Feng standing there and I was like wtf and then she sudsenlly STARTED MOVING AND I WAS SCREAMIN AND I ALMOST THREW M6NPHONE ON THE GIROUND AAJAHAHAH
---
incorrect Iron will lvl 3 mutes pain grunts 100% stridor doesnt make u hear survivors louder survivors them self become louder.
---
Point still remains UP is a bad perk just to hope to counter DS when u can just slug for 1 min
---
I‚Äôve tried to not bring it in purple ranks and it just makes me hate playing. -_-
---
When are we thinking of actually putting him in the center of our screen?
---
You really shouldn't care what SWF group has to say for you. Although they are there for spoiling the game and experience and obviously they would bring the meta perks. They don't care about the performance, they only give a damn for giving in salt or taking the bait.
---
Sadly, it's either fight against them to make them fully destroyed or outplay them. Or accept defeat... which is just going to boost their ego to continue this attitude.
---
Play however you want man, just don't dive into the bs Survivors offer or show.
---
I have everything on every killer. It‚Äôs just that I hate going against Ruin so I decided to play one without it and got the most toxic survivors in the world. Oh well, won‚Äôt be making that mistake again
---
Fifty or more percent of survivors die against every killer on every rank (obviously paraphrasing and  not every game is like this, just based on the data) except nurse. Which means, statistically, depending on the 2k, 3k, 4K usual for killer (the effectiveness if you will) what the likelihood of escaping will be for survivors in a trial against that killer.
---
The data is there mate, idk why you would want a survival chances specific to every survivor because that makes no sense, as the survivor base is the same no matter the survivor, so it would be a matter of luck; as opposed to killers where their powers (and speed, lunge distance, etc) could make or break the result of the game. 
---
Maybe what‚Äôs the standard build/most common perks for survivors to escape with? The same could be asked of most effective killer perks for the stats but the devs did not put out that info
---
No like legit how the picture looks of her with that hairstyle if u buy the cosmetic and decide to use just the head she will have the same hair if she had the hood up but without a hood.
---
Nice plays though the 2nd one seems a bit BS on the range.
---
Excuse me its Kurger Bing employee thank you
---
‚ÄúI feel like ruin isn‚Äôt very fun for survivor‚Äù the first problem with your way to play is the fact that you care more about others having fun in your games than yourself, you are dumb.
---
I'm on console and I can hit 9/10 ruin skill checks. Good survivors learn to adapt and play through ruin. I think that's why streamers like Otz and trying things like Corrupt or Surge with Surveillance or Pop Goes the Weasel. What killer were you playing without Ruin?
---
That's true
---
In the past month I have learned how to be salty but honestly I've also had great interactions. 
---
I would have never known baby killer was an insult lol
---
The perk is randomly placed on the bloodweb. The entity always takes that first. 
---
Just look at the web and try to make it take as much as possible (if it‚Äôs a web you don‚Äôt want)
---
Freddy. I‚Äôm pretty good with him so that‚Äôs why I felt I didn‚Äôt need it. And to a degree, I didn‚Äôt. I definitely could‚Äôve won if I had tunneled. They were being stupidly altruistic
---
I‚Äôll be playing Forever Freddy from now on
---
Pretty accurate
---
https://youtu.be/EJEGE75TV7U
---
While its a bit old it still aplies ok
---
The power is gained pretty quickly for injuring. It‚Äôs not hard to get at all. And yeah, it does suck that you‚Äôre encouraged to slug to not lose the power right away, but otherwise it would be a huge pain in the ass to have someone hooked while oni still has half his power bar to one shot you, applying even MORE pressure to survivors
---
Should be able to buy them with Iridescent shards as well, assuming you have enough saved up to buy both or just 1 if you prefer.
---
The only challenge I felt bad for was monstrous shrine. I hate camping and I felt like shit, but it had too be done.
---
This is üî•üî•üî•!
---
Low ranks are hell because the survivors and killers are still learning. High ranks are stressful and/or boring for both sides because the gens get done fast,  ruin or no ruin. There's barely any chances to learn how to counter genrushing (exists but not in the way people think) because most of the time you get good survivors that genrush you or bad survivors that aren't good at the game at all. 
---
If the game was balanced around players who know the game better (red ranks) the game would be more balanced and might be more fun. The devs generally balance around the more casual players which is the problem. It causes a more stale meta in higher ranks and makes the game hell for newer players.
---
Okay I thought you meant you can trigger when the bloodweb eliminates half the web at once, which seems to happen very rarely.
---
You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm pretty stupid. Won‚Äôt be making that mistake again. Forever Freddy from now on it is
---
You have to manipulate it. It doesn‚Äôt just trigger.
---
Yea trickled down balance is how most games with a high skill ceiling balance their games bc if the best players can use it and not break it then it will work for the newer players.
---
but DBD can easily be broken by the top players *cough break squads*
---
I stopped using Ruin. It artificially inflates your ranking and can easily put you up against chases you won't win due to your higher rank.
---
Lmao imagine actually touching the floor, disgusting. /s
---
Green weed meedkit : forget about your desperation in short time, instant and single use. Increase happy laugh after using it by 50%.
---
Why is this a tikbtok?
---
why you let that shit get to you? (sincere question)
---
i remember back in the day when t bagging became a thing....thought it was stupid then, still do now (especially in DBD considering it‚Äôs not really t bagging?) 
---
i can see where it‚Äôd be frustrating since you decided to run something people cry about then got mocked but laugh those idiots off and do you. 
---
i enjoy the game, work too much to play as much as i‚Äôd like, and things are WAY different (worse) since i last played but it‚Äôs still fun. somehow considering how fucking frustrating it is to solo queue and 9 times out of 10 there‚Äôs at least one DC in the first minute 
---
idk food for thought
---
Exit gates are your third chance to escape. Don't take it for granted
---
I‚Äôve been at the red ranks for a while. I used to not play with it but for the past few months gens have been flying so I decided to start using it.
---
I don‚Äôt feel I played badly at all. Especially considering it was Haddonfield, they were swf, and had Balanced Landing. Like I said before, I two hooked everyone
---
I‚Äôm not really angry or upset. Just frustrated that when you try playing nice people are dicks
---
Setting use item to mousewheel down
---
#clicks intensify
---
Instead, give Yui this outfit and boost sales.
---
Win-Win
---
I think Ruin is fine in the higher ranks, but I think it carries too hard in the lower ranks where most don't even know where the totems are. I've had matches where they just couldn't find it, and it didn't seem right.
---
Would be cool if bubba had same effect of struggling survivor on him while swinging on every swing. But he moved at ~125-130% speed and for longer duration. Would be hard to control, but extremely effective
---
They asked enough said.

---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Actually myers would say this.
---
Myers : *heavy breathing*
---
No way, you used a broken offering and you‚Äôre proud. Well done
---
If you leave a game then I dunno what you expect, just ragequtting against good players.
---
It‚Äôs a rant. Don‚Äôt like it or care why comment?
---
Feel better?
---
Yeah actually. Especially because I have game footage from two different people and confirmed report tickets from devs. I‚Äôm plenty good now.
---
Matching names, you can check their friend lists on steam

Dr fate

I am at 61 and there‚Äôs half an archive left. It‚Äôs not impossinle

Lol nice
---
It is as long as it doesn't spawn in front of you
---
Same energy as the Marge meme
---
I've been using Blood Warden as killer pretty often for the giggles. Did not know there was no indicator if it activated since I've never had it used against me as survivor.
---
You saw how they walked through him ? 
---
You can walk through stalky killers when they stalk
---
He tried to stalk em and a couple ran off
---
There is an indicator did you not see it? Why do you think I ran out of the gate
---
Do you want a cookie? Or maybe a bozo button...?(=
---
It used to be literally insane, everyone ran it
---
Kinda like current DS
---
You don't have to point at his face i go for the upperchest/neck area always works for me.
---
Meg lookin' good
---
Yeah but current DS is avoidable, MoM wasn't
---
Fuck off
---
There's no indicator on the hud though, right? 
---
You only know when it's activated when you see the exit is blocked, or did I miss something?
---
Id rather they just not tie it to a totem and make it last a static 3 minutes or something. 
---
That gives it a strong earlygame pressure however it doenst stagger out the entire match.
---
I feel Ruin is fine the way it is, really.
---
The prophocy
---
what about stop caring about a useless number
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs just the entity spikes at the end of the exit. That‚Äôs why I pulled back
---
Thats fucking sick. More please!
---
Oof, yeah good stuff, Lerys is IMO the hardest map for huntress
---
Just what we need. More pathetic children coming to this game.

Ruin slows gens not only by %regression but also by stopping them with each good skill check, that change would be a buff to the ruin
---
I pet Maurice regardless, usually i end up on a hook because of it but Maurice is a good boy and deserves the love!
---
Here and there, I run with Insidious as Myers and people go outside the gates to check for whatever reason. Combine that with Blood Warden, and you get a good laugh once in a while.
---
Opposite on consoles. Killers are damn near instant, survivors solo can take a few minutes if errors do happen, SWF is a fucking nightmare. You either get into a match with no issues, or you get a LITANY of problems including -
---
Unknown error
---
Connection error
---
NAT type error
---
One of your group just not entering the game
---
One of your group failing to connect to the game AFTER it starts but before the map loads
---
The lobby just breaking entirely for no real reason
---
Then even if you get through the litany of errors, LOBBY DODGE BY KILLER!!! *rips hair out*
---
That sounds incredibly funny. Do you have any clips of it?
---
What if when it reaches 2/3 totems left it loses the stop thingy?
---
Not reading that, I only read title. Just saying you‚Äôre wasting your time with it
---
TBH yes i was convinced it didn't hit at first
---
How dare you rant about Dead By Daylight on the Dead By Daylight subreddit using the very obvious rant flair?!
---
I absolutely fucking totally agree with everything you said, it's what I tell everyone when they ask about killers to get. As ghostface I love how if you can predict what the survivor is doing you can counter them. For example in my first ghostface match in bedham preschool I chased someone around the school and then they entered it, I was at this corner near the spot whre the hatch "always" spawns and activated my ability and stood still. I then heard the feng running around the corner and then I stabbed her in the face and made her backflip, it was so satisfying. I also like using the detection of someone revealing you as a way to find people like the last survivor or someone Indowned because of DS because they always look at you and tell you "Hey, over here!". The only thing I know from a survivor perspective is they don't know what 45% of his body in the center of your camera means and then they say how he's busted and broken.
---
I have PTSD from trying to get a flashlight save the past two days.
---
I really don't want to but I'm seriously considering deranking to get it.
---
I just hit rank 12 and I went against 3 red ranks and a purple. At least I got 2 of them with legion and didn't depip.
---
I see Bright clothes as easy hooks
---
This made me laugh out loud IRL ;D
---
so true
---
Given the context, as a random that might be on your team it would be rude for sure, but not toxic.
---
Everyone gets the occasional unintended DC, but if it's regular for you then going into game then you are gambling with other people's enjoyment of the game as well. I would say this to people with poor ping as well.
---
If you can, do SWF so only your friends are "compromised" and try to reduce the friendly fire at randoms.
---
Thanks. You‚Äôre one of the only non-toxic comments on this post. It‚Äôs a pretty tough achievement to get from what I can tell, which is why I‚Äôm so glad I got it.
---
Oke hol up my man, keeping the game hostage to help her boyfriend who is playing killer u say? Cause u see, there's a pretty well known toxic bitch in the ps4 community that goes by the name of ap0calipstick, she has reportedly done this many times, and is probably one of the most obnoxious toxic fucks to ever play this damned game, Jen-tier shit, proly worse. I remember a black dude did a couple videos on YT about her too where he exposes her, idk if we're talking about the same person tho..
---
I think his blighted skin is one of the best tbh
---

---
You must have done fantastic in school with that logic.
---
I don't know where you guys are playing, but I NEVER see someone playimg with NOED.
---
Claudette needs her nappy ass afro
---
are you that guy on twitter?
---
What was the comment before he got snapped?
---
Because it's not relevant to the discussion, the very thing downvotes are for.
---
Comprehension must be shit wherever you‚Äôre from, let‚Äôs forget the main thread and your stupidly long replies and nit pick.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty shit at this game at 15, if the killer sees me it‚Äôs pretty much a guarantee I go down, I just don‚Äôt know how to get better at juking tbh.
---
so you cross one out every time you see it in game?
---
r/oinkers_
---
Not reading. Essay too long.
---
Chainsaws, huntress hatchets, pigs ambush, legion ff attack and demo's shred dont however, only on m1 attacks.
---
You do NOT need to do a flashlight save, you literally only need the blind, meaning you can just start flashing as soon as the pickup starts.
---
Hope this helps, won't save your teammates but get the challenge done.
---
Just in regards to the split main complaint. Id just like to say that if someone wants to complain about an aspect of the game that is too powerful they should at the very least try that aspect themselves at a somewhat high level. Like im one of those 80/20 killer mains mostly cuz survivor queue times are abysmal and when i see something like balanced landing or a certain potential god loop ill always play the other role and test it against red rank killers to see how they handle it and to make sure that thing is actually a problem and that i wasnt overlooking anything or overreacting.
---
if you buy it from the store of your respective platform you get more value, because it‚Äôs cheaper and you‚Äôll get extra cosmetics
---
This doesn't even upset me though. Usually when killers let me farm I'll happily let them sacrifice me but usually they shake their head no and make me go. If you let me get points, you're more then welcome to get some yourself from the kill.
---
‚ÄúNot too long‚Äù= can‚Äôt read ???üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I totally agree with DrongoJuice. If you have some trouble putting a RBT on early game, ruin can be an alternative. I highly recommand you the "Enduring + Spirit Fury'' combo, if survivors play well, it's not easy to mindgame them at loops . Actually I'm a bad user of whispers and I replace it by BBQ.
---
I think its because of some streamers/youtubers who are actually toxic thus resulting this situation. (Not 100% sure tho)
---
Yeah it was insanely broken and there was no way to counter it. I like the indirect buffs they're giving to it. Like how its a lot easier to get protection hits now. Ima make it viable somehow.
---
I thought that but then I got 6 in my first game and I played another round of trapper and got 7... rank 7 as well. I was shocked lol
---
ghosty can also crouch, better, pig adds nothing to this.
---
Really, it squeaks at you.
---
5% is literally nothing too. A stack of thanatophobia is 4% and is barely noticeable
---
I love ghost face because if they broke my power I know where they are and it less work for me.
---
Also he is stylish.
---
Don't forget that mori tho...
---
Legion was a missed opportunity for a whole slew of cool ideas. It's like they had the disguise survivor idea in mind, realized it was OP and just slapped an ability together because of the due date.
---
Reply still too long. Sorry mate. Not reading your essays.
---
I'm all ears (GF perk) for looping with her dash.
---
Some gen control perk. Pig is all about buying time.
---
Yes!! 100 percent yes! This is an amazing idea :D I hope they implement this!
---
As an ex doc main, it doesn not. Got stabbed maaaany times by madness T3 Neas with unnerving presence
---
2016 survivors running like ^
---
2 L 4 ME
---
Lol a Dwight in pink pants with a pink hat was getting me so tilted today! I was getting so focused on putting him down that I was falling for every juke and loop.
---
Personally i think it would have been cooler if the symbols at the top were his perks but still good either way
---
Stop being edgy kiddy fiddler
---
*‚Äùheres some warm pepperoni from my pocket because your epic‚Äù*
---
This is fucking amazing. Thank you for a cool new phone background
---
Please no stop
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt speak moron.
---
I like how both of the guys faces are equally emotionless.
---
I definitely agree, I had this game last night and it‚Äôs one of the only times I‚Äôve felt like a true killer, all 4 survivors were scared to go on gens one messaged me and said ‚ÄúStop camping gens‚Äù like wtf does that even mean hahaha,!anyway but eventually I found them all hunting the corners of Backwater swap and in Reeds as Blendettes
---
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. I'm rarely in position to even attempt it though, either the killer is psychic/pays attention and knows I'm there or the survivor goes down next to a wall or attempts a spin at last second so the killer ends up facing the wrong way when picking them up.
---
Never heard of either of them before. Definitely going to look into them. Thanks.
---
Myers looks sad, as if he's been spending so fucking long looking for a match he's depressed.
---
I just got to green rank today and the amount of gen rushing is ridiculous sometimes. I feel exhausted after some of those matches.
---
Congrats :D
---
Even OG Freddy was stronger than Wraith.
---
Probably Brown/Yellow ranks.
---
me running around not doing Gens because I‚Äôm looking for Ruin
---
In the higher ranks, I almost need to use a mori just to help manage the gen rushing. When the match is only 10 seconds in and theres already 4 survivors on a gen in the far corners of the map, what is a killer to do?

---
&gt;They‚Äòre using NOED
---
That doesn't make any sense?
---
If a killer is good enough to expect to ez 4k every game, they won't use NOED.
---
NOED is for people that know they won't get a 4k before all gens are done and that's okey.
---
Btw, I play both sides and I'm good at it, so I know what I say
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
That's exactly why you need ruin, BECAUSE they are able to hit great skill checks constantly.  Ruin isn't so much about the penalty when you hit a normal skill check, but about the removal of the bonus progression when you hit a great skill check. If you don't run ruin, you'll be genrushed within seconds.
---
When I didn't see a killer coming and was clicking to my teammates
---
I saw this post just as my match started, I guess I just jinxed myself.

Ah. I play on PS4 so it‚Äôs probably a little harder to check.
---
That Myers has 0 brain cells

This is actually a new perk from the PTB called "Tripping Over Nothing".
---
There's not many benefits so it's not much of a perk, but it does look pretty neat sometimes.
---

Wanna know how to properly deal with ruin. Hit great skill checks
---
Yeah but this is regression not slow down
---
You called?
---
Match making has certainly gotten better in the last few months but will sometimes give unfair matchups. 
---
Pay attention to the time of day/week you play, some times will be wonkier than others.
---
Michael would give his knife to freddy and freddy will share his glove with michael, simple as that
---
Yes, playing 4+ hours a day will most likely get you into red ranks if you are good enough. Most of us with a dayjob, social responsibilities and other games to play, can't play 4 hours a day to get there. I'm lucky if I get 2 games per day, and I need those doublepips to climb fast when I want to climb up.
---
Also, it doesn't matter what killer you play. Everyone gets genrushed.
---
im gonna tell my kids this is The Wiggles
---
I got called trash today on a game where I secured a 3k. Like bro you died first and got less blood points than me. Sometimes the game isnt gonna go the way you want it to go, why is that my fault?
---
wut
---
Yup, they can block it.
---
why does the drawn characters never look like they do in game? what about shirtless myers with a bunch of chest hair
---
Killer mains: *"You want forgiveness, get religion."*
---
Survivor mains:
---
What's with all The Legion hate, I've been getting a lot of 3k-4k games with them?
---
I don't know nothing 'bout no skellingtons!
---
Surge+Surveillance is a Otz cosplay and is a pretty good combo, but only on selected killers. Surge prevents you from using pop goes the weasel on nearby gens and you dont have bbq to find where survivours are working on. So yeah, its either pop+ruin+bbq+stbfl, or surge+surv+stbfl+some perk for slowdown(ruin, corrupt, etc, but not pop)
---
Didn't they change how that works recently (last 5 months?)... so now the matchmaker tries to load in all 4 survivors at once.
---
Well, "working" is probably exaggerated.
---
I tried CI a few times. The only thing that happened was that nothing happened for 2 minutes. Not a single gen was touched. All the survivors hid for 2 minutes until the perk lost the effect, then genrushed me. I still walked off with 2 kills, but the perk had absolutely zero impact.
---
CI is a terrible perk IMO because it's up to the survivors walking into the danger zone. If they don't do that, the perk is useless. Ruin might die fast, but at least it keeps one survivor busy for the time and removes the great skillcheck bonus for the time it exists.
---
Freddy has a counter. Well, don't sleep on job, you know.
---
Yo did you read the comments tho? Man makes some good points
---
Are you LF main?
---
Blind the killer at a pallet. Pretty easy really.
---
The BP reward for that kind of grind was also too little. I get 300K BP doing the challenge that grants me 30K.
---
Yawnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
---
lol you dont get it do you kid? 6 grunts if they are wiggling THE SECOND they get picked up and dont stop or falter...and then there is no way of knowing if they have perks that affect wiggle time like boil over or flip flop....stop trying to defend yourself...you was wrong...simple as that. That is common knowledge
---
Fuck your faggot filled made by faggots game
---
If you're in the exact middle, yes. If you do and the survivor gives up you can close the hatch then kill them. If you hit them though they can phase trough you and go in.
---
i was having a ton of fun playing and learning killer until i started playing so much better than me that it just became me getting looped.
---
Please, don‚Äôt make wide memes with terrible resolution
---
&gt; Lmao why are killer mains all about themselves?
---
Don't need to be a killer main to want this change. Also why wouldn't they be about themselves? Not like anyone else will :D 
---
Anyway, killers gaining some QOL on DCs does not take anything away from survivors... On the contrary it would create some incentive to give survivors something more too.
---
Badly splicing together a super compressed and hard to read Hazbin Hotel comic with no relevance whatsoever isn‚Äôt good ‚Äúcontent‚Äù.
---
jesus christ and i thought i was far with 39
---
Because Behavior fucking hates us
---
No lmao I just leave
---
It can make some people miss, but many old players god used to that already back when DS skillcheck was even smaller
---
After december 3rd(Cursed Legasy upd) you should use nemesis(oni's perk), ruin, enduring, and probably bbq or any other perk. If you get stunned by survivour with deep wound, whey will go down in 30 seconds regardless how good they loop you(old legion hello)
---
OPTIMAL SWF
---
Living failure as killer petition let's go
---
Yeah but seriously this is a concern. There should be a penalty of inactivity in game.
---
Where's the shitpost flair?
---
I only play this game I have an addiction
---
Lmao
---
Reddit posts are just for a laugh, why does everything have to be considered serious "content". Jesus christ it takes 2 minutes for me to make the same memes that get 2k upvotes everyday, they are not more mature. You see spongebob memes every day, how is that mature
---
I much prefer Ghostface. Where the marked survivor hits me with a pallet, thinking they're safe, only for the SF+E to kick in.
---
The moment of realization that they're fucked is beautiful.
---
Oh god , I did the same thing with noed  and blood warden today, hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
How do you mean broken (not trying to argue just looking for a bit more context)
---
Ok and? Your problem
---
What‚Äôs LF sry.  Mostly play killer.
---
You're not actually serious with this tierlist, right?
---
Oh God, my fucking eyes
---
As a warith main i can say the speed boost can be very useful at short loops, because you can catch them off guard
---
Tbh this one isn't awful. Just let people go, make sure everyone is on death hook, get rid of decisive, etc. At the end, down a few then open the gate, hook your survs, you win. Bring Blood Warden for an even easier time.
---
It might be breaking tracking and anti-cheat too. Better double check stuff like this trust me
---
Give me Ansem Seeker of Darkness as Killer and Sora as Survivor
---
You should make an exception for insidious wraith and put it into the top tier
---
I feel personally attacked, it was my only option to do my daily lmao
---
Is there a reason for the little billy‚Äòs?
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
Dbd is one of the few games that can still make me lean into a swing
---
You can't do much when they are good, you just can't. Game is not balanced enough for you to enjoy it at red ranks as a killer. 
---
When you get that team that knows every mindgame and knows your position at all times, they don't even have to be great at looping. It's dumb as fuck
---
Dropping chases doesn't work against these players. Me included, if you leave the chase, i'll instantly go repair a gen. People that only play SWF and win almost every game in like 3 to 4 minutes..will never realize this and on top of that, they also think they have actual skill
---
Mori me with your peepee daddy
---
Some developers are slow and others are BHVR
---
Honestly, ruin should be applied to a totem only when a survivor fails to do a great skillcheck. This will make it impossible for survivor to destroy ruin withotu even touching a gen. Not much of a buff, but still a QoL it needs.
---
I had a Bill doing everything he could to get me to chase him, so I did. After his third hook, he sends me multiple messages to kill myself. This community always makes me laugh
---
Survivor mains and demanding free escapes: name a more iconic duo
---
read the title maybe ?
---
This belongs in r/cursedimages not here lmao
---
Lmfao. I should've facecamped with noed. Reported and thumbs downed.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
One to The left reminds me of Chiaki Nanami from Danganronpa series
---
üò≥
---
Wait its pink? Fuck i am colorblind i thought it was dirty white
---
I don't get it.
---
I feel like it's a mind state u put on.
---
I experienced it myself, for a time I chased to ranking up tryharding the shit out of the game I just got pissed after every game.
---
Then I met an experienced guy who didn't give a fck about his rank and tried to improve his playstyle by just playing altruistic, getting that good feeling of advancing ur game to the next point of enjoyment. 
---
I reflected it on myself and just hit rank4 within a week as solo survivor.
---
Still that only answer half of my question. Why claudette shouldn't be punished?
---
Contagious laughter for sure.
---
I tried to make it still kinda viable but not that much of an annoyance fir survivors
---
That's why they DC though.
---
Survivors often DC for one of two reasons:
---
1) They think what you're doing is bullshit (Iri Hatchets and Infantry Belt).
---
2) "Haha, you didn't kill me so no Pip/Challenge/BBQ stack for youuuu!"
---
Salty Survivor mains who DC primarily for the second reason *would* downvote this solely because it takes away "What little power survivors have".
---
Bond. Go find someine else to get you healed.
---
Ugh...Stupid Sexy Squidward.
---
On Twitch, most streamers have their stream recorded. It‚Äôs accessible on that platform in their profile.
---
Thing is, yeah dc'ing because the killer is a scumbag is one thing but you know as well as I do that people dc purely because they get outplayed too. In fact, that is far more common in my experience. "Oh I got downed fair and square, guess I'll dc."
---
It's not hate, it's just that he's an objectively bad killer. He's great at securing the first hit on survivors, but after that point, he's practically an M1 killer with nothing to help him in a chase
---
this is so badass, more please
---
PWYF absolutely has a condition, it requires you inconsistently ride your obsession's ass for about a minute in order to get that 15% bonus and you lose said bonuses whenever you try to hit someone. Heaven forbid you get a super immersed obsession who you can never ever find.

---
They remade this for Legion then remove one for Feng entirely .. lol
---
I know, but I can just guess the distance to a gen and crouch a bit earlier.
---
Had the same bug with hooks 1 game. Hooks completly white. Looks weird
---
Insidious Tombstone Myers at the hook
---
It seemed like a pretty fair analysis to me, they're right, the killer basically has no power aside from sometimes having debuffs on their M1 attack, but if they manage to down and hook that person then the debuff gets lifted. They'd get destroyed.
---
Stinky medicine
---
so If I just slug and win in 3 minutes, I should get a double pip?
---
yeah nah.
---
I stopped watching Monto too. I feel like he encourages toxicity.
---
They actually had it at one point for a short time, I don‚Äôt know why they removed it
---
&gt; is the matchmaking that bad? 
---
Everyone: yes.
---
BHVR: we'll nerf pig.
---
I dunno how he didn't see that trap, for me it was like a Beacon of "Nope"
---
But there's a chance nobody's there and you wasted a huge amount of time walking crouched, wich suuuucks
---
The feng mafia has never been so strong... until now
---
They have a timer for how long you've waited on mobile, I'd be fine with that even being added.
---
I‚Äôm gonna complain because I got a right to do so. I did my grind and now they‚Äôre taking it away with nearly half of all the goals. So people who did it later can get the same reward for half the time I put in. Where‚Äôs the fairness in that. 
---
Their tome is stupid, not my post.
---
And you lose it when they unhook or you're within 20m
---
Oh wait no, it doesn't have that CONDITION
---
Gonna be live probably some time tomorrow.
---
Tomorrow
---
This is what anti vaxx moms see when they play dbd
---
People just hate legion, he can be played well and when he is people basically can't do generators since they have to mend, and healing is pointless because he makes you injured and have a deep wounds effect when he hits you with his power.
---
Wait someone has passed it?
---
I haven‚Äôt played this game for months and I don‚Äôt plan on coming back any time soon with amount of obnoxious bugs in this game. I couldn‚Äôt care less even if they perma-ban people for one dc. That still doesn‚Äôt remove their right to do it
---
I love how having a lot of hours is considered toxic by this guy
---
So you agree that they have the right to dc
---
New killer confirmed
---
But its not a surprise , thats why i close my profile to randoms
---
Never called your post stupid, so calm the hell down.
---
Since you have a Reddit Account, you should have seen that they said "We will be changing the tome" *days* ago, unless you're one of those people who just skips the pinned topics.
---
Let's not say this is about time when it wasn't. You got your time's worth, or at the very least you thought it was worth it at the time. Just because no one else did doesn't make it anyone else's fault you put in that much effort.
---
Also, you making this a "I gots the rights to do so" argument is most definitely making me just downvote and move on after this. Having the right to be annoying and whine doesn't mean other people have to listen to it.
---
He got a new skin in the premium rift and there he looks stronger and It's my main skin for him now
---
I personaly just dont like him at all. Faceing a lehion in a game is just annoying as hell. Constantly meanding over and over again. I also dont like playing legion. Not gonna lie im a good killer but i suck with legion. Legion can somehow be good if you play him very well but even if you are a god with legion you will still struggle against good survivors. Legion is not meaned to be top tier, his/her ability is not good enough. You might shine at lower ranks but i even see wraith players in the redranks doing way better then legion ever could.
---
After trying a few different ones for a while I settled on a gen-stopping/tracking build with Surveillance, Pop Goes the Weasel, Discordance and Ruin. Sometimes I replace Discordance with Thrilling Tremors and Ruin with Corrupt Intervention. 
---
I absolutely adore Surveillance and I found it's far more useful than having Whispers+Monitor. I'm playing with no add-ons though and trying to get better at ending chases.
---
kind of have to agree - yes, i know, you could give a shit - but seeing as you most likely recently completed all this, that does mean you were aware changes were gonna be made (let‚Äôs not be naive and act like you didn‚Äôt know the changes were coming) which at that point you could have put your grind on pause for a couple days, and get back to work when they‚Äôre fixed just like everyone else, 
---
and on the matter of fair? cmon. life isn‚Äôt fair first of all. and no one forced you to do any of those challenges. had they been a requirement, with a ‚Äúmust complete by this day‚Äù stamp on em, then yes. that would be unfair. 
---
now move on. talk some shit to me. and feel better knowing you did it ‚Äúthe hard way.‚Äù
---
when life becomes fair, please be sure to send me the memo. i sure could use it
---
True... if you're 12
---
She puts a trap on your head
---
BUNNY FENG WHEN!!
---
The new survivor perk looks op af.
---
Welp, if you think that's toxic. You never played killer before, no matter what you say
---
Rancor. Bad luck for him
---
Also, destroying a lit totem creates a noise notifiucation or all players including the killer so keep that in mind.
---
Except, you know, kinda defeats the purpose of legacy prestiege
---
I have never seen a map with less than 5 totems.
---
I‚Äôm guilty of this. I apologized in the post game chat and they were understanding so all good.
---
ill admit, im a idiot and did not realize that, granted it was more so the flashlight one was more of a catalyst to my rant, its not like it was one challenge half of them are either grinds, or luck based.
---
&gt;Damn it's sooo survivor sided that I've seen exactly 2 people, since endgame-collapse came out, that escaped with a key after the hatch has been closed.
---
So you play once or twice a month apparently
---
&gt;It's not survivor sided since no one ever brings keys
---
Hahahahahaha.. HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
&gt;I've brought in more keys myself than I've seen other survivors do.
---
Still, doesn't count if you play once a month
---
&gt;And mine I always bring with the aura addon to see the killer cause I know I probably won't have a chance of using it on the hatch.
---
I have no idea what are you talking about but ok.
---
Do you play in America? That would explain a lot if that's the case
---
It's tru3, what can we expect?
---
Yeah, they're making most of them a lot less grindy (like the 25 unhooks becomes 10 or 15), and this specific challenge will only require 1 unhook.  
---
It's supposed to be coming out this week.
---
What has been done before?
---
Human garbage both in and out of the game.
---
LF is a killer.
---
LF is Leatherface.
---
I imagine it could be good with a gen jockey and immersed playstyle.
---
I agree 100% with you. Ive been a hag main for almost a year until I learned GF.
---
WAZZZUUUUUUUUP
---
Ah yes, this meme again
---
It's hard to know when a killer is a low level killer unfortunately.
---
This is called pity and I usually do no matter how "toxic" I'm playing.
---
Also, is this a reverse witch hunt?
---
Why do people hate urban? I thought people were tired of  a agressive playstyle.
---
It‚Äòs those tome challenges. A lot of people are doing them hence why a lot of people are queueing up as killer.
---
It's *nice,* it's just not going to have much of an observable impact.
---
Most people have already seen at least one Jigsaw box and they're pretty evenly spread, and can be heard from a distance. If they want to remove it they still can. In most cases though, it just encourages them to do gens before removing it which isn't really ideal for you. The game goes faster, you have less idea of which box they'll be at at any given time which is just less information for you, and the timer is still plenty to get the trap off without stressing.
---
It also has 0 effect if a gen goes off while they're hooked.
---
Why is everyone so crazy about these cartoon girls anyway?
---
Is this supposed to be impressive?
---
Because drawing concepts and 3D Modelling are two separate forms of art.
---
Not after this next patch for Legion
---
We played best we could with only 2 of us in the backwater swamp and still hadn't gotten rid of ruin. It was a tough match-up, lol. 
---
 
---
Yes.... ? I think.
---
Don't sleep on your portals. The insidious buff means you can check your gens by leaving one close by across the map. You can also leave one on the stair case of the basement when you have someone down their. Scares the crap out of people. 
---
Demo's presence is his power tbh. He feels pretty alien compared to other killers and that tends to throw survivors off in my experience.
---
true, that skin is great, i like to mix it it with the base mask, he looks way more buffed
---
I have done it this way but I apologized at the end game chat because one of them 4%ed and I hooked her again... Challenges are turning me into a monster.
---
You obviously don't play on consoles. Regardless of rank, NOED is ever present.
---
I mean honestly I miss all the long hairstyles, especially Kate's. Sure it basically looked like a mop smacked on her head that was freaking out for every single movement but I really liked it honestly.
---
I played a game where there was a swf duo with a clicky clicky type of survivor. Anyways, somewhat early in the game I ended up doing a moonwalk mindgame when she was camping the pallet and downed her. She immediately dced followed by her friend that dc'd mere seconds after, there were still 5 gens left and ruin was still up at this point. The rest of the match turned into a farming simulation.
---
Y√¶t
---
Bro, do you even Bubba?
---
Lol not to his standard obviously
---
Read the post you dubass, you are saying no to killer getting a bbq stack if you dc for getting tunneled, but in order for it to even be considered tunneling, you wouldve had to have been hooked before, which wouldve given the killer a bbq stack. That makes your entire argument on this post worthless...
---
that killer is me....
---
Bro this is so cringe bro I‚Äôm gonna cry #OreoHomo
---
i know it seems like self promotion, but I‚Äôm genuinely happy that I completed my first DBD YouTube video. it‚Äôs nothing good, but I put effort into it and have been struggling with depression and this is the first ‚Äúproductive‚Äù thing I‚Äôve done other than go to work in a while!!! I‚Äôll put the link in the replies but plz don‚Äôt take this as self advertisement I couldn‚Äôt care less about views
---
https://youtu.be/9mimN4IEZvU
---
Lol no. Works with anyone just use agitation.to me
---
This is the millionth time ive seen a "haha stupid survivor toxic behind pallet while i stalk"
---
Seriously the most uncreative sub
---
I thought they said they didn't want a Killer who relies on sacrifices/kills for his power, did they say the same thing about injuring?
---
Probably a low population of players in your region. I seem to find games a lot faster when queuing as killer than survivor.
---
Leatherface biggest strength is to defend unhooks so it isn't uncommon for them to proxy / facecamp.
---
I think it's become a meme at this point, but leatherface is the killer that tends to camp the most
---
You understand the powerhouse that is insidious bubba?
---
I see where the wraith was coming from regarding the 4k (barring comments about saltiness and all that).
---
The problem with the current "balance" of dbd are that tunneling/camping are logical (IF you don't lose much pressure), just like rushing the gens is THE logical strategy. And the higher your rank, the more sweaty you have to play in order to pip.
---
The emblem system was created to encourage interaction and discourage camping/tunnelling/genrushing/blendetting, but it is a fail at that in the sense that it can be worked around. Taking out a survivor asap is still very valuable for killers, just like completing the gens as fast as possible for survivors.
---
The pip system does a very poor job incentivizing fun interaction/disincentivizing unfun gameplay. As of now, all of these issues are mostly countered via meta perks (DS, BT, Unbreakable, Ruin, forever builds, etc.) rather than via behavioral manipulation.
---
At his rank I bet insidious bubba is lol.
---
This is a survivor challenge, not a killer challenge
---
I play on ps4. Stop bullshitting.
---
But its really sad...
---
I will admit that I bought 4 tiers because I was 4 away from the beautiful Claudette hair, but other than that I worked towards the Tier 70. The people claiming that the only way to get to tier 70 at the moment is to buy a lot of tiers are wrong, it just takes a lot of time. The charm is so small though, especially on survivor.
---
Yes u can play walking near the hook etc but facecamp Is stupid...
---
They'll probs be green rarity and cost 250-300 shards
---
Just played with an ark Claudette who got downed, slugged and after about 2mins of sitting there she got hooked. Killed herself about 30secs later when she finally came back and realised the game had started. üòê
---
Go go Power Dweets!
---
Legion suffers from a power that is not interactable.
---
If you're facing a Nurse you can try to avoid her jumps by weaving around corners or suddenly changing direction.
---
If you're facing a Trapper you can guess where the traps will be and avoid them.
---
If you're facing a Hillbilly you can avoid long stretches to counter his chainsaw sprint and stick to walls to stun him.
---
If you're facing a Legion you will be run down and put into Deep Wounds. There's nothing you can do to stop it.
---
And once you're in Deep Wounds, you're mending for the next 12 seconds. There's nothing you can do to change this.
---
And that's it. There's no interaction, there's no counter gameplay, there's just "Get stabbed and mend."
---
It's very uninteractive and considered very unfun. And while the killer shouldn't care about the survivors' fun, the Devs do care about everyone's fun.
---
It's also hard to balance since any small tweak seems to propel the power from "Absolutely worthless" to "Staggeringly overpowered" with little in between.
---
Power-level wise, Legion isn't bad, but they aren't spectacular. They don't pressure as well as some others, but they don't falter as bad as other killers. Distinctly in the middle, I'd say.
---
Expect incoming nerfs to their direct stats on the 3rd with the Oni release. But, you're also getting a pretty huge buff in the use of Undetectable perks like Beast of Prey or Nemesis. Using one of those perks will let you gain the Undetectable status midchase. Since Deep Wound ticking down is based on your terror radius, gaining Undetectable starts the Deep Wound timer for any survivors. So you'll be chasing one person while their timer is ticking down - They're forced to either continue running from you and down to Deep Wounds, or mend and down to your basic attack.
---
Not if dedicated servers push you 0.00001 centimeters into the gate when you get off
---
Imagine playing less than 20 games with the best addons and perks and thinking that justifies your opinion on how balanced a killer is.
---
I said nothing about BBQ stack dumpkopf. I just don't want killer to get the sacrifice point.
---
&gt;Yes u can play walking near the hook etc but facecamp Is stupid...
---
Facecamping it is what it is, you asked why bubbas camp. Unfortunately camping more often than not rewards killers with a 4k, even if they don't pip from it.
---
Thats still better than sandbagging your teammate's chances of escape
---
That grounds play kinda of made us laugh, because it was hilarious on how stupid we were being. Nevertheless we started to turn the game around when you got permanently blinded. Too bad you got blinded, it was going to be a close game.
---
This again...
---
- No one has the right to dictate how another person plays the game.
---
- Your opponent trying to win is not toxicity, it's the main aspect of a versus game. If you think your opponent trying to win is toxic, go play a PvE game.
---
Have hope! There is potential they are seeking solutions to add cross progression, but I‚Äôm sure such a system is complicated for game that has a year of updates under it‚Äôs belt, I wager it‚Äôll be a feature they surprise us with, but we‚Äôll just have to wait and see.
---
Official post from BHVR btw
---
To be fair, bhvr tends to stick to one theme for many characters in terms of cosmetics. Meg has like 10 running/sports outfits and like 2-3 that aren't.

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/871403#Comment_871403
---
 I bought this game a few days ago. Bought for myself on pc, and for my sister on xbox. 
---
 So I was playing with her xbox and had a great match. I was the last one of 4 alive, injured, running from nurse. And last second before she catched me I found a hatch and survived. It was amazing! I saw that hit animation passed throught me. 
---
 And yesterday, now on my pc, I was the last one alive again. 2 disconnected, one dead, and me injured again. Killer chases me and I just do not knew what to do, so looked at him and started to crouch stand crouch stand.. he suddenly do not attack me, and it seemed he shows to follow him. He show me ther hatch and lets me escape. After game he says to report disconnects on purpose. 
---
Theese games were awesome, looking forward to play even more, and slowly progress throught rift pass. Sorry for mistakes, I tried my best.
---
If you mean literally invisible then that was the wraith.
---
The way to counter him is:
---
A) Look for his outline, he isn't truly invisible and can be seen
---
B) Use the perk spine chill, this will let you know if he is heading your way
---
C) Shine a flashlight on him while he is invisible, this will stun him 
---
D) Listen for a woosh kind of sound, this happens when he cloaks or uncloaks
---
E) listen out for his bell sound, this means he is uncloaking and will be about to attack. He can't attack whilst invisible. 
---
If you see his outline then try and break line of sight and get to the nearest window or pallet. He gets a speed boost on the first swing so watch out.
---
The fact you said he t bagged you makes me think you mean ghostface and that he didn't have a terror radius. How to counter ghostface:
---
A) use spine chill - if it lights up then hide
---
B) look around you when on a generator 
---
C) If you catch him looking at you at medium range then stare at him and put him on the center of your screen, this can break him out of stealth or break line of sight. At long range, try and break line of sight and run away. At close range you can either try and run away round a corner and find a pallet or try and bait a hit from him which will break him out of stealth and give you a quick speed boost.
---
Bear in mind that he builds up a stalks meter and once it's full he will be able to one shot you. He will build this is up faster by leaning round a corner but can still build it up relatively fast while just standing and staring at you. You also can't break him out of stealth if you are too far away.
---
Such an awesome idea! I loved that game, as unknown as it is -- terrifying moments, especially her reveal!
---
I don't think AFK killers care about giving people a proper match.
---
He could have bought it
---
Yeah but name me a game code that isn't a mess tho.
---
I mean, BHVR have a spaghetti special for sure, but game industry in general isn't an example of a perfect code. Probably no big organisation has a totally clean 100% working code. Mainly because perfect code is not something feasible.
---
And it hasn't been a week yet. You shouldn't account weekends.
---
Actually?
---
Idk, I want some original killers
---
Pain Killers sounds like hell on earth. Imagine a full squad of survivors each using that perk. Pre-nerf instaheals were tame in comparison.
---
The first power needs a cool down when the boys are broken. Rather than the killer using them to see, they could be motion sensors that he sets down. Having to switch to a view mode would take too much time, and allowing them to move on their own isn't something bhvr devs would do. 
---
I don't think he should have a third ability at all. That seems too much. 150% for 2 seconds is already barely enough to out some distance between you and the killer. Taking away some Sprint speed and halving the Sprint duration is too much.
---
Yeah that was crazy after getting chased by Mr Felton I was like "great now I gotta be chased by this crazy lady now to DX"
---
True
---
Definetely not. Just no brainer and considered as toxic as well.
---
15 4ks in red ranks doesn't mean much of anything - a decent player can do that with just about any killer, including add-onless Legion. I've seen people go on perkless, add-onless red rank 4k sprees with Leatherface and old Freddy. Another streamer has a 112 -or-thereabouts 4k streak playing Plague without Ruin or add-ons.
---
Contrary to popular belief, it is actually not impossible nor even particularly difficult to win most of the time as killer in this game, if you are an even only somewhat competent player. Good killer players win the vast majority of their matches. That's because most of the players you will face are pretty bad or mediocre at best at this game, particularly on the survivor side where you have 4 players per match with varying skill levels. Maybe that's because people tend to not even think of this game as something you can become better at, and thus don't even think or try to improve, or maybe this game is actually not so easy for people, but either way, most people are not good at this game, including red rank players.
---
So the people he faced are in all likeliness not top-level players by much of any stretch either, let alone all four in one respective lobby. And so even all my thoughts on this opinion of his and on other stuff aside, this "experiment" just shows that any killer is viable in red rank public matchmaking, just like thousands upon thousands of hours of recorded gameplay footage (and global statistics) have shown time and again for years.
---
With that said, I do think this approach to Wraith is totally legit (but it's also totally not new). Everybody knows that getting the first hit in with Wraith is pretty easy - so why not get *two* easy "first" hits on a survivor, to actually down them without having to have really chased them? So getting the surprise hit on someone and then disengaging, to later catch them by surprise again and down them if they are still injured, is a sensible strategy. And it's also obvious to support this strategy with perks like Sloppy Butcher and Nurse's Calling, as well as add-ons that aid in getting the jump on players, like The Ghost, Bone/Coxcombed Clapper, Swift Hunt, All Seeing.
---
Yeah, or he maybe plays a lot
---
Can confirm, simply not true.
---
She would make for an amazing Killer = Tall, base speed, moths that work the way Clowns Bottles do -- slow down Survivors mid-chase! I can see it all, and it looks so sick! Ah, sweet sweet imagination, lol!
---
I just found the mori funny. You could learn to have some fun now and then... it is a game after all XD
---
Good meme, but please refrain from using emojis
---
Isn‚Äôt that SpiriBilly‚Äôs older cousin?
---
This is a really cool idea. I think that his movement speed is a bit too fast if he shortens the burst of speed when a survivor is hit. The perks are really well made. The nanobots are a incredibly cool and new idea. The hacking code break may need to be shortened but it might not. 
---
Overall, i could totally see this becoming a killer in the future. 10/10
---
Oh boy, you play leatherface? Yikes
---
It‚Äôs because of the build. That‚Äôs why his rankings look so weird to us. He‚Äôs got Wraith at fourth because he‚Äôs including the add-ons and perks that he likes to use.
---
I see. Thank you.
---
Thanks, lol.
---
I reached a new level of cringe
---
Maybe it was because a started to play more. I usually played like 6 games per week. But I wasn't much good. Then I started playing and voila red ranks. And I kind of am looking for chases instead of doing gens.
---
Yes pleeeeeaase!!!
---
No Kitty Kate?
---
I tried to get my friend into the game. We met a camping wraith with an ebony mori on our second game.
---
I was a bit mad that this was what they were introduced to so early
---
Or any time a dull totem is cleansed it paralyzes the Survivor in place for 15 seconds as they try to swat away a Swarm of Moths that were nesting in the totem!
---
You have to do the chess game in order to reach the king, if you know what I mean.
---
You know what bigger hands mean
---
It's just an emoji literally no one cares but you
---
Aaaay, you got the right community this time!
---
Oh... I wasn‚Äôt aware of it...  :‚Äô)
---
If it glows...
---
Ew 2nd chance perks like a pussy
---
I miss grandma Laurie along with quentin and nea. xD
---
Ok killer main
---
Are you legitimately tunneling? As in you're specifically going for a single person?
---
Replace the camera function with a directional AoE of Killer's Instinct
---
Ok entitled survivor
---
Oh shit apocalypse is close
---
he can't continue a chase if he does though, its a free escape if he wants to waste time. Keep him busy. If three gen is active then he has to monitor those gens aggressively or he has to give up chase after chase. He either gets one of you, giving the others the chance to finish the gen, or you guys sneak past him and succeed.
---
You don‚Äôt gotta feel dirty, you don‚Äôt have to answer to anyone. Your job is to kill them by any means necessary and if you get 4Ks by camping and tunneling, who cares?
---
Im only 58 with all challenges done
---
The second is ok imo, numbers wpuld have to be tested but.
---
The first seems kinda meh for a hex.Make it the opposite(per gen remaining), so they start with up to 30% penalty, and it lowers as they complete.This would slow early game,which is what most killers need.It would also make it an alternative to ruin. Alternatively leave it as is but make it non hex.
---
Third seems pretty meh to me at least, and not sure how well red stain reduction in % would work.
---
But anyway cool concept!
---
I'm on tier 65 lol I definitely got it
---
If you picked the image from internet it probably came from here.
---
The mods sometimes remove posts if they‚Äôre not directly DbD related( keyword sometimes), so people used to get around it by pasting a picture of billy in the corner of their memes
---
...wtf, I don't think I've ever panicked as a Killer so hard that I became blind, lol!
---
idk man I have plenty of fun playing against ghost face as a survivor
---
#You little-
---
I always play as killer but yeah the match times suck, sometimes it can take a long time to find a match especially in the earlier ranks.
---
As you rank up it generally gets faster but you won‚Äôt ever get as fast as survivor no matter what.
---
Be the change you want to see
---
Well Oni definitely doesn't disappoint, as unoriginal as his Powers are, at least he looks awesome!
---
Ummmmm accidental more like teach me
---
Exactly surivors have every tool at their advantage to win even if you do that. Just play the game normally you will always get salt from surivors for just killing them.
---
Idk but do u know when for console?
---
I think dcing against Iri head huntress is fine, and that comes from an killer main so yeah.
---
Yeah I love when it happens, so I the challenge is over and I can play usual again
---
Even Omnigul‚Äôs screams cannot beat Amandannygorgon‚Äôs.
---
Dont see the problem.
---
Overwatch also has a competent dev team.
---
I just run the pineapple shirt with the fedora from the head case and the tuxedo pants from owning the full OFaM DLC. he be stylin
---
December 3rd I think
---
December 2021
---
True that lol
---
I'm a 50/50 player and after reading all this I can tell that you're a solo survivor who happens to be salty. Saying the game is massively killer favored in almost every aspect is just too much. If you think this way, you just have to get better and adapt to your matches. Killers get absolutely fucked by SWFs it's not even funny, while obliterating solo survivors. This game will never be truly balanced, let me tell you that.
---
4 commodious toolboxes are far worse lol.
---
If only meg was as buff as she looked in the running outfit with a bag art...
---
both hes a bad charcter that just kind of anoying i dont hate him but i can see why people hate going against him
---
2021 how wasn‚Äôt it released already for pc?
---
Errrmmm... OchiDo? Lol.
---
Besides, I'm not attacking him. I'm a big fan, just noting that I disagree with what he said.
---
Then just intentionally missing one time to make it fair and square
---
Frenzy can‚Äôt down someone. At best it works once that you vault and cancel your power, catching them off guard trying to window juke you (if they don‚Äôt hear the entity sound). The cool down is so long that a good survivor will be gone. If you go against potatoes, then sure it will work, but then again so will monstrous shrine and furtive chase.
---
It‚Äôs only bullying when the killer does it, survivors are just perfect in every way and would never bully
---
Its not about where they spawn dude. The game doesn't end as soon as you find the 1 guy. And on huge maps, its good to know exactly when to crouch mid game. Also, it guarantees you'll know where the last person is, in case you close the hatch, wich is nice. Anyway,just my opinion
---
100 cells per rift
---
They might be teabaging because your tunneling
---
Also, more Ash outfits. Seeing him in that hat gets me giddy :D
---
&gt;**Edit\*:** You can claim you won as survivors when you run out of the game, but if you end the game with 15k BP and the killer has 27k+ who really won? *(and then we aren't even talking BBQ and offering bonuses)*
---
Ok killer
---
Same with the Huntress, weirdly enough
---
That's not a bug, it's new hatch skin!
---
Not like looking at him is gonna break his shroud anyway.
---
If he swung this probably wouldn't have happened.
---
i really shouldn't have to plan my play time around certain times of day for a game this big
---
I love it
---
If he was off the hook for more than thirty seconds, it isn't. If you had the choice of going for the guy you just hooked or the guy who unhooked him, and you choose the guy just taken off the hook, THEN you're tunneling. But if he stupidly stays by the hook and is the first person you run into more than thirty seconds later, he's fair game.
---
Not bad since my karma for posts hasn‚Äôt even dropped, and the reddit is literally flooded with killers because of ques, but whatever makes you feel better about being toxic, killers can‚Äôt be toxic I guess lmao only survivors. That attitude alone is toxic but I really don‚Äôt care
---
I‚Äôve had this happen with lockers once on Springwood, every single one for the whole match, weirded me out.
---
I care immensely.
---
They should just not implement this at all and wait til the virgins get all fussy and sweaty then release it as a stand alone cosmetic that costs $45
---
Poor Nea ;(
---
Perk: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Effect: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH(HH/HH/HH)HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
They can't decide what you do, but obviously nobody likes being face camped and I myself would expect to be called a bitch if I did it
---
Well yeah. It's incredibly frustrating. If I get outplayed and go down, ok, I just lost this chase. But when the actual mechanics are a coin flip over half the time, I just feel robbed. It's getting really old because it's getting survivors killed that otherwise may have escaped.
---
Looks like my dryer
---
Nobody‚Äôs entitled to a free escape, even if there are 2 DC‚Äôs.
---
I think that‚Äôs what he meant
---
This is the closest we are going to get to ManBearPig in the game...
---
you fuckin w0t
---
I feel as though the relying on injuring thing means keeping them injured, like Legion and Plague, the Oni is basically the opposite, encouraging healing and staying healthy.
---
I stopped reading when found you take the game competitively. Thanks god it was on the first paragraph. 
---
Stop taking it competitively, is a horror game, enjoy the game as a game. If you die, you die, thats supposed to happens. Also if you expect someone to balance the asymetric game around xbox.... I wish you good luck.
---
Sincerily almost always surv player.
---
Trap placement made you vault over it, while the killer interacted with it because of a different hitbox. There, solved.
---
I just realized how crazy strong Myers is for lifting you up with one hand.
---
Exactly. The fact they let us do the gens was more than fair, they honestly deserved to have us hooked so they don't depip
---
They need to fix grabs. They almost never work, and when they do, the game just decides to be generous to the survivors (as always) amd let them go
---
Im actually really proud of this community atm, My friend I introduced to the game just hit 50 hrs of gameplay and she said she hasn't gotten one negative end game message
---
Wrong, my sole existence is to end emojis and consolidate LOL and XD's place as the universally superior method of transmitting emotions across the galaxy
---
This should help https://imgur.com/gallery/tcYJ2P3
---
I somehow manage to turn my salt into jokes and it's actually working...kinda
---
For example, each time I encounter a tryhard I say something along the lines of "Try harder Daddy"
---
When i get killed pretty fast: "That's probably the fastest hook-up I ever had, damn"
---
The one where they show aura when they run over orbs?
---
You keep calling them toxic and no lifers which makes you sound toxic. No need to get upset that people are better than you in a video game.
---
Sure, almost every aspect...
---
Apart from keys
---
And un-mind-game-able pallets
---
And god windows
---
And Killer shack
---
And corn
---
And Claudette
---
And gen times
---
And toolboxes
---
And Exhaustion perks
---
And map design
---
And the fact that Survivors get another chance to escape after losing the hatch race.
---
I mean, noed and killer powers would directly counter it, but okay.
---
Imagine unironically getting an aneurysm from smiley faces on the internet
---
Yeah that one.. I think it should be like the Plagues addon, that the aura is only shown when they bleed
---
Was it a clown, a fucking clown you look like the fucking clown, you look horrible

Please get this

You‚Äôre right*
---
I finally found the picture and words to describe my sleep paralysis demon.
---
Ok. Except MoM and WGLF what other perks benefits of that changes? 
---
Spoiler: none. So I'd say is a pretty direct buff since only two specific perks benefit from it, nothing else
---
Slugging isn‚Äôt toxic just slugging for the last guy is. If there‚Äôs other people left I could t give a shit about slugging . Or if you just end up leaving someone on the ground because you have another chase. I‚Äôm not saying you have to pick up survivors. It used to be one of the more viable strategies when slugging was almost meta
---
Or when wraith stands still right on top of the hatch so survivor can't go through and then he closes it lol
---
What if dbd is dead and you don't like it well then you still have that tattoo
---
Which legion
---
None taken, I'm not a great killer so I was happy with the outcome. Sorry if i came across as big headed or anything it wasnt my intention.
---
Yea I can‚Äôt have an opinion I guess. Shame on me for calling out something that seems toxic because abusing game mechanics to force a easy 4k isn‚Äôt gamebreaking at all. It‚Äôs mainly a problem for solo que‚Äôs who play with a lot of assholes. Or when survivors dc resulting in it being almost impossible to complete all 5 gens but the killer slugs for the final survivor anyway. Yea totally fair. I don‚Äôt even see the point in wanting to pip so bad the game has been out for so long we all practically know the rankings are almost meaningless. Just resulting in even longer que times the better rank you have. Getting a 4K isn‚Äôt even that enjoyable anymore playing the game as much I enjoy just playing the game. Whether I get a 3-4K is meaningless as long as I don‚Äôt get a 1-2k
---
It‚Äôs easier to pronounce Globglogabgalab than that name. I‚Äôm scared.
---
How little you look behind you while running gives me anxiety.
---
I had no idea I needed this, but I did and my life would be incomplete without it. Well done!
---
Yes gimme more stacks please üò©
---
Yeah but not everyone plays for points, that's the problem. Most of the players that choose killer, don't have fun or at least don't have as much fun as playing survivor
---
it's a dope tattoo, don't be a rat
---
Wouldnt that be even stronger?
---
They wouldnt have to be near the orbs
---
Can they also fix hatches that literllay enter a survivor model only to leave it again without a hit?
---
i bought every dlc :D cuz i  love this game and im a neeerd
---
Dedicated servers made shit even worse because the dev team can‚Äôt code for shit.
---
Don‚Äôt forget shit like using deadhard/septics, losing your exhaustion/medkit and still dying without tanking the hit.
---
Someone out there has clicked a flashlight all game and teabagged at every pallet to get a killer to follow them all game and thought the same in post game chat
---
Its me. I care. I already did the "by any means necessary", get good results. But now im thinking if maybe there are other ways than being a "all means" killer or should i just push through with killer in shining armor.
---
We will see what happens in season 4
---
Laughs in Switch, no messages lol but at the same time I can't be salty
---
but now even the healthy survivors can be seen. Then you could only see the injured ones. And now you can just not take the blood as oni and you will see everybody always..
---
More alike insulting his family. That ticks him off. Good on Jonathan for clearing his head off the hate and bullshit.
---
It's still a dope ass tattoo, move along please.
---
This some loony tunes shit right here.
---
that sum dank shit
---
I didn't no the Hag was real
---
Very hard to loop, and some of her rarest addons greatly exacerbate the issue. Basically you can get grabbed anytime without any warning.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt post this on reddit, this subreddit has a lot of entitled killer mains that won‚Äôt leave room for discussion, just talk down to you like a child
---
Stealing content= uploading twitch clips.  ‚ÄúSTOLEN‚Äù public videos STOLEN in front of everyone. No one knows. Mocked who?? Mr stalker??
---
Ah, perfect, then

Yeah the pick up thing is just dumb. Didn't know they disappear
---
Biiiiiig thanks! However, I currently don‚Äôt do commissions, an animals aren‚Äôt really my strong point. Thanks for asking though ‚ú®

Really missing the definition of bullying.

They do start dropping again after his power ends, so he does still get a good ammount of vision, but I feel like the plagues add on is much stronger.

‚ÄúThe Ghost‚Äù - Soot and Coxcombed Clapper for ez grab
---
If you slug them. They're not doing anything and one extra person has to come off a gen and heal them. There is counter play. Hell if you're that confident in your ability to chase you eat it and catch them 10 seconds later.
---
You're complaining there's no way around it when there's multiple ways around it.
---
... Its litterally just a weaker version of the old one, + it takes 16 secs to activate. 
---
Im sure you mean the purple version, but no its not better. Sure it gives you endurance, but thats for 8 secs. I have almost never had a purple insta med work against me after the change, you can literally just count to 8 secs then m1 them kinda like what you can do with BT
---
^
---
If I do make a pig piece, it‚Äôll be illegal for me to not call it  ‚ÄúJigsaw‚Äôs Baptism‚Äù.
---
Or he could just slug them like 99% of killers do, still effectively requiring another survivor to stop working on a gen (in solo queue probably 2 people) to come and make a play. If he had just lunged here he would be fine..
---
How do you know they were SWF? Asking because I can‚Äôt tell from the picture alone.
---
Checked their steam profiles in the lobby
---
The only reason I flashlight click is to get the killer off my friend
---
Anti vax medicine
---
Once 4/3/2 pallets are broken by you, the next time you're pallet stunned will summon the entity to immediately break it. You still suffer from the stun penalty, however. Putting enduring (reduces duration of pallet stuns, and ONLY pallet stuns, DS still stuns you for 5 seconds) on will result in a free hit. Typically, a killer won't respect pallets with spirit fury charged.
---
one missed lunge doesnt = one hit
---
Upvote for high quality PNG image with well photoshopped santa hat.
---
Merry december and soon christmas my photoshop-adept friend :)
---
I hate when they do that ... The good thing is that now the premades will do that less since the penalty of dc arrives :3
---
Nvidida highlights exists.
---
How has this gone to top page AGAIN. i have seen like 14 dif versions of this.
---
It might not be, but it seems too cordinated to not be a SWF
---
Nice quick and quiet play üëå
---
This is literally just the same thing from Overwatch but it makes less sense.
---
Had the brightness on my phone pretty low and this looked really scary. Think I'm going to reduce the brightness in game to give it that feeling I had when I first started.
---
Spend those bloodpoints!
---
I appreciate bright colors, easy to spot instead of colors that blend on.
---
Yeah, I was originally gonna do that ;^^, but didn‚Äôt know if I wanted to do other characters in this style, so I put escaped and kill icons to represent DBD as kinda a whole, with Trapper being the mascot and everything.
---
Let them get some distance too
---
Can we please fix totem spawns?
---
You don't have to be SWF to know that they need the hatch.
---
Thanks. üòä
---
Killer should invest in a pair of headphones, or ears.
---
Lol still an indirect buff? A direct buff is something that would DIRECTLY change a stat or the way the perk works.
---
At least were getting a Christmas sweater !
---
Dear sweet Jesus...
---
I have 450 hours. I've been rank 1 and stay in red ranks unless my mates want to play and I move down to purple for them. Get off your high horse. Playing survivor at rank 1 is nowhere near as difficult as you make out.
---
It's not just a ''normal'' one hand lift. He's lifting a living human being and not some bag of potatoes. Granted some players can be considered bags of potatoes, but you still gotta be crazy strong to overpower another human with such ease.. and one hand.
---
Myers seems more supernatural than the fucking spirit, in this regard.
---
I do this if I see the survivor tbag when I'm being slugged as second last survivor.
---
If the Killer actually hooks me they at least have some time (~15 seconds) before I die to get to the hatch. But hey, if they wanna slug I ain't got time for that.
---
honestly, people don‚Äôt use it that way. i just got downvoted.
---
Wut
---
This is an actual representation of this moment... it's terrifying
---
what episode is this?
---
I will, saved them for Oni
---
Game breaking? Oh my god spare me
---
normal behaviour for swf
---
I started to DC the second the third guy DC's. Fuck you, you're not getting the hatch.
---
sad but true

---
It could just be that it represents a good time in his life when he was playing the game and not straight up being a fanboy.
---
He sux, used to be way more fun before they reworked his power too
---
The thing is, you get BBQ stacks for doing what you're supposed to: hooking survivors. On top of that you also get to see the auras of survivors not near the hook, making it easier to find and hook them.
---
The comparable survivor perk only gives you extra BPs (also for doing what you should be doing), but has no added in-game benefit. 
---
I would only agree with adding disconnects to BBQ stacks if survivors got a stack for camping killers.
---
1) all the survivors have to do is not touch the orbs
---
2) no one would fucking trade their whole goddamn power for aura reading they may or may not get
---
Jesus Christ
---
Best perks for oni : knock out, thanatophobia, nurse's, and obviously ruin
---
Typically, I don't attempt to sandbag. If I run towards you with the killer on my tail, chances are I'm just running towards the route with the highest chance of survival, and you just happened to be there. Only time I'll sandbag is if you're a farmer or I'm running from a tombstone myers.
---
as a killer this thought terrifies me but as a survivorI can't figure out how to use it anymore so i agree lol
---
Hiding in the tall grass
---
You wanna die on this hill? Ok..
---
&gt;Lol literally a month ago I joined multiple games which ended immediately because the killers were deranking themselves so they could play against worse survivors so they could ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù.
---
This happens way more for survivors **and** several content creators actually showed this kind of behavior making it feel more acceptable. Jendanise is a clear example of that, being a fog whisper too
---
&gt;And they are litteraly giving timeouts for dc‚Äôs in the next patch.
---
Yes. And guess who made so many posts complaining about it? Who play only killers? Not quite
---
&gt;Not my fault they fucking lied about banning over dc‚Äôs forever ago.
---
Isn't a lie, they did but the threshold to be banned for that is so high that is very unlikely you'll get banned. Even for someone like he Denise that got like a rank reset everyday in terms of depips
---
&gt;But yea slugging for the last person is toxic af, because you just want to avoid endgame because you might not have a chance to 4k, when otherwise a 4yo could get the 4k at that point.
---
I can make the same argument saying that even a 4yo can get out by pressing one button for the hatch. Your point? The difference is, one has to find, Chase and hit you twice, so basically fail 3 times, while as a survivor you just need to press one button. That's it
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not saying only killers are toxic I‚Äôm just saying forcing a 4K because you feel entitled to it is toxic, mainly to the guy you slugged to get the 4k I don‚Äôt care about escaping or not it‚Äôs just bullshit that you have to bully one survivor because you want your precious 4K.
---
Can be said the same when people do **anything** to make sure **everybody** escapes. Body block while the other unhook is a clear example that happens very often. The difference is, one more hook or one less can make the difference between safe pip or depip while for survivors that save won't matter as much if they survive
---
&gt;Maybe survivors dc all the time when that happens because it‚Äôs toxic? Because they feel like slugging them for the 4th guy is a little unfair? That wouldn‚Äôt be it at all. Because a killer vs a trapped single survivor isn‚Äôt one sided at all. 
---
Ohh showing your power level here. So what about ruin gone in seconds, gens done in 5min and flash light click and teabag on **every.single.game**? That's fine right? Slug for catch the last guy is a strategy, the thing I listed are just to make people upset and **that** is actually toxic. Plus 1 v 1 scenario isn't one sided at all in this game since hatch exist and even if you fail to find it first you can also open it with a key (that can spawn in chests) or open the gates. So you have **SEVERAL** chances to deal with it
---
&gt;And how can you say working a gen after a killer kicking it being toxic or even compare it to slugging a survivor to get the last survivor when one is litteraly a game mechanic and the other is abusing a mechanic when your just strictly to bitchmade to possibly get a 3k.
---
Abusing a mechanic? No. That's entitlement my dear, if you're supposed to be picked up every single time, you would have unbreakable as base kit as survivor. It's intended as a strategy, **but** in YOUR rulebook that's abusing a game mechanic. That says a lot about you. 
---
You just showed how entitled you are if you think slugging is abusing a mechanic when is just a strategy and a risky one too since you can lose that pressure in an instant if you do it wrong. Are you serious? God damn.. the survivors rulebook sounds less of a meme and more a reality by just reading what you're saying rn
---
&gt;Like people that slug for a 4K are just too soft and need to have a little sense of empowerment because that‚Äôs their only chance in life to straight bully someone and then you get sad because the person who just straight isn‚Äôt having fun anymore dc‚Äôs because they actually want to play a game.
---
Guess what, also the killer. Behind the killer there's a person too and call them names or just straight up demising their life's just because they make a rational decision and use a strategy and don't follow **your rulebook**, doesn't mean they are worse human being. Do you even listen yourself?????
---
Are you ok dude? God damn, I don't know how to talk with someone that's so delusional
---
&gt; The devs have definitively stated it is not cheating. This is not some opinion. It either is or isn't. They have stated it is not.
---
Yes, of course the devs are going to publicly say it's not cheating.
---
* a) They don't want the hassle and expense of trying to enforce it in a never-ending losing battle.
---
* b) They want to avoid pissing off their customer base. You know, the people who pay them. If they said: "yeah, we're going to put this system in, but we don't think anyone should use voIP with it", what kind of effect do you think that would have? Not a good one. I would not be at all surprised to find that, on a personal level, a lot of them don't agree with it, because they never designed it that way originally. Otherwise, the game would have released with some form of communication.
---
The primary reason is A, but B plays a significant role.
---
&gt; Oh wait Discord can be run in your browser.
---
Yes, and on your phone. Both of which render what I said moot, which I admitted.
---
&gt; Face camping also goes against the spirit of the game. Is that cheating?
---
Given the game penalises you for it, there's an argument to be made there, for sure.
---
&gt; Teabagging goes against the spirit too, is that cheating? Chasing the killer around with flashlights in a group goes against the spirit of the game, is that cheating? Tunneling goes against the spirit of the game, is that cheating?
---
1. No, that's just being toxic/a dick, at least if you do it excessively.
---
2. That sounds like it might be funny the first time, but still pretty toxic, regardless. Also no, though there's probably an argument for it being reportable as unsportsmanlike.
---
3. Does it, though? I mean, I try not to, but if you know someone's on their last hook, why *wouldn't* you chase them down and secure the kill?
---
&gt; Farming BP goes against the spirit of the game, is that cheating?
---
Yeah, pretty sure that's actually reportable and bannable, if you can supply the proof.
---
Not throwing anymore than the meg heads walking everywhere or crouchdettes ending the game with a sick 6k points after not being chased the whole game
---
and you wont get any BP. whats the point?
---
What build do you run?
---
Ok dude whatever.. you guys won't ever be satisfied
---
20
---
9
---
This is cheating in my eyes.
---
Same reason I play shirtless David.
---
Hmm kinky
---
I already have all the perks and I can just do some plunders + ace games for items. I really don't care about being slugged for several minutes so that a Killer can get a 4K. Just hook me.
---
I got to use these names and skins with my team, lol
---
I did have on quick and quiet for when I jumped out of the locker.
---
Haha your edit gave you away bro
---
I love survivor mains who try to pretend they play killer and just fail at maintaining the image. Hilarious
---
I'd suggest grinding as much as you can and maybe buying the rift tiers the day before it closes? Cuz that way you can save your money if you somehow end up making it through by yourself... I bought about 10 levels (1000 cells) and quickly realized I didn't have to buy tiers to finish the pass.
---
Finally got my younger brother into this game, and I've been trying to teach him, but watching him figure out what works and what doesn't and getting a lot better on his own, is really satisfying.
---
May the power of the Dwight be with you
---
lol I play both sides actually at high level....survivor level 4-8 and killer 1-5. It is unfair sometimes....but whatever you say...killer main...
---
Just woke up and read Therapist as the rapist
---
I need a nea now its adorable and wholesome.
---
Buuut imagine if these were the real survivors like them aging over time.That would be cool for dream freddy.
---
really? if you are not on the direct center and you are both spamming space its not determined by which the server takes first?
---
For all the talk about Ruin, Pop is the real workhorse that carries a lot of my games.  
---
The only reason i feel it doesn't get talked about more is that it synergises so well with the most powerful killers (ones that can insta-down/end chases quickly, ensuring hooks) and it's power is disguised by general complaints regarding those killers.
---
Lovely
---
Right, all I'm saying is it's already a bit unfair--I'd make the same/a similar change to WGLF.
---
What?
---
Woah Calm down there buddy
---
Spend a little so you don't waste any you earn in a match...
---
So what you're trying to say is you have the right to show someone else's content when the owner does not want it to be publically available, that's even more trashy, how low can you go :MonkaS:
---
Everything that is for map interactions is the interact button. The skill check button is the sprint button. The perk abilities (such as dead hard) and the struggle button are on separate buttons. (By default on Xbox, LB is sprint/skill check, RB is interact, X is perk ability, and A is struggle. I changed Sprint to Y and interact to A.)
---
Oh not like that you perv !
---
I've never used it, I thought it just eliminated the notification not the creak of the doors opening?
---
i instantly thought of plague when I saw this, that would be sick, pun intended
---
I'm a dick for leaving a game where the Killer is just gonna slug me. OK cool.
---
Nah a double bp weekend would satisfy me.
---
Most appropriate title! =D
---
That's...what I just said...
---
This is like the laziest excuse for an opinion meme holy shit
---
Jo he's fucking blind. But to be fair, it's a pretty dark room.
---
This makes me want ‚ÄúThe Rake‚Äù as a killer.
---
Killer is not the host anymore of iam right
---
It looks like the mod for Skyrim that replaces Dragons with Macho Man Randy Savage
---
Shitting in tall grass*
---
Yes it should be out there, ooo I bet one pewdiepie said the N word you wish he deleted VOD and covered it up you racist. Let people be shown for who they really are.
---
I hope you're wrong, but you're probably right :(
---
saving people from bear traps and getting flashlight saves should give it stacks just my opinion
---
Yeah it really doesn't feel that reliable lol
---
Excuse me, but am i the only one who rarely sees spirit anymore? (Except when i play with a certain friend, if i do its always spirit due to her bad luck)
---
&gt; I do play both sides too and currently red rank at both of them
---
Nice brag. Couldn't resist putting that one out there, could you?
---
&gt; All I can say is git gud
---
I do more than well enough in my killer games, but thanks.
---
&gt; Also "minority" my ass,%50 of the survivors are playing in a at least 2 man SWF
---
Yeah, *now*. How much of the playerbase was actively trying to join the same lobby before SWF? Way less than that, I guarantee you.
---
Sure I‚Äôm delusional when getting a 4K with training wheels isn‚Äôt toxic whatsoever. Because killers just can never be toxic apparently lol. Comparing clicking flashlights to forcing an easy 4k is just laughable but I‚Äôm done with this I really don‚Äôt care at all was just saying it‚Äôs toxic just like almost everything else in this game.
---
Imagine the bunny outfit. But on detective tapp
---
Nice bait kid
---
All hail the magic trap
---
People do that?
---
Way too much repeating. But yeah! WGLF Stack and BBQ Stack.
---
Steve‚Äòs got the best hooked cry
---
Ja^^
---
Oni relates to this
---
just stand still for a couple of seconds after that
---
That happened to me as well. I‚Äôm just gonna play killer and hope I can finish my level soon
---
General Fairfield. You are a bold one
---
Is the DBD forum really the best way to get the Devs to see your comment?
---
The game allows you to play with friends so that's a feature, what is the point if you can't talk with them? The dact that they are not randoma I guess 
---
If the game doesn't have integrated voice chat it's not a feature lmao
---
I know how weird it sounds but the guy technically isn't wrong
---
"People are using a third party program to do something that the game didn't implement and they gain a huge competitive advantage from this"
---
You could use the same line to adress wallhack in an FPS
---
Obviously BHVR is never gonna do something to stop this, if anything they are gonna implement in-game voice chat
---
Damn okay
---
I would think the red stain would decrease/increase (don't remember which way) opacity
---
Yeah it's almost as if this video shows a really rare case of the perk, combined with another perk, let a survivor get away once because the killer didn't consider DS
---
Usually i catch a DS survivor pretty quick, unless it's at the exit gates in which case they probably earned it anyway for getting that far without me hooking them
---
This is peak perfection
---
Ah yes, the Entity Displeased build
---
Srs question, what gaming community isn‚Äôt like this?
---
Hatchets are incredibly inconsistent and I 100% believe it's just lag. Like, I can hit someone right in the middle of their torso and it explodes like a miss.
---
Can people who haven't purchased any map DLC still end up in matches in those maps? For example, with a friend who does have them?
---
lmao
---
I love you
---
Currently a Rank 1 survivor here
---
Just as many of the people in you comment i generally disagree with a lot of your ideas, and i think that a lot of your "observations" are one sided 
---
Examples
---
The rift challenges can/are absurd on both sides, people in the comments have already listed examples of this
---
Horrible matchmaking: it is true that survivor are sometimes matched against a killer with a way higher rank, but as a red rank surv i find it just as common to have a full team of rank 1-4 survivors get matched against rank 10-8 killers
---
But a lot of people (angry killer mains as you call them) have already listed everything they dislike about you statements so i will only list what genuinely agree with
---
More bp for survivors:
---
Yeah this needs to happend there is absolutely no reason why survivors arent earning more ( but please keep in mind that killer perk still needs to do more pr perk than survivor perks since its obviosly a 4v1)
---
Mori: 
---
Remove this dogshit completely along with keys and all the other overpowered single-use addons that decide games just by being equipped. Or make them borderline useless to keep animations (good example with yellow moris)
---
Tunneling (controversial)
---
I do agree with you that they have to find a way to have decisive strike in-built so you dont need to run it every game as a "backup perk"
---
(Im willing to discuss and explain this with anyone who disagrees)
---
But in addition to this they should also make ruin in built somehow whether its done with more flat gen time or whatever
---
Both of these changes would work best together
---
He isn‚Äôt dead only blind

That was a Spongebob reference...

I love how the post right before this one is someone complaining about a camping Leatherface haha.

maps are always part of free updates i believe
---
Or they just hate their team.  It‚Äôs not your fault, it‚Äôs the healer for not saving you, etc.
---
75% in Dbd community doesnt know who Danny is 
---
This demonic spawn is horryfying 
---
I would like to see this nasty son of a fucking bitch moring me 
---
Oh yes daddy
---
ok cool even like the new stranger things maps?
---
This happens to me constantly lol I think if they do not help their teammates intentionally then should be exposed for 20 seconds that will learn them ha ha
---
Nah man just rush the hook immediately and blame the killer for camping
---
Nah, you used to be able to still tank a 1HKO attack with it, and it was super easy to get it to proc
---
Or when the survivor is already around the corner.
---
They are in both ways inconsistent like "that should have hit." or  "that should not have hit."
---
Ah thank you
---
I have it, my friend doesn't. He still gets into the match when we go into that map.
---
Scratched mirror (which locks Myers into tier 1) lets Myers reveal any survivor's aura within a 32 meter radius while stalking. (Unless they're in a locker or if they have at least one distortion token) Since Hawkins is so cramped, and since Tier 1 Myers has no terror radius and immunity to aura revealing perks (such as dark sense), it pretty much means that the survivors can't see Myers, but he can see them. Only problem however, is that Myers is slower than most killers in Tier 1, and his lunge isn't that good, either.
---
Yeah with people saying that dbd has such a horrible community, I'm really curious as to what games they play which don't - my previous games I've played a lot have been TF2, rocket league and rainbow six siege which are so much worse
---
Like about 1/2 the other things right now it‚Äôs buggy. The idea is when you face him and center him on the screen it takes a few seconds to ‚Äúreveal‚Äù him.
---
When it actually works is when you‚Äôre. Or trying to do it(since it reveals your location) or it happens across the map. I‚Äôve never gotten it to work reliably when he is close or it would actually be helpful.
---
Men of Culture will think about a different Amadani. She crouches, jump and also shred you.
---
Tomorrows my turn to post this
---
Almost being the key word.
---
I support this idea !
---
You can step over the trap if you wait a second after setting it
---
Yeah. That's usually where the devs first look.
---
I thought that was a game mechanic until I stepped on my own trap in confusion
---
I mostly play Nea because I like her cosmetics (the Harajuku Graffiti Artist and the Skateboard outfit are my favourites). Can't even wear the pink or green hair I like because I often get tunneled because of all the toxic people out there.
---
Will The Oni be purchasable with Shards?
---
Great thanks
---
Myers looking fancy the Entity must be throwing one hell of a feast for Christmas.
---
It‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt just tank a hit and unhook the survivor anyways with him due to chainsaw downing everyone within range.
---
I am speed
---
Heart
---
It also eliminates that too
---
Wtf?
---
When thinking about new possible outfits, I suddenly realized Steve wears just one outfit through the whole S3.
---
No, I don‚Äôt think I will
---
Yeah, i watched that stream yesterday and he did really well with Wraith all day. It would definitely be a good place to start for anyone wanting to get better with Wraith.
---
Lol whoop. Just saw downvotes start appearing so thought id somehow upset someone lmao
---
I've been playing since April, and I've never faced a Leatherface that DIDN'T camp. I just expect it at this point.
---
Oh
---
Put some effort in.
---
They should add morphs
---
Please let me sell splinters. The game keeps giving me them even though I own every character :(
---
Reminds me of heavy rain
---
Motor memory. Psychology nerd here
---
Yep I'm not toxic just stupidly altruistic.
---
Sadly everyone is attacking you, I do get why they are attacking you, it sounds weird and counter-intuitive, but you are indeed right
---
"Players are using a program/system that lets them use a feature not implemented in the game and gaining a huge competitive advantage from it"
---
You could use the same fucking line for wallhacks, aimbotting, etc.
---
Some people responding to you are even spouting bullshit like "nah, I just goof around when I play  SWF plus comms" and I'm in fucking disbelief, can you imagine an aimbotter saying this shit?
---
"Nah, it's fair for me to use an aimbot/wallhack because I just goof around" lmao
---
I honestly don't think it's reasonable for BHVR to try and stop people from using voice chat, it would be incredibly dumb financially ( a lot of people would stop playing )
---
Though I do think they should adress how much advantage comms give
---
First step should be adding in-game voice chat and then either
---
- Give killer more bloodpoints against SWF or some other kind of reward for playing against it
---
- Balance the game around voice chat
---
As a fellow piggy: Whispers, Survelliance, Overcharge and ruin / Pop. 
---
Monitor and abuse is only useful while you are unsure about whisper distance. If whisper didstance is bigger then 32 meters then no M&amp;A needed. However the combo allows you to get there faster.
---
I really like the killer weapons for the recent blight event.
---
I'm also around 40, I think with the Tome challenges and some additional play, you can go to 70
---
How
---
I like David Kings black suit and the beach bod hillbilly with a cow leg as a weapon.
---
Biker outfit for kate
---
We're pretty bad.
---
Reminder that the one time Myers got a gun, he fucking stabbed a guy with it.
---
Surgeon of slaughter.   That spirit red robe
---
IKR. I went against trapper and god now i know why nobody hit me with DS when i use it
---
When will the Cursed Legacy chapter be released?
---
I reached tier 70 shortly after completing level 2 of Tome I.
---
I'm P3 on my favorite characters now, and thus, much more laid back than I used to be.
---
I lost it yesterday on a teammate who inexplicably unhooked me in the killer's terror radius though.  It was my first hook.  There was no reason for it.
---
Was on the tip of my tongue, ty
---
Also hook with monstrous shrine at any time. broken
---
December 3rd is the planned release date

Yea me too i never see it

Yikes, who hurt you?

Best add-ons for a Freddy who uses BBQ+C, PGTW, Surveillance, and Discordance? I've been stacking the jump ropes since I can't figure out what add-ons to use.

Who is this?

You probably could've just hit her through the window

Trapper has almost no counterplay other than: OoO, small game, slippery meat, saboteur and most toolboxes, luck offerings, maps and RNG

level 70. got like 3 more challenges
---
Your tight anus hurt my dick...shouldve used lube
---
WGLF is good for BP but thats about it. Good if you are a begginner
---
This is not Happening is pretty poor. Its benefits only come if you are injured meaning you must lose a killer after they hit you and even then it just helps with hitting great skill checks.
---
Resilience is ok. Not very good in the sense that you need to be injured but the constant 9% action bonus to everything can shave off a good few seconds off a gen - around 7.2 seconds and also allows you to vault slightly faster.
---
Spine chill is great, especially if you plan on staying injured. Also great as an anti-stealth perk for preventing killers sneaking up on you.
---
Overall the build is pretty poor as 3 out of 4 of the perks wont do much for you.
---
If you replaced WGLF with No mither then you would gain the benefits of the other 2 perks constantly while having spine chill to alert you if you are in trouble.
---
So is 2+ gen chase
---
I don't care how many matches I have played in this game there are some that my heart is still truly terrified. LOL
---
Looks sweet, but now THIS GAME is now on your arm FOREVER.

---
That's just this community.
---
Now here's the question.
---
Will Survivors be thankful for not moring them, or call you stupid piece of shit?
---
Haha I‚Äôm exactly the same way.
---
Ah that makes sense sorry, I won't forget next time ;)
---
Its an abuse of mechanics. Probably not reportable but definitely scummy.
---
This took me way longer to get than it should have
---
I want you to take a moment to reread your post...

The Demogorgon scream is replaced with a very loud pig squeak.

This is a 200IQ meme, makes sense why I didn‚Äôt understand it for the longest time.
---
I‚Äôm at 53 and I didn‚Äôt get the head start either.
---
Oh this again....
---
Dude get off your soapbox.  Facecamping is toxic trash if it's done outside of potato ranks (those players don't know any better).  It's a ridiculously stupid "strategy" designed to depip you and typically allows for multiple escaped survivors assuming they aren't potato as the killer engaging in the trash camps.  It's also uncounterable by the person on the hook who is forced to just lay there staring at you until they die.  Pathetic way to get kills please don't try to defend that garbage. It makes you look silly and tone deaf.
---
47 almost 48
---
Never mind the fact that he's been shot hundreds of times, blown up, lit on fire and thrown off a building, but *this* is what shows you his strength?
---
Thanks :)
---
I like killer, but stopped because of wait times!!!
---
also you get progress for the key depletion challenge if a teammate deletes a key they challenges are broken for good reasons
---
Myers also lifted him self slowly down with one hand in the movies.
---
Pretty sure she‚Äôs in her 20‚Äôs
---
Hot take(?): There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Nea‚Äôs face
---
No kidding. But anyone without a phobia of being injured would rather a toolbox for gens or flashlight for fun. You could say they have a... thanataphobia.
---
:0
---
I don't remember, there are still 1 and a half pages to go. Really don't know how some people already completed it, I play everyday for like, 7 hours at least
---
That's the easiest way to improve as killer in this game.    Take notice of everything they do to you in game that truly messes you up.  They'll teach you what loops you can get them at and which ones you need to avoid and break chase to pressure gens/others.  There's something to learn from every loss.
---
Yes. Exactly. Most of the loops give you a wide view on all the sides and have window drops that T1 myers can do shit about.
---
&gt;Myers also lifted him self slowly down with one hand in the movies.
---
He lifted himself slowly down?
---
He says there is no way to know if you didn't go to the gate. If there was an indicator on the HUD, you wouldn't have needed to pull back from the gate once you saw the spikes because you would have already known there would be spikes.
---
I want to reply with another question: do i care? Lmao
---
Here is a video that goes into great deal regarding the reveal mechanic
---
Video (7ish minutes where reveal mechanics are tested) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkDyYBg5oYw
---
To reveal GF at base, you need to be at most 32 Meters from him and have atleast 20% of his body in the middle of your screen. 
---
Look at him kind of in the chest with the middle of your screen. It takes 1.5 seconds of looking to break GF out of Night shroud.
---
Your character model can block the reveal mechanic meaning its best to look over your character by aiming the camera at a down angle to ensure you get full view of GF body. 
---
If you see GF constantly crouching and uncrouching behind cover, its near impossible to break them out meaning you should force them out of cover by breaking LOS as they could be peak stalking you.
---
Was that part 5?
---
It was a joke man, chill..
---
waiting for spirit and pig :D
---
Yes. With one hand.
---
Just to clarify, after the Legion nerf in 3.4.0, will you not lose STBFL stack when hitting the obsession in frenzy? If so, then Nemesis + STBFL and possibly PWYF would be absolutely dirty.
---
nope it's really a problem, had this several times
---
I have not. So thanks for sharing !
---
If you were hit from a chainsaw while healthy you'd be downed however if you were already injured that is when the perk would be in effect allowing you to take a hit from anything (literally) and avoid going into the down state as well as gaining the speed boost on hit.
---
What good are the lucky charms?
---
Some time In early December
---
this looks amazing!! I WOULD PAY MONEY TO SEE A HUNTRESS VERSION along with other killers too!
---
Yeah, I love to let flashlight users and head-on gamers get the hatch, as long as they weren't going out of they were to be rude/cocky.
---
A) I love playing that kind of style when I play survivor. Rushing gens may be "optimal", but going for saves is so much fun.
---
B) By following me around while I'm in a chase they're making the game last longer while being more interesting. Having to consider the possibility of a locker stun or flashlight save adds an extra layer to the gameplay, which is fun for me.
---
"Aaaaaannnndddd post!"

Once a looper always a looper
---
&gt;Just to clarify, after the Legion nerf in 3.4.0, will you not lose STBFL stack when hitting the obsession in frenzy?
---
Correct. Frenzy hits will no longer be considered "basic attacks" so you won't lose or gain any stacks from them.
---
tome 1 this is fun 
---
tome 2 bit more difficult but ok 
---
tome 3 &gt;‚Ç¨}&gt;?]#|\}&lt;‚Ç¨&gt;!yog soboth yogsoboth
---
It isn't a remotely tough feat to 4k with a mori.  Literally the only thing that presents a challenge in that is getting through the game without 1 or more disconnecting on you.  Otherwise there is no challenge or skill in the slightest presented in doing what you did. That's why you're getting the salty comments on here.  Bragging about 4k with a mori rubs a lot of people the wrong way.
---
Im level 21. I stopped playing dbd for about 2 mouths and im only going back now
---
Lucky for me I almost never leave pallets down ^^
---
When she's done phasing the scratch marks will remain longer so you can work out where survivors duked to would be my guess.
---
Ooo this meme again. So funny.
---
Understandable part 5 and 6 are complete shit for the most part.
---
As an Adam main, all I'll say is you don't know true pain.
---
Negative.
---
&gt;Some time In early December Should be released before the 18th
---
Official release date is December 3rd.
---
I‚Äôm confused... did I miss something?
---
I disagree just bring a med kit and this build is gold except wglf  I would change it for iron will. 99 your medkit and if you're constanly hitting greats you'll speed through gens. Once you feel you're about to go down you can use the medkit and prolong the chase
---
I mean, shouldn‚Äôt you be unhooking people anyway? was it really a waste of time?
---
I understood it instantly wtf?
---
wglf is not very good for this build since none of your other perks have to do with hook saves.
---
honestly, no perk that only gives you benefits while injured is worth it. nobody wants to be a one-shot.
---
spine chill is good against stealth killers, but otherwise it just promotes being overly stealthy. it‚Äôs great for new players since it just hands you situational awareness but after a while you‚Äôll be able to predict that type of thing.
---
so.. i personally think that you should change 2-3 perks and make sure the others go well with what‚Äôs left.
---
It is what it is...
---
Incorrect, the true use of NOED is the 4% faster attack cooldown
---
You could have fun as a killer, you just need to stop caring about the fun of the survivors when you play him... It's not a popular opinion but it's an honest one!
---
The spirit still sees scratch marks unless she uses a specific add-on.
---
Lmao they made a cybertruck hatch
---
Tunnel vision
---
That'd be nice.
---
  
---
Although, I would like a change to the physics of the hatchet, if only slightly. Also, it'd be nice if maybe half of the misses could be picked up off the ground.
---
Just some ideas to change it up a little.
---
I don't know about that. I got face camped by a plague last night and all three of my teammates were absolute Champs trying to unhook me but couldn't get it done what with her constantly puking on everyone and smacking them.
---
welp, guess ill start looking for noed on my webs...
---
I play on ps4, red ranks in both, usa north eastern region
---
Someone has been using Mother-Daughter Ring add-on for far too long... 
---
Spirit by default can see scratch marks, only blood trails become invisible.
---
For the NOED Sacrifices use Bloodwarden as well and it'll get a lot easier!
---
technically you actually saved time since you dont need to do that last game for the 25th unhook now
---

---
Ebony momento mori skeleton key
---
Thanks for telling , I didn't actually know
---
The fact that no matter what michael did he would lose is a big problem.

Clearly you do care because even if you haven't been playing the game you're still finding time to troll the sub.

I play on PC, I'm bad at survivor - rank 16. No experience as killer.

Also dead Harding over a trap.  It other than that.

Not.Soon.Enough.

Tried to return aswell, couldnt find a killer game within 30 mins, quit again. see you next year.

Congrats! Plague seems like lots of fun

Somehow that proves I care? Lmao what?

I never seen him grin! Maybe it‚Äôs subtle.

i originally thought it was going to spell ‚Äúno.‚Äù then i opened my eyeballs and realized i‚Äôm an idiot

Nothing to be done, current Quentin is what the licenseholders allowed, BHVR can't just change it

I really don‚Äòt get it after like 7 tries

I didn't know you could walk through them when they stalk. Good to know.
---
Can anyone tell me the name of this meme? Or link the format?
---
Happens to me too often. They are always like you mind game yourself but I CANT HEAR WELL AND THE GAME SOUND DOES NOTHING TO HELP.
---
One of the perks introduced by the new survivor Yui Kimura, as part of the Cursed Legacy Chapter, allows the player to 'reset' thrown pallets so they can be used again
---
I‚Äôm at level 51.

I‚Äôm playing very casually though not grinding.

White ward exists if you're really afraid of losing your items. This is how the game goes. You win some and lose some. I've lost Rainbow Maps and Skeleton Keys to this perk but I can always go back and get my item off the ground. But that's just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
wtf lol, ghostface is low mid tier at best and wraith is low tier.
---
I Hope u are right, maybe today i can reach rank 8 ü§û
---
Haven't we all?
---
But Mom said it's my turn to post it
---
I took too many days off the game so I did a bit of grinding for Tome 3. 
---
Otherwise I'm playing pretty casually. Couple hours here and there. Just concerned I won't hit the cap in 35 days
---
Oh man I thought he‚Äôd be released same time as the girl
---
Hold up, why would a killer respect your items that are giving you an advantage? This makes no sense. I play both sides and see no problem with Franklin's, just a problem with you tbh.
---
It seems you're good at  the game but these are all gen slowdown perks which also ruin survivor experience. You might not play nasty. But pop is a sweaty perk on its own. Along with ruin, most people moan about it. I run pop with demigorgon, and yeah i dont need to be nasty. since hes like a lesser freddy. Any survivor is just a pop stack. 
---
You dont need to worry about kills if your perks already slow down the game. But even if its the lesser evil, those kinds of perks are unfun for me as well as it brings nothing to the gameplay table, unlike vision or chase perks (bamboozle and im all ears for example)
---
Also, let the best person in the chase be injured. This will make him get greedy and go after him, buying you time and the gen if you make it with someone else
---
I needed to finish this ‚Äúdeplete 8 keys‚Äù challenge

 unless it's for the rights to his own face..

Woah Wha??

Anything. She hears anything during it.

I‚Äôd say mix a rope/chain and a sketch/masterpiece.
---
Hello, creator of that video here to clear up a few minor things from this post.
---
It is mostly correct, however you can only reveal him when looking at his upper body, so his legs don't count for the reveal hitbox.
---
In addition, you *technically* only need to have him in the 'reveal' state for 1.21 seconds, since as I talk about in the video, he has a 0.3 second time to go from the 'reveal' state back to the 'hidden' state. But it's basically best to just keep him in your sights until he flashes white and is revealed.
---
In the video, I show an overlay of an approximation of what the actual portion of your screen that you can reveal him looks like, so that you can get a more concrete idea of what part of your screen you can actually have him in for the purposes of revealing him.
---
That's fantastic. Now when they do this it gives me a window to save with BT without trading.
---
Can I save this to make a meme
---
I M M E R S E D
---
Why did you use SADX instead of SA1? :(
---
Loving this! I plan to do the huntress‚Äôs mask on my forearm too because she‚Äôs my favourite killer :^)
---
Absolutely! You should not have any issues with switching your challenges back and forth
---
Explain why should I dont try to kill 4 instead of 3 because I dont really understand
---
Wait, this game literally made me forget how cute Quentin actually is. Like, I saw the movie and remember it, but seeing the gremlin constantly in game had twisted how I remembered his appearance. He deserves justice!
---
Then die
---
Only non-boomers will understand :)
---
The fact that you call it a strategy proves my point.
---
Just because you don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt make it toxic. Your definition is bad and you should feel bad.
---
You‚Äôre nothing more than an entitled, crybaby trying to force your twisted definitions of things you don‚Äôt like because you can‚Äôt be bothered to have an actual argument otherwise.
---
So fuck off crybaby.
---
Couldn't figure out to do his 'do on Patrick's pointer head.
---
I am so proud of this community.
---
I am as well, friend.
---
In the meantime run Decisive EVERY game until you're close to red ranks.  Near red they usually smarten up and don't tunnel off hook but until then Devisive is your best friend and the only defense against what these killers are doing to you.  Beat of luck man.  Hope your games improve.
---
this is correct. i switch between killer and survivor challenges often, and have never once lost any progress.
---
That's the other deciding factor for me. If the names have certain similarities between them.
---
Honestly the only one I thought needed changed was Last Minute Hero
---
Hell yea camping fun loser
---
Yep ;)
---
They were more making everything more clear as to what is considered a "basic attack" and what isn't. Legion was the only Killer left in the game that could use their power and still be considered using "basic attacks."
---
While it is 100% a nerf, it was more done to keep the game's logic consistent. Weird corner case exceptions like Legion's Frenzy Attacks still being "basic attacks" are bad for new players, and can cause confusion.
---
This was me haha
---
I needed to do the hook obsession twice task for archives (which is why I tunneled the Feng) but the combination of the map being the game along with you guys not being totally braindead led me to keep changing my mind between actually trying and not trying which is why I gave up some chases really easily especially at the start
---
I was so sure I had heard a locker right after the unhook which is why I checked that one but it was empty and figured I had wasted too much time so I went to go after the scratch marks instead
---
Also you must think that it's **completely heal**, so doing from 0% to 100% will be one, and for example from 50% to 100% will be only half
---
It works super well I never realized how inaccurate I was until I saw how the mechanic actually worked
---
When I play SWF it's usually "lmao ggwp did you find it as funny as us when (insert a moment where we trolled each other)"
---
Forever? Where's the fountain of youth?
---
Good to know, I've been afraid to run when playing against spirit because I thought she could see scratch marks.
---
She can't see them even with add ons?
---
I was confident he gave up on me to get the Feng. There was no need to look behind especially cause the radius lets me know if he‚Äôs coming and his chainsaw does too. You must have barely any hours
---
Yea exactly. If survivors dont like it, then ask the devs for a change. We will do the most effective thing if we wanna pip.
---
Other solution is bring no mither lol
---
No damage isn‚Äôt that obvious? What I would suggest though, the traps are invisible and do damage however the trapper doesn‚Äôt see their aura or which trap was set off
---
Myers, Nancy, Ghostface, Spirit, Nurse, Demogorgon and Steve.
---
You son of a bitch
---
Follow your dreams!
---
But the 10 games (now 5) is passive. You just play the game. The hope one you actively have to do something, equip a specific perk and escape. That's the difference I'm seeing
---
Is the new dlc coming out tomorrow? I keep see people say it is but I haven‚Äôt any confirmation from the developers
---
Me in my scoops ahoy Steve outfit
---
Idk I always make it to my hooks and no one ever runs flip flop. You were wrong kid. I‚Äôm right
---
Too many for honor players in this community
---
PS4 player here, does anyone else have major lobby issues since the SWF lobbies were introduced? I always get errors saying ‚Äúcould not connect to host‚Äù or ‚ÄúNAT type‚Äù and then my lobby freezes while my friends get into a match without me.
---
It‚Äôs been like this for awhile now.
---
Am I the only one? Any ideas on how to fix or prevent this or is it a bug?
---
Stop needing killer crutches kid
---
So what if I was talking about his skin? It IS beautiful? Can't a man likes another man's skin? (No homo)
---
Same
---
Spirit can see scratch marks when phasing but blood is an addon
---
Nah, you should be rewarded for the amount of time put in, considering this shit storm is all time gated to begin with. 
---
The rewards were unacceptable for that effort.
---
Nancy's pink jacket, Spirit's burial kimono or her lunar New Year kimono, Nurse's medical bag, Demogorgon's chains, all those are my favorites tbh
---
&gt;Also you must think that it's completely heal, so doing from 0% to 100% will be one, and for example from 50% to 100% will be only half
---
Yes? Jumping in a locker without a single % of self-healing or healing and coming out of it healed would be 100%. Doing this 4 times in the same match would be 400%.
---
Ok boomer the joke is that Quentin and Steve look very similar @-@
---
This. Also if you are planning on completing the Tomes you shouldn‚Äôt need to buy rift tiers.
---
This is Fate. You know what to do.
---
Im Spanish this doesnt work with me muahahaha √ë
---
*shakes head*
---
Just for my side lol!  I'm a 50/50 player friend.  The survivor in me knows how cancerous that feels to have happen to you and the killer in me is just embarrassed by trash players who resort to facecamping instead of learning how to actually play the game.  This has nothing to do with bias and everything to do with us discussing a Zero Skill like none at all "strategy" that again causes you to lose games both in terms of depips AND survivor escapes.  But toss a couple more juvenile cursing insults at me.  Paint yourself full troll if it adds inches to your dick.
---
I get mori's, but why are skeleton keys op?
---
Is this a hack? She literally teleported to the EXACT position your survivor was on. I can see how it could be a hack but don't really wanna call it without evidence.
---
Did this happen multiple times in the game? Did she escape? I need to know more this is really interesting.
---
What a masterpiece
---
I saw her in the store last night dog
---
No she does see scratches. The only things the Spirit doesn‚Äôt see when phasing is the Survivors themselves and blood pools (there‚Äôs an add-on for making the blood visible). She sees everything else, birds flying away and grass moving too.
---
It goes... but sometimes not right away.
---
If 3 people are still alive in the match, then they would need 4 generators done, not just 3. So those 3 would still need to do a generator.
---
Remember when reggression was 15% on lowest level and highest is same as lowest now? I Love this perk so much 
---
But ill Tell u What stupid thing i've done 
---
I was trying to do Evil Incarnate achievment bcuz I have only 9 achievments to do after 876 hours of playing Dbd 
---
And I had 4 Chances 
---
I've said to myself 
---
I need to take as many reggression perks as possible 
---
And I've taken 
---
Ruin 
---
Corrupt Intervention 
---
Play With Your Food (obviously) 
---
And 
---
Pop Goes a Weasel'
---
I realised that when it was endgame and I havent killed anybody 
---
Fuck me XD
---
I would cry of I didn't play Plague with enduring and spirit fury
---
Yeah lesser evil. To be honest, i slap in ruin because of gens go fast thing but i dont like it as well. But i guess its fine, i'll give gen slowdown perks more thought.
---
Idk then sry dude
---
Does the classic Ghostface skin have any advantage over the other skins?? Its harder to see while picking or something?? (because it doesn't have this floating things I mean)
---
I did it relatively quickly. I just be sure that I get found right at the start (oh clumsy me) and then be up my unhookers butt ALL the time like a Ghostface/Michael knock-off.
---
BHVR: working as intended.
---
I don't think it's toxic, just lame. The only time I do it is if I know for sure where the last person is. Besides that I'm not gonna keep someone who's already lost in the game longer than they need to be.
---
Tomorrow.
---
Tbh, BHVR's response was a bullshit. 
---
It was like "Yeah, let us know if you have an idea or something" in a professional/discreet way
---
He saw you, you got hit by the red light. His mind just didnt register it

‚ÄúWhen we originally planned the Tome and Rift, we had designed it in such a way that you would earn enough fragments from Player XP to finish The Rift by the time you complete all the challenges. Since the challenges can now be completed in fewer matches, you may need to play additional matches after completing the Tome in order to reach Tier 70 in The Rift.‚Äù
---
Seems like they didn‚Äôt actually want to make changes and are lowkey punishing us for asking for them.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
All you continue to do is cry and yell about nothing. You say nothing that proves any point you might have. You still can‚Äôt argue against the fact that no one has the right to dictate how anyone else plays the game and that your opponent trying to win is not toxic.
---
You‚Äôre nothing more than a pigeon playing chess. You shit all over everything, flip the board, and then cry about how you won.
---
Still nothing more than an entitled crybaby.
---
Does anyone know if the kill your obsession challenge mean to mori them or just kill on hook
---
I would've loved Geisha in dbd but we got oni now and they're pretty similar.

Phbt.  I dont even bring items unless its for an archive challenge.   3-4 survivors with items is just bait asking for bad killers to bring Franklins.
---
If anything I'll bring plunderers or ace in the hole so that I can continue to build up my obscene collection of useless tools that bloat the size of my save file.
---
I bet when you and your buddies all bring medkits you Dc vs plague too

It's already looking really nice. Don't forget to post it here when it's done too! I love that skin so much! üíï

I swear if I see this in the future I'll uninstall the game after the match ends. No game will ever be as fun after that lol

You're obviously a garden variety troll on here.  I can't be bothered to give you things the time of day.  Best of luck finding bait elsewhere man.  Have a great day.

YES! I love that skin. One of the only ones that I bought the whole set too. Just so good! It's a shame that Wraith is quite weak otherwise I would plat as him (and with that skin) way more often.

That doesn't exist.

Try Insidious nurse sometime. I did it the other day. Blink into the exit gate before they open it with insidious and as soon as you hear they are starting to open it blink out and scare the shit out of them lmao.

Well at least one of those is true. Jonathan was kinda a perv.

Because it has one killer and one survivor, it will most likely be 7.99

*me, having gone through all the bullshit challenges before this was announced*

I bet slugging for a 4k would be immensely less popular if the killer didnt get punished so hard in emblems and achievements for not doing it.
---
When I play killer I always like to give the hatch, but when gens pop fast and someone suicides on first hook...  I mean if you guys aren't up for farming now I'm going to struggle to pip even with a 4k.

The charms you get from the rift are very useful for weird flexing how much you grind in the game. Besides that, they are like any other cosmetic, showing off your aesthetic preferences. I really wish there were a zoom fuction in the lobbies, and banners or something in the trial results screen to showcase the charms a little better to the other players in the match.
---
There are also magically delicious lucky charms but nobody has yet found them in this game.
---
Ah yes, slugging super toxic and not at all good for securing that final kill at all....
---
The DemoSquinkSquonk
---
u/Skemooo has some renderings of all 4 Legion members without their mask on.
---
Thats a good idea. My thinking was this would allow him some options that stealth killers get to take advantage of. Maybe like a purple add on that gives him undetectable while someones in a trap? Can combo with the add on that needs someone else to untrap you so so he can mix up if hes gunna go for the trapped person or make it so 1 person trapped, 1 has to come for the untrap, then use the undetectable to sneak up on a third person. Would give him good juggle potential.
---
Blendette or Wraith?
---
Nurse is not seen as much right now because the dedicated servers are rubber-banding the Nurse Blinks

Thanks! This is my first DLC release since I started playing so I wasn't sure.

Yeah sure does

Read your responses lol.  This has nothing to do with "truth".  All you did was insult me numerous times across multiple messages.  If you aren't a troll than don't behave as one because I will not do exchanges with Trolls.  Also your flair is literally Salt Mine lol.  Come on dude you know what you're doing.  If you're sincerely not a troll and simply were having a bad day and needing to take it out on someone I'll give you one more chance to engage with me in an intelligent discussion on the next thread.  Just don't whip out the juvenile troll insults because I end exchanges the moment the other party debases themselves by stooping to that level.  Again I'll give you another try on a different thread but you've had your shot with this one.  Have a good day.
---
It's not.
---
Its not taking the game hostage, having 3 gens close to each other is not holding the game hostage. You lost and had an afk, crap game but nothing wrong with anything

My dummy ass with all challenges completed except for 15 iris and 7 obsession kills:
---
OK *N I C E*
---
Yea, masterpiece goes well with a heavy gen guard build like this.
---
I love that you say the devs themselves said to not consider them to mean anything when this obviously states something far different
---
It's not that they don't mean anything, it's that there is a context in which they mean something. Freddy has a high killrate but likely because of forever freddy, that doesn't mean he doesn't have a high killrate and that nothing needs to be looked at though
---
If nurse was at 40% killrate or lower, that would be alarming, and would mean her base kit needed a small buff, if a killer has a kill rate of 60% or more, there is probably something wrong with *at least* one build for that killer assuming you want the killrates around 50%
---
Me neither. I try to be as calm and sportmanlike as possible.
---
Seriously. I can kind of understand most others, but this one was so over the top stupid I can‚Äôt imagine anyone not doing SWF or boosting getting it
---
Its not the killer's problem if the slugged guy is bored on the ground, its a game that relies on a tad bit of luck on all ends in what happens, slugging isn't toxic, I'd rather be slugged than hooked
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e52942/hmmm_was_i_the_only_one_with_bugged_devotion/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone in this sub has the right to call Jonathan a perv.
---
Now fix achievements
---
Can anyone confirm the healing "any" survivor challenge includes yourself?
---
You don‚Äôt try to bring anything to the table. You don‚Äôt try to argue or bring valid points. You just cry about how you don‚Äôt like it and how your opponent trying to win is toxic.
---
There‚Äôs no point trying to argue with you. You just plug your ears and scream about how unfun it is. You‚Äôre a pigeon playing chess, nothing more. You‚Äôre not worth anything but the insults. 
---
Only good part of that movie.
---
This isn't really a problem with challenges, this is a problem with how DC's are handled. A Survivor who DC's should effectively just go AFK, with an animation where they cower and scream (that the fucking trash DC-er has to watch before exiting the match). This should last for maybe 30 seconds before they collapse dead as they do now; this way the Killer can still get credit for the hook, but they also have to take the time to go grab and hook the person, so at least the Killer is distracted for a little bit and the other Survivors are screwed *a tiny bit* less by the DC.
---
The model that is in the game was approved by New Line, who own the rights to the character of Quentin Smith. In order for BHVR to make changes to the model, they would need to get approval from New Line.
---
Nobody is saying that Kyle Gallner doesn't have the rights to his own likeness, because of course he does. He just doesn't have the rights to the character of Quentin Smith, which is what you would need to make changes to the model of the character in the game.
---
Yea, the devs said early in development that they didnt want a paywall segregating players in the game.
---
Well I certainly can‚Äôt speak for the rest of this sub but i can guaranteee I‚Äôve never taken sneaky pictures of a woman undressing through a window. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
The current pipping system is better. The game currently encourages triple hooks from killers and this would just encourage face camp and tunnel. Also as a survivor I would be pretty butt hurt if I did 3 gens, 5 unhooks and had 2 minute chases only to depip because the killer brought noed.
---
Two things:
---
1. You have a hook timer.  When did people start expecting instantaneous saves?
---
2. Lockers block aura reading, which is important strategically.
---
I‚Äôve been using Prove Thyself with Dwight, you should get 100% bloodpoints for coop actions if you have it leveled up all the way. And WGLF. and any offerings that help objectives. Or really any offerings that are for survival, altruism, but with the objectives offerings it‚Äôs helped with Prove Thyself.

&gt; fet¬∑ish a form of sexual desire in which gratification is linked to an abnormal degree to a particular object, item of clothing, part of the body‚Ä†, etc.

&gt;"Victorian men developed fetishes focusing on feet, shoes, and boots"

‚Ä†Specifically, parts of the body not typically associated with sex, such as feet or hands. Sexual gratification, even to an 'abnormal degree', is not a fetish when it concerns sexual organs, i.e. breasts and penises.

Being attracted to 'third sexes' or transgender women or any title or name for a person with mixed-gender qualities **is categorically not a fetish.**

Regardless of your thoughts on how "weird" it may or may not be, which you are entitled to, it's just simply **not a fetish.**

I play for about 4 hours or 5 hours a night and I get it at least 10 times. Sometimes in a row. What makes it really annoying is when we finally get a match and we get dodged and then it happens again waiting for the next one lol

That is more of an issue of reddit not being very funny but I feel you. Me too.

Lol did not disappoint.  I know being called out on trolling triggers you guys as the goal is to keep the thread going and get them increasingly more and more pisses off.  I'm afraid I recognize that bait everytime.  Scratch that next thread discussion offer. You doubled down on the troll stuff.  We're done on this sub together.  Best of luck with your future trolls.  May they be less aware than me.  I know people like me ruin these for you.  Have a good life mate.
---
I am fine with that but they shud add an auto dc for players who stay inactive for longer than an appropriate amount of time.
---
Yes DBD survival is abt strength in numbers but here that teammate is sabotaging your chances.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought for some of these challenges as well before the changes. Safely unhook 25 survivors only for 3 shards and 25k Bp? I can get 25-30k BP in one match from a daily.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
What? That's some serious misinformation bud. She can't hear survivors at all, because they've all DC'd.
---
Ah fuck
---
Tbh I like going on reddit and reading the concepts and giving them an "ideal balancing" in my opinion. I play both sides but I also don't claim to know everything.
---
Both nurse and freddy got pretty big reworks, other than that though nothing really. The dedicated servers connection changes some minor things, such as how trapper can no longer imeaditally walk over just set traps, but stuff like that is player specific.
---
Oh shit, but in chase this would not work
---
truth. 
---
the only counter to face camping is doing gens. sucks for the person who is hooked, but if they hang in there they can buy a good amount of time for the remaining survivors.
---
[I really thought I was right...](https://youtu.be/0LZKLE8g0bw)
---
one new map, that's about it. Some minor killer tweaks. You rarely see demogorogon anyway.
---
I had no sound was watching at work. The fact I got anxious from you not looking behind you surely let's you know I'm not a new player?

Imagine taking something humerous and making it an attack on yourself.

When I was a new killer I'd even check their friends lists see if they're all on it üòÇüòÇ
---
Are the changes live now?
---
i would have, but i was the last survivor, on my second hook and im pretty sure when i checked their perks they had noed, so i wasnt gonna risk it
---
It's a minor difference. Insignificant from a stealth perspective. however currently the killer POV is flawed because you sometimes have that flabbering "arm" cape in your sight.
---
the spinning was a kind of victory dance/ me waiting for her to come over, and i actually misclicked the point button by accident
---
Not between consoles yet, but cross play is enabled between Steam/Windows

You can switch back and forward as you attempt them without any penalty.
---
Unfortunately the planning and prep to succeed can be pretty difficult to guess sometimes.
---
This looks awesome! The stickers are going to be so cool!
---
Well thats acceptable. I can't imagine the disadvantages people face when using controller on PC. Being able to whip your camera around and also make very slight movements is pretty important in this game.
---
P.S: jesus christ, so many downvotes for such a simple question with no malicious intent
---
Mods pin plz
---
Just made them overall far less grindy, which is beyond appreciated. I thought they'd only change some of the more bullshit challenges like Last Minute Hero.
---
Whoa, that's freaking amazing!
---
You continue bringing nothing. No point, no argument, nothing but crying and bitching about your opponent trying to win a versus game.
---
Still nothing more than an entitled crybaby. So fuck off crybaby.
---
With perks like noed and play with your food the speed itself wouldn't be that bad imo. It just shouldn't combo with mettle of man and have a shorter timer overall. Interesting concept.
---
[hehe](https://youtu.be/gPOLT1NThvM)

I stopped reading after I saw it's name was Tony. Now I'm just picturing Tony the Tiger beating survivors to death with Kellogs Frosted Flakes screaming "They're Great!" His mori is just waterboarding survivors with cereal.

I laughed really hard. But hey. At least he finally won a fight in season 3.

Can she hear the macro'd DC button?

Day before I figured we would get them, I'll give them that.

Ah my bad buddy. Please, take my toolbox as an apology gift.

I usually quick and quiet into the locker, but it seems to be better to just walk into it and quick and quiet out when you need to

Holy fuck, this is amazing!

i‚Äôve been thinking about getting the doctor‚Äôs weapon underneath one of my clavicles for some time now, but idk if i‚Äôll actually go through with it

Nope, I don‚Äôt think it does. Didn‚Äôt count when I healed myself for that challenge :(
---
You clearly wanted to reply to /u/Blake_411's comment, not mine ;-)

I would take the blowjob :)

I should play more often with Franklins, I don't care about your DC, but it's salty and nooby
---
Oh fuck that's never happened to me before
---
You could replace bitter murmur with rancor. You could also try PWYF.
---
Yep!
---
You can only get bitched at so many times about these things before you snap.

SNAP I TELL YOU.

Oh okay, so you just throw the game to kill a guy. Kewl.

Don't apologize.  This is art

There's no way you'll need to play additional matches after completing the tome to reach tier 70 unless you're "cheating" to complete the tome.  By cheating I mean using SWF and/or working with the other team to ensure you get all of the master challenges on the first try.
---
they've learned to hunt
---
Eh I mean I understand that just gets frustrating.  Lol
---
Yes, they said on the forums that it's because the level 3 challenge creates a bottleneck for the rest of the survivor challenges where the level 2 one is further along
---
So basically survivors will chose the map always
---
Well since you asked no nicely
---
I understand that. It's just frustrating as the killer lol
---
Most people dc when the other side doesnt play how they want.
---
That's called being a bitch, and it deserves to be punished.
---

Down them and kill them.  Slug the first of you have to

I wish I didn‚Äôt turn my brightness up...
---
This happens to me too. Also I'm not an idiot who didn't check if the killer had Franklin's SMH. They never do.
---
I had a guy complain that I killed him
---
amazing i want this framed
---
I‚Äôve known for the last year and a half that my first tattoo would be horror related, about 2-3 of those months I knew it would be DBD related. Originally it was his hallowed blight weapon, with it dripping in wax from the wax warlord DLC. It changed to his face the day of my appt and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!
---
Playing against a killer/on a map u dont like isnt a valid reason to dc.
---
Hmmm do I want to reinstall DBD and make survivors rage or not...
---
If you are in a situation where you have to d/c, I don't see how getting penalized by being unable to queue for a few extra minutes will matter since you are likely responding to an emergency.
---
They should change level 2 also. Dropping 15 pallets is a little demanding
---
None, this was either insane lag or more likely a lag switch, which means the host(killer) can preform multiple actions before the survivors get proper connection again
---
Just to make sure I understand this, this was pre-game, right?
---
i want the first one right now pls
---
Noice
---
Ignore the fact I poorly stitched together two photos.
---
Please don‚Äôt be that jerk that just stalks people with the trap on to kill them when they‚Äôre trying to get the trap off (especially when they just got off the hook). It may be an easy kill for you but it‚Äôs just poor gamesmanship.
---
the first time i played killer the survivors helped me and were nice
---
I can already tell this is gonna be spammed for the next week on every game related sub and I already hate it.
---
its toxic to play the game. literally anything you do someone will think is toxic
---
You mean golem?
---
**im fast as fuck boi**
---
Amen brother, amen. Or sister, idk.

I like to run pop, ruin and the one from the doctor that i cant remember and just go around kicking gens
---
Wanted to do it and then I realized I'm not good at art.

I think it needs to be punished. I am tired of bads going down and instantly D/Cing because they went down.

Yeah, I thought about that, but I think the killer vote should be more relevant then survivors
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA üò≠ü§£üò≠ü§£ü§£

But then the killers vote would either have to completely negate all survivor votes else the map chosed would always be survivor sided

Ah, not sure the outcome makes sense, but their reasoning does.  Thanks!

I‚Äôm close I just started on the 8th page

Okay?

These are so sick! Where did you get the wood for them?

I just found out about this last night. Hope to be able to do it soon!
---
Just curious as to what it originally said, nothing's that much better than money when it comes to power
---
Because they likely don't have a legit reason and are the type of person who quits as soon as they go down the first time.
---
Last delusional survivor message I got was a bunch of survivors who had low ping determined I was lag switching. It was fun. Survivors telling you they are gonna report you for nothing is wonderful cause like do it. I ain't gonna get banned.
---
Sidney: We live as we dream ‚Äì alone...
---
You have to take in to account what dc'ing does to the people left in the game. I was playing a game last night where someone got downed quickly and dc'ed right away. That puts the rest of the team at a disadvantage for the whole match. Any offerings burned, or items brought are likely less effective or wasted.
---
If you're being held hostage or there is a game breaking glitch or something, that's fine, but you don't run in to those situations enough where you'd be routinely dc'ing from matches.
---
If someone has crappy internet and it's causing them to drop out repeatedly, then yes, they should be penalized. The dc's still affect the rest of the players in the game. It sucks for the person who has bad internet, but it's better for the health of the game, and the majority of players.
---
Daddy Ace
---
Haha, I get it!  Because it's the sex number!
---
Leaving pallets up isn't always the wrong decision. Lery's and Hawkins have a lot of unsafe pallets that are better left sitting there to bait the survivors into an easy hit. Of course, this perk does nothing in chase, so it will probably not even be at the level of Inner Strength, but it's definitely not terrible.
---
swf
---
Excuse me.
---
Amanda adds the *style*
---
I would‚Äôve camped him too and kept hitting him on the hook until he died
---
Basically wait until you see the pick up prompt then you're good to go.
---
It sucks but it is how it is.
---
&gt; And they end up face camping
---
...because they saw you
---
Where can meet?
---
Recently (past month) he's been given Undetectable status while cloaked, which means Borrowed Time basically doesn't exist against him. Makes him pretty powerful if he decides that he just wants to stay around the hook for a bit.
---
If you're being camped and now with the knowledge that the killer is near you, your teammates *should* be doing gens,  and you should hold on that hook for as long as you can to give them enough time.
---
Going for a 4k is never toxic. That's playing the game. Do you not understand what toxic means?
---
We also have a lot of boosted spirits. Mostly those actually.
---
Yeah! Fuck people who want to play with their friends!
---
This. I like this
---
I would‚Äôve left the guy alone if he didn‚Äôt say anything, I‚Äôm not the kinda person to tunnel or camp because I know how frustrating it is too
---
It would be easier to just remove SWF than to make it unplayable.

Dont let it stop you

Every damn meme every single day is just people making fun of ‚Äúez gg baby killer‚Äù NOBODY ACTUALLY SAYS THAT it‚Äôs so annoying
---
It's been changed fairly recently. Lower ranks have a much longer queue time.
---
"Friends".
---
Well it hasn't been done in a while. Not technically a repost but this format was used to death a while back.
---
pause the timer if the killer is within a certain range and not in a chase. disable this effect for the egc.
---
You could still play against them if you are a masochist but it wouldn't make it unplayable.
---
If your shitty internet ruins a lot of games then you are the issue and have to deal with it. This is such a dumb argument I'm not even sure how you can come up with it.
---
Yeah, I don't play Wraith but I agree, in general is not wise to base a build on such addons since it's not what you usually have. But if you have access to them there is no problem. Have fun anyway bruh
---
But that is the problem dude, I think there should be some sort of system to make is fair, because if you have tree hooks and get this away from you by being camped I dont find this enjoyable and neither the survivors on the gens
---
They longer the killer is close to the hook a stackable speed buff to repairs increases
---
Ugh, Bloodwarden requires me to dump points into Freddy who I do not enjoy playing. But since they didn't nerf this challenge I guess I may have to.
---
She‚Äôs not injured
---
Same, I already grinded for the 25 unhooks so kind of disappointed they changed that.
---
Why would a Spirit care??
---
For all the salt of it being a repost, it's the first time I've seen this and its a good meme. Shame about the karma whore.
---
Long ago, the four Dwights lived together in harmony.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't start being toxic because someone threatened to be toxic. Just doesn't lead anywhere, confirms their accusations and makes everyone miserable. Same goes for people who are already toxic.
---
Swf isn't even that really there when they showed the stats I think it was around on 30% was swf at red ranks so 3/10 games of friends which isn't as bad as people make them out to be.
---
How the f do you counter Freddy at all. Seems to have a billion positives going for him and no negative
---
That's a cheap way to get upvotes, does karma make you feel better about yourself? just wondering
---
It would be unplayable for SWFs. We would go back to the old dodge till you find your friends from release.
---
It gets funnier and funnier every time
---
You can't put people's usernames when you post this shit.
---
Both aren‚Äôt fun to play against and require certain actions to happen in order to get any use.  They also usually will take away pipping when used against and even sometimes, when used.  They‚Äôre pretty equal as far as ‚Äúfairness‚Äù is concerned, and it‚Äôs clear that you only play one side if you think there is a large discrepancy between the two in that regard.
---
Yep
---
They could have given him a little mercy. He is 17 years old in the movies... and in game is granny looking.
---
There is always 5 totems that spawn.
---
Other than that he is now completely immune to Object of Obsession since he is Undetectable
---
We get it, survivors are stupid.
---
I don't care if it's unplayable for SWFs.
---
Be careful he has xbox's number lol
---
Perks have counters. think of it like Hex Ruin except way less important and reliant on killer choice to counter.
---
I was up for the challenge but I won‚Äôt complain. I have other stuff I need to get done. Like pay bills and survive and all that stupid, non-dbd stuff.
---
I thought about some nerf with the unhooking animation, the killer can still grab you but if he lunges you won't stop the unhook
---
Figured as much.
---
That‚Äôs because this sub is 90% killer mains complaining about problems that don‚Äôt exist
---
For a character called Kyle Gallner sure but they can‚Äôt just change the approved face of the character Quentin Smith without New Line‚Äôs approval
---
I do agree with you but I dunno even if I know its swf group I'll still play, I mean that's how you get better
---
Chasing a 109% survivor during any part of the game as a 110% killer isn‚Äôt that bad?
---
Until you get the 3 man groups who do nothing but flashlight bro and body block the whole fucking game. I know stats showed 4 man groups but did it show 3 mans?
---
Why cannot they make new cosmetic/outfit for him with the new head.
---
Playing the game nerd
---
This was already tried and was abused apparently
---
Thanks. That‚Äôs very kind. :))
---
Can't take a toxic Nea seriously that uses urban evasion..
---
Life-giver says any survivor you count as any survivor
---
Getting better by getting stomped? That's now how things work. Especially if the swf is toxic cucks who do nothing but body block and flashlight all game.
---
Anyone who willingly plays against swf is a masochist who needs a mental health check.
---
Right here, right now.
---
I don‚Äôt like something so it should be removed
---
I think they should do nothing tbh
---
This is how Legion should have been.
---
Sure they can make his new model but i bought the dlc with the intention of using quentin the way he is
---
Id find it respectable if they didn't take away his current model from players who did so lol
---
I'm all for a rework but just let me keep my crackhead baby?
---
wait i‚Äôm a toxic nea fr?
---
Awwww, so cute! &lt;3
---
I hadn't seen Quentin's actual face but how did they fuck it up that badly holy shit
---
As long as Nurse can ignore literally every defense survivors have she'll always be the best killer. People that say otherwise are the people that play omega blink or three blink nurse and never bothered to actually learn her. Yes she is worse than what she was, but she is still the best killer in the game.
---
As long as you keep yourself awake, his powers are greatly reduced in strength
---
Will people stop asking for outfits that don't even buy? All i see is Nancy with her basic outfit
---
Yeah your post doesn't follow the guidelines next time black out name. They'll hit for "shaming others"
---
we were trying to get him to join our pizza cult
---
I never said it should be removed. I said it needs to be a CHOICE. You choose to play as SWF, the killer should get the choice to not play against SWF.
---
Vibe Check.
---
But then they wouldn't be OP...
---
Eh.  What do I know?
---
Any tips for getting better at looping killers as a survivor?
---
Dwight looking extra thicc
---
Only Survivors are allowed to be toxic\*
---
I've played for almost 1k hours I don't give a damn if I pip or not because it doesn't matter. I just want to have fun. Lol
---
She seems so happy!
---
""Unzips pants"
---
Agreed
---
ebonies are fine if the survivors are obviously gonna be toxic.
---
keys are fine only if the killer closes the hatch.
---
you can‚Äôt stop anyone from using them, though.. so we gotta live with it.
---
The real winner is the killer wondering if he should chase you or not
---
lol enjoy wasting your time and waiting for more matches?
---
Right... but you‚Äôll guaranteed get one in chaser if you just fuck around and farm some hits.
---
I‚Äôve also had an iri gatekeeper after giving both remaining survs the door, just because it took long enough to get to doing the tens.
---
So basically the killer will choose the map always unless the survivors coordinate their votes?
---
Nick gurr
---
Future Future Buff for Pop: Kicking a generator sends the generator flying outside of the map. Survivors are unable to do this generator, and it's progress resets back to 0
---
I got the dlc for Freddy... not for the rework... and what did I got?
---
If that why I am seeing more idiots that don't know how to use a flashlight recently?
---
Gotta love the "you only play one side" argument lmao. There is a large discrepancy, I've had a lot more matches where keys failed or at best got 1 person out than I did where an ebony didn't just insta-win a match.
---
You already made your assumptions of me, so no point arguing further before you start calling me the typical "toxic survivor main" buzzwords.
---
Alright, I didn‚Äôt know how to black out the name cause I recently got a new phone and still don‚Äôt know how to do edits in stuff
---
This is so amazing holy shit
---
I think if somebody disconnects nobody else is penalized for disconnecting.
---
There is zero point in playing a 3v1 with 5 gens up.
---
legion rework seems promising
---
While that is true, you‚Äôd be amazed at how often a Billy would just wallop your if they figured they couldn‚Äôt chainsaw you fast enough
---
Kick them
---
Niceeee
---
Nothing is mandatory but they are going to be the best perks if you just want to win every game.
---
So mori's are cheating survivors out of BP? If I see keys, I just bring Franklin's or focus on whoever has the key.
---
F to disagree. moris are... slightly stronger. yes. but keys only counterplay is currently franklins, and winning so hard that they simply don't have the opportunity to come into play. same dealio with moris.
---
Its probably gonna be the same price as any of the non licensed 2 pack characters.
---
/u/sexcake32
---
Salty messages of any kind are going to be removed in any case (#8), because there's too much of it.
---
Don't think so as over here a new chapter is $7.99 U.S.
---
I used aftercare. Was pretty easy.
---
Free with shards
---
So, where do I give you my money?
---
I guess
---
Watch out. His dad is bill gates
---
*Huntress wants to know your location*
---
I would love to know where I said red ranks where hard. If you have that many hours you don't have much game sense.
---
I got it legit but it took like 20 games of trying for it
---
Yeah, maybe not spirits
---
I am only toxic when I need to be, which is against people that tbag after they stun me with a pallet before I down them
---
Should of his in locker to counter bbq
---
&gt;giv him a gun
---
This would be broken
---
Idk, it's a licenced charachter so it's harder to negotiate terms to get new cosmetics. But I agree, a Dart cosmetic would help.
---
Just give you more BP for hanging out but I guess that could be abused too
---
Wtf are you saying? If you don't want to get DSed, don't tunnel.
---
If you didn't want to activate a survivor's MoM you just can't hit them 4 times.
---
yeah. but what is this from? I don't recognize it. \*inb4 it's something on the level of endgame and i've just been living under a rock\*
---
Well. To answer you question. Yes, it makes me feel better, but that‚Äôs because my Meme made some people laugh. And it just happens that someone did a DBD Meme like that before me, which I did not know about.
---
God tier killer
---
There was 2 of you and only 1 gen needed to be done. Ya both deserved the hook.
---
Thank you. I'll be sure to put it to good use!
---
That would be removing it, also you said ‚ÄúI do not care if it makes SWF unplayable‚Äù
---
Maybe it would trigger if the hooked person is 20-30 seconds when they are close to the killer?
---
Imagine claiming you‚Äôre not a new player but acting like sound doesn‚Äôt play a huge part in playing this game
---
Sorry my grammar was kinda bad in this meme, I‚Äôm kinda sick right now üòÖ
---
\*festive yeehaw chainsaw noises\*
---
Can you see yourself in that...SCRATCHED MIRROR !
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think keys are OP they are just boring same with moris tbh. Well moris aren‚Äôt as boring because every mori animation is fun to watch
---
If you really want to make these people mad, just say gg and don't respond to anything they say after that. You won't see it, but they will be mad for days after that.
---
You're posting videos of you bullying baby killers and your user flair says you're a Nea main. So yeah.
---
You gotta get good at following them with your camera and always knowing where they are.
---
 this made me grit my teeth so hard lol! good sneaks :) also love to see a fellow biker kate main! &lt;33
---
Maybe
---
Kill the key user, high chance they have a weaved ring. Close the hatch to stop multiple survivors from jumping in. Franklins like you mentioned. Don't forget slugged survivors can't use items or that Doctor also has built in key counters himself. I also mentioned a cut coin offering to drastically reduce the chance of finding one in game.
---
It does have a decent amount of counters, not to mention the prerequisites needed to even get multiple survivors out stacked on top of that.
---
They are not on par with Mori's, which while on that topic. While I think Mori's should get reworked, they shouldn't be made useless like so many people suggest in my opinion either.
---
Technically a good amount under half way since them being hooked slows the timer but yeah
---
I had left over from building an entertainment center, it's 1/4 birch ply wood. I think it's like 5$ for a 12x24 inch piece, maybe less.
---
Can confirm this doesn‚Äôt work like you think it does
---
Time to use pop on the same gen every time for the memes
---
Ps4 here. Such a missed opportunity
---
Plywood, handsaw, acrylic paint, and acrylic sealer.
---
The real 400iq play is getting all but one perk on your killers before the release of Oni so you can get his perks the second they're available on your bloodweb
---
Didn't know the coldwind farm was on the death star
---
Good wolwerine
---
but the clown wasn‚Äôt a baby killer :(. was joking my dude!
---
it‚Äôsa me, otzadarva
---
dude, this is already fucking amazing. can't wait to see updates! :)
---
Old freddy
---
Lol! Ah, a page out of the old xbox live days, where everyone's dad was Bill Gates. I had no idea he had such a big family.
---
They should just leave things the way they are
---
Thank you for the advice, unfortunately, I play solo, but will keep this in mind.
---
Why would you *want* to DC? How many times have you willingly disconnected?
---
It's from Joker.
---
Looks like they went to that trendy new underground club
---
Oh I think you'll do a little more then eat them
---
My dumbass was waiting for the video to load
---
Its true. Its really funny when they are clearly steamed and then respond with "No, not gg! You're not even good!" Followed by numerous laughing/smiling emojis to try and mask that theyre mad to the point of tears.
---
And that is the reason why   michael is not viable in red ranks
---
Did I say that killers gaining progression takes anything away from survivors? No. I‚Äôm saying that if there‚Äôs any extra progression to be gained from a D/C, survivors should ALSO have a piece of that. This isn‚Äôt just about the killers.
---
The adepts that dont count a 4k game with 9 hooks as merciless? Yes. It needs fixed
---
Billy. It's not like there arent killers who can insta-down out of hooking.
---
At the VERY least, just take him out of the poer, but not consume all of the meter.
---
The darker the map the harder it is for killers to see ,like on the new springwood maps I can't see shit pass 10 feet
---
You guys are looking fabulous. Nice group selfie.
---
They used to be worse.
---
Like, purely medicinal man
---
Haha same. I'm petty sometimes, and I dont give a damn about rank as it is.
---
Survivors didn‚Äôt have low ping. You just have shitty internet and should never play killer
---
Easier said than done.
---
The all D build. Deliverance, Decisive, Dead Hard, and Detectives Hunch. They have good synergy and are pretty fun to use, plus you can mix and match for other D perks as well.
---
Because you physically can't anymore...
---
Dunno, maybe
---
First of all, a lot of practice. Also, watch a lot of content to get a general idea on how to move, whether its youtube or twitch. Also PainReliever, OhTofu, NotOtzdarva and others have plenty of guides for beginners. Also try to play some killer to have an understanding of the other point of view. On this sub, in the community info tab there's a section for new players, in there you can find a post where there is a rundown on how to loop tiles for both killer and survivor. Hope this helps, have a good one bruh
---
I wish they have made his masked head when he went down to the upside tunnels instead of just glasses
---
Thank you we all just wanted to hangout and have a good time (:
---
The "Iridescent age" challenge was annoying when it was glitched and I pained my way through like 20 games
---
Guess that means legion is one of the most powerful killers since getting high bp on them is extremely easy.
---
The biggest change in recent months was the new End Game Collapse (EGC), but that was probably before you stopped playing. The only other recent big change is the elimination of insta-heals: The red insta-heal has been nerfed into the ground (heals one health state passively over 16 seconds), the purple insta-heal has been reworked into a sort of poor man's Borrowed Time effect. However, along side this all med kits have been made faster‚Äîthe Emergency Med Kit, in particular, is fast AF, though certainly far from instant.
---
Everything else has basically been tweaks to specific areas:
---
* Dying Light is now compatible with Michael's other obsession perks, instead of encouraging tunneling.
---
* Nurse's add-ons have been reworked to eliminate 5 blink Nurse, and her power recharge was tweaked slightly, so she's not *quite* as OP as she used to be. 
---
* New Survivor status effect, Oblivious, that prevents you from hearing Terror Radius, but this doesn't come up much (it's currently only used by the Demogorgon's portals, and tomorrow the Oni will bring in one Killer perk that can trigger it).
---
* New Killer status effect, Undetectable, that prevents the Killer's aura from being seen when in stealth mode. Currently used only by stealth Killers, but it's being added to a bunch of perks with the new chapter tomorrow (e.g., Insidious, because camping totally needed a buff). I believe this was added as a much-needed nerf to the obscenely OP Object of Obsession, but doesn't help most Killers against it, and as a side effect also nerfs a bunch of other perks that were only mediocre to begin with (Dark Sense, Alert, etc.). Nice job, BHVR.
---
* New Killers &amp; Survivors brought in some new perks, of course, but nothing meta or especially noteworthy.
---
New chapter tomorrow brings a number of changes with it. People have been talking about those a lot in this sub, but in case you missed it, here's a very brief summary:
---
* New Killer, the Oni, is a strange cross between Michael Myers, Leatherface, and Hillbilly. Perks are kinda lame, nothing noteworthy.
---
* New Survivor, a Japanese woman named Yui, brings the usual random useless and/or extremely situational perks. Not much noteworthy, but as a Killer watch out for Breakout, a bodyblocking perk which may be a new favorite of toxic SWF teams.
---
* Huge Kindred buff, now active for the person with the perk when *anyone* is hooked. This is so good I'm thinking about replacing Bond with it in my build. It's obviously a bit more situational, but the unlimited range and ability to see the Killer any time they're near a hooked Survivor is pretty amazing.
---
* No One Left Behind speed bonuses buffed and now shows you all Survivors during EGC.
---
* Very minor Spirit nerfs, because now that they nerfed Nurse everyone bitches about Spirit instead. Trivial changes mostly, but they did hit the one change she really needed: Prayer Beads are no more. Or rather, instead of completely eliminating her phasing sound, they make it audible across the map. So you know she's phasing, just not whether she's phasing near you or not.
---
* Nerfs for Legion no one asked for, including some minor add-on reworks. Why would you do this, BHVR?
---
It‚Äôs a real good strategy for killing people who just wait by the gates
---
Yeah Ms. Pig told us about a new club called Le Game and said we had to go
---
Then everything changed when the locker nation attacked
---
I wouldn't want auto collect. Then I couldn't save up more than 1 million BP. I have an extra 90k saved in ritual rewards now for the new chapter tomorrow.
---
Try hooking everyone twice and then on your way to hook each survivor the last time they DC. Ive had a bunch of games go that way and I cant understand why when they are just losing their bp and costing me a small amount in comparison.
---
Can confirm that it does, nothing pisses people off more than the person that made you angry not caring about your problems.
---
It's psychological mind fuckery.
---
Except with you do it with your *dick*
---
FUCKING BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Only the Killer, master of all four Dwights, could stop them, but when the server needed him most, he disconnected .
---
Replace  utter murmur with haunted grounds or make your choice
---
I never give up no matter how hard they are whipping me. Most of the time they still win but a few times I have changed the momentum of the match by downing a couple at a time due to good/lucky plays from myself or poor/cocky play from the other team that cost them. Those games feel good.
---
Was blinded in a middle of a pallet break with Tombstone add on
---
I just walked up blindly and hit the kill button, the screen came back and I was six inches inside of a meg lmao
---
I see more Brutal Strength usage in my future.
---
I LOVE THESE üòç
---
Aw he‚Äôs actually really cute
---
Yeah you can. You could use insta down perks, insta down killers, other killers that didnt care about MoM (Myers, Plague, Huntress, sort of Trapper). Obviously situational but you could grab. Or you can proxy the hook, force struggle.
---
DS has a 60 second timer. When I run DS i literally feel invincible after getting unhooked and dont even take the time to heal. I do gens in front of the killers face and if they go for me they are forced to leave me on the ground. So many time Im playing killer and I hook someone, run across the map and initiate chase and eventually hook someone else. Look around on BBQ, find a someone just randomly walking around, down them and pick them up and get DSed. Guess I shouldnt have tunneled though.
---
Only 1-2 people realistically would have gotten MoM off a match. Everyone running DS has the invincibility effect after everytime they are unhooked. New DS is miles better.
---
She knows the best spots! Hope it was worth it
---
I just ignore them usually or send a few heart emojis, there isnt any point trying to debate some rando
---
Which doesn‚Äôt exist anymore
---
What you could do is run noed, deerstalker , save the best for last (preferably on a killer who can use his power to not lose stacks ), and dark sense. From there try to 2 hook everyone and hope they get saved so they can be a insta death on the third hook. Once the exit gates are powered open them manually by hitting the exit gate and preferably if you're Billy dark sense should show you where everyone is with noed and save the best for last at full stacks of you catch a group of survivors together down 1 and go after the other since you have deerstalker you should be good.
---
It's worth noting salt pouches are almost completely useless, unless you happen to go against Trapper. They only effect escaping Bear Traps and unhooking yourself‚Äîwhich you should almost never try to do, because even with salt pouches the chance of success is negligible. If you're in a SWF and can run 4 salty lips and a few Up The Antes, *maybe*‚Äîbut what I've heard from people who've tried this is that you still won't get a kobe in every match, so it's kinda too unreliable to focus so much of your build around.

Ok, thanks for this info. I just could make an assumption that you 100% was that demo.

Or you should be able to buy each character separately for 9000 shards.

The answer is yes cause I said so

When I‚Äôm telling you... I did make it. :(

Lol. Get in line. People have been wanting new game modes for years.

Plz, anyone know if and where I can find more like this? Dope af!

Do you leave scratchmarks while walking injured?
---
Makes any fast animation (Vault/Locker in or out) completely silent. Can throw off a killer in chase too as they may expect to hear the fast vault but then they don't.
---
The Jeff squad
---
They're both wrong. The original poster was not entitled but if you could just toggle that then SWF would almost never see a game, thus cutting down the player base.
---
I like the demogorgon a lot but I just find clown more fun honestly
---
*removed for witch hunting*
---
Thats not even a horrible hit, and his base speed is the same.
---
I just ran Demo with MYC and Territorial. Portal at the top of the stairs. Got 9 basement hooks in one game.
---
"You are a bold one!"
---
Oh okay, I thought by auto collect you meant it just rewarded the BP automatically when you finished the ritual.
---
I actually just got it. Luckily I got 2 survivors who knew what I was trying to do and let me kill them.
---
Can't say I expected it but I'll take it.
---
I enjoyed the editing, thank you for putting a smile on my face
---
Its alright dude, no problem!
---
You never leave marks while walking.
---
Yes, I would like to know this as well as I have read a few post referencing additional cosmetics if bought via one method vs. another.
---

---
I did the ‚Äúescape through an exit gate with hope equiped‚Äù by using a hatch that my teammate opened with a key. Possible oversight.
---
I have people who still harass me every time they see me in game regardless of the side they are playing so no not replying doesn‚Äôt solve anything
---
Or use distortion, the best perk in the game
---
Nope, I have no idea what kind of survivor you are.  I don‚Äôt actually think many players are toxic in this game, just the jerks tend to leave a lasting impression. 
---
I do think you‚Äôre being disingenuous with how strong/obnoxious keys are though.
---
Gen rushing is a thing. Facecamping is a thing. Body blocking is a thing. Tunneling is a thing.
---
They are all ‚Äúlegal‚Äù and considered within gameplay rules. 
---
Are they unfun? Sure. Are there counters to them? Yes.
---
AFAIK DLC costs ¬£5.99-6.99.
---
If you buy the dlc on steam you will get a retextured shirt for yui and you will get both characters cheaper
---

---
Regarding the actual order and not what you're using, if you switch spine chill and your second perk with each other than in game spine show will be closer to the middle of the screen. Meaning it will be on the left side of the perks in the HUD making it a little easier to see when you're working on a generator.
---
I'd probably drop Ruin or Corrupt Intervention. Surge might be a good one for when you down with M1, causing the ones around to blow.
---
Mori's are cheating the survivor out of both BP and being able to play the game. Arguably Mori's are much more OP than keys since there is no counter other than just dying on first hook or DCing, since you don't know a mori is in play until the first player gets moried.
---
* No calls to action against another player.

Yep, same with tons of baby trappers who just want to farm to get their challenges done.

P l e a s e
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if SWF is unplayable‚Äù that is entitlement
---
Thx
---
I agree with this. I just think the word gen rushing is a bit silly because it's survivors doing their only objective. If the gens aren't going fast, it's survivors doing nothing or killer doing a phenomenal job.
---
Besides watching videos or reading about it, a big part of it is just play ballsy and try to stay relaxed and analytical when chased. The more often you get in chases the more often you can practice and the less scary it gets.
---
People over/under-value things.
---
Both GF and Wraith create mind games that aren't available to other killers. This is one thing that should NOT be under-valued, and something that probably isn't obvious to players who don't practice them at Red Ranks.
---
That is not the entitled part that part is just his opinion when he says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if SWF is unplayable‚Äù that is entitlement
---
Shiver me timbers
---
Got to 59 last night.

I can‚Äôt wait for it. The only thing left to wish for is bandana and goggles head cosmetic for his S2 outfit. :)

Oh man yeah I'd really like that too
---
They never got the rights to his likeness so they had to make their own. Apparently he was modeled after one of the behavior team members
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
What kind of power would it have though?
---
Again with this gen Rush is not a problem of the survivors is a problem of desing
---
I still really hope they release that as a separate piece. They did not-full-outfits for GhostFace, why can‚Äôt the same be done for Steve?

What a wonderful vision &lt;3
---
Go play friday the 13th with no core mechanics you stupid fuck.
---
Well, it takes you 500 AC for one character from the shop. And if you buy via steam, it is cheaper, and you get a reskin for one of the characters. BUT. When new chapter comes out, new characters are available in the in-game store a bit earlier then in steam store itself. (Also if you dont give a fuck just buy licensed characters via steam and grind for others such as clown, spirit, etc)
---
2 people, 1 gen. Was it so hard for one of you to run the killer around while the other does a generator?
---
The build you have is pretty good since its focused on slowing the game down.
---
Though I would choose either Ruin or Corrupt. If survivors see corrupt then they will likely spend time looking for totems rather than doing gens until the timer is up. I personally think you could either Swap ruin or Corrupt With Pop goes the Weasel for more gen pressure.
---
Personally, I run - Infectious Freight/Ruin/Pop Goes The Weasel/BBQ&amp;C
---
Infectious Freight is amazing for snowballing with her if no one cleanses.
---
Ruin to slow the game down.
---
Pop great for controlling specific gens. Would prob work much better if combined with Corrupt rather than Ruin
---
BBQ &amp; C to improve the relatively poor points the Plague receives.

Don't fall asleep. If you're awake then you're likely to win chases - if you're asleep then it's only a matter of time before you hit his puddles. Avoid hugging loops while asleep, because hugging loops almost guarantees you hitting several puddles if the Freddy has any kind of experience.
---
While you're awake, *rush*. Get as much done as possible while you're awake. Get the clocks if you can - the extra awake time is worth its weight in gold.
---
What normally happens against Freddy is that people stay asleep, get hit by all his penalties, and have short chases because his puddles stop them dead. You spend more time unhooking and/or healing than actually doing gens, and the next thing you know everyone is on death hook and all Freddy has to do is mop up. Stay awake as long as possible, make the most of the chase until he sleeps you, and try not to go down beside an incomplete gen (because Fred will use his teleport to proxy camp it, and that won't end well for you).

Well the rake is quiet being so it could have a stealth ability. But he has other powers as well; he could climb things, teleport, become invisible and my favorite; he can shape shift. It would be pretty cool to disguise themselves as a survivor for a tiny amount of time. You could make them look disgusting and filthy to Distinguish them from actual survivors.

You already don‚Äôt get a lot of points for camping since you‚Äôre not doing anything and moris also don‚Äôt give you a lot of points.

---
This entire map is very bright for survivors. Nowhere is pitch black.
---
Finished an entire glass of water waiting for the video to start.
---
If someone is getting gen rushed, even without Ruin, then they probably aren‚Äôt playing very well. If they want to complain about being gen rushed then wait until they face a SWF all with BNPs. 
---
Pushing gens hard is one stray against Freddy since he grows stronger as the game goes on. Part of being a survivor is knowing how to counter certain killers. Part of being a killer is trying to counter the counter. 
---
Even beyond all of that, there will be games where killers get lucky or survivors get lucky with map generation or spawning.
---
Play the game and move on. I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve spawn in the killer shack next to the killer. You laugh, hope the killer lets you go, and if they don‚Äôt move the heck on.
---
Whatever they do it needs to be 1:1. If they do nothing about moris then they do nothing to keys. If they change keys then that same update needs to have mori changes as well
---
ok...
---
That old dodge is not going to be a think in the state of the game the queue times survivors are long is going to be very rare if you find your friends
---
U know, mori used to be instant, so killers wouldn't have to hook survivours in the first place to be able to kill them, so it is a bit easier now
---
You‚Äôre like Hitler, but even Hitler cared about Germany or something

I'd hang that up on my wall.
---
They're 2 types of players, those who play to when and those who play for fun.
---
The people playing to win will push you to use the same top 5-8 perks
---
The people who play for fun will say use whatever build you want and tweak it until it's right
---
That being said, borrowed time goes well with we're gonna live forever, as even if they take a hit and escape it will be counted as a safe unhook
---
Basement Face challenge was actually my favorite... it pleased me greatly to see how dumb people were to continually go into the basement. I had a "Christmas Tree" down there with all 4 hooks.

When you do a rushed action (fast vault/ leave locker fast) does the killer get always get notified or only when close/ in terror radius?
---
End game chat has been wholesome as fuck for me. Out of 30 or so games played over the holidays, only three had shitty end game chat. If the killer sucked, survivors were offering helpful non-ironic suggestions. If the Survivors sucked, they'd congratulate the killer for well-played games.
---
My suggestion -- be the first to talk and set a positive tone. Doesn't always work, but you gotta be the change you want to see.

How can you know though? I can assume it‚Äôs not always that obvious

I agree. I think you should keep resilience and get rid of this is not happening for iron will. but resilience is very strong if you 99% your heal. Just be careful against stealthy killers because they can punish you for 99%ing.

Oh wow I can see these perks being in the game. They‚Äôre not too broken except for maybe the first one I‚Äôd lower the boost speed to 1/5/7 or something like that but everything else seems pretty fair I would say

Well the only legit reason to run it is to stack it with perks that increase objective speed while injured. So you can do gens faster, heal others faster, etc. Other than that its just a meme or to make the gamer harder for yourself.
---
r/TheCouncilOfAsh
---
Basically, two really good addons of his are his Jump ropes(considerably decreases repair, sabotage, and heal speed while in the dream world), and his swing chains(applies a slight decrease to heal, repair, and sabotage actions for awake and asleep survivors but stacks for every survivor in the dreamworld up to a tremendous penalty).
---
Essentially combining these two addons, with perks such as Thanatophobia, Ruin, and Pop, and it can lead to a pretty annoying experience for the survivor. It isn‚Äôt hard to play against, and frankly I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily broken, but at the highest possible penalties generators take an excessively long time.
---
I think the teleport would be good if the ranges were a little smaller

finally it's really viable /s

It depends. The most commonly agreed "toxic swf" are those who sweat to win and also bully the killer by making coordinated plays with the intention of making the killer mad. Honestly, just play with your friend and dont go out of your way to harass anyone and you're fine.
---
first two perks are sick but i doubt theyd do that, theyd be wayyy strong paired together
---
 third perk is kinda eh and reminds me of that one useless perk they added with stranger things
---
yeah it is pretty obvious here that they‚Äôre together but it just sucks that it‚Äôs impossible to play with friends who aren‚Äôt as good, they deserved the L though you were playing w only two perks and no ruin meaning they had years to get all gens and totems
---
Yeah I watched Fungoose as well, super good for helping me get Killer. I've watched all his vids and know he doesn't like to commit but wasnt aware of that 15 second rule, I'll keep that in mind.
---

---
Thank
---
That is very true. Plus with the sheer emptiness of the last few pages on the free side, you‚Äôd think they could add a few more things like that.
---
Yeah, we get the Cleaver prototype and some insignificant head for Claudette, but I think we could have gotten a little more to fill in the blanks.
---
Thanks bb
---
That is tough since leather face is pretty hard atm, but I would say ruin, dying light, pop, and maybe bamboozle or bbq if you want that in there with insta saw
---
apparently they are discussing it. they have contacted the original actor, so here is to hoping.
---
Huh guess that would be too good of a bundle lol
---
It's literally "Survive with friends", so playing with friends. 
---
It's not a big deal if survivors are not experimented; but really good survivors coordinated, can be a pain in the ass, specially if they're toxic.
---
Pink haired flashlight Nea: fuck you for running Noed. 
---
Me: if you have time to flashlight click you have time for totems honey.
---
But that‚Äôs the same as those two survivors getting out the door? Just means they got out faster. Doesn‚Äôt mean anything that you lost two kills if you had them both dead hook. Everyone wins

Thanks a lot, I'll go through this when I have time

Tbh killing the key holder does nothing if he doesn't have anything to preserve it. Anyone can go pick it up
---
I‚Äôm perfectly fine with Moris the way they are, but if they did make a change, I‚Äôd say make it so you can kill everyone still, but you need two hooks instead of one. 
---
But that doesn‚Äôt really give the Killer that much of a benefit. Then again, it‚Äôs still more useful than those luck things for survivors.
---
Ok longbeard.
---
I was checking that last night lol, I played against a team that really gave me a run for my money. I figured they had to be in the chat together, they were so coordinated.
---
I think the best solution to a face camp could be bonus bps for the hooked (maybe tied to how many gens are complete while hooked). That way it's not too bad for the survivor. It might encourage survivors to do gens and the killer will be losing bps while the survivors gain more. 
---
The trouble is this game is so buggy that any detection system is likely to cause more problems.
---
It's not the same as them getting out the doors, did you not read the part that says "2 gens left"?
---
* Bandwagon meme (memes which attempt to ride off the success of another post on /r/deadbydaylight without making significant changes).

Hahaha no wraith us definitely not op in any rank.
---
Also Ghostface is a wraith that doesn't have to uncloak to hit survivors, just because you can stalk doesn't mean you have to.
---
Yeah that makes sense to me. The level 2 unhook challenge is an endgame level 2 challenge whereas the level 3 one is a prerequisite and opens the door to all the others, therefore the difficulty should be inherently lower so as to lead to greater challenges down the road
---
But it is pretty brutal
---
You can also eat a pallet stun to end your power instead of the longer stun when it ends. Useful if you have enduring.

Thanat and Dying Light, with a Nasty blade, will slow the game down.

What have you never seen 2 survivors do more than 2 gens and still escape?
---
Yo mate calm down, its just a joke ;)
---
But it doesn‚Äôt have strength, as in it‚Äôs not a strong perk

If you see 4 commodious with BNPs everyone has prove thyself, and they will leave people on hooks to finish gens, that's gen rushing and it results in one of the most boring games

I think alert is underrated but she isn't a god. I can agree üòÇ
---
basically freddy have an addon that makes you very slow when you're asleep and unable to wake yourself up by blowing up a gen, hence making it take forever to do a gen
---
Playing with casual friends who try to do their objectives is not a big deal; but 4 good survivors with coordinated perks and bm'ing is over powered and make the game not fun for the killer at all.

I feel like a worse person when I play nea. I get relieved when people are hurt bc it means I have time to do gens. She's cursed.

You won‚Äôt get much of a positive response for posting things like this. Joke or not. Most of the community sees it as bullying.

[GUIDE: HITBOX](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide_hitbox/)
---
ok:(! thanks for letting me know
---
I've always considered the idea of removing Hex:Ruin altogether, and substituting it for an in-game mechanic. Make the first 5 skill checks all Ruin, make it so a skill check triggers every 4 - 7 seconds, and increase the time it takes to complete a gen by 20 seconds.
---
That way; it frees up your 4th perk, you get similar amounts of Hex:Ruin as you normally would at high ranks, and survivors only have to suffer through it 5x before it's gone. I think that could be a nice starting point to see if gen rushing is still just as bad.
---
happened to me once aswell, it is good for screenshots at least
---
Still most survs I've played against heal because of it and that gives me a bit more time to do stuff
---
Just went from not wanting to get up to instantly getting dbd ready
---
I mean if were being real here, blocking pallets and windows while incloaking is how you're supossed to use Wraith.
---
CUT!!!
---
You messed up your line... try again
---
STOP!!! Do you feller's have yer homo pass?
---
Yup. I just accidentally collected 100k in rewards that I was saving for leveling up Oni (1 million BP + the rewards)... But now thats gone..
---
Interesting idea, feel like it would be really bad at botrom ranks though? Like too opressive for baby survivors
---
lol me too.
---
I really like this one.
---
No because at that point I can easily patrol and pressure just 2 people. 2 gens can still be alot of time considering if I chase one there will only be 1 person to finish 2 gens solo.
---
That's how I play a lot, I'm definitely not a crazy good killer or super aware of the games mechanics, I just try to play my best every game. I feel like my game last night reminded me not to give up because you can turn the tides really fast. My lucky turn around came in the last 3 minutes of the game when I thought all hope was lost already. 
---
If I can figure out how to make a gif out of my footage I'll send a link if you'd like haha. I got maybe one hook at the beginning of the match and I'm still surprised that I locked in a 3k.
---
Yep.

Especially with that outfit and if you‚Äôre on console.

---
They really know how to explain things while playing against good survivors. And both have some guides on billy, not as many or detailed as ohtofu, but definitly helpfull
---
I might do this with some other survs if that's cool with you?
---
I‚Äôve already made them all lmao. I posted the next four about an hour ago and will post more tomorrow. But I don‚Äôt care! You do you dude
---
I got looped for four gens as a baby, now I know when to give up a chase and patrol so I don't DC there.
---
If Some dick is flashclicking me they might eat a mori, but it's all good because if they're going for an unsafe save by flashlight then more than likely I'm getting *both* of them. Again, no need to DC.
---
If I'm being basement camped then I wander off to grab a beer and read while I'm waiting. Again, no need to DC and hey - my team is gonna win so that's pretty good I would say.
---
I don't see any reason to DC apart from being salty. Which I get, fine, people can be dicks, but don't be a dick in return 'cos then the world is just a clusterfuck of cunts.
---
Well between the UE, Fixated and Spine Chill on OP, I‚Äôm gonna assume they play stealthy and can‚Äôt run chases at all. And who knows about the Meg. But they could‚Äôve also attempted, no need for the Meg to just suicide
---
So just your personal experience, then? Got it.
---
I noticed when i was being hooked, the killers movement was stuttering badly. P2p has serious survivor drawbacks.
---
Probably some little kid overreacting...
---
I play both! But I'm new so whenever someone pulls off a spicy play like this I just take notes
---
Yeah I feel like the ones we completed already should be compensated with extra Rift Fragments. Like that ridiculous 15 iridescent emblem one, which I had to do 1 at a time because even if I got four in one game, it only counted one. I spent a lot of time doing the challenges I already did lol
---
&gt;  Killers feel so fast. Especially in small loops. 
---
They are! That's why you'll want to drop pallets early and move on to the next loop. It takes some practice before you get good at judging killer's speed and behavior, so don't try to "loop" them the way you see streamers do it. Until you get to lower ranks just running in a straight line and dropping pallets and vaulting windows should be enough to make chases take long enough for a gen to pop against most killers.
---
Mori alone toxic swf alone toxic mori and swf perfect balance as all things should be
---
‚ÄúDS, a perfectly counterable perk‚Äù explain how to counter it?
---
You have failed the vibe check.
---
Die
---
Would anyone happen to know the song used?
---
Found all on them on 1 gen at Yamaoka estate, once i mori'd their leader it was a game of slug &amp; seek
---
Does it exist? Yes. But it‚Äôs not what most people mean.
---
Genrushing is when all survivors bring BNP or Commodious Toolboxes with yellow and brown repair speed add-ons and refuse to even unhook eachother for the sake of completing gens. Haven‚Äôt seen that in AGES
---
Gens being done at fast speeds is just game going by and killer not ending chases fast (either because of misplays, bad map spawns/designs or playing a killer without options to do so)
---
Ghost Face is my daddy as well brother, your words touched my heart.
---
It‚Äôs really an overrated perk tbh, you‚Äôd be better off running something more useful like maybe thrilling tremors to get info
---
Are you sure? If there‚Äôs only one you either close the hatch meaning no gens to be done or they find the hatch. And many people with a 3 gen (with 2 people left 4 gen) strat and still lose. Based on your attitude towards hatches I don‚Äôt expect much else. But complaining about people being able to escape being unfair is just ridiculous. For two people to escape via hatch that takes communication and if they aren‚Äôt SWF that‚Äôs a hard task to accomplish.
---
I skipped this one. In level 2 I still havent done this and the one immediately before it, I'm at like 10/15 gens completed
---
good luck :)
---
I honestly think the issue with ruin, is how gens are done, how quickly, and so on. So to fix it, I don't think we have to do anything about ruin, but make changes to the gens, honestly i don't know how, but - ruin is only picked so often because it nearly feels as a requirement.
---
SHUT IT OFF FREDDY! SHUT IT OFF!
---
And prove thyself.
---
Maybe, but I'm inclined to say 'no'. It's only 5 skill checks, and after that it's gone versus rank resets where they have to suffer through an entire Hex:Ruin.
---
At red ranks, often it isn't a matter of not being skilled enough. You can do really well on all your chases and get 4 escapes/depip if you don't focus 1 or 2 survivors. I find that surveillance does almost nothing, and it doesn't give you global gen control like ruin does. Unless you get lucky by getting a good slug opportunity or getting bad survivors, you should lose against optimal survivors without ruin (or another good gen perk like pop)
---
These are impressive and well intentioned fixes.
---
Funnily enough I completed the 50 break challenge today...
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave
---
This is cool. But you realize tattoos are permanent right? That's gonna be on your arm for the rest of your life.
---
You are level 22 and they are 36 day left you have to play al least two hours per day
---
You think I'll ever forget Ace?
---
Exactly! It's a 'need' perk rather than a 'want' perk. I NEED to put the perk on to slow down gen progression as much as I can. Therefore, have Ruin auto-apply without even equipping it, but only have it so for the first 5 skill checks. It's a win-win for both sides! Survivors only suffer through it for a little while, while killers are free to use a different perk! On top of that, adding 20s to complete a gen slows the game down even more. But all of these are small changes that can be used as a starting point to adjust it later
---
I have bbq, play with your food, ruin and I‚Äôm all ears

Love this meme but I'm the solo guy getting left on hook to die after doing the objective and being cool to killer...just for killer to tell me, " sorry mate, I thought they would get you off hook(sadface)gg"....but it's not a gg when I die and get deranked and lose my green flashlight :(....but I know it's out of killers hands to unhook you but grrrr....

Still Amazing meme though haha :)
---
It‚Äôs been free so many times on every platform so
---
I respectfully disagree with you. Red ranks solo survivor is arguably the worst experience in the game and rank =\= skill but rather playtime
---
slug the survivor after they get unhooked
---
I do what my problems what I do with dbd killers: run until I'm dead or gone.
---
booping the snoot?
---
hahahahahahahah
---
right. from what i remember it‚Äôs a blood oath, so obviously they take it pretty seriously. Most people don‚Äôt know that so it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre (OP) late to the game or anything.
---
YES to this ! 1000x yes.
---
Idk, when I was testing MoM on the ptb the protection hits still felt kinda broken. I took a hit for someone while they were being carried to a hook and it didn't give me a stack but I got the protection hit score event.
---
Yes and no; It regresses a gen by 25%, so if a gen has 25% progress or lower, it'll regress to 0% instantly
---
or you can just not be an ass
---
I don't do that.. When I play piggy it's purely to farm bps. So 95% of the time I let everyone leave
---
I tried doing this in a game and they assumed I was trying to farm and killed me instantly
---
I pi ked up The Plague during the sale and I have been learning her with marginal success. While I work on my aim and shooting, general tips would be wonderful for her! But I do have to ask, Vile Purge says it infects generators and other environment stuff. What other locations can be infected? Pallets? Meat hooks? Chests? Lockers?
---
Looks like the changed it to 1, which is more reasonable.
---
So much truth.
---
do the point emote at their nose, preferably while they‚Äôre crouched, *definitely* if they snort repeatedly
---
Is it a supercut of someone (Randy Savage?) inhaling repeatedly?
---
Ah, thanks!
---
[I hit her!](https://youtu.be/VGGt9dJmeh0?t=49)
---
Yeah I actually did that one spamming Freddy and an ultra altruistic unhook survivor build. Nice thing is I could swap if I got bored of playing either side. I like the ones that can be done as killer or survivor.
---
it happens. :( some pigs don‚Äôt appreciate it, and some will only accept boops under certain conditions
---
Yeah the title is only 50% accurate, but with BHVRs hitboxes and connection something being 50% accurate is pretty impressive.
---
Tbh ghostface is the best bagger in the game so it shouldnt be surprising.
---
Yes.
---
Hi, does the next DLC include a fix for Rank Update Error?
---
Should a new player just save items/addons/offerings for when they get into higher ranks to avoid consuming them without needing to?
---
True. I looped him for 3 gens..
---
Cool.
---
I was saying are you sure to you saying that with one person left they have to do 2 gens. Which isn‚Äôt true. In no way shape or form would the killer be allowing them to do the two gens, and the survivor wouldn‚Äôt even try. The hatch would be the first thing on everyone‚Äôs mind. 
---
And cool, you‚Äôre a rank 1 killer. Same. And my opinion is the complete opposite of yours so let‚Äôs throw that out the window. I‚Äôve seen it happen time and time again (with me on survivor), that 3 people will finish 5 gens and all escape because of a dc. That two people against a 3 gen strat will escape via doors. And in all my time playing killer I have never had people bring or find a key and escape via hatch with more than one person, both old and new hatches. Because you have to work to get that and even harder for more than one.
---
Quick and Quiet is one of the most slept on perks. Tired of hearing people say it‚Äôs only useful if you equip it with another perk.
---
I mean they're useful, that's not a bad thing and in some situations can be strong also not a bad thing. That doesn't change the fact that most games they're brought into the key doesn't even come into play like at all. I've had multiple people leave on me with a key like twice ever, and I've faced people who brought keys a LOT more than that.
---
They aren't that much of a game changer in a standard game like people like to paint it as.
---
Good luck getting 5 traps in one game at anything above yellow ranks playing normally.
---
smh survivor mains downvoting you
---
Points dont matter at this point. People that genuinely care about points will play to earn points, and obviously won't run Morris. It's the sick fucks who get pleasure out of ruining the game for everyone else that uses them. That's why they are a problem. There is 0 counterplay, it's not fun in any way
---
I did tho
---
Theres the answer lol. Especially in mid ranks killers dont like being shown they arent the greatest of all time.
---
No... Some pigs are just pigs, You know?
---
Lmao ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù
---
Honestly just burn what you have when you have it. It‚Äôs better than waiting for some random ‚Äúperfect moment‚Äù especially if you prestige a character.
---
You kill a survivor with a key and another one comes and picks it up. 
---
They‚Äôre both loads of horseshit. Saying otherwise is nothing short of pandering equivocation
---
This is unfortunate. As a proud pig main, I ALWAYS appreciate a good boop of the snoot and I apologize for my more bloodthirsty brethren.
---
u/xtracrispybacon11 Thank you so much, you made my day and these challenges easier to tolerate.
---
What‚Äôs slug
---
I actually have both and all the times i get 2k with GF and 3-4 with Wraith. might help that Wraith addons are better but
---
Are they drawing or um...
---
I've never felt so identified with one of these memes. Goddamn, screw those Toxic Neas
---
Cause if it's a girl and girl it gay
---
Boy and girl is gay cause girl like pp and dat gay
---
Boy and boy is gay
---
People got 15 free levels?!?!?! Where are mine?!
---
Scratched Mirror is only useful in closed maps and it is actually fun and scary to go against. It is also balanced, he can see you but he is a 105% killer with short lunge.
---
I remember watching your haddonfield demo video, your edits are great üëç
---
They could have something to show the survivors if they are a bot or a player via their instanses, if they are on frenzy instance its a player, of they are just walking its a bot
---
Yes!
---
I'm not too sure what point you're trying to make, as the same examples can be used for any situation. Killer has thanataphobia + sloppy butcher...just run the best med kit + addons + self-care healing boost, and those perks become less valuable immediately.
---
The point isn't to stop gens being done, but to slow them down enough so that the killer can have SOME breathing room
---
If you can name a counter to genrushing then I will gladly use it as long as I dont become a bitch for it. I'm a self respecting killer, I dont want to run Moris and noed just because the survivors get gens done too fast. And I dont want to constantly play spirit as my only option to consistently 4k.
---
Technically, as long as you're playing with 1 or more friends, you're SWF. But it's only a problem under certain circumstances (the things you mentioned).
---
Wen you realise it's not a great perk and every decent survivor can get around it
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie tho, I‚Äôm glad about hat because it meant I had to be less of a toxic shit bag putting all the survivors in the basement with shrine
---
Lol people trying to say they break every pallet before finishing a chase. Bullll.
---
Does it leave any scratch marks if you let go of the run button fast enough?
---
Holy shit that is fantastic
---
Pig players are like Susie and neon hair survivor players, but with a lower power level. Their "ugu piggy wiggy 0w0" schtick gets old fast but after BHVR gave them the nerf stick over and over they've become subbies who know their place. Now oink for me.
---
It's leaving a survivor on the ground instead of hooking them. It's called slugging because of the trail of blood they leave behind while moving.
---
They don‚Äôt have his likeness I‚Äôm assuming.
---
On PC, you can just see on their profile if they're friends with each other.
---
Thats actually what it‚Äôs supposed to be.
---
Its confirmed in the Halloween Chapter Spotlight.
---
Kills are easier because you can just camp the first person you see
---
With injuries it's harder because the more you kill the less power you get
---
The point is there is no breathing room. Even with a change like you described the gens would still get done between 40-90 seconds. And against half decent, non braindead survivors, that goes by realllly quick
---
As a Ghostface main, yes
---
Wait people get to use their Mori and their keys? What is wrong with me?
---
All of those. Windows as well.
---
Okay cool. So there‚Äôs SWF and then there‚Äôs SWF and being big douches
---
Wraiths are nice:) 
---
Also, I solo 95% of the time, so why do I still get tunneled off hook and moried all the time? :(
---
They still wont heal
---
Dude this was just posted here like 2 days ago. Not only is this a repost but you didn't give the guy credit and it's a repost of something that was just posted like even a week ago.
---
you may now laugh
---
Reasonable to have the THICC BIHH herself twerk at the exit gate
---
I see you're doing the Lord's work.
---
Because that's what they're called in game. They're an offering called ______ memento mori. Killed can be both morid or sacrificed so people say mori.
---
Issa meme bruh
---
I'm not sure what your comment is saying? I never said holding m1 on a generator is fun
---
If you nerf ebonies then keys have to be nerfed as well they are both bullshit mechanics that ends games way too early for either side
---
Yes, because the totem spawning next to someone in the corner of the map away from gens is a doable patrol route.
---
I'm surprised pc is dead. I figured it would be the most active, I play xbox and its pretty active.
---
You could, but you can only kill survivors with an item called a Mori.
---
May I ask something while you're still replying? How do I put the blue text next to my name because I play Spirit and I'm on PS4 too.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary
---
Yeah but in the new systems there‚Äôs punishment for intentional dc is there not? So you‚Äôd be fucking yourself for intentionally leaving. Killer gets # of kills per dc. Survivor gets # of gems per dc. Fair is fair
---
I don't think Thomas Trench (gas mask guy) is a girl...
---
I see, thank you bwana
---
Np
---
Pretty sure it's a old language, so maybe Latin? Or some other old language since she is the oldest killer in the game
---
Thankfully I realized it pretty early and I took 2 hits to get one of them done. A small price to pay
---
Because it's Memento Mori. I think it's a perk.
---
It‚Äôs the exact same with keys bud
---
It would be nice if the BP reward WAS changed however.
---
How old is she canonically?
---
Dude... same.
---
When I play killer, it‚Äôs right next to a generator in the open and obvious. When I play survivor, you have to provide the blood of your enemies and tears of orphans to get a 10% chance of finding it.
---
I would say he is weak, especially at high ranks where survivors know not to heal against him. Very fun tho and good for pipping and getting bloodpoints.
---
/r/cromch
---
I know that. I am a killer main. I hate keys too.but we talking about moris rn
---
The counter play is looping, which is fairly easy against most the killers in the game. Keys however can‚Äôt be countered in the slightest
---
The offering they burn to gain that ability is called a Memento Mori
---
damn I'm curious now, how would that look like? Overcharge + Unnerving?
---
edit just saw Monto lmao
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure a b-line to the totem will suffice in stopping any ‚Äútotem rushing‚Äù
---
Nearly every meme posted is the same killer meme over and over again lol  
---
"your teammates swarming the hook didnt mean i camped you"  
---
"when you face the same toxic swf and bring in a mori"  
---
"guys i dont know what i did wrong in this match, i \[humbly\] killed everyone and got called a camper and toxic killer. what did i do wrong guys"  
---
"me trying to play a daily &gt; the toxic swf gang calling me a baby killer and camper"  
---
"survivor rule book"
---
If you talk about ebonies then you have to bring up keys as well as they are in the same boat of bullshit
---
Just change outfits then? lol I mean I know it‚Äôs dumb but you have to understand it is a bit of a statement to some killers because 80% of the people wearing the typical toxic outfits are in fact toxic. I had to convince my friend to change his feng‚Äôs outfit because killer‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt stop dodging us. So we both changed outfits and didn‚Äôt have a problem the rest of the night. Is it stupid not to enjoy cosmetics? Yeah a bit. Do people that buy the flashy cosmetics think they‚Äôre gods gift to man? Yeah a bit. It sucks but I blame the survivors who give it a bad name as opposed to the killer‚Äôs who have to deal with them.
---
Babylonian Era.
---
More like 2-3 random maps you can vote on before the match starts, not every map in the game?
---
Or you could live with the fact that you don't always have to get a 4k
---
:)
---
Real panty wetter, that face
---
I see people do it because its very possible to have a dominating 3k and still black pip as killer
---
I haven't seen it yet so stfu
---
I‚Äôm rank 5 currently
---
You'll be 3rd if I'm in there with him running deliverance.
---
This is probably a bad example because going for flashlight saves is just normal survivor sweating and bodyblocking as wraith is just playing him properly.
---
Actual wraith toxicity is face camping while spamming decloak and then tunneling them because they can't use BT.
---
&gt;Yes, not everyone who plays a f2p buys anything. But some do.
---
Yes, some do but, in the current system BHVR makes money no matter what from multiple sources. 
---
I also forgot about Battle Pass and people that might buy tiers or grind for the levels.
---
Counter a gen rush by camping the 3 gens closest to each other. Of course sometimes you‚Äôll get screwed by being on a map like the swamp or not realizing you‚Äôre getting gen rushed until it‚Äôs too late.
---
Perks like dissonance or thanataphobia are the anti gen rush perks. 
---
Like all perks, sometimes they‚Äôre useful sometimes and sometimes they aren‚Äôt. At the end of the day there are going to be games where none of your perks are relevant. 
---
Survivors have gotten so good at locating totems I hardly even use ruin anymore. I focus on detection and anti stealth perks, but I‚Äôm also a shocky boi when I play killer.
---
bt is a bill perk btw, and if those perks work for you, you do you.
---
weve got a professional here
---
Didn't call it totem rushing, and a B-line to the totem will more than likely increase suspicion of the totem being there.
---
Stealth...
---
I know but on console it wasn‚Äôt for bill so i got it for most of my survivors before he came out
---
It can‚Äôt be too serious because BHVR can‚Äôt tell for certainty if it‚Äôs lag or lag switch
---
This is silly. Combating toxicity with toxicity. What a pointless and endless cycle
---
Same, my looping game is weaker than a brown medkit with absorbent pad while affected by cloutophobia
---
Purely and simply, it makes one lazy. Killer is all about time management, going all-in on slowdown means there's nothing really left for the Freddy player to do.
---
Emphasis on "all-in". Some people will just toss slowdown add-ons into their standard Ruin-Pop setup, and that's the worst case scenario. In your case you're using Pop with two perks that'll tell you every time a survivor so much as looks sideways at a gen, so it's not the worst case scenario, but it certainly stacks things very heavily in your favour - and it's not a combination that will translate as effectively to any killer that lacks a travel power.
---
I just recently started to SWF but we all play for fun, I don‚Äôt like being toxic unless the killer was (Face-camping, tunneling, etc)
---
I see you‚Äôre a wraith main
---
I dont know if it would be possible for them to implement something like ‚Äútotems cant spawn fewer than x meters away from survivors or generators‚Äù but if they could thatd be pretty helpful.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm right yet I‚Äôm down 60 points‚Äù
---
the reddit experience in 7 words
---
Oh, no, my bad dude. I meant MY computer died. GPU basically popped.
---
We also need a decisive strike animation!
---
[That was a joke, though.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dzlf16/can_we_get_an_f_for_our_poor_boy_peanits/f8bn9ae/?context=1000)
---
I‚Äôve been seeing the term slugged used a lot lately, what does it mean
---
 " Pop Team Epic "
---
They would still have to get approval from the license holders though and considering that chapter isn‚Äôt even on Switch, I wonder if they‚Äôre difficult to work with
---
&gt;Can you explain this please explain
---
Read the guide and you will understand the difference between ping and hitbox.
---
If you play 2-4 hours a day. Depending on if you do every single challenge.
---
Dont bother, mine just got removed for oversaturated content. Whenever I have a witty idead it's too late.
---
Pretty sure he was joking
---
I dont mind tho
---
Haha, I ran dead hard for a bit because I thought it was the answer to all my problems... but in unskilled hands it just prolongs the inevitable for an extra 2 seconds. Also good killers bait it out.
---
It doesn‚Äôt.
---
Totems already have set places to spawn, it's as simple as moving those locations or reworking a few maps like they did with badham.
---
I can understand where you‚Äôre coming from, and I agree to a certain extent.  It‚Äôs definitely not a black and white comparison, but I do think both suck to play against. 
---
One thing a key has going for it are the obvious add-ons that are paired with it.  Unless the killer‚Äôs running Franklin‚Äôs, you‚Äôll never lose your key as long as those add-ons stay intact. It‚Äôs like a permanent safety blanket.
---
Why do they stop cleansing?
---
Ok? I‚Äôve had several cases wherein I will not tunnel and still get hit with DS. And almost never will you be there when the survivor is unhooked. Any player can just hop into a locker when DS is up and be perfectly safe once they‚Äôre unhooked.
---
No, I'm a ghostface main and I can tell you I only tbag when I want to be friendly to the last survivor, Also the last gen was done so he probably was thinking there was no way he was winning
---
Also if they have eyes. Having eyes is a good way to track blood pools too.
---
But you‚Äôre saying that they will find the totem right away. I run ruin but patrol gens because having it broken seems to make the game more interesting. I play solely for fun, and don‚Äôt see the reason for a totem hiding buff
---
No
---
the fact is, the challenges werent that hard. Ive unhooked 2 people after EGC started many times in this game. people just bitch too much and BHVR gives in way too easily. thats why old Freddy sucked, why Nurse got nerfed, why Spirit got nerfed, whyc Legion got nerfed waaaaaaaaaay too hard. the next one will probably be new Freddy or Hillbilly.
---
So you're not found/hooked first. Then you don't have to complain about it to r/DeadbyDaylight.
---
The Asylum map is probably the worst offender. You can have totems literally spawn in the middle of giant fields with no map props or grass to hide them.
---
DS is only usable for one minute after being unhooked, so not throwing them back onto a hook within a minute means the perk won't work
---
playing Adam is even more of a secure way to get hooked first. Adams run deliverance.
---
*screams in sonic fandom*
---
oh god now this has spread to this sub too
---
Depends what you mean by best. 
---
Survivors are all the same. But killers have different strengths and levels of fun.
---
Traps activate once the next generator is completed, after fully applying the trap to.
---
As The Pig you cannot see the timer tick down only that it is ticking down.
---
This used to happen to me a lot, and even my SWF group at the time noticed. I don't really have this problem anymore, and here's what I usually do at the start of the match.
---
If I start next to someone, I make sure that I go somewhere different than them. A second person increases the chance of scratch marks or noise, and will trigger Discordance if you're working on a gen with someone and the killer is running it.
---
If I start next to a gen, I determine its placement on the map before I start working on it. Gens in corners or on far ends of the map tend to be ones that killers check first.
---
If I am near a corner gen, I usually move to the middle of the map and work on the gen there. The killer almost never checks that gen before finding someone. Moving to the middle of the map gives you a better view of what's going on, and possibly gives you a heads up on who the killer is.
---
Run the perk Spine Chill for a bit. It tells you when the killer is looking in your direction, and gives you a 5 or 6 second head start on most killers, giving you the option to hide or run. Alternatively, you could run Bond so you can see what your teammates are doing. You'll be able to see if someone is running towards you, or if no one is in your area.
---
I walk a lot more now. I used to run everywhere, cause walking feels so slow. Don't be afraid to walk for a while at the start of the game. Killers are looking for anything to help get the ball rolling.
---
how
---
Oh ew, Then hes just an ass
---
You have 3 Legion "traps" at the start of a match.
---
These can be used in chase with zero slowdown for forcibly block survivors from going somewhere. The ability can also be channeled for 4 seconds with no slowdown to spawn a Legion at a gen and or totem. Survivors within X meters of the stationed Legion member will have their field of view decreased for 20 seconds, will hear chase music for 10 seconds, and have their location revealed to the Legion for 5 seconds. This causes all Legion members to be unable to reveal the location of that survivor for the next 80-60 seconds.
---
You can channel on a Legion member's aura to teleport to them through an entity themed gate.
---
This process can be canceled within the first 3 seconds of the channel. When a channel is completed the Legion will walk through the portal and give their Legion member an audible high five as they disappear. The Legion gains undetectable for 10 seconds.
---
Causing a Legion member to disappear will put them on recharge for the next 30 seconds.
---
Feral Frenzy works as normal.
---
This power is probably dumb tbh.
---
Mine was getting old to the point where I was going to start replacing some parts, but it was still running most games just fine on high or medium settings. When the GPU failed, a part of it actually like... literally burst off, and went into my CPU fan and fucking tore it off, damaging my CPU as well. It's like... c'mon man. I'm a poor Ph.D. student with a wife and kid. I can't afford this shit right now.
---
You probably pissed him off but he‚Äôs one of two killers with built-in insidious so I‚Äôm sure he attracts really vinaigrette-blooded people to play him.
---
Being a competent player and complaining about being hooked first are two different things, and I‚Äôm not complaining for e sake of complaining, I‚Äôm trying to get advice on how to play better rather then just go to ranks where players are worse
---
No idea what this means, but I‚Äôll still upvote
---
And the Haunted that got cleaned yesterday got the killer two diwns, while I was hooked. So....Imma say not always?
---
He is Claudette as killer
---
The odds are about the same honestly. The sides really mirror eachother. From the killers perspective, a survivor can only let escape if they get a certain amount of gens done, and get lucky enough to find it. But that can be negated if an swf runs map and key. Just like how if a killer runs an ebony, there's the chance that they get looped for a while, but if they run strong things like spirit, iri head huntress, etc, then it becomes as easy to mori survivors as it does for survivors with maps to find hatch
---
&gt;Agreed. Killers can be toxic and Survivors can be toxic, but survivors need to remember at the end of the day, killers are armed with more than a flashlight.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Lately I‚Äôve revelled in the salt as survivors genrush, then rage after I... 
---
Honest question, what are survivors supposed to do other than gens/bones? I def agree that default genspeed is super low, but that's something BHVR should fix. It's not the survivor's fault and I don't think you should take that strategy as "being toxic".
---
Ofc it's not going to be as busted as Mori's. By not doing obj I am assuming you mean NOED? (Which is probably the perk I hate the most)
---
still don‚Äôt get it
---
Probably. Or he just knew that if i get unhooked he‚Äôll lose
---
same with coldwind.
---
Ghost Face is probably the best non-license Stealth Killer.
---
Spirit is at the moment the most complained about character who just needs headphones to play.
---
Oni is coming out tomorrow and looks to be really good after you learn him.
---
I'd recommend looking up their play styles to see which one suits you more.
---
Must be MK9 Freddy.
---
People can change their opinions when presented with information lol
---
No reason to compromise a kill when you can only guarantee one lol
---
Wait, survivors using flashlights to save their teammate as designed by the game is toxic? I‚Äôm not being sarcastic. I‚Äôm genuinely asking.
---
It's going to be difficult to check, but as I recall Undetectable is *instant* rather than the slight delay that used to be associated with cloaking.
---
As I understand it, "cloaking" for Pig and Wraith used to mean that the Terror Radius simply shrank to 0 over time, which is why you could still get a Borrowed Time activation if you were *fast* (Pig might have taken longer than Wraith, but it was the same mechanic). With Undetectable, as I understand it the effect is instant.
---
Tagging u/Peanits and u/int3r4ct for safety, though.
---
haha that was a great clip! but did he not look at the new perks before jumping into the test server?
---
Fat Myers in full force. Needs images of the addons
---
What? GhostFace is licensed
---
Dude, isn't ghost face licensed mean he is from the movie scream...
---
&gt; *No decent freddy will let you loop on most tiles while asleep.*
---
I'll let you *try* to do it, hahaha!
---
Just have ebony mori's not work until the survivor has been hooked twice or if they are the obsession and have been hooked once. 
---
Still strong but now a build has to be used to make them broken.
---
This is amazing. The expression reads, "I'm sorry little one" to me.
---
What?!?!?
---
Has the next chapter's release day been confirmed yet?
---
gen rushing is a thing but this wasn't it
---
Is there some sort of notification when you gain bloodlust? I never seem to notice a difference.
---
Didn't I just explain I watched without sound? lmao
---
If you mean Cursed Legacy, it's expected to be tomorrow.
---
Just because you saw it doesn't mean everyone else saw it
---
If the killer finds you that easy you aren't being stealthy at all. If you're the type of player that expects to be able to run around constantly this will happen as well.
---
Shit like this is so obvious, and the only reason they don't realize how obvious it is *is because they don't play killer* lol
---
it's like if someone says "hey everyone, survivor main here. I just wanna say that gates don't take nearly long enough to open"
---
Maybe because they think it's easier to gen rush than worry about a long term effect? Dunno to be honest.
---
Must be nice to ruin things on medium. My old piece if garbage PC can't do that for 90% of games lol
---
I want a new one. Memes 9 years old. But I'm a poor man who just lost his job :/
---
The challenges have to be free though, you have to either buy or earn head on. I imagine that's why trapper and claudette were first.
---
Did the math as well. You don't account for daily xp or rift progress. With everything considered you still have to play a minimum of 6 to 7 matches each day, each about 10 minutesong to complete it.
---
He got sass
---
He gonna last
---
But most importantly
---
He mumch with class
---
Regardless, I used bamboozle on Legion and it's still fine as it is. Both with and without the power it's a good draw.
---
And necessarily a player can perform vault juke or won't it still there as an option, you just close the window with bamboozle because you vault faster as Legion. That's his ability.
---
Also, please don't drag the conversation. It's getting repetitive.
---
Wanna go back to old mori?

Yeah that's at it's top tier, at tier 1 it's 40 seconds, and 2 50 seconds. Honestly there is literally no such thing as "didn't tunnel" and got hit with DS. If you got back to them in under a minute you tunneled. If it's end game then it comes down to their ability to hit a skillcheck, cause you already lost.
---
When is freddy going to be perfectly balanced
---
You could easily make keychains out of those. I feel like you need more recognition for these.

For me it‚Äôs more like.... ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre about to hook someone. Let‚Äôs mask the skill check noise with the hook noise.‚Äù
---
Complaining about same memes while reposting one of the most common memes in this subreddit exactly üò©
---
It reaches front page like every 2 months.
---
Last call for the bandwagon, get on while you can!
---
I hate it yet I can't get enough of the reddit echo chamber.
---
Or maybe what they're saying is just stupid? Like this:
---
&gt; Horrible Matchmaking:
---
&gt; This doesn't even need much of an explanation. Red rank killers will get paired with low rank survivors all the time. There is no denying this issue.
---
This isn't the game being killer sided. This is people playing SWF. And this same thing causes low rank killers to play high rank survivors.
---
Or this:
---
&gt; Unusable Pallets:
---
&gt; This will be a quick one. There is a reason Hawkins Lab has the highest kill rate in the game, it's because it has the worst pallets. There are some pallets that are so bad the killer is actually better off leaving them up because they result in an easier chase if used (such as the Lampkin Lane car pallets). The whole point of a pallet is to allow the survivor to get more time for his team, but these pallets are actually just worthless against competent killers. 
---
The game is killer sided because of one map that has a lot of pallets, but they're mostly weak?
---
Come on.
---
Really? Wtf is wrong with the mods
---
I do believe it‚Äôs a bit more in depth than just tit for tat. Mainly because when someone does something over and over it will affect their brain in some way. That‚Äôs just what I‚Äôm assuming though I‚Äôm really not all that smart or well educated but I do observe things well so it does seem to be more than just ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck your too‚Äù.
---
Yeah meme is the word I was looking for! It‚Äôs just a meme mods pls
---
Right like I‚Äôm so confused. This game really does allow each side to just label normal things people are supposed to do as toxic which creates a bad cycle. I keep that in mind and it keeps me happy while I play the game but the end game lobby is where salty toxic people make me upset
---

---
oh fuck dude you totally got me oh no
---
Wut does LMNOP mean??
---
Yeah, I don't think I got credit for the survivor grab challenge either. I wasn't watching my BP's like a hawk but after I did the activate/deactivate thing they suggested I didn't notice any changes and when I went to my rift progress it didn't play the animation to jump forward in fragments like it usually does after you get fragments.
---
Disappointing, but expected if I'm honest
---
That above was a Hillbilly try? xD
---
Yep! It won't close the challenges off.
---
you do realize his sweater IS a christmas sweater right? its red and green
---
What‚Äôs being a professional have to do with wanting honesty? The more we generalize a circumstance the less we will understand it.
---
Playing without any meta gen stopping perks is pretty much impossible now
---
These are awesome! Super cool!
---
*I'm the bloodthirsty brethren*
---
By all means come and boop the snoot.... it means you'll be in punching range and my Amanda is on a lot of heroin soooo
---
I know, I'm making a bad joke.
---
Thank the entity holy fuck
---
Damn this looks good
---
shiiii, those are cool!!
---
It may count anyway, the challenge seems super bugged in what it considers a full health state. I did 2 heals with someone helping, one heal from 20% when someone was on the ground solo and a full heal solo on another player and at the end of the match I got credit for one heal on the challenge.
---
Oh yea I mean NOED. The perk itself like I don‚Äôt mind, yea give em an instadown sure. But being rewarded for the gens being done that much? Ridiculous. Fire up is fair because you get rewarded for simply one gen being done, and it‚Äôs not a super unfair reward.
---
I use Ghostface and I never toxic
---
I know that, i'm just making a small protest for them to give us what we want in the comments of a Reddit post. FREDDY COSMETICS 2020
---
Alright fine, run Object of Obsession. You'll never look back.
---
You mean no dead hard right?
---
Then no one would play with SWF and they would complain and cry. It would cause a problem
---
This image looks more like the ghost face lean stalking you as you try to unhook. Just my experience!
---
Who says it was /s?
---
As a survivor getting facecamped doesn‚Äôt feel good, but it at least you know that the rest of your team has literally 0 pressure and can freely do gens for the entire duration.
---
By the way. This is my wraith main and yes I drew it.
---
The game itself was originally designed for survivors to *not* have means of using real teamwork and having to form a makeshift strategy as the match goes on with nothing but some gestures to facilitate it. The game was never rebalanced to play differently than that but survivors were given SWF because Behavior panicked and realized playing with friends is how you keep a multiplayer game alive. As a result SWF was shoehorned in with zero thought and basically breaks the game and creates an extremely not fun experience for killers. 
---
Personally I think it should be removed but a lot of people aren‚Äôt going to agree with that.
---
Happy cake day
---
Even super coordinated SWFs on mic I can deal with, as long as you're doing that in red ranks; the whole point of red ranks is to go against skilled players trying their absolute hardest. But it pisses me off seeing a SWFs running Prove Thyself, instaheals, and full meta perks at like rank 15, three weeks after rank reset. You and I both know that you deranked to get back down there. What are you trying to prove by gen rushing and bullying a new killer? It's the epitome of "pick on someone your own size."
---
Not cursed if you main Legion
---
It would be nice if they were all put in one topic, since they are all related.
---
I think most people annoyed by keys would likely agree moris are worse. That moris are worse doesn't change that keys are also an annoying gameplay bypassing mechanic.
---
She speaks a really old language. I believe it starts with an A, Akkadian? Google it I think there‚Äôs answers out there somewhere lol. I just remember someone saying it on this app but that was awhile ago now that I saw it
---
It‚Äôs just the community having fun with a meme. I guess the mods prefer the toxic content only? Or the spam of ‚ÄúNeRf ThIs‚Äù every other post
---
I only notice long waits when playing killer. Sounds like we need less killer mains to fix the problem rather than just inviting more players who will just flood the killer lobbies anyway. 
---
F2P only means BHVR will put less time and money into further game development.
---
True this was my first game of legion in about a week and a half
---
Thank you, I will
---
Also with a mori you counter:
---
Flashlight saves
---
Head on saves
---
Decisive strikes
---
Pallet stun saves
---
Hook sabotages
---
Body blocks
---
Some of these might be possible to do for the first hooks, but after that *all* of these are countered for 8/12 hooks
---
What is with the equal complaints from killers and survivors on things they don't like, I mean God damn lol
---
I've been tracking my Hex spawns lately and I think something has been bugged since the last patch because even on maps with stupid strong spawn points they almost always spawn openly facing a gen or on shack. That's over 60 percent of my spawns so far across about 30 recorded games
---
Yeah that's just playing with friends. You could argue having extra comms is a little unfair, especially against higher rank killers, but as long as you're just trying to have fun you're not the type killers complain about. Basically, if you go into the game with the intention "I just want to try and escape/ pip/ have fun" you're okay. If you go into it thinking "I'm going to make this killer DC" you're probably toxic.
---
I honestly never thought about that. Now that you said it this makes a lot of sense tho. But usually when I play with my friends we get destroyed by killers.
---
On the contrary. It will encourage them to release more survivor and killer dlc for people to buy, thus increasing the amount of content.
---
Also when your frames go to shit haha
---
He‚Äôs saying the exact same thing you you just said. Don‚Äôt get why you calling him toxic.
---
We won't know the "best" ways until he is released. He seemed strong on PTB, so it's relatively likely he will see some change when released--we just don't know how yet. So until we see the final Oni product we won't know how to "counter" him
---
I watched a bit of Noob3, but mostly his Gen rush video. How is it playing Killer? Haven‚Äôt even touched any yet, Survivor just seems to fit me, and the idea of being the Killer just seems impossible
---
Kinda fucked up atm i get instand killer games but have to wait 2mins for survivor games.
---
I've never had a cult of 4, but I did have 2 in my game once, as killer. Was the funniest thing ever. I played wraith and as we circled the basement hook I binged and bonged In time with their tea bags. Was truly beautiful.
---
Content does not equal balanced lobbies.
---
huh
---
its dedicated servers being fucky, just face walls and be extra careful till its fixed
---
He‚Äôs saying ebony mori and skeleton keys are op.

Well yeah but this is all just how you could be saved in two different hooks after you got downed

With actual GOOD killers its the ones who click flashlights or tbag for no other reason than to be an asshole (I understand the tactic of trying to get a killer to chase you for ACTUAL gameplay reasons I.e. the person they are chasing is on their last hook) that get the mori

Power of SWF is overrated. I usually wreck SWF teams because they're overly altruistic.

Players like tru3ta1ent love to throw around the word toxic when survivors just want to play with their buds.

This meme started in the last couple of hours.

I browse new.

Mine got deleten in a minute. I saw others getting deleted which I haven't seen before.  
---
I was looking up the dbd mod and saw he deleted at least 10 of them all unique survivors or killers. 
---
I saved them all with usernames. Got 9 so far.  
---
If a mod bans everything he doesnt think is funny with the reason "oversaturated content" (although it hasn't even started yet) thats abuse of mod power to me. 
---
But tell me to get our more. You are so kind.
---
people play her differently then this?
---
Not in a chase, but say if you're unsure of which of the double pallets is real or not
---
To answer your question: to show others that they're assholes I guess
---
I mean, technically it does counter.   
---
On a serious note there is no actual counter to a mori aside from the killer being extra bad at the game
---
EW3 Lunge would be bs,if you didn't earn it. Freddy's lunge however is bs, feels like EW3 without the 1 hit down.
---
I agree lol
---
Doesn't the killer get a penalty for facecamping? You could build off of that.
---
It's not a fully thought out idea, but if the Entity moves the killer after the penalty reaches a certain amount, at least before the gates are powered/EGC?
---
Let's say a survivor's being camped and no one has come for the save(hopefully because they're doing gens) and the penalty starts kicking in. The larger the penalty grows, the more the Entity grows impatient with the killer for not at least trying to find other survivors and the screen starts to change. Once the Entity's had enough it warps the killer and places them elsewhere on the map, not too far, but not close enough for them to return 3 seconds later either. 
---
The only way for the killer to return the screen to normal before the Entity warps them is to leave the survivor. Chasing another survivor will return the screen to normal faster.
---
If the killer returns to camp the hook before the screen is back to normal and the penalty kicks in again, they'll be camping for a shorter time before the Entity warps them.
---
We haven't seen the Entity affect the killers negatively in game before, but we know it's pleased when the killer shows more effort since that's how we pip. Plus, I've always imagined the Entity as more of a neutral evil that chooses not to harm killers only because they do what it wants them to.
---
Again, this idea isn't completely thought out, but I think it has promise. Thoughts?
---
You're not wrong. But it's literally. Only. Trapper. They could at least do any other non-DLC killer. That's 3 tomes in a row where the only killer specific challenges have been Bear Trap Boi.
---
Farm time lol
---
Bubba for BBQ and chilly that will help you gain BP
---
And I‚Äôm referring to all kill points you get in the game, but nice try, you‚Äôre not wiggling out of your inaccuracy.
---
Doing gens is the Main objective but dont get pissed if the killer got NOED tand tell you to do bones instead of "gen rushing". And no just because you cleansed 1 or 2 totems dosent mean it will go away, you need to get rid all of them
---
Yeah but don't they have it now, which is why they have the original costumes?
---
Spirit, bubba, myers
---
"If i DoNt LikE A mEme nO oNe sHouLd hAve fUn WiTh iT"
---
It‚Äôs an offering. There are three different rarities.
---
Uncommon (Cyprus) Kill the last survivor by your hand
---
Rare (Ivory) Kill a single survivor if you have hooked them before
---
Ultra Rare (Ebony) Kill all survivors if you have hooked them before.
---
There are some perks that let you Mori, like Rancor and Hex: Devour Hope, and The Shape has two add-ons that let him Mori a survivor while in tier 3.
---
Perhaps something like gen regression or keeping generators from completing? With a stack system that requires the killer to earn their NOED, they could also remove the totem requirement.
---
Because 'Killed' is its own thing. Like Sacrificed is. Killed also happens when a Survivor bleeds out or Dies to The Pigs Reverse Bear Trap.
---
It's ok
---
yeah you're just further proving my point with this lmfao

Flashlights are literally given to survivors..... *to use* Sarcastic butt head. Be nice
---
Camping isnt given to killers *to use*
---
Tunneling thats a different story. As a survivor main 60/40 to killer .. tunneling is apart of the game. Killers camping is not. Thats just a cheap tactic for those who cant play a simple game of die and seak
---
Right? 
---
Shouldn't they be happy about it as well?
---
It only lasts a couple of days anyways.
---
Ohh
---
I want it right now
---
That‚Äôs because the tome or whatever it is is focused on trapper and claudette
---
I'm not saying it's toxic to use flashlight. Same as tinneling. Both are viable in-game mechanics. But let's be honest: we all know that both piss off some people. And if you annoy people, I hope you won't be surprised when they try to stop that annoyance. Makes sense?
---
Tough guy
---
So is the mori
---
I use Corrupt Intervention, Thanataphobia, Dying Light and Pop Goes the Weasel on Plague.
---
Ruin is too hit or miss for me. True it can last a whole match, but also get cleansed within the 1st minute of the match. So I use Corrupt Intervention to block the furthest 3 gens for 2 minutes instead. So this way they'll need to get closer to me to do gens at the start of the game.
---
Thanataphobia slows down the game by giving survivors a choice, cleanse and give me the option to use Corrupt Purge or stay infected and broken. Which means Thanataphobia slows gen progress and they are then in a one hit down state until they cleanse. Get all 4 survivors broken and that's 16% slow down progress.
---
Dying Light works well with Thanataphobia. Especially as with Plague, you're going to go round infecting people and putting them into broken. So the Obsession doesn't get to use the healing bonus they'd get from Dying Light. So if you get to the stage where all 4 survivors are broken and you've hooked someone other than the Obsession at least once, that's 19% gen slow down progress which brings me onto the final perk I use.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel let's you knock back generator progress by 30% after you hook someone. It's also one of my personal favourite perks. I just love using this perk to knock back a generator that was close to completion.
---
The way I use this build is the 1st two minutes of the game I look at the unblocked gens 1st and infect them. Whilst keeping an eye on the survivors to see if anyone is infected due to them working on a gen.
---
I also try and avoid going to pools to get Corrupt Purge. I focus on only using Plague's Vile Purge. If I'm near a corrupted pool or feel like I'm in control of the game, I'll go for one but I won't go out of my way for one. That and if all if the pools get used, I get Corrupt without even trying.
---
The cycle I usually do is, infect objects/survivors, hook someone and then go to a gen to use Pop on it. Whilst also listening out for gens being worked on. If the gen sounds like it's close to completion and I have Pop, I'll give it a smack. Or if i saw a survivor as i was going to the gen, I'll smack the gen and then go after the survivor. Whilst being sure to use Vile Purge on it.
---
As the game goes on, I'll keep a mental note as to which gens I've used Vile Purge on. If I see someone get infected and not via a hook rescue, I'll go to the gens that I've infected to look for survivors.
---
Should it make it to the End Game Collapse and there is only one survivor left and I've closed the hatch. I'll usually go to the nearest Exit gate and use Vile Purge on it. As I'm going to the other Exit gate, if the last survivor isn't broken, I'll look to see if they become infected. If this happens, I know straight away which Exit gate they're at.
---
I'll finish this by saying it's all well and good reading about builds. But the best way to learn the Plague or any killer is to practice and find what works for you. Also thanks for reading this and I'll see you in the fog
---
wow thats a huge problem
---
They should fix Freddys face while they are at it...classic nancy and classic Freddy.
---
What does breakout do again?
---
Oh big time. I would lower the tantrum stun time across the board, make it to where he doesn't slow down while revving up the chainsaw cause he doesn't go as fast as Hillbilly does (so it makes sense that Billy slows down for balance). Or if Bubba would still be slowed while revving make it to where every time he hits a survivor with the saw the chainsaw rush's time limit resets to help him accelerate longer and make it easier to hit more than one survivor.
---
Last I checked you don't get to set in stone what someone's intention or meaning was. What you are referring to is not what I was referring to in *my* comment.
---
He's cute god damn.
---
in all fairness, just because it is popular does not mean it is correct.
---
i used to be the farming type when someone dc'd but have noticed that 9 times out of 10 the killer will kill you any way so i said fuck it.... if im playing killer i kill everyone regardless of dc's. sometimes and i mean very seldom will i give the last surv the hatch or gate if their teammates are being absolute dirtbags to them
---
This was very eye opening for me! Truly appreciate the info! I'll be taking it all to heart and applying it here soon after work!
---
but an ebony mori is also part of the game
---
&gt;  the purple insta-heal has been reworked into a sort of poor man's Borrowed Time effect.

Really? For me its like 2 min survivor wait, and 5 min killer wait. :/
---
You‚Äôre in luck! I posted the next four a couple hours ago!
---
Wolverine I see
---
For newer players, weekdays take a little bit longer because of your rank. You start at Rank 20, so they try to match you up with similar ranked players. People cannot go down a rank from 15-20 if I remember correctly, so there's always less players in the lower rank.
---
Don't even think about queuing for Killer because those take even longer. You'll have better luck with Survivor Queue
---
As a survivor I'd be wary about using items until you can reliably ensure that you're *not* the first survivor found *and* can reliably hit skill checks. Bear in mind that items are magnets for killers - if they see you with a toolbox or a key then you're going to be assured of their attention.
---
For killers, I'd strongly encourage you to read up on add-on effects before you start using them - some killers are heavily reliant on them, for other killers the wrong-add will actually cripple them.
---
Bloodpoint Offerings can safely be used whenever you get them - there's no real benefit to sitting on them, because all Offering-based Bloodpoint bonuses are applied based on your values at the end of the game. If there's a double or triple Bloodpoint event then that *still* only applies to your totals at the end of the game. You may as well use them when you get them.
---
Map Offerings... really depend on the map and your build. Some maps are very good for killers, some are great for killers, and some really need a very specific build in order to take advantage of them. I'd say sit on the Map Offerings while freely using the Bloodpoint ones.

---
...If anyone is playing tough it's you
---
Still here enjoying this?
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse'sCalling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
They‚Äôre not bullshit things, fundamentals to the game.
---
Run spine chill. I‚Äôm never found first even by stealth killers. I can hop on a gen without worrying. Spine chill lights up and I walk away. They waste time searching all over while I‚Äôm already on another gen. Rinse and repeat.
---
Which of them?
---
I for one acknowledge that flashlights aren‚Äôt inherently toxic, but they‚Äôre annoying. If I‚Äôm not doing well and I know there‚Äôs a flashlight on the team, I will tunnel them because they are directly affecting my performance in the game. I won‚Äôt ignore everyone else, but if I‚Äôm chasing someone and I see someone else who has a flashlight and they‚Äôve used it competently on me, I‚Äôll go for them.  
---
Also if I see at least three flashlights in lobby I‚Äôll switch a perk out with Franklin‚Äôs Demise.
---
You wouldn't. If you wanted a perk to help your team in a situation where everyone has been slugged, you'd use Unbreakable, because 1. The killer doesn't get any notification you have it 2. You'll almost never need two uses in a game unless you've misplayed horribly 3. Being able to recover faster can help you get picked up more easily if someone is around to help, saving your one solo-heal for when it's needed.
---
No Mither ***can*** be used with other perks like Resilience, This is not Happening, and Iron Will/Tenacity, but it's not going to consistently win you games in the same way Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, or Borrowed Time will.
---
Depends which platform, ps4 is pretty instant for killer but you gotta wait 5+ min for a survivor game
---
Last I checked, you said ‚Äúkill points‚Äù which are clearly defined in the game as point you get for kills/sacrifices. You get 2 sets of kill points in your example, and you failed to account for them to make it look as though the killer was more disadvantaged than they actually are in terms of point accumulation.
---
Your intention was to mislead and not represent the facts accordingly. Those facts being, yes, you still get kill points in a game where only 2 survivors are left and escape with a key.
---
On Xbox you can gift people DLCs and in pretty sure auric cells as well. Not sut eon PS4 and as an other person said, you can gift them on PC.
---
Dream pallet freddy is already useless because snares are better and dont need an add on.
---
Not gonna lie, your first few killer games usually go pretty poorly. It's a bit more mechanically intensive, but I found it very enjoyable once I got past the learning curve. I get if it's not your thing, though. I will say that playing a few killer games will for certain make you a better survivor (and visa-versa). I mentioned other channels, but Scott Jund (ex-huntress main; still streams killer fairly often) has a couple quick and generic guides on killer. Even if you don't go that route, I hope you find fun in the game!
---
For the survivor the best order is probably:
---
1) David King until you unlock the perk We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever, so that way you can get bloodpoints faster.
---
2) Claudette for Self-care, so you can heal yourself.
---
3) Meg for Sprint Burst. Adrenaline is a must have perk as well.
---
Then I would go for Dwight for Bond and Jake for Iron Will, those are two great perks. I use Bond over Self Care, but self care could be good for someone who‚Äôs just staring out and learning the game.

I think I would worry more as killer than survivor, it‚Äôs just too much to take care of at once for me. Do you know where I can find guides to counter killers? Me being the idiot I am stared at Micheal Myers thinking he worked like Ghost Face
---
No one talking about the increased wiggle speed perk but talking about the near useless reset pallet perk. nice
---
Never, nobody cares about him and he also have no costumes.
---
this game can have some wholesome moments.
---
It‚Äôs the opposite for me. Idk about you but on PS4 (purple/red ranks) I can get into a match as killer in less than a minute.
---
Bragging rights I guess? I like making killers DC the sporting way; by looping them smartly for half an hour
---
I don't t bag or use flashlights or decisive and the only injury I inflict is when I slam a pallet on your head
---
Still, I get much, much more pleasure when I make a killer pointedly ignore me for the rest of the match (cause he knows he isn't gonna hit me)
---
what perk is that where it has the 3 people screaming? that's the one where if you down somebody other survivors auras are shown, right? i just dont know the name or whose perk it is

I am honestly surprised how fast the trend took off. I was like the 4th person to do it. Great artwork anyway mate!

It's Infectious Fright and it belongs to the Plague. Anyone in your terror radius when a survivor goes down screams and reveals their location.

Of all the artwork I‚Äôve seen on Reddit, this is one of like three that I actually thought was good and original

How so? While face camping is probably bad strategy, proxy camping can easily win games against altruistic SWF.

Freddy, Billy and Huntress are the 3 worst examples I can think of tbh. Freddy has become stretch armstrong, billy chainsaws you when you juke behind him or even often around walls/through corners, etc and Huntress hits from 2-5 pallet distance away and while you're out of line of sight a second ago. I preferred the game prior to dedicated servers, tbh. They rolled them out way too quickly. They're fucking dogshit.
---
Still gonna report these low effort shit posts. Don‚Äôt need em filling up my feed üòä
---
Prob depends on rank im not sure :/ not that many people enjoy playing killer at rank 1. Its painful sometimes
---
this is actually adorable i love it
---
I can understand bragging if you loop and trick the killer, but blinding a killer and being toxic just automatically makes me take away all praise .
---
Did the dweet t bag/flashlight click, if so not a true dweet.
---
No gates must be opened while using the perk, they can escape by hatch or die (doesn't matter)
---
Use perk &gt; Don‚Äôt let anybody open either exit gate. 
---
That‚Äôs it.
---
Replace wraith with Freddy
---
This was something I dont know anymore but it was something
---
Nah hot Quentin stays... old Freddy is ok, but  Freddy might like the new toy instead of Nancy.
---
Most people don‚Äôt enjoy farming. It‚Äôs pretty boring.
---
That‚Äôs an odd imbalance indeed. PC user here. 
---
Of all the stats we‚Äôve been given, one I would like to see if how often users play survivor vs. killer, but that‚Äôll only start more arguments I fear.
---
This has nothing to do with swf really but since we are ok the topic of what makes people salty...:
---
I was playing trapper, of all killers, and was accused of "camping gens" on badham preschool. Get this. One of the gens left was in the basement if the school. One was in the top floor of a house, the one-man gen. And the other was all the way across the map by killer shack. Please tell me how I camped? I went around to all of them looking for the survivors, and kicked the gens in the process. I DID NOT STAY at any of them! I always left after kicking and i wasnt constantly checking behind me to see if they came back to the gen.
---
These 2 survivors that were still alive were the saltiest fish in the sea and called me horrible names, and I did nothing wrong except kill them I guess.
---
Made them angrier when I said they were killed by a girl &lt;3
---
The mask is hilarious
---
I most definitely agree (I play both sides equally, so I've been tunneled/camped and t bagged and been assaulted by an angry horde of flashlight clicks)
---
y‚Äôall are so bitter. you can loop the killer the whole game and still go down. you can get saved at the last minute and if you get hit again you‚Äôre dead. that‚Äôs literally the point of mori. to eliminate the need to loop multiple times. that‚Äôs what makes it OP. if you guys think teammates are running around making flashlight saves for every pickup every single game so that no one gets hooked even once, idk what rank you‚Äôre playing at cause it‚Äôs not 1.
---
Not *given* 
---
Did the game say "here's a flashlight - used to blind the killer" 
---
Yup
---
Did the game say "heres how to play killer - hang any survivor on the hook, look them elin the eyes and watch them until they die"
---
So not *given*
---
Every time i see babylonian era or something related i can only think fgo
---
"Let me bring my flashlight but you can't bring your mori"... lul
---
Oooooooohhhhhhh, ...why can i see this actually happening?
---
Facecamping during endgame isn't toxic
---
Or carry you while in dying state to the hatch drop you by it only to close it üòê
---
*clears throat* "yOu dOnt nEeD to eScApE eVeRy gAmE"

They could simply make it only available in the newer first slot where you can choose a whole costume. Easy solution.
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry about that man, but if you‚Äôre aware that this meme has already been made and posted why are you posting this? You can‚Äôt complain about mods deleting over saturated content while you‚Äôre deliberately rehashing content yourself. Just makes you look like you‚Äôre covering for your own lack of effort.
---
Ghostface's add-ons are pretty good, especially the power recovery.

Yes, and they are almost completely faded.
---
Because getting hit 1second after turning a corner, fast vaulting, landing the pallet stun, etc is very fun. :\^)
---
The description is on point "any" means it doesnt matter wich one to me. I just lost 2 hours trying to figure this out. I even tryed to be friendly with the survivors. But the answer is i only have to slaughter them lol. Time for some nasty hagplays i guess

Just got back into the game since my internet was switched from Ethernet to wireless and now back to Ethernet. Every time I boot up the game, my first one or two skill checks just don‚Äôt register any input. I remember it doing this even before taking a break, anyone have an idea what may be causing it? I‚Äôm guessing just generic lag but it‚Äôs so consistent

Awwww what a cute lil bebe.

I was not aware that the wraith patrick meme was posted before. I was aware that the invisible wraith is not original enough for some people.

I didn't know this was a tech subreddit
---
Did you do it with or without milk?

This is really good!
---
Gotta get that footage for their 2 subscribers on youtube
---
In my opinion, they still need to make it so that you can complete multiple challenges within a single match. Even if players could only select say, 3, or something. Otherwise, this is too much of a grind for me with too little reward.
---
&gt;Free? I doubt it.
---
Its happening... Along side Golden Feng and most of the exclusive cosmetics.
---
Or maybe not everyone is a grammar nazi like you, and again, you don't get to decide other people's intentions.
---
thank fuck
---
It doesn't matter if flashlight is normal in game mechanics. If killers find it annoying, they will brand you annoying and will work to eliminate you sooner by employing equally normal and equally annoying in game mechanics: proxy camping and tunneling.
---
didnt expect to see a balding leatherface main on my feed. he seems mald. kappa
---
Why is nea a redhead lol.
---
C H O N K Y just like ghostface new original costume
---
Using one flashlight to save someone is not toxic.
---
Having three people in your SWF come out with flashlights and blind to save is just being an asshole.
---
Yes, the incorrect description fooled me in the beginning too. Have happy slaughter!
---
Kindred o.o
---
Me playing red rank nurse on ps4
---
I don't see a problem in that, if the SWF group destroyed a perkless trapper, the only thing that is going to happen is the trapper deranking to a group, where there is less hardcore SWF groups (there is circa 4% 4 man SWF groups btw) and the survivors would rank up to a group against killers that have a higher chance to fight them off. The problem is that the ranking system of DbD is pure cancer and adding salt to the wound the MM probably ends up being even worse. In conclusion, I don't think trying hard as a group of survivors is that bad since the MM should match them with equally sweaty killers. The problem is in the fact that beHavior are terrible at managing this part of the game.
---
Ty mate i will eat their souls

Does no mither work with this is not happening?

---
Oh that might explain it then, im a rank 20 killer
---
It‚Äôs been a year, still amazing with Doc.
---
I feel like that adds to the problem.
---
Being toxic because they are toxic just makes the game more toxic.
---
Mcote personally reached out to the actor and from what it sounded like, they were gonna work to get his face redone!
---
I hate to agree with you, but if you get 30 downvotes on a reply, the most of reddit will just start downvoting you because everyone else is doing it, and it‚Äôs hard to lead and easy to follow in life, which is big dumb
---
A disclaimer, I haven't watched them all  because I play killer and am aware how to counter them because it's how I lose :p but TydeTyme, PainReliever, and Monto all have individual killer counter guides. I haven't watched much PR, but I've watched the other two and they know the game really well.
---
Less about grammar and more about context ;)
---
You wrote something with misleading context and were corrected because you purposefully left out important information. You indicated the killer gets no kill points in your example, and that‚Äôs simply not the truth.
---
Can I buy these and if so how much
---
If you stand right at the exit gate and they hit you you fall directly into the gate but I understand running the risk of not getting quite close enough.
---
Now thats BS, a decent headset and a little game knowledge you will hear survivors and there locations just fine. Grunts do indeed allow you to precisely and quickly pinpoint a survivors location, hell footsteps give you enough of a queue to pinpoint survivors.

---
Dead hard is unreliable, seeing as BL is being needed I'm gonna have to go back to Lithe
---
Why?
---
What if the killer was also going for the prestige and decided to use Moris on survivors that brought flashlights instead of on those that don't?
---
My state ID
---
My personal idea for another ds rework would be make it so that it deactivates when another survivor is hooked after you unhook, and is indefinite/like 90 seconds, idk which would be better imo.
---
So he should miss out. Two survivors didn‚Äôt die, managed to get enough gens running and coordinated together to escape. They should be rewarded. 
---
As for him though, he still gets kill points for the other kills in the game he managed to get.
---
Damn that's clever. I did it with Hag and just trapped the shit out of the basement, your way sounds more fun.

Does the new change to Myers (giving him Undetectable in Tier 1) mean he doesn‚Äôt need monitor and abuse to have a zero terror radius in tier 1?
---
dont listen to them about the bloodweb. after each prestige you have a small (but higher than usual) chance of getting higher tier perks in their. i speak from experience. i have been feeding my ps4 clauddy and after the second prestige i was getting pink and purple stuff after level 5. the only issue with that is you are spending more bp per item just to get those earlier on
---
'He should miss out' because survivors got lucky and found an item in their bloodweb / chest? If you've fucked up this badly and still have 2 gens with 2 people dead, you've lost and don't deserve an RNG cop-out win. The same goes for moris.
---
Yes? I don't know, everyone seems to think it's a huge deal that survivors don't cleanse, so I assume that means survivors find it better to face her M1 as a broken player than face her range damage at full health, which suggests to me that most plague players aren't very good at chases.

---
I had a survivor DC because of my "oP bUilD", it was pretty funny they got so tilted over a rather niche build.
---
The problem is that the core gameplay was designed around survivors not having the ability to communicate well. They were meant to be relatively disorganized and limited in their strategy. The survivors lack of structure was the linch-pin that made killers effective. It‚Äôs what balanced the experience. Whether the killer is fully upgraded or not doesn‚Äôt change much of anything (outside of certain exceptions like Billy) because their kits and gameplay were not designed with the communication capabilities survivors have now. 
---
Whether Trapper or Hag or Pig or any other crap killer is fully upgraded or not they still suck shit against an organized group because communication dunks on them that hard. 
---
You can‚Äôt design a game around a lack of communication and then add communication. Rank cannot be blamed for the biggest problem that this game has. They completely screwed up by putting SWF in the game because they didn‚Äôt adjust the gameplay for it.
---
It‚Äôs like making a medieval sword fighting game and then letting someone have a machine gun.

Dude seriously fuck off with your argument. It was pretty obvious that he meant from the two alive survivors, and people who take things this literally are just making fools out of themselves.

Gf. Joey's mask doesn't have a mouth, and the paint seems to have dripped down

Hate speech.. jesus christ man chill out. Some kids from different part of the world are insulting you. So what? God damn everyone is so sensitive these days. Like 5 years ago you could offend each other and vice versa, say fuck tou other says fuck you too dipshit then go about your day because its really not a problem you should be thinking about. Now because of all of these communities that are looking for a problem where there is none, everything is fucking offensive. I cant even say u gai anymore because I might face jail time.

It's so cringe and it pisses me off that there is no real way to counter it. I report people, but strongly feel it dosen't do shit. I would like to see the Devs address this type of chat the way they adressed DC's.

But it started with an ***AD MORTEM INIMICUS***
---
Yeah that went from 0-100 with the quickness.
---
Yes draining 6 cumulative seconds of flashlight time to do something that is easily dont with a third of that time is good team work. You dont need more than one flashlight to blind the killer. They are picking someone up they cant look away, and it's very hard to miss that blind.
---
Wait so the chapter launches tomorrow?
---
Had a game the other day against a Freddy with three other solo survs. We did fairly well, I got rid of all five totems with small game and could easily tell which pallets were fake and which were real, so I got rid of some of the fake ones to help my team out. I also ran away from him for a bit and managed to pallet-stun him a grand total of two, maybe three times over the course of the whole match. In short: I don't think I did anything super horrible to him. But alas, mere seconds before the last gen pops, he downs me and hooks me for the first time in the basement. And then he facecamped me. I think the others somehow caught wind of that (or they were cowards lol), opened the gates and left. He kept hitting me through both stage one and two on hook. Laughed my ass off but please don't be that guy.
---
Why is it always Ghostface who plays along?
---
This mentality is so toxic and is the reason theres such a great divide between killer and survivor players. Cant i just have fun with my friends and not be toxic? Why is swf inherently toxic
---
What are you talking about... I steamroll with Freddy...on ps4üòÖ
---
Spirit or wait until tomorrow for Oni.
---
But we need more of *INCREDIBILIS*
---
Yes, it's 16 meters 10 seconds after hooking. That's what the game measures.
---
I find that all too often, I watch the killer give hatch or gate to someone who didn't do a damn thing, and if what you're doing is assuming the people who actually went for saves, actually did gens, actually participated in the game, and didn't blend around the map playing immersed so the killer never cared about them, and are the reason we did far worse than we could have, was either A) not being toxic and playing "good" or B) now SWF, or that the rest of the group who WAS trying are SWF, you're absolutely wrong 99% of the time.
---
You're giving hatch to the person who was the MOST TOXIC and didn't fucking play properly at all. Chances are they were on comms the whole time and knew they could get away with not helping. The people who got in chases with you, looped, and saved, aren't toxic for actually playing.
---
The killer mains on this subreddit has such an absurd view of what survivor is like. I really wish you guys would spend some time playing the rest of the game.
---
I am very much thinking you are presuming his intentions, I didn‚Äôt even pay them much mind
---
&gt;Considering the majority of rank 1‚Äôs in my region play like rank 15‚Äôs then yea. 
---
That's really interesting. What region? In whatever region US East plays on there is a pretty big difference. I've done 20 through 1 on both killer and survivor after not playing for months and 20-10 is significantly easier than 10-1, for both sides. I generally do meme builds and stuff just to keep it interesting until rank 5ish, at which point I have trouble ranking without playing a killer I'm decent with.
---
Haha yes, l , m , n ebony mori ,skeleton key
---
i know it's a joke but i would legitimately love to play that game
---
Ok so maybe not the NEXT killer but itll happen.... maybe idk lmao
---
Careful! If you accept it it will complete the challenge! I am saving bloodpoints for tomorrow and accidentally claimed one of these
---
So what exactly is the counter to a Skeleton Key?
---
Curious, how could you make keys a non issue as killer? With the exception of slugging, but nobody likes to slug I'd assume.
---
Read the announcement when you first open DBD
---
Nah its ok, i have to go through the middle somehow
---
Hag is really good, but takes alot of practice, and alot of people don't have fun as her or against her. I like her, though. But alot don't. Plauge is the same, good if you know what you're doing, but a little lower on the fun scale.
---
lol
---
So the person who asked the question know what the offering does and how to activate since he asked what‚Äôs a mori
---
Can u send me the original Patrick pretty plez
---
I wanted Save baby dwight but he kept resisting and then DCed:(
---
Are you planning on selling? Cause I'll be buying.
---
Fingers crossed not for much longer in that form. That shit is broken.
---
Exactly. If you have three Generators in a really bad spot and the killer can sit there and watch all of them from one spot the survivors fault for letting that happen. Instead someone can get sacrificed and everyone can escape the hatch instead of accepting that they made a massive mistake.
---
Sad as fuck

OCE region. But after watching European and American streamers/YouTubers, the majority of what I see there is also quite shitty. It‚Äôs quite easy around here to get to high ranks with no perks, items/add ons or offerings. I went from low ranks to rank 8 on killer with nothing before I struggled and started with perks (was doing a challenge to see how long it took to get to 1 mil bloodpoints with nothing)
---
I would‚Äôve liked a cosmetic for Claudette that gave her pig tails and a party hat, would‚Äôve been cute. A trapper cosmetic with him wearing a fur bear coat would‚Äôve been awesome as well. I‚Äôm guessing that they wanted to focus on them through charms rather than typical cosmetics , as that is the brand new thing they introduced. 
---
Once we have a large amount of charms I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll give more cosmetics for completing the archives.
---
Horn is part of my car. Should I just permanently stick it in the On position? For safety reasons...

Oh snap! But for real. I was obviously being blunt in a sarcastic matter which evidently set him off

How are you going to trap someone 5 different times?
---
A mori will also cheat the killer out of BP. Deleting a survivor means you dont get points for Hooks.
---
You are an ignorant privileged idiot who does not understand that homophobia is real and LGBTQ people are killed and beat up and discriminated against every day. It‚Äôs not that we are too sensitive....it‚Äôs that we are tired of your shit. And we aren‚Äôt going to be quiet about it anymore. You‚Äôre just another asshole that you can‚Äôt see how language is offensive to people and means something.
---
Y tho
---
This isn't what you should expect from dedicated servers. Likely just a killer with a shitty connection
---
i know i‚Äôm aware not complaining it helps me have more insight on the situation too which is nice
---
It‚Äôs a team game for survivors, and you can do great while your team does horrible, and it doesn‚Äôt mean YOU should get an auto loss just because of it. 
---
Also let‚Äôs see...
---
IF they survived that long and IF they got enough gens up and IF they manage to find the hatch before the killer and IF they are able to communicate with each other to get out together? That‚Äôs IF they‚Äôre even communicating, in which case there‚Äôs also the IF the killer doesn‚Äôt close the hatch before both jump in, assuming they‚Äôre separated. 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs pretty deserving of an escape, plain and simple.

Lmao bro their gonna downvote you just for saying thatüíÄ
---
Taking a guess they'll leave the fix for his rework if it ever happens any time soon. Will be interesting to see how the community reacts to it once it starts getting big.
---
I bring moris for survivors that are really good. Your awesome at looping and are making me really sweat? Mori. Your 360ing like a mad beast? Mori. Ttv? Mori. Moris should he compliments to your skill as a survivor. The killer needed you gone so bad that they are willing to cut their own points short for it.
---
I only have 8160 shards right now :(
---
I thought the better totem placements would encourage red rank survivors to learn how to hit ruin skillchecks. I was wrong.
---
There will always be useless complaints from both sides anyway, couldn't care less and doesn't alter my point.
---
Not true, destroy the safe pallets, mindgame the unsafe pallets, if you never try to mindgame pallets and just run into it. You gonna lose.
---
It really depends on where it's directed. If you're toxic to the people toxic to you, that's just karma biting them in the ass. If you're toxic to completely unrelated people, then it's perpetuating the toxic cycle.
---
EGC is 100% a survivor issue.
---
If you 99% the gates but DON'T open them, you have as much time as you need to save a teammate.
---
Hatch is fine because it's equal chance to whoever gets to it first. 
---
Another aspect of it is simply that a lot of Survivor mains are either incredibly selfish or just very bad at the game regardless of what they think.
---
They've tried numerous times through perks, BP, and emblems to encourage teamwork but a good portion of the playerbase still prefers to be asahats to each other.
---
As far as matchmaking, Rank 20 Killers dealt with 3 Red Ranks with 1 Rank 20 in a SWF for YEARS.
---
The current change has only been active a few months. Complaining about Survivors dealing with it after Killers dealt with it for years is silly.
---
They've already announced they plan to re-work some op add-ons. Spirit Prayer Beads are getting nerfed in the next update for example. Just as Survivor insta-heals which were OP just got nerfed. 
---
As a Survivor main who also plays Killer, the only issue I have is being paired with bad teammates.
---
Survivors who dc the second they get downed, farm other survivors off hooks in front of the killer, hide all match and refuse to help do gens if ruin is up (or in general), survivors who can't last more than 3 seconds everytime the killer finds them, Survivors who use Empathy or Bond to purposely run a killer to you everytime or open a locker you're in, in front of a killer on purpose, etc.
---
That's why playing Survivor can be unfun and make it very Killer favored. 
---
When you get paired with actual GOOD teammates (not even on mics), the match can easily becomes Survivor favored by landslides.
---
Just play how you want. You're going to get bitched at regardless. The salt flows readily in this game.

Any update or word on fixing the bug that causes survivors or killer to randomly disconnect?

honest question : does the report system even work? do they pay attention to any reports?
---
But how long you been there dweet.
---
I remember once at the beginning of a match a Freddy patrolled one area of the map like five times even though those gens weren‚Äôt even being worked on and then we realized 3 gens were like five meters from each other and we had to rush one of them
---
gooed meme but idk what is about help
---
it helps you get it faster if you sing your abc's wierd
---
Or just 99% the gates and DON'T open them until after you save. You have all the time in the world if you don't actually open them.
---
All you need is a tap when you save and you all rush out if you just 99 them.
---
Alright. Thank you

It‚Äôs weird seeing doctor not have wide open eyes

No, the classic isn‚Äôt from the film it‚Äôs from Fun World.

Tbh with the weird timing, I'm finding it hard to buy they didn't see this being a future prob with Oni being dropped.
---
Approach loop. If they attempt the loop, put snare down one way, force them to run the other way. They hit the snare and dont make the pallet. Free hit.

If they dont attempt loop and throw pallets immediately, you get pallets down for free.
---
Repeat.
---
I‚Äôm standing by my point in that the comment I replied to was inaccurate and misleading. 
---
You are free to disagree if you like, but I doubt you believe it‚Äôs ‚Äúmaking a lot of nothing‚Äù considering the manner in which you first replied, and your continued replies thus far. 
---
One could argue you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúmaking a lot out of nothing‚Äù is another trap to end the discussion (which in this case is more of an argument when it comes to the other replies I‚Äôve gotten). I do not concede that my point was invalid or unwarranted, and I will stand by it.

It‚Äôs Susie

^why ^do ^I ^feel ^like ^I‚Äôm ^about ^to ^be ^whooshed?
---
and yet when they don't escape, they accuse you of everything under the sun.
---
Apparently the only correct thing to these people is if they survive. No wonder why killers bring NoED to games rofl
---
I figured it was GF especially since the creator is called Adept Ghost face
---
Technician silencing a failed skill check.
---
Being new to the game, i wasn't aware. Bioshock being my favourite game, i like the idea alot
---
Im guessing they thought this was gonna be an easy bully party
---
What's you get the info? Lmao
---
true but hitting hooked survivor is
---
Who said I was confused? And who cares about DC'ing. Tunneling killers, especially Spirit, will ALWAYS get a DC. Now give me my downvote and leave me in peace.
---
Did you eat all the other survivors?  Your survivor looks like triggly puff
---
Im rank 16 and my friend is rank 5, its always fun to play together, and we arnt tryhards its just nice to cjill with friends and mess around.
---
It‚Äôs Amanda‚Äôs room in the game map
---
I never claimed you owned the game beforehand. I'm saying you should already know how long queue times are since you've been in this community for several months.
---
The game, we‚Äôre in Amanda‚Äôs room
---
At rank 11-20 it will make people DC so fast, it‚Äôs hilarious
---
not a problem
---
Was this from the original? I don't remember this girl being hooked but it's been a long time.
---
There's a reason i call them chodefaces
---
you‚Äôre the hero we didn‚Äôt deserve but the one we needed
---
I'd love to see this, but let the Patrick eyes shine through like a shitty furry outfit.
---
Well it‚Äôs definitely not today, chief. Also it‚Äôs tomorrow.
---
Dead hard, DS, BT, Adrenaline, Iron will
---
What is this even supposed to mean? Please don't try to tell me you're using Friday as an example of competitive play or as an example of how to balance etc etc.
---
Because Friday is one of THE most unbalanced, bug ridden and UNcompetitive games ever created. And this is coming from a backer of that game that played it exclusively since launch every single day until no more content was announced. 
---
That is literaly the worst example to compare anything to.
---
Did you know you can save 15% or more on car insurance by switching to Geico?
---
Oh wow that makes my problem so much better! Ill be sure to relay this to all the farmers i come across and let them know.
---
Thanks! :)
---
I can have a staring contest with the dude and I'll get Exposed before I break him out of power.
---
I'm hoping someone will compile every single one of them into an image and post it as "Dead By Patrick - Stupidity Is Not An Escape"
---
You're the apple to my blood soaked eye &lt;3
---
That was exactly what I insistee with my comment lol. I agree.
---
Ghostface's only weakness, cultists.
---
Yeah I agree this -- depending on how you like to play, the best perks change. :)
---
My lineup right now is actually really similar OP! I run Adreneline, Self-Care, Spine Chill, and Lightweight... if I want to grind BP I take out Lightweight for WGLF
---
Not Otzdarva has a video on this and it goes pretty deep, I suggest watching it.
---
What? I cant see it.
---
Not a joke like I Genuinely cant see it.
---
Lol i have it i just like his Keanu Reeves wig
---
Just because it takes more time doesn‚Äôt mean botany is better than self care. What if you‚Äôre the only one left, or the killer is chasing the other survivor that‚Äôs in the trial while 2 are dead. What are you gonna do with botany then? Being solely self reliant makes it so people can separate and do gems faster, which wins games. Plus medkits dont give many heals, with self care you have infinite heals.
---
Waiting for a reply from one of the 4 little girls who ran in to downvote my post. Too busy with Kleenex and jergins to call me clown of the day or some other lq bullshit?  
---
Gg bb ez downvote killer mains
---
That's why the hatch exists in the first place, but the key is too far.
---
Baby legs clown best clown
---
Stitched Bag+Tar Bottle are my favs. Irridecent Stone is too much of a gamble for me being situational on timing.
---
I do like the spring that causes damage to those who disarm and the setting tools
---
IIRC the devs don't know. Its partly made up and part of a dead babylonian era language.
---
Ebony Mori: *No, I don't think I will.*

I haven't played the game in forever, what's proxy camping?
---
No you dipshit. I don't go around lobbies and insult people for your knowledge. You're actually the one who started throwing words around because you took a guess at me because I have an opinion about this. I'm talking about thrash talk to people. Not about LGBTQ or REAL homophobia you prick. No go and fuck off.
---
Oh I know, trust me. I don't want this game to become any goofier, just thought that sounded hilarious.
---
I hope so, that be rad. I heard the release time once since the PTB came down but I can't recall
---
I think keys are fun to use and mori's are cool to see....
---
I don't see a problem here. If you're referring to the ranks that you went up against then your title is correct. Anything within six ranks of you is how it is intended to work.
---
Very clever of you lol
---
Don't you fucking touch my bat, or I'll pull your teeth out every fucking day of the week
---
Now this is epic

ONE OF US

I agree I do message shitty teammates way more often I hate getting hooked after looping for five minutes and seeing a claud crouched against the wall and a bill running right at me justifying his immediate unhook with BT, my pet peeve on this sub though is when killer mains think it‚Äôs not okay to message a killer if they DCed like don‚Äôt be a pussy and just take the L or get a phat message saying gg ;) from me
---
Next month it's my turn to post this.
---
Would love to buy some
---
Same goes for when the terror radius starts to intensify and you get off the gen to avoid getting spotted
---
Main legion=respect
---
oh yeah i forgot it was the 2nd already lol
---
Has anyone listed those on here?  I'd love to know which can be completed by both sides.
---
Just long enough to avoid the crows
---
Then it's on to the next like your boy jay-z.  I got a million lockers to fit in.  Choose one.
---
That outfit reminds me of Kane from WWE.
---
Maybe BHVR can tell, but as a killer with lag I can tell you survs don‚Äôt know shit about lag switches. I suppose it should be obvious to an expert but I don‚Äôt know if BHVR has anyone like that
---
He‚Äôs looking at it
---
I check profiles each game.  SWFs (generally 2-3 man) are almost every game.  It's fairly rare (maybe one in 8) for me to get a match without some form of SWFs.
---
What is toxic gen rushing? Isn't the goal of the survivors to get the gens done as soon as possible? ü§î
---
Both
---
Lol ILY
---
was it hot? did you like watching?
---
Archive challenge? I did that to get that one and it worked :)
---
New game mode. Four survivors running to beat the shit out of the Killer. The killer has to do things to get away while working on things and not getting beat. Survivors get downed but not hooked. Survivors can pick themselves up as if they had no mither or unbreakable.
---
There already downvoting wow bro. Your the hero we need!
---
I wish everybody could get out of this "us vs them" mindset. This happens whether you're survivor or killer, no need to go into the comments and be like haha salty killer mains because it's just literally a thing people do not "mains" of a certain role.
---
Hm. That gave me an idea.
---
O h wow they want people that are barely into purple ranks to go against tank 1s? Thats kind of harsh.
---
Are there certain callouts for each map? It all just seems random to me. Obviously there is basement and there‚Äôs always a big house (most of the time), but I‚Äôll usually just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in basement‚Äù or ‚ÄúGo back to the first gen we did‚Äù, I don‚Äôt really use perks to communicate though.
---
Check out my other post about the Bioshock Chapter for the Killer idea. Personally I'm more proud of that lol
---
I apologized profusely after I finished the first 4k challenge, so I can only imagine how bad I‚Äôll feel completing the one you did. I felt so awful about being sweaty, but sweating your balls off is really the only way to complete that kind of challenge.
---
All I got for a reply so far was a "yikes" lol.  Lq dogshit killers at their finest, prob save the shit talking about me for a discord I can't reply to so their feelings stay safe.  Safe space lq crybaby killers show up Aids with their downvotes!
---
That'll show me!
---
Huh, I thought I had a daily to kill a survivor by any means as the doctor and the hook kills didn‚Äôt count
---
&gt;O h wow they want people that are barely into purple ranks to go against tank 1s? Thats kind of harsh.
---
If they make things more stricter than this, queue times will be even worse than already are. There will never be a solution to both issues (unfair matchmaking and queue times).
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

thank you for your support, I'm not losing my trust in people completely.
---
Oh no.
---
Oh no, he's cute.
---
Where from ???
---
So your just biased then?
---
It's almost always better to go directly for the guy you see sitting behind the tree, rather than pretend like you don't. Worst case scenario for doing it is he somehow unhooks the guy and gets away. Worst case scenario for not doing it is the other two survivors just finish the gens and leave.
---
I guess it never came to my attention
---
Dead Hard, Self Care, Spine Chill, Adrenaline/Lithe
---
What is this thread?ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Idea for key nerf!!
---
You have to open the hatch slowly with key charges, kinda like an exit gate, so you can still 99% it, but gives killer higher chance to not allow free wins.
---
It's leaked for the second Rift
