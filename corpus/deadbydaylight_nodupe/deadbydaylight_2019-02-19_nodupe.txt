so basically you're offering no solution and are telling people to throw games, lmao ok, does not apply to people trying to actually win so...
---
---
---
I think the funny part is you think people on this sub will disagree with the point you are making.
---
Thanks. A bloody Quentin would know XP
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
While speed is good about the spirit, remember that the loadout doesn't have prayer beads. A smart survivor would either hear the wooshing or tap the Thrill to make an alert and bait the killer. If you're in a chase while the totem is being cleansed, you won't be able to save it anyway. Unless you have 2 hex perks aside from it, it's really not worth it. Especially if both are found at the same time, it becomes a 50/50 shot of whether Ruin dies or not. 
---
No one thinks swf is fair or balanced on this sub.  *At best* people are willing to say they want to play with their friends because duh.
---
I have 243 Emergency med-kits. They are my babies :D
---
just put your controller down gently lol
---
That's fine cause most of the gaming industry is screwing PC anyway XD
---
Rarity is relevant. I do not care to continue arguing as our ideas of what a rare item should do differ greatly. 
---
I bared it for as long as I could. The lack of players at lower ranks was the final straw for me. I didn't mind the 30fps or the low res graphics as long as I could play. Once that became an issue, I bought on PC and won't be playing on this gen of consoles anymore. 
---
Boring ass video. 
---
Will always do this if I can but please don't throw a fit and I have to use the maze tile your gen is in.
---
Key is the only time the hatch ISN’T bullshit.
---
also actually buff it to apply to hooks, not the """Buff""" they did to apply to hook where you can still see where they get hooked
---
no
---
also these are really good ideas
---
Like legion?
---
Are u from tumblr
---
That’s your decision- you shouldn’t do that. If you’re going to use voice comms in a game designed to be played without them, don’t act like you’re less of a scumbag for saying you give mercy kills.
---
Interestingly one could argue for Amanda to be in all three of the middle tiers. She did doubt that people would change through John's tests, therefore rigging some tests in the movies. I would interprete that as gaining pleasure out of killing (but also for what she believes to be the greater "good"). This can also be interpreted as killing out of anger (for these "bad" people), and she also very much fits the description of killing out of insanity. I guess placing her in the middle is alright though, as her twisted sense of morality isn't quite the same as what doc is doing.
---
focusing on protecting gens is somehow degenerate? isn't that the killers objective? if the survivors 3 gen themselves whats a killer to do?
---
Trapper should be orange, he was a tyrant
---
"Everytime your obsession is hit you gain x/x/x on your lunge" "when you hit your obsession you lose x/x on your lunge" what???
---
That's just IMO. I just believe that hatch standoffs are just too small a problem to make a major change to gameplay.
---
how generic
---
Oink.
---
If you follow my Patreon page, you can see my other art news! https://www.patreon.com/mikaweiseth
---
when 2 survivors are left and 1 disconnects to give the other the hatch
---
Yea for survivors I despise shelter woods, The game, and Mt. Ormond. I hear Ormond is survivor favored but I still dislike it.
---
It’s not really an exploit but one time I smacked a pallet a bunch to make the last survivor think I was farming. Then I killed him 😂 
---
Before people yell at me, there was 1 gen left, he was injured, and I was feeling lazy 
---
Useless means without use. Tinkerer has its uses so it isnt useless. Exhaustion nerf isnt the same as the tinkerer change, because it took a good survivor to last until it activated twice, while tinkerer just made addons stronger. 
---
There are many better perks that are much more worth a perk slot for both sides, tinkerer isnt that bad. If they revered the CHANGE (stop calling it a nerf, it's a rework) they have to change how addons behave on some killers like freddy and spirit and legion to name a few.
---
New killer should be almost there, if I were you I would wait and compare
---
It really is. There was a great example on reddit with the pig walking around and on her end you dont see anyone! Just map some grass thats it. Then see the survivors pov of the same pig walking around and the survivor is standing in the path but about 2ft to the left and just watches her go by. Not crouched or hiding just there. 
---
I believe the baseline pov should be the ones with perks but then the perks would make it too large so they make the baseline reduced. 
---
yOu’Re jUsT tRyInG tO aVoId tHe bAn 
---
I had a guy message me telling me that it takes too many hooks to kill survivors so as a survivor, if the killer finds you, you should let him knock you and hook you instead of running away.
---
She has weakness. Stealth and gens.
---
If you remove all her vision, she loses all power. She doesn't know where to blink because she loses sight and scratches.
---
Honestly, all they need to do is limit the number of blinks and make a timer between blinks 
---
I was calling you a genius sardonically, that wasn't a compliment. lol
---
I think it's the line that starts the outside the map, even if the hitbox of your character touches it, it counts as escaped
---
I can confirm, I go to the bathroom once I leave my character there and when I'm back the end screen says Escaped
---
I don't know if this goes far enough to be considered as such but there is a rule against doxing somebody which is an instant perma-ban
---
Dude nswf flair 😜
---
New player here, I need to farm Bloodpoints and found mixed results, people suggest either Legion or Doctor.
---
Which one do you suggest is better or easier for farming Bloodpoints and what build is best for that purpose.
---
Dude wtf wow, how dare you try to kill the survivors??? They were running in circles because they needed your help getting the survivor off the hook. You're a big, strong killer after all
---
Probably just me and my non-killer main mindset thinking it’s annoying when someone is constantly saying the same things and only ever has one common viewpoint with me.  The devs should fix camping.
---
The lot had two entries they were looping thru. I'm totally confused why the other cop car didn't block one opening while the one chasing him could've stopped once he entered the lot and they woulda had'em trapped. Did I miss something cuz I've watched it twice and am still confuse. 
---
By timer I mean a power gauge; like a fully charged blink takes 50% of gauge, second one takes 25%. If you miss both you get exhausted, but have one more blink after. If you miss all 3 you have to wait till the gauge refills to blink again
---
Yeah the lag can be ridiculous.
---
It’s sad isn’t it?
---
So just playing a casual game against a pig and they turn into spiderpig from The Simpsons and somehow jumped in through the window when i wasnt looking. That, or Lag Switch, but killers cheating!? NEVER!
---
doing the objective 
---
Well that still puts Feng at around 20 while Ace is around 50, which is pretty Police Car emoji.
---
Such as?
---
Yep report it to steam and steam should have 0 tolerance because thats despicable 
---
Seeing people Gen tap, it’s disgusting 
---
Embrace your inner bastard
---
O shid.
---
O fuck.
---
😱
---
His expression is priceless
---
My understanding is that BHVR themselves don't have dedicated servers yet (supposedly coming summer 2019). Instead, the killer connects to them while the survivors connect to the killer, creating a bridge-like server connection. So if the killer has bad internet, you ecosistema lag because of it. 
---
Trapper should really be a tier higher. Arguably, so should Doctor - Carter not only gains pleasure from killing, but from driving his victims insane and both physical and psychological torture.
---
I was about to get super annoyed with you, so thanks for the edit lol. 
---
Ps+ is like 40$ a year if you dont buy full price like a dumbass, which would be 240$ for 6 years.
---
Unpopular opinion? I thought everyone equally hated this map too. I know I do.
---
Ringu 
---
I think playing on ps4 is pretty good. I can’t see a difference when comparing it to videos I see of monto or noob3
---
Console is so neglected in this game 
---
I'd put Trapper and maybe Amanda in the orange because both their pasts and bios show that they take some form on enjoyment in it.
---
Julie, Susie and Joey are either in the unhealthy piss yellow/light orange area or green area because they only followed Frank's orders probably out of fear (since the boy probably had a mood disorder) and followed Frank into the forest only to be forced by the entity.
---
Spirit should be in the green since she only wanted revenge on her father. She never hurt anyone in her bio either, the entity just sensed greater emotions out of her than her father. 
---
sorry for the crap phone quality :( I just built a PC so I'm still figuring out how to use my video capture
---
Before I started streaming dbd I came across these deeeelughtful swf streamers 3/3 of them streamed the same game 4th was rando. I was on the doctor and got the game map by luck. Gg man its over. However, i was playing my ninja doctor build( two best calms, monitor and abuse, bbq ext.)
---
Aaanyways I slaughtered them. They kept missing skillchecks, one didnt just Heal under hook he took the time to sabo it to.. then called me a tunneler because Id go after him again because he didnt mooove from where I left him. 
---
I wasnt even tunneling because I hooked the rando in the basement and went after his friend in between. They even tried to accuse me of camping when they would loop me around a hooked survivor. 
---
They let the rando die never even attempted to save even though I was across the map. I always knew where they were because sabo boi kept breaking hooks. 
---
Anyways afterword they were saying they were gunna report me for streamsnipping, lagswitching, harrassing and tunneling streamers. Like why would I need to snipe when you broke hooks and missed skillchecks??? But THE Best part! The true gold was at some point I said post game " well swf group isnt very fair either." AND they said they werent together!!!!! That they just happened to all have twitch in their name and it happens all the time... boi.. boi! Why! Why lie about that. Lol even their stream titles had each others name in it. 
---
When I called them out on twitch by saying "not swf huh?" Insta banned and apparently reported for cross media harassment. 
---
It made me want to stream just so I have proof of some of this bs. So ty...ty less than entitled toxic streamers I now have more subs/viewers and followers than the last time I saw you. 
---
More like he pooped his pants.
---
If I didnt knew any better, Id say its a oficial comic, quality looks great!
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
And Valve be like "as long as we don't get in trouble for it it's fine."
---
i had a match the other night where 2 people just kept hiding in lockers and one person just ran around like a chicken with his head cut off. 
---
i had to do all 5 gens myself 
---
thankfully the killer wasnt that great either but he still got 2 kills
---
the only reason he didnt get 3 was because after i opened the exit games i lead him on a chase and then lost him, then circled back to get one of the locker lovers off the hook
---
But the free Mori is cool
---
There was also that she wasn't making any progress on healing, so maybe they were lag switching?
---
"I bet you can't loop THIS, motherfucker"
---
Nice chest build ❤️❤️
---
Some losers are downvoting all your compliments.
---
It is rare indeed, but yesterday I was insanely lucky in getting two med-kits in one game with insta-heals
---
[Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq_Fm7qfRQk)
---
Hopefully you weren’t too mean to them lol
---
Lol. I love that show!
---
&gt;hiding the entire game
---
Also crows
---
I don't get it. Did you just not read [my other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/arxcmb/easy_ban_lol/egr3ute/)?
---
**I'm not arguing for or against any perk.**
---
I mean I didn’t roast them in end game chat, I just pointed out the broken matchmaking
---
As long as you don't tbag when you escape, I'll look the other way. I didn't see nuthin.
---
I love doing that to people
---
His backstory didn’t seem that “evil” to me at all. He just worked an a junkyard crushing cars until one day he realized he’d been crushing people inside of them, then he snapped and killed the mafia goons he was working for... and now he can become invisible because reasons lol
---
Poor host connection will do that too, don’t always assume the worst in people 
---
I wish they would add end game chat to console. 
---
Dont listen to him he doesnt get enough meat
---
If I remember right, she only started killing larger animals when she needed to, probably because she was getting so much bigger, and then Germany attacked Russia and the soldiers went through her forest, so she probably started killing all humans out of fear of the soldiers. 
---
Look at all the Claudette cosmetics.  Why are they in the bloodweb tho 🧐
---
Do you? I thought console players were glad they didn’t have it
---
"Free moris, motherfucker."
---
Mostly so I could talk to my fellow survivors. I usually have few words I would like to say to them, but I guess it’s probably better if I don’t lol. 
---
Ehhh most chats are fine, some can be pretty bad though
---
You can now hide behind Gens and blend in.
---
You can now hide in a locker to avoid being seen by BBQ.
---
This is in top of the other stuff you could do to avoid it before the nerf.
---
Nah, I was just sayin: the free Mori is cool.
---
I think a good solution would be that the killer cannot grab out out of the hatch but that there’s a radius around the hatch where if the killer hits you it’s a insta down or something. Make it so if the killers chasing you there they also have a chance. I mostly play survivor but I don’t think anyone should be entitled to the hatch, the killer needs some way to out play it. 
---
ehhh, just half is The Game.
---
I've played Scratched Mirror Myers on The Game a number of times to try to make it work. The lower portion is fine, but the upper portion of the level still has too wide and open spaces. 
---
It was a serious waste of a scratched mirror when we'd load into The Game and only two of the gens even spawned on the lower level. 
---
"easily countered"
---
explain.
---
Other than distortion it's still really strong. And even with distortion you'll still be found once you lose your tokens.
---
I was playing killer and during the Mori another survivor went and tbagged the person get Mori'd. And they didn't just tbag. They tbagged on their teammate's face.
---
Lockers hide your aura, gens hide your aura cause they are the same color as your aura faking one way and going the other, going witin 40 meters, etc.
---
He's not outright sadistic, but he certainly enjoys the hunt. 
---
Up top 🤚
---
Survivors shouldn't be able to leave the gate if they're downed, change my mind
---
I love this
---
B E E 
---
Well I’ll be doing this from now on I guess... you’re not wrong about it being a stupid workaround though lol.
---
That’s the nicest thing I’ve ever heard. I’m crying
---
Agreed. His chase power is weak but he is great at snowballing. 
---
It does just require one mistale and suddendly tje game is in your favor
---
 Myers is incredoble when you are in advantage.
---
Still, Tier C at best.
---
She's not exactly sane. 
---
I would imagine we get a teaser on Thursday during the Dev stream.
---
Looks more like the flex your mom makes when you about to sass her. "Try me btch!"
---
Swap ruin for huntress lullaby and throw on the jigsaw piece and u good
---
The gen aura change screwed us
---
Yes, I do.
---
And I see you have “Hex” in your name.  I will cleanse you.
---
It's all about the hunt... and purging the weak from this world. Bear Trap and Reverse... all shall feel the clench of the jaws. 
---
Sure!! I'll let you know!
---
Could be.
---
Finally, a killer that attracts the survivors and doesn't even need to go looking. ez matches. 
---
Don't worry, you're not alone ;)
---
sorry i didn't make it clear. They stayed in the game but all left as soon as they got to the postgame unlike the usual bigmouth survivors. 
---
Trapper is absolutely brilliant, though, there's no denying that. I have very little doubt he made the majority of his load out by hand. His buff was essentially him perfecting the designs. 
---
Then they go back to sleep.
---
Yare Yare 
---
I love this so much
---
Wraiths eat people, too, specifically their spines.

Who made Nea look like guys want her?

---
I stopped running plunders and ace in the hole because when killers dc on console I get nothing. Getting rainbow keys and maps to lose them due to a killer dc when I’m running 2 affective survivor perks and 2 loot perks sucks enough as is 
---
Yea very convenient timing but its funny now after the fact. I was playing with a friend and they also started lagging so we all probably had a spike in connection at a convenient time. #DeadByHitbox
---
Me, a casual gamer: "What are these things and do they make asymmetric horror games?" &gt;.&lt;
---
They are on Burger King Myers. If he manages to down you twice, you deserve it. 
---
Don’t you generalize bing bong boi. Maybe he’s a vegan wraith 
---
except the survivors
---
Is this Xbox?
---
YESSS
---
OUR QUENTIN ARMY SHALL PREVAIL!!!!
---
also,I'm Quentin as well. Same looks,even personality according to friends
---
JINGLE HOOKS, JINGLE HOOKS, HANG THEM UP LIKE STRING
---
He has such a way with words.
---
Rubber band issues always have to do with the killers ping since they are the host. Try and always pay attention to the killers ping in the pregame lobby. Make sure you give it a good 15 seconds to settle though,  because when you first connect it’s usually not the actual ping. 
---
In later movies it was showed that she was forced to rig test by Detective Hoffman.
---
And quite frankly... it serves them right. 
---
Is that dedard
---
OH YEAH 
---
I'll usually give hatch at that point to whoever deserves it the most.
---
legion should be able to drop pallets on survivors as well. 
---
Its not illegal tho.
---
Bloodlust on a fucking wall-hack Myers is what were talking about here.
---
That's what's op.
---
Anyone who has played for a week knows bloodlust is stopped by losing chase or breaking palettes..... Thanks for telling me something i know.
---
 There's a reason devs have scratched mirror without bloodlust. 
---
What do you even do with all those addons lol
---
Like I get not using addons to learn nurse but like after about three months of her I just cut loose and whipped out that pocket watch pinecone combo and started popping off on kids. That pocket watch makes u feel like a machine gun nurse
---
He got Dead 'Arded
---
Yeah, and I wanna hide in lockers
---
I think the trapper kills to please the entity, he's a daddy's boy. But, he DID kill his own father, so who knows. He was tortured by the entity, so probably just vents his anger and pain.
---
Where is NEA ?!
---
Mori to make sure I could kill the obsession, I was expecting DH to last about 2 minutes or less.  
---
Haddonfield works for me
---
I wish I knew how to make these. I have my own idea for tiers:
---
Was always going to be a monster (Myers, Freddy, Clown)
---
Product of their environment (Leatherface, Doctor, Huntress)
---
Got in over their head and just started killing (Wraith, Nurse, Amanda)
---
Caught a raw deal (Spirit, Hag, Hillbilly)
---
Hasn’t killed anyone yet but might like to try one day (Nea)
---
Wow thats new to me! I would be happy if I could understand the whole story
---
It’s one thing to give the hatch and it’s another to just farm the entire match (all players) ... but to kill one and give the farm to the other two will Pisa off the person Elton killed. Chances are they are watching the match. 
---
"Wraith" is just Phillip's title... He isn't actually a wraith, he's just a tortured man with a bell given by the entity.
---
Saw 2 is by far my favorite. So much to love about that movie. Amanda’s reveal. Eric Matthews. House stuff, while ripped from Cube, is fun and interesting. Good John development. Etc. 
---
And yeah, she seems far more put-together for an unhinged psychopath in 2 than 3. 3’s in general kind of a giant middle finger to John, his legacy, and what he stands for. The whole movie is basically saying he’s a failure, helped no one, and got tons of people killed. Just wish that he wasn’t looking so smug by the end of it.
---
Hiding your addons I see. 
---
They’re ultra rare for a reason...
---
Jesus people still do this? I remember back in mw2 days when I’d get messages saying they had my ip and were gonna crash my router haha. Funny how I said go ahead and they never did. People are so petty it’s sad.
---
Hook farmers are in the red tier too
---
Lmfao. This.
---
2 people left alive. 1 on hook, me as the other. On my way to go save I got found and chased until the hooked person died. Post game got called a bitch and trash for not saving them. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
A player intentionally sand bagged me at pallets and farmed me on the hook twice. The killer refused to hit me after the second time being pulled off the hook in front of him. I caught the player looping shack and just as he was coming around the corner I ran out in front to block him so the killer could land the final hit on him. 
---
The killer and I watched him die on hook, most satisfying game I’ve had and the coolest killer ever.
---
Shouldn't clown be in Orange tier or am I missing something in his lore
---
classy 
---
Quentin just standing there like a boss flipping him off, Freddy looks shocked to the very core.
---
ah ok interesting and also creepy as hell lol
---
I was playing killer and changed to the hat at the last moment. Still got 3k
---
thanks for the tldr saved me a bunch of googling and reading. 
---
Bvhr gonna pull a 4D chess move and release a killer worse than legion so we stop whining about a rework
---
The only uses I had for the key is to counter 3 gen situations, or when we only managed to do 3 gens and half the team dies and the other person is just waiting for me to die to get the hatch.
---
But with my luck, I either die first or get found before I find the hatch. The *one* time I opened the hatch made it worth it though.
---
I love how it goes back to normal when he points
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I remember they said in a lore stream that since Rin was taken by the Entity, she will never be able to get revenge on her father 😢
---
But why do people think that the fact that they are rare and not seen often is reason enough to call them balanced?
---
They aren't. They are just broken, cheesy aspects of the game that cater to casual-play rather than skill-based play.
---
It's like the Myers Permanent Evil Within III. When they have that, the game is practically forfeit for survivors. That's not fun or fair, and it makes me not even want to play the game the more I encounter such things.
---
Sorry this is happening to you. I did 3 gens in my last game and sadly 2 teammates didn’t make it but me an another found the hatch and keyed it out of there. See ya later, Spirit!
---
the Mafia got ways of making people....disappear
---
A couple of things, 1 I use that site all the time and have no issues. 2 install an adblocker you numnuts it the internet. 3 Can confirm that website is 100% legit never gotten any viruses or anything from it. 4 if you think THAT website is sketchy then maybe you shouldn't be on the internet until you learn more about technology.
---
I mean, Herman (Doctor) definitely fits the "was always going to be a monster category", in his lore he was recruited by the CIA *for* his sadistic tendencies.
---
where did he hide his add ons lul
---
Nailed it.
---
My stupid brain thought this was a fake Buddha quote there for a second. &lt;teabags calmly&gt;
---
Ok.
---
People violently defend SWF here dude. There was a Big post yesterday where OP made a bunch of rational calm points and the comments were almost all “lol git gud you’re a baby”
---
Is this some form of Hamon?
---
However justified it may be, witch hunting is a no-no.
---
Was planning on posting something similar!
---
I mean, especially if my last few games as survivor have been really shit (even without disconnect, just really good killers) it’s nice when a killer will give you a free ride sometimes if you’re the last survivor standing. Gives me the motivation to keep playing sometimes.
---
It's not a quality of life, it's a nerf, madness 3 is supposed to stop any kind of action being done (gens, healing. totens)
---
why would that matter tho? 
---
fr tho
---
The idea isn't to let them die on the hook (at least, not necessarily). It's to teach the Killer that there are consequences for camping, and discourage the behavior. 
---
Either they'll get the message during the game - meaning they stop camping and start playing - or it takes them a bit longer. Eventually, though, getting 7k BPs and 1 kill in a match will get old, and they'll either leave or start looking for a more effective strategy.
---
Thing is, that only works if the majority of survivors work together to punish campers. Never - and I do mean *never* - hang out next to the hook waiting for a chance to save your buddy. That encourages the Killer to also wait by the hook to protect his sacrifice and get a chance at killing you too - especially since that's at least one less person doing the objective.
---
Okay bud
---
I find that survivors tend to be more toxic. Whenever I play killer I get told that I’m shit and to go kill myself, that rarely happens when I play survivor
---
I love killers like this
---
*cringes
---
It's still a surprisingly human display of respect from a horrifying monster. 
---
I think it might be Jack the Ripper 
---
Bloodhound.
---
the game is really active, you don’t need dlc characters to get matched up with people and also the dlc maps are always free 
---
The Saw Chapter should've been Hoffman and the survivor should've been Agent Strahm imo
---
Half of legion are pretty plain evil though
---
I'm new to PC and have never seen a tree spawn directly in front of the gate on console. Is this normal?
---
just looked this up
---
its just ledge surfing like you'd do with rockets or stickies, why bother naming it something new
---
Don't Search it!
---
[You don't want to see what Freddy keeps in there.]
---
 (https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Black_Box)
---
It relates to his... ...hobbies.
---
It's hard when every survivor tells you to off yourself because you took BBQ &amp; Chili :(
---
As a Doc main, it’s not so much the killing as it is the shocking that gets my nipples hard. 
---
Ur wrong I'm right
---
Never will.
---
I think he would of d/c'd before we stepped into the exit gate,  if it was frustration. Waiting until we open the gates,  that's for sure toxic.. 
---
I definitely think there should be some sort of added penalty to someone who DC's, especially multiple times in a row. There's no downside to doing it outside of losing any blood points you gained during that match and those barely matter anyway, you can just get them the next match.
---
I can understand getting frustrated at your teammates and the killer, I've been there, but at least try to stick it out. 
---
The huntress seems to still have the mindset of a child, like she never truly "grew up" after the death of her mother. She acts like a child, she collects shiny objects, and she practically throws a tantrum when she gets stunned by a pallet.
---
Meh, no good reason. We opened the gate, ran in and ge DC's that quick.. For sure toxic it. If this was about surviors dc'ing this whole convo would go different,  that's what is funny about reddit. 
---
I was working on a gen and was on the side of the gen and the hillbilly was chainsawing towards the guy on the end and was on the complete opposite side of the gen was me so I didn’t move because there was a whole generator between us and yet when he chainsawed into the gen he downed me through the generator. Was absolutely ridiculous that never happened to me before. Also was hiding around a corner and got hit by a hatchet that clearly should have hit a wall. Hit boxes are definitely broke lately for survivors. 
---
I'm not so sure. There's really no way to stop people from hopping on Discord (or Teamspeak, etc.) with their friends if that's really what they want to do. Might as well justify it by giving the Survivors radios or some such. Then you don't have to worry about balancing for both solo and SWF games.
---
Then again, it's BHVR's game. I'm having fun regardless - I have no real dog in the fight - just thinking of what might make it easier to reduce salt in the future.
---
It’s always a fucking Claudette that body blocks, glad you got rid of her.

See if that was the case,  I would FULLY understand the DC. I play killer as well,  and have had plenty of shit games. Esp when I'm playing for a daily and not as my main killers,  and I never have quit. Even tho I have wanted to once because of a Meg non stop flash lighting me even when I wasn't in a chase lol just hiding and doing it. 
---
Franklin's on Legion is evil, to be sure, but I'd still rather face a (non-exploiting) Legion than Myers or Doctor.
---
What is this? I've never seen this 
---
Only time I see it happen is with severe lag. Like usually your internet or the killer's blipped out for a second, not "really far away" lag.
---
Clown at Evil Incarnate???????
---
To rework this list:
---
EI: Michael, Freddy, ~~Clown~~
---
Enjoys other's suffering: Doctor, **Clown** (it actively states in his lore that he killed the bird he got hold of as a kid because it "filled him with the feeling of power." Clown tortures and kills people because it's the only way he can feel good about himself. The VHS Porn only goes so far.)
---
Kills out of Revenge / Anger: Trapper, Hag, ~~Pig~~, Spirit, Hillbilly
---
Kills out of fear / insanity: Nurse, Bubba, Huntress, Legion (I think "fear / insanity" is a bit strong but they definetly only do it because it's all they can do after their first kill without going to jail), **Pig** (Insanity in beliving John Kramer's teachings.)
---
Forced: Bing bong
---
Oh yes, its amazing when you dont have ruin
---
OP is known troll.  They like to post contrary shit for the sake of being contrary.   It is a shame you like to white knight that behavior.
---
No, that’s not what I’m saying. Quite the opposite actually. We haven’t had many characters in games have MPD or other illnesses like that, and if Legion had it, if anything, it would help bring attention to it. People would be googling what it is and it would bring more light to it. I’m not saying “Oh look how cool MPD is” but this character could’ve been so much better, but it’s just a bunch of speedy teens with knives, nothing interesting. 
---
So there’s no explanation as to how he gained his cloaking ability? I always thought there is some kind of lore behind their abilities and I’m just not smart enough to figure out why.
---
I don't wholly understand what she was hoping to accomplish.
---
PC EU, survivor side: u'll find lobbies instantly.
---
Not without the help from the Entity in this case!
---
Them wild-eyed boys that had been away. 
---
Yeeaahhh anyone with any knowledge about networking can tell you that IP addresses =/= Home addresses so anyone who says something like this ain't gonna do shit. 
---
Honestly, I dont even know if she did it on purpose. 
---
Plenty of activity, although you might experience slow queue times for one side or the other from time to time - especially early on. Get past rank 15 and that problem lessens dramatically.
---
No DLC is required to play the game and it won't slow down your queue time at all. The only limitation is the characters you can play - and outside of licensed material (Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, SAW, TCM) those are also available for free currency if you want them.
---
My favourite thing to do is tell them that I’m gay. They usually leave after that
---
When you think of hiding in a locker in case of the Killer coming but it turns out the Locker is actually the Killer.
---
It might not have been the same for them.
---
Well if you look like the character then yea it'll be effortless :)
---
That would be legitimately awesome.
---
Never went against a legion that didn’t exploit 
---
I just use this to guarentee flashlight tbaggy cunts die, everyone else can live when that happens
---
I’m a Crayola survivor (non toxic) main but I had a daily as Amanda to chase survivors for 3 minutes.  Easy enough, I just chase them and and hooked no one. One Feng kept flashlighting me and yet I remained the bigger person and stuck to the plan and just kept chasing and not hooking anyone and soon as the match was done,  toxic Feng messaged me, “F#*+ing EZ”   
---
Makes me want to locate them IRL and lie in wait outside their home and hit them across the back of the head with a wooden plank. Hypothetically, of course.  ;)
---
Ugh, fuck those guys. I don't, but then again I pretty much only got them for their perks.
---
I love my bing bong boi. He never meant no harm to no one.
---
Not all tests, she was just forced to rig/fail her OWN test (by killing the doctor that I forgot the name of) by Hoffman, or he would tell John that she was (indirectly) responsible for his unborn son dying.
---
She herself did believe that some people were beyond cure, which are the people she rigged the tests of.
---
Lol that’s the purpose of Madness 3. Even before mending was introduced, you still couldn’t get out of the BT state while in tier 3. It’s just working as intended.
---
I love the Clown's map because of how silly Survivors can be on it sometimes.
---
*Sigh*
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Survivors can’t lag switch 
---
I want to marry you.
---
Everyone leaves after I tell them that...
---
?
---
Isn't the yellow one always the killer?
---
It took me like 5 minutes to find him lol.
---
Oh there is for most Killers, but Trapper, Wraith, and Nurse don't. 
---
While Trapper's and Nurse's sorta kinda relate to their backstories (she literally stole people's breath to somehow give her her power and he *trapped* people in a mine) Wraith's power is pretty out of the blue.
---
An African immigrant who ripped the spine and skull out of a mob boss? You get a magic bell!
---
I feel the same way, except instead of a wooden plank, a metal baseball bat...hypothetically
---
With a name like *Solitaire*, he should know you can't win every hand.
---
"Gonna cry? Maybe piss your pants? Maybe shit and cum?"
---
Hi brother
---
Can you justify why would didn’t hook anyone?
---
this is why I hate the remake despite everybody saying he did kill kids in the original there is no concrete proof in the first movie that he killed anybody as where the remake they go oh yeah big rapist 1000%
---
Spilling the lunchbox and getting honey on knees = missing a skill check while healing within terror raid
---
I don't know, I think that speed boost makes him pretty good. He's super fast after coming out of stealth and gets around the map crazy quick. I played him for the first time yesterday for two daily rituals and managed to get a 3k with just level 1 Bloodhound and no addons. Nearly got the 4k but I messed up which let the guy make it to the hatch. Obviously that's just one game and those survivors weren't exactly pros, but it felt *really* good. 
---
...OR the killer came up the stairs and around clockwise when you went looking. You know, what ACTUALLY happened?
---
If they had lag switched you would have seen a glitch in the matrix. You just got outplayed by a cunning killer and then bitchquit, leaving your teammates a man down.
---
What the fuck 
---
You should rank each Legion member because Susie I'm sure is forced but Frank probably enjoys it.
---
wait, but... there are now hooks or lockers nearby... how did... i guess ace musta gotten an 18 in charisma
---
I'm surprised MYC is that high - especially with Surveillance not on the list. I'd probably rate ANC over Ruin, myself - but that might just be my own experience.
---
I think only if they were being toxic or rude. Say the killer said something bad about a streamer. And the streamer posts this here. It would cause the streamers fans to come and hunt the killer down. Which is witch hunting. But something that wouldnt promote that like this should be okay. Sorry for the bad example. Only thing i could really think of
---
There's no way to stop them, but this game simply isn't the type of game that's designed to be used with voice comms. Like I said, if it was truly balanced for voice comms, it wouldn't be Dead by Daylight anymore. It'd be an entirely different game.
---
Lol, look at my profile for a clip of the same thing, just that the last 3 gens were just meters apart
---
why would Bloodhound make a difference? because it synergies with the ability and helps you track?
---
I just would love to see your face when you get moried out of no where when he didnt even bring a mori
---
...This kinda makes me want a SCP-049 skin for Nurse...
---
Youd think enduring would be above spirit fury. Because people use enduring alone or paired with spirit fury. But spirit fury really should only be paired with enduring not alone
---
Fact of the matter is, whether it was originally designed to be used with voice comms, it *is* played that way now. That results in a huge discrepancy between people who play with voice and people who don't, making game balance more difficult.
---
May not be the place to have this discussion, but I see a lot of survivor mains complaining over balance changes that can be largely explained by the SWF advantage. Seems to me that those balance changes would go smoother if everyone were on the same footing, so to speak.
---
I haven't read the lore. If anyone cares enough to explain, please do.
---
(This is a general reply to all the folks here)  I think there's a lot unspoken about the Wraith that I can't recall ever being confirmed by the Devs (but I want to say it was).  The Wraith didn't exactly snap, he... relapsed.  It's mentioned that he didn't want to get involved with crime, but you don't normally kill your boss once you discover how you're being used.  I think the Wraith was a former child soldier in Africa, someone who was there for so long but managed to get out.  Someone who killed a lot of people, did real mean nasty things and maybe used a little bit of that old magic to help him survive.  Now he's here, reliving his childhood over and over again.
---
Oh my, yet another victim of the disease...
---
The P3 clauDCtte is the worst.
---
Eh, IIRC Joey joined right in, and Julie wasn't very hesitant.
---
Susie still refused after they tried to force her: Frank grabbed her hand and physically forced her to stab the dying Janitor.
---
Honestly just because I was doing a daily &amp; since *I* needed to chase survivors for 3 total minutes, I thought it fair for that match that they got to live. I also put traps on some so I would not just chase one poor soul and as a rule I don’t down or hook people with traps bc I think that’s not their purpose.  (I use the traps to take someone off a gen for X amount of time). Oh and it was the First time I had played killer since the rank reset a week prior so I thought the match might have been imbalanced in my favor.  
---
TLDR; Was trying to be fair as possible 
---
Its even more brutal IRL
---
The Devs like the game length we have, aside from the most savage gen rushes in 4 minutes, which are super rare, and are an example of the highest level of survivor team play. 
---
But,rank 1 isn't where balance is going to be achieved. People mess about, and may players don't take the game as serious as all the people Commenting here. You can't balance for casual and competitive at the same time. So, they don't. They slow play the balance tweaks. 
---
The last time I gave a hoot about results, kills, points, rank, or disgrace, was last year in the fall. I used to only use the best add ons and moris. That has stopped, and I have chill games. 
---
I hit rank 1 killer and survivor in a week of reset, and hardly use add ons that are not brown and offering that do more than grant points. I still get 4ks against good teams, and often give hatch.
---
I am not competing atm, and I probably won't until we have a leaderboard. I have fun in every game, because I want all the players to have fun.
---
Balance means nothing to players like me. We just want the complaints to be addressed, so everyone can chill. 
---
The bodies in the cars were implied to be alive / in the trunk. Isn't that how he found out? 
---
Fact of the matter is, despite whether people play with voice comms or not, it's still not designed to be played with it. For the third time, if this game was truly balanced for voice comms, it wouldn't be the same game. With all the work that would require and how much it would change, they might as well scrap this one and start over with a completely new game, which means this game will be forever broken in regards to SWF on voice comms.
---
Glitch
---
a little off topic but they should add a timer to the games. Sometimes i just get people who intentionally hide in the map and make it just a pain.
---
Toxic. Takes forever to get up there. But a killer can get up there too if you do it right.
---
Some people would disagree about Freddy being pure evil. He grew up in orphanages which led him to get bullied and then he got adopted by an alcoholic who abused Freddy which led him to killer his adopter. I think he was turned into a monster rather than born a monster.
---
Report them for taking the game hostage.
---
It's very well made, that's for sure, but mind if I ask why Legion? I honestly can't stand the killer.
---
Leigon should be killing out of anger and clown is likely mentally ill and put under insanity/ fear
---
*cringes 
---
No doubt. I'm a Trapper main, but I also like playing Myers, Wraith, Legion, Spirit, and Doctor. 
---
Gamer Tag like that, doesn't surprise me the least bit. What a dipshit.
---
I wouldn't say it is a regular occurrence but yes, it happens somewhat often with different tree models. Super annoying if you are playing as huntress. 
---
Because of moonwalking? I thought it was obvious. 
---
my best friend who duos with me moved into their new apartment and college is letting up so soon we can play again! we choose dumb thirst names about myers and bro!legions handsome buns and run a really stupid meg and min game. i have so much fun with them!
---
It’s how they get in the mood
---
The real evil is the society which abandoned the disenfranchised youth; preferring out of sight out of mind then rehabilitate and educate.
---
I don't know much about Nightmare on Elm Street lore, but that being said I'm pretty sure DBD Freddy is remake Freddy who was a child molester.
---
Maybe not "Evil Incarnate"; revenge for being burned alive is probably more appropriate.
---
Let’s just make the old days NOED default for all killers, and all survivors starting the match injured. 
---
Been playing for awhile, have not had this happen on console or pc
---
Let's be honest.  David king is a more terrible person than half the killers
---
ITT: "X belongs here."
---
Standing in the way of teammates so they get hit. Or dropping pallets on your teammate so they get hit.
---
I’m not sure how closely related the remake and the original are, but I would definitely like to think that the remake’s past is at least similar to the original Freddy’s past. Either way in the remake he only begun to kill the children because he was burned alive. That definitely sounds like revenge to me.
---
When I watch horror movies now I feel bad for the killers, I’m like, maybe they just got looped/d striked a few too many times.
---
Trust me. It’s well known by know. I guess that Huntress was going for hatchets and found you. But lockers for sure work.
---
If your new to dead by daylight or feel like a lore recap
---
😂
---
Little did you know memes never die 
---
Yup he got us real good.
---
Hmm, the way I read his lore page it sounds more like he showed particular aptitude for psychological study which caught the CIA’s eye. I actually feel like Herman could fit into any of the top three categories. He might have been a sociopath or he might have been driven to produce results. The real problem is that the majority of the lore article seems to focus on Lery’s Memorial Institute so I feel obliged to put him under the environment category. 
---
The wraith was forced mostly by his boss to kill only then did he find out and out of fear and anger he killed his boss so yeah he really isn’t that bad 
---
In the remake there was a lot of evidence pointing to Freddy being a child molester, which is what Freddy's "Black Box" addon references. (In the movies Quentin and Nancy find a black box containing a bunch of nude children in Freddy's stuff. I believe they find it when they were kids at Badham Preschool? That's why Freddy wants to kill them so bad: they're the reason he died. Again don't quote me on that haven't watched the movie just reading summaries online.)
---
Funnily enough it was against a huntress, though she didn't use her hatchets the entire game
---
It does, the Xbox One X has better graphics and is more powerful than the PS4 Pro. 
---
Or stop using NOED 
---
Yo fuck, he took the godamm socket swivels
---
If we somehow get motion controls for aiming it might not be too bad tbh
---
Solid chart, but I’d put Legion up there with Doc probably. 
---
Nothing in their story indicated outside insanity to me as much as they got a taste for blood from pushing their criminal limits further and further until it eventually culminated in murder. Everyone other than Frank might’ve been hesitant at first with the janitor, but at this point they’re basically a Thrill-Kill gang, killing for the adrenaline rush it gives them.
---
I wonder why you would do this the killer is taking out one of your teammates and could do the same to you if they use the red offering which could screw over the entire team so why waste time doing something so silly
---
Yeah it was a pleasant surprise. I felt like she was all over me all game, I'm not very good you see, but she played it real cool and I got to play the game instead of an instant grab hook face camp. :( I got to play the game while engaging the mechanics and it wasn't as boring as a farmer. 
---
I've never seen this before. This is creepy. lol
---
I care .
---
FOOKIN DED ARD
---
That actually sounds a bit true
---
This seems like the most logical response to me but OP is probably too stubborn.
---
Now I can get the shit scared out of me by tier 1 Meyers while being on the toilet in preparation.
---
Isn't Legion kind of split between the bottom tier? Frank would be fear and insanity although possibly anger and frustration. Maybe Julie would be up there two, but Joey and Susie seem like they were just pressured by them
---
no, u make sense and thats a good point. NOED isn't always used by good players and DS is basically a taker for all survs, so i see ur point 
---
Your zapping is with these puns
---
Lol saying Kate is thicc is fine. Saying cosplay Kate is thicc is immediate downvotes. White Knights... 
---
This is a video game subreddit. Go take your philosophy elsewhere lol 
---
Flashlight DS, I'm getting veitnam flashbacks. 
---
No kidding!
---
Honestly I hate going against lullaby more than ruin.
---
To establish dominance.
---
I was actually expecting something cute. Instead we got that...
---
I ran in between the Huntress and  my friend because I had just gotten them off the hook and the killer was camping. Funny thing is we had borrowed time so even if they hit him we would’ve been fine
---
Its always the neas for me
---
thats a good meme
---
DaMaHa89
---
Im in need too and would love to help out. 
---
Ahahaha I played against this guy as the pig and I destroyed him in a swf and then again as nurse. Always talks shit. Always loses.
---
Personally I don't think Blizzard brought that information out for the right reasons, same with Soldier 76 being gay. It just doesn't seem right to me. Different opinions, I guess. I'm all for bringing light to issues such as those as they are so important and having people educated on those issues is so important. As long as BHVR could do it in a non offensive way then I'd like to see the effort.
---
I would wait until new shrine shows up and if Nurse's isn't there.... then spend BPs on nurse...
---
Are you sure clown isn’t just killing for sadistic pleasure? It is stated he enjoys the pain he inflicts
---
This makes me happy knowing he's so desperate to escape because he loses so much he tells his friends to DC lmao
---
This^
---
In the fifth (i think) movie, one of the newspapers had an article about child molester, in the scene, where the main characters are searching info on Krueger. so yeah
---
&gt;African
---
So does this mean Wraith has an N-Word pass?
---
I agree. I’m not sure how they could do it in a non-offensive way seeing as this is a game about murdering people, but we’ll have to see. The next killer is going to be the oldest, so maybe he/she has some sort of mental disorder. Maybe PTSD from fighting in a war. 
---
At low ranks, lullaby is nightmarish because of the many fails if it survives to 5 stacks, but in high ranks its just silly, and most don't bother cleansing it unless they stumble upon it. It's really interesting how it can seem both OP, and Useless based on player experience and ranking. Personally I don't even think it qualifies as OP enough to be a Hex perk, same with Thrill of the Hunt, and Third Seal, but that's just my opinion.
---
Wrong type of switch bot.
---
Happy Cake Day, Mr Joestar!
---
Unless MrToxicDorkChop is also a Doctor player, it wasn't the killer that made that comment.
---
i love the wraith his face makes me so sad i love him
---
Not so satisfying when it gets broken in the first 20 seconds of the game.
---
I mean, I can handle the bullshit other games can throw at me. Siege: " how the f*** was that not a headshot?!* or World of tanks: " what do you *meAN I BOUNCED?!*
---
But with this game, my blood just boils when shit hits the fan.
---
\- / + rep is used for trading in general. There's nothing wrong with that translating into DBD.

In her time period Asylums were just about at their worst, although i cant quite remember but around the late 18th century? later? there was some despicable person going around performing lobotomies on people out of a van/truck and would sell fucking tickets and show off while doing it, causing pain that surpasses torture. I think John Kennedy's sister also got lobotomised.
---
jesus im disgusted. how entitled can someone be to go through the process of finding someone’s location?? just bc they died?? in a game??
---
I mean yeah, another example of completely broken, uncounterable shit...
---
\*farts  
---
Sorry, i had yogurt for lunch.
---
Better get hookin fast!
---
Well in the first movie it's pretty implied he's a child murderer. I read somewhere (maybe IMDB) that they intended to openly say molester, but there was a big pedophilia case going on while they were filming and they didn't want to seem like they were taking advantage of a tragedy, so they kept it generic.
---
I'm with you on this one, i havent seen good enough proof for their vigilante pyromania, i dont say he is innocent but he should have been proven guilty at least.
---
“Boo.”-  Wraith
---
wow..
---
This is why they changed Deja Vu. This! Right here! (this PSA is sponsored by the "3-gen strat sucks guys" foundation for the strategically impaired.)
---
Discordance is a top tier Billy perk imo
---
This is a video game subreddit and both of you are gamers, it should be an open and friendly community between gamers and not people like you teasing and dismissing what others say because it flew over your head.  
---
Try to be more compassionate, if you dont like what people say then vote and move on. Ironic im saying that now but i stand by my point.
---
Whats so special about that perk? Its just a even worse boil over in my opinion...
---
Oh shiiii forgot to put no homo 
---
What
---
Maybe he's not that kind of doctor.
---
Can't really complain about a killer playing sweaty if you use DS, though. 
---
I think wraith changed a lot when the entity possessed him, making him more huntress tier, imo
---
Eeeeeeviil
---
That made me so happy 
---
That video did not need to be that long
---
Aren’t you happy? You can play on your switch now!
---
Don't you remember the incest cult?
---
once ran the "Die flashlight, Die!" build (Franklin's, Lightborn, Distressing, OP) on my piggy when a 4 man swf queued up all bearing purple flashlights. They all disconnected about 3 mins in because I was destroying their flashlights, none of them could get blinds or FL saves, and they were too altruistic for their own good. Still makes me laugh thinking about it... such a useless build otherwise. 
---
Nurse is NOT easy to play. If that wasn't obvious already
---
she was a victim who survived then took over iirc. She's crazy not evil, I mean have you seen the TV show Becker... she was friggin nuts.
---
The hatch was between the gen and the window. 
---
I’ve never seen all the movies
---
Jesus
---
Jesus Christ 
---
If they deserve it who cares 
---
Yeah. She didnt notice the window trap but I had to disarm a couple to get to her and she almost crawled away. 
---
Shit gets weird
---
The Entity doesn't possess killers, it either finds killers preconditioned to murder or it "encourages" them to kill, like with all of the killers in wraith's tier. The Entity feeds off the killers' emotional energy as well, so it can't control them itself due to the first law of thermodynamics.
---
Sorry Wraith but I just don't like being found in the first 5 seconds then face camped like 99% of the time
---
On that list I only use Ruin, I feel accomplished.
---
Evan MacMillan brutally murdered some of his workers because they pissed him off (IIRC he dumped more than a couple into the furnaces to scare the rest into obeying his every command).
---
You can argue he only commited "the worst mass murder in modern history" because he was extremely devoted to his father, and you can argue that he only kills for the Entity because he's been heavily tortured, but he was a very brutal, cruel, and vicious man who committed multiple murders of his volition.
---
As if anyone takes BBQ for the wallhack portion of it.
---
Can the killer go somewhere else to hook? Yes. 
---
Can said survivor have other way to run to other than that Window? If no, then you are in trouble. If yes then no. 
---
I know but his motive  was " I did nothing wrong and I'm going to get revenge on the people that I think did me wrong" that's why he murdered people. He didnt murder people because he was a p.o.s pedo
---
Don't forget all the entity torture he sat through. Those hooks and all that metal lodged in him isn't just a hobby, it was put there without consent or any sort of medical knowledge lol
---
I defined the insane category as sociopaths that don't kill for no reason- they have something to gain from it. The "just plain evil" category is for those who only really kill because they get pleasure from it.
---
His counterplay is his ridiculously slow movespeed.  Even with bloodlust, it should be super easy to loop him and make him break a pallet (which breaks bloodlust)
---
Looks like great gameplay, both sides having a great time. I'm a bad killer, but at least i dont waste people's time because you have a perk i dont like.
---
Lol never ever put yourself in to a position like that vs a Leatherface or Billy...
---
i swear ill PUKE
---
For some reason I tend to get shitty team mates on PC than on PS4. Like people will just let you hang there till it gets to second phase. 
---
Now kith.
---
I'm not sure if you watched all of the NOES remake, but he was a pedophile and child-rapist until he was burned alive. Then he came back as a Dream Demon to kill the children he raped because he blamed them for his death.
---
Even if you're talking about Englund Freddy, while he wasn't a pedophile (at least IIRC; since I know Craven wanted him to be one but changed it because he was scared of media backlash) he was still a sadistic serial killer who murdered multiple kids before being burned alive after which he took great pleasure in torturing and murdering kids in their dreams.
---
He totally deserves to be in the 'pure evil' category.
---
At the beginning of the game
---
*laughs in Sony
---
Wraith face camping with invisibility on. 
---
It ain’t that bad in my experience, but once again that’s MY experience
---
 I didn’t know how to add text with video and I’m unsure if this fits guidelines. I was in the middle of a match and got stuck. I couldn’t do anything about it until the killer took me and put me on the hook, which happened to be my last. Is there a way to fix it or do you just have to let it lag up? 
---
Lol the hatch shouldn't be allowed to spawn inside killer shack solely because of Trapper.  I main him too and that spawn is ridiculously unfair for survivors lol. 
---
And he plays bubba, what a shame giving bubba and PC players a bad name.
---
Right but this would imply he's probably killed many people via the crusher but not to his knowledge.
---
This is what really set him off. 
---
Myers have no time for THOT. 
---
I imagine an orphan, because who could love a P3, DS usin,g *clicky clicky* flashlight toting Claudette. 
---
He easily should have caught up there, that was quite a misplay by LF.
---
If you’re a streamer, you don’t get the luxury of anonymity when you’re being toxic. 
---
Legion isn't evil? Frank only stabbed the guy because of fight or flight response and he couldn't leave Jules behind. Other members, yes were forced by him but you can't say they're pure evil like Michael or Freddy. Just humans being humans. 
---
Made an oops, I think the perk icon jumbled my mind
---
Just enjoy the art for once. 
---
I've always seen Wraith's invisibility as an extension of how he was treated in life. Kind of invisible, sort of a nobody who was just there to be ignorant and do the dirty work for the people he worked for. Then when he finally finds out what he's been doing, almost out of nowhere he's their unexpected end.
---
^^or ^^they ^^just ^^thought ^^invisibility ^^was ^^cool
---
What kind of backward as fuck are you to think harassment is acceptable just because someone was a little salty in a video game?
---
Overwhelming and Insidious look pretty similar. And people mix up Overwhelming and Unnerving because the names are similar. I see your train of thought lol. 
---
Congrats BHVR you’ve played yourself
---
Yes it happend when i had 2 nurse challanges and at the last saconde i switched to hill billy
---
Hol up
---
There are books from the series? 
---
Why the clown?
---
Pig, Myers, anyone with tinkerer's.
---
And it does not work on any survivor. A smart survivor will not let you bodyblock them.
---
A sad person
---
Basically screwing over a teammate intentionally. Unhooking in front of the killer, bringing the killer to another survivor on purpose, the examples others have listed before me, etc. 
---
I always imagine Leatherface fumbling with a keyboard or a controller so I start laughing too hard to get upset that I'm getting dunked on.
---
Alternatively if they DC I imagine him taking his chainsaw to a monitor/TV.
---
Doesn't Amanda get pleasure out of killing? It's been a hot minute since ive seen the movies but wasn't her whole thing just killing for the fuck of it via unwinnable games? 
---
Now kiss
---
Better run, better run,
---
faster than my chainsaw.
---
I wouldn't have minded some young sub teachers showing some leg.
---
He only had himself to blame!
---
If you had been there
---
If you had seen it!
---
I betcha you would have done the same!
---

---
You’re misunderstanding. We’re talking about when a killer body blocks a survivor so that they’re stuck and can’t continue the game. Like body blocking a survivor in a corner, or trapping them in the basement. And not for a minute to run out borrowed time or to land a hit. This means when the killer is doing it for long periods of time to force a survivor to dc. 
---
Survivors can also do this to each other. And it’s also against the rules. 
---
this happened to me before. I was last alive and hatch not far as I passed by it. I crouched by a tree and noticed I got stuck so I waited for the killer to find me :(  
---
I was lucky to hit my DS and made it out a live by luck since I rarely hit DS 
---
Come and hang out! We're fun!
---
For me, i am struggling as the Wraith for the killers while on the survivor side would probably be Laurie since obsession perks.
---
I mean, he definitely approaches it almost like an art, but we can't really know what's going on inside his head. He's not like Freddy, who's constantly cracking jokes and dragging out the kill.
---
There's a lot of contradiction when it comes to Michael. In the 4th and 5th movies, they talk about him just being obsessed with killing his family members because of the Curse of the Thorn.
---
Just someone who's either having a shitty day or has very little emotional control. 
---
Yeah. I also spammed my bell of encouragement while they were doing shit. (Wraith btw)
---
Fuck you looking at, keep running
---
Well there's a lot of contradictions because there's a lot of timelines to follow. The characterization of Michael depends on which timeline you choose to follow. But in regards to the first film, which the game version is based off of, there is definitely some level of admiration and enjoyment of the kills. 
---
For example the scene where he puts on the sheet and pretends to be Bob. He could very easily just walk into the room and massacre the girl on the phone. He *chooses* not to, and instead goes with the glasses and sheet. He gets some level of satisfaction from his work, even if it's a different kind of satisfaction than Freddy, who prefers drawn out brutal kills. 
---
I don't know anything about the gears, but recently they did change her terror radius from I believe 28m to 32m as well as they reduced her base crouch time. I'm not sure of the numbers on her crouching, but combat straps aren't as much as a must have for her anymore.
---
I'm not sure why but a lot of people on this sub seem to give the child raping murder an easier time than he deserved. Like, yeah he died a painful death at the hands of a mob, but the mob happened because he was murdering and raping their kids.  After that his form of vengeance wasn't to kill the people who killed them, but their kids who had nothing to do with the angry mob. 
---
Dude's Michael level for sure. 
---
Moris, while thematic, are in my opinion absolutely stupid to have in the game. An ebony mori essentially removes 66% of the survivor stock pool. Yes they're rare, but there is no equivalent to their power, barring the old BNP. 
---
I think an appropriate place for the mori would be having the yellow mori (only works on the last survivor on the map) simply be baseline. This would retain the cool thematic vibe of the mori, allow killers the opportunity to see the cool animation more often, free up the offering spot for the killer, and not ruin games for survivors the way the ebony moris do. 
---
Missing:dirty,boots,tattoo and short hair
---
He was proven guilty, everybody knew he did it. They mention that there was legitimately a trial. He was only freed off a technicality. Somebody screwed up the papers or something like that. They mention it in the first movie and throughout the series and its various forms of media. 
---
makes me wonder, i forget if there is a hook damage decay, like decay on the bars progress of it being disabled
---
to be fair Michael's character is that hes evil incarnate
---
Sooooo .., I main 2/3 evil incarnate and I play as toxic as I can usually damn something is wrong with me... xD
---
The clown is a legit psychopath. It states on the the dbd wiki.
---
Exactly, I was agreeing with you, just giving you a proper recount of how it happened
---
Freddy should be out of revenge and anger. The original Freddy was, while different than Michael, definitely pure evil. But the game is based off the remake one, who only killed Nancy, Quentin and the rest of the kids because they told on him after he molested them. He never killed anyone while alive, only as a dream demon for revenge. It's the original series where he is a child murderer from the beginning. 
---
Nope not at all you can just leave it at 99% and then just wait until the killer is near
---
Oh, camping, that also sounds like a lot of fun.
---
Frank definitely has the desire, and Joey joins in easily; I'd say they're probably both in the "Gains pleasure" category. Julie gives very little resistance, maybe kills out of fear/psychosis considering her relationship with Frank. Susie's definitely down with Wraith. She never even chooses, she's forced into it with her hands pushed by someone else. Just using the different masks I think is enough to differentiate in a tier list like this one.
---
Yeah, any other killer can just whack someone and get them off it. It's stupid that Freddy literally cannot stop someone trying to sabo a hook in his face when he's carrying someone.
---
I don't put Evan as pure evil because of the obvious signs of mortal wounds all over his body. The most wounded killers are likely the ones tortured the most by the entity, as an incentive to go kill. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it would be difficult to accidentally impale multiple steel rods into your body. Not to mention the entirety of his skin looks somewhat scarred, and the mask to hide his face. This means that the trapper put up a fight against the Entity, was tortured, and forced to hunt.
---
Amanda, regardless of how she became this way, no doubt was not tortured by the Entity. She loves to kill for the sake of it. Not to mention how she didn't actually digest any of jigsaw's philosophy of redemption and yada yada, she just jumps straight to murder with inescapable traps because she enjoys it.
---
Michael myers is the evil,  the other ones...  just try 
---
Trapper is not reluctant. He's a sociopath who did anything his deranged father asked him to, and he loved every second of it. He's a sadomasochist who forged a smiling mask from bone and steel to terrify his victims. I wouldn't regard those as part of his situation. And it's also strongly implied he killed his father anyway, so I'd argue he was even more deranged than him.
---
DS isn't a huge deal in the hands of new or low ranked players. In that way you're right. They stab you, they run away a bit but don't know exactly where to go and likely get downed shortly thereafter. 
---
 The problems it brings to the game really chart to compound at higher ranks where games are extremely fast and most if not all survivors know how many times you can loop each pallet.  In that case you stab them, they run to the nearest semi-safe pallet and take you on another handful of loops. While they do this generators get plugged away at. 
---
I'm not arguing for him I just appreciate the subtlety of the original not screaming in your face that he definitely raped kids
---
Hi zombie!
---
Still making DbD SFM pictures I see :D
---
We should play sometime bud
---
Thank you!
---
Id say the clown gains pleasure in killing same as Doc. The clown likes to collect souvenirs or trophies from his kills. He doesnt do it because hes evil, even if what hes doing is inherently evil. Also, Id say the Hillbilly has gone insane too since he'd spent so long in confinement.

---
Wait I thought the Wraith killed Azarov because Azarov was trying to kill him?
---
Month is not the limit! 
---
Clown isn't really evil incarnate. He at least tried to prevent himself from killing through junk food, alcohol and drugs. Failed but tried.
---
For legal reasons in other countries yes
---
Feng's like 16 real talk tho
---
I think he tortures people, not rapes them
---
I can further confirm this.
---
Surveilance is very usefull now (even on pig, it allows to go in with no TR)
---
Hillbilly fits into the "product of their environment" category though, right?
---
The better nurse 
---
I'd say the same but also put Clown in that tier. He obviously enjoys killing but I'm not sure he's in the same league as Myers and Freddy

Idk if the wraith one is a joke or not, but wrauth should be in the fear or insanity part

---
It's not mean't to let you wriggle off unless there was some set up (Saboing, etc) Its so the killer cannot take you to the basement and has to use the nearest hook.
---
Look man, I play plenty of wraith. He basically doesn't have a power once you find someone.
---
If you think he is better, that's fine, everyone is entitled to their opinion, no matter how wrong it is.
---
If she loses all vision, then survivors could just walk either direction to avoid the blink, or walk behind a wall and double back and she'd be completely fucked.
---
If she lost scratches she'd be fucked by corn even more so.
---
Her stealth is fine currently. She needs a blink change, like a charge meter and compensating movement speed.
---
I readied up with my ready-to-go spirit and set my controller down to get a drink.  Came back and I was playing my addon-less freddy
---
that'd be OP as shit if it didn't do that
---
You know you can go to recent players and dm him right? 
---
Or allow killers to "kick" (punch?) hooks so their progress regresses, the same way gens can. It's kind of dumb how survivors can just 99% a hook and the killer literally can't do anything about it.
---
I don't get how game mechanics can be toxic, ds is fine and noed is fine aswell. Don't forget to cleanse totems guys! 😅
---
Yes let's kill sabo even more.
---
Sabo needs a buff to make it viable, not any more nerfs.
---
You know those kids on those old minecraft xbox 360 trolling videos? The kids that have voices that match the frequency of a plane taking off? I like to imagine toxic people are those kids, but now they've grown into teenagers
---
Catching a survivor is a struggle. Unless their teammates actively try to do something about it ,getting someone to a hook shouldn't also have to be a struggle. 
---
Are you on console ? On pc hes not unlockable witn shards rn
---
I wasn't being negative about it, I was simply pointing out potential evidence to suggest that it was a lag switch, and trust me, if the concern is about turning the game into a toxic warzone of people from either side parroting bullshit at one another, it's far too late for that and I can point you at 3 different sources we can call ground zero.
---
Toxic Survivors that use bullshit methods and play simply to grief, like Ochido or a former acquaintance of mine.
---
Toxic Killers that use bullshit methods that simply makes the game unfun to play, like Leatherface Insidious Basement Camping.
---
And of course BHVR that actively puts in unfun and broken content, encourages methods that kills fun (literally, in the early days of DbD one of the loading screen tips was to bait survivors with a slugged survivor and then chainsaw them), leaves things weak, broken, or just boring, and I suspect at this point they just break things on purpose to further piss people off and fuel the fires between the 2 sides.
---
You just SLAP yourself in the face haha. NOED can  be cleanse, what about DS? DS is a definite escape . While NOED can only be done after 5. Your argument is invalid kid hoho
---
Same

But then you'll go against a team of NAVY SEALS with walkie talkies and they'll be rude to you :(
---
It was 10 seconds the stairs were out of view. Watch again.
---
Wasn't Michael cursed to kill people?
---
I'm assuming you're rank 19 bro? 8 games as killer, 3 SURVIVOR has DS, PER GAME .
---
As a survivor 3 of my other team mates have DS . You were saying ? Come on. Those that were not using it are me boy.

Did you enjoy touching your pp? 
---
He snapped when he realized that he had unwillingly killed a bunch of people and this scarred him and maybe even permanently driven him insane, I don't think so. The Entity tortured him a lot before he started working as a killer, which means he didn't want to do it. I think it's safe to assume he was forced into killing, whether that's because he is afraid of the Entity or because he's been broken and completely changed.
---

Already watched all of his case file videos for killers but some of them are outdated. Trapper still has The old trap setting animation

This right here is why I made a post about why auto sacrifice should be removed on attempt escape! XD

Nah, 'bro', totally wrong.. You're getting really riled up, you need to chill. I can smell the smoke coming out of your ears from here. Take a break, you're having bad luck. 
---
Yeah it's like he woke up one day as a kid and decided that this is who he is going go be for the rest of his life. And for the lack of any apathy combined with infinite determination he went on and did it.

It's also not particularly gross either imo.
---
At that point it might as well be, "Press the power button to instantly hook all survivors and break all generators." 
---
I admit I'm pissed with people spamming flashlights and t-bagging when they have DS. DS does promote toxicity in the community, so why not remove BOTH NOED AND DS? 
---
Missing the Cowboy boots, the tattoo sleeve and the leg tattoo (you can get that as a fake, or have Henna tatto) and the dirt, plus the picture being taken by yourself is such a low effort :(

In this tier list, he also belongs in the bottom category. "The doctor does not wear his headgear willingly". The entity forced it on him
---
Yep, Craven says this in the Never Sleep Again documentary.
---
retconned out of canon with the new one!
---
Game needs a man spider killer
---
They originally were going to but they thought that society wasn't ready for that type of a horror movie. So they changed it. That's why the remake outright states it. 
---
Look at Streamers like no0b3 and tru3talent. They have DS and NOED but don't even use. People who I respect. So do I, I'm not using either 😉. Are you one who uses DS and flashlight? Oh maybe dead hard too
---
I always like trying for them riiiight after a rank reset if it's a killer or survivor I dont like the perks for
---
excuse me but who the fuck wants to rank up? Rank 10 is the place to be.
---
Rank 1 is a punishment not an achievement
---
It's a better movie for leaving it up in the air. Intentional or not
---
I don't really agree with the doctor. The developers confirmed that the doctor was forced by the entity. The doctor doesn't wear his face mask willingly
---
Kindred is like the perk thats super nice when exists but you never want to spend a perk slot on it

---
In any movie chase scene I roll my eyes, because I can see how long the loop is going to go on for. 
---
"doesn't even seem to enjoy it" lmao you clearly have never seen the movies. He doesn't "seem" to enjoy it cause he doesn't externalize feelings, the guy is unresponsive and apathetic, since he was a kid Michael was a total psychopath, he killed to fill his thirst for murder, first started with animals, once he got tired of them began to slaughter people. You may say that he was driven by an anger caused by his shitty childhood (abusive step-father, bullying in school etc) but it's not even really about that, it was just an incentive to make his true nature emerge.
---
Ok that’s adorable. 
---
Gotta love the shit talk like they did something amazing.
---
Makes it look like she has a similar cloak to the Wraith.
---
Huntress is kinda mixed
---
She killed humans like ww2 soldiers for "sport" but also refused to kill children and younger people so it's a mix of killing by pleasure and forced by entity
---
I really like the ideas except being prestige being an advantage as this will make people feel forced to rush prestige and only play 1 survivior and a limited number of killers
---
Maybe it's 2/4 in the right cayegory, 1/4 in a higher category and 1/4 in a lower category
---

Daily is more worth than that survivor kappa
---
&gt; As the group stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Joey clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn't want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they'd started. Julie closed her eyes and slid the knife into the man's chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man's throat.
---
He clenches his jaw but AFAIK clenching your jaw isn't a sign of disgust, just exertion. He also puts up no verbal or physical resistance; as soon as Frank says do this, he did it.

---
Oookay, got any stories as a killer?
---
Pay attention to how he's using the chainsaw, most billies rarely try to use it in jungle gyms, the shack or other easy loops.
---
Something I like to do as Billy is rev the chainsaw at 1-5% when nearing pallets, and the moment the surv either drops it or tries to get another loop I instantly cancel it and either break the pallet or M1, it works quite often so you should at least try to expect them to try it.
---
Besides that he's a 115% killer who can only instadown you if you don't pay attention or have nothing to loop.
---

I've been with friends who got disconnected because of Easy Anti-Cheat, but weren't cheating. They just needed to go into Steam and re-verify their files. I assume that something in the files  just gets messed up during a session sometimes.
---
The Wraith and the Trapper should be switched imo. Evan still shows the tortures used by the Entity to force him to serve it. His mori shows also he doesn't seem to care too much but he does it because he has to, cold and efficient. The Wraith instead went literally insane and his mori shows a deep anger that he just doesn't show normally. There are also some hints about how he is full of wrath in some cosmetics and addons (I think)
---
But do they have them
---
The Nurse literally thinks she is helping the "sick" survivors
---
Odd, I see Freddy on there. 
---
And i keep getting downvoted for pointing out how it's not ok to DC to give hatch to another survivor... 
---
Some people are ok with cheating i guess.
---
We're going by level of evil, not level of willingness. Even before he was taken by the Entity, Herman Carter is easily the most evil of the non-licensed Killers (because Freddy, obviously). 
---
The Clown is nine kinds of fucked up, but at least he just anesthetized and killed his victims. The Doctor wanted them to *suffer.*

Ugh, this is *sooo* yesterday!
---
Lots of streamers do this, even some of the most popular SWF-heavy ones. It's weird when they use this exploit then seriously complain about killers R exploiting (which shouldn't be done either)
---
This guy has practically no viewers/followers in comparison to those streamers, so it's more just a symptom of this community's accepting attitude towards abusing a blatant exploit than this guy's own personal toxicity. For the record, you can click "watch full video" from the clip and this guy's friend was far more dickish with his puffed-up shittalk in the lobby/on stream than the streamer himself. He didn't say anything too bad after the game from what I saw.

---
Thanks! Honestly i love the concept. I find it interesting. 
---
 I'm planning to do all the killers, and Legion is easier than the others. 
---
Yeah Freddy didn't really need the pedo-angle, but he was originally planned to be a pedophile even in the original movie. They only changed that quite last-minute because there was a streak of murders by pedophiles at the time and they didn't want to kinda "endorse" this.
---
I think they should have dropped it for the remake as well. That being said, Robert Englund will always be my favourite Freddy. That actor is so charismatic and fun to watch, even in other roles.
---
NOED is an interesting idea but it's horrible. An end-game trump card perk that puts an insane twist on things is cool, but NOED is just boring, skill-less, and it discourages killers from actually using their abilities. Overpowered? No, I'd say it gets you just as many kills as any other meta perk, but it's the WAY you get those kills that makes it downright not fun.
---
Decisive Strike can be game breaking when there's more than one survivor using it, and having it tied to a skill check doesn't seem like a good solution to that. People complain about Adrenaline, but the best killers never let the game progress that far anyway. At least Adrenaline gives survivors risky options to weigh ^((should we heal or push through this generator and use Adrenaline instead? Should I hide or engage the killer hoping my teammates will complete the last gen so Adrenaline can save me?)), but Decisive Strike is always useful and there's no risk and almost no strategy to it.
---
Serves that bitch right. 
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
But the synergy is also pretty high with this build
---
No, they first announced dedicated servers Summer 2019, never has been planned to get here January.
---
Dec-Jan was the Engine Update Pass, maybe that's what you're thinking about.
---
Precisely why I won't be buying it on the Switch. 
---
I've seen clips where it did, but I don't know if it does anymore, and it shouldn't. Period.
---
Huntress kill for sport. She enjoy killing.
---
Can you read? The reason why you should use in-game report is literally right there in OPs text.
---
Nope. There wasn’t a Halloween II movie, just as there wasn’t a live action ATLA movie.
---
Yeah but they sucked up the Legion after only killing person
---
Yeah i was trying to work around the part in their  bio where one knife was passed around 
---
I think of her as feeling sorry for the Survivors because they're here in the first place. In aanner of, *The Fog sucks, this fate sucks, and dying sucks, so let's just get this over with, alright?*
---
Trapper could also be placed in the "Forced by the Entity" section and do double duty. He doesn't run hooks through his flesh for fun.
---
Jigsaws MO was to allow people to escape, and because Amanda didn't do that, she actually got punished by Jigsaw and died. 
---
Not just lobotomized, but they botched it and left her as a vegetable. 
---
get in lockers
---
🤔
---
Drop quentin, chase dwight. Three survivors are now wasting time.
---
It was during the match.
---
It was farming but it is not bannable. Working with a one or more survivors to kill the others is bannable.
---
Ah.
---
Awesome!
---
If you camp, you will get like 10000 bloodpoints with 1 or 2 kills and depip. It is not farming as the camped one and you aren't getting any bloodpoints.
---
X gonna give it to ya.
---
um
---
Yeah i get that. I just never thought about it ig. I always use endfury with most of my killers. Like you said except huntress since she respects them.  So thinking about using spirit fury alone just sounds really weird to me. I find i it weird when huntresses use those perks. Because normally you shouldnt take a pallet stun as huntress so those perks arent very useful. 
---
not really.
---
I mean Bloodhound helps with tracking, but moonwalking is not needed.
---
Even uf you want to break the Chase, just look at the floor. There is no need to run Backwards 
---
Oh god one time I was healing someone under a pallet, then a skill check came. Space bar right when the healing completed. Press F for the pallet.
---
That's the stronger Entity. The Entity was weaker before and couldn't do that yet.
---
away withthat cursed land
---
Nothing in Carter's backstory suggested he was originally trying to help people. Unlike Crotus Penn Asylum, Léry's was not a real hospital but a CIA black site researching mind control and interrogation techniques. Carter ran Project Awakening for *years* before the Entity called him to perform the final act of violence that turned him into a Killer.
---
More than any other Killer - perhaps uniquely among them, in fact (again, unless you count Freddy) - Carter didn't have any particular vulnerability that the Entity exploited; no trauma in his past or sudden event that broke him. 
---
All of the other original Killers were born or placed into a hopeless situation and just needed the Entity to give them a final push. Carter, on the other hand, just cheerfully committed a stunning number of horrible acts throughout his life that eventually made the Entity take notice of him.
---
I had someone holding the game hostage the other day. The hatch was open and they were the last one left. 20 minutes had gone by and I still couldn’t find them so I assumed they were hiding. I didn’t even care I’d they escaped, wouldn’t camp the hatch, I just wanted them to leave!! If I’d found them in the first 10 mins I would have given it to them. 
---
So after these 20 mins by chance I think I should just turn my volume up to max, and as I’m walking past an exit area I hear a cacophony of crows. This nea is hiding in a bush near the exit gate. I was so frustrated she had held the game hostage like that I killed her and hooked her. 
---
After the game she says “sorry I’m new and I was too scared, didn’t know what to do and I didn’t stand a chance”, I cracked up laughing and felt bad for scaring her so much. If I had known she was just genuinely frightened I would have let her out lol
---
Oh damn... how fucking cool would it have been if we got Frank, jules, and Joey as legion, and susie as a survivor? 
---
So we have a spirit game. I took out ruin. Took away 2 dull totems and found 2 lit totems. She had no other totem perks. And this meghead comes and sees them with me. She breaks it and goes down almost instantly LOL
---
Bing bong 
---
I guess... still, why did the entity torture the Doctor? If the doctor went so willingly, then why did the entity still have to twist his arm?
---
Bing Bong
---
All my mains are in one category. Does that mean something?
---
Pig is pretty good as she has built in slow down in the game and her ambush helps in chases (in higher ranks only, as lower ranks just run forward throwing pallets down). Check Ardetha and Pyrus, they know really well how to use the pig. In lower rank, use the ambush or just get back up and try a grab as the ambush won't help much.
---
I play killer and survivor and suck at both
---
Maybe he became invisible to hide from his problems 
---
Bliss on susie's face?
---
Doesn't the wiki says he is African?
---
I think the game should give a free tracking ability if no gen progress was done in last 5 minutes. It's pretty easy to avoid having crows
---
Wrong. I'm saying that because she looks like Kate.
---
*Bing Bongs in bone clapper and blink addons*
---
Correct me if  I’m wrong, but trapper kinda falls under the forced category. All the mangled meat hooks coming out of this arms are from the torture he endured after not killing for the entity. I’m gonna assume when he was alive he only killed because his father told him to do so.
---
You're welcome)
---
In all honesty though my perks Which i used were save the best for last tier 3, rancor tier 3, unrelenting presence tier 3 and Devour hope tier 2 since i didn't have anything better on my legion.
---
So how this happened was that a David and a tapp completed a gen very close to my totem Which was on a hill. I frenzied them both and m1'd the tapp before hè could get to a safe pallet.
---
I hooked Him Around the little shack with the second Floor in the corner. I checked my totem again and the injured David was there hiding without balanced landing so i was able to easily m1 him. Once i hooked the David, tapp got saved which gave me 3 stacks of devour hope. When i went back to tapps hook i saw a nea crouching Along the way Which i insta downed Thanks to devour. I hooked her at tapps hook and during it i saw tapp there in the area Which i downed aswell.
---
I kinda rushed this picture because i had 3 people hooked at the same time, so my bad for that :/
---
Do you Main doc. 
---
A person who insecure about themselves so they have to belittle other people in order to feel good about themselves. Its pretty sad. 
---
Not sure that it *was* to twist his arm. The Entity tends to give its Killers powers - and alter their appearance - to reflect the actions that brought them into the Fog. The Doctor's "headgear" is part of his ECT equipment, and prying his eyes open reflects Herman Carter's primary purpose: collecting and extracting every ounce of possible information. This is also reflected in his playstyle - the Doctor has the best map awareness of any Killer in the game if he uses his power effectively.
---
*Karen
---
As far as I remember Trapper wanted to surpass his father, he was more cruel to their workers than his father and he ended up killing him.
---
Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, Nurse's Calling, Enduring and Discordance are pretty good.
---
Me too, but we are special
---
#MAY ALSO BE UNLOCKED AT THE SHRINE OF SECRETS
---
How do you know Nea hasn’t killed anyone yet? 
---
So, ojomo/wraith killed the initial dude out of fear and anger, kinda like the nurse/sally. I don't think anyone except maybe susie was *forced* to kill pre dbd. And even then, they're all trapped and forced to by the entity now^(though some enjoy it), so the last tier seems kinda like a wash. 
---
OINK.
---
Oink!
---
No one deserves to be harassed by a rabid Youtuber fanbase because  they got salty in a lobby. This is Ochido fan-level behavior.
---
I just love the frantic shaking no survivor followed by a slow nod from Bubba and then BAM! XD
---
Indeed
---
Speaking of reports, should we report moonwalk legion as abuse of uninteded mechanics?
---
The add-on's called Glass Bead - it adds a secondary action to the map that allows you to mark a location for your team. It's basically a more common version of the Crystal Bead, which lets your team see everything you can see when the map is in use.
---
I actually almost prefer the Glass Bead, since it can let you communicate specific objectives to your team.
---
Fuck yeah
---
I think he was saying the exact opposite. Survivor finds it take the escape. Killer finds it, do gens. Dont see how that is throwing a game.
---
The whole tactic of Sabo is to use it to deny hooks and force escapes, it's not being an ass in any way, it's a tactic that takes time for a risked reward and should be more powerful as a means to encourage time wasting over just doing gens.
---
By removing the ability to 99% a hook, you remove any power Sabo holds, as nobody has time to sabotage a hook in front of a killer carrying a survivor unless it is close to completion. Sabo needs changes sure to make it more viable, but removing any power it has for a minimal reward will just cause killers to slug anyways as when they realise they have no hooks, they just won't hook and will find a new target in a safe spot with actual hooks, only wasting a survivors time more than the killers
---
I don’t believe the 6% penalty applies to ruin skill checks but don’t quote me on that. Regardless, you’d want huntress lullaby for the build instead of ruin because once you get the ball rolling those doctor skill checks with no noise warning and unnerving presence practically guarantee 16% regression every time they get a skill check.
---
Distance d00d
---
It's lag. Drop the pallet earlier and you'll be right
---
Imagine if we did not have the brief invurenability added a few patches back, this awesome lucky moment could not have happened.
---
#justiceforwraith
---
Try on rank reset. That's really my only suggestion.
---
Didn’t trapper enjoy his fathers brutal regime?
---
Feng got that “the bell doesn’t dismiss you I do” look on her face 
---
David is hardest for me. As for killer, all of them because I suck.
---
Yeah, if you don't need the audio notifications from something like Technician (or you're running an alert-heavy perk like Spies - which is also good now), Surveillance is incredible.
---
Years ready I had 3 man swf whose names were “sister (insert name here)” all we’re Laurie’s 
---
Can Myers have 4 obssesions when this happens? Kappa
---
Yes
---
This skyrockets hostage builds into the fucking stratosphere
---
Love that meme 
---
Yeah if you wanna stick around to help dont stand in the exit gate. You will be forced out so what is the point of even staying to help.
---
It basically means you keep going after one survivor, while simply ignoring all the other survivors until the tunneled survivor is dead. 
---
Nah I’ve seen that colour of the names usually doesn’t matter 
---
Rin-chan 😢
---
I doubt she ever could, since yannow, she died.
---
I feel that Wraith and Spirit have a similar story.
---
 the spirit's father was getting corrupted by the entity and was it's original pick but when she died she ended up getting it's attetion through shear revenge rage.
---
 Meanwhile Azarov was trying to contact the entity (we know this from the description of the Blood Lodge) however the wraith ended up killing him and through the despair he felt he was pulled in and made a killer
---
Jokes like these are the best. Same with Quintin players trying to sell meth.
---
its the same when playing Legion.
---
Had 1 game yesterday where the survivors just stops in a Circles and farmed themselves.
---
And another, where (they probably were bad) just messed up so hard that they didnt even got a Single gen.
---
Thats really annoying as I want to try out how much Thanataphobia, Sloppy and Ruin together can slow the game down 
---
Why? I thought the totem spawns there were horrendous. 
---
New survivor: Rin's father.
---
Perks: Scummy shit - 80/90/100% debuff to everything
---
Murderous bastard - Altruistic actions damage the target by one health state
---
Miserable twat - All survivors within 10/20/30m get a 50% fov reduction and a dark filter applied to the screen.
---
Backstory: Same as Rin's but from 'dad POV'. Entity sucks him up as he's fleeing into the woods specifically so Rin can be teased with him and kill more in the name of a revenge that is in sight but unobtainable.
---
He meant ultra rare.
---
Yeah, I understand
---
To make it more sad, they could have made it so she sees each survivor as her father during the Mori animation.
---
Isn't the clown heavily implied to be one too?
---
Kick a hook to fix it??? 
---
he'd eat it
---
Salty Survivors call a lot of things "tunneling." What most players take issue with is a Killer repeatedly targeting the first Survivor they hook until they're dead. While this is in no way against the rules, it's frustrating because the person it happens to gets no points for the match and - if they're playing SWF - now have to wait for their friends to finish the Trial before they can play again.
---
It's considered especially bad form if - after one Survivor unhooks another near the Killer - the Killer chases down the player who just got farmed by their "friend." Again, not against the rules, but incredibly frustrating for the player it happens to. Not only are they one step closer to death, but the little dickhead who farmed them probably gets away scot-free.
---
Slap a remote control to fix it
---
Makes sense
---
Just some animation to make the sabo regress, like gens can be regressed to 0 from being kicked.
---
Bing Bong death has come
---
I would say that the Nurse was forced. Both her lore and item descriptions seem to suggest there was some serious abuse or mistreatment happening at the asylum. 
---
Something can be good and also be one of the worst. Trapper is RNG heavy but has the potential to win games without even swinging at someone, Legion can chase better then wraith and Bubba is super underrated.
---
The simple fact is: Wraith's power does nothing for him in a chase, and doesn't compensate enough to be worth the downside of being a M1 killer during the most important part of the game.
---
[Here's a link](https://i.imgur.com/F7C8gFo.jpg) to what you're referring to.
---
I’m new, why does everyone not like legion? Just curious. 
---
Relatable lol
---
Man this reeks of sadness... if it’s that triggering then just run enduring or something man, and flashlight squads aren’t even hard to deal with anyways. Just bait the pickup and get ur free hit or run lightborn if you really don’t feel like doing anything

He’s too slow and breaks game mechanics when he jumps over pallets
---
Where is the Bee?
---
There is a reason for the Legion’s power, their in game bio says ‘Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse took over Frank.’ As in, a feral frenzy.
---
I love the saw movies but man is the philosophy of the antagonists really silly. 
---
Jigsaw: I believe life is sacred, so I’m going to torture and kill people who don’t appreciate their lives enough. 
---
Amanda: I’m going to end their suffering, but first I’ll put them through unimaginable horror. 
---
He has mud on his face that is essentially a mask for him.
---
Usually someone who was hooked first gets killed first. They may accuse you of tunneling but that is how the game usually works. 
---
Not sure about his appearance actually! I don’t think it really explains that one in his bio. Unfortunately the wraiths backstory struck me as one of the most nondescript as far as actual explanations go.
---
I feel like there should be another tier somwhere "litterly turned insane"
---
Both hillbilly and nurse fit there, as both of them took a lot of mental abuse and then snapped, becoming insane, and killing due to their insanity. Dont know who else should be there though
---
Blood warden buff.
---
I’ve started playing with it to find all the new hidy holes for the totems 
---
I thought we all had agreed that the Trapper was a good guy and did gens for the survivors...
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
N-NANI!?!?
---
please do not green arrow when you are outside of the Taiwanese underwater basket-weaving forums, it is bad form and activates my inner manchild, and then inner manchilds of many others.
---
To stay on topic, just you wait. I had a game on the swamp last night that lasted at least half an hour because the last two people decided they didn't want to do the last 2 gens. They literally just hid in the fog because they were both claudette. I finally found them and killed both of them but it didn't feel like a victory.
---
what *did* feel like a victory was typing "gg ez" then leaving immediately.
---
Honestly? If NOED gets removed with it, I’d consider it. 
---
Sabo is a fucking stupid strategy anyways. As a Killer, you don’t have the ability to destroy generators, because that would be stupid. Survivors should not be able to 99 a hook and then cheat a Killer out of his or her kill later. 
---
What a cutie :)
---
I guess, but it does tell us where their power comes from; therefore a reasoning for their power.
---
You could have gotten the evil incarnate achievment! Why'd you let her go?
---
Should've joined him. There's another hole at killer's height.
---
Missing meg but almost 100% accurate otherwise cause ping is missing as well
---
In the words of a man much better at video games than me: "Don't get hit".
---
Juking the chainsaw is an art, there is no easy way to waste billy's time, which is why he is one of the best. You can't really cheese him, you just have to practice and get better at the game.
---
Oof the timing
---
Bing Bong.
---
I forgot about that, shit
---
My team and I have the worst luck when it comes to Borrowed time. 
---
hiding would be good
---
As a killer main, it's very satisfying to see a survivor T-bagging their dying teammate
---
Boo this man
---
Because you don't always get the chance to do this. Why so serious? It's alright to have fun once in a while
---
Yeah but his environment was that he was abused and tortured, so he was mentally scarred as well as physically disfigured
---
I literally “awww’d”. That is just too sweet. If that was during the game, what did you end up doing after?
---
That’s pretty deep and true ngl. 
---
Really like this explanation over the bio that Behaviour wrote
---
8 seconds for 1 totem. If all survivors cleanse them, the Noed will be deactivated in no time.
---
This is a place for people to discuss a game. Go take your toxicity elsewhere lol
---
i would put lisa lower since she was deadass eaten by cannibals
---
Well, that was the point. To nerf it. It will always be very good perk or absolute shit. This way we are making it situational and adding a little bit of "skill"(hard skill checks). Making both ends  meet somewhere in the middle-good perk if you manage to hit all the skill checks and bad perk if you mess up.
---
I guess you’re right, but it’s still pretty nondescript. It tells us nothing more than “the entity gave them the power of agility/bloodlust.” Okay, so there’s very little distinguishing their “power” from 99.9% of serial killers? Just seems like a lazy explanation to me.
---
Bong bing
---
Where's the loading screen?
---
In order to kill something freddy needs to catch up someone first :/
---
yup, had this happen forever ago. jist had to tap gens
---
Why would I use a perk slot to nerf my other hex perks? Why use Ruin for the last 3 gens when I can use it for the entirety of the match?
---
That would give survivors more times to cleanse the dull totems, potentially killing my hex perk.
---
Pussy move
---
kekekek :D
---
&gt;You know I completely forgot that the broken status effect existed... Decisive applying broken? 🤔
---
&gt;As for not knowing, yeah I can see that point but at the same time if Behaviour find a way to make the perk less obnoxious then maybe we wouldn't need to do all of these things to deal with the perk.
---
Reworking DS would be a dream but BHVR has been tiptoeing around it so much I am starting to doubt it will ever happen. Since they can't decide what to do, showing when more than one DS is in play would be a nice QOL of change. 
---
Remember, the discussions about DS and hatch changes got really heated when Clown was being released. Ever since they haven't done anything or even attempted to. That is 3 mid chapter patches (clown mid chapter, spirit mid chapter and legion mid chapter) and 3 full chapter patches now (third chapter happening in the next weeks). 
---
If this is you, you're a shit teammate
---
&gt;Opens locker to hide from Legion.
---
&gt;Theres another fucking legion the locker.
---
&gt;"The fuck you lookin at"
---
Idk how to upload videos I’ve tried (I’m on xbox) 
---
&gt;Remember, the discussions about DS and hatch changes got really heated when Clown was being released.
---
Must confess that I haven't been playing the game around that time. I started playing a few weeks before spirit came out. 
---
Sucks that behaviour aren't doing anything about things the community have been complaining about for months though, they need to up their game... Literally...
---
Yeah I totally agree BBQ should be the first to unlock. Just it's not certain he will get T3 before he runs out of BP so itd be smarter to get T3 with Bubba cos its guaranteed then spend BP on teachables he would want in the long run
---
Looks like the typical overly altruistic survivors. Swarming the hooked one instead of just getting out.
---
Always 
---
Just as unbalanced as decisive strike insta heals and gen rushing 
---
the reason pallets are useless now. get hit through them 60% of the time.
---
lol that was just karma for her but it's seriously annoying when it happens as surv
---
Halloween has a novelisation, a few of the movies have them, but the first one explicitly says he's sexually aroused several times before striking (in the first movie) so yah
---
Just so I’m on the same page, the R exploit you’re talking about is the one where you spam drop to avoid a flashlight blind? 
---
This is why a lot of streamers, when knowing a name shows up, will actually have to say “Do not send messages to this person or go after them”. That’s pretty sad if someone has to teach their own fans how to be decent people. I always wonder if it actually stops people from doing it though. 
---
i think she wanted to vault the window lol
---
Bing Bong!  
---
(wraith is such a cutie god damn &lt;3 \^\_\^)
---
If a survivor is breaking hooks instead of doing gens, then you've won 9/10.
---
Not knowing where the killer is after you dead'ard is the most nerve-racking part. How did he not catch you? 
---
that was no where near the point of this post
---
Lol this is so relatable. I had TWO survivors do this to me, though, not just one. I finally enabled Whispers after that game because I had spent so much time looking for them just to learn they were both hiding in lockers in the corner of the map. 
---
They were not nice to me after the match, unfortunately. They were trying to get me to me to DC.
---
Devs could be on there too tbh great point 
---
See, that's why when I see someone fucking up in an online game now, I just assume they have no idea what they're doing. 
---
Waiting for the day Freddy won't be bottom tier anymore :/
---
Agreed BC IT IS ACCURATE IN MOSTEST 
---
👏🏻stop👏🏻sand👏🏻bagging👏🏻teammates👏🏻
---
i don't have enduring yet so i just use spirit fury, still works well. 
---
But then Ruin would get his power halfed and the survivors can easily either cleans all 5 totems, killing the perk, or knowing where they are , so as soon as Ruin poos they go to that place and cleanse it. That's what I do with NOED. And it takes a perk slot. 
---
I don't see any reason to use it unless you're running aan All Hex build, and even then TotH is better because it lets you find a survivor.
---
The man you can see in the meme is Leontxo García, a famous spanish chess writer/journalist. Is he known worlwide? I'm really surprised I got to find him in the DbD reddit lol.
---
Have gotten hate before for bringing franklins and lightborn despite no items/flashlights being brought in by the survivors, what a pleasant surprise it was for them when they found that flashlight. Always come prepared for the unknown unknowns! 
---
Yes, officer, this post right here. 
---
The vast majority of new players are scared and don't know what to do, which is why the killers that derank to 15 are such a problem...it ruins the game for noobs.
---
As if what the leatherface was doing there was skillful.
---
well those perks(sloppy and thanatophobia) have insanely good synergy with him so I wanted to try that. 
---
And you can definitley win a Chase against him, its just harder, similar to nurse
---
I don’t know why, but I find this very wholesome.
---
Killers that are OP at rank 15.
---
Bing bong boi
---
*After spending so much time in the fog many learn to look past the horrors, but rather for an escape*
---
[Nice](https://media.tenor.com/images/f1a791b4774a32f7aaf18b13cb7c5f7b/tenor.gif)
---
When I first started playing I had a similar experience as the Nea in your story. The main difference, however, wasn't that I was too scared to move, I just wasted like 20 minutes trying to find the damn hatch. I was genuinely wandering around trying to find it but my dumb ass never found it. 
---
Eventually the killer found me and just dumped me on the hatch and I thanked them for solving my incompetence. 
---
If it isn't lag then you should be dropping the pallet earlier anyways. If you don't want to risk it, drop it before it could get to that point.
---
The killer swing must cross a point on the pallet for it to hit a survivor when thrown down. The killer, having 0 ping due to hosting, has the true location of players due to being the server, that means if the bullshit is able to connect, it's because the survivor sent the drop pallet message too late into the loop that the server won't reach it in time, if the survivor dropped it preemptively and factors ping, they can drop the pallet without risk. 
---
does it matter? still relevant. they sent the message first, they're just as bad as a salty p3 claudette. 
---
If killers get bloodlust without filling a perk slot, survivors should get borrowed time without filling a perk slot.
---
Yeah but with Nurse you need skill. Legions power is brainless
---
Pretty funny.
---
Bingbong
---
because not everyone is obsessed with winning. some of us like to fool around and enjoy it for once
---
Speaking as a faulty new player, I agree to this. I suck at looping and often get stuck with teamates who don't do gens at all, so I rarely get an escape as a survivor, and I can never find that damn hatch either. 
---
Mori rework pls
---
Who’s your friend that likes to play?
---
Hmm....
---
I tried to Main nurse a few Seasons back and after getting to rank 1 rather Quick and after getting used to the TP Range/chargetime etc.
---
She was extremly easy....IMO not harder to play than Legion 
---
i tried to get my sister to play dbd once, she screamed in pure panic everytime the terror radius came up. She refused to look to the killer so she had no idea where was he coming or where to go. i was trying to tell her 'look back so you can see where he is, it's better if you know where he is so you can come up with a route to escape'. she screamed in panic ' I DON'T WANT TOO LOOK AT HIM'. i'll never forget it , man i miss the time dbd brought that out on me as well. i miss the panic. that hit me right in the feels.
---
I partially feel Spirit arguably could've been a survivor, though I can't imagine what her perks would be.
---
I always love seeing posts like these because it just screams to me that y'all probably either haven't played killer outright or just very little. Killer's PoV is a lot different from a survivor's. They have very little peripheral vision. 
---
If killers get weapons, my level one Dwight should get a pool noodle so the huntress and I can fight on even ground.
---
I can't remember for sure if the cop had any, but Amanda has the reverse bear trap that was inescapable and the guy who was shacked through his wrists/ankles/jaw and had to rip the chains off of his body before the bomb went off. He couldn't have feasibly ripped his jaw off and even if he did, the door was welded shut so he was never going to escape either.
---
And she hums the same song on repeat, the one her mother would sing. She's definitely a bit off in the head.
---
Sometimes you can just feel the NoEd in your gut. Trust your gut. Cleanse all totems. 
---
yeah he seems completely irrationally angry /s
---
Another killer main that needs training wheels.
---
Good point. Well I don’t know how to argue my point anymore so, you get the win my good sir/ma’am 
---
It happens on both sides, but it hurts the survivor side more.  Almost nothing but 4ks down there. They should really raise the skill floor for killers, too, as this really turns off a lot of new players.  If I hadn't grinded out 200 hours, I never would have gotten into the game.

Remember, the downvotes are because you’re right.

You're supposed to lose your offering when you 'burn' it but losing your items is bullshit. That's not really fair in any capacity, even if it's just a yellow toolbox. (They have more charges than some green and purple toolboxes)

The best thing you can do is just finish as many gens as possible... And don't bring self care.  Keep doing gens even while injured.
---
It doesn't matter when you did it.
---
Learn to keep your attitude in check instead of letting it get to you bad enough to assume the worst of people in a game like this.
---
You should know what will happen to your *precious* time before queuing up since new or bad players will liken Dead by Daylight to Hide &amp; Seek instead of "gen rush and GTFO or die".

WE NEED TO SAVE WRAITH
---
I'm pretty sure he just followed orders. He destroyed buildings(I can't remember if it was mineshafts) with people in it because his father was going crazy and told him to. He ended killing his father from what the lore implies.
---
I was spectating a game that I escaped in and my buddy was the last one.
---
Killer finds him (after a good battle of them trying the hatch/gates), downs and picks him up. We had the map trophy generator too so it sucked and then the killer walks over to the hatch and dumps him on it to escape.
---
Nice guy.

Thank you for your support.

Are you on PS4? 
---
Send me an inbox &amp; we can SWF. Me &amp; a friend play a lot. 
---
Seems we got a salty killed main here
---
Just my opinion, but watch the kill count of the Saw movies by the YouTube channel Dead Meat. James does a fantastic job at explaining the story of the Saw movies.
---
Why not bring self care? That’s like a must for me. Definitely my crutch if I’m being honest. 
---
Are u saying everyone is OP at rank 15?
---
This remind me of how I found 2 skeleton keys on 2 different matches from chests yesterday. Also them being broken is debatable, if you are not in SWF to let someone know you are opening the hatch then your team gets little value out of it. Also with how much killer's like to focus the guy with the key I say it's fine.
---
I honestly will never respect pallets as Huntress just bc I find her stun noise to be so entertaining
---
This is why camping isn’t healthy for the game. 
---
Kudos for actually doing the gen and leaving instead of fucking around.
---
I have to admit I kinda stopped doing stuff like that when I play killer. Whenever I do it, the survivors goof around the map for 15 more minutes wanting to drop every pallet on my head. They never take my time into account.
---
Like, do the goddamn gens. Sure, go ahead and loot a chest or two when you're done, but after that, please take your leave.
---
self care doesn't take that long....
---
bing bong
---
Damn I never realized it took that long, I’m usually too panicked making sure the killer doesn’t find me while healing to think about it. You’re right though, I’m a hider, not a good runner lol
---
i like to think there'd be a big climactic fight, with like david getting himself hooked to summon in the entity, then the survivors all gathering up against all the killers using the huntress' hachets against them (because they're in every locker) and attacking the entity. they have the number's advantage, so they could probabally do really good at it. after killing the entity from where it seals them, they'd likely reappear where the map was. (the macmillan estate, the red forest) the characters would likely create books, stories, and i'm sure feng would make a game. likely teaming up with a team of developers called BHVR, because of their idea for a game called DEAD BY DAYLIGHT, and bill? i don't know about bill. would he die? would he go back to the L4D universe? and what about tapp? he was dying when he came into the entity's realm. you can SEE bill's corpse in L4D2, so he's likely dead, and tapp maybe would have healed? who knows.
---
It’s really slow to just heal yourself with self care not even counting any perks or status effects that could be used against you. Can be doing generators or trying to pull off a save. If you have to have a healing perk take botany knowledge and a medkit it’s much faster. 
---
Doctor isnt necessarily a no skill needed killer but you dont need to know how to track to find survivors. Usually after he finds you it's just non stop zapping which is incredibly annoying to go against. His treatment mode can be countered but if he finds you right off the bat ot's hard to counter. Not all doctors just zap you into oblivion and those I dont mind plying against, but typically this is how people play doctor. People will dc because they dont feel like dealing with it and although dcing is shitty to do, if they dont qant to play that match it is their choice not to.

if we'll all stop wiping and griping and looking at our weapons after we hit one of this little scrubs , We'll propably kill them a lot faster
---
If the killer runs into you it just isn't tunneling
---
The Legion should be split in four. Or at least the leader should be in revenge and anger while the others are in fear and insanity. Didn't Frank kind of force the other three into killing?
---
Barely runs smoothly on relatively modern gaming desktops, so I'm going to say no
---
Kinda underpowered
---
LF should be revenge shouldn't he?
---
That may be the most fun part of playing with newer people - they’re so afraid of everything. If I get paired with new players we usually all die because I can only do so much by myself, but I totally get it. I remember feeling that way early on too
---
You know someone is gonna say it's a valid strategy
---
I usually run Bond instead. Not only is helpful even when I'm not injured, but I can find other people when I do want to be healed. 
---
Why are most of the posts in this sub stupid inside jokes?  This community is so nerdy and lame.  Feels like I'm at a fucking emo convention every time I visit this place.  Bing bong.

Ugh
---
I almost exclusively play survivor (got like 250 hours in the game now) and tbh I've seen the opposite to you after only about 20 hours of playing killer. There seems to be waaaay more deranked survivors than killers that have deranked. Although I also think it's way easier to spot a survivor with a lot of experience in the game than it is a killer. I got accused of deranking after like the 4th game EVER I'd played killer because I got a 4k.   
---
 Basically it's easier to get lucky as a killer than to get lucky as a survivor, so you can appear more skilled than you are (at least IMO). 
---
Either way I don't think it's a major issue on either side. DBD doesn't require too much skill (and a low skill ceiling) for both survivors and killers. I know that'll cause maybe a bit of controversy but I don't feel there's too much of a skill gap in ranks. It was mildly annoying playing at rank 19 against 4 teabagging claudettes that body blocked and used flashlights but it wasn't horribly tilting and gives a bit more of a challenge - plus it's more satisfying when you kill them haha
---
Unless you cleanse it then no, Hillbilly with his mobility and a faster install down option (not to mention faster moving speed) is the definition of overkill and is not to be laughed at.
---
Damn, def a "highlight reel" moment

If the game had a ending,I think think would be it. Well,one of them. How long did this take you?

I just had someone DC on me and send me a hate message because I had Franklin’s and he brought a purple tool box it’s one of my favourite perks
---
I was playing killer yesterday and one of the survivors said he reported me for farming because I let the last person get a gen on and trapdoor, I don't know if you can be banned for this now, but anybody who reports for letting the last survivor escape is just butthurt they got shit on.
---
yeah 
---
but then you have that salty fucker mssging you saying there gonna report you for blah blah blah 
---
Honestly if i notice a survivor turn around and look at me I'll feel bad for hurting them so I'll either look away, or depending on if I'm losing in terms of gen pressure, down them and leave. 
---
Especially if they're the last one/one of the last ones and they just give up
---
Doesn't legion already have the first perk by default? 
---
Freddy is sane, just really, really screwed up. And in a way that makes it worse.
---
Yeah self care only takes about 1/2 of a generator...
---
I don’t play as killer often but because of how much I play survivor I’m pretty adept. I’m probably a rank 16-17 killer and always get 4ks. I feel kind of bad but at the same time yikes free bloodpoints? 
---
Bing Bong ding dong. 
---
The last suggestion is already kind of in affect. You get more BP for doing a safe hook rescue than you do an "unsafe" hook rescue. IMO the time it takes to become a safe rescue is too short.
---
it would completely destroy the whole point of 99 hooks. And without it there would be almost no point at all to sabotage them
---
Yeah I only do that if they screwed me over first or if it's my friend lol
---
Had a game with my friend and we both had pig traps on our head, going for the same box, used dead hard to beat him to it. Best part? His was about to run out with it being the last jigsaw box he had to check and mine had just started ticking down with it being the first jigsaw box I had to check lmao
---
&gt;That's an assumption. I've put almost 2k hours into this game.
---
&gt;Then you keep running or drop it early on the previous loop. It won't hit if you keep running as you just said. If you're two bodies of distance ahead, then you can make the loop if the swing early and drop it if they approach the pallet even more.
---
&gt;Lag then attributes to a lot of these hits connecting also, because players drop pallets once they are much further beyond in greed to get the stuns.
---
&gt;It's lag or a misplay. If you can judge it's going to miss then you should keep running. If you wait out the pallet by being on the other side and they swing, unless latency is high, the pallet will drop and the survivor won't become injured.
---
Except bloodlust is a thing and you won't be able to go anywhere or even loop again if you don't dropp the pallet.
---
I am done with this convo since you keep talking about lag. I will repeat this one last time, you can easily reproduce these hits as a killer where no lag is involved, no misplay is involved. You just swing as the survivor is approaching a pallet and even if he was safe to drop it, it will hit. 
---
Pallets are bugged and the only people I see defending this are killer mains who only care about their side of the coin instead of wanting a fair environment. 
---
Have a good day.
---
But with Legion you don't have to predict what survivors will do. You literally just use your power or wait to use it until they throw down a pallete
---
I think he is a decent killer, but I can't find a viable reason to play him when I can just play billy and instadown at all times tbh.
---
Nice!
---
BING BONG NOOOOOOOOO!!!
---
To be fair there was an ad for it.
---
Just kill me or I'll DC if you refuse to kill me.  I hate farming rounds, boring AF, so if someone kills themselves on the hook.  They are probably of the same mind set.  I'm all about the chases in this game, thats the only exciting part of this game. 
---
So eh... why is the "community theme" for this sub so damn annoying?
---
I dont know if you noticed but the design is something straight out of /r/mildlyinfuriating and forces you to turn it off so you dont have to highligh the text to read it.
---
Ok
---
That hit you huh? 
---
That would have been awesome.
---
I know you are being sarcastic but the amount of players sweating for that last survivor is mind blowing. Watch us get downvoted for saying how fucking boring slugging for the duration of a bleed out is just so that you might get the last one as well. The worst of it was a boosted nurse against 2 immersed survivors. She tried slugging but she sometimes switched targets making it extra long. And when no one was found the 2 survivors were just hiding (making it even longer) like jeez do a gen and take that hook with pride. I got bored when it was getting close to the 15 minute mark but I really wanted to know how it ended. *Insert our battle will be legendary meme
---
For killer I agree; however, playing as a survivor I tend to want to stick by rank 1 as I more consistently find competent teammates around that rank.
---
That example explains what you mean well.
---
Wrong. Your skill may affect your preformance but some killers are objectively better than others
---
1. It's down to RNG and most of his power is just mindgaming survivors into not running good loops like shack
---
2. 4 hits.
---
3. He's shit- his chainsaw is very slow and the hitbox isn't that great
---
I have literally told you that bodyblocking and map pressure is what makes wraith good but you claim that 'it doesn't work on good survivors' despite you never actually having tried it. It works. Watch someone actually effectively bodyblocking like ScottJund or sth.
---
The moment I can, I'm wearing this outfit.
---
I think he would be perfect if he started out with at least 2 traps, maybe 3. Of course this would have to be tested. And maybe a new way to collect traps, instead of having to traverse the entire map (and only being able to carry one with his base load out now)
---
Both should be removed from the game.
---
Insta heals should be removed.
---
Anything that makes any killer way too OP should be removed.
---
I’d replace the hex: DC with something more practical. Maybe a perk that allows him to see survivor auras that are more than 4/3/1 metres away that’d be more balanced. For his special just give him the legions but make sure his weapon is an insta down then you’ve got the perfect killer, could do with some buffs in the future but we’ll leave that to the developers.
---
I didn't see the shitpost flair at first and was about to start a rant.
---
no no it's cool that's our supervisor :D a supervisor can not just wear the exact same as his team now can he ?
---
Bing bong.
---
Yeah I have seen it. But it’s sad they have to do that. People should just know. 
---
Moonwalking to hide your red glare is apparently cheating.
---
They want more shekels. 
---
yup
---
That is pretty dramatic. Not that long. Also, you aren't accounting for the time it takes to walk to a gen, the time spent seeking teammates, the time you take away from your team mates or the times spent standing still anyways because you are waiting for the killer to turn away. 
---
Additionally, not being injured allows you to push a gen more confidently. 
---
I swear by self care, and still manage to usually have the highest gen repair time.
---
**Bing**

Well im not talking about the movies

1. Sometimes when I get hooked and I'm fighting the entity, it kills me really fast even if I'm spamming the space bar. I thought I was doing it wrong and rebinded it to the mouse wheel, but it still happens sometimes. Am I doing something wrong or is it some game mechanic?
---
2. How do I see the killer's build?
---
3. Is staying hidden throughout the game , prioritzing gens and only saving teammates if it's safe a viable/decent playstyle?  
---
I'm new to the game, I've ranked up 4 times in 2 days playing like this, whereas before I wouldn't make it past 5 minutes and was this close to quitting.
---
4. Can I report a teammate for helping the killer kill me? (as in pointing at where I am and intentionally body blocking me for like 10 seconds until he can get to me)?
---
5.  Any tips for learning how to juke?
---
  
---
Flair checks out
---
Almost a pip in rank 12... 
---
That's the code. It doesn't matter if it is a dedicated server it not. Bhvr needs to change their decision on this.
---
I was killer and this one survivor messaged me after killing him because he was trying to do mind tricks that Ochido does and I wasn’t falling for it.
---
This.
---
Sabo is a fun and rare little tactic that requires a greatly coordinated SWF and isn't even that viable. Nothing to change here. It's always good to have a different game sometimes.
---
My question is: Why are you still there when everyone has escaped?
---
[ok](https://imgur.com/gallery/w4sboOo) 
---
PC here, I didn't even know that you can hear his breathing.
---
Great idea, might update it in the future.
---
Yep. Once I was playing with a friend we happened upon a killer who had de-ranked to get at new survivors. The only reason we know this was he had all the perks unlocked to level 3  and all perk slots unlocked. We all had only 2 perk slots unlocked and the perks were all at level 1's on them. He was salty as can be because we happened to get out and he started in on how all survivors are de-ranked level 1's. We were like dude we don't even have 3 perk slots unlocked yet and our perks are level 1 perks. You, on the other hand, had every perk slot and those perks are rank 3. He had BBQ 3, Dear Stalker 3, Whispers, and Noed 3 not to mention an ebony mori.
---
That's what noob killers do. They just don't want to let others have fun. Assholes.
---
LOL Okay. I honestly don't remember but it's cool.
---
To get the hatch obviously
---
What does SMH mean
---
Pro-Killer tip: Stop caring about what salty survivors say or do, just enjoy the game and make sure to throw some ggez's in the post-game when they cry. 
---
(Likely to be) Unpopular Opinion: Nurse is boring
---
skill floor for killers is already much higher than survivors foh
---
Don't blame the daily. Blame the killer. Just because the game gives you a daily doesn't mean you gave to do it. It's not like you can't play the game if you don't complete the daily.
---
Good game ruins by optimization on console.

I've found that the best way to get better at running is play as Laurie and bring her default build. Hiding is not an option if you end up looking in the direction of the killer, meaning you'll have to get better at looping and juking

---
How canonical are these novelizations? 
---
Really? No. That would be downright awful.
---
“Environment” implies their surroundings coaxed them into becoming murderers. I put him with Spirit and Hag because they all feel more like victims. Leatherface’s family turned to cannibalism; the Hag just happened to be cannibal adjacent. For Hillbilly, being disfigured was the raw deal that changed the course of his life. 
---
When I read the lore about rins dad. It seems like the entity was making him insane. In a livestream by the developer's, the entity planned to take rins father as a new killer, but the entity saw bigger potential in rins anger than in her father's insanity. 
---
It obvoously doesn't work if Huntress is camping 20m away with her hatchet ready, as her lullaby radius doesn't activate BT
---
If I play with any friend there's a 50% chance each match that I will fuck them over somehow. Honestly, I think it's made them better players!
---
one time, a teammate ran up to the generator i was working on, and just DROPPED a firecracker adn ran to a locker. it was a leatherface too, and when they ran up i did the follow me emote, and they understood me! i went to their locker and pointed at it. they instantly got hooked and nobody saved them because they saw what he did. 
---
Yeah but that’s the thing. Unless the killer is a complete buffoon, the chances of this happening are extremely rare. Game mechanics should not be changed simply because you want the chance of getting a good video to put on a public forum.

The best nurse player will always outplay the best trapper player
---
1. Yes. But the mere fact good loops are a no-go gives you an edge in chases, not to mention the random traps that can catch people, and the defensive abilities when it comes to totems, hooks and gens. Still better than Wraith.
---
2. Yes. But an almost garunteed free first hit and the ability to vault pallets, slow the game a bit with Deep Wounds, and has diet BBQ and Chili. Better than Wraith.
---
3. Yes. But it also instadowns which means he demands respect in dead zones, he can force pallet drops, and is very good when pallets are gone. Better than Wraith.
---
Bodyblocking is very reliant on the maps, and on survivors putting themselves in a position to be bodyblocked, and on survivors not noticing you moving into position. It *can* work, but it often doesn't, and when it does it only gives you 1 hit. Wraith does not have map pressure, because Wraith chases are long. He cannot both pressure gens and get hooks. Yes, he can start chases nearer to the survivor. No, that is not as good as most of the other killers' utility.
---
haha!

I’m trying to figure out where there’s a bridge lol

Maybe you need to practice more than. It can be hard if the survivors drop the palet on one side and then you're getting chased on that side, but overall, there are enough palets I'd say.

If they made the progression rate like 30x faster so I could catch up I would consider getting the Switch version. Since that's obviously not going to happen, I'll have to agree in not getting this.
---
Me too actually, I can’t remember there being a bridge anywhere... 
---
Yw and they changed that back during the 2.4.0 update if I remember correctly, I’m so glad they did it’s been a life saver! Plus I bought bubba to get the bbq perk mostly for the point gains but I would always see people in lockers before the update and sometimes just go stand in front of the locker until they came out and would let them run off. 
---
This is a comment that I can hear. 
---
That isn't something to do with the game, but your PC/console.
---
Normally all you have to do is plug in the USB adapter for the device and mess with your sound options a bit. But if you don't have an adapter, say wanting to use some random earbuds like with a phone, you're out of luck as PCs and consoles don't have blue tooth or nearly any wireless ability built in.
---
It all boils down to what headset your hardware. Not the game
---
I was playing as the Pig 🐷
---
Had this happen in a game against doc. 3 gens in a straight line. Doc had overcharge, ruin, and overwhelming presence. Couldn’t do gens for 7 mins. 3 players left. Eventually I did the gen by myself and whaddya know last perk was Noed. One surv went down, one left by the door and I took the hatch.
---
Shakin my head
---
I'm tempted to make my permanent build Franklin's for items, Ruin for gens, Enduring for pallets and DS, and STBFL for DH. Even if they have no items or those perks, I'd be ready for them. 
---
I'm a new player and played against Freddy for the first time a couple of days ago. For some context, and I'm a horror movie junkie and Freddy has always been my favourite psycho. I've watched his movies countles of times.  
---
I was geniunely scared to death the entire match, because it was almost personal, almost like if  I was experiencing what I had seen as an spectator so many times.   
---
That game was fun, but i was so frightened that it is a bit of  blur haha. Fortunately my teammates carried me, also I spent 90% of the game in the dream world too.
---
There are more deranking survivors because there are more survivors.  The skill floor is what the problem is - it's just too low for killers, making it really hard for new survivors to get into the game.  I bet if you look at median time playing this game for ALL players, it's fewer than 10 hours.  Mean is going to be upwards of 100+.  That would be telling.

The Struggle option doesn't slow your death on hook it just delays it enough for someone to come get you. You cant see the killers build until the match is over due to a recent patch. but if you play the game enough you can tell what the killer is running without it. As for play style play the game how you want and if you want to get better a jukes I would watch some streamers and youtube. If your teammates are helping the killer find you or are body blocking you in a corner so the killer can get you yes you can report them.

Sometimes I wonder if they're farming me or they're just terrible at in-game decision making.

Was playing against a Hag and had an Ace and Kate ( I think they were together) come to the hook to rescue me. Ace pulled me down, started healing me. Kate uncrouches for some reason and triggers the trap which gets me slapped right back on the hook. She then proceeds to try and unhook me like ten feet from the Hag which gets me hooked and sacrificed immediately.

When I play games that have a karma system (Fallout 3, Walking Dead) I like doing evil runs, so I just pretend they are NPCs that I have angered. *[Claudette will remember that]*
---
I responded elsewhere in this thread, but basically several reasons:  
---
You don't learn to play as fast.  Rely on dead hard and iron will to get you through the game.  
---
You're not doing gens while you're healing.  Yes, you will live a little longer, but your team will die AT THE SAME RATE, and they will be dead before you've finished gens.  
---
There are medkits in a pinch.  And teammates.  And you get more points from healing with the team and doing gens.
---
nurse is strong and all but pig can t-bag
---
just fuckin' megazoom on freddies face plz
---
Well look who the Nea dragged in!
---
Yes. He and piggy in crouch have a distinguishable loud breath, really helps.
---
Do you really need to see the shitpost flair to realise that it's a joke
---
Survivors wonder why killers run noed....
---
Yep, PS4. I was playing with a hag who set like 50 traps around whoever they hooked so I was unfortunately on my last hook. We had a few gems left so it wasn’t really early. I was going to message the killer at the end but they had the messages turned off so I let my teammate know that I got stuck on the way to get them instead. :/ Dying early on in the game seems a lot better than being stuck for as long as you said though. Can’t remember which map it was.
---
How about the thing that as long as you are injured the game blasts your ears with so loud music that at least i will only notice the heartbeat way after it started giving the killer an easy down.
---
My main problem with playing survivor right now isn't even the hitbox,even though they are really wonky right now, but rather me being chased all game then being insta-downed by the killer because he lost the game just to get me hooked. 
---
Is that not the point of OP playing normally up until one would die? The survivors have no knowledge that they're even farming until the end game essentially.
---
did you use each killer? 
---
Doesn't Nurse (and to some extent, Huntress) also ignore pallets and windows altogether? Doctor always knows where all the survivors are just from normally using his power, too, and to an even greater extent since Survivors are permanently affected by Madness, causing illusionary Docs and screams to give away their location at any time. I really fail to see why people would rather complain about the new Killer when in fact other Killers share some of Legion's qualities and traits. 
---
The one thing that I do understand is all the healing that Legion forces Survivors to do, but even that is part of his kit, just like other Killers can slow the game down with their powers (Pig, Nightmare, Doctor), not to mention that the effects of the power can be reduced by some Survivor perks (Autodidact, Botany Knowledge) just as some other Killer' powers can be limited by the use of other Survivor perks (Calm Spirit vs Clown and Doctor, Iron Will vs Spirit, Sprint Burst vs literally any ambush/stealthy Killer).
---
 As annoying as Legion is, I see no reason as to hate on them since other Killers are able to do what Legion can in a more efficient manner. In fact, I'm convinced that people just don't like Legion only because he wastes too much time since they're just not that good at securing kills.
---
The game doesn’t run on Mac, so you would need boot camp to use the windows os
---
i agree. it's a gamebreaking killer. no counter other than praying for her to be awful at tracking and somehow lose her, if she sees you and shes good at predicting movement you're pretty much done. there is no leverage, far away? she blinks. looping structures? she blinks. pallets? c'mon now. if it's a nurse main you're screwed. games vs nurses dont feel like dbd imo. 
---
B-bi-b-b-bin-bing bo-bing bong
---
in the groaning storehouse there's a bridge on the upper level
---
obviously, and hopefully they do
---
I've got a buddy that plays on a pretty old macbook air and it runs just as well as it does on my two year old gaming pc. The game doesn't take that much to run so you'd probably be fine.
---
No but when I open the exit gates and someone goes down I always think "please be dead on hook" because if they aren't there's no moral dilema on whether or not to go for the save
---
I dropped a firecracker once when the whole team was working on a gen together. It was the first time I ever had one, and I guess I forgot for a moment and thought I was about to activate a toolbox. I felt so bad, but at the same time I was laughing my ass off. At least I waited for the killer to come and chase me. 
---
i haven’t played killer you’re right,  it was still funny though :)
---
it’s funny though!
---
Needs some work but i think this will work! Great concept 👍
---
Idk, maybe I'm weird whether its 3v1 or 2v1, hell, even 1v1, I try my best to survive. If I die, whatever, on to the next, if I live, I feel like a champ for surviving against the odds (until OP comes along and tells us that he let us leave lmao).   
---
Point being, the game is what you make of it. If you tell yourself that you're always gonna have a bad time in 3v1's etc. then you absolutely will. I say the same thing to people who refuse to go against certain killers or refuse to play against swf etc. 
---
Lvl 15 survivor main there lol
---
Happened to me yesterday, I was debating putting a video up since it was me out running nurse the entire game, but it didn't feel right for me to do that. I don't know. Still might do it.
---
That would certainly be nice. I would not complain. That would waste less time with having to push for area control in the early game and would make Hex: Ruin less crucial than it is. 
---
And while I know it's never coming back, I miss the old setting animation even if it was slower. Just imagine that taking only 1.5 seconds with Fastening Tools equipped. 
---
Why. I hate teammates like this
---
Removed for party thread please post /r/dbdLFG
---
Bong Bing 
---
And some counterplay to his kit as well since rn he is weak but has no counterplay meaning he cant get buffed either.
---

---
*sigh*
---
...Bing Bong
---
Not just that. The outfit description for Rubber and Hooks basically describes the metal piercing his skin as a way to channel his rage. 
---
That was the most satisfying thing I've ever read.
---
Do you know why they did it though? It's not like they were the last one left and wanted to get the hatch...?
---
Just remove the killer
---
Look, I'm with you, DS and NOED are not balanced in their current state. I generally let it be tho, because both survivors and killers have a perk like that. Essentially, survs can use a perk like DS so long as killers can use a perk like NOED. If you find that all of your survs are being absolute toxic shit buckets, then run NOED for a few games and let off some steam. 
---
The only time I do that is when they pull me off the hook in front of the killer. If I'm able to get away, I just ignore that player the rest of the match. 
---
we love those types of survivors :)
---
In 3 v 1 matches, the survivors pretty much have zero chance of winning, unless the Killer is just terrible at the game.  I want a challenge as a killer, dont spoon feed me.  I want to play against SWFs, I want to be body blocked, I want to see flashlight saves, I want to see how well you can loop me.  Pretty much 99% of the people who play this game consider "toxic" actions, I want to see it all as a killer.  Give me a challenge
---
Yeah and they think class photo isnt too good because it adds 2 seconds more. Like transition isnt even relevant 
---
isn't there some lore for Michael saying he's cursed and has to hunt down his family or something to be free
---
At least gives survs a notification of this so they know what to expect and can try at prevent the best they can.
---
Ssshhh, people here are okay with ragequitting games.
---
nope. not even a single person was downed, or even hurt. they were a rank 17, so they at least knew what they were doing. this happened like yesterday, so it wasn't a new prospect from the event. i don't feel like they'd just do that on accident after at least 20 hours and an event's worth of possible experience with the firecrackers. and then, who knows. (we won the match afterwards, BTW. killer was really nice.)
---
Bing Bong!
---
And I'd try to give you hell, even in a 3v1 my friend, because I don't just quit because there's less of a chance of me winning.
---
Considering how long they're taking for DS/hatch/freddy changes I wouldn't count on them changing legion anytime soon, even if they are aware changes are needed
---
You cannot buy two perks in the same bloodweb though.
---
I want you to know that I down voted, but only because you're right. lmaoooo
---
I disagree. When you're a new player, you need that health state as much as possible because you're likely going to be surprised by the killer and take a hit.
---
cool
---
Everyone cries about the 1 hit down from noed and sure, it’s useful. But you know what’s better? Haste. I’ll run every single movement speed increase perk that’s viable you give me. Most killers except trapper and billy can’t close the gap without use of a skill and most skills have a downside. Imma run you down and stab ya.
---
I was the friend. I approve of this message.
---
rank 20s are new and still have shame 
---
Definitely not a big deal but surprised I managed it haha
---
that is why i always look behind when i go out a window as killer lol
---
I don't play survivor much so this looks like a pretty good juke.
---
Stridor can be detrimental if you’re not careful,survivors may sound closer than what they really are,not my fav pick
---
Personally I prefer whispers+prayer needs to get many grabs
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ) should be helpful. The guy is one of the best killer players the game has and the video is insanely helpful in general
---
 Bing bong
---
Bing Bong for you spooky boi.
---
Larry doing the carry?
---
Absolutely!  Getting cocky after finishing all gens without deaths is what get's me to red rank with Piggy or Trapper.
---
that. that right there? that is inspiration.
---
It any good?
---
Thank you  :)

I don’t get how sandbagging is bannable. Frowned on sure, but it’s supposed to be a survival game. Part of that is self preservation. 
---
Oh, uhm, well, the UI is the same
---
I caught him trying to be a survivor. 
---
STBFL for dead hard? Is dead hard really that annoying for a killer?
---
They said on the notes that bodyblocking, and face camping aren't bannable offenses I thought. Only like lag switching, hacking, and yes, assisting the killer against your teammates. 
---
Once I found the hatch, jumped for joy... And couldn't get in it.
---
Then the Wraith materialized out of thin air. I was so pissed at his level of douchebagery, I ran, and we got into a chase that I quickly lost, and I died
---
🅱ing 🅱ong
---
I meant ranking up, not leveling up. As I understand it, self-heal does not help you in ranking up. Maybe you can correct me.
---
And regarding your edit: this is a conversation, my dude. Lighten up.
---
Nice work!
---
The one thing in dbd that needs to be fixed is LF being able to camp hooks with no repercussions (his insta down swings negate bt) 
---
I'm so glad you managed to beat him.
---
I showed you my bell pls respond
---
Had a friend tell me of a similar experience.
---
Random Guy: "What?" (This was a reply to a question my friend asked a year ago at the time, the question being "Do you wanna play DBD?')
---
Friend: "Little late there bud."
---
Random Guy: "... Wanna play Fortnite?"
---
Friend: "No Fortnite is dumb." (Friend actually plays Fortnite quite a bit, and me and a few other friends caught him on Fortnite after he said to is 'I'd rather lick the floor of the nearest Wal-Mart then play Fortnite again.)
---
Played a match last night against a pig. Pig couldn't catch any of us, I assumed she was running noed. When the last gen popped I went to the exit and left. I decided to spectate, the David was tea bagging the killer a few feet away from the exit and instantly went down, he was the only one to die. 
---
Ouch, well i do understand that games like that seem unfair to the killer, but from the survivor perspective it's pretty clutch, though they admittedly may have fucked  how often you get keys tbf. We are talking about BHVR after all.
---
Here’s the main difference between nurse and legion. 
---
Nurse takes skill. 
---
Legion requires you’re not a vegetable. 
---
If you want somebody with multiple personalities in the game, just get The Horde from Split.
---
Note that this assumes no purple or red addons
---
For all of those well versed in dbd scheduling, when might we expect a teaser trailer of the new chapter?  When would the PTB go live?  Chapter will most likely release mid march im imagining?
---
&gt;Did you take into account the time it takes to find a generator after you've healed?! 
---
Doesn't work that way. The way you put it, makes it seem that by choosing to heal with self care you are loosing on half a gen. That is absurd.
---
&gt;The time spent healing yourself 2-3 times is one generator.
---
Doesn't work that way.... it just doesn't. You compare self heal to getting healed by someone else which takes 2 bodies instead of one. Its not that different.
---
Iron will is great and under appreciated. It also has anti synergy with self heal so if you are going to take iron will then yes I'd not use self care. I think it may depend a bit on your opponent. If you are rank 1 and going against a lot of nurses then I'd definitely choose iron will over self care. You're just overstating the weaknesses of self care when you should be making a point for alternatives. Self care is great. The evasion perks you mentioned are in competition for self care. You'd pike those to fill out the blanks after you decided on your core perk/s.
---
&gt;The advantage of gen time cannot be overstated.
---
Sure... You are just making bad assumptions that using self care reduces gen time in any significant way.
---
Exactly. Both are perfectly legal which is why I thought it was hilarious this killer who played scummily thought otherwise 
---
I know. I started calling her Loretta cause I didn't know her name at first so I just kept doing it. She just looks like a Loretta to me. Lol
---
Fair play  :)
---
A month in...How you liking it so far?
---
New petition:
---
Don't do anything this guy says. Perks are not toxic. Tbagging, sandbagging, and being an asshole in endgame chat is toxic.
---
Report them through steam, not DBD. Report the account for harassment, give them the evidence, and then don't put your personal info into steam again, or turn your settings to private.
---
why are you still at rank 14
---
Except tunnelling can be a thing. For example, if you try to stand in front of a killer to make them chase you instead of someone else, yet they REFUSE to hit or even acknowledge you, no matter what you do.
---
Killers like that make me angry
---
They could suspect it. For example if I’m camping at the end game with hillbilly I just chainsaw the unhooked that way borrowed time is not effected.
---
Well i might reinstall but play as a survivor so i dont have to deal with that and i havent experienced high level killers but im harbage at the chase so ya know
---
I didn't expect a survivor main to complain about stealthiness.
---
It's always nice when a Myers main and a Loretta main have a moment. It's like it's always meant to be. 
---
As if Identity V is not enough..
---
I was playing a SWF match with one friend and two randoms against a Meyers. He was doing pretty good and had two kills before the final gen was completed, including the friend I was partied up with. We were down to one gen and the Claudette and myself were each on our last hook if we were to get caught. This Claudette did repair a single gen with my friend, but then she just crouched around the other edges of the map. She also made an unsafe rescue, resulting in the other random getting killed. My friend tells me that Claudette is camping the hatch so I find a gen in the corner of the map and begin working on it. As I’m repairing it, Meyers finds me and begins chasing me; while in the chase, he injures me and tiers up to 3. 
---
Let me tell you, I am not the best in chases, but I was absolutely godlike that match. It was amazing. I was looping tier 3 Meyers and pallet slamming him around the entire map. At one point, my friend yells to me that the Claudette is near - she’s behind the brick wall next to the pallet in front of me. I head directly for Claudette, using the pallet in the process. Michael breaks it, heads after me, and I turn the corner into the crouching Claudette. I run around her so Michael sees and then I keep running. Sure enough, Michael one hits her due to tier 3, picks her up, and hooks her in the nearby basement. I take the hatch that was around the corner from where she was downed. 
---
A total dick move, and I did feel bad because it turned out she was like level 16, but it was one of the proudest moments on DBD I ever had. My pet peeve is people camping the hatch when there are gens to be done or an exit gate to be opened. 
---
Poor piggy.
---
I can already hear the “RIN-CHAN” screaming from this picture.
---
I was actually incorrect, I did a double check and it used to be this way but that was removed a while back, it used to regen 33% faster.
---
Love it. Just realized I have a copy on Steam I couldn't get to run on my old PC so I'm gonna start trying that out. On PS4 atm. 
---
Because it does reduce gen time.
---
Don't spam notifications 
---
Instead of looping what should survivors do? 
---
It doesn't take 32 seconds...  It takes 24 seconds.  32 seconds would be 100% slower for self heal but it's only 50% so it's only 24.  It's an additional 8 seconds of healing for yourself.
---
Healing yourself up to full is pretty much always useful against everyone that isn't Legion.  Even against a billy or bubba if they are to insta-down you they still have to set it up to get you with the chainsaw and if you get a good loop going you can very well make it so they don't have much of a chance to use it and just go for the hammer swing.  As for Myers he can pop tier 3, but you also at the same time just forced him to pop tier 3 after you and at that point your main hope is to just waste as much of his time as possible so he only stabs you instead of potentially multiple people.
---
Being at full health is extremely useful since it does provide you second chances and against most killers in the game that second chance can easily equal 30+ seconds of chase time with a bit of thought of where you are going.  So in the end, what takes longer:  An extra 8 seconds to heal yourself or spending that 8 seconds running to a team mate to have them heal you up instead (Unless you bring a medkit of course).  That extra 8 seconds also means team mates doing their own thing instead of helping you which could be objective time.
---
8 seconds really isn't terribly long and the added safety net self care provides is amazingly strong, there is a reason it's used on pretty much every single person at high ranks unless they are going for something specific in their build.  It's never a bad perk to have unless you are running no mither for...  Some reason.
---
I will police the call
---
Pretty sure people dont go down with a chainsaw if they have borrowed ?
---
I notice that the term "Killer" is not defined. We can take it as in an individual that takes anothers life, but if we define Killers as something socially "Cool" than this list would not apply. If we used a similar term "Lady Killers" that term does not literally mean someone who kills women, but instead is able to seduce women for sexual acts more simply. This list would not apply to a fundamental level of this was the case. So my question is what does the term Killer mean in this context?
---
Just wanted to follow up on this after reading a bit more.
---
You said:
---
&gt;All actions you perform help you rank up because all actions give you points (including self heal).
---
I don't think this is accurate. First, not all points contribute to ranking up. There are two categories of points, as explained on the emblem wiki:
---
&gt;The Emblem System is a replacement for the Victory Cube for Killers and the old Bloodpoint-related Rank Mechanic for Survivors.
---
&gt; A Player's Rank is now decided by their performance in a Trial and independent of the Bloodpoints they gained.
---
Second, self-care does not contribute to emblem points. The emblem wiki you linked has no mention of self-care... only healing other survivors. The [wiki on bloodpoints](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints) does say that you get Survival points for Self-Healing, but this is different from getting points that contribute to ranking up.
---
smh, happy cake day though OP
---
Bong bing?
---
Oh ffs I am a full fledged survivor player and proud to say (in this sub at least), but when playing against legion, please DO NOT HEAL. You are wasting so much time especially with sloppy butcher, like what the fuck is the point of spending years healing just to get injured again so quickly
---
Yeeeeeeeeess
---
Preach. The problem is, not one rando seems to realize that easy solution.
---
I've never thought of that. It would work on any totem then. Kinda funny.
---
# THE SACRED SEXTS
---
Legion is just the best example of bad design. A killer who has no counter play but is bad at killing... How the fuck BHVR could fuck a killer up this badly is beyond me.
---
Bingy bongy 
---
Pretty much work for all killers
---
Only on hex totems of course. But it's annoying as hell as killer XD
---
If they didn't do anything to help then yeah.
---
For Wraith, the addon that says you uncloak completely after kicking a pallet/generator, Does that mean that you still have to go through your whole uncloak animation or does that mean after kicking is done you’re now fully uncloaked? 
---
I want to run Shadow Dance with Brutal/Fire Up for a meme build but if I have to go through normal uncloak, it’ll be not worth. 
---
This is why people hate survivor mains
---
I've done that several times before when I have dailies for killers I never use. They won't do anything until I message them to do something or leave if the gates are open. I don't get mad at them or anything. I just straight up tell them to leave so I can get my daily done and get the match over with. Usually they do.
---
Buzzkill when u see em on 500 ping. Kapeesh?
---
Bing bong the legion is wrong
---
Maybe for you but I don’t find legion fun. You can outplay a leatherface or Freddy in a chase. You can’t outplay a legion since they’ll eventually catch you every time.
---
Which killer effectively farms Bloodpoints better? Legion or Doctor.
---
YEAH F. HIM IN THE A. WITH YOUR D. /s
---
This is why I consider UE essential
---
Congrats that's on you but personally I love killers that ignore the way the game works makes things more fun then just let me run you around a single thing all game. Problem is at rank 1 it's not even fun because nobody even plays variety. Its just constant looping and gen jockeying. Nurse is fun and legion may not be as good as nurse but they should add more killers that do more then just follow the games rules.
---
I thought thrill notified when any totem is being done? Because doesnt the notification show up even on a dull?
---
I do believe you're the first person I've every seen say that Legion is fun to go against.  While I can't agree, I'll admit that I know the feeling of enjoying facing a killer a majority of people DC on (Doc), so you definitely have my respect.
---
totally agree, without franks legion takes 4 hits to down and he can just get rushed ez as long as the survivors dont all group up and get memed. Hes arguably c rank though because trapper pretty awful really.
---
He was giving you the hatch what
---
I haven’t used that addon in a while but I’m pretty sure as soon as you’re done kicking something you’re immediately uncloaked
---
Why was I being a dick?
---
"Saw this somewhere"? How long has this been sitting in your folder that you have no recollection where you saw it lol
---
r/TIHI
---
What's up, AnklePickBro? You hid out for a little while, but you are making it pretty clear again.
---
As a Legion main, I had a game today where I played survivor for the dailies. Played against the Legion and boy was that shit AIDS. I’m rank 5 survivor and I found that shit hella annoying. 
---
I play both, more killer to be honest
---
Because it doesnt happn a lot to me :) ( i dont claim to be a master Killer)
---
with their insta-heal-insta-blind flashlights
---
I got brave enough to bring a party streamer and killer dc'ed. Never again
---
Didn’t monto do the same thing in one of his videos? I’m not saying this is funny because it’s toxic but I don’t understand how this guy gets downvoted and hate when Monto did the same thing and everyone laughed. 
---
You clearly didnt want to cleanse the totem but just used it to spam annoying notifications to the killer so he could run in circles with you
---
Ez hits 
---
I enjoy playing against Huntress or nurse cause they aren’t simple looping like other killers and add different kind of chases while allowing some counterplay. I don’t feel legion has that. That’s why I don’t like him. He is boring to play against while also not allowing counterplay or looping. 
---
A camping wraith, what else is new?
---
Clown is underrated and underappreciated
---
I want a pizza margherita, thanks 
---
Sweet justice
---
People have rightly been complaining about nurse for eons since the devs refuse to balance her but do go off
---
what?
---
Sad thing is it's not the DC part I like I just love the frantic way killers like that can have on the game. Makes alot of people panic. Like good docs or nurses I dont got a problem with I find it more fun and challenging then just being chased all game by say a trapper or wraith and then they dont get anybody. It's the frantic gameplay I like the most about legion. He may be annoying I'll admit to it but that dont mean I'll go to the extremes of disconnecting or shoving hate down anyone's throat who plays them. Like Pig and Myers are still fun because you dont know when they show up and the slight scare is fun. Legion is fun just because I have to do more then just run around a pallet or window.
---
Yep let’s buff bad killers more!
---
Well for the second one, noed is a hex and can be rid of before it goes into effect, plus noed is kind of unfun to play against. The 3rd one, I forgot about STBFL so that was my b.
---
Answered my question with a question. You're smart.
---
Leatherface is better than doctor and trapper
---
If anything I'm doing the killer a favour, she can find me really easy now
---
yeah, you get a choice.
---
That's an understandable statement I can get behind I just cant agree but I do get your point.
---
we get it, you're an asshole. move on. 
---
Lol okay. Just a bit too coincidental that you popped up right after AnklePickBro decided to tell a bunch of people to kill themselves. The comments follow along the same level of aggression too.
---
You are easier to down then the other person.
---
I just watched the video for the cooking i swear!!
---
Okay, sorry then. But still spam notifications are rude.
---
I play survivor more myself nowadays. I kind of stopped enjoying killers outside of pig and trapper idk why
---
Didn't read doctors lore. Can someone please explain what he did?
---
I’m not complaining. Why would I quit? Trapper is my favorite killer. He’s challenging and fun. Gotta earn kills with trapper, not just be handed them on a silver platter like the other killers. Just because you need to be spoon fed doesn’t mean everybody else has to, or wants to be. 
---
Good job. The killer was definitely holding down the attack button way too hard. 
---
Hopefully they learn to tap it.
---
Years of experience have taught me, if anyone wants to get chased, do not chase them.
---
It is way quicker to just down the other person, so you better be very good at bodyblocking if you really want that hit.
---
My friend was the last one alive and it was like his second game he ever played. I was telling him to look for the hatch. This man crouch walked (no urban) from one side of the map to the other. After 15min he finally found it and the Myers we were playing against was next to it swinging furiously and spinning in circles. After the game my friend opened his messages where the killer sent like 10 messages to take the fucking hatch already because he is losing his mind. 
---
If she didnt want notifications then she shouldnt have run thrill of the hunt
---
i feel bad for them. life must suck hard if they have this much anger built up inside them. maybe they should play minecraft instead, not as an insult, just because it's a calmer game and i think it's safer for their blood pressure.
---
What did I say that's aggressive? I literally apologized to OP in this thread for being presumptive. But okay. Have a good one I guess
---
Did it prevent you from taking a not shitty picture too?
---
If youre in a tunnelling mood 1) frenzy hit 2) catch up 3) get out of ability similar to wraith 4) regular down.
---
Unless the survivors know what theyre doing, it generally leads to a down pretty quick, but obviously not as quickly as other killers.
---
it was just him trying to somehow justify that i'm bad (which i actually very much am as survivor^^) by saying i only run crutch perks (self care and dead hard where the other two, so no ds), people in this game are weird
---
I have played on my Late 2012 MacBook with similar specs. You have to turn the graphics down to low AND the resolution down to 0%. Even then, it’s like running DBD in PowerPoint mode but I have a friend who managed to get to rank 5 on the same set up. You get used to it but starting out can be rough. 
---
Also I would suggest closing ALL other applications especially Google Chrome. I’ve used discord and DBD in this scenario and it’s worked OK but it’s easier when nothing else is open. 
---
Good luck! 
---
The worst part is that I have a gut feeling that whatever they're doing with Freddy will just end up being another nerf.  The slowdown during the PTB that was related to his rework does *not* instill confidence.  On top of that they've said that they want to focus on making Freddy fun for both sides, then went on to release Legion.
---
I think youre lookin a bit too into it my guy
---
There's a difference between getting notifications and people spamming them 
---
but it doesn't matter in the scheme of things I guess. Have a good one
---
haha, but i think some of them were like pretending they'd seen it as an innocent funny ad on tv tbh. just amusing
---
yeah true. i wasn't surprised about most of them, but i would have expected to see discordance though i think that's only just becoming popular so.
---
You don’t think I noticed that?
---
I believe their schedule is a killer every 3 month, since Legion was released in December, the next one should indeed be in March. So, we can likely expect a teaser either next week or the week after, with PTR being somewhere around mid match and the new killer being released either mid March or end of March (PTR usually last 2 week).
---
I’ve been saying this. 
---
Is this promoting positive chat, slugging, kills, escapes, or noed. Can you clarify what is not worth it?
---
Got this once when I was playing the Doctor... Poor girl (I know she is, we talked afterward for 5 minutes) probably panicked more than her character in the game with illusions and hallucinations everywhere...
---
So you'd rather they didn't cleanse totems and die to NOED?
---
That's fair, and again I can respect that.  I don't much care for Legion because I get moonwalked a decent 50% of the time, but I completely understand your point of view.  It's sort of like how I enjoy micromanaging Madness vs. Doc.
---
she does have counters, it's just very difficult to outplay good nurses because 100 IQ
---
Clown no. Fat ppl make me sick tho. Hag is my 3rd favorite killer (used to be 2nd but then they made her easier and less fun) but her ability is to camp, which isn’t a lot of fun to play against. 
---
I didnt know runescape had flashlights and medkits now
---
What’s wrong?
---
I meant the unhooker, I corrected it.
---
Maybe if your only goal is to escape. If you want to get better you really should do nothing but practice looping. Nobody needs to spend time practicing doing gens since it's mindless anyways
---
* there are some insta-downs in the game
---
In my experience, a game with 0 instadown effects happens around every 5th game. "Some" lol*
---
This a a Strawman argument, so it’s a waste of my time to even argue it since you entirely changed what I said by cutting out most of my quote.
---
* Furthermore, having tested my theory quite throughly, having that additional health state is far from making the average chase last twice as long, even without a build centered around not healing.*
---
This makes us think you have data to back this up.  I doubt you have any data backing this.  And just from what I’ve seen, most chases start with a quick hit by the killer followed by an extended chase because of the free 3 second sprint burst that allows a survivor to get to a safe loop or pallet.
---
* As a final argument, Almost all of the game's top survivor streamers (in skill moreso than views, though the two oftentimes go hand in hand) gave up on self care soon after the nerfs.*
---
This is assuming everyone plays at “top survivor” skill levels.  Top survivors are ungodly at looping and can make a killer waste entire matches just by looping.  Everyone else is no where near that good and having that extra “hit” gives them a little more time wasting a killers time, which is how survivors survive matches.
---
Trap came out of nowhere
---
1. You don't need to mash the button really fast, just at a steady consistent pace. Same with wiggling on the killer's shoulder. But, sometimes the game bugs and you die while struggling. *shrug* happens to everyone.
---
2. Killer's build is hidden from survivors until the game is over. This is to stop survive with friends groups from gaining an unfair advantage. So, if you really want to see what the killer was running, gotta wait until all survivors are dead or escaped.
---
3. Yes. Prioritizing gens is always a good idea. But also, in the long run, if you only play stealthy, you likely won't get much practice in how to survive/extend a chase. The higher in rank you get, the better the killers are at chases. If you get too high a rank without learning chases, it'll probably be really frustrating. I would suggest practicing chases at around rank 15-10.
---
4. Yes.
---
5. Practice. Map awareness helps. When working on a gen, look around and keep in mind the nearest pallet or window. Spot "dead zones" that don't have pallets/windows and try to avoid those areas. Also, watching youtube videos of high rank survivors helps so you can have an idea of what looping looks like, what are good paths to take during a chase, etc. Oh Tofu's youtube channel has some helpful guides.
---
Well, if you are complaining about it, i figured you didn't understand. It's the optimal way to play most times.
---
After reading your other posts here in this discussion, its not only lag affecting it. Throwing a pallet as a survivor moves your hitbox towards the middle of a pallet instead of the place you actually are, so a killer can whiff at the middle of a pallet and still hit a survivor due to connecting to the changed throwing hitbox.
---
Meanwhile they're running Slippery Meat lol. 
---
sooo, the pig took 10 seconds to dash? 
---
Honestly, game wait-time wise it might better
---
Thank you my good man
---
I might put Legion ahead of Freddy, but that's it. He's most certainly not B or C tier. This list is one of the more accurate ones I've seen.
---
Yeah I play my fair share of both doc and legion but I dont do moonwalking bc that shit gae but hes still a royal pain just like how doc and nurse can be a pain. But I understand the moon walking pain it even annoys me
---
No The Bee. Downvoted.
---
campers don't care. they have fun taking fun from the survivors.
---
Lol! Where do I get my hands on one of those lovelies?
---
It actually does though lol. 16 seconds for base healing time, Self Care doubles this to an almost unbelievable 32 seconds of healing time if you hit no great skill checks. A gen done by yourself with 0 great skill checks takes about 80 seconds to finish, so a little more than double the time of one self care. You're almost always better off just doing a gen while injured if you're confident you can loop the killer while hurt
---
Nope. Hex totems only.
---
Half the time they’re dull totems .... 
---
There should be a pig squeaky toy that makes the exact noise Amanda does when she gets stunned
---
Didn’t know there could be 2 killers in a game.
---
Why downvote? He's right. 16 seconds to heal takes twice as long with self care (32 seconds) or about half of a full generator completion time (~80 seconds)
---
I usually have a good time with nurse against ~~swf~~ everyone
---
Hope is really fun in late game looping scenarios. These killers just can't catch me
---
I was going to say that would be overwhelming if 4 totems were going off over and over.
---
PRAISE 
---
Dude bro. Word.
---
That's why Myers is so T H I C C
---
Yea i would suggest auto leaving lobby at the end of matches over rank 10, although alot of people between 16-14 know they are bad and dont really get mad
---
All of it (except for the positivity), but mostly slugging to keep the hatch closed.
---
Bubba Ross
---
Were you teabagging him after he gave you hatch?!
---
Well I don't know what the hell you're trying to say at all, BUT I think it's worth noting that the game that nobody played like a toxic PoS is the one where everyone scored high bloodpoints and came out happy. 
---
Bing Bong Boi
---
Iridescent stone or a bug most likely 
---
I was considering it. The main thing that held me back was that he lacks map pressure.
---
Iridescent stone just makes traps appear at your feet?
---
Now that, my boy, is a 300 IQ escape
---
It’s very valid if you’re solo queueing with a bunch of potatoes. Can’t count the number of 1k games turned 4K because survivors hook camp like they’re moths and the unhook is a lamp. 
---
It may have been at the totem, got disarmed then rearmed at your feet
---
Definitely disagree about the Pig. She is absolutely D tier.
---
Her ambush is not reliable and it slows your game down, which is bad in a game about time management.
---
Her kit does nothing to help in chase, so she's easily looped, and is only useful after she hits someone twice to down them.
---
Finally, her RBT's are completely RNG, which means that they are ultimately unreliable.
---
Now compare that to almost every other killer on the board. Most of them can use their powers to interrupt chases or heavily delay the game in some fashion. More important, nearly every other killer's power is *reliable*, meaning that it relies less on chance and more on your skill. Play well, do well. Simple.
---
Not pig though. Play well, still get fucked by RNG. Totally trash tier.
---
Yes, NOED will appear on a dull totem when it activates, unless all dull totems have been cleansed.
---
It still makes a sound when broken 
---
I'd probably put Spirit higher, she's definitely more dominant than Huntress or Billy. Maybe like S for Spirit and some kinda S+ Magnum Fuck-You-Up tier for Nurse.
---
Most things like slugging and camping dont get you many points lol.
---
you would have to completely rework how the hooking system is at this point. There's always going to be killers that play this way unfortunately and they are usually adequately rewarded for it too. Giving reasons to not camp and penalties for doing so clearly won't work as many killers still do it.
---
Look at what's in place already. Killers have BBQ, Make Your Choice, and Devour Hope as perks to encourage leaving the hook. Survivors have perks like Breakdown, Borrowed Time, and Kindred to counter camping.
---
There are even mechanics such as giving survivors i-frames after getting unhooked or decaying a killers emblem for camping(something people cried about when it got implemented)
---
Yet killers still do it very often too.
---
Im commenting on how its impossible to counter a bubba chainsaw camp. Any other killer can be countered with BT. But ok lol change the subject
---
I feel like that change don't make the perk bad or useless, because I barely see someone hide in a locker when someone is getting hook
---
imo it can be fun juking nurse. sometimes it works, sometimes not... but how do you have fun vs legion? usually you only escape legions when they try to mind game you (for no reason) or use frenzy too soon and dont reach you in time.
---
Claudette op 
---
If you arent toxic, you usually wont get any toxicity.
---
No it didn't. Traps have a pretty small hitbox unless you use an add-on to increase it and the trap was literally as close to the totem as you can get it so you didn't proc it until you moved into cleansing position 
---
This I agree with. I’d rather face a Legion than Freddy. At least you can see Legion and can take advantage of the lack of scratch marks in Frenzy. Freddy just always sees you. It’s not even difficult to face Freddy, it’s just so irritating to always pay attention to potential looping zones and situate yourself near those. 
---
I would have started screaming "respect the 4%" 
---
gg though.
---
It's not a crutch guys, I'm playing a midgame build!
---
Agreed. If the killer is struggling, they probably have NOED. So if the killer isn’t doing well, I try to either cleanse everything or not be the first one bit after the gens are powered
---
Nurse you need map knowledge so even if you've never played a single hour of nurse but you've played 1000 hours of other killers you'll be decent, Legion takes no experience, map knowledge and very very little skill 
---
looks like i touched a nerve and hurt someone's wittle feelers. 
---
The Wraith is my favorite killer. His speed addons make him sprint across the map, add I Whispers and you can find survivors pretty quickly usually. 
---
Wraiths is a club 
---
Agreed, but I also think hag is better thab myers now, but their definitely arguable
---
Uncloaked, too. This wasn't tactics, it was sending a message.
---
He got stuck on the Leatherface after he dropped him. 
---
No man just jumped right in.
---
I never teabag, never. 
---
I've been playing this game for a while now and I still feel like this survivor. I promise I'm not being toxic, i'm just very nervous ;w;
---
Yeah I’ve definitely seen some sus attempts but I can always just rev at like 10% for a couple seconds and then as soon as they go past the pallet I just drop the saw and get a smack. It looks like I’m really gonna try it but then I just M1 so it’s hard to tell if someone’s commuting or faking. 
---
That good stuff tho is when u run enduring and just walk through the pallet while revving so it doesn’t matter if they drop it or not bc you either break the pallet or get a hit
---
Because this game is not designed to be highly competitive or skill based. BHVR has even stated this themselves
---
Dead by Daylight is rather casual game in its entirety. If this game should be more skill based and competitive then it would need a huge change in gameplay.
---
I've been playing for a couple weeks now, mainly as killer. I do play survive with friends with a buddy on occasion, and the BP gain is way less. It feels like playing well as a survivor means that some categories like bold just don't get any points, whereas a good killer game is going to get a lot in all four. Am I playing survivor wrong, or is that just the nature of the game?
---
Huntress as a guy? Looking good tho
---
Oh ok. I was wondering why you would do that. Makes more sense now. 
---
Make the call ping a random Survivor's current position and give them the exposed status effect for x amount of seconds, and let Ghostface hide in and teleport between lockers to set up ambushes like in the movies. Woo.
---
love the line art and attention to detail &lt;3
---
BING...
---
Huntress is my fave! Didn’t see the gender as a barrier in honoring how much she rocks or what this game means to me. :)
---
Should I perform a mori on him?
---
Heyall, sorry for asking so much.
---
I got ALL the DLC (I am spoiled). So here's the gist.
---
As killer, I like me some Leatherface as BBQ N Chili is too good for bloodpoints and Leatherface is one of my favorite Horror movie killers. Can anyone give tips for his Chainsaw? I got a near all iridescent against a SWF (one escaped via hatch so gold devout) and some 4Ks but I still suck at his chainsaw. Is it mostly prediction based with him? That is the only way I can actually hit it is on hard reads but I am not good at predicting unless it is related to hooked survivors. I do get juked a lot otherwise. 
---
   Legion seems fun (don't kill me pls) so any tips with them? With their power I do my best to spread the deep wounds and avoid tunnelling. 
---
Survivors
---
After Feng, who should I level? I wanna level Ace cause he has fun personal perks but they aren't too good. Would Jake be good? He is a mix of fun and effective personal perk wise.
---
Yeah, she’s incredible. When I saw her post another work, I was messaging her about commissions within minutes.
---
This is the most accurate tier list imo. 
---
I get that :)
---
Im never toxic cause i never say anything lol, i dont see the point in talking to survivors outside of MAYBE a “gg” 
---
You’re an idiot and/or don’t play with new players at all.
---
Not to mention that 99-ing hooks also requires being near a downed person to neutralize the hook.
---
Exactly
---
Wait perhaps we can learn something from his experience. Trapper!
---
HOW CAN I EAT MY PIZZA WITHOUT MY DRINK
---
NO. NO. NO GOD NO PLEASE WHY?! 
---
They nerfed it pretty hard with the lockers blocking all auras.  Against a lot of teams BBQ becomes more or less just a WGFL for killers.  The smart survivors will slow vault a locker the moment a killer downs a person to beat the read.  Basically at this point if you're getting spotted by BBQ it's because you chose to let them see you.
---
The difference between the two is that legions pkaystyle forces you to tunnel espescially if u don’t find anyone right away. With the nurse you can afford just injuring them and finding someone else to prolong the game
---
I also sometimea put bond woth the pebble so I can throw it at teammates if I'm struggling
---
I don’t know how this works on people. What rank are you playing at?
---
You can actually see the survivor half the time, and/or hear them shuffle to the side. Even if you don’t, you’re blocking the window and can easily check both sides for a split second.
---
well you know it isn't a Nea because they're too busy Urban Evading everywhere.

Clearly it was an accident: just look at how sad Wraith looks!
---
Big Mood. We love our benevolent God.
---
I don't think it actually counts in regards to whether you get the points or not. Killer can easily out wait borrowed time depending on location, or just chase down the poor unhooked survivor anyway unfortunately. 
---
I purposefully lose rank just to play friendly killer and let the noobs farm
---
It rustles my jimmies when I see a noob in a swf and the friend is one of those toxic ass players. I still let them win, but I sit back in my seat salty as hell that that noob may one day be a little bitch to go against or work with later.
---
It's strange how you can like art for what it is, but condemn it because of the artist. Personally i just condemn the artist themselves, but still like the creature. If they have found a way to give us something similar or just the "flying killer" they said they had tested, it would be new, exciting, and interesting being a survivor prioritizing all of the open air generators first because you can't afford to save them for endgame with that thing flying around up there, also, Searching for cover so it can't land right on you, potentially using pallets to make it take flight in order to buy more time, etc... It would bring more thrill and new tactics to the game if its done right. if not it'll be an OP PoS that the community will bemoan to death and will require major tweaking to better balance, but hey, that's pretty much how this game works. 
---
Should I perform a MORI on him ?
---
I love this view because there's no denying that Nurse is amazing, but all the other killers in the right hands (yes, EVERY killer) can be absolutely amazing. Finally someone said it
---
I don’t understand it either.  Every time I’ve tried it, the Killer seems to see me.  Then again, maybe I’m staying to close to the window?
---
I honestly miss the terror of being a noob, of enjoying the horror part of survival horror. Stress just isn't the same.
---
For the love of God, how do you use the styptic agent on PS4??
---
He gave you hatch, I see nothing else? 
---
How is the hag not bottom tier, she literally has a skinless bottom.
---
Lol the sheer amount of bloodpoints and pips you've given up in all the time wasted tryharding hatch standoffs is unreal man.  It's never worth it.  Just take your 3k obvious victory, bloodpoints and play another game Learherface.  I'm assuming you were Leatherface they are most likely to do hatch standoffs lol 
---
Very welcome
---
Thsi si what a dislike of DS. Its just an extra live for no aparent reason. You were dead, and now you are not. Not saying I have anything against you, but its unfair :(
---
If u go through my page, all my caps have names but i dont promote the toxicity that goes on.
---
This is really good! Like holy shit man. 
---
haha yeah I love all the fear when you're new!! It's one of my favorite things about this game tbh.
---
Don't feel bad! It sure is your job and IMO as long as you're not being intentionally unkind, I don't think there's any reason to feel bad &lt;3 We all gotta die sometimes!
---
Yeah I had a survivor on my team who was a killer who face camped me for no reason other than he was shit. We were the last 2 left he got hooked, I opened the gate and left. Karma catches up with you mr camping wraith and you can’t just change your psn name.
---
at first glance this would be obvious but despite all odds she has some nice booty roundness knowing that she was once even more thicc earns her a solid 8
---
Wow, with prestige Claudette? You can do better than that. 
---
Hag should be below spirit imo
---
Yeah my bad lol. Specified wrong on who made the joke lkl
---
Fuck off
---
Lack of brain cells in ur head
---
At least that is better than SAW chapter's release which literally dropped on a Tuesday with no teaser or any info besides two perk names. Luckily it was leaked the weekend before release and managed to get some hype. I still think it was bhvr that "leaked" it so they could get some hype around what I assume was a NDA as part of the license deal.
---
Hahaha, "viable strat." The whole thing I'm explaining is it's not a good strategy. You waste everyone's time and you're not playing better, you're playing as safely as possible. It is impossible to escape without a key (sometimes even with one depending on how far they get with gens, especially if survivors can't find the Ruin totem), and Unbreakable. If the person has Unbreakable they're just going to get slugged again (I don't think I need to mention what a joke No Mither is). I would rank it an F strat if that because it's FFFFFFFFFFFFing annoying AND, also, as I'm trying to demonstrate, stupid.
---
Better than what haha
---
BING BONG
---
Bing my Dong
---
Well of course I’m chili boi. I do it because I’m petty and almost all survivors I face are toxic. If I’m facing normal survivors I’ll just hit them or grab em if they jump in.
---
This was rank 10. Killer was around the same.
---
Bing bong, show me ur Ding dong.
---
Maybe it just times out or you play vs Bubba. I havent had any problems with BT in years and I use it every game.
---
The killer can wait, but even if the survivor is hit with BT you will still get the safe unhook if they are not in the dying state.
---
I give away more hatches than anyone probably lol.  3 or less survivors loading in, someone rage quitting in opening minute of match, I destroyed you guys so hard it wasn't even a game, I noticed one survivor was a great player on a team of noobs,  I used ridiculous addons, I'm trying to avoid the doublepip, you had a very very funny and/or clever username, etc...
---
Rank 15 the new rank 1
---
I actually go out of my way to save team mates a lot. Even with NOED I try my best to find a way and when I have shitty team mates it bites me in the ass
---
Gender lol. That used to be a thing. /s
---
Spirit fury with enduring. This combo saves me a lot of time in chases.
---
Michael deserves his own tier imo
---
It's all good. I showed him this post and he was just glad to make someone laugh.  :)
---
Them invisible P1/2/3 Claudette’s! Let’s see some shiny detective Tapp jukes! Just like messing with Claudette mains. I can find them without my headphones cranked way up. 
---
Ayyyy born this way referance!!😂
---
ay but i mean, a saw is fucking more vicious than a knife
---
Remember a group where 2 dc'd and 1 was killed, leaving just me and 5 gens to do. So I urban evasion around and get two gens done, but get caught in a body block while looking for the hatch.
---
Jack ass just stood there and want to go make a pizza or something. So I kept running in an out of his red stain till I got max chase points.
---
Good times, he was salty as fuck in the lobby.
---
You forgot Adrenaline, the literal bane of my existence when it comes to maining Scary Terry
---
Like why the fuck does it WAKE YOU UP, giving a survivor better Sprint Burst and unbreakable combined is bad enough as is when Freddy is so loopable, but then it breaks them out of the dream state, making it at least 15 seconds before you can even hit them. By the time you find the damn survivor, the exit gate is already open with 4 people t bagging and waking themselves up in front of you as you're completely powerless
---
&gt;Can anyone give tips for his Chainsaw?
---
Not accounting for add-ons, you might find using Monitor &amp; Abuse surprisingly helpful. It may not seem like much but the extra 8m of distance it gives you allows the survivors much less time to get to a safe spot. Sprint burst shenanigans aside, the more you can catch someone by surprise and out of position, the better your chainsaw becomes. As a benefit if you want, you can then also run A Nurse's Calling perk since your terror radius will be smaller than the aura reading zone.
---
&gt;  I wanna level Ace cause he has fun personal perks but they aren't too good. 
---
Ace in the Hole was recently buffed so you can at least guarantee 1 add on. If you want to use Plunderer's instinct then definitely pick this up. 
---
&gt;Would Jake be good?
---
Iron will is always a decent "4th perk". His other two are very meh. Sabotage is still not very good unless you're running with a team dedicated to that goal. Calm Spirit could possibly be useful if more Killers start picking up the recently buffed Spies from the Shadows.
---
Depending on your playstyle and what you're missing you might want to consider the following:
---
* Claudette: All 3 perks are strong and do what they do well. 
---
* Meg: Sprint Burst and Adrenaline are community favorites for a reason. Plus I always like having all "Exhaustion" options unlocked to allow for different builds
---
* David: Dead Hard and WGLF are both solid perks. Granted, WGLF gives no in-game strength but hey, free BP
---
The rest are up to personal preference. Not to say there aren't strong perks among the rest of the survivors, but it's going to come down how you want to play. The three above give you a solid return for the BP investment.
---
Correlation does not imply causation.
---
IMO the worst thing about Legion is the moonwalking to get a down on even the most competent survivors. Couple this with the fact that FF has built in tracking means he has an excellent ability to tunnel, almost as good as Freddy. If a Legion wants you downed, there is very, very little you can do besides try to run the clock for your teammates.

Must be relativity new. It’s the oldest juke in the book.

I love finding Dull Keys!  That's a guaranteed dc from the killer.  Soon as I find one I slow vault a locker and message the killer "Fam it's over, I found a dull key".  I'm right back to the campfire in seconds everytime.

The nurse has a BONE*saw you uncultured swine! /s

now i respect the intent. "spirit? she got a fine booty!' but you see that is only because it is the most exposed. rly that ass is flat and she got no excuse. (what, cannibals ate your flesh? we heard it all before sister).
---
Frank killed the guy because he saw Julie was being assaulted or something. Joey and Julie did it because Frank said to and Susie was simply forced. Frank might deserve to be up there, but I’m not sure about the others especially not Susie
---
But what is Kate doing
---
Running out the clock to stall for generator time is the survivor's goal in the chases to begin with. 
---
Nah bps for survivor are pretty crap, killer is the best way to go if you wanna get fast bps, especially if you have bbq and chilli.
---
What was the format? Do you have a team and you play one of yours as killer vs their 4 then switch? 
---
The sandbags are real with this baby survivor.

I don’t have a problem with it

Bing bong, hello there! Door to door salesman selling skills on a stick!
---
I literally have no idea what this post is about.
---
Never did I once say it was a good Strat, I just said it's viable. It's not bannable nor reportable, which makes it viable. I don't disagree with DS but it's not bannable so it is viable. Also, I agree with you it's a shitty Strat and I personally don't participate in it unless I know for certain where the other survivor is. But the back and forth thing with survivors and killers is ridiculous. 
---
Survivor logic: You are toxic if you are playing killer and getting kills
---
Oh my, how small the world is. I play frequently with him and another friend, I think you just made his day :)
---
Boooo. This is baby time. The good build is:
---
Blue Dress, Nancy's Masterpiece, STBFL, Ruin, BB&amp;C, Bamboozle. You're welcome.

Lol sure bro, you run NOED for the haste...

Ugh I love Evan he’s such a cutie!!!

Oh I'm sorry I didn't realize the post implied it wanted killing to be harder :^]

2. You are not going to find a community for a game that is not filled with inside jokes
---
Yeah I don't get this. I don't come across tunneling Legions (or even Freddys) like...ever. Same goes for moonwalking, it never happens to me. When I play Legion I find that moonwalking is incredibly inconsistent and it's way easier to just stab the survivors.
---
Also, 2170680 is right, chasing is entirely meant to stall no matter the killer, so I don't really get why people hate it more when it's Legion especially since the survivor tends to have the advantage against them.
---
I still say the best way is to reward Survivors for being camped. Each second the Killer is within a certain radius of a hooked Survivor, the Survivor get so many bloodpoints as well as points toward Gatekeeper ^((you're helping your teammates do the objective indirectly)), Survival ^((you're trying your hardest)), and Altruism ^((you're drawing the Killer's aggro and dying for your teammates)). 
---
The game already has several point categories that already work this exact way (Boldness, Evader, and Assist), so I can't imagine it'd be too hard to implement. If the devs are feeling generous you could even give Survivors more emblem points if they're hit within a certain time after being unhooked.
---
I think this would solve the issue since most Killers do this kind of camping just to be jerks and if the Survivors they camp get tons of bloodpoints and get an auto black-pip they'll stop, because they're no longer ruining the player's day. Those that don't quit won't be as annoying because the Survivor is getting compensated for the boring game.
---
Honestly, I'm open to hearing any reasons this kind of system **shouldn't** exist because I can't think of any.
---
**TL;DR:** Stop punishing campers, start rewarding campees.
---
Are you playing as a killer? Survivor? Both? Just curious. Solid list. Unfortunately I put legion up higher. Causes the most DCs and with exploits can be nearly unbeatable in 1:1
---
Name one counter that isn't unblinkable map geometry.
---
**Are you going to say stealth?** 
---
Nurse struggles less with stealth than any other killer
---
* She has the ability to instantly transition from one side of a LoS blocking object to the other. (While also gaining the ability to see through the object during the transition. ) 
---
* A core component of stealth gameplay is to put an object between yourself and the killer and slowly rotate around that object so that the killer never catches sight of you, before moving away into an area the killer has already searched. This is the essence of stealth.
---
* Survivors are not capable of moving fast enough to do this relative to the speed at which a nurse can check both sides of any obstructions. Even while sprinting, it is difficult to do with only few exceptions. Sprinting is not stealthy.
---
Do you have a different definition of stealth?
---
**Are you going to say abusing walled structures in a chase?**
---
Once again, nurse struggles less with navigating walled structures (i.e. loops) than any other killer.
---
* The nurse can blink through walls, something no other killer can do. Every other killer must move around walls or through windows/doors, same as the survivor.
---
* Trying to maintain a position which breaks LoS; is near enough to a walled structure that the nurse can potentially underblink, be caught on the incorrect side, and then miss -- limits the survivors' potential range of motion extensively. They move at a constant, predictable speed. They cannot break from the defensible position near a walled structure until the nurse completely loses them, or they can find another defensible structure in less than a few seconds. (Making every path they take wholly predictable.)
---
* Attempting to transition inside these structures nearly guarantees a hit, because the range of motion becomes even more limited for the survivor. 
---
Please, provide me with a single counter to nurse that doesn't affect any other killer much more significantly. 
---
Your art teacher will love it.
---
Holy shit this is amazing. And it’s only a WIP? I can only imagine how good it’ll look once finished.
---
I like how you jumped right into it :) will try out your tips tonight!
---
I love this boy, Bing bong!
---
You clearly haven’t played against a bamboozle nurse. Shit‘s entertaining.
---
Actually a knife will probably do more dmg when chopping or stabbing with it.
---
A saw really isn't that good to inflict damage unless you actually saw with it
---
He's filling your wiggle bar since you're not doing it yourself - it looks like he was just trying to be very clear that you're getting hatch. 
---
When i get sacraficed. It looks like her head is up my butt
---
Power range is by far the best stat for Fred. You just turn and sleep anyone you see when in a chase, and the dress keeps them asleep longer.
---
Sacrificed
---
Dropping me by the hatch would have been enough haha 
---
I dunno I think removing a player from the game in under 2 mins, while slowing down gen speeds by 25% and bumping up the gate opening to a grueling 3 mins Max has it's value
---
Legionnaire in the locker: **DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HIM ANY CHANCE, HUH?**

Puppers plays both, but has a lot of Survivor videos. He's laid back and fun to watch!

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wX9kjLmEav8DRiQ3JEJAg
---
I have a great clip of someone with borrowed time unhooking me as they get hit by the killer. Then the killer immediately downing me in one hit.
---
Puppers is a Streamer who also posts his games on Youtube. 
---
So nurse is the only killer you don't really need to learn how to play and you can still clean up?
---
TIL thank you!
---
ps4 messages app
---
why didnt he grab?
---
I think that'd be an interesting change, but SWF groups will immediately know one of them is downed anyway, so it'd only hurt solo players (who, to be fair, are significantly more impacted by Knock Out already).
---
I believe the game's design philosophy is accepting that SWF groups have huge amounts of information not normally available to solo players, and trying to buff solo players towards that level of awareness, so that killers can then be buffed and balanced around all survivors having particular information at all times.
---
So we celebrated the last day of school last week and I dressed up as Michael Myers (It´s a celebration we have in Finland and it´s called the Penkkarit. Some little kids took selfies with me and some of them thougth I was Jason Voorhees. Had a great time really

---
No0b3 is a really good survivor who knows how to loop good. Demi is also a good survivor that can loop good. 
---
Leatherface- Reduce terror radius, Nurses calling might be with Monitor and Abuse (funnily enough both perks are teachables from medical killers).
---
Claudette has heals, Meg has bursts of energy, David has BP gain and Dead Hard. Jake is okay.
---
Ace has his Ace in the Hole (wordplay intended) as a decent perk for chest looting. I fully intend on running Plunder's instinct with Ace in the Hole as the ultimate looter once I level him. Otherwise it is my choice.
---
Sorry for asking so much but I have one more.
---
Does Open Handed and Bond stack? I'm curious if it allows to see teammates within a 44 meter radius for yourself.
---
And know to not use Freddy
---
Exactly. And the BP is even easier to get when you face camp.   
---
I can def get 2k from face camping, so that's an easy 30k in one game on top of my usual 'game BP points'. 
---
Your taste is F Tier
---
I do this only when a disconnect happens (2 die 1 lives) or if they are the only ones who didn't tea bag 
---
It takes 159 bloodwebs to go from the base three of a killer to having every single perk (if you have all the teachables) so its possible to get all perk just make sure to do it on a killer you enjoy. I have 1200 hours and only have Nea and Doctor all perked but many others P3-level 50.
---
The best thing you can do against legion is to mend, but not heal to full. Their relatively slow base MS makes out running them a bit easier, and if they keep popping their power to stab you out, at least you've created plenty of time for your team. It amazes me that more legions don't run thanatophobia
---
I get it.
---
Unless they're not lazy this time...DbD isn't a high tech game
---
All depends on how you handle it
---
oh I see, lol
---
You are right to a degree, but escaping chases (also a survivors goal in a chase) against the type of Legion i have described depends on the killer's skill and not the survivors. 
---
quick put me on r/whooosh

---
Yea it's soooo viable. I'll just crouch and point in this corner for 4 minutes while you camp the body/hatch
---
I once had a teammate who used the N and R words in pregame and they were the only one hooked the entire game, well when the exit games were open I went to unhook them right in front of the killer flashlighted so the killer payed attention to me while she was chasing just long enough to get my safe unhook then everyone ran out the exit gates but him. I don't normally play toxic but I'm not ok with blatant hate and racism 
---
I wonder that too, until title screen where I see that sweet white frame around their rank
---
Have you seen plant hag though
---
This is a weird way to draw leather face.
---
She's got us for three minutes! Three minutes of PLAYTIME.
---
No clue, I wasn’t around for it. Sorry.
---
Turn up your volume if the hatch is open, it makes a very loud noise that you can hear from about 10-15M away
---
I had the same issue a fat ago
---
Bad ping I’m out of there. Other than that I usually play all lobbies. 
---
I'd like to think this is a reasonable answer
---
Tbh i haven't seen a moonwalking legion since the first month he came out, but I won't say they don't exist. Also, it's great that you like Legion and choose to play fairly, i REALLY commend you for that. Personally, i don't buy into the legion hate brigade but I do recognize the problems with his concept/mechanics and agree that he should be changed.

they were a rank 17, so they at least knew what they were doing

Once when I was running Franklin's, I hit a survivor as they were getting to the gate with a purple toolbox, they swung around, picked up their item but I got another hit RIGHT as they made it out. He bitched me out in chat.
---
Got the same dude a few games later, made him lose another purple toolbox.  Got even more annoyed when he realized it was me again. 
---
He was a streamer so I popped into his chat and asked if he knew anyone who wanted to purchase some (slightly used) purple toolboxes as I  had too many. He wasn't pleased.
---
#BING BONG
---
I main Billy and here is what I recommend that you DON'T DO:
---
DON'T: Run in a straight line in the open, I will chainsaw you every time. My chainsaw charge time is decreased due to my loadout and it takes a few seconds to get it going.
---
DON'T: Underestimate the reach of my hammer, it is has a longer range than what you will assume so be aware of how far I am.
---
Now time for my DO's:
---
DO: run towards my left or right side if I am charging towards you. The field of view is not that good and if you manage to get past me it is likely that you will lose me.
---
Also just a tip for all players no matter the Killer: Killers can see red scratch marks when you run, stealth works better than running so try to hide rather than run across the map.
---
I main Killer and really enjoy it but I am not very good.  I got as high as rank 13 aftef playing 2.5 months. So, are obsession perks just a bad idea for me? It seems like they have a relatively high skill requirement.
---
But Legion is completely counterable.
---
Legion cannot see your scratch marks in feral frenzy so you need to get them to use it, after that you chase in a manner that forces Legion to lose line-of-sight (killer shack, buildings, corn, and T-walls are perfect for this). Legion will try and find which way you went, which gives you time to get away and find a hiding spot to mend.
---
This strategy works almost every single time I try it (it's even easier with Iron Will, which I usually don't run) and if it doesn't work it's usually because I made a mistake or someone sandbagged me. Honestly I'm shocked that people think that Legion is remotely hard to play against even with Cold Dirt or Frank's Mixtape.
---
So my main reason for disliking him is this;
---
If he is chasing you there is literally nothing you can do to get away, barring leading him to another survivor.  Eventually you’ll have to mend
---
I actually don’t see too many moonwalking legions anymore, mainly because you don’t even have to do that. 
---
But it’s basically just mending over and over again. It’s boring 
---
I can't really be bothered arguing about the pointlessness of healing again, but as far as technicalities go- "at 50% speed" means that the game increments the progress counter at half the rate. You can test this yourself if you want.
---
Nurse just takes hella practice and then rank reset happens and your predictions are off because you’re playing against different ranks and then you switch to some one more powerful then Nurse. Le-*DC noise.*
---
You obviously don't pay attention to the discussion. We're talking about slugging and trying to find last guy, not camping the body/hatch. 
---
Doctor and Trapper have better map pressure tho. Leatherface is basically a nerfed Billy
---
I'm pretty sure every switch game has to support joy cons. The Switch wouldn't be doing as well as it is if devs could lock games behind a controller that doesn't come with the console.
---
Ds doesnt need a change imo, its a very powerful perk. The only problem with it is that its frustrating killer side (enduring is your best friend btw). Hatch could use some change but its mainly a survivor problem, if they stand on the hatch the killer has no other choice but to stay. That survivor can just do gens instead
---
I’m not even a toxic Legion tho. I think it’s just a fad now to dc against a Legion *cries in Susie*
---
Yeah, so where do you use the shards in this case? I ask because I have a ton of shards and just bought Leatherface for bbq
---
Very ironic username. 
---
lets not talk abt it 😔 i change my mind
---
EXACTLYYY!!!!!
---
What console? I’m on ps4 and never got the option to buy bubba with shards
---
Could be cool if they made a battletoad 2 crossover
---
While I wouldn't say nurses is meta, he played poorly by healing that close to where he was hooked. I likely wouldn't have moried him at that point and would've hook him again but that's just me.
---
PS4. 
---
I would save her if we could go camping after. 
---
Noobs editing is atrocious though. I can’t even understand the flow of the game because he cuts up the game so much
---
yeah this post is too hot a take for me
---
This is an instance where knowing the difference between "then" and "than" is important.
---
Right I realized the problem, sorry. Leather face is licensed so you can’t buy him with shards. Sorry about that, my brain farted. 
---
I thought wraith was a mace wielder 
---
I think for some but not for Leatherface
---
The best way to learn both sides is to play both sides.  The fact that you have already played survivor give you the info of pathing, and the mechanics survivors have to use against the killer.
---
Looping and learning how to mindgame will differ between killers but for the most part you need to learn what loops are safe or unsafe.  As in safe like they could loop you for multiple minutes/gens if you don’t break this pallet, or whatever.  Unsafe being you can still get a hit even after the pallet drops. 
---
As for the pig, she is my favorite killer. She is quite good as her traps can slow the game down without using a anti gen perk like ruin. 
---
I would say either use perks that go all on on your killers strengths to make them really good at something, or use perks that offset a weakness and round you out. 
---
For example the Shape has a lower terror radius (heartbeat) than most other killers.  The doctor perk monitor and Abuse, lowers your terror radius by 8 meters while not in a chase.  It’s a stealthy perk, and when played on a stealthy killer like Michael it just adds to that power. 
---
In tier 1 with monitor and Abuse he already has to be basically touching you to hear the heartbeat.  Of course in tier 1 he is slower and has a reduced lunge range but you see what I meant about playing to his strengths. 
---
Don’t overcommit to a chase.  If your at a loop you know will waste time,  get a hit or break the pallet and then check a gen. Sometimes it’s worth it to pressure someone else as they could ru to an unsafe area you already broke pallets in during a different chase. So many killers lose 3-5 gens in one chase with a good player. 
---
Yeah lol. Just did not have any picture of the full outfit
---
*Doing gens, you?*
---
Worst is: they think they are right.
---
*laughs in Doctor*
---
I’m going to disagree completely with you. Tell you what, well make a bet, we put two equally good players against each other. One will play Freddy and the other will play Billy. Let’s see who gets more kills.  
---
they really do :-/
---
The good players never make it out alive. It’s always that Dwight whose been hiding in the locker the whole match that ends up escaping.
---
Simple answer, yes it does. 
---
I wouldn't say OP, just extremely annoying if they tunnel or exploit the deep wounds timer.
---
If they play the way he was intended he's a bit of a meme to play against.
---
[My bets are on freddy](https://imgur.com/gallery/w4sboOo) 
---
It's Gas Heaven goddammit. 
---
Honestly, I like it. I want another WTF moment. I also run object of obsession so I'm usually in dying or hooked quickly. I would just laugh at a Billy dashing at me with the whole ass hook 
---
*Nintendo Power Glove* That’s too good.
---
when I see the Entity, I'm sure AF going to ask him! &gt;:( 
---
Cause the killer was aids
---
Should’ve made Huntress a girl. Nice art work though 👍🏽
---
OMG lol, my match had 2 Dwights... why did I expect them to do anything. :'( 
---
* If you're running Iron Will they cannot hear you, so listening doesn't help.
---
* Even if you don't run Iron Will, the amount of time it takes for the Feral Frenzy to cool down along with the added line-of-sight blockers you should be using gives you more than enough time to get far away enough that the killer can't hear you (even with cold dirt)
---
* It sounds like you're just not hiding well
---
* Stopping to mend is literally so easy once you lose Legion. You just do it. If you're stopping to mend in chase you're doing it wrong
---
Legion is literally so easy to counter. I'm actually amazed and incredibly confused that other people don't see it that way. I can't believe we're still talking about moonwalking, especially since I haven't seen anyone do it since 2018. I can understand that people might get annoyed that games take longer because of mending but like...that's not really a big deal.
---
BING BONG BING BONG HOWDY DOODIE
---
Yes I was looking for the hatch
---
Yea but he was a pretty fucked up dude before he died, so maybe that's why OP put him there?
---
These are good strategies but if they use the bloodhound/moonwalk combo the above strategies do not work at all. The only way to beat the exploit is running no mither so you do not bleed and iron will to cover the remaining 50% of your pain grunts. If survivors HAVE to use a perk like no mither to counter play than that clearly points to something that isn't right.
---
saboing isn't meant to just poke a hook to destroy it in front of the killer and make them lose all the precious time they used to get that survivor.
---
is it unimportant? yes, as survivors are not coordinated.
---
is it important in high ranks? yes in my opinion.
---
however i would agree that sabo just needs to be remade to not be another bar to fill up.
---
but as of right now the killer has no interaction with sabo besides getting frustrated and losing the time they used to take down the survivor, doubly so for any freddy player, or doctor tbh
---
My eyes are totally fine and I definitely think it's WAY too bright. It hurts my eyes too ;-;
---
I notice there’s no Nea...     ;)
---
ME BING BONG
---
With what ive seen on this reddit, I dont think I ever want voice comms built-in this game unless I could turn it permanently off.
---
Alright! Im not the only one who thought this. Haha
---
Please indicate the part of my build that indicates luck. 25% shower gen speeds is 25% slower. There's no chance in that. I don't care what synergy range and skill checks (luck based, btw) has on the game, it can't compare with removing a player from the game in the first few minutes. If you're taking risk reward judgement then you're gambling. Thats not skill, it's luck.
---
This way officer, thats him
---
I mean, Huntress is based on me. Are you saying they should have drawn a femme version of /u/MarcianTobay?
---
A mute button would be a necessity
---
is a dc worth the same as a sacrificed survivor?
---
I thought it would have been your friend that got hooked, that was a nice ending 
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
No disrespect to huntress mains though, unless you camp 
---
yeah you cant escape unless legion makes a big mistake... which shouldnt really happen. pretty bad design imo.
---
I offer you a non-sarcastic congratulations on never running into an exploiting Legion with the name UCANTHIDE who brings an ebony mori.
---
AYYY ACE IS NO1. 
---
Leather face is a no for me. 
---
Billy has insane map pressure, but if you stay out of the open and get back on the gen when he kicks it and zips across the map you're usually pretty golden. I like to run urban evasion and when I see him coming- I duck around, he kicks it- I work on it. Most Billy's literally just zip gen to gen in hopes of finding someone.  
---
For his chainsaw- just honestly stay in rocky areas, use windows, pallets, any areas with trees shut him down quick on the chainsaw.  Just stay out of the open and don't just run a straight line. Most aren't even running quick turn add ons.. if they are and miss it's a larger penalty for them. I promise you more experience will help. If he catches you on a gen because he zipped and saw you- you gotta be more aware. At least be on the opposite side of the gen so his chainsaw rams into it and you can try to run.  
---
Is anyone getting bored by this game?
---
The real way to fix SWF would be to just let killers opt-out of it. Give Killers the ability to say "I don't want to face anyone who uses SWF over Survive Alone." 
---
Could even make it scale, so you can say you're okay with duos, but not three or four-man SWF.
---
Sure, this would result in longer queue times for the killers and SWF both, but then, that's why its the killers who are opting in or out of it, and it can only benefit solo survivors because they'll be getting faster queues.
---
Would be a great way to more subtly change the behavior in the game. Want faster queue times? Then just Survive Alone. Want to be more like Seal Team Six rather than actual terrified survivors fleeing a killer? Then you can wait for a killer willing to put up with your bullshit.
---
go ooooon
---
"If she didnt want notifications then she shouldnt have run thrill of the hunt"
---
Dude, not to be spammed for it. You're playing like a classic toxic survivor who's giving survivor mains a bad name. Just maybe don't be a dick?
---
Really? All it seems to do to me is give me those Rank 5s who run every good perk and are beastly but are somehow at rank 15.
---
Why do people think the Nintendo switch is a good console for this game when others constantly complain about how this game runs on Xbox/PS4?
---
... Not much later, but still probably a couple hours and a dozen games into playing Killer, I finally realized I too could vault windows and didn't ALWAYS have to go around. &gt;.&gt;;
---
Survivor main, who recently started playing killer. BPs are way faster on killer. I don't enjoy playing it as much, but if I really want to level my bloodweb, even a bad game of killer will give me more than a decent survivor game.
---
Honestly I think Legion is a pretty low-tier killer but I don't think that's a popular view on this sub

---
bing bong boi is best killer
---
Sooooo did the devs get the idea for the character from you? Did you create this character and used your own traits to define who the Huntress is?? The characters name is “The *Huntress*”, meaning she’s a female who hunts. She’s named The Huntress and not The Hunter for a reason.
---
The unhooking animation takes 80% of the recovery time though. Its better to bodyblock once you unhooked
---
I can see that. His livestreams are easier on the eyes.
---
&gt; She also made an unsafe rescue
---
Just out of curiosity, what constitutes a unsafe rescue? When the killer is still close?
---
Sure, obviously I was exaggerating for dramatic effect. Not every SWF group is Seal Team Six either ;)
---
Regardless, the advantages inherent in SWF are obvious, while the need to have the SWF mode to keep the game alive is also clear. But letting killers opt in and out of the mode would go a long way to reducing salt. 
---
For instance, no killer would ever be able to complain about SWF, ever again. They'd know exactly what they were getting into one way or another, because THEY chose it.
---
Nice strawman. I was actually explicitly saying the  opposite. The Leatherface had to play horribly there for the Ace to get out. 
---
If doctor's weapon is a dildo, why is he not top tier?
---
You deliberately misread my post, so I'm going to disengage from the conversation. I hope you have a good day.

Played a 4 man swf squaddette back in the day when instead of mist offerings we had moonlight offerings to darken or lighten the maps.

Got all 4 on a darkest moonlight mcmillains. God the hatemail was salty sweet.  I must have had wallhacks.

But I play on ps4 so I wouldn’t even know where to start a hack.

Eehh spirit ain't flat, she just ain't thicc. I can appreciate a tone booty.

I didn’t misread anything. You should’ve been more clear if you wanted to get an actual point across. Have a splendid day
---
Yea
---
I just got it I was so pumped!! 2 hex (gen killers) that spawned away from all gens and stayed live the entire game. They got it down to 1 gen left and the 3 gens were close by with the hatch in the center. I killed the 2 when they finished gen 4, got the 3rd close to the hatch and just spotted a bright orange shirt and killed her as she jumped for the hatch.. I couldn't believe nobody disconnected... it was beautiful. One of them was level 8 and I was lucky enough to kill him first that helped a ton!!
---
Haha ye, so convenient when we didnt want to play!

---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN PIG IS AS GOOD AS LEGION- oh it’s meme 😅 oops
---
I admire your commitment
---
Hot take: huntress is often overrated.
---
Huntress is strong for sure but her hatchets are inconsistent at best and has several maps that are pretty much an auto loss for her. I think she should swap with spirit and clown should move up to low A and this list will be pretty solid.
---
In addition to that, I always assumed the power is related to drug use, as one of the add ons is "no sleep pills". I imagined they were abusing amphetamines (or some other stimulant) while committing acts on the "mischief list". 
---
Then, the entity basically made the effects of stimulants into their power (but actually increasing their speed, obviously more powerful than drugs they were using on Earth)
---
&gt; While I will agree I don't see a trap there
---
That's literally the point of traps fam
---
Yeah, when the killer is nearby. Survivors lose points if they make a rescue and then the formerly hooked survivor is quickly downed. When in a game, you know that you made a safe rescue if a “Safe Rescue +500 Bloodpoints” pops up on your screen. It will take maybe 30 seconds or so before you see it. 
---
Myers is fun but very hard, Bubba I have some luck with if I only do chainsaw when it's a gimme, Doctor I am most successful with, I like Huntress but can't hit with the hatchets, Amanda Young can be nice in the right map and occasionally the Clown.

I realize what the developers *intended* the game to be like. But the reality is that this is the only game in it's category (comparing to F13 and Last Year) that *does* require any amount of skill. And that is what I think makes this game so much more enjoyable and long lasting than those other two.
---
Not to mention; the playerbase overwhelmingly treats it as competitive. Have you ever seen post-game chats? Shit-talk galore. Tryhard SWF groups teabag spamming. They pretend like it's a fucking international.
---
Despite what the developers want, I believe the skill-based competition of DBD is what draws players to it. I think they *should* cater the game more towards skill and balance rather than cheesy "WOAH" offerings and add-ons.
---
too soon
---
And my axe!
---
BING MOTHERFUCKING BONG
---
Get better at what? Avoiding swf groups burning all rare addons with voice chat?
---
Survivors should not play SWF or they'll never get better change my mind
---
Mine does. Asus. 
---
But anime is so good. Go watch JoJo’s bizarre adventure and try to tell me it’s the the greatest thing you’ve ever seen
---
Get better at dealing with these kinds of groups, yes. Learn some of the more obvious tricks and eventually learn the best way to deal with some loops or situations, friend.
---
He didn't have a darkening add on. The trap just appeared out of nowhere
---
A lot of survivors learn better with friends. Sharing techniques and whatnot.

Freddie's rework looks great
---
The entire skill check to wake up is 100% luck. It can be anywhere from 1 second to 90 seconds. The Blue Dress reduces the chance of skill checks dramatically, thus reducing lucks influence.
---
So the main argument is yes, 25% slower gen speed, sure. However the trade off is reliability. With triple power range, it is dramatically easier to have multiple sleeping players. The thing is  you remove a player from the game when you begin chase. Your power idea means if you can get a sleeping survivor within the 7m base power range,  they are weakened by 75% penalty. Getting multiple survivors asleep with base range means braking chase often to do so. I often don't have to break chase which effectively removes 2 players from game each time I sleep someone. With 21m power range, it is much much easier to keep 3 or 4 survivors asleep thanks to ease and the reduction of luck due to Blur Dress. You feel me yet? This is just items alone, not including perk synergy.
---
killers aren’t designed to deal with groups that use voice chat and coordinate. Well, Legion is but that pisses everyone off so there’s really no winning is there?
---
 Same thing happened to me. I was left with a random and I was the one who finished the last two gens left and was going back and forth to two exit gates trying to open one of them while I had a Billy rush me at both. When he finally downed me I saw the claudlette, crouched on the hatch. I found a purple key in the game.. I could’ve left you, but I didn’t and she just watched me struggle on hook :( still piped at least 
---
It was still hidden in dark grass
---
Like I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Traps are supposed to be hard to see
---
You fucking stood in an obvious trap spot. Deal with it
---
You already fucked up playing passed 666.
---
Perfect but you forgot the Bee
---
It's okay Fredward. Quentin's already dead anyways.
---
You can absolutely do that yourself, but you cannot deny that sharing techniques is somehow a worse way to learn. 
---
It's generally a tougher game with people who communicate, but you still learn things here and there. I've learned to fake pickups to bait a pallet or flashlight. I'm sure there are more things to pick up on. 
---
&gt; but you cannot deny that sharing techniques is somehow a worse way to learn.
---
...So you agree with me.
---
Very good point. As a Xbox one x player, I would hope for, at the very least, a steady 30 FPS experience, but sadly it’s not the case. It’s hard to see them caring about a switch release, but who knows
---
Unless it’s a baby legion :^)
---
Finally that phrase has always been stuck in my head for some reason.
---
actually i see more and more of this! well played!
---
I'll talk to them if they've really impressed me, like I had a Quinton who ran me around the whole map and knew where every single pallet was, I had to give him props for that or if there are DCs and I feel bad for kinda being rough but for the most part it's just GG
---
Farm corn, not friends 
---
Now I might get some flak for this, but why is she fat and brown?
---
Not to sure how console works but if there is SWF option and you sit in the same room with someone coundt you just swf or kyf with friends? still im not sure if ps4 and xbox even have SWF or KYF 
---
I love getting escorted to the hatch
---
I see a Raspberry Pi-Retro-Console. Nice 😻
---
That’s not utterly disproving anything. I’ve had survivors step in exit gate traps without the addon.
---
Oh yea pffft, I totally chase the last survivor to the hatch INTENTIONALLY also haha
---
*Cries in Frank’s Mixtape*
---
Robo Legion 
---
Now we just need a gun and whip killer and we will have all the badass boxes checked. 
---
It would be a super meta build, probably wouldn't come to fruition or it would throw the balance of the game a lot
---
When that Claudette main runs iron will. 
---
Damn boy she thicc 
---
Nobody said it's going anywhere. It *does* need to change, however. Even the devs know this; that's why they're implementing changes as to how the game works so voice comms aren't as much of a problem.
---
unfortunately, survivors have mostly uniform bootys. i have contacted behaviour but have received no response. I mean seriously, youd think our lord and saviour Jeff would be packin it but its flat as a field. i am offened by the representation of man ass here.
---
It went around after the assassination of Khashoggi several months ago.

Swap Remember Me for BBQ
---
Alright we’re gonna have a talk about Jake and Dwight they are the second and third best
---
lmao im gonna do that now thats funny af
---
I hate being the person to be like “lel what rank are you” 
---
But I swear there’s two different types of killers: the people who exclusively play killer and the people who do both. And the killers that are also good survivors are the ones you will never get away from lol 
---
Stop being such a snowflake; play the game and spend less time stressing about it. 
---
I'm sure by now, you can figure out that I can't actually tell you what to do. Get over yourself.
---
Ahhhhhh the dreaded 4 killer bug.  That's when you queue into a match with a killer and 3 immersed survivors. 
---
I don’t understand how to use his chainsaw. Even with speed add ons, by the time you rev the chainsaw, it finishes before you close the gap on the survivor and you just wasted time.
---
I was on board until I saw Legion in "doesn't tunnel"
---
I feel like my boi Michael wouldn't tunnel either
---
Tbh i dont think mikeys tunnel that much, yet piggies and freddies (especially freddies) tunnel quite hard.
---
Otherwise great list.
---
&gt;Don't act like you literally walk around never getting hit, that's ridiculous. 
---
That is entirely the point I was making.... your argument for self care being bad was essentially "don't get hit".
---
The only time legion doesn’t tunnel is when the survivors all dc 
---
Edited. I'm a bit baked and misworded
---
God I wish I went against non tunneling Michaels.
---
That's a bit extreme, but I also hate tunneling.
---
:(. Michael is so fun to play and go against. I'm sorry your experience with him so far haven't been amazing. Truly
---
What program is this?
---
If it’s me playing then Freddy wins by a long shot. I’m lucky to get one kill with Billy. He’s trash
---
Oh, don't get me wrong. Good Michaels are my absolute favorite killer to go against. But the majority for me either camp for no reason or tunnel hard.
---
I’m proud of you too
---
&gt; Prestige also gives you a 1% better chance per level. So 3% max. To get good add ons and offerings and possible level 2 or 3 of a perk right away.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It does make a difference. My P3 all perk pig gets crazy amounts of purple/pink/green stuff and rarely and brown. My lvl 50 all perk trapper gets much more yellow/brown stuff with few green and purple and maybe one or two pink each bloodwebs. There is a difference.
---
I listed the reasons why I chose to P3 even though I already knew about the "better bloodwebs" back then. I would be lying if I cared about such numbers enough to prestige. I only did it for the accomplishment and bloody skins. 
---
Took me 250 hours to get all killer teachables.
---
Then why are you telling me what to do in the exact same post? Lmao, what a hypocrite. I'm not a snowflake and I'm not anti-social. Get over yourself.
---
haha that's fine :P
---
It's a way to learn, but I think it is a worse way in this particular game. ofc different people learn in different ways tho so cest la vie
---
Had something similar happen where I thought the last survivor was going to be toxic because I had a game where I played pretty poorly and this Jake that was left kept fast vaulting over things. I assumed he was near the hatch and just wanted me to come over so he could teabag and go, but then he came closer to me and dropped a pallet, pointed at it so I could break it. We went through the whole map like that to destroy all the pallets. He didn't even wait up so he could get the stun points for himself. After the match he messages me to say gg and I thank him for the extra bloodpoints and he says "course, good killers deserve it". Just a small interaction but I had a pretty off night and that made it a little better 
---
Finally someone who agrees Fortnite sucks!
---
Think OP did a troll post, legion not being a toxic piece of garbage lmao yeah right 
---
I’m saying that during the game you can see what your teammates are doing while running around the map and just looking around 
---
Lol unfortunately it also gives you the most acute BS sense for r/deadbydaylight posts
---
Ooh, I bet you're right.
---
Pig, Leatherface, Huntress, Legion and Hag are the ones that have tunneled the most from my experience.
---
Imagine playing huntress on console
---
I hear ya,  I have to really really love a character to want to P3 them at this point.  The 3% bonus isn’t enough for me to prestige everyone.  
---
Plus I don’t play near enough to have that kind of BP lol. 
---
Ok there donald
---
yes you are a hero
---
[Hey! You forgot the power glove!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgu7GwbFdM)
---
Thanks, that's not what I meant though xv
---
So true. Also, playing both sides well unfortunately gives you the most acute BS sensor for r/deadbydaylight posts.
---
It's a good request but knowing the devs they'll just make the screen black like, 'we fixed the brightness issue.'
---
Anyone can say whatever they want, it's up to you as to how you handle it. 
---
In all fairness, I couldn't careless what or who you are. I'm gonna go play some dead by daylight and enjoy the game for what it is; and not spend my days wondering how I can solve world hunger (voice comms), lmao.
---
Have a great day.
---
Nea: Should I perform a Mori on him?
---
Michaels don't tunnel. It's totally contrary to his ability
---
So here's the thing about that. I run STBFL, which at max stacks reduces successful attack cd by 40% if I recall correctly. This combined with the ease of putting people to sleep allows me to tunnel 3 survivors at the same time.
---
Look at this:
---
As a Freddy player, you know that 85%+ of the time when a survivor is hooked, the savior heals them immediately as they often go "lol it's Freddy". Masterpiece allows me to patrol nearby gens an still react quickly enough to sleep both survivors, and then tunnel the original. All the while not only increasing my attack speed, but also keeping at least 2 survivors busy perpetually. Combine this with fire and forget play style you can easily keep 3 or all 4 survivors asleep, bringing the same to a halt without having to risk a late game gamble. 
---
The risks that come from my playstyle are lesser than the one you propose. 
---
You rely on finding the obsession early, which is problematic simply because of map spawning. If you can't find the obsession quickly, your strategy is running on time it doesn't have.
---
My strategy relies on the opposite, NOT finding the obsession first. 1/4 vs 3/4.
---
Let's look at synergies. I run STBFL and Ruin, this delays the game long enough for my mid game snowball to take affect, combining STBFL and Bamboozle shortens the average chase dramatically, allowing my bait tactic to kick in effectively BB&amp;C combined with the extended power range makes finding survivors much easier, as if you know some are nearby you can just fan back and forth as you walk and oftentimes sleep survivors you yourself cannot see as Masterpiece plays with the hitbox a bit involving corner. The Freddy I propose is meant to stop the late game from coming (where Freddy is weakest) while yours augments your late game to try and shift your power spikes. This is undesirable as late game you can be easily bullied by Rank 1's. I'm talking Rank 1's because I'm a Freddy main and have proof. I used to stream often and had about 85% 3k+ rate.
---
I can tell you why any add is bad. 
---
Class Photo for example.
---
The delay on putting them to sleep is not worth the vision it grants, as increases power range and BB&amp;C does the same thing with no power draw as payment. 
---
What else you got?
---
If you have adrenaline in this situation you really wouldnt need borrowed time since you will be full health and sprinting. I wouldnt run the 2 together but that's just me.
---
Yeah it not fun to get tunneled. But also it's not fun to lose completely beaches you didn't kill anyone and that person did gens. I myself don't tunnel if I don't have to but when there is 1/2 gens to go and person on death hook gets unhooked near me I'm not gonna to ignore it. Also if you unhook someone don't run away and hide killers will go for person they see.
---
That's pretty cool! But not many survivors actually run BT because it tends to glitch out even when it is supposed to work properly.
---
If a Pig downs, traps, and hooks someone and accidentally runs into that person after they get unhooked while they're searching boxes and re-down them, do you consider that tunneling?
---
I love it!
---
Oh you must be right. I'm hallucinating the multitude of times I've gotten tunneled to death instantly. Silly me.
---
Mebbe 
---
This gives shit post a whole new meaning
---
pretty sure it's only common on Xbox. You gotta level up Bill on PC to get it. So this is moreso a problem on PC. 
---
Myers only tunnels if he has Dying Light and your the obsession.
---
I did this at rank 11. I 3  Judith’s Tombstones, but only 1 tuft and one ward. I attempted twice with both ultra rare add-ons, and was only able to get 2 kills. Once I ran out of tuft, I used J.Myers Memorial paired with JT. I found I was able to stay in EW3 long enough to get more than one kill. I would chase and stalk until just a hair was left on EW2 and then stalk for last second right before I caught them. 
---
Perks: Play with your food (for speed bonus), Overcharge (slow down the game as much as humanly possible), Ruin ( self explanatory), BBQ and chili ( this didn’t actually come in handy at all), but it got the job done.

For the team!
---
You could see a huge grin on her face beneath her mask. It's horrifying. 
---
As a legion player, tunnelling is stupid 
---
Take mend time and power duration add ons then stab everyone in range, and chase down the last guy on the stab chain 
---
This is what drugs did to her

#YourBrainOnDrugs
---
Killers have been consistently buffed, they're literally in a better place than ever. What are you even talking about?
---
I only gave off useful information &lt;3
---
Tunneling 3 is very easy, you hard tunnel the first unfortunate soul you find and then break chase for 1 second each time you see another survivor within a 21m radius, which is huge btw. Kill one right away and keep 1 or 2 asleep during this process, with STBFL making it get exponentially faster each time, causing a snowball effect.
---
Here's the thing about Black Box I'll clue you in on; it's hot garbage. What if your obsession spawns even remotely close to another survivor? They can wake them up in seconds and then your add-on is 100% useless. Once again, a hard gamble. I deeply prefer reliability vs situationality.
---
Extra effort? You mean holding m2 and looking in a direction without breaking chase? With 0 risk of failure?
---
Hey man, if you can't refute my strats that's fine dawg, but you are gonna be the one playing subpar strats. I'll go try your strat right now and you try mine and gety back to me. Or not, you can keep playing inefficiently. 
---
Rancor is too situational 
---
Having the first two gens pop fairly quickly is commonplace.  The game slows down after that as they now have to devote time to altruism and you should be pressuring the remaining gens worth keeping hard at this point.  Games can be won simply by controlling what 3 gens are left remaining at the endgame. 
---
And to be fair the devs have more than hooked killers up with the last several updates.  The removal of the pallet vacuum was insanely good for killers.  They get and trade hits they never could have previously during loops.  And the buildings have been utterly destroyed with terrible window spawns.  There's only a couple buildings left in game worth looping now.  Your complaints seem to come from a place of inexperience.
---
I have had horrible teammates try and trap me to deliberately kill me. I've had ones repeatedly fast vault beside me to draw the killer while I attempted to remove a reverse bear trap. Survivors can be toxic to both killers and survivors. At least killers only have to worry about occasional survivors being toxic lol

I've very rarely played killer do I don't know what issues they have.

Lag.

Damn that's great a cosplay dude
---
Huh, weird. 
---
I main Pig (along with Trapper. I like bear traps lol) and I've seen people complain about Pig like this before and it's so odd because I don't understand why you would choose a killer and not use the power. Maybe they think the timer goes down during a chase? I dunno.

Love it! Very good compromise.

Who is your favorite killer 
---
I keep telling my friends that if they are not being chased they should get their butt on a gen. But they will say they were in the area of the survivor getting chased and can't move. 😂😂 because they're scared.
---
And then they wonder why they can't reach the red ranks. 
---
The killer can only chase 1 survivor yet my friends are shaking their boots in fear in a corner. 😂
---
Then I wonder why killers are so afraid of swf. 
---
It's really hilarious when I tell my friends on party chat to get their ass on a gen and they'll say how scared they are. 😂
---
It is a crutch perk build (which are the most meta), since those give the most "retries" in a sense.
---
could be a new killer power, summon a hook on a map that doesnt have any hook and put the survivors on it
---
My local thrift store, actually. Was looking into $100+ leather jackets online, then just happened upon one that was perfect
---
if this were real, i’d afk as killer, run bloodwarden and og noed for ez wins 
---
Do you or did you play Magic: the Gathering? There was a card a few years ago that saw a lot of play in certain decks called Bonesaw, and at every store I played in, there was at least one person who said that line when they played it.
---
^That person was me.
---
Nice still trying to get it 
---
3 weeks in 😂😂😂
---
anything’s a dildo.
---
dont hit 1k! it'll turn you into a salty insidious leatherface with noed!
---
Imagine being this stupid, body blocking is only bannable if you trap someone in a corner or the basement to take the game hostage.... which only the killer can do
---
Nope I don't.
---
Try using only JT and JMM. I found with tuft they were able to gen rush easily and counter my stalking, I wouldn’t make it into EW3 until there was only 1 gen left. It could have definitely been more hex placements though. When I finally got it, I had amazing hex placement and it lasted me the whole game 
---
Wraith is good
---
Please tell me the Power Glove reference was intentional. I still laugh at that shit after all my times seeing it.
---
As a Wraith main I second this. I have a very strong sense a karma vs survivors: you annoy me, I annoy you. Also people who spam loud noises to get killer's attention. I hate them with a burning passion.
---
Thanks dude I'll try it 👍
---
Good stuff. You played it right 
---
Either it's just super weird lag or a hacker (lagswitcher).
---
I mean, I had a dude tell me he hoped my mum got cancer after I moried him after having him teabag all over the place. Toxic people are toxic no matter what you do.
---
F in the chat for that seal boi
---
maybe!  I don't mind her being strong but there's a point where she's objectively crazy broken
---
Yup. They were super salty about it too. They spent the entire match hiding behind shit instead of doing anything. They were also the first to get hooked in the very beginning. I got them off the hook and found out they had aftercare. Apparently they had no idea how aftercare worked and had no idea I could see them the entire match. They sent me some bullshit messages about "nice sandbag" boo hoo waahhh poor me. I was the only one doing anything at all. They assumed that because they were farming people off the hook that they were being helpful and if it wasn't for the hook farming noob running in and unhooking me .00001 seconds after getting chased long enough for every gen on the map to be completed that they were "helping the team" and they didn't have to get me off the hook. 
---
It came down to me and that last person with aftercare. I brought the killer straight to them and spent the last 10 minutes doing to gen next to the hatch because of ruin/unnerving and the doctor hovering right over me. Worst match I've ever fucking had before. I got the hatch though. 
---
Felt great afterwards. I was the only one doing anything the whole match. Had done 2 gens by my damn self before all that shit went down. I don't regret it at all. People like that can fuck all the way off.
---
And that's the story about why I don't solo queue. Because every time I so fucked shit like that happens.
---
Nice,  I remember going for this one. I actually had a lot of fun trying since I love playing as Myers
---
Wraith main here. I, personally, do tunnel sometimes, if only because Wraith needs crutches and I have a strong sense of karma.
---
And a bonesaw is a kind of what? 🤔
---
Trapper was forced by the Entity more so than the wraith. The metal bars through his shoulders was the Entity torturing him, while the wraith is just unknown as to why he wanted to kill.
---
One word.
---
Lag
---
Me too. He has become my favorite killer. Wish I unlocked Him sooner 
---
nice comment deletion
---
Question to the Salty Player: are you bad?
---
I can
---
They aren't buffing killers so much as fixing the broken bullshit killers were dealing with. The same major issues persist untouched, they just changed the scoring system to change our paradigm.
---
Thank you. I think it's being part of this sub that helped me. 
---
I knew that I wasn't going to commit to an actual hatch stand off, so just run about. If he had got me then fair enough, not about to stand there waiting for something to happen haha.
---
I did before, then I moved to take a picture
---
Holy shit, this is BEAUTIFUL!

Oc? I’ve seen the same meme but different format at least 3 times
---
I got 4 achievements last night. Evil Incarnate, the one for surprise attacks as Bing Bong Boy, adept Bing Bong Boy, and one for doing a 4 kill mori which I got from doing the evil incarnate achievement,
---
Rip
---
Losing two gens doesn't mean losing the game tho. Do you expect to 4k every game at 5 gens? 
---
I've seen this bug happen at least a few times in my recent games, never to myself but to different teammates.   
---
Today I spectated a Jeff that couldn't escape on the Ormond map: running out of the gate would just allow him to circle the map itself like the Ace in this clip, and if he ran off the edge, he would drop from the sky to a random location inside the map. Hatch didn't work either so he ended up killing himself.
---
I firmly believe that Dwight's are the most skilled survivors. They aren't immersed like other people 
---
乇乂ㄒ尺卂 ㄒ卄丨匚匚
---
Amazing cosplay!
---
Yeah, I got the 4 kill one simultaneously 
---
Don’t really main killer but I always play up to at least rank one at the start of reset. Even as killer legion is gross, I don’t find it fun at all to go into game and know as soon as I see someone they’re going down not matter what 
---
They've for sure removed a lot of bullshit, but there are still some serious imbalances. Short of actively 3 gen guarding (which only goes so far) it's incredibly difficult to put enough pressure on to stop gens from popping. You can only chase one person after all. 
---
Skilled survivors have huge advantages over killer just by nature of how the game works, much less when you add in cancer loops and such. 
---
Yea I’d much rather play Legion than Freddy for sure. Before Freddy the Doctor was the worst for me. BHVR just hates us.
---
while all the others are true, (Doctor knowing where people are, ect.) none of them do all at the exact same time... Except for legion. Also, she basically has a free noed whenever she uses her ability (That is, if nobody mends of course, or you just tunnel them. OH! and that reminds me... Ahem). Also... She can run faster and hit multiple times in just a few seconds. Therefore, tunneling is massive on all of them. You hit them 3 (or 4 i forget(or 2 times with frank’s I believe)) and they are just insta dead. I am in no way saying legion is overpowered, I just think every killer should have at least one weakness. Honestly the biggest thing I have against legion is just how boring it is to play against. you get hit, you have to mend in the corner (unless she tunnels you of course, which you just die) and then get healed / heal yourself (I guess not required but... ya know) and after all of that is done, she just hits someone else which alerts her to your location and hits you again... Guess I’m mending again. Play legion if you want, I honestly don’t mind her and have learned how to loop her, but please for the love of god keep off frank’s mixtape. -signed a survivor main
---
Nice. I really like it.
---
I mean if a teammate is absolutely useless and does nothing or just continuously destroyed the rest of the team’s survival chances via sandbagging, etc.
---
My thoughts:
---
Can't judge Spirit, don't own her.
---
Hag, Freddy, and Legion are all way too low.
---
Trapper is too high.
---
Clown is way, way, \*way\* too high.
---
They don't need to dc in real life when they can just curb stomp you in real life. Wish that dbd had that option sometimes.
---
Hex: curb stomp
---
Allows the survivors to gang up on the most broken and annoying killer in the game once and smash his teeth into the pavement.
---
I'd argue Clown was a product of his environment due to a terrible father and no mother.
---
I run adrenaline. I was trying to say I wouldnt run borrowed time with that and deliverance hoping it worked out because it's just so unlikely. 
---
Well if that can be used as a dildo then so can every other weapon in the game if you think about it.
---
Learning to 360 is a waste of time until they fix hitboxes 
---
That's crazy. As a survivor main, I'd way rather be mori'd than hooked, at least I get a cool animation with my death that way Haha 
---
Wonder if that's the same I saw in the [Osaka aquarium](https://m.imgur.com/l4u2NgM)
---
Yo dawg, takw your DS discussion elsewhere, nobody asked you. Sorry but I don't understand why you guys have to make every thread about ds/noed?! I merely stated a fact how the devs stated ds was gonna get some changes ages ago, which obviously haven't happened yet. Idgaf what you think about the perks ^^
---
Actually I never see Myers tunnel (late game facecamping is another conversation) and Billy and Wraith are guaranteed tunnel. Bubba just facecamps.
---
That's fair though. I mean, if a survivor is being an ass and teabagging or something the whole time, I usually tunnel them
---
All of them are a dildo if you're brave enough.
---
I played a lot on console and she’s useless between the FPS and using a controller. Maybe just adapt the power to some sort of phase walk, kind of like a mega version of spirit’s passive phasing (not her haunting), like several little blinks with higher movement speed and less fatigue. I don’t want her to become useless and forgotten about.
---
On another note, do you know there’s already plans to rework legion, as well as every other poor killer (leatherface, freddy, etc)? :D
---
Why couldnt you get in it? Others still alive?
---
Ow, the edge!
---
The Freddy in the game is from the remake so going off of that, he counts as evil incarnate.
---
Yeah, I never see Myers tunneling, but Wraith and Billy is almost guaranteed
---
Same here, I'm not a killer to be cowardly.
---
So cool, love the mask work
---
a dildo
---
Wow
---
straight up bro, i tell you
---
You're cursed, cursed i say
---
When you're in a locker, you can not be seen with any aura abilities, including survivor onea.
---
The benefit of playing Kate or Meg.
---
I'd say its a nice change of pace having a killer that doesn't have to rely on survivors making bad plays in order to catch them. 
---
I am proud of you for being proud of him
---
He’s not op but he’s too easy and can’t be looped
---
130 hours in the game, nurse. Gens popped before i even reached the survivor with my blink. I usually get a 3k. But these fucking gen popping times are fucking insane. With me starting a chase on a person there are 2 gens done in an instant.
---
You should've split them up.
---
Yes and no
---
I do consistently well at rank 1 ending games with gens up while maining some of the weakest killers in game Trapper, Wraith, Pig. These games are ours to win or lose at this point in the games balance.  It no longer requires survivors to make mistakes to win games as killer.  If you play a strong game you have a lot of control for how it unfolds.  I feel this is just clinging to a 6 month outdated killers mindset of the game being overwhelmingly balanced for survivors.
---
&gt;furry dicks
---
_cept for that._ ಠ_ಠ
---
2 gens popping constantly whenever i get into a chase is perfectly normal.
---
But ....
---
If I’m about to start struggling or about to die, go ahead and save me. At least give me a chance. 
---
Class photo Freddy has the potential to outdo Billy if he isn’t also using his best addons but even then that’s not even always true.
---
A salty rant from a salty killer. Just DBD things.
---
You're playing one of the most mobile killers available. And 130 hours still isnt that much. But if you are getting 3k then you're doing better than the average so I'm not sure you should be as angry as you are about it. Plus theres variance. When I play killer theres some days I just make bad decisions and get outplayed. You're not playing against bots so even if you are the best player in the world. Sometimes you get outplayed.
---
Dw I conpleted all 5 gens broke all the totems and noed saved everyone then got downed and they left me
---
I'd say clown more gains pleasure from killing than just being evil. With Freddy and Myers, evil is who they are, it's what they live (if they're alive?) for. For Clown, killing was more of a means to an end. Of course, it's described how he felt the power from first killing the bird in his hands, which could be described as deriving pleasure, and then he started killing to get something he coveted. He's more interested in the result of the killing rather than the act itself.
---
Petition to give all killers a dildo lookalike weapon 🤔
---
\*Misses ds and insta dcs 
---
I'll admit I worded it poorly, it was intended to be more along the lines of Legion still being around the same level as other killers, but they mostly need changed to actually be fun to face.  Right now they're either (close to) balanced at the cost of being horrifically unfun with either Frank's Mixtape or their best Michael Jackson impression, or they're pretty weak when playing the way the Devs intended.
---
Isn’t it the greatest :-)
---
Does the refund button still work?
---
Wait a minute...
---
I'm not surprised he didn't even chase you, how can you not respect that
---
And Mr. Choppy!
---
Bong Bong
---
The most terrifying killer idea I’ve ever seen. Imagine that thing chasing you omg 
---
Dude imagine that thing chasing you AHH
---
Cloaked and probably standing right on top the hatch
---
That is so good. Good job dude!
---
**CONTEXT:** 1 DC, 1 suicide, 4 gens left. I was being chased for literal minutes and this guy kept walking around me and didn't do a single gen. My friend spectated him and said that he literally just ran around doing nothing, not even a single gen. For some reason the killer decided the guy deserved a win anway.
---
I actually despise being given hatch. I don't want pity, or for the killer to feel like they win even more by letting me live. It's not even about BP anymore at that point. I crawl away to a hook and either bleed out or get hooked. Not sure why, but I just hate it
---
You shine it on people and it heals them.
---
The bee and the nea are missing omg &gt;:(!
---
anything
---
Tat worthy looks dope
---
Nice! You should save that outfit for Halloween 
---
The problem is, multiple survivors can work on up to three different gens (over half their objective) while the killer can only chase one person at a time with a guarantee of only one hook if they manage to catch and hook them (1/12 of their objective, with three hooks per each of the four survivors). 
---
-_-
---
I AM ZE UBERMENSCH!
---
What are you talking about?  Why would Pig tunnel teabaggers?  She can just teabag right back!
---
Hahahah
---
Stop posting weeb shit on subs that don’t have anything to do with weeb shit. Y’all weebs have your own fucking subs
---
Story time:
---
I used to only play certain killers, like Michael and Huntress. I always stayed away from nurse, because I thought she was this really hard god tier killer, so I never tried. It wasn't til I was rank 1 that I decided to really try her. My take away from playing more nurse lately, is that she is actually really easy. I would consider spirit to be the hardest in the game, and nurse is easier than most killers.
---
Tl;dr Nurse is really easy to play.
---
Happened to me last week.  A Spirit was giving me an escape by dropping me out the exit gate and this happened.
---
So how do you deal with him? Try to juke him the best you can or what?
---
Legion doesn’t tunnel? His whole play style is to tunnel...
---
Yikes dude too real
---
I’ve seen a lot of Aces with pebbles 
---
Agreed, kind of a testing grounds would be nice with so many survivors and killers.  
---
That’s the survivor actually. One of his perks is supplexing the killer
---
10 seconds is all. If they dont get downed for 10 seconds it is considered safe
---
What are you doing up there!?
---
Idk how the boxes work. I had the timer add-on + takes longer to take gear off, the same combo I went up against which gave me only one and a half boxes until it killed me.
---
Used it on my pig and no one died, every time they got it off when it was on.
---
Played pig the most and it barely ever seems to activate as they get it off so quick.
---
Found it most useful when the gates are open to prevent them from going out.
---
I never said Self Care is bad. I just don't think it's that good. Here's the logic. The only time you will need self care is if you're injured AND not looping the killer. If you're injured and not looping the killer, your time is much better spent doing part of the objective that helps end the game. Of course that's a blanket statement that's not meant to cover every single scenario in the game, but I've had plenty of games where I was hit 1 time and never saw the killer again. Self Care would be legitimately useless in that case, and that's just one example
---
Excuse me, Its the first time I ever try to discuss it. Guess youre just not open to it
---
a
---
&gt; On another note, do you know there’s already plans to rework legion, as well as every other poor killer (leatherface, freddy, etc)? :D
---
i've heard a bunch of different things about Legion and I still remember them talking about a "leatherface cube" soon after he was released that never culminated in anything.  Sooo idk.
---
Really good! But the mask seems kinda small imo
---
Or when the teammate that the killer is chasing comes to rescue you.
---
any time someone tells me wraith is a low tier killer
---
oh shit u right
---
Real impressive... we all know you were only able to take the pic because of Frank's.  
---
Seriously though awesome cosplay.
---
Damn this community really be comin together!
---
Why can Mikey boi kill without hooking? He's the only DLC I don't have and personally I think this is BS
---
This has always confused me, Isn’t it the killers objective to kill the survivors? I know it isn’t great to play against but neither is having 3 gens pop after downing your first survivor.
---
Yo I think it might be. He kept hitting me as well. The difference was that two teammates attempted to save me but got smacked and ran only to heal and try again. They didn't return to a gen. 
---
... my people need me...
---
thats whys its impossible to me, i lack patience to play immersive. i hate beeing immersive :X im destined to fail miserably vs nurses
---
How does that sound fun at all for the survivors though? People derank as it is. This would be terribly unfun. 
---
It gets annoying when every time you try to have a normal conversation some douchenozzle gives their two cents about the perk without anyone asking him.
---
What about dying light that basically forces you to tunnel the hell out of the obsession?
---
The problem is im not getting outplayed. I land nearly every fucking hit. And the gens still get done in 20 seconds. The devs can fix this by just increasing the gen timers by 10-30 seconds, thats what most killers are asking for. The gens get done in an instant without ruin, and even when you have Ruin it gets found in the first minute because of a shitty spawn.
---
&gt; It amazes me that more legions don't run thanatophobia
---
Because it is a bad perk that does not do much.
---
Trapper is least cause I always step in his traps. 
---
Spirit is favorite cause I like to play mind tricks with her. 
---
Thancc 
---
:’(
---
She actually is in red tier you just can't see her. 
---
if the killer is face camping 99% of the time you are going to get hit before the unhook, because if you go for the save right away, a high ranked killer will get the yoink
---
Sorry, I can't find the last post they had about this but it sounds like the chatel (that's structure with the fire pit in the center of the Ormond map) is known for weird stuff like this (might be why they disabled it for a bit after release, but the map is still sometimes janky), one guy was saying that because of its multi-layers and multiple complex pathways, while you think that you're going upstairs because of lag or desync in the killer's game you're actually stuck on the stairs because the server thinks you're too clumsy to get up the stairs (it has you running into the bannister when in your game you're obvi deftly running along it). So when he hits you your game updates and is like, oh, my bad, you're supposed to be over here because the server couldn't figure out what you did. Sorry, I hope that makes sense and is correct.
---
Well how about you tell these « douchenozzles » politely that you arent open to discussion, without agressing their way of thinking or trying to open a debate. Heck, if it happens « every time » how about indicating at the end of ypur original comment that you are, in fact, not open to discussion
---
*Sad Wraith Noises*
---
Well, what you said is to fake the unhook to take a hit. Which seems pointless imo
---
I only dodge SWF players really and players who i have played against who happen to be toxic.
---
Yeah. I hope you report those kind of people, they just ruin the game for everyone.
---
Why only 150 upvotes? Get this on the front page! Gave me a pretty good laugh.
---
Oink!!!
---
Please ignore my terrible intro
---
Rancor is just a free Mori
---
Yeah sure, I'll add this at the end of EVERY comment, like it's a signature. You notice how stupid that sounds right? Also read my last edit, I am really waiting for an answer to that question
---
[Ormond lag](https://youtu.be/zErHoli5kiI) I had a similar situation with that building as well. 
---
Part 2: https://clips.twitch.tv/VibrantOriginalBananaNinjaGrumpy
---
And this was the end: https://clips.twitch.tv/SneakyPoisedLorisRaccAttack
---
Funny thing is that killer’s aura reading is fully disabled within 4 meters of the killer, so the tiers actually don’t make a difference 
---
Ormond is bugged to hell and back. This has been an issue there its entire existence 
---
FUCK YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Did you get that from Ubik???
---
Bing bong :D
---
TAKE THAT P3 CLAUDETTES
---
Yep!! He gets 100% credit for the mask. Super nice dude too! 
---
Extending the time does nothing but ensure your usual 3k is now always a 4k and thats not how the game was intended. 
---
In an alternate universe, when all three of my allies escape, I'll sometimes let the killer throw me on the hook.
---
It's funny when they carry me to a gate or the hatch anyway, but I keep crawling back to a like I'm saying, "NO, I WANT TO BE SACRIFICED."
---
Free points. ❦ The least I can do for all the kind killers who have let me escape, allowed point farming (even though I think that's no bueno now), and allowed everyone to do their event requirements when there was one.
---
Run Ruin
---
She found you cuz you ran, and running leaves marks that the killers can see
---
Totally worth the work!
---
How'd you make the mask?
---
Meg is only second to huntress. She thicccc.
---
Meme vs Meta, your choice 
---
I'm just throwing shit at the wall so high ranks can have a bit more balance while retaining the current way low ranks play, as it stands nerfing survivors heavily or buffing killers heavily to even the scales would throw low ranks out of wack and new players would be completely trash canned.
---
As for deranking that's always going to be an issue no matter what you do, people smurf in any game that has any semblance of rank.
---
But you also need to know how to work her power. And by that I mean that you need to know exactly how far her power will go, and not only that but where the survivor will go when they know you are trying to blink towards them.
---
For Nurse mind games are completely different from any other killer, since she completely ignores palletes and windows it's a game of where they will go. Will they go to the left, the right, back towards me, or away? Will they throw down the pallete, vault that window, or fake it? Will they keep running around the corner or are they faking it?
---
So no, you can't just play the other killers and be able to play Nurse. This is not what I'm trying to argue about tho, I'm just saying that Nurse is no where near comparable to Legion, due to the fact that his power is no where near as complex in the mind game department, and is simply not satisfying
---
The mask was the only pre-made part. Bought it from https://www.etsy.com/shop/UbikMaskArt?ref=s2-header-shopname
---
Came here to make sure someone either said or posted this. You did both. 
---
Good on you. 👍🏻
---
This is like, recent, like, a week ago.
---
Also, a secondary objective for the end of the game is being worked on for ‘soon’
---
It doesn’t always make sense though. 3 healthy survivors working on gens while you go after the already injured survivor is far less beneficial to you than what could end up being 1 healthy survivor being chased, another healthy survivor off gens healing the injured guy, and 1 doing gens, then someone else having to go unhook when you eventually down the guy. Otherwise you’re just going to get gen rushed 
---
Lmfao, that wasn’t what I expected but I loved it.
---
I main Pig aswell, i play both survivor and killer equally, but when i play killer its usually Pig or Hag, and yes i dont tunnel too, what happens is that i run Make Your Choice, so when i get back to the hook i look for the exposed guy instead of the one with RBT. Sure, if i get back to the hook and dont find anybody, i will just go to the nearest Jigsaw Box since there its where the survivor with RBT is most likely. But 99% of the time i play survivor against Pig, they just tunnel the shit out of the unhooked guy, even if the trap is activated, it kinda bugs me because its the wrong thing to do.
---
We still had 3 gens left so it wasn't even that. Dude was just a prick
---
The fandom of this game spans generations. Many don’t get it. 
---
But someone posted the video in the comments. So, there are those among us who get it. :)
---
That's absolutely incredible! I love the shading!! 
---
If I run Dyling light I usually take a Mori so I don’t have to tunnel.
---
This is just re-skinned legion, honestly have no idea how they came up with this concept and didn’t realise that hahaha 
---
From the looks of it, it seems like the Wraith sloppy Butcher bug is still a thing when this was recorded meaning it could be pre update
---
oh, coolio!
---
Sad story
---
Low skill cap has nothing to do with tier. Legion is goddamn strong.
---
&gt; Games can be won simply by controlling what 3 gens are left remaining at the endgame.
---
And then you get flamed for gen camping 
---
You wouldn't want to from decisive. Also there's play with your food too. And your save the best for last stacks
---
I guess we will just need to agree to disagree because I feel the exact opposite. It's their game to win or lose. If they fuck around i can take control, if they play optimally there's not a lot to be done.
---
I'm not saying you can just pick up nurse and be able to play her well at all, I was more saying if you've put in 1000 hours into other killers and then play nurse you'd play better than someone who hasn't played 10 hours as killer whereas Legion it doesn't /really/ matter if you've played 1000 killer hours or 10 the mechanics are such that those people wouldn't play much differently. Now that doesn't mean that you can't get better at playing Legion, they still have a skill ceiling but it's lower than a lot of other killers especially Nurse
---
Ew 2 sweaty 5 me, where da pebble at?
---
I denounce this wolf in sheep's clothing!
---
When Your Chasing A Survivor And They Slam A Pallet ~~in~~ near Your Face.
---
Freddy is pretty unanimously decided to be the worst. So it should be best: nurse, everyone, then worst: Freddy
---
He has "my friend and I as our favorite killers" in the title.
---
I guess you can't misread something if you don't actually read it in the first place
---
&gt; I don't believe that people choose a character and don't use their ability optimally.
---
Not sure why you find it hard to believe, this happens in literally every multiplayer game that has characters with abilities haha.
---
He also missed freddy, just weird how he can't do gens tho but he's the best survivor in my opinion
---
He can only do it with a Mori (like every other Killer) or with rare and ultra-rare add-ons (Tombstone Piece and Judith's Tombstone). In the second case, those add-ons make it take absolutely FOREVER to get enough evil to hit EW3.
---
Exposed, tapp was originally white. His skin color now is a lie.
---
these crows spawn way too soon lol
---
by leaving the game and winning.
---
Yiiiikes. Didn’t even see that. I’ll admit, goofed up.
---
well the nips can be
---
&gt; It no longer requires survivors to make mistakes to win games as killer.
---
Eh, I don't think this is true for the average player. Killers inherently have less room for error than survivors so survivors fucking up is necessary to an extent for most people playing killer. 
---
Not my screenshot. I was one of the Dwights and the killer sent this to everyone in the game because he was confused. 
---
If you click your flashlight at me or teabag behind a pallet or point and "come hither" when a chase starts, you better be prepared to get my undivided attention until either the round ends or the spider god takes you in her sweet sweet embrace.
---
So he can kill without hooking as long as he brings a Mori? Or he has to obey the Mori rules to get the kill, but just add-ons allow him to kill without hooks
---
I guess just because it seems so crazy to me. Like, I'm not gonna pick a killer with a certain ability and not use that ability correctly. I just can't process doing that
---
Nurse is placed higher than everyone else even on a "tier lists are bullshit" post XD can we remove a blink and add some fatigue or something here, devs? 
---
.
---
I find the game tends to slow a bit when the 3 or 2 gen portion arrives. That is, if I can build momentum off of that first hook.
---
And if course, it will always depend on survivors playing less than optimal by healing after you've injured multiple ones. 
---
I think you mean "what survivors think happens."
---
You literally just run to the opposite side of the map immediately and you'll find at least 2 survivors being dumb and hopping on the first gen they spawn near.
---
Be careful who you bully in middle school
---
I said consistently.  I play a lot of killer man.  This isn't a once off thing.  And if you're still finding that to be your mindset it sounds like you yourself are not playing optimally as killer.  
---
As a trapper player, I feel this in my bones. Sure, some games you'll have people walking into traps all day long, but a nurse would still julienne those potatoes faster and cleaner lol
---
Honestly the best thing is to just run in a straight line and get distance because good players won’t lose you even without scratch marks. Playing vs legion is basically get hit -&gt; run -&gt; mend -&gt; repeat 
---
Bing bonh
---
Fortnite does suck and besides, it has nothing to do with this whatsoever. 
---
I like catching them and throwing them again.
---
Freddy is a big meme and can actually be devastating in the right hands
---
Joke's on you, dogshit milkshakes are Leatherface's go-to for washing all that human meat down! 
---
thats a creepy af mask holy shit
---
I'm meaning it's literally against the rules of this sub. Not saying that calling him out is bad. Just don't call him out here? You're all so sensitive, damn.
---
Ah didn't know that. I'm on PS4 so it always shows up for me. 
---
Oh god why
---
Exactly! So many survivors just stand on it and the killer can't do jack shit about it except pretend to not be in range or vision to grab. What you did there was great for both players!
---
It's more when you're in red ranks and every single survivor has it. More often people use it to dash to get to a pallet rather than wait for the actual swing, so it becomes a perk that just continues looping rather than "just wait for them to use it then hit them"
---
If it's "-rep don't tunnel me you idiot trash facecamper" idk how that's going to impact gun skin trades lmao.
---
Killer: Enduring / Mr.Juggles
---
MUahahahahahaha 
---
*chortles in bing bong*
---
Billy without addons is a complete, well rounded killer. Freddy needs him his good shit
---
So can the titties, so can the titties.
---
Great for both of us? What do you mean?
---
Cause I didn't waste our time?
---
juke, for a nurse to be good they have to read where you're going, so dont let them
---
someone didn't think this through 
---
Ah, misread your question. Thought you meant "why can he kill without sacrificing?" 
---
Yeah, the add-ons give him the ability to Mori even if the target hasn't been hooked, but it's pretty rare that that would happen in practice because of how long it takes you to get up to EW3 if you're using them.
---
I'm not making it a competition when I say....The Pig art, Huntress art, Nurse art is 100% times better than the Legion doodles people take 5 minutes to make. This is amazing.
---
You mean a margherita pizza, right?
---
So it would be your great idea.
---
Wraith: "And my someone else's spine!"
---
Yeah it did take awhile, he got two of my teammates and I think he absorbed all the evil he could from us
---
it's cause you were downstairs with your MCwifi
---
I would only put the shape into the evil incarnate category, freddy and clown really belong in the "gains pleasure out of killing" category
---
Gen camping isn't a thing that exists unless you're playing Doctor with addons in a way that is meant to solely keep them tier 3 while never engaging in a chase.  Basically just playing to drag out a game and not win it much like a final hiding survivor with 4 gens left that refuses to repair.  
---
And you can call it whatever you want but bottom line Hex the removal of the pallet vacuum fundamentally changed how chases play out.  It isn't enough to simply pallet loop anymore.  They have to be 100% optimal to continue to loop you and even then because of the vacuum they need to legit juke you yo make some of these pallets now. 
---
You thought spirit furry and enduring was godly. Now we can just cock block the look with a hook...
---
It'll be the swamp dock, likely.
---
I agree as a killer main.
---
By the same token survivor should solo que sometimes. 
---
The only was to learn how to deal with SWF is to face them. Although some are pains in the asses a lot of them aren’t the god players that they are cracked up to be. 
---
Get the weak link and watch them scramble to save them. 
---
By the way, if I am swf I am the weak link. 
---
please stay that way. it’s so wholesome. 
---
Awww i think someone needs a hug
---
Yeah, if you're using a Tombstone Piece to do it, it drains you back to EW2, meaning you have to go through the long stalking process again and it's near-impossible to stack up enough evil to do it more than twice.
---
If you're using the red Tombstone, you can get all 4 survivors - if you can catch 'em (carrying it slows you down considerably).
---
Freddy
---
Wait, THATS how big the DS skillcheck is?  How do people ever miss?
---
I actually didn't know this was a thing.
---
A. I'm not the OP.
---
B. This is kyf we're talking about. The "fun with friends mode" (swf is a sweatfest), so let there be crazy options to tinker with. I think it would be fun.
---
&gt;It's an instrument of punishment *heh heh heh!*
---
Bing bong bing bong 
---
[AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA](/intensifies)
---
I did actually try to organize this list by the most dangerous weapons per-say, that's why Clown's giant fuck-off knife is top tier of "has a knife" tier while Pig's letter opener is at the bottom.
---
Trapper lunges further than any of the other Killers I'm pretty sure. So in that aspect weird home made cleaver thing has the same range as a fucking Katana.
---
r/redditsings kinda
---
honestly its fine, I like being to actually see for once as fredster
---
I'd love a Killer with a whip tbh
---
Dun dun nu
---
This is the right answer
---
This is exactly it. There are so many people who complain for extending the game more. All that does is ensure a 4k. That's not how this is supposed to work. You cannot have 130 hours in a game where people have thousands and start making the rules. This is as closed to balanced that it has ever been.
---
The better you get the better people you play against are. This leads to more challenges and less kills. That's how competition is supposed to be.
---
Ok and what is this exploit people are talking about is it gamebreaking?
---
Sorry,  I can't 
---
Puppers and Cahlaflour are really nice chill people.
---
Morf_UK is my favorite. I feel like he gets lumped in with a lot of the "toxic" crowd but I think that's mainly because he's friends with so many folks who play and stream, and he has a very sarcastic personality. Thay same sense of humor is what makes him so entertaining for me. He's one of Hybrid's favorites too. 
---
I've had people do this when I'm trying to let them escape.  It turns into a reverse hatch standoff.
---
Where are these god Freddy mains you speak of? Everyone I see playing Freddy are wishing they could even be Trapper, he may have a useless ability but at least his ability isn't actively hurting him
---
Love it!
---
Claudette*
---
It does.
---
Jokes aside I think a perk that granted you a Mori later on in the game ~~not Devour Hope~~ would be pretty interesting. Something like a Mori for every 4/3/2 generators that is done? The mori would obey regular moris but still.
---
The problem does still lies in Moris being an inherently unfun and rather unbalanced mechanic though. :/
---
True. Not sure why they would block aura reading on the survivor side of other survivors
---
who says freddy doesnt tunnel?
---
if you tunnel as pig you're playing her wrong, at least what I mean is you shouldnt chase someone if they have a trap on their head and you have the choice to chase a non trapped person
---
The single best way to outplay a legion is to not heal fully after mending deep wound. This forces them to not use their power again in order to down you. By not healing however, you expose your team to thanataphobia, forcing you to make the choice to waste time healing it off (and just getting deep wounded again by legion's power), or to slowing power through the reduced repair speeds. This gets even nastier when 3-4 of your team members are faced with this choice.

Piggy: I has knife?
---
Bonk
---
Bamboozle is my go to. Vault the window and they’ll either drop the pallet or move on most of the time. 
---

---
That’s people de ranking I’d Imagine, rank 1s go back to ten.
---
GG LOL!
---
The only thing that I disagree with is the nurse being s tier 
---
r/decreasinglyverbose
---
Wow that normally takes two to three pallet hits with 0 misses for me. Good job.
---
&gt; they need to legit juke you
---
oh no the horror how will survivors ever go on
---
Someone: The Pig is garbage.
---
Me: Bing Bing your opinion is wrong.
---
I just picked her cuz she owns the perk
---
but then again no one can body block freddy, and body blocking is a lot more common than saboing
---
This is usually said after a killer kills a surv that had adrenaline/ds
---
All these downvotes and y'all know it's true. More than half the survivors in the game can smear this scrawny little teens ass across the maps but we spend the whole game being moonwalk tunneled and mending instead. 
---
Short answer on why it works out the way it does for everything you’re frustrated about is because of p2p connection. 
---
Side note: If most of the lobbies you join are above 200 ping even after a couple seconds, it may not be the killer’s internet or matchmaking. Not every killer lives in your city and usually the lobbies with suspiciously low ping are bugged lobbies anyways.
---
999 hours of putting up with bull shit hits good job soldier 
---
why would you run bbq on a tombstone myers build
---
DBD dev nibbas be like we won't fix this game bro.
---
When i got mine it was basically a miracle cause most matches i tried doing the achievement a surv would always dc and they would find annoying ways to stop me from getting it like a tea-bagging swf I went against that at the end the last surv would just stay in locker to stop me from getting the mory.
---
Spot on. Looks great! I am going check out that etsy page that linked to, also.
---
Because I haven't leveled Bill  
---
Bloodpoints are a commodity for a reason
---
karma for having that op borrowed time buff with the new deep wound status effect
---
*Asian
---
I just found out that it's not a common perk on PC.
---
I play on PS4 and it's a common one for us. 
---
I'm not that new to the game but I still don't understand adrenaline.
---
 Is it really that good? 
---
I see a lot of streamers and high tier survivors use it but it's only viable in one moment of the game.
---
why do people use it?

Bitch please. I got enduring 3.
---
I was just replying. Tell that to btrash
---
PS4 player, solo survivor. Lobbies are taking forever and i end up with 5 legion games in a row. Have to take a break for a while because I am seriously not enjoying this game at all lately
---
Yeah but we can put the bitch fit tamper tantrum down for 5 seconds and appreciate a good cosplay regardless. Grow up.
---
Jokes on you. Suicide is technically dc
---
Yeah?? I'd love to see bonesaw face up against my man Captain Insano! He shows no mercy!
---
Where the freddy mains are? Mainly in the official discord and uh, im a freddy main too. I cringe every time i see a big streamer trying to play freddy because they play him just wrong (block addons, dream tunneling etc. Then they complain about freddy being weak)
---
Spirit ready to worship that dildo; mouth wide open
---
There ain't no temper tantrum. It was a joke. One that went way over your head obviously. You would have got the joke if you weren't so sensitive. 
---
Lol my fault for trying to have an intelligent discussion with you Hex.  Keep regurgitating lines back sarcastically I'm done feeding you today.
---
I get why you’re annoyed, but you’ll find your answer at the start of your post. You don’t play killer and are rather new as a survivor, and this really is just kind of a “git gud” situation. 
---
Leather face is... really weak. All he has is a triggerable instadown with a wind up that can be avoided even easier than a regular attack.
---
Billy is a stronger killer but by no means OP, stay out of the open and if you gotta sit in a weird spot then have a plan on how you can get to a loop quickly if he shows up.
---
Too late.
---
All of them
---
no, swap blood warden for bitter murmur, put every one in sleep state, and start slugging every one. (blood warden is never going to activate because will take ages to open the door).
---
Please make one on how open their mouths are in the picture
---
Glad you liked it dude! :)
---
Fuck me
---
Tier lists don’t matter as long as you have fun
---
you're not wrong, id still do it if I really wanted to play a specific build that doesn't work with sfw (something that uses knockout for example) but id usually just switch to another killer if a sfw group shows up.
---
Amazing art work!
---
&gt;or to slowing power through the reduced repair speeds. 
---
See. It is not that much of a slow. 15% at best if you run TierIII and all 4 survivors are injured.
---
1 Survivor needs 80 seconds to finish 1 generator on his/her own.
---
12 seconds longer is not worth a perk slot for me.
---
Now, granted, you might run into survivors who are discouraged from repairing when the Thanatophobia icon lights up, but they really should not.
---
U gay
---
God dammit killers were already weak enough back then now they have nerfed one of the beat perks. Ffs
---
I wish they would do a shorter skirt for the huntress. Show us some calves man
---
I only got to loving legion before I saw something off
---
But what if I try to kill myself and then unplug the life support.
---
It would say "deleted" somewhere in this thread if that was true, also no one else accused me of that so you are utterly full of shit and your desparate to not look like a fuckwit. Bad luck champ now fuck off. 
---
Oof
---
Actual decent Huntress players are the second scariest thing next to Nurse players. The not so good Huntress players are one of the easiest to escape.
---
Why are there 4 different sounds when Legion has just 2?
---
spirits = *waluigi noises*
---
Piggy, legion, doc, Freddy and wraith are the worst.
---
Cant comment back pussy
---
I usually get the kind of teammates that RUN BACK TO ME... with the killer chasing them in the hopes that the killer goes for me instead of them.  
---
 
---
 I seriously hope those people get hit by a truck Jesus fuck lol.
---
One for each boy no?
---
someone should make a tier list of what actually matters, how fun a killer is to play
---
Stop playing SWF with comms and you won't get better. Change my Mind.
---
Staying away from you! 
---
The point is that the game shouldn’t have a mechanic where the killer needs to give up a kill because it’s not worth it
---
Most pigs do chase the trapped person though. It’s the worst thing to do as pig. 
---
Standing on the hatch keeps a survivor from jumping in? How did I not know that.
---
Lmao I carry them over the hatch to build their hopes and then put them on a nearby hook. Or drop them and mori them on the hatch.
---
Is it really unfathomable to see the correlation between "Get 2 sacrifices" quests and straight face camping?
---
entitled is the perfect word to describe the situation
---
Normally when you get hit by frenzy your health bar doesn’t drain in a chase, this gets circumvented by walking backwards and following blood/scratch marks so that they just sorta die without you actually doing anything.
---
Well technically he did.
---
Agreed.
---
That was my thought
---
Peppa pig + heroin + John Kramer - heroin + bullet + entity = the pig
---
Is it harder to look behind yourself while running on console? I very rarely see console players looking back while looping/fleeing killer.
---
I feel you. However considering that a lot of the more powerful exposed perks go to waste on legion, I feel that combining on hit status effects works real well with him. Third seal, sloppy, and Frank's work great in conjunction. 
---
Im not worrying, I know its just a meme, the only people who actually hate them are impressionable kids who took the meme (from like 2008 mind you, not even a relevant or funny meme) way too seriously
---
I wish they would put something other than boxers under megs shorts angry emoji
---
I believe Frank and Joey have the same voices, same with Julie and Susie 
---
I think it was a joke. 
---
Good thing Spirit isn't your favorite killer, that would of been weird
---
ok
---
If you had three pets, like dogs, you could get them to cosplay as the rest of the gang. Or master quick costume changes
---
Do lockers work against scratched mirror myers also?
---
Yellow is where it's at.
---
You could do the gens and escape? That's the logical conclusion. Sacrifice your bro for the greater good.
---
Wot, this is news to me, I'm pretty sure I've heard multiple stun sounds before.
---
I am playing DBD on a computer and I can't figure out how to make the "come here" motion. I can point by pressing 1, but how can I make this other-- infinitely more useful-- gesture? 
---
I agree to that, you can just do gens as survivor, ive done it myself, playing killer you basically can camp at the hatch and waste your time while they do gens, or you can patrol the map just HOPING they dont know where it is and you find them first
---
well fuck man its pretty worthless now
---
Yeah. NOED for the Haste lol said no one ever
---
Commits disconnect
---
So the new killer can down survivors with his power... Well it sounds strong but bubba and legion also can... 
---
The 2 button does it for me.
---
letting survivors escape is throwing the game
---
DC - 625 brutality points
---
Hooking is 500 each time you hook, and 200 points for each hook phase. So assuming they dc when you down them it could have been 1100 points. But if they dc before you can win a chase then you probably miss another 1000+ from chasing and downing.
---
Some times you can double dip while using a mori, if they dc after you've triggered the full animation sequence then you can usually get the 1000 from the mori and the 625 quitter bonus.
---
How do you open the hatch w/ a key on PS4?
---
yes, it has farther distance, and you want to make him faster? that doesnt make any sense
---
