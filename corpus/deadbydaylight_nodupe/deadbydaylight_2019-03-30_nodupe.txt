I got locked in a locker too lol it was also against the plague 
---
---
---
Exactly! There is not a downside to doing something like this which makes me think they are just completely unable to distinguish an actual disconnect from a rage quit. I just have hopes that dedicated servers will help punish it but unfortunately, with how this game has been handled lately, I do not have faith it will
---
Lol.  I literally came here to comment just look at a wall, but that's the EZ way out.  These perks are the only way to outskill them.
---
I agree but what I’m saying is that if you have fun by being an asshole to others you can’t expect not to have any consequences I.e. disconnects
---
tbf there isnt always a wall and if there's even a teeny tiny open spot in said wall you can still get blinded
---
That might just encourage shitty gameplay from the killer trying to encourage rage quits lol 
---
PS button (or w/e xbox equiv) and close app
---

---
I get what you mean and sorta remember the GoW 2 years but nowadays it just isn't the same, even if it was they could just restart or power cycle their console
---
2 of these were massively nerfed in the past 2 years, maybe they're trying to tell us something.
---
Not with the new DS change.
---
What the actual fuck does Trump have to do with anything?! How many people do you convince by calling them bitches or girls? None. You shouldn’t treat a debate as an argument or nobody wins. Don’t treat ignorance with hate. How is OP supposed to learn that what he is saying is most likely wrong?
---
most of the time I have to derank myself 3-4 times during a month in order to avoid being red ranks and having crazy queue timers
---
pipping is extremely easy.  most people who think it's hard probably just play extremely immersed and end up not doing the things they need to pip (gens, unhooks, etc)
---
As a survivor main I feel like the luck might be broken because I get off the hook lately probably 7 times outta 10 with no luck add ons 
---
Try spies from the shadows it works really well now especially when you combo with M&amp;A you can get the jump on people easy 
---
Dude, everyone is dc'ing nowadays. They get downed for the first time? DC. They fail Dead Hard? DC. They lost the mindgame with the pallet? DC. It's not your killer, it's the people who can stand losing.
---
can't\*
---
I'm japanese (well I live in Japan) and I will miss you too!
---
Yeah this seriously needs to be fixed. 
---
you're still completely ignoring that pipping got a massive overhaul when the Plague was released
---
so you're still just talking out of your ass.  Pipping is near impossible as survivor now due to that change since it's 100% team-dependent.
---
Fear-mongering based on their own projection?  People like him will never want to be convinced to begin with. If that had been the case, they wouldn't make argument about something based on their own paranoia. 
---
They really don't deserve all the hate.  Yes, we should report the issues we find so they can fix them.  Yes, they do take a long time sometimes to fix the issues.  But sending them insulting things on forums and social media has to be demoralizing.  They go to work each day and put their heart and soul into making the game better FOR US.  They don't show up to collect a paycheck and say "hmm what can I fuck up today?"  
---
I would have to disagree. As a survivor BBQ does not feel healthy at all. And without it, would you just "soft patrol" since you don't know where anyone is? I don't disagree with patrolling if you're running it and no one shows up, but I still think it feels unhealthy. I only play survivor though so I'm probably biased.
---
I saw this earlier and had similar thoughts.
---
The obvious thing to do would be to include different types of ghost with different abilities.  Have a "poltergeist" type, like the one in the trailer, that can possess and move objects.  Then have other ghosts, say, one that could possess another player for a brief time, or a pyrokenetic ghost, or a creepy Borden axe-murderer ghost.
---
I'm not sure that fits the style of game they're going for, though.
---
Where there's 1 survivor 15m from the hook, there's 200 survivors 2.3mm from the hook.
---
Is this lunch? 
---
Lol. Get off my post. Yet another person who thinks there words mean anything. You're obviously here to argue. And I don't partake in petty nonsense. I made an informative post letting players know. So they don't fall victim to these POS people. And there's always gotta be the 1 individual that feels they need to open there mouth about the matter. Dude just get lost and find someone else's post to throw your 2 cents into. 
---
It’s sad when it’s more common to have people d/c than not. You know the deva simply don’t care about it when their own “fog whisperers” disconnect from multiple games on stream and nothing happens. I watched Edgar do it 2 or 3 times within an hour simply because it was legion. I agree that it is not the most important issue with the game but it has been one for as long as I can remember. 
---
Wonder what this is all about?
---
I'm not saying I know how the lore should go, I'm saying the devs keep going back and contradicting their own lore.
---
Lmao so true
---
Really? I had no idea. I actually like Naughty Bear 1 and 2, even if they got a bad rap. 
---
Survivors can deny him that info by faking the direction they're going, hiding behind gens, or staying in lockers.
---
But yea, sucks that happens but usually it's the opposite for most. We just have a tendency to remember when we get fucked over instead of when someone used the perk as intended.
---
He's not being hostile at all or even here to argue from what I'm reading? Posting a screenshot with just people's usernames and asking other people to do something about it is literally witch hunting. Honestly you should be thanking him for trying to help you out because I'm pretty sure this could get *you* in trouble. He's just asking if there's more then a screenshot, video perhaps? Because while it is helpful to the other players to be aware that this is happening, it would also suck if you got in trouble in the process of awareness lol.
---
Other then that, you need to contact the PlayStation customer help since you had the direct interaction with these people and would be able to explain everything that took place in detail. Unfortunately I think if someone else on here tried to call instead it might not be taken as seriously. "Someone on Reddit posted about these guys..." probably might sound a bit like a prank or might not be taken as seriously. However, "These people joined my group and gained my info and then tried to hack my friends account." will definitely be a different story.
---
Naw, give them the escape dawg
---
And just to add the times I stopped were because the connection was so bad that I was literally just frozen 
---
Yeah that's why it's broken on haddonfield
---
No. That's not good enough.
---
To prove that a perk is too strong you need to actually let the public use it and through qualitative data gathering you need to see how many escapees and how many failed attempts happened because of it.
---
Then you need to see other factors influencing escape or fail agents from it such ss SWF, the presence of other perks, etc.
---
You don't get to take one look at the perk description and declare "Nerf now" when you have nothing, no solid data of escape and death from it. Especially not when perks like NOED and Ruin have been documented to tilt heavily towards killers and yet the developers do nothing but buff them. 
---
Yo hold on tho - imagine being a hunter and then all of a sudden one of your teammates starts attacking you. POSSESSION.
---
Ahahaha what the fuck is wrong with you
---
So where's the proof?
---
Yes Dwight. Deliver the pallet
---
That's all well and good, but you don't know if the killer has BBQ till it's too late. I agree I might not be remembering right, and again I'm probably biased, but I've always felt BBQ was unbalanced. Granted, I haven't played much since the locker change, so maybe things are different now
---
what is this “looping” we speak of?
---
Your goal should be to have fun. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's a video game, not a job. Unless of course you're getting paid, but you're not.
---
NoeD was buffed though 
---
You are right, you are quite biased.
---
He's such a daddy 
---
I had an infinite tier 3 Myers do this shit. Chased people for 2 feet then right back to my hook. Fucker legit could've downed them like 4 times. But nah. I needed to suffer. 
---
I’m not even a survivor main, but anytime I play survivor and see a bubba, I get triggered
---
Yea it needs to be fixed. It should automatically activate once it hits 100%. This mechanic has cucked me out of countless downs.
---
That's another example, but to some killers Borrowed time is a wasted hit and potential chase just to get someone off the hook. It can seem unfair especially when the off the hook guy is the only feasible target.
---
Of course, it's actually there to encourage you to go for the rescuer, like Make Your Choice, but more effective since it covers the survivor end and gives the armor to disinterest most killers by its potential mere existence.
---
And as for Sprint Burst, I play both survivor and killer so I can understand. If a survivor has sprint burst, it lets me as a killer know they don't have much mobility outside of chases, and if they run off to some dead part of the map I can ignore them and move on. On the other hand, people with Sprint Burst are fucking annoying to chase since they keep so much distance they can get to the next loop before you hit them.
---
It's that moment when someone is trying to prove other people are a POS but instead makes themselves look like the POS. XD lmao
---
He said two of these... not all three lol.

Slow the game down ~~a lot~~ to a halt
---
I know you are joking but I feel like you are being legit. What?
---
It just straight up is toxic thought unless its just you on the hook and 1 guy left alive
---
Texture glitches. Wonderful
---
New map Burned Woods
---
With the quality of your content, I was shocked that this wasn't a YT link. Good editing!
---
I knew not to take fog-whispers seriously when someone like Jen-Denise got in and someone like Monto didn't. So no surprise that one of them is still blatantly rage-quitting. I'm sure several of them do it and think nothing of it since there is nothing to fear from doing it.
---
Rage-quitting is an absolute disgrace, and anyone that does it so fragrantly shouldn't be allowed to be a part of the community point blank period. Besides hacking, it's the worse offense that could be done in the game and completely ruins the game for everybody else. People want to instead complain about "tunneling" and "camping" but rage-quitting is a worse and much more common thing than the other two. 
---
That this hasn't been dealt with more harshly is eye-brow raising. Harshly penalizing rage quitters would improve the game more than any chapter-release, perk, licensed character, or killer re-work ever would.
---
Does anyone know if matchmaking is just broken or are there simply no red rank survivors for me to murder anymore because of the emblem stuff changes?
---
Sprint Burst was the first thing that came to my head, since my last game was against a Leatherface, and without any mobility perks, a game against him is hell. Some killers are nightmarish to face without a mobility perk, like Wraith or Leatherface, but I can see the perspective of the killer, they think they have someone dead to rights and they burst away.
---
I try not to run Sprint Burst, but sometimes I really miss it, so perhaps that's what BBQ is like for killers. I will say though that I have to laugh when I see people argue they only use BBQ "for the blood points." That is something I will never believe.
---
When you play 24/7 you'll know these things. Js
---
When you've got several backseat gamers that manifest in the postgame chat. 
---
I disagree. My survivor side is saying that too.
---
I feel it's better for everyone is the killer used bbq to come chasing me than to sit around the guy on the hook. Gives each survivor a chance if a chase but most importantly it lets the survivor on the hook have a chance to get away rsther than being unhooked and tunneled down.
---
It's only bullshit on billy and nurse due to how fast they can cross the map, you barely have time to get away to a place where you can hide. Especially in billy because he just sprintd over then starts swinging instadowns.
---
Nobody likes Bubba.
---
2 Clowns in one day? Wow. That's like seeing big foog and the loch ness monster.
---
Ruin everygame. Yeah its dull. Surprised there are so many bbqs and not as many noeds. From what I remember of green ranks there was commonly noed but not as many had bbq.
---
I love when I’m breaking pallets, gens, placing traps, etc. and the survivor is flailing their arms and I’m just like “Yeah yeah, I’ll go away in a second” and the MOMENT I walk away they get saved 90% of the time. Doesn’t bother me much though as a person who runs MYC. 
---
You dont HAVE to but it certainly makes a large enough difference. 
---
It’s the teachable version 
---
Oh that’s right. I really hope this gets made though
---
Yea it kinda is toxic if you did it in the middle of the game.
---
Probably not gonna be an unpopular opinion but...
---
They should punish the first person to disconnect. S lot of solos disconnect when someone else has disconnected because they feel robbed. It's not their fault. Why should they stay in a game that's now unbalanced just because someone else or 2 other people decided to rage quit within the first minute?
---
People say swf will abuse this but then BHVR needs to update their game to recognize who is swf and who isn't.
---
HEY KIDS  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIm1WXRyDxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIm1WXRyDxY)

Lol here come the nats. Well the issue has been resolved. No need for anyone else to comment. But I bet you will. 😤😧 so y'all have a good one. The post is being taken down because the players are banned. Thanks for all yalls help tho
---
You're blowing my mind rn. I swear I got Spirit to weeks ago for 7k........
---
Nah I'm probably just an idiot. 
---
Yep
---
He makes even the most seasoned players look like shit, all respect. He's soooo good at this game. 
---
Exactly. I play survivor and killer equally, there are tons of cues that will let the survivor know to go for the save and all you have to do is recognize them
---
Haven’t been playing since he came out, is he that bad?
---
the killer
---
The worst part is you can't even do stealth against Legion cause of his power. 
---
Then again I wouldn't really count tea bagging as one of the fun attractions of being a survivor.
---
Np
---
“Someone is insecure and has to camp gens” - the claudette triggering discordance on the only gen close to being done 
---
It depends on the player. Tbh bbq can only do so much. Some play campy regardless, but at least for thosr who want to be off hunting another survivor then the aura is there to help them.
---
Tbh I'm mostly running it for the Bp because I often find it shows me survivors who are miles away and by the time you get there they have often hidden or moved or they're just too far to walk to.
---
But if it shows one within a decent range i go after them regardless of if I think someone is nesr the hook or not. If the aura is miles away thrn I just check gens I think they might be on.
---
But I have no interest in camping anyway. Way I see it, it doesnt matter if someone is near the hook or not. I know someone is going to unhook thrm anyway. Might as well let them unhook and heal while I chase someone else off a gen.
---
I agree. Tunneling rolls off the tongue more though.
---
K. Thanks for clear that up *Half cringes*
---
as a killer main i'll explain the right thing to do because depending on the survivors it can be really easy to return in time to wutness the save and not tunnel a guy for no reason:
---
first hook someone, the piss off somewhere else till you feel a good 10-20 second walk from the hook, then return, if you're playing idiots you should be there in time to find the rescuer and chase them, if you're facing good players they may be either right by the hook or will leave the survivor hooked temporarily, the only valid reason to tunnel is if the survivor your tunneling is blatantly being a dickhead, survivors can be rude from time to time but you'll know the ones who need to be reminded you can still ruin their day as killer, im not promoting facecamping, you basically relinquish your right to be considered skilled but you dont need to give the guy an easy chance, patrol extra toxic survivors a bit harder as if you had them proxied in a 3 gen trifecta, note that this will make it harder on you late game as you lack hooks for a pip which has been made far harder for us now. i personally like running rancor as i've found the obsessions tend to be a bit extra saucy so its funny to BM them at the gates, especially low ranks where no one knows what the fuck rancor does and will confuse it for a mori (true story, happened to me before). on normal survivors simply do other productive shit till you get that sixth sense feeling then return, dont just sit around the guy if he can hear your TR its kinda campy, while one guy is on hook you can see if you can find someone else in the meantime, if you cant return to hook and sometimes you can find an immersed boi slav squating by a tree
---
That’s so ridiculous like...if they wanted to get you away then don’t run loops near the hooked survivor? So glad ps4 doesn’t have end chat for this reason.
---
That's not correct at all. Survivors have 1 goal, survive. Killers have 1 goal, kill. To say that it's fair for eaither side in either of these scenarios is incorrect. Tunneling, camping, and gen rushing all need to not be things in the game period. It's up to the devs to fix these issues, which they have constantly failed at.
---
Why did you wanna know  
---
After the latest update, Ruin is now affecting everyone instead of based on the tier. Plus there's an additional effect, regression iirc, if you hit good skill check instead of hex skill check. 
---
I usually love Bubbas... the stereotype is rarely true in my experience.
---
What do you mean regression iirc? But lower tiers being buffed doesn’t buff a perk. Noed didn’t change when green rarities got the exposed. 
---
I get a lot of pips with Freddy due to generally being harder to play &amp; his power being able to extend the game which is needed to pip. You cannot really instantly win with Freddy unless you slug due to his 7-second transition so you lose out the opportunity of killing everyone before all 5 gens finish.
---
Usually I run; 
---
M &amp; A to be able to get very close to survivors &amp; ambush them. Works amazingly well.
---
Discordance to find survivors in groups &amp; to kick start a match
---
Ruin to slow the game down as I gain momentum
---
BBQ &amp; chilli for identifying my next target &amp; getting more bp.
---
Swap out Discordance or M &amp; A for making your choice &amp; you have a good build for pipping. You never want to tunnel with it &amp; helps you spread the hooks more which increases your chance of pipping.
---
As a survivor I go all out alturism;
---
We will make it
---
We are going to live forever
---
Dead Hard 
---
Adrenaline
---
- Do as many gens then save when a survivor is downed. Unhook them &amp; try to take the aggro of the killer to get chaser points. Combination of doing these 3 things should allow you to pip.
---
I do this too.  We (usually) worked hard for that hatch. One of us better get it.
---
Forgot to put this down as a shitpost.
---
I could help him but i think the shipping would be a killer. Never shipped out the country so i wouldn't know 
---
Yeah, just make the mori and kill happen immediately upon starting the mori animation and the rest is just animation... so that way, the mori counts as soon as you grab them, and if they dc anytime after the beginning, it still counts 
---
It's valid but it's a shit strategy. It'll only get you so far. Eventually you'll hit a wall and you'll be stuck at the baby ranks.
---
It is buffing. Normally at least 2 people can still do gens normally if someone only has ruin 1. But now everyone is affected by the slowdown. 
---
it's really easy to hit rank 1 currently, sorry if u struggle to
---
The Silver Scream by Ice Nine Kills. Metal songs about (mostly)horror movies.
---
That's kind of the point. Grind for your add-ons, lose those add-ons each game, spend the BP you got to buy them against. Repeat.
---
Capitalism.
---
Perks are placed by their third tier. Bbq 1 is literally only for points while its 3rd tier actually affects gameplay and is the only one people talk about. Ruin isn’t more powerful, just easier to use.
---
You clearly dont play killer at high rank, high rank survivors will realize you are camping and just chalk that guy as a loss do gens and get out and the killer will get at most 2 kills. And if a survivor has borrowed you're screwed. 
---
If the survivors are potatoes and they:
---
1. Don't block the person that they unhooked, I'm going to hit the unhooked survivor and down them every time.
---
2. Don't run Borrowed Time, and they unhook right next to me, I'm going to continue going after the unhooked survivor every time.
---
3. Don't run Decisive and run around next to me like I'm not supposed to hit them, I'm going to down them every time.
---
4. Don't know how to intelligently hide from me compared to everyone else in the match, I'm going to down them every time.
---
5. Don't run evasion perks in general, like Sprint Burst, Lithe, or even simple things like Dance With Me, I'm going to down them every time because they are and easier target than everyone else.
---
This bizarre survivor mentality that I'm supposed to pretend the person who I have the highest chance killing is completely silent, invisible, and invulnerable, is absurd and needs to stop. It's not the killer's fault you get tunneled anymore, there's plenty of anti-tunnel perks and plenty of survivor plays that can prevent it. If you're playing survivor and you're having a bad game due to tunnelling, it's because your team is bad, you're bad, your team has taken poor perks, or you have taken poor perks. Period.
---
I’m honestly encountering the same problem. I know I’m not skilled at the game, so please don’t pair me against someone who is
---
There are definitely more than a few Bubbas who are friendly and goofy people, but there are also plenty who will facecamp you and then spam nasty messages afterwards.
---
When I first started playing, I called it “bait time,” because essentially you are bait on a hook for others to come to you. And I thought that was part of the game, and you have to figure out how to get past the killer—like, thats where strategy comes in.
---
But then I heard it was frowned upon and I was confused as a survivor, because aren’t killers ... supposed to kill? 
---
It threw me for a loop. 
---
Do you read this subreddit lol... one out of every like 10 posts is someone complaining about how long it takes to get into a game.
---
Isi t a good song ?
---
I don't play Survivor that much, but when I do, I love seeing Bubba!  
---
...
---
...as long as I'm not on a hook.
---
No one doing gens 
---
I heard they removed the 4K to get the achievement. you HAVE to double pip now, apparently. 
---
this video was entertaining.. i’m definitely subscribing to your youtube 
---
His greatest enemy... the corn
---
Killer isn't cake either. *Normal* Killer that is. I don't count baby tactics to be normal. Normal as in you're aiming to pip and not just playing for kills which is not enough anymore.
---
Play without Ruin, and your gens will be done before the 9 minute mark because everyone brings in toolboxes.
---
Play games with Ruin and have it spawn in a shitty spot right next to a gen. 
---
Play games without Franklin's or Lightborn, Brutal, Bamboozle, or Enduring, and 2 people bring/find flashlights and blind you at one of the four pallets in the main safe area that has two vault spots. 
---
Play without Hangman's Trick and that one person in every other game breaks your hooks.
---
Play without Mad Grit and everyone body blocks.
---
Play without NOED and get t-bagged at the gates.
---
Fun times.
---
It’s hilarious when people tell the developers characters they developed in their game aren’t actually a part of the game because they utilize new or different mechanics.

Kate 100%. I hate Jane, btw downvote me for an opinion about Jane. 
---
i mean, This is literally the first time ever I've said that online but that's okay. you can think i'm an attention seeker, doesn't effect me in any way. you'll never know the truth
---
An original meme. Take this earned upvote
---
Examples please?
---
Ok but what if every game you camp survivors just do gens? Are you having fun with your "bait"? 
---
If they bum rush the hook I'll probably stick around to rough them up. But never if I don't think they're waiting for me to leave to go get their friend. Camping is a shit tactic. It's something that assholes do
---
This screams of a salty survivor main. 
---
thank you my friend, even though we don't know each other it means a lot
---
No. But we can have emergency plan Alpha. 
---
It's more effective to kill if you actually chase people. 
---
If you stay in one place the whole time you're allowing the other survivors to just finish gens.
---
Against a smart survivor team a camping killer will only get one kill. 
---
You know I felt cringe, but to be honest I couldn't stop laughing, nor perform it better even in my dreams. Take your upvote.
---
Sorry you haven't been playing survivor since plague was released and are still talking out of your ass
---
I'm on board with Plan A. I know this is old, but he/she is still incredibly toxic and ridiculous.
---
Frame rates destroyed yes. But a burning forest map would be cool to look at 😌
---
No. Just someone with a brain who figured out that many killer mains are actually whiny lying liars who make false accusation about hook rushing to justify their camping and tunnelling.
---
But the reality is most survivors tend to be careful before unhooking their team mates. But there's not much they can do when the killer is proxy  camping.
---
&gt;It's not the killer's fault you get tunneled anymore, 
---
What are you smoking?
---
&gt;there's plenty of anti-tunnel perks and plenty of survivor plays that can prevent it.
---
They can prolong the chase, but they can't prevent you from being tunneled
---
&gt;If you're playing survivor and you're having a bad game due to tunneling, it's because your team is bad, you're bad, your team has taken poor perks, or you have taken poor perks. Period.
---
Yeah, because getting knocked out of the game with no counterplay is completely the survivors' fault. /s
---
Or you're just salty as shit, not to mention extremely presumptuous. 
---
I upvoted 
---
Jane is overrated 
---
P.s.
---
Feng min is best girl 
---
It reminded me of Mob Psycho 100, maybe that? Someone else has mentioned it too 
---
That build is slight cancer ngl
---
Once I got harassed for tunneling because he meg who was unhooked tried to hide behind the hook and the Kate ran away in the opposite direction..
---
Just play a different game for a little bit then come back to it. I’ve had the same problem. It’ll work eventually. 
---
My list:
---
1-Meg
---
2-Feng
---
3-Other females 
---
Thank! You made my day
---
Seeing up that many traps already mean spending a lot of time near the hook.  But to actually still hang around when tog already have that many traps is stupid when tog can patrol gens.
---
I didn't say most survivors are goody two shoes but many killer mains sure have dirty play style, have serious anger issues from gameplay mechanic like pallet dropping, etc.
---
Getting this on ps4 as well.
---
What am i seeing here?
---
Omg it's not my run button? I thought it was the controller for sure 
---
Ruin affects gameplay. Especially for solo survivors who have no choice in their fellow team mate skills. 
---
Did you try missionary? 
---
Dude should be named Spider Dad.
---
Yeah, no. Sorry, but no.
---
There will be times where I down someone after scattering three of them, put that person on the hook, take two steps and *turn around* and someone is already rushing the hook. That's not camping. That is hook rushing.
---
There are times where I'll chase someone away from the hook, glance back and see a second survivor go for it. That's not camping; I was following the Survivor and he didn't eat up enough of my time/get me to follow him (I'm in no obligation to follow you away from every generator left on the map).
---
I have hooked someone, went to look for people with BBQ, and noticed two people crouching behind boxes waiting for me to leave. That's not camping, the goal of the Hook is to waste someone's time pulling people off and get another closer to death. If I'm wasting two people's time because *They suck so bad at stealth they just assume every killer will chase after one of them like a stupid dog after a bone*, that's not on me.
---
You say "The reality is that most survivors tend to be careful", and that immediately tells me you either play exclusively SWF, or you assume that "play carefully" means people just stand out in the open waving at you to follow them.
---
That’s respectable
---
Here’s mine:
---
1-Feng min
---
2-meg and Kate 
---
3-others 
---
Oh, honorable mention: Ashley Williams will be my number 2 right by Feng 
---
This post is fantastic and should be worthy of any kind of dev response.
---
Knowing the Devs though, won't happen. 
---
Been playing this game for a ridiculously long time, and been rank 1 every season. I have never, *ever*, seen a game end this quickly. 
---
Groovy
---
Well yeah Ruin does but a perks efficiency isn’t based on the lower tiers, it’s only the top. Like Enduring is a shit perk at tier 1 but at tier 3 I can basically become a pallet muncher. High tier gameplay should involve only tier 3 perks. 
---
Head On Perk doesn't wreck the killer when they're right in front of the locker. 
---
It's a little bit out of date, but this is a pretty good place to start.
---

He's saying in a very elitist way "Perks worthless, just look away from the flashlight".
---
This should be a legit map
---
I'd rather get crappy pings than wait 30 mins for a lobby where someone will just DC anyway 
---
Why does it matter? It's just a thing that shows how much you played. Why get rewarded? There is nothing to reward. 
---
I’m guessing his right arm is smaller than the other haha
---
I love the new pip system. Ranking up is somewhat meaningful now 
---
how ironic haha
---
Ive had it happen on all 3 of my controllers, including one from last Christmas. 
---
dude just give credit where credit is due. Even if he had 10,000 hours in the game, thats a great fucking shot
---
But kindred shows the whole team everyone else plus killer lol.
---
Really? Just a sound can do that to you? I just cant fathom it. It’s like how some people have an intense fear of rats. Well I mean I guess you can mute your computer/tv when you play against Plague. Not much of a work around unless you get therapy. (That’s not the right terminology but basically go visit a professional to face your fears.)
---
You stuck in 2011 buddy?
---
The situation you're describing only happens with SWF. And usually the ones who just goof around instead of playing seriously. 
---
What makes you think survivors are nearby because you can't see them with BBQ? Most survivors these days user lockers before a guy gets hooked to prevent aura reading.
---
I actually never play SWF. If I do,  would my fellow survivors know when or when not to unhook me?  Thus, the crux of this while argument. It looks like you just want to advise someone of Swf! And not when thinking much when arguing. 
---
Ah I get it now and you're right you can either just face a wall or look up lol
---
Honestly he was living the dream
---
ya i play everyday.  sorry that u just aren't able to pip, it's easy LMAO
---
do you like just hide at the edge of the map w/ urban immersion all game?  like i don't get it, all u have to do is do gens and get unhooks LOL
---
are u new to the game??
---
yeah they're really good. The Micheal one is my favorite.
---
Oh... I guess I misinterpreted your phrasing.
---
They can't even figure out match making and you want them to add this? 
---
Everyone cries and complains about mis-matched ranks of survivors and killers so they have reverted the changes 3 times now and every time you people cry. The new system is "broke" because of bad pings with an open system and faster queue times. Revert.... Back to 1 hour queue times next to the camp fire. But wait the killer dodged the lobby because the huuuuuur duuuuuuur special needs killer seen a 4 man swf team. So they reverted the revert with region locking. Awesome idea! Oh no but now the once boosted survivors who derank on purpose to bully the killer actually had to face someone at their level. Cry cry cry cry. Now we're back to staring at a fake fire for a fucking hour for lobby dodgers and face campers. 
---
Tldr: even if they thought your idea was good an added into the game they wouldn't ever figure out how to get it to function and everyone would cry about it.
---
Hook rushing is definitely a term that killer mains invented. The likelihood it happened is once in a blue moon and usually in SWF, who are actually not good. 
---
You do realize I play killer as well right? I've seen these guys goofing around and I've seen some seriously coordinated SWF. If it's the later, you wouldn't even see them trying to unhook their friends. That is, unless you camp, of course. 
---
Wraith best killer, change my mind.
---
NOED now confirmed to be arriving to the survivor side of perks. 
---
Why you ask? 
---
So Survivors will quit complaining about killers running it, and go after the troll on their team instead!
---
played me like a damn fiddle
---
I like Jane because she doesn't look basic.
---
So you're mad they're mad because you make them mad and they retaliate by killing you? Tell me more, Mr. Pot.
---
I hate tiktok... but this makes an exception 
---
The reason monto didnt get in is because he publicized a glitch/exploit with noob3, at least thats what ive been told 
---
I think the previous version is a lot more fair to the survivors. 
---
This is super helpful, thanks so much!! She’s still one of the few killers that freaks me out as survivor and I want to be able to do the same! And her stun noise? Ohmigosh. 
---
I’ll def have to try Enduring, I do notice I just get pallet stomped a lot with her. Do you ever feel like you get gen rushed a lot as Pig? I’ve been watching videos and many of them say Ruin is a necessity for her but I hate running it. 
---
I was also wondering if Whispers was any good on her. Given her 32m TR, I sort of imagined crouching as soon as Whispers kicks in for some good sneaks but wasn’t sure. 
---
Oh and if you don’t mind me asking a million questions - any fave add-ons? (:
---
**BING** fucking **BONG**
---
You can't loop when freddy has 300 ping and hits you 10 feet away
---
i played against a myers called "i just wanna watch". as im sure you can figure, he stalked the entire game. never hit anyone. 
---
it was incredible. 
---
i have a couple tips for u on how to pip:  
---
1) do 1-2 gens  
---
2) unhook ur teammates  
---
3) ez rank 1 in 2 days
---
gl and welcome to dbd, its a fun game for new players
---
Me when I'm angry as fuck in public and trying to be calm
---
Yeah, it's the show. Ashy slashy is what he's called in his hometown, after his gf &amp; friends were all murdered in the cabin.
---
I feel like we would need a speed comparison. Having 2 people work on 2 different gens and the having 3 people working on different gens with the new Ruin at each tier to really see how much of a buff this really was. The more I think about it though you are probably right, the old Ruin was probably better balanced.
---
claudette has a really underrated butt but nothing beats red pants meg
---
&gt; Hook rushing is definitely a term that killer mains invented.
---
Tunneling is just a term Survivor Mains invented; if a killer has the option of going after a full health Survivor or an injured survivor that is already down a hook, and the biggest momentum swing in the game is that first death, it would be stupid of the Killer not to ensure that one person dies.
---
&gt; That is, unless you camp, of course.
---
Tell me, explain to me, let me know exactly what you're thinking, what exactly is a "seriously coordinated SWF" group that doesn't waste as little time as possible to pull people off the hook and getting them back on the gen? Because every streamer I've seen has one person running distraction and the other pulling them off the hook as fast as possible.
---
Please do all of the killers omg
---
If you're mad due to things that developer provided for survivors you seriously need to check yourself to mental hospital for anger management.
---
Being mad that many people cheat and play the game dirty is pretty normal response. Unless you like cheaters or a cheater yourself, dumbass. 
---
Yes will do
---
*people who complain about hook campers instead of doing gens
---
Remind me how they're cheating again?
---
Agreed. Just a fat drunk that used to manage a GameStop.  A real asshole.
---
Is the game still region locked?
---
if the entity is the killer, who appears when a survivor gets hooked?
---
It's playing dirty when you basically just hanging around waiting so you can chase them again. Don't pretend like you're not going for an easy way out here.
---
That is your problem. You watch steamers who guess what? Want to entertain their audience this the stupid, bombastic things they do. But actual players rarely do things like that. 
---
That would be cool tbh i wouldn't mind seeing that
---
Killers should be able to keep their moris if they didn't mori anyone
---
I love Faceing SWF because that, is much fun with good survivors 
---
a 4k gives you ruthless you need merciless which is a double pip, basically all iridescent emblems. which on killers with no game slowing perks its nigh impossible especially when youre in high ranks
---
Use Premonition or Spine Chill, it screws Wraith over. 
---
Exactly... Rewards are needed for people to take anything seriously.
---
Because her voice 
---
He’s Alex, the owner of the Rare toolbox, a character in lore who hasn’t been shown yet 
---
How is it intended when the game clearly punishes you for camping and now refuses you from pipping if you tunnel?
---
Clearly you never play as survivor. There's no getting good when you're being tunneled after being unhooked. 
---
That is also why you are awful as killer and need camping and tunneling as you have no POV of survivors. Most of the expert killers who don't need to tunnel or camp are actually survivor mains. 
---
Promo content is to get people to buy the character, or better, buy the character AND the game if they don't know about its existence. Especially for Evil Dead fans.
---
Hahaha
---
I’d assume they’d change her voice a bit with the cosmetic 
---
&gt; It's playing dirty when you basically just hanging around waiting so you can chase them again.
---
TIL walking to the generator, breaking it, coming back to check on them, and then going about my way trying to find another survivor is "playing dirty".

You get good by looping/kiting/360ing when you get unhooked, come on now silly goose. You really gotta focus on you so you can get rid of that rage problem you have.
---
He looks like he needs to pee
---
Exactly. Like i know i suck but you know whats not fun? Getting instantly fucking wrecked because theyre a rank 2 killer after waiting 5+ minutes to get into a match (with 3 people isntead of 4 because of course why wouldn't that happen every other match)
---
I dunno, its just straight frustrating. 
---
It was Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise. It improved *drastically* on the issues Naughty Bear 1 had. Too bad it still didn't get very good reviews.

I guess I'm color blind because I see teachables as orange :P

Correct me if i’m wrong, I remember the devs saying they were going to keep on working dbd for five more years before moving on. It’s possible for the current devs hiring new devs to continue their work?

Not buying Legion and still sh*tting upon them? You are a disgrace to this subreddit. I tip my hat to a fellow outcast

I mean I’d call that pin orange too 
---
Noice! 
---
Not true, getting tunneled as a survivor is fucking annoying but getting gen rushed is very stressful and unpleasant 
---
i mean it did get to you
---
/s
---
Seeing the Plague cosmetics and Ash cosmetics they have to be close to getting this done since you can clearly tell they got around there issue with those cosmetics
---
Why wait when you can just do a gen and force them away from the hatch though?
---
LMAO you almost got me.
---
no problem 
---
“I have got to get a better agent... I wonder what Sam is up to? 
---
Idk, they might have occasional discounts, haven't visited the store recently.
---
I'm on mobile so apologies for lack of formatting, but I'll try to cover your points.
---
I've never felt super bad about being tunneled beside being a bit frustrated, maybe it happened more to you than me.
---
I don't really tunnel, but when killers do, it's normally because having 3 survivors severly stops this gen swarming behaviour and severely cripples the survivor team when they still need 3+ generators.
---
I also don't think she's the only one that can apply pressure, just that she's able to stop the gen swarming behaviour significantly better than other killers because of how well she can A) Slug a survivor and prevent them from getting up while guarding a generator and B) can get from a close hook to a generator and hit the survivor off the fastest. When you have to walk back, and know they're repairing it the second you downed someone else, then you feel sorta helpless because you can only get their to stop them as quickly as the killer can walk back.
---
As for the whole swarming issue, I find this almost every game, and is the cause of a lot of 4ks. Maybe it just depends on where you're matching with players, and the game culture of your region, but in mine, this is something that happens frequently with high ranks.
---
How is that the only solution when the survivors could just play smarter? The killer isn't playing the way you want, and you're mad about it. You gotta get things together and focus on what you're doing to get better. Right answer isn't always going for the save, and sometimes you gotta take DS because of the tunnel. Focus on you instead of being so angry.
---
I get an hour ban for disconnecting two times in 3 days? Jesus man. 
---
&gt;Number one: if a survivor gets pulled from a hook right in front of a killer and the killer knocks them down immediately it is logical for their purpose of winning and entirely the survivors teammates fault for pulling them off STOP BLAMING KILLERS FOR SHITTY UNHOOKS.
---
I don't consider unhooking right in front of the killer to be tunneling, and I don't think most survivors do.  It's just shitty teammates, like you said.
---
That being said, not all cases of tunneling are because of shitty unhooks. Most tunneling killers are just playing for the advantage at the expense of the survivor's game.
---
&gt;You complain that there is no counterplay to tunneling when there absolutely is, not rushing unhooks for starters, gen rush to put pressure on the killer, actually playing stealthy and antitunnel perks, which i will admit are actually pretty weak right now
---
Two problems;
---
1. There's no counterplay for the tunnelee to stop being tunneled.
---
2. "antitunnel perks" don't exist, unless you want to give me a list on which ones are?
---
3. Stealth play doesn't remotely counter tunneling. All it takes is for one player to be found to draw the rest out.
---
&gt;Tunneling sucks but it isn't an unbeatable and if you are good at running the killer around and hes tunneling your team should have good odds of escaping even if you die
---
Like I said, it's unbeatable if you're the one being tunneled.  Your team might make it out alive, but you're stuck with 8k chase BP, a depip and maybe some salt.
---
As someone who plays both, looping isn't toxic. What's toxic as all hell is body blocking. 
---
teachables are orange
---
If you ever find yourself shopping for a new monitor. May I suggest something like a asus vg248qe or something similar that has crosshairs in the menu you can add to any game. :)  
---
Funny thing is this actually happened 
---
Of course you did, anything but running in a straight line gets you camped
---
So this whole regions stuff does this kean that being from the UK means i can no longer play with my american friends on this game? If so what the actual fuck?!
---
Why is it okay for killers to play dirty but the minute survivors get a strong perk, it's nerfed to oblivion? 
---
This is 4 vs 1 game. And yet the game is tilted towards the 1 person and no attempt is made to stop dirty plays from that end. 
---
Without survivors, there is no game and the purchase of cosmetics also rely heavily on the survivors as there are more of them.
---
In the end, it's in BHVR interest to make sure the game is fair and not exposed to dirty plays that make one sided experience. 
---
*would also like this to happen. Like your art is amazing* 
---
I think they're starting to get push back from the community and the community managers are having to say stuff to some of them. I won't name names but one streamer I was watching tends to dc to derank since he doesn't like to play higher than purple ranks (to his credit, he dcs RIGHT at the end of the match so it doesn't effect anyone but himself). He recently stopped doing it and made a comment that someone told him to stop since he was getting a lot of reports and they couldn't keep ignoring them.
---
I think ace wants a kiss
---
(Happy cake day)
---
Matchmaking is horrible, yes.. But by now most people have owned the game for a while. Just keep at it. Get David King and get We're gonna live forever (teachable perk) and you'll be stacking BP, in no time. 
---
true could true tricking the game files 
---
Solid humble brag, though. Lol..

The opening to DBD the anime.
---
In a recent update matchmaking was broken in a way to where it's super easy to rank up to the midranks and incredibly difficult beyond reason to rank up into the higher ranks.  
---
As such you're seeing the results with Rank 1 killers and survivors being paired with new people.

Your only option is to pretty much wait until they revert the changes or update the ranking system again.

---
God if I could kill Claudettes as a survivor that would be great 
---
&gt;But there is a version of tunneling, and the kind that everyone refers to in these kinds of discussions, where you single out a survivor and go after them sometimes in direct detriment to yourself. u/Nadger_Badger highlighted examples of this very well. 
---
I agree with his argument.  Most of these close unhook arguments from killers are attempts to justify themselves when they're wrongly called tunnelers. 
---
I like to frame my argument a little bit differently;
---
A survivor doing generators is doing their objective, and a killer getting hooks is doing theirs. The only alternative a survivor has to doing gens is not doing gens.  A killer has three alternatives; not kill the survivors, play normally, or tunnel.  It's ridiculous to compare the 'gen-rush' to tunneling because the survivors have no other alternative, unless they want to stop doing generators.   A killer has a choice; play 'normal' or tunnel and piss off the survivors.
---
Where was it mentioned that Vigo and Alex are the same person?
---
I can’t remember if it was explicitly said or people just put two and two together
---
His dick must be so tiny 🧐
---
This post is about people who do it even without any reason. Wasn't that apparent? 🙄
---
Perk is nowhere close to useless.  I put it on everytime there are 2 or more flashlights in a lobby.  You might as well be immune to flashlight saves when running it because they will NEVER get that timing right.  It's really nice against multi flashlight swf groups.  Also you'll get free hits from it the first time they try to stun you at the pallet because they don't realize you have it yet.  Them waiting at pallet is a guaranteed injured state.
---
Rofl you keep letting him heal you bro, like at some point you gotta understand you're being trolled and you don't give em the satisfaction of showing you have some bizarre shred of hope that the david will actually heal you after trolling you for 11 mins straight, cmonbruh. Also yeah they're assholes, report them please.
---
This one wins
---
To be fair, Killers addons/offerings and Survivors items/addons/and offerings are not even close to killers, Best thing survivors have are Flashlights (that wont work against a smart killer) and insta med kits, While killers Have Moris, Iridescent Heads, Mix tapes, ect. But i do agree that if you BM a killer, you shouldn't complain if you get camped 
---
PLEASE AND THANK YOU
---
Yeah, I'm still not clear on whether we're going back to the new one just before Plague or the one before that. We were having matchmaking problems before Plague came out.
---
That looks awesome
---
i bet you run self-care, DS, adrenaline and sprint burst on every survivor, because you are just making excuses for being bad.
---
it is quite easy going through the entirety of a game and not even being found once. it is called game sense/knowledge.
---
being mad because you got caught and did not effectively lose the killer, several times, is your fault. your team not doing objectives or using their brain is their fault. 
---
blaming others is why you are not good at this game. change your gameplay and way of thinking, or continue getting shit on. or you can always stop playing, whichever.
---
But they made changes to matchmaking before Plague came out, and that change was when the problems started. They then worsened after Plague. So if we're going back to where we were immediately before Plague we're still going to have problems. We should be going back to System -1.
---
I love to collect pins but I no longer have enough budget to afford pins and seeing this. Well shit another set added to my wishlist. Thanks for reveal tho.
---
This is me. I always just commit to lobbies while I watch Youtube on the second screen.
---
Did you reply to the right person?
---
The ranking system really discourages the stalky boi Scratched Mirror Myers and the tombstone build. You actually need to chase them for a decent amount, then hook. Jumpscaring them doing a gen then hooking would skip the Chase Bloodpoints
---
Have also had this issue on xbox
---
Jane had voicelines so probably.
---
Have had this happen on xbox as well
---
Thats so me dude.
---
If that’s true literally everyone will play Ash 😂 
---
I’d be down for it though. I wish every character had their own little unique passive perks like that.
---
Shitting on them gets us our way, do you not remember what happened to Freddy?
---
I wasn't trying to directly reply to anyone in particular, just follow up what you said with my thoughts on tunneling.
---
It is honestly starting to become extremely boring as killer or survivor whenever someone DCs, I've seen people DC over childish things like Clown or flashlight saving, it's honestly reached the point to where I can just flip a coin to predict if a survivor or killer DC.  
---
  
---
I just want to properly learn how to play against killers I rarely go against, but then the killer either feels bad and farms or just kills the rest of us as fast as possible, and I can't really blame them for either option.
---
They do. Claudette’s passives is you vanish in thin air when the killer is near and Jeff reveals your aura to the killer. 
---
Aren't killers not supposed to have collision after a successful attack..? Or did he just waste that window by trying to be sneaky? 
---
Personally I think artists can be assholes so you're good 
---
Watched it again, and he's clearly running toward you while you're wiping the blade.. 😂 
---
Lovely.
---
&gt;Borrowed Time
---
Prolongs the chase by another 60 seconds if you get hit.  Doesn't prevent tunneling. More of an anti-camp perk, like you said.
---
&gt; jeffs perk that breaks hooks after being unhooked
---
How exactly does this stop tunneling? It makes camping more painful for killers, but chances are the survivor will get downed near another new hook.
---
&gt;adrenaline
---
How does this counter tunneling? It gives a free health state at the end of the match- which you probably won't get to if you're being tunneled.
---
The reworked Decisive Strike is arguably the only true anti-tunnel perk.
---
&gt;You beat tunneling by not losing chases thats it and thats the counterplay
---
This is much harder than you make it sound- if you're being tunneled, you're dead against any half decent killer.
---
When the survivors had seen too many of their friends get face camped and decide to get revenge!
---
On occasion it might, but most times it won't. Every time they post something (like fanart or something) people shit on them and it's like damn give them a break. Yes they did a lot of weird things that even tilts me off but that does not mean we should shit on them at any chance possible. I'm not saying we shouldn't complain but I'm saying we should cut down on complaining 
---
i mean, if you have a  regular job you make some money, but if you sell your ass  you will get way more money way quicker, want to do it tho? 
---
I always think of tunneling the killer avoiding people right next to them to go after the harder target. I was in a match where me and my friend (who’s pretty new) were both injured, and despite me being closer and trying to annoy him by teabagging, he completely ignored me and went for my friend, who was farther away.
---
ahh yeah, gotcha.
---
Now it's time to finally let Freddy speak. 
---
Let her get her points, let her team escape, and she just throws it out the window. What an asshat.. Wish I got more killers like you man. I'd let you mori me, any time. 😘
---
Is there a picture of the photo?
---
Yes please. I want to mock survivors as I chase them down. 
---
Apologies for that (clears throat). 
---
Well... how do I say it? I love red add-ons overall, but this one is actually the right level of broken. Don't get me wrong, I am quite fond of the fuckery that is the iridescent king and the OITC of the Iridescent Head.
---
But it's special. It gives Trapper something most other killers can only envy--permanent presence. Beyond that, it's huge for saving time. That's big for him because it significantly reduces the time required to set up in the early game. And once those traps are set, they aren't going anywhere and given time will remain effective. They make it possible to get away with obvious placements and keep loops from being reopened. They can open and catch a survivor off guard mid-chase. 
---
Is it bullshit? Probably. But those are red add-ons in a nutshell, for both Killers and Survivors. Brand New Parts (pre-nerf), Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringes, Iridescent Heads, Fragrant Tuft of Hair, etc. They're really powerful but also really rare. Oftentimes, getting to run one effectively is a privilege for killers especially because they are not guaranteed to not go to waste. 
---
This is adorable
---
Aside from the possibility of lag, Freddy's actual weapon hitbox is longer than his claws, so as to match the length of the basic killer lunge range. 
---
I'd let you mori me too!
---
really sorry, man D: that sucks. bit over a year ago when i joined i've been only on rank 16-15 survivor after 100 hours cause pipping system worked okay  then Clown chapter made it real easy to rank and it kinda destroyed the whole point of pipping. but it wasn't as bad as it is now anyway.
---
whatever they say rank doesn't matter there is a huge difference between a person with 20 hours and over 2k hours like myself. the new pipping system cucked my survivor to rank 9 from 2 because i was matched with green and yellow rank people with like under 100 hours on the game while still facing experienced red rank killers or really campy/tunnely shits who can't get to high ranks cause they're bad so they just embraced shit play instead of trying to get better.
---
but i also get actual new killers of yellow-green ranks and trust me, they don't want to face me. just like i don't want to face them since they don't have enough map knowledge and experience to beat me in chase or outmindgame so there's literally no fun. 
---
hopefully they fix this shit soon enough and you'll get to learn maps and mechanics with less stressful games :c
---
In turn, I think secret offerings shouldn't be shown at all. Especially since there's so few secret offerings, what should be (for example) a surprise mori isn't a surprise at all. 
---
ah i see you’re a man of culture as well
---
Wait, better ping? I'm still getting 300 ping killers 2/3 lobbies I join.
---
What conditions? What changed? I’ve been away for a bit lol
---
Let me say "Come to Freddy" at the start of a chase.
---
The army of Toxicia. The laws require all citizens to own flashlight and know how to tend to their own wounds instead of letting others help them.
---
It ruins the fun for the person on the hook though, it’s not just about the gens
---
"your copy"
---
*Was posted five days before this one*
---
Ok...
---
Bodyblocking doesn't specifically mean a survivor blocking another survivor. It can mean a variety of things.
---
Blocking hooks, trapping a survivor in a corner for a few seconds to get a hit, etc, falls under the term bodyblocking.
---
However, constantly Body blocking your fellow survivor, getting them downed is also caller Sandbagging and is reportable
---
Oh god yes. When I sacrifice a survivor I want Freddy to say “This is god” while the survivor screams 
---
Facts right here. I main surv. I would rather learn about a mori ingame with no prior knowledge or hints then know before I even load in
---
The game actually does run much much better on console now, I'd say an average of 45-50~ frames with it getting upto 60fps at certain times.
---
Some kind of bug. Happened to me earlier tonight as well. 
---
Guess all those streams where Cote was wearing a Naughty Bear t-shirt were too subtle ;)
---
She does? From what I remember she doesn’t speak at all. Only plague does and that’s a dead language. 
---
My mans really looking at the cote bulge 👀
---
Hey, fair enough.
---
Exactly. There's literally no reason to show flipped over, secret offerings other than to make the other side anxious and tip them off that something's up... when the whole thing was supposed to be secret in the first place.
---
Soft patrollers*
---
It's to bait that you have it but you don't 
---
I like to!!
---
Right now, they have swapped back to the old system that has been in the game for years 
---
Getting adept killer is impossible
---
yeah but what red rank killers should do with Adiris? the fukin Gatekeeper cucks me every time, i can't fukin kill people fast enough with her. despite 115 speed she's a much slower killer with all the charging and need to walk all the way to get corrupt purge. 
---
and on red ranks i can't afford to stay by the hook for a bit to look around since the base perks are trash and don't help tracking cause the game will think i'm camping and the worst part is that someone unhooks like 7 seconds after i left. 
---
or there's other scenario where i get low ranks cause of shit matchmaking and then people suicide on hooks or don't save or overall die too fast so i physically can't get 2 pips.
---
honestly, that's bullshit. most people go for achievements when they reached most things in game already so they like.. go for achievements pretty much since not much to do anymore. these people are mostly high ranks so...
---
Imagining the headless horseman getting looked at the killers shack kind of made me chuckle
---
I'm refering mainly to the actual outfit.
---
Because they already had Billy in the game before the Chainsaw Massacre guys came to them about adding LF. They had to make the chainsaw work as differently as possible lol. He is basically a worse Billy though. The only thing he's better at is camping.
---
Yeah it'd be great if I didn't get singled out because I made a pallet save on a wraith as Quintin and got chased down, hooked then Bing bong Bing bong then Nea who I made the pallet save for unhooks me bodyblocks wraith, he still goes after me I loop for like 20 seconds he rehooks me, Nea comes back unhooks me bodyblocks twice getting herself downed, I managed to get away and start using my first aid kit, turns out wraith has Nurses Calling, ignores the Nea he just downed, I'm chased down, lasted for about a min running, last Gen pops I get hit(had NoED but was already injured) all three other survivors escape I got barely any points and only safety pip  from boldness and the one Gen I helped on.
---
he already hooked two of the others but instead he tunnel visions the fresh Quentin and ruins his game all because he made a pallet save for a Nea because wraith picked her up under the pallet.
---
Tunneling is the worst
---
Same here, it was right after reset day so I was a lowly Level 20 facing Red Rankers.
---
Eh. If you are "farming" with someone,  and down them to kill them when they aren't expecting it, it comes off as a dick move. Especially if she's just standing there chilling with you,  thinking it's all fun and games lol. Killers have been fake farming to get easy kills and be dicks lately. So, she may have thought that? I personally wouldn't have dc'd and lost my points I did get to farm,  but if she farmed with you and you killed her instead of her non helpful team mates she probably felt betrayed and left. Lol. 
---
Mcote is a treasure to the community 
---
You have no idea the physical toll that three vasectomies have on a person!
---
Look how fun Legion is. So much fun. Great game.
---
I looped the Doctor for 3 generators once, he camped me while my team finished the last 2 and escaped. I took that camp as a badge of honor.
---
Shame that a 4 minute loop worthy of 2 minutes facecamping is worth so little in Blood Points, I came last on the team.
---
I too glance over my shoulder at the camera of my life
---
You can try the DBD official discord, there is a game finding chat there.

---
i know that you wont scream from the plague perk, but you still do the animation so it may be like docs shock therapy, where you dont scream but do the teir up animation
---
Wait, was it really? Oh, man, Naughty Bear was crazy fun, albeit buggy as hell. ~~Sounds familiar~~
---
“We have a Hulk.”  
---
“We have a Claudette army...”
---
\*pikachu face\*
---
Running the Killer in circles around an object with a pallet nearby to prolong the chase before he gets too close and you eventually drop it in his face, as opposed to dropping the pallet immediately when he's still a few meters away from you.
---
When she's hit she says stuff like "Ahhh! Damn..." and other things.
---
i don't understand these dumb asses. 
---
when killer clearly dominates or decides to farm because of hook suicide/dc, in the end i make them kill me so they'd get enough bp/didn't lose a pip because clearly i wouldn't get as much points with 3 men on 5 gens or where we messed up as a team. so dying is cool cool since killer was so nice to let us get more bp. simple as that. if survivors feel "betrayed" then they're very much entitled and have never played killer. cause, in fact, with the farm survivors get more bp than killers. so, yeah...
---
If your the one on the hook then it fucking sucks and if your the killer you can’t be having much fun just standing still most of the game that it took half an hour to get into 
---
This meme format is incredible I hope it catches on
---
I'll never agree that it's fine to make something broken just because it's rare.
---
Iridescent head is rare but I have like 200+ of it. If I wanted to I could ruin 200+ games for people. That's just bad design.
---
So was Doritos Crash Course lul
---
Not even a *groovy*? 
---
Time to riot (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
---
“Completing gens quickly and ending the killers game is ok because its the objective, but killers trying to kill survivors quickly because is their objective is mess up because you’re ending a survivors game.”
---
It’s literally the same thing, with gen rushing you’re essentially going try hard, securing your victory, and ruining the killers fun, when the killer tunnels, he’s going try hard, securing his victory, and ruining your fun.
---
Either they’re both ok or neither of them are.
---
Maybe that's the case, but I couldn't find her team mates at all during the match (new map experience) so I thought she would be fine with it. I think near the end is when she started to go against it, because she started to run from pallets instead of slamming them. I did stand still as she ran around me but I think that's just what you do to mess with huntress. The teammates did save each other, heal each other and do gens while she ran around for pallets so idk. Did down her after the gates opened and she was in the middle, kinda too late to ask the person via steam but hopefully no hard feelings with em :/
---
People don’t like it because It’s really annoying, and there’s almost nothing you can do to combat it except running borrowed time which is kinda broken rn. This really ruins the experience for people as it’s unfair that the killer is rewarded for standing around doing nothing, and the survivor is punished for something out of their control. That being said, I can understand camping in certain situations, like when the exit gates are opened and you don’t want them to escape, or when survivors are bum rushing the hook. Overall it’s really unfair and unfun on the survivors part.
---
I've had one game like that and it's because a killer kept trying to hook me while I had boil over. I only safety piped, tunneling isn't beneficial for either side 0_0
---
yes? i did use slightly different words in agreement with your comment? is this like.. wrong? 
---
you showed weakness in your reply to me by taking the words "these dumbasses" as a personal insult. that literally means you have a low self-esteem and megalomania of stage 3 with what you take all unpleasant things personal even if they are not referred to you. you even were so unconfident in your own post that you felt the need to explain something when there was literally nothing personal in my first reply. 
---
If your that scared of flashlight than.... go play something else? Otherwise like 1 of those perks work
---
u turned all the 13 year olds on im ashamed of you
---
Jump off a bridge 
---
Define "unfair".
---
Is it "fair" when you revive someone I've downed? What about when you unhook them? Is it fair if I'm 15 feet away? What about 25?
---
The answer is that *everything* is fair. Every player is entitled to doing *everything they can* to win. Because that's how a lot of people have fun: by trying to win. If you tell me camping is "unfair" or "not fun", I'll tell you that using pallets is too.
---
It's not my opinion when it's been shown through stats that prior to this patch, killers got an average of 2 kills per match. That's even.
---
After this patch, survivors rarely survive. If they do its via a hatch. Now when you have a game mechanic where you need to power up the gates but the majority of the survivors now escape via hatch, there's clear problem in the game balance.
---
Then why are you even arguing? To show that you are not biased? It only makes you sound like a fool. I play killers and it's a joke how easy it is now. 
---
Yeah, I don't see why she left at all. I have non stop dcs as killer. I was trying to use devour all hope to get a daily done,  and couldn't because of constant dcs. You literally cannot camp using that either,  so they had no reason but to be dicks. Most survivors are.
---
Wait...you mean you have a perk that might help you and make the game harder for ME?!? That's unheard of!
---
That's what I'm thinking from this too; especially "nothing like that".
---
Once again my dreams are crushed. :,(
---
Genneling
---
He’s clearly going through some deep emotional issues that are pouring out into his gaming experiences. 
---
In your TLDR you say its conditionless but it's not. When the perk is activated you're shown to the killer until they down you if you're so far away. That's a pretty hefty condition. 
---
pallets, and reviving are "elements of the game", but camping is an "exploitation"? you're making up rules based on literally nothing. what if i called healing exploitative, and said that camping was an element of the game?
---
for the record, camping is just another word for defending an objective. it exists in literally every single competitive game that has ever existed since the beginning of time. goalies are campers. blockers are campers. snipers are campers. soldiers are campers. everyone camps, because camping is how you defend something. you sit on it.
---
to say camping is unfair or exploitative is asinine.
---
Well empathy doesnt reveal the killer anyways ~~exept nea~~
---
What do you mean, all of a sudden? It's been this way the whole time I've been playing. 
---
You make jokes but we all know this killer would be awesome
---
Okay, will check it out !
---
&gt; just do your best to kick ass and kill babies
---
Imagine reading out of context
---
first of all, i did not quote cause quote is a direct usage of same sentence or am i wrong? i actually just described my own opinion and experience that happen to be similar to yours but not 100% accurate cause i have different motivation for it. 
---
you choosing words, you making a decision of something to get to you shows what kind of person you are, do you realize that? you being protective right now and saying "it's not deep" just shows that you specifically have what i said you have cause despite low self-esteem your megalomania makes you feel pride. these are contradictive things yet very common in current society. your name is PickleRick i'd assume ironically right now but pretty sure you got it slightly before they started shitting on Rick and Morty. so you definitely have a feeling of superiority because you were able to understand most things in first season but at the same time you know that so does any other person who is not a complete idiot. therefore it is the feeling of superiority over little minority which you can't always properly distinguish but realization that you're not very special. very sad combination of feelings. 
---
also, your "LMFAO" thingies just cry with insecurities.
---
i hope you'll find love and acceptance in yourself. until then no one will be able to love and accept you cause you simply don't let anyone to since you don't love and accept yourself. 
---
##NO REPLY
---
Looks like the killer is just afk. They didn't come closer to you that entire time
---
Dbd is probably the last game you want to play if you have emotional issues. 
---
Not reading all that, have a good night. Lol.
---
Been this way forever. Don't know how you're just noticing. 
---
It has a downside, what I mean by conditionless is that nothing (I would definitely consider 3 hits nothing, as that's basically guaranteed every match unless you're against a killer who will ignore this anyway) is required to get the extra free hit. New DS is on a timer from being unhooked, the condition is that the killer has to tunnel. Flip Flop is a huge chance to wiggle off but it isn't just a given that you'll get to use it. Dead Hard requires timing. Adrenaline is only effective if you're injured, downed or hooked at a very specific time in the match.
---
The survivor doesn't need to do anything to get it to work, the killer can't look at the game and go "I have an obsession, I can avoid doing X, Y or Z to avoid having chunks of my time wasted by free hits." Yes, you get revealed if you heal to full, but that basically has no effect if it triggers anywhere near the end game, if the survivor is a strong looper/time waster anyway.
---
Like I said, I don't mind perks which make survivors more survivable, or that punish things killers bring to gain an advantage like Exposed, but to just get free hits every game is so against all the changes they've been making recently to better balance the timing of matches.
---
oh i am sure you read it. you had to type this out thinking that this will give you victory or something? no, love. firstly cause it wasn't a competition, i genuinely feel bad for you and wish you the best. secondly, it only proved my words again. 
---
I call it trying to accomplish daily ritual, 2 sacrifices as clown. I felt so bad about those poor survivors. 
---
Oh. Nice. Even missed skill checks on madness 3? 
---
Like this perk is CRAZY strong against some killers. I’ve started using it and not really sure how I feel about it. 
---
Playing as killer this perk is definitely annoying. It’s harder to hear where they run off to after a hit. So if it’s around a corner they can urban away, lost forever. :’(
---
With infantry belt. I don't use em but I was desperate. I can't hit worth shit with huntress
---
They have their similarities. You run around and murder people, sabotage vehicles, place bear-traps, keep people from escaping or calling the police. Really it's more akin to Friday the Thirteenth, but for someone who wants to know what it is, saying "Dead by Daylight but with Bears" works fine. 
---
Heres hoping for a better killer/survivor relationship. If that could even happen lol
---
Saying “dead by daylight but with bears” would still be a worse way to describe it to someone than “Hitman but with bears”. 
---
Just be glad you hear the Bing Bong before the chase, he has add-on's to remove that.
---
You may be a good artist, but your photography skills need improvement...

I did it with Legion 3 times, but the trophy never popped because it was when the game was fucked up when he was new. So that's just one more problem with him. 
---
They've actually made *TONS* of games! They've been working hard since 1992! You can see a neat timeline on their site, [here](https://www.bhvr.com/about-bhvr/), or see a full list of games [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_Interactive#Titles)!
---
Some notable titles include:
---
* A *lot* of movie and TV tie-ins
---
* Dante's Inferno
---
* Naughty Bear (as stated above)
---
* Doritos Crash Course
---
* Fallout Shelter
---
* Halo Wars: Definitive Edition
---
* Star Citizen
---
Baby noed killer
---
You can’t do Tea-bag or anything against legion 
---
And then the select few who manage to fail at facecamping, and then get pissed that they’re garbage
---
these are really good arguments. and a mean for me to completely stop playing anyone but Rin since i don't like Billy and Nurse or any instadowns. 
---
as in i'm actually a Freddy main. and i don't think he's bad as they meme. but i do know what it's like to get several old ds in one game when you have no help in chase. this perk is truly even worse especially for Fred and Doctor cause with other killers i at least see ways of avoiding hard damage (Rin grabs and phase, Michael tier 3 from what you mentioned. but even Trapper and Hag are kind of fine. Clown has bottles. Legion doesn't even care, his power is designed to do more than two hits. Adiris might suffer a bit but not too much with corrupt purge. Huntress is fine, Bing Bong can catch up relatively fast). but yeah, old ds you could at least slug or dribble to the hook, not sure why so many people complained about this perk it wasn't a game changer for a good killer. while this perk will be a game changer especially for Freddy and Doctor mains. 
---
Real talk the learning curve is way more brutal than the ranking system for new players. I can’t loop worth shit cause I have like fifty hours in game but I’m hovering right around rank 12-13 for some reason.. I got a match with No0b3 this week and he edited baby crying noises over clips of me running around calling me a baby meg and shit lmao. Love this game but it’s so stressful 
---
I view camping similarly to gen-rushing with 4 BNPs. It sucks when you're on the receiving end, and it means you're sacrificing the advantage of adventurous play/other items. However, it's great for guaranteeing that you'll complete that one objective and you shouldn't be shamed for it.
---
Nah, I love Naughty Bear! I think it didn't get as much praise as it deserved. 
---
The trailers for Naughty Bear, when they parodied movies, those were hilarious. 
---
I actually agree with this. 
---
Until the whole ‘snatched-up-by-an-omnipresent-evil-being-and-being-stuck-in-an-existence-somewhere-between-life-and-death’ thing. 
---
Was that last message an attempt to appear as a sort of 'official' system message?
---
Yep. Doing the only thing that ensures your survival is toxic. How dare players adapt to the environment of the game.
---
When do you think the circle jerking killer mains on Steam discussions will be happy? When survivors spawn on the hook?
---
Same issue here. On PC. 
---
Capitalism is the source of your problems when you just have too dang much food in your country. 
---
I mean, maybe stop? Stop trying to constantly change matchamking, you’ve honestly fucked it so hard... I’m on ps4, it takes SO LONG to get a server, just to have it be red ping, and to top it off be against lower rank killers? (Ranks 2-5, while I’m rank 11.) i don’t mind lower level killers but I do mind never joining lobbies with at least yellow ping, it’s annoying. Every game I joined is either lower ranks and red ping or yellow ping and rank 14-16 killers+ who face camp. Please, stop. I love the game and its ruined my experience this past week with the constant changes.
---
The tracking and audio have been broken for a while now, and I doubt they are able to fix it.

Dunno that it really fixed anything... I’m on ps4 and the queue times are LONG and now after the update I’ve been getting put into 200+ red ping servers, lower rank killers ranked 2-5 or both.
---
Honestly it seems pretty balanced. 
---
If you can see them even in swf, you can just tell where the killer is going and get safe unhooks. Survivors getting unhooked should NOT be a concern to killers.
---
It counters toxic plays. Unhooks are good for both sides. 
---
*Higher on the street, and I know it’s my time to go!*
---
I accidentally sandbagged someone as Adam
---
Were you also an Adam
---
He was either trying to be funny (but failing miserably) or has mental issues.
---
But Bruce is still alive. Because he’s a “survivor”
---
You don’t seem like you did it to be a jerk, but it seriously is like the most broken thing a killer can use in this game (ebony plus one shot hatchet). I would’ve been like the first guy and DCed. Moris alone are OP enough as it is. The person probably felt like you screwed with them and felt annoyed that they didn’t DC earlier would be my guess. 
---
They’ve done so many hidden gems in the past such as Jersey Devil 
---
Just going to throw it out there that when a survivor or unhooks in your face, you have to make a conscious effort to tunnel because it’s so easy to take down the unhooker instead. You can call it what you want but you’re still a *little* scummy for it. 
---
It helps to know when/if help is on the way. 
---
Sometimes it's good to know if my fellow Survivors are right around the corner waiting to save me or across the map on a gen. And along those lines it can give you an indicator of if a killer is running certain perks. If you can see a survivor far off on a gen and the Killers beelines it for them that's probably BBQ. 
---
it was worse over time, first time didn't take too long then the more she hit us the longest it took ending up to be around 4 mins
---
With me its usually I get downed by some BS and face camped
---
I saw a guy on a video named I'm sexy and I noed. Probably the best name I saw on dbd
---
It is in fact very true. You can recover from gen rushing, you cannot usually recover from a tunnel. A killer might also only lose 1/4 or 2/4 of the game if they get rushed. A survivor loses 100% of the game if they die, as not all survivors play for the team alone, as they dont receive full BP or points themselves.
---
As in 2 hits right after eachother or 1st hit before mending 2nd after mending?
---
Yeah I have a few questions. First of all, how dare you.
---
Corrupt intervention is an alright perk. As I expected, survivors will just hide until it's done or do different gens when the killer is away. I did not try it on doc but I think it'll be a good perk on him 
---
&gt; An original meme.
---
[???](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-trolley-problem)
---
Under a normal circumstance you have 100% generator repair speed if working alone on a generator and 90% if working with another survivor.
---
2 survivors on a generator is two players both repairing at 90% (180% when combined). 3 survivors is 270% and 4 is 360%.
---
With prove thyself players no longer drop to 90%.
---
2 survivors on a generator is two players repairing at 100% (200% when combined). 3 survivors is 300% and 4 is 400%.
---
Thanks!
---
Hmm, kinda makes sense. It's like a sudden pull on the breaks on fun.
---
I would see what you mean though if it was a case without a very OP add on involved. To me there’s a difference between a killer legit steamrolling and letting the last person farm out of pity vs using one shot hatchets, me sticking around after a DC, and then trying to mori me. With the former, the killer is doing me a favor, with the latter I actually feel I am the one doing them a favor by not instantly DCing! So I could see a certain feeling of betrayal there where the mori comes out. 
---
OP did say it was a Legion player.
---
Ugh, I have the hots for Mathieu
---
Yes
---
Given the rules of the entity's realm, I think it's literally just fine.
---
Bruce Campbell was clearly perfectly on board with it, given his voice and likeness being involved this time around compared to others. So I don't think he minds.
---
These people need to remember that DbD is it's own thing. And while some licensed killers may play similarly or closely to their source material, a survivor is confined by the rules of the trials in the fog. Just like the killers to an extent. Bill or Ash can't go kicking ass but it's not some attempt to neuter them. I heard a complaint from some horror channel just talking about F13 for like 20 minutes. I love F13 just as much almost, but that's a game playing closely to it's source material. Whereras, again, DbD is more of it's own ordeal.
---
How are you STILL whining about decisive?
---
God damn you, Chelsea
---
I agree, it would be stupid to have a super powerful character come from any franchise and just start kicking everyone’s arses.
---
Gotta throw that Lery's + scratched mirror on. Streamers cant talk shit when they're too busy screaming.
---
I mean, as the comment says, (pre DS rework), it was unfun and unfair to play against at the time, was it not?
---
Are people honestly bickering about this? We got fucking ASH for the Evil Dead!! 
---
F
---
That's actually quite neat and I did not realize that was an option.
---
Better idea would be to do that gen three feet away, it's not like she can stop you. But if she tried, it's a free hatch. 
---
I’ll answer that with a question of my own, how did you fail to read the second line my comment? 
---
Can a land of glowy trees be a map because that looks sick as fuck.
---
Could not agree more. Hate it when people say gen rushing, pallet looping, camping and Tunneling are toxic. Also hate it when people say using strong perks and add ons(old ds, noed, iridescent head and insta heals) are toxic.The only thing that is toxic is BMing, which is doing something to purely piss someone off rather than gain a competitive advantage. (tbagging and flashlight clicking at the killer for survivors, nodding and constantly hitting a hooked survivor as killer). Toxicity is how you act;not what you do to win. 
---
Not really it honestly sounds like you’re dumb. I see the similarities. My mans just trying to sum it up you know? nobody wants to just fully describe something it’s to much to type why am I ? You’re probably asking it because I’m drunk and just got off work and finished watching pewds! You should too and sub to him on YouTube! @pewdiepie 
---
Nah I can't imagine a life where I have to find food and survive, I'd die because I'm a pussy.
---
Yea, this is why I made this post. He’s very passionate about being negative for some reason.

I love the ppl who DC and screw over their team
---
The types of addons you'd be protecting with it are already ridiculously powerful anyways.  Do you really need a buff to hide the fact that you're playing a black ward too?  The system is perfectly fine as is.  They still have to guess what you're running.  There's at least a few killers where it could be a couple different setups.  Trapper immediately comes to mind.
---
Did it make you feel better?
---
holy shit you guys look bomb as fuck.
---
where do you get the masks from? I'd love to put some up in my house for extra virgin collector swag
---
Okay, time for you to log off Reddit for the night buddy. Go sober up a bit or take a nap
---
As do I any of you all are welcome to add/invite. Prime Kami is the gt
---
overall she isnt a great killer
---
she just excels at 1 aspect of the game that no one likes
---
just like how leatherface is great at camping, legion is great at tunneling 
---
his power lets her injure everyone super quickly but the way people play him is to back off a chase for a second after they put someone into deep wound status. this ends the chase and begins the countdown on the deepwound timer. then legion just falls the scratch marks while looking down the whole time. of the trails of blood if they are using blood hound. it puts the person they are tunneling into an unwinnable situation
---
since the chase hasnt technically started again the timer is still going down which will put them down if they dont mend, but if they stop to mend the killer will catch them and down them anyway. 
---
If they switched chainsaws they would both move up a tier in the killer rankings. 
---
I find it bold how you would post this. Camping and giving them no chance once they’re hooked drains the fun out of the game but it’s not like there was any fun left since you took the thrill out of it by not giving them a chase.
---
The people who sell the merchs for sure aren't in charge for programming the game.
---
Selling merchs: more money... better chances to hire people who are good at programming = game might get fix...
---
You wouldn't blame the voice actor of Ash Williams for ingame bugs, only cuz he's connected to game, would you?
---
Was this written by a child?
---
Got to give them credit.  The new optimization update they put out made the game so much smoother on both sides for PS4.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
---
We got a boomer
---
Ive seen a few of his videos. Usually about F13 more often than not. He probably just isnt fond of dbd's gameplay, I'd assume based off how much he praises F13. Like I said in my other comment, one plays like a silly movie which is great, the other does its own thing which is also great.
---
That was my thought haha. One of them was really mad about it though. Oh well.
---
I dont care what killer you main im just trying to play the game...
---
I agree that killers add ons and offerings are way stronger than survivors, but I think you forgot keys. They're super strong too 
---
*runs at you facing the ground*
---
Bad manners
---
Monto did this it took those guys awhile too.
---
Why so toxic? I’m just being honest. The dude was just trying to sum it up but you insisted on shitting on him. Why don’t you fuck off and stop being a dick to people who just want to express their opinion on reddit. 🤷🏽‍♂️ #HATERz 
---
This is just an about for time it takes to mend
---
1st mend bar: 22 seconds
---
2nd: 30 something seconds
---
3rd: 52 seconds
---
4th: 1 minute 22 seconds
---
5th: 2 minutes
---
6th: 3 minutes 15 seconds
---
7th: 4, maybe almost 5, minutes
---
have no idea if it goes on longer
---
Smooth gameplay. Much skill.
---
it like 4-5 minutes to mend on either the 6th or 7th hit. Never said this since I started playing Legion: this is a reason to dc to legion
---
also im sorry i couldn't find the right flair

He just went into frenzy when i used it. Thought he was going to stab me! 
---
a person after 20 hours asking a question if ranks supposed to be like that and rants of how unfair it is for newer players with no perks or experience definitely brags, sure.
---
cheesus, what is wrong with people here?
---
Camping is a justified strategy when the gates are powered/open 
---
Face camping just because does little more and ruin the fun of the game 
---
Yes, this here is the best.
---
Dead by daylightn: where your opinion is wrong
---
I dunno though. You call it looping i call it dropping every pallet on the match and screwing your team for later. Thats toxic. Not looping and getting away. In other words if you use more than a few pallets in one chase you aren't good you are just shooting fish in a barrel so to speak. 
---
Remember to attend decision day
---
i know automod it's illegal to post videos of bugs but there's no way to post videos of bugs if you don't have a youtube account to post one to
---
a) I never said they were bragging
---
b) they never said it was unfair
---
b.2) they never mentioned doing poorly
---
b.3) they imply continuing to rank up
---
So how is this a problem at all? Theyre telling us that theyre doing good and ranking up. How is this a problem? 
---
It's almost like the system was introduced as a band-aid for players not feeling like they got nothing much to strive for. 
---
Reported for pressing the bell button on an elevator for no reason
---
Nah I think most survivors would be cool with that.
---
Looks like 7😂
---
I commented in one of his previous videos when the Ash leak had just come out.
---
The guy's completely delusional. He essentially called anyone who plays DbD a whiney baby, and said that none of them know the first thing about "real" horror because all of the licensed Killers would never kill by putting someone on a hook, because video games totally need to be fanatically true to source material. Basically complained for 8 minutes that DbD was killing these horror movie icons... but it's the creators of these franchises that allow THEIR characters to be represented in this games in the first place. People who know / created these characters and understand them a hell of a lot more than some gravelly voiced 50 year old complaining about video games on YouTube.
---
He hyped up LY: The Nightmare as if it was going to be the end all be all and kill DbD, and he's still holding on to some irrational hope that F13: The Game is going to come back from oblivion and the fact that they can't produce any new content due to it's copyright lawsuit. A game which last I checked had less than 300 concurrent players.
---
Did you know that orange isn’t a real color? It’s actually just a fruit. 
---
I actually love this 
---
then gen rushing can be renamed to genneling
---
oh wow that's pretty cool! i'll try your technique
---
That's me every time I come on this sub and see "REEEEEE NOED BROKE" :L
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
Adrenaline has a counter as well: be a competent killer.
---
Im guessing you saw the one video that was posted to the subreddit? If you've seen it you know the one.  
---
Ignore that guy, majority of people are excited.
---
Bold of you to assume the game would EVER GET THERE
---
Idk tho cause usually you only had to wiggle if you had it and wasn’t the obsession cause the skill check came straight away as obsession no?
---
Yeah so dont complain about NOED. I've used both perks. No nerfs for either just stop complaining.
---
They should seriously just expand his arms during the lunge, since it's part if his lore and totally possible to do for him, cause he can do anything in the dream world.
---
noed more punishes the players for only focusing on gens and not cleansing.
---
i don't like neither i use noed but i hate Adrenaline much more so here i am protecting noed. when i play survivor, i make sure there are no dull totems left instead of rushing last gen.
---
But there small and don't forget that on console or just weaker pc's in general there are a lot less frames to hit it in.
---
Well there you go, putting me in my place for the greater good of all future ash mains ❤️
---
Each person has an objective of his own.  
---
For me, it's to not let the doors open. For others it may be killing all survivors, having a good chase, getting all bbq stacks or just getting bloodpoints.  
---
In my opinion, NOED rewards a killer for misplays. If you're a good killer, nearly all of your games won't even get to the stage where all the gens are done. That's just how it is.
---
Translation: *fellow survivor mains, give me upvotes pls*
---
I'm glad he's in the game, I just feel bad that he's missing some of his iconic gear (boomstick, chainsaw hand attachment) but it's great how one of the devs said he'd have some voice lines so I'm pretty grateful for that. 
---
Ok...what is the killers main objective?
---
I haven't once said NOED shouldn't be in the game.  
---
Sure, it's a good perk and annoying to deal with, but for most above average killers, it's a dead perk as they almost never need to deal with adrenaline.  
---
I've used NOED when I started playing killer and I use adrenaline all the time as survivor.
---
F13 is trying to replicate the movies somewhat, DBD is more of an arcadey experience. I also reached about 52 seconds into the video and I can tell I'm gonna have so much fun.
---
__*The greater good*__
---
This is a game made by BHVR, almost all game issue/problems/annoyances have been "fixed" with a perk. Besides the ranking system, the core of dbd hasn't really been changed at all, and I really doubt they could come up with a way to fix tunnelling without reworking several game systems unless it's a perk bandaid fix.
---
I also don't really think the person should just get away if they make unsafe unhooks. Unfortunately, they usually can because the unhooked is injured, so maybe BHVR could implement something like a ten second MYC effect after every unhook, regardless of killer distance.
---
did the rest of the survivors at least do the gens and get away?
---
I think what he meant was obsessions with DS normally don't bother to wiggle because they needed to focus on hitting the skill check
---
Gotta love buying huntress
---
Correct
---
The tiny amounts of shards are compensated by the lower exp required to level up.
---
And I think both devotion and the player level shouldn't be seen as all that significant, since they're just there for us to get shards.
---
Who knows, maybe the devs will give us like 500 shards or so as reward for hitting devotion, but I couldn't imagine anything bigger, since devotion's just there, it comes automaticslly instead of us specifically choosing to do it and we aren't really sacrificing much for it (you only get around .003 shards per exp less for the first levels).
---
Is this real 
---
Pretty sure Detective Tapp would have had a gun too. The entity takes these things from survivors when it brings them to the fog. 
---
Ohhh I didn’t really often run it myself cause it’s a trash perk but never witnessed the obsessions wiggling so I was co fused xzd
---
As a pc main I can confirm it’s no better lobby time wise. It’s still shit.
---
Standing on my feet
---
Great find! Very cool.
---
Ok, because gen rushing doesn't exist, SWF doesn't exist, toolboxes, brand new part, etc., none of those things that allow survivors to complete gens insanely quick, exist
---
I'm gonna get downvoted for everything I say on here and it's not gonna make a difference because of how survivor-sided this sub is, but saying "just don't let them do all the gens" is absolutely ridiculous. To not let all the gens be done, most of the time, requires the survivors to be idiots, and you also have to be on top of your game
---
In the match this post was inspired by, the survivors were idiots. NOED wasn't even the thing that got me 3 extra kills when I should have only gotten one, they fucked themselves. They all grouped up around an exit gate and instead of running to another one or just left until I did, they swarmed around it, and all three of them died because of it
---
NOED doesn't guarantee shit if you play right against it. All it does is speed up the downing process
---
So... next time on Game Grumps.
---
Also rancid abbatoir can have an infinite where you break chase and have no entity blocker depending on RNG and how far from the killer you start the chase.
---
It's a matter of practice.
---
*hear
---
Bloody party streamers = infinite loading screen or double DC every time without fail 
---
You can't if a flashlight save is timed correctly. Looking at walls is the only solution.
---
And you're wrong to think it's that black and white
---
It's a lot easier to be a competent survivor than to be a competent killer
---
As killer you have to keep track of 4 different people who make their own decisions and play their own way, while time is against you
---
As survivor you just have to hide and do gens, which isn't hard while there's three other people the killer has to spend time on finding, downing, and hooking
---
If all four survivors are competent, they're nearly unbeatable
---
Yes it is camping, but seriously, what other choice do you have? You could make a show for the survivor and make it entertaining for them by chasing them the exit, but then you are acting completly out of mercy.
---
Gotta love how I get a notification from No0b3’s Twitter as I see this
---
You're the killer you can play however you like. Don't take it personally. 
---
But after the gates are powered I honestly just wanna move on to the next game and I have no reason to want to stay and play hide and seek with people when I've given them the choice to freely leave.
---
&gt;Personally, as a suggestion, I would far prefer to see something that resists 1 hit down effects and leaves you injured instead. It provides the same element of "Ash is an unstoppable badass" and it counters an effect that survivors hate which currently has no counterplay, 1 hit downs like chainsaws, iri heads and noed, even if it were only once a match, or under specific conditions.
---
I actually really like the thought of that. Something that would counter insta downs, lowering the strength of stuff like NOED and iridescent hatchets. Might be considered OP when used against killers like Myers and LF but would rarely hurt m1 killers like Wraith and Freddy unless they are using MYC or NOED. Maybe a token based system so it can only activate once or twice per match, otherwise it really could neuter killers like Myers and LF. I agree that at present this perk looks worrying, though I'm prepared to experience it first &amp; see if the aura reveal is strong enough to counterbalance it. 
---
Damn American Education System teaching us so many lies.
---
When your aura is revealed it's impossible to mind game therefore making looping harder 
---
Nothing :( this was like 2-3 mins into the match
---
your flair is the first opinion that is a proven fact.
---
Exactly. NOED should remind people that there are other objectives besides doing gens and escaping
---
These people will say "oh just be a good killer" but are baffled when they're told "well just cleanse totems"
---
r/whooosh
---
It's camping but when the gates are powered camping is necessary. I hate campers but this is the only time that it is valid. 
---
Why do Killers like to combine nouns and the verb "to rush" so much? I don't get it ;-)
---
What’s ly: the nightmare? 
---
Also, he's a killer cos he wasn't invited to the party the other bears were having.
---
It's camping but its a widely accepted form of Camping.  
---
usually camping is only bad when you do it for the sake of being an ass or if you don't know how to do anything else.  
---
Camping is fine if it's the strategically best choice at that moment, such as Survs swarming hook or open gates.
---
My favorite thing to hear from the survivor community is "dont tunnel  me because it ruins my game and isn't fun" 
---
Killers don't play the game so you can have a good time lmao.
---
Yep, April 2nd
---
Lol I’m guessing u were able to just walk up to her, take a hit and heal for wglf 😂😂 
---
Its be interesting to hear that. And honestlu id love to be playing as a survivor and do that. But i feel that itd be a little powerful, killer mains were angry over DS (before patch). Adding something else thay stuns the killer would be a little overpowered especially something that doesnt require aiming besides pointing in a direction. Although it would be cool.
---
Its not meant to get of chases, but just to distract the killer, lose the focus.
---
Your aura is only revealed outside 16 meters, that's bigger than nearly any jungle gym.
---
Had a match similar to that recently.  Every time he hooked somebody he face camped them to death. It was a very boring match
---
oh nvm then i missunderstood the perk
---
Yea. Honestly i wasn't even mad, just baffled that someone plays like that. She even chased me like 5 mins, and was obviously REALLY BAD. I kinda felt bad and wanted to give her some tips but she dc:d immediately in the post game chat
---
How the tables have turned
---
That's only if you disconnect from the Internet. If you disconnect by clicking the leave match button its fine. 
---
A WKUK reference, now I can die happy. 
---
Maybe not. It's not like we can't all have different feelings. 
---
It depends on the person you are, or how you roleplay (if at all).
---
I play a lot of Tapp, where my goal is to get *someone* out. If I die, I don't care. I used to pip easily in the old system, as long as I was a strong teammate. And it's a bit more fun, and fair to the killer, if I am willing to trade myself for someone. Other Ayers appreciate that kind of play. 
---
The way you play is a bit of a reflection of who you are inside, as a person. I make these comments based on the idea that everyone knows this, and understands it.
---
Your main, your build, and your idea of winning and losing in such a complex game is part of you. Let's be honest, if a killer can 4k and depip, then where is a win? Your choice, I guess. 
---
I didn't play too much of the first game but I absolutely loved Panic In Paradise. It was fantastic.
---
This game is becoming balanced around SWF so solo teams get shit on all the time lmfao so I don't know what you're chatting. 
---
It was just a joke, guy.. Take it easy there, Reddit warrior. "Cheesus.."
---
Unpainted figure, I believe.
---
It doesn’t really have an effect on the game as it just prevents that pallet from spawning at a different loop but yeah, I’ve seen it a bit lately.
---
Survivors literally could heal at the other side of a safe pallet in the killers face after 2 or 3 pallets.
---
yea.
---
I can understand people being bummed out that a character they like isn't going t be just like they are from their own thing but at the same time I think it's great to see these characters around in more things.
---
What the survivor thinks im thinking:
---
"This guy is such pain in the ass, I'm gonna face camp and tunnel him"
---
What I'm actually thinking:
---
"This sensitivity is too low for billy, which setting did i use previously"
---
What an awful idea.
---
Imagine this, they announce the DBD chapter is the last chapter. DBD 2 is on the way as this is the biggest cash cow they've ever had.
---
Now in the final few months of the game they release a killer and survivor so OP that it ruins the game for those final few months. Do you think people will be happy to buy the sequel?
---
PepeLaugh
---
I prefer the “shut hatch and all doors can be opened” 
---
I DC
---
Killer info is hidden until the trial is conpletly over meaning everyone is dead or escaped.
---
The reason for this is because survive with friends groups would tell their friends what the killer had when they died. It gave survive with friends and advantage over solo survivors and over the killer.
---
Is this happening while people are still in the match because that's what they introduced to stop SWF groups knowing what the killer has after 1DCs or dies
---
I love it when you play with random survivors that unhook you in front of the killer but legit refuse to body block 
---

April 2nd and no map or Killer. It's like the Leatherface DLC.
---
WKUK shorts have suddenly started popping up in my YouTube recommended feed. 
---
If you explain the situation in your refund request, making sure to explain it as the update making the game unplayable due to your condition, you could probably get a refund. The 2 hours limit is for guaranteed refunds without needing a real reason.
---
Unfortunately there's not much that can be done to help you play the game. There'd be no killers at all if BHVR had to avoid every phobia and condition, and I don't think the playerbase is big enough to allow people to disable killers, otherwise it'd be impossible to find a game as legion. The best hope is that maybe they add customization to let the visual effects be turned off or replaced.
---
You could try messing with some real-time shaders like nvidia's thing to change the color of the vomit to blue or something, that might help, but it'd make your game look crazy. Then just play without sound when against plague, treat it as a throwaway fun match.
---
Not participate in a standoff in the first place. Of course they’re survivor sided but the survivor is the one who has to gamble to try to escape. That doesn’t make them any less of a stand-off moron but they have to act. The killer has to do anything else beforehand. 
---
Others were having fun with it lol
---
So you suggest that a killer should just give up else its a moron
---
The way the title is worded is off. I mean how I hit the jump out button and nothing happens for a full second
---
If the man doesn’t at the very least say groovy when he’s selected, im gonna be super bummed. 
---
New Map confirmed: Hells Swamp.
---
(for real I just want to play trapper but not having nurse/billy/spirit mobility against 4 man swf is just an autoloss)
---
Lmaoooo, console peasent? Nice. How about you just dont play if you dont appreciate the things they have improved?
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that made it impossible to rescue a dying survivor with a pallet/flashlight save while being picked up or dropped mid animation. Now, the pick up/drop animation will play fully, followed by the flashlight/pallet stun.
---
Yup
---
But still having 2 together is problematic as it allows a good survivor to loop it for potentially longer than if it were spread out.
---
Bill says "Why?" while wiggling on the killer shoulder.
---
Maybe if it's in a match it will be something similar or a tad more elaborate.
---
Ochido fan most likely
---
Wait. Isn't Star Citizen that super ambitious space game that flopped?
---
I know, that premium skin is worth the money /s
---
Were do you find these at paxs? Is it hidden around the convention?
---
Infectious fright? Who had that perk?
---
It would have been better if he ran away to live in a park... &gt;_&gt;
---
It doesn't necessarily have to involve nerfing SWF, it could involve making the sort of communication they have baseline (i.e.: in game chat) and balancing killer around that. I don't think that's a very elegant solution, just an example. The difference between the two is so massive that nurse/billy/spirit should never get less than a 4k against soloqueue, yet they're the only ones who can compete against SWF.
---
I don't want that. I just want to play fun killers.
---
They need to rework headon not lockers
---
My case. His perks are good
---
I thought it was obvious from the messages that I killed myself on hook while my friend was the last one alive so he could get the hatch. The killer was chasing him when I suicided, he then hit my friend and he just yeeted himself into the hatch and escaped. 
---
Downvoted for not playing like an idiot lol. I've never understood the stigma around tunneling. Sure, it sucks to be tunnelled.. But like... Killing is the only killer objective. As long as the killer isn't camping and then tunneling someone, it's fair game. Letting injured survivors go to hit the body blockers is a quick way to lose a match with no kills.
---
Jane is fake confirmed.

I hope this means they add more voice lines.

Space of 3 days consecutively 
---
Is  this you devs?
---
Not really, each pallet will still only looped as long as it normally would assuming the killer plays right. Honestly they might last even less time then they should due to there being no travel distance between the two.
---
Repairing a generator alone is IMPOSSIBLE. He can break it and you have to do everything again. There are also only 2 gens so he can just patrol them and you won't be able to do anything
---
Not as viable you mean. If you get triple lockered that’s a solid play on their parts. Most don’t play well. TRUST me most are greedy like me getting sweet sweet points or just potato bushing.
---
That's why I always run borrowed time. Fuck your face camping, face camp deez nuts as I teabag your toxic ass for face camping.
---
I wouldn't want people to stop playing the game-- but I would like for them to learn how to treat others, but if it must come to that, I'd rather that than people have to deal with butts. :(
---
If all you care about is winning and you don't give a shit if the people around you have fun, then no wonder survivors and killers are so divided. If everyone were like you the game would be "who can bully the other player harder". relax a bit, not every game is hard, and if you see you're facing survivors you can easily stomp, play with them a bit, make some bad plays that will get you more bloodpoints, do something stupid but is overall funner. You don't have to tryhard every single game, and overall it feels like a lot of fun for me to do this instead of tryharding. 
---
I had a blast at a 3 vs 1 as Billy where I decided to use only the chainsaw because 3 vs 1 are just so easy and queue times are long. 
---
Obviously some games will be hard and you'll need to focus and tryhard, but you don't have to crush every single game. Stomps are not fun.

Sometimes it's nice to have fun in video games.
---
Just securing your kill, no problem with that. 
---
But I can't buy him from shards
---
Can't get him with shards
---
I really enjoy spirit and her perks are kinda nice so she gets my vote 
---
I mean, I get that it's infuriating. I play both sides and have raged over getting tunnelled plenty of times. But again, I accept it as the way the game goes. Only time I feel really cheated is when the killer legit searches for me and ignores everything else just to get me out. But if my teammates unhook me like twats near the killer and I'm deleted, well, it's the same thing I'd do as a killer. 
---
O I forgot lol. I would get plague in that case. I find her playstyle to be pretty fun with her power.
---
At least I kind of understand your point. Even if it is very one sided. Im not gonna argue about the nurse/billy steamroll thing as thats another of my strong opinions, so whatever. Have a good day
---
SWF in 2020
---
[removed]
---
Picking the eaiser target is the smart thing to do as a killer. It's just for me, sometimes the smart thing isn't the fun thing. As the game wraps up, then I start going a bit tougher - this might just be me though, since I play end-game Freddy usually and I don't like having people dead before I get to use any of my perks.
---
true but you gotta give the man credit for survivor reopening hatch
---
Fun strategy i use at rank 1 when I get bored is trappers basement.
---
Absolutely ruined some swf’s, the messages were hilarious. 
---
spagett for next killer
---
Haha i had no better angle ;)
---
So stop body blocking it
---
Can I steal your luck where killers don't tunnel you when team mates are trying to farm you? It's.. for science.
---
Bonus: Dwight's own personal heaven.
---
Before people ask, I have tried verifying my files with steam, but it said everything was there. :( I pretty much can't play survivor at more than potato level.
---
Also I had this idea in mind for games that come down to 1-2 generators left for exit gates to open. So if the killer decides to camp a jammed hatch with 1 gen remaining then they're risking the survivor not only reopening the hatch upon the generators completion, but also powering up the exit gates. 
---
Where is this information coming from?
---
I love playing Freddy because his power grants him amazing map awareness when he has everyone in sleep mode. Being able to see where everyone is grants some amazing control through the match.
---
hell even breaking chases is a great idea with him as it allows you to watch them from a distance to see if they have self care or not.  
---
I'm starting to also get attracted to the idea of using sloppy with him. Being able to keep survivors injured is very scary with Freddy as you transition them. Kind of puts pressure on them to keep healing themselves. 
---
I like using;
---
Discordance - Finds a group of survivors immediately &amp; builds fast momentum at the beginning of the match. Survivors like to work together on gens to quickly get a skill check to wake them up so works on that too.
---
M &amp; A - That 8m Reduction on terror radius is amazing for sneaking up on survivors. 16m of terror radius usually grants a free hit on an unexpecting survivor.
---
Ruin - Slows the game down so I can sleep as many people as I can in the beginning.
---
BBQ - Allows me to find survivors outside of my dream world. Works really well for pressuring really far gens. 
---
My only pet peeve with Freddy is that during the transition survivor actions go at normal speed. Allows for 7 seconds of normal speed breaking of totems or healing which is annoying. 
---
Worst part of Trapper is that you KNOW they're coming for an unhook, but can you place a trap in a tactical spot that they'd come or leave through? NAH, cos the person on hook just said "he placed a trap in the doorway just to my left, don't go that way!"
---
Yes. It works really well with overcharge &amp; causes the skill check to be almost impossible.
---
Remember guys, urban evasion is meta and the best perk ever /s
---
Anyone that knowingly goes to prey on less experienced or new players is a pussy.  
---
I'll be honest they talked about the concept of Flip Flop in a devstream around Clown or Spirit, and I've been waiting to have that since then.
---
Some kids can be smart for their age
---
Sandbagging is, afaik, preventing someone from moving in a certain way by blocking their path. For example staying at a pallet a chased survivor clearly wants to use so they get killed
---
Indeed, theres always a sneezing dog somewhere
---
Ok so first off, there is no anti tunnel god perk all of those perks just buy you time or an oppurtunity to get away from the killer or stealth away from them entirely
---
You see you can't just stop tunneling as its not actually any different from playing the game normally, you just focus on one person so there is no fix to this issue, its just part of the games design, I won't even call it a design flaw because its an inefficient tactic for the killer, and if you are a good survivor you can easily live for two to three gens while being chased (unless you burn through pallets and screw your team over)
---
My point still stands that if a killer is just tunneling and not actively camping then you have nothing to complain about besides your own misplay before you die, but I still think its beatable as a survivor just annoying, at least you have a chance, unlike with camping 
---
"I want to play the PlaaaaaaaaaaAAAAsh."

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/54578/ash-vs-evil-dead-in-dead-by-daylight#latest
---
well it does happen to me any time i play him. just dont know if what i suggested would fix it
---
I don't think so, but you never know. I think it might be a surprise.
---
Spirit or Legion, fun killers I like.
---
Why? He was close enough to pick her up.
---
I've been dcing to red pings only. I'm done with the lag. Impossible to hit with huntress. Idc about dcing in lobby. I get way way way more kills with mostly green pin. Sorry but my days of getting tea bagged are over all the sudden. Shocker..... 
---
There is no why, just cause.
---
If it had a female character would had wanted it lol
---
I'd say, good luck on their 4% :D Cause it's so rare I had it a couple of times in several years 
---
Psychological gameplay can be cool. Such as intentionally not looking behind yourself when approaching a window or pallet, trying to trick the killer into thinking you are blindly committed to vaulting/dropping - then not doing so.
---
It can also be uncool, like teabagging a killer or hitting a survivor on hook, trying to to get an emotional response out of the player - to get them to make mistakes, due to it.
---
The difference between what I consider "cool" and "uncool" psychological gameplay is that the one is a cerebral play and expressly also interplays with the cerebral play of the other side, whereas the other type is a non-sensical play, aimed precisely at lessening the quality of gameplay by making players play more emotionally rather than cerebrally.
---
Obviously other opinions are possible, all the more because being able to emotionally control oneself can also be considered a skill, of course, but I personally dislike emotional mindgames, yet quite like those cerebral ones.
---
Ohhh that’s fucked, ignore me then I misunderstood. 
---
I don't think getting abused and looped for 5 gens as a killer could be considered fun.
---
The 2 others who got trapped freed themselves. The match would have been over if he had honing stone
---
Is it free?
---
I did that as wraith and the dwight I did it to I felt bad so I let him go
---
It was a 20% reduction in speed or 1/5 slower. It's not insignificant, but massive is an overstatement. 
---
You can still heal during chase with a brown medkit and botany knowledge. 
---
Exactly. Killers are complaining about gens popping to fast... but it’s because they proxy camp and don’t check gens. 
---
They do pop fast with swf, but what do you expect with them? Lol
---
Oh my God I watched this by accident last night.
---
What is his obsession with the term "little bitch"?
---
They round them for displaying on the screen. Pips are counted correctly
---
Nah I’m pretty sure Robbie’s in the Entity’s Realm as well
---
That hits home
---
Be ashamed of who you are 
---
That's literally impossible, I'm guessing you forgot to printscreen the scoreboard? Yeah that's what I thought. Anyways I did not expect -30 over such a random comment, autismo commentpolice strikes again.
---
It becomes an unfair curb stomp is the killer gets a 3 man with 1 or 2 gens done since the killer is more likely to find the hatch before survivors and the killer jams all the killer needs to do is patrol the closest gens to the hatch and wait for the survivor to do a gen not to mention the killer runs whispers and it becomes a 4 man
---
God, I love bringing a green Mori to a match. It's my anti-cunt punishment plan, my hammer of justice - use it well, and everyone's happy. Except the cunt in question, of course.
---
That could be said about a lot of the dlc content.
---
I think a lot of people will play Ash as he's a popular character. In fact I think you will see him a lot. But yeah there will be a few who just want to stick his perks on their existing characters that they have grown fond of.
---
Price is unknown, but no. Licenced DLC for DBD is never free.
---
If Leatherface is any indication, it'll be £3.99
---
9
---
Alternatively, substitute bloodhound in for BBQ. Lisa is short, so sometimes it helps to have a clear finger pointing to where they went.
---
So you think the pry time should be lessened then? 10 seconds does seem a little long. I was thinking more like 6-5 seconds to open hatch. A purple or pink key could also surpass the jam, and just open regularly.
---
Now sabotage it.
---
That's exactly why I bought her lol. As a survivor I was always like, "I HATE THE PIG. UUUGH!!" Until I played her, and understood her better.  Now, any time I'm up against a Pig, I think I have the advantage knowing her as well as I do. that's the cool thing about playing Killer+Survivor equally, and not just maining one side.
---
Yes, to the gen rush question. It happens. She doesnt have the map pressure Billy or Nurse have. Some people like Ruin, but I'm not one of those people. Probably because I get the worst fucking totems out in the middle of nowhere and it gets destroyed 3 seconds into the game. That's a wasted perk slot. The Plague's Corrupt Intervention though, is a little more reliable. 120 seconds of 3 blocked generators. I'd take that because its consistent every time. Pair that with Whispers so you can crouch to those blocked gens and see if survivors are camping them, waiting for Corrupt Intervention to go away. 
---
As for add ons, I like bag of gears, and video tape. 
---
No worries, dude! I was literally you 3 weeks ago, asking the same questions and got some great advice. Figured I'd pass it along. And then I just played, and played. I dumped probably 20+ hours into Pig the first week I bought her. And that may not seem like much, but it definitely is when you have a full time job, a house/chores and 7 dogs. Hahah, needless to say I had to take a break from DBD to catch up on life 😅
---
TydeTyme has a complete survivor and killer guide on YouTube, just look up “TydeTyme Survivor Guide” or “TydeTyme Killer Guide”. They are around 40 minutes each but they are pretty comprehensive in terms of things you need to know about the game. OhTofu also has a survivor perk guide which could be useful in learning which characters to level first.
---
I'd honestly buy it. Who wouldn't love to chase survivors with something that seem so adorable
---
Be honest, you bought it for DS
---
If he doesn't fucking say groovy when unhooked or stunning a Killer I'm going to fucking sue Behavior.
---
If you're a rank 1 why smurf? What fun could you possibly have against noobs?
---
If you don't like rank 1 wait times stop being rank 1
---
I cleansed myself. I don’t know, do the pools revert? I was there a while before I took the screenshot. 
---
Whatever the point is that apparently you can block someone in the pool and ruin their game. Who gives a shit if you think I was the one blocking.
---
Probably just for a trailer
---
If you go for balance and bps , the dead hard will be in the next bloodweb
---
We need a killer like this tho
---
Now a centaur killer would be really bad.
---
“People who play the game are whiney ass bitches.” Proceeds to make a video to whine and be a bitch.
---
considering how many billion tons of food we throw away per year in the west, while some 795 million people in this world are starving, having too much food due to inhumane (capitalistic) distribution of said food is a legit problem
---
but yeah, fuck the gommies
---
When the Nurse came out
---
3 blinks and full movement speed Z😭
---
God I love this map. I wish I got to see it more than once every 50 games
---
To be honest I would prefer to play with complete potato survivors at rank 1 then have to wait hours just to get a bunch on rank 1 survivors. 
---
The ranking system has not become an indicator of skill but just a method of alienating anyone outside the popular rank brackets of 5 to 10 from matchmaking.
---
New survivors cant find games until rank reset because of the matchmaking system. It's a bit better now I imagine since deranking is much more common. 
---
Red rank killers &amp; survivors are having a really hard time finding anyone to play with because of how restrictive ranking has become. 
---
They really need to remove this mad ranking system. 
---
I don’t want to smurf but it’s the only way I can find a game and anything is better than the same menu of just endless waiting. I can’t de-rank because I can’t find a game to do so that and I find it hard to stay out of rank 1 it’s so easy to get as killer. 
---
The web to balanced is broken too 
---
He is.
---
This happens to me a lot, unfortunately. I've also run in to lobbies full of identical survivors, which means (as I'm not going to look down mid-chase to see who I'm murdering) it can be hard to tell them apart.
---
Before the game starts, the ping is around 135ms which is still fine even until 220+ms. But when the game started, I found the killer standing idly for around a minute, then I noticed the game became laggy, I'm rubber-banding. And then the game became a lot worse when he's chasing me. I starting to teleport in front of him. Is there anything we can do to these shameless cheaters?
---
You really dont get my point....
---
Its stupid to put your twitch name as your Username, cause no one that sees that will actually watch your Stream (other survivors, Killer)
---
Wait... That's illegal
---
It's the worst when you actually get all the gens done but then you get downed and everyone leaves :^)
---
друг
---
He's from China, doubt he's lagswitching than simply having ping
---
Nah [this](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/GrandSmallBobwhite-size_restricted.gif) is the Ash we need. 
---
[Before the game started, the latency is around 135](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b7bhxf/is_reporting_really_works_im_still_encountering/ejqdzxd/).
---
Thanks for the comprehensive help!! is this fungoose youtube or twitch person?
---
You're trash. Camping tunneling Freddy lol I bet you never leave yellow ranks
---
He either means voice lines like custom grunts and screams, or lines that the character would say in the menu. I seriously doubt they're going to have a talking survivor in-game for a few reasons.
---
+ immersion - No other character speaks (Minus plague, but she speaks in an anacient tounge that sort of fits her style), Ash actually talking would just ruin the horror aspect of the game.
---
+ game-play advantage - Imagine this, You're crouched behind a tree or rock next to the gen you're working on, the killer checks your gen, sees no one and starts to leave, then out of the blue your character speaks and instantly reveals your location. Unless you're somehow able to control when and where Ash speaks it would be a major detriment to play as him.
---
Deathclaw OP
---
Except babies that get mad at memes that trash their ez-mode killer, lol.
---
Missed an opportunity to say "Coldwind Farm", come on man.
---
"larger rank disparity" ??? 
---
I was already going against rank 1 and 2 killers as a rank 13/14 (with other survivors normally around my rank all the way up to 17) because of how broken the matchmaking was. How much worse could it be ? All this is is a band aid. I'm not a developer but damn there has to be a better way to do this shit.
---
Absolutely. Who wouldn’t leave behind society to live in the woods. Sign me up.
---
So only 1 person needs to have prove thyself? If more than one person has it, it doesn't stack, right?
---
The only way to balance SWF is to remove it. Literally no other option. But that's never gonna happen.   
---
SWF is this game's dirty little secret - it keeps people coming back because playing with friends is fun, but why doesn't the end of match screen show who's in a group together? Because this game's not balanced around voice comms, and it would rather pretend like that doesn't exist, so players don't get even more mad.
---
And I agree that SWF matchmaking should be solved, but FFS, even the basic matchmaking system is fucked, I have no idea how BHVR would even begin solving this.   
---
Dota has separate ranks for solo and group play, I guess that'd be better than just taking an average of all ranks in a group (I'm assuming that's what DBD does). 
---
Bit of a rant, but a team of good survivors on comms is so much harder to go against than a team of very good survivors with no comms. It makes some perks useless (killer and survivor side). It limits the design possibilities of the game (RIP disguise killer). 
---
On one hand, I understand why people play SWF - not all groups are made up of toxic trashbags. But on the other, sometimes I just wish it'd go away.
---
im not sure how it is for u guys but as a red rank europeani get only red ping players in my lobby. And when i rarely have green pings the lobby never gets full, people just leave when nobody seems to join.
---
Yeah only one person needs it per generator. Doesn't stack.
---
It's not a very good one.
---
?????
---
This the most distracting font ever
---
Now, just wait for them to charge for voice lines 
---
What if
---
The killer closes the hatch and after a few seconds the hatch spawns somewhere else. 
---
Always took it as the anonymity helped them not feel as nervous. Could be wrong but that’s my head cannon
---
The latency before the game started is stable at around 135ms. And caught the killer stopped for a long period of time twice.
---
This looks amazing!! I really love your art style :) 
---
It got removed when the title had glitch in it
---
That perk has become a damn near necessity when trying to pip as killer. 
---
You finally hook that one survivor who has been infinite looping for 5 minutes. You either camp and watch nearly all the gens get done in less than a couple minutes, or you leave the hook and someone saves them *right* when they are out of your terror radius. 
---
But then the killer will just camp the hatch to cause a hatch standoff as usual, won't they? It wouldn't change anything but make things take longer.
---
Yeah if I ever eant to feel depressed and shitty DbD is my go-to.
---
You know, I hate to be that guy but there are times when recklessly and unsafely unhooking someone is the right choice even without having WGLF.
---
I hate to say it, but if I'm on my third hook already and you're on your first still, I'm unhooking you and hoping the Killer goes after you. Your butt can take it.
---
Wot
---
It happened to me too.. on ps4 
---
It's almost as if the bonus bloodpoints shouldn't be a perk by itself, and instead combined with borrowed time or we'll make it.
---
Way ahead of you, that started way before this post 
---
I didn't realize I messed it up until after I posted it 
---
I actually rather be a killer at higher ranks, after dumpstering green ranks I want purple and red ranks so I can get better.  Can’t get better at loops/ tracking if everyone’s neon coloured trying to be noob3 and fail 360 you... higher ranks usually lead to higher caliber players. Later in the reset it gets worse but ehhhh 
---
People that facecamp while playing as The Pig. I don't get it. They have stealth abilities, they can wander around the map looking for other survivors while I'm hooked, and in the event that I get unhooked, they have the means of finding me again and re-hooking me.
---
Spirit and to a point huntress 
---
I cannot disagree with you less. 
---
Okay! I can respect your opinion 
---
Instant down hatchets and ebony mori as individuals is broken af. 
---
Imagine them together
---
The game has been a pretty great success for nearly 3 years. Not sure what they would learn from this.
---
I'm buying it for Ash, I don't really care for his Perks.
---
Why do people hate it so much anyway? I’m almost always playing a survivor and the times it has gotten me I was far enough from the gates I would’ve died anyways.
---
.... or how about they just buff solo queues? 
---
Last Year: The Nightmare
---
Am I missing something? This isn’t even the first deabear ref I’ve seen here..??
---
that'd actually be so nice. &lt;3
---
Yes, exactly! It's why Spirit is both considered a high skillcap killer and very fun to play - she's all about mindgames and psychological tactics. Getting into your opponent's head is the most fun you can have in DBD, IMO. 
---
Having to carry a work phone and a personal phone that are large consumes two pockets. Cote is wearing some tight jeans so it stands out. 
---
What I'll do is slug them and look for someone else.
---
It forces their teammates to stop doing generators to go heal them AND it takes them out of commission for a bit without killing them.
---
Just stare at the ground boys, stare at the ground.
---
Killer has a fatter hitbox, so it's completely understandable. But those traps are very suspicious in spots that the survivors aren't vacuumed to.
---
Ancient Babylonians = Rank 20 peepee heads lmao
---
I’m confused at what you’re trying to ask me, you don’t know what a Seabear is?
---
I'll usually down them and leave them on the ground. They'll still have one or two hooks left before they're dead, but it'll still force their teammates to go pick them back up instead of doing gens.
---
I just started playing Spirit yesterday. Can you give me any tips?
---
Yep - is it the spongebob thing? That’s all google has shown me
---
Idk. Just gonna have to wait and see.

Based on your profile name, you have to be a bait account.

Oh yeah ok, this is what's happening then. Thanks.

Damn it, this tickled me lol

Anyone ever had this before?

doesnt change the fact that "fixing" the game like described in the tweed will sooner or later destroy every game.

---
Wraith... I always get camped by PS4 Wraiths 
---
On Thursday I got a match where I was rank 13 survivor and the other three were two 12s and an 11. The killer was rank 2 Huntress. It SUCKED.
---
People hate anything that can just straight up one shot them. 
---
There's a lot of people that think the plague is broken because her puke can make you a 1 shot. There's a lot of people who hate Iridescent Huntress, because it's a 1 shot.
---
People never take into account what you've said-- and they especially never take into account that at most, it nets killers one extra kill, if they're lucky. If NoED goes off at all, usually the killer is already getting stomped, because most survivors cleanse totems. --I know, because I hear them do it with thrill of the hunt, and I see it when I'm playing. 
---
It really shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it is to some. That said, I prefer Devour Hope, because if I'm lucky, I can also mori them. &gt;:)
---
So why do killers sometime carry you to the hatch and let you escape?
---
Honestly man, that isn’t even that bad for my games recently. I’ve been a red rank killer playing against yellow and brown rank survivors who literally just bought the game
---
Slightly unrelated, but games should be balanced based on the highest tier of play, not by the playerbase as a whole. Any changes to make high tier more balanced will trickle down. If a pro can't abuse it, neither can a noob.
---
What? How? If anything the game become more unfriendly towards newcomers as time went on.
---
Doesn't solve the issue if there are four rank 1 in the SWF
---
The only way to even out the powerlevel between SWF and solo is to implement the following for all survivors:
---
- the last observed state of any interactable object is permanently revealed to all survivors. For example, if someone sees an armed trap somewhere then the trap becomes visible to all survivors through a global aura and stays visible even if the killer moves the trap, unless another survivors goes there and sees that the trap is gone. At that point the aura is erased. For the following: lockers, chests, traps, generators (progress, regression), totems, Plague vomit on objects, Jigsaw boxes, Plague pools
---
- the last observed killer position is revealed to all survivors, if a survivor keeps looking at the killer during a chase the killer aura stays revealed for the entire duration
---
- all survivor auras are revealed to each other always
---
- as soon as any survivor can reliable tell that a killer has a certain perk, that perk becomes revealed to all survivors (for example, once any survivor is hit by Sloppy Butcher all survivors are told that the killer has Sloppy Butcher)
---
- all perks and their state (cooldowns, ...) of all survivors are always revealed to all survivors
---
- all status effects on all survivors are always revealed to all survivors
---
Does that sound ridiculous? SWF can give each other all of the information listed above and discuss more complex strategies that you can't plan out with the point and wave actions. So even if the entire list above were to be implemented into the game SWF groups would still have an advantage over solo survivors.
---
Alternatively the devs could just add voice chat and then balance the game around every match having it.
---
I thought you were going to say "If someone face camps me in a game in like 'eh that was shitty' but if someone camps me in real life..."
---
I feel like the amount of charge you have in the bar should count for how many times Bubba swings.
---
And why do we suddenly need placeholders when we had to work without them for all this time they promised dedicated servers?
---
Why do they need to implement some random systems when they already promised dedicated servers for summer?
---
Why would it not make it into the live client?
---
With region locked queues, this game would be almost dead by now because you would have to wait for more than 15 minutes for a lobby. 
---
I actually loved that map because back when I first started playing dbd, all I'd get is autohaven wreckers and the MacMillan estate. Oh boy now it's the actual opposite 
---
I thought about this for a while before responding. At first consideration it sounds like a good idea, but I don't know if I necessarily agree with it. If they combined it with something else, everyone would run it. It'd be too good. If anything, it might be better to *nerf* it instead of combining it with something else. If they made it so the rescuing player were exposed for say... even 10 seconds, it might deter people from yanking their teammates off hooks for easy bloodpoints. Then any hook rescue after 4 no longer triggers the exposed status, because once they max out WGLF, they no longer have an incentive to put their team in unnecessary danger. The perk might actually benefit from a tradeoff like this. Because right now, the way it works lets you get easy bloodpoints for screwing over your team.

Than do another gen and open the exit gates

That didnt happened before 2.6...  The cool thing with this is if you combine that with the new point/ranking system, well you got yourself we call the TIME OF THE GREAT DEPIPRESSION
---
Guilty as charged, your honor.

is it bad i know where this screenshot is from
---
That sounds like it my God

I mean I agree but still I feel bad for the killer ya know?

If they're feeling frisky.

So basically like old DS, where you had to hope the person couldn't hit the skillcheck? No thanks. Actual counterplay, please.
---
By any chance were you playing plauge on springwood?
---
Because if that was you I genuinely apologize if anything we did in game frustrated you

BP cap is generally seen as strictly related to your ability to level new characters. It takes more than 1m BPs to get a character to level 50. When a new chapter is releasing, people like to save BPs and don’t want to spend on current characters, but the cap keeps them from saving more than 1m. 
---
OP is proposing a relatively small benefit that should only impact that situation, with the BP cap increase on Devotion. 
---
The true trick to good game design is to make it easy enough to get into but complex enough to show mastery of.  
---
u did it with plague when the achivement was broken, ive played like 20 more games and just cant anymore, and i still have clown to do :(
---
I have a half baked idea for survive with friends balance, why not make them pick one character each, and one tool each. MAYBE perks too. Again this is half baked so its probably terrible idea, but at least it would prevent four man groups and flashlights. 
---
Of course.
---
I've seen this sentiment on this sub, and I get the feeling that people repeat it without really thinking it over. Because by that logic, every single killer has a "luck factor", if they attempt any mindgames at all - because they can succeed or not. 
---
So, Spirit chases a player who's been running in a straight line. Because the survivor hasn't displayed any tricky movement, she haunts and follows the scratchmarks closely, comes out right behind him, and hits him. Was that luck?
---
Another scenario: survivor is chased by a Spirit, who has done fakeouts, moonwalks, and such. Spirit stops in the middle of a chase, and the survivor runs behind cover, waits a bit, and walks back on his tracks. Spirit comes out of her delayed haunt, has lost him. Was that luck?
---
What I'm saying is, the success of a mindgame is dependent on each side's reading of the other. Of course, if you do them mindlessly and randomly, then the results will be random as well. But if you put any thought into it, it becomes a skill that has direct impact on the outcome of a match. 
---
So no, I completely disagree with the second part of your post, which was surprising considering your first comment seemed in favour of mindgames and other related tactics.
---
Hey if i am going to use the red mori i am going to get the most of it
---
Balanced &gt; Dead Hard for 70% of the maps in the game. Therefore, BL&gt;DH
---
Yeah I gave up on ranking. I just want to have fun but can’t even do that now. 
---
LordOfIntroverts for president 2020!
---
thats a fight the devs cant win though and imo wasted effort. there will always be some ~~cool~~ toxic people that plebs try to copy. its like this in every single online game. there are many streamers that just got famous for being a dick and build there whole life around it. 
---
He's a twitch person. He has created some educational youtube videos showing how to make good killer builds or good survivor builds &amp; item add-on combinations.

Trapper needs rope traps near trees, so when you trigger one it hangs you upside down.

---
I was thinking as a killer but ngl that sounds like that could be a fun challenge 
---
Nothing will change if you just let it happen
---
yea it does, or they change it?!
---
It should fix itself if you restart the game.
---
And what happens if the group ranks are varied between the players?
---
It's hard to say how a killer ticks,is he paranoid and will stay close if he sees only 2 auras with BBQ and not think someone is hiding their aura and thus he camps? We don't know,so this comment doesn't give us much from their perspective friend.
---
Honey you got a big storm comin'

With or without?

Yeah  i see that, but obviously not everyone has the stomach and patients for that, so i am glad things turned they way they did and a pat on the back for you good sir/madam.
---
I guess yeah? It’s just the right thing to do in a debate.
---
So fuck the majority of the playerbase amirite?
---
Literally all games average player is the majority why should devs suck dick of 20 people?
---
That the guy that was acting edgy and his comment got deleted?
---
If you're late for school you're not going to mind a one-hour ban since you'll be at school for the next several hours and won't be able to play anyways. If you're going out with friends you won't mind a one hour ban since you'll be out with friends and won't be playing anyways. None of those excuses fly. To even get to an hour-long ban you would have had to have had to have DC'd once before within 72 hours (there's your 15 minute ban for a "I had to leave for a phone call" DC.) 
---
The only people that will have a big problem with such a time out is a serial rage-quitter who quit because he/she felt like it, and wanted to immediately come to have a chance to do it again to another player. If it was just a 5 minutes ban that's enough time to get the ban, search the internet for something or watch a youtube video then come right back in and DC again. It wouldn't do anything to curb it. An escalation policy where you are banned on a scale would suddenly stop all those "I didn't mean to DC/I had to do this or that" excuses pretty quick I bet.
---
Think they would have needed a lot of pools of devotion to solve the Babylonian crisis. Then again once they were all used they would reset I suppose.
---
I put way too much effort into this...
---
give that man a cookie 
---
Self care is already bad enough, I already get 3 Dwight’s selfcaring in a corner, I don’t need them doing it even slower
---
The devs have done enough in my opinion to protect new players by locking ranks 15-20. Once you get out of those ranks you can't derank back into them without a monthly rank reset and playing from rank 20-15 should be more than enough games in total to learn the basics and more.
---
So new folks are protected, somewhat. This should leave them free to balance the game around higher skill players. But then you have to ask, how high of skill is the balance point? Rank 10-5 sounds like a good place to focus for balance. Lower than that (11-20) is just to low and higher (4-1) is too high. Those people are just too far in the extreme either way in my opinion and shouldn't be a focus.
---
And you know what? Rank 5-10 isn't half bad balance wise.
---
I like both this game and F13, but my god do I hate some of the people on the reddit community there who always insist that DBD is hot trash and F13 is a million times better, ignoring the fact that DBD has a way bigger playerbase. 
---
I would argue that if you're running away injured on your death hook,dumping the killer on a healthy unbroken survivor is the better team play. Likewise, be a hero for anyone you encounter who is in the reverse scenario. You may risk getting abandoned on hook, but it encourages the other survivors to help themselves by helping you.
---
A great job fog dweller!
---
She probably wasnt in there long enough for it to activate 
---
Did they even touch mending or the bleedout mechanic in the last patch? If not, then how the hell?!
---
What a good guy.
---
r/letmetellyouhowtodoyourjob
---
To be fair, they could have launched the game with lowered graphics from the start until they can work on real optimization, but hey at least they did something for that.
---
PSA: Headon doesn't care at all about the Animation. The Killer has to stand in front of the Locker WHEN YOU PRESS SPACE.  I think the hitbox is 1.5m*2m (bigger then the locker), but I'm not 100% sure. 
---
If a Hillybilly rushes through, past your Locker, and you press space when he's in front of it, he'll get stunned. Even when he's 10m further away at that point.

Maybe they had 3 mori rituals stacked up.
---
Bridge the gap between swf and solo so we can balance the game accordingly.
---
Give survivors some tool to talk to each other. Not voice chat, but simple ways to say and communicate some strategies, perhaps even alerting what the killer is, what perks he s running, let's go cleanse totems etc. 
---
So then we can FINALLY buff killers without thinking "well solo survivors are gonna suffer".
---
From the information I’ve gathered it seems like the killer has to be within range when the locker exit animation starts. Then it doesn’t matter how far the killer gets, they will get stunned when the animation ends. Seems like the survivor exited the locker too soon.
---
Always has been. Had people laugh at me for saying that.
---
The only thing that comes to minds is, those people are so desperate for some positivity for the game they love they try to act it's doing better. I agree daily ranting gets old, but lying to yourself is even worse.
---
If you're scared of being put one the hook then like... go play something else? 
---
Yes entirely the same.
---
Only thing that differentiates between them is their skin and teachable perks.
---
High level players will have all survivors at level 40, meaning practically every survivor is the same, and the only thing that changes is what perks you start level 1 with, and the luck of the blood web
---
interesting... very interesting... 
---
Well people say that ace has a very quiet groaning noise if injured. And claudette is basically invisible so there's them 2
---
Are you talking about killer?
---
I’m on PS4, at like rank 15 survivor and it takes me 20-40 minutes to find a game.
---
Me and my friends did a 2v1 KYF so we could actually play :(
---
Definitely lag switch 
---
I have a friend that plays with me time to time,she's pretty much a veteran with 2k+ hours and barely plays anymore,mostly by my request.And whenever we play it's for fun but for the killer it's not,sadly.I guess we balance it out by fooling around the map but there's the rank 1 death squads that need adressing.
---
Yes Mr. Trap you are joke to me. I evil laugh as I disarm you, then very menacingly take my tool box to you for the ultimate fuck You and permanently disable you! Now that your a scrap price of iron they should just melt you down and add you to that metal thrown at Kings landing!

If you can't watch the movies, watch the kill counts on YouTube. Dead meat makes some great videos on them.
---
Awww awesome, who are you?!
---
Totally forgot about those ! It will probably take less than than watching the full series
---
Cool story bro, but did you live or die? I Need to know these things!
---
it feels like every game i get in green ranks is a swf or 4 tryhards with p3 so i can't do anything except camp because as soon as  i get my first hook even if I wasn't chasing the first guy all game the gates are open
---
The only way I would want Robbie Rotten in the game is if his normal walk is [this.](https://characterprofile.fandom.com/wiki/Robbie_Rotten?file=Robbie_render.png)
---
So then they play Claudette and no problem in that scenario 
---
What % of games, realistically, do you think you're facing a SWF?
---
Spongebob meme is universal. People really do be missing on a lot of memes if they've never watched spongebob

Yep, give it +%100/150/200 bp in the survival category or something damn

You would think so but from my understanding the games playerbase falls off between DLC and that is the repetitiveness of the gameplay which isn't for everyone and I'd guess due in some part to the bugs. Recently bug things like the ranking and match making are also driving people off I would bet.
---
My guess is not being a big company they need that cash infusion every 3 months with all the cosmetic trickle in between to keep going.
---
Not saying they don't fix bugs they do eventually, what it feels like to me is their team isn't big enough to bug test and bug fix and keep the pace for DLC they set. They need to slow the pace a bit or expand. They seem to have a lot on the go, apparently optimization, switch port, dlcs in progress, matchmaking, ranking reworks. Apparently reworking old content in there as well. Seems maybe they just put too much on the plate at once or suck at balancing what they need done.
---
You can just say MORI and it would still make sense. 
---
Who’s saying thanks to who?
---
I have this poster :)
---
When ebonys are more common than Ivory's, the rarity system needs a serious look. For nurse, 100% of her ultra rares are ebonys. Meanwhile, every time a new Map Offering gets released, other green offerings like BPS and Ivory Moris become rarer which is just flawed. 
---
To add, the rarity system shouldn't be an excuse to be able to add overpowered and unfun add-ons and offerings to the game. It's a terrible balance mechanism. 
---
If you haven't, youtube search it its worth a watch

Then we can move over to a communist market and then there will be no food to waste

It’s bad sportsmanship combined with the anonymity of the internet. This is pretty typical in online games. I’m not saying this to justify what they are doing, but worrying about these type of shitty trolls is pointless because they will never go away. Believe me I empathize.

Trying to defend yourself to them is pointless because it’s just feeding the trolls. You’d be better off arguing with a wall. Just ignore them.

---
I think its just the pressure honestly, I can hit overcharge skillchecks just fine but my nerves are thrown off when im being picked up because i just lost the chase
---
Imagine having honing stone
---
They only revert if the Killer let all the pools become corrupted. So yeah it is possible.
---
Mmm
---
Ash lying there all seductive *shivers*
---
they buffed them they either come back in 30 seconds or 2 minutes I forgotten 
---
^(speaking of that I should go back to trapper  I finally got save the best for last)
---
Yeah instant lobbies must be so bad huh.
---
I cant stand this map so obviously i get it wvery other match
---
I'm also in the green ranks-purple ranks. Sometimes it's a 4k, because people hook dive. Other times it's a 1k, or less because I happen to chase their good runner. It's almost always a SWF, as I check the lobbies afterwards. 
---
Serious games are always one or the other for me. There's no in-between. 
---
Like, even if you're good at closing the gap, and getting hits, it always feels like the survivors are in control at these ranks. I get kills more when it's not SWF, obviously, and I wish there was a way to balance this, not because I'm sore about losing, but because SWF are always the ones to accuse you of something you didn't do, or trash talk you. 
---
9/10 times, I will walk out that gate if someone is hooked, especially if NOED was not confirmed yet or if the survivor is in the basement. I'd rather a guaranteed 5,000 than 1,500 and possible death. 
---
when I do that I make it up to them by body block the killer 
---
Oh thank god I'm not the only one to remember that game
---
Just playing the objective

Is it ok if they also have borrowed time

What’s wrong with classic memes?

It’s dead, it’s done, it had its time. If you like it, Leave it to rest. Otherwise it will only become a bad meme, so leave it be and have fond memories 
---
I leave immediately after saying GG WP so  i dont get called trash when all I can do is camp. I get tilted pretty fast so I dodge as many SWFs as I can or people I know are tryhards. I only play games for fun.
---
It's either SWFs, tryhards, or randos who just want to play the game and get dcrs or a duo or 3 man who kill themselves because I'm legion or don't even try.
---
I try not to 4k (especially if there's a ttv that's actually streaming) because it feels bad killing all of them
---
Dr. Faced 4 in a row an hour ago. Survived 1 of em, so I got that going for me, which is nice.
---
That coming from the guy who spoiled the Chapter 11 killer back in October, maybe he's actually telling the truth.
---
This is why I never used ds even before it’s rework. Even if you miss it it’s gone forever and you have now just have 3 perks. Fuck that.

First up, three hours is a heavy exaggeration. MOST console players that I’ve seen talking about this haven’t been waiting more than 10-15 minutes, pc is right around the same area atm, at least for me.

How original and creative 
---
Ohhhh. Didn’t notice that. Well report them for being a total schmuck then. 
---
It's true though, I myself was a noob and really bad at this game like I'm sure most people were at some point. It's all about getting more experienced as the more you play. The issue is people that try dbd for the first time shouldn't judge the game by how hard of a time they're having or any game for that matter the first thing that anyone starting a new game should take into account is whether they find it enjoyable or not, the experience will come in due time. It's good to help new players along the way but we shouldn't baby them. What would be nice is to rework the tutorial section entirely. I feel it's almost useless, they can for example teach newcomers how to hit ruin skill checks and for killer's how to learn the tiles and play efficiently.
---
so what if the survivors just solo que an invite the other 3 people survivors will still look for a way around it
---
I don't ency their job of trying to balance matchnaking. The games player base isn't the biggest out there, also its spread out globally. Player base can also fluctuate depending on time of day, it also needs people to play both killer and survivor.
---
So some people for reasons I don't know experience long queue times when others in their region at the same time doesn't.
---
But what I've seen lately is they seem to have tossed out region or relaxed it and a lot of us had fast queue times but all matches with bad ping.
---
They also seem to relaxed matching between ranks but everyone complained that made unfair circumstances and it did, skilled players finding matches too easy and the reverse for unskilled.
---
So they revert back and now we all have long queue times again.
---
I'm hoping with dedicated servers they can relax matching between regions but not rank and we will have low ping lobbies and faster queue times. I don't ever expect constantly instant queue times it will never happen. But if they could get it to max 5 minutes between matches that would be great.
---
Hopefully they can attract and retain more players which will help too.
---
It's absolutely not a heavy exaggeration at all. In fact, I streamed it live last night. 3 hours and 40 minutes went by before we said fuck it and found a random from the ps4 community to play kyf with because the match making IS that bad. Sit down if you think anyone exaggerates about console queue times.
---
Yeah I'm not sure what he means. Pig doesn't have any intrinsic way of finding people she loses. Unless he means finding them at jigsaw boxes? But that should only ever be incidental, you shouldn't be going for them.
---
I've had dedicated friends that loved the game and played daily quit the game entirely over the survivor queues.  I feel your pain brother.  
---
The way I see it, if you have to hatch camp, you're an asshole. Just let them go. 
---
I don’t think anyone’s exaggerating, I know they are. Just simmer down and finish your denial, talk to you after your dinner.
---
the outfit looks great and your art style is really cool too!
---
Looks like a crappy chicken sandwich. 
---
MYC + BBQ is a godsend. 
---
People understandably feel strongly about SWF. Perhaps it would be helpful to do some QOL improvements for the killer / deterrents for the survivors that don't directly impact the actual course of the game?
---
* A display indicator for the Killer in the lobby whenever survivors are grouped together, allows killers to queue dodge those pesky 4 man queues?
---
* Decreased BP gain for survivors that scales with the size of party (or increase BP gain for Killer to play against them, as per u/HavelBro_Logan 's suggestion)
---
* Queue preference for smaller survivor parties (lobbies search for single survivors, then more, then more, etc). Even slight annoyances like that for those troll groups may result in the average game for the killer seeing improvements. However, this of course shouldn't result in exceptionally long queue times for groups that just want to play with each other, as that would damage the player base, so there would need to be a time limit where their priority would increase.
---
On to ways that would actually impact gameplay, here are a few of my personal thoughts.
---
* Rework flashlights. Repeated blinding of the killer should be less and less effective, and I mean a gooooood deal less effective. I get their value in helping save a teammate, but if they're getting downed multiple times and needing to be saved multiple times in a minute, there should be more punishment for that.
---
* Killers need more perk variety to help lengthen the game and keep the gen tempo down. I like the new Plague killer perk... buuut I would like to see it either buffed or reworked; I'd prefer it reworked, as I feel game mechanics that force people to... not play.. don't contribute as much as they take away. Basically, Ruin shouldn't be a nigh mando perk for killers who want to avoid the gen rush.
---
Two final notes, killers, y'all shouldn't be expecting to get the 4k every game, get over it, survivors aren't OP. It's an asymmetrical experience, and there will be ups and downs. And survivors, the killers want to win, too! Don't be expecting to crush every damn game. If they are running Nurses, Whispers, NOED, Ruin, BBQ, whatever, get over it. They are supposed to use the best tools at their disposal, just like you.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I have a hard time playing against Freddy even though everyone I know says he’s easy. 
---
Devs please read - this is a pick - up and put down game.  When I get home after work and want to play half an hour or an hour, I don't want to have to wait 5, 10 or 15 minutes to connect (I'm in North America).  I want to connect in less than a minute, play a couple of quick rounds and pip a couple of times and go.
---
The current state of the game makes it NO FUN to play, read that again, this needs to be FUN or players like myself will move on to another game.  I feel like you're trying to be all things to all people and you'll never achieve that - just keep it fast, fun, let people rank quickly and you'll have huge success!  
---
Please go back to the previous pip scoring system, this is a grind and not fut in any way. Please connect me to anyone on any continent, I don't care as long as we connect quickly.  Roll it back a couple of versions where everything was fun and you could connect quickly and rank relatively quickly and let's just have FUN!
---
I dont know why people get salty after game chat. There's no reason to. I'm usually a survivor due to playing with my husband majority of the time. If a killer kills me I crack jokes LOL. I just don't see a reason to get mad 🤷‍♀️.
---
I also feel like it's a bit expected for killers to camp their kill when generators are done. They're trying to get points too xD. 
---
Try to enjoy the game and ignore chat when people are being little shits. It's not worth losing fun because others want to take it from you. 
---
Looks amazing! Love your art style. :D
---
Idiotic reasoning at best
---
People will always get sick and eventually die so no point having healthcare.
---
Crimes will always exist so we should have 24/7 purge.
---
etc
---
This is too much IQ for me, Reported.
---
Lol this is a small reply but I 100% agree
---
Of course! I’ll section my tips (what works for me) but I’m on mobile rn so it may look bad
---
Vomit
---
-I won’t pick up the corruption unless I either know where a survivor is, or more than one survivor is either broken or injured
---
-Basic vomit is great for countering loops, if you vomit on them long enough they become broken and can be one shot (about 2 full charges should do) and if you vomit on pallets or other things the survivors will touch they’ll eventually become broken
---
-Her height gives you major advantage when being looped, every once in a while make sure you peak over some things, I find a lot of my targets that way
---
Hooks
---
-If you hook a sick survivor, you can very easily leave that spot entirely, because when they get unhooked, their savior gets sick, and either one of them will be broken when you find them, or you’ll have two corrupted fountains, best case scenario IMO is you get one while their broken and the other gives you a fountain corruption
---
-If a hooked survivor isn’t sick, a good strategy is to vomit on nearby objects (Gens, planks, lockers, etc.) and to give some distance, that way when an unhook happens, you can close in on them, and they might use one of your gross-ified objects, which will make them sick and give you one hell of an advantage
---
Perks
---
-Honestly, anything can work with her, I’ve only been able to use 2 perks for the majority of my time and they don’t change a lot, Plague feels like she was designed to work well with and without perks, so you can make about any build you want with her
---
If you have any more questions, I’ll try to respond but I’m not in an area with good connection so I may be a while to respond!
---
if there's a ttv or they don't tbag or loop me all game or dont dc when i slug to try to get the 4k i'll let whoever is alive live and also if 1 dcs less than a minute into the game. If the person is my friend they get to die and more likely to die if I brought a mori.
---
I have a friend who is a ttv and he's nice. He only talks shit when he's extremely mad at a game, which is a 0.1% chance basically. He's one of the rare ttvs who don't complain when killer does something he doesn't like and doesn't dc unless someone's exploiting a bug. who was that streamer that you followed anyways??
---
I also play for fun and when I'm Nea I play to be toxic to the killer while trying to stop being a bitch in post game chat and stopping the problem I have with dcing
---
No worries I just felt chatty.
---
Even worse when you've got a trap on. 
---
I died.
---
Excessive flashlight clicking. The best way to scream that you’re an immature player. 
---
sorry that I got confused I'm not smart
---
Cause I don't trust you to find it on your own. Survivor also can't run off and hide if they get dropped on the hatch.
---
God I wish more survivors were like you. My favorite thing is when people make a joke, or point out something funny/spooky that happened in the game. :( 
---
Sometimes if people have a silly name, I'll make a joke about it. 
---
My favorite was someone named Hex: Devour Cheese, and I ACCIDENTALLY killed them, I was going to let them live.
---
I was like: "You could say I... Accidently Devoured cheese." and they were like: "You broke my heart!" I felt so bad, but it was so funny. 
---
I try not to let it get to me, but after I've played about 15 games, I get a bit angry when folks are like this!
---
I can get for a facecamper! But most of the time they don't know, they just stand in the exit until the killer find them, hit them and they escape
---
*Proceeds to face camp :)
---
-I mean, you obviously wanted his full attention. Why be passive aggressive that you got it?
---
Idc honestly I thought it was a good game, I got my chase and they got their kill so who cares 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Plague.  Not because there is anything at all wrong with the killer herself because there totally isn't, but my teamates are so fucking boosted against her each and every game.  For the love of god STOP FEEDING HER CORRUPTED PURGE!  Just repair the fucking gens.
---
It's all good
---
Thanks 👌
---
I didn’t mean to be passive aggressive ab it sorry😂it was fun 
---
Any chance the chainsaw is a cosmetic? Also did you see any of his other cosmetics?
---
It has become a really fun part of the game, Imo.
---
Getting good at looping the killer, and getting good at looping as killer. It's an area of the game we can show player skill. 
---
He’s technically not
---
I think the main point of handicapping yourself while playing is just out of compassion for the other players and the game itself, I’m not trying to kill everyone in the first minute, I want the enemies to have a chance, that’s what makes getting the 4K so much sweeter, being able to get all the survivors even after letting them get away from time to time
---
Atleast you can find games on PS4...
---
I believe the streamer was named Evosaintx, but I haven't watched them since I followed, but they seemed nice enough from our encounter, that I even checked out their stream, and they were nice throughout the match/and when I talked to them about our match. :)
---
It's kind of rare to see, and I commend your friend for also being a nice twitch streamer! I've never had the chance to encounter a friend while playing, but man I do encounter the same survivors over and over and I keep track of who is a butt, and who isn't. There's a reason I keep a pile of moris... and it's only for those people. &gt;:)
---
The game has never been easier for us man.  It's been buff after buff followed by survivor nerfs the past 7 months or so.  If you're still having this much trouble you need to change up your game.  Also maybe switch to survivor for a bit and play some chill games.  It's harder for them at this point but you get to focus on a lot less so maybe that's more your pace until you calm down.
---
If you’re gonna burn a mori, might as well get the most out of it. 
---
But it gets people healing longer with sloppy butcher so its good in my books.
---
Because this game is filled with scrubs who think if you do anything against them it's cheating.
---
They were swarming the hooks. The doors were opened. What the hell were you supposed to do, patrol generators that aren't even a factor in the game anymore?
---
Just ignore it and move on.
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
Deliverance is a perk to get yourself off the first stage of hook, not a way to bypass dying on the hook.
---
All I’m saying is this format isn’t good any more ok? It’s dead, it’s not funny, don’t beat a dead horse
---
Id run it with iron wglf prove and resilience if it gave 200
---
yeah, you’re right. just been WAY too tensed recently, so playing killer probably isnt a very good idea lol
---
It's easier to hit great skillcheck when killer has unnerving presence
---
Change my mind 
---
Please dont. Ima feel guilty, stay sober!
---
Im sure swf wont matter 
---
It could be 
---
I mean its still potentially 4 people running around for ruin getting no gens done instead of 2 it's a buff
---
Yeah but i wasnt on hook at all.
---
I think i saw different hands for him and he has a bunch of cosmetics. He’s probably one of the best if not the coolest survivor at this point. Had so much fun i went back and waited another hour in line to play again lol.
---
It could atleast give me the chance to use deliverance when i wasnt hooked at all
---
I can't wait for the Zach and Cody killers
---
Damn right it was.  Got some chicken in there, some peri peri, some cheese. It was a pretty good fajita. 
---
What don't you like about it?
---
Killer complaining about hitboxes, that’s new
---
I had a game where enemy nurse vs a jake who sandbagged were working together. Very fun /s
---
I always do this for folks who are screwed over by their team members D/Cing. It's a really crappy thing to do.
---
Love it. 💜
---
I just faced a full squad of Janes with flashlights and all were great loopers, I ended up killing 2 with 4 gens left and farmed with the other 2 because I had fun and I appreciate good survivors (they make the game fun for me) but I did have ruin and found the first guy in like first 10 seconds of the mach so I had good momentum from then.
---
Anyway, just get better, the game becomes much more fun.
---
You're asking people to explain to a joke to you, uh bro that's pretty cringe
---
So what's the problem here?
---
(apart from legion) I am really tired of going against hillbilly and nurse. they’re basically all you see now and it gets super boring.
---
If they aren’t being supportive, sandbagging, or just not being a team player that’s why. 
---
camping is the only toxic thing i encounter frequently. toxic SFW squads or even simple inconveniences such as someone doing a flashlight saves happens so rarely. one is not more toxic than the other, but at least in my experience, camping happens far more often
---
Imagine having the audacity to try and escape as a survivor. That is so toxic
---
He would say things that aren't nice if you're a snowflake but not like  "oh my god camping killer"
---
oh yeah forgot to tell ya
---
I got against a 4man yesterday with two streamers. They had Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Deadhard, and the last perk was their choice. THey hook rushed for BT as soon as I walked away. They complained when I used NOED even if I only killed one surv with it because they all had cancer  builds. Had to get off for a little after that because I was mad and I couldn't breathe as I get anxious playing killer against 4 mans and if they flame me it gets worse
---
No wonder I could care less about the survivors fun. They don't want me to have fun a lot of the time and when I try to make the game fun for them they get mad because "omg youre the worst killer ever get good you pos killer no one does as shit as you". If they make the game fun I'll gladly give them the escape. The toxic players are unfun ones are the ones I'll kill
---
Why? So the killer can instantly down you again?
---
Dude was just bad
---
He was my first down so I threw em on a hook. Than the idiot immediately tries all his escapes and than only struggled for like 15 seconds
---
Odd thing was he was the highest level in there (it was 15-13 and he was 12)
---
My fatass thought this was pastrami 😂😂😂
---
Might be because they’ve been absolutely useless during the game so he/she wants to expose them
---
uh. although rank doesn’t matter tbf, i’ve hit rank 1 every season since i started playing. i know what camping and tunneling is. someone in low ranks could know what it is too
---
nobody is more or less likely to get camped. no matter how far into the game i am, or whatever i’ve done through the game, the killer still camps me. lasting 30 secs or lasting 3 minutes hasn’t made any difference. i’ve had countless of games where i’ve gotten chased by the killer long enough for us to finish most gens and then i get camped and die on hook. i shouldn’t be punished for playing well
---
Guys he knows he wasbeing toxic that’s the point, just relax
---
Some like to take others down with them
---
He went down first and stayed on the hook for maybe 20-30 seconds (immediately used all escape attempts, only struggled for a little bit)
---
This guys delusional, the wait times aren’t great on console but three hours? 
---
The survivors that give me the most trouble just keep running and zigzagging. Never stop and camp a pallet. Multilevel structures or any place with branching paths will give you a chance. 
---
How is looping boring? Its the only way for killers and survivors to try and outplay each other.
---
Looks amazing, great work &lt;3 
---
Ironically I did kill em all, but his helping was more annoying than anything. I was busy chasing other people while he was messaging me this. I honestly felt bad for one of them as they wiggled free like 3 times (no hooks nearby) and they had a map
---
They even slipped off the hook too
---
he is pretty weak, but tons of freddys tunnel and camp and if your team don’t give up on you then he can get kills decently easily- especially if someone wastes tons of palettes trying to stun him during transition. 
---
Your comparisons don't work. People are evil so rather than try to make that impossible we just remove them from society and punish them.
---
We don't build bubbles for everyone to avoid germs, we develop medicines to treat them when they get them.
---
Safe spaces and trigger warnings are the real life equivalent to what he's discussing.
---
She* but yes thank you😂 first reasonable person 
---
Densha De D IIRC. There are even "racing" games (more like interractive novels) available on Steam with some bomb-ass eurobeat jams.
---
They also got sued by Bethesda. They probably don't have the best relationship.
---
If you get all of them I'll be so surprised. They like to take mine. :( 
---
If 4 people are running around actively looking for Ruin, instead of doing gens while keeping an eye out for Ruin, that's 4 people playing the game all wrong and you can't put the blame on the perk or its recent buff.
---
I’ve totally done this 🤣 
---
Thank you for the copypasta
---
But my point is that at Tier 1 you don't need to run around looking for it. At Tier 3 that's generally a bad idea anyway because you'll save more time just working through it.
---
But running around because of a Tier 1 Ruin? There's almost no scenario in which the time you save  by finding and cleansing ruin is more than the time it takes to just work a generator.
---
I can’t stand my teammates now so no
---
Just take the loss, I don’t care who.
---
Bad survivors will complain about camping when exit gates are powered. Most won't though, it should be expected if you've been playing for any decent amount of time.
---
Isn't the DS skill check bigger post nerf? I've really only missed it when its at the 4 o'clock position and I'm not paying attention.
---
Out of 10 games, 2 games feel like solos, 4 games feel 2- or 3-mans, 3 games feel like 4-mans and 1  game feels like the 4-man bully squad. On average, sometimes I get the bully squad 3 games in a row and drop a rank or two because of it.
---
Yeah I would guess so. Killer for me takes less than a minute, while survivor will take more than 20 minutes 
---
Haven't played in a while, what does those add-ons do?
---
I guess so. I really like her ability and design (but not her voice damn!). Getting her for her perks doesn't make any sense. Or you can wait for Fedora Clown rework, maybe he'll get playable. But i'd buy Spirit
---
Strong but situational af 
---
From what I understand is the trick to this is to not follow right on their tail, but back off some and run vertically across the horizontal corn rows. Much easier to see down the whole row.
---
How did it flop?
---
..?  It earned millions upon millions despite not being released and in early access.
---
Honestly it's healthy to strike a nice balance between killer and survivor anyways.  I'm a killer main but I still play a ton of survivor too.  Helps keeps you sane.  Easier games or not killer is still non-stop multitasking.  It's good to relax with some survivor games.
---
I mean is she fun and easy to play? I really like Hag and Pig so do you think her playstyle will suit me?
---
Personally, I start hard. If I see a survivor that is bad, I just lay off them, give them some breather, and make them feel like they are not wasting their time playing, if the survivors are good, well then you play good back. If you really can't find good survivors at your rank, get higher, and if survivors are still terrible at rank 1. Well... Do what I do. Cry to the devs that ranks are terrible, cause that's all we can do :) isn't dead by daylight a delightful game. 
---
I’m a relatively new killer and I can get 2 kills every game usually without question. As I’ve gotten better perks it’s only become easier. The best way to improve as Killer is to be a survivor. I only played survivor for the first few months I played this game so knowing how to think like a survivor will get you easy kills.
---
False
---
By the way, Happy Cake Day!
---
Question, how would you say it in these contexts:
---
He was (MORI) everybody
---
He (MORI) everyone
---
He (MORI) me
---
He got (MORI)
---
So confusing 
---
Yea because I was so impressed with my yellow rank I figured I would let you all into my key to success. Im just a bad hook camper who's going to let everyone fix every generator while I camp one guy on a hook. 
---
Bein sarcastic btw did you even read past my second paragraph before you formed your oponion or did you just read the words "tunneling" and "hook camping" and completely ignore the rest? I said you want to camp and tunnel for easy kills but not be obsessed with it as your sole primary goal. But you probably got some honor system where you close your eyes and count to ten after hooking a survivor right? Or do you just leave them so you can go across the map trying to protect all 5 generators and hooking all 4 survivors 3 times? 
---
You want map control. Generators closeby at the end where the pallets are eaten up. I feel like blindly chasing survivors and generators without a plan just gets you pallet looped the whole match and makes endgame even worse for Freddy. But you know I guess I just need to "gid gud".
---
Problem with playing like a normal killer and striking at random as Freddy is you just are not taking advantage of his invisability and he is just not made to take on everybody at once all the time. You just won't clear the lobby as fast as other killers. People talk about sleep moding the whole lobby for control but it's pretty impossible to keep track of more than one guy at a time because it's really not hard to wake up if you give them any amount of time. And then you end up chasing the guy who wants to be the distraction while everybody else wakes up. 
---
You got anything to add or any strategies to talk about besides just "you're trash because tunneling" feel free to chime in.
---
They basically just wanted me to give them their friend, and get no kills. I'm not horribly bothered by it, but I do like sharing my experiences, Haha. 
---
Its been 1 hour and 20 min
---
I wouldn't necessarily call it weak. It's extremely popular for a reason.  
---
Even at high level, it does slow down gen progress to a *minimum* of 80 seconds per solo gen, which is plenty of time for the killer to find at least one immersed boi.
---
This makes me happy every time I watch it
---
See, I do like getting the extra hook, but it can be very risky! Especially if there's a potato with a flashlight. 
---
Freddy’s map, aka the elementary school map. 
---
Ohhhhh ok thank you. I never get this map lol
---
i like legion
---
A lot of words and you only focused on two of them. Clearly reading is not your thing. 
---
Exactly, it's a thing that kind of has to be done to secure the kill. Trust me, I'd chase those butts down if I could! I almost wish that hooks ticked down faster after the exit gates were open, but that'd get a lot of people angry. 
---
Honestly I feel the same. It makes me concentrate more on skillchecks.
---
I don't care to talk strategies with trash that thinks camping and tunneling is ever fun or a good strategy. Would be a waste of my time. 
---
Stay rank 15 where that shit works. Continue never pipping . Continue getting 15k bloodpoints as killer. Continue not getting better at chases. Stay golden hun.
---
Thank you! I’m on console and I almost always immediately get into a match (and the loading is faster too). Us console players finally have something better than the PC Patricians, which is nice lol
---
It's not spammy. :) You're sharing your art, and it's completely reasonable to link a gallery with it.
---
Well let me know when they add in a Robert version I will gladly switch over to the "real" Freddy lol don't be sad. 
---
[Cold Dirt](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Cold_Dirt) \- Considerably decreases the cooldown (Fatigue time) of Feral Frenzy.
---
[Frank's Mix Tape](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Frank%27s_Mix_Tape) \- Considerably increases the amount of damage applied to a survivor's deep wound timer while attacking in Feral Frenzy. (Downing takes less frenzy hits.)
---
&gt;I like that he is always invisible. I think the most effective way to use Freddy is to cause the illusion that you are in control and after everyone when you are mostly tunneling one target and even hook camping half the time
---
"Well, she stopped moving on the other side of that pallet. Guess I'll..."
---
*immediately poops all over self*
---
She moves quicker and has no terror radius. So that leaves people on gens vulnerable to her dash
---
If SWF was to be removed, this game's community would probably tremendously drop. In my case, I never play survivor solo, I always play with a friend, and I don't think killer gameplay alone would be enough to continue playing in the future. Killer as it is, in my opinion, is very boring, having a friend along to play with is what brought me to enjoy this game. 
---
Orrrrrrr...maybe you can only get so good after a certain amount of hours and diminishing returns mean that you'll stop getting better relative to your competition at some point.
---
I looked at the thread and this seems to be a really minor change that's being blown out of proportion. 
---
Honestly?
---
The only realy change i can see is the hook and gen auras are more transparent. 
---
I'm stuck at survivor rank 9-8 since two weeks. i've an average 15K base BP per games…
---
Depends on killer ur playing but the corn for me is hardest with the hag freddy legion or piggy 
---
I think it’s funny, there’s nothing sadder than meme hipsters 
---
Out in the open easy to dodge sure, but some them is some grass in the middle of nowhere and SNAP!!!!
---
I literally yelled “YES!” when I read the old system came back.  I was sitting in Hollister and now people think I’m weird.  New system was broken.
---
Stunning!! I love how much contrast is in this painting, really stellar work!
---
lmaooo nice.I would’ve seen that then go back to make some more
---
Making every progress bar in the game take longer isn’t the same as challenging survivors. 
---
I understand some frustration but sometimes as killer you lose, it’s inevitable. If you’re losing every match you might want to reevaluate your own gameplay and see if there are mistakes you’re making that you can improve on. 
---
wait how
---
Happy cake day, by the way.
---
lmaoooo that would make me enjoy the fajita even more
---
I’d actually love for ash to say some stupid line, alerting the killer I’m there and then having to run but that’s probably just me........
---
How can I stay mad at that face
---
Quick question- lore wise, how do mories affect the entity? It feeds on hope, but getting moried is kind of a helpless situation. Is it just treated like skipping straight to a sacrifice? Or is it the killers taking matters into their own hands?
---
This is definitely not a staged survive with your friends video
---
This is the same argument as "laws to stop bad things doesn't stop criminals, they break the laws to begin with, that's why they're criminals!" This suggests there shouldn't be ANY form of separation based on skill/time played in the community. And that's just straight wrong.
---
No system can ever have a perfect one. But it's important to have attempts.
---
well usually if I didnt get anyone killed by the end of the match I just let the ppl go instead of camping the last one.. depends on the situation and my mood tho. If they are toxic = camp. If they are nice, I let them go or farm..
---
sooo, what happened?
---
I had to think about it the path and honestly I would have skipped Bloodhound and Surveillance if I had to! :D  
---
[https://ibb.co/N9kcgfJ](https://ibb.co/N9kcgfJ)
---
I think people that use DS most commonly do it a lot, and thus are pretty used to hitting it, and find it easy, whereas if you're more new to the perk(Which a lot of people probably are, since it got changed), it's a lot more difficult. I've had plenty of people miss it at lower ranks(Before the ranking and DS change), but at higher ranks, I had to eat one every other game(Sometimes multiple)
---
2 kills is pretty much a loss, albeit not a bad loss. 3 or 4 is a win.
---
It's for I'd you want to play legion like the other killers (the wrong way)
---
Pretty much. Smh
---
And you just know the NOED is on deck for post gen saves
---
I'm so glad they die. Some are unfunny(Because they're funny because xd it's a meme haha), and them not overstaying their welcome helps keep things a little bit fresh, at least
---
Exactly. You are mostly tunneling and camping buuut if it's all you obsess over they will get wind of it real fast. My whole point is that Feddy lets you do other things nearby while you camp/tunnel compared to other killers because nobody can see you to track you and because you got your victim on radar so you can let him go for ten seconds and actually find him again. They are playing the guessing game at your mercy when trying to figure if you are still around to unhook the poor bastards. 
---
It's about controling a section of the map while bullying your target. Multi tasking. Try your best to "herd" the target to keep him around your favorite generators. Freddy is a hell of a tracker so you can do a lot of things most killers can't without loosing total site of your victim.
---
 I didn't design the character I am just anaylzing what he seems to be good at. I've yet to hear about these "alternative strategies" you are suppose to use as Freddy and how his powers help him with them. Because I don't think they really do and that is why most rank 1 snobs consider him to be the worst. 
---
Go do the gen, if they follow and hit you, run back to the hatch
---
You are extremely inexperienced if you think this.  She's full health and it's a Legion.  If she was to head away from the hatch what's the danger?  If he was stupid enough to pursue and hit you, you could simply use that sprint burst from hit to beat him back to the hatch and jump in.  If he doesn't follow you then you are free to take out the remaining dulls to prevent NOED and repair the final gen.  This isn't a Leatherface or Billy dude.  He has no way to down her from healthy state in 1 shot.  She is in zero danger in this scenario.
---
I love her voice so much
---
Im not rank 15, I am good at chases, I usually kill 3-4 players on average and I am not your "hun". You got anything like facts to talk about or are you just going to keep making things up. Because you sound to me like a real asshole and I'm thinking you are actually the one not worth the time to discuss anything with. Keep that head of yours up your ass and have fun baby. Probly gonna stop looking back here since you don't seem to have anything intelligent to say. 
---
Probably the best way to describe the plague lmao
---
If she leaves, he can hit her and bodyblock the hatch or wait until she gets too far for the speed boost to bring her back. If she tries to take the hatch he can grab her and hook her. Yes she's technically safe but that's bc the legion knows that he wins as long as he doesn't make the first move. 
---
The perspective of the shot was lost on me I thought entrance back to school was behind her not in front of her.  I assumed dude was whining about reporting the hatch standoff itself which you cannot do.  If she is truly body blocked and trapped in a room that's definitely reportable and bannable.
---
Right, so, decided to try something different for Day 50. I'm kind of iffy on the turn out, but these things turn out better over time. Depending on how this is received by you fine internet people decides whether or not I put effort into continuation. 
---
No hard feelings if you guys think this is bad though, constructive criticism is always helpful
---
[Discord](https://discord.gg/aBz4aC7)
---
Bro this is not related to the post at all
---
Genuine question, why should the killer let him go? Does responsibility not equally fall on the survivor for not letting the killer grab him? Neither party wants to lose

I'm glad this story had a happy ending.

The only people that you'll annoy are people who have no understanding of just how important it is that an artist is credited for their work, or people that are jealous. &lt;3
---
When you get down to lower ranks at like 8 and below he's a chore to use. You pretty much have to play somewhat tryhard to win. 
---
Jane says "Oh Damn" after getting hit, and after reading the comments I seen someone say that Bill says "Why?" when wiggling on the killers back.
---
There's only one gen left to do and everyone else got Mori'd. That dude already won. This Meg knew what she was doing. 
---
Let her go
---
Not really because I can't think of any other perks that are a balance problem outside of this one.
---
In fact, I want the new Decisive Strike buffed. Considering it's meant to stop tunneling off the hook, it doesn't accomplish it very well only because if a killer hits you right off the hook, they're more likely to then also go after the person that unhooked you. So the timer should be extended or something. Or maybe even make it so if you're downed within the 60 second period, you'll get the skill-check as soon as you're picked up. So make downing the requirement, not being picked up. Not sure.
---
while I agree you shouldnt restrict a player's way to play, but I think its more like a fair trade, you get communication, but you all have to use different things 
---
You genuinely think Balanced Landing on places like Haddonfield is okay?
---
No running in the lobby...
---
This may have been true a year ago or even 6 months ago but is not anymore.
---
Either of the chainsaws. I get them so frequently and I hate the one hit down. 
---
It's so hard when I try to be me uoooh!
---
The comparison was any other game with a ranked system, versus DBD. DBD is balanced around having 3 hooks per survivor(Or less if the survivors don't save, which isn't the killer's fault anyways, and at that point, they're probably doing gens, which at least gets something done), as well as 4 survivors. If you take one out early, it disrupts the balance completely, which if you're going to have a ranked system, is completely ridiculous. It becomes the equivalent of taking out another player of a game, severely handicapping them
---
Git gud
---
I've done it many times and still won.
---
But regardless what I meant was more "constantly going after someone" rather than taking advantage of a bad unhook.
---
YESSSSS it’s the funniest shit cuz it looks so comical
---
Get a survivor to follow you. Start the match with a flashlight or firecracker, give it to them, tell them to follow, do gens, and when killer comes evade as best you can and have them save you when you get down. Bring tenacity and resilience
---
Hope survivors are competent
---
Yea but not everyone wants to sit through the gen regressing since it gets annoying so people are more likely to run around the map and depending on what perks you run/rng blessing you it can slow it down a lot
---
It's Myers for me, because survivor mains buy the DLC for Laurie and DS so because I'm hardstuck rank 15 survivor I keep getting the creeper
---
Wkuk &lt;3
---
It's like a gift for the killer I believe. For example trapper did a good job sacrificing survivors so he's allowed to kill once or twice for his own satisfaction
---
No you don’t understand the situation. There is a wall behind Meg. A dead end. And the legion is body blocking the only way out. She is stuck and unable to decide to go do gens unless the killer hits her so they lose collision, or if they move. 
---
Fake Gameplay the survivors freed themselves in less than 5 minutes
---
Any time someone hatch camps I just do the rest of the gens, the. I have three exits
---
nobody:
---
Moried Survivor:
---
In order to do anything you need to get survivors into the dream state, and they can get out of it very easily. Making his ability basically useless except to stop you from being as effective as you could be if you didn’t have to deal with that bs.
---
The problem with dead hard is most people use it because they have it in first chase and get a 2 second chase extension at best. Once the killer knows you have it, you generally don’t get away with making them miss again. Save the dead hard for when you need to get to that pallet or window to keep the chase going. Not just because it’s there. (Don’t get me started on deliverance)
---
Gotta do everything...
---
he was mori'ing everyone      
---
he mori'd everyone      
---
he mori'd me     
---
i got mori'd
---
In my experience better to play stealth and try to escape the chase rather then juking around. (Also do not Run in straight line , try to break line if sights as much as you can.)
---
And do not use the fountain if you not really need to. 
---
Same for people who use mouse and keyboard on console. It’s not big of a deal in DBD, but in games like R6S, M&amp;K is a helluva lot better than a controller. 
---
There was nothing he could’ve done there! How can bhvr allow this bs? Survivors needs a nerf! and make noed a built-in perk please.
---
That's all I could hear when I was designing the second last panel, lol
---
If I recall correctly, the Entity compells the killers to give it sacrifices. However, if a killer offers the Memento Mori, then it will essentially grant the killer the ability to kill at its' leisure, like throwing a dog a bone.
---
Michael Myers is an exception, as not only did he willingly go to the Entity's realm (unlike most of the other killers), but he can act independently of the Entity's influence with the Tombstone.
---
Not to my knowledge? Every map has at least one elevated area, be it a hill or a building. Or at least has a CHANCE of a hill.
---
I love the contrast from the beautiful priestess and the results of her devotion! Thanks for sharing this art. 
---
Im so fucking angry at myself because i used my shards to buy her and plag instead of  waiting for ash
---
I have to completely disagree based on the map.
---
Which?
---
It’s not minor when you’re actually playing the game, believe me. I’m glad it’s not an issue you’re experiencing but it’s extremely frustrating for those of us that have to deal with it. It’s bad enough that I’ve stopped playing killer. 
---
I've replied several times now saying my perspective of the room was off and I thought the entrance back to school was behind her.  I thought people were just being pussies and threatening to report a hatch standoff itself.
---
Also no reason to he a dick about it dude. 
---
If they remove it they are condemned
---
If they keep it they are damned
---
I WILL ESCAPE NOW FROM THIS WORLD
---
FROM THE WORLD OF SWF SQUADDETTES
---
P3 FREDDY IS NOTHING NOW
---
ANOTHER BLOODWEB MUST BEEEEGIIIIIIIIIN
---
Is ash not going to be free? Wasnt Bill free?
---
On higher level you will get out played and at the end of the match they will start to t bag you.
---
And you will be called a bad killer if you don't kill anyone with freddy.
---
It hurts your confidence man :'(
---
I know macmillan, certain billy map i dong know which
---
Theres a bit of a bump in the Killer learning curve where you're good enough to face skilled survivors but not good enough to do well against them. It's the most frustrating part of playing killer but it will pass in time.
---
im not the developers - I dont know why they decided to do this only now, just what may be a few months before dedicated servers, instead of months ago - I personally think its a waste of time that they did it at all if they were just going to bring out servers.
---
oh worm :(((( 
---
well in that case then I’m determined to rank up and stab some rude ass survivors for Freddy mains everywhere 
---
Claudette stop picking flowers and help me the fuck up!
---
Your welcome friend (^.^)
---
That’s what you get for eating mid-match Honey Boo Boo!
---
That's why I don't try anymore. I got to the red ranks once upon a time but got tired of the sweat. I've learned to relax and have fun. I play all of one killer as seriously as possible (which usually ends in a 4K because I have two years' worth of skill with him) and that's about it. 
---
I shake it up and try all kinds of things. Different killers, Survivor, shaking up add-ons and perks all while leveling up my characters. I try to fully enjoy this game, and to get better. It sucks when people BM and insult you, but that's only reminiscent of how pathetic they likely are in their own lives so think nothing of it. 
---
TLDR: Playing Killer can be fun. It just takes a little perspective.
---
Groovy man🤙

---
We can all agree this game is heavily flawed still
---
Implying this kind of stuff is why survivors have gotten nerfed. No, all the broken mechanics did. Loops are still pretty much left untouched, only infinites were changed
---
Besides, playing survivor is also really useful because of the "know thine enemy" doctrine. 
---
ash will not be free. devs already confirmed 
---
Yeah. Fix infinite loops, hitboxes, balance perks and fix matchmaking
---
Then we can talk about SWF
---
&gt;sometimes they are in the same country
---
SWF confirmed!!! lmao 
---
Disagree, but I'd put it pretty close. Adrenaline takes the cake for me.
---
As soon as you reach like rank 10 probably all survivors will have selfcare and just miss the skill check and wake up.
---
Very, very interesting
---
That last piece of advice is pretty good. I spent like 3/4 of a match corrupted and just did gens while avoiding her. It's really good for the other survivors if she can't get vile purge
---
Could be that they'll change the perk entirely, and thus make it so that since all perk tiers give the same most relevant bonus, they can change it accordingly
---
No, im just basing my judgement on the pictures, i havent noticed the changes but they affect everyone. 
---
 I really want to see a dev respond to this, About the Infinite loading. I have seen so many thread on the forums and steam forums and here talking about it. I launched a match 34 time today. got to play only 22. stuck in loading the rest of the time. 
---
Given any new objective by way of killer/event theres always a few dedicated asshats seeing if collision allows a block like this. I think the pig boxes were this way at first too or at least needed some fidgeting for the right escape angle till they changed it, hopefully they could touch up the fountains too. 
---
I remember on one of Cote's streams he said the team toyed with the idea of Naughty Bear as a killer in DBD but they decided against it because it looked too goofy.
---
so you're just using a term incorrectly, gen rushing means completing gens fast, nothing more, nothing less. it is a reasonable critique, but its NOT A CRITIQUE ON THE SURVIVORS, unlike what you think, its a critique on balance and the flow of the game.
---
Depends on what you want. If you want a good killer then I would recommend the spirit. Shes high tier &amp; can allow for very strong mindgames on survivors. She has good map pressure &amp; can use her phasing to chase down survivors. She has a high skill cap though.
---
Legion is a pretty bad killer. His power is really weak at killing survivors &amp; doesnt really do much for him. Combined with 110% movement speed he has a hard time downing a survivor.
---
Cannibal is basically hillbilly with an easy to use chainsaw. Just imagine any M1 killer but with the ability to instantly down people. I personally like him as hes a very simple killer that synergises really well with most perks.
---
Perk wise the cannibal is the best. All his perks are really good.
---
BBQ is one of the best perks in the game. The extra bp gain also really helps you gain bp very fast to reduce the games grind.
---
Franklins is fun to use against survivors that all use tool boxes. Its really fun seeing survivors panic as they lose their instant heal medkit. 
---
Knock-out is a good perk for wasting survivor time by slugging a survivor. Outside of slugging its pretty useless.
---
Spirits perks are good but not as good as cannibal. 
---
Haunted grounds can be really good if activated while chasing a survivor. Also good if combined with other hex perks.
---
Spirit fury combos really well with enduring which can allow for a free hit during a chase.
---
Rancor is good for tracking survivors after every gen &amp; can allow you to eliminate your obsession as soon as the match finishes. Great synergy with perks that force you to not hurt your obsession.
---
Legion perks range from good to bad.
---
Discordance is a great perk. Allows you to find multiple survivors at once &amp; can kick start a match.
---
Iron Maiden is very bad. Most survivors dont enter a locker &amp; if they do then only having 20 seconds of exposed is not enough to capitalise on it.
---
Mad grit is only good for body blocking survivors. Its usually not that good unless under specific circumstances.
---
Overall I would suggest cannibal because his perks are so good &amp; he is very good for making builds with. Also amazing for basement builds. 
---
But then again if you want to actually have fun with a killers power &amp; learn the skill to its full potential then I would suggest spirit.
---
I think that's it likely, thank you.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Don't even bring to mind what it was like after the Halloween DLC first came out.
---
Short answer? Everyone had it. Picking anyone up would immediately result in that Brutal 5 second stun because the quality of the perk didn't rely on whether or not someone was the Obsession. 
---
I think you're just new at the game. It's actually been really boring playing as killer. They need to add loops or something. Not infinites, but at least more stuff for mind game potential or just chases in general. More pallets on certain maps would be better, too. Also, thana was never good, and still isn't good, so I wouldn't use that perk. Anyway, cheers.
---
no he isnt lol
---
gates???
---
“Shit negro that’s all you had to say”
---
I'll more than likely message them where it is tbh, stand offs suck but trying to find one survivor takes forever.
---
Joined 34 lobby and got to play only 22. stuck in loading the rest of the time. 
---
Gotta pay for licensed characters somehow 🤷‍♂️
---
The problem lies in the potential power of survivors. They need to make it so the killer is the power role, and not the survivors. In order to win a killer has to rely on survivors making mistakes. Which is fucking stupid
---
I think that would be a great reward in fact. Similar to maxing all stacks of BBQ is a good way to prepare for a low bp game, having more reward for an expected harder game is a great idea. 
---
Does nothing to the SWF squads but it does provide killers an incentive to go against them instead of dodging the lobby.
---
Not really. It’s more to a stalemate
---
Straight up?
---
These are the killers that scream how survivors are op. 
---
Y'know something? This might actually be the worst damn Legion hate-post I've ever seen. Congrats. 
---
Could it be because you're secretly legion? 
---
I ran Into a SWF group during my "let's practice Spirit" all nighter. As soon as I realized what was going on I just swapped to Nurse and 4k'd their team. They were very salty. 
---
You don't need to remove/nerf SWF. Just buff solo q
---
I would face legion against nurse any day, any time.
---
I think he needs a few minor buffs but ultimately he is a good killer, as good as the rest of em (except nurse and possibly spirit since theyre on another level). You can do well at any rank if you know how to play him
---
imagine looping the killer around a hooked survivor, just.. smh
---
He should at least hive Meg a chance to leave the room instead of taking the game hostage for almost 2 hours
---
Well , bye. 
---
Yes, what rockman said. If you're running straight with the corn, it'll be much harder to see a survivor. If you really can't find them, back up. If that doesn't work, look down at scratch marks, but you should see them if you take a step back.
---
what the fuck does "camping gens" even mean??? isnt that the objective of the killer?
---
You do realize that Bloodlust wasn't a thing at the launch of the game  but killers complained about being unable to break loops?
---
Blame the ranking system, not matchmaking.
---
Pig crouching actually moves slower than survivors
---
They designed the new matchmaking system with the new piping system in mind is my theory. 
---
they expected people to be deranking massively so set a matchmaking system that would allow a more diverse set of ranks. 
---
Now that they have removed the new matchmaking as a knee jerk reaction while leaving their horrible ranking system, ranks outside of the median rank bracket are now suffering terribly. 
---
They have managed to not only screw up the matchmaking but also made one of the biggest issues this game is currently facing, deliberate depiping, more of an issue. Classic BHVR
---
Would be nice to have him for free especially after a lot of people have bought every DLC so far.
---
Atleast it isn’t old decisive...
---
People playing a game = sweaty now I guess.
---
I mean it has very few practical uses but its like diversion, we knew itd be a meme perk immediately and its only a legitimately good play after several probably failed attempts. The most "Wow you made it work" thing i've seen someone do was while looting a basement chest, m&amp;a myers comes down with a jake and a jane I didnt even fucking know was there pops out of the left locker past the stairs to save the guy. He still died but hey, A for effort
---
I was way off. I immediately thought it was Booker from BioShock.
---
How original /s
---
Are you serious? You were being a pretentious ass when you thought you were right
---
Stay injured do gens loop the bitch. Ez clap 
---
No, hes really stuck in a corner.
---
Yeah very true. I think a lot of people also think he will be free as bill was free. (I'm on PS4 so not sure)
---
I'll support the game in anyway I can as after the amount of hours I've put into the game it's easy been worth every penny.
---
Wow thank you for this titillating piece of how you like Jane's fat ass.
---
oops I knew this and wrote it wrong, I fixed it thanks
---
Claudette, I don't care how much you want to be immersed, your getting on that hook, and your getting MORIED. I NEED THE HATCH!
---
Pews. My dumbness is intensifying. 
---
NOT GOOD ENOUGH
---
According to Behavior, at least
---
This is a licensed DLC so Behaviour could not release Ash for free without the permission of the owners of the Evil Dead franchise. The last free DLC we got was the Huntress, and on consoles the Hag and Doctor. I doubt we will ever see any more free DLC. 
---
impressive argument
---
I'm fine with spirit until Prayer beads are involved. Then it becomes unfun.
---
Those weren't loops, those were infinites, which could quite literally last forever, which was why those mechanics were implemented, not because pallet loops exist. The only argument you could make is that they removed double pallets, but that was extremely broken, and the loop itself was left untouched(No shorter, still a pallet at the end)
---
I play killer, and my point still stands. I have fun when the survivors have fun.
---
To be fair, a lot of things have gotten considerably better. 
---
The Hag. My soul is forcibly removed from my body whenever I trigger a trap. 
---
I’m not sure if it’s just a mental block or something but when playing survivor if there’s ruin, I don’t even look for it because I’m confident I’ll hit a good 90-95% of my greats, but for some reason whenever I try to run d strike I just end up looking like an idiot because I can’t hit it and then I just get sad and don’t even wiggle lmao 
---
wtf was he doing? This is what I think of everytime reddit killers complain about survivors
---
You're just as responsible. Leave the game.
---
&gt;Loops are still pretty much left untouched
---
What about removing the pallet vacuum, and changing the spawn location and number of pallets? Also what about how window vault speed is calculated to make it easier to fast vault when rounding corners? Do these things not count as changing loops? 
---
 
---
Last Year is dead? Oh shit. I was thinking about getting it, too. It looked pretty fun when it came out.
---
me only at the times I absolutely need to use it
---
I just don't see it. Flashlights are useless if you know how to play against them, adrenaline requires 5 gens done to even activate (and if you're carrying someone, you can drop them and instantly down them again because they'll come out of the dying state and thus wasting their adrenaline), urban evasion isnt even that good in terms of time effeciency and getting gens done asap, dead hard can be baited, balanced landing was the only perk that you mentioned that is objectively powerful. The only necessary perk a killer needs is bbq, not even for the aura reading, but more so to make bank every match. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need ruin if you're playing a killer you're good at. Thanatophobia was probably reverted because it was as powerful as dying light despite the fact that keeping people injured is easier than having to kill someone because a lot of gens can be done before you even kill obsession while thanatophobia just required someone to be injured and could technically slow the game at the beginning of the match, which caused a massive snowball effect because it also slows healing making it harder to heal and blah blah blah. Survivors have had their toys nerfed over and over (bnp shouldn't be ultra rare at this point, ds is useless, flashlights are almost useless since the faster pick up speed of 3 seconds made it harder to flashlight save, they were thinking of nerfing instaheals, etc) not saying that some of the stuff shouldnt have been nerfed, but their utility has been destroyed, while killers still have their strong shit that almost hasn't been tinkered with at all/enough, nothing the survivors have in their arsenal at this current time compares to what some killers have imo (ebony mori, instadown hatchets, prayer beads, Frank's mixtape, etc). And the reason you think survivors are more toxic than killers is because it's a 1:4 ratio. You go against 1 killer per match, but you go against 4 survivors per match, which means the chance of you running into someone toxic when youre playing killer is higher than you running into a toxic killer. Point is, killers have been getting treated quite nicely by the devs and if you're complaining about "it's hard to kill" it may not be for you.
---
Do you also not run Ruin on killer then?
---
Not trying to be a douche just asking out of curiosity 
---
Had a wraith who still tunneled and camped when someone DCed and two people used streamers. And he didnt realize that the person he camped had kindred so everyone knew he was camping.
---
They also disarm my traps :( 
---
You were. You just immediately went to Hook 2. Before it gives you time to react to it you get killed.
---
I hate this map, its nothing be super safe loops, and a super safe building in the center survivors run to when in trouble. its survivor sided.
---
Could've sworn they made changes to a bunch of places on different maps like "shortened the length of the wall" etc to make these loops less effective
---
As a spirit main:
---
#*YES*
---
I actually bought it a few days ago. Couldn’t really find a good lobby which confirms what my friends said about the game.
---
I wouldn’t really say it’s hopeless though. The upcoming steam release might increase the player count but no one really knows when it’ll come out.
---
Bill was free so people just assumed the other solo survivor would be free. Since survivors are just skins and bring 3 perks its different than asking for Leatherface to be free. 
---
Point at them.
---
on console there is a lot more killer variety, so not really.
---
Yes bought a new one and my game got so much better
---
Aren't you insulting yourself? Or is that sarcasm
---
That’s a little bit different, but for the most part no I don’t run any hex perks. I do occasionally use Devour Hope with the clown, and sometimes Lullaby with other killers. 
---
as someone who plays spirit, its all about footsteps, that's how you pinpoint survivors, iron will isnt much
---
Doesn't look bigger, and if the Killer has Enduring you're gonna get hit 2 seconds later anyway.
---
Devs too scared to make survivor perks good 
---
Whenever someone dcs it’s either a nea or a feng
---
This is a classic
---
sounds like a stupid strategy 
---
Well there were actually rank 1 survivors before (I was one of them). This new ranking system is complete dog shit.
---
Yeah i've noticed that 
---
Yep, can also confirm. Dunno if they broke that too, but after the latest patch if killers dc you may *actually* lose a pip
---
leatherface also wasnt/isnt free
---
I didn't say anybody liked Legion, I made this my flair back when the Legion was announced and there was hype, but have been too lazy to change it.
---
&gt;Is this Portuguese?
---
Says in the title, Brazilian Portuguese. 
---
Why is this so funny to me
---
"tHaT bReAkS tHe BlOoDPoInT EcOnOmY" in all seriousness, I'd like to go against prayer beads and crackhead nurse as little as possible thx. just give everyone potential to use a mic with each other.
---
Same. When I SWF, we die way more often than when I solo, because my altruism is like quadrupled. And we're far more willing to do really toxic saves just to fuck friends over for laughs.
---
You dont deserve that. 
---
I'm just going to start downvoting posts like this now because most are bored trolls and I see way too many of them. 
---
&gt;I’ve only played 2 games with him, one a 3k and another a 2k + a 2 DC. I’m only rank 18 as killer
---
Rank 18 is basically like playing nuketown offline shooting at the mannequins. Read any of the hundreds of posts on this subreddit about why Freddy is low tier. For what it's worth I like using Freddy and think he's a lot better than certain people think, but he's definitely a low tier killer at present. 
---
Yeah, I've just been too lazy to change my flair since they were announced.
---
Not only are there really good Survivor perks, but you have to remember that if any Survivor Perk is too good then you run into it four times as a killer.
---
Imagine running into four Hex: Ruins, that's why Survivor perks are typically weaker than Killer perks.
---
Leatherface is a killer with a unique power, Bill is just a skin.
---
shes not that different from normal killers, you counter her the same way you counter anyone else
---
Maybe bad internet? Ky router crapped out twice last night and it said i disconnected but it just lost power. 
---
What video?
---
The hag has hex devour hope, which can be broken but works with hooking survivors so it can be seen as being more of a devout follower of the entity. The spirit on the other hand is obsession based perk being rancor so I think you could see it as a personal grudge that the entity just allows the spirit to kill them, like John wick being a killer and a survivor killing his dog
---
well I guess you found the pure anti spirit build
---
He stole your item ahaha
---
that's a pretty low average tho 
---
“Classic”
---
I love how noobies killers has to find a new perk to cry about after a nerf 
---
It's still going, windows won't let him close the game. He is trapped forever.
---
The only reason he's saying that is because as a fortnite streamer he will end up only playing high level players and losing way more and looking less impressive. Ranked has existed in a lot of games just fine and allowed new players to learn mechanics without people with 2000 hours killing them. People will smurf or whatever but it won't be every single person you play. 
---
Personally, Sprint burst to me is more powerful when it's in its best state on Meg, or Lithe on Feng. 
---
Valve really likes Left 4 Dead cross-promotions across Steam. It's likely they just allowed them to use Bill for a Paragraph, though he still wasn't allowed any customizations.
---
Leatherface's Paragraph didn't go through the same process because he's from a cinematic franchise owned by a completely unrelated corporation, much like the Halloween, Saw, and Nightmare Chapters.
---
This upcoming Evil Dead Paragraph follows the same licensing fee blockade as the Leatherface Paragraph. Unlike the previous chapters, customization privileges were granted.
---
There just aren't any R1 survivors to fill the lobbies.
---
You can drop your item between you and hatch, hold shift and spam pick up item button, if done right it can move killer and you’ll be able to take hatch. 
---
Got hate mail yesterday from a survivor because I was chasing him around a dropped pallet or ‘bloodlusting’ nearby his only other surviving teammate who was on a hook. Why would I go break the pallet so he could unhook his teammate or escape me in the process? Nobody was on gens so I chased him around it till he made a mistake. Survivor mains always find reasons to cry when they lose even when you’re not playing particularly unfairly.

I dont think so. Its weird because i get bloodpoints and my item every time the killer DCs
---
Idk honestly, ppl on reddit are a lot more rude than ppl on Instagram but thank you ❤️
---
Earlier a team of survivors escaped me. However one of them reported my steam account because I was 'facecamping'. Even thought the entire game I was away from hooks, I literally gave them an easy win. It feels like survivors like that just look for reasons to be mad just to shit on me. Which is unfortunate.
---
No actually I was respectful and acknowledged I misread the photo wrong on 4 comments now.  You were just being an ignorant piece of scum.
---
What were the words I used a little while ago? "Entitled to a safe genrush"... 
---
And oh, my god, do Survivors never seem to comprehend our grievances as killers. They're unable to empathize or even understand that when people decide to play Killer they do not have to be generous, or hell, they're actually people. They make no conscious effort to understand because Killer is unquestionably more difficult and complex than Survivor. It's not like us killers always have a chance to succeed, nor can we just start playing. We have to work our way into the groove and be at our very best. 
---
Beyond that, The devs barely react and a lot of our requests are straight up backlogged. This game is far from as bad as it was, but to me they clearly didn't design this game with the word "Asymmetrical" in mind despite what the supposed genre defines. 
---
Cacetaralho....4040%? Isso sim é um buff garai
---
Killers are going to be able to hear them tits and cheeks clapping. 
---
&gt; beating the most dead of all horses
---
fuck off
---
That would be really cool tbh. I can just imagine going around whacking people With Lucille.
---
"Little pig, little pig. Let me in"
---
Honestly I think I’d use the last one the most
---
They even call it asymmetrical, but it's not where it needs to be to ensure that's actually the case.
---
And 3 perks
---
She's the 2nd or 3rd best killer in the game depending on who you ask. She's definitely difficult to play at a high level, but it's worth the effort. 
---
Do you know how I can fix it please? (Thank you for the info btw) 
---
Leatherface also has 3 perks. Whats your point

You da real MVP

---
I shamelessly stole this joke from someone else: "She needs to join the DC Universe."
---
GTA is good for passing time. I would NOT suggest Last Year, as it currently has a really low player base. F13 depends on what you play on, it has a few hundred players on PC while it has a somewhat big playerbase on PS4 and Xbox. I don't know anything about Garry's Mod and The Sims 3. 
---
That's cool, but there are a lot more maps that favor it.
---
That he's not "just a skin."
---
I was thinking that when getting facecamped that the timer slows down— it gives other survivors more time to get shit done and thus punish the killer more for it, but i guess it depends how you define facecamp with regards you how you would code this. 
---
Coldwind farm remembers 
---
Power move.

They're joking about how unlucky they are at untrapping themselves so it always takes forever.

---
Laughed pretty hard cause it's true.
---
Don't tell anyone. 
---
You absolutely took it to a condescending tone before I did.  You called me an inexperienced idiot then my replies changed.  
---
The killer has them trapped here
---
Really so insulting my understanding of the game when I pointed out that the Meg didn't have Sprint burst (which is what you said she had) isn't condescending? Nice try
---
In my opinion the highest rank in the group is what the killer's rank should be. It's just dumb having to play against several survivors who just have a lot more experience and the weaker ones who have communication to help them know what to do instead of running to open areas.
---
Idk, never taught about that..
---
I've seen a glitch where they cant interact with ANYTHING but never just generators what the hell
---
Video unavailable :(
---
I thought you were using the phrase to mean she is cornered figuratively in the situation as if she cannot dare leave the hatch because the killer will down her.  I didn't realize it was meant literally as a game breaking bodyblock because I'm used to seeing the hatch against the dead end side of the wall not the opening.  I genuinely thought the entrance back to school was behind her.  There are plenty of players that assume a hatch standoff is the only play in a situation like that so I thought you were looking at it like that.  I admitted respectfully multiple times I was wrong at this point.
---
Sure, but you can't really deny that it's unbalanced and makes matches more difficult and less fun for the other player. I agree that there's a lot of hyperbole over SWF, but there's just as much denial over its advantages. 
---
Killer mains, IQ minus 10. 
---
This is why they whine on forums about how haaaard it is to be killer. 
---
wow, so micheal myers entered the entitys realm and basically said “this is my house now”
---
Survivors/SWFers are downvoting everything in here. 
---
"she's in a corner". 
---
What is figurative about that. 
---
"I admitted respectfully multiple times I was wrong".
---
Not to me, the person who pointed out you were wrong first.
---
You shouldn't need a 4k every game to have fun. 
---
This post shows how bad you are 
---
Report him. He's holding the game hostage

Next on nerf-survivors-to-do-list: survivors should not be able to run.
---
Get a squad of Aces with up the ante with the big salt and BAM your luck goes up
---
My main problem with killer perks is the more stuff they add to delay the game the less stuff you can take for fun. I almost always go for things that slow the game down like the plague perk and ruin and by the time I got those I have so much less perks to work with.
---
While survivors get the benefits of so many perks if they just communicate on comms. 
---
Huh, context?
---
Omg I love it
---
And you shouldn't need to escape every match to have fun. 
---
Either make it a thing where if the killer stays 5 or 10 mins with moving from the same spot. The entity either stuns and pushes back the killer, or just disconnects them for being idle. Or remove collisions if they stand still for too long. 
---
"they genrushed me" :)
---
Make camping the hatch reportable. 
---
I've been on using discordance, pop goes the weasel, and surveillance. So far its worked out pretty well, I just need a fourth perk. Should I just use ruin or BBQ or go for enduring or something like that
---
reddit killers 
---
She's body blocked. She can't even get to the hatch bc of where Legion is placed. He's holding the game hostage bc of his entitlement
---
I don’t know, I play survivor and killer both pretty equally and I’m trying to win but also trying to have fun, I think camping and tunneling are both shitty to do and I feel like you get less blood points (plus give the survivors more time to gen rush) if you camp and tunneling especially sucks when you have other single queued survivors who are farming their fellow survivor. 
---
I played a game recently where I had a teammate farm me on the hook and the killer was tunneling so I died within a minute without getting to even really play the game. Plus when I play killer, it’ll depend on if the survivors are being toxic or not whether or not they get the hatch. 
---
We're talking generally now about hatch standoffs, at least you were in your OP. This killer is a bad example because he's trapping them in a corner and preventing then from doing anything. 
---
thats why there should be a time limit in this game. Its all dun and games till your stuck in a 30 min search fest for the last survivor. 
---
I’d play the fuck out of this.
---
Same as you actually. I'm a Huntress main, although I do play Trapper when I'm not feeling 100% (aka I keep missing all my hatchet throws)
---
That sounds like a you issue 
---
You must be a survivor main. If the gates are open, and they're hooked. It's mine.
---
He's comes out on April 2nd but okay
---
If you want to see a good huntress watch Zubat or Scott, not saying montos bad but just nowhere on the level of these two.
---
No, it's getting mad that you're playing with competitive advantages that make the match less fun for them. You *really* believe that they're upset that you have friends, instead of the fact that voice-comm undermines a bunch of perks and mechanics..?
---
Those are some pretty interesting perks, I like it.
---
It grants a good advantage sure, but I'd say a lot of that is due to knowing who your teammates are. Most of the complaints in solo come from survivors who are partnered with teammates who don't do anything all game and prioritize self-care over getting anything done.  
---
I'd say the only huge advantage SWF has is being able to say where things like hexes are if they are in a chase when they come across one, or being able to say where they are or if the killer is camping. But a lot of that can be inferred in solo just by running bond or paying attention to where people are congregating.
---
Its a definite advantage as opposed to playing solo, but nowhere near as unwinnable as people make it out to be. People suggesting handicaps or disadvantages to SWF groups don't know much about game design, as adding those things in would only drive a huge majority of the survivor playerbase away from the game
---
Yes, I’m sure the official BHVR announcement, actual gameplay footage, and Bruce Campbell video advertising the DLC coming out April 2nd, was all just an elaborate attempt to throw us off.
---
Unwritten rule number 4: If the gates are powered, ANYTHING GOES!
---
The survivors in this case have the choice, either escape and leave the hooked one to die, or risk dying themselves trying to rescue their ally. All courtesies and fair play get thrown out the window when all one side has to do to win is simply walk away. If the gates are powered, the survivors have already won and they know it, and if camping a hooked survivor at that point is really all you can do to ensure a kill, and no one can hold that against you. This is why Endgame perks like NOED, Blood Warden, Rancor, Remember Me, Adrenaline, Hope, No one Left Behind, Wake Up, etc exist. They give you an advantage when the gates are powered to either assist in killing or escaping since the gloves come off at that point in the game.
---
I don't get it. Can somebody explain to me what's going on in this post when ppl say that the hunter is keeping the game hostage? 
---
My preferred build is Ruin, Save The Best For Last, Stridor, and BBQ with Mother Daughter Ring and Bloody Hair Brooch add-ons. The way the build works is you hit the survivor once and have a super fast follow up because STBFL and the Mother Daughter Ring with reduced charge time. Stridor helps because you won't have new scratch marks to help you during phasing with the ring add-on.
---
You cannot change something because of the existence of SWF. That is a horrible reason to make things even harder for solo survivors.
---
People always see the hatch as a "free escape" but no one bothers questioning why killers feel entitled to an easy last kill (which is exactly what it is without the hatch)
---
I liked it. It's a little rough, but I'm sure you'll get the hang of it as time goes on.
---
First perk seems broken as fuck on certain structures e.g Ironworks window.
---
The second perk seems interesting, does it only trigger once? Is it only on you?
---
Third perk seems decent
---
You must be the killer who immediately disconnects after his sEcUReD KiLl is saved with BT :D
---
Exactly but it's hard to see that kinda small thing unless you are super focused 
---
If you want best sounding headphones with a good sound stage then studio headphones are where it's at. Something open back like the HD6XX from Massdrop.
---
That seems like the most common sense shorthand way to refer to the mechanic man.  Do you have a better alternative?  Again I read into your comment context that definitely wasn't there, you're right she was literally bodyblocked and trapped.  And you definitely misread the context of what I said because I clearly wasn't referring to the perk and I mentioned sprint burst as a direct reference to the hit they would attempt on her.
---
You are probably going to get downvoted
---
Fuck, man.
---
Howl all you want, old man, it won't bring him back.
---
But like what if the charater is real but hes not coming out till the next expasion ...
---
His point still stands. Trying to protect noobs from getting stomped will just ruin your game.
---
Imagine chasing a person for 3 gens without a down. 
---
Adrenaline is the best survivor perk, but I think I’d say BL is 2nd. It’s not OP, but like ppl mentioned, it can be broken on haddonfield
---
Didn't lots of people complain that pipping/moving up the ranks was too easy??
---
How do you know they're having fun?
---
I don't tunnel/camp because ranks are just beyond stupid and survivors still t-bag and taunt. 
---
Some players are just salty assholes who get mad at everything. 
---
Yeah the second perk is intended to only affect you. It doesn't sound too op imo so i dont see why it shouldn't be available all game.
---
And also they would have to make separate models for each character, character clothing, etc
---
Looks like another Perk has its description bugged.
---
...what?? 
---
:-/
---
Not just a glitch?
---
All of the chapters on the pre established roadmap are original characters containing both a survivor, killer and new map. Ash is coming out on his own as a bonus, if you will. They kept it under wraps until PAX and now we know we’re getting a happy surprise. So, he’s coming out the date they said, it’s not a joke or a conspiracy. Unless.....Illuminati killer confirmed o_O
---
You're missing the forest for the trees.
---
You can "protect noobs from getting bopped",  just because a smaller amount of people will circumvent your methods doesnt mean it's not effective.
---
Secondly dont bring that ridiculous safe space trigger warning bullshit here, this has nothing to do with "free speech".
---
Thirdly we do "build bubbles" for everyone to avoid germs, its called practicing hygiene and plays an essential role in keeping people healthy. Preventative healthcare is a thing and honestly if you can extrapolate that to your other beliefs you would learn a lot.
---
Depends on the range of the kick, and how it interacts with killers grabbing a survivor who is unhooking. The problem I see is there’s several cases where I ended up in standoffs at the hook, and if suddenly Dwight can kick me in the dick while I’m grabbing Claud it’s gonna make unhooks a lot easier than they should be 
---
It’s a good idea, just needs expanding upon 
---
Salty survivor mains is my guess. 
---
It's a competitive game. If they want me to ensure that *they* have fun, they can join one of the tabletop games I GM
---
It was definitely a buff. It was trash at level 1 and 2 because it didn't effect the 4th person.
---
I dont think it is a joke and it would be rood and a bad idea. But that doesnt stop me form worrying
---
i agree with everything but the derank thing, just puts these assholes against people who arent so familiar with the game 
---
Patricia also said in the live of Instagram that some of this merch will be avaible to purchase in the future.
---
I want those patches and skull sweater!
---
damn it Meg!
---
I don't think personal house rules are a bad thing per se though, as there are some things in the game that are basically bullshit for everyone.
---
My ruleset would be no DS, no NOED, no DCs, no BM (teabag/facecamp). I won't bother trying to talk anyone out of using / engaging in these things since it's entirely pointless (the last case implying the other guy is a piece of shit anyway), but these things are prime fun ruiners, so I won't use them and appreciate when others also don't...
---
Probably screaming at their screens and tryna get you to keep farm or someth

---
To explain: 
---
This game started, me and the Legacy Jake were on a Gen. Was going good! Then, the other Jake got hit, and he took off running, leaving me to my Gen. That's perfectly fine, I can handle a Gen by myself. 
---
However, he came back 10 seconds later with a nurse following him. Why he came back to me, I'll never know. The nurse and the other Jake were across the map-- he could have run anywhere. I end up getting downed after trying to get away from all this because the OTHER Jake joined us, and body blocked me at a pallet. :( 
---
Now, that's okay, he made a mistake, or at least I assumed it was one. She picks me up, and our other team mate, Laurie tries to flashlight, and fails, gets hit. So the Prestige Jake tries to body block the hook, gets hit. Then Laurie gets hit again-- she's down. Jake gets hit again, he's down. I wiggle free and take off to heal with a medkit. 
---
I fully heal, and watch as they take turns on the hook, I assume because the other Jake is there unhooking, I didn't have a visual. I notice nothing has happened for a bit, so I run over for the unhook while the nurse is chasing someone else. The Laurie gets downed, and stops struggling on the hook. She ded. 
---
Now, we only have one Gen done at this point. So, I go to finish off the Gen I was on at the start. I finish it as one of the Jakes is downed upstairs in the big house. We're on Coldwind Farm. 
---
So I run to the next Gen, but jump in a locker to protect from BBQ. At that point, I see the other Jake get downed. I wait a few seconds, and nothing. So I hop out and start working on a Gen, because honestly, she was probably camping them. More time passes, and she eventually picks one up. They end up struggling off before she can hook. She then picks the other up, same thing happens. Then, they both get downed again. My gen is about half-way at this point, and I'm just watching this play out in the distance. 
---
She eventually hooks one of the Jakes [ He ded. ], and comes after me. I have no choice but to lose her, and get the Jake up. I manage to get him up while she's not looking, and unfortunately, the Nurse shows up again. I run off to start on another Gen, because I DO want to live, and possibly save the Jake. 
---
Sadly, he goes down, and D/C's the moment he does. I don't see any movement from the Nurse, so I slowly creep up to see she's guarding the hatch, and, luckily got it as she hit me rather than waited it out. 
---
I just... How do people get to full prestige-- and FULL LEGACY prestige and still act like they're brand new to the game? I mean, granted, I was laughing my butt off almost the whole match, but guys?! Why?!
---
It’d because of the action in the background that distracts you. Sometimes the killer hits the wall or something and it’s distracting and throws you off. Old ds, anyway.
---
Farms* You try to proofread and something still ends up slipping through the cracks
---
Oh I'll insure that doesn't happen. I catch you farming other survivors they're getting free pallet slams, unhooks, chase wins, and generators after I murder you. Fuck survivors who sandbag their friends.
---
https://heroesofthestorm.fandom.com/wiki/Alexstrasza?file=Alexstrasa_image_1.png
---
No i play legion disguised as wraith
---
No. Unsafe unhooks are never okay unless the killer is camping, then it's a last ditch to save them.
---
Exactly. Which is why they often act like they have gen to go to even though if you've been to that area you know there isn't. But other survivors don't know that.  The killer is just circling the area like headless chicken.
---
No it’s not, and I do respect it. But it’s like an old war vet, you respect him, but you don’t send him out back to war to fight
---
I assume the person who got unhooked wants to get as far from that hook as possible, not realizing that if the Killer isn't that far away they will leave a trail right to them.
---
Legit, I can hit ruin skill checks like a mf, overcharge doesn't ever get the best of me and neither does unnerving. 
---
But, ask me to hit a great at any other time, and I might as well just yeet myself up on the hook.

Just off the top of my head. I'm not arguing that every SWF is some NAVY SEALS death squad, I'm just saying that part of the reason why there's not a lot of momentum for balancing or incentives is because the largest portion of their player base downplays the advantages, or strawmans critics with the line about friendship. Most people realize that it's mostly about playing with your friends and enjoying your night, and the benefits above are secondary. But that doesn't change anything, it's still an issue that needs to be addressed better. 
---
Leatherface should be higher. Nobody likes Insidious Leatherface in basement. Maybe even Doctor should be higher. With the right build, Doctor is up there with Nurse and Spirit at causing DCs.
---
The first one is more so the killer cant follow you as easily right?
---
If the killer offers a Mori offering, that is the Entity granting the killer the satisfaction of killing the survivors themselves. The perks are a bit different because the Entity is not necessarily happy that the killer "stole" the kill. That's why they do not reward the killer with bloodpoints like a sacrifice would. 
---
Rancor - The Spirits hatred and sense of vengeance lets her take the final kill for herself if the survivors get all the gens
---
Devour Hope - Hag feeds on the despair of her enemies until they become so hopeless she can kill them outright. Could also be seen as the Entity rewarding the Hag for doing so many hooks already. 
---
Myer's Tombstone - Myers has a special relationship with the Entity, asked to be brought there, and this is his reward. 
---
Actually, I never D/C because I know how much it sucks for all sides. If they actually manage to get someone after the gates are open, cool. But I'm going to make it hard for them. 
---
Seriously huge thanks for all of this. Played two games tonight and got over 10k bps in both. didnt survive tho :D the second game i might have but the killer chased me so long that the other finished gens 2 and 3 meanwhile and the killer decided to stare face-to-face me for 3mins as i was there in the hook..
---
Not when the killer you get is across the ocean. If BHVR can't even fix region issue, ping, and latency problems then theynshouldn't expect players to be able to do their task properly. And how long can you stay on that gen while ruin is on before the killer finds you? 
---
So it is a buff. 
---
How to kill a game instantly
---
who said this
---
He was right tho
---
A small tip for this situation as the doc: you can stay in treatment mode and keep tapping M1(/whatever console buttons are), you'll grab the survivor if they try to unhook.
---
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
---
Yeah this is me. I'm on my phone until I hear the match start. 
---
The game went down twice yesterday. My plague got reset.
---
Yeah some people I’ve noticed don’t understand that killers can be friendly sometimes. I have that problem especially with people near rank 20. 
---
300+ ping then .... 3-man game 
---
EVERY TIME 
---
More than half of those are changes to killers who were exceedingly weak. I dont see how it changes a ton nor do you make the case for WHY these changes caused "good communicating survivors will always win" to be a false statement.
---
There were only small changes to healing and healing was way too strong before. Pickup and hook animation changes are minimal and pallet spawns change nothing for nurse but only help other killers.
---
But please continue.
---
I've clipped killers that were miles away and I've missed it in killers face to face with the lockers. It's not worth it right now
---
Poor Dwight. He died out of fear. But really, this is always a sad situation when a survivor can't get the hint after their team abandons them. :(
---
This is really good! I’d definitely be a Rick main.
---
Honestly, why do you care so much what they type post game? Does that really affect your experience playing the game? Who gives a shit?
---
That sucks dude :/ hope you manage to get her up again i just decided to go through with all my  blood webs and haven't been getting the same as i was yesterday unfortunately, luckily i got a load out i like to play as but its still sucky
---
What’s that do
---
20 seconds is very generous! If I had 20 seconds I could’ve healed and at least had more of a chance to last more than a minute. I was never going to escape that round but for the wait time to find a lobby I wanted to last longer than that. 
---
it was my lack of loop skill and my teammates that got me killed and I can see why the killer took the opportunity to eliminate a player so I wasn’t upset at the killer but I was frustrated that I got killed so fast and that I couldn’t do anything about it.

If they only play killers once in a blue moon then yes.  But if they consistently do the dailies, they tend to be scarily good.
---
Message the devs on the support ticket, you’ll get bp added to your account
---
Yeah and to be fair, I'm still new to the game and was a rank 20 killer but I watched enough DBD and played a good bit of survivor beforehand to know this guy needed help. I just wish he understood how much I cared
---
Skill Check Zones are reduced by 40%/50%/60%, so you’re making it harder for the survivor to hit it
---
If the survivor crawls under a pallet and you get sunned, that’s careless but forgivable.  You were played.  But to walk yourself directly under a pallet?  That is  stupid and you have no one but yourself to blame when the obvious happens.  You played yourself.
---
Jane is not hot enough for that

Um I’m pretty sure it’s April 2nd.

I really just work through sickness and play stealthily. If you can loop and evade fairly well then she pretty much loses her ability because she cant get corrupt purge and is really forced to M1. Obviously doesnt work as well solo queuing.
---
It looks like that scene from Scary Movies where Ghostface got looped over this small little table in the kitchen by a girl.
---
Honestly, as a survivor in that situation I'd look for the killer as like a "how do you want to play this?" Cus I'm pretty damn sure I'm not getting out if they don't want me to
---
Because it's just observably false, especially in the example you provided.
---
I've gone up against many SWF 4 man groups and won, sometimes even 4ked. If you're going to say that "you only won because they were bad" then that's an insult to both my skill and the skill of those 4 man groups whom I can personally attest to them being at least decent.
---
This Anecdote is supported by the patch notes I provided, which again don't even inclue perk changes or changes that came before 2.0 such as flashlight nerfs.
---
It’s not the games fault there are more survivor mains than killer. Ratio is a lot higher than 4:1
---
thanks ill try x
---
That gaining charage after flash sounds like b.s. but it'll give people a reason to run lightborn so idk
---
Gotcha. But just in general, killers like nurse who don't have ultra rare add-ons will receive more ebonys than most other killers. Its not good design. 
---
He's the last guy alive and the killer has him trapped in a corner literally and he's afk on top of the hatch. He can't really do anything since the killer refuses to do anything to end the game
---
You're not wrong, it's a common complaint. While the ranking system, although everyone constantly complains about it, probably contributed to the game's longevity quite well, it's probably true that it does act as a catalysator for high amounts of ... that kind of stuff. I can't play this game for extended singular periods of time, it just gets more stressful than enjoyable after a while - every now and then though, it's fun.
---
Sadness of playing Doctor.
---
I have all killers. If you're playing for fun Freddy &gt; Pig &gt; Clown.
---
I like insta-sleep Freddy and class-photo Freddy. End game builds can be fun especially since they can't wake up. Freddy is the only killer I'd allow noed on.
---
Pig has Amandas letter which can be fun, jumpscares and whatnot. and Clown is pretty weak and unfun.
---
Thanks for the suggestions. Do you find Pig is more satisfying than playing Freddy? When i played some Myers I loved when a survivor clearly didn't notice me behind them - something about it just feels super fun. Serial killer behaviour? Maybe xD. 
---
Watch DamnNoHTML on YouTube. He's the reason I bought Spirit. 
---
I think really what stands out most is that none of them are even good runners/time wasters and most of their pallets are wasted. Just a mediocre squad, yet a little over 2 minutes in 3/5 gens done thru ruin.
---
My point is, tune that stuff out and your enjoyment will go up. Feeling like "why do I even bother" just because some people type mean stuff is totally avoidable if you just ignore it. 
---
Beautiful. Glad to see more pics if you have.
---
i love baby dwights theyre so cute
---
noed nurse gamer
---
Whew boy!
---
You tried to justify Bill being free because he is "just a skin." But he's not, he also unlocks 3 teachable perks. It was nice of them to give Bill for free, but it also makes sense to pay for a survivor because they give you 3 more perks. 
---
Oh yes, one bad Killer means all Killer Mains do this.
---
Let's throw all nuance of the discussion out just because it makes you feel better. Nevermind that it's pretty much accepted that Generators get done too fast which causes Killers to run Ruin, which causes Survivors to come bitch on the forums because of Hex Ruin, and whenever an actual discussion is attempted it's just "noob killer git gud lol".
---
Best one yet
---
I went and upvoted you all. It's sad that people can't take the truth.
---
When Flip flop comes out I’m going to do a build that is, Unbreakable/No mither, Tenacity, Flip flop, and a exhaustion. It will be great against sluggers and useless otherwise, I can’t wait.
---
Lol that's a great joke m8
---
I've made a thread on this, and commented on others about it. It sucks, a lot. Win or Lose, you're still the loser because they act this way. :(
---
this happened today and it was on me 😔
---
why does dwight look so cool here
---
SWF with voice comms (in a way to do what is basically cheating seeing as it isn't meant to be in the game) is a huge problem but there's no way to punish it.
---
If they use teamspeak, ventrilo, discord, etc there's no way to tell if they're using it to just chat with friends or to say where killer is, what's he's doing, where hexes are at, etc so you can't punish players who use it.
---
There should be a disadvantage for playing SWF (3, 4 man only) such as  skill check boxes are smaller, repair time longer, or 1 less perk, the SWF problem will definitely not be as ba
---
Is this an It’s Always Sunny meme? Cause I love it 
---
If you don't have them, I'd recommend picking up Freddy for the perks. Remember Me and Fire Up are both great for end-game builds, and Bloodwarden is great for the memes.
---
Personally though, the only killer of the group I enjoy is The Pig. The Stealth is great, but those RBTs help slow down the game so much you can actually get away with not running Ruin.
---
It is a translation bug by behavior xD. That huntress does not hack.
---
Yea I play alot more pig than I probably should. The traps are really good at slowing the game down a little once ruin is gone. 
---
Surveillance or discordance is good for knowing which gen to sneak up on
---
The skull smashing Mori would be pretty satisfying
---
Killers with integrity will typically go for the farmer in that scenario.  I don't need a toxic survivor to feed me my downs.
---
I can see Negan getting them on their knees saying a one liner and then smash the survivors skull until there's just a pile of head goop on the floor.
---
"Holy shit-- he's taking it like a champ!
---
Nah they never understand what you have to do to keep pressure up. Also coming from the other side they often follow the official survivors rule handbook too thoroughly and dont protect gens/hexes/hooks etc.
---
Some interesting ideas here, for real.
---
Oooooh... I want to make one of these for a killer. Lol
---
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
---
Yeah because you tunnel and camp like most piggies or there. 
---
no bare feet?
---
David praying for luck.
---
When you're in a chase you want to be taking corners as much as possible. With how the Plague has to slow down to charge her vomit and the somewhat slow travel speed of the vomit you can pretty easily avoid it with tight loops.
---
I'm into it.
---
If ya got ruin then clown if not pig
---
honestly since i started playing it seems like since killers complained about DS being too op the devs are too chicken shit to make any good survivor perks or make them part way decent.  
---
I can heal during chase with a syringe too, what does that have to do with self care?
---
Arguably my favorite matches in any game are with experienced players. My best memories of Batman Arkham Online are with people who were really good with a game. My most memorable moment of that was when my friend who was playing Batman managed to get a sneak takedown on another friend during the end game and was about to get gunned down when I dropped down as Robin and got that one as well. We did win that round but fuck was it not easy.
---
Tbh you aren't gonna win against good survivors without ruin unless you play like a god. By the time you find the first guy and down him that's 3 gens easily.
---
Well, it just kind of sucks because some of the end game chat can be really fun, and I've made friends through it! But sometimes it's just horrible! 
---
Like, I'm not super bothered, I just know all killers have been there, so I shared.
---
Yesterday I was in a 5 gen chase and escaped without being downed. I really don’t think I deserved a depip....
---
Tbf i don't know the ins and outs, especially new killers, and wouldn't have known this if you and others hadn't said it. Ill be taking this advice in future.
---
Hex: I’M NOT PLAYING WITH YOU ANYMORE 
---
Yeah, they were. They weren't the most skilled nurse, my team kind of handed them the win, but I appreciate that they were a good sport after the match.
---
god damn, that was quick
---
I never stated that BNP was balanced nor was the pallet vaccum. But the underlying implication of the original comment was that 'Survivors are OP' because "(If they are equally skilled) the survivor team will always win."
---
I was explaining that while they were OP in the past due to vaccum and BNP and etc... that those things have since been changed and many killers have recieved buffs while things like flashlights and healing times have been nerfed.
---
While I think that the patch notes are suitable evidence the points you made against them are fair. But on the other end neither have you provided any evidence at all showing that the underlying claim that was originally stated is true either.

Bruh

meg is cute n all but SEBBY my fave

The Gang goes to the Water Park

DAAAAAAAAMN!

I see this a lot sadly dicking around on my spare account. Usually after checking their profile I can safely assume they’re younger players. For whatever reason they go from scared af to just giving up and it’s always heartbreaking. I see quite a few low ranks that clue in pretty easy but also I’ve seen this sorta reaction from players rank 10 and lower. Its less about the rank unfortunately and just the player themselves (although more common the lower you go).    
---
    
---
On the upside, atleast you didn’t (I’m assuming anyways) get t-bagged wile trying to help them or had they survived gotten “get recked” msgs afterwards making it even more baffling.
---
I think the one less perk would be very helpful. They'd have to really decide what they want to bring in. 
---
I bet we'd see a lot less Balanced Landing + Quick and Quiet being run with a Haddonfield offering, because those perks really only work well together, and that would only leave them with one more perk, Haha.
---
( I don't really have anything against that setup, I just see it a loooot. )
---
I can definitely agree with this. I've met dozens, if not hundreds, of more toxic people than actual nice people. I'm not even talking about altrusitic survivors. I'm talking about people who don't teabag, flash light spam at every pallet, send trash talk spam, and or bully killers when they have a bad game.
---
Y’all don’t know the damn definition of a stalemate
---
Bill was a special offer from valve, that's part of the reason he's pc exclusive. When bhvr actually has to buy a license, they of course need to make the money back from it.
---
It's because most killers lag to get better hitmarkers.
---
I'm beginning to realize that you're overburdened with an abundance of schooling. 
---
If I tunnel and camp, how do I end every game as Killer with 4 stacks of BBQ?
---
It was offering some advice since you're desperate enough to report to hyperbole, I figured you needed all the help you can get as a survivor main. 
---
thanks i sent a ticket to them hopefully they can help me! 
---
They’ve tried this and sadly some players abused it by circling the hook forcing the killer to stay by it. 
---
Instead of saying "chapter" like usual, when we only get a survivor or only get a killer people sometimes refer to them as paragraphs.
---
Ladies and gentleman, exhibit A
---
Bill was a steam exclusive gift because dbd got popular or smth.
---
Ash is a single licenced survivor. Like how leatherface was a single licensed killer.
---
Buying ash gives you access to his character, and all his perks. So Ash also won't be just a skin. Of course you can wait until his perks appear in the shrine but given the fact that BBQ&amp;Chili has never appeared in the shrine before implies you might as well buy him if you really want the perks.
---
I tried in one reddit to argue that the player character in game wasn't useless. After I replied to his reply the dude calls me pathetic for knowing I wasn't going to convince him otherwise because of his posting language, but also tried to flip my argument on me. Like seriously I hate arguing on the internet, and in general.
---
ooo such Gay!
---
Yeah this is really the only way to do it. Concede that people were always going to use Discord and it was silly to balance your game around the lack of voice-comm, and re-balance accordingly. 
---
Myers and newer ones, like Plague, Legion and maybe Leatherface. I want some fun abilities, not just walking up and downing survs
---
Really? Maybe it just seems faster to me but ive found its easier to locate survivors crouched
---
Deputy should just be after completing the safe hook rescue, instead of 30 seconds after the safe hook rescue.
---
Maybe Kate or Meg...... but Jane? Yeah, no
---
i always point at the locker and wave come here then point to let them know someone's in there. If they want to be a bitch i'll make their situation a bitch. 
---
Favoritism tier :
---
1 Spirit.
---
2 Huntress.
---
3 Nurse.
---
4 Pig.
---
5 - 15 others killers.
---
If your insulting it for day 50 that means you’ve been active enough on the sub to notice the recurring trends, which implies you are a member of the dbd community, in particular a member who would tbag at the exit gates
---
Lmao @ getting bodied by Assyrians, just run Enduring dude 
---
Nah, just had another match similar to this except the survivor caught on. I ended up showing them where the hatch was and I think he maxed out his bp
---
i did that once because i died on my first hook while the killer was chasing someone else, and none of my other two teammates tried to unhook me and only when i was in the struggling phase, Claudette decided to urban evasion to the hook because she was way too scared that the fuckin' Clown might get her while Laurie juked him the entire 2 mins in the direct opposite of the map
---
whatever, that's why i started using Kindred lately
---
It's not perfect but it is literally a slasher flick in movie form.
---
The entity only takes humans into its realm. 
---
I believe you need to double pip w a merciless victory now. ): 
---
I have a friend post update dc 4 out of 5 games she is very upset she can't play. Post update I did dc every other game until a small update.  I think a percent doesnt mean to but I know many who do it on purpose.  Maybe do like overwatch or ffxiv. So many dc and you cant que for x time.
---
yep, they fucked the adepts 
---
Damn, why would they make it so hard?
---
lol i like it
---
Slenderman was a human once
---
Rick survivor, Negan killer. Make it happen.
---
This is one of the better concepts I've seen on this sub, really nice.
---
Survivor sided is an understatement. I think there are 2 or 3 50/50 pallets in the lower level of the temple. Everything else is safe. It's painful. 
---
Killer after my own heart 🥰
---
Send internet police to spank them with daddy's belt on public television.
---
That's a fair way to play the game. If I wasnt constantly grinding to unlock all the perks I can, I'd also probably be doing this.
---
This is so silly. Mindgames just waste time at least 70% of the time. Survivors are usually not potatoes and catch on! 
---
I just let them drop the pallet and keep going. Less pallets for later, and a faster down. 
---
Oh shit i didnt realize I worded it like That. It's supposed to be the latter Yeah. Basically the effect lasts for 30 Seconds after you safe hook.
---
It also sucks cause sometimes other people make noise that you can’t stop and that could get you killed.
---
Yes, haha. I mean I do really like this concept, though. I think it would be cool if they made it so that while in a chase, you’re exposed is the killer is on your screen?
---
I often turn around while in chases to gauge how far the killer is from me.
---
That's ridiculous!
---
8:88
---
That's a difficult face to make IRL
---
I mean this guy kinda killed himself though. He tried to escape and than barely struggled
---
And as far as I could tell his teammates were pretty close, but I was near the hook because there was a gen nearby they worked on recently
---
I sometime run low on material
---
What can I say I digress. (Also I was never around for any of these memes)
---
And it's only like 2
---
Makes me want to vomit.
---
Yeah I am kicking myself for not getting all the Adepts before. I only got about half of them. 
---
5 of them were from samimation 
---
Yeah I’m not the best at killer 
---
Yes. SWF have an advantage. 
---
Yes. You can still have fun as a killer. 
---
OP, I love your content. It's very funny. :)
---
In your bizaroo dream?
---
This is like my 4th time killing all of them this is the only game no one d/ced and it still didn’t work.
---
Sadly I’ve seen two actual Myers that had noed on them, and they weren’t using scratched mirror. 
---
You don't go around 99%ing each gen instead of fully repairing one because you think the match is going too fast for your opponent to have fun. You're acting like an entitled hypocrite. 
---
In that case, what they're doing is shitty. But if OP didn't even try then....
---
So true its still hurting.
---
Out of 14. Cut me some slack
---
Sorry, I didn’t mean to say it as if I was calling you out on something
---
I completely understand people that play optimally, it’s just my preference to make games last longer than necessary by giving myself little challenges
---
Bobby I tell you what, in my bizaroo dreams I'm doing a lot more than just playing Dead by Daylight.
---
I can agree to the add on part on either killer or survivor, except of course *looks at franks mixtape* yeesh
---
Or dc
---
Even on console it is now frame droopy. 
---
I’m a survivor main but there were tons of them in line so I went killer to skip the line. Now I understand my mistake haha 
---
I was crying when he reset the loop at 1:02 in the video. He was about to end the loop but decided to just keep doing a “no u” the whole time.
---
It’s because it’s way too hard to rank up as survivor compared to killer. I haven’t seen a rank 1 survivor in a long time.
---
sounds like an exploit to me 
---
Wait? Killers get bloodpoints for a DC, even if they DC?
---
The fact that you think Lerys is actually real actually speaks more about your mental imbalance more than anything else. 
---
No no, I didn’t take it that way at all.  Nothing personal here either
---
Just my own thoughts lol
---
If you enjoy your play style, thats all that matters. It just personally doesn’t fit with me haha. 
---
You’re so smart, I totally forgot about boil over
---
He just wants to dump on DBD because he doesn't like it. Eh.
---
Savage.
---
Everyone is talking about the Seabear but all I can think of is that one south park episode where Cartman shoots Token
---
Technically he’s not; just do the final generator.
---
Noooooo GOD Please god noooo, NOOOOOOOOOO
---
Did you not see the whole “or more for killers?” And tbh, bloodpoints as a survivor aren’t that bad, unless at red it gets impossible, then I wouldn’t know.
---
There was. I had prosthetics but one big piece fell off after the competition because it kept getting stuck in the dress and the others I peeled off since this was taken right before I was gonna go home :3
---
Thanks!~
---
The ghosts of Bloodhunt Past, Blood Hunt Present and Blood Hunt yet to come...
---
There needs to be a time limit in this game. 20 maybe 30 mins MAX. Tired of hatch standoffs and hostage games. From survivors crouch walking around the map with exits open to killers blocking people in corners, it’s all shit. Cannot think of a reason why there shouldn’t be
---
watch out, the salty killer mains are coming to disagree
---
Thanks! I update my Instagram more if you’re interested in looking there! I’m also very active when it comes to uploading work in process photos~
---
Thank you very much. :)
---
I'm a full blown survivor main, tunnelling and camping annoy me unless it's because I've pissed off the Killer to the point they're doing it to get me then I find it amusing.
---
I do find it jarring how survivors act entitled if they do well, and bitch out for not being given the hatch, like okay you played well? But not enough to get out. Survivor mains (saying this as one) genuinely disgust me at points.
