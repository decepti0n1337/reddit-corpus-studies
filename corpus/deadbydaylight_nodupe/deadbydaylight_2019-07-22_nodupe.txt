i want to see huntress next would be cool to see what he will do.
---
---
---
This one longing for the hatch, that one wants to get 4K.
---
Hell yeah
---
We‚Äôre do I sign
---
Better pyramid head, and Robbie a interaction for leaving the fog world.( Like the alarms from Freddy)
---
you get around a thousand depending on how many times you hook and for the entity summon then you get more for them dying on hook so you dont get full credit
---
A team of survs are already more powerful than a killer, so 9 wouldn‚Äôt make sense
---
It‚Äôs 20 downs on console. I have four so far. It‚Äôs a bit rough
---
‚ÄúWe only have Decisive Strike, Head On, 20 pallets, and sometimes flashlights.‚Äù
---
An unsympathetic female killer would be awesome and I rather want an new oc killer. But hey it's just my opinion
---
And the bridge is doing totems
---
How do we activate this? Please tell me! I wanna try this out with my friends so badly
---
This would be super fun!
---
SWFs will always be the most toxic. We can all happily agree.
---

---
Whether you‚Äôre a ‚Äúrandom‚Äù that has to be the one who ‚Äúruins‚Äù it for the SWFs, or if you‚Äôre a killer experiencing them. SWFs are the worst.
---
Huntress hachets and plague counters iron will. Unfortunately
---
For me it's super obvious. Like when I'm walking to a group of 3 gens to check em, it's like "Oh! There he is." Or even when I'm walking to a gen and they hear my terror radius I can see if they walk/crouch past the gen.
---
Really? That sucks. Imagine doing super well in a game and you're accidentally looking at him the entire time. That would be heartbreaking
---
No, it's not an aura or notification.
---
Your dad is a fucking mad lad
---
How could you ever forget about buba
---
I'm not though. I have no obsession perks and still the obsession. Even happens in games when the killer is not running obsession perks.
---
He would marry Kate in a heartbeat.
---
I don't get what you're saying.
---
This isn't PUBG. There are no bushes and crouching, let alone crouching in one place, doesn't win a game.
---
Trapper
---
Self Care Is probably A Tier Or Possibly S Don't Know why you put Plunders Instinct At A But Okay. Kinda Flawed
---
i feel like slugging the 3rd survivor is now less needed now that you can close the hatch.
---
Perhaps you can spend that time also looking for the hatch, and once you do, see if you can get the third survivor killed and then shut the hatch before the last guy gets it.
---
granted, you'll have the exit gates to worry about. But the survivor is timed and- unless map rng was against you, patrolling between two spots on the map should be simple, specially if trapped.
---
Competitive and strategic are different things. If a game pits two teams against eacother and the outcome is determined by skill, wouldn't that be competitive? Also, just because there is no reward for ranks that doesn't mean it isn't competitive. 
---
It sounds like you are just comparing two different types of competition my guy. Wouldn't you agree most teams would win if they didn't make mistakes since their skill would outweight the opponents? Picture this, an overwatch match where one team makes no mistakes, they don't miss, they coordinate perfectly, run a perfect counter comp against the other team, and use their ults at the absolute best time. They would always win correct? Still competitive, they are just great at the game and in turn, deserve to win. Simple, best teams always win the competition.
---
Nah. 
---
Next killer is just Fuze as a whole. 
---
The normal weapons is his shield and he doesn't give the normal hearthbeat sounds but you can hear the "CLANG CLANG CLANG" of him running with the shield. 
---
The cluster bombs can be prepared on surfaces and activated remotely. 
---
Maybe in this game he will be competitive lol
---
Because why would a survivor perk protect the killer's?
---
Indeed
---
Personal preference i suppose.
---
sometimes it really do be like that
---
Stramger things i guess its chpater 14 because that chapter just includes a killer, and  dont realeasd any kid survivor
---
RIGHT!!
---
The logic here is incredible.
---
What perks are you using
---
Had this happen a few times on PTB, looks like it'll be pretty fun to do when everyone's asleep
---
Yeah, It Is easy to counter but the 4 survivors are four different players, you know? 3 may escape without a problem, but the 4th will be annoyed as fucking hell
---
That is so annoying
---
Ez 360 junk awesome pic tho !
---
I'll wait till dedicated servers are out.
---
Well, it's only Jane fault. Nurse played smart by going  for the injured one. You know... Killing is her objective.
---
Killers being able to work as a team&gt;9 survivors
---
This isn't necessarily true, it's not all about balance, there are some funny memes (although they aren't about knack being the best so they actually fuckin suck) some cool drawings, showcasing.
---
I dont think The Third Seal is worth a perk slot since it's a Hex Perk, and you would want to keep it for a longer time. It would probably pay more off to have Devour Hope active a whole trial, than having Third Seal active a whole trial, but thats just my opninion
---
I‚Äôm curious, how is bringing your friends cheating?  It‚Äôs an option in the menu, ‚ÄúSurvive with Friends‚Äù. 
---
Besides, in every horror movie where there‚Äôs a group of people surviving against a killer, the group is 99.9% of the time a *group of friends*.   Not a group of random strangers who just happen to end up together, against the killer. So it actually makes the game closer to the horror movie troupe, to have a group of real friends against the killer. 
---
If they wanted to go a step further they would adjust the game to be a range communication feature and not be able to talk to your mates across the map.
---
it keeps me fwom twipping at nite uwu
---
Okay I didn‚Äôt really think about the killers focusing the same surv, in that case then it would be interesting
---
How is it protecting the killers perk?
---
Its dus to the killer grunting that initiates a jumpscare ü§£
---
Oeiginal chapters are way more cooler than license ones... but with license characters there is way more hype than a original one.
---
I think the leather one is fantastic
---
He has a lot of shit add-ons, killer instinct, the ultra rare, detection range, stalking speed (Myers has this shit add-on too)
---
Tfw people don‚Äôt know this is a shit post
---
Think you mean WGLF.
---
Just hit 1 mil
---
Nah, too obvious. He was probably playing as clown.
---
It's a game, genius. None of this is how real life works. The fact you need to make a real world correlation with a joke about a make believe game shows your insecurity.
---
K??????
---
What about it exactly? you have to complete 3 generators to complete the daily ritual
---
Adrenaline, plunderers, lithe, and iron will.
---
Survivor main
---
This seems like a high ping situation where on his screen you were in front of him.
---
That‚Äôs what they all say
---
Wait are you saying the killer doesn‚Äôt lose you when you crouch behind a pallet right after dropping it?!
---
There is hopper and Steve and survivors as well and it would probably me the upcoming chapter
---
I like that light
---
üò∞
---
Yeah, there's no way they'll be able to get the F13 license, not anytime soon.
---
ty i got it on amazon
---
Because you said it randomizes so no one knows who has an obsession perk. Why would a survivor perk then apply the obsession status and protect a killer who may or may not be running one?
---
Yea, that is how competition works. Like I said, if a team never makes mistakes they will always win. I don't understand how you don't think an online match isn't competitive. The killer can make countless mistakes and still have a chance. Survivors can only make very few mistakes against good killers to get 4 escapes. They are 100% determined by skill.
---
Answer this, a rank 1 nurse faces 4 rank 20 survivors and decimates them. What determined the outcome od the match? Luck? Strategy? Or skill? It is skill.
---
So when survivors win by flashlight blinding, running perks to potentially counter killer tendencies, unhooking at optimal times, looping correctly, and avoiding an end game 3 gen, how is that no skill?
---
Sounds like you play killer and struggle and accuse survivors of having no skill because there is 4 of them and you can't multitask and correctly pressure them. Many rank 1 killers advise to know when to commit to chases and when to opt out. There is a way to play smart, and a way to play bad. Even the best swf lose matches and even the best killers allow escapes so I don't know what your point is.
---
You are completely right, but i will agree with the survivors that camping is annoying.
---
Immersed Meg: playing with a teddy bear.
---
I don't know about yall, but to me Meg is often the least toxic, usually innocent and trying to escape without bad manners, and often a complete potato to boot. Megs are cute, if they're the last one alive I give them hatch.
---
Clauds and Aces though, never ever.
---
This would make for an awesome poster with or without color.  Very talented.
---
I get your argument on dead hard but Adrenaline is not a seccond chance at winning, though as a fellow bloody wraith i understand the struggle.
---
So I have to leave even if survivors  are near that‚Äôs fucking stupid
---
What was the point of this post? It's a daily ritual, not rocket science. You act like you just stumbled across the Holy Grail and just had to share it with Reddit.
---
LET THE BEAT DROP
---
The DS change awhile ago for some reason, doesn't apply the Obsession to the DS User themself, instead it applies to another survivor.
---
Well I wouldn't call you an asshole based on that, but I would say you're naive if you expected anything productive or positive to come from messaging a camper
---
But how does it protect the killer?
---
My graphics in dbd is already set to the lowest though
---
Thanks for letting me know never to hire you for a job. Plays a video game while supposed to be working, lmao.
---
as if you have anything from being rank 1, aside from Endless Q-times....Rank 1 on Survivor means even less than on Killers.
---
Stupid clowns...
---
Eh, I disagree, you can slow down the clip and look at where she's aiming/looking, she thought I was gonna go to the right and aimed towards that way.
---
You'll get it after hundreds of hours of play. But yeah, the sooner DC penalty comes, the better.
---
Most of what you've got is spot-on, though I'd say the Shape fits under either Wrath or Lust more than Sloth. Clown could also fit under Lust, since his vices in the lore are based both around excess consumption and unyielding pursuit of desires.
---
Console :( F's in the chat.
---
Oh I take issue with face camping, but half the time what they call camping is merely seeing their incompetence at hiding or trying to loop killers by the hook. Fools
---
Hey, ur right! A stranger things chapter would be cool althought i never saw the serie
---
Groovy
---
I'd say Adrenaline is a 2nd chance, many survivors run it because they don't heal during the trial cause they can just heal up after finishing the last gen. But also because it can be used when getting hooked before the last gen pops, then getting unhooked after the exits are powered, similar to how DS is used as an anti-tunneling perk.
---
I know right? Them damn sneeky survivors at rank 1 must be teaching him all their tricks ü§£ü§£
---
Imagine tuesday when the mid chapter patch comes out getting a leak for the next killer and for some odd reason its Jason, now im hyped lmao
---
It‚Äôs even got a flair lmao
---
Hey apparently just staring at one character is fun for them. Yesterday I had a game against a Spirit, so she would hook me and go somewhere else to injure someone only to break her chase to come back to me to tunnel me. This happened twice and I died first, so fun. Oh I was running iron will and even when I thought she lost me she would not leave the area and search every corner to find me. Sooooo funnnnn and dont get me wrong I hit rank 1 many times im not the most obvious survivor either, even 360d her like five times but rip.
---
Try not to leave a comment without watching the video first man lol
---
The slugged party would like a word with you.
---
Your dad is an talented artist
---
Me when I use the pig ebony offering thing
---
It was thrilling. 10/10
---
I mean ok but it's not gonna happen. That license is such a shitshow right now it's not even funny. The fact is that nobody really holds the license because of the appeals that will happen over and over.
---
Groovy.
---
Ok... this is how it goes: creating a chapter is made by the art team, and the balance team, now, the bug fix team has nothing to do with the chapter, they dont try things and thats why some bugs happens
---
Matchmaking: Oh boy, 3 of you rank 20s are going up against this rank 12 killer.. Let's see... Here's 1 rank 10 survivor to help you guys out! Have fun!
---
Me (The rank 10 survivor): Oh. My. GODDDDDDDD.
---
I never thought Quentin could he any *more* horrifying, but here we are.
---
Why should he conform to survivors when he isn‚Äôt playing a survivor? You always get bad games but not playing a build for the survivors sake is just entitlement. The same thing could be said in purple toolboxes, they are very frustrating so by your logic survivors must never use one.
---
Noed=okay
---
Teabagging=devil spawn
---
Flashlighting=toxic
---
Guess I'll keep teabagging and flashlighting since its in the game. Dude just run light born and stop being a butthurt baby lol
---
I mean... you're worse than them if you dc, screw over your entire team because baby dweet did a goof.
---
They need high tick rate servers and just a hitbox overhaul in general for that
---
I don't own xbox version but I'd assuming that since he isn't there neither would be his perks. But he's coming soon don't worry.
---
Thank you for the reassurance!
---
Bills perks are just standard survivor perks that you get through the blood web. However, once Bill is added his perks will be locked behind his own bloodweb until you level him up.
---
They‚Äôre actually just standard perks for everyone to get whenever, at least until he is added.
---
I was watching the Claudette run by, trying to figure out why she didn‚Äôt hop on the gen with me lol
---
No he's just mindgaming
---
Got it thanks!
---
That doesn't make this game competitive. A competitive game would be more balanced and less RNG. Perks doesn't always counter what killers run. Looping doesn't really take skill when you've played a long time. Avoiding the 3 gen strat is common sense. Unhooking at right times is also common sense. Hell, you can keep a killer from pipping altogether if you play in a 4man with comms and the most tryhard perks. Does that take skill? No.
---
I don't play killer and accuse survivors of not having skill.
---
Okay. But what I'm saying is I am NOT running an obsession perk. My fiance in my SWF is. Every game. I am the obsession with NO obsession perk while others ARE running one.
---
Yes and that's when they can't call it camping anymore.
---
Killers can hit for even longer after vaults.
---
Nurses calling reveals any action, not just healing.
---
BBQ stays on for the whole match after just one hook.
---
Adrenaline now downs survivors instead of healing.
---
Sloppy Butcher stacks each time it is applied to a survivor. 
---
Anyone can just throw out random bugs to plea "oh it is so hard for this side, everything goes wrong for us and they get every bug in their favor.
---
IIRC, there are more current bugs helping killers than hurting them.
---
I use bond, spine chill, adrenaline and lithe.
---
Bond - helps with coordination especially in solo, useful for flashlight saves and getting heals off as well as finishing gen 5 faster.
---
Spine Chill - nice stealth you got there bud
---
Adrenaline - adrenaline
---
Lithe - useful for escaping chases before they even begin. There's windows everywhere.
---
I've had the game for two years ish, it can be a grind sure, but I had so much fun playing. I'd just hop on for a few matches after work. I have a bloody Dwight, and a p1 hag. You should do the daily's and figure out what's fun for you. I never would have guessed I liked hag, but I have fun playing her. 
---
 
---
If you're playing survivor I'd grab bond so you can see your teammates. Also, expect to lose. It's not the type of game where once you master it you constantly win.
---
Is it a bug that's known or now a feature? lmao
---
#PILLS HERE
---
[removed]
---
Huntress Hatchets hitbox reversed. Only hitting the survivor directly will not deal damage, but anywhere else will instantly mori them.
---
Are you playing while plugged in or on battery?
---
Chill. This reddit isn‚Äôt meant for shaming other players.
---
right? it's such bullshit I still have never gotten lereoys institute.
---
That's my boy. My boy do be lookin kinda fresh doe üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
Yes, the killer can keep tabs on every survivor when they do objectives while survivors can use SB on demand instead of immediately. Balanced. Oh, by the way, killers can hit after vaults, through pallets, skill checks will randomly disappear and make you miss them, and why not, sometimes survivors get no hud and can't perform actions. But that SB man, really breaks the game.
---
"An object of pure unadulterated obsession."
---
This happend to me with a Laurie just running away, I realised why couple of seconds later ..
---
He did justice to the character  good job
---
 on point
---
Doing totems as a solo survivor is unrealistic, especially without small game. Hell, sometimes it's better to leave totems up so you can check if that totem became noed.
---
A little cunt of her part, but the Jane is the main issue. Anyway, good luck, I hope you get good new matches match's
---
"AUGH!"
---
Often matchmaking is like this, and few times not in my experience. But just keep on practicing with one killer that you like and you will be at the same level as the survivors
---
Nea barely changed lol
---
He‚Äôs really not that bad at high ranks, I‚Äôd rather play him than Wraith, Trapper, or Pig for example. His only real weakness is he doesn‚Äôt have huge map pressure
---
A lot of people just don‚Äôt know how to play him well period.
---
Dude, chill this is reddit not twitter. Bad games happen, don't do this immature bs
---
Wdym? I was an arsehole all game t bagging hooked survivors and running to other survivors while chased
---
Yeah just way too strong on Lery's. Not like this drift was easy to do.
---
He was not expecting that to happen when he brought decisive that game
---
P.S. no one cares about this Kind of post.
---
Hmm this problem is caused entierely by latency from the killers bad wifi. But servers that will constantly have good conenction won't fix the problem at all apparently.
---
And teabagging
---
I always feel bad when I do really good against someone using a splinter
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I should be impressed or concerned here
---
I would marry Kate in a heartbeat üò≠
---
Well it's better to know if you were an arse than not knowing
---
Definitely karma got my ass her :)
---
That's okay ‚ù§ you care enough to post a comment.
---
;)
---
honestly even if that's hard to do im not sure if it should be allowed.
---
stay tuned on here or on my IG!
---
Gave away the hatch to someone who kobe'd first try and they called me a baby killer... after i let them go and pretty much got the four man after their team gen locked, i'm bad though. One of those games where i wish i brought an ebony tbh.
---
Yikes, what kind of bozo makes a reddit thread to call someone out. Embarassing
---
i have not played in a while so my killer rank is around 13 or so but i mostly sit around purples though i‚Äôm a survivor main so honestly when i picked him up i wasn‚Äôt expecting the ds either lol
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs toxic. If she was just tunneling you. She just wanted to get a survivor out of the game as fast as possible to slow overall progress.
---
h e  d o n e
---
it aint much but its honest work
---
Wtf are you talking about. Correct me if I am wrong, you are saying a 4 man swf will always win, no matter how good the killer is? That is idiotic to say the least. A skilled nurse can disband even the best swf teams. Perks are strategy. Do you want to sabo hooks? Rush gens? Loop? Heal? Pick perks to help your playstyle. 
---
Skill os developed from playing long times and practicing. So looping does take skill. That is like saying, shooting a basketball doesn't take skill when you play basketball a long time. Archery doesn't take skill when you've practiced a long time. Skill is developed so you just implied looping does indeed take skill my guy. Preventing a 3 gen against a killer that is trying to 3 gen does take skill. A whole lot of strategy and ability to pop a gen that is being heavily patrolled. Unhooking is not common sense always. Do you leave your gen to unhook? Or pop then unhook. Do you wait for the killer to get closer so that BT will activate or unhook with distance so you have more time to run? Everything in this game takes some form of skill and strategy.
---
You still sound like a bad killer who loses to good survivors and then insists it is so easy for them and that it isn't skill when they win. 
---
"When killers win it is cause they are skilled, if the survivors win it is because rng they have no skill". See how dumb that sounds? What seperates a rank 20 survivor from a rank 1 survivor? Skill? No. That couldn't be it. Must be rng. The game says "who am I gonna make rank 1 this season"
---
That would be insane tho lmaooo. Picture it, you just die instantly cause she lobbed a hatchet a mile past you.
---
Double standard and killer mains are kinda soft
---
Shut up boomer
---
Message wasn't that long but yea maybe I took it too literal. Just the way you put only bugs that hurt killers kinda insinuated you were saying killers always get screwed. At the end of the day, we are both right. Both killers and survivors get boned by these buggy updates.
---
I keep getting tunneled or bad killers now that I'm in with my SWF :(
---
Dude this is beautiful! Its a very interesting take on her bandages. I'm trying to share my art too, but it wont let me post T.T Any idea why? I really wanna share what I have made..

That‚Äôs amazing

Level 1 will allow you a maximum of two tokens for a 50% total bonus; level 2 allows three tokens for 75% total bonus; level 3 allows four tokens for 100% total bonus.

I'm up for it change is good

Someone give his dad a father of the year mug.

I never understood the value of spine chill until I heard peoples opinions on it. I may start running it in my kit.

Ahhh that makes perfect sense. Thank you!

Supposedly where your mouse is once you start DBD, it'll be in the middle of the screen.

I remember one guy on this subreddit used a cheerio as the crosshair.

Just open any shooter game you have installed or at least any screenshot you can find on the internet and use that.

Bonus salt from random redditors, the best :)
---
99% sure that‚Äôs a lagswitch

Nope huntress and hag are both slow and rely too much on map rng. Billy is consistent so hes better.
---
lol downvoted. I'd expect nothing less from this community!
---
Counterpoint: no I don't think I will
---
So what exactly constitutes as a salt message? I posted a similar experience recently and got the post taken down within 5 mins. This has been up for hours.
---
Fair enough
---
I had a great game, him, not so much
---
Where's the shame? I was actually giving him a public platform to shame me instead, really
---
Not what reddit is for
---
PC
---
Awh that's really cute! Looks well made too. Would have been neat to have some caved planes for the pink of the ears, but nicely done overall.
---
You do realise that most red ranks are garbage. Rank doesn't mean jack shit. I got to rank 1 killer and survivor after 150hours of playtime, just proves how easy it is.
---
Yeah, he should be pretty embarrassed!
---
This kind!
---
It still isn't your problem, not as far as I can tell

Overkill.
---
What is it for?
---
Myers or Ghostface. Myers if you‚Äôre better at chasing, and Ghost Face if you are better at stealth. Plus it doesn‚Äôt hurt that both have extremely solid perk options (Save The Best For Last and Thrilling Tremors/I‚Äôm All Ears being quite good)
---
So, the thing that they should do is hire more people that fig bugs
---
That would be super fuckin sick though
---
you‚Äôre quite the pleasant one huh
---
Heads up op if your rude in the comments high chance people who agree will down vote like me :)
---
It's a bit more complex if I understand it correctly.  The thing is hitting a survivor once resets the chase, so any insta downs reduce your chaser points, since you miss out on the second chase.
---
EXACTLY!!!! Also is it just me, but if feels like there‚Äôs double the pallets when I‚Äôm playing Killer
---
u/ponyhit your a great person :)
---
Im a killer main and wanted to say more often then not the killer lost you too unless you vault a window or drop a pallet recently or see s

Haven't noticed a terror radius change, but as for the lullaby maybe increase the volume but it should stay non-directional.

Did this on rank reset day with iri head and infantry belt huntress. 19, 20, 12 and 15 i believe were their ranks.
---
Lol ü§£
---
Actually, he murder his own family.
---
I can't really agree or disagree with that, all I can guess about him is that he's probably a sore loser! But there's plenty of great people who are also sore losers from time to time, so he might very well be
---
haunted grounds?
---
Whaaaat?
---
Tbh i dont find this accurate. Give the one on the left a chainsaw and hammer and the one on the left bright clothes and 3 other copies, flashlights insta heals and brand new parts and pallets.
---
Don't be making incorrect statements and you won't get opposing opinions. This is reddit. Not an echo chamber for you to vent without risk of criticism.
---
wdym he healed so he could take two hits, duh ;p
---
Ah ok yeah that makes sense. My gf cleansed one right before she found the other 3 of us. It was weird because the game disconnected right after that and it looked like some sort of exploit. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I really would rather have original killer map and survivor to be honest .
---
This is also not just you. As survivor I‚Äôm yelling at my TV for have the match, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs a pallet? I need a pallet!‚Äù
---
Then as killer, there‚Äôs a pallet every two damn seconds LOL
---
And you two sound like the same kinds of survivors that complain about ruin and noed
---
Lmao but it's a red item
---
I don't believe I have seen you or ms_claymore. Are you friends of his, or did I facecamp you, or both?
---
Ahah, true! Now that I think about it.. I need a Michael - Jordan - Myers outfit!
---
Nah. Billy is just overall good on almost every map outside of Lery's (That's just sad to watch). But I would say Huntress, Clown, and Myers are a bit behind him, all doing well in very different areas, and all having their own weaknesses the others don't have to deal with.
---
Honestly the new blocks for Freddy are trash. I believe the purple variant causes hemorrhage which is laughably bad.

vous putain de connard lmao

Wow, they helped him play a game? That means they're heroes. They also threatened a kid cause he didn't like Keanu Reeves or Minecraft. This was in 2019

Doctor is more of an annoyance than a viable Killer. Against lower skilled Survivors who don't even bother with Ruin, he can be great, but Survivors who are good at skill checks will make his power pretty useless.
---
Good one, you come up with that all by yourself?
---
I know right, every single laggy killer I've played against will have to go through my suffering.
---
I didn't even look up what any of it meant yet, I've just been watching it happen. Can't say I expected anything like this to happen on a post like this!
---
Thanks for appreciating it and no, you're not dumb: it's a screenshot i took in game that I first edited in Photoshop and then with an app for an artistic filter I really like! :)
---
Thank you that was a really great video!
---
Lmao this is reddit what do you expect üòÇ
---
Jesus, you're using SJW unironically?
---
Boi....I love it.
---
@fuzzymafia
---
You're very correct, I did.
---
thats not edgy thats stupid
---
Could be in a few days when they reset, could be two months. I've seen Bond in the Shrines a ton, so it's possible. Tbh I'd just buy Laurie and level her up at this rate. Even then, DS isn't that strong anymore since it's pretty much just an anti tunnel build. Pre-nerf DS was absurdly good

People were all super friendly when I asked for advice on starting the game from this sub so thanks everyone :)
---
Weren't you that guy who facecamped me all game or
---
Dude, you don't *have* to play Hag to level her up. Just put points into her
---
I enjoyed the PS.

Hmm a sombra main a man of culture I see

Rule 19 - no fun at all for anyone
---
Look how they massacred my baby ghostface
---
Yeah, I did, and it's pretty accurate too. Look at all your downvotes lmao
---
Doctor is annoying and isn‚Äôt necessarily fun. Does that mean he needs a nerf? No. Just because your not having fun dosen‚Äôt mean something is unbalanced/op. But PB shouldn‚Äôt be a thing
---
I lot of add ons dont get used by me like Plagues increased infection on objects. Doctors aura when madness tiers or any of the blindness addons    but I do think Pig really needs a rework on hers
---
Anytime I play Killer to grind out some bloodpoints, I always manage to go against SWF teams who get gens done in record speeds, but the second I play Survivor (at the same rank) it's all just me and one other person doing gens while the others go down in a few seconds of the chase starting
---
Nurse doesnt like you either &gt;:(

The game breaks when survivors are able to communicate constantly. It's not cheating but it's pretty much impossible for the killer against any competent group.
---
Yea i bought bamboozle but just wish i got popgoestheweasel now
---
Yeah, I still don't know wtf you're on about. Begone baby troll.
---
Becausee has was tbagging at gate and wouldnt leave. He became obsession once he dsd him(making him only killable with rancor) but he was too dumb to realize that. You have a tiny brain, you dont even understand how survivor perks work üòÇ
---
All the killers would stay IMO
---
Honestly this seems very good and very fair
---
What made you say this?
---
Pig v ghostface
---
Pure.
---
Bagathon
---
hi its Legion i still exist in this game, incase you forgot
---
i did all my homework and ive been really well behaved. thank you for reworking me so i am not so utterly despised by everyone. could i please have some neat addons now?
---
Thanks mate!
---
i agree with u tho, tbagging and flashlight clicking only piss u off if u make them personal and hurtful. but really you just go right to crying camper. its not a good look
---
Just join a match and throw hatchets at a wall and slowly figure out where to put your crosshairs. I honestly don't think it will help  that much but good luck.
---
It wouldn't be just a second though, there would be a "teleportation" animation like the good ol fashioned kino der toten teleporter and then the blindness would be significantly longer than a flashlight stun, (maybe like 10 seconds without lightborn?)
---
It would be more than enough time for a survivor to run away/commit if they are brave. The portals are for killers who are at a loss of what to do so they use them to do quick gen patrols and maybe get lucky. The portals benefit from the portals too.
---
Power: Lockers (I know, original name)
---
Grants the ability to pick up a locker and, fuckin‚Äô... throw it at the survivors, leading to instant death. Yeah.
---
totally agree with your points
---
if you stay at a hook for more than 5 seconds you are a camper
---
I love the survivor to survivor ‚Äúhello/thank you tbag‚Äù :)
---
well, simply yes.
---
What do you advise when it comes to sb in terms of walking around to save it or just running and hoping you get it back if you see the killer?
---
I would say no. The Doctor's shock is very unreliable, and very situational. Even if you do master how to use it, the actual times where it is going to make a difference are very few and far between, especially when playing against good survivors. At that point you're better off just playing as the Clown who does something similar, just with a lot more consistency.
---
Hmm? No it‚Äôs totally fine to close the hatch all you want but I‚Äôve had at least 4 matches in a row where the killer did exactly this, granted yes survivors butt dance every match. However my point is this *epic hatch prank* is getting old so I just lay there until they close it
---
Never posted here, let me know if this needs to be changed at all. Thanks!
---
Yeahhh.... He's third, but can still get his ass looped to high heavens by good survivors. Spirit and nurse are pretty much unloopable if they are good.
---
What an I looking at here? This looks normal.
---
I found the Ruin totem at the very beginning of the game, and as punishment spent the entire rest of the game slugged on the ground with Joey watching very intently
---
All 5 gens got finished and the other 3 escaped
---
And I'm telling you it's not a prank
---
His job here was done
---
chapter 13 may be a licensed chapter since bhvr is pairing up with stranger things it could go to death garden but that makes not sense or they could be making a netflix original dbd show lmao
---
No he excelled in all his classes. He was supposed to get information out for the people that wanted the information, he had no care for information he just wanted to torture his patients. Also to develop himself into the doctor. 
---
He didn‚Äôt gain the knowledge he wanted or that he even needed. He gained it because that was his job. He didn‚Äôt want to get fired. He gave them what they needed which was information and he got what he needed which was them not watching how he tortured his victims. 
---
He has no care for anything he just wanted to torture his victims without getting caught so he could feel good.
---
Woah this is epic!  he‚Äôs got talent
---
All right, thanks! But it is possible to reach rank one with about every killer right?
---
You cant do kids at all thats like taking a knife out on a kid in gta and shanking them to death
---
You also have the shrine thing where you can buy up to four teachable perks for everyone with the shards. Or play a bit with friends in kill your friends. You can use EVERY perk in the game freely, so you have all the time i the world to try out. 
---
Also I'm looking forward to play with you!
---
try to tell that to the devs that has in their system if you 4k too quickly you dont even get a blackpip
---
Nah
---
I‚Äôve been okay with running BBQ, Franklin‚Äôs, Distressing, and Knock Out.
---
*The* problem, huh? There's just the one, and it is facecamping killers. I wonder what you think created the facecamping problem. No doubt it is something of a chicken-and-egg thing, and there are certainly your Angry Pugs of the world who do it just to do it. But I don't understand how anyone can think SWF is fair. The game was not designed for it. So I have no problem being unfair back. And if we ask the devs, they say camping is fine. I actually facecamped McLean once, that was pretty crazy even for me.
---
&gt;to 
---
if only they made killer viable at red ranks without meta perks, oh wait thats only nurse and spirit
---
Unhooking someone, then going down and getting yourself hooked very shortly after
---
yeah but once the Entity has no use for you you just get tossed into a void of suffering for eternity. I'd rather fight like hell to stay alive then go there.
---
I didn‚Äôt see the Obsession change. Sue me. All I see is an asshole pig main who thinks using DS is still toxic. 
---
Oh no a survivor boasted at the gate! Cry about it. God I hate this reddit, and this game‚Äôs shitty community so fucking much.
---
You BARELY see it. The Bill was about to leave but didn‚Äôt because there was one more person on the field. Didn‚Äôt even see that he wasn‚Äôt Obsession before which means he had zero anticipation for Rancor. And Rancor shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to work that way at all either.
---
I had a homie Spirit literally carry me to a chest to get a toolbox, carry me to the last gen, then carry me to the exit. I didn‚Äôt want them to go empty-handed, so I refused to leave, but then they carried me to the hatch.
---
Such a pure soul literally carried me to victory.
---
Shortly after he hit ds when he was inside the exit gate.
---
Im gonna start saying this exact thing every time someone complains about me running omegablink nurse with ebony :)
---
Just try to avoid the milk that shoots out.
---
I enjoy running that a lot, and love it when I already found a purple flash light, and then while injured find an insta heal.
---
He has a s c e n d e d beyond the need for hooks
---
I think this is true to a certain point. However, if someone wants to get better at the game, they should at least be open to critiques. I squared off against a Legion that basically started the game by slugging us all. There was literally no game - just him slugging and not even picking anyone up. The last person got slugged and hooked - that's not a game, and definitely, not fun.
---
I think you're too young to play this game
---
I didn't take it as tunneling, I took it as: "wow there's an injured survivor not moving very fast near the hook spot let's go get him first like any other smart sensible person would"
---
The game actually is designed for camping. There are perks, like Insidious, that are there for the express purpose. And, no, I don't. I didn't always. You may be allowed to, but the game mechanics suffer. Many perks are no longer necessary, and even being able to tell your friend locations is a huge advantage. I'm so sad your friend blocked me, I so wanted to see you guys again :( I don't think you were godly, either. The godly survivors don't generally lose to me.
---
If that‚Äôs true then I‚Äôm severely disappointed. The only time I ever consistently use blood to track is if I‚Äôm for some reason using bloodhound
---
tell him to draw the wraith or the spirit
---
Got the game back in beta, quit playing shortly after I started and came back resently. 
---
This is my favorite build by far! I love just playing this wierd roguelike helping randy's along the way!
---
Could you imagine you as a survivor seeing a nurse use that loadout?I‚Äôd just assume they‚Äôre so godly they don‚Äôt even need perks that are good on her to get a 4K
---
Just got to wait . Doesn‚Äôt take too long
---
While she's not as powerful as Nurse or Spirit, I still get a ton of fun out of playing Pig (especially w/ that test subject outfit &lt;3). She can get looped for sure and I'd say only 1 of her 3 perks is really well suited to her (Surveillance, Hangman's trick being worthless and Make Your Choice being better suited to Hag or Spirit or Nurse or any extra mobile killer), but I still get a ton of joy whenever I jump scare a survivor while crouched and it's one of the best feelings in the game when you get a reverse beartrap kill (they're rare, but I think that makes them more exciting, not less).
---
üòÇüòÇ I read that as Saminations Frank, and although I'm laughing, I also feel bad for him
---
I know they arent officially paired up, but I love playing as plague because vomiting being her power is so absurd and amusing and to me feels like something out of the evil dead series
---
Pig's add-ons are a serious flaw with her build (and I say that as Pig main). Most of them just aren't very good, even at the highest levels. 
---
There's a reason why every Pig stockpiles medical files, video tapes, and combat straps, and that's because they're pretty much the only Pig add-ons that unambiguously aid her in every game and don't require some very, very specific circumstance to help (or actively hurt her).
---
Ok, this is a shitpost regarding the fact I‚Äôve seen this drop the survivor, close the hatch thing so many times and they all act like they‚Äôre the first to do it. By ‚Äúprank‚Äù I mean the killer will swing their weapon at the hatch Bob their head as in ‚Äúok I‚Äôm letting you go‚Äù but then close it shut, yes butt dancing got old hours after people starting doing it hence why it‚Äôs referred to as toxic no one wants to see it and I‚Äôm willing to bet in my next match if I find the hatch the killer will do this hatch close in front of me because, why not? It‚Äôs funny. Yes adrenaline works here and screws over the killer lesson learned that they shouldn‚Äôt do this anymore. Sorry that this post sucks but that‚Äôs why the tag says ‚Äúshit‚Äù
---
Yeah getting boldness up is faster than just hiding and doing gens, but you normally should try to do both.
---
To make sure it wasn't a dream pallet
---
You fly? Duh
---
You mean when he is behind the wall and only his aura is visible? How would he know his aura is visible?
---
Everytime, OP. Everytime.
---
To be honest you sound like one of the people who makes this community as bad as it is. A little positivity doesn‚Äôt hurt
---
The Doctor is one of those killers where he becomes exponentially weaker as you climb the ranks. 
---
People in low ranks (20-15) are not good at skillchecks so his perks and static field can be very oppressive. 
---
People in high ranks (10-1) know that he cannot counter most loops with his base shocks or EVEN WITH HIS ADDONS (because they all have an excessive charge time penalty). 
---
I think The Doctor would be in a really good place if they just buff his electrode addons and some other garbage addons like the maple knight.
---
With how weak that change would make it it probably shouldn't be a hex perk.
---
Yea, great idea man. Go buy a headset, turn it up and watch your world change. Survivor takes a step anywhere near you and it is too easy to follow.
---
Legion has garbage add ons.
---
You ok?

The worst is Thrill of the hunt is considered to be a bad perk by almost all top players. Complaining about that perk is such a joke lol
---
You sound fun at parties
---
Yea, and evverytime I get a meathook shoved through my back I can just get myself off and start running. Realism clearly isn't a focus of this game moron. Think before you speak.
---
I personally don't think NOED is too powerful either, it is more so from the general community's reaction towards it that I based this off. For what it is worth I am a killer main, and based this off how boring I find the perk, as well as how much of a crutch I find it to be for killers who struggle to control the game without it.
---
I'm glad you liked the idea though! It's kinda like the lovechild of current NOED and Blood Warden. We need more scary perks!
---
Im sorry that happened my guy.
---
Why does Kate look like Meredith from The Office
---
There are people that run it on every character.
---
I never run it on any killer that I play.
---
Going from Trapper to Nurse to Pig to Spirit. Never use NOED but people think it's a must nowadays (it's really not)
---
Wooow that‚Äôs really nice :0 he‚Äôs really good! ^^
---
Do you *want* nine year olds who don‚Äôt know what a generator is irl to come to this toxic game
---
üòÇüòÇ welcome to console. It can sometimes take an hour
---
I'm glad you liked the idea. People are entitled to their own opinions, I just don't like it when people add nothing useful to the conversation.
---
I don‚Äôt agree Spirit is number 2. Maybe with average gamers. Billy can just end a game immediately. An optimal Billy is fucking scary.
---
My friends don't say where the killer is. We usually make jokes to eachother because we don't care about the game fully. Also the game isn't designed for facecamping, that's why you can depip if all you do is facecamp.
---
Lol, thanks
---
Man this woman is delusional.
---
Innocentangryblackman
---
Increasing the range
---
Ma‚Äôam that‚Äôs a Walgreens not a shrine
---
Yea I never use NOED myself, and love bloodwarden. Another means of blocking off an exit sounds so enticing and I think unfortunately you'll potentially get hating comments just because of the typical NOED meme'ing that goes on. 
---
Blocking off just one exit and it being the one the killer is near sounds so amusing. I can just imagine a survivor tbagging at the gate and I'm Ghostface tbagging with them having a merry ol squatfest and creeping closer and closer
---
About to prestige my Spirit, but using all the rare addons I've been saving up for ages before I hit that prestige. Managed to bank almost 1mil BP in doing so, so once I prestige I can level her back up considerably right away! Can't wait!!
---
Did the math, it saves 3 sec opening a door, so it goes from 20 sec to 17, pretty useless to me ngl, but you can run it if you feel it‚Äôs helping you
---
Do I help them?
---
Unless you are a swf, vhances are your team is autistic and you are not going to have time to do bones. Noed really only punishes solo queues.
---
So maybe 8 meters further at all ranks? I should clarify this is from the gate itself, not the map border that survivors cross over to escape, so it is a fair distance away already. If it is too far away from the gate it takes away the "nearly escaping" theme.
---
That still applies to my last comment. No teammates to hinder so no foul. Survivors need to understand it‚Äôs not the same thing and that they should actually consider others in their lobby. But it‚Äôs easier to divert or act goofy so you‚Äôll all do that. Lmao
---
I‚Äôm surprised they don‚Äôt by now.
---
I've honestly wait a little. I find the DLC's go on sale quite regularly for at least 50% off!
---
Wait and buy 2 for the same price :)
---
I'm not saying you should care about Reddit karma, I'm just saying it's a decent indicator of how people feel about your post and comments, which is generally negatively.
---
-3 people get hooked before the first Gen-
---
*IM HAVING FUN, I SWEAR.*
---
Gens are always next to doors. It's pretty easy to find them. The Game is only good for killer if the survivors are really bad. The killer's skill has no impact because every pallet is safe so you just run them like a brain dead ai and hope all the pallets are gone before then Gens finish.
---
&gt; On a side note, one year ago I made a post about a match where I solo'd 5 gens and saved someone after the 5th gen was completed (they escaped)...and I didn't pip. SERIOUS.
---
Sounds hard to believe. Thats 4 (lightbringer) + 4 (escaping unbroken) + probably 2 (altruism) + at least 1 (evader)
---
Oh wait that's 11... that's actually safety at red ranks. Yea that's super silly lol
---
It‚Äôs okay. The game will never change because people like Panda downvote me and claim that everything is fine even though they‚Äôre boosted players :/.
---
Honestly if you're playing killer, you should just disable chat and set your profile to private. For some reason people take this game way too seriously and will literally send you death threats over nothing.
---
I‚Äôd happily pay for masks from all the different movies. The current mask looks kinda trashy compared to the ones in the movies imo.
---
Is this you?
---
Thankfully when my teammates are horrible the kind killer will often have sympathy and give me hatch
---
Honestly I wasn't a fan of new Laurie.  I thought she was kind of annoying and was hoping she'd die tbh.  Now we have 3 "strong" female leads with plot armor. I feel like she's not really needed in the new branching story. Can't have one without the other though, and new Mike was pretty sick. I wouldn't be upset with him being added. Liscensing probably doesn't work out that way though :(
---
Even without enduring I still swing through every pallet I can. I just don't give a fuck, what's a stun going to do besides eat up a few seconds? Often a survivor drops the pallet late and I hit them and get stunned. 
---
When I used to main Freddy I never respected pallets without enduring. I used Freddy's power to waste everyone's time and after 593 concussions from pallets dropped on my head, there's no more pallets and survivors are in trouble. With new Freddy's ability to make fake pallets, getting god-pallet dropped on your face is going to feel like the best thing in the world as you can then fake it.
---
So if you run up to the killer and you are far superior to him and you can run him around all game, yes that is usually a safe way to pip up. But i've had plenty of game where i was not better than the killer (i couldn't have dominated him like this) and i still pipped up from a combination of living 9 minutes, getting gold lightbringer, gold evader and gold altruism.
---
&gt;punished when face camping
---
How the fuck are they punished ?
---
Yeah, don't try to protect your totem.. also don't try to catch the survivors
---
It is funny that you can see which survivors play killer sometimes and which don't 
---
But be carefull - some survivor teams will annoy the shit out of you if they see that you got thrill of a hunt
---
Any trailers?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the monster too
---
Ria rea rie reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
If you are using "hex thrill of the hunt" and a survivor tries to break your hex totem, you are supposed to let them break it, or the survivors are very salty. Carefull guys.
---
Edit: My bad had to remake post forgot to flair lol
---
I mean. People can run whatever they want. It doesn‚Äôt really matter now does it?
---
Git gud.
---
Kinda sad to run noed on a instadown character
---
nah, just an opinion. And this game is dying by the day, so if anything a little feedback wouldn‚Äôt hurt. Next!
---
lol you're right. I guess the few exceptions to this rule is why i didn't do it. I sometimes do get nice people lol
---
1 rank solo deserves respect
---
Why this has less upvotes than some shitty cut and paste meme blows my mind into pieces, I love it
---
Well those guys actually did that, they kept trying to break them from each side but they failed since i could sprint as billy.
---
You sound like the type of killer that runs noed.
---
has it ever been stated that huntress ate people? i thought they were just funner/more challenging for her to kill
---
She‚Äôs kinda country thot
---
I was prepared to tell you buffing that perk is stupid... but that buff is very reasonnable/smart. +1
---
Doing gens is the survivors Main objective...? Idk why people get mad at gen rushing when that‚Äôs literally the point of the game, power the gates to escape?
---
Have you ever played a good SWF group? Sometimes as killer you feel helpless. Solo survivor definitely feels killer favored and then SWF seems survivor sided. If they make the killers weaker than they are more hopeless.
---
Please use free caption next time
---
Great i hope you dont see anything wrong with teabagging and flashlights.
---
How is ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù a thing? That‚Äôs your main objective. Doing gens, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre suppose to do.. I don‚Äôt get it. Who made that up to become a thing?
---
I don't really think so. It's not like pipping becomes harder solo.
---
That‚Äôs bait.
---
That‚Äôs the point of thrill, so you can know when your hex is getting worked on, lmao, man..

Well that‚Äôs looks like a good meme tier connection
---
I mean.... I'd def side with you on this one, i don't like to noed camp and there's nothing wrong with gen rushing, but keep in mind Noed is meant as a "gen rush counter", if you wanted to take things slow you could break totems rendering noed useless. And camping is definetly reasonnable once exit gates are open.
---
exactly lol. I run thrill so i know when to go for my hex totem. Thrill isn't even considered a strong perk, crying about it is ridiculous lol
---
That would be nice! Hopefully this is true üôè
---
You didn‚Äôt need to change Quentin‚Äôs picture he already looks old.
---
One time as killer, I was in a chase, and the survivor threw down a pallet on me. Once I wasn‚Äôt stunned anymore, he was sitting by a pallet about 2 meters in front of me. I‚Äôm pretty sure the pallet spawns are just broken
---
Seems like you‚Äôre heading down the negative route.
---
Its the equivalent of a teabag
---
The guy in red definetly deserves at least a week ban.
---
I'd go with this, gives Survivors who stay to tbag or something a good surprise. 
---
Good work Ginyu.
---
This is true of quite a few perks. I'd never run tier 1 Whispers for example, but I use tier 3 in pretty much every build. They need to rework the tier system entirely because it's the reason why the grind in the game is so bad.
---
I was the David in this picture &lt;3
---
That was amazing :3
---
(I also took the screenshot xD)
---
Good guy billy I guess 
---
Depending on the map it can still be pretty hard to protect the totem sometimes
---
let me guess, you were Camping them cause they used their "toxic" flashlights and teabagged?
---
Well, toxicity creates toxicity, some People just got to be above that to reduce the overall toxicity.
---
On topic: You could send the Screenshot of the Text to Support, without the blurred names.
---
Were they any good? How did u pull it off?
---
Nah nothing you can do about this kinda stuff, its only a problem if they're threatening you
---
Nah i just played a game where the killer targeted me the whole time. literally went out of his way to eliminate me. I can only do so much to escape .... using die hard, using every fucking pallet i can find. It‚Äôs annoying as hell.
---
Use it. Unless your not going far I would just use it. I like to run it with spine chill to put max distance between me and the killer before chase.
---
Oh yea definetly. I was lucky my hex totems were somewhat close and not much obstacle between each others, and even many gens close.
---
actually imagine wishing harm towards a persons family because of a dbd game
---
Not gonna lie I was guessing this was gonan happen but still threw my phone
---
Yeah
---
I actually just had a pretty wholesome moment with a noobie killer. Msg'd him gg and he says he was new. I could tell cause he didn't give me hatch or really interact with me at all when I kinda gave up (half my team killed themselves on hook) he asked what I meant by giving me hatch and I just kinda explained that if survivors DC or kill themselves it's nice to give the last person hatch (didn't yell at him for not giving me it mind you just simply telling him that it makes the game less toxic and less annoying to play random survivors.)
---
&gt; here‚Äôs no skill required to be the killer.
---
Play killer at red ranks....
---
Gotta love the ultra rare Amanda's Letter that is only useful on The Game (and even then it takes away a big portion of her playstyle, that of forcing survivors to waste time with trap boxes)
---
That's nice ( obviously not for the survivors though :D )
---
Dying by the day? lol look at the Player numbers, steady as always
---
Just started playing over the weekend did we? Maybe play for more than a couple of hours before deciding that you know everything there is to know about balance.
---
Ah well to me Whispers is a waste of a perk slot at all ranks, what is the use for it? I never have any trouble finding survivors at high ranks.
---
Bad game, period. Needs better balancing. I‚Äôve been as low as rank 5. same bs
---
you forgot the /s and shitpost flair
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why it was free once for PS plus? Usually means the games dying buddy.
---
well, you got outplayed. the Killer was better, what do you expect?
---
Played the game over a year. Next!
---
You forgot the /s and shitcomment flair on your headline
---
Dude....look at the actual Player numbers you genius. before jumping to weird conclusions smh

Nah, just useless mechanisms
---
Michael's naturally stronger than Ghost Toast due to the fact you can't break him out of stalk and has better add ons, but both Killers are fun to play. I personally wanna see Wraith, Michael, Piggy, &amp; Ghost Toast have a full out stealth brawl.
---
Who cares? I say that as a surv main, as long as you‚Äôre not cheesy and running NOED
---
I have another screenshot of him saying he has my IP and was going to "talk to me" at my house...
---
This game is dead. Based off numbers on twitch, reddit and Free for PS plus users. Stop trying to defend it
---
ye, if you cant grasp the concept of the game, uninstalling and maybe refunding is an Option...
---
I‚Äôm new to the game but I feel I do best with wraith. I‚Äôve played spirit and nurse, I kinda feel nurse is super skill based with her blinks, and the spirit is kinda the same, you have to guess where the survivors walk when chasing with her chase crap. I personally like the simple killers like trapper and wraith over nurse and spirit
---
Ignore and move on
---
I know it's not super intense to good players but it  was for me.
---
I got it free from PS plus last year. Imagine wasting money on an unbalanced game.
---
I was soft patrolling, he was baiting me near pallets by tbagging, and I was like "Okay guess I'll just make sure you die." First to die, 5-10 min match, stayed just to talk. Usually I'm above it but it was my last game of the night so I figured who cares if I camp a lill
---
I play on PS4 and main killer but I still play survivor from time to time but and I can say without a doubt that survivors are some of the most toxic people I have ever played
---
are you really that dumb? 
---
https://steamcharts.com/app/381210
---
look at  the numbers
---
There's so much happening in this clip lmfaooo, and the expression on Bill's face is the best part
---
They did, I just haven't posted that screenshot. What should I do ?
---
I have over 3,000 hours time played in this game. If you have ruin, NOED and you still camp, you need to play a higher tier killer or don't play killer at all lmao.
---
Whispers isn't good because it tells you where survivors are, it's good because it tells you where they aren't. The amount of time that Whispers can save you over the course of a match is significant and it allows you to always be pressuring survivors. The amount of information it gives is massive.
---
imagine, complaining cause you dont understand the game.
---
Good Night, I had my Fun in this Post
---
I am 50/50, cause I play on both sides. But camping at the end is necessary for securing a kill, even if it isn't favored by people. I know that gen rushing isn't a thing, but survivors also tend to make up their own rules, so killers make theirs as well. Tbh, i get more messages from survivors than killers and they are always really bad messages. Like death threats over a damn game.
---
 I do defend your side though, that it is the killer's fault for not applying pressure to people to not allow them to do gens. But at the end when a killer is camping for a kill, don't call them out for it, whether you escape or not, it just makes you and them mad at each other and creates enemies. If I'm being honest, I have seen and have let more survivors escape than i have seen survivors let killers get kills. Legit, I faced a Clown a week ago who got 0 kills, but he was amazing in chase and got us all 2 hooked. I felt bad for the dude and let him get a kill, but even in the process I had to force the dude to do it. He wouldnt take the kill and tried getting me out of the game via the exit gate. 
---
So I'm just saying that people need to stop messaging others about hate and that other bullshit and just say nice things about how they did, even if they wanted salt by camping or tunneling intentionally. It will make you more friends. Hell, I've made friends who have literally given me hatch before in a game where the randoms were absolute shit.
---
Self promo?
---
14,000 is a lot to you? LMFAOOO. 
---
Buddy, go look up IMVU. 
---
It‚Äôs a platform for perverts who talk to little girls. That has 100k + concurrent users online. Not to mention it‚Äôs a fucking I.M.
---
Me too and honestly that would be a huge QOL changer. I'd be down for that
---
Gen rush is used as a term for a team of survivors focusing entirely on gens. If someone gets hooked, they're still on gens. Their man focus is to get the gens done as fast as they can, even if that means letting someone go into struggle
---
Giving up already? Imagine thinking just because you‚Äôre ‚Äúdone‚Äù, you think you‚Äôre right. 
---
Goodnight nerd &lt;3
---
You are the one being petty here, why cry about him facecamping with noed? He literally asked you something as ridiculous as you did. Don‚Äôt pretend to be the bigger man here (plus you messaged him first) üòÉ
---
Forreal smh solo survivor drop ins are a nightmare. No pun intended.
---
Finally, someone with sense

click "submit a Ticket" and try your luck :D
---
Comments like that definitley deserve some sort of punishment
---
But it‚Äôs easier with swf
---
What the fuck? Why cant people just be civil its a game.
---
That would be hilarious XD
---
Are you talking about Halloween (2018)?
---
yes 14k at the *current Time* is alot at 6am in europe. Its Place 21 on the most played steam Games.
---
And I really dont want to know how you know about sites like that....
---
So basically it works.
---
How does this happen?
---
As someone who plays both sides (Primarily Killer because I think it's more fun), this Killer is pretty dumb. The main point of the Survivors are to finish gens, get the gate open, and leave. I hereby decree that this Killer is to no longer be identified with us, due to his small pp and entitlement
---
Tbh thats not an insult
---
Next! ^.^
---
Whats wrong with that? Toxic survivor mains acting like they are entitled to the hatch when the killer did something decently funny. You were caught, don‚Äôt act all pissy when he considered reducing his own chances at doing better for a good gag.
---
Whatever man, no one here cares.
---
its 6am and I just came from work. lol
---
whatever floats your boat, but ye Im "giving up" trying to Talk sense into you
---
If tunneling is what gives you a chance starting on your first hook, then you're probably off learning to play killer better... By not tunneling
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs wrong but now it‚Äôs just as common as butt dancing
---
Survivor entitlement never ceases to entertain me
---
Eh they brought the perk to meme
---
Yeah is that not allowed?
---
You‚Äôre commenting so.. you.. care? 
---
Moron.
---
Oh no a survivor pressed control rapidly and used a flashlight, WAht A FuckInG toxiC CunT
---
Mate, go to bed lol.
---
Its very frowned upon.
---
I'm hoping this is bait, but I've heard people be serious with dumber things
---
Paint it black?
---
My bad, I'll get rid of it
---
Wow that hurt. I dont know how I can recover. Im leaving the sub im so hurt.
---
Dude this was soooo funny. Yikes someone is a killer main. Whether you like it or not this is BM and if you consider teabagging toxic then this should be considered toxic
---
I see a red door I must have it painted black
---
Probably because you camped and tunnelled them. Survivors have so many tools to counter tunnelling? Like what besides Decisive Strike? It's not fair to have to use up all your perk slots to counter tunnelling.
---
Escaping may be easier, but nothing towards pipping changes. Do gens, unhook, and run the killer you're doing that no matter what. Only difference is its easier to find a heal.
---
Wraith: "shape"
---
The shape: *judgemental stare*
---
Could you not just leave it on youtube as unlisted and give them the link in the report instead of uploading it?
---
You can, can‚Äôt you?
---
Well its pre sad that you dont consider a skill less perk to not be an insult.
---
Oh this makes me think, what if they built maps meant for an 8v2, where it was two separated map sections with two doors between them.  4v1 on one side, 4v1 on the other side.  Once either: 1: 5 gens are done or 2: 4 survivors are dead, the 2 separating doors open automatically so everyone can cross sides now.  To survive you need to finish a full 10 gens (5 for each side but they can be powered on either side as long as 10 are done) and then make it out one of the 4 gates (2 per side) as per usual, or one of the 2 hatches (again 1 per side).  
---
Would be an interesting play style
---
Do you not know what that‚Äôs from
---
Borrowed time, decisive strike and then all the stuff others can do to save them.
---
No sry I‚Äôm Russian
---
It‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs from paint it black by The Rolling Stones
---
Nah. I've been having a good time with Trapper and Leatherface because I find them pretty fun. A lot of Killer mains focus on fun over winning
---
Your literally doing nothing but looking at a survivor if any survivor has an average iq they will deduce their best action is to repair generators generators take 80 seconds to complete so all 3 survivors do 1 generator and a sacrifice if they dont try to escape takes 2 minutes. If every survivor does 1 generator they finish 3 before the hooked person is even dead.
---
His Prestige mask has a bloody tear
---
Thank you. I sent them both screenshots. Of the actual threat and the mom comment
---
It's the mega killer troll from DbD, going in.
---
Okay so two perk slots have to be taken up for this and then everyone needs to bring flashlights and get involved to try and stop him from tunnelling, get injured themselves, or downed. Yeah that's totally not a big deal at all.
---
Ok
---
Damn sarcasm was horrrid xD
---
You think 14k is good... That‚Äôs a joke in itself lmaooo
---
If you look at it this way if the killer tries to chase someone who is looping away from a hook that means 3 survivors arent doing gens if 1 is going to rescue 1 is on the hook and 1 is being chased the killer is punished by missing out on that many survivors not repairing and gatekeeper BP
---
Its just killers who can keep pressure on survivors or spend to much time in chases
---
Ikr. But it‚Äôs only a pipe dream. There‚Äôs no way dreamworld would let that happen
---
I hope this isn't happy at the expense of others but I adore the way The Pig sounds when she's stunned. It is always so cute.
---
I'm sick of being slugged because the killer wants the 4k so damn bad. Its not fun to be on the floor until I bleed out! I dont care if I get out or not I just hate this stupid slug bs.
---
You Only have to blur them if you're trying to shed a bad light on them or slander, otherwise it's fine

Solid spelling. If you have a problem with the game then leave no one cares if you leave or stay. Your bitching makes you look like you've played for 8 hrs and got salty for being shitty at the game. No one cares, no dev is in this thread that willsay this guy is right and I'll change the game. Just leave my guy no one cares.
---
post is deleted keyboard warrior
---
A pirate or a zombie would be cool. There have been a lot of cool zombie fan builds on here that I think could be a great fit in the game.
---
People can find it unfun though
---
Yeah. A couple of fansites gave it that nickname, as if the film followed the H20 naming scheme, it would be H40, and the similar premises of the two.
---
I know, but just imagine how great it would be to hear that music or get jumpscared by a shrek Myers on Lery's XD Or how terrifying it would be to see Shrek holding his knife up as he is chasing you XD
---
Start of match tells you when your near a survivor. Last survivors alive being super stealthy? Now you know when you are close to them. Whispers is a solid perk, especially on a killer like Billy.
---
Just a teaser announcing the names without any new footage. Both films are being shot this fall, with one releasing October 2020, the other October 2021. *Halloween Kills* and *Halloween Ends* being the names of these two.
---
You're pretty good, I totally suck as suck as survivor
---
Oh okay!
---
Teabagging gives you no points theres 0 reason to do it but closing a hatch actually gives you BP and better emblems, teabagging is just pissing off the killer.

Im being honest with you. If you have such an issue then leave. No one is forcing you to stay. Unless you just like to bitch for some reason? Just leave, have fun playing better games. Or you can keep playing and stop bitching because most of us dont care.
---
I main Legion and pig and they both have terrible add ons, Legion slightly better than pig but still not great, except for the one that makes your terror radius map-wide.
---
Lol just great
---
Yea I get that killers are punished for toxicity, but we never look at how unfun it is for the guy getting face camped, like the killer is literally not playing the game so someone else doesn‚Äôt get to play the game.
---
i‚Äôm not even gonna read that m8 lol
---
As a Former Wraith Main I apologize for his behavior.
---
If you had a full squad with flashlights id use much worse things then ruin
---
Dropping the survivor near the hatch and then closing it is the toxic act here. The only reason to do that is to piss off the survivor.
---
I had someone say "get good, rank 13" while THEY were rank 13, after admitting that they've been "De-ranking for weeks"
---
I feel like I just gained a chromosome
---
I have the same thing as well. I was playing killer earlier and hitting every sweaty af swf in existence. So I figured well, I'll just play survivor then and at least I'll have good teammates.
---
NOPE. Got nothing but a bunch of people crouching on the other corner of the map while I die first hook... over and over again.
---
So you just wanted to bitch? You just wanted to post something get in random arguments with people? Im amazed how people like you function.
---
(still doesn‚Äôt read your comment)
---
That‚Äôs literally the name given to it on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and even the official Halloween website. Technically it would be *Halloween II* but they didn‚Äôt do that to avoid confusion, which they still did.
---
You could attempt to practice some leather work and make your own leather ghostface dustercoat. That would proabably cost a lot and take a bit of practice to do.
---
Tbh still more skill required then insta heals
---
Yeah but the game is not directly punishing them, they lose blood points but that poor suroivor( not if they are toxic) misses a shit ton of blood points and the fun experience of a game is ruined. And if your solo queue people don't give a shit if you die they foucse on themselves. Once again ruining the experience for you
---
2 lazy
---
I don‚Äôt even know why I made this post
---
Be wary that if the phasing Spirit still looks in your direction while going to the other side of the pallet the perk will stay lit up, giving you a false sense of security. So just watch out for that...
---
Oh I get it now!
---
Prettt good but you might need to change the numbers a little
---
What would you suggest changing the numbers to? I should clarify this is from the gate itself, not the map border that survivors cross over to escape, so it is a fair distance away already. If it is too far away from the gate it takes away the "nearly escaping" theme.
---
Official discord is ran by SJW's.
---
If i want to live in my totems i will live in my totems
---
This could be a new perk with leaving noed as is, to appeal to... well those who crutch with it.
---
It could be an obsession perk, kinda like remember me. Hitting the obsession gets you tokens for the perk that increases the range for each, and once it's activated, it works as you described, except the obsession isn't exposed. It could be very powerful with Rancor.
---
Yea this community is mostly a bunch of toxic pissed off children. I play on Xbox and get rage messages after nearly every game, everyone is so pissed at the players when really it‚Äôs the game they should be pissed about.
---
Yeah I don't care about that never did never will do what u want I teabag I teabag as killer too I bag at the pallet I bag at the exit I don't give a shit I also close the hatch so no1 escapes and give a good ol baggin session If they see me do it üëç
---
Couldn't agree more. We need another discord.
---
I only ever play with friends to have fun. I'm not a tryhard at all. Hell Dream Reaper was waiting near the hook to unhook SlayingAces even if I said to do gens
---
Finally found him? After he looped you all game?
---
You shouldn‚Äôt dc, you get bloodpoints even when you die. Leaving the game before dying results in no bloodpoints. It‚Äôs better to sit there and get tunneled and lose and die than to Dc. Believe me, I get camped and tunneled all the time, it sucks but free points is free points. It makes that match not a complete waste of time lol
---
you need a blanky and a nap
---
Oh that's a super cool idea! I never thought to link the obsession mechanic with NOED. So as you put it the more you whacked your obsession throughout the match, the further the range of which you can lock down the gates and expose survivors.
---
I got hooked before even finishing a gen so really not enough points to even stay. Normally I would stay if I feel I‚Äôll at least stay neutral but I was gonna de pip for sure anyways why waist the time
---
Well, what chapter from the "survivors rulebook for killers" describes how the killer should act?
---
I got the hook so I damn well deserve some pressure for it.
---
I don't camp hooks but higher rank survivors are just so damn cocky. They'll run after me clicking lights and keep repairing gens next to me while I'm carrying someone to the hook and now I just have to walk away?
---
when and will there be another blood hunt?
---
I don't think so because at the bottom of the ticket it wants you to attach the file. Their is no space for supplying a link. Its really frustrating and making me want to give up reporting.
---
I've had a Hillbilly do this to me but he was completely unaware of me having a key and adrenaline as well. The most satisfying end result on top of salty messages received.
---
You gotta show people his name and nobody else so if anyone sees him he gets it
---
I'm not, but I started playing near launch, so I have much less faith in the devs than most.
---
Fair enough. If I was in that position I‚Äôd still stay either way. Saves me like a single blood web node of grinding lol
---
"One year ago", has pipping changed?
---
Either way.  5 solo gens and a save should be worth more than sub 3k BP of running the killer.
---
You know what you do to those teams? Down one. Hook his ass, and stand right fucking there until that bastard dies. Sure you‚Äôll achieve nothing in terms of success in the game, but you‚Äôll stick it to those pesky survivors!
---
&gt;That‚Äôs literally the name given to it on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and even the official Halloween website.
---
I know, H40 was the nickname given by fans when it was first announced. I used this nickname because H40 is easier to fit onto a meme than Halloween (2018) as it is called on the [official website]( https://halloweenmovies.com/films/).
---
Thank you for that laugh. I'm dying over here haha
---
I find add ons a legit part of the game. Purple and pink add ons are stressful but legit. Swf with comms  not so much. I consider it straight up cheating.
---
What‚Äôs that pink sacrifice? I‚Äôm a relatively new player when it comes to killers.
---
Send the ''report'' and evidence to BHVR through support
---
But you shouldn't worry too much, IP doesn't let people pinpoint your exact location, he's going to have a very tough time ''talking to you'' at your house if he even leaves his house at all
---
Still I hope he gets a nice ban
---
Do a search for 'discord' on this subreddit. You'll see the mods clearly have mental issues.
---
Sometimes this breaks survivors because they get so thristy for the save that they suicide bomb the hook and all get slugged in the process.
---
Strictly speaking, using a third-party program to gain an advantage not intended by the game design is cheating. It's just very common cheating the devs should have accounted for long ago.
---
Lol ...what? Are you suggesting that the T-bagging doesn't count because he didn't know the killer could see his aura?
---
Yeah, and then you are a god amongst men üòÇ
---
Well I'm glad being in the minority gives you the opportunity to be self righteous.
---
Yes, of course doing everything is better than one thing.  What I'm saying is looping/aggressiveness is more rewarding than slow playing/hiding.
---
This man is not a killer. If you play survivor once and want to do it again your impure and become nice. If you do not despise being survivor you are a survivor. This man is not a killer.
---
Did you lose again?
---
Yesss we need some love for Laurie her current outfits ehhh...low-key kinda suck
---
You should do everything, but you are rewarded more for getting chased and going for unhooks.  You get big games when you combine it all.
---
Thank goodness text chat isn‚Äôt on the ps4 version.
---
If the killer has thrill of the hunt, I will keep tapping the totem and hiding while other survivors do gens
---
Use mori I use belt+iri heads if they wearing the same clothes
---
Lol. I rarely lose a game. I just want to play a chill game for once and actually worry about getting outplayed and not outmapped,perked and items.
---
No offense, but I doubt that. Whay do you play on and what killer(s) do you play?
---
I usually change to Billy, Spirit or Nurse when I am absolutely sure that it is a squad.
---
I unhook at any cost.
---
I also die very quickly as Survivor.
---
But that means I make sure to set my item finds down for others.
---
For which there is no reward so I should probably stop.
---
if you don‚Äôt own the DLC for that killer, you can find an offering from a non-DLC killer‚Äôs bloodweb. for example: if i don‚Äôt buy freddy, i can use bloodpoints in a random killer‚Äôs bloodweb and come across a pink offering that allows me to play as freddy for one game (when i use that offering). sorry if this explanation isn‚Äôt the best lol
---
This. It's why I stay around green ranks. It gets super repetitive and predictable after that. I like seeing unique perk builds. Sometimes I'm like why TF? But a lot of times I'm like hmm that was an interesting build. Purple and red it's ruin noed etc. Idk I just find green rank matches more exciting.
---
literally one of the gens on that map alerts the killer for a full 30 seconds that its been finished, how is it op?
---
Ah, yes the build that requires two perk slots and will maybe get you one extra hit per match, sometimes two. Definitely a "basic bitch" build
---
/s
---
Shitty people never get tired of being shitty. It all comes down to who can be the shittiest.
---
I don't really give a shit what you doubt. I am at devotion 6 and play all the killers pretty well considering I have all p3 killers(besides GF because I am sick of P3ing now.) I play PS4 mostly but I am starting to play on PC and XBOX.
---
Best Billy drawing I've seen and probably will see.
---
You can find his IP address and punch his face, but that would be ILLEGAL
---
Tbf, those came out before Meyers and we're probably thinking of Wraith.
---
Maybe he was better than you. 
---
Go play killer and see how easy it is against good survivors.
---
If they‚Äôre having problems with you camping your totems then they should‚Äôve just gen rushed. Why would they waste time trying to get totems if you‚Äôre just gonna camp it. That‚Äôs free gens right there.
---
The adrenaline of knowing there is a psychopath trying to kill you would keep you going
---
You Marked Out Your Name On The Board But Not On The Top Right
---
Imagine being so salty u dm the killer. Just take the L and play another game u twat
---
It really is like that in this game. Survivors use all kinds of bullshit but if the killer uses Prayer beads, Insta hatchets, instasaw or some other really strong add ons they DC.
---
Add a "edgy people calling out both sides" to the top of the metronome and you've nailed it. [Shitpost]
---
Running Ruin and Thrill on speedy boi is a waste of 2 perk slots imo, but my god he‚Äôs a whiny tuck
---
But they haven't added Fox McCloud as a killer yet so going to FD is pointless
---
Oh ok sorry i thought you ment the door
---
Jokes on you sugartits I play Killer mostly.
---
I don't know, that was his exact reply when I asked him why he had to tunnel us when we didn't provoke any toxicity lol. I assume he had a bad day with his clown main and took it out on us
---
Another shit tier survivor main who can't handle skill checks or Ruin. Imagine my shock.
---
Wait if you‚Äôre overprotective of your totems doesn‚Äôt that mean free gens for them?
---
People find lots of things unfun. It‚Äôs not my job to make the game fun
---
They likely make anti loop because most people nowadays just run around like headless chickens, so if you make a killer who has nothing for a chase you'll have another Freddy and it likely won't sell. At least Freddy had the draw of it being Freddy, but another killer like that wouldn't have that draw AND would be ignored due to how much Freddy suffers.
---
Don't forget Adrenaline
---
A lot of ppl rely on it so bad so that‚Äôs prob why honestly. With NOED you really do not have to improve as killer
---
When there too much drama at the Red Forest, all you have to do is walk üé∂ AwAyAyAy üé∂
---
Honestly this is one of the first good representations of a good change. I'm not sure if I agree with blocking the gate for all survivors though. I like it activating from the gates so it makes the gates intense. I think a lot of the hate with NOED is how it can change the whole game in an instant and this could instantly lead to a 4k if you had the team protecting a survivor or something.
---
I think the conditional needs to be the last two survivors or something like that the gate gets blocked. It turns the ending if theres 3 or 4 people into everyone is scrambling to be the first one out. Which solves the complaint of survivors not leaving.
---
What did he say?
---
Yea right? Like, what's Object of Obsession, right??
---
This is a perfect example as to why you should never bm and always leave when you have the chance. Getting trapped by blood warden is pretty much game over. The ds into rancor was just icing on the cake.
---
I don‚Äôt know!!
---
Fair enough, but by definition that sounds boring
---
Nea basically looks the same
---
I've found some very powerful perk loadouts for killers people think are low-mid tier. No I'm not elaborating, I don't want the BHVR fun police to fuck it up.
---
Because that makes you part of the problem. Stop coming here if you hate it so much.
---
In regards to the example you gave in the first paragraph; If 4 survivors were in the exit gate waiting for the killer to come over, the killer would most likely only have enough time to hit one, or at most two survivors. As soon as one was downed instantly, the others would realise what happened and run back into the map to try and either find the hex or open the other door. The killer can only block the exit they are currently at remember!
---
Adding a counter would be welcomed in random survivor matches so you know what to expect.
---
I handle her just fine it‚Äôs all about mindgame and outsmarting your opponent
---
Damn, Responding to a post 3 months old, you must seriously have some issues
---
Freddy's PTB had dulls reward 1k boldness. It's not like boldness is hard to max if you're decent at looping but that's still a lot of emblem score for a tiny bit of your time.
---
If the other 3 survivors are not swf don‚Äôt expect them to do totems just because you‚Äôre getting chased
---
Doing both at the same time would be the fastest way
---
Omg pyramid head,
---
I've missed him so much and haven't seen him in ages
---
Such a stupid idea. THIS IS A HORROR GAME. Why the fuck would you add Shrek? Or TMNT? Are you 4 years old or some shit what the hell is wrong with you? You might as well add lollipops and rainbows and fortnite skins too.
---
I have issues because i searched "discord" to find discords to play on? Uh... okay. sure buddy.
---
Get one surv with WGLF and good perks you like, and play them to get BP for others. Then level people for perks you want. If you see something in shrine you want buy it otherwise just get more characters. It's a grind and a half to do, one I haven't completed with almost 2k hours in game, but it could probably be done faster with less prestiging and killer leveling.
---
Dump him.
---
i just started dating him and i already have to do this
---
dam :(
---
Tell your dad he did an awesome job! We need more!
---
Well, if you wanna date a guy who's a fan of a rapist/child molester. By all means, stay with him.
---
Lol, chill bro, it's a suggestion. Besides, I'd rather have fun skins than having a Huntress with her boobs shown or shirtless Myers or a David with his dong hanging out. Also, I am 3 thank you very much. Maybe read up on me before you assume my age lol
---
It's for your own good I guess :/
---
I do like the single gate block which is nice. I'm thinking of a situation that happens pretty often when a killer is camping at EGC and 3 ppl rush the hook and take protection hits. Then essentially all 4 are running into the gate together. This would demolish them by waiting to hit until you get in there. I'm just trying to play devils advocate.
---
Tbh anything would be a welcomed change for NOED. When I first started I used NOED and had the same "just do totems" thought then after hundreds of hours as killer I wanted to play with my brother as survivors and realized how ridiculous the perk is. I havent used the perk since playing both sides and understanding how annoying it is to be on the other side.
---
exactly. and he says XD so thats already a red flag
---
There‚Äôs five of those things?
---
You‚Äôre a fucking idiot
---
Oh... You weren't tagging along to the song.
---
I usually want to secure wins and I'm not here to waste time so I've never done this before and I don't see why I should. (Hook hitting is enough. üòâ) I might walk over to it's location if it's not far and you're not moving.
---
Ah good ole Ninja Freddy, haven't lost a single game yet running Paint Brush and M&amp;A.
---
wasting the killer's time isn't a waste
---
Decisive is a legitimate perk, he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù anything lol killer killer him, that‚Äôs that.

If you t bag your wasting miliseconds that can be spent running away its so little time taken unless you really want to anger the killer. If you face camp you spend a grand total of 2 minutes and if survivors have enough brain cells to deduce they should repair gens the killer would lose 3 generators and kill 1 survivor
---
First time I used a splinter was to play old Freddy once before his rework in interest of what it was like. Surprising 4ked at red ranks thanks to somewhat potato survivors.
---
Fun fact:
---
There is actually a playlist on spotify named "The Legion (DBD)" (more were created since i last saw), Which basically consists of songs that fit in the description of Mixtape addons.
---
I sometimes personally listen to one of these just to imagine playing as legion and trying to learn the game from my mind, like thinking about a loop and how to play around it. Either that or just stabby stabbings
---
That's a yikes I don't want to say dump him but if he acts cringy or emulates Ochido a decent amount then do it but for now I'd say wait.
---
Fyi the toxicity hardly benefits the killer, and how fun it is for the person being sacrificed is not a valid arguement.
---
he says billywhiskey and leatherina and says dud üòê i think im gonna have to put him down
---
You‚Äôre missing the point. He got what he deserved for t-bagging and not leaving when he could have.
---
He was risking it for more bloodpoints and/or to possibly help the other survivors escape, so healing and staying is the brave/nice thing to do! Yeah the teabag at the end though.. interpreted by most killers as toxic, interpreted by most survivors as gg
---
Yup, 5 dull totems each match. They‚Äôll be replaced by hex totems though if a perk was brought of course.
---
Fyi the survivor can do 2 things not attempt to escape and spam A and D
---
I have a problem where the game where invert my vertical aim and it pisses me off to no end. It‚Äôs happened about three or four times as both survivor and killer. 
---
I just usually set the controller aside until the game‚Äôs over. I can‚Äôt be bother to play the round if the devs can‚Äôt be bothered to fix this issue.
---
Smh true but it always sucks to die after getting chased all game, I‚Äôve learned to do totems when that happens
---
I personally think it is too strong because if the killer can just block the gates by standing near them, it would make getting out impossible. If you‚Äôre in a chase, it‚Äôs game over for you, even if you land a stun near the door he can still catch up, not enough to hit you, but to block the exit which can make it really easy for you to be trapped. I think that just makes it far too easy to just camp with survivors near the gate. With the end game collapse a killer can just stand near a gate and wait for the entity to kill the survivors. They can‚Äôt run away from the gate because theyre exposed so the killer would be able to down them with how close they are. If by merely standing in a gate, the gate gets blocked it just becomes way too easy to trap survivors, that‚Äôs my problem with it. Maybe if you make it so the killer can choose an exit gate to block for say 30 seconds at any time (and maybe increase the exposed range to compensate) I think it would be more fair
---
Does your dad play dbd? Cuz he seems like he enjoys his time playing. Unlike me. I stew in my hate for when somebody cleanses from plague when they havent even broken yet. Like stop killing me! (I have never DCd but i have raged in post game chat before for sandbaggers)
---
YIKES. Might want to dump him because that's kinda cringe but I'd say wait a little bit still and if it continues tell him he's really acting cringey.
---
"I rarely lose games" &gt;Complains about swf and survivor perks lmfaoüòÇ
---
Yeah, hopefully that‚Äôll get more players to actually cleanse totems.
---
No. I‚Äôve played all killers equally besides Billy. Would be lame to exclusively play one or two.
---
All killers can do that if they lunge at the right spot
---

Did you just said 2 new Halloween movies?
---
Tbf, killers perks are supposed to be stronger than survivor's perks. But i agree WGLF should get a buff, even if it's a small one
---
Considered a killer to some killers, flashlights. The only good addons are batteries and low am filament.
---
*laughs in Pig*
---
90-120
---
my biggest pet peeve is when someone is on the hook and as soon as you‚Äôre about to unhook them they kobe off the hook wasting all that time you spent going to them. i dont heal them or go for the unhook if they get hooked again. they‚Äôre dead to me at that point.
---
Yeah I get that, but it just feels so underwhelming compared to the killer version.
---
Thats not the point. DS isnt a problem and i never take it off when im playing survivor. He could of just left but instead he stood there and teabagged when he was rancor while she went after someone else.
---
I forgot that good people don't complain. Lol. I guess Truetalent, Marth88 and other good killers are also trash because they complain. I learned something new today, if you get good at something youbare no longer able to complain at all and if you do your skill is revoked. What a fucking clown.
---
Its been like that for a long time.
---
I was hoping for the location to be dedicated servers.
---
Stop bitching.
---
Must be a Corrupt Intervention buff.
---
I don't really understand this change. The whole point of the perk is to have a lower cooldown, with the max at 8 tokens. Why would you want to take that away? The whole point of the levels of STBFL is to lessen the downside of hitting your obsession, which you shouldn't be doing with STBFL on anyway.
---
Try hag once you get a bit more experienced, I consider her a fantastic killer without add-ons
---
i felt bad when i moried someone with 0 hours ingame
---
My SWF and I don't do that. We had a facecamping LF earlier and one of us sat our ass near hook waiting to get an unhook. If you're so mad about SWFs bring a mori or NOED. Not every SWF plays that way and a week after rank reset you don't get as many SWFs
---
If the killer chooses to just stand there for the entire time that's up to them to be a dick and hold the game hostage. The entire point of the EGC is so that can't happen for longer than 2 minutes. Also by the time the killer hits one survivor, the others could run back out into the map to try and find the Hex or the other door. It basically assures the killer will catch one of the survivors they are chasing up to a door.
---
Devils advocate: NOED isn't even one of the best perk choices at high ranks and this rework would effectively remove it from the meta. 
---
Neutering a perk that isn't OP isn't a solution.
---
Show me where I said you or any of the top tier players were trash. I'll wait :)
---
Um yeah, in the middle
---
We all have likes and dislikes. None of us will ever agree with something. 
---
Who cares if he‚Äôs a fan of someone as long as you can tolerate it and not care then that‚Äôs good. 
---
But if it gets to your or he acts extremely sketchy then yeah that would be a good opportunity to dump him. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt dump him over liking a  Youtuber. But if he in anyway acts like Ochido etc. then yeah that‚Äôs bad news. I don‚Äôt mean cringe wise I mean perv wise. 
---
But who knows he could just be a swell guy that just likes the videos that Ochido makes. Give him time to figure that out yourself.
---
Nurse Is Better
---
Yea, I am not saying your idea is bad. In fact, it might be a little too weak. I am just saying in general, the reason noed is frustrating is because solo queues suffer.
---
This is entirely the point of the perk though. It punishes survivors that think they are safe near the exit. It also punishes funnelling all survivors out of one exit together. This could even potentially make Wake Up! more meta as well, as it would help the other survivors out by knowing where the other door is for example. I appreciate the discussion by the way, it's nice to have a decent conversation about this.
---
That would explain a lot
---
he asks me to get freaky all the time but other than that hes just cringey
---
Teabagged for a second cause he was probably happy! He then was healing himself to possibly make a save so more people could leave, as a good survivor should. If we always assume the cause is toxicity, the community will never get improve. I for one teabag when I do something super amazing and make myself proud. Not because I‚Äôm showboating or being toxic, but because i just pulled off something amazing and there‚Äôs almost nothing else you can do to express that.
---
Not big on the prep' killers like Hag and Trapper.  I might pick up Plague, Spirit or Clown.
---
Yep, this is my getting all my adept killer achievements. I made sure to message them all and thank them. üíú
---
Yea, I 100% agree. The game used to be so much more difficult for killers. Now it is so much easier, yet they still complain most times. It is actually pretty crazy. Dedicated servers will be a wake up call for a lot of them who think they are good because they hit through pallets and over vaults. Unless BHVR messes everything up(they most likely will).
---
okay notes!
---
I don't play killer at all and I'm holding off prestiging.
---
Your rank 20 suggestion is invalid
---
1. Depending on your age that could be horrible if he‚Äôs serious 
---
2. If he‚Äôs serious well as long as you‚Äôre okay that‚Äôs fine (age matters). Consent always! 
---
3. As long as you can deal with his Cringe then that‚Äôs what matters. But if it gets annoying I‚Äôm sure you can politely ask him to stop being cringe or stupid.
---
This is a terrible take lmao. EGC is already extremely tilted in the killers favor. Last thing the game needs is even less time. Just cleanse them during the match.
---
Boy do i have news for you
---
Explains why I realise flashlights are balanced around the fact they have counter play. They also stop lunges and break Legion out of Frenzy for free. Anything else you need to be schooled on?
---
To get immersed as Jeff you gotta listen to Behemoth and Mayhem.
---
Every killer can be played with their base kit, even at rank 1, it is just more difficult.
---
That doesn‚Äôt change the problem of the killer being able to take the game hostage by standing in one area. He‚Äôd be able to get 2 downs most likely with them being one shots. And with no way to leave the situation, it would feel worse as a survivor because there is nothing you could do unless you run straight at the killer and try to 360 or dodge some other way just to put yourself back into the map. I think it‚Äôd be less fun to go against as a survivor
---
This is spot on! Would you mind inquiring how he nailed the intricacies of the chainsaw so much?
---
if surviors think tea-bagging is a ‚Äúgg‚Äù, they‚Äôve obviously never played against 4 survivors who are constantly tea bagging the entire game. i use to think tea bagging was a nice and okay thing when i first got the game but when i started playing killer it was just seen as a insult. surviors should just tell the killer gg after the games over.
---
What I usually do is submit the report and then leave the link to the YouTube video in the message thread
---
Like 500 hours in bud. Im a killer main though so always appreciate salt.
---
No survivor in the world above rank 18 think a teabagging means gg
---
Legion Is S-Tier
---
I agree. Doesn't really make sense why survivors need to lose a perk slot for extra bp. Should at least do something basic.
---
It means gg at the gate, not during chases and whatnot, AT THE GATE! I know survivors are toxic and I know killers are toxic. We all know it. But just look past it and start enjoying what a good game this is.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 7 survivor and it‚Äôs a gg when I do it at the gate, it‚Äôs also a ‚Äúthanks for a good game‚Äù and a ‚Äúthanks for letting me go‚Äù and that sort of thing. AT THE GATE
---
That is why noed is so frustrating. Because it makes the game, particularly at the lower ranks, so hard to play solo queue.
---
It's amazing and has a lot of details he is a really talented artist
---
tea bagging at the gate is still like tea bagging at a pallet. especially in a case like this. sure some surviors do it because they think it‚Äôs a good thing which is whatever but this bill stood at the gate, tea bagged with every chance to escape and still decided to stay and tea bag. i‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs toxic or a bad player for it but tea bagging is not a sign of ‚Äúgg‚Äù to killers and is more like ‚Äúggez baby killer, you suck‚Äù
---
If you see it that way then whatever man, but in every game ever it's for disrespect towards your opponent
---
He‚Äôs a killer main that‚Äôs y lol he will always want to make the game favor the killers and survivor mains will try to make the game in favor of survivors.
---
Should.... should we tell him?
---
EGC isn't supposed to net you free kills. They only added this feature so killers weren't forced to sit in a match for several minutes after it was already over.
---
It is quite sad how you have. To publicize the fact that you rarely lose which is most likely false
---
yea its bad im probably gonna cut ties, thanks for ur relationship advice on r/deadbydaylight üòé
---
okay
---
I‚Äôll be the one to ask. How/Why the fuck is that guy‚Äôs name being brought up? You meet through DBD or something?
---
It is tf
---
Who gonna tell em
---
3 Totems cleansed brings the timer to what it is now, more cleansed would actually increase the time for EGC making it less tilted to the killer. It helps prioritize totems (solo or SWF either way helps the NOED situation), helps the killer if people don't do them and potentially gives the survivors more time to escape at the end. 
---
What's wrong with any of that?
---
I'm guessing this is a shit post
---
Why is Decisive Strike here the only reason it would be in effect is if you tunnel making you not a good killer
---
Are you stupid? You said that I complained and implied that I must lose a lot to complain, I then flipped that argument by saying that the top players also complain so they must lose a lot as well.
---
It‚Äôs one thing if it‚Äôs because of deliverance it‚Äôs another if it‚Äôs an actual 4% because why not you‚Äôre getting save anyways before struggle ether you get off or get saved no need to get salty but if a survivor is being stupid or just memeing than completely understandable.
---
Not even the entity's realm can contain Ash Williams
---
yessir we met on dbd
---
You are joking right? How many times does a killer dc when their hex gets cleansed early? How many times do killers dc when 2 or 3 gens pop with no hook? Maybe you have never played survivor but I would say both sides are equally as prone to dc.
---
Are you pressing the I key, the select button, or the pad on the controller?
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm sorry for you. 
---
I usually never shame people for their likes but I think that O dude is quite the ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù.

I'm guessing you dont mess with totems and complain when the killer has NOED.
---
hes a special character tbh
---
So what‚Äôs with letting him open gate then downing him? We just ignoring that part?
---
That is a really stupid argument. I can down two teammates and be across the map, run into the same survivor and still get ds. If someone chases me to the hook and unhooks in my face, why would I not punish that person? If a person with DS is trying to bodyblock a hit because they know there is no risk.
---
I get what you are saying. It definitely sucks to play against the same builds every match, especially with comms. At the same time tho, it is equally as frustrating to go against killers with pink/purple add ons and moris. Imagine solo queuing against a belt/iri head huntress with a pink mori. Not very fun. Goes both ways.
---
nah actually thank u, im just saying this is the worst platform to give advice. but yes thank u
---
Good luck with him. 
---
Remember that ignoring red flags usually doesn‚Äôt end well for the ignoree.
---
Yup. Because my whole point of the post was clearly to gloat about how I win so much. It wasn't because someone called into question my skill in the first place. You got me.
---
You could down someone from across the map?
---
I play survivor a lot. I have noticed more of a trend with teammates Dcing there as well.
---
We knew you were a killer from your suggestion alone, you didn't have to tell us.
---
Yeah man ruin too
---
I just see it as people being cocky. It feels like I'm being insulted.
---
it‚Äôs really fun game, servers are full, good luck with the toxicity man
---
Literally my last 3 matches
---
Bond and self care, you can‚Äôt always rely on others to heal you and other people‚Äôs aura can suggest different things that can help you.
---
I do understand that. I was just pointing out a pattern as killer because I play that slightly more. Now the whole subreddit is trying to bully me for pointing out my own personal expereinces.
---
You Don't get my point my friend
---
Leatherface he has so many good perks and you could do so many perk builds with him.
---
Because that is totally what I said. I said that I could be across the map from where the unhook was, down 2 people there pretty quickly, run into that same person and still get DS.
---
Idk how expecting 3 totems to be cleansed per match is a problem. People say cleanse totems to handle NOED but hardly anybody does. Maybe instead of hating for the sake of it you could throw out a idea to make totems more valuable?
---
Is your point that lack of one?
---
You said quite the opposite my friend and also it was a joke if you did not understand
---
The counterplay is to look up lol. It is alughable how easy flashlights are to counter, literally no work really needed to put into it.
---
This is a horrible idea because what this guy said. This is a massive buff to noed because you literally can't escape. Its rare the killer isn't right on your tail at the exit.
---
Downvoted for 'toon'
---
Yea i play both but do play more survivor and I think egc is already way slanted towards killers.
---
You put "lol I rarely lose a game" the fact that you put that is why I made my comment
---
i‚Äôm a ghost face like this. but sometimes my darker side takes over and i start murdering all my new friends. watching them scramble as they realize they‚Äôre happy serial killer has begun stabbing the ever living shit out of their poor dwight. and then after i‚Äôm done hunting them all down i stare at my bloody ghost face hands and realize what a monster i am and tell them sorry after the game is over.  but yeah i like teabagging with my survivior friends.
---
Yes but that does not explain why he can run into chairs without being stunned.
---
Hitbox glitch I guess
---
Yeah. Because most people who try to insult someone also joke with them in the same argument. Nice social skills.
---
if im literally right next to you and 1 second from unhooking you after running from across the map to save you(you see me tun to you since your on hook) why would you try and kobe? ill tell you why people do it, they‚Äôre selfish. its honestly quite rude really when you kobe just to get the 1000 bloodpoints. i could have been doing a gen or something but nah i wasted valuable time running all the way to you for you to say ‚Äúf it‚Äù and try for kobe. i get nothing for running all the way to you and on top of that the killer is probably on his way now since he‚Äôs notified of the unhook so all i got from running over here is a potential smack with  a machete. you get 1000 blood points tho.
---
Lobby is somehow more GPU-intensive than trials. I see higher loads and temperatures there
---
How was what I said in any way insulting?
---
I'm sitting over here just praying every night for shirtless Myers
---
Nice anti troll perks
---
I only said that because someone tried to make it me seem like I lose a lot of games. I guess you can't defend yourself online.
---
Which killer is this? I don‚Äôt recognise
---
Generators used to take 70 seconds to complete but now take 80, healing speed used to be 12 seconds but is now 16, hooks used to never respawn and now respawn after 3 minutes, exhaustion used to go down when you ran, double pallets used to be everywhere and now there might be the occasional double pallet on certain tiles, which I‚Äôve only seen twice in the past few months. 
---
While I do think survivors are still a little too strong, survivors have in fact been directly nerfed and they aren‚Äôt nearly as strong as they used to be.
---
Youre alughable.
---
I mean...does anyone? The fun part of this game is playing against different types of killers and different types of survivors and  builds, I don't like playing basically the same exact team 4 times in a row, it becomes boring. Do you think people all want to play the exact same top tier killers every game? I play all the killers, but I totally understand why most people want to play those killers just to have a better chance.
---
It just depends on how many people are online.
---
Same, just if the timer ever gets low enough and the survivor is dead on hook, just perfect opportunity.
---
Kate looks like Ree Drummond, "The Pioneer Woman" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yes, but normally it is much quicker
---
How hard is it to literally take your right stick on console and push it up. You can still see the survivor too while negating any blind. Doesn't really make sense lol. "I can still see you but you can't shine light in my eyes". Like I said, laughable. Just a killer who can't admit some mechanics are very easy to counter at the moment and need adjustment.
---
For no add-ons Id go clown since he has a way to manipulate loops. However spirit is the better of those  2 killer but I'm not good with spirit either sooo....
---
Im completely fine with facing the same builds because it lets me learn to counter them and if I play the killer a lot I must enjoy it
---
That‚Äôs why when there‚Äôs a low player count on your server there will be longer matchmaking.
---
&gt;Is it just me or are killer and survivor wait times rather long for anybody else.
---
&gt;It seems some days its fast matchmaking then other days its like a 5 to 10 minute wait
---
Thought this was obvious but apparently it isn't. Lobbies queue time vary according to region (NA, EU, OCE, SA) and time of the day.
---
At certain times there will be a lot of killers trying to play the game with not enough survivors and vice versa. This is also the reason why lobbies are terrible during new killers release or events, more people trying to play killer. 
---
In my region lobbies are instant (less than a minute) right now.
---
Cloen is addon dependent sadly.
---
Oh yeah there's that too.... well thank fuck the entity doesn't exist in real life heh
---
Nah... I just focus on repairing gen and escape from the gate.
---
Exactly.
---
BHVR: "survivors are complaining about camping and tunnelling ruining the game"
---
"Here is a perk to stop that"
---
They don't test their own game is what the problem is. I am convinced they just add shit to the game and go "yea that looks cool".
---
I just said that becomes boring with those groups, it obviously wouldn't be boring If I still needed to learn the counters for them. I do enjoy playing killer(somedays more than others) but I also enjoy variety.
---
&gt;Is leaving or asking someone to leave to escape through the hatch toxic or pathetic?
---
Neither. Escaping through hatch nets you extra 2k points on objective so if you couldn't spend a lot of time repairing because the killer was chasing you, hatch escape is always a great idea.
---
Ah, i see.
---
I have been playing for nearly 3 years now and did not know it is region locked
---
Well yeah, i guess its more than just a bit.
---
See all is well I get the 1k bp /s I get its frustrating but hey what can you do I try not to hold it against survivors I need them to survive so I can survive strength in numbers and all that
---
&gt; Ah, i see.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I have been playing for nearly 3 years now and did not know it is region locked
---
It isn't region locked, which is why some times you'll end up in lobbies with 250ms+ ping but, it does have region preference.
---
I still usually play with bad connection, I have not DC'd once in my life (besides the time I got stuck in a hook and the killer couldn't hit me so it was me or him, so I decided to not stand there forever and DC'd, does that count?)
---
You‚Äôre almost 5 years late bud
---
0 seconds- starts generator
---
5 seconds- survivor A gets hooked
---
7 seconds- survivor A gets unhooked
---
8 seconds- survivor B gets downed
---
12 seconds- survivor B gets hooked
---
13 seconds- survivor B gets unhooked
---
14 seconds- survivor B gets downed
---
16 seconds- survivor A gets downed
---
20 seconds- survivor C gets downed
---
~45 seconds- 2 survivors hooked and third being carried to a hook
---
10/10 IGN would play with randoms again.
---
I think he means someone disconnecting from the match, possibly when slugged, to open the hatch faster for a teammate. If so, I would say that if it is done against a toxic killer, camper, tunneller, etc. Then go for it. I have done it before to deny a 4k for someone who is playing like an ass. If you just do it to do it then I would say it is a bit much.
---
I hope dedicated servers fixes this problem
---
Yep.
---
Even without the ultra rare addon you still have to take into account in every chase, compared to a generic powerless M1 killer, if nobody ever cleanses, I only have to hit them once instead of twice, which cuts chases short considering the Wraith/Doctor/Pig/whatever has to M1 them into injured state, giving them a speed boost while the killer slows down to do the cooldown animation, catch up to them, and M1 them again. 
---
There's also stuff like hearing the coughing and vomiting, or disease clouds allowing me to catch survivors I wouldn't have noticed otherwise. I have a hearing impairment and was able to hear a survivor coughing in a locker which is something I wouldn't have ever caught otherwise. Not even Iron Will or Calm Spirit can muffle the coughing and vomiting, which is another disadvantage to remaining sick.
---
Ive discovered that the tall grass on The Game, is absolutely legendary for beartraps, also your advice was super helpful, cheersüçªü§úü§õüçª
---
I kinda don‚Äôt know how to respond to this but nice?
---
If you don‚Äôt want to be slugged use no mither lol
---
Worked on 2 gens, survivors kept running to the basement and hiding in lockers like potato‚Äôs, then asked for my teammate to give me hatch because the killer was slugging. Then I preceded to get called pathetic, a noob, and blocked. And to top it all of the killer and my teammate were teaming to find me.
---
In my experience, Whispers is good on any killer, but especially those who have ways of dealing with pallets other than just tanking them with their face, and those that have especially poor map pressure. I think that the Spirit and the Huntress are two of the best killers in the game it utilize its effects.
---
Same with Fortnite, at least used to be that way. What happens is they make a game for pc, try to take it to console, and don't optimize it for the console so it doesn't work correctly. Basically lazy ass devs not giving a shit about making a good game.
---
Bless your heart
---
Sometimes a dark deed has to be done. I hope you at least had insidious. Also it's better to hold the chainsaw
---
 I‚Äôm not saying this is a fantastic idea that Behavior should implement, but this would be a step in the right direction for all of the bitching and moaning over NOED. I only play solo survivor and while I don‚Äôt go out of my way to destroy every totem, if I run across one I‚Äôll at least knock it out for the hell of it. Hell, the killer having Ruin pretty much automatically gives you a free ten seconds; that shit is getting broken.
---
 I ask you this: what if they kept the current time and added 10 seconds for every totem broken during the match? Would it still be a waste of time, or do you think the extra time would be useful for helping that unlucky bastard who is still in the game get unhooked?
---
That where you‚Äôre wrong Bucko. One of Wraiths add ons makes it to where you can‚Äôt hear his bell and another one makes it to where his red mark doesn‚Äôt appear for 6 seconds. Scared the shit out of me when he came around the corner and pulled me off the generator.
---
This community seems toxic all around. Why?
---
yeah i get what you‚Äôre saying it just gets under my skin is all lol ill keep what you said in mind next it happens.
---
Stake out, while not being an amazing perk (stealth killers make it almost useless), is still pretty serviceable as a ruin counter, though I‚Äôd recommend trying to hit only great skill checks. I‚Äôm still not very great at that but I land a decent amount of them. 
---
And as others have said, small game is very good for finding totems to break them, I used to run it all the time. My favorite memory is going against a bubba with all hex perks (ruin, devour, thrill, and haunted). I found every single totem lol and the haunted went off while he was chasing an injured survivor so he didn‚Äôt get to use it. Very situational perk but very satisfying when you find hexes.
---
He is right. EGC is so survivors can't take endgame hostage. In its current state it already nets a ton of free kills for killers as well as encourage slugging toxicity.
---
That should work then, not sure why it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd ask one of the mods.
---
This is such a freaking wholesome DBD meme
---
Corrupt Intervention tier 100: the 6 generators furthest from where you start the trial levitate in the air for 90 seconds. If a survivor is standing within a 4 meter radius of the generator when it returns to the ground, they are immediately crushed and sacrificed.
---
It is!
---
&gt;I hope dedicated servers fixes this problem
---
Not really. You can't fix low population. 
---
The only thing servers will change is the killer having the option to play with high ping if he chooses to play against you in your region. Other than that, you will have to wait until there is a killer available if you want to play with low ping.
---
So if survivors want extra time at endgame, a feature that already buffs the shit out of killers, they have to take haunted grounds on the chin intentionally? Lol sure.
---
I dont think that'll stop someone who wants the 4k.
---
I mean, you won‚Äôt get slugged
---
Yes. Yes he did. But kudos to him for not DC:ing to top everything off. At least he took his punishment like a man.
---
Honestly if they just added a doorway near the infinite window on Ironworks it‚Äôd be so much more balanced. If not killer-sided
---
Someone forgot to use internet explorer to download chrome instead
---
The killer allowed him to open the gate, and then hit him to go hook him, but he had ds so he was able to escape. The killer doing that is already by, far more bm than what teabagging is. Bill did nothing wrong here
---
&gt;Same with Fortnite, at least used to be that way. What happens is they make a game for pc, try to take it to console, and don't optimize it for the console so it doesn't work correctly. Basically lazy ass devs not giving a shit about making a good game.
---
Jokes you on, DBD isn't optimized for PC either.
---
Ok , you are probably new to the game since you think they have never been nerfed.
---
Most infinites are now gone, pallets dont spawn 5 ft from each other anymore, exhaust was added, killer now has bloodlust, brand new part is trash now, gens can be hit, hooks respawn
---
Rancor - 1 hit...
---
There no sixth survivor the fifth survivor is pig
---
A streamer that doesn't watch other streamers? This has been around awhile.
---
Until you get a skill check 2 seconds later and it blows the gen because the menu won't close because it lags out the console half the time when a game is running
---
For bloodwarden
---
Honestly, bill did nothing wrong here. Killer pretends to let him escape, downs him and goes to hook him, but bill has ds, both saving and unknowingly killing him. If the clip was to cut there, I would call that karma because the killer was bm, and the survivor escaped. Bill didn‚Äôt know about the rancor because of the obsession change, so he has no way of knowing he should leave. 
---
People here acting as if they never teabag when they have a toxic killer, smh.
---
Bill was not the Obsession at first. He became the Obsession after using DS.
---
i didnt expect the ds bc its low ranks and no one had ds'd me yet, he used his dead hard to commit and i had bw so i had wanted to just let him open it and proc bw that way but it worked out better than i had thought
---
I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE
---
? XD
---
I bet you dont even play this game haha.
---
It is suppossed to give you black pip, not depip or +1
---
Well you probably playing kill your friends then you get every perk and if you go back to the normal game you only have the perks that you unlocked and the perk that shows the killer when he breaks a pallet is called alert and it‚Äôs a fend min perk from the spark of maybes dlc.
---
Everyone has just cut that bit from their mind lol, bill did nothing wrong.
---
im not even a pig main im a survivor main, the karma was for tbagging me are u ok
---
Deliverance rank 4
---
The lore on that page does absolutely nothing to support your ideas.
---
Love it
---
I was worried about the same thing too when I started but fear not there are plenty of players at least on PC, I assume it's the same on console. Just be prepared the community can be hella toxic at times. You'll start out at rank 20 and most people are pretty cool until you reach about rank 14 and after that you'll for sure run into some shitheads. My advice is to just play how you want and ignore the salt, because people will give you shit no matter if you're a tryhard or a casual. I wouldn't let the toxic community prevent you from getting the game though it is really fun, just wanted to forewarn you about it so you're not surprised.
---
YOU may think it means that, but it is widely accepted as a taunt to the killer. I know I see it as a middle finger, especially when i got looped all game.
---
Then they are even lazier than I could have ever imagined.
---
Nah.
---
you aren‚Äôt a clown, you‚Äôre the entire circus
---
 You don‚Äôt have to? Hell, Haunted Grounds isn‚Äôt even that good of a perk and I rarely see it on any killer. I never use it while playing killer and for over half of survivor matches that it gets destroyed in, the killer only manages to down one survivor and that‚Äôs usually near the ends of it‚Äôs proc. And that also usually happens near the beginning and they are usually ruining Ruin, too. 
---
 Also, why does everyone think end game so buffed for killers? Setting up a hook rescue when solo is already attempted suicide as it is, a SWF can pull it off rather easily and is usually the best route, and if you are getting hooked in the last two minutes then you A.) should not having been dicking around with the killer like 95% of SWF and toxic survivors or B.) fucked up when trying to run the killer, and you shouldn‚Äôt be so salty over fucking up because that shit happens to the best of us. A majority of the time I die during end game is when I get hooked and the rest of the team just leaves me to die, so from my experience it wouldn‚Äôt change anything anyway.
---
It took me too long to find GhostFace
---
Too much fanart of them happened and it became the dev's headcannon.
---
Please fuck off and uninstall the game then.
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate (the bad connection part) but respectable. Most people do leave with really unplayable ping because of the way P2P systems work, giving the killer a major advantage.
---
Agree with you 100%,I would‚Äôve automatically dc‚Äôd. I‚Äôve played with tons of low rank baby survivors and quite frankly I‚Äôve never seen them waste the god pallet like this.
---
I don't know what anyone on this thread is talking about. I play this game almost every day and I never know what anyone is talking about. I don't know what perks are toxic, or how a game mechanic could be considered toxic. I never teabag, but when people do it to me I think it's funny and don't get why it's toxic. Why is everyone always bitching? Survive or kill and just have fun.
---
I'm glad you see it my way.
---
Its impossible to do if you're flashing at a pallet because you're animation locked. It's also impossible while going through a window or picking up a body because again animation lock. 
---
If you're trying to flash a killer while they arent animation locked then you deserve to get downed.
---
BHVR have tried for ages to balance loops which is why they're redoing maps constantly. You have no idea how broken some loops would be if you could flash and bail that easily.
---
Not complaining about hooks at all. I am stating it put the game in the killers favor. When the gates spawn right by eachother and you are the last one alive, good luck having a chance. Exit gates should spawn opposite sides of the map. The killer needs to be smart about their defense rather than just watching both gates at once and having the game spoon feed hooks. Just a thought.
---
Well, you're not gonna like what I have to say next..
---
Oooooooooog
---
Whaiiit what. I work on a gen with 4 survivors and another one is comming.... 1 + 4 +1 = 6 Survivors. PS: How can 5 survivors work on a 4 side gen?
---
That‚Äôd be broken as all hell, and would become one of the, if not the, strongest killer perks in the game imo
---
The idea of Legion stopping all gang activity just to get a rework is oddly a wholesome idea to me
---
I can hear the revving from across the map
---
okay, so i didnt expect this to blow up like it did so let me clarify, i'm not a killer main, i play survivor way more i would say about 35% maybe more of my time is spent on killer. i enjoy playing huntress and pig but i am not the best. that game in particular the bill had a sort of "im better than you" attitude which i could tell me as a survivor main i can see the same patterns. he deadhard'd to commit to the door which he would have never made, i allowed him to open it bc i wanted to proc blood warden, i already knew where the hatch was as well, so when he opened it and i downed and picked him up and he ds'd me, that was fine, i didnt even bother to chase him out bc whats the point (also bw if he was stupid enough to stay), but i saw him tbag me, which also is FINE if u want to butt dance at a killer go ahead and butt dance, but this wasnt a "gg" butt dance or whatever this was a "haha get outplayed, baby killer" butt dance thats obvious. i turned around and left him bc the other person had a trap on their head, i knew where hatch was i wanted to stop that, luckily she was RIGHT THERE, so i took her and hooked her and it gave me the opportunity to do to the bill the same thing he did to me. rancor was icing on the cake. post game chat, bill was extremely toxic and told me to end my life basically over what happened. it didnt phase me too much.
---
t bagging is fine. using ds is fine. i dont care about those things and im not trying to say u deserve karma every time u butt dance, in this instance i was able to dish out the same thing he did bc i was pig and it was enjoyable. pls stop fighting over ds and whatever, it's not worth it, just enjoy this bill dying an have a good day!
---
Incorrect through and through.
---
Every Billy I play against.
---
Then I try to play Billy and get caught in every rock, bush,tree and wall.
---
I like the downvotes too much on this pathetic sub ;D
---
lmao this is gold. See you at the top
---
The other survivor is the pig there is no fifth survivor
---
 I do agree that the spawns should always spawn on different sides of the map and I didn‚Äôt realize you meant if you were the last person alive.
---
Congratulations! You found the joke!
---
APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD
---
I just realized it‚Äôs supposed to be working with 3 not 4 survivors
---
*apply directly to the forehead*
---
Bitter people will be bitter I guess. Competitive games bring out a lot of emotion in people. And some people are just childish, period.
---
So you let him open the gates, and then down him, something that is considered very toxic by both sides of the players, he escapes and teabags you because you were being a dick, and then you have the audacity to call it karma? 
---
All I see is a toxic killer that almost got what you deserved but you just lucky. 
---
The only difference between this post and that post where the pig closed the hatch in front of a downed survivor, is that this worked out for you in the end.
---
If not toxic, then childish. Stay mad little one.
---
Nice to see Nea still looks the same.
---
You can instead opt to rotate the joystick!
---
It would still be a waste of time yes. You don‚Äôt even need all that time to escape so why should I bother doing totems? It‚Äôs simply not worth losing gen time for it imo.
---
As far as NOED goes yea people bitch about it a lot but I think it‚Äôs valid complaining since the devs aren‚Äôt doing anything to really fix the issue that NOED is covering
---
i agree with this guy, it tells u the second rancor changes to you, i "allowed him to escape" bc he had just used deadhard and i had bw, the ranks im in were low i was not expecting the ds but it happened and i had moved on but saw him tbag, i didnt push him out for it, i moved on to my next target, who happened to allow me to proc bw on the bill which allowed me to tbag him back for tbagging me and also i got to kill him. thats what happened the only thing the bill did wrong was tbag a killer who could tbag him back and had the perks to kill him.
---
the karma in this clip was just how all my perks came to bite this guy in the ass and its as if he didnt see it coming. trust me this guy was not a ray of sunshine the whole game lol
---
Get used to it, it's reddit.

Honestly way better than I will ever do

---
Well we won't have to worry about this in a couple weeks
---
I think your both right. It is harder to do well in a game solo than in SWF and not just because of the lack of communication but just the fact you can get real potatoes, lack of pressure from everyone can make the killers work so easy as they get down after down. At the same time it doesn't hurt that much because if your good at hitting skill checks and looping a killer you can still rank up easily even if you do die, your just more likely to get a few bad games back to back playing solo.

Yeah I had a hag bodyblock my friend in a corner for like 3min. When we told him that he's a dick and that's reportable, he's like "lol NOW you say body blocking is toxic" like...  ??????????
---
Now that kate is getting a leather jacket soon we got 3 leather mates to watch out for. Could be kate, could be amanda, could be jeff, who knows
---
For me it is hard to imagine Jeff as toxic. He just seems like a really chill dude.
---
ok so i dont know what post youre talking about but uh. i have like 1500+ hours in this game and i have never considered the killer killing me after i opened the gate toxic? im a survivor main and if im opening the gate in front of the killer the killer is in control of the situation. if i escape then cool, if i dont then fine. i had already swung at the bill and made sure to include that part in the clip to show he used his deadhard to make me whiff to commit to the gate. i waited for him to open it to make use of MY perks. 
---
the killers job is to kill you, no matter how toxic they get. the survivors job is to survive no matter how toxic they get. if he would have left then it would have been a different story but he had a false sense of security and a big ego so he stayed and i got to do what i did. postgame chat that bill told me to "kys" so i stand by what i did to him lol
---
Nobody said it wasn't this is a suggestion to make them more important. Have a different idea I'm down to hear it.
---
He could of just closed it after hooking? Literally no reason to drop him and let him crawl to it and then close it.
---

Where you write the description of the bug also add something like.
---
"Could not upload file due to error (name the error) so here is the link to the video"
---
So many people are all about DC-ing when all it does is screw up your team‚Äôs chances of ranking and getting points. I can‚Äôt wait until they penalize people who DC. He could have accidentally dropped the pallet. Yeah, it‚Äôs the God Pallet, but still. Maybe he is a troll, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the other two players are, and you disconnecting is really what ruins the game‚Äînot somebody dropping a pallet. People who DC because things don‚Äôt always go their way are the real trolls‚Äîjust because you can‚Äôt micromanage the actions of others doesn‚Äôt mean you should ruin the fun of everyone.
---
So he probably thought you were giving him the escape then you downed him.
---
But instead you let him open gate when you had the opportunity to simply down him and hook him.
---
You even hit the lever to indicate that you want him to open it.
---
I don‚Äôt see anything in this video but toxic behavior breeding toxic behavior.
---
A. D.A.B.
---
Imagine playing DbD on Switch with Switch graphics
---
i feel the same.
---
I know the limit of the game and if i play Trapper agaist a premade i know that if they don't fuck up i won't be able to do much. It's not stressing i still play the game from the  start and until the end. 
---
Against a normal team it's the contrary most of the time i' restrain myself to not end the match quickly with optimized decisions. It's not stressful neither
---
As a solo survivor i've to deal with killers who bring supid stuff in fear of being bully. AND i've to deal with my own teamates who certainly won't make things more easy for me (rush bad saves, don't fix gens until ruin is gone, use every pallets of the map the first 2 min). That is a bit stressing
---
XD yes. Yes he did. Danzo is quite the bitch
---
no i didn‚Äôt hit the lever i went to down him and he deadharded?
---
Yo can I get a link to that Mario screaming that went off in the end
---
Pls, commas. And you have to juke him into hitting a wall
---
DAYUM boi he talented! You sure he isn't the concept artist for the game??
---
the swf that stay in low rank aren't that good. You can manage to win them unlike the swf from red ranks who really play to win.
---
Wish I could help but I have the same problem. üòû only way you can really juke him is to either run him around a tight space so his chainsaw hits something else, or to learn to weave left and right at the appropriate time. It's pretty rough
---
The only killers that can hard counter (block) this are Hag and Trapper, which I gleefully do when I am on that map as Trapper.
---
I've been hit by and hit survivors with the dumbest hatchets ever. That was a foot away from you? Too bad.
---
That's badass
---
Why not Jason? Do you think he'd be too similar to Myers, or are there licensing issues?
---
Please make me.
---
If that is the survivor‚Äôs job, no matter how toxic, what is the point of this video then? Is toxicity justifiable as a means to an end?
---
This is not a situation of simply killing after the gate is open. You deliberately let him open the gate. By all intents and purposes you were the one giving him a false sense of security in that moment.
---
Regardless of tbagging survivors obviously stay behind for many reasons. There was still another survivor left and he clearly didn‚Äôt account for BW just as you didn‚Äôt assume DS.
---
Sorry haha and yea but that‚Äôs hard when your on temple of purgation in the open üòÇ
---
General rule of thumb for this game is to create as much distance as you can from any killer. Jumping windows, throwing pallets (sparingly), and using any exhaustion perk (sprint burst, balanced, etc.). When going up against leather face you wanna be aware of your surroundings. Look for windows or pallets. Never put yourself in a position where he can get a guarantee chainsaw like being in a corner or being a large open space where he can catch up to you. Lastly, if he‚Äôs ever up close and he starts revving his chainsaw your last ditch effort would be to try to juke him to miss and hit a tree instead or something. Maybe even hopping in a locker but jumping windows is the best against him. Hope this helps!
---
I feel like the splinters give me bad survivors no matter the rank idk why
---
Wouldn't the simplest fix be to just make it so the gate is only blocked when someone is downed and within the radius of the gate to make it apply? This is a pretty decent concept for a re-work and if you make it so its when someone is downed it prevents a killer just following a survivor to a gate, blocking it and then just downing people at their leisure or waiting out EGC.   
---
If a killer downs someone in exit gate with this they could theoretically just camp and hold the person hostage however it then falls on the other survivors to go find the totem. You would know the killer is at that gate so your free to run about and if they leave to defend the totem the gate would unblock and the survivor could leave. I would make the gates unblocking be instantaneous when the totem is cleansed so that way if a survivor is being camped they can just sit in the exit amongst the block and when it disappears they get out.
---
Strangely it's only this one ;D
---
Nothing fun about putting down the god pallet and alerting killer to your location when barely a few seconds have passed. I'm not trying to micromanage anyone, but I'm not putting up with them if they're a complete fuckwit who intentionally did something to jeopardise the team. If they're getting chased and put down that pallet fast, fair enough, not everyone can loop. But consciously doing this at the start of the game? Nah, not staying. Deal with it.
---
Yea man it‚Äôs hard like I‚Äôve slowly now learned how to 360 juke someone and I can do billy just fine and all that but for the life of me I can juke a leatherface
---
I can‚Äôt stop laughing at this üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nice downvotes!
---
That actually does haha I just played a game against one and no pallets anywhere and lithe helped a lot but couldn‚Äôt do it in the end ü•∫ temple of purgation is rough
---
Ikr, shhush before they nerf another suvivor perk!
---
I tried listening to jojo openings while playing legion just for the fuck of it and it didn't work.
---
Honestly same
---
First of all, killer can open the gates themselves, so op doesn‚Äôt need a survivor to ope.n The gate for them. Second bill doesn‚Äôt know op has bloodwarden, and the killer did just try to hook him after pretending to let him escape. All he saw, is the killer bm him so he bm back. 
---
All my points still stand regardless on whether op had an intention to the bm or not.
---
Oh god why
---
Why'd they dc lol? Cause they're bad and got downed quick or what?
---
It's weird how even downloaded games make your system sound different but I guess I dont know much about how they operate. But to answer your question honestly the ps4 is loud with this game at all times or at least somewhat.
---
This survivor was just dumb, why tf didn't he just run to exit.  Instead he dodged more into the stage....
---
r/oddlysatisfying
---
Campers, t-baggers, flashlight clickers, tunnelers, and forehead megs run in first
---
I love persona, this looks sick dude!
---
Sprint Burst Sucks,Deja Vu should be a Hex and nerfed,It's op
---
I'd say replace the window with a doorway or archway with potential pallet spawn, it would be more balanced.
---
looks good dude

Gates on opposite sides of the map would make majority of killers useless in end-game. 50/50 chance the killer picks the right gate to go to (if he's wrong they have the other gate opened and are butt-dancing) and it would force the killer to run Whispers to have any real shot at identifying the right gate to defend. Hag traps are useless across the map, all M1 killers couldnt make the trip more then once or twice, Nurse screams as she's coming, Billy has the chainsaw sprint, Legion can't down you in fury (without Exposed). I mean Spirit could probably do it . . .
---
Idk my post was trying to find a solution for dull totems, NOED and EGC being too short for survivors.
---
Depends, people really don't like Clown's exhaustion addons, so some might DC for that. Or if you have Red Head's Pinky Finger, or have a mori since clowns tend to go right for the unhook and mori the person off first hook.
---
you‚Äôre correct he didn‚Äôt account for bw just like i didn‚Äôt for ds, but regardless of whatever sense of security i gave him he was going to die even if i had hit him right after he had deadhard‚Äôd to commit to the door he had too long left even if he ds‚Äôd and went back to it. this bill was always going to die and i had made it clear from slugging the nea previously that i was not going to let them escape. 
---
luring the bill into a false sense of security is a strat (it‚Äôs not what i was trying to do bc from my perspective i had assumed he knew i wasn‚Äôt letting him go, he just thought ‚Äúoh i have ds im TOTALLY FINE!‚Äù) i‚Äôve had it happen to me before a killer will act like they‚Äôre giving me freedom to work on a gen then yoink me. it happened once now it doesn‚Äôt happen again. it‚Äôs a mind game and if the killer breaks the brief trust given then oh well who cares. 
---
that shit happens in rl all the time people pretend to be nice just to rob or murder someone. you don‚Äôt hear someone saying ‚Äúhey he made me think he was my friend he can‚Äôt steal my car that‚Äôs toxic!‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt work like that and this is a video game
---
Surely just adding it as another perk option defeats the purpose. All you get then is 2 annoying exposed perks a killer can run endgame. They would still have a speed boost and map wide expose effect but now on top they can block off the gate. You would get so many people complaining about that combo and how its more annoying as you need to find 2 totems not 1, meaning we come back to the original argument of destroy the totems or risk the exposed hexes. Also what if their is only 1 dull totem left on the map which perk activates? Killers could get mad that one activated and not the other as that would of been more affective at the time.   
---
I have said already I think this is a good idea but I wouldn't want it as an addition to NOED. If this change came in the worst case scenario is people can't crutch with it anymore and have to learn their killer properly but they still have a perk that is more balanced that can help them endgame.

Once again, you are just as guilty at ruining the experience (if not worse) for the other two survivors as this guy was, and who‚Äôs to say it wasn‚Äôt an accident from a new player? Do you have a particular reason to believe he did that on purpose? Even so, my first statement is still true. Two other players suffer from his move and, more importantly, your move. From a consequentialist standpoint, you‚Äôre the one being unethical if that‚Äôs how you respond. Sure, this may not change your mind as ethics are relative and you obviously put yourself first in this situation, but you shouldn‚Äôt think you‚Äôre any better as a team member than that guy for DC-ing, when you hurt the team worse. A game can still be won without the God Pallet. A game is often lost with DCs.
---
Dude you were definitely the asshole first here
---
i still don‚Äôt think me waiting for him to open the gate is bm but that‚Äôs just me and ur free to ur own opinion. 
---
i didn‚Äôt open the gate bc well, for one he was on it lol, and two bc if i did they would know i had bw. i managed to kill him bc he didn‚Äôt expect bw so that‚Äôs why i did what i did

So what you are saying, is it would be unfair for survivors to have a chance to escape endgame? It would make whispers a pwrk worth running and in my opinion, make it more challenging and rewarding to handle endgame. It is so op to face a nurse or billy with the gates 2 feet from eachother. Automatic loss. They should always be a good distance apart and killers should have to do what they did all match which is play smart to get the kill.
---
It hardly works lol

You could at least of given constructive criticism. All your showing is you didn't even bother to read OP's messages properly. They have given a viable way to change a perk that many people dislike but also OP has indicated multiple times they are not bothered by NOED and they even used it once but felt it is just too crutch a perk so stopped using it. Just because we accept NOED doesn't mean it can't be improved on or tweaked to make the overall game experience better. Your probably being downvoted because even before the edit your reply used aggressive language and gave no constructive input just parrotted an old argument.
---
YES, that would be awesome. I loved old Laurie! And I also liked Myers' old and cracked mask. Would gladly pay for these.

That people play for *fun*. Look online, people get frustrated playing all sorts of games, including this one. And you are arguing that they shouldn't be able to play a game rhey paid for and enjoy, because your right to be an annoying little **** is more important.
---
End of the day, no one is *really* asking you to stop playing, just stop being annoying. You don't have to t-bag to win, after all.

Removed - Non-English submissions

Jeez is it rlly that hard to understand that he wanted blood warden to go off? If you open the gate right in front of the killer dont expect him to come behind you and give a big warm hug either way
---
So basically you can do what you want no matter how toxic, as you said, but tbagging crossed the line?
---
People complain about ruin when thanataphobia is low-key better

WHY MY MAIN KILLER AND SURVIVOR? üòÇ

A smart survivor will know to be careful in chases with trapper though. take note of habits the survivors have, what specific thing does this Meg do a lot? how about that Nea over there, what‚Äôs her plan?
---
I don't mind Dwight but I think we can agree Mega-Dwight is the worst

Still the worst argument to defend tbagging. Doing something because you know it will make the other side mad but then saying: "oH nO I jUsT pReSsEd cNtRl, I nEvEr mEaNt tO bE tOxIc"

I use it a Bunch, and I think its the best thing when it works and you can make a basement save or stun during a chase if I am near to one. I can see how it could be annoying for the killer though, but i dont think it would be toxic because  its too hard to repeatedly use on the same killer over and over.
---
There are consequences for stupid actions. My DC is one of them. Deal with it.

Since we have a killers range of view ghost face and stealth killers would dominate us honestly I would pretend to not see ghostface as he's stalking me I would maybe even shake my ass a bit when I realize I have been exposed I drop on the floor and TWERK ghost face will swing not at me but at my ass ripping my pants off he pulls down his pants and at that moment I realize I fucked up because all killers have a giant dick that is 50 feet long I then try to run but then I trip he sticks his knife in my ass then he goes for the head that should give you all enough time to escape
---
I've honestly never gotten or used a splinter
---
oh how I wonder what it's like

Lmao
---
i‚Äôve been on record of stating tbagging is fine? just don‚Äôt be butthurt and tell me to end my life when i give u those same tbags lol 
---
people get too salty over this game. yeah it SUCKS to get facecamped, sure it‚Äôs annoying when survivors insta heal, yeah ds/noed can be bothersome, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game and how someone else plays isn‚Äôt controlled by you. if they‚Äôre having fun and it‚Äôs not against the rules of the game (like sandbagging etc) then let them do their thing and move on.
---
It‚Äôs a post from a few days ago where a pig drops a person on the ground in front of the hatch, pretends to let them have it, closes the hatch but the survivor has adrenaline and a key.
---
If you wanted to use bloodwarden, you were perfectly capable of downing him, and opening the gate yourself. But you let him open it, giving him false hope. A lot of killers do that simply to be a dick, and that‚Äôs no doubt what the bill thought you were doing. So you bm him, regardless of intention, and he bm you back. It should have ended there. 
---
Btw, I‚Äôm not complaining that you used bloodwarden and the rancored him. That‚Äôs part of the game, but what I don‚Äôt understand is that you think it‚Äôs karma when he really did nothing wrong, at least in this clip.
---
Great enthusiasm and mindset. When they start punishing players who DC, you‚Äôll have to deal with that too (or move onto another game where you can troll and be toxic without punishment). Happy gaming! üôÉ
---
I'd say that's just the state of the game just now. Don't like a killer, dc. Don't like a map, dc. Someone breathes, dc.
---
Did someone leave a window open? So coldddddddd....
---
I will add though I just saw your other comment in the thread explaining in more detail. I am not trying to justify Bill‚Äôs actions, I‚Äôm of the mind that either all of it is okay or none of it is okay.
---
I read your other comment and I do better understand your perspective and thought process now.
---
It works maybe 50% of the time, if that lol. Also with the completely unnecessary and absolute nonsense of a nerf in the upcoming patch with Freddy it will be a dumpster perk that‚Äôll completely kill it if they don‚Äôt fix the hit registration for it.

That you can buy the cosmetics with shards on some platforms but not on others is bullshit, I agree.

No, I'm saying that they shouldn't get frustrated over a *video game* and that if they do they should consider doing something that doesn't cause them frustration, instead of whinging at others. Can't handle a little crouch animation? Go play a game that doesn't have one, simple. Grow up, it's a bloody game. I wont stop enjoying myself just because it hurts your feelings.

I have no artistic skill

if i opened the gate myself he would have known i had bw, that‚Äôs why i didn‚Äôt do that. i‚Äôm a survivor main and when a killer opens the gate it 100% tells me they have bw. that‚Äôs why i didn‚Äôt open the gate. i wasn‚Äôt trying to bm him? and i made it clear to him by lunging at him initially that i was going to kill him. if i would have downed him, opened the gate, picked him up into him having ds chances are that would have made him leave thinking i had bw. he SHOULD HAVE LEFT from the get go bc the last person had a hat and they needed to get hatch or their hat off. he didn‚Äôt leave, instead tbagged and forced his own fate.

but i mean who knows what would have happened.

It's less the Mori itself, and more getting Mori'd off first hook. Feels shitty to get killed in 30% of the work that is normally required. As for exhaustion addons, it alone probably isn't a reason most people would quit, but some people get really mad about it.
---
Aw man i would love jeepers creepers levels. That was the scariest movie to me as a kid besides ET

i guess maybe karma was the wrong word? i just mostly meant it bc like i got to tbag him back and had the last laugh kinda thing. i don‚Äôt post often so titles are not my forte 
---
i still don‚Äôt think what the bill did want wrong. it‚Äôs even a play i might make if i was in that situation. it‚Äôs just how he acted post game made me less sympathetic to his situation and more ‚Äúhaha ima post this funny clip now‚Äù
---
Play him and you'll see how

I'm serious

Well I was solo and the killer had us 4 gened on swamp and was slugging the other guy. Ask that teammate for hatch they basically tell me off then go team with the killer

It's not even toxic squad or sweaty tryhards. Looking at their perk you can ssy that they are definitely not good at the game.

What's the point of posting this here?

What happens though? Can the killers damage eachother?
---
Into the land of:        WHAT NOW
---
You are... a moron. "The entity gets distracted and opens the gates". Wtf that is better to you than judt saying here lets put the gates away from eachother. Your stupidity just took off to outer space my guy. Both the survivor and killer need to handle endgame corrextly. It shouldn't be easy for either.
---
I live for this kind of high quality meme content
---
Thats what concerned me as well. Why give him Hope if you want to dunk on him. Thats just unnecessary.  Both sides showed disrespect.
---
Tunneling can still be a very powerful killer strat if they play it correctly. IF they simply patrol the area outside the hook, yeah they should learn to play better, but if they patrol gens and then can zoom back (ie nurse, spirit, billy) after the unhook, it can be a pretty strong strategy.
---
Who's saying that tho?
---
oh can't I just get a UTI
---
So why not leave before the match started?
---
Why does she have a gun is that a new ability?
---
I CAST G U N
---
I do understand that the survivors are the majority of the community so they get their way a lot more then the killers do and I do agree that most killers should get buffed and balanced out to match against survivors and looping as that was the main thing that put me off playing killer was how harder it was to enjoy playing as them but I would love to see something similar to this for a April fools update or something
---
Yeah ok but injured Claudette grunting is hearable from the other side of the map, and its directional. So, if she isnt deaf, she would totally knew where were you
---
Can we atleast have the dildos
---
Not Sure might have to talk to the devs on that one
---
Mori is waste of BP both for killers and survivors. Grind is real, be responsible.
---
Had to downvote. Only toxic player I saw there was you.
---
**I‚Äôm both in terms of being awful**
---
The scythe is awesome imo, the tattoo is sick af and the scythe is a nice touch.
---
Vaulting, Pallets, Running around any object he has to take wider turns on or else risking hitting it and throwing his tantrum which gives you so much time to run away.
---
Don't stick to open/empty areas
---
Thinking about it now, the real problem is that I get about six syringes and eight brand new parts per bloodweb but not even a single tarnished coin....
---
ill upvote ur comment to make it even then ;p
---
IMO ( in terms of powers not perks )
---
Worth Buying:
---
Pig ( Traps Delay Survivor Progress)
---
Myers ( Addons and tiers provide variety of play styles)
---
Not Worth:
---
Ghost Face (Weaker versi√≥n of Myers)
---
Leather face (Power too situational, less aggressive billy)
---
r/woooosh
---
&gt;to be fair the devs have fucked matchmaking before so it could be possible to would help
---
I mean... it is because of the fucked up matchmaking that people can still find games at certain times, it throws any ranks on your lobby. If they made it more strict, you wouldn't be able to play.
---
Should have bought him during the summer sale
---
no I mean they have had it fuck up once to the point no one could even really find games but they ended up fixing that and they keep working on matchmaking making it better
---
Decisive itself isnt toxic, its tbagging and not leaving is

If only it was in Texas. xD

&gt;no I mean they have had it fuck up once to the point no one could even really find games but they ended up fixing that and they keep working on matchmaking making it better
---
I don't know what you are talking about to be honest. 
---
Recently when no one could find games was because of double bloodpoints and third year anniversary happening at the same time, which caused everyone to play killer and the survivor population dropped drastically. The week after, Ghost Face came out which prevented the situation to go back to normal. 
---
AFAIK their changes to matchmaking is trying to make people queue up against the same rank.
---
nO tUnNeLiNg
---
I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too applicable for say, Trapper and Doctor
---
Ah, at least I don't have a problem with people wasting pallets. They Just get caught like idiots.
---
It would be ridiculously fun to bait SWF groups with this perk. Just wait for them all to come and save their friend by creating a train of body blockers, act like your not interested in them and only going for the injured survivor who got off the hook, and then laugh at them as they realize how truly fucked they all are.
---
This post right here, officer
---
I personally think the matchmaking is fucked up, and has been for awhile now. At yesterday's peak dbd had just about 27k concurrent players.
---
Love all the people ignoring the real fun of this perk here in the comments; 
---
You have a t-bagging survivor in the exit gates.  As soon as you're close enough to see them, they're trapped there and you get an insta down.  That's hilarious to me lol
---
Haven't laughed so hard for a long time. Thanks. Please add the wheelchairs with dildos tho.
---
I feel like they should have a screen notification if youre in the terror radius just for this
---
Yea it is way too quite now.
---
Spine Chill/Premonition so your friend can have an idea of where the killer is, or an aura-reading perk like Alert or Empathy (if they want to see where their injured teammates are and/or if someone is being chased). Perhaps Technician if they need to train for his skillchecks.
---
Really? Because every killer sees it as a sign of disrespect and ‚Äòlol ez‚Äô.
---
"it will now become extremely situational. It already may not work if survs cleanse dull totems, or find hex totem after exit gates are powered. Now you will have to be right next Exit Gate to get any use of it"
---
"survivors now have pretty much no counterplay"
---
You kinda contradicted yourself

How the fuck did you get skilled huntress
---
Just a question, if you‚Äôre using distressing, why not unnerving presence?
---
Problem is, Universal own the rights to H2018/H40 Myers, not Compass International (who BHVR got the Halloween license from), so it‚Äôs going to be nowhere near as simple as cosmetics for Pig/Tapp, Ash and Ghostface.
---
Every stack of WGLF adds 10% to heal speed when healing other survivors maybe? So it encourages unhook and heal
---
Perfect drawing. 11/10
---
No just that but the music that comes with the terror radius should either be removed or lowered down, because there used to be a glitch that when you spectated after you died you couldn‚Äôt hear the terror radius and chase music, it was just the heartbeat.
---
And boy was it scary, just hearing loud ass thumps and the heavy footsteps of the killer in a chase really gave this game the horror vibe.
---
I think they should lower the volume of a lot of stuff.
---
I think it does light up, but it's only once per minute. Spine Chill has no cooldown.
---
Pebble can work for the same function
---
Congrats
---
True true. I dont use them so i wouldnt know lol
---
Pretty much every Ace I go up against is toxic
---
don‚Äôt gotta explain yourself, just gg and move on before people be toxic haha
---
Don't know what he's mad about, just got the game yesterday.
---
Anyone want to explain what a tunnel is?
---
I ignore dull totem completely, if it is not lighten up I will pass it. NOED is not really a problem at all. 
---
I will not waste time searching for dull totem and destroy them just to get rid of NOED. I don‚Äôt search for HEX ruin Totem for less than 1 minute I rather power through the gen and finish it, than running for 5 minutes and find nothing. It will take forever to find all the dull totem.
---
You have to know one thing last gen is dangerous business and you need extra attention to survive.
---
I used premonition once and it has to be one of the least useful perks. Once per minute is kinda stupid, and the false positives on the perk suck. I think it should be changed.
---
That's because if you are the killer their survivors waste less pallets. If you are the survivor your team just throws down pallets whenever.
---
It's when you chase the person who was last hooked
---
Apparently it‚Äôs when you focus on some one. Which is just fucking stupid for ppl to bitch about since the objective of the killer is to well you know kill things
---
I don‚Äôt get it how mlga wouldv‚Äôe helped here. Because he slugged? Like any killer would do in a situation like this?
---
I am stuck on rank 10 but I don't deserve it. I suck but I don't drop and I don't improve. When the killer finds me, I usually die.
---
Its when you follow one survivor all the time and never attack/hook the other ones.
---
Just looked at it n its every 30 seconds but yeah its still a lame perk
---
Doing totems kinda helps noed tbh. Survivors get all the obvious totems and usually end up leaving one or two really well hidden ones that noed has an increased chance spawning on now. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre in a swf and dedicated to hunting it... it‚Äôs kinda best to just find it when he activates/assume he always has noed.
---
This is what gives freddy nightmares
---
Apparently they‚Äôll be free ;)
---
So, does Adrenaline only proc if you're within 16 meters of the Killer under this rework idea?
---
I ask because both perks are mirrors of one another, both operating under the same trigger. One is made null and void by cleansing totems, the other by killing everyone before the last gen finishes.
---
I'm no fan of NoEd, running it or going against it but in its current state it is a fair and balanced perk. If people continue to refuse to cleanse totems, even with the increased BP gain, then they deserve it.
---
That's why I'm kinda sad
---
People get frustrated over many different things. For example; many people get frustrated just *watching* sports.
---
Feeling frustration when playing videogames is not some strange thing, but is actually quite common, due to immersion. Playing Killer in DBD, especially at rank 1, is quite high-pressure. You have to juggle a lot of different things and know how to end chases quickly. Thus, frustration can build quickly when things start to go wrong.
---
If you don't experience this yourself, I'm happy for you, but you seem unable to understand *why* others do.
---
Now, this isn't a constant thing. For the most part, people are having fun playing DBD, hence why they repeatedly come back to it. But some matches, against (relatively) good Survivors can cause frustration, and teabagging makes it worse.
---
Your description of it as "fast, repetitive crouching" says to me that you don't understand the underlying meaning of teabagging.
---
It is a form of mockery, essentially you are saying that the Killer "sucks" or "lacks skill" and are humiliating them. Describing it as simply "fast, repetitive crouching" is akin to describing flipping the bird as "showing you a finger". Yes, that is what you are physically doing, by society has placed upon that action an offensive connotation and considers it rude.
---
So, in the end, it boils down to this:
---
Either you don't understand why people take offence to teabagging, or you do and simply don't care.
---
But either way, please answer me this;
---
Why is teabagging so important to you? Why can't you enjoy yourself without doing it?
---
Oh sorry üòÇ
---
Ohhh right, my bad. I don't have the Purple tier 3 version so I wasn't sure. It's basically Spine Chills dumber twin.
---
That Bill could also have healed himself so his survivor rank doesn't decrease.
---
Yeah I'm always around the rank 20 mark as I never get chances to improve as I'm almost always the first one dead
---
Lmao thats a good way to put it
---
People like them ruin this fucking game
---
Pretty much
---
ah.. another one of these posts. 
---
Good job though!

I like it a lot, it's more interactive and requires some thought to make the best use of it, unlike the current one.
---
Look at his tiny head I'm fuckin dying
---
Idc what people say ghostface mixed with the grim reaper is awesome great tat dude
---
Will he be on ps4
---
Agreed. I wish they would add some spice to all the low tier killer perks for more build variety. It‚Äôs tiring seeing the same 6 perks basically every game
---
Sorry if this is dumb, but what is mlga?
---
What setup were you running?
---
I got a 4k and they said I was lag switching lmao
---
I consider a 4k the only way to win because I'm super competitive and it kinda ruins some fun for me by making the game more stressful than it has to be. 
---
I have a friend and his only objective is to get 4 stacks on bbq, that's the right attitude imo. Just chill and have fun is the real objective in any game.
---
I'm not reading this wall of text, why are you still wasting your time here? It's a *crouch animation in a video game* ffs get the bloody hell over it or get off the fucking game, your complaining is getting you nowhere. Enjoy your next teabags and clicks.
---
Oh my god! What did you do to my poor goblin boi?!
---
LOL you can‚Äôt be serious, you‚Äôre whining on a public forum about a strategy you don‚Äôt know how to counter. Maybe ask for help? ‚ÄúMiNd YoUr BuSiNeSs‚Äù üòÇ
---
That makes sense also because they make noise. And also to time the firecracker to blind the killer is very difficult as they can just look up to avoid it.
---
thats my fƒ∫air
---
BrUh
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Is there a program he can use that makes his controller vibrate or give a visual for when you are within the killer radius?
---
Boy so you don‚Äôt think people can have a opinion and you steal jokes
---
but it's still tilting because I just want to have fun while trying to get an achievement while they flashlight click and everything all game.
---
You‚Äôre the one who started shaming others for their opinion and advice. ‚ÄúYou steak jokes‚Äù I‚Äôm mocking you and your ‚Äújoke‚Äù lmao
---
Linkin Park? when I see legion all I can hear is the my little pony theme song... who's a boo-boo stabby boi, yes you are, yes you are...peekaboo!
---
I think this makes the perk even worse tbh, especially considering how hard it is to escape through the gates even now if you are the last survivor.
---
Getting full lobby with 150- pings in less than 5 minutes /s
---
According to the DBD Wiki,  
---
If you have Iron Will I, Stridor 2/3 will make you grunt at full volume and Stridor 1 will make you grunt at 75% volume. Each extra point in Iron Will reduces these numbers by 25%.   
---
Iron Will also does nothing to affect the amplification of your normal breathing that Stridor 3 causes.
---
Advice lmao. First all killer mains bitched so hard they got decisive nerfed. Borrowed time can only work if you can get someone off the hook which is hard to do when the killer can pull you off. The only joke I see here is your life.
---
I just rotate the joystick.  The wiggle bar doesn't move any faster of you are manhandling it
---
Finding a lobby is a win to me
---
Uh, DS is in a perfect place. If you down two people, run to the other side of the map, find the unhooked survivor, chase them, then manage to down them and pick them up in under a minute you must be really good at this game, so chasing them again wouldn't be a much of a problem, now would it? Decisive only gives the survivor 1 minute, that isn't a long time. Being unhooked and put on the hook within a minute is really boring and kind of annoying.
---
Grow up and get good or uninstall the game. gg ez üò¥
---
Can you tell me the source of the picture?
---
I‚Äôm not the one going around tryna be toxic on people‚Äôs Reddit post. Grow up move out your moms basement.
---
Just getting into a lobby is a personal
---
Aw yeah nurse
---
You‚Äôre literally crying because you lost a game. You felt so butt hurt that you felt the need to whine on Reddit. Congrats :)
---
It's because on pc they're all toxic as hell. It overall the community is toxic, but even more on this platform.
---
I‚Äôm only here to find a baby Dwight joke in comments
---
No ones crying or whining there bud. Congrats on being the dumbest person on reddit.
---
I consider getting 4 stacks of BBQ&amp;Chili a win to me
---
If they click their flashlights they are wasting the battery so if anything that is good for you. Flashlights are really easy to counter too just fake the pick up and go for hits on them and make sure you scare them away before picking up while facing away from them. They will either miss the save or have multiple there which means no gens are being done and you will have more chances to hit them.
---
So when's this cosmetic releasing
---
LOL I‚Äôm convinced you‚Äôre trolling at this point. Surely you can‚Äôt be this much of a moron. Oh well cheers buddy! Hope you learn to play survivor at some point!
---
I'm in this comment and I don't like it
---
Art is by the talented [Becky Daly](https://www.facebook.com/artzbybecky/)!
---
Why would you want the pyramidhead as a killer without james sunderland as survivor? Do you even silent hill bro?
---
So many idiots got triggered lmao, obviously anyone with half a brain would DC on the spot if that happens. What is the fun in playing with a bunch of crayon eaters in your team? Fuck that
---
Spine chill, iron will, decisive strike and an exhaustion perk
---
Much love and respect for your deaf friend üñ§
---
While you are running in general it‚Äôs pure gold
---
Make lobbies great again. A tool used to determine live ping while playing. It also has a feature to ‚Äúmark‚Äù hosts so survivors can dodge killers they don‚Äôt like playing against.
---
There‚Äôs only one killer. The Crapper.
---
If you think camping is a legit playstyle, you are a moron. Not only does it ruin someone's match entirely, but it also makes the game very bad for the other survivors too. One person has to waste their time on the hook to buy time for their team and hopefully they gen rush to punish the killer. Camping doesn't get punished enough currently. Yea the devs said it is a playstyle but it is toxic and if you can't admit, hey maybe me sitting on this guys hook for no reason is kinda toxic, then you are stupid.
---
I'm with you, friend. I use it once in a while even though I prefer the p3 head.
---
I don‚Äôt like it myself, as I never get to use it (I‚Äôm usually the first one to get hooked) but many people like it so if you‚Äôre not getting Adam, you should take it from the shrine
---
doctor, terrible without an electrode add on
---
Why?
---
Not everyone has a bedtime like you little buddy
---
I‚Äôm too dumb for this. Can anyone explain it to me?
---
I‚Äôm thinking about switching from console to pc
---
Someday he will come
---
Just a typical dummy Dweeb.
---
Is a form of looping effective at winning?
---
Imma bully anyway
---
Killer doesn‚Äôt have the before-game chat unless it‚Äôs a KYF game
---
WoW dId YoU jUsT sTeAl My JoKe?!
---
Why did the entity block the exit gate? Is it because he sacrificed some one?
---
Make the killers fight!
---
Well, nurse usually don't get looped, don't need camping or tunneling, and she can potentially finish the match in 3 minutes with snowball build. Without perks she can win the game easily. She ignores pallets, windows, every fucking objects in the map that the survivor normally can use to counter some killer.
---
Yesterday i had been playing Nurse and Spirit all day, i played one single game with Billy...it was horrific to see the difference. I couldn't do anything, the survivors were extremely optimal at looping...it really shows you that if survivors are not potatoes you can't do anything with any killer besides those two you mentioned. It was rank 3 btw. Like, even if you kill them all it's not even fun to go around in circle forever. I think if the devs will ever nerf my two girls by making them loopable i will quit the game. I really hope they'll not turn this game into NASCAR simulator completely.
---
What rank are you?
---
The last person was on death hook tho. He was just being an ass here.
---
If a killer face camp you that means he loves you
---
The sound of his scream getting further and further away is so damn funny.
---
I was replying to someone who said it is *always* the best to just leave.
---
That you consider *that* a wall of text, says it all. Unwilling to learn or change, unwilling to stop actively annoying people.
---
You are ignorant and discourteous, and I am done with you.
---
Aight, sorry then.
---
Zoom in.
---
Identity V has one as well.
---
Reported for spoiling the next killer.
---
A little research goes a long way.
---
Having fun goofing around with non toxic survivors is a win for me
---
Wow the double killer glitch is on mobile too? Idk if that's bad or good
---
I chortled at this.
---
The event one that has his intestines hanging out.
---
Oh my(-ers), I like your screenshot so much!! :O
---
It really makes feel the thrill and tension until the very last second! :D
---
This is amazing ! Your dad has sick skills
---
Mori should be hex agrreeee?
---
I agree that getting mori'd is garbage, but it's more like 60%. You're down already, so he could get 2nd hook instead.
---
Unwilling to grow up and stop getting upset over a fucking video game lmao. Git gud trash puppy
---
See I agree with you here. I have multiple clips of me 360ing a killer, there's like 2 feet between us, and I still get hit. Or I'm on the other side of a window and get hit. Or I'm sprinting and slow vault through a window during chase. Or I'm slamming the button to throw down pallet and I don't, getting hit then wasting the pallet. 
---
But I also feel there needs to be more severe punishment for face camping. There is a small loss in pip points but not enough to discourage the practice.
---
As for perks, i just want a survivor perk to get 100% bonus bloodpoints thats more viable than WGLF so I have some incentive to play survivor. If I get tunneled and camped, I leave out with 2-6k bloodpoints while the killer will usually never leave with less than 12k.
---
Oh, well: now survivors too can have jumpscares builds! D:
---
Australia is 600 ping average. Dedicated Servers are coming soon. I'm sure if demand is high enough they will invest in servers around Saudi Arabia cause I'm sure they like making money like any other business.
---
Lag switch... no maybe a ping drop
---
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
---
That's so cool!
---
Damn, that is very well done, it looks amazing. Your dad is insanely talented.
---
Theres some cool people in there. I met 2 people that i play with almost daily from it so id say give it a try. If you find people that are assholes just delete them and move on.
---
Omg haha!
---
I dont see anything?
---
why would you do this to us
---
I love his Hallowed Blight skin
---
The only Friday the 13Th they could get involved in is the 2009 remake. I personally think he fits in more as he is more focused on running survivors down
---
I don't like how you have to get to the endgame in order for NOED to do anything for you. It's like saying "I know that I'm going to do somewhat poorly." It's a crutch.
---
Pig with whispers is so fun just crouch and find survivor who is doing gen ez ambush attack and in end game it is ez ti find the last survivor.
---
Honestly Is it just me but I feel like I have the opposite. They're always trying to unhook and nobody does any GENS
---
Well i used the website chill blast. They are a good uk based gaming pc brand
---
Oh my god i cant unsee that now.
---
It would hurt my soul seeing Pyramid-Head ending up being a low/mid tier killer which gets looped and t-bagged by a group of neon-wearing girls in pyjamas.
---
But I would still like to see him.
---
Lmao you‚Äôre dumb
---
Love bloodwarden. Was getting bullied. Tbagged and flashlight stunned all game. I think this was my very first hook.
---

---
I loved older Laurie, it would be cool to have her in the game!
---
I've played since 2016 survivor main. Survivor games for me are always instantly filled lobbies (unless it's bugged with 3 people) even at red ranks. Even back before clown and spirit, killer lobbies were typically very quick to fill. Since the release of spirit killer lobbies just take at least 15 minutes to fill, 10 minutes before people even start to join. I don't believe the excuse about too many people playing killer and not enough survivors, here's why, during the event where survivors had to harvest flowers is when they were really pushing this excuse of too many killers, that day I played against the same guy 5 times in a row. So, the matchmaking just seems fishy and bugged to me.
---
Holy fck, that's scarier than Hag
---
is "my dad" the new "my girlfriend"?
---
You've pointed out the issues but I feel like this change is overkill for a perk that can potentially be balanced through smaller changes. We'll look at the issues and how to address them:  
---
1) "It feels overpowered to Survivors." From a Survivor's perspective, the Killer is downing the team with little-no skill. There was no prior warning this perk was in-game, and the opportunity to counter it now is very slim.
---
A perk that exposes everyone and provides bonus movement speed after all the generators are done can sound ridiculous but the issue is more with the lack of prior warning of this perk existing. Survivors have nothing to work with and have to assume that is may be present in every game, either cleansing totems when NOED isn't selected or vice versa.
---
Some solutions to this can include:
---
\- Providing a warning that NOED is present as the end-game approaches. If, for example, NOED resonated an audio cue once 3/4 generators have been done, Survivors know the perk is present and can look to prevent it's activation by checking all totem have been cleansed. Other types of warnings can include visual cues, escalating hints (Obsession, Devour Hope) or encouraging noticeable play-styles on the Killer (Devour Hope, MYC).  
---
\- Adding a totem counter that informs Survivors of how many totems remain. This removes the uncertainty of whether there are totems remaining or not, and Survivors can now comfortably cleanse 2/3 totems knowing that 1 totem is still standing in-game.
---
2) "The perk feels loses most of the match, and is too late to use effectively." From a Killer's perspective, they have 3 perks for the duration of the match and only get access to the 4th when the match is about to finish in roughly 2 minutes.
---
We do need to acknowledge it as an endgame perk, designed to be effective when the Survivors are on the cusp of escaping. This does not mean the perk should feel as useless, we currently have several endgame perks which feel fairer on use (Blood Warden, Rancor, Remember Me) however they all provide added benefits or delay the game.
---
Using this info, we can make the perk feel more useful by:
---
\- Providing a small benefit during the match. The bonus movement speed NOED provides doesn't need to activate after all the generators are done, it can activate after 3 generators have popped or scale during the match (similar to how Fire Up works). Additional or other benefits can be added that provide a hint for the Survivors, providing a small benefit to both parties.
---
\- Delaying the game. NOED provides a small window of opportunity to be effective and is often too late to use efficiently, you may down 1 Survivor but the rest escape so you feel unrewarded. Delaying the game through de-buffs expands this window without providing too much of an opportunity for the Killer, for example, a temporary action de-buff, a de-buff to Survivors who are near the Exit Gates, etc.
---
Nobody is using exhaustion perks, ds, borrowed, adrenaline and you are playing a nurse. Just show some balls and pick them up, maybe they will wiggle out and make the game a bit longer but you are going to win anyways, farm more points and make the game less boring for everyone.
---
"Guys, why is the killer killing me for no reason ;( He's being so toxic and stopping me from playing the game" -Quote from man in a game where literally the killer killing you to take you out of the trial is literally the main game mechanic
---
scythe isnt inaccurate as the name for the original scream costume was "father death"
---
i mean he knew there was a rancor on him right. i  thought as the obession you can see it, cant you?  
---
   
---
and at that point the hatch was the only option for the other survivor, or at least his best option. i can see why you would try to heal and then tank a hit for the dude in other situations but he had an active trap on and injured
---
Straight out of Innsmouth, jesus!
---
If I have fun I win regardless of amount of kills.
---
I just enjoy how crazy some matches can be or the weird plays and situations that arise. I like how every match can be so different.
---
It's actually not better to hold the chainsaw. Ballsy survivors may try to unhook if you're not charging your saw. But if you are charging the saw, NOBODY is going for the save.
---
It is unfortunately common for people to run with absurdly different ranks to avoid playing high ranked killers while still getting pips
---
Welcome to the fog. 
---
It has been like this since the implementation of the new matchmaking system (a few months ago). So basically, you are playing matches against people out of your rank so that you don't have to wait 4 ever in a lobby.
---
Unless you're in the open, which you shouldn't be, but sometimes it's hard to avoid.
---
Great composition!
---
Oh, they're all strong perks, don't be me wrong.  But that is rather the point.
---
There just aren't very many good perks for survivors or killers, so we see the same damn ones over and over (and over, and over, and...).
---
I just dont really see why. Noed is kinda already in a good place, this just seems like its going to make it super situational, but broken in those situations. Like if you are being chased by the killer you literally just cant leave. The exposed part almost doesn't matter at that point because they are not getting out of the door.
---
I dunno, sounds OP.....
---
Everybody gangsta till the pyramid show up
---
Hey guys, OP here. I posted this as a meme, you know the ‚Äúmy disappointment is immeasurable‚Äù dude. I wasn‚Äôt trying to say he is toxic or his playstyle was toxic I was just bamboozled because a lot of killers will carry me to the hatch and let me escape so I was like ‚Äúcool this guy is cool, nice, cool cool‚Äù and then bam right in my face. I didn‚Äôt rage, I didn‚Äôt send him a salty message. My reaction was more of a ‚Äúahhh I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve done this‚Äù. It‚Äôs a game try and have fun
---
This makes the perk even worse and also makes blood warden pointless. I'm a 50/50 player so I hate NOED as much as the next guy, but people forget that a killer with NOED is running with 3 perks until the end game. And if you cleanse the totems that's 3 perks for the entire trial. People should honestly just be glad it is a hex and no a normal perk that just activates for 2 minutes like it used to be.
---
No, he is not. Cannibal is very bad, his chainsaw is almost unusable in chases and he only can secure 1 kill by face camping, that's the only thing he can do reliable, camping. 
---
If you want to play a killer with chainsaw, play Billy.
---
u/nwordcountbot u/redeagle42

Thank you for the request, comrade.

I have looked through redeagle42's posting history and found 3 N-words, of which 0 were hard-Rs.
---
Good bot.
---
It has to many downsides. If they removed the broken status it MIGHT be ok imo
---
Driver
---
OP already said the top 3 killers wouldn't be affected. L2Read.
---
I'd love this. He's super low tier and this could help him, even if only a little.
---
ugh flair checks out I guess
---
To be fair though. It‚Äôs not always awful and toxic. There are some amazing things that have come out of this community. So you kinda just have to take the good with the bad
---
By god, a new superpower
---
In which I am both. But also not. Because being toxic is an opinion, and I‚Äôve had people call me toxic for being nice to the enemy. Yeah, I‚Äôm confused too.
---
Is that a Tucker and Dale vs Evil reference?
---
I think I'm going to have nightmares. I'm so excited for the Freddy rework tomorrow but I think Quentin's face also needs a rework.
---
It's a legit play style in the same way voting libertarian is in the US, a loosing strategy.
---
It's not really that they're greedy. They need some way to make money other than the actual character DLCs.
---
bad killer
---
So, what happens if you're in a SWF against an M1 killer, you know that he has NOED because he refuses to hit you, because hitting would mean you would manage to run away thanks to the speed boost. So as the survivor you stand right in the sweet spot where you have time to escape but the killer can't catch up to block the exit gate. While your team is just looking for the totem, as M1 killer you can't do anything because you don't threaten him to down him in one hit. So it would be better to play it as a killer that can actually one shot survivors.
---
He looks like wait was Dwight Ash all along?!
---
The whole ideea of noed is to prevent survivors from escaping, imo the suggested rework is very good.
---
Just because it happens in every game doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt toxic
---
I had such great times with smoking splinters (Quite a bit of 4K's) I got Freddy a few months ago. Don't regret it one bit and I'm going to miss old freddy but at least the rework looks just as fun.
---
Get Elijah Wood and Daniel Radcliffe to have a baby. Get this baby to to go through a super intense Shia LaBeouf mental breakdown stage for like 20-30 years and I think this is what we get.
---
Hmmmmmmm ü§î
---
Mmm ya sure whatever you want for your lord Cuntchido
---
I see a pip or 2 pip as a win, black pip as a draw and an entity displeased as a loss
---
THATS SO FUCKING COOL!!
---
So you assume everyone who hurts your feelings watching Ochido.
---
Was playing my Nurse, because some people were over and wamted to see me play killer. I broght in an Ivory mori, so they could learn some of the games mechanics and how it works. I down and hook two people (at seperate times) and then find the first guy again, who is no fully healed. I down him again, and show off Nurse's mori. After that game, I found out he was rank 18.
---
x4 swf answers, nah we all got enough adrenaline..
---
Haha this is my fav pic of John Cena.
---
It totally wasn't bad matchmaking or a survive with friends who brought a low rank to go against worse killers
---
Toxic is honestly more of a term that just gets thrown around anymore
---
Cool way of looking at it :)
---
Just a damn orange what that suposse to mean?
---
distressing pairs with doctor's treatment mode, where terror radius increases survivor's madness slowly
---
I like the art but why sprint Burst? I think dead hard is a much better option as it can add a lot of time to a chase during it rather than a little bit at the start. Just my opinion tho. It looks great
---
Looks good man!
---
Now this is a skin I would pay $15 for
---
I assume he doesn't have all perks seeing how his Overcharge is only rank 2, and his perks don't work that well together. All those perks are also Doctor/base perks, so it's very possible he hasn't even leveled Trapper up for unnerving.
---
No but you didn't exactly hurt my feelings you just said I was bad because I got gen rushed and judging by your grammar I wouldn't be surprised if you were an ochido fan boy but that part came out of habit from all the ochido fan boys you find on ps4 and pc
---
 this subreddit is infected by arguments repeated over and over, jesus
---
What could be better options? Green add on that gives an Aura revealed everytime a trapped survivor uses a jigsaw box for the first time?  Extra long lasting scratch marks?
---
Hahaha you're a bitch dude you dont even have the balls to leave up any comment you keep trying to work up the courage to send me even going to my comments in other sections like really? So obvious why you're looking for friends which you cant find üòÜ
---
I mean you had a crutch perk and only managed to sacrifice one person. It‚Äôs safe to say you lack skill/game knowledge. Stay yellow.

This community is only toxic to survivors. If you are a killer main you are good. I scrolled down to the bottom and saw all the down voted comments. It's the comments that are critical that the killer slapped the lever to indicate that he was letting him leave and tricking him. Then downed him. I would say if he just left this would be karma towards the killer, but instead he stayed behind and got killed.. 
---
Just wait and see how my comment gets down voted. As soon as you are critical towards killers in this community you get down voted.
---
If the killer is spamming the button, the hatch closing will take priority over the survivor jumping in. Spirit should have just spammed the button, she woulda gotten a nice 4k
---
That would be pretty cool. I posted the same thing, except with just Pyramid Head.
---
‚ÄúMr Smith hasn‚Äôt been the same ever since we found him in the basement in the preschool, 6 years after he went missing.‚Äù
---
horrible, because it could possibly glitch the game out if they have ruin
---
Doors, most of the time, spawn so close to each other it wouldn't be fair with this version of noed. Not only that, but as many mentioned, if you are being chased outside, it basically makes it impossible for you to escape, so no searching for noed for you. 
---
Honestly, I don't think this community is capable of reworking noed without it being bullshit still, so I am just gonna wait until the end of times until BHVR decides to make it better.
---
...you know what? At the start I was ready to just sigh heavily and state the usual "NOED is BS but so is Adrenaline. Fix both."
---
While I still say Adrenaline needs to be adressed, honestly? This would be the best change to NOED and fuck over those cocky little shits that wanna tBag at the gates. Man coupled with a fully stacked STBFL it would be a slaughtering ground of Karma.
---
Though there is the slight issue of sub 24 meter terror radius killers. Michael or Hag with Monitor or Doc with monitor and calm. Cuz then survivors get no warning the killers near and so they get boned with no warning.
---
I do think at Max rank the radius should be 24 meters...or maybe depend on the killers terror radius - 8/10 meters? But then again that would make it useless on those tiny radius killers...hmm...
---
.... I have no respect for a NOED user. As a killer main I‚Äôm disgusted.
---
Nsfw tags exist, use them!!
---
 Problem with this community is that it is probably 98% killers and 2% survivors. And as soon as you say anything close to negative to a killer the toxicity begins.. I don't understand why we can't all just have fun together and share fun and educational stuff from the game....
---

---
I feel bad when I do have to tunnel. I like running Ruin and Dying Light, with the hope that during normal game play I will kill the obsession before Ruin is popped, but, sometimes you just gotta slow the game down and take out the obsession.
---
It's a really annoying build, so I like to let the last survivor escape when I play it.
---
Someone who‚Äôs a high rank playing on an account that‚Äôs a lower level
---
Blocking gates just because you are near them sounds a little too strong
---
I think instead of changing the perk altogether they should add a totem counter into the game.
---
You're going to get bullied if you play against strong rank 1s, but you're going to get bullied if you're not playing the top tier killers anyway. So go for it if you already play low tier killers, I know survivors can get very greedy against him, don't respect pallets and you could use their greediness to your advantage.
---
No offense, but What the hell is clown world
---
My favourite DBD moment. I actually do love seeing this kind of mistake(?).

Well when they teabag and flashlight click it just leaves them still so I can lodge an axe between their eyes
---
*made with memeatic*
---
Pip with 2 memento's kills?
---
Lol the same as I said. This subreddit is probably about 98% killers and if you say anything close to critical you get down voted as crazy...
---
Seriously, when are the devs gonna realize that being black actually gives you an advantage in a dark themed, horror based game? Claudette is fucking invisible at times. Keep her black or whatever, but at least make all of her outfits bright or something.
---
You forgot the part where I miss the DS skillcheck
---
Best clip i've seen today, thank you i needed that
---
Careful, they are gonna start a biker gang and team up on you

Yeah but not every game at high ranks is swf

don't need perks if you jumpscare killers out of their chair with that mug.
---
As long as I pip it's a win, but since sometimes 4ks are not a pip I don't know.

Yeah us noob Killer mains out here downvoting all those pro survivor mains smh

You're playing with a controller and it hurts my soul.
---
Yea i didn't catch the exploit train either but i feel like his abillity can still be used in many situations. It is indeed stupid to stab someone a 2nd time and just give them a sprint burst while gaining literally nothing.
---
I'd be happy with a silent hill style map alone. Whether you look at the films or movies for reference, they both do a solid job of keeping an eerie feel to the environment, even without all of the fuckery going on.
---
Karma for what? Did he do something before the video started? If that had been me, I would have healed up to try to protect the last survivor - I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs delaying the game at all since he‚Äôs not the last one there. Of course, bloody bad luck that there‚Äôs blood warden. By not chasing him out, you got yourself an extra kill.
---
No, with the Freddy rework he might be widely considered the worst killer the game. Besides maybe Pig. Some of his perks are good, BBQ is all the rage for killers still. But Billy does chainsaw MUUUUUUUUUUUUCH better. Bubba is basically a meme killer for insidious basement camping.
---
To be honest, i do find this idea very interesting, And it works well with the concept of "no one escapes death" having the exit gates being the thing that poses the greatest threat to them during the end game. Kudos to you for the idea
---
Removed - Personal drama
---
im blind oaf i still cant see it
---
A whole 10 minute video? Why?
---
satisfying to watch
---
I was chasing someone else (with moniter and abuse so he definitely heard me coming) and I heard him healing in a cornfield two feet away from me. He was the first to die but I had 2 others dead on hook when I found him.
---
I can relate to this
---
Idk.... I‚Äôve seen some really fucked up hits with huntress, Plag, Freddy and Pig. Their lunges being super inconsistent, sometimes they are really long sometimes super short, sometimes they hit around the corner and they havent even turned it yet.
---
Welcome to the Hookers club.
---
Huntress' lore speaks of soldiers she ambushed, nurse has a WW2 gas mask with her nurse uniform, and Bill exists. So I dont know what you're talking about.
---
I mean I'm not defending teabagging or flashlight clicking, but that stuff is just annoying. Facecamping actually kind of ruins gaming experience for everyone in that match. Honestly facecamping a teabagging survivor probably just fuels them because then they know they got on your nerves. Get thicker skin.
---
Ace, Tapp, Ash, Bill, technically old Jake.
---
Goddamnit this was really funny
---
ahh yes i‚Äôm bad because i got a 4k and that‚Äôs not allowed
---
**PSST! HEY KID, GOT ANY REDBULL?**
---
Given that their last OC was Plague, I'd rather have a licensed killer.
---
‚ÄúYou had absolutely no right to stick your nose in my business‚Äù hahah
---
nice
---
The only time I shit on the opponent is when his internet is from uganda or some shit. I know it's more DbDs fault than then players, but shit like that makes me too frustrated and angry to care : /
---
Okay, if you wish to make the game harder for yourself that's for you. There are plenty bad people at high ranks and the killer can always return to hooks to get a new chase especially Nurse.
---
I agree that hiding if you good IF you don't get found, the big problem is if you do get found the first hit is probably free while I probably would have ran early to get into a better position for a chase. It's okay if you want to play to the theme of the game, but please realize that it's the inferior strategy.
---
 Your claim that the skill ceiling for having perfect chases is low is just laughable, I would love to see your vault mindgames I would be very surprised if they were any good.
---
I don't watch any big dbd streamers.
---
ACEapp
---
If I'm being honest I would KILL for the Halloween 2018 mask for michael way more than the other masks in the series
---
I have a fix for that and I guarantee once you try it you will be hooked!
---
I'm looking at bloodpoints. 20k and more and I am happy
---
But it's more toxic to hold the chainsaw. You know, flexing your toxicity and whatnot.
---
Yeah, my randoms usually all try to hook save.  They don't have a clue what gens are.
---
"chuckles" i am in danger
---
If you‚Äôre gonna get upset about it, you‚Äôre going to have a shit time playing this game 
---
Also, it‚Äôs at the very lowest end of the toxicity scale
---
You shouldn't be seeing all 5 gens popped as Pig. Her traps are meant to slow the game down.
---
It's even more terrifying because it looks like he replaced his own eyes with wooden ones
---
Why wouldnt it? At this point they should just whore out their licenses cuz they aint gons do shit with their games.
---
That‚Äôs not the point
---
bro it‚Äôs 600 over the ditch? Lmao when was the last time Australia got new internet cables, 2010?

---
It's also common for experienced players to teach their new friends how to play.
---
Brilliant
---
This is an interesting idea, what about a complete change to it? It no longer gives the speed boost, but locks down the gates until the totem is destroyed? This would still be powerful, but it would prevent killers from just chain downing the entire team. Before people spam downvote, please remember I‚Äôm just giving an idea, if you don‚Äôt like it fine, I‚Äôm just trying to figure out a way to remove free instadowns. I feel the version provided by op makes to fully useless,  as it will only work if you directly chase someone into the gate, or everyone will just run between gates the whole time.
---
If traps activated automatically when placed after the gens are done, it'd be basically impossible to escape.
---
No, you‚Äôd have to remove it and escape. Exactly like it was before
---
Yeah, just play one side til your will to live is gone and swap to the other. Browse memes on the side. Best way to enjoy the game.
---
Survivors could jump through the hatch before, now you can close it.
---
Unlucky
---
Not when multiple survivors are still in the game
---
Dude chill, there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with it.
---
... I hope this stuff at least sounds cool in your head. Triggered crayon eaters? Are you eleven years old?
---
True. Just learn to get the kills before the gens are popped.
---
Ah ok sry
---
there‚Äôs a dbd Wikipedia for a reason lol
---
K best killer in the whole dbd community
---
YMMD XD
---
Yeah but it's not even the rarest version.
---
It's. A. Video game. What are you missing about that?
---
Tilted about camping lol where was that? I thought you said you were done, begone.
---
Smack em
---
I guess that's just a mechanic wich rare amount of killer can use so whatever.
---
\#Aprettygoodjobsofar
---
honestly at optimal level mate you‚Äôll be destroyed, you‚Äôll be made an M1 killer and at that point he‚Äôs deemed useless tbh
---
Deleet this post or you will loose subscreybre
---
‚ÄúLook who‚Äôs shittin in the tall grass‚Äù
---
Ok, Mario
---
Didn‚Äôt know borrowed time and left behind were part of his perks, thanks!
---
ah ok thanks
---
New killer looks scary AF
---
adreanline is good any tier really
---
Yeah it's not that much considering the cosmetics shop is so expensive. But I bought my Wraith a nice outfit so I'm happy.
---
I can not figure out if you want to mock me for pointing out facts about the differences because you think I am a console hater or you yourself are a console hater and this is your way of saying PC Masterrace.
---
Yeah , but now you could patrol the boxes with the  endgame timer and let them sacrifice through the entity. So they nerfed her to keep it fair. Her traps are just for slowing down the game, they arent fit for endgame.
---
In the wikia its stated that he tried to reserch the entity, and that he may have created the hatch. We also know that the entity can discart someone if such person cannot feed it anymore. If Vigo eventully got to know about this, he could surely find a way to make the entity discart him or let him out.
---
Fantastic idea. BHVR pls implement now
---
you can go out with a beartrap if it's not activated, this was an amanda nerf a couple of patches ago.
---
I've always wondered why they never tried to capitalize on horror game characters.
---
Cccccombo
---
Who the hell puts their tv specs in their profile?
---
he got the rancor with the DS, he didn't had it before, so he cannot see the killer when gens completed. if this was not an swf he has no information about rancor being active.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with my gameplay. I play fine and am pretty good. But when you have 3 survivors body blocking and spinning it‚Äôs a joke. Then you hook them and get ‚ÄúYoUrE tOXiC‚Äù
---
Because by the time I go for the second hit the survivor I‚Äôm holding has already wriggled free, when the 3 others are all circling/ body blocking it‚Äôs hard to hit the same one. If they each take a hit the one being held has time to escape.
---
real microsoft employers
---
I happened to get put in the same game with two of the players straight after, got payback on those mofos
---
wait do you identify with the scaredy cat perk as a survivor or am i missing something
---
Most people think that a 3k or 4k is a win, but I currently only consider a win when I get a pip or one person rage quits lul
---
 O O F
---
This. NOED is the only perk I hate, but at the same time. I always get flak for running DS and Adrenaline when I'm in tryhard mode. So it evens out. 
---
Also, I run small game and eat every totem, every game.
---
Killers are usually surprised until they see my name.
---
"Hex: Totem Cruncher"
---
Oh no, I didn't mean someone using such language. In no way do I approve of that behavior. That's also not what I was explaining with my first comment. I am talking about critiquing behavior that is worth pointing out. In my opinion, everyone loses when the salt gets involved.
---
They should merge we'll make it and we're gonna live forever into the same perk.
---
New gameplay update: Killers can now hook generators
---
Don't do anything you wouldn't want done to you as a survivor. That's the only rule I live by. Hide the chat, because there will always be salt. Losing isn't fun, especially in this day and age of "everyone is a winner".
---
A proper way to play? You can‚Äôt body body block?    *where did i miss the memo* 
---
But jokes aside, it can be frustrating but hitting and ignoring works. And it doesn‚Äôt happen every game.   BUT, if it bothers you so much ‚Äúmad grit‚Äù is the perfect counter. 
---
But DCing is literally what‚Äôs wrong with this game. Don‚Äôt do that.
---
Nice
---
I don't farm BP. I farm salt. Seeing a ttv player get Mori'd in the first minute of the game is ALL too satisfying.
---
r/tihi
---
He was teabagging at the gate after hitting DS. Last guy was on deathhook so it's obvious he was sitting around to taunt the killer.
---
If you're looking for a killer that doesn't need preping or add-ons, try nurse, huntress and wraith
---
Nurse is all about muscle memory, so she is better without them.
---
Huntress' hatchets are good without add-ons.
---
Wraith's add-ons are unnecessary.
---
This is the best bot I've ever seen. Holy shit.
---
I didn‚Äôt have insidious yet :(
---
Cool shading and all, but basically.. [a trace/copy](http://puu.sh/DVWG3/309b2161c0.jpg) again..?
---
Its a escalation system 24,48,1week perm
---
i just wish his chainsaw was better
---
i may be wrong bc i‚Äôm not a ds user but it tells you when rancor is active. i explained in more detail this clip in another comment if you want to understand my point for allowing him to finish the door but i wasn‚Äôt trying to bm him. he had used his deadhard which is why it looked like i hit the lever so i waited for him to open the door so it would proc blood warden i didn‚Äôt want to open the door myself so it would tell him bw was a thing.
---
Just learn to counter different moves. You can also just put down the survivor your holding and start downing the body blockers. You have options, you just have to be willing to adapt
---
No, but if you aren't going agains toxic people and you spook them a few times using insidius near a gen you can have a few fun games
---
True, thanks for the tip! Don‚Äôt usually rage quit, infact I never have. I think I just hate megs lol.
---
Bleeding eyes mask from the original Halloween II would be pretty cool as well
---
trap was red and very active. regardless of this bills desire leaving was 100% the bad play the nea needed hatch tho i knew where it was and she ran to the gate for some reason.
---
If you have 3 survivors body blocking then no gens are getting done. Don't go for swings when survivors are trying to bait them out. Worst case scenario you get 2-3 free hits and best case you ignore them and get a hook while everyone is running around doing nothing.
---
Thanks for the tip! True, I don‚Äôt usually DC I was just mad lol.
---
If they're body blocking, they're not doing gens. That's a dream scenario for a killer.
---
Teabagging is considered taunting. Bill had decisive strike and got dropped after the killer picked him up, he teabagged at the end of the exit gate to BM the killer, basically taunting them. It's BM because he doesn't just leave, he teabags and stays at the gate, which is wasting the killer's time for more matches.
---
Rancor is more so of a if I played bad or if they get to endgame I'll get a kill perk, it's useless the majority of the match but once it activates the obession is dead 80% of the time, it's not that good but it's decent. The build you listed for spirit is pretty good I think but I would recommend stridor to hear survivors better if you aren't wearing headphones but it's optional.
---
Let me tell you a quick story that happened with me yesterday.
---
I was on the hook and this Nea was nearby, she chose to destroy a dull totem over saving me even though I was 6 meters away from here. I kept giving her the unhook signal and the killer was too far across the map so it was safe. The entity got summoned and then another survivor came and got me off the hook. When I went down she tried to come and take the points by healing me so naturally I didnt give it to her. Two seconds later the hillbilly is here and what does Nea do? She hides and let me stand in his face injured, so I point at her with the flashlight and billy understands me immediately, shakes his head and goes after her, kills her and she dies on hook. Feelsgoodman, thank you random billy.
---
It happens to me every match nowadays, but instead of high rank survivors their rank is super low and I can just play with a bad killer like the doctor or wraith
---
Trapper and megs only, twelve hooks, no add ons, final destination!
---
The only Hex I would consider worth changing to normal with minor alterations would be The Third Seal.
---
That's funny because I consider the doctor and the wraith to be pretty good as they're 2 of my mains
---
You‚Äôll just get exhausted for 20 seconds less, it‚Äôs not really a game changer whether it‚Äôs tier 1 or 3.
---
I used to use Rancor with Save The Best For Last and Play With Your Food (And Monitor and abuse) on Freddy for a funny "Ignore obsession all game, one-punch-mori at the end" build. Used to instagib people running MoM + Dead Hard + Deliverance/Adrenaline + Decisive Strike with an instaheal back when MoM first came out and it was pretty hilarious. I can never thank the devs enough for making Mettle Of Man an obsession perk because that build was one of the funniest things to run and actually was somewhat viable.  
---
I also use it on Hillbilly for tracking but the free Mori is nice, 
---
It's a decent perk but it's effectively a sidegrade to bitter murmur. I like it because it shows where EVERYONE is, and not just the guys who popped the gen like bitter murmur does. 
---
I find it best for when I have Mori dailies. It's not a great perk but it has some novelty(One Punch builds)/utilitarian(Mori Dailies) use.
---
I've done fine playing him at rank 1 without camping but only when they underestimate you. Getting 2 or 3 downs early before hooking gets you enough pressure to play normally the rest of the game. Whispers and Monitor is almost essential to guarantee a fast first down, otherwise you'll struggle.
---
Everything everyone else has said is still valid. His power is pretty much used to punish when a survivor makes a mistake. Otherwise he's an m1 killer.
---
Same on XBox. Instant matches.  This happens all the time with BHVR where matchmaking gets a bit screwy, and it periodically takes forever. At least for a little while, like a week or two. Ever since I‚Äôve played the game, this has happened with both survivor and killer lobbies. Then you hear wild theories like, ‚Äúsurvivors are so weak, everyone switched to killer‚Äù or visa-versa.
---
Not every game is a good Nurse. Does that make her more fun?
---
It depends on the add ons you like to use.
---
Rancor is ok but its main benifit is just being bitter murmur, my rank 1 spirit build is BBQ,Ruin,PGTW,M&amp;A.
---
Get some sleep, Quentin!
---
Haha tbh I just started playing! So I haven‚Äôt had a chance to grind out all the other killers perks, but I am working on it !
---
Servers are definitely not empty. Obviously there are slower queue times throughout parts of the day but (for me) never more than a few minutes. Devs also update pretty frequently but the game is never without its share of bugs.
---
Haha fair enough man, but I just started so I only have a select handful of perks to choose from!
---
I'll give you a pre-emptive upvote while also backing you up by saying:
---
Teabagging/Flash clicking is just intended disrespect.
---
Facecamping is intended disrespect AND removing their ability to play the game.
---
Personally, I'm of the opinion that if you do one, the other deserves to happen to you, though. Don't camp and I won't teabag, don't teabag and I won't camp, but ultimately I guess camping is worse from an objective view.
---
Yeah same and max the hunter/deviousness solid points game
---
Look at how they massacred my boy
---
Every time I spawn in Killer Shack I have an overwhelming urge to pull the pallet down.
---
This is against the rules
---
well ur right
---
&gt;It's widely regarded as an S-tier perk.
---
If people are downvoting you, then it's clear that most people do NOT consider it one of the best perks. 
---
So that statement was just a lie.
---
I have no idea, never had that happen to me.It sounds like a bug
---
Very true assumption, doctor is my highest rank killer (obviously) and I just started playing maybe 1 month ago at most. So I usually am trying to split up blood points between him, my survivors, and other killers
---
holy shit 120 downvotes
---
The game is region locked to a certain extent to prevent further lag. I'm an EU player that get 70-90 ping if I play in EU however I have lots of US friends and when I play with them I am sucked into US servers which sucks for me. The lowest ping I ever get is around 170 and I usually get more than 200+ because of the cross region BS. And since US an EU are pros the top 2 continents for best ping, well..
---
This is actually terrifying
---
"Hay guise its me. Whats up. Oh where's everyone going?"
---
well i think his H40 mask is the only mask that doesn't look downright stupid, that being said, i want halloween 4 michael's mask too
---
Could be. I'm too lazy to google it and also my memory in numbers is garbage so I admit my defeat with no hesitation.
---
Oh no, 26 out of 131 124 users downvoted my comment. That clearly means the majority of the DBD fanbase thinks the perk isn't top-tier.  
---
Top kek
---
It's *almost* like not everyone found this subreddit at the exact same moment, meaning we are doomed to eventually re-read every single argument we've had in 3 years for eternity. The entity's torture is truly cruel.
---
They had adrenaline, dead hard, one had ds and one had borrowed time. All these perks can save the game, but since the killer had noed, a fucking totem perk that a lot of timws wont activate he had to win the game? Really dude?? He lacks game knoledge, thats true, but at this point your just being a cunt and your argument doesn't has a lot of logic behind it
---
Once you get to purple ranks ruin is pretty much a necessity. Even if it's gone in 2 minutes that's 2 minutes the game isn't over in. If you don't like ruin though check out corrupt intervention
---
Oh yeah it's a really nice design, the most unique map in the game (hehe)
---
Honestly man, I just want a counter on Small Game that shows how many totems are left. Who wants to go around counting how many broken bone piles there are around the map?
---
Rancor is a decent perk in terms of how strong it is, but it is up there with dying light in being the biggest asshole perks to run. The effect for the first few gens is functionally a worse bitter murmur. Yes you don't get quite as much information with bitter murmur, but the survivors not knowing where you are makes bitter murmur much better. Once all gens are done this perk practically guarantees you get minimum one kill though. Trouble is, if that is what you are using it for, you might as well just run No One Escapes Death because if you can catch someone after exit gates are powered, odds are they aren't getting away anyway, and that perk lets you snowball better. More than anything though, I don't use rancor because I play both sides and the aspect of 'fuck you in particular' that comes from this perk is just super frustrating for the survivor unlucky enough to be picked as the obsession.
---
Why doesn't Jeepers Creepers killer have a chance? Ever since they whored out for the 3rd shitty movie that series has got to be a bargain bin IP.
---
This isn‚Äôt how I play most of the time, only when survivors intentionally go out of their way to irritate me. I don‚Äôt have a problem ruining their game if they are doing nothing by ruining my fun experience.
---
They are not actually ;-;
---
Im lower ranks they only work becayse they don't know hoe to keep running or to keep an eye out fot the killer, but at red ranks they will Bully you a lot since you don't have the pressure or a effective way to deal with loops
---
1. Some perk changes and Legion rework.
---
2. No. 3. Freddy will be reworked this week, Cannibal is still the same. 4. They closed the jungle gym's walls. 5. Plague is good and fun to play, not op and not too weak, new Legion is a lil bit weak, Ghostface has the problem that sometimes his reveal doesn't work, Ash's perks are all three useless as fuck. 6. MoM was meta until his murder.
---
If you ‚Äúplay for fun‚Äù why do you care how good Leatherface is?
---
How were you ‚Äútrolled‚Äù?
---
People suggested him because he has good perks, you bought him and now you‚Äôre crying about it.
---
She downed him right after he opened it, I doubt she was going to be nice.
---
This happens at the end of the game, when current NOED goes active. Why would you be patrolling gens when they are all finished?

---
He's saying he was nice enough to let him finish the gate before downing him. 
---
I don't know that it was an act of kindness so much as intentionally activating BW. I suppose he could have downed Bill then opened the gate himself, depriving Bill of the points if he wanted to be a "dick" but either way cool clip.

---
Borrowed time? What? You get the endurance effect after unhooking yourself?
---
You run around doing nothing, while 3 people die on the hook. You're running 'no mither' and all you care for is the escape, but you're not going for adept. You escape through the hatch and end up with only 13191 points, 7000 of those coming from the hatch.
---
Pig‚Äôs addons really need buffs/reworked honestly
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the greatest perk but it‚Äôs Adams best perk so I would say pick it up now so you don‚Äôt have to get Adam later
---
It's not, it's tactical planning. She used the survivor to trigger her perk. If you think about it she was kind to him because she could have just downed him there and then to kill him on a hook but instead let him open the gate giving him points and giving her the perk. It's smart play and I'm sure killers want to win so they need to kill peeps to do so
---
is this Tuesday
---
That is similar to what they did with ruin and PGTW. I approve
---
Exactly it‚Äôs a video game, peoples actions are intended to infuriate other people, giving survivors a false sense of security/hope is just being toxic and a douchebag.
---
It‚Äôs the same as survivors pointing at the hook making the killer think they can get a free kill and then DS to escape out. These actions obviously piss people off.
---
I usually just go for a pip. That's a win in my book.
---
Maybe it was that Nea over there
---
&gt;If you played as Ace
---
In all honesty I've only played Ace for like 6 matches, ever.
---
waaaaah.... toxic survivors.... waaaaah
---
Y'all got anymore of those pre-nerf DS's?
---
Definitely, would be a cool idea for a perk, where the killers get a slight boost but there exposed or something.
---
oh I took that to mean when the hex activates it blocks gates, not anytime you go near them. Still this is a straight downgrade to current noed and I don't see survivors being hit by it very often. So I guess if your goal was to neuter noed you nailed it.
---
I‚Äôd rather them down me and open the gate themselves. Don‚Äôt agree with the fake kindness/sympathy.
---
tomorow is tuesday
---
upvote this
---
but, but, but all survivors gen rush
---
Well I try not to get hooked immediately for starters.  Also Borrowed Time ensures me a safe hook rescue more often than not.
---
Driver of the first car
---
Not when killers can activate the perk themselves, still consider this toxic.
---
Wait, Compass closed down in 1981 and re-emerged a few years later as Trancas which is an affiliate of Universal. They also produced all Halloween movies, so it shouldn't be an issue at all.
---
well i wasn‚Äôt trying to give the survivor a false sense of security i had chased him prior and has lunged to attack him but he deadharded to make me whiff. i disagree with ur points bc my own opinion conflicts with it but again i was not trying to give this bill false hope. he was always going to die :)
---
The Mid-Chapter patch is scheduled for tomorrow.
---
My experience with Clowns is that they almost always play like arseholes, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a community-wide stereotype. Maybe the game crashed or their internet cut out, or maybe they were just salty for some reason.
---
I thought dcing was toxic D:
---
oh trust me i‚Äôm the same way that‚Äôs just what i remember myself but i also could be wrong!
---
Or when they slowly crouch walk up to you and headnod, always cracks me up lol.
---
Oh. Okay, nice. Is there also a date when this chapter ends?
---
60 Bloodwebs in but at least you haven't gotten forced to take Slippery meat. I see that as a win.

---
Bloodwarden and NoED in one perk? Sign me tf up
---
It is the point. Sure they can kill. But they‚Äôre probably not going to if you go up against good survivors.
---
I know I mean that when he opened the gates she had him where she wanted him to kill him. Obviously he surprised her with ds and so knowing she lost she moved on. It's his fault he died. He could have won but that's the way some things go.
---
I advice you to buy Spirit. She's way better than clown and plague

Wait what this is a thing

apart from playing against Freddie in every survivor game
---
Terrible advice
---
Hot take- the f13 remake is one of the best movies in the franchise.
---
Insta heals and balanced landing on Haddonfield isn't toxic. It's leveraging a map to play to your strengths. 
---
DCing bc u don't wanna play Haddonfield and would like to waste everyone else's time is toxic.
---
yes and no
---
depends on the map honestly
---
He's a baby Dwight he gets a pass.
---
How do you outsmart someone when they can hear you, see your trail if you run, or just use collision? Not trying to be snarky, genuinely asking. If Spirit phases at a loop your options are: move towards her, move around the loop, run away from the loop. Except that she‚Äôs much faster than you and can still track you without having to see you while you can‚Äôt track her at all, so I don‚Äôt understand how any of those three options are gonna buy you more than a few seconds. What is the mindgame, exactly?
---
so you think as the killer you are the judge and jury... cool... this is exactly why the game is shitty. because of this attitude.
---
Camping ruins the game for everyone involved. just get thicker skin. and you'll enjoy the game more. camping does nothing for anyone.
---
Getting camped is more punishing sure, but yeah it is a dick move to do either. I don‚Äôt understand why people can‚Äôt figure that out.
---
This. I play with a group of about 8 people on rotation. Me and another buddy are red rank survivors, and they're all over the place. So sometimes you'll get a game with a rank 3, a rank 2, a rank 15, and a rank 10. Sorry. We're just having fun, and unfortunately there's only one mode that we can play together. Give us an unranked mode and it won't be a problem. =\
---
Then I can run fun stuff. Like Deliverance, and No mither without being a hindrance.
---
my god could you be more sensitive? jeez
---
i did allow the bill to open the gates for points. i‚Äôm a survivor main so i know the desire to get in those last points. plus i didn‚Äôt want to open the gate myself i didn‚Äôt want to announce i had blood warden i like it to be a surprise! 
---
i had shown kindness in allowing him to get his points bc in my mind he was dead either way. and if he did escape it would have been fine to me as well i had already had his stack. if the bill would have left immediately after ds‚Äôing me this clip would have just showed me getting outplayed instead he got greedy either for points or for the potential altruism and postgame chat the bill said some very reportable stuff so that was more desire to post this lol 
---
i hope this clears it up for everyone!
---
Bullied all game how though. I always see people saying this but how can you really bully the killer? They cant be damaged or have anything even done to them, if you go near them you get murdred. They probably all played well and used everything they could to survive and clicked a flashlight and now they‚Äôre bullies.
---
&gt;Survivors who put an offering for Haddonfield know how to loop the Strode House, otherwise they wouldn't waste the offering.
---
That's why I said it's leveraging a map to play to your strengths. This is like if a Doctor burned a game offering and had all the "increases TR in Treatment" perks. That's not toxic, that's someone playing to their strengths. It doesn't suddenly become toxic bc a Survivior decided to do it. 
---
&gt;So I need to play specific killers on this map, so you recognised that this map is unwinnable for some killers.
---
You don't *need* to do anything. If you complain about Haddonfield and make no effort to play around the prospect of it then I can't have sympathy for you. Sry. 
---
&gt;Trapper is garbage, Hag is countered by flashlights and Plague is still very loopable on this map
---
I only proposed Plague as an instaheal counter bc she's a strong anti healing killer. Nobody is gonna flashlight a trap mid chase unless they have the space or you let them. 
---
&gt;Balanced Landing on Haddonfield.
---
Get. Over. It. When I said not everyone can loop the Strode house that literal translates to "all 4 Surviviors cannot loop the Strode house at the same time. If one is looping it, learn when to break chase".
---
One would guess they'd get mad with the one that DCd. But i guess you're the tryhard.
---
And yet here we have loads of killer mains crying about tea bagging.
---
Pyramid Heads power could be to make an "other" version of the map, with respawned pallets and rerolled loops, but he is faster and everybody becomes exposed. Conjuring the other world would take a few second to give survivors a lead, and would need to last a fairly short amount of time so it isn't overpowered.
---
Throw a baby dwight to the wolves, and in 3 months you'll see him again leading the pack of dwights with DS and Adrenaline. &lt;3
---
If you DC against a Nurse with no add ons then ur bad.
---
If she has Omegablink then yeah...I got nothin
---
As killer, we literally are the executioner after the entity was judge and jury. The game‚Äôs shitty because both sides and toxic, period. Camping removes a toxic from the game, which is indeed a plus, it should not be up to me to ‚Äúget thicker skin‚Äù because someone else decided to be an asshole. I enjoy the game plenty, partly from killing toxic survivors.
---
you ignore it. it applies pressure to the unhooker for a minute, making them less effective
---
I know it's been 3 months since you posted that comment but I caught up on JoJo, and I get the joke.
---
lmao, nice
---
&gt; He ruined the life of a young child, and is still free. 
---
Again, he pleaded himself guilty and was sentenced to 3 years in prison. What else do you want? Life sentence? Death penalty?
---
&gt; I respect the devs for not wishing to follow it 
---
And where does this come from? I never heard devs saying anything about it.
---
Even nurses without addons destroy teams, let alone solo survivors.
---
Your ideas will make NOED overpowered,so that's not fixing it.
---
you're getting worked into a shoot son. it shouldnt be up to the survivor to stop having fun because you have made up rules and think he should be caught and stared at for 2 minutes. 
---
camping ruins the game for survivors. so.... you keep on thinking you're above the game.
---
Playing around Haddonfield LOL. It's enough 1 survivor to loop the house while the others do gens. They can destroy Hag traps before they get into a chase. If you trap mid chase, they already used their Balanced Landing. You simply cannot win on this map with the set ups presented unless you play a specific killer or survivors are very stupid.
---
Hmm, right you are. But I‚Äôd imagine negotiations with Universal would still need to take place.
---
You'd think at this point both sides would realize that if one of these happens, they are asking for the other to happen.
---
How is three years anywhere near enough? As I say, why give such a monster any more exposure and money? Do you genuinely think that three years in jail is anywhere near punishment enough?
---
Pretty sure the devs confirmed it on stream after people confirmed an offhand comment as a teaser for a Jeepers Creepers chapter.
---
Great idea, I am for it
---
The thing is when someone is mid chase, and the last gen pops for their adrenaline so they begin to run to another loop or to a exit gate, there is nothing they can do to avoid getting downed from the killer who is suddenly faster and able to insta down you. It‚Äôs just upsetting.
---
Just for survivors who don't clear totems. Since there's 5 on the map, you will always have a chance and even a second chance once gates are powered. Ex: hiding in locker next to a broken totem
---
Well I guess this is one way to find out about bad news.
---
You can 4k with any killer on any map if survivors play badly, it doesn't depends on you. You never are gonna win as Huntress on Cowshed for example unless you play against bad survivors. If you break the chase, but that survivor will go to repair a gen, while the other survivor is gonna loop you again. You can't break the chase forever and if all survivors have Balanced Landing on Haddonfield, then it doesn't matter. 
---
If you place a trap as Hag after someone used BL, you lost that chase, while 3 gens are probably gonna get done. It doesn't matter you made the loop weaker if you are gonna lose anyway.
---
Dang I haven't played since the hag release. Who is this killer and what's that bar up top?
---
That's funny because I've always said Quentin looks methed up anyway.
---
This is like someone turned that up to 10 and broke the knob off.
---
He abused a 12 year old boy on one of his films, Clownhouse. He performed oral sex with the boy, and filmed him sexually. In fact, he only ended up serving 15 months of his 3 year sentence before being freed.
---
There are the details. I'm aware of how the legal system works, and I ask you again; do you genuinely think that three years in jail, of which he only served a bit over a year, is anywhere near punishment enough?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cge1x4/reminder_to_ps4_survivor_mains_the_silhouette_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not really childish but oh üê≥
---
It‚Äôs an altruistic build. Sprint burst is simply for getting to hooks faster.
---
yeah she could‚Äôve easily have hit me
---
Pencil Crayon
---
I actually think that looked pretty normal. Sure he shook a little bit but I think that was due to the auto aim on lunges.
---
Turn off the vibration on controller
---
I bring out my spicy 5 blink nurse
---
Wow that was nice man!
---
I like the idea of this. You get your instant downs AND a continuous Blood Warden. I think the effectiveness of the perk depends on how close you have to be to block the gate.
---
If it's based on terror radius this can be a guarantee kill or slugfest. If it's less than that it can give people a chance to chicken out and bolt if they hear their heart beat going near the exit gate.
---
Admittedly it would be fun if it were a static range too. Having the exit suddenly get blocked for no reason, only to turn around and see Myers standing there stalking you would be hella spoopy.
---
The killer is named the spirit and the bar up top is what is called the end game collapse which basically when a exit door is opened or the hatch is close by the killer the timer starts and if survivors don‚Äôt escape during the time period they get sacrificed to the entity.
---
The fuck you were right. I deinstalled the Lightning Program I have for changing the colors inside my pc and now it runs just fine
---
Oh wow so now you can't camp forever? And killers can close the hatch now? Haha sheesh.
---
Selfish Care isn‚Äôt altruistic lol
---
You got it boss!
---
It's fixed. Thanks for the help
---
I doubt her foot can reach my head
---
It's fixed. Thanks for your help
---
I'm living for that nurse one. If it's gonna be as good as these, I can't wait!
---
In the bin with you.
---
I'd like to believe that Feng Min always smiles behind her surgical mask.
---
Damn im on a trip to at least saturday at least i saved up a million before i left
---
pretty much yeah haha it‚Äôs a pretty nice change overall
---
How about this:
---
Noed: If exit gates are powered on before 9 minutes, all survivors gains exposed for rest of the match.
---
Essentially anti gen rush perk.
---
thanks!
---
Or just long range camp
---
How is "protect the generators" in any way bad advice? IT IS LITERALLY ONE OF THE KILLER'S OBJECTIVES!
---
Hey atleast you didn't say Susie is hot because only weebs and Edgelords say that
---
Ps4
---
In my opinion keys is essentially survivors's mori. Keys and Moris shouldn't be in this game.
---
I think OP is saying LF is hard to play against as a Survivor.
---
yeah that's why he didn't scream
---
just a regular hit
---
neither lol.
---
should have wrote "So Ddb on..." to make it clearer
---
Thanks for making devs know about this. I bet you‚Äôre a survivor main ü§¨
---
There's nothing wrong with killing the survivors. it just sucks for them that they're down 25% of their "power".
---
I see no God up here.... OTHER THAN ME.
---
when there's a rule saying no bug reports and posts of the sort are automatically removed but you still don't think it's intended and post it anyways smh
---
Those were all fun skins don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Oh. I mean so? Why leave.
---
there is nothing toxic about being a bit lonely and frisky sometimes
---
None taken, I wish that could be my reaction too
---
*Obligatory snu snu rape joke*
---
Blood warden isn't the only issue though. The killer could be proxy-camping, which requires borrowed time to save the hooked person most likely at the expense of yourself. NOED could be active and hidden in some obscure part of the map that's not worth searching for because you're running out of time. The person on the hook could be across the map from where the gate you're at is. Some people also don't just have the time to stick around for altruism.
---
Dammit. I love using mine but I'll just let my wife do the job instead.
---
Bruh
---
u/nwordcountbot u/marsharko
---
That explains why I could see the auras lol. Thanks for explaining.
---
marsharko has not said the N-word yet.
---
R1 killer main. Spirit enthusiast, though I tend to play a lot of killers.
---
This particular bug is interesting because it's so beneficial to the killer, but there's no way of avoiding its benefits. It's not a matter of simply not using add-ons (like Legion mending) or perks (like Wake Up). If it was, I wouldn't be posting.
---
Yes considering when the gates are powered it won't matter too much, it's to help with dailies and to give killers something that's still useable even when all survivors have removed the secondary effects.
---
Even if it were a bug, shit is still 4v1 and you should win easily if you all have brain stems.
---
Didn't you say you've commissioned yourself?
---
No clue on the actual stream, since people have been asking for Jeepers Creepers since August 2018. To be fair, even if the devs haven't outright said it, (I'm pretty sure they have), it's logically sound. It'd be a messy situation to force players to choose between not supporting a pedophile, and missing out on game content.
---
The Jason shit has never been mentioned by the devs, but we aren't likely to see Jason due to; 
---
1) The ongoing lawsuit
---
2) The Friday The 13th Game
---
LOL
---
I would've disconnected, not even kidding.
---
well obviously you WERE killing them so it's not wasted
---
and maybe he wants more pips? if you had hooked meg again he wouldve lost altruism pips. if he takes her with him he doesnt
---
i‚Äôm not a killer main at all, but ‚Äúreddit killer‚Äù is a popular saying. i think it‚Äôs about even as far as people complaining. survivors get to bitch in end game chat and killers come here to get comfort from their other killer mains. it‚Äôs the circle of life.
---
"Survivors within 8/12/16 meters of the exit gates the survivors suffer from the exposed status" So they now that you have noed instantly.
---
I am aware of all this, I can use google too, but I am sure that it is still not all the details, and even more so none of us know how this trial proceeded. I prefer to trust the judicial system. If the court sentenced him to 3 years, then this was enough.
---
Huntress is my wife and I want her to just hold me and cuddle me and keep me safe üòñ
---
i tried to get my friend into Dead by Daylight. He played his first game ever (rank 20, obviously) as a survivor. Following that, he immediately got a message that he was a "Trash Player" and that he should kill himself.
---
The issue is that a lot of survivors I've faced aren't aware of the issue. I understand not wanting the sub to be filled with bug reports (especially exploity ones) and thus I have no issue with the rule, but this one's arguably much different. People need to be aware of how broken the game is on PS4.
---
Yeah he knows, just making fun of the miscommunication
---
Nobody said anything about noob killers..
---
Shouldn't be toxic if you clean it.
---
WHAT
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
welcome to dbd the funniest thing that makes you want to die
---
get leatherface first for bbq n chili btw
---
Which is ironic considering that the entire story behind freddy is that he was a pedo yet he's in game. Maybe if we had gotten old freddy it wouldn't have been an issue but we explicitly received remake freddy who is canonically pedo.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I agree at this point that the top 3 aren't very fun because how F\*CKED hitboxes are?
---
But I used to think Billy and Spirit were super fun cuz juking and dodging them felt like you EARNED it
---
But now with BIlly using Cloud's buster sword for a weapon it's just like "holy shit I can't believe that didn't hit me."
---
the jokes on you, i did, kiddo!!1!1! lol xd *defult danc*
---
I just got downvoted past -100 for saying that sometimes a teabag at the gate is an excited motion for pulling something off, not necessarily because he‚Äôs toxic.. I realize this situation may be due to toxicity, but it‚Äôs not always the case yet I got pummeled haha
---
Shh.. Don't tell the devs!  This is a sneak peak of the new killer called The Addict
---
üëÄüëÑüëÄ
---
Got me
---
  
---
So, the best use for MYC is to use it as a stall perk, and if you happen to down the rescuer, it‚Äôs an added bonus? I‚Äôm wondering if I would be better off using Haunted Grounds or STBFL as a snowball perk. Thanks!
---
&gt; It's the comments that are critical that the killer slapped the lever to indicate that he was letting him leave and tricking him. Then downed him.
---
Probably bc crying that the killer "tricked" a survivor is some serious fucking crybaby shit. People here are critical of killers all the time for tunneling and facecamping or slug bleed outs
---
there's literally nothing to be critical of here unless you are made out of entitlement instead of atoms
---
lmao looks like ur upset *dab* here bro have a chocklet *giv* xd
---
Then I'm sorry bud, but you're a rape apologist. 
---
Salva's abuse of Winters is well documented. Pornography of the abuse was found within Salva's home, and the man pleaded GUILTY to all of the charges.
---
Again, it was 15 months served. As I say, if you find 15 months to be a fine punishment for ruining a child's life and recording the abuse, you are a rape apologist.
---
Sorry?
---
I'm just goin by posts I have seen on here before. I live in America
---
Not sure how toxic this really is, but I'm getting sick of SWF squads D/Cing so the last person can escape via Hatch. I've been doing some adept killer achievements after the rank reset and it's very annoying to lose out on the achievement because of this.
---
Thanks! Yea I've read a lot about that perk, seems to be the one to own! I'm trying to wait a week or so until I really get the hang of the game before I dump more money into it. But Leatherface will be my next purchase. I love using Myers just for the music. I love F13 but man this game blows it away! The tension from repairing a generator while looking around for the killer and also doing skill checks....it's unlike any other.
---
Better hope you don't get a Freddy running Jump Rope and the new black box with Dying Light. Slow gens for you and you only, and if you disconnect, Dying Light procs on the other 3.
---
I mean this is a horror game and war is one of the most horrifying things humans can experience
---
Killer also bitch in end game chat though, this subreddit is basically a killer circlejerk.
---
But it isn‚Äôt out yet, right? Is this beta?
---
I'll only ever do this with my 4 man swf group. Call one of them over from the other side of the map and slam the pallet down in their face. We all do it to each other though so it's funny.
---
&gt; "gen rushing" is literally the primary objective for survivors.
---
it is. of course everyone goes for gens. But the main difference between regular survivors and gen rushers is this:
---
* Gen rushers often all run Adrenaline and don't heal each others, they do gens instead.
---
* gen rushers don't cleanse any dull totems.
---
* gen rushers often are inside a SWF and won't leave their gens even if they hear a close heartbeat because their partners tells them they are still being chased.
---
Why would I care lol.
---
The game is supposed to be 4v1 - EVERYONE know what they're getting into... So there's no need to bring that up. Tue bug still gives the killer an unfair advantage.
---
Yes, you can still win, but they can find you even easier than normal depending what gens you're on.
---
Unless you buy them, no.
---
OP was fucking around with the survivor who he thought was as good as dead. There was no strategic reason to let him open the gate as the killer could have done it herself after downing him. It was just an example of classic DBD toxicity one-upmanship.
---
well spine chill works great on her to know if she is really moving unless she figures it out but when I loop her I change directions of the loop every so often so when she begins to faze I just move slightly to another part of the loop and it usually does greatly confuse her. I tend to face her a decent amount of time on low ranks so dealing with her just became natural. without spine chill it can be a little harder to tell if she is fazing but it can be done
---
The most toxic part is...
---
Regardless of lifestyle, the winner is liable to get messages resembling a toddler temper tantrum from the loser.
---
yeah i am too, you fucking genius

The lack of a hyperlink suggests that you‚Äôre on mobile right now

---
You‚Äôre probably 7 and it shows, if you‚Äôre NOT 7 you need to take a serious look at your life lmao
---
I'm excited but I'll need to stay away from the game for a bit. Every game is going to be a Freddy and I don't wish to do that.
---
You've probably seen me complain on here, Aussie internet outside of major cities is laughable.

Wraith at high rank is essentially an M1 killer. People with brains will see him. He‚Äôs needs a buff
---
so what do you think isn't the intended feature, then, fambamerino?
---
Trapper becomes very viable with the red addon that reopens them every 30 seconds
---
Yeah so?
---
cry mor crybabi hahshshshahshsha
---
Remember: You asked for these downvotes by outting yourself as a Spirit main.
---
I'm not really understanding your point there, mate. Freddy Krueger is a fictional character. Krueger is a killer, and is meant to be seen as detestable as the rest of the killers.
---
As far as we know, nobody involved in the Nightmare On Elm Street series is a sexual predator. Victor Salva, a real human being, who wrote and directed Jeepers Creepers, was convicted after pleading guilty to performing oral sex with a 12 year old working on a film of his, and of recording the abuse.
---
The problem that people have is that putting Jeepers Creepers into the game would be giving money to a pedophile.
---
She's adopted
---
I thought thr katana was your arm and it awas robotic.
---
Because they just wanted a free easy escape but when they didn't get it they rage quit.
---
I‚Äôm not even going to bother continuing this.
---
yes.
---
Haddonfield? I leave
---
Nothing in the game is toxic. It‚Äôs the player base plain and simple
---
So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs karma for using a perk ingame? I‚Äôm not understanding what hurt you so bad from bill
---
This is an excellent way to honor Fun World, Inc. and its exciting line of Halloween accessories.
---
haha yeah it's the second one, alright
---
go wipe your nose on the survivor's rulebook for killers now
---
True, but it is a red addon and its unlikely that you will play every trapper game with them
---
Unless you‚Äôre specifically looking to play against a random killer, why don‚Äôt you guys play *Kill Your Friends*? It‚Äôs great practice for the lower ranks especially because you can use any perk in the game for both sides, letting you practice builds or practice against a certain killer.
---
psst there are more survivor mains than killer mains on this subreddit
---
Really? I'm constantly getting to rank 1 and I never use that add on.
---
Is Kate Available for the mobile version? or only the original 4?
---
Posts say otherwise.
---
Should survivors not try to achieve their goal as quickly as possible? i honestly don't understand. i would never advise a killer to let people go, or otherwise delay their objectives.
---
Honestly watching Pyramud Head get humiliated by survivors would just be the hilarious cherry on the ridiculousness sundae that is dbd balance.
---
Continue being a toxic killer :3
---
&gt; When are they adding bots?
---
They add bots and like 75% of the survivor playerbase is going to disappear into the bot mode.
---
Heh. That's a pretty funny bot.  
---
But no, I will stay adamant what I said, because I know it to be true. Again, you can ask pretty much anyone with almost any amount of playtime (enough to know what most perks do) and they will tell you that it's one of the best perks in the game, with only minor complaints.  
---
Also, "overexaggerate" is an exaggeration of the word exaggerate. It's completely redundant to add over- before it, not to mention incorrect. If I can't "skewer" maths, you don't get to butcher grammar. ‚ô•
---
It's a build from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Tm0h0Wxfs) video, I believe. I think the main purpose of self care is so he can get back to healthy state to help people out again, and with we'll make it, it makes his personal healing speed faster than before.
---
It's my alien I stole from Area 51 aaaylmoa tell them to return to me please
---
Is the Freddy rework coming out on the 23rd?
---
So does your survivor/killer rank start at 20 then go down from there? I‚Äôm not quite sure how the seasonal rank works.
---
There are some killers who find it fun, mostly 12 year olds who looking for reactions. I‚Äôll only camp if a survivors been a dick for most of the game, or I hooked them by a gate.
---
Technically a win for a killer is when games told you you won so pipping up
---
Yes I get told to kill myself every second day.
---
Most of the times people come up with an elaborate graphical depiction of how I should end my life, what tools to use, etc.
---
I really have no idea how this shit became normal in dbd.

sorry, the actual numbers say your confirmation bias is wrong
---
what a surprise
---
I had one incident where the pig let us go, so he let everyone go, right before I got to run out he downed me, put a helmet on, let me wiggle free, and then waited for me to crawl out so the helmet killed me. That was imo a asshole move, and if I had any way of actually escaping after that move I would teabag that killer too cause he was toxic towards somebody that didn't do anything bad towards him. I know there is toxic survivors, but acting like killers are fucking saints is wrong. There is toxic killers too out there...
---
I play more survivor than killer, but nice try
---
There's things they can do to normalize the advantages that SWF can bring. Like making bond a baseline ability every survivor always has. But then they'd also need to buff killers in some way to compensate.
---
Yo what do you play it on?
---
Very true, I feel if we got rid of this, the toxicity of the community would plummet.
---
I didn't say he is trash whitout it... but i think its undeniable that he is good with it.
---
Good to see new players coming to enjoy this game but I got one question why do F13 players hate dbd so much all I see is them saying dbd is garbage and F13 is so much better so I kinda want a answer about that but anyways have fun with this game.
---
Yeah, he needs to be completely invisible at all times, and not make any noise so he can be stealthy. Survivor will still have time to run to a pallet while he uncloacks.
---
Yes.
---
SUre :D
---
That‚Äôs not because of meth, it‚Äôs because he spent most of his life searching for them mid kits
---
But with Pharmacy, you can open chests *slightly* faster!
---
Xbox
---
My team did nothing. I did most of the work.
---
Again if stealth was rewarded more then more people would play stealthily and more people would play anti-stealth Killers. But with that being said I think Doctor kind of has the monopoly on anti-stealth and I doubt Behavior could make an anti-stealth Killer to compete with The Doctor. Anti-stealth perks to compete with Whispers and BBQ? Maybe.
---
Clown is garbage, probably he was just salty because he got downed and he saw his fav streamer dces as well
---
Fair enough.
---
Survivors are toxic to killers because they run into toxic killers.
---
Killers are toxic to survivors because they run into toxic survivors. 
---
It's a saddening spiral.
---
If they arent using it as a taunt I dont think its toxic
---
Just as I thought... potato connection
---
That just shows how much killers cry out more than survivors on this subreddit.
---
you made a mistake
---
Got called sweaty for this exact reason yesterday, even though I gave the last person hatch because of an immediate DC.

Wanna know what's funny? You're sitting here crying that I'm a toxic killer main and a couple weeks ago Tru3Ta1ent was crying that I'm a toxic survivor main because I said it's obnoxious for a killer to camp a hook and a slug even if gates are open
---
being someone who actually plays both sides a lot is a mind boggling experience
---
STBFL is great because of the faster recovery because the weapon wipe slows you down by 25% I believe also if someone goes for a unhook you can down them before they can unhook
---
Totally agree, teabagging is toxic. I teabagged a little when I first started playing and soon stopped cause I realized it was just mean.
---
You need those perks as a killer to even have a chance at winning depending on the rank, but then again doesnt surprise me considering this is the only competitive ladder based game I have ever seen where the developers think balance is actually a meme.
---
I'm not sure, probably just the casuals. The one thing i'll say F13 has on DBD ( I play on xbox) is the graphics. But it's not a huge difference. I think this game is deeper than F13 and the whole hide and seek and tension of the generators really has me, not to mention the leveling up system. 
---
F13 once Jason finds you, it's hard to get away because he can see you through anything.
---
I was nervous about having no dedicated servers but so far I haven't really run into any troubles with that.
---
Very true
---
Once proper DC punishments become a thing after dedicated servers are running and stable people who DC just because they don't want to face X killer are going to get hit hard. 
---
And frankly I hope you end up in my lobbies. Gonna be playing Freddy all day tomorrow and as a former Doctor main I am one salt-powered machine and look forward to the ragequits after people get downed buttdancing next to fake pallets.
---
Meg main?
---
That's fucking dope man! The red highlights in the background really make it pop.
---
haha "my facts were proven incorrect therefore I must make something up that is not provable in any way to confirm my confirmation bias"
---
good move fam
---
I second this
---
freddy is a known pedo, it's in his story, it's intrinsic to the version of the character bhvr added to the game. To me that's worse than some pedo receiving some royalty money because it's playing the crime for laughs and scares, it's normalizing it as a trope.
---
PS: Every hook I made I just left to the opposite side of the map. Definitely not tunneling.
---
I personally use a toolbox over a flashlight as survivor üòÇ And I agree, when I play killer I try and go for the toolbox survivors first or else I‚Äôll get gen rushed ü§£
---
They did announce a new ranking system along with some kind of season format. So hopefully a season can last about 70 days then ranks would be set in. Hopefully we see this soon
---
Man, I don't even have 1k, lol, I spent all mine on Adam so I could get his perks.
---
It is indeed a saddening spiral
---
Good to get a answer I guess but yeah this game is more forgiving to Survivors and more comple, with leveling and stuff and one thing I got to say for this game is just enjoy yourself instead of worrying about rank and kills etc.
---
I really hate this "both sides" meme. What both sides? Its literally just survivors. Survivors are whiny, survivors are OP. There's not much more to it other than that. When you can achieve near 100% win rate in a "competitive ladder" game there is no semblance of both sides. There is one side, and that's survivors.
---
Do you even browse this subreddit? Please go ahead, tell me about all the posts survivors do complaining about killers.
---
Ah ok, you might also be having a bad start considering rank reset just happened
---
I when waiting for the killer to make a move when on another side of a pallet just ran in a circle it was really just to keep moving but I feel like it can be taken as toxic.
---
I'm not surprised he called you toxic.
---
Let‚Äôs face it, playing both sides I‚Äôve realized, anyone who flashlights at pallets deserves to die. It does nothing for the team. It‚Äôs kind of like a gnat flying at your face. It‚Äôs annoying but you can get through it. But if a survivor wants to bring in a flashlight and make insane flashlight saves then by all means bring a flashlight as long as it‚Äôs helping the team
---
Try not to play with crutch perks like bbq, ruin, noed, bamboozle, adrenaline, balenced landing, sprint burst. Try every killer to see what suits you.
---
I prefer to slug them.   Nothing enrages them and their chat more than a 4 minute timeout on the ground.
---
Make it so adrenaline only procs if you are within 5 meters of the final gen activating and you have a deal.
---
Yes it starts at 20, your Survivor and Killer ranks are separate. Your rank goes down by playing matches, and is reset on the 13th of every month. It used to be that everyone's rank was reset to the lowest rank, now it's only dropped by about 4-5 ranks I believe. And once you pass rank 15 you can never drop below 15 again, to keep experienced players out of new player matches.
---
Agreed. Toxicity everywhere in the game. When the killer gets a 4K, sometimes even when I pop he‚Äôll say gg ez. Survivors who did absolutely NOTHING yet escape through hatch will say gg ez too and that crap is annoying af haha you win or lose depending on how well you did, not if you survived or killed everyone.. I crouch spam when I know I‚Äôm about to die, when I say thank you for letting me go, or when I‚Äôm telling the killer to hit me at the gate for a few more BPs. But somebody told me here that any kind of crouch motion is toxic and triggering. When I play killer, it only motivates me to kill that survivor haha if they‚Äôre doing it nonstop during chase and looping really well, I just leave them and go for someone on a gen because that toxic survivor knows he can loop so I‚Äôm not gonna give it to him, while the ones on gens are probably not as good.
---
But how would you know its HG not ruin or DH?
---
Trapper is the most add-on reliant killer and his power has the most amount of counter play. 
---
He stalls himself for a power that probably won't do anything unless survivors messes up really hard. And even then, how much time you saved with that trap ? Probably not as much as you wasted placing it.
---
There is no save for poor Trapper in this gen rush meta and even with his ultra rare add-ons, he still is hard countered by SWF teams. 
---
Call me crazy, but Trapper is the worst killer in the game for me. Cannibal can at least secure 1 kill no matter what and destroy altruistic SWF teams, what Trapper can do ?
---
I agree with mom's comments on Myers and Quentin. Good taste.
---
Sounds painful
---
In coming back?
---
By bad start i meant that because you said it's a little hard
---
When it hasn‚Äôt been your day, your week, your month, or your year but you‚Äôre trying to stay positive.
---
Smh, I agree with everything in this comment. The game is just... Really "not it" in some areas sometimes.
---
Everyone starts at rank 20, and you rank up from getting "pips" for good performance each match. After you reach a certain amount of pips (it varied based on your current rank) you will go up a rank. If you don't do well for a few games in a row (once again, varies based on rank) you can go back down a rank.
---
Every 13th of the month, they do a soft reset of ranks, and you'll get lowered down to a lower rank based on the highest rank you achieved in the past month before the rank reset. A lot of this stuff varies depending on what rank you are, but it all basically boils down to it being easier to rank up at lower ranks, but once you get higher up in the ranks, it gets harder to rank up, and easier to rank down, meaning you need to play harder and better to maintain your rank or go up in ranks.
---
The best this is to use the disable chat button at the end.
---
That's honestly some ass-backwards logic, I'm sorry.
---
Does that mean we shouldn't depict murder in any form of media, because it normalises it? In none of his appearances, not even DBD, are Freddy's actions shown to be anything less than deplorable. Explain to me how ANYTHING about Freddy in DBD is shown for laughs. As for scares, abuse is fucking terrifying.
---
It's an oxymoron to say that the depiction of a character is scary, yet normalises tropes. And to claim that a fictional villain being shown to be an utter monster is somehow worse than giving money to an actual predator is frankly ridiculous.
---
Can't wait to play with him! I wonder what his power is.
---
I'm going to go way out to left field, but I kinda want to go with Silent Hill: Downpour with Murphy Pendleton as the survivor and the Bogeyman as the killer. For one, the aesthetic of that game is a better fit for Dead by Daylight (especially the design of the Bogeyman with his cinder block sledge). Plus, I could easily see the Bogeyman as a 115% killer with an AOE sledge attack.
---
I really only ever play survivor but i mean the killer always has a chance to take everyone out even till the last second. I only ever play random matches but is there a way to see someones rank besides for after the game in the scores?
---
No, they shouldn't.
---
Nothing about Freddy Krueger's character is seen as normal, or to be respected. Paying Victor Salva money would be sending the message that pedophilia is fine.
---
Please get your head out of your ass.
---
I mean someone gets hit and you see them run past you, why would you not make sure they arent being chased?
---
Tbh
---
Is that even possible? Outside of ghost faces "unhooker becomes the new obsession" perk.
---
Leatherface needs some TLC, and for the love of god fix the hatchet boxes for the Huntress
---
That‚Äôs possibly the worst thing to happen when using a splinter,directly above getting bullied
---
I've never really liked playing surv. Imo, I hate playing surv actually.
---
I don't even know how you play, you just come off as a toxic person.
---
So letting players play as a pedo character, totally fine for you? You've got some strange ideas.
---
I don't understand why Eileen Galvin would be the choice. Pyramid Head was much related to two, so it would be James. However, Alessa / Heather from 1 and 3 would make a much more intense killer.
---
You can use Freddy‚Äôs dream snares to shut down loops quickly though
---
Lol, yea I really want to be better as a killer because it's a lot of fun. But I figured I'll work on becoming a better survivor and then switch over. Game is so good, it's all I've been thinking about at work today.
---
I get you in mood, Show some leg. You like?
---
that's just a way for butthurt people to lash out against the killer. in reality, they just keep getting caught. Sucks for the survivor, but it is what it is.
---
What are the best ways to survive against Freddy and Legion? I know Freddy you can loop him easily but I'ma just have to practice more at that lol.   
---
Any recs for playing as the Hag? I've played a few of the killers now and I think the Hag is the best option for me (esp since I'm on PS4). Thank you!
---
With survivors getting nerfed every patch, and taking a big hit in the Ghostface patch with vaults, most of them aren't valid.
---
Too many complaints about dead hard/adrenaline/DS when they aren't even op.
---
&gt; The one thing i'll say F13 has on DBD ( I play on xbox) is the graphics
---
Really? I dunno about that
---
immersed songbird.. I mean kate, listening to country songs.
---
I feel like even though he has a lot of counter play, good placed traps are unlikely to be found and sometimes people actually step on them when looking for it, he's also very powerful in the endgame if you have 3 or 4 hens near each other because its easy to make a "minefield" and keep sucking them in placing on hooks at  the middle or corners that have most loops trapped, and most of the matches I can lose 1 gen withou any worries due to this, because I know that the pressure the traps create can make them fuck up really hard. I also never place traps when they are looking at me, in places that they can see them easily or in front of a pallet. Its always around the loop and it works super well, its also very easy to snowball in your little minefield of traps
---
That almost looks like Miranda Cosgrove to me almost....
---
Trapper needs some help. Make him start with more traps on hand instead of having him run around the map for minutes.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it would ever happen, but I guess this game would be more likely to get it than an FPS or something. PC already has some bad survivors and killers that look like they‚Äôre turning with trackpads and not a mouse, so, it couldn‚Äôt hurt too much more.
---
I think trapper should come with all 10 traps in stock and change the add ons to carry more. His traps are already pretty weak because people know where to look and can sabo, etc. It takes way too much time to place the traps where you need them and having to walk all around the map to get them even adds more time to that. If they came all in inventory I would also say maybe lower the total amount to like 7 or 8 and have the add ons to carry more just change the total number available up to 10 or 11. I.e. yellow adds 1, green 2, purple 3.
---
yeah no... Megs are almost nea level toxic, only slightly above, but still below most p3 clauds
---
The Freddy rework is coming out tomorrow, so any advice would be null and void within a day sadly.
---
Against Legion, you can loop then like any other basic Killer, their power can't hurt you if you're already injured, so if you feel confident enough, you can just stay injured and loop them as normal.
---
Hopefully you get great experiences
---
Because i don't see the fun on a character who is practically designed to get looped, usually most killers have something to counter this, for example, nurse has her last breath, pig has ambush, legion has frenzy, and while they might not be the best like pig's ambush atleast is something to put pressure, and most who don't have a speed boost at the very least walk faster, like trapper or the doctor, and im sure you are going to use your dumbass "i have no argument so i will just say git gud" so first i will say that he can sometimes counter this but at that point i would much rather play any other character who deals with this better.
---
The reason im annoyed is because bubby is just so obsolete, anything he does billy does way better, and that because billy was based on bubby which is why he is one of the best on map pressure but since they can't give bubby the same ability as billy he just has an underwhelming ability that isn't that can have its moments but is just plain boring.
---
I can play character who are not all that good like wraith and have fun, problem is that bubba is to slow and boring and just a plain bad adaptation, in all of the movies almost everyone dies because of how fast and strong he is, so i don't know where the devs got the idea of making him so slow especially when using his chainsaw.
---
And yes, he has some of the best perks but he himself is just not as good as billy.
---
No way BHVR would be willing to enter a legal battle they don't have to.
---
True. I feel like thats hes biggest issue
---
You get each one by killing one of the original 4 survivors (Meg, Jake, Claudette, and Dwight) 50 times, I believe
---
Pretty sure calling someone a clown isn‚Äôt a Nazi thing.
---
3 genning is pretty much just survivors fault and you can't reliable use it. Any killer can't use a 3 gen strat and there are better killers than Trapper at this anyway.
---
I feel so sorry for the teammates that have to put up with you
---
It‚Äôs normal, unfortunately
---
Hook Dwight, Claudette, Jake, and Meg 100 times
---
SWF = Survivor with friends
---
I think you need to kill the 4 original survivors 50 times and you can unlock their faces
---
*Sweet Georgia Brown intensifies*
---
What is the interaction if you have Adrenaline and are exhausted when the last gen is powered? Do you get the buff when you're no longer exhausted, or do you just never get the buff?
---
Tl;Dr I'm thinking of fucking around with BL and Adrenaline
---
All non licensed killers and survivors are in the game, if I remember correctly.
---
You can also play as Amanda and Tapp as I guess it‚Äôs not a true licensed chapter anymore since it got cosmetics.
---
Still don‚Äôt EVER download the mobile version. The knock offs on mobile are better made
---
As a survivor I met a survivors team with killer while I was busy doing gen they blocked my way, let the killer hook me farm me for the rest of the game. I couldn‚Äôt do anything they were friends they killer slug me and they heal me for the rest of the game. At the end of the game they send me messages don‚Äôt cry baby.  WTF is that.
---
As killer I was baby killer met 2 Nea 2 Meg Team with flash lights and Neon hair/clothes Fuck them they looped me for the whole game stun me with every ballet and blinded me, at that day I was about to drop the game completely, the worst thing they were rank 20~18 with maxed out perks.
---
As a wise man once said... **‚ÄùWhat in the fuck is that?‚Äù**
---
Survive with friends maybe, or really poor matchmaking.
---
Wait that wasn‚Äôt a joke? I swear I thought that was a joke.. and 50? Wow..
---
Yea, I know. Most people don't tho
---
Today I played against a 5 blink camping with ebony mori nurse. And that's all I have to say about that.
---
When someone dcs i just hook survivors til their second life and when i down someone for the third time i carry them to the generator and signal them to start working on the gens.
---
We all get bpoints and we all get no depips.
---
Yep EAC hates it
---
There is a sub Reddit for people like you...
---
&gt;  and taking a big hit in the Ghostface patch with vaults
---
I literally just made a post about vaults [if you wanna look at it.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cgersj/should_the_vault_speeds_change_be_reversed/)
---
also the only vault change in the ghostface patch is pretty meaningless since 98 percent of players couldn't utilize it anyway
---
&gt; Too many complaints about dead hard/adrenaline/DS when they aren't even op.
---
oh yeah bc survivors never complain about killer perks that aren't OP like bbq and ruin
---
anyway, i like how you didn't even dispute that you don't play killer
---
It might be less I can‚Äôt remember, but yeah that‚Äôs the method for it at least.
---
Literally bloodlusting, don't deserve any kills :ForsenCD:
---
That‚Äôs very disturbing. 
---
I wish I was keeping count now so I could Mori the last one to make it really seem like I took their face üòÖ
---
If you're Exhausted and Adrenaline procs, you get both the heal and the speed burst immediately, and your Exhaustion timer will just reset to whatever your rank of Adrenaline says.
---
I don't think it's by much but just a hair. Doesn't bother me though. F13 has a lot more visual bugs though.
---
Well low tier killers may be weak but 3 generators shouldn't be gone fast so it's more so you need practice with pressure and some perks to slow the game down a little bit.
---
Ace Visconti.png
---
Hmm getting different answers. I guess I'll find out soon
---
Adrenaline will give you Burst again. I believe the perk says it‚Äôll trigger even if you‚Äôre exhausted.
---
I was only going to stare menacingly and they teabagged me.
---
Uh excuse me  
---
2018 Michael Mask
---
I love all the dirt and grime they added to make the mask look withered. I think it looks way more menacing with all that detail than the porcelain white mask he normally has.
---
The thing is that ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù is a complete waste of time. Nobody gets points and the game is over in a few minutes, usually with the SWF genrushing group going ‚Äúlol ez baby killer‚Äù. It‚Äôs an awful experience to have that happen in a match.
---
[New killer confirmed.](https://i.imgur.com/QWMH0sz.png)
---
Not sure if intended but it happened to me while playing survivor. We only had 2 gens left and 3 people left alive. Our meg found the hatch and jumped. Immediately after EGC started and my teammate got downed. I was only able to leave because the killer was hanging out at the hook with my teammate giving me time to open the door and leave.
---
It doesn't matter what you do survivors do it. If you need plenty of blood point get yourself good old BBQ and chilli. But seriously there is nothing you can do they will DC like that all the time I don't think they realize how much they f*ck their team up when they do it.
---
Lol definitely not a joke, but even though the perk doesn‚Äôt really come in till endgame you have no idea how may times it has saved my ass
---
May not be able to save yoursf but borrowed time will ensure your teammate gets out as Leatherfaces chainsaw gets effected by BT.
---
Hold up... you can get different tiers of perks?  Is it only for teachable perks?  Or for example can you get ‚Äúcommon slippery meat‚Äù, ‚Äúrare slippery meat‚Äù, and ‚Äúultra rare slippery meat‚Äù?  I never noticed there were different tiers, I just thought that adrenaline was more rare than quick and quiet.
---
Not sure if you've noticed, but you also play serial killers in the game. And since you can't abuse children as Freddy in DBD, pretty sure that there's no problem with it, since you're playing him as a KILLER. 
---
You think that playing a fictional predator is worse than paying a real life predator money. You're the one with strange ideas, bud.
---
At the very least, make it so we can play KYF on cross platform. I wanna play with my PC buds so badly, and can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm working towards getting myself a PC and all but the thing is, once I do, I‚Äôll have to restart everything from scratch and lose my cosmetics which is gonna suck ass. Hopefully they can figure out a way to either let you carry over your cosmetics/progress to other platforms or allow you to play cross platform. I doubt it either way though.
---
This isnt related to OP‚Äôs question but I‚Äôve been binging your videos on YouTube and I wanted to say thank you for that information on Hag and Legion. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
No thank you (although I appreciate the offer!)
---
Its 25 each per original survivor and they must die on the hook for it to count.
---
Thanks! Didn't realize the rework was tomorrow. Is there any idea of what's going to change or they kept that quiet?
---
I wish Doc got some love. He's my favorite but his shocks don't always work the way they should and he doesn't have much else besides them. Not to mention how add-on dependent he is.
---
It's all there in the Survivor's Rulebook For Killers.
---
Rule #54: After hooking a survivor, a killer must immediately leave the area and stand in a corner, even if they see another survivor and/or scratch marks at the hook. No exceptions.
---
Rule #55: The killer may never chase after and/or attack a survivor that has been previously hooked until they have hooked a different survivor.
---
You probably forgot the stand in a corner part, or initiated chase with them shortly after unhook.
---
&gt; And once you pass rank 15 you can never drop below 15 again, to keep experienced players out of new player matches.
---
Very easy to overlook this part, especially as there appears to be a small but dedicated group of players that rotate their smurfs so that they're always being matched against low-level players (for whatever reason - could be for easy Adept achievements/trophies, could be for trolling, who knows).
---
Probably also worth pointing out that the rank system is due for a big shakeup this year, going by the anniversary livestream.
---
There's a neat chart [here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests) (official forums) that shows survival rate by rank. PS4 is weird in that L10 survivors suddenly undergo lobotomies (your guess is as good as mine) and become *worse* than L20 survivors, but *generally speaking* you're not going to see a massive difference if you stay at L15-ish versus trying to perpetually smurf - people don't stay at L20 for long, and as soon as they hit L18 they're essentiall in the same skillset as people from L15 to L11-ish.
---
Every perk has three levels, yes.
---
Like to twist words, huh? You said that you are aware of how the legal system works, yet you talk about rape which is a sexual assault, while Salva was accused of lewd and lascivious behavior which is a sexual misconduct. I see that you are tying to demonise and dehumanize me, so I don't really see the reason to continue this conversation. Have a nice day.
---
The thing with 3 gen and trapper is that he is one of the few killers that can force it effectively and if the gens are almost completed you can still do something about it and get the 3-4k or else force the gen to regress a lot
---
Chaos control!
---
What would you change/fix on LF? I don't like him or play him so I have No real understanding of what's wrong with him. And I agree with the hatches. I hate when I want to throw over a box but the box is just high enough to block it.
---
1. driver 
---
2. The building in the background kinda reminds me of badham preschool 
---
-&gt; you are a fucked
---
I dont see anyone there! They must be invisible
---
I don't really get salty about them not letting us "win."
---
It's that the killer will still camp or tunnel. It's 5 gens and 3 survivors and you're tunneling? Fucking stupid.
---
If I play killer and that happens, I don't really try and yet we all end up with 25k+ BPs still... 
---
Can't a brother just get some motherfucking BP?
---
Thanks!
---
fuck yes.
---
I dont See what you mean .. is There Something or someone hiding in that Picture?

Oof

I am looking forward to all exploit fixes and the new improved maps. That's kinda it.
---
Bring un breakable
---
i feel like the first few games i played as nurse on ps4, people caught on REAL fast that i was awful.  so they'd sit at the gate and let me hit them.  when they realized that i was just practicing my blinks and whatnot, they actually let me back up and do it again cause i wasnt trying to get the kill i was just trying to get some practice in.   
---
i def had some that tbagged and whatnot but overall ive had some fun using her.

I am fairly new to this game but I tend to focus on repairing generators.
---
My main has perks that help with repairing the generators faster.
---
What perks or characters assist you in the unhooking and saving of teamates?
---
Is that John Cena?
---
Those aren't even op killer perks and I only play killer when I have dailies to do, I haven't got the patience to wait in killer queues.
---
My bad. Not mori them, just sacrifice works.
---
I still don't understand why Splinters don't give you access to the Killer's 3 perks. I vaguely understand why Splinters aren't just KYF exclusive but if you start with the 3 unique Teachables anyways why can't we use them when using a Splinter?
---
But you still have to waste time putting them down. Or do you think that simply having more would help cut his time down? Also, I saw someone say that he should be able to reset trap already on the ground when he has a trap in his hand.
---
Lol same. I was hoping for it when I saw the tutorial come through but then just nothing. Also it would be cool after years of playing we could get a new intro scene to the game. Even if it was just for an event it would be really nice to see that quality of animation be something different
---
Absolutely, I've always felt that it was a kneejerk reaction to a mechanic that took practice and was difficult to pull off consistently. Vaults didn't need to be globally changed because they didn't want you vaulting cheesy windows that could be adjusted instead. The new vaults make weaker tiles like L/T walls and 4 Lanes even worse than they already are. 
---
Even after the vault changes you can still fast vault the Ironworks window from the outside reliably. Instead of changing vaults could they have just closed these dumb windows off?
---
The price is set at $20
---
YES! Samination runs through my veiiiinsssss
---
KB+M killers are way better equipped to handle survivors than Controller. I've played both styles on PC, and when i use controller it can be tough to hit survivors who 360.
---
conversely, KB+M almost makes it trivial to hit players who 360.
---
Eh, that‚Äôs not really toxic, annoying maybe, and they should break the pallet at that point.
---
Yes :(((

Exactly, but that's normal for everyone. I remember i got bullied for at least a month trying to play the nurse. Now I'm rank 1 p3 nurse, almost every match i get 4k. Just play her she's really hard to master.
---
Not really twisting words, when you've been sitting there telling me that Salva shouldn't be condemned, purely because he served 15 months in prison. That makes you a rape apologist, bud.
---
You can call what he did whatever you like, he performed oral sex with a child, and recorded the abuse. I have stated this in the simplest terms possible, yet you believe that 3 years, only 15 of which were served, is fair punishment.
---
Don't really need to twist your words when you make yourself look horrible, do I?
---
You keep bringing up killing like it matters here. I think playing as a fictional character who is pedo is bad enough that it shouldn't be in game, paying a pedo writer being worse doesn't make a pedo character better.
---
I made a separate post about this, but does anyone have any good reasons why the vault speed changes should stay and not be reversed?
---
Personally I have no idea either
---
I said before rework, didn't I?
---
Dude you sound like an ass read your own comments and take some NyQuil or something
---
As a huge fan of the horror series, I'd LOVE for this to be put in the game. Pyramid Head on a Silent Hill map would be so sp00ky..
---
Maybe for balance issues?
---
I love nurse, but have to admit her add-ons need a complete overhaul.
---
Very few of them are good, and nearly all of them have negative drawbacks. It's a balancing nightmare from the old days of dbd.
---
That said, I'd be happy and sad to see her add-ons get updated. Im just so used to the Omega blinks at this point.
---
She‚Äôs not P3 yet
---
&gt; complete waste of time
---
How? it is literally the only objective. it is the main focus of the match. This is like telling a boxer not to knock out his opponent.
---
My bad
---
I mean, you need all 4 to gen rush effectively, right? So you body block, get a wiggle off, and then rush gens like crazy. That's the meta, right?
---
I liked him the most out of the base killers, but everything I've read basically says he's not viable at higher ranks and pretty much screwed in an SWF scenario, so I'm trying to find another main.
---
Wait does the game actually call them fleshlights like they didnt know what a fleshlight already was?
---
Please no, we on console don't want to deal with good nurse players.
---
umbra is the best Huntress player in the game
---
SWF or broken matchmaking. Are you on Xbox?
---
Ok how am I getting so many upvotes
---
I third this,  James forsure!
---
You nailed it! Every killer other than those two have to run in a circle all day. So boring. Survivors control the chase if you get anyone but them.
---
What about Plague?
---
Oh my god that was too close
---
It‚Äôs wild how different each Myers mask looks. I realized the different variations in other horror movies but Myers is so simple looking I never realized it until I worked at a party store around Halloween time there was this guy who came in looking for the last Halloween movie‚Äôs mask but they were actually pretty hard to find around my area for some reason. But now that I‚Äôve noticed he has the best variation of masks out of every killer hands down.
---
He's implying that the rest of the team are dumb fucks who don't get anything done
---
I heard Wraith is super dependent on add-ons at higher levels.  Mainly the ones that increase his cloaked move speed and cloaking/uncloaking speed.
---
Ruin
---
BBQ
---
Nurse's calling/stbfl
---
Sloppy butcher
---
We could just go to a locker ,take a hatchet and kill everybody
---
Wow theres a line of people and no one working?
---
Yeah but Bill didnt know that at the time.
---
And DC at the first sign of hardship (or just seeing the killer)
---
Oooo petition for young ash next lol
---
&gt; Those aren't even op killer perks 
---
and yet people complain about them
---
Pig.
---
The fuck does "sweat" mean, or "tryhard" a killer is supposed to kill you, not make your life easy.
---
&gt; Killers protecting the hook zone (of course not face camping or staying really really close)
---
Depends. If exit gates are open camping is perfectly fine. Otherwise i feel like its a dumb thing to do. But playing dumb isn't toxic.
---
&gt; Killers chassing you and only you
---
Just use DS as the survivor. And a good teammate can usually help.
---
&gt; Flashlight spamming
---
Not sure what's wrong with this, personally don't mind it.
---
Agree, we should get the old decisive back as well
---
&gt; What would you change/fix on LF?
---
Personally I think he also has serious hitbox issues with his chainsaw swing, but I've heard a lot of complaints about him now that Freddy is better.
---
The more you know
---
Ok Muscle Man
---
How is letting a survivor open a gate toxic? He could have just downed Bill, opened the gate and hooked him for the bloodwarden. Letting him live gave bill a chance to escape and the points for opening the gate.
---
This whole scenario wouldn't have happened if Bill hadn't stayed behind to teabag. Meg would have been the only one to get hooked.
---
&gt; Just use DS as the survivor.
---
SUPPORT TIME TRAVEL
---
We need prints to buy!  Great job to your dad.
---
This subreddit is more toxic than the game itself, it's literally politics subreddit level salt/toxicity from a bunch of people who only play killer. They literally make up shit to circlejerk and get mad about. If they see a clip of a killer being an ass it's "well the survivor probably deserved it..", and finally after they realize that the killer, indeed, was just being a dick the argument turns into "well he can play how he wants to fuck off".
---
I enjoy the game and a lot and joined this subreddit as I wanted to keep up with it, but honestly I liked the game a lot more before I found this toxic hive here, I'll probably be leaving this subreddit and finding a healthier community for this game. I honestly hope these people are all just edgy teenagers because if they are actually adults and act like this then it's truly just sad.
---
INB4: gOoDbYe WoNt mIsS yA
---
The different Myers masks is such a good idea though like I don‚Äôt even play Myers much anymore but I would to wear different masks. Lol
---
Perfect representation of that
---
You should take a crack at drawing it
---
How so? Are you talking about her add-ons? Then I agree, but if not then I don't know what's would be bad about her.
---
Sacrifice Dwight, Claudette, Jake and Meg 25 times each. Sacrifice, of course, means they have to die on hook.  
---
You can read about it [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bubba_Sawyer) under "Cusomisation."
---
BT activates within terror radius. It won't activate at all if the killer has no terror radius. Which is exactly what insidious does.
---
i don't even use Bubba (when i hear him, i want to punch him), but i 100% endorse these kinds of QoL changes. I only bought him for that yummy BBQ &amp; Chili
---
It just lets you play as shape/pig/Freddy with no perks or addons
---
I only camp going for adept or other achievements because I'm garbage at getting 4k's.
---
Leatherface is really boring to play as imo. Against good survivors you're only really ever going to be using your chainsaw to break pallets quicker. Good survivors don't get caught in areas where they can be insta downed often at all. Hillbilly has the same problem but at least his chainsaw is really useful for speeding around the map. That speed means you are more likely to find a survivor in an unsafe area to utilise your saw. Plus you don't suffer as much if you collide with an object while chainsawing as Billy, so using your saw doesn't feel like a risk as it is with LF.
---
LF's only real positive is he can down multiple survivors so is great at camping hooks (call it patrolling all you like, it's still camping) which isn't fun gameplay for killer or survivor. LF could really benefit from a secondary power (like pig can crouch/ambush as well as her traps), just to make him more interactive. I don't have any ideas for what that secondary power could be but that's not my job.
---
look at that fucking flamingo shirt
---
Some people are just jaelous or mad that it wasnt them that were allowed to leave. Had a game where i was the last survivor, with a dicsonnect very early. We tried our best to still turn the game around and even made it to opening the gates. I was the last one alive and the killer allowed me to open the gate and leave. The guy who died close before me was angry as fuck. Insulting the killer why "HE HAD TO DIE BUT THE FUCKFACE CAN LIVE?? WHY LET HIM OUT??"".
---
Some people are just like that.
---
That's like your opinion.
---
I would like him a pride colored hijab
---
Guess I‚Äôll play myers and use addon that let‚Äôs me see survivors ;) hope you get that kind of myers in all your games.
---
Still he needs to charge that chainsaw up and move towards you so in theory it could work against a camping leatherface plus it's good a good thing to know anyways.
---
Too much
---
Second one.
---
That‚Äôs not a bug, that‚Äôs an add on working as intended. And ok ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs better then playing against Nurse all the time. Those games are fun
---
Same
---
what's DS?
---
Me when I'm playing solo survivor
---
Thats what Im trying to make happen. Good on you man.
---
Im afraid I've already tried and it indeed somehow worked.
---
Always been a one time use. No mither is the use as much as you can.
---
Last time i played on Haddon i had a survivor running, boiled over, Flip flop, Tenacity and Unbreakable  and would run to a certain room in a house every time i chased them. It was the perfect distance away from the hook so i could never get them out.
---
Ok, how about a tunneling equivalent of that then...
---
The killer can not hook you again until he‚Äôs hooked someone else first.
---
Are you seriously complaining about blood warden? Instead of being a little toxic pos just leave once you get a gate open, or try stealth for the first time ever if you have to go for a save and get back to the gates.
---
What kind of moon man language is this?
---
If you have Deliverance then yes, otherwise no because you're the last person and you're kinda fucked anyway.
---
Yup
---
Speaking as someone who played against a 4 man Balanced Landing squad on Haddonfield recently you literally can not beat the infinites that perk creates on Haddonfield without Bamboozle. (Or being Nurse / Spirit, obvs)
---
The ironic part.  Killers that resort to tunneling cause gen rushing because if you spend your time only focusing the one survivor down it leaves the other 3 with nothing else to do but punish your playstyle by plowing through the gene.  Aggressive map pressure &gt; Tunneling.
---
Fresh meme
---
Anytime the community discovers a way to play the game in an unintended way, the devs step in and nerf if. Its obniouxious that they feel the need to hand hold and handcuff players so severly. 
---
"No, this is the way the game is meant to be played." 
---
-The Devs.
---
Having fun be damned. Discovering and mastering little techniques like you mentioned is what seperates good from average players and makes the learning/improving process so rewarding. 
---
This is why people complain about nerfs so much. You can balance things without fucking gutting them from the game.
---
Should just be your 3 struggles, you could kobe off and get away, ive been hooked next to a door before, Kobe‚Äôd off and escaped.
---
Using a game mechanic to your advantage is not toxic
---
&gt; I think that an option to toggle it would be great for those who do not want to deal with that, but I would rather it be an option than deal with the queue times sometimes.
---

Lol what kind of advice is this? Don‚Äôt run any good perks so you can‚Äôt keep pressure on survivors or escape a killer!
---
Do not go gentle into that good night,  
---
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
---
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
---
I used to run Dying Light Black Box Freddy with either a mori or a shroud. Usually the Obsession sees the secret offering, realized they started asleep and are the dying light, and disconnect proccing Dying Light for me. 
---
New Freddy's black box means the survivor can never wake up, so combine it with Jump Rope for decent slowdown for the obsession the entire match, and if they DC, bam dying light.
---
I really just find her unfun to play against. She can be all the way on the other side of the map, and still come to you in under five seconds. And once she finds you, no amount of walls, pallets or windows will help. Not even complicated buildings help. It's just 'well I got found, GG'.
---
no? the karma is tbagging someone like u outskilled them and then placing yourself into a situation where the tables are turned. i don‚Äôt care about the ds in fact i‚Äôm glad he did bc it allowed me to mori him instead! :D
---
 Why do you hate it ? Just curious. It is because its so easy ?
---
Its a bad stategy though, best way to try to get that merciless rank for the achievement is to toy around with the survivors, allowing the to do saves, kicking pallets/gens or farm with them once they had a dc (specially early on).
---
Camping them when its a 3-men match is most likely giving you a black pip at most.
---
Ikr!
---
No, quite the opposite. Idk what it is, I'm just horrible at being a surv. It feels like once the killer hooks you, it's over. No chance of you getting off if the killer doesn't want you to.
---
Is this a common thing? I've just started playing the game and no matter what i do, no matter if i play defensive around my kills (not camping because i know you lose points for that) or run around the map chasing someone forever, or even if the survivors are all using 4 purple perks + items with add-ons, they always have a fucking problem in the endscreen
---
Literally what i meant.
---
Pick a killer that matches your play style. I personally love stealth, so I'm a Pig main. I'll also being buying Ghostface soon for that same reason. I like to stalk and ambush.
---
Pig also brought the game back to life for me. I mained Trapper for a while and took him all the way to Prestige 3 because I like his character design (although executed kind of poorly) and was just bored of everything. I had an ultra rare offering that allowed me to play as Pig one match and was sold.
---
For Killer perks, Nurse's Calling (Nurse) is extremely helpful for finding wounded survivors who are healing. B&amp;C (Leatherface) is great for bloodpoints and tracking where survivors are on the map.
---
For survivors, Adrenaline (Meg) is the number one clutch perk that I recommend to people. It rewards you for playing the trial injured, and as soon as the exit gates are powered you instantly heal one health state. I cant count the number of times I've been limping through a chase with killers when my team pops the last gen and I'm brought back to healthy life with a burst of energy and survive the trial. 
---
Glad to see you back at the game! If you're on xbox, maybe we can play a round!
---
And so? The post was about how powerful nurse is without addons, of course she'd become really strong with 4 corrections and an ebony. But that doesn't mean that 5 blink nurse has skill to determine her power.
---
Could it be like kind of an automatic thing? Like instead of just immediately skipping to struggle it makes do your 3 escape attempts then proceeds on as if you were the last guy?
---
Flashlight saves are definitely hard to pull off, the more power to you if you're able to. Blinding the killer isn't toxic but flashlight clicking is basically the same as teabagging. That's the difference between using an item as intended or being a toxic shit.
---
Excited for legion :)
---
Have you every played an online game before.
---
Am i really supposed to not defend a hook if i can *clearly* see that the hooked persons teammates are immediately trying to fish the unhook the second i walk away?  
---
I'm pretty much brand new to the game &lt;10 hours played - but if i put you on a hook, and i can literally see your teammate hiding (not very well) around the next corner looking for an unhook, is it really that bad to pretend to walk away and then come back and kill them both? It seems like the obvious move to me.
---
Myers certainly doesnt need a lower terror radius
---
All right, at least you didn‚Äôt go blind, silver lining and all
---
Hot take: noed is fine
---
Only range and more blinks addons.
---
I literally couldn‚Äôt play with the different sounds. As survivor, it was nearly impossible to tell when the killer was approaching and how far away they were, and as killer I didn‚Äôt get my chase music
---
Haddonfield: Has a bunch of safe gens, infinite loops, safe pallets, and general structures to game stall.
---
Behavior: Badham!
---
Not bad suggestions, though I'm not sure the Wraith one would help.  Catching up to people while cloaked is easy, it's getting the hit after the uncloak that becomes the issue, because the uncloak is slow and leaves an open opportunity for the survivor to advance at a loop.
---
As  the killer your job is to literally KILL the survivors. If you see them, and have that strategy to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. Why wouldn't you do it? Surivivors just don't like dying. Just like you wouldn't IRL. Expect some backlash. If someone killed me IRL, and could talk afterwards you bet I would shit talk them to oblivion.
---
Cmon bruh
---
Which part of his post says no add-ons?
---
unless the tunnel is something that wasn't a part of the plan but just ended up like this
---
I want to see you torture him &gt;:D
---
Pain in the ass killers at rank 15 OMEGALUL
---
I check profiles as killer if I‚Äôm playing for a long time. Just because to keep my sanity I don‚Äôt want swf back to back to back. 
---
Usually a private profile is what does it for me to dodge, because they‚Äôre usually the ones who actively try to ruin my game.
---
Camping is legit just like pallet looping
---
I could have sworn it does. I‚Äôll check when I‚Äôm back home. Maybe if dumb. My bad
---
Exactly...
---
Camping does get punished by the survivors who gen push therefore stop crying
---
You believe 4M less in tier 2 would make him stronger than the nurse? Mind elaborating on this? Keep in mind we assume competent killers. So top tier nurse and top tier Myers.
---
it was a nea but from my pov during the match there was no point to pull him from the gate and open it myself. i would have cucked him of his points (and i‚Äôm a nice killer if someone goes stage two bc their teammates didn‚Äôt unhook i‚Äôll leave them i always try to let people get enough points i feel they deserve)  so i let him open it for his own points, additionally i play survivor in red ranks, if a killer opened the gate themselves i would instantly know they had blood warden, so i personally didn‚Äôt want to open it so i stayed and let the bill open it. i also knew he didn‚Äôt have deadhard up bc he used it at the start of the clip to make me whiff and hit the lever
---
Yeah and in every game it's a piss poor excuse, trying to talk shit about someone who's better
---
Because I told you the truth in a non nice way that makes me a tryhard? Explain to me what you meant
---
Super fun when you are zeroing in on an immersed survivor and then the chase cues and you can't find them anymore cus the music is blowing out your eardrums
---
Honestly this looks scarier to me than the actual killer.  Something about that dead stare and his mouth open with the mist is really unsettling to me.
---
Honestly, I don't even play Nurse with addons and still I have people complaining constantly.
---
Btw the reason automod blocks this shit is to stop people from exploiting.
---
Billy isn't forgiving
---
I tried to find a buff that does help him, but doesn't break him. I think if the move speed buff is big enough, it would definitely help him a lot but still wouldn't be too frustrating to play against.
---
You wrong buckaroo.
---
Flashlight spamming is toxic, as its only purpose is to annoy the Killer.
---
Patroling the hook is always okay, be it to set traps, scout for other survivors if you have no BBQ etc. Camping however is just not how the game is intended
---
As a Freddy player I approve of this message!
---
&gt; Killers protecting the hook zone (of course not face camping or staying really really close) 
---
Honestly I just do that if I can't find anyone else. If no one shows up on BBQ &amp; Chili or other tracking perks, I'll wander out for signs of activity like scratch marks or generators being repaired, but if I find nothing you can bet your ass I'm going back to the hook because everything is pointing towards other survivors lurking around for the save.
---
Then I get called a camping tunneler. And yeah, I did proxy camp and sometimes I tunnel if no one's running Borrowed Time. But what do you expect me to do? Wander off in a part of the map I know no one is at?
---
**If the killer can't find anyone else and he knows someone is coming for the save, then it's not toxic for him to go back to the place where he knows a survivor will be: the hook.**
---
What I hate the most is slugging for the 4K.
---
I am a killer main. So the rare time I play survivor and spend 3 minutes sitting on the ground because the killer is so sweaty that they NEED a 4K makes me angry
---
It‚Äôs actually not, because a boxer wouldn‚Äôt want to just hit somebody once and then the fight be over instantly. The fun of Dead by Daylight is the chases, rescues, etc, not just holding left click and walking out a gate, just like the fun of boxing is the actual fight.
---
Um, r/ihadastroke ?
---
Jane is thicc, but not _that_ thicc
---
I could make a case for or against it. My best guess is that it would be strongly survivor based addition to the HUD. Not to say that a Killer couldn't benefit some from it as well but it would mostly help survivors. BHVR, despite a lot of complaints, do actually really want the game to be balanced between the sides. Some killers are known for almost always running NOED. (Old Freddy for example) When you are against them you expect it and do totems. I know on the killer side I have gotten wins because players were more concerned with totems because I might have NOED and wasted time looking for them when they should have been doing gens. Maybe a compromise would be to make it so small game has a counter to indicate how many totems are left. Like it goes dark like a hex perk when they are all gone.
---
Then you get facecamped
---
Absolute unit
---
[SNU SNU!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfOTTOsQuvc)
---
1) Killers gets far more BP than survivor on average.
---
2) Solo queue on Survivor can be a dumpster fire with potato teammates/toxic killers, so solos would rather just play killer.
---
If my GF was in the mood I wouldn't have to use Fleshlights all the time!
---
It's Fog Whisperer, basically just the game devs recognizing people as being good or impactful in the community. There are some who don't have it and should and some that do have it and shouldn't. It's debated quite often.
---
Yeah not my favourite just need BBQ and chilli. If  you use that a blood streamer and have a good game you can get like 90+ blood points per game.
---
Highly unpopular opinion: the people who honestly believe the other side must adhere to a made up rule set are just acting entitled
---
It‚Äôs **really** not.
---
you'll definitely be held... against the wall with chains and you'll be safe but i wouldn't expect to be cuddled
---
I have friends to play with, I just love playing killer.
---
Illuminati fam
---
They had a PTB where we got to test things out on PC. So unless they drastically change what they showed on PTB (which I really doubt) we basically know how he'll play.
---
This wouldnt make a game that people would want to play. It would be fun to be a spooky ultimate power killer, but you would have to play against bots. If they framed the game to account for and make it super spooky there would be no enjoyment from anyone but the killer (I dont even think killers would enjoy it after like 5 games). If you could walk up and just mori people the game would lose a lot of luster. So this cooperation is imperative to teams enjoying it thus allowing people to continue playing. I agree with you, I think a game to be a super legit movie-like killer would be fun, but it would have to be a single player because no one would enjoy the other side.
---
Took me a minute lol
---
Issa joke
---
Wow, thanks!!! Awesome advice!
---
I've learned how to play the game already(few hundred hours on PS4) and understand how to move about in a way to win. I just got so used to having all the perks that now I see how high the grind is for new players and at how much of a disadvantage they'll be against others that have meta or high level perks. I made this post mainly to complain about how steep the grind is for new players
---
What is pgtw
---
It seems like survivors always have a complaint about killers and vice versa. You didn‚Äôt get saved off the hook right away cuz others are on gens? They‚Äôre gen rushing. You get looped around as killer? Survivor is toxic. There‚Äôs literally a complaint for everything lol
---
The reasoning behind it is solid. The execution is flawed considering it only deletes threads when it detects key words, and people could easily avoid it by rewording their title. Kinda like I did.
---
I consider my post an exception to the "preventing exploits" rule, considering the circumstances surrounding the bug. But if the mods decide that this post breaks the rules, that's their decision. A decision I don't agree with, but theirs nonetheless.
---
Reminds me of rickety cricket
---
I don‚Äôt think that your opinion is widely unpopular.  It‚Äôs just a vocal minority that disagrees.
---
I mean ya never know coming from someone who has years of touch starvation under their belt but that‚Äôs valid lol
---
... how do i do that again?
---
This is personally why I never see the equivalence between the 2. Facecamping ruins the match for everyone and getting multiple killers who do this in a row, whether it's to survivors who "deserve" it or that's just how they play killer completely ruins any fun in the game whether you're the one getting camped or not.
---
I've never actually used a fleshlight but I imagine it would be toxic if you had a latex allergy. I think your dick would fall off
---
Yep works everytime
---
The real Nightmare LOL
---
I personally think the killer is more then entitled to play like normal. Why should he/she farm just becuase someone decided to dc?. I find it boring to farm and want to play a normal game. When this happens to me I will just kill everyone/play normally and let the last take hatch.
---
 Unfortunate for the survivors to be at a handicap but can't expect the killer to sit through 5 gens when this is a fairly common problem. The fact you are already being overly nice to them and they are still complaining, yeah just ignore them.
---
Id let her kick me all day long
---
There aren't any set "rules" for how the game should or shouldn't be played. Some people in the community have come up with imaginary "rules for play" but honestly just play the way you want to play and whatever is most fun for you.
---
As far as not defending the hook when you can clearly see Survivors nearby, there's a reason your Emblem only degrades if you sit within 16 meters of the hook **AND there are no other Survivors within 16 meters.**
---
So even BHVR understands that defending a hook when you can literally see someone trying to unhook isn't camping. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just salty.
---
I just want my lullaby back. Listening to Huntress hum was one of my favorite things about playing her. Now I'm lucky to catch one note every couple of minutes.
---
It‚Äôs basically the idea that talking about bugs in the game enable more ppl to exploit it.
---
For example, you want ppl to stop calling you a hacker. But Someone is going to look at this and say ‚Äúoh shit I didn‚Äôt realize that happens‚Äù and suddenly you realize you can see the outline of a survivor on the exit gate no matter where you are. 
---
The intent of the post is good yes but you can‚Äôt expect everyone to not exploit
---
This is terrifying. Old Man Quentin almost looks creepy enough to be the next Killer.
---
Hey, good to see heartwarming Russian outskirts
---
It‚Äôs totally Tuesday
---
&gt; It's when the killer will still camp or tunnel. It's 5 gens and 3 survivors and you're tunneling?
---
This one time I got one hook camped to death by a rank 4 huntress who only had 3 survivors left in the game, 4 gens still up, and Ruin still up. She tunneled the first survivor to fucking hell and back. It was pathetic. Poor dude got like 2000 bp

He is speaking the language of gods

Why is it toxic to play to win?

Wow what an original super funny joke.
---
Survivor's Rulebook for killers rule #245: Killer's can't make rules for survivors.
---
Purpose?
---
I never said the killer has to be all powerful. I'm saying survivors shouldn't be standing in front of them allowing them to hit them. That just feels shitty. I'm saying that killers should definitely be the power role at all times. As it stands survivor isn't remotely scary 99% of the time. As it stands a decent team of survivors can bully the fuck out of a killer. This is why we see so much toxicity from both sides. The roles need to be defined and stay that way.
---
Wow, t-bagging? Toxic killer.
---
You know what scares me more? The "palley value" system they want to introduce with map reworks/in the future. Increase the amount of pallets on maps but decreasing the size of each individual loop. If not done perfectly, it's going to be next to impossible to ever catch a good survivor.
---
Ok thanks. Yeah i felt it was a bit dumb tbh, what happened was i found a girl and hooked her - then walked off. She immediately got unhooked. I went round and got her again and hooked her. Since i figured they're going for the unhook again and hiding nearby, i baited it. Chainsawed them both and hooked them both. One guy came to save him and i hooked him too.  
---
Since i have 3 on hook and there are 5 gens left, i feel like the smarter thing to do is patrol my 3 hooks because them saving teammates is the only way they're going to win. Right?
---
Says a lot about this community that we have to give props for not DC‚Äôing. Lol.
---
Totems are supposed to be a semi-hidden thing, since a lot of the most powerful perks are tied to them. Giving the Survivors a counter of how many remain would take away from those perks being somewhat powerful.
---
Honestly I hated the change that just shows you Lullaby whenever you start a Gen and it has 0 stacks, that was a horrible change imo. It should only show you when the Hex is actually functional, like Devour Hope or NOED.
---
dam u rite
---
Dude no mither needs to be nerfed to the ground!!! It should be hex but all totems are no mirhers totem and as soon as you break one than no mither will be gone
---
Just press the vote button to the right of the point counter and choose "unsportsmanlike". They willingly try to get queued with lower ranked killer to boost the ease of leveling so it should qualify!
---
second
---
I‚Äôm sorry say that again please
---
This is a time when I approve of ds, have someone intentionally get tunneled and set it off, on more dying light
---
These are all toxic bro
---
wraith being able to attack while invisible
---
Huntress main here
---
I use iron maiden, sloppy, mad grit, and whispers, works really well for me when paired with reload speed and extra hatchet addons, generally get 3-4 kills or maybe 2 on a bad game
---
iron maiden is pretty good with her.
---
nonono, he totally said nea
---
Teabagging is a legitimate strategy to distract a Killer and force him to tunnel you, as long as you are confident in your Looping abilities, you can waste lots of their time and pop some Gens.
---
Change my mind.
---
find a gen or totem, identify what kinds of tiles are around you and plan a route to run if the killer comes, start doing the gen or totem
---
Fuck!
---
What is tomorrow, but yesterday's Tuesday
---
I have played hag on haddonfield many times and had no issue. People like you are what wrong with this game. "Wah, I'm not guaranteed to win so I'll dc".
---
If you are so scared of windows, then make bamboozle part of your build or play someone who shuts down loops instead of whining. I hate playing against moris, instahatchets, and omega blink nurse. I play the fucking game anyway.
---
When huntress first came out that was the case but it's  near perfectly centered now.
---
Killers have had to deal with the same unoriginal BMing for three years now, yet now that killers have a way to BM for a month it's stale? lol
---
You can try shadowborn.
---
Doesnt bother me. Looping being as strong as it is is bad for the game. Sneak around, keep chases short, break LOS. We shouldnt see survivors running a killer for 3 or 4 gens. Cant do that without looping, and there isnt a single good survivor that would stay good if they didnt loop, so fuck em. Ill keep tossing pallets.
---
First one, but you have to add no mother otherwise it sucks
---
This ain‚Äôt it Chief.
---
If I found my photo taken without permission posted online while I was at work, I‚Äôd feel so weird.
---
Omg, imagine I had 61 more shards. Now I'm angry &gt;:(
---
I admit, I‚Äôve fallen victim to this salt before, but only momentarily. For like two seconds, I‚Äôm pissed because I‚Äôm competitive as fuck and then it‚Äôs over. The killer doesn‚Äôt owe me anything, they‚Äôre playing the same game as me: play to win. Win by death. Not their fault my teammates were a literal on fire dumpster. I had a game last night where two people were hooked kinda early in the game, I went to save the first since he was already struggling (hag was patrolling super close and I ain‚Äôt dumb without a perk to help me out) and as soon as I ran up, he let himself die. He had only just started struggling a moment ago! And then the other hooked survivor just dc‚Äôd on hook. No gens got done. And my friend and I died horrifically. Thanks team lmfao
---
I think a lot of that is conditioning. It can be the most scary thing in the world that's happening to you but after hundreds of hours of it you just dont react or feel the same. Theres no way to make this game feel as if it is still scary 100-200 or 1000 hours in. That's with everything though.
---
The toxicity is from people taking on "mains" and not understanding both sides. People will complain and scream but not have any idea with what it feels like on the other side.
---
 The game needs to be a game so giving too much power will just kill the game. I also disagree with getting bullying. A lot of the tactics that allowed bullying to occur are gone (flashlights not work, insta blinds are gone, DS rework, saboing hooks). Most of bullying is also getting too riled up about it and that causes mistakes to occur. I used to have games where I got riled up and did terrible but the games that people tried the same stuff and I stayed calm ending up in destroying the teams. This going from me playing rank 20 to rank 1. I have lots of hours (over 400 as killer and over 400 as survivor) in the game on both sides so I am just giving my 2 cents because I see people get tunnel vision and it ends up hurting them.
---
Honest question, how do you propose them fixing "defining" the roles?
---
I see people calling killers toxic for using certain perks and add-ons way more than people calling flashlights toxic but
---
The only time I ever mind flashlights is when there's multiple as they're usually a group that will coordinate blinds, but it's more annoying than anything
---
Night and day for this game. Whenever I switch between the two I curse how shit the console port is.
---
The killers are too scared to get near that. Best survivor.
---
Her power is fine in my opinion. I'd say a faster crouch for sure and the revert on the trap not activating on EGC. Otherwise the add-ons are deffintly a must. She has like 3 good ones. The faster crouch, wall hacks, and the blindness. The rest are to weak or useless.
---
*Sees Hairy af legs*
---
Is it like that all over?
---
https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/killers/huntress/
---
This gives a few ideas you could try
---
One build you could try is: Iron Maiden, Ruins, A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher
---
Uncanny
---
You don't think what was intended?
---
Tip: if you crouch you don't make as much noise when injured.
---
Thank you. I came up with it all on my own too! You‚Äôre so nice, I appreciate your comment. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I get my BBQ stack so I can't complain. DC husks will also be a thing so no more disconnecting to deny Moris which is another issue. 
---
On a side note there have been more than a few times where I decided "Fuck it I honestly don't want to play this match." go to suicide on hook, Kobe'd, and decided to play the rest of the game out. Maybe this will happen to other people.
---
Not to mention they can't use their med kits you knock that shif out of their hands. A killer having to try for kills equals not having fun apparently.
---
I have a few friends that main huntress and they all have different kinds of builds. I've seen some run any of Discordance, Monitor+Abuse, Bitter Murmur, Brutal Strength over Nurse's and Whispers. 
---
With the directional hum changes it's harder to take advantage of the lullaby to hide, which was why most Huntress's ran Whispers. People are starting to take off Nurse's because it only helps you against bad survivors that will heal in range. Good or decent survivors won't be healing near you and you won't be able to take advantage of your perk.
---
They removed splinters from the game. but if u have one u can still use it.
---
Watch streamers to get better it def has helped me in looping.i still suck but im getting better. also play as killer. im a killer main now trying out survivor and seeing how those survivors play in the high ranks as killer def helps me out. dont worry bud ur gonna be bad in the beginning it'll take some time before u get real good. trust the process!
---
Scaredy Cat‚Äôs a new one
---
It‚Äôd work a lot better if it flashed the Aura of what it was detecting for even just a second.
---
There‚Äôs nothing more frustrating than trying to find that Dull Totem for 5 minutes, only to find out it was a Trappers Trap hidden in the corner in some grass.
---
He should do Huntress in her new outfit! The atmosphere looks killer
---
I remember nearer 20 something. I don't think it's as high as 50
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a long time and I‚Äôm just now realizing that the higher  rarity perks will show up... rarer. Lmao
---
When I play killer, there is only one ‚Äòrule‚Äô I agree to follow
---
Protect the baby dweets when possible
---
I disagree, I think her power should be more spectacular with the traps and less emphasis on the crouching. Like she doesn't deserve to just be another stealthy terror radius remove and then small boost killer.
---
Beginner's luck, I suppose =D  
---

I‚Äôd really like to see leatherface changed. With all the meat hooks it seems like the game was very inspired by the chainsaw massacre and it would be great if leatherface could become much better then he is now. Only thing I like about him now is his basement meme build xD
---
It‚Äôs measured in normal meters. Sadly there arent very many places you can actually measure distance. What people tend to use, or at least I do, is use the brick walls of the outer edges of the map. Each second is 8m apart afaik and my judgement of distance has been correct as far as I can tell for anything.
---
If you're the last person and you struggle off all that's going to happen is you get thrown back on the hook. And if you DS, then what? Play ring around the rosie for a bit on a lost game?
---
No, being able to struggle off as the last person left would do nothing but waste time
---
Yeah but it is mostly just awful
---
Leatherface needs some tweaks not a full rework, so you right there. 
---
Piggy needs her addons reworked, most don't have an impact on survivors and a couple put piggy at a disadvantage.
---
I survey the area, cleanse a totem if I don‚Äôt spawn near one, locate a generator in the middle area of the map, so that way if the killer gets into a chase with me early, I have as much pallet density to potentially use and it keeps me from running into someone else working on a gen.
---
The Huntress has the mind of a small child.
---
Some killers don't need a "rework", but rather a buff. Trapper is well designed he's just weak. I think his traps should reset themselves after 30 seconds if disarmed.
---
Hi, 
---
At what time is the rework coming out? I don't know about the time zones, but I live in Europe ( Finland)
---
Shadowborn, Iron Maiden, Monitor and Abuse, Bitter Murmur, Discordance and Pop Goes the Weasel are also decent perks on Huntress.
---
how are we finding out about the new chapter this time? cosmetic accidentally shown in a banner, perk leaked in the KYF menu, model accidentally left in-game, accidentally release the entire chapter in the mid-chapter patch?
---
Those big balls of hers were weighing them down
---
obvious dummy thicc sneaking joke.
---
Happened to me last night as well. It was grueling to get any gens done and we eventually got massacred
---
if doctor had something where if you see his illusion self you‚Äôre temporarily paralyzed with fear that would definitely make him more viable. i love playing doctor and with the amount of hate i get post game about it i think doctor would be cool high rank
---
Yessir or ma‚Äôam
---
How is that a nerf? its obviously a buff?
---
dude there are like 5 perks that are bugged in some way and 4 add ons that do close to nothing, last game i couldn't even pick up survivors 
---
let them make a game that works first
---
The bad news is you‚Äôve made yourself look like a tit on a public forum. The good news is you‚Äôve won a gold medal for the mental gymnastics you‚Äôve just performed.
---
is she though?
---
The perk is fine for a solo survivor imo, but yea prolly broken for a SWF with good communication.
---
So reworking Haddonfield would make killing brain dead easy for you ? Usually, playing killer is pretty hard unless you use some busted add-ons, especially in red ranks.
---
I know right, she needs gingerness.
---
This is definitely a change that wont happen, but it does seem interesting.
---
Dumbass... there is no grass in the chick fil le
---
That hot, huh?
---
What about No Mither+Self Care?
---
i just rarely see it on a solo survivor, unless theyre trying for an adept
---
You could play devils advocate and say that blinding killer at the pallet can help that survivor (this probably applies to more lower rank killers). It can keep the chase going longer if the killer walks into a wall or some obstruction. A longer chase means teamates can do gens, heal, find ruin, etc. Sure you yourself might not always safe a teammate (I cant get a flashlight save to save me) but it still makes a window of opportunity to make something positive for the team
---
SG on The Game map = hurts itself in confusion
---
Yeah i do. I mainly play as killer but wanted to have some relaxing games as survivor as an option too.
---
I am not relaxed.
---
I can‚Äôt see anyone there.
---
Four unique traps, one for each survivor, that you can choose between when you place them on downed survivors. Each does a different minigame to escape from, with varying amounts of difficulty. Say, one trap that's very difficult to escape from, maybe the Venus Fly Trap, two regular RBTs and a weaker variant, maybe the Shotgun Collar. Just add some variety of traps, because the RBT isn't the only thing she uses canonically, in fact the only time she's seen with one is on her own head. It would really make it feel like Saw. Also, it could lead to more gory deaths. They should also just kinda make the RBT death pop better, as well as add some Hello Zepp in the background while a trap is active, that scales in intensity with the timer until the finish.
---

---
wait don‚Äôt tell me
---
There‚Äôs a very good chance he got over the amount to get 1 million so capped at 1m but he thought he got the perfect amount. Moment of silence for our brother ace :(
---
Stop stop! Killer rule for survivors #345 is that you can't complain about killers. They have it hard and are oppressed and you are a toxic, mean, swf survivor for ever escaping!
---
Never use shadowborn... you‚Äôll be addicted to it like me
---
That is very true. To be honest I don‚Äôt carry flashlights much because I suck at flashlight saves. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôd rather bring a toolbox. But clicking the flashlight in an antagonizing way (like I see some YouTubers do) is toxic for sure.
---
Why would survivors DC on The Game or Lery's ? These are really good maps unless you play against Nurse ( on The Game, not on Lery's XD ), Spirit or Hag.
---
decloak after attack
---
Hey if you are on Ps4 I wouldn't mind teaming up with you. My cousin and I will be playing shortly and shes usually right around your rank too.
---
Otherwise I would advise you to do more than being a Gen Jockey or an Altruistic type. Try to do everything. Heal, clense totems, do gens, loop the killer. It's hard to pip if you are solely doing one task.
---
I'm picking her up today 2 match ever
---
Do doo, do doo, do doo
---
God forbid survivors just want to win, right?
---
Resilience, Spine Chill (Not sure if it effects vaults still), Lithe, Iron Will. For vaulting and doing gens.
---
People giving any attention to legion in a positive manner need to be banned.
---
I‚Äôm sure I might become a Leatherface god with FD, BBQ, Distressing, and Iron.
---
How does dying light work with that perk, I know hitting ds causes you to become the obsession, but does it make it so someone who is dead is not?
---
*"Life's a piece of shit, when you look at it"*
---
I‚Äôd stay away from bitter murmur mainly because your waiting on survivors popping gennys which you don‚Äôt want to happen in the first place you‚Äôd definitively be better of with something else
---
franklin‚Äôs demise barbecue and chili distressing and iron grasp
---
I came to find this comment after reading the comic.
---
My survivor main is actually Jake because with him I can get more blood points by sabotaging hooks
---
Leatherface genuinely is just a discount hillbilly, they rushed him and his addons to get him out before Freddy came out, so almost all of his addons are identical to hillbilly. I‚Äôd also love to see him reworked in some way. 
---
Other killers I think could use a buff of some kind (not necessarily a rework) would be pig, clown, wraith, trapper, legion, and doctor. Most of the other killers, at least I think, are in a good position or could use some slight nerfs (you can probably imagine which two I mean for the nerfs)
---
By your logic you are dcing against good survivors...without knowing if they are good enough because you don't stay in the match long enough to find out. 
---
If someone dcs against a nurse, they are making the same assumption as you are that they are godly. Somehow, that's wrong but it's okay for you? Understood.
---
Camping means that the killer is going to derank and lose. They know this. They do it anyway, because YOU as a survivor who acted like a dick the whole game, will know exactly why you don't get to play anymore.
---
If a child acts out, they get put in time-out. They aren't having fun in time-out. It's meant to be a punishment. So if you go into a game to be a jerk and end up getting put in time-out, you know why it happened. Don't get mad that you got caught. 
---
Too often, you get players who get pissed at camping despite having been an asshole all game. If you don't want me to get mad at you, don't *make* me mad. This is a simple concept that survivor jackasses can't get through their heads. If you annoy me, I will get annoyed. If I'm annoyed, I will retaliate. Unfortunately that means neither of us get to play anymore.
---
So no, camping is not worse than teabagging. Teabagging doesn't automatically depip you. Camping does automatically depip me, even if it does screw you over. One is toxic and has no downsides to doing it. The other is toxic but does hurt the person doing it.
---
I play both killer and survivor. I don't think killers should have so many 1 hit options and I don't think survivors should have so many second chance options. Oh it's okay if I take this hit that guy had borrowed time or I have DS or my flashlight teammate is right there or my insta heal teammate is right there. It's just ridiculous. Killers get rewarded for being bad and survivors get to bully killers because of the second chances.
---
Let‚Äôs slaughter the people that say no to Ed. It‚Äôs not nice and they need some medicine of their own. No Claudette, No Meg, no to them all.
---
So your telling me a killer who tunnels a single survivor that can out loop the killer the whole game while the other survivors do gens should get a free pass? I think No-ED is fine the way it is though folks who use it can‚Äôt really improve because there relying on a crutch perk it‚Äôs the same situation with survivors and certain perks
---
Except for Ed, of course.
---
Wait fuck i thought it said ‚ÄòDoesn‚Äôt break the pallet‚Äô my bad
---
agree
---
This makes it easier for new players to use pallets less efficiently, but still have more for the rest of the team. If you watched OhTofus video he shows how mindgameable each pallet is with a good survivor running. I recommend giving it a look.
---
But he said he was working on it with four other survivors. So that‚Äôs five already. And then another one showed up
---
Side note: why does Billie Elish Male music which is A) Crap B) For girls who think they‚Äôre insane and unstable? She‚Äôs just bollocks
---
Thats not how adept achievements work
---
Oh now I get you sorry for talking so rudely but with your choice of words you made it sound like the killer is the tryhard I am sorry
---
I've done it once in a SWF to be a dick to my mate. It *did* cause our random to instantly DC though.
---
If I can tell they are in SWF, I'm gonna hard tunnel the OoO every single time.

Right?? I don't play a lot of video games but I've wanted to try out DBD for a while. Always thought it was PC only but as soon as I found out it was on console I bought it. I'm having so much fun playing. And in a weird way it's a healthy outlet for my anxiety lol.
---
I agree with 1 hit options and second chances. It's not as strategic as it used to feel
---
Can‚Äôt believe Spirit has already been out for almost a year.
---
So because you picked the wrong killer for the map, that's somehow the survivor's fault and you should dc? I guess because I don't pick iron will or spinechill against spirit, I should dc too.
---
As for bamboozle, there are certain areas where it at the very least makes the survivor fuck up if you know how to mind game while using it. When I use it on Myers and Wraith, it forces them to take either take an alternative route or vacate the house. If I can predict what they will do, it is a free hit for me.
---
^Oh ^shit. You‚Äôve pissed off bill gates

But as OP stated he did this to give Bill extra points. There is literally nothing toxic about that at all. It's not like he downed him and watched him crawl to the gate or anything like that. Bill only benefited from it.
---
I don't have deliverance or ds.
---
Badham is also very survivor sided though.
---
It may be because of Discordance and the killer wants to early pressure the 2-3 people on that one generator. I usually never start a gen with another person because of either Ruin or Discordance and without knowing someone else is in a chase, I‚Äôd rather get multiple gens pressured over one finished very quickly.
---
I don't DC, I don't think I ever have. I won't encourage DC-ing. How am I supposed to predict which map I'll get? No killer is good for every map (let's not talk about nurse and spirit, going against them is basically a different game), and there's no way to know which map you'll be going to.
---
I'm saddened that people didn't get this and downvoted you...
---
Thank you!! Is that new? I havent played in like 6 months or so. Interesting. Thanks again for the help :)
---
Okay, thanks! :)
---
Well, in case this isn‚Äôt satire, here you go:
---
1. Survivors get a temporal speed boost when they get injured. It also could‚Äôve been sprint burst queued up.
---
2. Your heartbeat only is gone if you have insidious. Also, given you‚Äôre context, you were not a stealth killer.
---
3. The peonage bar is ‚Äúdeep wounds‚Äù. It‚Äôs triggered by perks like borrowed time, or legions ability.
---
Again, its likely this is satire, but you can never be too sure.
---
I spent that time simultaneously building my Twitch stream which will still be there even if DBD dies. This is more of a neat milestone that I achieved while streaming DBD. I'm pretty happy where I am in life and am not spending all of my time just playing this game. I see no reason to be negative about it :)
---
People complain about someone using other artworks as a template because tracing/copying something is basically art theft if the original artwork is not free to use or used without permission. And you indeed need less skill if you copy something instead of thinking about a composition, pose, anatomy, details, etc. 
---
And it's really something that bothers A LOT of artists though.
---
No you can‚Äôt but you can see if she‚Äôs faking a phase or not
---
Then leave them on the hook for someone who does to rescue them. Focus on finishing generators.
---
SICKENING!
---
Yeah his power is a bit bland...
---
Can't we interest you in a nice Clown instead? How about some "Ooooh - where'd he go?" Wraith action?  
---
Nurses are the worst. The less Nurse mains the better.
---
I'd say he knows a little bit more about fighting monsters than you do, pal, because he invented it.
---
Play with who ever you want and then just dump the BP into the killer who's perks you want.
---
Example: I played Bubba with BBQ&amp;C to get BP to level up my nurse
---
I disagree that they're "objectively so horrible," but I agree they would benefit a lot from some fairly small tweaks (thinking of the Pig's add-ons specifically).
---
Does anybody say this though? Like not one single example, show me three examples of people saying this. Of course you won‚Äôt, but don‚Äôt let that put you off enforcing the ‚Äòsurvivor bad!!!‚Äô circlejerk.
---
Bitter's more of a fun perk than anything on Huntress. It lets her go for some crazy crossmap hatchets with enough practice and generators are going to be popping left and right anyways with good survivors against huntress.
---
That looks Badass
---
1- As far as I know you can't see how you have progressed in your emblems.  
---
2- Self care isn't that meta now since they nerfed healing time to give killers more time overall. Same for DS, it got reworked so it doesn't work as it used to be, now it's an anti-tunneling perk. When you get hooked, if you go down in under 60 seconds, you have your DS that isn't affected by Enduring anymore, the skillcheck is also significantly easier. 
---
From the new survivors since Quentin, Deliverance from Adam is one of the only ok perks, Windows of Opportunity from Kate can help you since it highlights the pallets and windows through walls. Mettle of Man from Ash used to be broken but it got nerfed, I don't think it's used at all anymore. The meta build hasn't really changed that much, just forget Sprint Burst, it's not that good anymore because now running while you're exhausted means that your exhaustion doesn't lower, you have to walk, crouch or stand still. The best ones now are Lithe or Balanced Landing.  
---
As a killer now, Surveillance from the Pig became pretty good, it used to last for a few seconds but now once you kick a gen, you'll always see the generator's aura in white, until a survivor starts to repair it. Bamboozle is pretty good, it's a perk from the Clown that allows you to go faster through windows and it will block the window for survivors for 16 seconds. Every perk from the Spirit are also good, and the Legion's perk "Discordance" is nice too, it will tell you when two survivors are working on one generator. Nothing broken in terms of perks, but they are playable. The build still always starts with BBQ/Ruin most of the times.
---
3- The Spirit is one of the best killers and she is pretty fun to play because she allows for a lot of skillcap and different strategies. And if you like stealthy killers, the Pig and Ghostface are fun to play, and Ghostface can quickly teabag survivors !
---
4- Still the same thing as it used to be, don't tunnel, don't camp, don't proxy camp, don't play noed, etc etc.
---
I believe all killers below B-rank need a change.
---
Whether it‚Äôs reworks, buffs, or just sight changes to their powers. I really hope Doctor, Trapper, Legion, Pig, Leatherface, and Wraith all get something like that
---
If I were new, I'd probably assume that resets the gate progress too.
---
I think the logic is the Killer is less likely to chase someone else if people are next to you.
---
&gt; But as OP stated he did this to give Bill extra points.
---
Yeah, I saw that. I also see it whenever those "Huntress lets someone open the gate then 'accidentally' hatchets them to death during the EGC" are posted here.
---
Needless to say, I don't buy it. It is just fuckery.
---
My teammates never have those perks and I always play solo because I have no one to play with
---
You made the right call.
---
While it sucks to get off the hook, just to be hooked again, that's not your fault, that's the person who unhooked's fault.  They should have had a better plan.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad thing but still it's a thing to think about every once in awhile hell I've invested half my life in gaming and I love my life it's just something to think like hey I could be searching for love with the time I've invested or maybe become a wealthy person because everything we know could disappear like twitch for example they are very corrupt and can possibly be shut down and maybe it's best to search for things that'll last? Not trying to become  a wise ass but still think about every once in awhile.
---
Like as LF if you chase a survivor with your chainsaw and he drops the pallet, sometimes he will stun you, survive, and the pallet isn't broken. That's really hurtfull for LF.
---
She vomits constantly and has sTuFf all over her body, not very hot my dude.
---
Maria makes more Sense, she died 3 times to him.
---
Every Killer (outside of Myer's in different Tiers and Legion in Frenzy) has the same vault speed. Her animation is different, so she only looks like she vaults faster.
---
The large problem with them is that they quickly turn into M1 killers because their abilities are avoidable or do not help them as much as other killers‚Äô abilities
---
it's 25%, 55% would make the perk meta lmao.
---
*clears throat and raises bonesaw,* you wanna say that again?
---
This sounds like a guy who was slugged one too many times
---
I made sure to unlock the teachables first when i got to 35 and 40 so i don't think that's the case, guess i'm just unlucky then, i'll just keep levelling and hope to get them.
---
Thanks.
---
This also happens on PC, like a week ago I loaded into a 2 killers match too.
---
It‚Äôs a solid tattoo, but not my style. It‚Äôs all preference, and I wouldn‚Äôt have made that choice. 
---
Like I almost wouldn‚Äôt call it a Ghostface tattoo? I see it as a Grim Reaper wearing a scream mask, rather than Ghostface with a scythe if that makes sense?
---
That's what they're changing it to do.
---
Dead by Daylight
---
I didn‚Äôt even notice him but I still somehow broke his dark shroud
---
Even if your confident a good killer can clap your cheeks
---
I‚Äôll pm u in a second we can do some SWF later tonight if ur down.
---
This still happens on PC too, whats the relation with mobile being F2P??
---
It‚Äôs a shitpost yah dumb dumb
---
Doctor is the only one with terror radius add-ons, LOL.
---
Relatable and accurate.
---
And this is why you can‚Äôt get to red ranks
---
Self care&lt;bond 
---
Prove me wrong boyz
---
Quality shitpost and used the tag, take my upvote
---
I have never ever heard anyone complain about of all things bamboozle. Wtf? If anything, killers refuse to use this perk and instead complain about windows.
---
It has the shitpost tag it's satire
---
i‚Äôm rank 7
---
Yeah no I disagree, flashlighting at a pallet or window can buy enough time to find your next safe spot, especially if you chain blinds.
---
Yeah, you think with the consoles getting Bill and them not forgetting consoles. You think it would have it.
---
Yea im in eu though so you know
---
I main Pig and Spirit and let me tell you this shit is so broken. Like it‚Äôs so busted. You can see who, how many, and where the survivors are on a gen. You can see if they‚Äôre at a trap or behind a wall in some aspects. I hope the devs fix it soon bc it‚Äôs VERY unfair for the survivor. I‚Äôve been going a lot easier on my survivors and trying not to pay attention to the glitch.
---
Sorry, when i say that I DC ? I say that killers have a reason to DC, not that I do it myself.
---
what? Who is there and please tell me you asked for permission
---
This. I literally played survivor exclusively until
---
I had BBQ, Ruin, Nurses, and a few other perks on Spirit and Meyers. Then set them all up and started farming. Worked beautifully.
---
Yea, if I had to play differently just because a survivor d/c'd, I'd almost never to get to play a normal game. At this point I just tell them to go yell at the rage quitter, not me in post game chat.
---
Is this Visage?
---
Nice job man!
---
You should! It‚Äôs really fun :)
---
Totems can occasionally stay up for long periods of time if they are well hidden on big maps, however a map item can counter that, are you complaining if survivors bring in maps as well?
---
honestly same lithe and balance landing are the only exhaustion perks I use.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if his eyes are open or closed. Face app has gone too far.
---
I like to actually do the objectives as opposed to a lot of the let's all run and unhook people builds I see.
---
So I run
---
Technician - To stealth repair (UNTIL SOME CLAUDETTE OR DAVID BLOWS MY COVER)
---
Empathy - So I know where some Claudette or David is in an effort to avoid them leading the killer to me.
---
Urban Evasion - To sneak away from my nearly finished generator and go rescue or avoid a Claudette or David.
---
Self-Care - Because you can't always relay on a Claudette to heal you.
---
I sometimes substitute Urban Evasion for Spine Chill, Deliverance, Borrowed Time or Sprint Burst.
---
But assuming I don't follow my teammates behavior of being stupidly altruistic this build usually works out well enough to solo at least 3 generators until some genius leads the killer to me. At which point all of my teammates have usually took turns saving and hooking each other.
---
So hopefully if they can finish 2 Gen's by the time I finish looping or getting hooked we can all escape.
---
Most of the time they just finish Gen's and leave........... so ENJOY! :)
---
I'll be honest, this is not a very good solution. This would only encourage more and more people to run Blood Warden, NOED, Haunted Ground, and Thrill of the Hunt to make EGC as short and impossible to escape as possible; and more and more survivors would put Small Game as a staple while keeping most of the other current meta perks. It basically just breeds more stagnation amongst killers. Blood Warden is scary enough as it is with the 2 minute timer on EGC; making it so that you have 30 seconds less than before is really unnecessary.
---
EGC is there to encourage survivors to leave, not to guarantee kills. If you make a build around out, fine; but fundamentally changing it to a degree of making it last longer or shorter in THIS way is way too much in the Killer's favor, even IF you cleanse all the totems. 
---
I know this is about NOED because this community has, like, 3 discussions that are serious in nature. NOED and totems themselves need to be tweaked. You're on the right track that only saying "just do totems" isn't a proper solution. There is very little actual reward to doing them outside of knocking out Ruin or Lullaby. Dull totems are not nearly enough reward for the time and are only a "maybe you prevent X" thing if you hit them all. Hell, some folks even just wait until the end before hunting down NOED to save time and get full BP, and NOED's notification on the down are dumb. The possibility of NOED existing is not incentive enough to spend a shitton of time searching for 4 totems only to give up on the last one that was hidden in a one-way hidden pathway on the ass end of the map and have that kill you OR waste your time breaking all them before learning "oh they didnt even have NOED and we all died without getting generators done. But hey, I got those 2500 boldness points from cleansing them."
---
If you got more Boldness for cleansing dull totems, then maybe people would care to do them to deter NOED, because then at least you get more than pennies for your work even if you didn't get anything. And I think they are doing that, too, or so I had heard.
---
But really if you want to incentivize people go cleanse totems and to not have them bitch about NOED, then change NOED's notification (once gates are powered or open, perhaps), or effect (I'm still workshopping that one, got some ideas).
---
Decision making is a huge part of this game. If your team mates are making bad choices then that sucks, but you should focus on yourself. If you see the killer facecamping or aggressively defending then you should just start the nearest gen. Even if it's close to the killer it might mean they chase you and give your team the chance to unhook. 
---
Sometimes when the killer is just aggressively defending it does mean you can still unhook it is just risky and usually it is better to do gens and wait for a chance to unhook.
---
Awesome! thanks for the link.
---
Blink at me you asthmatic nerd, I‚Äôll say it in your ear while im being carried on your shoulder
---
Don't tell me what to do.
---
Though many people on here tell you that Iron Maiden is good on Huntress, it is NOT.
---
It‚Äôs good on Huntress if you‚Äôre bad and can‚Äôt end a chase with the 5 hatchets you already have. If you can already do that, then there is no need to have the perk since the main purpose it *would‚Äôve* had would be to reload faster mid-chase. Otherwise it saves very little time compared to other perks you can run on her.
---
Perks I like to run on her are Ruin, Barbeque, PGTW, Bitter Murmur, Nurses, Huntress Lullaby, Whispers, Shadowborn, Brutal Strength, Discordance, etc.
---
How anyone not using Nurse or Spirit feels when they win a game at rank 1
---
You are justifying it, so I can only assume you do the same since you claim it's "impossible" to play on that map. You defend dcing on haddonfield but find dcing against the nurse not justified despite the logic being the same. My comment still stands.
---
Well shit I ain't sleeping tonight
---
imagine being that stupid, that you stay in a game where the killer LET YOU open the gate.
---
The brain power of some survivors I swear...
---
I think your having a stroke in what seems to be a long series of strokes.  I'd  A) Bang your head against the wall or B) Seek medical Help.
---
OR do A) then B)
---
no problem
---
Eh I disagree. I think flashlights are garbage now. I have been blinded so many times but I didnt drop the survivor. They used to be powerful but now rarely work.
---
DS is to prevent tunneling now, but it is so conditional it doesnt work that often.
---
I know most people disagree but I think now is the most powerful killers have ever been. I started this game years ago and I had to work my ass off to get good enough to get to rank 1. That was with survivors having so many advantages now. Killers are in a way better place now but what most killers dont do is adapt. I cannot go into each game playing the same as the last. I need to change my tactics on the fly. It makes me feel bad esp with end game collapse now. I dont recall the last time in the past week and a half I had a game where survivors got all the gens but now if theres only one person its basically 0% chance for them if I find the hatch first. (I think EGC needs to be fixed but that's another topic)
---
I'm sure lots of people disagree and that's okay, but I dont think survivors are godly like most people play them out to be. Who knows I had 250 hours as killer before I started looking at this reddit. It ruins you because you end up with this "woah is me" mentality (I had it for a little bit) anytime something goes wrong. This entirely blocks you from learning from the experience because you view it as you had no option or counter play. Play to learn and get better. This is the best time for killers to learn because the only useful items for survivors right now are insta heals and keys.
---
but it can  
---
"the entity"
---
Then I don't know what the point of your reply was. I was addressing him saying hag's weak on that map because of flashlights (not my experience). Your comment would have made more sense in reply to him.
---
Yes she is broken. People will justify it by saying "she's hard to play", but she is a bit too strong, and once the maps all get reworked so other killers are more effective, she needs a nerf
---
That was awesome. That Legion must‚Äôve been seeing red.
---
My flair is finally useful
---
Are you ok man?
---
You seem to be having a stroke. Or is that the sound of your knuckles dragging in the ground I'm hearing?
---
of course, that is the "not really close" part
---
Those are just made up rules. There‚Äôs no real code of honor in the game, and I would more advise you just don‚Äôt BM people, like excessive swinging at people on the hook, t bagging when you escape, or goading by standing somewhere just clicking a flashlight. Like, there should be standard manners but as long as you aren‚Äôt abusing the games mechanics in an unintended way or griefing your teammates just be civil.
---
Her music is for girls that think they can murder someone but ask their mom to order for them at starbucks

The wax warlord bottom and I bought the angel of music top with auric cells. I love this outfit combo so much :D
---
In this situation you're describing youd have time to do the gen under his nose then you should.
---
It‚Äôs the secret tech they don‚Äôt want you to discover. It only feels faster because she walks so slow.
---
Then why do you cower at a new killer?   Just take the L and get better instead of quitting
---
You mean rank? because I don't think it shows level on the results screen
---
Spirit is best girl
---
SWF on Xbox is just horrible.
---
I main as a Doc Killer and for the most part I get a ton of hate messages whether I win or  lose .
---
As a survivor SWF is horribly altruistic to a point of losing a game. 
---
I really don't like playing Solo with a 3 man SWF. It's just not fun. Either it ends too quickly or I'm the only one doing objectives.
---
Stuff seems to get really toxic around ranks 10-7 for some reason. Above or below seems a bit better.
---
The Game is not as Killer-favored as you think. It is full of safe pallets and only one Killer with a specific build can really take advantage of the map‚Äôs small size and multi-floored layout.
---
"prayer bead spirit"

\-"baby survivors"

k
---
No it‚Äôs 25
---
You disgust me as a killer, coming from your killer brother
---
Heck yeah. I cant relate though
---
My first win was against a nurse that just chased me all game. I didn‚Äôt mind too much as it let my team complete the gens for the most part. I think they must‚Äôve been been a baby nurse for me to avoid them as long as I did.
---
the killer can‚Äôt kill anyone
---
Just pure RNG when they'll show up. Starting at level 25 you're guaranteed to get two perks every web to choose from so your odds slightly improve then. 
---
The unfortunate thing is there are currently 60 killer perks. So just imagine it as you're drawing 2 cards from a deck of 6, picking one and then shuffling both back in unless you've drawn a specific card 3 times. Now if you don't have all the teachables unlocked the deck will be smaller but regardless the odds aren't in your favor until you've sunk some serious BP into a character.
---
I found a bottle of champagne it's empty though.
---
bill should be surviving because he is a vet
---
Its sucks, I really get surprised when I get a match with people of my same rank. Happens, but rarely.
---
I try but it's the fact that my teammates keep trying to save and get the hooked person killed
---
The Game is a garbage map for killers. Like almost as bad as Haddonfield and Ormond.
---
Sick!
---
is real.
---
i real.
---
Yeah, but I don't trust BHVR to implement that properly.
---
4 self heals.
---
3 adrenalines.
---
3 dead hards.
---
It seems to me we need a wider meta perk pool
---
how are exhaustion perks relevant at all
---
Rank 20s first time getting outplayed with bt
---
but what if its a console nurse?
---
And that'll take an hour so the other survs can do gens.
---
Hey I also have a ghost face tattoo!
---
You can do pretty much whatever you want.
---
I'm one of the people here who thinks that people shouldn't camp or tunnel early, especially from rank 20-8ish. It is needlessly toxic as it prevents at least one person from being able to play the game at all while not being necessary to win if you are at all decent.
---
Along the same lines, if you are finding that you can't win without camping or tunneling against rank 20-8ish survivors, then you have some improving to do.
---
Ultimately though the only consequence for doing it is that people like me are going to say it's shitty to do, and you might have to read that.
---
I usually try to stick with it but it depends. Are your running Spine chill? If it lights up that the killer is looking at you and you hear the music there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôre coming to check that gen so you might want to hide. I usually try to give it a second to see if it picks up or if it stays faint before I make a decision.
---
Question:  why does everybody run spine chill, but I never hear anyone mention premonition?
---
So if I have dark devotion, will any terror radius perk effects like coulrophobia, unnerving presence, overwhelming presence etc. be applied to my obsession for the time dark devotion is on them or will those perks be rendered null and void until I get my radius back?
---
Omg what so do now? Nothing more to grind for!
---
You don‚Äôt deserve the achievements then.
---
Don't balanced landing and dead hard cancel each other out essentially since they are both exhaustion perks?
---
Take my answer with a grain of salt cuz I‚Äôm pretty new at the game... but the way I usually do it is ill screen peek around and see if I can spot anyone. If I can‚Äôt see them then I stay. Usually they‚Äôll pass and not even notice me. I am low ranked tho
---
&gt; First all killer mains bitched so hard they got decisive nerfed
---
DS was a broken perk. It should have been nerfed long before it was
---
Can i has this format please.
---
Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal. Or just eat it all the time without stopping.

*joyful whistles*
---
Haven't done something like this. Just see so many people who doing this and that's frustrating me.
---
Sure! A lot of tips for Pig apply for killers generally (and you can look up a lot of those on Youtube, etc.) so specific to Pig:
---
-The crouch power is very strong as far as stealth, but the reduced movement speed (96% vs 110% the speed of survivors iirc) means that it's not wise to move around the entire map like that. Rather you're better off moving normally around the map and then crouching when you get within range of a generator. Surveillance (a default pig perk) lets you hear generator repairs from 8 meters further away and highlights any gens that you've damaged that are being worked on, which makes it very powerful as far as sneaking up on survivors who have their attention divided. 
---
-Unlike most powers the dash attack is very situational. Sometimes it will be useful, but the fact that it warns the survivors with that roar just before you launch means that survivors have an extra half a second to react. In many situations it's better to crouch-walk near a generator (like within 10 meters) then stand up and go hit them like normal. 
---
-The Reverse Bear Traps are not likely to get you a lot of kills (most games I get 0 kills from RBTs) but they are good for slowing the game down since survivors, especially 14-15s, will want the trap off ASAP and other survivors will be reluctant to activate gens if it means starting the timer on their teammate. A survivor with a RBT on *must* go to a jigsaw box to remove it, so checking on those can often yield a free hit. 
---
-The Pig's add-ons are mostly mediocre unfortunately. The best 3 by far are Combat straps (increasing crouch/uncrouch speed by 25%), John's medical file (iirc it reduces the charge time and miss cooldown for your ambush/dash attack), and Amanda's videotape (which decreases ambush charge time). Fortunately those 3 are also some of the most common so you can load up on those and never worry about less useful add-ons.
---
-Pig has nothing to aid her in a chase unfortunately, so you just have to rely on your own abilities there. If you're getting looped endlesssly it's always better to just leave and go ambush somebody, the Pig is at her best when she's getting the drop on you. 
---
-Overall the perks that work well for most killers work well for Amanda too. Whispers (General killer perk) is *very* good with her, as you can approach a generator and whispers will go off before the survivors hear your terror radius, so you can crouch immediately and attack there. NOED (No One Escapes Death) is also stronger with her because any survivors with active beartraps (though not *inactive* beartraps) cannot leave through the exit doors or else their heads will explode. NOTE: Survivors with active beartraps can leave through the hatch just fine. Sloppy Butcher is also just useful in general, but especially for Pig since survivors who take the time to heal will have less time to search jigsaw boxes.
---
Hope this helps. Last piece of advice is to watch people play Pig on youtube, there are a ton of great players out there who discuss what they're doing, how they play, etc. specific to the Pig, which is a very useful resource. Good luck! *oink oink*
---
He's a pretty weak killer if you can loop efficiently and punish his pallet respect. 
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/VPr_bQdVkj0) from OhTofu really helped me with understanding the different looping tiles. I highly recommend taking the 10 minutes to watch it fully. 
---
Specifically for avoiding LF:
---
- Never run into an open area. Sounds like a no brainer but you've got to keep it in mind. Make sure there is a window near by to hop though. Force him to M1 you, there's never any reason for him to get an easy chainsaw down. 
---
- Take note if he respects pallet drops or not. Most chainsaw players will respect a pallet drop and start revving before the survivor drops a pallet to save time on the pallet break. If they start revving that means they are respecting the pallet and you can continue running your loop 1 more time. If they continue respecting the drop then continue punishing them for it. (The killer will abuse your punishment with a chainsaw flutter at lower ranks but don't worry about this for now.)
---
- Use lockers to your advantage if he does chainsaw you. Either he'll just stand there revving and waste time, run into it and freak out (beware he's still able to 1-shot you after a bump), or he'll play it safe and put his chainsaw down. After any of these there is a split second where you can jump out and try running away. You'll most likely get hit but it's better than being downed.
---
First of all this scenario is stupid. If a nurse or billy downs me in the first minute of the game their clearly smart enough to not face camp and depending on the game i can still get rescued.
---
its VERY rare that i get stunned by them.  usually im able to get a lunge attack going and smack em in teh mouth.  so yea i dont have an issue with them
---
It's like the most relatable thing man
---
Lmao i was playing oig the ither day and i had this meg doing what you just said so i just for the nearby gen and kept ignoring her and she called me toxic for leaving the chase
---
Any LF that actually tries won't be hitting walls
---
Well there a Huntress body pillow on their website that you buy...
---
That's bit sad. The only gamemode is ranked or play with friends. So many people acting like these and for myself I never did something like this. Just getting fun with the game and maybe I buy some DLCs but rn there some trashbags who teabagging and stuff like that.
---
Tunneling/camping are usually considered bad for several reasons.
---
First, the survivor has a bad experience.  Consider if you are tunneling them.  They aren't able to do anything else then run from you.  It's exciting for a while, but can get dull, especially if they're able to evade you for 2+ minutes.  Camping, primarily face camping, is the same.  No one may come for the survivor, because they don't want to sacrifice themselves.  Means the person on hook just has to sit there until they die.
---
Second, the killer will have a bad experience.  Spending all that time on one player means other players should be getting work done, such as repairing gens, cleansing totems, healing.  In the end, if you camp or tunnel, it usually ends up helping the survivors more than hurting them.
---
There's no "rules", really.  Just try to have fun and ignore the more toxic people.
---
Disconnecting before dying means you have won.
---
I always glance around to get my bearings. If I see two gens, I go to the one that is closer to the center of the map to leave the other one for later. Sometimes I'll wait twenty or thirty seconds to see if the killer walks by before I start working the gen, and then hop on as soon as they leave if they do.
---
If I see any of the notifications that the killer has found someone (screams from clown or doctor for example) then I run to and work a gen. Same goes for basically anything that tells me the killer is chasing someone else (and note this really only saves thirty seconds or so, because I should be hopping on a gen in that time anyways).
---
If I spawn right next to a totem I'll cleanse it in lieu of waiting for the killer to waste those thirty seconds.
---
For me, I hate going against Ghostface, Pig, etc. (meaning the stealthy killers who sneak up on you and ruin your day before you know what's happening). Spine Chill, unlike premonition, tells you if the killer is just spinning around in circles and happened to glance in your direction or if they've locked onto you and are inbound to wreck your shit, which lets you know to run away whereas premonition's warning is just a little too vague to be as useful for me, especially since it doesn't tell you in which direction the killer is going.
---
The one thing I've learned about doing gen's with Ruin.
---
Do it solo, if you do it with other survivors 9 out of 10 times it will regress too much to make a difference.
---
But if you each do your own it's actually feasible without tapping.
---
That's right DAVID or CLAUDETTE! GO FIND YOUR OWN GEN now that you've blown my cover by missing too many damn skill checks " Points at player and points to corner of the map for them to go too"
---
that's cost like 55 dollars
---
Lithe, Dance with Me, Quick &amp; Quiet, lightweight/Urban Evasion.  It‚Äôs one of my favourite bait &amp; chase builds.
---
I stopped using Technition awhile ago. I find it to be more of a crutch perk. I just learned to hit the skill checks and made room for another skill.
---
It's a good perk for beginners though. I have my little sister use it because the killers still make her jump.
---
and what about the survivor?
---
Vomit is hot so is her
---
fells\_good.jpg
---
The thing is that when this happens, you are being told you are up against bad players and are going to win the game.
---
Therefore you get to choose between winning by chasing the teammate around the corner right away or by letting them unhook and then punishing the person who already got fucked over by a shit teammate by preventing them from playing the game.
---
I think it's unnecessarily toxic and will call out people who do it as such.
---
For me kinda it's iffy but yes I guess I am if you think about it I just want people to reflect on their decisions really and how much time they really invest in stuff that could be gone in a few years or maybe months and use that time to find something else they really love that's benefits you but if the person already has a good time spending it on video games then good for them. I feel I've wasted my life on video games kinda and don't want people to do the same as I have.
---
Well, doctor has a very good control of map, since he can slow down the generators a lil bit (monto, yeah), his skillcheck build is perfect for him, the one I actually use tho.
---
Ruin (Slow down the game a lil bit), Unnerving Presence (Reduces the skillcheck according to ur terror radius), distressing (Raises ur terror radius, so unnerving presence gets stronger) and the last perk I usually put Lullaby (hooks = faster or no skillcheck warning) or overcharge ( when u kick a generator, a hard skillcheck pops up, if the surv fails it, it regresses the gen repairs).
---
With the addon that raises the terror radius on treatment mode, u basically get at least 60-70% of the map, so u can find any survivor on map easily.For the chases, there's the addon that raises the distance of ur shock stun, making it easier to block the vaults, making the loops useless.
---
And I'm making just a quick review of 1 of his builds, there's alot [tbh.](https://tbh.Doctor) Doctor is not a high tier, he's mid ofc, but still a very good killer.
---
üòÇ That‚Äôs so funny you lunge attack them. Yeah I suck at stunning with flashlights so I tend not to attempt to do it
---
Depends on the killer and where your nearest pallet is
---
Yep, that buff i fully agree on
---
Oh and btw, the treatment mode applies madness for the survivors wich are on his terror radius, so if you have more terror radius, u find survivor easier, plus the insanity tier gets levels easily.
---
But was it worth the time?
---
&gt; Do you guys ever get sick of it?
---
no because this never actually happens in reality
---
(there have been a bunch of instaheals lately just in general bc of the event)
---
Honestly 9-10 were some of the worst rank experiences for me. Granted I‚Äôm not that good and I just want to have fun. Escaping is great but I really just want to have a good time and get chased/make saves. It just sucks when I get outclassed by someone who it seems has purposely deranked to get some easy kills and demolish a team.
---
It doesn't, because you accuse me of something I didn't do. Where J said DCing against Nurse isn't justified, I said some matches can be unwinnable against her if she uses specific add-ons, again, you read into things I don't even said.
---
The first hit ?
---
Autoaim is a bitch
---
The other two completly his fault
---
&gt; How many times does a killer dc when their hex gets cleansed early?
---
very rarely
---
&gt; How many times do killers dc when 2 or 3 gens pop with no hook?
---
also rarely
---
if a killer rage quits it's always around end game if their one kill gets saved 
---
&gt; but I would say both sides are equally as prone to dc.
---
it's hard to really say because there are more survivors per match, so statistically you're going to notice more survivor DCs. but disconnecting seems to have been happening much much much less often lately in general
---
I play killer on console, I crank up the brightness on my TV and I play with headphones with the volume so high that breaking a pallet in the temple in the red forest is ear rape.

We can say that the Shrine of Secrets is now your Bitch, you own the entity.

Just started playing yesterday. Played some survivor, some killer. When I played killer I just went around killing people... didn‚Äôt know there was some unwritten etiquette.
---
Lunges naturally have huge hit boxes, to deal with Windows and stuff, so combine that with lag and it is not a fun time
---
I don't use it for the skillchecks. I use it because of the lack of noise. I think it's no noise until you get less than 8 meters? 
---
You'd be shocked how many killers just walk near gen's to see if they hear something and move on. Also with Urban Evasion I just walk behind the gen or tree. Sometimes If I'm lucky I just stop repairing and they kick the gen and walk away while I'm still sitting there.
---
Scary Terry says, sup bitch?
---
Lithe and sprint burst
---
Thanks. That makes sense, I guess.  I just like the auditory warning from premonition so i don't have to obsessively pay attention to spine chill.
---
Would be nice.  Honestly, I think it's silly that chat is dependent on the killer staying.
---
Yeah, imagine Freddy actually catching a survivor WITHOUT bloodlust
---
Just finish in front of your mom ultimate power move
---
Don't know for definite but since the you'd be connected to the server and not the host, they'd be no reason not to be able to continue to chat
---
I'm a hag main.
---
Lay down traps constantly. It's quick and you want to always have 5+ traps down at any one time.
---
Trap up the killer shack if you're near it (one in the middle, one outside the window, and one outside the pallet). I do the jungle gym too. Otherwise I will trap either side of a few pallets I see as I head out to patrol.
---
Setting one trap under a hook is just as effective as setting more. You are slowing them down/making them notify you that they flashlighted the trap.
---
If you hook someone in the basement in the back two hooks, you can set a trap out in front of them. It only gets triggered when someone goes for the save and then you can get an easy grab (I only do this late game or when I'm at higher ranks because I think it's super toxic at low ranks).
---
You are pretty shit at chases, so have to rely on ambushes to get people. My favorite is when they vault something and trigger a trap and vault back only for me to never actually teleport and just hit them. On the other hand you are really good at 3 gen late game, so it's not the worst strategy to just eat pallets early until you can completely take over late game.
---
Also, when you are against potatoes who always trigger your traps when going for unhooks, let the unhooked person go and down the unhooker. Please. You're going to win the game, there's no reason to be toxic too.
---
Then let them try. You can't make your team mates stop what they're doing or tell them off so focus on getting enough points to not depip. Theres always something you can do. You're not always supposed to win.
---
I love how survivors think they can dictate how a killer plays in certain situations. You don't control the game. Ever watch a horror movie? People get tunneled all the time.
---
Wake up from what I‚Äôve read is glitched to where it does a 15% speed boost to everything during the game iirc?
---
yea is that getting patched tomorrow???? hopefully???
---
It took about 130 bloodwebs to get bbq tier 1 on one of my killers
---
It‚Äôs been fixed
---
Shoutout to u/zombiehugger for the meme templates and discord!
---
So, how salty was post game chat?
---
I just want an ugly Christmas sweater for Quentin that‚Äôs Freddy‚Äôs sweater
---
Lol yup tomorrow will be a 95% Freddy day. This will happen for a few weeks I imagine, since everybody was Ash/Ghostface for the first 2 weeks or so.
---
Pretend you're going to the right side of the pallet but not completely. The survivor will think you want to go all to way to where he is and jump the pallet, then you quickly go to the left side and hit them.
---
&gt; the only reason it would be in effect is if you tunnel
---
That's just simply untrue.
---
She's a grown woman who can take out fully trained soldiers, while surviving the harsh Russian winter.
---
She may not be exactly civilized, but she is FAR from a child.
---
I'm fine with Noed. What I don't like is having killers complain about Mettle of Man being nerfed because it rewards mistakes by survivors, while Killers don't get why it cycles to having people complain that Noed rewards killers that can't pressure gens.
---
Thank you for this information. Just out of curiosity do you think running bbq, ruin, surveillance and something like Whispers as last perk? I have bought many killers but need leveling most. Still missing GF, clown (no pgtw sadly), plague and freddy so closed off on there perks (apart from bamboozle from shrine)
---
We literally just had ghostface lol and plague is cool hater .
---
When it comes to chases, I'm not really a fan of how it always turns into using loops and pallets. I have no idea how it could look instead, maybe multileveled maps would be more interesting.
---
Wait you can have the 2 killer glitch in a real game. I thought it was just KYF....
---
Then yeah either legion or maybe the shape if you like dying light. A really really good perk build for legion is discordance for gens, thanatophobia and dying light for speed penalties, ruin for, well ruin, and then whatever you like. You can also get clown for pop goes the weasel.
---
Don't have Ghostface or Spirit but Hag has Ruin which is very popular in all killers' builds. Doctor is considered low tier. He can be very fun and has some potential, but that's all killers and Doctor is not an easy killer. 
---
I hear Spirit is hard to use, but if you're not complete ass at tracking, I hear she's pretty easy to use. On Survivor (Rank 12), I only seen Spirit lose if she lacked the basic fundamentals of playing Killer.
---
why distressing sorry
---
Name a community that has some sort of competition against other players that doesn't have toxicity. League has it, Overwatch has it, fuck even sports like Soccer have it.
---
I'll take things that didn't happen for 500, Alex.
---
I love playing Pig, especially if you have teachables from other killers. Surveillance (All generators you kick have their auras turn white, and will turn yellow for 8-16 seconds when someone starts working on them again) and Stake Out (you'll gain tokens anytime you're in the killer's terror radius, anytime you hit a good skill check a token will be spent to make it a great skill check) are two of my favorite perks in the game.
---
Thank you for the input. Im a rank 8 survivor currently and I dont see many spirits.
---
It was more recent (possibly around spirit or less likely clown) and due to the changes in engine and lighting which basically broke it, hence the removal.
---
Well she didnt call me toxic ur right but she did call me trash and and was complaining about me leaving a chase
---
Could be wrong, but I believe balanced landing reduces stagger even when exhausted, which makes some loops a lot easier to keep going.
---
If you get the Sprint also it's just a bonus.
---
Plague is awesome. Bought her with my shards recently and was not having any luck getting kills. Now I got some decent perks for her, she's my favorite Killer, like I thought she would be when I bought her.
---
Wow, I never knew that those perks could be as strong as they really are. I will definitely consider them.
---
It‚Äôs really fucking stupid. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a big influx of people joining this sub or if it‚Äôs just killers venting through memes for the 18th time this last week.
---
Unnecessary slugging like 4 or 5 gens and purely just trying to slug everyone for no reason other than to be a dick
---
Always a bit of room for bloodpoints
---
Damn. You're a good pig killer, gg
---
I would've never expected that if I was in that game lmao
---
Lot of complaining but in deathgarden they removed looping and pallets and the gameplay is awfull.
---
Isnt that the huntress lullaby? You have to stack it before it removes the sound for skill checks though
---
Nah, you're looking at it wrong again.
---
I tried to see if any good can come of it but all that really changes is just Killers will have to make sure you stay on the hook. At that point, everyone else is dead, Killer earned their 4k, why fight a lost battle?
---
I think you're projecting a lot of insecurities onto OP tbh
---
I am convinced you have never played a match of Dbd or you are just really stupid. Probably both. If someone plays LF and decides to camp, there is nothing exhaustion perks can do about that.
---
Hex: Huntress Lullaby? It means that for each hook? (Don't quote me on that) the killer gets one stack. Each stack shortens the time between the sound notification and the skill check, at 5 stacks there is no warning sound. Break the totem, stop the effects
---
Huntress lullaby, it‚Äôs a hex perk.
---
Huntress's lullaby
---
Basically each time someone is hooked it delays the sound further
---
At 5 hooks the sound is completely gone
---
It's a totem (for some reason) so break it be time
---
That‚Äôs so trueüòÇ
---
Lol it increases your terror radius, so yes
---
&gt;but start injured
---
nah he's trolling.
---
They removed Splinters for non-liscensed Killers. You can still get them for Myers, Leatherface, Pig, Freddy, and I don't know about Ghostface.
---
I hate killer now because of how unbalanced the game is, I dont feel like playing nurse/billy/spirit every game
---
Wait people actually play DBD for the lore?
---
You‚Äôre smart for a low ranked player, most would start sprinting away from the gen at the faintest heartbeat
---
^(Quality shitpost.)
---
The benefits of surveillance are obvious but Stake Out is probably the strongest counter to Ruin in the game right now. I definitely try to get them for all my killers/survivors these days.
---
Not talking about the goal of the game, I am talking about the game being fun for its player base, which relies on matches being 80% survivors. Sounds like a killer main who doesn't understand that it isn't fun to sit there tapping a button so that your teammates can play and you get to wait 20 mins for another match.
---
I stay green/purple because Red Ranks is hell.
---
Nurse is a massive chore to play and Spirit gets boring. Can't for the life of me control Billy sprints either.
---
What would you say is a better killer perk? Surveillance or discordance
---
Bro how does this happen in real games I thought it was only KYF matches?
---
Interesting. I did several rounds as survivor yesterday then a few as killer. Someone messaged me after one of my killer games calling me a camper and I was confused because it seems like an obvious strategy as a killer playing for the first time.
---
I don't feel any obligation in a PVP game to "let" other players have fun. Nor do I feel that others are obligated to let me off the hook. Personally, I'd be pretty annoyed if the killer just stopped trying. The most fun I had as survivor was avoiding getting caught. If I got caught, it's probably because I made too much noise or took a risk at repairing a generator instead of running.
---
If I get hooked and camped... it's just not that big of a deal to me. I'll just re-queue and try again and get better at avoiding the killer (I got WAY better as the day progressed).
---
I was playing green rank earlier today and it felt like red ranks still
---
They are greedy. This game is practically a pre-release after 3 years with how undeveloped it still is.
---
I like this format
---
On top of what other people have said, know when and where you can mind game and where you shouldn‚Äôt bother. I‚Äôve had killers try to mind game me at really long loops with low walls, but it‚Äôs usually a waste of time if the survivor can see you. You need to do it in places where their line of sight is blocked, or where the loop is small enough that making them pause gets you close enough for a hit.
---
I honestly do agree that Bamboozle is a really dumb perk, but I think it's more dumb design to counteract dumb design, as opposed to "you're dumb for using it." Put bluntly I don't like that Bamboozle has to exist just to counter overpowered loops instead of Behavior simply fixing these loops so that they aren't abused.
---
With that being said excluding "fixing broken game design" I think Bamboozle is fine, as it allows for strategic play from a Killer to stop a Survivor that's relying too hard on a vault from abusing it. In that aspect I think it does what it's meant to do and it's a lot less oppressive than the likes of say Ruin.
---
But again the big problem I have is that its primary purpose is to counteract bad game design, like a lot of perks in this game seem to exist to do.
---
Camp whenever you want to. Don't handicap yourself for people who won't do the same for you.
---
"I'm sorry, thicc one"
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted, i'd like to know how to see personal stats as well.
---
When the killer ignores all other survivors &amp; focuses on one lone survivor.
---
"I'm sorry, big boi"
---
I learned to make the skillcheck button the middle mouse button, helps me 10x with this issue. Was uncomfortable at first but after over 1,000 hours I practically enjoy my coke vanilla and hit perfect skill checks!
---
It's not about controlling the Gane it's about being bmed and not knowing how to play the game. Which you clearly have a problem with both.
---
F
---
fair
---
No, Dwight actually. And I don't even like bringing in a flashlight because unless you have hundreds of hours practicing using one I find a medkit or even toolbox much more useful.
---
I've had mostly good experiences with it, as long as you do an 18 or 21+ party! You can always leave the party if it gets too intense or just do kyf so it's more chill too
---
Had someone get all bent of shape when I allowed them to get the generators far out, and patrolled the clustered/nearer ones, rather than hiking all over the map. Dude accused me of camping? Is this like an actual 'I shouldn't do this thing'? I thought it was just smart playing....
---
I've had this bug too (I say it's a bug because I had a few friends where their music was fine) and it is so much harder to tell the difference from the intensity of the heartbeat vs the TR music.
---
Same.  Yesterday I saw killer mains talking about how survivors need to stop bitching about blood warden, which is at least slightly more believable
---
Hex huntress lullaby might be what your talking about. But at least 4 or 5 hooks need to happen before it actually activates
---
I have no idea what I‚Äôm supposed to see here
---
It's like one of the few tactics that I've seen for a killer, I'd definitely say there's more scrub tactics for survivors than killers and I've only played for about 20 hours, like earlier I kept being flash lighted while breaking pallets but I don't moan I just take it as part of the game
---
I'm just spitballing here, but what if completely multilevel maps was all about pure mindgames and map knowledge? Drops and climbs and cutoffs in between, with the killers movement speed closer to the survivors so they cant just follow and eventually catch up?
---
Or how about if the killers were actually slower in a footchase, but they had abilities that needs to be used to close the distance? That would certainly raise the skill ceiling if nothing else. Think of it somewhat similar to what the nurse does. Maybe you'd have a killer that can create walls to force survivors somewhere?
---
I completely agree. I‚Äôve been trying to do adept killer and it‚Äôs crazy hard so I figured I would switch and go for the adept survivor achievements instead. The difference is night and day on the difficulty level.
---
r/hardbodies ?
---
You are aware that exhaustion exists and cannot be recovered until you stop running for 60 seconds, right? Therefore anything that was not already an infinite cannot be made into an infinite with a one-time use exhaustion perk. 
---
An infinite is an infinite, exhaustion perks have no bearing on that. 
---
I didn't realise you were new to the game. Sorry.
---
You collect all, what did it cost you?
---
It doesn't go away. Someone told me to go fuck myself for slugging yesterday. 
---
They were a SWF that used insta heals, flashlight blinded, and tbagged me.
---
What am I supposed to do? Not kill you?
---
Yea I don't think it is a huge problem, but still a problem. I play mostly survivor and I will tell you that I have had countless killers dc if their ruin gets cleansed, sometimes even mid match when they already have had a couple hooks. I would say it is rare, but not unheard of, at least in my matches.
---
ah, the "fuck you in particular" build
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be mean but it‚Äôs rank 14. When you get into purple ranks and below people learn how to counter nurse and just be a productive team and then that‚Äôs when you realize why nurse is looked down upon on console.
---
Gotcha. Wasn‚Äôt trying to argue, was just wondering. *shrug*
---
Michael, Freddy, or Pig.

Lmao okay dude, deas hard will really punish that camper oh boy

Maybe we could get Safehead from the Evil Within. Granted it might be too close to The Hag.

You make no sense. Blinding a killer who is chasing you is easily counterable and definitely not a scrub tactic.
---
Tips for flashlights:
---
Run lightborn
---
Run Franklin's demise
---
Look away from the light
---
Turn up audio
---
You can easily follow their footstpes while blinded so often times they will get barely any extra ground out of the blind. The perks will pretty much nullify their flashlights entirely.
---
Personally, I don't believe in "camping" gens.  Your job is to patrol and protect them.  If you want to let some go to force them into a 3-gen strat where it's easier for you to patrol and monitor the three, that's a perfectly valid play.  Some people will be aggravated no matter what you do because they lost/didn't have an easy win.
---
It's just not very rewarding gameplay imo for either side. For some loops killers will never catch up (the garage on that one autowreckers level comes to mind), and survivors are literally just running in a circle. 
---
Survivors are right to play it like that, it's the best way of wasting the killers' time and giving your teammates time to do gens, but that doesn't mean it makes for fun gameplay. 
---
Looping is also such a huge part of the game that it renders most killers much less useful. If you're not Nurse, Billy, or Spirit (or, to a lesser extent, Huntress or Plague) then you don't really have any tools to help you break a loop or win a chase in a short amount of time. Though I am a Pig main and I love playing as her, I also recognize that she can get looped easily and it can be a pain in the ass dealing with that. That's what leads people to go for pallet-eater builds with enduring and spirit fury (or, in my case, getting Bamboozle from the shrine).
---
I hope you get there man! Keep going!

They do on Haddonfield with Balanced Landing.

Tis the joys of bad ping, ive pallets hit, where someone should have been hit through them too, but also people hit through pallets after they are safely on the other side
---
Lag especially killer side as they host, but any lag really can mess the game up
---
I would get Cannibal done first.  BBQ can help you track and gain blood points.  After that, probably get Hag done for Ruin, since it is also on all your builds.  After that, I don't think order matters as much.
---
When you can guarantee a hit because 3 pallets go down like nothing Now on badham, who needs bloodlust?
---
But that is also your opinion?
---
To get your personal stats you either have to find yourself on the leaderboard (best way to do that is by rank from what I've found) or to donate to the website directly.
---
That happenee recently too. I was trying to get bbq on huntress and it took me 30 levels
---
have you considered that maybe you are just not a very good killer yet because you haven't put the time into practicing it like you have survivor? After all you said you've exclusively played survivor before this.
---
That being said, I think killer is at the very least, far more punishing for mistakes and more stressful than survivor. Survivor you have 3 other (hopefully) competent people on your team to help carry some responsibility. When you are killer, it's all up to you. I personally think this makes survivor less stressful to play.

Not sure why you got downvoted. That'd be the plan. I mean don't go down on purpose, but look to use it if you do go down.
---
You didn't know? If you are chasing someone and he goes to the hook, he is essentially "camp protected" now and you have to essentially go search for a non-existing survivor on the other side of the map.
---
Oooo a nurse main that‚Äôs good because their never any nurses on console and if you know how to play her well or decent you can destroy games by my experience. Well good luck on your journey :)
---
I guess that's struggle since it's also mapped to spacebar
---
All cosmetics? Haha no where close. I have many of the killer cosmetics because that is the side I play more but as for survivor I only have a few cosmetics. 
---
Maybe that will be the next objective if I win the lottery :)
---
Sneak 0
---
Yes the devs said on twitter
---
Why pick them up in the first place if you have rancor?
---
Yea for you but for killers mains it could be infuriating having everyone be coordinated that or if you're playing survivor getting harassed about every mistake you commit. I see it as a positive and a negative I think the most likely is that it's for SWFs so they don't have to have discord open or whatever communication they use
---
good luck lmao
---
Most people play Hag like garbage. EZ escape almost always. Comparing her to Nurse in any way is also goofy
---
I'd much rather face an Hag over a nurse or spirit lol
---
There are
---
I mean I just slug anyone who purposefully runs away from the hooks like that. He only gets to use his unbreakable once anyway
---
If your ears are bleeding you aren't trying, jk.
---
But I do play with the volume pretty high as killer or survivor. If I'm close to a survivor I can hear their breathing as if I had equipped Stridor at all times, but it can be annoying while playing survivor since your own breathing is pretty noisy too.
---
The brightness tip I learned it from a video from Ardetha.
---
Most times I just leave if it‚Äôs a hag depends on whether I can be arsed
---
It only really cost me the money in buying the DLC which I don't consider bad because of how much I play this game! (just don't pay attention to how many cosmetic I have)

You will get there and already have nice progress! Keep it up :)

The idea is they were not your obsession to begin with, but because Decisive Strike changes the obsession to *that* survivor, you can now mori them.

aha found them

\-Host can be on either sides.  
---
1.Survivor(s) need(s) to Ready Up. (They don't need to do anything whatsoever)  
---
2.Both Killers need to be assigned on Spectator Role.  
---
3.One of the killer proceeds to vocally announce a countdown. (3,2,1, GO)  
---
4.Taking latency into consideration the Killer that is not doing the countdown should switch to Killer Role when he hears 1 and Ready Up as fast as possible.  
---
5.Killer that is doing the countdown should switch to Killer Role and Ready Up as fast as possible when he says go. 
---
 If the game tells you there is more than 1 Killer to start the match rinse and repeat.  If the latency isn't too high and you struggle to make it happen consider reducing the gap between 1 and GO.
---
DO NOT USE DOCTOR (he will break the game)
---
And some perks may not work

Hope that helps :)

A penalty, built into DS, or other Obsession perks, that is active while you are the Obsession.  The penalty could be any number of things.  Bloodlust activating faster when chasing Obsession, pallet stuns last shorter if pallet is thrown by obsession, etc.  The penalty should be minor enough that it doesn't call for a buff to the existing perk.
---
Otherwise, what's the point of being the obsession?
---
I had a couple games like this. One was against ghost face on the farm map with the tall house (can't remember the name). Three gens clustered right together (one being at the top of the house).
---
Though it was a solo game, my team was pretty good. It was a lot of fun (and frustrating, but not in a bad way). Turned into a marathon, as he was downing us once then rushing to the gens, trying to keep track. I think we powered the exit gates but ended up dying (don't remember).
---
Anyway, I don't consider it camping.. if anything it's a problem with map design/RNG having the gens being unreasonably close together. If a killer is doing this it's just good strategy, and not unbeatable.
---
I can‚Äôt wait until dc ‚Äòing gets punished.

Yeah that makes sense. However, it's now worth noting that push to talk and "cheat" are bound to the same key
---
am I saying for them to tailor the game for me I'm just saying that push to talk possibly meaning Ingame chat might improve solo survivor a shitload
---
Blind, deaf, and dumb, that Killer is.
---
The spirit found hatch in 23 seconds and hooked me st a gate in 32 seconds....
---
Do not buy this game when it launches.
---
He means survivors waste their perk slot if they run ds and killers don't run any obsession perks.
---
It could work, but only if LF makes a mistake. Anyone who knows what they're doing would wait until the survivors hit the ground first. With those charge addons, Bubba can still get you as long as he's fairly close to you
---
If they add voice chat every game with have 4 survivors that can communicate with each other
---
Well... Ill be dammned. The interet suprised me once again.
---
Or they're playing with friends who don't play as often. Good luck with that ban.
---
&gt; am I saying for them to tailor the game for me
---
When you reply to genuine concerns with "don't care I don't play killer" then yeah you are a little bit
---
I really hope they don‚Äôt because killer is already unbearable and I don‚Äôt want to hear kids scream like banshees.
---
Good concept on paper, but with how bad queue times are now this would just make it worse
---
I've been saving up all my Freddy addons
---
Or when they go super ham still like cmon I don‚Äôt need to escape but like give everyone including yourself a game that‚Äôs longer than five minutes so we can all get BP lol
---
Is this seriously what the mobile graphics look like? Jesus
---
What‚Äôs dying light do?
---
Well the louder you look the more attracted the killers get to well kill you. Louder colors on survivors often make people think you're more toxic which makes you a bigger target.
---
For some reason, Haddonfield offerings make me hit Alt+F4 when I'm not on Spirit. It's so weird. I should probably get it checked out.
---
When I play killer and there's an early DC, I tend to let at least some of them escape. Usually I'll kill one and let the rest go. It's not their fault that their asshole teammate bailed on them.
---
I misspoke earlier, I exclusively played survivor that patch. I have gotten to rank 8 as a killer before but that was a while back. I know how to  mind game, hide my red light, slug for the 4K and all that. I have a good game knowledge, but that doesn‚Äôt matter when survivors can just loop you at ultra safe loops till several gens are done. It‚Äôs especially bad considering swf has constant communication and info so they can gen rush you or cleanse totems even more effectively.
---
Nice...but also very sad
---
Why do survivors teabag if a killer isn't doing well? I was trying to get my trophy for Hillbilly of downing 50 people with my chainsaw so I just went in there downing people and leaving them on the ground. I wasn't going to hook anyone and I was going to let everyone live. I purposely avoided using my sledgehammer or whatever it is. Anyway, this toxic ass David with the shirtless cosmetic and a flashlight teabags me when I easily could've downed him a bunch of times but I was trying to use my chainsaw. I message him and ask him not to teabag me and he tells me "your so bad". So I explain to him I downed them all a bunch of times and could've hooked them, do you want me to hook you? And he says no so I tell him to be nice. He continues teabagging me so I hook him. I tell him to stop. He teabags me again. So I hook him again and again later and he dies. He messages me like "wtf". Like I was just fucking around and trying to get a trophy but I don't understand when a killer is bad and survivors teabag like it's some accomplishment and they're so good. Don't be obnoxious. The whole time I teabag as a survivor is when the killer camped and tunnelled and I want to rub it in at the exit gate that I still got away.

---
Devs could have some debug function labeled as cheat
---
I would actually be cool if the inmage were reversed
---
:(
---
Oooor maybe because you're a pos and proud of it. People tend to dislike that shit.
---
Survivor is a cake walk, every part of the map is designed to help survivors with the exception of the game.
---
If a rank 1 killer is getting 4ks, then the survivors are not true rank 1s, or are throwing away escapes to try and help others. 
---
I expect to get ~4 hooks on average, or maybe a few kills if someone DC's. If I win, it's an outlier, because good survivors don't just get rolled like that. Of course I don't play nurse much, and use Spirit and trapper more. 
---
Even rank 1 nurses should have a hard time winning on every map against rank 1 survivors.
---
I died a little inside watching this. . .
---
Gotcha. I thought the penalty was already in your comment and felt crazy because I couldn't figure out what it was haha.
---
I don't see any reason someone should receive a penalty for using a perk just because the killer chose not to use a perk of the same "type" regardless of how small it is
---
Poor leatherface is going to be the worst killer after the Freddy rework
---
It‚Äôs not just this game it‚Äôs all online pvp games and most pve games as well
---
Yes. Dark devotion carries all of those effects.
---
Just it saying from my perspective, no offense brother
---
I really thing it's just because you're less stealthy the more colorful you are. If there's a blendette and a colorful feng both running around in view of the killer, the killer is more likely to go for the feng just because he saw her first.
---
How so?  There's four Survivor perks that give a chance of being the obsession.  So no, I don't automatically know what perk someone has.  That's not counting the fact that multiple people could run the same perk, and only one can be the obsession.
---
This is trapper for you
---
I've made rank 1 on both sides before, and let em say it is a toxic hellhole up there. I only play for fun, I have all th perks I need so idc about winning. i wont purposely hurt my team though, its just that my only goal of being escape is L A M E. 
---
Around rank 10 is the perfect area: People who are good enough to stay there do, the smurf SWFs stay at rank 15... I just find it the most tolerable
---
Probably trying to do his daily rituals if I were to guess
---
I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted for this, camping a three-man (with five generators remaining) is viable.
---
Your first victim takes 120 seconds to die, in this time the other survivors each pop a generator (80 seconds) and probably a third (2-man = 44 seconds).
---
They have 2 generators remaining, but you can chase one them, this means that the last survivor has to repair those two survivors by themselves (160 seconds), so if you catch one of them you can camp them (120 seconds) as long as the chase doesn't last forever.
---
By the time that survivor dies you've still got a minute or so before the last survivor could pop the generator and open the gates, and even if they try it that gives you 40 seconds or so to look for the hatch and close it anyway, **you can kill all three of them through camping unless they're incredibly talented loopers**.
---
It's not like camping someone in a four-man where the first four generators will pop in two minutes unless they're complete potatoes and you won't be able to catch anyone because the fifth generator is going to pop in 50 seconds at most.
---
Maybe they should just change the system and let the lower level player go against a higher level killer? He has a bodyguard right, but no that's not how it works right?
---
\- I wouldn't lose a second of sleep of people exploiting a system that get banned for a Week or so... It would actually clean up the game a whole lot if BHVR wasn't cradling POS players that much!
---
I just want some cosmetics for Quentin :(
---
I agree in some cases it's a flaw, but I don't think of it as camping. Camping inolves the killer at least partially ignoring the objective (prevent gens and kill survivors). In your case, you would have had to ignore your objective to "let" the survivors accomplish theirs. If I was in your game I'd have considered it a wash, and started trying to farm BP off you in chases until I died. :)
---
What does "clutch" mean in dbd?
---
Wait, is Object of Obsession and Decisive the only Survivor Obsession perks? 
---
And the point still stands. If I have no obsession perks, those 2 perks are basically only beneficial to the survivor with no possible downside. 
---
Not saying it's unbalanced because they both have counter play.
---
You leave that poor baby Trapper alone :(
---
What will you do when an event comes up and you have to buy a whole bloodweb to get 1 special item/offering? (think, bbq event and hallowed blight)
---
Prestiging a character is the best way to get event items/offerings, and having everything maxed kind of hurts you, forcing at least 10-12 purchases minimum per web.
---
Who needs stealth when you've got an M.D
---
If you have no idea what the fuck you‚Äôre doing, sure
---
As a primary solo player, I have recently been discussing this with a few of my DBD friends. Early on, I had a rule that I wouldn't talk/listen in game, and only chat in the lobby's. But, I was still finding swf to not be as thrilling as solo, just based off the security of being in a match with a partner.
---
It's the unpredictability, and uncertainty of others, that truly makes solo that much more fulfilling for me. Most games go well. Especially when you get into a lobby first, and see survivors slowly trickle in, one by one, knowing everyone is in fact solo. And everyone working as a team without communication, is truly something special.
---
But always having that inate fear, of not knowing the intentions of others: will they sabotage you, will they allow you to heal them, do they have borrowed time, etc.
---
My best moments have been a couple hatch escapes with one other random. Both have been myself finding a key earlier in the match. And then using bond to find the other remaining player. Us frantically searching for the hatch. Only to eventually escape.
---
Lol thanks for proving my point. And if you actually knew how to play killer you would see where you are wrong. I'm not gonna explain it either cause it's pretty fucking simple.
---
Nurse is broken, but 
---
What survivors do to killers, Nurse does to survivors. 
---
You need her to make mistakes other wise she instantly kills you. Best counter is mindgames. Break line of sight,take a turn around a corner then run back, go into lockers (Nurse can't open lockers in her teleport fatigue). 
---
Other than that there isn't anything built into the game to counter Nurse try your best to outsmart them.
---
I actually had this problem earlier. I was going to play normally, and on first hook of 1 Survivor another DC'd.
---
Then the guy on the Hook DC'd. Then a 3rd DC'd
---
I was like 'Oooooh...kaaaay'
---
He would never he's definitely 100% a real surgeon I promise
---
I do wish MoM would see some change, they nerfed it only after ash sales went down. I've honestly noticed scummy business things like this and how the new big skin cost the little extra 88 cells so its a 15$ skin instead of 10. I dont wan tot call it greedy, but there is no way they waited 2 months after ash to nerf a perk like that
---
At least someone agrees
---
&gt;:^)
---
Personally I wait until a few days after rank reset to do those (because they are pretty impossible once you hit higher ranks, mostly because the survivors will bully you to oblivion without ruin or any useful perk build.
---
I generally dont have much issue with dcs, because I usually play killer giving them a lot of chances to save, usually low rank survivors are easy enough to hunt down and locate that you dont need to tunnel or go ham on them to keep the pressure
---
25% penalty to gen repair, healing, and sabotage for the entirety of the match.
---
Guess I gotta give it some more time. I‚Äôm at 12 on my way there so we‚Äôll see how it is before rank resets again.
---
Well my emoji failed wonderfully
---
I'm like 3/4ths of the way there, congrats!
---
Balanced landing also provides a resistance to fall stun, with or without the speed boost. Without this, the killer would be able to hit them while they‚Äôre immobile from falling. With balanced landing, however, the survivor can just keep running and ignore the fall stun.
---
Mettle of Man and Sole Survivor also have a chance for Obsession.
---
We basically had that and she was not as good as spirit/billy
---
That's not how you use this format
---
I usually run Urban so I pray for a hag
---
Did Endgame Collapse exist back then?
---
It's okay, we all have bad days, I understood what you meant by it tho
---
Also, Great art work!

And now that song is stuck in my head. I love you and hate you, OP.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cgidhu/you_can_see_survivors_through_the_generators_aura/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Lery's has so many windows now, it's definitely an absolutely pain, and it also feels weird to move through - the haphazard layout makes it harder to patrol all the generators.
---
The Game is painful because all the pallets are ridiculously safe, particularly ones around the bathroom/basement hallways, but the rooms are so cluttered for being so small that you're basically guaranteed larger obstacles to loop around or pretty good windows if you can track the red stain.
---
The upper floor is a pain, between the pallets and half the rooms having balanced landing points at least.
---
Moira mains unite
---
ignore the hooked player and focus gens then.  If they are facecamping then gens is the best counter strat.  camping is a poor strat for killers, less bp and less chance of pips.
---
I mean, your only prestige 1. Getting to prestige 3 would give you a higher chance of obtaining better perks
---
I usually play like any other game but let last one escape
---
I decided to say fuck it and not prestige and get every tier 3 perk might prestige next double BP
---
Oh! This is actually something I really enjoy figuring out!
---
The next chapter will add in 984 levels accounting for a new survivor and new killer that need to be maxed and to level up everyone 9 times.
---
When I crunch the numbers that is about 40 million bloodpoints required to max out again. 
---
If I am streaming I earn about 1.5 million BP a day so it'll take me about 27 days to hit max after the new content :)
---
Pleaseeeeeee let this happen
---
&gt; There's four Survivor perks that give a chance of being the obsession. So no, I don't automatically know what perk someone has
---
oh come on. It's always DS unless it's OoO which you know usually right away, and you know that.
---
anyway, what is the "free advantage?"
---
"Get the fuck out here you salty bitch"
---
How ironic
---
No. But for a killer to be top tier, they need anti loop. The pig is iffy at stopping loops.
---
I'm quite capable of playing the game. Your opinion on how everyone else should play the game is irrelevant. Keep on whining you little bitch.
---
If some p3 Claudette flashlight spams me I‚Äôm going out of my way to kill them
---
Depends on the day, I have had days where there has been 4 or 5 disconnects. So somwtimes countless. I am saying in my experience killers dc'ing is just as common as survivors
---
This is why I like OoO and Sole Survivor. I try to get chased as much as I can. If I happen to outlive my team mates then I basically have wall hacks.
---
Not really, no.
---
If old Pig existed right now with ECG, she'd be A Tier, purely for how impossible it'd be to escape if she catches you.
---
as soon as I stopped camping I noticed that I got 4Ks more consistently
---
&gt;  If I have no obsession perks, those 2 perks are basically only beneficial to the survivor with no possible downside. 
---
...Almost no perks have a downside. Where the fuck did this come from? Since when do perks need to have a downside?
---
Yea no problem
---
i think last time i stopped by your stream you were super close and were working on Freddy(?) - congrats on finally getting there, my dude!!
---
How long did that take you my guy?
---
What exactly do you do on a map with exclusively safe pallets all connected together?
---
It's not for "no reason" though. To me, the Obsession mechanic should be like a soft "No Mither". Like a soft hard mode. The Object of Obsession has "see and be seen" mechanic going for it. That is proper risk/reward for when the *survivor* chooses to be an Obsession imo.
---
Idk, to me the Obsession mechanic feels half baked in general. I think it should come with some small base properties as well.
---
now when the next chapter comes out that will only be an additional 1422 bloodwebs to go through to get the new characters' perks on the existing cast and unlock ALL perks on the new killer/survivor.
---
Wrong actually.
---
The Killer can open one of the gates now (not both) unless they've closed the Hatch.
---
The Killer was nice in letting Bill open the gate for bloodpoints and/or a daily, they could've slugged Bill, checked for DS with a pick up, dropped him (or downed him again), opened it, and still gotten him to the hook outside for Blood Warden.
---
Abusing desisiv strike ? Its made to punish tunneling killers .
---
‚ÄùTheres this thing in the game called a mori, but you aren‚Äôt really allowed to use them because they are ‚Äùtoxic‚Äù.‚Äù
---
Cool thanks!
---
What is tunneling?
---
goes to show how you can say some stupid garbage but as long as you make it obvious that the gist of your comment can be summarized to ‚Äúdae survivor bad and toxic and crybaby?‚Äù you‚Äôll get upvoted on this subreddit
---
No, if you get her (or any survivor/killer) to lvl 50 you just have never ending blood webs, so you can still get new perks, items, adding, etc. You of course have the option to prestige to get a new cosmetic and slightly better chances at getting rarer items and addons and what not. So prestige if you want but just remember that you lose all your perks, items, offerings, and addons and you have to get new ones. Hope this helped :)
---
They didnt change his blocks??
---
I had the same issue yesterday. Obvious derankers who got destroyed by me who hasn't played a lot of killer in months so I am sitting at low rank.
---
It‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre already guaranteed a win in a 3v1. Unless you‚Äôre REALLY unfamiliar with the killer role.
---
If you‚Äôre guaranteed to Pip up, what‚Äôs the harm in letting the unfortunate survivors get some BP? It‚Äôs not taking any points from you. You can even farm MORE bloodpoints than you usually would if you wanted to.
---
But if they were toxic ... then close the hatch right in front of them and let the endgame take em. 
---
Now THATS toxic.
---
Is it thinking they're more toxic or just having an easier time finding and tracking them?
---
Holy shit, that's impressive! I play the game 24/7 and i'm still at devotion 2, but damn that's dedication.
---
I got you
---
Iridescent addon- Sparkling Inhaler: An apparatus that glistens with unnerving yet beautiful force.

Removes the screech after blinking any number of blinks and slightly reduces fatigue, but considerably reduces blink range.
---
Yeah I was really looking forward to trying myers out but oh well. I'll just pick up that pack one day anyways
---
I appreciate that you dont view survivors as godly because so many do and I think they just use it as an excuse for playing poorly.
---
PC is a whole other playground lol. The precision that you have on PC is unmatched. I wrecked a dude the other day and was wondering what was going on and it was his first time on PC with his friends.
---
The argument isnt that "back in my day" so it's not still broken. I think the tides have switched now and I think killers are on the very brink of being too strong esp with EGC now. I played a game the other day where the door spawns were like 20 feet away and it was a DR with distressing. Even it the chat the DR said it was broken. This bleeds alot into actual issues with the game though like hits that shouldn't connect and that pushes it to look like killers have the upper hand. So I think we cannot objectively say until legit bugs are fixed. I've been screwed over so many times from things connecting when they're 10 feet away that now I take sympathy when I play killer now. If I dont think something was justified I just leave the survivor on the ground (fun fact it actually slows the game doing this because someone will leave a gen to heal them).
---
**I forgot to add in another comment you had. I kind of wish the survivors had unique powers like the killers do so you know what to expect with the person. I think that would add more variety to the game because nowadays it's all just the same builds over and over. Once you have enough hours you can literally guess all 4 perks by how they're playing.**
---
The vast majority of survivors don't last more than 30 seconds in chases against competent killers. You can see evidence of this every day on streams, hours on end. That's enough to say leading chases as a survivor takes skill, because most survivors cannot. And while the argument "they do not know better" doesn't make sense because it would still mean the game is so informationally complex that average people do not even begin to understand it to an extent where they can play approachingly well, and would also mean it takes skill to acquire that knowledge through playing, it doesn't only take knowledge: it takes good mechanical coordination and reactions, quick decision-making, situational awareness, positional awareness, map awareness, and more. That's enough to counter your argument, since you do not back it up with anything but "I get destroyed as killed", which is due to your lack of skill, proven by the fact that other people can destroy as killer.
---
&gt;losing the game to stare at someone and delete their fun
---
That‚Äôs fine, just don‚Äôt get mad when you get genrushed
---
Nice meme, shitty title (pun intended)
---
I've used a grand total of two Mori's.  One Ivory, one Ebony.  For the Ebony, I was called a "no skill trash killer".  I mean, they aren't wrong, but forgive me for wanting to do something different.
---
why did you throw the pallet?
---
I don't think it is 1422 I can work out the math right now:
---
P3 killer: **150 levels**
---
P3 survivor: **150 levels**
---
Sixty-eight survivor perks (as of next patch): **201 levels** considering you have each teachable level 1
---
Sixty-three killer perks (as of next patch): **186 levels** considering you have each teachable level 1
---
Leveling up all survivors to max: **153 levels**
---
Leveling up all killers to max: **144 levels**
---
That is a total of: **984 levels** added with the next content patch (assuming 6 teachables are added)
---
That would be about 40 million bloodpoints worth of levels!
---
Noed=no one escapes death which is a one shot

Always when doing those ghostface rituals, plus the addition of multiple OoOs for extra fun
---
thx bro
---
I didn‚Äôt expect him to land in his own trap
---
I feel u even though i am David main .
---
How does the hatch spawn that early? I call bs on this one. I‚Äôve played about 10 matches and the only problem I‚Äôve had are the camera controls, and on auto haven a wall didn‚Äôt render similar to this screen shot.
---
You are a joke üòÇüòÇ
---
why
---
Its because of anonymity. Im sure if you could punch the toxic asshats in the face or if they had small conquences to their actions, toxicity would drop by 80%.
---
so happy
---
Personally I wouldn't a mind penalty if it was offset by a benefit or perk based. In my mind, there would be just certain effects applied regardless of the penalty Obsession. Something small too.
---
Something like, 5% faster recovery from falls but your vaults over pallets are always fast or slow.
---
Something like that and that particular information would be made available in the Tutorial section and Perk slot so both Killer and Survivor can be aware of it.
---
Just anything to spruce up the mechanic.
---
As both a survivor and killer player I say no thanks to proximity voice chat. I've played F13 abd people use it to equally bully other survivors just as much as Jason.
---
Considering how ragebait this game is, I can't imagine people using voice chat for anything other than trashing mistakes or bad plays.
---
Killing everyone isn‚Äôt winning the game. Surviving isn‚Äôt winning the game. When will people understand this
---
I'm not trying to say you should run Rancor, I'm just saying you don't need to bring a Mori for dailies because Rancor exists, usually isn't too hard to find obsession. Not sure why I'm getting downvotes either, this isn't like a hugely unpopular opinion afaik
---
Thank you for coming by my stream &lt;3 I hope you have been good!
---
russia is in the EU you troglodyte
---
I mean if I forgot that you can open doors who's to say OP didnt forget too? Plus if bill is already on the door it was quicker for him to do that than to down him then manually open the gate
---
It's more like people just don't like awkward self pity.
---
Crying about camping. Survivors are really babies. :^)
---
There is a Q+A in this comment section but it took me about 3k hours of grinding!!
---
It's a bad strategy is what this guy's trying to say. Yeah it's definitely a strat. So is running insid and iron grasp and carrying to the basement and camping it. But eventually people adapt and just avoid so your there camping one person for minutes on end while gens are being done. Don't get me wrong I've had games where I want to tunnel but I don't because where is the fun in that for me. Going after one person over and over again? Eh not my style. Never been my style since I started this game. It's a lot harder to pip just face camping. Soft camping is okay to a point but still harder to pip then just hunting around the map. I don't even use BBQ and Chili. Nor do I run nurse or Billy. I'm a wraith main thru and thru. It's more satisfying to me and others to get a four k by hunting then just getting one. NOED is fine man it's a solid perk and a good perk for killers to run to combat gen rushing. Ya gotta chill man. Just gotta chill dude save your annoyance for SWF.
---
i'm assuming the other person dc'd instantly leaving OP as the only person in the game, thus spawning hatch
---
Yeah I wouldn't say I agree with you 100% but you are pretty on the money with most of your points. I think the problem is the consistency across the game. I mean just look at the items that a low rank can bring vs a high rank. Then you got tier of perks, add-ons for killers... Then just like you said random map rng can fuck you as well. The consistency just isn't good enough to keep the game from being unfun.
---
Honestly i think tunneling is worse than camping.
---
This is on android mobile. 
---
On load in, two people must have quit or DCed. 
---
On log in, the third person saw it was a 2v1 so they DCed, which triggered the hatch to open within 15 seconds of the game starting.
---
The important part is you‚Äôre no longer having fun if you want to act like an asshole.
---
lol I feel foolish. Sorry üòê
---
I don‚Äôt get the mentality, moris are a chance in the gameplay that makes it faster, can‚Äôt the killers have some chance sometimes? And it‚Äôs only one game, maybe it feels bad to get moried 5mins into the game but you can instantly que for the next game so who cares?
---
No. This is console.
---
That's funny, cause when someone calls a killer a tryhard because they lost, I would consider that to be self pity
---
Streaming this game as a hobby/part time job really helps keep me entertained from day to day! 
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Damn didn‚Äôt realize that I feel like an idiot.
---
A term made up by people who always get caught by the killer lol
---
This. 
---
The picture even shows how the third person dced instantly, after realising it was a 2v1.
---
Awesome
---
youre reading too much into it, and being the jackass by karma bombing
---
&gt;Highly unpopular opinion
---
Barely anyone belives this.
---
It's where the killer intentionally goes after a certain survivor even walking past other survivors in their way to still hook the said survivor. It's not fun to play against cause it usually happens to someone early and they get shit bp
---
I'd really like the mechanics around Insidious/Borrowed Time/Decisive Strike to change.
---
I feel like no-TR camping (Insidious, cloaked Wraith, crouched Pig, night shroud Ghostface) should still activate Borrowed Time.
---
But I also feel like the Killer finding a Survivor and chasing them, only for that Survivor to lead them *back* to the hook for a BT-proc is not the intended use of the perk; it rewards the mistake (leading the Killer towards the hook instead of away from it) with a free health state, but doesn't actually do anything against people who camp for kills (because they bring Insidious or a stealth Killer).
---
That's what BT is like, it doesn't punish actual camping tactics (because BT doesn't matter against Leatherface or doesn't activate if you get grabbed), it only punishes based on Terror Radius, and TR-killers don't camp outside of the EGC.
---
No. This picture is from the android app in beta.
---
I believe you confused it with altruistic bonus for Dying Light survivors, in which their altruistic actions increases by 50%
---
Right now I'm rank 6 but I'll get it down to 1 like always when I get more time to play because I'm working a lot. I don't camp or tunnel very often, usually only when someone makes me mad, but I'll defend someone's right to play how they want, especially when it is within the confines of the game. There are a lot of survivor mains who want to dictate how a killer should play, and I think it's ridiculous. The game has perks in it which are designed for a killer to camp or tunnel, like Insidious and Dying Light. When I play survivor, the games are easier when killers camp or tunnel, unless survivors are overly altruistic, which happens way too often, which is why a lot of killers use this strategy. Camping and tunneling won't usually work at red ranks and is usually a sign of a killer being outclassed or new. Again, no one has control over how anyone else plays a video game. If you want to tell people they should use a different strategy that will be more effective, than I encourage that discussion, but shaming people for playing a game like how they want is the hallmark of a salty bitch.
---
Maybe I'm just an idiot, but can anyone explain what 'Atlanta_Back' is refers too? 
---
Most of these seem self-explanatory, and that one kinda sticks out to me.
---
Nurse does really well on Haddonfield too considering she gets to ignore most of the walls/houses
---
Isn‚Äôt that what you‚Äôre supposed to do? If you‚Äôve injured a survivor and other healthy ones are trying to distract you, just walk past them so you can get your hook?
---
His weapon should be a comically sized syringe!
---
I'm glad you enjoy the game as much as I do! Hope to see you in a match some day :)
---
It's ok. The app is I'm beta, but currently, it is basically unplayable as survivor. 
---
I hope this gets some 'publicity' so the app may be improved.
---
Funny, because if you camp and tunnel as much as you say you do in earlier replies, you shouldn't be rank 6. Not even close.
---
lol ok
---
Thanks :)
---
Most likely. Updates are Tuesdays and pbe cycles are 2 weeks. It's been 2 weeks since the pbe.
---
"Pumpkin Spice" Kate as she's known.
---
Are you talking about holding crouch and then sprinting without consuming sprint burst?
---
I didn't really think that was an exploit because it still gives you full exhaustion and it doesn't tick down when you're running, so the Killer doesn't see sprint burst more often.
---
It's good vs. some stuff like Leatherface's instant down, which is incredibly annoying to get hit with given that forcing him to hit terrain isn't a counter.
---
*bufes bubba higher than nurse* ok I think we did it complaining about nurse no more
---
‚ÄúI HATE WHENEVER THE KILLER IS CHASING MY ASS‚Äù 
---
Then dont play survivor
---
So who do you main out of all of them?
---
Facts
---
What would be the point? Voice chat in general has enough cons that if they‚Äôre adding it to balance solo, they should at least not add some limitation.
---
They‚Äôd probably forget a mute button too
---
Shit, I played a SWF yesterday that were ranks 20, 11, 15 and 8.
---
The 8 and 11 were carrying a map and a key (I forget which had which one but it's irrelevant) when I saw the guy with the key I made sure to kill him first. The map had the addons for tracking black locks apparently and they were just walking around the map together looking for the hatch while doing nothing useful.
---
Of course I got fan mail after that game so maybe it was harsh but shit, if you're bringing in an item that circumvents half of the game I'll be removing it asap lol
---
Well she was a Claudette so maybe she was used to being immersed
---
As long as theirs a mute button. I really don't care to talk to random people. Biggest turn off of F13.
---
The main objectives for survivors are so....bland. Just hold M1 and occasionally press space. Completely mindless until you get in chase. Chases are fine until a survivor gets on a no skill infinite loop, or a killer gets a bullshit hit due to the hitboxes. I have no clue how to change any of it, besides maybe hitboxes.
---
You broke rule #873 of the Survivor Rulebook for Killers‚Ñ¢: NEVER chase the survivor. Smh what an asshole killer
---
nurse and spirit should be changed in some ways but appealing to a nerf that largely was built to punish people for playing Legion is the wrong way to do it
---
the fact that the bottom right says ‚Äúace app‚Äù instead of ‚Äúface app‚Äù made it even funnier.
---
You have a fair point there
---
There should be some kind of timer to it at least, Maybe apply it to all characters per totem destroyed, Stackable and last 35 seconds
---
I am a variety killer main meaning I play pretty much every killer (besides hag I don't enjoy her gameplay)
---
I used to be a Billy main however :)
---
Survivor I just play whoever has cakes/streamers :P
---
What about rule 1745# of the Killer Rulebook for Survivors? Dont DC on first down
---
instead of dream pallets, Freddy should get an add-on that lets him spawn 5 of these where ever he wants
---
Interesting. It took me 30 hours to go from 20 to 1 as Survivor and took me 27 to go from 20 to 1 as killer.
---
Note: (I play solo survivor)
---
It‚Äôs not so much etiquette, more aligning with how you can earn mor BP out of a shitty situation and having a little empathy for a hamstrung team. 
---
Everyone wants to have fun and everyone surviving/killing everyone isn‚Äôt the way to win the game from either side. You can be sacrificed and still win your next rank. Killers can not sacrifice anyone and still rank up. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs about.
---
The knees on those jeans have sure held up well.
---
Looks like you got me, 10/10 trolling
---
Not really :)
---
Makes sense! Would you still be for only one survivor at a time being the Obsession with the introduction of more Obsession perks? Or do you still feel that is crucial to the balance of the game?
---
Repost
---
enjoy your 8000 points then cause im gen rushing your ass
---
This is how fred learned to become one with the pallet and get dream pallets.
---
Feel free, I'll get atleast 2 kills because god knows survivors cannot resist going for the save anyway lol
---
There is but it's more of just whiney man-children trying to min-max the game instead of playing for fun. The ranked thing really should be its own game mode or be hidden so people stop caring about it so much
---
There's some things that could be changed to make Solo Survivor feel more like SWF without making things feel unfair.
---
Built in Kindred (Without killer aura reveal) would be one way, as Kindred's main use is to prevent the bystander effect where survivors sit and watch you die on the hook because "Another survivor would have gone for the save". 
---
A "in a chase" indicator or "Hook State" indicator would be other ways. Obsession indicator already moves when the obsession is being chased, so something like the player icon blinking when in the middle of a chase would help indicate when it is safe to go for an unhook, etc. 
---
Hook state indicator would also be nice so it's easier to tell who's on deathhook so maybe it's better to protect them more etc. 
---
There's plenty of ways to improve QOL of solo survivor without giving too much of an advantage.
---
One other idea could be on the lobby screen, you see the other survivors perks, items, and offerings. Other people are bringing BPS? You can too. Few people bringing No Mither for whatever reason? Bring empathy so you can track them at a further range than bond. 
---
As I said I don't see balancing it around SWF as a bad thing if the stuff added is mainly for convenience sake so there's less shit going on like people dying on first hook because everyone thought someone else would go for the save, several survivors bringing map offerings which cancel each other out, etc.
---
Be best for you to blur her name. It's one of the rules.
---
I don't understand how teabagging is supposed to be toxic.  It doesn't hurt or affect gameplay in any way whatsoever, does it?  Am i missing something?
---
Killer Rulebook for survivors? HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Not this, this is a fair play thing. There's a certain exploit that configurations are played with and you can SB willingly, I've seen a couple occasions of this now (first 2 times was confused on this till I researched and saw some people do it on streamers)
---
It should only be one person. You would have to rework a number of perks if there was more than one per trial for no reason, really
---
I feel this way too sometimes which is I go for totems in almost every game. Do you think more interactbles are the answer or maybe dynamic maps?
---
Yea I saw where I messed up, I accidentally added an extra wave of levels on it at some point, your numbers are correct, there's too many perks to try doing it in my head without messing up :(
---
all this has taught me is that I'm sticking with 1 main survivor and a couple killers that I like and not bothering with this much grind lol.
---
it‚Äôs like hearing about the ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt kill people after you immedietly down them‚Äù rule in death garden.
---
like, how many exceptions am i supposed to make for you people?
---
yes really, did you go to geography class ?
---
I hope so. I wish the chat would show the players ingame what was said before the trial ends too. Can't throw the killer a gg if you died first and wanna leave.
---
This legit looks worse than Minecraft.
---
Excuse me?
---
Aw your precious internet points, grow up
---
how to get murdered by noed 101
---
Only if i am portraying them in a negative light which im not. Im just showing how they reacted im not talking down on them
---
Where did you find the stats?
---
I don‚Äôt understand ranks. I started the other week as a rank 20. Is rank one better?
---
You can play spirit too now, so it's okay
---
Good meme
---
Not really I just fixed my post
---
Yes
---
Actually, now it does  [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Decisive\_Strike](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Decisive_Strike)  i started using it short after the changes
---
I bought this game on the promise that I could play a survivor and avoid being murdered in cold blood, or play a murderous psychopath. 
---
I was shocked to see so many people say the killer can‚Äôt just do whatever necessary to kill the survivors.
---
What is ‚Äúnoed?‚Äù
---
We use the original definition of gaming toxic so wrong. It's become a buzz word for flaming. Toxic really means to spread tilted behavior and yes that can include flaming we still use it wrong. Like a good example of toxic is this. Person A DC's and Person B get's upset the game is now 3v1 and also DC's. Person A was toxic because he made person B have a reaction and now tilted Person B. He spread the toxic.
---
No no no no no no no
---
Im already in
---
I personally have had success with the first one. Nurses and Thanatophobia are a deadly combo with them.
---
You hot Myers using cells? These shitty splinters only stop appearing if you buy the whole dlc of the killer
---
I stream about 6 hours every day. I can get 1.5 mill  in under 6 hours if I use double BP offerings but on average 6 hours of playing will yield me 1.5 mill. 
---
Granted these are from playing only killer.
---
You‚Äôve disappointed this Kingdom, this court and The Entity for the last time. Your sentence is Ormond before they fixed the Aura brightness for 1000 games.
---
The community is just toxic. You shouldn't let that get you down though. Look at it as a key to freedom. You're free to play however you want to play without having to worry about upsetting people.
---
Did you buy from the store or auric cells?
---
?
---
How do you even 360 on people. You play on pc or you a controller?
---
Tales tell of a tome.. lost to time in the depths of the entities realm that could dictate the rules of the land. That tome is.. the killer rulebook for survivors. Only the strongest, bravest, most fearsome killer mains can harness the power to retrieve this benign artifact.
---
How do you plan on getting your soul back? 
---
(JK)
---
Yeah he's "Viable" everything can be viable. Is he Optimal? No.
---
Don't follow this. It's a lie!
---
I used cells, yes. Thats annoying.
---
Yes I used cells. I guess you have to buy the full DLC for them to stop appearing. Fucking annoying.
---
If they're salty you have to blur their name to keep people from messaging them  and all
---
Does No Mither still cause panic/injured music to constantly play?
---
Stop assuming everyone is a red-rank looper. That bathroom can be a death trap for potatoes and potatoe adjacents (the majority of us).
---
If I pip I consider it a win if I don't I consider it a loss.
---
the name fits the post
---
There was a Dwight who was t-bagging and clicking his flashlight to get my attention so I chase him, haunted grounds pops he gets insta downed I start t-bagging him back (I‚Äôm playing as ghostface) then I mori him, he then calls me toxic for ‚Äútunneling him.‚Äù
---
Bad pallet throw AND sprint burst? DEFINITELY green ranks.
---
I only teabag my team mates I just run from the killer or avoid him
---
I have never seen this before. Bought all the killers when they came out so didn't even know this was a thing!
---
I don't disagree with this. I was just responding to the specific 4 person SWF thing because it's so uncommon that there isn't anything to draw from to balance around, which is pretty nitpicky of me tbh
---
I think the in a chase status would render some survivor perks kind of useless or essentially nerfed, but that may encourage perk buffs finally which would be nice 
---
Hook state indicator is brilliant. No clue how I never thought of that. Would be useful for killer, too
---
&gt; No Mither
---
I have a fun No Mither story. I was playing Plague once and a Nea and David spawned into my lobby. Then two more Davids spawned in. So I guess Nea decided to join in and switched to David
---
Turns out the three initial Davids were an SWF group and they were No Mither memeing.
---
I was like "okay lol this is not a real game" and decided to just hook em all once or twice and let them leave.
---
So eventually I got the Nea-turned-David on their first hook.
---
And they died first hook.
---
I don't know if the memers just never saved them or if they didn't feel like playing a meme farming game.
---
But yeah the rest of the trial was me puking on these No Mither teabagging Davids and it was hilarious
---
At least twice a game your mom enters while you're masturbating?
---
I have so many questions yet I want none of the answers.
---
A perk, memento mori, it allows the killer to kill you without using the hook
---
Well even if it didn't fall under "shaming other players", it still falls under "oversaturated content", which I learned the hard way. Unlucky for you!
---
It‚Äôs beautiful, I love it. I loved blinking around without the screeching, scaring survivors more. I wish to have the dream again
---
I mean I don't think it's fun winning a game because I didn't regress any gen and then NOED just insta downed everyone for me.
---
The same goes for survivor I don't think it's fun to win letting all my teammates die and rely on Hatch or Door.
---
I feel like it's way more fun and adrenaline inducing with the game actually going on instead of waiting for a Power Spike.
---
That's why I play Spirit, Pig, Nurse.. etc...
---
I think it's truly boring waiting for a Perk or Stacks to do something.
---
But that's just me.
---
I'm sure if I earn enough BP the devs will sell it back to me.
---
You say that, but people say this kind of dumb shit in the DBD community constantly
---
Xbox. Controller. It‚Äôs pretty simple but it doesn‚Äôt have 100% success rate. Just move your Right stick to the right and rotate your left stick counter clockwise. Hope this helps!
---
If i remembered correctly. The first test on ptb was like you can talk to the other survivors after the killer leaved. But only for about 30seconds to a minute before the server closed.
---
His Hallowed Blight outfit is the best.
---
I see everyone talking about ranks all the time but how do you even look at someones rank before the game is over on the scoreboard. Also is a lower rank better?
---
People only think The Game is killer sided because their immersion excursions can‚Äôt work or they played against 72m TR Doctor like two times. Anyone with BL can potato a chase for over 30 sec for both hits. Hell you can keep a solid loop by going to the two pallets above the bathroom, BL to the downstairs and use those two pallets, like....that‚Äôs green rank level stuff.
---
If All Chat is an option I will finally be able to tell the last Survivor on my shoulder to stop wiggling so I can take them to the Hatch.
---
They don't care about killer points though. You're supposed to help them get their survivor points. üòÇ
---
Haha, same here
---
Lol.
---
You forgot the change they made to that rule, that states no hitting.
---
Nobody complains that survivors are toxic just because they got looped. That‚Äôs how the game is and everybody knows that
---
Nice shit post
---
Hey you, yes you who are reading this and are ready to fall for it.
---
Dont!! Go back to r/new and waste your time on some quality shitpost, this is not worth it!
---
And I am out there, proud about my P1 Dwight lmao
---
That‚Äôs also a very good point that I‚Äôd never thought of. I was focusing on all the bad habits but you‚Äôre just like ‚Äúhabits in general of swf makes it boring‚Äù so true. lol like I know exactly when someone‚Äôs ideal time is to do something. So much better when you get to interact with different people every match and really get a feel of the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù in a sense. But yeah swf I play for a few matches and just go ‚Äúwelp see you guy‚Äù 
---
Friend: ‚Äúoh are you getting off?‚Äù 
---
Me: ‚Äúuhh no I just wanna play solo‚Äù it‚Äôs always a bit awkward but I have to use the cliche ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me‚Äù because it really is. Lol
---
Is it hard for you to remember people's names?
---
What rank are you playing at?   
---
Doctor gets absolutely destroyed in higher ranks, his chase potential is garbage, you can block some pallet drops but if survivors know what they're doing they won't let you do it and even if you manage to time it perfectly latency etc may fck you up and even if it doesn't it makes chases super long. Finding survivors is completely useless because survivors don't even hide and it works once per game.
---
I don't give a fuck if I get the hatch but ngl sometimes it makes me salty when the person who did nothing all game gets the hatch . Like fuck that guy he doesn't deserve shit.
---
What about that Mash Camper at the end?
---
Do it agane?
---
Yeah that would be huge.
---
Don't think so, mori his ass.
---
No idea how that works, why camp a survivor that is doing jack shit all game? shouldn't you eliminate the most productive survivor first so that gens stop getting completed as fast?
---
Hopefully Xbox is unaffected.
---
Anyone super good at nurse destroys even the most coordinated swfs. Any killer that can go through walls and end a chase that quickly AND have insane map pressure is OP.
---
You still have to get to Devotion 100/100
---
If you wanted to do a mask for this you could try inverting the colours of the stock mask
---
So you're saying that you matchmake with the same people, remember their names every time, and then tunnel them, because *they're* the salty ones, and not you for allegedly remembering them and tunneling them.
---
I don't care if this removes any chance of stealth. This would be an insta-buy from me
---
Tbh I'm a main survivor and I always hope for a farm after a DC, as well as I have to confess that I am a little disappointed if the killer doesn't farm with us in that case. However I know that a killer is not obligated to do so and I'm not mad either. It's just that there's always the tiniest sliver of hope :D
---
I am proud of you as well &lt;3
---
Now I want to play overwatch and whenever I get this map in competitive I'll say "Is this the hatch? Everyone DC so I can escape please or I'll camp it"
---
Well it‚Äôs not that bad but looping is pretty bad. You can‚Äôt even do the spin thingy to dodge hits
---
Adrenaline kicks in like it never happened lol
---
I really hate how whenever I mention the Legion nerf was too much someone *always* has to say "yeah but he needed a nerf!" as if I'm saying otherwise. It's so annoying
---
She can literally phase through any obstacle she wants and ignore  most mechanics like pallets and vaults. Her ability will always either be Super bad or Super good. She needs a complete rework
---
Practically in the game it's backwards sort of as the best rank is rank 1 and the worst is rank 20 but people call rank 1 a high rank and rank 20 a low rank so practically since there basically is no matchmaking anymore low ranking players that are in rank 20 are now getting matched with high ranking players that are close to rank 1 and stuff ruining the experience for a lot of new players
---
I don‚Äôt really mind it not showing what the game‚Äôs actually like. It‚Äôs more about just seeing some nice animation in the form of dbd more than anything.
---
No, I don't think I will
---
Honestly, that's not too bad for MM considering the level 9 could be SWF with the other lvl 19, and 16 isn't too off. I've seen way worse (rank 7 killer vs fully sub-16 survivors)
---
I think you mean  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/new/)  as r/new is a sub and is banned.
---
Did you mean sort by new?
---
...Awkkkward.
---
I think that Walter would be the choice for the killer, since he's a serial killer. Eileen is just related to him... Not that killers are ever related to survivors in dbd thoüôÑ
---
The ‚Äúunknown reason‚Äù is it‚Äôs this way in every darn video game that features skins - and it works.
---
See you in 3 years :)
---
Yeah it's super difficult to do especially since the max sensitivity isn't even that high
---
Fifteen so far. Lmao
---
I had that happen once with Dying Light. the OG obsession was an Ash Williams with the classic "Meta Of Man" build (MoM + Dead Hard + Decisive + Deliverance with instaheal) and thankfully a baby Laurie hit her level 1 DS and I was then able to Mori her.
---
Meanwhile I wanna prestige my Hillbilly to P3 but don't wanna grind the 80 bloodwebs it took for T3 Endfury again...
---
Of course she is.
---
The fact remains The Game has the lowest survival rate based on date that bhvr released. And from my own experience and a lot of other player‚Äôs experience it is the worst map for Survivors. Period. 
---
Also not everyone brings BL. On some maps it‚Äôs a waste. I run Lithe instead.
---
Where do you see general stats? Is that new?
---
Well I die every match to a legion anyways, screw it
---
I think thats the Struggle action, its bound to SPACE.
---
I actually really like that map as a survivor and try to do the one in the house within the first two gens. People forget that if the killer has the high ground they can watch several gens in that area and keep it locked down.
---
Sorry I was reading the outdated one, yeah you must be talking about rule B-12#2
---
I've also learned that there is a comic series with even more lore out there, haven't had time to check those out yet but from what i've heared it's not bad either.
---
:)
---
*chuckles* I'm in danger
---
gen times are too fast? Here is Freddy who's power completely slows all actions (ignore how bad he is in general). Still too fast? here's surveillance. Still too fast? Here's Pop Goes the Weasel. Still too fast? Here's Haunted Ground to help your Ruin from getting destroyed quickly. Still too fast? Here's Discordance. Still too fast? Here's Corrupt Intervention. Still too fast? We made Pop and Surveillance actually good. Still too fast? Here's Thrilling Tremors.
---
Maybe eventually the community will stop complaining about gen times if we throw more perks at it!
---
Bill can wait, i'm okay with being able to play new freddy
---
Not bugging me at all. This is like one of very few games I play, and I really like it so talking about balance is very enjoyable 
---
There's no reason for them to be more powerful than non-obsession perks. They just need to be decent. And most perks in general aren't
---
idk why you got downvoted. It's legit the killers job to put pressure on them
---
what ever happened to claudette
---
Yea, I wish this community would show them more backlash for things like this and maybe not buy skins, etc. So they will listen.
---
Killers got rulebooks for survivors too though...
---
I would say if you ever think you are going to want to prestige to do it as soon as possible! Once you are at prestige 3 you will never have to level up for certain perks again!
---
I had two people DC yesterday at the beginning of the match. The LF proceeded to tunnel me around the game (map), I literally used every pallet on the game before he downed me. The one other survivor did FOUR fucking gens. He was on of those LFs that only use his chainsaw so it was pretty easy to loop him for a long time (balanced landing also helped a lot). He then camped me while hitting me on the hook as if he actually accomplished something. Luckily the other survivor did the last gen while I was being camped then noped out of there. I would‚Äôve been even more pissed if he got us both. He then messaged me after the match and said ‚Äúgg ez toxic survivor get reked.‚Äù
---
Sweet fuck man I only just got my second p2 character after having the game for a year how much do you play my man
---
the traps wont work if you put them on after the last gen gets finished. It was a nerf regarding the pig. You have to put them on while at least one gen is still there
---
n-no shes totally fine and extremely fair and balanced behavior plz dont nerf my girl
---
I use [https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard.php](https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard.php) 
---
It is a 3rd party DBD leaderboard that uses your steam achievements to track various stats about the game.
---
This is actually a nice idea and it also helps with the survival bp category being painful to fill!
---
No I said survivors plural as in when the 4 survivors ur against keep rushing hooks and ignoring gens, you can camp and they usually will either hesitate to do gens or will keep trying to hook rush you.
---
well the second one could escape bc it wasn‚Äôt active, the first one i would chalk up to a bug maybe? i know there was a bug before her change that made that happen.
---
Trap on the far left is red as if the timer was ticking.
---
Unfortunately or fortunately (I can‚Äòt tell) there is no post chat box on consoles. Regarding my mental health I blocked PSN messages.
---
I think I'm just gonna pass out again
---
I like the map, too. Though I noticed it usually spawns two or three gens right outside the house, without much cover.  I think they often fall a little too close together.
---
With how many people think they‚Äôre the absolute best at this game and never make mistakes you would here some weird shit like ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you using the pallet??‚Äù While you‚Äôre looping the killer. Lmao
---
I remember when you hadn't really touched your survivors and started survivor sunday, congrats
---
I put about 6 hours into the game a day while I stream it! It has been about 1.5 years of playing at least 6 hours a day.
---
The trapper is weaker than some other killers but he isn't the worst in the game so I have no idea why all of a sudden he needs to be buffed. Leatherface should be prioritized over Trapper. Also, billy, nurse, and spirit are bad examples for where killers should be. They are god tier.
---
For the ad revenue, obviously. /s
---
for survivor i suggest meg to unlock sprint burst and adrenaline as teachable, for killer i suggest a simple m1 killer like trapper to learn the basics. legion is also surprisingly a good killer to learn how to play killer with.
---
That's lame
---
I like how he works now, even if it is a bit weak just some add ons that work, that are made for him, and some ultra rares
---
seriously the muffler makes 0 sense on leather cause he's not going cross map with his chainsaw
---
You're boosted fam
---
Bc unless ur massively far behind them you won't break LOS long enough to cancel the chase which will maintain Bloodlust and the entity blocker
---
Dear God I wish I had your level of commitment to literally anything in my life
---
&gt; Deathgarden is even easier to win than Dead by Daylight due to shared blood resources, but the thing is, it also needs more second chances (or did when I played it).
---
I haven't played deathgarden super extensively like DBD, but from my experience the Killer feels like a super nurse. In the right hands, its unstoppable, but in newb hands, its a joke. Its like if its "too skill based".
---
&gt; Deathgarden lets you hop on a Scavenger and instant-down them with a shotgun blast + shock and then unless they get hit by a heal bolt immediately, you can instantly execute them. (Though Scavengers can just be invisible in bushes and wait out the match, or perma-cloak, so I'm not saying Deathgarden is necessarily Hunter-sided).
---
I agree and this is a big one for me. In DBD unless the killer is a total tunneler, you generally have 2-3 chances. It sucks to have a single one in deathgarden.
---
&gt; In DbD there are too many second chances and survivors can stay up way too long for a game balanced around four survivors on separate generators popping them in 80 seconds.
---
I actually like the seconds chances, but you could easily argue 80 seconds is too short especially with the use of toolbox which turns this into 55 seconds.
---
Oh. It could've fooled me from personal experiences.
---
They're only mirrors because they activate in the endgame. A mirror of noed would be if survivors would get some strong, game changing benefit when they end up failing their objective.
---
Funnily enough I didn't stick with Survivor Sunday long. I am just too much of a killer main :p
---
Thank you for stopping by my stream and thanks for the congrats &lt;3
---
at first i was disappointed with the rework but now i'm pretty hyped and i can't wait to play with my new toy
---
Is there a way to go back in killer and survivor rank? As I've played more and more its put me against people that are way out of my skill level and it's making the game very hard to enjoy for me. I have to camp hooks to get kills at this point and I hate having to play so toxic
---
looks better than Roblox
---
While I definitely can see the issue I think that‚Äôs where having someone willing and able to take the killer on a chase allows the rest of the group to knock them out.
---
That‚Äôs true- to an extent. There was this one guy playing Jason who just played Freddy Krueger lines over the mic, which was pretty fucking funny.
---
the first should be "at the Start of the game" or noed would be way too strong.
---
The Second should be in %
---
&gt;I believe in you &lt;3
---
LF is also a killer that needs a buff i agree with you. That doesn't mean trapper doesn't need one.
---
My point is Killers should be BALANCED. So either nurse needs a nerf, or trapper needs a buff, but clearly one is much stronger than the other.
---
He's got his notes here and they say bloodletting is definitely very effective and safe
---
Thanks I don't
---
it resets, the debuff will be removed and the killer will have to kill the new obsession to get the effect again
---
I feel so valid
---
hey she asked u to don‚Äôt reply me back i can‚Äôt believe u reply me back!!!!!
---
They‚Äôre probably gonna do that map too
---
Why did they ban that Pizza? And how was it talking?
---
definitley a bug or hatch, but you said hatch wasnt Open, so...
---
Watching that movie it didn‚Äôt even seem like a parody of evil dead.
---
Thanks for clearing my doubts :)!
---
This would close the gap between solo and swf and hopefully make future balance patches better!
---
I'd prefer people stick to Myers quotes.
---
Was DBD out back then?
---
Rule 777: If the Doctor is played on Gideon Meat Plant we're allowed to disconnect.
---
What cosmetics did you buy and are you ready for the questing grind
---
oh you mean confirmation bias
---
I think im like rank 16 but why look at peoples ranks like that if you cant even change how they get matched together or anything. This is just another thing to complain about to say the game isn‚Äôt working correctly when you get get killed and look and someone was a better rank than you so the game must be broken or something. I dont see the point in any of this just play the game and we‚Äôll never be able to group ranks ourselves unless you‚Äôre playing on chosen teams and not random.
---
I think if a character is extremely hard to play but really powerful in the right hands, then they are in a pretty good spot. So long as the average player isn‚Äôt capable of destroying most of the time. I think high skill killers should have more benefits, and nurse fits that criteria for me.
---
I'll never understand the hate against tunneling. Sure it sucks for the survivor, but why would I go for a different person instead of getting Dwight on that death hook. If both take as much time, I'm gonna go for the one that leaves 3 survivors left instead of 4.
---
I won't hardcore tunnel, but if I see 2 survivors next to each other, I'm gonna go for the one I've already hooked.
---
Need legion cosplay skins
---
Missing Pages would be nuts on Impossible Skillcheck Doctor.
---
Lol don‚Äôt you know the rules? save it for when the survivors are using the same joke against killer. Here you will get downvotes and there you will get upvotes. How does it make sense you might ask sense everyone is in the same sub? Good question I have no fucking clue.
---
i have, thank you üíó i've been meaning to stop by, i'll have to do that soon \^.\^
---
Red rank here and I get dcs in my games daily and for every petty reason you can list.  I would even say dcing is more frequent as you climb.
---
Lol!  Don't chase me bro!  That's a new one for the entitlement handbook.
---
Bro ur getting reported for replying
---
Yeah i know how buggy and dumb the game often is. Im a devotion 1 and ive seen so many bugs already
---
&gt;As both a survivor and killer player I say no thanks to proximity voice chat. I've played F13 and people use it to equally trash other survivors just as much as Jason.
---
&gt;Considering how ragebait this game is, I can't imagine people using voice chat for anything other than trashing mistakes or bad plays.
---
I always agreed that people would use voice coms on DBD to troll / flame others but I still think the feature *could* (not saying it should) be present **WITH the option to disable it**.
---
Those that have a thick skin can enjoy messing around with possible trolls or potentially make good use of this tool and those that don't want to be part of it, can disable it.
---
Just like post-game chat, I personally would enable it from time to time just to see what is going on.
---
i try not to "tunnel" or play campy but as soon as the teabagging begins all bet's are off
---
Console player btw
---
Source?
---
I have seen demonstrated in several other live streamers, youtubers. You are obviously bias here as well because you are pushing a narrative that doesn't happen based on jackshit. It does happen and it happens a lot.
---
Oh

I haven‚Äôt really gotten any splinters nor the Black Splinter (I don‚Äôt have Halloween)

Thanks, I hate it!
---
I'm hoping the Archives that are coming in the next few months will add in something more to grind! Until then I will just farm add ons :)
---
Maybe it didnt look like hatch was open since it was the 2 of them. He uses a key to escape n when the hatch icon pops up it looked like it because theres one left.
---
They are supposed to appear for killers you DONT have so you have a chance to try them before buying them but i have the killers and get them anyway
---
Sneak peak?
---
You guys know that huntress has the mental age of a 4 year old right.
---
Laughs in iron grasp
---
it's frustrating especially with the splinters if you don't have all the killers...it would be nice to try a diff. one out and getting a splinter with a killer you already have is a pain..good luck
---
Between all the bs hoops devs have to jump through for Sony and having gone through four controllers because they all get some defect within 6 months I will not be getting a ps5.

---
You should've had Ochido run to DBD mobile
---
Heavily agree. At least the comics were awesome.
---
Me too
---
I should masturbate less
---
The point of the traps is to slow the game down, take a survivor out of the game for a bit and make them search boxes instead of doing gens, going for unhooks, etc. 
---
Honestly even when end game piggy worked it was still gimmicky as hell and wasn‚Äôt the best way to play pig
---
I've tried a few but I couldn't get one I really liked :,c
---
Why would I get fat?
---
Should've brought no Mither
---
Bread makes you fat
---
Its not an issue as i have every killer except Freddy.  It is just annoying at this point to have to spend 7000 bloodpoints for no reason to move onto the next bloodweb
---
A chance to do what? What are you going to do as the last one left if you unhook yourself? Especially if the hatch has been closed. Enlighten me as to what master plan you can make at this point that doesn't involve wasting the killer's time running around stuff.
---
I think they were memeing, could be wrong but I get a lot of the stupid/fake hate comments
---
Like someone sending me Ahhhg you got my shoes bloody, or You asshole that gen was my baby, or just Hate Mail in all caps though that one maybe me laugh
---
Oh wow! Interesting. Now I know
---
What‚Äôs the bug?
---
Lol ok. Well you're just objectively wrong then. You have to be pretty delusional to think they would purposely nerf something so hard in spite of people that paid money for their DLC. If anything, a scumbag company would make DLC killers OP as hell to make more money. No company is going to purposely shit on their DLC characters so nobody wants to buy it.
---
I dont think they were memeing because they DCd mere minutes into the game
---
Definitely dynamic maps. More interactive stuff would just be more holding M1 most likely. Dynamic maps could integrate more art styles
---
And it keeps happening I don't know how
---
I pulled a Quentin out of a locker yesterday. I never want that to happen again.
---
I know and honestly I am just memeing when I bitch about Badham being reworked over Haddonfield. I honestly was okay with the map but it did have its problems and I'm glad to see it changed.
---
Bread makes you fat‚ÄΩ
---
Oh boy... Haha
---
:(((((((
---
Awwr lame, I love these kind of memes, but its sad to see real players like this xD
---
You act as if being the last one makes it impossible to escape. It's definitely hard yeah, but to help you get away there are perks like ds and dead hard, and to help you hide there are other perks. It's pretty obvious that getting hooked doesn't equal instant loss
---
Thank you! I think DS just last a little to long. I don't think getting punished because the survivor didn't heal up and ended up running into me or the survivor did something on purpose just so he could stun me for 5 seconds.
---
almost looks like a "Crusader" GF
---
Man chowder was my shit me and my lil sis loved it
---
ahh I see your point. that makes a lot of sense now as I look at your post again
---
I have about 70% of both survivor and killers to P3 50, but only 3 survivors are fully maxed out. I‚Äôm focusing on killers only now, since the survivors I really play are maxed. I‚Äôm slowly getting there, but I‚Äôm amazed how far I‚Äôve gotten :D
---
She is pretty well balanced, People need to practice a lot to master her in order to be that OP nurse. 
---
High Skill Killer which normally survs don't get the practice or skill that its needed to fullfil her.
---
Am I missing something?
---
This happened to me last week as Ghostface in meat locker. After the survivors cleared ruin and mostly finished 3 gens someone let me grab them.
---
Maybe instead of making perks around the issue they'll actually fix the issue in the first place.
---
Fun fact: there are two total Killers who don't have perks which interact with generators in some way, being Wraith and Leatherface.
---

Also I 100% agree with who you play lol, the Hag feels just to slow for me
---
People don‚Äôt understand that people are just gonna yeet on first hook. Only about 10 seconds
---
Its crouching in a video game, dont let it bother you.
---
Proud of you! You will get to 100% in no time! &lt;3
---
I like this, but it would render blood warden kinda redundant.
---
Dont rush to rank up, it just gets worse
---
sik
---
One, no need to be hostile :D. I guess a better way to say it is both sides have op stuff, which feels like in this community equates to toxic. Survivors have adrenaline or DS or gen speeds that feel unfair, unfun, and toxic for killers. Killers that tunnel and camps or perks like bbq feel unfun, unfair, and "toxic" for survivors. Also relax, not  struggling or complaning. My comment was to just point out that thinking there arent toxic aspects to the game is just delusional.
---
PS4 LUL
---
You are able to use SB on command, mid chase, while you're running, kinda like how Dead Hard works but it's not like a button press. 
---
I never use SB so I honestly don't know how the exploit works.
---
I get WHY the skin costs more since the drill sounds unique apparently, but adding juuuust that little extra is scummy
---
Rank 20 is gonna be the new rank 1
---
I‚Äôm gonna make sure I do this to people.

List? I don‚Äôt know.
---
From free (special edition) characters.
---
Ace
---
David
---
Feng
---
And others if there are any
---
I was until I found out bill isn‚Äôt coming, they had to fuck something up.
---
I wasn't too sure whether to make it only start of game or not, but yeah, it probably would be better that way
---
It‚Äôs not the killer‚Äôs job to be friendly. I‚Äôm a survivor main but I meet so many toxic killers. If someone dc‚Äôs i just expect everyone to die or dc. However, when I‚Äôm killer if someone dcs i usually just let 1 or 2 go but not everyone. ‚ÄúWhat er ya doin in me fog‚Äù if you don‚Äôt want to die a little xD
---
40 of the games mechanics is standing still holding a button
---
it's true tho
---
That sounds like a good idea!
---
What?! Noooo!
---
It still works in seconds. Rank 3 max stacks would be 30sec which is reasonable I think. Potentially a little longer.
---
Please be more specific with an example because your argument seems pretty good but I‚Äôm a bit confused by what your evidence means. Like go into more detail on the skill of the swf
---
I just realized who posted this LOL i like watching your stream. As a survivor main i‚Äôve learned a lot on how to play as killer from watching you. I remember asking you if you can play Myers haha. Congrats man. Hope i get there one day
---
I really wanna get into this game but I feel like I missed the boat. Like anyone who plays it now is automatically better than me. And when I do dumb noob shit they're all gonna yell at me.
---
Wait this isn‚Äôt r/overwatch
---
You lose all of your perks, items, add-ons and offerings and have to start back from Level 1, but you'll get a slightly increased chance of finding rarer items in the bloodweb and you'll get one cosmetic which is a bloody version of the character's default outfit. Each prestige will net you another piece of clothing (Bloody torso --&gt; bloody legs --&gt; bloody head) and further increased chance of finding rarer stuff.
---
Do a barrel roll!
---
because that's the only way they make money
---
1. Why do people working on gens sometimes stand for 10 seconds and then continue working again?
---
2. Why do hillbillies stop their chainsaw the moment they‚Äôre supposed to hit a surv so a basic dead hard can save you?
---
i'm personally against voice chat but if they add it, it would close the gap between solo players and SWF which would allow them to buff killers more fearlessly. Right now a big reason they shy away from killer buffs is because they don't want solo queue survivor to be even worse
---
Forgot the shitpost flair
---
Stopped making the new ones*.
---
I'd personally completly remove it from the game but your idea is better than what it currently is, so +1
---
Not hostile at all it gets old hearing people bitch about everything in this game that makes them mad. Or that they deem ‚Äúunfair‚Äù it‚Äôs not unfair you‚Äôre just unhappy with it because it made the game harder for you. Plain and simple
---
gesture 3 to dab oh boy
---
I totally disagree with you, i think red moris are broken and if you lose with a red mori its because you got completly dominated.
---
It normally isn‚Äôt, due to the fact that keeping after one person the whole game gets old for a killer, and face camping is just boring as all hell, same with some normal camping, it‚Äôs usually just done due to salt, just try to have fun
---
I played Jason with [this song](https://youtu.be/_eQQKVKjifQ) blasting through my mic. The survivors said they were so fucking terrified haha
---
That's a nice interrobang right there.
---
Also I wasn't expecting a Scott Pilgrim reference, seeing one here made my heard beat faster, just a little bit faster.
---
It‚Äôs not improved chance of getting rare things, more of a lesser chance of getting common things. You get less brown and more green/yellow addons. Purple and pink stay the same.
---
oh my god, I love this LOL. The pig is adorable xD
---
[Recently this is the post game chat that makes me laugh the most.](https://imgur.com/a/UkLu5qt) For context 3 gens were done and people proceeded to keep running at the hook and not doing gens so I just stood at the hook and the other 3 survivors looked at me standing with the hooked guy until he died. 
---
I proceeded to 4k :)
---
I try to play as fair as I can and for the fun of all (one of my big things is I NEVER use ruin except for meme builds) but if people are going to play stupid then I will take advantage of it!
---
Also good work on your prestiges! I hope to see you sometime in game :)
---
lmfao the thumbnail
---
Yeah he shouldn't have a chainsaw. He should have three that he juggles around passively then throws them like huntress hatchets. They don't insta kill tho, just inflict mangled and deep wound.
---
It has become an addiction now. If I uninstall it will be back on my computer by the end of the day :(

PIG?
---
Oh it‚Äôs upvote time.
---
Ash! I leveled all the killers first and then moved onto survivor and just went down the list and only recently finished it!
---
Well it‚Äôs because of the genre. People did this with call of duty and battlefield. They‚Äôre currently doing it win apex and fortnite, even though I guess it‚Äôs a dead meme at this point. On a surface level I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre just being shitheads and hurr durr trolling. Peeling back the layers I‚Äôd take a few guesses to say they‚Äôre not that great at the game? They might have gotten shit on and instead of learning from the experience they uninstalled and never looked back. My second guess is that because they know it‚Äôs also an asymmetrical horror game they hear the other game get brought up and their caveman-like instincts kick in followed by a harsh scowl and full unibrow. They can not comprehend what they feel but they know they want to act on it and they must use the most insulting words they know to hurl at the opposition. and they don‚Äôt understand how they feel but I‚Äôm guessing they feel as if their use of time is being questioned because there‚Äôs an even more successful game of the same genre and they‚Äôre frustrated that their community is dying. Frustrated that‚Äôs it‚Äôs dying and they‚Äôre running out of solo players and noobs to pick on. Hope this helped. Lol
---
When everyone died and you are about to die on hook but you see that the baby Dwight that you were protecting for the entire match managed to open the gate and just escaped.
---
She has a lot of counter play, remember where she placed traps, activate them later. Just like freddy dream pallets but more deadly because she can mind game with her traps.
---
Good idea your going to need a lot of energy for what comes next
---
There are a bunch of people who hate being chased in general and I have no idea why they play the game
---
For Licensed they were. Quen. to Freddy, and Lori to Myers. However, I guess survivor's were all innocent in nature. Walter was evil, and Even James was as well. You can make a case for Heather, but she is literately the good half of a single person. So I guess Eileen would be a good choice, but from that argument Mary could of been the survivor.
---
That‚Äôs how this sub works though lol
---
Don‚Äôt you know if a surv fucks up it‚Äôs because you were being a bad killer? Let me explain the mentality of the unfortunately very common *Toxicus *surivorus
---
If you get a kill you suck. If you get a hit you suck. If you win a loop you suck. If you use perks you suck. If you win a mindgame you suck.
---
And of course there‚Äôs the other side
---
If you don‚Äôt get a kill you suck. If you miss you suck. If you loose a loop you suck. If you loose a mindgame you suck.
---
Bottom line: you suck. Anything you do is either you sucking and failing or you going try hard and winning because you suck so bad.
---
MaA?
---
If anyone says no, they are either really bad at nurse or play on console. A good nurse has next to zero counterplay.
---
Nooo, that‚Äôs the only part of the patch I was actually looking forward to :(
---
Monitor and abuse, a docs perk
---
And I just wondered why it wasn't an issue for anybody when the first two movies were released. They grossed well and build a fanbase. They were also putting money in his pocket, but it was okay back then?
---
But then this conversation went all the wrong way.
---
With tenacity you get to move a little bit. Try it. Trust
---
Garlic bread is good and all but BBQ and Chili is disgusting.
---
Every character can throw their primary weapon at the cost of needing to go retrieve it. If they don't retrieve it they just run around 5% faster than normal just trying to punch the survivors to death, taking 2 punches to bring down one health state
---
Wow what a unique perspective.
---
Currently I have close to 0 iri shards. I would use shards as BP boosts since I already have all teachables.
---
The Shrine isn't a great way to get BP but it is a nice little boost. I have probably spent well over 100k shards on the shrine. Which translates to 7.5 million BP.
---
I also spent around 462 million BP to get to this point that I grinded by playing the game!
---
r/puns
---
The problem is its super easy to use it on accident. It constantly happens to me and i'm not even 100% how i trigger it. But it also fucks me up a good % of the time where it won't trigger when i need it lol
---
What does it do?
---
At rank 1 there is plenty of good nurses that just fucking ruin the night if you run into too many. Even mediocre ones just use 3 blinks or omegablink and then it's still just as bullshit.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a licensed chapter, that just means they altered their deal to get specific cosmetics
---
link?
---
after watching the entire video, I would say bad connection.
---
8m is Myers terror radius. That pretty much explained that to me.
---
Thank you for watching my stream! You are always welcome in my stream and if you have any questions or want to see any killer played always feel free to come by.
---
Thank you for the support &lt;3
---
During the christmas event with the mystery boxes i got 9 pig splinters despite being a pig main at the time
---
Oh yea, you‚Äôre right
---
Is there any way to contact BHVR to ask a question? I know they sometimes pop into various threads on the sub to answer questions or offer updates.
---
I would like to know if there are any planned changes to Nurse to improve game health at red ranks, because right now every Nurse game is a fucking miserable experience.
---
Maybe you just skipped the middle part of my response, but that's the part where I tell you Bamboozle saves time. The same way Enduring Spirit Fury lets me swing through a pallet and remove it instantly. Saves me the time of a stun and pallet break.
---
nah hag is where it's at
---
One use as long as you use it fully. Might 99.99% and wait for survivors unless you are sure the killer is coming.
---
Okay, so, everyone else is dead. The hatch is closed. You get caught with neither gates close to being open. With all that said and done, you unhook yourself, and obviously the killer only has one place to go. 
---
And you really think Dead Hard and DS is all you need to successfully escape at this point? Like, I'm really starting to think you don't understand the usual situation if you're the last one alive and just want to waste more of the killer's time.
---
That's my experience as well. People can't shrug off losses and there are just as many sore winners as sore losers.
---
*"It almost makes eternal dying worth while"*
---
THIS IS SO FUNNY LMAO
---
You forgot the shitpost flair
---
Ive gotten games where people didn‚Äôt help me off the hook but for almost all of them people have helped me pretty much down till i got no chances left . get your perks set up right and you should be able to keep your distance from the killer for most of the game until you gotta go in and save someone yourself. I have to say  though I have a different experience than you because everyone i survive with in this game has been really helpful and will come back in even with the gate open to try and grab me one last time. It took me like a week of playing this game every day to really feel confident in escaping people and stuff though.
---
Yep
---
No flair.
---
Who said it was shitpost?
---
Ive been using it and thought it was just an op feature lol. Well... This games busted
---
Nope. If they get to it with a key when it's closed, they're escaping.
---
For all of your huntress "plot" needs
---
I know
---
Hard to play != Balanced, and I use the word 'hard' *very* loosely. Assuming you already understand the fundamentals of the game, it'll take you an afternoon of playing Nurse before you get the muscle memory down.
---
She's without a doubt broken. Survivors only have one real way to stay alive, looping, and Nurse completely negates that. That makes her OP to an extent, but it's also a huge design flaw within the game itself.
---
Bricky made some really good points on nurse in [this video](https://youtu.be/KayVcAi9_tE). [9:30 is when he starts talking about the balancing issues.]
---
Companies over-nerf things all the time. You're massively out of touch if you don't know that. Just like they over-buff things too. It's got a lot to do with a lot of developers not playing at a high level so they don't really know. They will probably buff Legion eventually, but Behaviour works pretty slow since they are a small independent company.
---
There certainly is quite a bit of meta in this game and it can be daunting. I would suggest watching some streams/youtube videos and that will definitely help you learn the game in a non stressful environment. Whether it be [my stream](https://www.twitch.tv/trickstershadow) or anyone else; the DBD Twitch community is a great place to learn :)
---
They did
---
They tried to pull some of that off with Backwater/The Game. It works but isn‚Äôt real game changing and doesn‚Äôt motivate you to do the specific gen to activate it, other than doing the gen. I think destruction by walking over/ running over would be nice. Just don‚Äôt know how DBDS engine would handle it
---
sweat
---
that's Jeff
---
Ruin can get removed but Thanatos phobia can‚Äôt, in most games as killer it will get cleansed in 1-2 mins and at higher rank people can hit great skill checks and it doesn‚Äôt matter much. I use ruin and even at rank 12 it‚Äôs not that good.
---
Well nurse need a nerve she cant be countered and this Guy makes a buff request ?!
---
noice try
---
I‚Äôm guilty of a ‚Äúdang you could have taken it easy on us‚Äù message.   I‚Äôm sorry reddit. I‚Äôve failed you. I‚Äôll do better.
---
&gt; They will probably buff Legion eventually
---
i need you to pinky promise :(
---
It's not about the usual. It's about the possible plays overall
---
White is easier to see I only kill you based on looks if you wear bloody cloths

This is extra funny since this is one of the first scenes in the movie

---
You realise this is a *Microsoft* problem, right?
---
Microsoft likely has lifetime console exclusivity for L4D and all related content.
---
Thank you
---
Did you pay real money for the characters or did you but them with shards?
---
Oh the shrine of secrets is OPs bitch for a long time already, everything you have to do for this is to get every char to 40. I agree however on the entity part since 50 is when the fun really starts.
---
What‚Äôs your secret?
---
you've cracked the code
---
Can confirm. I hover around ranks 10-12 due to lack of time to really play and just getting fed up with teammates doing stupid shit. It feels like there‚Äôs always at least one afk for the first three to five minutes of the game. Oddly enough most killers won‚Äôt bother with AFK survivors. 
---
There‚Äôs that or players who DC at first down. I didn‚Äôt realize that was a legit strat to climb ranks. It‚Äôs pretty frustrating trying to play with a handicap like that.
---
I get that, but it's just as plausible to want to use both knife addons back with the Legion exploit. Obviously not as random, but there's no coincidence that Wake Up and SB suddenly started getting used all the time when the exploits come up... people know what they're doing and Behaviour didn't throw a warning that they would ban over it like they did with Legion.
---
rip Claud
---
Love me some garlic bread and spaghetti.
---
That's some unfun shit that makes me smile.
---
Pig main btw
---
As soon as every content patch drops I instantly buy it. 
---
I play enough where I could just earn the non licensed content with shards but I would rather get my hands on the new content as soon as possible.
---
Yep, scroll down to the very bottom. It was announced like two weeks ago 
---
tbh console nurse is as destructive as pc nurse but not many people bother to learn her in console
---
In leveling up everyone?

I have no life.

I agree withe the sentiment and I tend to do the same while playing killer, but I would never demand that of someone nor would it ruin my day to lose a match because the killer played seriously after a DC. As you said, it's just a game, I really don't mind dying.
---
just a 'lil' bit
---
made with memeatic
---
Nurse is still destructive in console but whatever
---
Yep, neither do I
---
Yep, when they announced his rework they confirmed his release date (which is tomorrow). Scroll down to the very bottom 
---
Any individual, not just women
---
Do you have a source? Not that I don't believe you, but I was wondering if somebody did a test on it or something.

---
These edibles are hitting different.
---
I wish I could lol, Legion is fun to me. But they really do work so slowly. Freddy took forever to get his buffs.
---
Lol, that's pretty much the mentality of em. Pretty gross. They think killers are bitches for crying for survivor nerfs. That the game is killer favored and the devs are biased towards killers.
---
Devs were biased towards killers when releasing DS and Mettle of Moron.
---
Also biased when putting 30+ pallets on every map with vacuums to ensure the killer never hit a single survivor.
---
It's killer favored that buildings used to have multiple windows on them without entity blocks. 
---
It's also killer favored that killers didn't used to have the power to damage gens. 
---
It was all that killer bitching that got Mettle of Man and DS nerfed. Two pErFEctLY BaLAnCed perks ruined by killers running to devs for UnEedeD NErfS.
---
Survivor mains are probably still mad that their precious Exhaustion perks don't have the original 20 second cooldown at rank 3. That recovered while running. And that each Exhaustion perk had a separate cooldowns. Or that hooks don't have permanent sabotage anymore.
---
Microsoft has not bought valve yet that I know of.
---
That puts my micheal myers mani peti painting to shame
---
Cute
---
Hag fingers are longer than the spirits sword.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs very common but I did have at least 2 survivors get super pissed at me for using it. It‚Äôs more of a minority of toxic survivors than anything.
---
Hmm. I don't usually care too much if my totems are broken unless I'm running NOED. And if they've broken all the totems to disable NOED, I consider the time spent looking for each one worth losing a perk.
---
Well, Frederick was a full re-work so that's not surprising. I unfortunately forgot about it and didn't put enough bp into him the past couple weeks
---
Yuss
---
So? All art is amazing. Doesn't matter how good it is, as long as it shows the enthusiasm the artist has for the subject makes it instantly awesome!
---
Can't wait for ends more then kills and see how Myers And Laurie's story will end
---
yes I see the problem. I'm not defending BHVR on this, I agree that their design philosophy of throwing perks at problems in hopes of fixing them doesn't work
---
Nurse needs a nerf. That is general consensus from survivors and killers
---
ebony moris are not fine
---
Sooo how many hours do you think you spend in the bloodweb?
---
Run one way then run the other in various intervals
---
Immersed scardey cat.. I mean Dwight, listening to My Little Pony soundtrack from a locker
---
I mean they really dont show up often at all though, and even when they do I just play safer and I'm fine lmao
---
You heard it in time though
---
You can easily learn loops by just watching others then instantly replicate it. I‚Äôm not the only one who struggles as a killer. Instant heals are just button presses. Throwing down a pallet when a killer gets near you and running to the next one is a matter of using 2 buttons and an analog stick. You say vast majority but where are you getting that info from since personal experience does not count here. Map knowledge is easily acquired by walking by a pallet and saying hmm I‚Äôll just run around this and stall till so gens get done. Skillchecks are just practice which is by no means skill. There‚Äôs also several get out of jail free cards as survivor ie instantheals, adrenaline, decisive, dead hard, pallets, flashlights, and your teammates body blocking and or saving you. The killer can‚Äôt compete with all of that.
---
Yeah but I was already pressing the button before I realized that he stepped in his own trap
---
Exactly it's pretty stupid that if you like rushed down 4 gens and escaped you wouldn't pip just cause you didn't get an unhook or two.
---
This community is sometimes Just adorable
---
My god, someone make this man a Fog Whisperer!
---
I wouldn't know, just said that because everyone seems to say that shes bad on console lol
---
tbh the only way to make the nurse not broken would be butchering her whole kit (and trust me, no one wants that). The best option bhvr has is reworking her. She can still be powerful with a whole new power
---
Nah they show up a lot. More than ultra rares should. So do syringes for survivors.
---
Lmao thank you for saving me my zero dollars that I would‚Äôve otherwise wasted on buying a free to play mobile game
---
Aaaaaaaw thank you! üòò
---
The idea is rough but could be amazing. maybe can throw something. The idea of either cannibalising or being injured, but maybe instead of injury another debuff. Maybe the longer they are the less they see, either FOV or just groggier. And no pots, i‚Äôm so sick of the fucking place you have to go to to get rid of an effect. Pig, plague, Freddy,
---
Oh God
---
So many times I wished there was just an auto spend option because of this.
---
I have spent AT LEAST 50 hours just spending BP.
---
I might just sit at 1 mill at all times now just to annoy people with my laziness
---
They dont show up for me often on ps4 so yeah ü§£ I really dont think theyre an issue even at rank1 for survivors though
---
This is a great idea! Thank you for the advice :)
---
How so? I said we wasn't gonna get the update like everyone else and it happened.
---
Isn't the lesson pay attention to your surroundings? If he would have looked back he would have known to just leave. Or am I missing something.
---
I'm also on PS4 and I have to actively avoid them because there's too many
---
And I literally have about 3 times as many syringes than styptics on my survivor main
---
That takes dedication, I only P3 my mains. Good job.üëè
---
Legion
---
Might be people that still haven't played from rank reset and were low purple ranks. I feel you though
---
I love how her old outfits are like country Taylor Swift and this outfit is like the "reputation" Taylor Swift. I'm convinced that "Kate" is actually just Taylor Swift's fake fog name.
---
If you enjoy it, and don't mind losing some games, more power to you.  I would recommend Cannibal with the Insidious perk.  It works quite well.
---
It's biggest thing is the reduced terror radius. It lets you walk normally, then crouch when Whispers goes off, never exposing yourself easily.
---
Destiny 2 wants to know your location.
---
Kobe off the hook. Get downed by the facecamper, then picked up. DS him. Run over and jump through the hatch with your key.
---
"GG EZ baby killer" in chat afterwards.
---
We had no clue and just dc‚Äôed
---
Thanks, a lot of people aren't gonna think so, tho. Can't win 'em all.
---
I've had this converstaion with a friend of mine. 10/10 they should do it.
---
What about swf where you can coordinate every action and gen rush while a single guy loops. Or just invite the players in your lobby to a party
---
When is DBD mobile gonna me available in the US?
---
Lmao just like in that movie.
---
You should be able to buy whatever addons you want without having to get them at random through the bloodweb
---
What makes you say that?
---
I think you shouldn't have to put an offering at all and you can kill any survivor after they have been hooked twice.
---
Good starting place
---
I literally do the same. If somebody doesn't struggle, or people doesn't unhook despite me not preventing unhooks... Well, unfortunately
---
Spirit Fury without Enduring is pretty weak.
---
I guess me and all the other people are just special. :) Just because it happens less often does not mean it never occurs. I also don't trust those because they didn't explain what went into them, what time frame, what months, etc. Those same stats also said that at rank 1 there is an 60-80 percent survival rate and I bet that number is also skewed by what killers are played at that rank so there are even more circumstances, even if it is pretty rare it sure seems like it to me and many others that these groups are pretty organized for not being SWF at all. I am once again talking about my personal experience with the game, so you cannot tell me what I have seen.
---
I only got plague, ghostface, Legion, Jeff, Jane, and ash. Not too bad
---
Oh nice! But is that worth two perks? I‚Äôd like to use discordance instead of whispers to find people.
---
Do you have actual arguments or just random insults as to why I‚Äôm bad and that survivor isn‚Äôt easy.
---
Jeez! Would it be against the killer's code to show just *SOME* mercy? Are there 4/5 gens left? Even you just play normally you will still most likely get at least a 2K or 3K.
---
What survivors get pissed off about is when the killer decides to play  sweaty and/or a toxic asshat. Such as zooming back to to an recently unhook survivor as Billy/Nurse/Spirit.  Which equates to survivors at best getting less than 5,000 bloodpoints.
---
You really gonna act like this a toxic SWF when you have ruin and ebony mori when there are only 3 survivors left with 4+ gens? Really?
---
Don't get me wrong if there are 2 or 1 gens left and survivors decides to DC all bets are off. Especially if they were being toxic shitheads.
---
I would feel that they would just want a chance to do something during this match. Even some blood points are better then escaping via hatch and still depiping.
---
Who‚Äôs gonna tell him
---
Can someone show me a video of these supposed infinites with balanced landing? Please?
---
Wow, Asif Steam shows how much bloodpoints overall you‚Äôve earned..
---
That's like your opinion man
---
Well, if you look at how bloodpoints are accumulated from both sides, it gives a few outlines of how to efficiently get more points. One is to walk away from the hook after hooking. You get docked points for staying in the close vicinity over time. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to walk away to the other side of the map. 
---
You get more points the more you hit people, so allowing time to heal is beneficial in the long run, as you get more opportunities to harm them.
---
If you hook someone and then go after someone else, you force one person on their team to go rescue. That‚Äôs only two peeps on gens. If you chase another one, there‚Äôs only one doing gens. That benefits you. The more people are healing the less they are working on gens.
---
Looping is a good mechanic as it gives you and then chase points. You can just break it off, loop away for a second, and then come back when they move away, nabbing them and getting another chase bonus.
---
There‚Äôs plenty of ways to get BP that‚Äôs not killing survivors.
---
He was biggg mad
---
r/woosh
---
You almost had me for a moment ain't gonna lie my dude lol
---
Good idea, you get rest, you will need it.*
---
Thats sad, they should actually do sth about keys (same goes for moris somehow i think, both are those very dumb and annoying things you cant so much about, at least they are on the other sides of the wall)
---
Dc or just die fat so you can get to the next game
---
Why bill isnt coming?
---
How can you see how many bp you earned?
---
Yea, they should make them cost 15 dollars or 10, not 10.50.
---
60%? A little generous don‚Äôt you think? More like 6%
---
Damn, that's very impressive! I'm around 3400 hours as well but I'm not even close to have every perk on KILLER (already did p3 everyone tho), also have only 3 survs on p3 tho.
---
I play both sides, but mainly survivor. I guess that's why there's such a huge difference? \*cries in less bloodpoints\*
---
Because it wasn‚Äôt exactly common knowledge back then. With all the sex/ abuse scandals happening in the film industry in the past 5 years stuff like this gets bought to the surface. Even 10-15 years ago a lot of things got swept under the rug. I was a young teen when Jeepers Creepers came out and I had no idea. A lot of things get bought to public attention as more people are speaking out against sex abuse and sex crimes in Hollywood.
---
There's still not many possible plays overall and quite frankly I'd rather they focus on other balance areas of the game first
---
But don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs a problem that a killer must rely on a survivors mistake to win not just his own skill? And coordinated swf groups will have one guy (usually with borrowed time) go for the save while the others gen rush. Plus that is counting on you catching a survivor before multiple gens are done.
---
Nice urban evasion insta heal Claudette btw
---
So you tunnel the guy and get DSed, that's a lot of instant karma! Well noticed!
---
don't worry I'm sure the gen related perk in the next chapter will surely fix gen times.
---
That is freaking adorable.
---
Yes I can remember people's names. It's not hard. You're an idiot, have a good day.
---
I basically played as Nurse with no blink after someone dc'd then after the game ended a survivor said "ez double pip". That same guy t bagged etc. but I still felt bad for him. Lmao
---
This is amazing!
---
Omegablink practically triples the blink range while also increasing charge speed per meter you travel, increases the blink movement speed per meter you travel. Theres 0 downside to using it. If you play with none stop omegablink consistently and get muscle memory down its insane
---
I‚Äôm flattered!
---
Wait so does the bloodweb go infinite at p3 50?
---
You as an artist posting art on the internet won't get in trouble, it would just be the company itself that would get in trouble if they added it to the game due to them using it unlawfully. 
---
Instead of making it red a common colour to use instead is green (however any colour other than red works as well).
---
In any case the art looks sick, keep up the good work!
---
I feel like they should lower the percentage a lot, like 10% bloodpoints or something. Because yes, 1500 doesnt sound like much at first, but then you have 70 brown add ons that you dont use and it really stacks up. Although overall I really want this to be a thing
---
Only to rescues and healing others. And I don't think the bonus speed is that strong.
---
I got multiple 4k on Haddonfield as hag
---
leather needs an add on overall 
---
the sound ones do nothing for leather
---
chili does literally nothing
---
no ultra rares
---
But you dont need that. Just get used to blink normally and you'll still farm, especially if you have good perks
---
If killers getting harder is the trade-off for this, I'm totally ok with it.
---
You can run but you can't hide BITCH!
---
FTFY
---
i have seen 90 post like this already and it always ends up on the front page. People who make these are not funny nor original.
---
Self-Care is a bad perk but first one is realistically better, although I hate admitting it
---
Ah, I forgot about those gens. Then if super dynamic maps won't be an option with the current engine, and quite frankly other options are held back by engine, do you think the game can survive with just this current gameplay?
---
Is the loop that appealing and addicting?
---
Where are the killers?
---
If they make the ultra rare add-ons like 150k-200k each or just no ultra rare add-ons
---
Im jealous ü§§
---
Iirc they did SAY they would ban people using Wake Up! But i'd guess cause it was just 5 days, and there was no way to til who was using it to exploit they didn't ban people.
---
I mean how'd you like it if they banned every killer for accidentally seeing survivors at gens with the STILL unfixed bug?
---
Killer bugs in general last WAY longer then survivor bugs, so they can easily ban people who exploit those
---
I don't remember honestly, I just remember we sent messages afterwards
---
Literally all they'd have to do is allow struggle as last person. It wouldn't take any time to program that.
---
Spirit &gt; Billy
---
Billy can be looped, Spirit can‚Äôt.
---
Congratulations. That entire thread is a lie though.
---
I don‚Äôt see a story
---
The arguably best Pig on twitch, Scorpionz, runs Brutal Strength, Enduring, Monitor &amp; Abuse and Whispers.

---
Exactly, the survivor pip system is ridiculous, the survival category is just absurd and objective category needs a buff because you can do a lot of gens and still not pip with iridescent in that category but if you get iridescent in altruistic and silvers everywhere else you can still somehow pip.
---
to make all killers viable we just gave them all Nurse's power.
---
oh god please don't I have 6 baby Amanda's you can't take me from them
---
You make absolutely no sense. Troll elsewhere your powers are useless here.
---
Ill never understand why the secret dlc offerings dont carry over the perks you‚Äôre original bringing when you burn the offering. Its a no brainer why addons dont but if they allowed the perks then maybe more people would use them and they would get a feel of how the killer is with a perk build of their choice which could potentially convince them to purchase them
---
I love how you put Ochido's face on that character and that the "all bathroom ban" means that he got banned from PC AND Console.
---
Speed isn‚Äôt a action though. It goes for sabotage and repairs too
---
No because console lmao
---
So basically , me and a friend were playing at like 3AM and we got against this freddy three times . 
---
The video is from the third game . 
---
we were against that freddy first game and he tunneled the s*** out of my friend . Second game , same freddy again and he tunneled me this time . 
---
And third game , just watch the video 
---
Yea that freddy hated both of us .
---
I was still writing it :(((
---
can you not just leave with it on your head? i have most my time on pig and I see this all the time.
---
&gt; and for what reason exactly
---
They still won't be able to tell apart you cutting your connection intentionally vs your ISP disconnecting you.
---
Jfc that was nice
---
Like ghostface was hard to see anyway lol
---
Does the artist has a Instagram page? I don't have Facebook and I like to follow fellow artists.
---
Yeah, I definitely remeber playing you a few times. Regardless, I'm sure our games were fun.
---
&gt;I might just sit at 1 mill at all times now just to annoy people with my laziness
---
I can absolutely understand that. To spend 1 million straight into the Bloodweb (especially at lvl 1 chars) is just extremely boring.
---
Is Bamboozle a good perk to run on Legion?
---
You aren‚Äôt alone there. I have had the same issues, but if you get to higher ranks, theres less chance of potato teammates. It also means potato killers are rare as well.
---
I think 1 of them had a non-active trap, so they died for no reason.
---
How many hours do you have on it?
---

---
The game is almost as bad as Haddonfield, It consists of around 20 safe pallets one after another.
---
Lol
---
It goes unfits at lvl 50 you can choose if you wanna prestige
---
Myers is so much fucking sexy
---
I'd say Spirit is slightly better, depending on the circumstances. Against survivors with Spine Chill, bu I'd say they're equal
---
I play killer mostly and I don't understand why some killers camp because a survivor t-bagged them or for flashlight clicking because in reality it doesn't really effect how the game will end even though it's to get the killer angry to get their attention.
---
actually you would depip if you went full sweatlord because you wouldnt be getting any emblems
---
Not if two of the last three escape through the hatch with a key. Hatch stays open as there is only one survivor remaining.
---
Definitely Spirit &gt; Billy
---
Spirit doesn't have as much map pressure as Billy or an Instadown, but she has the loop counter ability compared to Billy which still has to run through loops
---
Very good man
---
Sure
---
Omg you're right :O
---
I use to have ever killer up to clown p3 all perks.. then I stopped playing. 
---
Coming back for Freddy rework seems interesting.
---
Didn't know you could see BP earned stat I need to check that out for sure
---
Thats true I haven't thought of that.
---
Don't do it, the part about getting higher rarity stuff doesn't actually work, the devs said it themselves that it doesn't do anything.
---
Getting chased is what makes surv fun for me
---
It might not be "infinite" but a BL user can loop haddonfield houses for a long ass time
---
Are dedicated servers for pc only?
---
You're the one that asked me if I could remember people's names, like it was something abnormal. I'm concerned for your mental capacity. There's also nothing I didn't respond to, so unless you have any other questions, I'll just take my leave.
---
In your opinion who is the most overpowered killer to someone with little experience and what perks would you have them use?
---
Sure the most powerful killer in skilled hands is Nurse, but what about if you were to give a player with less than 100 hours a max perk'd killer, what would it be?
---
REYYAH
---
Sorry OP for making such a long post &lt;3
---
I asked how you matchmake with the exact same people, in an amount of time to remember them, and then still think they're salty when you decide to cut their match short.
---
It typically won't reach the supreme court-- getting them to hear your appeal is very, very, very expensive and difficult for the one appealing upwards.
---
And unless you're playing Plague or Legion (and even then sometimes) will heal no matter what. Usually you have one or two people injured, even if you are going to have three, this guy is probably finishing healing. Two people under thanatophobia is 6 seconds (if i'm not stupid) added to your generator, 6 seconds on each generator (and that's being generous), that's 30 seconds, that's the time you take to swipe your weapon, pick up someone, bring them to the hook, hook them and turn around. Or even the time you take to look for someone at the start of the game. Sure you add, a few seconds here and there, but that's nothing compared to ruin.
---
Ruin completely stops a generator everytime you fail the skillcheck, forces some players to gentap which literally double the progression time. Some players will look for the totem which can take up to 0 seconds to two minutes and more depending on the map. And it even takes 14 seconds to cleanse, some killers can even easily play and bait survivors into trying to cleanse it. It sometimes becomes an objective for survivors to do it as you are defending it. Saying that everyone ignores ruin at rank 1 is false.
---
uh no lol. i had hooked him, i had a nea slugged and i was chasing the last person who was a kate. kate managed to escape me bc scratch marks on lerys sucks, she picked the nea up who went to save bill and i was still after kate who started to work on a box and then her head exploded. i knew bill was on that gate bc thats where i downed him previously to hook him so i went to stop the door. 
---
also is it really tunneling if youre contesting the objective? you guys need to rethink the definition of tunneling and this is coming from a survivor main.
---
The more information given to solo survivors, the closer we get to SWF level of coordination.
---
Means they can finally start balancing shit properly instead of leaving Nurse on the number 1 spot permanently.
---
There is no kyf
---
&gt;You can easily learn loops by just watching others then instantly replicate it.
---
But then, again, if this were true, how come there are so many survivors that are not able to run the killer well? Even shack, the most common tile spawn in the game, most survivors are mediocre at best at playing (same for killers). Having even just optimal loop pathing (hugging walls) is something I only rarely see in players, which is one of the bare essentials of looping. And that's just looping - chase interactions are far more intricate than that.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not the only one who struggles as a killer.
---
But there are also people that 3-4k as killer all day long, round after round, in killer ranks that you apparently have never even reached. You can see this on numerous streams. How is this possible? If your answer is that's because most survivors are bad, then being a good survivor is not easy, by definition. If you say most survivors are new, then that is simply false, because the game does not even have enough players for it to be comprised mostly of new players. If players are not new, but still not good at the game, then it is not easy to be good at the game. Even if I were to accept that it is exclusively about knowledge, deriving knowledge on how to play a game by playing the game is very much a skill, and so even if it were that way, acquiring the necessary knowledge to play survivor well would be a skill most players appear to not possess, since they do not play well and lose a lot.
---
&gt;You say vast majority but where are you getting that info
---
The vast majority of survivors I see in my survivor and killer games, as well as those I see on streamer's survivor and killer games, are mediocre at best at the game, and get consistently bested, and again most crucially so in chases, not often lasting 30+ seconds.
---
Most of your other points don't really address the topic. I never argued skill checks or insta-heals require skill to use, nor did I argue about game balance. I am arguing the simple fact that competent killers win the majority of their public matches, that even global escape rates hover below 50%, and that this can only mean either the survivor side is underpowered (which it is not), or most survivors are not that good at the game, which in turn means it is not easy, that it requires skill.
---
If you want to get into a more detailed argument about the ways in which playing survivor does require skill, here are two posts that could start us off on that: https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bhph7n/i_know_i_should_just_leave_them_but_for_some/elvksc6/?st=jyeziiju&amp;sh=8dc393c7 and https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7aig82/stop_with_freddy_was_forcing_me_to_use_loops/dpacj82/?st=juypvvu9&amp;sh=4a5b2372
---
Why would you do this to yourself?
---
If you crouched and held sprint and stopped crouching you could sprint without triggering SB so you could just use it whenever you wanted.
---
I meant in regards to if it was a problem on your end or the killer's.
---
Enduring\Spirit Fury\Nurses\Surveillance
---
Doesnt it activate anyway when you try go thru the exit gates?
---
It might not be difficult to brainlessly run a loop over and over, but being able to do that requires the killer to be just as skill-less. Actual good play in this game requires skill on both sides. Being able to read your opponent and anticipate their moves, effective time management, knowing when to be bold and when to be altruistic, when to slug and when to break off a chase. Good game sense is a part of skill and most average people don‚Äôt have a lot of it. 
---
A non skilled survivor can have all the map knowledge in the world and it won‚Äôt make them last long in a chase against a killer who knows what they‚Äôre doing. Knowing where the loops are and how to run them in a straight line like an AI doesn‚Äôt make a survivor good.
---
Wtf are infinite loops? Pallets have to be dropped due to bloodlust eventually and windows get blocked after 3 vaults
---
*Meg Sprint Bursting into Area 51 Naruto-style*
---
At first it sounds bad but after reading your reasoning I'm going to have to agree with the changes. Sometimes I wouldn't want them to know about the hex, and boy will it be sweet when you chase them into gates whilst they t bag only for them to realize they can't escape!! A lot more strategy with the perk this way. I can see it being super strong with insta downs. Also Blood warden will be a lot weaker compared to this in my opinion.
---
Congrats, you have earned 1 legacy cosmetic. 
---
Now you are back to everything being lvl 1, enjoy &lt;:
---
Depends. Use your eyes, if theres an obsession and the claws are moving, you‚Äôre perfectly fine. If you have spine chill, and it isn‚Äôt lit up, you‚Äôre ok. If you‚Äôre all alone to your knowledge, hide imo. Running will allow the killer to find you, and unless you want to be found, hide behind a rock, since lockers are less reliable. Spine chill up? Hide behind something. Also i recommend repairing on a less open side, somewhere a hatchet wont hit you out of fucking nowhere, or a myers/ ghostface can‚Äôt stalk you reliably, and/or have to get into a more obvious position, which then can be spotted. One last tip, NEVER look at a generator when you‚Äôre working on it. Makes getting snuck up on much easier.

That's true I use premonition 3 on my Feng Min it helped me somewhat but I kinda prefer spine chill though like if the killer hooks someone and comes straight to me they might have BBQ &amp; Chili or if I tap a regressing gen and spine chill lights up the killer might have surveillance but I can see that premonition has some uses.
---
carefully he‚Äôs a hero
---
Did thing against a ghostface.  He stalked me up but lithe made him mistime a lunge.  Take what you can get.
---
Franklin's does nothing if survivors don't have items at the time, items can run out of charges, they can bait you to hit them in easy to find spots and the time wasted generally is less then sloppy butcher. It's decent and has it's uses, but there are better perks
---
Now you can rest.
---
When you get to higher ranks you match with the same people all the time. As to how? I can't answer that, I didn't make the game. Here's a chain of events. I 4k a group of swf and a single.The single  was jumping over a vault over and over for five minutes to annoy me. In post game chat he whines about me using blood warden and how I'm trash for using it. Twenty minutes later I'm in a game with the guy again, I remember his name, and tunnel him. Easy enough to understand I hope?
---
Yep, it happened in a real game
---
That's like saying you fell in love with ur favorite band after their 5th album.
---
Yes, but it all depends on the build you‚Äôre running
---
Getting pallet stunned: " UUUUGH YAAAYAAA"
---
This is intended, keys only keep the hatch open for 30 seconds at most but you can't really guard it anymore without hatch grabs. You can stand on the hatch to prevent others from entering though.
---
Here's how the game will go:
---
* Nurse downs someone, and uses BBQ/whispers to find the next person
---
* Nurse downs more people and hooks, probably ignores decisive because it's irrelevant
---
* 2 survivors left, 2-3 gens remaining
---
* 1 is found and likely kills himself to save the other guy
---
* Either survivor finds hatch or nurse does and blinks from gate to gate
---
*3-4k, ggez
---
You know exit gates have to be guarded right?
---
I'm guessing here, but a killer dc'ing doesn't affect the game as much as survivors dc'ing. If the killer leaves nobody de-pips besides themselves, granted it doesn't allow the survivors to get as much bp or pip easily it really negatively affects themselves. When a survivor dc's it negatively impacts all the other survivors because they're down a player.
---
I can hear this
---
I‚Äôm just mostly confused about what you said, can you like rephrase that please?
---
Buddy, I've been at red ranks for as long as I can muster during the time I've played this game. No, you dont match with the same people. Unless you give me concrete proof, I can't and won't believe you. And nobody at red ranks would be dumb enough to fast vault over one window for that long, and *couldn't* because the entity blocks it after three vaults.
---
1.) If there‚Äôs Ruin, and you‚Äôre working on a gen and you hit a good skill check, stop working and stand up for a couple seconds. This is so you wait until after the regression so you don‚Äôt get more skill checks and have the gen regress anymore. Shouldn‚Äôt be 10 seconds tho lol
---
2.)???
---
Yikes mobile
---
Haha, this is not a repost tho. I made it myself
---
They didn't ban people abusing the Tinkerer bug either so it's not a ~survivor vs killer~ thing lol
---
just like with his original release üò¨
---
I feel ya. If I feel like I'm stomping a game, I usually slow down, look for gens that are being done and scare everybody from it. Smack it and then just run across the map and do the same until like 2 or 3 gens are done.
---
t3 NOED should give exposed not t1
---
Had to up my brightness for that one
---
Happened to me before, I hit my ds on him and it turned out he had DL and rancor, not sure what he was going for
---
here's the format: `\&gt;:\^)`
---
results in \&gt;:\^) cause the backslashes cancel the markup :o)
---
I don‚Äôt view what I said as negative? Art is subjective and that‚Äôs the way my brain saw it ‚ÄúGrim Reaper with a scream mask.‚Äù  It‚Äôs a blend of two iconic characters and the scythe overrode the Ghostface part imo
---
The blind running pains me immensely but the wasted pallet .. I can‚Äôt even describe my disappointment. /s 
---
Legit though practice on that, pays off and saves resources for everyone
---
He‚Äôs past the exit area
---
Living the dream. That's my endgoal as well, wish me luck!
---
Best: Spirit
---
Worst: Leatherface (or maybe Nurse? idk)
---
Push to talk? FUCK YA!
---
Wait is his rework out now?
---
If all survivors ran DS, and I ran rancor, and it was endgame, and I Mori the obsession, and someone uses DS and becomes the obsession, wash rinse repeat, could I theoretically Mori everyone with Rancor in a perfect scenario?
---
Always satisfying seeing a post game like that. I‚Äôd hate to play survivor in one of your games!
---
You are doing pretty well! 
---
I also see you like the thicc survivors ;)
---
I'm kind of expecting quite the opposite, at least for the matches I'm going to join. When ghost face came out I had maybe three out of (guess work here) 20 matches. I was also expecting to see a ton of Amanda after the released skins, which I have seen exactly... Zero times. Of course this is only personal estimation, I might be very wrong :)
---
From a common sense standpoint it makes sense to go for the Dwight on the death hook, but people just see it as a courtesy manner to not 3 hook someone within 5 mins. Slows the game down a little bit, but makes it more fun for everyone.
---
Best: Spirit 
---
Worst: Bubba (assuming this is after Freddy rework)
---
Okay, you're going to yell at me, but I am a legion Main. Those were my sad noises.
---
I mean don't get me wrong there are a LOT of stupid complaints from Surviviors but most of them are so meme levels that at this point ur hard pressed to find one who actually believes it. 
---
Meanwhile what killers want is akin to just breaking the game for them
---
This happens to me so many times even though I'm rank 12 on killer I get like rank 20 survivors and I get depressed if I have to kill a baby Dwight  they don't deserve it ;-;
---
Dbd got me into that show lol
---
nope, but i have no idea what happened in the video
---
You know why they get upvoted? Because almost all of us have had people complain for using "x perk" or "y killer". I upvoted him because I've seen people bitching about bamboozle when I was playing survivor. 
---
Is it a circlejerk if he's right?
---
Ebony mori let you kill after any survivor has been hooked once, ivory allows you to kill one survivor only after they have been hooked and cypress lets you kill the last survivor left in the trial. There are two perks that let you mori a survivor hex: devour hope which requires five tokens from hooked survivors further tan 24m away and rancor lets you mori the obsession after the exit gates are powered.
---
More power to ya, but I have no idea how you didn't get tired of this game long ago XD
---
Moira is probably one of the most fun characters
---
I have 900h in game and I still don't know how to use flashlights. Why are those add-ons useless?
---
Eh. Been playing without bill this whole time anyways. As long as the Freddy rework is still come in fine with it.
---
How much weed do you smoke that you can't remember people's names? Doesn't answer, must be a lot. I'm also going to need concrete proof that you aren't smoking too much weed, so send me over your blood so I can run a drug test /s
---
You really need everything explained to you, huh?
---
I'm inferring a yes because you literally asked me to explain something after I asked this...
---
How about you explain to me a situation where you would be able to discern which guy it was? Use the context of the situation I described, and come up with a scenario that works within the information provided. Kind of like a school question. I'm done explaining the obvious to someone who has the mental capacity of an orangutan. If you can't figure this out by yourself, it's a damned shame.
---
Bloodlust on short loop pallets takes less time than kicking and moving to the next, especially if they increase pallet density like they plan to. Bloodlust needs a change, even if it's just something small like resetting on missed swings.
---
*RRRRRR* O-AHH

I use  [https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard.php](https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard.php) to track my stats.
---
It is an unofficial DBD leaderboard that uses your steam achievements to track in game stats.
---
Whats your level and devotion?
---
what the fuck even happened here, does anyone have an idea?
---
I meant i only have them LEFT. FML
---
I don‚Äôt care about Freddy or bill. I just want them to freaking fix the issue where you can see survivors auras through gens. 
---
Great as killer, terrible as survivor.
---
they are not allowed to change it on ps4. as sony as a rule that you can not update trophies unless they are impossible to get in like a update
---
It was probably a sudden lag spike :p
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware, the fog whisperers are barely listened to at all by BHVR lol
---
Aganika gingia assapu mei
---
I haven‚Äôt seen much use of clown memes on the leftist subs/groups I‚Äôve been on but won‚Äôt deny that‚Äôs possible. What I do know is that Clown World absolutely was a neonazi meme, based on the idea that a world where women, LGBT and POC  get equal treatment is insane and a ‚ÄúClown country‚Äù using Clown imagery and a Clown Pepe to convey white supremacy dog whistles
---
pretty basic
---
How do you know how many bp have you spent?
---
As a killer who uses NOED, NOED is for lil bitches
---
How do you find total bloodpoints earned?
---
You meant Teen Titans go ISNT a quality show?
---
I feel bad for kids nowawdays
---
"Haddonfield is impossible to win on so you can DC. But if you play against an Omegablink Nurse ur expected to stay and play it out you fucking baby Survivior"
---
Part of me's starting to think that you've been trolling for the last couple hours but another part's thinking "no, people who play this game really are that clueless". never mind the fact that the original intent of this entire thing was to ask you why you think it's ok to tunnel people that have either beat you or wasted their own time the entire match. This is definitely a better use of your time. Let me guess, you magically knew which one it was because you caught him in the act even though he was doing it the entire match apparently.
---
Thank you! I hope I can find you one day.
---
It‚Äôs very ‚ÄúDerelicte‚Äù of you.
---
Oh yea with killer I minimum get 20k BP a match (usually get around 50k though)
---
With survivor I minimum get like 8k if the killer tunnels me all game. Hopefully that will change with the new BP update!
---
It must be more of reddit thing, then. I use twitter more often than anything else and it was extremely popular among everyone.
---
also, that's not how weed works.
---
don't worry! you can play spirit with prayer beads and grab people now!
---
Yeah I feel the same, it's really only fun when you're like Achievement Hunter, and can play with a group of friends, especially if you have a killer too.
---
I‚Äôd prefer it if we didn‚Äôt talk about itüò≠
---
Yeah but not in the *old* days
---
I'm so glad I saw the flair I was about to make a fool of myself.
---
Ace in the Hole is a good perk, not strong, not exactly weak. I‚Äôd recommend buying the whole DLC, as it would in turn be cheaper than deciding later on that you may want to buy Ace, etc.
---
You will get there eventually! All anyone has is time and you can most definitely get to where I am with enough playing :)
---
Good luck!
---
What's wrong with you ?
---
I got reported for getting a 4K before 2 gens were completed as Old Freddy.
---
Yes but the steps to take in order to do that are very very long and tedious.
---
Me too oo! Although I'm upset they haven't changed the gen colors from white. It really fucks over two God tier perks
---
Yea if your profile is private then it can't see your steam achievements so it cannot get the information. If you go unprivate for a moment it should see you and place you on the leaderboard.
---
I too would like to get better at this game. What makes a gen/pallet/window a "safe" one? Where are these infinite loops?
---
Ace has Ace in the Hole (addons when getting items from chests), Open handed (increased aura ranges by 4/6/8 metres) and Up the Ante (For each other Survivor still alive, grant a 1/2/3% bonus to Luck to all remaining Survivors)
---
His perks are eh, but ace has a sort of "built in iron will" cause he isn't as loud as other survivors when injured.
---
And that's why I uninstalled again!
---
See you all next year probably, I'm trying Identity V.
---
It's almost identical, tbh.
---
Killers can waste offerings by disconnecting, it's easily the worst of the two.
---
To be fair, they are Broken all game, plus thanatophobia makes their team hate them.
---
holy shit you‚Äôre the reason the community is seen as a shitty salt hole it‚Äôs a game ffs
---
In general? Narcissistic parents, abandonment issues, abusive relationships, minimum wage job working full time, depression, and anger issues. 
---
On this topic? Nothing
---
Ace is not worth it at all if you run meta perks over ‚Äúfun perks.‚Äù Even then, I wouldn‚Äôt say his perks are that fun. 
---
Buy hag
---
What did you do for Nurse?
---
Yep, you got it.
---
Prestige is just for bragging rights anyways :p
---
With the cosmetic shop who needs to be bloody!
---
so many things wrong with this vid lmao. 
---
1. using sprint burst exploit
---
2. trapper gets stuck in own trap
---
3. you make fun of green ranks but waste a good pallet
---
Use one or two in the beginning, just to make them waste time, then use the rest when there's one or two gens left, depending on how quickly they're popping them.
---
Sprint burst exploit?
---
No they never interfere with each other. They're extraordinary together because sometimes you need dh to continue looping and sometimes you need to get distance with balanced. They are awesome!
---
The Tir Optic increases the blindness duration though?
---
I have 3400 hours but only spent about 3000 hours purely grinding for this.
---
I like the vaults. It adds a skill cap to survivor. You can no longer just run at a vault and mash the button. You have to actually think about it. 
---
Blood lust should be removed or nerfed after/when infintes are nerfed because right now it's the only way you can catch people on something like coal tower with BL or haddon field with BL. It rewards killers for playing bad and being in a chase too long but it's also a way to catch people on incredibly safe window loops like coal tower that doesn't invlove running around it till they block it or bamboozle.
---
Scratch marks work fine as far as I'm aware and I've never heard anyone say different. 
---
Ebony's and insta heals do need a rework
---
My face when all three teammates escape even though they could try to save me
---
Oh. I just started like a month ago so there's a lot I don't know
---
i think dbd beat you
---
But have you ever won a survivor match against freddy? Prob not right i mean no one has.
---
I tend to be pretty nice when I play as a killer, though when I'm t-bagged things can change quickly.
---
It would be wicked to have the EGC replaced with the other world. Make the siren sound, and everything start changing once EGC starts. That would be Ideal.
---
Good work and yea you can by using this site    [https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard.php](https://dbd.onteh.net.au/leaderboard.php) .
---
It is an unoffical DBD leaderboard that uses your achievement stats to track your progress.
---
Same happened to me
---
INSANITY
---
We...can't actually see Huntress' face. Or most of her body.
---
Tir Optic, Focus Lens, and Power Bulb's blindness buffs are so minimal they're not worth using.
---
Maybe if you have no other add-ons to use, sure, but just stick to the higher end ones.
---
Both Bamboozle and Fire Up stack with Myer's EW3 vault speed to make him stupidly fast at vaulting.
---
Don't worry about the length of your post mate, this is just the type of contribution I was hoping for.
---
PC Nurse is, atm, the most frustrating part of the game for me. For all the reasons you mentioned. There's a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to blink well, but once you've gotten it down the game is WAYYY too forgiving even without add ons. It's not like Nurses are doing something that's prodigiously hard, either, it's just that once you learn the mechanic you're rewarded disproportionately for it in your ability to make up ground during chases and generate pressure.
---
To your point about add ons not being necessary, today I solo queue'd and we got 3 gens done against a fairly average Nurse with no perks or add ons. So it's not like Nurse NEEDS Omegablink to be viable... at all.
---
I don't think you'll be getting a good counterargument for why Nurse isn't busted atm either. Most of the time I just hear Nurse mains claim she is the only killer that can punish coordinated SWF, which is just grossly untrue.
---
NOWIMANOOB. I know that guy.
---
Devoting an entire perk slot to messing with Survivor's items (if they even bring any in) just isn't worth it. There are higher impact Perks that will function no matter what, and have more influence in the game in general.
---
Take away her add ons
---
