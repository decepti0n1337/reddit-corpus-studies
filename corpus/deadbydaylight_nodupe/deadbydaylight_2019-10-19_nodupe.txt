I personally give kates all my love
---
---
---
They are all good in their own ways. Id say Ghostface is the most fun if you like sneaky plays.
---
You could have totally said "eye see what you did there"
---
Victor doesn't own the franchise. Just the character.
---
It honestly could have forced DBD to be more consistent with its changes back when it was stagnant.
---
Yes, I would pay for that
---
Just another day at work lol
---
Just hang around and let your teammates do gens. You can also spam the jumping jacks to let others know they're camping.
---

---
Feel free to cry.
---
I think so?
---
I agree. Friday the 13th has been my favorite horror series for about 25 years. This whole thing blows ass.
---
I love everything thing about this. respond for the second upvote you deserve
---
It wasn't the lawsuit that had cars flipping out for no reason, counselors getting to the top of the Packanack roof, key items glitching into the ground, healing not working, and spectators not even loading into the match, which were all majors issues that fucked this game long before the suit did.
---
Let them all live and the legend spreads with quadruple speed!
---
Hes purposefully deranking to get better ‚Äújuke montages‚Äù or whatever on baby killers. You should report him, if its reportable, if he does it again
---
Again, Spine Chill is great against all killers, not just Spirit. In fact, it's better against several others than against her.
---
Into a Elbow Drop
---
Nobody seemed to say this, but your photoshop skills are pretty good!
---
Yeah but I mean stuff like Wraith, Ghostface, Hillbilly, Leatherface, Hag, etc. survivors shouldn't be able to hear the TR and instantly deduct "Yeah we're playing against a Trapper." 
---
I think Doctor is an edge case though given how fast survivors find out the killer is the doctor.
---
Nice
---
What free shit?
---
FUCK!
---
Oops. Well don‚Äôt I feel stupid! üò¨üòã I am just now, noticing you put them down in the comments a bit lower.
---
I didn't say it was stupid, I was asking how I would know.
---
Those perk icons look sick
---
Completely agreed here. The fanbase will eat this shit up because the demographic is young and stupid, don't know when they're being scammed. It's bullshit that this game already has 4 avenues of monetization and it's still not enough. I'm just waiting for the lootboxes to come out now...
---
I honestly wish DBD would take a few notes from F13 on multiple escape options and less repetition.
---
I really love the unique menu animations, and my favorite is Ash. If he's the survivor you equipped, he looks deadass at the killer lol
---
I'm CACKLING.
---
:)
---
Man that‚Äôs good. I never thought I could actually feel somewhat scared by a chase theme (other than micheals chase theme while He‚Äôs in tier 1 after sneaking up on me)
---
No they weren't, you're just misinformed :/
---
Anything survivors they you'll get banned for wont get you  banned,  except language, still cant say racist shit in chat and swear and threaten etc.
---
If that ain‚Äôt facts
---
Nah he just DC‚Äôd
---
I wouldn't say too advantageous, simply because killers get that "5th" perk capability with their unique powers. The ability to communicate is stong but it doesn't counter everything.
---
lmao yeah that community is *[so much nicer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMlUGRxrQy4)*
---
It said she was working at 16, but never said it further, so I‚Äôve always assumed she‚Äôs 16. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve read it though so I may be wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs 16.
---
Go watch a Youtuber called Otzdarva. His DBD content is on his second channel Not Otzdarva. He is one of the top Trapper players in the community. If there is anyone that can help you improve your Trapper gameplay it is him.
---
Most games nowadays, maybe.
---
Did he quit????
---
My momma always said I had two hands...
---
FUCKING GENIUS
---
Okay awesome, thanks!
---
I think of the dbd universe like a sort of dimension which takes things from other dimensions, each dimension being a different chapter. This would explain why no one is worrying about the sudden dissapearnce of a lot of survivors, because in each dimension/chapter Only a few got taken
---
It can be exciting to play with a "Celebrity" of the game, but yeah acting like a god because you managed to tunnel somebody down idk lol. Best I've ever done was opening the Hatch for Monto's Girlfriend bbgurl via Key while Monto got Mori'd by a tunneling 3 blink Nurse on The Game (Took her all 5 gens to get the job done, too. What a champ at kiting Monto can be lol). Only reason I lived there was cause Monto kept aggro ALL game though.
---
Aren‚Äôt y‚Äôall complaining about the fact that there‚Äôs so many toxic killers and survivors? Plus, for the most part is what I meant. Of course there‚Äôs gonna be bad apples in every group. You can‚Äôt take one incident and say ‚Äúthis is the entire community.‚Äù
---
Mori would be tie someone upside down and start cutting in half
---
Removes comments that are uncivil only from the people he disagrees with. Doesn't removes comments that are uncivil when they agree with him. Okay.
---
Spiderman meme
---
This must be for dead by sunrise the mobile app
---
Haha no worries
---
They would pretty much have to start over from scratch. It‚Äôs not like DBD where the killer you choose determines what objects spawn on the map. I‚Äôm pretty sure Jason‚Äôs shack is hard coded into the map regardless which version of him you select. You can‚Äôt just drop a new killer into the map with a new kill mechanic who doesn‚Äôt hear Pamela‚Äôs voice in his head. 
---
I actually do wish they would make a new game similar to DBD: essentially unlicensed but with a few licensed characters. Unfortunately, Gun apparently signed a no-compete clause with Horror Inc when they got the rights so even that seems impossible. üòû
---
Campers aren't smart though. If they were they wouldn't be campers.
---
Yeah that's what the serums are for.  Each serum lets you get one piece, so you pick/choose as you get the serums.
---
wha, it was your screenshot? I could sear I saw the same thing on his stream, he was even using Demo
---
He's got a point ya know
---
It‚Äôs mostly about the gen progress in the first 9 minutes of the game, also depends on rank a bit.
---
Okay, so you run noed. You're not every killer in every game. And you weren't that doctor.  
---
Seriously the "every killer runs noed." meme is insulting to those who don't and personally I'm tired of the toxic gridlock between survivor and killer mains. Doctor played well, noed or not.
---
Agreed, maybe if you wanted to be really ballsy, I could run unbreakable or tenacity. Ideally this build also works vs non campers .
---
Lol!  Ummmmm might want to scroll up buddy.  You absolutely said they were perks.  Copy and pasted from your response....
---
"Using your logic, the hatch, EGC and keys are all crutch perks."
---
Your words not mine hombre.
---
In no way shape or form is anything I said remotely hypocritical.
---
Again the hatch mechanic exists so that when a killer kills 3 survivors they don't automatically get the 4k.  A lone survivor would physically be impossible to repair the remaining gens and open an exit gate. This is pretty basic logic to follow.  This is why it exists.  If you think everytime a survivor gets 3 potato teamates they automatically deserve to die 100% too you don't understand balance.
---
Again read the words I wrote about keys.  I fully acknowledged they are the single biggest crutch survivors have on their side.  
---
But so are moris.  You are out of your peasized little mind if you think moris arent crutch.  They're literally ez mode for killer and every bit the cheese equivalent of keys (early kills when they shouldn't be possible vs early eascapes when they shouldn't be possible).
---
Lol!  Your final claim is the entire circus my friend.  There's a reason survivors have 3 health states.  It is absurd to think a logical gameplan is simply to never be downed a single time.  That's literally ludicrous.  They ranking up from potato ranks and see how consistent that gameplan is up at reds.  Those killers arent idiots man.  Sometimes they're going to outplay you or catch you at a dead part of the map.  Try telling a red rank Spirit your gameplan is to never go down once.  Go ahead I'll wait lol.  You are so clueless about this game it physically pains me.
---
Mmmm yeah. I do like this 
---
Nice stuff :)
---
Oh please, if fallout 76 can fucking flourish despite being a far more broken POS, a game like this would have been just fine. Hell, BHVR breakd half the game on DBD each update and it survives.
---
Aight, it's time to go on a witch hunt. What was the full name? I've forgotten it already
---
No, the red heal overlay overlapped the insanity indicator
---
What‚Äôs the word on his face lift
---
Do they really just leave the games out in the case on the shelf?  In America, that‚Äôs how you lose all your money to shrink.
---
You are purposely manipulating / misinterpreting words to also apply those arguments to Wraith. You also seem to refuse to understand what the complaints actually are about Spirit.
---
Yes for freddy, plague, ghostface I would buy them all
---
It doesn't take but 1-2 assholes to ruin something. If 1 person that owns part of the rights says no, or if someone who thinks they own the rights says no. Then you have what happened with F13 and everything goes to hell.
---
Yeah they could easily make cash by making a Jason DbD DLC. But they might not want to. Maybe there is still legal things to deal with, maybe they are under an agreement to not have Jason in games that competes with F13, maybe they just want to not bother with the crap anymore and would rather do something else for a while.
---
It's a wonder DbD got so many licensed Killers to be honest. Pig (Saw), Nightmare (Nightmare on Elm Street), Cannibal (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Demogorgon (Stranger Things), Shape (Halloween), and Ghostface (just the mask, not from the movie Scream). Out of all of those, only 1 has legal issues.
---
Behaviour got the rights to use just the mask and made their own version of the Killer based off that mask. The movie Scream has nothing to do with Ghostface and it can't as Behaviour didn't have the rights for that version from the movie. Just for the mask itself. So they made an entirely original Killer for the mask to keep out of legal problems with who owns the rights to Scream.
---
Takes a lot of set up, Can't be downed until you get an unhook vs a terminal camper, Don't reveal DS until you're in a situation where he can't adapt, And hope the door isn't too far.  And that's with his bad move of picking you up even though you were too far away from the gate to escape
---
Feels like one would be a great fit. Their power could be to bring dead survivors back to life as mindless sentries, that shout when they see other survivors.
---
That would require Miller and Horror Inc to come to a rights sharing agreement. If they could do that then all of this would have been resolved years ago. üòû
---
I saw someone suggest it elsewhere, but the picture ghostface takes when he moris should be shown before the score screen at the end.
---
I'm bad at the game either wayüò£
---
Yeah but since the obsession isn't affected I HAVE to keep them off gens and if they die my perk shuts off. Because of this every time I find the obsession I make sure NOT to hook them but simply slug and move on. 
---
If they DC not much changes other than my perk being countered. Before, the obsession was constantly being slugged and harassed (Doctor is pretty good at this since you can send them into madness 3 and then slug to maximize time off gens for obsession) and after the DC the obsession left the match but the other 3 survivors now work at full speed. 
---
I might have to intentionally tunnel to force out a DS and get a new obsession when this happens. 
---
IMHO hooking the obsession should also give stacks + maybe if the obsession dies, simply locking your stacks in place similar to Save The Best For Last.
---
Props to him not rage quitting.
---
Looks like hosted servers to me.
---
*killers
---
Don't fall asleep.
---
You have 60s before you fall asleep - and if Fred hits you, you'll *immediately* fall asleep. Note that Fred can hit you at any time now - he doesn't need to sleep you first.
---
While asleep, you are *Oblivious* - Fred has no Terror Radius, you just get his lullaby. No Terror Radius means sleeping survivors can't trigger Borrowed Time. Bear this in mind if you're going for an unhook.
---
If he has puddles, they can now affect you and you can kiss goodbye to looping. If you're lucky then he has pallets. Absolute bastards will use Swing Chains and Jump Rope to slow sabotage, repair, and healing to a near-standstill.
---
Fred can teleport to any gen that hasn't been fully repaired. Be very careful when Fred hooks someone beside an incomplete gen - there's a decent chance he'll teleport to it either to prevent the unhook, to hit the unhooker to negate Borrowed Time, or he'll be looking to exploit Make Your Choice.
---
You can wake yourself up by getting hooked, failing a skill check, gettng someone to wake you up, or finding an Alarm Clock. Getting hooked is bad, failing a skill check is bad if Fred has Ruin, and the Wake Up action doubles in length every time it's used. The Alarm Clock has no drawbacks, and in fact buys you a bonus 30s of not being asleep.
---
So yes, stay awake, be very careful around hooks, and don't rely on other people to wake you.
---
Iron maiden OP
---
He took it in stride. Almost had us too, was a really close game.
---
I actually just wanna give them a hit for points before I dip.
---
Pretty sure the devs confirmed that they could've kept updating even with the law suit but they used it an excuse to stop development
---
LMAO The meme title got me "When I'm done Baby Meg will still be alive"
---
Yo wtf
---
So uh...I main spirit. Stridor is in my build. And I am pretty sure Iron Will hard counters stridor. A survivor with IW3 makes zero noise to me.
---
And this whole thing gets confusing because many eons ago it was the other way around. Many patches ago, it worked exactly the way that you describe here. Then at one point iron will got shadow buffed, wasn't really mentioned in any patch notes, it just started working the other way around and IW3 just straight hard-counters stridor. In all likelihood the devs changed something completely unrelated and the spaghetti code just changed entirely the stridor/IW3 interaction.
---
I don't want to spread misinformation, and I can't offer 100% certainty, but I'm feeling pretty sure of this. I will make an effort to pay closer attention my next few games, try to confirm this and report back. Maybe it got changed again and i never noticed, idk.
---
i had a group that had an instant dc and figured I would get my 180-second chase daily and let them go since they had a DC within 1 minute of spawning in. I hung them all twice but after that, I even opened the gates for them. had one survivor tea bagging the exit and stuff and I chased him out. In the end game chat, he said Ez baby killer.
---
 Next game I somehow got the same survivor and since I still needed a bit of time for the daily I decided he would be the only one to die and the rest would be allowed to leave.
---
 I killed him within the first 1 minute 30 seconds of the game and then just messed around chasing and hanging people but was letting them get pulled off. 
---
1 person died on the first hook because as soon as the second faze happened they just decided to die. there were 2 left 1 was hiding not working on gens and the other was trying to do all the gens by themselves.  
---
I knew where the hider was because he was just hiding in a closet with crows and as soon as I grabbed him he instantly dced and I let the other person leave. 
---
The dude who was in the closet was still in chat even though he dced and called me a hacker because how could I know he was in a closet lol. 
---
That is the second time I got called a hacker for pulling someone out of a closet that was not hard to know they were there. The dude I killed at the beginning who was toxic last round agreed with the closet clown because he said the last game I sucked and was horrible. 
---
I told him don't mistake someone being nice for being bad at the game I let you leave the last game and you are not as good as you thought you were. I could have easily killed everyone last round but was being nice since you guys had a DCer right at the beginning and I needed to only get chase points for daily. He counterd with Bullshit and left lol
---
So you pissed on a grave of a dead game with a better one? Good job! Like I mean it

Enter the abyss
---
Let's do this another way. I'll pretend I'm talking to an adult with finance experience.
---
Let's say BVHR has has made 30k more gross revenue this year over their projected income from the previous fiscal year. They can now expand their development team due to the extra income. Sounds great right.
---
They have a choice what to do with the extra income: Hire extra devs to help out the current balance team (buffing/nerfing killers/survivors/perks), hire extra quality assurance devs (bug fixers), or create a new department for a Battle Pass. Rather than hire extras for the first two, they hire extras for the latter while moving around who they can from the first two departments and/or the cosmetics department.
---
The end result is the same six week timetable for DLC release/bug fixes/new bugs introduced. Same buggy releases, same slow ass lackluster updates. Nothing has changed, it didn't get better and it didn't get worse. But on the side we get something almost no one asked for - a battle pass, which new devs have been hired to do.
---
This is our issue. Rather than focus on what's most important and that's balance, bug fixes, and improving core mechanics (i.e. creating new objectives for survivors, new modes overall, buffing non-viable killers) they are now adding a battle pass to the game and wish to maintain it in addition to their other departments/responsibilities.
---
If this isn't clear to you, then go about your day because I do not argue with children.
---
The bottomline is that there were more important things to do for the health and well being of this game, and they chose to do a Battlepass for a easy money grab. It's not commendable and is all around greedy and short-sighted.
---
Shaaaaaaameee
---
Nothing yet last we heard on Twitter the devs wanted to talk after the actor tweeted out they should change it.
---
Anyone who would be able to gice you a sufficeint answer is the same kind of person who just wouldnt and tell you to go fuck yourself.
---
You cant get an answer for this, basically just acknowledge the world has got horrible selfish assholes in it that like being pricks, and they can play games online just like the rest of us.
---
Im assuming you have hag leveled up, why no ruin? But devour, whispers (if used correctly), and bitter are pretty good
---
My point being I wouldn't have clicked his IG. I assumed it wasn't going to be at the top since comic strips tend to actually put out comics regularly. If you don't know the source just say so instead of giving me a lmgtfy, if I wanted to Google it I would have done it myself. I've tried finding comics in this exact situation before when they have hundreds or thousands of comics and it's so much easier if someone can just post the direct source.
---
F13 is fun as fuck and a better ‚Äúparty‚Äù game imo, but the whole lawsuit freezing any future content is unbelievable. If you ever get the opportunity get the game and play the interactable cabin. One of the coolest things I have seen a developer put into a game.
---
Someone is running a rainbow map with the add on that shows the auras to teammates.
---
But a lottery ticket.
---
And they just say "lol u mad?" And you get mad. No point in any of that shit my man just get up and walk to your front door and back for a breather, the best revenge on your worst enemy is to be unlike them and live happily.
---
I need these on sweaters
---
I wouldn't mind another section in the shop for them with some obtainable via Shards and some Cell only. (Would probably need to make the lowest rarity Green due to them being an entire animation)
---
You really know nothing of dead by daylight do you üòû
---
Because it's not they're fault. Because they're new to the game. It's not their fault they're getting matched with killers who are higher rank and more skilled than they are. Imagine if the first time you played killer you played a 4 man SWF blendette team with instaheals and DS. You'd never want to play the game again.
---
I used to work at Sears and that shit would piss me off sooo much! I would see people put mens clothes on a rack that was CLEARLY meant for Women‚Äôs and I would say ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt go there!‚Äù and they would act so innocent and say something like ‚Äúomg i‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù 
---
Like bitch wtf. You can either walk the 10 feet and put it back or just give it to me and ill put in back where it belongs.  
---
And dont even get me started on the trashy couple who decide to take a (I shit you not) CART FULL of HANGED CLOTHING to the fitting room, tries them on, doesn‚Äôt like 90% of them, then proceeds to leave the un-hanged pile of clothing on the floor. Then comes to MY REGISTER, and then gets an attitude with me (for no reason) because they left their wallet at home.
---
That DC sums up everything pretty well
---
This sub is ridiculously bipolar
---
Yes they were, most notably the F13 mobile game and one of the toy manufacturers, NECA, were able to release content a couple weeks after the lawsuit came into affect since they were already working on it beforehand.
---
The game was working on, that we know of, Uber Jason and a pajama pack both of which were nearly finished and they chose to scrap it instead. Shitty devs, stop blaming the lawsuit, the devs played a big enough part in ruining their own game beyond said lawsuit.
---
This made me lol, thanks
---
Still a better Horror game than DbD in that genre though, just not as populated as much due to that unfortunate lawsuit with the owner of Jason being very petty. DbD is an action coop game to me. Its fun to pick up and have fun with but if I want to feel like Im in an actual horror movie, Friday 13 is the game I still play today. Especially, since I'm a Jason diehard fan
---
Or what I like to do ... simply, periodically breathing heavily into the mic. üòà
---
Bruh, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying! ü§ô
---
I distinctly remember thinking, ‚ÄúGoddamn does Tapp breathe loudly,‚Äù right before Michael walked right past me.
---
Are they not making enough cash from all the skins??
---
Fantastic job. Amazing.
---
As someone who almost always decided to just farm if I'm obviously dominating the survivors: yup
---
Level nea, all her perks are amazing
---
I enjoyed it.  Are you gonna do killer builds too, or are you just focusing on Feng right now?
---
True and will we still be getting the usual cosmetic drops in the store every week as well or is that stopping?
---
Oh yeah, you mean the money that goes to Sony and not BHVR? You mean those $30 per purchase they are missing out on? Just a few years ago, they were incredibly small. And no, it isn‚Äôt a charity, they are a business and they need to make money. BHVR needs the money, and I can tell they would put it to good use. Activison will wipe their ass with it.
---
I'm all for a battle pass because I love having things to work towards. Gives me more of a reason to grind for rewards I'll enjoy, plus if people don't want it they don't have to opt in and buy it.
---
Only time will tell on that part.
---
Considering that in all my survivor matches its the huntresses that DC most, you probably saved yourself the trouble.
---
Survivor main here who only plays killer for dailies. Everyone gets out. Most of the time I don't even hook. I slug everyone and then keep picking them up and dropping them till they get away.
---
God I hope we do Dx
---
I escaped from the trial and then all of a sudden my game says I dced
---
I think everyone is just memeing because you can see her ass. I don't know how many people actually get off to that stuff lol.
---
Dude why'd you have to be an asshole? Doesn't matter if you think that not looking him up is lazy, that was just kinda a dick thing to do.
---
I‚Äôm at 8 now üòÇ
---
Yeah i got called a dog because this claudette said this the other day "wtf dog?"
---
Me: "? What?"
---
"You hit me while i was healing under the stairs"
---
I thought they were meming, i was wrong.
---
‚ÄúLook how they massacred my Ghostyboi‚Äù
---
You know what they say, you can never have too much money.
---
playing immersed **IS** incredibly boring. you could argue that you should play stealthy against a nurse, but you don't *have* to. she can be juked. it takes skill, but it can still be done. spirit is no where near the same.
---
BTW how long is it between rank resets?
---
This was beautiful, but we all know they'd just ds and tbag at the exit gate till a second after it's over :(
---
Ill have a look bro, I've got the time, you arent hurting anyone.
---
Lmao all the salty killer mains are hating on you
---
What...do you think BHVR makes no money from their game being on PS+...? And them making money wasn't really my point, my point was that PS+ isn't free. Just a few years ago, they still weren't *that* small. I have literally no idea where you're getting this from? And yeah, they do, but do you honestly think that the purchase for the game, or the $90+ on DLC, or the $18 outfits weren't enough money for them? It was. They just know they can milk it and get away with it, so they are.
---
That‚Äôs so adorable!! Can‚Äôt condone the name ‚ÄúGracen‚Äù though.
---
Ok boomer ok boomer ok boomer
---
Nop you get all your cells back its confirmed
---
I'm still opposed.  I just don't bring it up because there is nothing to say at this point.  The cause is lost, the war is over, this change IS coming no matter how much I hate it, and there's nothing left at this point but to make peace with it and see how it goes.  If the battlepass is actually the world's shittiest thing, I'll gladly pick that flag back up and carry it back into battle, but until we get our hands on it and have had time to judge it fairly there's no use in fighting a change that is 100% unavoidably going to happen.
---
Thank you so much it‚Äôs ppl like you that incorage ppl
---
You get a ton of challenges for free, which nets you a new storyline for free and rewards to buy Halloween outfits for free and get some other charms and other stuff for free. The WHOLE battle pass is free.
---
After all this free stuff, if you want, you can pay money to unlock even more rewards from the free battlepass, including enough Aurid Cells to fully refund your money so you can buy other things for free.
---
How can you even be angry on this I have no idea.
---
Exact same thing just happened to me, googled it and found this post.
---
Thats true, legion is on high school
---
That was pretty close. Looks like you were struggling to get that pallet down, luckily it looked like the killer hesitated slightly as well before trying to hit.
---
Right? It's not only that, but it feels like the whole playerbase has changed to rally around any new microtransactions added to this game. The game is quickly becoming what I didn't want it be and it's disheartening...
---
Do keep in mind that was back during the ‚ÄòFortnite bad‚Äô circlejerk (which is still kinda going on today)- anything similar to Fortnite was shat on relentlessly, and the battlepass was that exactly.
---
Also, the fact that you get your cells back once you complete it ain‚Äôt a bad trade off.
---
Might be a cop? The cop in the first season was so cool, she was a twin of nurse joy iirc.
---
Rainbow map. I love running those.
---
Play killer
---
Dude c'mon he said they already told him about the guitar, its totally chill to let him in on it.
---
Nikkers.
---
I like how she even stopped for a second confused
---
Update: The dbd discord is saying it was removed, no known reason why though.
---
[removed]
---
I would say not Vigo but the person from last year's hollow blight. The guy who made the putride syrum.
---
In his diary, he mentions finding a book by Vigo. So he wouldn't be Vigo. The entity eventually finds him.
---
That's just how it is sometimes!
---
Yeah, tone doesn't translate too well over a text format unless you make it outlandish
---
I am still not a really big fan but I have to say so far what I seen I really do like only thing is some of the challenges are sorta ridiculous in my opinion. But I play enough of this game that I could prob complete this pass pretty fast give it take only cause I have no life at all though.
---
STAN LOONA
---
Lol you still believe those conspiracy theories
---
2 people downed 30 seconds into the match with Billy? He pretty much gets looped like a normal M1 killer, if 2 survs are going down in 30 seconds they must be practically throwing themselves at the killer...
---
I know people experienced this when their internet connection isn‚Äôt great, but when they move or connect to other routers it fixes itself.
---
did you even read my other comment? lol
---
playing immersed is not gonna work against any good killers. ever. but you probably play at rank 10.
---
Just because they're invisible? What does it matter if you won a coinflip and kept running when a huntress winds up or if you win a coinflip and left a pallet when a spirit was faking? You guess in both and you win in both
---
I‚Äôll do that when I have the time to, it would take a while to sift through those videos now for a reddit conversation.
---
dead by daylight hasn't had a lawsuit yet has it?
---
If you‚Äôre talking about me, its mostly a joke, gets me some hilarious messages from salty people in dbd and fps games
---
Because the game is a game, so you're all supposed to have fun and you want to give new players a good experience and welcome them.
---
This toxic bullshit mindset is a large part of why the playerbase is reducing to a few toxic players rather than expanding and becoming fun for everyone
---
idk how many people really hate the battle pass being implemented. i know certain people do but i see much much more either say "eh i dont want it i just wont buy it" and people saying "finally a reason to play the game beyond bloodpoints"
---
That's a good point, but it seems each Tome will revolve around 1 Survivor and 1 Killer. From what I've seen, most of the challenges are completely Survivor or Killer sided, which means that regardless of the Survivor or Killer used, you can complete the challenges.
---
This means the issue only appears on the Master Challenges, which are specific to certain characters. They're tough, but I imagine that even when playing with those level 1 characters, they're possible.
---
Regarding the Tomes being based on the DLC chapters - I don't think they'll go this way. The tomes are released every mid-chapter, so basically between the release of every chapter and the one after it, so the tome most likely will not be linked to the DLC's characters - like how Stranger Things came out and a while after the Tome focuses on the Trapper and Claudette. Most likely, they'll pick characters that are liked by the community and expand on them.
---
IIRC there‚Äôs a law that allows the original writers of a story to get the rights back after 35 years. The guy who wrote the first movie is causing a fuss over this law. They‚Äôre now arguing that he doesn‚Äôt have the rights to Jason Voorhees since he didn‚Äôt really show up until the second one and the signature hockey mask and machete after that.
---
Last I heard it could be going to the Supreme Court
---
You dont get the characters only the killer when you buy the ghostface chapter
---
You are clown shoes my friend.  For the third time I readily admitted the key is the biggest crutch survivor has.  Stop using it in your argument.  You cannot.  I agreed with you profusely.
---
Again do you not understand why the hatch is a necessity to preserve some form of balance in the game?  I explained the logic quite clearly.  Without it the game would be entirely too killer sided.  You arent entitled to an uncontestable 4K everytime you kill 3.  That's why the devs added the hatch.  So the last survivor has some chance of escape so it isn't just a free handout to killer.  Comprehend those words man.  
---
Moris you flat out declared arent crutches and now you reversed your stance on.  Be consistent.
---
I saw you flipped the logic but not all logic can be flipped.  Stating that it is reasonable to never go down consistently in your games as survivor is absurd.  Killers would have to be downright putrid for this to commonly happen.  I typically multi hook all my survivors.  That doesn't mean they're bad it means they got outplayed in chase.  It happens to the best of them.  A killer on the other hand can gameplan to end games with gens up consistently.  Run Pop, Ruin, BBQ and Dying Light on Freddy for some ez games of this.  I do it all the time.  I just finished a Legion game 5 mins ago with a gen up.  3K'd last dude found hatch before I could close.  This is the norm for me.  1 or more gens up in 75% of my games.  That isn't an argument you can flip.  It's easier to pressure gens and play aggressively than it is to be perfect in every single chase as a survivor.  Sometime you'll get downed.  Unless you're a useless Claudette urban emersion their way around the map waiting for their teamates to die for the hatch.  But that's a terrible and selfish playstyle.
---
It took me 3 days to upload ‚ÄúWhere is the hatch!‚Äù
---
Do what did u think of my vids?
---
Nobody said he did.... what are talking about lmao
---
This is awesome, keep it up
---
Nah, 4 stacks of BBQ and chili, boi!
---
I'm not sure if this is directed at me or not. Lmao.
---
Supposed to.
---
Lag hit probably.
---
Tbh though if a killer is very close behind me in a chase, I'll normally assume that they are trying to do the thing when they hit you and you throw the pallet at the same time, so they get a free pallet, or they are trying to bait a dead hard.
---
If you wanna signal to a surv that you want to farm, stop at a pallet loop and either shake your head or like spin around really slowly and smack at a genny or something.
---
Sometimes survs just don't get it or don't want to farm, I get that.
---
Hatch is an alternate escape. Aren‚Äôt you satisfied? /s
---
When I play with friends, the game ‚Äúerrors‚Äù after the match. Then we all have to restart the game to play another match. Its very annoying that this is still an issue after 2 months. Instead of trying to get more money from a BattlePass, they should REALLY fix this issue.
---
That was clutch! Do you find bucking bronco is worth the slot? I haven't tested it at all.
---
A truly golden shitpost.
---
It‚Äôs currently free on Xbox one. Been playing it with friends and it‚Äôs actually kind of fun. I don‚Äôt see myself playing it long term since it isn‚Äôt polished at all. But it is rather entertaining.
---
What? New girl?
---
For 2 games
---
Another battle pass..
---
Nurse? Spirit? 
---
Camping Leatherface?
---
Oh you know they so desperately want love to do it. 
---
They came out with that bullshit "survey" a few months back asking us if we would like a battle pass,then never told us the results of that survey. Then less than a month later leakers find that a battle pass is already in a future development build and on the way. Which clearly showed that they had already been working on a battle pass long ago, maybe even a year before they asked us about it in that survey. That survey was just to gauge how many saps would be up for it. I'm sure the answer to the survey was resounding NO and that's why they never showed us the result from it as well.
---
They are underhanded. Three fucking years the Trapper has been low tier. They don't have time to fix him, but they have time to create a fucking battle pass.
---
I like this perk a lot. I would normally suggest Dead Hard, but it's so buggy for me lately. I find Balanced Landing a lot more consistent.
---
I can't relate. Once you enter Bubba's basement, you don't leave.
---
What you're describing is pretty overcomplicated. A new killer doesn't have to have new powers. Not sure what is possible with the lawsuit and what isn't, but they could just make a new map, remove the audio of pamela's voice and introduce a new killer who plays exactly the same like jason did.
---
Not saying this doesn't require some work, but honestly, most of the code is still there and not much would have to be changed, the main problem is that they'd have to replace many models
---
This is brilliant lmao great job man!
---
Also this is coming from a killer main so non bias just calling it how I see it.
---
Watch videos on different strategies, characters, and perks. 
---
And remember, the game isn‚Äôt about the escape. It‚Äôs about the chase, the bloodpoints. Of course, the objective in the trail is to escape but the game is truly about character building. There‚Äôs a learning curve but it‚Äôs not as bad as games like Fortnite and CS:GO. Just be patient and study the game. 
---
Also rank reset was pretty recent, wait a week for all the reset players to get back to their usual rank. Right now, you‚Äôre probably being matched with killers that usually sit within ranks 10-8. Frustrating, but good practice.
---
This is downvoted, but DH hasn't worked properly since dedicated servers. You used to be able to hit it right when you heard the killer swing their weapon, even with terrible ping. But now you can hit it early enough to register and see the "exhausted" effect and the DH symbol pop up and go into cool down but you still get hit the moment you start to dash. Very annoying. Dedicated servers have a lot of kinks to be worked out because now the delay is exponentially worse.
---
Dbd, balance wise, is still much worse lmao. Jason got buffed heavy and is now a threat mid game rather than right when people are escaping. 
---
Also, dbd switch is pretty awful anyways. I hope it gets the "optimization" consoles will be getting. Along with just general improvements.
---
You forgot Demogorgon (Stranger Things)
---
People who think the clown is hot are also the type of people who don't eat the end pieces of the loaf of bread, A.K.A scum of the earth.
---
Do you have these in prints or even better stickers ??
---
That was hilarious! Adding the layers of DBD into this made it so perfect. I laughed all the way to the end.
---
I also kind of expected the Entity to appear and eat him, but I guess not.
---
\*Croes Mad\*
---
No no my name is one of ‚Äúthose‚Äù too I just feel for the kid. Also that drawing is like my favorite thing now I want a little brother just so I can have one
---
Games that have battle passes usually are free to play and have little to no ‚Äúgrind‚Äù to unlock content (Fortnite and Apex being the most popular examples of successful games with a battle pass). DBD is a $20 game that has DLC characters and perks locked behind a paywall, sells cosmetics in a store, and already has a ridiculous bloodpoint grind.
---
The battle pass is completely unnecessary, doesnt even fit the game.
---
*caw intensifies*
---
The way this loops it just looks like you're walking down an infinite shelf and moving boxes over and over
---
I just watched "Where is the hatch" and from what i can tell youre on the right track, people like watching gameplay footage but are easily irritated by constant annoying talking, you seem to talk the right amount üëç
---
You also dont play that badly, which isnt important anyway.
---
I recommend asking reddit and googling best ways for you to record cleaner videos so you dont use the ipad, people hate recordings of a screen using another device, if you have to always film in landscape view (landscape filming is holing the phone sideways the the video is wide and not tall). Ask a family member for help finding good ways to record your screen if you cant figure it out, if youre on xbox i think theres an in built feature to record but i dont know, ive never owmed an xbox.
---
My main thing is that you dont get discouraged, the internet is heartless and you will be called a lot of horrible things and hear a lot of hurtful things, people do it for fun, so be ready and be careful of that, know that youre better than anyone who is toxic, never ever become a hateful toxic person dogelord.
---
Basically, youre on the right track, just occasionally watch your own videos before uploading and check if your voice is too loud or too quiet, avoid being annoying like saying "ohmygodohmygod that was epic bro" and all that annoying stuff, just be you and be comfortable shen making videos and people will like them more, youre doing good mate, over timd you will be better. Keep it up.
---
&gt;  For the third time I readily admitted the key is the biggest crutch survivor has.
---
I never said you didn't say keys weren't a crutch, you did however say Adrenaline, the hatch and EGC aren't.
---
&gt;Again do you not understand why the hatch is a necessity to preserve some form of balance in the game?
---
I understand perfectly what you're saying, you either don't understand what I'm saying or are being intentionally obtuse. Giving the survivors who failed a 2nd, 3rd or 4th chance is no more "balanced" than Noed. They both reward failing their sides primary objective. The difference is I'm not a hypocrite with my opinion whereas you are.
---
&gt;You arent entitled to an uncontestable 4K everytime you kill 3. That's why the devs added the hatch. So the last survivor has some chance of escape so it isn't just a free handout to killer.
---
The killer succeeded in stopping the survivors completing their one and only objective and are rewarded with more chances by doing nothing. It's not about being "entitled" to the 4k, the killer literally earned it by stopping the survivors completing their objective. Comprehend these words boy.
---
&gt;Moris you flat out declared arent crutches
---
Sarcastically. Which I assumed was obvious to anyone over the age of 5. I was pointing out your hypocrisy.
---
&gt;I saw you flipped the logic but not all logic can be flipped
---
Sure you did buddy. I this case it absolutely can because all of the things I listed are crutch perks/mechanics that reward despite failure on both sides. They are completely comparable.
---
&gt;This is the norm for me. 1 or more gens up in 75% of my games.
---
lol. Spoken like a green/yellow rank that's never faced optimal survivors. I wish I could get some potatoes like you apparently so often do.
---
The fact that you continue to (I assume deliberately) misconstrue what I'm saying or concede how hypocritical you're being shows you're just the typical entitled survivor main and/or a 5 year old.
---
To grow my channel and bring u entertainment
---
Ah I see what you're saying. I feel like Gracen isnt too bad tho. I've also lived with him for the past 8 years tho soooo
---
 **Are there any good perks/add-ons/offerings I should start out with?** 
---
Whispers, Corrupt Intervention, BBQ, Sloppy
---
  **What killer should I start out with?** 
---
Freddy, Myers, Spirit, Hag
---
 **is there any scenario where camping would be OK**? 
---
Sometimes you might have to camp. Even Tru3 camps once in a while to secure struggle hooks. I wouldn't recommend camping as a strategy though. 
---
**Are there any tips, advanced or beginner that would help me**? 
---
Don't get discouraged. Playing killer can be very stressful especially when you start to climb. Learn how to find survivors and build your map awareness.
---
Ah it‚Äôs okay. I just had so much potential. For example, I had a billy facecamp me while reving his chainsaw. Didn‚Äôt tbag, didn‚Äôt have any items, was solo. At the end of the game he wanted me to be salty saying he ‚Äúsustained on the salt‚Äù pathetic. And saying I‚Äôm an idiot for allowing him to facecamp
---
Honestly the least dickish way to "proofreading check" someone, you deserve many upvotes for outstanding behavior.üôè
---
This has to be on console LMAO
---
I met some amazing people on F13, but I also met some of the worst people. In general, yeah, maybe less toxic because there are 8 people playing at once so it doesn't seem like every single person is toxic (vs the 5 in DBD where if one person is toxic, that's a lot). But there's also voice chat in F13 and people have been ridiculously rude and nasty for no reason, and some of them turned into creepy stalkers who switched to DBD and take out their anger on my group still when we cross paths.
---
Who cares? Angrypug is an asshole.
---
I never played it but I heard good things about it. Bummer they had licensing issues and it'll never change.
---
???
---
This is requiem
---
I don‚Äôt know why they added The Rift, the archives would have been fine on it‚Äôs own and we really didn‚Äôt need a battlepass let alone more micro transactions.
---
The ‚Äúobjectives‚Äù the battle pass give are complete trash too and do the opposite of what people have been asking for. ‚ÄúThrow 5 pallets in a chase‚Äù, ‚Äúunhook 2 survivors in a single match‚Äù, etc...Thats going to make people throw the game, farm teammates or whatever to get their challenge done.
---
Nothing to do with a second objective, no idea what that guy is talking about
---
I always had the execution equipped where I raise the counselor above my head and then drop them head first on the ground. Whenever I did this killing animation I yelled "AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA". The best times were when they started laughing and then abruptly got cut off by death
---
Damn it, I'm getting nostalgia
---
Criticism = bad on reddit. If you dont constantly shill and praise developers no matter what they do you are a ‚Äútroll‚Äù. They‚Äôre just mindless consumer drones.
---
Yes
---
Oh I never had that experience honestly. I just had goofy Jason‚Äôs. I genuinely can‚Äôt remember anyone being actually toxic. Part of me wants dbd to have voice chat so it could be goofy and funny like f13. But I know the outcome could be horrible
---
It's already been explained by the dude above that it's a ttv tryna farm juke montages off of baby killers with his swf. Dude's trashy as can be
---
No kidding man
---
I also have almost 2,000 hours in F13 so I may have played more lol.
---
To be honest, I'm the kind of guy who is absolutely too anxious to play as a Survivor. I tried a few times and my stress levels simply go over the roof in the games, so I usually play Killer instead.
---
I watch streamers play as Survivors which is kind of letting them play for me, I guess? I watch some who are very entertaining and most of them actually explain the moves, strategy and mistakes for themselves or other players in the game. Some are really fun to watch.
---
Monto for example cuts the video when he just does a generator with nothing happening, and during chases he gets really thrilled.
---
I thought it was a great mechanic to be honest
---
That's an exaggeration to how fast he can dish out pressure. Someone downed or hook = At least 2 people are forced not to do gens for some amount of time.
---
The more tricks you know and how well you run tiles can mean you get that pressure in earlier. He's definitely *not* a basic M1 killer.
---
Awful graphics? The graphics aren't even that bad.
---
They are a company, of course they STILL want money. Just like any other company does in order to survive.
---
I personally don't ever camp intentionally and don't go out of my way to tunnel (in other words I just go for the person that should take the least amount of my time to down).
---
but then if survivors are gonna hand the win to be and bundle up then of course I'm going to slug. makes the most sense.
---
Because the killer is OP, and no one cooperates with each other so no objective is done.
---
In its current state, I would say counsellor is a much harder role than survivors in DBD.
---
You're already dead.
---
&gt; More like you want that product to be the way you want it.
---
I simply want it better than it is. The game has so much potential but BHVR fails to capitalize on it with it's poor decision making, and lack of focus on the most important issues.
---
&gt; They made it clear it is all cosmetic and nothing else.
---
It's currently cosmetics, but that's currently. BHVR lies all the time. They are saying that it'll just take around 70 hours to get everything in the Archives, but Paulie calculated that it'll actually be closer to 140 or so hours. BHVR are also going to (not "may" but going to) add challenges for DLC characters, forcing you to buy those characters or their perks if you want to complete all their challenges https://imgur.com/cYxkooL I'm sure they have some other sly money grabs in mind. Trust BHVR's actions everyone, not their words.
---
&gt; You didn‚Äôt even address how the game is marked down to $30.
---
Companies mark down games all the time when they want to increase sales. Big freakin deal. The game will never be $0 so it should never have a Battle Pass period. Even if the game costed 1 dollar I would still say it shouldn't have a Battle Pass. Paid games should not have Battle Passes. ALL paid games.
---
&gt; If BHVR did some BS like locking everything behind a lootbox, I of course would be livid.
---
Usually large companies try that while smaller companies shy away from it. The only thing keeping BHVR from doing that is that they have somewhat of a cult following and don't want to piss off loyal consumers more than they have. One little push would lead to a mass exodus.
---
&gt; But I do not understand all this hate for COSMETIC items. Moreover, cosmetics that are bright which would make your games harder if anything. Some are basic recolors of existing skins.
---
It's not the cosmetics (which again, is all it is for NOW, but it may be more than cosmetics in the future). It's about the principle of a paid game having a battle pass. In this case, the devs are tempting you to buy the pass for the auric cells. The bait is "you'll be able to use these cells to buy future DLCs/characters or future Battle Passes, just give us some more money".
---
&gt;  I hate shitty monetization schemes, but they are just skins nothing more.
---
For now. Battle Passes always start off small, always start off as "we're not pay to win", and then things change. Hasn't failed once. Battle Pass didn't become a dirty phrase over innuendo and speculation. It became a dirty phrase because of timed and true history.

Thats because all switch games are stupidly overpriced.

How'd that guy only get 19 points?
---
An AHS killing would be so dope so many to choose from
---
The environments I guess but the character models are god awful. Especially at the starting cutscene. However i would not in a million years change that as it is some of the funniest shit I have seen
---
Well if it affects me and my friends every single time we have played for the past 2 months, then I am thinking it must affect a LOT more people than you think. In fact I remember the patch notes stating that they fixed it, but its still there lol.
---
Its a sex costume dude The Rubber is funny as shit.
---
Its less repetitive than DBD though...
---
This is amazing, it needs more upvotes!!!
---
Cause with spirit there never really is a reason to not leave the loop, unless it's super safe and you literally just wanna leave things to chance for both parties involved.
---
With huntress it's a point in the chase the survivor can choose to gamble. You take into account previous engagements and how much you both know about each other.
---
You extract nothing out of chases with spirit. That's why she's considered so boring. From your perspective she may as well just be nurse without a blink animation, because unless you've tested their limits you don't know exactly what combination of add-ons the spirit is running. Phases for 6 seconds? You could guess they would pop up "about now" on your pallet if they ran around the short distance of a loop. But they stay in phase for another 4 seconds? Well shit- she can literally be anywhere now. Oh well.
---
i mean...i havent seen any complaints of this bug except for you, so im pretty sure it isnt that widespread lmao
---
It‚Äôs a casual game not an honorable duty lol, if I‚Äôm not having fun playing a game then I‚Äôm probably gonna stop playing it.
---
I actually had that happen to me. My friend had a key and we were being chased they opened it and they got through and I had done the animation just as the hatch was being closed I even did the jump but it put me back in the match and I got instantly downed because they had noed.

I think the graphics are fine on character models, its the facial animations that are god awful.
---
There's also one of these that mentions 'The Alchemist'. Idk what it could mean but a killer ned the hunger could have awesome potential
---
Idk man sometimes killer is scarier.  You'll be walking through a pallet looking for survivors then WHAM!!! There was a P3 Claudette camping the pallet and you just ended up with brown pants

---
I think you mean *disappointed sigh*
---
Every 13th of the month
---
It was pretty much confirmed when ptb for the archives came out
---
Thats the main problem with friday13th that DBD totally managed to avoid. All maps, the killer and even the game's name are all dependent on a licence for friday13th, meanwhile, DBD has it's own identity and got licenced killers in as characters. If they actualy got some sort of lawsuit problem, worst case scenario, they change the character model and replace the backstory. With friday the 13th, only way they could have worked themselves out of the lawsuit was to build new maps with new assets and change charater models to original designs.
---
But this is also what I mean, when faced with a lawsuit like this, maybe other devs would have made a new game? Same mechanics, but original content.
---
Janes thiccness gravitated the beast back to her lol
---
You have to t-bag IRL if you down someone too.
---
Sorry that I'm correct, didn't realize that was uncivil; I'll be sure to consider it the next time I'm up against a bunch of illiterate imbeciles.
---
I stopped that when a hit at the gates without franklins was causing me to lose whatever item I was carrying and escaped with.
---
How utterly disgusting.

Completely indefensible behaviour. Who would project their fetishes, fixations and attractions onto fictional, supernatural killers in a horror video game?
---
Ignore my flair.
---
*Vacuum noises stop
---
If you flipped the pig head on the bottom upside down it make a killer card! (pun intended)
---
Time to buy the whole game all over again.
---
Ok but are you: playing nurse? Playing spirit? Using iri head huntress? Insta saw Billy? Insidious camping? Basement bubba?
---
DAMN I WANNA SEE THAT!
---
They are two differant games. I have over 400 hours on both games and yes they are similar but no they arent the same.
---
Smooth.
---
I mean he did create the character. Just because he didn't write him as a hulking monster that people know him as doesn't mean he didn't write the character. The lawsuit doesn't surprise me since F13 has always been a means to make money for just about everyone involved. There were some people who were very passionate about making them (Tom Savini), but most of the films were just cashing in on the slasher craze of the 80s.
---
I only teabag if they deserve it. I don't understand toxic undeserved behavior the community has.

---
You rang?
---
But that's basically Jason's whole character. I can't go make a show about Aang from avatar and say it's okay because he's 16 and not 12.
---
&gt; You‚Äôre entire comment just shows how unwilling you are to think of a different playstyle.
---
You can't really "sneak" against Spirit the same way you can use Nurse's slow movement speed and blinds after every blink against her. UNLESS you're *literally* sneaking all game, at which point gens aren't being done or you end up 3 genning yourself in the most inconvenient/ deadzone area of the map.
---
Plus, you act like people need to "adapt" a sneak style of gameplay, as though people go into this game knowing how to loop killers and run chases. Everyone and their fucking brother did sneaking for their first 50 hours of the game and eventually get tired of it. **Chases are fun.** It's really the only reason I play survivor, cause it sure as shit doesn't generate a decent amount of points, you get random draws queuing solo for teammates, and holding M1 on gens is not exciting.
---
So if my enjoyment from the game is meant to come from how well I can avoid any engagement with the killer all match, then I'm dropping survivor altogether. It's genuinely not fun for most people with above 500 hours to play that way when there's a whole part of DBD that's fun to master and get better in.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs plenty of ways to heal quickly and easily, especially with a team: Inner Strength, We‚Äôll Make It, Second Wind, Empathy, just bringing a med kit, etc. if you exclusively go for the big Adrenaline play that seems like a waste, but against some killers it‚Äôs a better choice.
---
Sure, but with any good team, even with ruin up gens should be done between 4-5 minutes. If you find more than 2 opportunities to pull off a full heal during that, you're either not helping the team rush the right generators or you're just farming points with your teammates, exchanging body blocks.
---
&gt;You can‚Äôt know 100%, but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs, y‚Äôknow, a game against other humans. 
---
Exactly. It's a multiplayer game. But vs Spirit it's practically not. You're not witnessing behaviour, reacting, adjusting- you're just crossing your fingers for the most part.
---
Because there's a cap yes
---
I was always for it. I even voted for it on the survey
---
One apple does all that. she needs an epi pen
---
Ah, so i will mark 13th as "level up Billy day"
---
There's a cap. Spend your bps

I mean probably yeah, maybe the entity will supply one

I'm only familiar with 1 and 2, but those would be great chapters. Personally for number 1, I'd be fine with either Mr.X+Leon OR Nemesis+Jill

no

Idk other places have the same stuff for half the price, peetty sure they just overprice a lot of stuff tbh

NEVER SEEN A TOXIC JANE? HOOWWWW

Again I love how it's always the players that "don't" use NOED that sound off on these boards defending it as not a crutch.  Sure my man.
---
Bro if you as a survivor are literally hiding around the map doing nothing the chances of 5 gens popping period isn't likely.  You're talking about a 3v1 game.  Killers tend to clean up in those.  You understand that line of logic right?  Again you cannot flip everything to the opposite.  Some lines of logic simply don't translate.  It hurts that you don't get this.
---
You were legit defending moris.  You made arguments supporting them absolutely fuck off with that noise because it's disingenuous and sad.
---
Lol!  Oh my god another one of these clowns.  If you're just going to accuse me of lying about my game time and rank you can fuck off right now we have nothing more to say to each other.  I'm a 50/50 player that started playing about 3 months prior to the Wraith Cube.  I easily have over 3K hours in at this point and used to hit rank 1 (NO NOED CRUTCH) playing Old Freddy, Trapper, and Wraith as my primary mains.  I've since started playing a lot of survivor too about a year agoish so I usually end killer closer to rank 3 these days since my playtime is more split.  I began the game as a killer main initially.  I don't lie online it's pathetic and it doesn't add inches to my dick to do so.  It's clear this conversation has run its course though.  You're an entitled player that thinks killers deserve to 4K uncontested everytime they kill 3 and that survivors not going down a single time is a reasonable approach to playing killer but playing optimal killer games and ending them with gens up is not.  It doesn't get any more mindlessly biased than that.  Have a good one man.
---
This is a masterpiece. I laughed, I cried. You should make the whole movie like this!
---
Actually they said no one is under 21
---
The checkers analogy is terrible because, as I mentioned, it‚Äôs an asymmetrical game.  Both sides are not and cannot ever be equal.  It‚Äôs baked into the game.  Wanting the experiences to be similar is just not likely.
---
I am in agreement that survivor isn‚Äôt very fun.  That is not a criticism of Spirit though.  Quite frankly most of the points you bring up are great examples of why survivors need an overhaul and there needs to be some sort of secondary objective.  As it stands, games end quickly and survivor gameplay is mostly boring.
---
None of these are reasons to make Spirit worse.  They are all reasons to add more dimension to playing survivor.
---
Eh, the last time I watched F13 there were counselors with infinite pocket knives, which was the nail on the coffin for me. I loved playing that game as well as watching AngryPug play that game, but after watching infinite pocket knive exploiters it completely ruined the game for me now.
---
So I don't blame the current Jason's avoiding grabbing counselors now.
---
Ace and David would 400% slap a kid.

make claudette's clothes blindingly bright,

so bright infact that it flashlight stuns the killer if they look in their general direction

Game was super fun to troll. VOIP and teamkilling as the camp kids was hilarious. I wish I could do it all over again.
---
I kinda got off track and forgot the context of the video. My bad. We're in total agreement. I've just seen a lot of  rationalization around shitty DCing and got on a soap box, I guess.
---
Im ever seen the meme there‚Äôs probably people like me, i try cross post cause i find it funny buy didn‚Äôt let me... I u already saw the meme just move on.. u probably are like those surv that ms da killer in the end just move on
---
It was endgame collapse so I can't really blame them for camping if he was camping the whole game that's a different story.
---
We all know the hottest killer is Clown anyways.
---
*ruin* it
---
Absolutely go fuck yourself if you're going to double down on the liar thing.  I haven't lied about a single thing not my rank, my game time, experience absolutely nothing.  Any shred of respect I could have feigned for you has been lost.  I'm not going to talk to a troll that's just gonna accuse me of lying about my experience with this game.  Have a great night accusing people of being full of shit instead of engaging in an actual debate.  Later.

That was a wild ride
---
Ah my other favorite killer. Amazing job
---
# **WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP**
---
It‚Äôs Friday night post T-pose Claudette
---
I'm a killer main.
---
mind giving some explanation? Ive heard lithe is actually pretty nifty
---
Why are Adam and Tap so rare then?
---
Is there any way for the killer to prevent the survivor from getting hatch in a situation like this?
---
1. Dead Hard: good in every situation.
---
2. Balanced Landing: map dependent but gives more control to the survivor.
---
3. Head On: makes lockers viable and can come in clutch.
---
Oof
---
She was in college lol
---
Cheers mate probably a good one..
---
Amazing!
---
I want to argue this but I do also hate end loafs. Crust is awful I don't want a giant piece of crust
---
Just chasing a survivor "yo hold up" she just pops her epi pen
---
Adding on to what u/Dragathor said. Not to mention, once you get caught, that's just it. You're out. Never to be rescued or revived. You can spend an upwards of 30 minutes trying to get into a good match and have it be over for you in less than 2 minutes if you're unlucky enough. Sure you can come back as Tommy Jarvis, but that's only 1 out of the 7 counselors in the game and it's not even guaranteed.
---
Not you, the guy in the video.
---
If you look at his yellow flashlight it literally says M1.....
---
Well, your loss :(
---
Bill's is incredibly powerful and the idea itself would rake a lot of balancing, but it could be interesting
---
Add ons for survivors are just items and their add ons
---
\#bestiality?
---
Oh yeah, they could trap the last survivor in a corner with body block when all 3 are dead amd hatch isnt closed, other than that, no they cant yeah.
---
Trist me there is way worse, this fits right in
---
&gt; You wont, you'll come up with some inane excuse because the simple answer is you can't.
---
Checkmate liar.
---
I think they're just outside characters you dont see, kinda like Benedict Baker or Vigo
---
downed me, waited for me to crawl for hatch, closed the hatch, dropped me by ruin, waited for the collapse to near the end then picked me up to prolong it a little longer
---
You're gonna get a lot of different answers on this.  And numerous lists will have merit.  Here's mine.
---
1.Adrenaline
---
2. Dead Hard
---
3. Balanced
---
4. Head On
---
5. Lithe (Good perk but window hitboxes are absurd)
---
6. Sprint Burst (I loathe walking when I should be running to not waste time and that's what it takes to preserve the cooldown)
---
Nea is immediately unlocked for free, just put the Bloodpoints into her and put the 2,000 Shards towards something else like a new character.
---
Groovy Killer Ash on Xbox, feel free to add! I‚Äôm not the greatest, but I‚Äôm down to play anything on a semi casual level. Going for wins, but I‚Äôm also not one to get worked up over a loss or overall bad match.
---
I try to be nice and let one go, but I‚Äôm new so it‚Äôs a little harder since I don‚Äôt know where the hatch spawns like at all. Some people still get the idea, but it‚Äôs really frustrating when they don‚Äôt
---
I love it when survivors get themselves killed bm'ing.  Legit instant karma there.  Congrats on killing the little turd.
---
How do you get the new Michael skin? I main him and think it's a cool skin bit hace no clue how to get it :(
---
KiidKoding on PS4, CidCoding on steam. Mics required, looking for some SWF! (: EST. DM me/comment if you're interested.
---
Love how survivors get offended when killers bm as if they dont
---
Letting it kill me because our lord and savior the entity deserved the souls of all
---
Quite the opposite, cranky because people like you don't want to welcome new players and still complain about all these "toxic survivors" when all you do is ruin everyone's fun until only the toxic survivors want to play and bully the new killers, starting a vicious cycle.
---
I have been given a free win ONCE, and I never felt entitled to it just confused until he said he was doing a daily and was a survivor main. I knew I didn't earn it but that doesn't mean I wasn't happy for the extra few points and such. I play both sides and I'm fine with giving someone the hatch if I feel like they were put at a disadvantage because of other players or because they simply played well.
---
It's not about free wins, it's about better experiences with the other side and respecting each other mutually. Follow the example of people like Otz
---
fun fact if you pause it the right way when the hunter is falling to his death you can see skull in his eyes
---
I'm not saying that at all.
---
But from the killer's perspective, when games like this happen you wish you had NOED.
---
It can break certain maps, its top 3 exhaustion perks
---
Survive with friends 2: electric boogaloo
---
NOPE. None of the above! Which makes it even more ridiculous!!!
---
NOPE.
---
Your body looks more like Michael but its still dope!
---
I mean, the mentality of a typical ghostface main is there, but it's missing the NOED that's supposed to go with ruin.
---
I‚Äôm survivor
---
This is with Killer iridescent addons in mind, Tbh a lot of survivor perks are pretty weak in comparison to them but MOM needs a build up to proc, The idea of add ons is to offer an immediate benefit to balance the game with those in mind since I haven't heard any talk of them being changed. It's all just a community suggestion and the first variation at that, even though i do think the suggestions through with my knowledge of the game (leading to mix ups with perks I'm unfamiliar with such as mom)

F13 sounds epic in concept, cause it's similar but not identical to DbD but it was so poorly executed with such an advanced engine that it pisses me off

True, it could have kept a dedicated playerbase if they fixed many issues with it. I LOVED playing jason but hated counselor. Wish their was like a lobby queue for him instead of just hoping
---
well he was stalking you...
---
Wow.  That. Was pretty damned amazing.
---
That‚Äôs exactly why they didn‚Äôt include them in the PTB
---
Still doesn't feel great to die just to come back and slap a killer in the face
---
Lmao!
---
Roshambo!!
---
It‚Äôs like dwights in the survivors screen
---
Ok! Thanks!
---
It was very frustrating to fight as a killer and had very little counterplay short of the survivor going down near a hook. The only counterplay was something that felt cheesy to both sides. It needed to be changed to what it is now, lol

I did. All the links I found were dead, including discord.gg/deadbydaylight.
---
On consoles as well?
---
Plus I feel a lot of the people against it aren't in the shoes of the people who need this, a good amount of player's have NOTHING to grind towards other than prestige levels for new chapter. Hardcore/OG players already have all their perk set ups on their favorite killers/survivors. They have their build ideas, they have tier 3 prestige on their preferred characters, they've got nothing to work towards anymore in general so a battlepass is great in that regard, it gives life to their gameplay even if for awhile so they actually have something other than little moments of satisfaction to gain from playing.
---
leave him the killer dosent have any reason to leave the hook
---
Have to agree.

This is why I, as a last survivor, never struggle.  Hoping for the hatch.  Sometimes works; sometimes doesn't.  If it does, I say, "gg, thanks" but if it doesn't, I just say, "gg".
---
Dead hard-ing right past you
---
Ok
---
Thanks. :) I was considering myers for next year and then following it up with the rest of the iconic killers the following years. I'm really diggin the Sam killer from trick 'r treat but I'm not short so I have no idea how I'm gonna pull that off if I even decide to do it.
---
AND a killer?
---
whoa, keep it PG Behavior....
---
Wow a fucking battle pass, the worst monetization practice invented so far. Just pay a subscription fee for the privilege of grinding. üôÑ
---
Watch him as he goes
---
what?
---
Huh TiL
---
I don't think it should work that way but that actually makes a lot of sense why sometimes people don't pop me out of stealth when I feel they should
---
The lawsuit hit and the game is no longer supported eh. But then they come out with a switch version. I feel sorry for whoever bought it.
---
Also promotes tunneling to get your power faster, probably not good for the game
---
Getting stunned by a piece of wood is scarier than a tormented, shrieking, japanese spirit coming at you with a katana or a disgusting, deranged clown sucking on the wet end of your freshly dismembered finger? I think not.

On the next page it says Clown has good map pressure.
---
Pretty sure you can turn that off in KYF, not sure haven't played KYF in awhile

ill explain how it happens.
---
killer downs surv1
---
killer goes to basement
---
killer hooks surv1
---
killer waits
---
surv2 goes to unhook surv1
---
surv2 gets hit before fully removing surv1 from hook or gets grabbed 
---
surv2 gets hit again or if grabbed gets hook in basement
---
killer waits  
---
surv3 sees that both surv1 and 2 and hooked

surv3 goes to save them.

surv3 gets hit but unhooks surv 1

killer downs surv3

surv1 unhooks surv2, surv 1 inturn is downed

surv2 tries to leave basement but is either caught or gets body blocked 
---
surv4 me

Thank you sir

i don‚Äôt play swf

Lithe, alert, small game, self care
---
The free track is there to tease the one that costs money, you moron.
---
Self, DS, (deliverance but I don‚Äôt have it) and spine
---
Also a fair point. Maybe some sort of balance, requiring you to hook multiple survivors at least once? 1 hook gives a base decoy that the survivors can destroy like a totem, per survivor. 2 gives the screeching decoy, still breakable. 3 gives a ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù that runs in circles and screams. Something that progresses
---
Ehhh i made it a realistic comment instead.
---
Distortion, Dark Sense, Aftercare, and Adrenaline have been what I've run lately. Sometimes I run Urban Evasion, and I'll put on Calm Spirit when I'm sick of the Doctor.
---
They keep releasing content after 3 years. They're a business; what motivation do you think they have besides money? They can sell their cosmetics and keep releasing content. It helps keep the game alive.
---
Adrenaline, We're Gonna Live Forever, We'll Make It, and Empathy
---
Get balanced landing asap you can turn that useless red harvester on coldwind into an infinite

This is so accurate.. ü§£ü§£

Yeah feels like there's a higher chance of getting rubber banded right out of it and then being hooked.

Imagine being a part of his following üòÇ

I love Aftercare when I've used it in KYF, but I dont have it lol. I personally think it's a competitor to Bond (or better).
---
I didn't even see that damn.
---
This hits too close to home.
---
6 cosmetic pieces worth.
---
so 60 vials total.
---
I think this is only a problem in certain maps with certain killers, for killers such as trapper and wraith I feel like increased distance overall in the game would make the endgame much harder for killer
---
Imagine not knowing officer jenny
---
This build is interesting. I've never seen a build like this before lmao.
---
It's only vials of Serum.
---
Unbreakable definitely
---
Yeah I wish I had deliverance too. Pretty easy to activate it and a clutch perk. Would've escaped much more games with it.
---
Spine Chill, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, and then I switch between Decisive and Borrowed depending on if im in a SWF or not
---
I actually just got shattered bloodline, so I just need the teachables. I‚Äôm going to run different builds on different characters
---
I don't think of the word 'gay' as exclusively male.
---
so glad this game is almost dead on consoles
---
only pc idiots stil give money to bhvr
---
eh it‚Äôs a dumb system anyways, you‚Äôre just adding to the conversation, no reason to downvote you. People would probably love The Alchemist any which way.
---
Spine Chill, Borrowed Time, Dead Hard or WGLF, last place I usually go Unbreakable or We'll Make It
---
Fixated, Dead Hard, Adrenaline and Stake Out.
---
Just perks I think are fun tbh.
---
Yeah, I think dbd players are clowns too
---
I was originally opposed just because of how other battle passes have been done. It's not just a "fortnite bad" mindset. It was in black ops 4 and was absolutely dogshit. Also the initial leaks showed you were going to get bloodpoints on the paid path. Even if it's small amounts of bloodpoints, I do not like the idea of paying money to reduce the game's grind.
---
I've since then, changed my opinion now that they've revealed more and more about the pass and how it will work. It seems very consumer friendly.
---
Did people find the quality of the pass cosmetics to be worth it?
---
What was involved in earning the auric cells back?
---
Even if it isn't the next killer who's to say they won't add an alchemist inspired killer someday down the future?
---
Probably should fix the grammar to match your edit.
---
Listen you fucking troglodyte, if you play only on the free track and make it to the end, THEN purchase the premium, the rewards are retroactive. There are auric cells you get back equaling the amount you paid for. LITERALLY FREE. And if you don‚Äôt make it to the end, just don‚Äôt buy the pass and keep playing normally and get free shit. 
---
Watch the fucking video before you open your mouth.
---
Uh Hallowed be thy name.
---
This shit makes me feel so much better knowing I'm not the only killer making dummy ass moves lol
---
‚ÄúWhat are talking about‚Äù
---
ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT?
---
Fair. Some people just read a situation differently.
---
Thanx!
---
Here‚Äôs a thought. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it
---
Yes, that‚Äôs true, but the ghostface chapter comes with an exclusive cosmetic that you can‚Äôt get if you buy the character with auric cells.
---

---
shattered bloodline is probably the best dlc to buy imo. you get a good survivor with good perks, and you get a top tier killer (spirit)
---
Sometimes people jump to conclutions way too quickly on both sides
---
If they get enough reports they can get a band. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a absurd number. Also I believe dbd does suspensions as well.
---
exactly or he‚Äôs good now and then turns bad etc
---
Dude, everything's a service nowadays. No one has the money for this kinda crap? Every games got a battle pass, every game's got some form of microtransactions. So many different kinds of subscription services...Netflix, Stan, Disney+, etc. 
---
I don't know why having more of this is a good thing...I just want to bug a game and have all of it...
---
Sprint Burst. Self Care. Spine Chill. Adrenaline or Unbreakable (I alternate between the two ‚Äî leaning towards adrenaline more imo)
---
Adrenaline is a life saver but dead hard and balanced and all those exhaustion perks can be very useful in chases
---
No one likes a blendette

illucide on PS4. I'm mainly wanting to test flashlight locations and vault blinds. But if you want to play some good ol' public games that's cool!
---
DS, self, bond , tech
---
unhook so you have bait
---
As far as I can tell you dont get bloodpoints from the rift(battle pass) only auric cells to basically cover the purchase, and bloodpoints from the arcives(free quests for everyone).  As long as it stays like this with no pay for progress, and just more cosmetics in the pay rifts im good with the addition.  Gives me a reason to play other survivors
---
Why would you ever play a game with the purpose to grind, though? You don't play to have fun? I don't see grinding 24/7 as fun.
---
Never said I would.
---
Shall we oink now or oink later
---
I quite like Inner Strength too, but it's not as good. Her third perk is awful unfortunately. But yeah highly recommend Fixated. In my opinion it's better than Urban.
---
&gt;As far as I can tell you dont get bloodpoints from the rift(battle pass) only auric cells
---
yes this is correct. but when there were leaks about the battle pass, a long while ago at this point, it had bloodpoints in it.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
The opposite is also true though. The gates can bi spaced at literal opposite ends of the map that makes them impossible for the killer to defend. Lerys is the best example of this, just wait for the killer to check the gate your at, and you'll get it up before they can get back, without exception.
---
lmao look at this dumb kid getting mad on the internet and acting smart to hide his anger
---
I hope so, but I'm already skeptical it might be bad and if others have had a bad experience with it I think I'll pass. I wouldn't care if it was as cheap as it is on PC :/
---
No that's called prayer beads
---
Agreed. I don't know why people want to spend more money. Like, do they not realise that if the prices for micros were changed, or the amount of them in game the game were lowered, it'd help all of us? I really don't get why people want to spend more money...?

---
Good to know!
---
yeah but the game's gonna be toxic regardless, and not giving hatch isn't toxic. Sometimes I need the kill for a pip, yes I've had games where I did so well I'd've lost if I gave the last survivor a free escape, besides it's not really fun to be given a free escape it just ruins the fun of the endgame where I could outplay the killer and "earn" my escape but that's immediately taken away for a dry taste in my mouth as I'm given my win, no idea where you were given the idea I was toxic personally but no, unless I feel you were held back by your teammates or were farmed or didn't teabag me in a group of people that did, you will not be getting your escape if I have that choice.
---
My number of Auric Cells has not changed after doing this. Yes it isn‚Äôt technically free because I paid $10 for it but what I gained is everything on a premium track and the cost of that track. You must be either stingy with money or broke to not see a conversion like this.
---
Now that's one immersed ghost face.

Apparently not. üòàüòà

fixated helped me find out how many seconds your scratch marks are visible for lol. the walking speed is also a plus because once you start running you just feel like you have a ‚Äòspeed boost‚Äô the whole time lol ! bond is really great as well, helps with locating your teammates when you‚Äôre injured, and if they‚Äôre in your range you could even see when they‚Äôre being chased. they‚Äôre my favorite perks in the game lmao c:
---
From what I think it‚Äôs from someone who feels very entitled. 
---
If they think the killer lagged hit or if it‚Äôs a killer they don‚Äôt like.
---
When I‚Äôm on Lery‚Äôs I usually stay at one exit, walk a little away and keep coming back to the same exit. Works 50% of the time. So no it‚Äôs not impossible.
---
Looks like you have all the meta perks already, so why not right?
---
thanks so much for the detailed description! this build seems fun for gen rushing and i would probably do Detectives Hunch, Stake Out, Prove Thyself, and Better Together. I personally think that would be great for gen rushing lmao. Detectives for finding the next gens quicker, Stake Out for obvious reasons, Prove Thyself for obvious reasons, and better together to get your prove thyself working. May try this build out in the future. Thanks!
---
Like "haha you suck", "get owned", "ez 4 man escape", or "git gud and learn to kill people", "lol you camp and still lose you suck".
---
If you get any of these messages its probably time to watch some otzdarva and improve your game.
---
It sucks that the free battlePA$$ is nothing but event serums (+ some garbage items) which should just drop separately during the event. 
---
Pass.
---
never really liked sprint burst. i get super bored if im walking the whole time since its not my playstyle. if i were to ever use it, i would use fixated as well.
---
Its not that we started playing with the intention to grind but you have to understand, nothing is new to us. Those of us that have been playing a long time only see it as a grind now mostly because we've been and done everything. I've been red rank every single time I've wanted, I've experimented with builds, I've done meme shit. I need something to work towards now, something to reignite the fun for me. It happens when you play a game for a long amount of time, sure its fun but its not as fun as it used to be, incentive to play would make it more fun, which is the battle pass for me.
---
you should live stream like that on twitch

Woahhh.. slow down now. Can't put all your cards on the table at once. Gotta wait for the sequel for this.
---
He said "if I only make it partway through then I'd only be getting 400 cells back"
---
Yeah adrenaline is op! Yeah exhaustion perks make all the difference in a chase, I think lithe is my favourite, especially paired with dance with me.
---
Just play on the free pass and if you make it to the end, get the premium, the rewards are retroactive and get your cells back.
---
Dude, no. They're not making money to keep the lights on. Can we please stop with this misinformation? Estimates are that BHVR has 200-500+ employees, and that they make 50-100 million AUD a year. This is not indie developer status. This is not a "so that they can survive" moment.
---
I‚Äôm inclined to agree. There‚Äôs a couple of killers I loathe going against but it just seems to do more harm than good to DC (hinders other survs, deranking, no BP). 
---
It just seems not worth it in my mind, but obviously others don‚Äôt care, I guess?
---
The game was originally a love letter to slashers before it became f13, had they not taken the deal it would still be around
---
I mean, better together isn't horrible if you are running prove thyself or something, but yeah, still a trash tier perk.
---
I‚Äôm gonna disagree with you on that one. Sometimes when people say racist shit they‚Äôre actually racist and mean what they say.
---
but... but... tate?
---
That's a weird way to spell "No Skill Killer" but alright
---
Hey I also killed a lil loops ahoy!
---
template?
---
dead hard is just better for looping and i like to run the killer around.
---
oof I know I know
---
I dont find this game *that* scary (I have screamed and scared my dogs before), but when I jumped through two walls to a generator as nurse and am suddenly inside of you, I can understand why someone very new might just DC out of that.
---
you must be banned then
---
This runs on an almost perfect loop and i love it
---
Not sure what the Claudette was thinking or doing...
---
Ok when 97% of the US country agree in equal rights and pay for ALL races and genders.... the room for actual racist people is slim and I doubt that there are many of that 3% few thousand Americans playing dbdl (a game with a small population to begin with).
---
I also wonder the same thing, why dc?  I have only dc'd when my internet has cut out or I have had  maybe 2 moments where RL required immediate attention.   I have thousands of hours and I'm proud to say ZERO rage quits, zero "I hate this map" quits, zero "i hate this killer" quits, and zero "boo hoo this swf is bullying me" quits.  I honestly think there is a mental disorder that causes quitting.. change my mind.
---
good idea lol
---
That's sweet, considering that I bought the game today and have never been on this sub before.
---
What map is that? Bedham?
---
Very fitting for sally, not gonna lie.
---
They've been in the entity's realm for years by now. They age in there, right?
---
... where did you get those numbers from?
---
Okay grandpa
---
Fuck battle pass, shouldn't be in a paid game
---
Lol yeah try that with my bubba, i dont camp, use noed or slug. I just get 4k even on red ranks whenever I am playing bubba in a good mood.
---
Bubba is so low :(
---
There is worse.
---
Idk then as far as I'm concerned the link is https://discord.gg/deadbydaylight
---
You could also try https://discord.gg/R2SFPn
---
That's a temporary invite link I made so see if that works.
---
You like chocolate?
---
This loop is incredible
---
General knowledge that was tested, studied and counted from during obama, Nixon, Kennedy, and Bush presidency.... some very racial divided times in politics that required some study.
---
Yea I know numbers but reading alot helps.
---
The only time I've ever disconnected was when the killer was lagging so bad I couldn't even vault, unhook or any other action
---
I‚Äôm going to be honest, that was an accident.
---
Dang, why are there so many hotties working at behavior
---
Idk but I 100% support Chipmunk By Daylight.
---
I kinda miss playing against them baby killers, tbh.
---
Lol
---
Why doesn't this stuff ever happen when I play.
---
I've only played in one or two matches where a SWF group was this cocky and I had to resort to slugging (*flashlighting every pick up, healing right in front of me, etc*).......
---
......they were all 4k's.
---
I enjoy this
---
The ERA is about women and men getting equal rights.
---
HE'S SO BROKEN LITERALLY SHIT KILLER....
---
Legit just had a game like this where a Claudette was missing every fucking skill check.
---
Exactly!!
---
Was waiting for this
---
Sir, and you‚Äôre welcome
---
I feel you. Also in my games the Leatherface camps in to the hook and he waits there until someone goes to rescue my teammate and he uses his one shot machine to take it down. It sucks.
---
Myers is superior. Thus perfect
---
i agree x2
---
lmao must be a rank 20 surv!
---
STFU
---
lol! im a killer main and youre right, he's one of my faves for a reason. especially when u use addons to make the charge time fast and his moving speed during it fast. but i always let everyone escape so its not as bad to play me.
---
The Revolution has begun!
---
They‚Äôd probably have to be tied to generators, but then you have the problem of Killers needing to be in 4-5 places at once depending on where the survivors go (Exit gates, the hatch, and whatever alternative option). I think they just need to make exit gate spawns more fair.
---
Oh I know i was just making a joke because the person had originally misspelt ban and instead said band
---
I wish the charge timer would show just like with chainsaws
---
Yus
---
Iridescent Head.
---
Dead Hard for distance is vwry strong though
---
TBH it seems and sounds like you just pressed it too late.
---
Teabag like a good survivor. Maybe clickity click my flashlight
---
swf team sees iri head:
---
***AIGHT IMMA HEAD OUT***
---
What perk allowed you to do that? I‚Äôm a new player, I don‚Äôt recognize all the icons yet.
---
It never fails that I get tunneled into oblivion when I burn a BPS
---
Her style is great :( I wish more people would play her but at the same time I don‚Äôt.
---
I play in the US. Survivor lobbies take seconds, for killers I'll wait like a min or two.
---
Unbreakable allowed me to self recover and recover quicker, while tenacity allowed me to move and recover at the same time while increasing crawling movement speed.
---
I get that, the reason I very rarely play killer is because it‚Äôs so rage inducing lol
---
Racial rights and gender equality are a hand in hand thing, I forget of racism or sexism was the thing... find me 1 person who believes in gender equality, and against racial equality. Or vice versa
---
The council will decide your fate.
---
omg, you just made my day XD
---
Facts
---
Dried Cicada + rusty shackles will scare the feces out of people. Cicada is so, so strong.
---
Probably. I legit just spent 4 hours playing and it's midnight so it's past prime time for people playing
---
I remember figuring out dribbling and using Agitation all the time to counter non-Obsession DS. 
---
It feels like it's been a lifetime since then.
---
Give in to the dark side.
---
I‚Äôm sorry
---
Mmm, I‚Äôd prefer not to break 100 rules out of the Survivors Rule Book for Killers
---
The only thing I'm not OK with is Huntress's placement
---
Other than that I'm glad that you didn't put Legion last lol. They're extremely fun with the right build!
---
My eyes need holy water. Look at how they massacred my boi ghostface.
---
It would certainly have to be balanced out in some way.
---
Iri heads take up 100 rules by themselves? The NOED section must be as thick as a dictionary.
---
It only happens because of dedi servers, killers use to take priority over closing it but now survivors can jump in first.
---
Check Volume 42-63
---
Should probably call him the suit or something that doesn't make him sound like a condom

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/djz72d/party_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Dwight‚Äôs glasses: all survivor perks that deal with distance have infinite range for 25 seconds.
---
That‚Äôs the new nurse add on where she can blink back to her previous spot.... 
---
...wait that‚Äôs Michael
---
Where do you think huntress should be placed?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And yeah lol Legion is definitely not a bad killer
---
I wonder if the four killers thing will come back
---
Not true. If they all go to the same gate, you down one and hook them. If they don‚Äôt leave before you hook, bloodwarden activates, down them all, go back and forth picking them up and hooking with Agitation. Bring an offering so the hooks are closer together and you should be able to do it.. albeit very situational.
---
PS4 SWF: carlitos_cor
---
Huntress should be right after Freddy IMO
---
Psn: carlitos_cor
---
It‚Äôs going to be released with the Archives, I think you need the new blight serum to get it.
---
You did start your animations at the same time, as you jumped, the huntress vacuumed backwards off of the hatch to the outside edge, that's the beginning of the killer's animation. I would honestly wander to guess that the hatch taking priority over you before was because of non-dedicated servers, because I'm fairly certain 9 times out of 10 that the survivor gets out rather than it being closed on them on dedi servers.
---
I suppose but it's pretty boring for me to tbh
---
Instead of talking about what I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like‚Äù I‚Äôm going to talk about what I do like and that‚Äôs Plague placement. Well done, glad someone else sees how strong she really is.
---
Lol someone‚Äôs salty
---
I mean, huntress relies heavily on skill with the hatchets. I believe she deserves a spot in the "good" tier because she doesn't have very good gen control like freddy, nurse, spirit, and billy. Myers is just in very good because of his one shot and increase movement speed.
---
Her hatchets are nice though for when a survivor pulls a pallet or vaults a window and you get a free hit.
---
I was gonna say she could be a genuine newbie, but looking at her perks, she should be past the point when normal skillchecks are too hard... That said, fast forward DBD was strangely entertaining to watch!
---
That could do it. Lol
---
Yeah, they are both in need of buffs lmao.
---
I used to main pig but switched to Ghostface for those amazing free hits and the ability to put survivors in fear because they dont know where u are
---
I'm pretty sure the case is still going, Sean Cunningham filed an appeal sometime last year I think and on September 26th he filed his reply brief in his appeal. The lawsuit is probably going to go on until 2020/2021.
---
Haha yeah, I wanted to include the beginning in case others thought I did something to the Claudette to have her act like that
---
That movie was honestly not good.
---
You damn right we are.
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
I switched from billy to freddy. I used to be some what decent but i lost my touch and freddys rework was just amazing
---
Loved it, well done.
---
No one tell them about [text path animation ](https://motionarray.com/learn/after-effects/text-on-path-after-effects/)
---
Definitely Plague
---
I like the lit up perk, just sounds kinda fun and for mind games maybe
---
And The Huntress!
---
You are being downvoted because each set costs 30 serum vials as shown in your twitch clip.  So you will be able to get a total of 60 vials, not 6.
---
The game is fun and less competitive, which results in less toxic behaviour. 
---
I don‚Äôt like the hate it gets
---
I don't really see a huge problem with Spirit to be honest. It's actually nice to have a challenge sometimes, always winning is boring.
---
Freddy has great gen control, the dream world is very good, and the snares/pallets are great ways to keep the survivors guessing and preventing loops.
---
imagine a ghostface sweating his balls off and proxying one hook all game
---
I've seen the schedule for the release dates of the cosmetics, Michael and Lauries will be released October 30th so you don't have to worry about that
---
Maybe next tome is called The Hunger?
---
Personally i find snares way better
---
Yeah I've noticed that even when she doesnt have beads she still doesn't emit a sound when phasing sometimes. I've been saying just add a small radius to beads, like you can hear her coming within 10 feet when shes phasing so you get at least a little warning.
---
Until Object gets nerfed: Object of Obsession, DS, Head On, Q&amp;Q
---
Introducing Jackson Voorhees, Jason‚Äôs cousin 4 times removed on his mothers side.
---
My problem isn't with her as a killer. She mechanically isnt consistent. Her phasewalk noise isnt always audible even without prayer beads, her character model isn't representative of her collision hitbox, and she has little to no cooldown for missed attacks out of invis. It becomes more of a challenge fighting poor programming than fighting a competent killer.
---
I meant in the main menu not just in general
---
how come?
---
Some get put in the store 6 months after the rift.
---
interesting.. never really been a fan of head on and i have no idea how to play with object cause i get tunneled and destroyed
---
I could see that. I guess I don't really notice those things, but I don't disagree with those points. I just personally haven't taken notice because I don't mind.
---
I mostly get SWF so most people know where the fake pallets are. With snares i feel like clown with the gen control
---
true. and you can just spam snares lmao
---
&gt; she doesnt have beads she still doesn't emit a sound when phasing sometimes.
---
If you're in her terror radius, she doesn't make a phasing sound.  Originally it did and it was directional, which is probably the way that it should've stayed.
---
You just described DBD too lol.
---
Well ive alwaye been for making survivors more unique as opposed to just being reskins of dwight so anything really it doesnt need to be stat buffs
---
I don‚Äôt think it was abuse just made bubba feel like it‚Äôs/her is his family and he always listens
---
I hated Head On until they fixed its proc radius to be consistent. It‚Äôs awesome for basement saves.. if the killer goes a little bit wide of the corner coming down the stairs carrying a survivor, you‚Äôre very likely to get the save.
---
Sometimes as ghosty boi killer instinct straight up doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôll get exposed but killer instinct won‚Äôt activate
---
I don‚Äôt think so but I might be wrong. Do you have an example?
---
Even before dedicated servers this game was terribly laggy.
---
I don't care what you smell like, your hair is literally *glistening*
---
Lemme record off my phone real quick
---
Spirit cute. Huntress always cute. And God damn Billy with that straw hat!!!!!
---
adrenaline, bond, iron will and dead hard.
---
No rules while hanging around the campfire.  .  .    
---
But I think the reason is that since the right hand is off the screen, that it's a better visual to have the weapon in the hand that is in view.
---
WHO IS THE HUNGER!?
---
I actually met my boyfriend playing that game. He basically started one of the cars and accidentally killed about the entire lobby lol. Did more killing than Jason that game, all of it accidental. I‚Äôm trying to get him to play DBD with me, too, but he doesn‚Äôt own the game. we can all agree that it‚Äôs worth it if you liked Friday the 13th.
---
You could earn auric cells in the premium section of the Rift. If you reach the end before the Rift closes, you'll earn exactly the same number of auric cells you spent.
---
The quality of the pass cosmetics were a bit on the "ehhhh" side for me, but if I earn back my auric cells I don't see any reason not to buy it. If you don't have enough time for that, it might not be worth it though.
---
Yeah i dont usually spam
---
i‚Äôm going to share with credit also! thanks for posting ur IG :) this is amazing!!
---
Killers are ambidextrous
---
Or plays the Dora the Explorer theme while chasing you‚Äîand then one time Jason asked me to sing the Spongebob theme song and he let me go!
---
Would've been great if you hurriedly scuttled away.
---
This comes off as "lol look how bad this guy is". He's probably just learning, those lunges can be hard to hit at first. I'm still trying.
---
Drunk me is laughing at 1:26 am
---
That's so fucking good
---
ITT: OP finds out the game he's poking fun at was actually very fun and loved.
---
He was purple ranks with spirit fury enduring
---
This is the reason unlike what other comments are saying
---
You know what would be cool. All 4 legion on the same map
---
May I ask why? I've never watched him.
---
But he laughs after giving you a little zap which is cute
---
Mint Rag and Rusty Shackles. Dirty as with Make Your Choice.
---
[Dbd bug?](https://youtu.be/ntup8NTgfA8)
---
Yes.
---
Well I just mean that they could‚Äôve flipped it so the campfire is on the right and the killers weapon hand is more visible that way too
---
He learned the secret technique!!
---
I prefer sociopath.
---
I‚Äôm gonna tier
---
TBH Dead hard barely works since they put in dedicated servers. Unless your using it to get distance its kinda pointless
---
Its funny cus I was just playing a match as Plague where I cornered a Meg in the same location. Went to swing, missed and hit a Dwight hiding in the same spot.
---
how about the crapper and demo
---
1. Dead Hard - This perk has saved my life and doubled chase times sooooo many times, its insane. Before you say about the baiting shit, you honestly shouldn't use it to bait a hit. You use it to gain distance to a pallet and unfuck a mistake. In the right hands its insane. Also, I haven't gotten a bug using dead hard before so idk.
---
2. Adrenaline - One of these are good in ANY match. Four of these in a match make killers D/C. Insane, but only gets used once and might no get used. Sorta like a reverse NOED.
---
3. Balanced Landing - Good, but sometimes you might not be to reach heights which makes it a dead perk slot. 
---
4. Lithe - Great for extending chases, and sorta like a budget Balanced Landing, but not as good because you might want to stay at a jungle gym loop or something instead of springboarding to another loop. 
---
5. Head On - This is a classic memer but actually requires some skill to use. Can be gamechanging.
---
6. Sprint Burst - Best exhaustion perk for noobs, but has a low skill cap and is fairly useless for experienced players. Why is it good for noobs? It helps you get into a good position to start looping in case you're out of position. Its good, but walking is a bitch.
---
Noob3 is a demi-god, change my mind
---
A DS to a guy who doesn't know better
---
" I'm about to do what's known as a pro gamer move"
---
This is the kind of fucktard I body block at god-loops
---
evil within
---
Damn what I wouldn't give to be able to play that often. I can't find anyone before 5 or after 9 really.
---
Fuck I got testicular cancer from reading a encrypted message from a moron.
---
Poor op spent time and effort to make this image of him getting a 4k and no one cares because congratulations and whatever.
---
no worries according to survivors killers aren't people.
---
Myers has one shot capability unlike hag/huntress. Hag's traps are very good and I love to use hag but i just believed she didnt belong with freddy and billy. Doc IMO is a viable killer. A lot of people dont like him. And you can really get a free hit on any stealth killer. Ghostface is way better at executing than wraith imo
---
fantastic, true art.
---
Yep just have someone that is inspired by Jason and go from there. After that the character is no longer Jason but someone named I don't know blason
---
Adulterers, adulterers all of you
---
https://youtu.be/ntup8NTgfA8
---
This is art
---
No I just think he‚Äôs dyslexic.
---
Myers has a temp one shot but again hes a loopable killer and if you spread out, he'll get one down out of it.
---
I wish survivors would understand as a killer my goal is not to make you have a good time. Its to hang your sweet supple bodies on them hooks.
---
Except when in a trial.
---
I mean, if you save your one shot until everyone is close, you could get multiple downs, and maybe more if you have stbfl
---
People shouldn‚Äôt have to only run detection perks just to counter her
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
First hit, hit the guy on hook
---
Second hit, miss
---
Third hit, hit guy on hook again
---
There both Kate‚Äôs so that probably why it seems like she was being hit
---
Another entitled survivor you guys need to learn to play better
---
Nooooo, my favorite stud muffin is gone :c
---
I let out the ugliest laugh when I she was lunging out the door
---
Edgy.
---
Do you know if it's all outfits in the rift? or if its just some for example:  
---
free tier outfits will be put in shop  
---
and paid tiers will stay exclusive to the rift permanently.  
---
sorry to bother you with questions but im just really wondering how it will work and i cant seem to find the information im looking for, i watched the stream they did recently about the archives the tome and the rift but none of my questions were answered in that video
---
Me and the boys breaking the laws of physics
---
Okay at the highest ranks shes still number 2 behind nurse. Definitely an extremely strong killer with few counters
---
it‚Äôs a great play but i don‚Äôt really blame the guy for facecamping. killers lose all their pressure once the gate opens (unless they have noed) so it‚Äôs really the only thing he could have done
---
lol Loot Boxes are still worse.
---
The good thing about Dbd is how it can stand on its own even without those franchises. The most popular and most used killers and survivors are the original characters they created instead of the licensed characters.
---
If a second  Friday the 13th game came out with good devs and a good player base it would probably do as well as DBD tbh
---
To be fair top person got hatch.
---
Are you maybe thinking of the new Halloween movie that came out?
---
People shouldn't have to run Ruin, Pop, or Dying Light to counter gen speed.. but guess what, we still do it or else we'll get gen rushed.
---
What makes survivors special to think that you shouldn't have to run perks to counter certain killers? Take off Adrenaline, or DS, or Borrowed Time, or Sprint Burst and add in Spine Chill for a change. 
---
If you refuse to bring in perks that can help you against the Spirit, it is your own doing and you deserve the thrashing she'll give you. You have the ability to help yourself out. Being stubborn about it will not lead you anywhere. 
---
And the Spirit does NOT deserve to get nerfed just because survivors insist on not helping/improving themselves.
---
As much as I love Dbd its straight up garbage on switch
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt care that much, I‚Äôm just gonna buy the first one to see how it goes.
---
Aww. Don't try to hurt my feelings.
---
You could've done us both a favor by not saying anything then.
---
But nevermind. I learned - albeit too late - that this 'not knowing it exist' is a meme. I've also read that the community is quite toxic. I guess seeing you memeing in a 'no stupid questions' thread and getting up votes for it proves that. Pity that you guys give no love in the mobile version, because it got me quite interested in the steam version, and I'm sure same is true for others. I hope they don't get the same treatment.
---
That's a new one for me.  Maybe a server issue with sync between killer and survivor?  Maybe a visual glitch for missed attacks?
---
As a wraith I decided to farm the last survivor for chase points, then after they eventually found the hatch, said GGez...
---
Friday the 13th is a better horror game than dbd tbh
---
damn sorry that was an error hes supposed to be at s tier
---
Why'd you bring Bloody Party Streamers? If you wanted to "Torment" them bring a Jigsaw Piece or a mori.
---
You know I honestly don't know. I played a shit ton last year and then stopped playing shortly after I got it to three tier. I think maybe I thought it got the gens up faster thats all I got, because playing the last few days I've wondered myself why I'm using it. 
---
My overall strategy is usually start the game, find a gen, hide near the gen, wait for the killer to either start chasing someone else or to patrol past my gen, then I hope on the gen, and repeat the process over. So my ideal game is hide, gen , hide , gen I suck at looping and I got no problem unhooking but being captain save a ho isn't my game and looping the killer on a long chase isn't my game. 
---
So I like Bonde because I can see what everyone else is doing, if they are doing a gen near by, if they are running around like a mad man I can get an idea of them being chased by the killer, its nice to see what your teammates are doing. I got dark sense because when I pop a gen I wait to see which way the killer heads after the gen is popped and then I go the opposite direction, and then I got self heal. So I'm really thinking I might go Spine Chill as my fourth one, it kind of fits into knowing where the killer is for me.
---
Legion slows down the game a lot more than they do and his frenzy can get everyone injured right off the bat
---
Is it bad that i know and have been through the exact situation depicted here?
---
No. I saw the new one. I was talking about the 2009 film. The poster looks older than I a remember. Looks like the game's art.
---
That's really cool!
---
Oh, gotcha.
---
This last reset has been alot worse for some reason. My SWF team spent over half of last month around rank 10 and it wasn't anywhere near as bad as this has been. We've been paired with so many potatos the last few days its unreal.
---
The fans were scared of a competitor back when it came out so they would bash it in every outlet, they used to flood the f13 steam forums with spam it was extremely toxic. Personally I enjoy both games
---
This is pure art
---
Yeah I agree. The worst gen for us (Survivors) is definitely the top floor one in Hawkins. Imagine Bubba sneaking up on you with his chainsaw revved since you can't tell whether the heartbeat is coming from upstairs or downstairs.
---
Gonna prestige Doc soon so I'm just emptying my inventory.  Also I do feel a little bad playing doc.  Not fun for people who want to play hide seek.  I'm just not interested in playing h+s with 4 Claudettes.
---
Also this was my 2nd game this year so figured they were all new and just try-harding.
---
"You shouldn't be here!" "Neither should you!"
---
Yeah ik. It's genuinely really pissing me off now. I'm not at rank 15 for a reason.
---
One of the ones on the stranger things map can be blocked by the killer if they stand at the door and the gens not complete (been camped to death 1st hook that way lol) so I'd say that gen
---
i think the point being made is you dont really gain anything from blinding at pallets outside specific spots where you can break LoS without any effort
---
if you blind at a pallet with half high walls to a remotely competent killer theyl immediately find you again no problem so it comes off as being a dick
---
and "giving the killer a chance to get points" is referring to the games where gens are done within 4-6 minutes at lower ranks and people immediately peace out, what you do in those situations isnt really an argument against it being toxic
---
not all killers facecamp but that doesnt stop facecamping from being toxic as shit
---
But Jane would've died too.
---
I don‚Äôt mind losing, but if I don‚Äôt want to win then I don‚Äôt have an objective and no sense of accomplishment. (Having fun while playing to win, instead of just trying to have fun) Using that mindset, a grind is another set objective to achieve and have fun in the journey not the destination. Ooh that‚Äôs a great line, grinding isn‚Äôt the fun part it‚Äôs just what motivates me to do the fun parts.
---
It‚Äôs actually the best perk to use for countering the spirit
---
Sure? Can u carry a body with ur weak arm? Or throw a hatchet? Or handle a chainsaw? They seem preety ambidextrous to me in the trial too
---
Anyone have a blank version of this photo?
---
A lot of safe pallets with the wraith you can practice bing bonging at the apex of the loop and using decloak speed to catch them before they react, or try body blocking the vault when they loop around to it then bing bong and slap em.
---
Or, if you chase someone out of a dead zone (no pallets left), say, off a generator with 2 others on it, you let them drop pallets somewhere else then ignore them once they drop it and fly back over to the dead zone and try one of the other survivors there, if you commit to chase on the ones that count you will have 10 dropped pallets from that other asshole and you catch the 2nd or 3rd guy, then when theyre hooked you zoom around and delete 10 safe loops at once.
---
&gt; But she is by definition ‚ÄúOP‚Äù.
---
OP to me means fundamentally broken, something that allows for a easy victory with little to no effort. A cheat. A good Spirit is not broken, and she needs a great deal of skill to achieve her success. She's the only blind killer in the game and the third slowest.
---
&gt; Her counters are very few compared to someone like trapper.
---
And thank goodness for that since the Trapper has been low tier for three years now. The game needs more Spirits and no more Trappers. Low tier killers are the biggest disgrace from these devs and the more they push back the buffing of said killers, the more I long for another horror game to come along and take away all of BHVR's player base due to their own incompetence/hubris. 
---
&gt; It would be nice to see buffs to the rest of lacking killers but until then compared to other killers she is technically op
---
The solution is to buff weak killers, not nerf strong killers. The game doesn't need 14 Pigs. The killer is suppose to be the power role, not the "hope to get two kills if we have the right map/right perks/no swf" role. Every killer should be feared. You're not suppose to feel relief when you see who the killer is. The killer is suppose to make you go into hardcore "focus" mode. The killer is suppose to make you uncomfortable.
---
The priority is getting the rest of the killers up to near Spirit levels, and if that's not what they are going to do then I don't want to see a hair from the Sprint touched. And no, I don't trust them to buff weaker killers "after" they nerf the Spirit. The hell with that. Buff the weak killers first, then talk Spirit. We've been waiting three damn years.
---
You do tjat they'll just tell you to killyourself for DC and not hatchets.
---
Just kill the bastards, fuck what they think.
---
It‚Äôs ok he‚Äôll just come back at the campfire
---
uLtRa "rArE!!!"
---
My bad I was thinking if Inner Strength not Fixated.
---
Her pose is a little *too* accurate.
---
Flip flop isnt useless i got downed. one survivor came into sight of the killer so killer went after him. When he came back and picked me up. He wasnt able to bring me to the hook
---
I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs cute about Myers, unless you fight him stabbing you to death cute then sure lol
---
Not my girl Kate üò≠üò≠
---
Been getting paired with Rank 17-20 survivors as a Rank 9. Going to need shoulder reconstruction surgery from the amount of potato teammates I‚Äôve had to carry.
---
Where is the grammatical error in what I say. From my tertiary read-through, I saw none.
---
Can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head, but yeah they were like 15+. Only just got back into the game, so been in these low rank lobbies. Feel sorry for the killers
---
The chipmunk noises and EXTREME SPEED made this great.
---
I once got hit with legion using the frenzy on the exact same map and I got the boost that your get after a hit for an unlimited time!! I mean I was on adrenaline for the rest of the trial lol so i don't know if it's a map related bug or its just a bug in general.
---
"Fucking NOED killer noob killer"
---
"You'd better let a bad player using bad tactics kills you instead of countering their bad tactics with good perks or I'll sandbag you and fuck over the whole team so you die!"
---
This is Gold-Tier mental gymnastics right here.
---
Is Gaston a Purple hair Nea?
---
I gave a baby Jake the hatch and in the post game chat he said ez
---
Sprint burst, wake up, urban evasion, and fixated
---
It's a nodding Bubba with only one sacrifice, the odds he *wasn't* camping are like 30/70.
---
To teach you how to behave and have self control? (Bad joke IK xD)
---
Why if I may ask? I‚Äôm feeling the complete opposite. You can only see the weapon as killer, unless your phasewalking as spirit.
---
hes not good at higher ranks. at lower ranks hes good
---
I bet escape rate is around 20% now
---
YES HUNTRESS COSMETICS IN THE RIFT
---
i don't think matt actually knew how much was in there but justin said you get all 1000 auric cells back if you make your way through the premium track.
---
I said it has the potential to be OP, which really isn't going to happen often
---
That remind me how much Gaston is a bitch... but that won't be ever as painful as a toxic survivor
---
The hockey mask didn't even show up till the third movie yo
---
If a full blown camper got a 4K, might want to be looking at what the team did wrong as survivors
---
If all of you are dumb enough to get killed by a camper you deserve it
---
How does someone camp and get 4K? If someone camps I‚Äôll always finish gens and the killer ends up getting one or maybe two kills at the most?
---
Well then no excuse. 2 half decent survivors can make things work. You might not escape but you can do okay
---
Other commenters said it already, but if a camper gets a 4k, survivors done fucked up, not the killer.
---
Will somebody please think of the Hentai! I mean children!
---
As a killer main, if you guys really fuck up and leave us with 3 generators close together then we've basically won, or at least we'll make your life hell.
---
Some killers will base much of their play style on that 3 gen strategy.
---
So for killers I want to say the "worst gen" is just whatever generator is on the opposite side of the map from the other two, if the survivors co-ordinate and avoid falling into that trap.
---
For us, the distance between each generator is the more important factor I feel. (Though other killer mains, chime in, I'm interested to hear others thoughts)
---
Haha. Yea, because me being on the hook and my friend being chasef means we'll do okay. Including when the 2 randoms are sitting in a corner across the map.
---
How do you even hit shreds? They're always at safe spots when I've charged it up and if i try it while they're running around, the shred turns out to have charged too little and doesn't even reach them. Why is this charging even a thing? I've missed so many shreds by just an inch becuse of that god damn charging
---
Any idea how long Rifts last?
---
In my experience, as killer and survivor (who mains Jane,) Jane is one of the good ones like Jeff. Janes just tend to be (or strive to be) very helpful and supportive without being toxic, and they also tend to be the ones to show mercy on a bad luck or baby killer. 
---
Now if you want to talk toxic, Nea is the queen of toxicity. And unfortunately I have seen way more toxic Nancys than Janes.
---
Still very hard. The only way you'll get time enough to hit them with a fully charged shred is when they're out in the open
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dk0k8n/spirit_post_game_screen_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Sounds fun, and I‚Äôm all about the story progression. Glad to see the game finding more depth.
---
Ye keep telling yourself that‚Äôs the reason you‚Äôre not gettng rank 1.
---
My hero.
---
You know what Entitiy? Maybe I‚Äôm displeased with YOU. Ever thought of that
---
Killers are supposed to have priority. I think this is just a side effect of dedicated servers messing up timings of events.
---
Whatever makes I‚Äôm happy,I guess.
---
Its really weird and puts me off thogh
---
Best perk in the game.
---
Huntress is a super QT
---
how so?
---
Well gotta agree nea is the queen with Claudette being the princess of toxicity, nancies are like Dwights most of time , babies or semi-toxic. Feng Min are also toxic. But if I would put them on the list it would be 
---
Most toxic gals: nea, Claudette
---
Semi toxic gals: meg, feng 
---
50/50 toxic: Jane, Kate (and maybe Nancy from what you applied but haven't meet one like that yet
---
Nah I don‚Äôt have inner strength

---
That was my first one :p.
---
&gt;Way less toxic
---
I remember a ton of people trying to teamkill and plently of knocking jason out and teabagging him.
---
I know that Jane‚Äôs booty is thicker and thanks for the info :)
---
When the spirit does her stand still teleport thing she can only see your scratch marks, if it chase either stop running or run back through your scratch marks to make yourself harder to track.
---
the second one or atleast change out bond with empathy that way you can see an injured teammates aura farther across the map and pretty much know where the killer is. i used to use bond but found empathy to be way superior when needing awareness
---
That's just greed on your part. No one is stupid enough to keep making cosmetics FOR FREE. Either you pay for the cosmetic or you dont.
---
Yeah i've noticed it being used more often now.
---
I agree with this except that proxy camping the basement is still camping. I understand if the survivors are silly enough to run down while you are around but hooking the basement then sitting around up top is still camping.
---
I think bond if you're not taking a medkit, borrowed if you are taking a medkit
---
All the cosmetics in the rift gets released in the store 6 months later. That's a long ass time but you at least get to buy it if you really want.
---
Only game I've bought a battle pass on is Apex Legends and you could earn it back and get the next one for free there
---
To me happens sometimes when trying to hit greats to go through ruin. Won't miss it often but it can happen
---
So you dont like that people spend money on things you cant afford??? Jesus christ.
---
He dont know what hes getting himself into
---
This is helpful, thank you.
---
bucking bronto is such a better name than boil over
---
They are all sick! Keep up the good work. I think they would be even a little bit violer if you added fog with like low opacity so it gets the dead by daylight kinda vibe :)
---
Iron will is your best friend against spirit. Its my staple perk for all killers but its a great counter to spirit.
---
to each their own.
---
Survivors will rush the hook like a bunch of idiots and then get mad when i don't leave the area.
---
Umm, excuse you? Did nobody tell you that we live in a very hypersensitive society? You can‚Äôt criticize anyone anymore, not even nicely or constructively. What if they get depressed now or worse, try to commit suicide? Gosh, dude, be more empathetic please. If someone doesn‚Äôt care about hygiene or appearance, keep it to yourself! Especially on the Internet! It‚Äôs totally a safe space! /s
---
Bonds my go to perk for solo queue
---
IMO in order from worse to better is: Loot Boxes&gt;Microtransanctions&gt;Battlepass
---
It runs like shit , people saying it runs good probably only ever played on a 3ds
---
Imagine playing dbd on switch
---
I just want to know what happned with the last dude. Did he wait on hatch and died too? xd
---
the counter is to all use a BPS that way 3 survivors out of 4 make good use of it !
---
Hag adepts pretty easy to get on the bright side
---
Monkey balls
---
Vermintide is not something I expected to see but it‚Äôs a welcome surprise lol
---
No? I don't know where you got that from? I don't spend money on microtransactions. What I'm saying is, that if they were lowered, the people who *do* spend money on them would be getting a better deal too? Reading comprehension, my man, practice it.
---
She isnt easy 2 counter, she just isnt fun or balanced lmao
---
Couldn't have said it better myself, nice work mate.
---
Hey at least you know that guy probably isn‚Äôt toxic. They probably didn‚Äôt understand you where just trying to be nice for them.
---
devs have said all survivors and killers are 18+, even the ones who were in high school are supposed to be "aged up"
---
you've got tiny teenage tits
---
I like them
---
Looks kinda cute... and sexy
---
I think the problem is that your playing dead by daylight on switch
---
Why did you start recovering?
---
it isn't a coinflip.  spirit has ways of detecting where the survivor is, scratch marks and hearing.  the survivor has literally nothing unless they bring spine chill, iron will, and/or a flashlight - none of which should be necessary to counter a killer's basic kit.
---
Bond so you can get heals and know when your potato teammates are running the killer to you.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
"learn counterplay" 4head just successfully guess where the invisible killer is  who has no indicator of where she is 100% of the time 4head
---
I dunno man looks more like Kosaku Kawajiri
---
OP was probably swarming the hook with his friends, ignoring gens and the killer had 0 fucking reasons to get away from the hook. 
---
"Waaaaa camping noob doesn't go patrol gens when he literally sees us all around him"
---
Many funny comments here, but I just wanted to say: people who disconnect on purpose are the biggest pussy-simp-betas in all of dbd. I feel great joy when a weakling like that leaves my game since I'd rather die as a surv (and as killer: I let the other 3 go as a rule)
---
Then dont buy it. You dont need anything you can  buy in the game.
---
Ok since you must be new
---
She can't see you while phasing, so you can manipulate your scratch marks when you think she is using her ability. Throw her off, that's enough to get distance. It's a big deal because her m/s is 110%, a huntress without hatchets basically, easy to loop and avoid. After 15/20~s repeat
---
If you're injured better have iron will. It's a good perk against any killer who can hear you and so, predict your movements by using their ears. 
---
How to counter spirit explained. You're welcome
---
You forgot to put "sarcasm" after those statements
---
ds is not going to have the utility that bt does in the overwhelming majority of games
---
Hey I was gonna comment the same thing but it looks like you beat me to it, your a saint my friend
---
Just buy a few cosmetics, man. You dont need to have every single one in the game.
---
i think that killing a "famous" dbd streamer is cool but if you're tunneling them like an absolute cunt then it ain't cool at all and you look like a dick
---
the tbags were beautiful
---
Hey someone with common sense... I like it
---
The hero we need
---
Dunno why you got down-voted tbh. Sounds like we got some salty sallys here tonight
---
I reckon they upped the rate in which they appear in the bloodweb secretly because they understand how many of them will be likely wasted since they‚Äôll just dc.
---
Peanut brain killers most often go for the tunnel rather than the hook trade that's why i use both DS and BT just to be sure
---
IMO the weapons are really basic, just some glowy stuff splashed on them. They're definitepy better, but the bodies are a bigger change
---
&gt;As a killer main,
---
Irrelevant information also falsifiable
---
&gt;when half the ppl DC before gens are done, I have a bit of a code that says I'm not gonna be a super try hard killer at that point.
---
But hey, to each their own, right?
---
Exactly, anyone their own. Especially when people talk sht if you farm or kill them. Either way it's not fine
---
So why not end it faster?
---
Nope not tofu
---
I hope they have players escape and remove characters üòÇ
---
That's interesting and great job done!
---
My current build is fixated, adrenaline, self care, and dark sense. Sometimes I swap dark sense with balanced landing or quick and quiet. Sometimes i swap self care with inner strength. Just depends
---
heheh what if spirit was drunk and the couple legion boiz frank and joe decided to gang bang her because she didn't know what she was doing
---
and then Nancy wheever was drun akd ntehy fuck her too and
---
ming fing with her tiny little tities shoukldn thave drtunk so mucjh vodka get FUCKED
---
Adrenaline isn't  useful that often tbh, and sometimes it's even a hindrance. For it to be useful you need to first make it to the end game, then you need to either be injured or in a chase. Otherwise it just exhausts you unnecessarily, preventing you from using dead hard, balanced or lithe if the killer does find you. When it is useful it's very strong but I'd rather run a perk that I know will help me. Plus, chances are if you've made it to the end game you've probably already pipped anyway, unless you're a potato.
---
The 2nd one is a lot better. Being able to see auras of of where your teammates are is nice, but BT will come into play more and some people will actually thank you for having it in some scenarios (they‚Äôre on hook during EGC, basement, etc)
---
You're not wrong, but it's potentially a one-time payment for all future Rifts. I'm not familiar with other battle pass systems (if they do the same thing), but that seems like a good deal for DbD regulars.
---
Self care isn‚Äôt very good. It‚Äôs slow and it wastes time. Bond helps me find survivors to heal me *and* do gens with. I just don‚Äôt see much use out of self care.
---
you as killer: I killed three, I win. 
---
you as survivor: I got hatch, I win.
---
I bet you probably eat potatoes with a spoon.
---
1. Dead Hard 2. Adrenaline 3.Balanced Landing 4. Sprint Burst 5. Head On 6. Lithe
---
Personally, I've only bought one perk from the shrine (decisive strike) and I really regret it. At the time I thought "why not, I'll never get Laurie to level 40 anyway." But I did. And it feels like I wasted 2000 shards that I could have spent on a new character or cosmetic. As you said, it is all subjective - I suppose it depends on how much time you see yourself investing in this game. Personally I would save up for the Spirit. It only takes a few days of playing to grind a character to level 40 anyway, and it'll be more fun if you have more variety of killers to play as.
---
Just use hatches to kill them
---
Imo snares are the way to go think of him as a better clown through down snares at strong loops while patrolling keep in mind though they won‚Äôt work unless they are sleeping, then do the same mid chase put a snare or two down when they loop you may get a hit or a pallet down quick both are good, you can also fake a teleport to a gen it may scare some survivors away and buy you some time, and if your confident in your tracking you can try and teleport mid chase to cut them off.
---
I comes in clutch more than I can even ask for yesterday on my stream a killer fell for a window fake and in result missed and I got adrenaline and booked it across the map and it ended up in the killer DCing but I won‚Äôt say that you have a valid point there are times where I wish I had other perks but I always keep it on for those moments bc they happen more often than not
---
The Council will decide your fate
---
i wajnna fuckin wape sxomething
---
F13 would have been way better than DBD if the game was given a chance to be finished
---
My vote goes to not cleansing if you didn‚Äôt already guess.
---
I *think* they stack. The best way to find out would be to test it out yourself, but from what I understand, We'll Make It, Botany Knowledge, Med-Kits and add-ons all stack with one another so you can heal extremely quickly with all 4. If you do test it out make sure to let me know because I'm intrigued haha. I *think* this is the case though.
---
It's a good thing no killer ever really cares if that happens.
---
Self-care saved me in a lot of matches and granted me a chance to unhook other survivors only beacause I healed myself and got the possibility to get an hit while bodyblocking the killer
---
Never! Never let one go. Always murder.. MURDER THEM ALL! 
---
Sometimes it's okay to let one live to tell the tale.
---
I could just bring a med-kit though
---
It‚Äôs pretty crazy. DBD costs money to purchase and has every kind of micro transaction (DLC, cosmetics and now battle pass) but somehow I love it and it just works. Never thought a game could pull that off.
---
I think a lot of survivors value it so highly because it gives a lot of user satisfaction when it does come in clutch. But really I think it's an overrated perk in general that gets hyped up because it's fun to use. Also because a lot of survivors seem to value surviving over pipping. I'd rather have a perk that helps me throughout the game, so that I have a higher likelihood of pipping, even if I die at the end.
---
Claudette mains don't really have valid opinions by default so..
---
Dead Men Tell No Tales intensifies
---
Idk maybe I‚Äôve just had ok experiences, but I‚Äôve probably had an equal amount of good/bad games from being first hooked. I guess it seems odd to me that people are happy to derank/lose BP over something so small.
---
I understand where you‚Äôre coming from though.
---
&gt;Calling her Adiris
---
I sleep
---
&gt;Vommy Mommy
---
Real shit?!
---
Somebodys playing basement Bubba i see
---
It depends on you want to play the match.
---
In general I don't use any object because in this way I can play any "role". In some case I equip the tool box an play the "role" of gen repairer only. Of course, if someone is in trouble I give help, but my main goal is to repair gen as quick as I can.
---
If I equip a medikit is beacuse I want to play the "role" of the healer, using the medikit only on other surv.
---
So, in any case, the only way I can heal myself is Self-care.
---
You responded to a child comment which said he uses noed to counter adrenaline. You somehow took heavy offence to that, claimed he was insulting all other players, and then you insulted everyone who uses noed. If the parent comment added context that somehow made it okay to say those things then feel free to tell me what it was before he deleted it because of you
---
Don't worry, it only took them ~ 2 years to decently optimise it on console, so you can look forward to a fun have of DbD switch in 2021
---
Its ok dude.
---
So then you realize they can work on both without them taking away from each other? Two separate teams with two separate skillsets working on two separate tasks?
---
Dark Sense, Deja Vu, Kindred, and the other eyeball design perk. Just literal "all eyes on me"
---
'Hell and Back' would be too strong; This game used to have it so you would recover whilst running(even in a chase!) and it was absurd; However, I could see the perk being fine if it did this while NOT in a chase!
---
I really like 'Indomitable Will'! Would it stack with 'Flip-Flop'? I could see making some very fun builds with those two and 'Boil Over'.
---
I think 'Baba Yaga' is interesting, maybe it should do boldness actions instead? To make it fit with the character more and since we already got plenty of altruism perks.
---
Games will be terrible when each team mate is running around dropping 3 pallets and scaring 25 crows. :|
---
Should have stabbed him with whatever is at your hand in ultimate escape attempt
---
Both docked and handheld perform the same, and so far I have only played survivor because i assume killer is much much worse
---
First perk is need a slight nerf. Maybe 50% or even bigger. Because sprint and Dead Hard gonna be abused so hard.
---
r/aita
---
So the game has to warm up to the console...? That's odd
---
Yes, you can be tempoarly banned for it.   
---
" **Greifing: Intentional gameplay abuse**  
---
* Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates
---
* Targeting specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience
---
* Holding the game hostage"  
---
But i highly doubt you will. expecially when it was a double DC game.

Here is a link, may be old, may be mildly wrong :)

---
I don‚Äôt necessarily think every gameplay is saved but it was said in one of the devs stream a LONG time ago so I‚Äôm not going to be searching through all of them. They most likely meant observe your scoring and outcomes in each match but I don‚Äôt doubt they can save game of individual players if they wanted to. But to save everyone‚Äôs gameplay at once is what I doubt.
---
250 games to finish the rift. yeah.
---
From my understanding it's only bannable if you're working with survivors to kill others.  But letting them do gens and whatever else isn't.
---
That's fucking broke, imagine demo with territorial, MYC, agitation and monstrous shrine with this buff Holy fuck
---
Ghost face
---
Well we need strong perks so that not everyone is running the same meta perks on every killer. And the perk would still only work on basement hooks except the 100% more bloodpoints for sacrifices.
---
Yay, I'm the 20%! I really like her skirts and I adore her rasta headband.
---
&gt; Only part of the first Tome was unlocked in the PTB, so we really have no idea what they're going to stuff in the later sections.      
---
          
---
Actually, all levels of the Tome got unlocked, they opened a new level every day.         
---
            
---
Don't quite remember off the top of my head what the tier 4 challenges were but I do know they were all Master level (15 of that to be precise) and def were more demanding than the early Masters.
---
Like the first day I got it it was like playing on ultra ultra low graphics and laggy but then over the last few days it literally runs fine.
---
Just tell them Left 4 Dead will always be the better game.
---
That was fucking amazing üòÇüòÇ
---
Lithe + Dance With Me + Quick &amp; Quiet + Iron Will  for ultimate mid-chase disappearance. 
---
We'll Make It + We're Gonna Live Forever + Borrowed Time + Aftercare/Deliverance/your choice of Exhaustion perk to be the ultimate hook saviour. Might just be me but I find it incredibly satisfying to heal someone using We'll Make It.
---
Walmart and target have some games out with the cd inside.
---
The graphics got better too?
---
No your fine you weren‚Äôt working with anyone or anything she said herself she didn‚Äôt like to farm I do the same thing let them get some points etc so they can atleast black pip but I don‚Äôt really wanna sit around for all five gens
---
On the rare occasion I play survivor, I adore sabo and almost always have Ace in the hole + plunderer's instinct.
---
I love getting real good loot and having little sub objectives to do.
---
Yea like the first day or so the faces were all blurry, the outfits were super pixelated and a mess. I couldnt read the front of suzies hoodie it was so bad. Now it's clear as can be.
---
The bp is neat but basement builds will be even more nutty with that 24% faster progression
---
Dunno why you got down-voted, I swear to god this sub. I wonder if it's just because the map choice you picked. I do think some maps like the swamps should be addressed, along with maps like Haddonfield and Badham where it can become nigh impossible for a survivor to escape.
---
Careful with his big knife üòèüòèüòè
---
help me understand
---
We are not, they could've released everything they had still unfinished before the whole mess, and then have fix updates like they do now...they knew about the legal issues that were coming. Uber Jason was already finished and you can find his kills online. The only issue was the map, they could release it and warn the playerbase that it was broken.. done
---
I've had dudes yell at me for NOED, when I killed them all before the gens got popped. So NOED literally never happened and it ended up being a wasted perk slot.
---
It's not all bad, I had a team earlier that fucking floored me. I had really bad trap placements and the map had good loops. I only got 3k because of NOED. The post game chat was relatively nice and they were more just mad that they got cocky than at me. Which was a welcome change.
---
The team I'm super salty about could've beaten me had they not spent the whole time flashlighting and teabagging. They played themselves when it started to snowball.
---
ƒ∞snt that guy from post42?
---
P L E G, M E G, H E G
---
ty i silly
---
Thanatophobia Legion deserves it tbh. I'm a killer Main and mostly play Huntress but I can't respect that build at all. Disgusting. I would tea-bag too.
---
Amazing
---
Everyone pronounces plague like plag so it rhymes with Meg and hag
---
I just threw some numbers in there since most people complain that the 9% that it has now is abysmal &amp; is not really making any difference at all. It could maybe need some adjustments in the numbers (hook timer would go down to 91.something seconds from 120 seconds with 24% progression)
---
I would suggest checking out some you tubers for some tips on killers. Otzdarva and TrueTalent and OhTofu are great at explaining killers
---
I wish that was the case for my matches personally I get bm from that almost as much as I do for "tunneling" or being a toxic survivor
---
but what about being a survivor?
---
Maybe it was only during the first month, the time I played the game, but I remember many people talking. Me and my friends would literally quit out of game voice coms as soon as the game started because the in-game system was so fun to use
---
A fun build a call the savior is Deliverance, DS, Unbreakable, 4th is subjective but I personally run headon, flip flop, tenacity, or diversion most of the time.
---
Good job!
---
Yesterday daddy Myers tunneled me for 5 gens, thats BM?
---
And you get bonus points. For it now too
---
I meant to say survivors but I‚Äôd check them out anyways they know what they are doing for both sides.
---
I played earlier this year for the first time and people barely spoke, you‚Äôd be lucky to get one guy talking in a game
---
Ikr, heaven forbid the last person during endgame should be at a disadvantage
---
Just bring a key, burn a lerry's offering or just do nothing because games like this are the exception and more often than not the killer's got a fair distance between gates (sometimes opposite sides of the map even)
---
Well. That‚Äòs true. But in the next update you will get more bloodpoints for some actions. For example u get bloodpoints for every dc in your team, or vaulting while getting chased or wiggling on killer‚Äòs arm. So there will be some improvement.
---
How? I had depression from it
---
There is no counter against good spirits, who ever says otherwise is a spirit main and is afraid of her beeing nerfed.
---
You get increments of 25-50 Auric Cells every few tiers.
---
Adding them all together, you will have made 1000 Auric Cells by the time you reach tier 70 (the maximum), which is exactly how much it costs to purchase the Premium Rift track in the first place.
---
Hold on I‚Äôve had 2 games with this build and I think this might be the best build in the game... first game was against a spirit who DCd and then I got a nurse who also ended up DCing...

---
Wait.. you gave a camper 4k?
---
Then you think they should be perma banned for it camping? Ahahahahaaaha
---
Wanna talk about entitled kids who DC? Or who abuse third party programs to derank? 
---
If he got 4k by camping, it's you and your team fault
---
Big brains
---
I personally don't use NOED because
---
1. It is so easy to counter.
---
2. I just feel there are better perks in it's place that help prevent needing NOED to start with.
---
Not sure why those survivors got pissed at you using it? I mean, were they running meta-builds too? LOL. Have you tried running STBFL on Trapper? Insanely good on him.
---
I honestly hope Trapper gets some love soon(after bubba) because he just can't compete too well at high ranks. He takes far too long to set up.
---
Have you done Michael yet cus him and nurses were impossible for me.
---
It has to be destroyed
---
It has to be destroyed or you can put pallets where they can usually spawn if one isn‚Äôt there
---

dk if its a problem but im from the uk
---
none of my friends play dbd either its either they play fortshite or minecraft
---
Wait, Michael's married?
---
Woah..
---
they are not
---
I think she never puked once, idk why
---
omg yes
---
"I AM ETERNAL CHILD"
---
imagine if it actually is him. im a massive it fan so itd be amazing.
---
I agree. Swapping noed is OP's best choice. He even admitted its a dead perk sometimes and that a team "fucking floored" him and he got a 3k only because of NOED. Swapping it out will improve his game and skill.
---
Can I upvote this twice pls
---
You've got red on you: The first hit from the killer does not damage you, however you appear to be bleeding out.
---
(Would catch the killer off guard, as you would need to take 3 hits. Can only be used once.)
---
definitely cause the last eye perk is OoO /s
---
the spirit isn't a teenager, she's 20
---
&gt;And no I am not a Survivor main I play both 50/50 and still think spirit needs to be nerfed.
---
Irrelevant
---
&gt;There is no counter against good spirits, who ever says otherwise is a spirit main and is afraid of her beeing nerfed.
---
BS. They will nerf it anyway like they did in Freddy when he came out. Too many kids dcing against her and iri heads, they will nerf both soon. The devs love to Nerf things then say "just adapt" after they nerf it to the ground
---
&gt;Iron Will helps a bit but you still breath and leave marks in the environment, like moving grass...
---
Breath is covered by her phasing sound, marks can be manipulated. I can give you grass but you won't notice much unless you are in a corn map.
---
I know it's hard to stick with 1 playstyle and 1 only but jukes, baits and mindgames are a very viable strategy against top killers, spirit included
---
The only thing she needs to be nerfed is prayer beads or make it ultra rare
---
The hero we don‚Äôt deserve.
---
"For 27 years.... ive dreamt of you.... ive CRAVED you...... OH IVE MISSED YOU" 
---
id imagine if it was pennywise the lore would be something like at the end of chapter 2 when he is full of fear and has had his heart ripped out the entity calls him and promises he will get revenge on the losers only to be the entitys toy now. and it also adds a new meaning to everything he created turning to dust and being destroyed at the end
---
When you see a swf with those perks, never feel guilty to camp, instead enjoy them being mad bc they couldnt tbag/flashlight you at every pallet
---
can't blame them, they had a game blow up which they weren't expecting and they are working with code that dates back upto 3 years ago. Considering the patches that have come out, its fairly obvious as to why the game doesn't run that well.
---
Why the massive downvotes?
---
It‚Äôs mostly because of the new players that are coming to dead by daylight because of stranger things update
---
I pretty much always run BT so I'd go with the 2nd build. Seeing survs with Bond will make you die a bit inside.
---
Nah, there was a ton of people crying about it even before ST dlc
---
John Wick fits a killer more IMO.
---
Is why I said mostly
---
If Ash is a Survivor then so would John

To be honest, both shouldn't be played on the Switch.
---
One was already dead before it got released and is a technical mess and the other one is just a technical mess without cross save. And without cross save, what's the f'n point? If you never ever played this before and you will strictly stay on the Switch forever, for some reason, sure, maybe, but most people already have save games on other consoles or PC, played thousands of hours with bought dlc or cosmetics for hundreds of dollars.
---
Don't get me wrong, as bad as it is, I would have liked it as an Handheld alternative for a quick round or two, if I could continue with my account, without, no freaking way.
---
Honestly, there are some maps that just decimate hag, especially the larger ones so it may partly be from that. Also, if the team was a coordinated SWF, that is the hardest counter to Hag there is
---
Alright. I still think freddy should have access to both the pallets and the snares but I guess that would make him un-loopable I suppose. It very hard to do so.
---
Like you would the potentially strong Looper Freddy player and you have to take into account both the snares and the ground that slow you down AND an hypothetical dream pallets that might fuck you over so... Yeah...
---
Yea. It's why I'm baffled nerfed Nurse who was the only killer who could reliably and least painfully deal with them without even addressing the SWF balance, let alone make lower tier killers more viable
---
Dude! These are fucking sweet.
---
I wonder if it would be possible with all the copyright stuff these days to offer prints, because I would 100% buy a print of some of those killer illustrations. 
---
I‚Äôm excited to see The Nightmare whenever you get around to that one, Freddy is my jam.
---
Like 10 of the same comment is upvoted. Yet this one, exclusively, is downvoted to hell. Such is reddit.
---
Cos his perks are really good
---
Spoilers man, I never watched that movie.  
---
I thought Gaston was just the market clown and not the end boss.
---
Who do you NOT have?
---
So is the Rift a Battle Pass? If so, I'm out.
---
I'm watching the wrong franchise!
---
Is there any release date for live yet?
---
Go for Jane Romero. Why ? Cause THICC.
---
And she has a cool perk that stuns the killer when you leave a locker right in front of him.
---
But mostly because THICC.
---
No they are trash
---
Leave it in somebody's closet and they'll brick when they see it!
---
My favourite juke. If he lunged the window when you vaulted out I reckon he would have hit.. nice work all the same.
---
Ba dum tsss
---
Yes, officer, him. He‚Äôs the one you‚Äôre looking for.
---
I mean I think they're good but sureio you probs have more game experience than I do tbh haha
---
When Pharamcy is finally useful for the first time ever. Happy Quentin
---
Shaming players 10/10
---
I like that THICC aspect. I heard it's the best perk
---
I have none of the survivors or killers purchased
---
Do you want survivor or killer?
---
Honestly pipping and rank in general in this game encourage many of the worst behaviors.
---
Can you get banned if someone is playing immersed and not trying to progress the game and just purely waiting until you die to get the hatch if you tell the killer where the immersed hatch seeker player is?
---
Not how rhyming works. Plag and meg still don‚Äôt rhyme
---
Reminds me of a game I had last night. Killer messaged me afterwards: Awesome 360s bro I‚Äôm too stoned right now to keep up with all that movement.
---
if you mean he chased you for 5 gens then he is just generally not a smart player.
---
Legendary cosmetics on fortnite cost about 20 dollars
---
I could go for either honestly I just want good perks.
---
For survivor, I'd say Nancy but you gotta use real dosh so I'd go with Feng, since Lithe and Alert are both very good perks.
---
For killer, really depends on your playstyle, there's quite a few good choices.
---
His perks just aren‚Äôt worth it. Much better options out there
---
Fortnite is also completely free. Try again.
---
Please.
---
Fuck off. r/dbdgonewild
---
I try to give the benefit of the doubt these days and just assume they were having a bad day. But if two people rapidly DC in quick succession, then it sure as shit ain't okay.
---
Ok, this seems legit.
---
But think about this: medikit runs out of charges while self-care has no charges. 
---
Maybe my playstyle has adapted to the use of self-care, i don't know. What I know is that I can play quite well with the combo ds+dead+adren+self.
---
But this doesn't cut out the possibility to try other perks combo.
---
Feng imo. She has 3 solid perks and is cute. What's not to like about that?
---
Isnt feng free tho?
---
No mither, self care, botany knowledge , we‚Äôre gonna live forever.
---
Well lol I guess so lol. But to be fair lol, I do genuinely think lol, that those survivors lol would fit better lol into the lol "Roasts kid lol back lol" category lol.
---
Gib glasses Meg nao plz devs
---
Spirittttt
---
Its L1
---
... That honestly doesn't matter at all. If the cosmetics were cheaper you'd buy for way more than the game costs. People spend hundreds of dollars on fortnite cosmetics.
---
Well it‚Äôs pretty difficult to kill Jason honestly. Lots of steps to take, and precautions. So it makes sense counselors tbag if they manage to succeed
---
For me it‚Äôs not about the hatch being closed it‚Äôs the fact the game is giving me the animation. I feel like if I get the animation before the hatch is being closed I should get out.
---
I assume your ps4 like me feng isnt free on PC
---
Feng doctor hag and i think ace are paid on pc
---
I'm pretty sure they stealth reworked its collision a while back. It has become a lot more difficult and inconsistent to avoid hits by dead harding into the killer.
---
Big Ass = Big Hitbox though!
---
The trolling possibilities....
---
I wasn't aware of that, that's really shitty.
---
Ps4 master race :P
---
The things we do for dreams
---
This ‚Äúhooks‚Äù too close to home
---
Personally the second but replace either borrowed or adrenaline with deliverance because the amount of times I am left to die because my team thinks someone else will get me is ridiculous
---
I really like deliverance because i dont want to have to depend on other players to save me from the hook. I want everyone else to keep on doing something useful, like repairing or looking for the totem etc. I dont want to be a burden. 
---
Plus, i ve had games where all 3 survivors kept doing the gens instead of coming to my aid. Even when one of them is visibly injured and chased by the killer, the other 2 would continue repairing, calmly waiting for me to go phase 2.  Its no fun.
---
So deliverance is a win win for me. But i understand why people dont prefer it, as it requires a specific condition to activate and if you are the first survivor ending up on the hook, it is a waste.
---
Rest of his perks...well they dont interest me tbh.
---
Ha! Great idea!
---

That whole argument makes no sense.
---
fortshite üòÇ
---
Doesn't console not have bill though or am i wrong?
---
Correct. I'm starting to regret what I've done. Though it has been fun finding out what actually happened and lots of experiences others had with the game. I didn't know much about the game other than it's kind of a meme in the dbd community but I see now not everyone dislikes it as much as I thought. I won't post anymore "hate" towards the game, even though it was meant as just a joke.
---
*sigh* Everytime this meme gets posted I have to look up the source
---
PS4 still does not have the Achievement Updates that PC and Xbox got. So some do not make it.
---
Unpopular opinion, Kate is better than Jane.
---
Both were at the end of the game so I blame the deja vu gen rush tbh
---
Ah General Riposti!
---
Haddonfield is only really nasty with Balanced Landing which none of them have. The Rank 7 has set his flashlight add ons up wrong, odd bulb will drain his extra charges as well as his base charges.. that yellow won‚Äôt last long. Three items in a lobby demands you bring Franklins.
---
For me its not even honor. I just loose the will to try once I have earned the party wipe. Sometimes that means letting 2-4 go even. And yes I will give up a pip out of mercy.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main before we get started, basically if I need a 4K or I‚Äôve just been bullied the game before, I‚Äôll switch to her for an easy game, all you need if headphones.
---
Ngl I watched this like 5 times thinking there were that many shelves in the store
---
Wait did u actually menaged to use MoM this game or gaining stacks is so hard that u didnt got even 1?
---
.....f*ck...
---
Legit had a Dwight in a game yesterday named Ignorant Slut. Was a pair of ppl running no mither Dwight though. Was a weird game lol
---
You do what you like my guy but leaving just bc of the map sucks for survivors. I hate waiting 10-15mins to find a damn lobby and then once it starts the killer just ends the game .
---
Some folks like spirits I guess?
---
It was pretty much OP against Stealth Killers in almost all scenarios but that's being changed in the mid-chapter update in a couple days so its power is reduced but against Killers like Trapper and Hag it's extremely strong. It almost nullifies their power if you're outside of their Terror Radius, especially if you're in an SWF as you can tell your teammates where they are too.
---
Isn‚Äôt that the case with every survivor skin? So then the case is actually a survivor is either toxic or they‚Äôre not.
---
One game i had today with lullaby it spawned all the way in the corner of one of the swamp maps literally none of them found it the whole game
---
How long does Breakdown actually break the hook for? I can't seem to find a definite answer. Does it reform after a minute or two, as with Sabotage?
---
*You feel an evil presence watching you...*
---
Nice perks
---
It's an app but i will try and find it on the website (The post is kinda old)
---
You're right, it's quite subjective - and also depends on the rate at which you're earning both Shards and Bloodpoints.
---
Spirit is a top-tier killer, but if you're *never* going to play her then you're "better off" just using the Shards on her teachables, bearing in mind that the full set could take between 3 months to a year. In a fraction of the same timeframe you could do an odd job or random task for small money (install a PC, clean up an old photo in GIMP, etc.), use the money to buy her outright, and grind out her teachables the old-fashioned way.
---
Up to yourself.
---
Same here, the mask is gone... It'll probably re-appear soon since more people have the issue, they just fucked something up again, and knowing BHVR it'll take some time to figure out, they aren't exactly the #1 customer service dev!
---
We'll probably see numerous store items appear before this issue gets solved, since the art departement is better staffed then the coding one!
---
I had zero fun with adept Demogorgon, tbh. Good luck with all of them:)
---
Ghostface so highhhhhh
---
If that would be true the next time I see one of their booths at a gamescon I'm going home with at least 3 teeth!
---
Sorry for not being a masochist
---
I'd say Spirit, Clown, or the objectively most beautiful survivor Kate Denson.
---
&gt;!I'm just spouting facts!&lt;
---
Switch has Clown and Spirit too!
---
They should just remove ranks and add a check box that says you want to play with pre-formed teams or not as a killer. Maybe sweeten the deal by giving the killer 25% bonus BP for agreeing to play against pre-made 4-man SWF teams. That way the 4-mans don't get lobby dodged and the killer hard time is rewarded.
---
I‚Äòve seen a hag lay 30+ traps once around my bud
---
There needs to be a trigger, a cool down Unless the perk an X number of uses Or- is more of a 1 note thing such as aura disruption which doesn't negate the killers aura reading completely, it just weakens it. Also it needs to be a good power, Not too powerful, Not useless, Just good. 
---
But there are perks that need distance to properly relay information such as premonition, Maybe it could only work for aura reading, It would be an Iridescent Addon and it would extend aura reading abilities by 25% (stacks with addons) Additionally triggering aura effects such as alert will show all survivors the aura for half of that time along with item aura sharing.
---
They already have addons, this would be more of a catch-up for survivors.
---
For a rank 10, thats pretty cowardly.
---
Would you like an insta-kill function with that bullshit as well good sir? I'm a Killer main but that is just to dumb to be considered!
---
I'm a fan too! I hate to get my hopes up, but it really sounds like it could be Pennywise.
---
√ôw√ö
---
Absolutely.
---
If it had more conditions to activate it it would be fine.
---
Maybe conditions like reach a total of 100% gen progress, heal other survivors for a total of 150%, cleanse 2 totems or 1 lit totem, achieve a safe hook rescue and heal the unhoocked survivor by at least 50%.
---
When can Bubba sneak up with a chainsaw revved?
---
Why did you mark that as a spoiler
---
And I thought Ace was the lucky one, damn
---
I don't know to be honest.
---
&gt;!I just like using the command more than I should!&lt;
---
I would love an option to join a match from which I dced, it's so frustrating when my game crashes and I lose everything ugh
---
Dark sense, Alert, Detective's hunch, Better together.
---
With the power of these 4 perks combined you basically have bootleg Object with no draw back.
---
Second wind, autodidact, inner strength and head on
---
hey she surely got hatch
---
Plag, Mag, Hag OMG it works
---
That's a killer I'd never use.
---
wait why?
---
For me every time im halfway through one its replaced with something else. Since the last update.
---
Everyone has thier own preference üôÇ
---
üò± lucky survivor
---
UwO
---
Wish there is a way to tell them "That guys is on his last hook, can we get out now?" or just drag them out for their own safety.
---
In the beginning I thought they are ok but now I think they are garbage and they actually got worse. They can‚Äôt revert them fast enough.
---
#metoo
---
Clearly it was Mettle of Man.
---
Spine chill resilience lithe quick and quiet
---
***BIG BRAAAIN***
---
In the Mid-Chapter update, the wraith, pig, Shape, and Ghostface will receive the undetectable status effect, which means they'll be immune to aura reading abilities under these conditions:
---
- Wraith when cloaked
---
- Pig when crouched
---
- Ghost Face when in stealth mode
---
- The Shape when in EW tier 1
---
Right now prior to the update, these killers get destroyed by OoO, especially Ghost Face. This change gives all stealth killers more edge, though this means anyone using OoO then would hurt themselves.
---
With the dedicated servers on I've had games where I'm just on a gen or running around and the game decides I'm just done playing that match.
---
Kate. Why ? She‚Äôs a country girl and she has the best cosmetics out of everybody. Even her default still looks good !
---
Ehm.. how can you tell she thinks that?
---
And how she got a 4k tunneling? These are the important questions tbh
---
From the video can't tell any of that
---
Me: plays game to my utmost comfort and efficiency. Salty survivor mains: CaMpEr TuNeLer nEwB
---
It went from one of the best survivors perks, to one of the worst in one patch 
---
Make it 2 protection hits, fix protection hits, remove all the negative effects MoM has and it would be a solid team player perk.
---
Yes , I am
---
It took a total of like 10 hits one match and by the end I finally got the 3rd stack lol it‚Äôs such a great perk
---
Well good because that was my fav cosmetic for trapper
---
good its what he deserves for facecamping
---
It‚Äôs definitely your WiFi, ran like ass for me for a while moved the router and it actually plays good.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm a killer main before we get started,
---
Irrelevant and useless information that can be false
---
&gt;I‚Äôll switch to her for an easy game, all you need if headphones.
---
You can juke and manipulate scratch marks to throw her off and use iron will
---
Imagine playing dbd
---
It can either be one of the best perks in the game or the absolute worst perk in the game depending on your skill in chases.  If you're quite strong in looping and running killers it's awesome.  If you're not it's just a death sentence.  Also it is the absolute best perk in the game for racking up early DC's.  Some players babyrage out of there the moment they see it.
---
Wait, is that Marco Merrino?
---
I will never understand why people feel the need to tbag killers all the time üôÑ
---
MoM will never be meta unless the revert it
---
I dont play fortnite but I think you cant take different pieces of the cosmetic (pants, hair/hats and other things) ane combine then with others but you can in dbd. I also think the design of most dbd cosmetics beat fortnite's (but thats just my opinion) we've also got charms coming which work for all characters. So you're saying cosmetics should cost less because we have too little cosmetic pieces?
---
I want this in the game **NOW!**
---
Okay thanks, I'll try that!
---
Oh okay, I'll keep that in mind because I'm constantly wiggling aha
---
Yes because that‚Äôs easy to implement.
---
Oh well, hopefully for every few unfriendly killers there is at least one friendly one :)
---
What hurts even more is that the dev's finished the Jason X skin and the map but cannot release it.
---
Don't be such a stick up your ass person
---
"unfair"
---
Well don‚Äôt suggest such absurd things
---
I would have never expected to see a crossover meme of my two favourite games. Now I can die in peace.
---
This was really good don't try to make t
---
Yourself. Think it doesn't
---
better than getting insidious camped by a 3+ blink nurse.
---
Honestly I feel like Sprint Burst makes people think I‚Äôm being toxic. I promise I‚Äôm on my way to unhook you, I just don‚Äôt wanna overshoot it and miss you and get downed myself.
---
gen tapping massively reduces the rate that gens get done and in red ranks that is a sure fire way to lose. killer‚Äôs like ghostface have a similar ability when it comes to gen grabs however despite having no terror radius he is still visible. the spirit is invisible, and has no terror radius.
---
It's almost a r/perfectloops
---
Nah if you played the match and read the messages you would understand.
---
DCIng because of killer selection in current year lmao
---
Nah I don‚Äôt play like an asshole. I always give everyone a fair chance unless people are being toxic then all bets are off lol
---
this happened to me just a few minutes ago, was against a huntress, exit gate opened but there was a lit totem right at it so i thought hey i‚Äôm a bit hidden she shouldn‚Äôt see me, i‚Äôll cleanse it and dip next thing you know she comes around the corner spots me cleansing it and charges right at me swings at me but just misses allowing me to make it to the gate, turns out it was Noed.
---
we are dutch.
---
The messages after the match, they thought tunneling was a "skill"
---
Did you see his rank though?  Green rank killers tunnel their asses off.  That man is going to need every Decisive Strike he can muster until he gets closer to red.  Than the killers start to chill out a bit in that department.
---
Yeah spirit is a bit to strong if I‚Äôm playing survivor and she is killer I do nothing but hide and crouch and do gens like a scared bitch and just hide randomly at some times
---
Was it on the clown map?
---
Psn- liroara14
---
I dont have a deep friends list either
---
Lmao ‚ÄúI got camped and my teammates hook bombed and we all died‚Äù 
---
Incredible
---
Unless he has Claudettes in the lobby.  Then he just has to comb the outskirts of the map.
---
I will never understand people who rage quit when killers put on a BPS or cake, smh.
---
*Territorial Imperative Noise*
---
It's kind of a fun perk because nobody ever expects it.
---
me too
---
Hmmmm
---
I *almost* did today, after a Feng went to the back of the chest I was opening and just stole the toolbox in it...  
---
Sorry
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I said! Dutch.
---
The main reason I think most survivors really like it is for the situation of being hooked while it procs and being unhooked into the full health sprint burst.
---
''he''
---
I'm fine with it. I got DbD for free through PS+ so I never paid for the base game, but I've bought every DLC (on sale) except for Stranger Things. If they're going to keep putting resources behind the game, then I don't mind throwing $10 to them here and there. Plus, I don't *need* to buy it.
---
20 seconds is ample time to escape. Seconds matter in games like that
---
They have said that the cosmetics in the pass will be available for separate purchase a few months after the Rift closes. Plus if you do all the levels you actually get your auric cells back so it is almost like you spent nothing, almost.
---
Yes but he had the option to go for me, he walked right past me and followed Claudette when he could have just chased me.
---
O ya no spirit is rediculous but so is survivor shit too, they can‚Äôt nerf all the op stuff on one side but not the other but while they are nerfing nurse at least there nursing insta heals so, so far so good
---
It's one of the worst perks in the game now as you rank up.  It's almost a 5th killer perk.  I hope I have a lobby full of them in my killer games.  It means gens are going to pop slowly because they throw the match slowly healing often in a corner.  I have seen so many matches as survivor thrown by Self Care Gamers that can't be bothered repairing the gens because that 40-60 second heal depending on killer loadout is just all too appealing.

I'm sorry, next time something like this happens I'll post messages too. I didn't realise the lack of context xD
---
Extending the life of your item = toxic
---
For real. I let my son play and he's very young. I'll watch sure enough people start tbagging him/ bming him. That's when I take the controls and kill em. But always after the messages come in salty
---
Because simply, the way you jumped in was to validate a bullshit meme that is very tired out in this community. Because your treating NOED and adrenaline like they're these god tier perks. They aren't. One is destroyed by bones. The other is situationally reliable and involves you being injured at the last gen to milk it's full use.
---
Furthemore you treat this occurence like it's an every game thing, justifying a perma noed slot.It doesn't and I genuinely don't believe adrenaline is the only reason you have noed on your kit.
---
Isn't that par the course up there though?  In my experience the only difference between a green rank and yellow rank killer/survivor is more perks.
---
Tfw these losers dont wanna play against a broken addon
---
What if you play solo queue with tool box and no self-care? How can you heal yourself if every other survivor play for himself? You are obliged to repair gen in wounded state.
---
Reapir a gen in wounded state is a good thing only in case of genrush.
---
What's wrong with noed is assuming EVERY killer has it. And then talking about it like every killer SHOULD use it. There are plenty of us out there who get along just fine without it and it's rather insulting to us killer mains who don't touch the stuff to automatically be treated like we abuse it.
---
Eleven headass
---
Yea this is a bad example of toxicity, and weird to be offended over. If I got caught by bloodwarden like that too I'd probably teabag for the memes since you know you're dead LOL
---
Hawkins ic cool, but it kinda sucks
---
This is so sad, can we please fix deliverance?
---
*im speed*
---
I know you were only mentioning girls, but I have to say that Jake is probably the most toxic survivor of them all.
---
Probably stems from the old hook sabo days.
---
Damn dude, don't cry.
---
yes this is big brain time
---
She's not easy to counter that's why people love to play her.  It depends on the rank but near red you almost need Iron Will to have a chance.  Also I'd advise against healing at hooks.  Despite being a top two killer in the game a lot of players play her to tunnel back to every hook so you should just anticipate that.  
---
While fully healthy or with Iron Will when she traps you at a loop and looks as if she's still phasing I like to walk away opposite from it entirely and take an unpredictable path away.  This can be a good mindgame against her.  And you gotta learn how to sniff out when they're just standing there pretending to phase.  She has counterplay while you're healthy or with Iron Will but once she can hear your groans of pain it's all over.
---
I think if you're good you can get 4k most of the time almost as any killer. Legion is really bad tho, yeah.
---
Better yet, she points at him laughing and mike drops ace out of embarrassment
---
Oh nice it's this one again.
---
Yes but the devs do give us release dates and feedback. The f13 devs didn't do shit and there roadmaps were always months apart, not to mention when it crashed on release and wasn't playable for a week
---
And the killer has Rancor while gens are done
---
Isn't that a bug I thought there was a item that did that or some shit lol
---
Kates are heretics
---
Cries in getting insidious camped by Bubba. Funny enough it's in the Basement.
---
This is the funniest thing I've seen this year, good job!
---
Is that your go to default move on this sub?  I see you accuse them of lying on nearly every thread regardless of topic or what was said.  It's kind of a waste of a comment.  Just address whatever they're stating.  Assume the entire sub isn't populated by liars for disagreeing with you.
---
Also your scratch marks don't matter once they have a hit on you hence the headphones comment from him.  You can juke your marks all you want she will still hear you close the gap and end phase either into the strike or 2 steps behind you for a strike.  She basically requires Iron Will to maintain counterplay once you get to red ranks.  But I agree as long as she can't hear you and she isn't running Prayer Beads she can be mindgamed and there is counterplay that exists.  But if she can hear you that means your ass.
---
Too fucking late.
---
Shark has been jumped.
---
Have you SEEN the new "neon" skins (esp Jake and Feng)....TOTAL Butthole Royale garbage...from the colors, to the gayness, and now with new head and back blings!.
---
Good ol' M-Scrote must really be running out of Pretty Good Job So Far.
---
Have fun being sued by Canada, asshats.
---
Yeah it's a bug, from my video I'm pretty sure the legion was hacking.
---
I would say yes. It at least gives the downed survivor to get back up somehow
---
Irate you actually gonna add the the discussion or just be snarky?
---
"\*Psychedelic trance music" 
---
God I have no life.
---
I swapped out whispers for pop
---
The only flaw about what you wrote was that the perk is rare :/
---
It is free to play on Xbox. It‚Äôs in the game pass with another 100+ game
---
Ok but seriously, if they don't bring the belt it's only 1 hatchet and y'all act like if that hatchet could track you around the map
---
I think F2P would be where I draw the line because that stuff is like crack to cheaters.
---
dosent Fixated no work on No Mither because you have to be uninjured?
---
No Mither and Self Care though, now we're talking BIG BRAIN strats
---
The differences between console and pc are amazing.
---
Killers farm all the time. You have nothing to worry about.
---
Heck, It's even in the survivor's rulebook for killers.
---

---
Also almost as if they usually dress up stuff in announcements. It would have looked quite‚Ä¶ funny had this preview of the free track really only had as few things on it as it did in the PTB, where it barely had anything. A stark contrast to the paid rift.
---
Having the serum in the free track also seems like a filler to make the free track appear more "packed". It's doubly weird because in the Withering Blight Event announcement, they talk about the pustulas only being in bloom for a limited time, which is also the entire lore justification for the blight events to begin with, yet the serum will apparently be available in the rift long after the "event".
---
Note: I don't actually care much that they are not including more free unlockables, I was just making a halfwhat comedic throwaway remark, so please spare me "entitled kid BHVR need to eat too!!" comments, everyone.
---
[here just 4 u](https://www.reddit.com/user/im_tatitos/comments/dk3slv/just_for_u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  here there‚Äôs one just for u
---
I can loop a killer while injuried. Of course. But you can't think to play all the match in injuried state (except in the case you're playing with No Mither of course).
---
I can loop in general, anyway. But I prefer to loop in full health state so I can get chased longer and give time to other teammates to complete gen. 
---
But if you think I can use a better perk, so, tell me and I will try.
---
I liked the list for the most part until I saw how high Doc is and how criminally low Hag is.  Hag belongs behind Freddy.  Doc is just frightfully mediocre.
---
Never said it was, i‚Äôm saying its not needed.
---
Me 6 rank , huntress main , I use BBQ , ruin , and No one escape death , and huntress Lilly
---
Honestly, I wouldn't even call that tunneling if the person you find happens to be the one that was just unhooked. It sucks for them, but you wouldn't be doing anything wrong if you just hooked them again. The one that unhooks is supposed to take aggro from the unhooked person.
---
Tunneling would be if you saw where both the unhooker and the unhookee went and decided to go after the unhookee anyway. Even worse if the unhooker tries to get in between the two of you and you still ignore the unhooker.
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs the fact the killer messaged me afterwards acting like he was a god tier killer.  I got 4 gens by myself, last guy on hook dc‚Äôd and he found hatch before me.
---
If this doesn‚Äôt make it to the top post of all time on this sub, I don‚Äôt want to live on this planet anymore
---
When you get stunned by all pallets on map  also great job
---
I would have preferred a new game mode but more lore is fine too. Good thing people will upload all the content you miss.
---
Solo survivor I did 4 gens not sure what else I could have done.  I ran to the hook at first cuz he had insidious and turned to do gens.
---
Yep, if I can get in my friends way I will lol
---
3 terrible survivors cuz I did 4 gens while the others did fuck all.
---
People either see it and get as tryhard as possible or they purposely DC to be an asshole. It should really be a hidden offering at this point.
---
Is no one going to mention how fucking perfect this loop is?
---
Could you at least work a little harder and not just steal a screenshot of a YouTube video maybe a spirit about to gen grab her or is that too much effort
---
This, especially since I‚Äôm solo and control the other 3.  Also my build is usually altruistic and not gen rushing, so if I‚Äôm the only one doing gens it ain‚Äôt happening.
---
No mither, self care, fixated,iron will
---
Thats a true legend build
---
Thats how long it takes Meg heads to get downed anyways
---
A pay wall in a way acts as a dam for cheaters, with the almost constant sales, it going up on ps plus and gold awhile back, plus the game pass availability, I think it's fine where it is.
---
When I "T-bag" to me it usually means good game, I didnt know it offended people.
---
You could use my fav, Plunders, Ace in the hole, and two random perks. I like boxes.
---
Depends on the person
---
I was doing gens by myself cuz I was playing solo.
---
They should make more maps with just gameplay on the mind. Not that they didn't with Hawkins just that they thought of the map idea first and how it would work within the game second
---
Hmm, thats a lot of hex perks. Is lullaby really necessary? I'd wager you'd get more bang for your buck if you ran a tracking/chase perk instead
---
bro imma be real if you down me after i get unhooked you best pick me up cuz im about to ds your ass, if you just leave me on the ground youre gonna look like a cunt because if a killer slugs me after i get unhooked i assume youre slugging to avoid ds
---
A dutch website with a non-Dutch emergency number? People are going to die
---
If I‚Äôm the only doing gens with no perks or items to speed up the process that‚Äôs how.  Last guy killed himself on hook and killer found hatch before me.
---
I've seen pop become used really frequently now. Back when it was released, I rarely saw it. Would this be due to map shifts or just general epiphanies that the perk is better than people originally thought it was?
---
In my experience most of the DCers are use to playing with SWFs and thus are use to easier games overall. But when the killer gets them in that one-on-one situation where they can't rely on their friends to make up for their own lack of skill, or when they themselves are playing solo, the entitlement comes out. In their pee-brains either the killer must have been hacking, breaking made-up survivor rules, or must be OP and needs nerfing. The reality of "I got outplayed and deserved to get downed" rarely crosses their minds.
---
It's pathetic behavior really. In addition to harsh DC punishments, there should be a block feature that allows other survivors and the killer to block playing games with people who DC so that their search for games gets longer and longer. DCers are one step above hackers in terms of the scum people in this game. They ruin games for everybody else and are an infestation that should have been stomped out long ago.
---
It was already offered as a free game on PS+ so I doubt we‚Äôll see it again.
---
I don‚Äôt think it needs to be free, just keep the base game listed around 50% off and it‚Äôll do fine.
---
When does it come out?
---
Isn't there a achievement thats about you escaping from 4 killers? I thought that was a limited event lol guess not
---
youre account has been suspended! reason: youre too good lol
---
I mean there are plenty free to play games with little to no cheaters
---
Meg for surv because she has an exhaustiom perk and adrenaline straight off the bat
---
I'm always switching between killers but I think I'm gonna stick with ghosty for a while since you can really get into the role of it and scheme to create some spooky plays I love it, plus his mori is easily the best one
---
&gt; prayer beads
---
&gt; fair chance
---
Pick one.
---
Very clever
---
But, they could get out...
---
He didn't have blood warden...
---
I swapped whispers for sloppy and that's it really, seems to work well
---
That's why I don't even care if I i Seoul. If the game wants to put me with the rank 20s, so be it.
---
Fuckkkk Dave Richard is so hot
---
I like how most of you think so one-dimensionally - IF YOU ARE GOOD
---
Even if you are the best of the best when facing a good survivor team you wont win most of the time
---
And its because there is just mathematically not enough time for killers
---
Yeah you can win most of the time if you are really good with clown for example - but not all the time, and if i put more then 1 k hours i should be able to understand the game enough to win consistently
---
 
---
But that's not true, odds are always in the favour of survivors and only their mistakes and killer good plays make it otherwise
---
Oh, I never noticed

I just started playing 6 months ago but now what I thought
---
His goddamn head tilts
---
I love this, the scared laugh is perfect
---
I agree. If you D.C. You should be banned from playing for a period of time, and the killer should still be allowed to get that last hook on you.
---
Honestly. Same brother üòÇ
---
Very creative perks.  I might buff the cleanse speed.  You‚Äôre giving up a perk slot to potentially counter a NOED.  It also assumes you weren‚Äôt the survivor who is being chased, the totems weren‚Äôt already cleansed, you actually need to cleanse it, ect.  I do like the idea though.
---
I'll just hit you with a list any of these would be a massive upgrade.  
---
Iron Will, Bond, Dead Hard, Balanced, Lithe, Decisive, Borrowed, Leader, Prove Thyself, Small Game, Pharmacy, Deliverance, Aftercare, Distortion, Unbreakable, Poised, etc...
---
I'd take any of those over Self Care.  Some of those fill the role or help you to heal yourself or find them elsewhere.  Others are just good perks for different purposes.
---
If you complain about DS, change your play style. That‚Äôs your fault. Just slug for a little bit and you negate their perk. Head-On is literally a meme perk, one of the weaker exhaustion perks. If you get hit by it once you should be getting weary of them using it and never get hit by it again. If you got hit with it every time you picked someone up then you really, really need to work on how you play the game. I don‚Äôt think either of those perks are toxic at all and the second one is actually funny to see.
---
Impressive, most impressive
---
Spirit isn't scary, she's boring
---
Honestly just think it‚Äôs survivors becoming more optimal with gens man
---
Seeing a lot of thant/dying light too
---
Because they're entitled probably, the block button is there for a reason remember :)
---
I see you have unlocked Decisive Connect.
---
To be fair you don't need any build to gen rush.  You just need to repair gens.  I could technically gen rush perkless.
---
The killer is actually scary, wild.
---
For Survivor, it's a hard to pick just one between Ace and Jane. Jane is great not only because I really REALLY enjoy her lore (she's Oprah like how can you beat that?) but also I'm glad she was the first female Survivor that doesn't look like a damn twig. Ace is also my fave bcuz holy shit I think I got a daddy kink from him. Also they're both latino
---
For my fave Killer, please refer to my flair.
---
Take a break when you need to.  I‚Äôve taken months off but always come back.
---
The rift/Archives/Halloween event is in 3 days.  That might spice things up a bit.
---
Haha every single time hatch spawns the first place I check is here and 8/10 I swear it‚Äôs there
---
No, a lot of streamers do it.
---
well shaking your head does send mixed signals of "dont you dare save them"
---
I have to disagree with you here , did I pay to play dead ? No , is it in the game pass yes . Will it‚Äôs free to play for me .
---
Yes, it also counters DS.
---
It‚Äôs there 100% of the time 50% of the time
---
üôèüèº
---
I intentionally count down the DS. I'm a survivor main but when I play killer, I fucking hate getting DS'd
---
Maybe borrowed.
---
Here hese may main perks:
---
Dead Hard
---
Decisive Strike
---
Adrenaline
---
SELF-CARE
---
Leader could be good. Iron Will Is a good counter for The Spirit. Balanced is ok. 
---
Maybe I'll go for borrowed.

Nah they'd run up during the grab animation, I got weary to it the first time around and got a grab or two eventually they gave it up, ds wasn't really an issue I was more pointing out they were running the main perks you see a lot of survivors run. More or less the game was just a slog.
---
r/downvotesreally 
---
Are you this guys alt or something? Can people not downvote with what they disagree with?
---
I Mained Claude at launch as a survivor main and dabbled in Billy because they were the best.
---
Now I main Ash and Shirtless David because I find them hilarious.  As a killer main I rotate between Trapper, Myers, Freddy, Huntress, Bubba...pretty much everyone but billy, spirit, nurse, hag, legion and clown lol.  I like to mix it up and find most killers fun.
---
Someone reported me to Sony because i won the game. This was at green ranks.
---
I don‚Äôt mind at all , I‚Äôm on console , I have perfect aim , always finsih the match with 3 gen max lamo , I will let one escape tho or two depends on the mood
---
I run BBQ, Pop, Surveillance, and depending on what kind of Survivors I play against all day I‚Äôll use I‚Äôm all Ears, but if I‚Äôm getting butt danced and 1-2k every match I‚Äôll put ruin on and go hard.
---
Um... Wtf? Did anything happen?
---
Just ignore them, survivors are toxic at these ranks.
---
Playstation Safety deleted the message in the chain. I just asked him ''reported for what exactly'' and he said ''you'll see''.
---
Just ignore them, survivors are toxic at these ranks. Actually, I write "*waits for toxicity*" after a match. That should get them.
---
I'm confused, when is the release of Level 1? I can only find 2 and more.
---
Welp, guess he was wrong lol
---
This is my first match...
---
That makes sense, these days survivors have more incentive to do separate gens ever since the "multiple survivors on one gen" nerf from awhile back
---
I think I like this replacement best as well
---
From my experience, green and early purple ranks are way more toxic than red ranks for some reason
---
Hey, if it works it works am I right?
---
Seeing as how you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything except the base game, no, no it shouldn‚Äôt be free to play. You‚Äôre wrong and your opinion is wrong
---
I swear I‚Äôm gonna mori you!
---
I don‚Äôt get it

Hell yeah boi

---
I like this a lot lol
---
Don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it.
---
If hey run up during the grab animation there‚Äôs no way they could get off the 3-second wait time for it to activate. And why not just drop the person and pull them out of the locker? Somethings fishy here . . . And why comment on DS and say it‚Äôs toxic if they didn‚Äôt even use it? That‚Äôs just childish. That‚Äôs exactly like when survivors complain about BBQ. I‚Äôm not defending anyone play style, I‚Äôm just not agreeing with you.
---
I never said you had to pay for anything lol but I think more people would if the game was free to play also why we being hostile? What does the game going free to play do to you? Nothin changes if anything we get more players and more people buying dlc and cosmetics. Cause there is no longer a paywall
---
Good lord I don‚Äôt knowwww. I hate myself for it. I just had given up and thought ‚Äúmight as well be do something while I died lol‚Äù IF ONLY I KNEW THE HATCH WAS GONNA SPAWN RIGHT NEXT TO ME AJOSHDKAHSAIW I stared at the screen for 15 min after it happened cause I didnt know if I should laugh or cry :l
---
this build has nice synergy, i like it
---
Claudette for survivor, at first my friend said I should play her because she can heal herself, now I use her because she is better at stealth than wraith and she is short and quiet.
---
Mikey for Killer great killer when it comes to walking around and scaring people. Plus when he gets his new cosmetics I am literally getting it just for the screwdriver.
---
Than.... Don't be f'n cheap and pay the 1000 Auric Cells? (Which you can even earn back)
---
They only said all survs are over 20 iirc
---
If you're a pansy, yeah.
---
I'd love to know that threshold. It must be something like dc 100 times a day. God, I remember when Legion came out and every 2nd or 3rd match at red rank had at least 1 dc early on. But the crybabies all cried about Legion and the devs nerfed Legion instead of actually punishing ragequitting to coddle the crybabies.
---
Alright then who‚Äôs your favorite? John Wayne Gacy? Ted Bundy? Jeffrey Dahmer? The way I was saying was in a broad way. I obviously know he‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs favorite.
---
9 out of 10 leatherfaces are campers who can't get kills otherwise
---
The worst for me is sometimes I get survivor challenges, but when I exit out of the daily challenges and check it again before hopping in a game it changesüòë And usually to killer challenges
---
Ninjas fortnite character
---
Yeah, I play off and on. I''l play for a month and take 2 months off then come back.
---
They could definitely get out. But the point here is still that it's not always toxic. If it were the toxic kind, they would have bolted as soon as he got close/came into view. This is more "hit me for some free points before I exit".
---
Why is it always only Leatherface?
---
1) He's a low tier killer whose best build is middling at most.
---
2) His power is useful for downing two or more people in a small area. Like around a hook.
---
3) There's a lot of people who level Leatherface up first because of BBQ and Chili, so they aren't good with him or Killer in general.
---
4) Sometimes you just want to meme, and Insidious LF is the biggest meme in the game.
---
Correct that iron will counters her, but stridor counters iron will so, yeah they can‚Äôt hide from me,
---
Thanks I felt the same way. 
---
*Pick me up. Pick me up stupid* 
---
Cringe as fuck.
---
Sorry im late, but its only some. Certain ones wont be put in shop, but most will. At least, thats what i heard.
---
That is an accurate statement
---
I want these two plus Tucker and Dale (vs Evil).
---
Lmao, agreed. And BBQ will become everyone's default perk since it is very good for starters
---
Even finding them in their natural habitat is hard enough.
---
Piper Perry?
---
Myers in the distance
---
I‚Äôm assuming you and your team cleansed? Here‚Äôs advice DONT CLEANSE WHEN YOURE GOING AGAINST THE PLAGUE
---
You know what? you got me there
---
Just use play with your food and understand game mechanics. FunGoose has an entire montage of Leatherface games up on YouTube where he regularly 4ks at 4 or 5 gens
---
I saw this one reddit post and a guy said spirit was extremely easy and how he bullied one. And I was thinking  h o w

Nah.

Dude I would love this. What would Dexter‚Äôs power be?
---
Ok but then why didn‚Äôt they leave? They were basically giving free kills
---
I‚Äôm not confused but still rin probably aint a teen
---
Not doing well on your very first time playing a different killer = only spirit can do well?
---
Nah. Playing non meta characters and doing well is more fun than destroying survivors not because of individual skill but because of the killer you play.
---
They wanted to be toxic but fucked up when doing so
---
The second person wasn‚Äôt even close to the exit
---
Yeah I run iron will often and I find it pretty cool. I prefer that than adrenaline, makes me move into jungle gyms or hide way easier. Which is great against the best killers and weaker killers by just losing line of sight, so.. why not? I love it even if I can't heal myself I'm fine
---
About balancing.. yeah.. they don't play as much and their decisions are based on theories not how it actually works in practice. They take the results on ptb and live servers and theorize, that's what many SH do actually but at least the others do some ground testing since they have enough money to do so. They got better yeah but sometimes they make bad decisions.
---
I said this many times, but things got nerfed if people DC because of it. Even just to mere entitlement, now it's nurse, wait a little and spirit iri heads will be nerfed soon. Even if are the add ons that make them annoying they'll nerf everything, exactly how they did with nurse for the exact same reasons. They go too hard on things, like MoM now is shit, 90% of new nurse add ons are meme add ons and when they nerfed Freddy at first from bottom tier became Freddy tier.. they exaggerate. Can't say much about the last dlc, it was actually good even if the killer perk to explode gens.. don't remember the name honestly, I forget names easily, would've been cooler if attached to terror radius
---
AAA the really really needed thing they have to do is FIX the god damn field of view for killer. It's so god damn small.. it's not okay! For some people gives headaches or worse, it's too small. Lucky for me I don't have any of those issues BUT it's a problem! If I'm not wrong at the beggining was wider then they fked up and kept it this way. Even if not make them wider and FKING add a colorblind option.. it's something people are asking for who know how long..
---
Dwight, you beautiful weirdo.
---
Op said horny gamers don‚Äôt get rights.
---
I love this so much
---
I think he'll be the one in trouble for false reporting
---
The Legion said in another comment that she had dead hard buy didn't time it correctly and got hit
---
It goes both ways. Killers run toxic shit all the time to, its gotten to the point the game is stale.
---
But its bullshit though, Sometimes you play your favourite killer and do very well, then you get discouraged to play them when you lose, but when you play a strong killer like nurse or spirit you feel more powerful, the survivors actually have to fear something.
---
When playing another other killers, You cant waste a second of time or else the gens are done
---
That moment when you change a challenge as the new daily challange is coming in and end up getting no challenges.
---
Turn the chat off. Seriously. There is an arrow/slider and I‚Äôve been playing for weeks now with it off. Much easier!
---
Jake is good at surviving in harsh situations so imma gonna have to go with him
---
Don‚Äôt run it. It‚Äôs broken rn
---
Did they said something about the goodies at the end of a tome? Do they disappear like the fragments or are they permanent?
---
You definitely can't get there from anywhere, but you expand the radius of achieving a basement hook by easily 10-15m. Maybe more.
---
Welp I haven't seen many spirits with stridor but yeah it counter it but also fucks it up. You hear someone that's close like is way further so the first phasing are kind screwed
---
Anyway I would equip that anyway as I already do instead of adrenaline. It helps way more against everyone and you won't see as many spirits with stridor at high ranks. Stridor is more for new spirit to learn since you might need other stuff in red ranks to keep pressure
---
Probably gonna take you on this. Maybe its just every game reaches its breakpoint, and for DBD its at 300 hrs. Gonna be on and off too
---
Buy Ghostface and you don't even need incidious to be a dick.
---
I believe they said over the whole 70 tiers, you get your cells back, plus around 400 extra
---
90% of my matches these days. Cant even remember the last time I heard gates get powered up. Every match I get 3 gen, 2 teammates dead, me running from a killer with miracle level jukes because every pallet has been used, and that last random mate watching and waiting...as killer gets faster and adapts to my patterns. 
---
R.I.P to me...gg ez
---
i just find it weird that people call her thicc when shes not. you realize you cna have a good booty without being thicc, right.....
---
Yeah i my game cycle is DBD, League, Magic Arena... its just that its getting harder and harder to cycle back to DBD. And eventually "Eh, maybe make a reddit post on how hard it is to get in agin on DBD"
---
Freddy
---
Ayy
---
No thanks, that is all against his character. He never killed (at least with his own hands, lmao) so I guess he wouldn't be a good dbd killer
---
i cant tell if you called them a millennial because you ignored him saying hes a minor, or deliberately since he called the other dude a boomer
---
I really think that is a good new little thing, because espicially in DbD we need more bloodpoints, and a lot more stuff to do
---
Seems more fitting for claudette than kate lol.
---
Looks like you were dicking around instead of
---
just doing the gens and leaving?
---
The game is stronger than ever, I‚Äôd o my see a reason for it to be f2p if the average amount of people playing daily decreased significantly
---
It had to be done sometimes, you have to know when you can actually save someone and not get killed yourself
---
Thank you for your time come back when you thought of something better
---
holy shit that bug is hilarious
---
In the early days it was piss easy because everyone and their dog was playing and also using mics. Communication was so key as it let people set up plays where you could trick Jason to use his teleport power to some random location that wasn‚Äôt the phone or car. Doing that put that power in a cooldown which allowed for counselors to use the gas, battery, or phone fuse. The phone was possibly the most powerful way to escape as it allowed all counselors a way to escape, kind of like gens and exit gates in DBD.
---
Somehow a couple of months after the game launched, more and more people started to use mics less and less to the point where only 1 person in about every lobby you can get in to now uses one. Still, you can somewhat communicate via dropping items as in a couple patches in to the game‚Äôs life, they finally added icons for items to be shown on the map if they were dropped. Before you had to rely on word of mouth of survivors that were still alive.
---
Pretty much now it‚Äôs all now about trying to kite Jason so that someone going for an objective trips a trap, heals themselves, and then tries to get the objective done. Jason only has a limited number of traps so if you‚Äôre able to make him use all of them, you‚Äôll have an advantage if you work together, best done through mics. Jasons who patrol the objectives will most certainly win as all they have to do is kill survivors that get to close. Killing survivors may come at a cost, but only if the survivors Jason plays against know the steps on how to kill Jason. Dying in the game isn‚Äôt the end as you have the possibility to come back as Tommy, who is key in killing Jason. I‚Äôve only ever pulled it off once, and of course it was still when the game was thriving.

Legion
---
Amazing character concept, great cosmetics, fun to play, can have some pretty damn annoying builds revolving around their power, basically a BP machine with BBQ and BP offerings, 
---
They're slightly underpowered ATM but I'm having a blast with them! 
---
Nea
---
Great cosmetics, small body (easier to stealth) and an awesome set of perks!
---
Ikr I havent played survivor in a little bit cause I play killer most, but out of the 15 games I played they all tunneled and camped.
---
Broken
---
So o know what egc does it's when the entity come out of the ground but what does it stand for?
---
Can we take a minute to appreciate that crispy hand drawn disney style.
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
Solution: after the disconnect you still get to keep the body, and can carry it to a hook and hook it for an auto sacrifice with all the benefits.
---
You still lost vs a bad huntress, therefore suiciding on hook or dcing will get you into a game that requires less effort to do better in. 
---
Don't bullshit like it wasn't just you fighting a bad huntress, it was.
---
i can hear this image
---
also work with escape cakes
---
You don't get that choice for SEVERAL gens on most maps.
---
Myers does not move faster in Evil Within 3
---
Lunge Range and vault speed, that's it
---
I hated it when it came out for being a potential DBD killer, but sadly competition didnt work out :/
---
Explain
---
It would of been better with jane
---
wait you can turn the chat off?
---
Well see that's the point, he's the invincible movie villain like he should be. Counselors have pocket knives, but if a man who can smash a door grabs you there SHOULD be no escape
---
Maybe they‚Äôll do this in a map reworks ¬Ø\_„ÉÑ_/¬Ø
---
How?
---
Survivors
---
Jake, Meg, David, Ace, and Bill would be rank 1
---
Nea, Laurie, Bill, Ash, and Feng would be around rank 3
---
Tapp, Dweet, Claudette, Quinten, Adam, Jane, Nancy, and Steve are probably rank 5-7
---
Kate and Jeff, pronounced Yeff because I said so, are pretty fucked at rank 12-10 however Kate is objectively best girl meaning the entity lets her do as she pleases so she is secretly rank 0.
---
Killers basing this solely off of their natural lust to kill and the amount of effort the entity needs to put in to force them to kill/do what it wants.
---
Obligatory Nea, Michael, Ghostface, Clown, Dr, Demogorgon and Specifically Joe are rank 1
---
Spirit, Nurse, Frank, Julie, Hillbilly, Trapper, Hag, and Huntress are rank 3-5
---
Plague is rank 5-8
---
Leatherface could be at any rank from 9 and up
---
Susie and Wraith are rank 11
---
The pig/Amanda is rank 13-20 as even in the movies she was shown to frequently disobey Jigsaw whom she basically worshipped.
---
TBH Ghostface and the entity have to be lovers with how much Ghostface loves to kill, maybe their is already entity Nea x Ghostface hentai out their waiting to be discovered.
---
I probably forgot somebody so don't @ me
---
Most campers I have faced tend to act this way also based on their own bruised ego. I got facecamped by a Ghostface and he kept crouching and dancing around me on the hook, even when I started struggling. But I didn‚Äôt mind since my Kindred Perk warmed the others not to come near me.
---
Players who violate the sanctity of bloody party streamers should be perma-banned.
---
Yes. Tru3 tried playing 2 matches with no perks and only the IH for an add-on, and all 4 survivors DC'd both times instantly.
---
#ENOUGH.
---
I feel like ED could have.  
---
"its just the one killer then."  
---
The realization that its four against one unlocks a deep aura bond with the entity  
---
When the killer activates a perk that reveals your aura, you reveal his to you and only you for the duration of the reveal plus 1/2/3 seconds.  
---
Kinda off handed and i know the quote is from a different movie but i like the idea of all the Three Flavours Cornetto movies being connected, even by the entity.  
---
this would be kinda Op with distortion tbh, so criticize away it came off the top of my head.
---
Maybe put in a system where if you DC, say more than 3 times within 2 weeks you will start getting temp bans.
---
Claud was on last hook and Spirit went straight for her after less than half a minute of hook. I just wanted to give her some time.
---
Why would a killer intentionally let you ds them when instead leaving you useless to the team unless you bring unbreakable too?
---
You know what is good? Long hallways so you cannot break line of sight then small rooms that mostly have 1 exit.
---
I was excited for that map until I played it. I would rather have the game. I wish they would go back to releasing more outdoor maps, but make new environments entirely. Like dont just repeat the clown and purge but entirely new terrain.
---
I use claudette morel only because i like the self healing perk but now im getting tunneled every time because the killers think im toxic :(
---
I fear the really fast MM, The tunneling plague that throws up on you as if she's in your backpack, Bubbas chainsaw rampage that's faster than a running survivor and probably the docs ability to completely remove stealth (unless built around it via calm spirit). I usually escape vs them but they are INCREDIBLY frustrating to deal with. As far as leveling up, read into the emblems, lightbringer increases for each gen completed while also gaining points for totems. Unhooking should be the easiest, You gain points from being hit while he carries a survivor and lose points if he's hooked for more than 10 seconds (To clarify if he dies within 10 seconds you're refunded but if he taps in stage 2 for 10 seconds-then dies you lose points, Unhooking said person restores those lost points to all players while granting bonus unhooking points to the player unhooking him/her blah blah it's actually quite a lot lol I would look into it though, Knowing how to win and how to pip up are two completely different things
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter how fast you run, Myers walks faster. 
---
*tier III music starts*
---
It‚Äôs not even about strategy or being a dick. What else are you supposed to do? Try to find other healthy survivors? I don‚Äôt camp in endgame cause I‚Äôm a dick. There‚Äôs just literally no better option for me
---
LoL already has a good system. Dc = 5 minute ban, second DC then is 10, then 20, ect ect.
---
How have people missed the shitpost tag for 18 hours
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
Survivors: *pick map offering*
---
Also survivors: ‚ÄúuNLucKy mAP‚Äù
---
Which none of us did
---
You still wind up with maps where the basement spawns in some misbegotten corner and the survivors don't hang out there.
---
I think unlucky out of the Macmillan estate maps.
---
Imagine being this bitter!
---
I don't get it either
---
Well as I said in my comment, the heartbeat doesn't tell you where the killer is on Hawkins as even if you're upstairs and the killer is directly under you on the lower floor, the heartbeat makes it so you can't tell. Sometimes we need to commit to a generator in order to be efficient and not waste time in which case Bubba could definitely sneak into that room and get the chainsaw.
---
A guy from my friends list was a survivor in a dedicated server, while I was the killer
---
Just makes it better mate~
---
All cosmetics will come to the store eventually. But some will come during specific seasons. For example I imagine the new nurse skin will come next year Halloween.
---
Survivors with ds: *runs towards the killer after being unhooked*
---
Killer: *downs them but doesn‚Äôt pick them up to avoid ds*
---
Survivors: *surprised Pikachu face*
---
I think he figured out how to zoom in and out on his 2003 Blackberry.
---
I'd argue that a progression/rewards system that you *don't* have to pay for is the most consumer friendly system
---
Yo Hawkins sucks in general. Like for both sides. I almost always let out a *sigh* when it comes up.
---
Survivors also DC against:
---
Prayer bead Spirit
---
Omega blink Nurse
---
Insta saw Billy
---
Mega slow down Freddy.
---
There‚Äôs quite the handful of bullshit on both sides like insta heals and the commodious toolbox with instructions and wire spool. We can all agree.
---
Yeah I know but they chose it. They knew there was a chance they would get that map. They probably were hoping for the one with the infinite
---
Who was the first survivor to be unhooked? I don‚Äôt recognize her with that skin.
---
I rather be a gen rusher, get targeted by killer, get hooked, and rinse and repeat then be a "crouch humping" survivor.
---
I don't understand the 10% action speed in Boldness actions. Only thing I can imagine that working with is hook sabotage and totem cleansing. One is a dead mechanic and the other is done really fast (12 seconds). The other two perks sound cool though!
---
I assumed that the killer is already very good and doesnt do mistakes
---
Just 1 hit gets you a free 40 seconds of regression? Maybe a hook but jeez...
---
I like to thinl that the pictures of De ja vu and Pbject of obsession are just Dbd's form of sharingan from naruto.
---
Low effort which makes it not funny
---
Commenting so there can't be 69 comments.
---
Peanits said on the forum that it was the name of the tome.
---
Much like your comments here, I imagine. Sad
---
The best thing he can do for everyone is to last until the final moment... but if me and my brother take notice of a struggling survivor even though we didn't make an attempt (due to his situation), We will come for that motherfucker or We'll trade places but get him to escape at the least. There's nothing like a random that understands the situation and goes against it (Even if it's for struggle points)
---
I always thought it saved 1 charge/second but I could be wrong...
---
I see Legion has been buffed
---
It‚Äôs a fucking meme. Get over yourself.
---
Nightmare fuel
---
wow epic response bro, totally pwned me ownage sauce
---
Hope you're still having fun :)
---
Still it's only 3 hatchets, it's not like you're not gonna get downed with normal hatchets if you run in a straight line
---
Survivors usually dc when they get hit in general xD(from a fellow survivor main)
---
Killers dc when they get bullied
---
Mall or hospital would have been better. Maybe even the school.
---
Ghostface mains rise up!
---
Except for the fact that integrated graphics is not made for playing graphically intensive video games, and supporting ultra low end hardware limits what they can do with the game for everyone else.
---
So killers playing the game should be banned
---
Wtf does M2 stand for? I totally agree with you btw
---
Hes not one of the choices or I would of gotten him :/
---
What a fun idea! Too bad only my boyfriend and cousin play.
---
Reeeeee
---
Damn Tombstones are pretty good for less than $2. Might actually be my favorite brand of frozen pizza, actually. They're nice and saucy.
---
I think the lab could have been cool I just hate the small long hallways with bad pallets.
---
Ace has three perks all with hands in them and you didn‚Äôt use any of them. Smh, I feel the disrespect.
---
Is that me in the picture?
---
When I‚Äôm in a game with survivors and two of them disconnect I lead them to gens and let them leave.
---
When I play Ghostface, I teabag to show my friendship.
---
Rest In Peace escape cake
---
Grrrr ra rrrrr aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAA!
---
You're the one who commented 4 words I would say that's pretty low effort
---
Your words are filling a valuable silence. You need not respond, as you are now defeated. You may go.
---
My favorite is Steve and legion
---
Basically survivor version of Make your choice
---
I feel you. This game made me disable messages because of the players. (PS4)
---
What's funny is that instead of messages, people will send friend requests and talk shit in the message you can attach to it
---
Definitely am!
---
Well, this is racist
---
Wtf
---
That thing is creepier than any of the killers in this game.
---
Upstairs of that house on Coldwind is a free gen, because literally nothing can make that gen worth defending. You've got to navigate around the house to an entrance, walk around the house to the stairs, and then navigate the upstairs labyrinth just to get to the damn gen. Not to mention that unless the basement is in the house there's only one hook within walking distance: the one that they put right next to the gen so that they didn't have to scrap the whole house design and start over.
---
they should still refund the players
---
Ace needs his hands to save us from Perks Survivorman
---
The licensed survivors, with the exception of perhaps Tapp and Quentin, would easily make it to Rank 1.
---
Gotta get that brown toolbox
---
Thank you
---
I always thought the dark passenger should be the killer and Dexter as a survivor who escaped from it. Imagine the dark passenger taking the form of maybe Brian.
---
Or you just got some random poor Target employee fired worst case scenario. 
---
Literally anything could go wrong at that store and you could get fired.
---
Yo, was this game like 12 or 15 hrs ago by any chance?
---
Can we get someone to have this happen to them on hawkins so we can create a dbd version of that one meme format (we all know what I'm talking about)
---
PS I was really sick when i was playing hence the very un optimal plays
---
Well its your hardware that is causing the problem so i don't think you'll get a refund. If your setup is not up to date its not there fault. I understand it sucks, but you cant't support everything forever, i mean intelHD is almost 10 years old.
---
Survivors, too. Nothing suvks worse than playing with a friendly killer who is helping everyone get bloodpoibta and some asshole is BMing and try harding all over the map
---
As a survivor, getting into chases and doing gens. You don‚Äôt even have to survive tbh.
---
For killer, just play. Don‚Äôt tunnel or camp since this hurts you. As you get more and more 4ks, the more you will level up.
---
Tbh honest though, you shouldn‚Äôt be in a hurry to rank up. People get very intense as you rank up. It‚Äôs not as fun as it is in the lower ranks.
---
As a Ghostface main I agree
---
Ok cool, I can agree with that. I hate those kind of campers.
---
Who... who took the picture?
---
How many does otz have?
---
but 1. it keeps getting updated
---
2. i could run that game at60 fps with top graphics
---
R I P Friday The 13th. You won‚Äôt be missed.
---
yeah ive been changing up killers and perk builds, although not yet doc and hag. Got tired of Spirit after 1 game. I main trapper and ghostface and I have to  grind bloodpoints to have the fun perks for other killers, BBQ to start.  Im still interested in learning Nurse, legion and clown though, but like i said I have to grind BP for them and its getting harder to queue up,  
---
For survivor, i noticed that the perks are really bland. Either second chance, healing+, detection or mobility. And WGLF + second chance (DS, BT) always takes most of my slots, leaving only 1 perk for lols. I thought i would have fun with Divertion, but never saw a chance to use it.
---
lol what the fuck
---
This is the demon that looks at you when you have sleep paralysis.
---
The simple fact that you don‚Äôt see the benefit to that Ghostface play means you clearly don‚Äôt understand mind games.  Nothing about them needs to be symmetrical, and in fact they usually are not.  Even still, the simple fact that she can‚Äôt see the survivor at all opens up plenty of options to take that they normally can‚Äôt.  If the survivor doesn‚Äôt know how to capitalize on them that‚Äôs another story.
---
What you described with the huntress is not a mindgame.  It is merely a matter of timing.
---
oh my bad, i was pretty sure all of his actions are faster as well though
---
It‚Äôs to OP!! BhVR needs to nerf this perk!
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know
---
I think what he means is if everyone is going to try and rush the basement, why would he leave the area. Gens aren't getting done, so why waste the opportunity.
---
If they remove your hooks you have no choice but to slug, their fault.
---
Nahh the definition  of weeb is, A¬†weeb¬†is a derisive term for a non-Japanese person who is so obsessed with Japanese culture that they wish they were actually Japanese. The joke here is that Adam went to Japan so not that he actually is one but it's fun to say so.
---
‚Äúfun‚Äù? Please define your version of ‚Äúfun‚Äù. All I got when I played Jason was groups that took the game hostage drumming me infinitely with the plentiful amount of objects littered around the map.
---
trapper is my worst fave killer to play. its like my character is wearing magnetic shoes. i get traps even in odd places
---
The game is roughly the same... but Hawkins is so small the killer could be everywhere and no where at the same time. I love it when survivors bring me there as doctor they can't do anything all game 30s. in they are at rank 3 madness and every 10s. after they snap out they are in it again :-)
---
Give teacher man more love
---
Bill be like: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELOOADING, REEEELOADING!!
---
This. You see a lot of camping leatherfaces because his power is uniquely good for camping. Not many other situations in which you will be hitting multiple people at the same time. Add on to that the fact that he doesn't have any real pressure potential like Billy who can zoom across the map and you have a recipe for a camping killer.
---
That all being said, I run into way more camping Ghostfaces than Leatherface.
---
Perkins? You facking asshole!
---
probably
---
i never really liked dark sense, even after the buff
---
Honestly with optimal trap placement and praying to every god out there hes manageable
---
He has slippery meat, we're doomed
---
I can understand her not wanting to farm. She doesnt have to if she doesnt want to, but the post game message was uncalled for
---
&gt; In the post game chat, they called me a shitty killer for slugging and a tryhard. They said that slugging was a dick move and that I should have picked them up. 
---
Crybaby pussies, pay them no mind. They should've played better.
---
Gotta really commend Otz here. A ton of for thought went into the build. Inb4 Tru3 says he goes against this all the time(I really like Tru3 but I wanna meme him)
---
Thanks, nice words in DBD is iridescent rare
---
That‚Äôs where I‚Äôve been at lately with this game, don‚Äôt care anymore and the higher you go up, the worse it gets especially with the braindead randoms you get in the purple ranks and even into the red ranks. In the red ranks its every man for himself and there is no ‚ÄúTEAM‚Äù
---
PS4 btw
---
Bruh do you hear yourself? The killer is supposed to kill you, period. They can do it however they want. Survivors are supposed to do 5 tens and escape. If that means 1 person BM'ing and distracting the killer than that's what that means. The toxicity in this community is unjustified and ruins what once was my favorite game
---
It was the blurst of times, it was the blorst of times.
---
I swear I have the WORST time with Plagues, Spirits, and Pigs
---
And I have the best time with Ghostfaces, Legions, Shapes, and Huntresses
---
The worst ‚Äútrio‚Äù always includes the word ‚Äúfuck‚Äù or ‚Äúez‚Äù
---
Wtf do people expect a killer to do when they sabotage hooks? Like, really? They even ran to a corner of the map knowing the nearby hooks were sabotaged and that you wouldn't be able to make it to a hook in time. If they're gonna play that way, that's 100% on them and not the killer. This is why, if you're playing sabo squad, you need No Mither or at least Unbreakable. I wouldn't be surprised if most killers ended up slugging them until they bled out instead of hooking them when the hooks came back.
---
I can only really advise for killer but all you gotta do is play, don't camp, try prevent healing if you can, hook as much as you can(preferably three hooks to kill someone). Tbh though purple ranks are hell and I'm glad I'm back in green with rank reset because it will always stomp or get stomped, could never try new killers without the game ending in 5 minutes or less
---
Thanks, it just honestly gets to me. I know some people are very hardcore about this game, but I‚Äôm just trying to have fun. I just get upset when people act so toxic
---
I always enjoy it if it hsppens in the first third of the game. Leaves less pallets for later
---
Whoever doesn‚Äôt agree with Jane‚Äôs thiccness is just wrong. :)
---
I've never met a toxic pig, but I play on ps4 so I dont get many messages. They may be more prominent on pc. And almost every ghostface I've played with has memed with me at least once in the match
---
Oh if they added them as survivors along with some voice lines from the movie, my wallet would be opening immediately!! Take My Money!
---
The fact they wanted to go for Ironworks or Suffocation is disgusting.
---
Idk.
---
The past is beyond our control. You have to accept this in order to move forward. But there is freedom in this revelation. Everything you do, every decision you make from now on, will open doors to the future
---
Around 2400 if I remember correctly.
---
Braindead zoomer who can only express their emotions through memes
---
We all used to be stupid as teenagers. Well, almost all. No way that guy is older than 15.
---
üëèüëè
---
Do whatever it takes to get old fredster. Absolute beast and a ton of fun to play!
---
Just because something works good right now doesn't mean they have to support it. I worked in customerservice and had to tell someone its not unusual our streamingservice doesn't support his iphone 4 anymore, which is also 10 years old. Eventhough it worked fine, we had to move forward.
---
I‚Äôm honestly down for this
---
That last one is kinda like kindred, I like it.
---
Survivor: David King
---
Reason?: I tend to be the distraction when I play DBD, I‚Äôm able to run the killers around for a long time and am the best at it in my group of friends. It probably also doesn‚Äôt help that am a huge, hulking white dude in a tank top that the Killer can‚Äôt catch for some reason, I don‚Äôt even try to blend it at all. 
---
Killer: All of them lol, maxed out Doctor and Hillbilly. All other killers are P1 or P2 and lvl50.
---
Play the game. Don‚Äôt expect free points. Want free points? Play killer and work hard.
---
I haven't had a Survivor challenge in months. They are all killer. Popped my Legion cherry for 45000 BP
---
Hell yes. I‚Äôd be willing to say 8/10 survivors that I take pity on aren‚Äôt aware that I‚Äôm trying to give them a break.
---
Not about free points. It‚Äôs about the uncalled for message at the end.
---
The not farming is completely fine. I personally hate farming, but the post game chat was stupid.
---
r/ISpamCommentsWithReferencesToOtherSubredditsBecauseIWantToBeFunnyWithoutSayingAnythingFunnyAtAll
---
Was this on ps4? Totally could have been me üòÇ played a myers game and half the game my camera was doing weird stuff hahaha.
---
Exactly. I‚Äôm ok with not farming.
---
Last time I got one, it did change to Leatherface or something
---
I know man. When stuff like this happens, I just want to dc. Not because of the crappy map, but because it bothers me that people go through these lengths to ensure a win. I know it may sound like an overreaction, but it honestly disgusts me. They don‚Äôt want a fun and balanced game, they want to win. I don‚Äôt want to play against people like that
---
Or you could also wait for the perk to show up in the Shrine of Secrets and purchase it for 2,000 iridescent shards (currency get from leveling up)

Thanks for the feedback! Anything peek your interest specifically? Or was it more for anything other than his current state? Lol
---
Hi scared, I‚Äôm dad
---
I thought I was in r/gay_irl and that these two had just called madly in love. But no, I'm in the murder game sub :(
---
How much do you want for it??
---
Dried Cicada and ummm... I'd say Bloodied Water actually, but you can make the case for Cracked Turtle Egg and Swamp Orchid Necklace. The Hag's rarer addons are more unique effects that don't make much of an impact (Granma's Heart and Disfigured Ear), memes (Scarred Hand and Waterlogged Shoe) or powerful but with distinct drawbacks (Rusty Shackles and Mint Rag).
---
Theoretically any Mint Rag build is best, but in the reality of play Mint Rag can make it hard to teleport to the right traps at the right time during chases and so is normally reduced to facilitating long-distance camping with Make Your Choice.
---
Hawkins lab is kinda cool. I‚Äôve gone up against potato killers and good killers. And it really depends on how good the players are tbh. Like its never a garanteed escape/win all the time and i like that.
---
Lol!
---
valid proof that watching truetalent drops your IQ points considerably.
---
Aight its simple. Call him out on it. and keep doing so eventnaully it will click in his head that what he is doing is fucking him over
---
I've heard the higher ranks are took seriously but I believe I'm good enough, I like the challenge.
---
your computer doesn't even meet the minimum requirements on the steam specs page so no matter what you aren't entitled to a refund
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I'd increase the time to 60/50/40 seconds so it is consistent with MYC for Killers and other perks with that lifetimer.
---
Also, you'd better post it in r/PerkByDaylight bc this subreddit is just shitty memes
---
Come to the dark side my child....where there are yet to be any exclusives and a slightly better multiplayer system. Seriously though, you ever get a box I'm down to play
---
yeah, if you mark stab, someone screams and they're like "wut?" TBH, i want to remove ruin, bbq but im not confident nor rich enough

hours don't matter

For killer, I tend to flip between them a bit. But as of this post, I would say Demogorgon. He has good utility, a fun bug to mess with, and is the only other killer besides Myers to have different chase music.
---
For survivor, they all are kinda the same tbh. In terms of looks, I find Jake to look quite chill, especially since I just got the most american jake skin.
---
Dude a Spirit will still find you even with that 50%.
---
Or Tucker and Dale
---
:‚Äô(
---
everyteam need the two gen rushers. the unhooker. and the guy who runs the killer around all game so none of us die.
---
What a good and real counter argument.  Truly, you‚Äôve shown me up.
---
This is a masterpiece! Add more perks! Add more perks until it beats Picasso
---
These memes are dead and gone so long, 17s so gone.
---
What's the Four Hex Build? I can guess Thrill and Ruin, but what about the other two?
---
In that 2 seconds the met has pulled down all the pallets on the map
---
I like the chessboard a lot more
---
I always wanted to be the guy who runs from the killer but nobody ever repairs gens if I don‚Äôt do it
---
Make new friends my guy
---
I‚Äôm not that good as survivor (even though I play a lot lol). But I just chill and have fun with it. 
---
Not sure how to handle over the top, super serious people in this game because at its heart, this game IS a casual game and not a hardcore mlg game. 
---
He just sounds immature tbh, so yeah, just make new friends and play. There are many dbd groups around that would love to play 
---
Though I can see the issue with playing with your lower ranked friends, because it forces them into your rank of killers which won‚Äôt go well for them lol
---
I mean, I've never liked anything about the Spirit. She's basically pre-rework Legion but she goes invisible, is faster, and only takes 2 hits to down you instead of 3 or more.
---
r/subsifellfor
---
I dunno who Ace is gonna save with Up the Ante and Open Handed
---
Nah was on computer, I bet your match was fun though xD
---
The entity of course
---
Yeah, that was a rude awakening for me too. I just took it as a sign of enthusiasm since there's no jump mechanic, but did it with a killer I'd had a pretty good game with and he got upset in the comments. Feelsbadman. :(
---
I‚Äôve said it many times in other threads, turn the chat off. Regardless of an all out slaughter or being smashed by a good killer. Leave it off. Don‚Äôt expect free things.
---
That‚Äôs PS4
---
Shut the up
---
It‚Äôs not even about it being a challenge. It‚Äôs about people using disgusting builds, overpowered add ons, and broken map offerings to ensure a win. 
---
You‚Äôre going to get Nurses and Spirits 90% of the time with overpowered addons that will suck the fun out of the game.
---
You‚Äôre going to get very sweaty swf teams with meta perks and Haddonfield offerings that T-bag at the exit. 
---
It‚Äôs not about it being hard. It‚Äôs about people being so disgusting and sweaty that you won‚Äôt have fun. At the lower ranks, people usually aren‚Äôt like this.
---
I will break you.
---
Yeah I figured that out a little after commenting , he also pm‚Äôd me about it
---
. . .after viewing this, I'm just gonna quietly lay here and question my existence and why I share it with this creation.
---
I picked unbreakable.
---
Jokes on you
---
Devour and Haunted
---
As a kate main, i feel offended
---
Well I'm not slugging
---
My issue which these ideas are the fact that it wouldn‚Äôt help.  Moris take a decent chunk of time, about the same amount of time it would take me to walk someone to a hook, unless it‚Äôs really really far.  
---
I just think moris should be more rare.
---
The green one is fine, but make it the purple 
---
And the eboni is crazy, but just make it it‚Äôs own rarity.  Like a very very small chance to find it.
---
Reconnect: "When a teammate disconnects, Reconnect forces the player to rejoin your game when they re-enter matchmaking."
---
Aanndd another match against spirit. And of course I die, jesus christ I fucking hate her
---
I'm not funny so hah
---
Aimless:  Scratch Marks left by you spawn further apart (kinda the opposite of Wraiths Predator Perk)
---
Totally hoped this was a full chess set
---
Oh shit, I might go with DS + unbreakable next
---
Wouldn‚Äôt those have been removed by now? At least tunneling Moris?
---
Either way people can play spirit and there‚Äôs nothing you or anyone can do about it! I will gladly go against spirits accepting whatever they bring into the trial like I do with literally any other killer or survivor that isn‚Äôt hacking or cheating (aka doing something you can‚Äôt do normally in game) or what not. Also, I report people that disconnect and report people that send me rude messages because you can indeed be reported for that on Xbox one, before I block them of course.
---
Had this happen to me with Kate on the same map, it's hilarious
---
everyone trying to show survivors aren‚Äôt always bad and killers aren‚Äôt always good despite everyone already knowing it: ‚ÄúSuRvIvOr BaD kIlLeR gOoD‚Äù wElL aCtUaLlY-
---
Ok homophobe
---
I've been on the fence about getting him anyway, but now I definitely have to.
---
I'd love to have this perk just to beat the shit out of Spirits
---
Care to explain a bit more? And tbh It sounds more like you want more of a super simplistic change with no interplay in mind, Essentially just hope there's enough pallets and that the basement isn't close. "The Cannibal, Ladies and Gentlemen". which is a very bad idea, There's no depth or strategy past get a hook and camp which is what i was going for with him
---
I mean the main joke is that half of Freddy's power is literally just Clown / Doctor's power more-or-less directly copy-pasted onto Freddy.
---
No point in having them then.  Wouldn‚Äôt save any time
---
Unless they allow us to skip the kill animation and just auto kill them on 3rd hook
---
Otherwise it‚Äôs about the same amount of time as just hooking them, but with a wasted offering
---
I had an idea of where it's the killers competing for kills somehow keep them from working together
---
What if all the survivors aren‚Äôt doing anything but hiding behind a rock next to the hook waiting for the killer to leave RIGHT after he hooked that guy, and the killer know‚Äôs they are there?
---
This shit happens so often to me I gave it a nickname. Raptorcircling.
---
"I must go, my planet needs me."
---
I had a dude hide in a locker the entire game because he got to second stage on hook. I looped the killer for like 3 min when there was 1 gen left and this guy was camping the hatch..
---
:(
---
6 year old son: *spooked by spider*
---
Very nice dad: **teme...**
---
I havent played in awhile, someone explained EGC to me? Is it just a limit of how long you have yo GTFO so you cant teabag killers for 20 mins?
---
Lol Definitely a big part factor in the changes, While camping can be done with any killer for whatever reason i wanted to give him something to in place of simple looping the basement area and nodding his head.
---
Try and find me!
---
As a Survivor, surviving is actually not that important to rank up. Doing gens, going for unhooks/heals, and getting into some good chases with the killer. It will be much easier to rank up if you do a gen or 2, get some safe unhook saves, loop the killer for a bit and end up dying than it will be to hide all match and escape.
---
It's a popularity contest. It's a good general indicator but it's literally a popularity contest.
---
Every time a new Killer is released they become a new top tier. Any time a Killer or perk tweak is announced they get 1 Stared to shit. Decisive Strike is still at like A- tier because of all the people spamming it 1 star when it was reworked because "DS dead completely useless just ignore the Survivor."
---
I just camo on the hatch
---
Imagine getting triggered over in-game chat
---
Jane: (teabags)
---
Me, a baby nurse and rampaging lesbian: *wheeeeze*
---
Offerings should be game changing, and there are seven ways of saving a teamate from the killers grasp still being denied
---
Ah my mistake, thank you
---
No, you can still do gens and stuff to earn putrid serum I'm p sure
---
That's not better. That makes me sick (and not in a good way)
---
Especially when you're a stealth killer. 
---
I died a little inside when I was GF and realized one of them as OoO. The cross map spam pointing and teabagging man
---
I like the concept of these perks but I think they could use some fixing, maybe make it so you can only get a max of two tokens for the first perk.
---
just dodge all these hatchets not like the servers are already stupid as hell or anything or that they make hatchet hits bs at times
---
The devs wont rework all characters like freddy, so boosting the base saw stats would be a simple and effective change. Also, rewarding camping as the killers base power is so dumb and the something im glad the devs wouldnt do
---
Didn't they already nerf it for stealth killers?
---
Not in high ranks. Red rank survivors will do everything in their power to save me and help each other, if more for points than anything else.
---
Lmfao?!!!!!
---
This is why I teabag at exit
---
Don‚Äôt DC
---
A lot of them could use it because of how one note they are, With each killer comes more interesting powers (Not always), This would lead to earlier killers looking awfully pale in comparison. Also there's no camping buffs in the rework, But as it stands several killers can effectively hard camp. If anything i think the community just doesn't care and stacks killers wherever they land unless they are incredibly annoying such as Freddy who was a literal nightmare. If enough people wanted a low tier player to be reworked i'm sure Behaviour would go through the trouble
---
Perk Feng isn't real 
---
Survivorman Perk Bill Is
---
Rage when playing killer? Switch to survivor for a bit
---
Overall just mad at the game? Play a different game, watch YouTube, go grab sum to eat. Just get your mind off it. The worst thing you can do is continue playing when your clearly not having a fun time. Oh and don‚Äôt play w randoms. Like. Ever. That‚Äôll for sure bring the rage outta you
---
Yeah but i dont think anyone on this community wants this bubba rework.
---
Bing bong you are wrong
---
Here‚Äôs the flaw in your logic. It doesn‚Äôt take 2-3 minutes to down a survivor so... yeah.
---
Its the oingo boingo brothers ending
---
Or have it effect chests too
---
When going for adpet Laurie, I was a low rank and the nerf to it wasn't in place and I was just bullying the rank 20s. The pig kept trying to sneak up on me and a wraith tried to mindgame me but couldn't. I still feel bad about it.
---
Yeah so what? Atleast i dont express myself only by blaming others, maybe you could enjoy some memes too, i have my taste and you have yours, now go dead hard into a tree and get a concussion
---
Looks like "The Fool" tarot card
---
Cool "earhooks"
---
I‚Äôm the same when I play killer, when I‚Äôm survivor I could really care less so you should try that sometimes but being killer can be frustrating when you go against a strong team and they non stop t bag or flashlight you and shit lol, I‚Äôm sure it happens to everyone though but like others said maybe switch to survivor sometimes or just do something else for a bit
---
I rage for both killer and survivor. And playing w "randoms" as in joining a random match as survivor?
---
Unless they have balanced landing. It's straight broken on that map.
---
By ‚Äúlate game‚Äù I think he means after the exit gates are already open. In that scenario, literally the only thing you can do is secure your kill, hope you can snag another if they get greedy, and pray for the safety pip
---
Nice! Reach far and beyond. One day you'll get all P3 with all perks, you just gotta believe! ^-^
---
I was gonna say they're at least 4 here. Jack's are good too.
---
But only for BP now I think.
---
Actually I'm sure a few of them would pick this over the current basement camping fiend
---
I get that it can be annoying but if the game were balanced around swf, solo survivors would suffer more than they already do. And then everyone would just play swf and killers would complain more. It is annoying but 4 man swf make up a very small percentage of games according to  the devs.
---
Shaun
---
Red on you: All survivors see your aura for 4 seconds
---
Oh, bollocks: You provide a distraction. The killer sees your aura for 4 seconds.
---
Don't Stop Me Now: Skill checks become harder. Successful completion is 20% more effective or something. 
---
Ed
---
Cock it: Your presence makes skill checks easier when close to other survivors
---
Pranged it: For every failed skill check, skill checks become easier?
---
Have you got a quid?: Survivors who unhook you, heal you, or revive you find their next 5 or whatever skill checks easier
---
Incidentally, Shaun of the Dead is my favorite movie. I feel like Pegg and Frost would even do like Campbell and come voice them if asked.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I don't mean to sound condescending, but the only way you can improve is to be honest with yourself when you mess up. Blaming the things around you is not how you get better at the game.  
---
Take it from someone who is confident in his ability to dodge hatchets consistently.
---
Thing is I rage for both, I think survivor a bit more
---
Well, we learn something new every day :) Happy to help
---
That‚Äôs fair, I mean I hook and fuck off, If the exit gates are open, they‚Äôre gonna escape anyways, so i‚Äôll try to hook one person at least, but if they get them off hook then gg.
---
About $3.50
---
Lol, I‚Äôm the same
---
If you ever want to hit me up feel free.
---
Ohgodwhydyoudothis
---
But if they increased his movement with saw and made him like a pallet destroyer with no cooldown people would use him to play and not camp
---
Let's face it, it will obviously be a green key or brown medkit
---
Really I also play PS4 and I almost never get toxicity messages whether I'm playing survivor or killer. For context I'm green rank in both so I don't know if that might be why.
---
Which isn't what this post is about.
---
*cries in billy*
---
The point is UNDETECTABLE
---
like Myer I
---
Lmao you lose some or win some. Yall be tripping on these swf losses. (Killer main here)
---
You should go patrol finished gens and check open exit gates.
---
That's DediServers in a nutshell right now. Timed events and pinpoint accuracy is currently unreliable. Think hitboxes by huntress axes, Tombstone by myers, dead hard or other on-activation abilities.
---
I was playing ghost face I was having a great game everyone was second hook 5 gens up after the last two survivors were left I felt bad. I thought about how hard it is at times when I play survivor so I let everyone do gens killer stun me heal I chased and lost them on purpose. And when they got to one gen I randomly picked the first I found and hooked..
---
I get this message after saying I should of left both escape through gates and that I'm an asshole for preventing that.. WTF
---
It‚Äôs good to be skeptical. I hope they aren‚Äôt trying to fuck us over
---
Rest In pieces
---
Wait, did you mean, they shouldn‚Äôt be game changing? 
---
I was talking about bloodpoints offerings haha, if it‚Äôs not for bloodpoints then I don‚Äôt want to waste a offering on something that has no value like a mori that is 3rd hook only.  Might as well remove them 
---
And yes,  it is denying chances to save. But there are a ton of unfair, preventative things in the game.  
---
I just think they need to up the rarity and it‚Äôs fine...   I rarely even see an eboni mori when I play survivor(and I play more than I should).
---
If you think playing ghostface and not stalking is ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù or an example of a mindgame compared to the basic huntress pallet interaction there is no point in trying to discuss anything with you
---
Then pay...? That's not a great argument considering perks are paid exclusives too and then many months down the line become timed exclusives in the shrine. Most players will just main the original cast anyways.
---
Damn we must be in two different red ranks LOL I get the guys who play like green ranks but are somehow red rank
---
I find the opposite to be true personally, like I said, unless the hook is super far away
---
Unless we could shorten the kill animations...

I remember a year ago or so I thought the goal of this game is to escape.
---
Now I play almost every game with We are gonna live forever.
---
Man, a third hook moris would still remove ds, flipflop, flashlight saves, pallet saves, hook sabotaging, body blocking and other every resource a survivor has to prevent a hook. That is the DEFINITION of game breaking
---
Still a far cry from how busted it was before.
---
Weird that you wouldn't expect a reference to a show whose fans won't ever shut up about it.
---
I swear, JoJo fans are the third side of the triangle that was started by Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons.
---
lol can't please everyone
---
Slowing healing is a crutch now?
---
I got one for coop actions for 180 seconds and then I played a demogorgon game and suddenly its a chase survivors for 180 seconds. I'm so done w/ it
---
Its really not a nice perk
---
New Killer: The Pink One So Terrify
---
The reddit doesn't really accurately explain it.
---
Hitting a great skillcheck adds 2% bonus progression ontop of the current progress.
---
Hitting a great skillcheck at 10% repair progression gives you 2% of that 10% as bonus for hitting a great.
---
This works both ways. Missing a skillcheck results in a 10% penalty. Missing a skillcheck at 99% does more damage than missing it at 5%
---
You... Have very little understanding of how computers work, sorry but you are not entitled to a refund because your low end, decade old GPU is no longer supported

And also, i meant they should be game changing but not as much as they are right now.

There‚Äôs a whole lot more brainpower going into the questions of ‚Äúwhat should I do right now?  Is it safe to heal?  Should I run a loop or try and sneak away?  Is he still trying to chase me?‚Äù Than ‚Äúshould I drop this pallet now or in one more second?‚Äù  If basic muscle memory can take care of the job it‚Äôs not a mind game.
---
Stalking is mostly good in low ranks, but at high ranks (especially against SWF) you will get spotted quite often, and then the benefit of stalking (ending a chase quickly) is lost.  Being unpredictable with your power is the best example of messing with your opponent‚Äôs mind.  Of course it seems you think doing anything unconventional or hard to predict and requiring thought to play against and not just staring at the character model is broken, so I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs any helping you at all.
---
I see that this is another shitpost from another killer man who forgot any Rancor, NoED, etc.
---
YESSS
---
That is fair, but honestly, I rarely have issues with these anyway because I don‚Äôt just mindlessly pick someone up
---
For example:  if I know someone was hooked recently I won‚Äôt pick them up and will slug them, meaning they will have at least 1 person coming to save them, while I find another person and chase them, that‚Äôs 3 people not doing gens. And I usually down that other by the time the downed guy gets up. So I get a hook and wasted time.  If I just mori him, the survivors stay on their gens and keep going.  
---
Flashlights are easy to deal with, pallet saves don‚Äôt happen often and I usually scan the area if someone is under a pallet. Sabotaging is annoying, but doesn‚Äôt really matter most of the time (especially if you bait the direction you will go to hook. They destroy the wrong hook) 
---
Bodyblocking is a free hit and I enjoy them.  
---
I do get what you‚Äôre saying though,  killing them can be useful.  But I still don‚Äôt see a point in the long run if it‚Äôs on death anyway... I may as well slug them and have that bait and slow the other 3 down
---
Also a killer main here. And yeah, the win some lose some killer motto is pretty engrained into my skull after 3 thousand hours of suffering. But this SWF is out of the ordinary because, oh I don't know, they actively participated and wanted their rank 19 streaming leader to block me in a corner where i couldn't hit him or anyone else for the entire game?
---
Damn well it happens man, i would say just try and make the best of it and if you get hooked right away just keep going, you never know how the match will turn out
---
The game can‚Äôt handle having different modes
---
I mean, it literally is. As a primarily killer player, who usually gets 3-4k and hovers between ranks 5-3ish lately, I see between 2-4 DS users almost every game. I actually proc it maybe once every dozen games or so?
---
You can see his pubes in the Santa outfit tho.
---
It is. It won‚Äôt count if you block for a healthy survivor. Distraction hits for injured survivors won‚Äôt work either.
---
Ugh clock the username , queen
---
From my understanding, when she is phasing, she can‚Äôt see survivors, but she can see their scratch marks and maybe hear them too. 
---
What has been helping me is that when I hear her phasing (as long as there‚Äôs no prayer beads) instead of panicking and running, I just calmly urban evasion my ass somewhere else and hope she doesn‚Äôt see me when she comes out of phase. 
---
This isn‚Äôt a huge extensive helpful guide, but this alone has helped me a ton.
---
She managed to kill 4 while focusing on one at a time nearly exclusively, while the rest of you potatoes couldn't get 5 gens done? 
---
  
---
Yeah, don't think you need to be commenting on anyone's lack of skill except your own.
---
I blinked and thought this was a perfect loop
---
Whatever the new one is for the plague, too many corners, not good for constant streams
---
Maybe an activation perk? Like hooking or 4 hits.
---
It won't be a metaperk but late game a perk like this would add a lot of pressure when comboed with Pop, thrilling tremors and Overcharge
---
üî™üî™üî™üî™üî™üî™üî™
---
Yes. Find people with mics, and you‚Äôll be fine. Also if you have ps4, we can run it up. Anyways, analyze your mistakes. Get gen rushed constantly? Run pop ruin surveillance and overcharge. Something along those lines. Just realize what‚Äôs causing you to lose, and fix it. Via perk adjustments, play style, whatever the case may be. Just fix your mistakes
---
Lol is that ZillaKami?
---
From what I understand the reason these players don't like it is because they can go after someone else, hook them and go back after the the original person and still get ds'd. 
---
But I think it's fine if you remember and slug.
---
Had a game yesterday where it was two of us left with one gen to go.  I was looping the killer for several minutes, hoping the other guy would pop the gen that was almost done and we could escape.  Did he pop the gen and trigger my adrenaline? No, he waited until I was death-hooked, popped the gen and immediately escaped via the hatch.
---
I hate rank reset.
---
Yeah, if you slug there is unbrekable, and these things happen in organised swf
---
My favorite survivor is Nea because of perks and cosmetics and my favourite killer is the demogorgon because he is both fun to play and to play against
---
You can use it to make safe pallet loops unsafe, and use it to close distance if you know their only option or most likely option is a window vault. Its also an amazing mindgame tool. Fully charging it is usually a bad idea, which is why this ritual is dumb
---
Just run Iron Will /s
---
No but seriously, it does help tho. Listening to the sound of her footsteps is also a way to help going against her. If you have experience as you, you can use that to your advantage too
---
I don‚Äôt know if you know yet but its getting nerfed for stealth killers. Also nerfing this that whatever your mind wishes only hurts other non SWF players. I guess nerfing OoO wouldnt hurt me but nerfing things like Adrenaline or DS, etc.
---
They hated him cause he spoke the truth
---
Oh so you‚Äôre saying if I‚Äôm at 10/80 charges on my gen and I hit a great skill check I only gain .2 charges?
---
I wasnt aware she made a sound while phasing, that actually helps alot, thanks!
---
For me its not the stealth that annoys me its the swf aspect they can bullshit there way through games 
---
I was just triggered from playing 2 games vs it in 5 games but its whatever
---
DS yes I agree its stupid I down a survivor hooked if he is downed I literally have to wait a minute and again on death hook just to be safe
---
Maybe make ir 40 seconds idk
---
Easiest way to do it is to take a hit while the killer is carrying someone. Automatic protection hit.
---
You had to sit down, and think, ''Yeah I wanna do this.''.
---
You, I hope you get camped for this monstrosity that I've layed my eyes on.
---
Wholesome killer! Thank you for your kindness.
---
I stg whenever I decide to play myers I ALWAYS GET CORNFIELD. This has been happening to me for the past 5 games. No map offerings
---
The screen you get in the postgame if your character had a brown alert moment.
---
Coldwind for Myers or hag.
---
They lack strategy imo. I‚Äôve been watching Otz and Truetalent for so long and neither of them are affected by DS as much since they know how to play. I wish more people learnt to get better or learned how to play around instead of always complaining. If they can‚Äôt mind game, they will complain about how looping is toxic
---
Aye games community is okay for one game mode doubt we can handle two game modes
---
I had no clue I could hear her footsteps while she phase walked. That's very helpful, thanks!
---
This community complains about their game more than any other community wow
---
Unrelenting- who a-are you?
---
Cooler Unrelenting- I am speed
---
Your saying rancor
---
How many survivors run DS?
---
EVERY CUNT WHO CAN BUY LAURIE OR FROM.SHRINE
---
How many killers run Rancor
---
RARE
---
Noed I agree needs to be reworked
---
No worries! The sound is like wooshing wind sorta with almost like, a lady sorta whispering is maybe how I would describe it but if you really want, I bet if you looked up on YouTube ‚Äúspirit phase sound‚Äù something would come up. 
---
But anytime I hear that I stop what I‚Äôm doing and crouch elsewhere haha
---
Even more so with the rift I‚Äôll fucking reee if waiting times are like 30mins lol
---
Im likr you but I tilt and say fuck it ds me then pussy
---
It is a perfect loop. Just use a little imagination :D
---
Oh god true hopefully people won‚Äôt go overboard with it like double blood points
---
Kill it. Kill it with fire.
---
Yes according to u/oktolegendz
---
Lol I'm not sure how I've never noticed it. Then again, it took me like 5 hours of gameplay to realize skill checks have a sound cue
---
I honestly just play with having fun in mind now, no matter how many gens I complete on my own, or how much I unhook and heal, or juke the killer to where my teammates just leave me to die. It's a lot more enjoyable now.
---
Aren‚Äôt these the signs of a stroke?
---
Ps4
---
After Huntress Lullaby gets destroyed, tokens are still gained on every hook.
---
Its been over a year.
---
They should make it so only one killer can get out alive
---
tf you talking about? green kits are gonna be godly for self-heals
---
I used to face camp with Billy early on in my killer career and I always got some cheeky hooks from people teabagging behind me. I would act "afk" in a way and then 180 and down someone and it was always funny to me until I started getting the messages from salty survivors. Not fun to do it anymore now.
---
I agree.
---
&gt;  Otz and Truetalent 
---
I've heard both of them complain about DS though.
---
I‚Äôm both killer and survivor, and I‚Äôm completely fine with camping after exits are opened because if they‚Äôve had time to heal and work out a plan, it‚Äôs just dumb to let them unhook. Especially if that‚Äôs where they‚Äôll be going anyway.
---
Smh my head
---
Its not stupid though. It used to be broken before.  People just have to slug and wait. This also gives way for other survivors to waste time thinking of reviving their dallen team mate who is unable to do anything in dying state. I just recommend playing survivor to understand its not easy. It sucks that SWF exist; i play against them too but its just a matter of learning to abuse their altruism against them.

r/blursed
---
Since it only last a week we should be good if we complete all the challenges we will be on level 35 then it‚Äôs 7 games a day to finish.  paulie esther Did some amazing math though it could all change
---
Noed needs no rework, at all
---
She does make a sound while phasing, but beware the husk she leaves  behind will have a terror radius that masks the phasing sound
---
Lmfao you just thought it was a random noise?! That‚Äôs alright when I first started I was hella dumb and downright clueless lol idk how my friends stuck it out until I actually learned shit. They have patience up the ass I guess lol
---
Thanks, that seems like a really good idea
---
It‚Äôs not a week it‚Äôs like 5-7 weeks
---
Huntress - Anything with a lot of walls   
---
Billy - Anything with a lot of walls   
---
Nurse - Anything with a lot of things to cut of LoS  
---
Pig - Open maps  
---
GhostFace - Open maps  
---
Myers - Any maps with a lot of loops  
---
Trapper - Anything that is indoors  
---
Wraith - An map with a lot of loops  
---
LeatherFace - Any map with a lot of loops  
---
the ones I didn't mention is bc they slipped my mind or I think they don't rly have a weakness in maps
---
They do complain when theres more than 2 ppl with DS. But they have learned so well to play against the perk.
---
I know what a weeb is. I just though you were serious though about him being one to the point he needed a cosmetic for it, cause Feng has a cosmetic for Japanese culture, even though she isn't Japanese.
---
yeah
---
Yes, 2% of the current progress percentage gets added when hitting a great skillcheck. Does apply when Hex:Ruin is active
---
You are mistaken, the rift is a month but the event with the special gens are Hooks are a week
---
Wait, how are indoor maps bad with Trapper? He can cut entire areas down in Lery's
---
Oh you mean hallowed blight yeah only 22nd to nov 1st
---
Ah, yes. The Russian Roulette build.
---
Its not a matter of how many run it. My point was that it exists too just as NOED or Bloodwarden. They are just as debilitating as DS to survivors. Both have saved my from countless SWF games
---
Dc is stupid but as both a killer and a serviver player people tend to be toxic as fuck when they bring them in especially with swf. So most people want to keep the pressure so they dont have time to be dicks.
---
Nah I just think it would be hilarious to run around the entity realm with anime merch and Adam is my main.
---
Ya that‚Äôs what I meant when I say event, I‚Äôm not counting the rift as a event lol. But ya we will have to grind a lot for it hopefully the devs make it maybe a little easier
---
It's nice to see the players that play the characters, knows it's not the game that sucks but they... She radiates toxicity at a level rivaling America's Brown Coal power plants!
---
Only complaint I have about DS is when the gates are open, you hook someone and they get off only to get downed and able to crawl out within the time limit. There is literally no counter to it for the killer, you either let them crawl out or eat the DS and they hobble out.
---
I'm not saying it should deactivate once the exit gates are open, but maybe once your through the actual gates the perk can't be activated? Wouldn't be that crazy a change.
---
If a killer hooks some and realizes everyone comes running right into the hook, especially vs an instadown killer, I'd say he's pretty smart.  If he does it and 3 Survivors pop all the gens and leave, then he's kinda a trash camper.
---
Gotta love the hypocrisy here. Gets destroyed by this same team a bunch of times prior to this and cries about how he's not having fun and "why would they run this" and "some people just don't want others to have fun" etc etc. 
---
Beats them one single game by hard-countering with an S tier killer (yes, Freddy is absolutely S tier), uploads a 40 minute youtube analysis of it.
---
Build isn't even cool or original, either. PGTW, Ruin, Discordance. Yawn. Everybody runs that shit at red ranks, dude.
---
Pretty pathetic and childish gesture from you, Otz. I think the worst part is that these guys do not play toxic at all compared to some of the teams that I've ran into at rank 1 who play to completely ruin your day. I'm pretty sure this group in particular is just trying to practice for some upcoming tournament or something and it's quite clear to me that they are running object to counter Spirits specifically, as you basically need it against an extremely skilled Spirit player, especially in a competitive format.
---
In my opinion, uploading a 36 min analysis of your ONE victory is significantly more toxic than anything those guys did you to in any of those games where they had four people escape. And yes, I watched most of them. You so badly want plebs on youtube to think that you are the superior player. Why does it matter so much to you?
---
&gt;all their focus
---
OK, so you still don't get it. Stop saying "no shit" about something you clearly refuse to understand.
---
Nah your wrong 
---
If its ran alot it means there is an issue here
---
Like in any game, something that is played by everyone is played like.that for a reason because its OP
---
So tweak the numbers so some people may choose to.run other perks
---
Make the game more.diverse not everyone run ds dead hard and whatever survivors run
---
So Dbd juking montage when? :^)
---
So would they just make a anime parody? For which anime would you see in the Dbd universe?
---
That emote for missing a skill check encourages toxicity. We don‚Äôt need more of that.
---
Yeah, but I think he means his traps are easy to spot.
---
Wait did the killer screenshot themself facecamping you and then insult you?
---
Not gonna lie that would be amazing to see like a knock off of real anime but I was thinking just any OC creation.
---
Glad I'm not the only one experiencing this glitch. I have had "complete 3 full gens" twice. I go in game, get a few gens done. And now my DR is completely different.
---
again, you're clearly going off the premise that something is inherently wrong with noed like running it is somehow a bad thing and assuming you do is somehow insulting
---
like wtf? it's just a perk dude
---
I can only say, take a break when you need to. I also love this game a lot, but get drained out so I take a break and play something else for a while and then come back.
---
Oh we do. Especially after I did over 27 attempts for Evil Incarnate and still don't have it.
---
[This is how it usually plays out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9hkeHDbKZs) Complete fucking bullshit.
---
Ah I see ur a man of culture as well
---
out of all the Autohaven maps, Gas Heaven is my least favorite.  And maybe it's because I use Balance Landing, but I love the Laboratory map.
---
True dat, true dat.
---
I‚Äôm of the camp who believes it could hurt the game.  If standard ques are already long, how long will they be if half the community is trying the new mode?
---
New game modes new community‚Äôs expand the game
---
It‚Äôs smart to secure at least some points but it‚Äôs annoying when u are survivor that did well the whole game and u get face camped at end
---
The best survivor squads swap out these duties, like once you've got someone hooked twice, you never see them again, and their buddies loop you.
---
Ah yes, the feeling of tilt.
---
I just laugh it off. But that might not help for you.
---
I have 3.3k hours on DBD PC and whenever I tilt I just laugh it off, take a breather, drink some water and head out to the next game. 
---
Dead by daylight doesn't tilt me as much as other games, I used to play CSGO and PUBG before Dbd and reached global elite rank on CS after 2800 hours. But this is what helps me against tilt.
---
My worst rage moment in DBD was me slamming my fist on a table on stream.
---
You should use /s or tYpE lIkE ThIs when you are being sarcastic
---
Duuuddeee give him a afro with naruto headband, dragon ball shirt, one piece jacket, and some type of cool over the top pants and boom weeb.
---
This is really, really accurate üò¢
---
She wears like 7 pairs of false lashes. They‚Äôre behind those
---
Spend a few nights being Joe.  Charge the killer early on and practice your looping.  If you die, move on to the next match.  No loss.
---
300 hours isnt much in this game, especially if you play both sides.  Once you put time into looping and really figure it out you‚Äôll be in that 1%.
---
Downvoted for not slugging.
---
/s
---
The fastest way to rank up as survivor is to play with friends. Generally just focus on objective/getting points
---
As killer, you gotta play the strongest meta killers (PC) Nurse, hillbilly, spirit and huntress(&lt;--requires practise, high skillgap), strong perks like Hex:Ruin, BBQ, enduring+spiritfury or sloppy butcher and thanataphobia.
---
As killer you gotta practise a bit to get higher ranks, mindgaming, predicting and reacting, building pressure.
---
The issue isnt the perk itself though. Its that SWF is able to heavily abuse it.
---
You can't hear the sound of you are in terror radius
---
Don‚Äôt use a fake God to spread your hateful beliefs.
---
They have it if you DC in a continuous amount of times you get banned actually. Also with the new ranking + dedicated servers they're going to fix the DC problem, by actually punishing them
---
XD
---
Remove keys and remove trophy for it
---
.-. It's just a boring no skill perk. Any killer who doesn't run it is insulted by the accusation because it's a BORING NO SKILL perk. It grants you the ability to play like liquid ass in a burning can and still get a 4k. Some people actually take pride in their ability to bring down tough teams without relying on cheeky exposed effects. Especially ones that allow you to again coast through a game like a raging dumpster fire and still clean up.
---
I have nothing against noed or the people that use it but I don't respect either. And new players see people like mr "noed should be meta" and form an over dependence on the perk, refusing to learn other aspects of the game such as mind gaming and tracking, allowing a full dependence on doing nothing but holding W. Who needs to learn how to actually play when you can just get 2 or 3 of them at the end with no education at all!
---
It‚Äôs not your fault you wouldn‚Äôt be their meme.
---
Marry me
---
The most annoying thing was to get DSd by a 4 man SWF team who ran all meta perks and a really good flashlight then they say GG EZ in post game chat when they all ended up escaping beacuse of those perks.
---
He's a BBQ and Chili bot and nothing more.
---
Billy can't turn around corners and down 3 people lol It should go unchanged in his current state, I'm going to change it in my suggestion with the movement speed buff though
---
Turning off chat definitely helps, I adjusted all my settings on ps4 so I dont get messages or can receive friend requests from them. It also sucks though to miss out on possibly funny messages, but just not dealing with toxic killers and survivors makes the game much better!
---
Gens will be there.  You need to get altruism with saves and earn boldness by being in chase.
---
I'm flattered, but I don't even know you.
---
 Wait for all this to blow over: At the star of the match start in a locker that is undetectable by the killer. Remain undetectable until you leave the locker/ exit gates are open/ or you are the last survivor left.
---
I remember a couple months ago when people would just karma whore their videos on here, let‚Äôs not do that again :)
---
I say he‚Äôs def worth it. Especially in terms of getting his perk BBQ and Chili if you haven‚Äôt gotten it when it got released on Shrine of Secrets way back when.
---
No it doesn't, the top floor is the best part of the whole map, guaranteed gen(1) ,guaranteed totem(1or even 2), guaranteed chest(1), guaranteed pallet but it doesn't count since it's fking useless but , guaranteed balanced landing hole. Why is everyone complaining ??
---
Not against a prayer beads spirit lol
---
Idk about perks, but they should totally receive skins for Hot Fuzz and World's End (I'd play the shit outta Gary fucking King)
---
And maybe Paul? Maybe?
---
News Flash: a bloody party streamer benefits killers too.
---
Whoever sis this deserves a metal.
---
Semi are not as toxic as full toxic  players but still toxic while 50/50 there's 50% chance they good or 50% they're toxic
---
Its always the killers that can already insta down people who run noed
---
A man can dream dammit
---
I'm a rank 1 killer and survivor. I play both equally. If you had this thing called "reading comprehension", you would already know that.
---
Hes not top tier but hes decent.  His perk bbq and chili is what's completely worth it tho
---
Once again wrong lol. When billy starts the sprint, he can turn over 270 degrees. And while he can multi down, when other than the basement does bubba do that? (Watch ayrun play billy, he does INSANE curves)
---
lol
---
Thats some fucking reaching my dude.
---
Get the fuck out of this community if you feel that way. There's a lot of people on the LGTBQ+ spectrum to play this game.
---
have me as the killer and you will get out in no time
---
its ok survivorman doesnt exist they cant hurt you
---
I suppose you are still on the low ranks, so yes, leatherface still works there and can be pretty fun, besides that, he has BBQ that is one of the most used perks.
---
Bruh I've been playing the game since the day it released, you do realize that killers get just as much bp for playing the game as farming? So what, an extra 5k vs killing the little fucks who expect to get what they want cause "I ran bps".
---
It just isn't fun to play on either side. It looks awesome, and you can tell they worked hard on it, it's just not fun to play.
---
This is clever as hell
---
Prayer Beads Spirit is insane but not even she can effectively guard 4 Out of 5 hex totems on a map. If its a big map one hex is gonna get popped in the first minute.
---
I mean since STBFL is for hit attacks and unrelenting is for missed attacks, it wouldn't even stack
---
Shhh... It's okay buddy, you don't have to keyboard warrior your way though another wall of text that no one will read! The point of the analysis isn't how many time he got beat it's teach other players what to and not to do... You can't do a teaching video when you get your ass handed to you and he's actually a good player!
---
Btw, Rank means shit in this game, and you know it! But keep bragging about it! "Fake it 'till you make it!" I always say!
---
Where the heck did u find those?
---
a category 5 bruh moment has entered the realm, i repeat, a category 5 bruh moment has entered the realm
---
By where I meant how, what kind of MCD puts that
---
nobody cares about tier lists please shut up
---
Unless you play ghost face. Then Hawkins is great
---
I have no regrets of what I did with Decisive Strike and No Mither.
---
*iridescent blade:causes infinite mending*
---
yeah that's the archives which is different from the rift. You can earn exp for the rift by completing tomes from the archives tho which is cool
---
Corners* Meaning multiple corners, billy can't make consecutive turns due to his movement speed, If someone goes into a jungle gym 9/10 billy will need to chase him/her out via melee whereas the chainsaw clears everyone out, You're jumping the gun a bit there lol
---
We‚Äôre gonna live forever.  100% bonus bloodpoints with 4 ‚Äústacks‚Äù IE saves.
---
This is really disturbing
---
Two years of Object of Obsession being in the game and the devs still have not found it ridiculous that a perk which gives a survivor and his team 100% info on the killer's whereabouts and actions at all times is completely ok. 
---
A perk where you get 100% aura just by existing - don't have to throw down a pallet/heal/touch a gen/go inside a building - you can literally just stand in the corner of the map and tell everyone exactly what the killer is doing at all times - this perk that was conceived by someone in BHVR by some low skilled survivor main dev, is completely OK.
---
It's ok for all survivors, but Freddy couldn't keep his aura reading for survivors in dream world  because that was "unfair to play against". But survivors being able to view a killer at all times in all games dream world or not is acceptable - that's apparently fun to play against.
---
This is why you're a joke, devs. No aura reading in this game should be infinite. 
---
And your response after two years is to give stealth killers aura reading immunity - not to change OoO for the better. Ten other killers will have to continuously suffer from a low-skilled perk because you are so gutless and clueless that you feel that a constant aura reading perk is perfectly fine.
---
And on a side note, I'm glad that Otz said the truth about the "new and improved" DS. I said it when it was first leaked - they "reworked" it to be hook immunity then lied about it being anti-tunnel. They removed it's counters (Dribbling), lied that Enduring would now be it's counter, then removed Enduring from being a counter to it. The perk has no counter. They "reworked" the perk to just force killers to leave a previously hooked survivor alone for a minute.
---
I remember telling Tru3 in his stream when the perk was first reworked not to trust what the devs say, trust their actions. I told that the perk is just going to punish killers for being too good, and protect survivors who get caught too fast. And he said "I feel like DS can't be complained about now, just don't tunnel."
---
I remember being dumbfounded at how stupid his response was to what I said. I told him he would regret falling for the devs' lies and not seeing what they were truly up to. Flash forward to the present, and he constantly complains that DS isn't really anti-tunnel because you can hook someone else and come back to the previously hooked survivors and STILL get DS'd. Too late Tru3, the moronic devs were watching you and saw that you fell for the banana in the tail pipe trick and are now emboldened.
---
You should always, always, ALWAYS pay attention the details of the devs' actions and not merely trust their words. DS is hook immunity to punish the killer for daring to kill lower skilled survivors too fast. That is ALL that it is. The time to call it out was when it was first leaked. The devs aren't going to change shit about it now.
---
No, but BBQ is...
---
**FRESH BLADE**

-Greatly decreases feral frenzy duration

-Increases penalty for missed hits (longer stun, will increase ability recharge time)
---
All the claudettes just waiting in a corner to escape üòÇ
---
Yes.  He has the best perk in the game and is strong outside of red ranks.
---
I love this bug so much I hope they never patch it
---
1. There are no pro players. No one is paid to play dead by daylight.
---
traditionally a Hex Spirit would have Ruin, Thrill, Devour, and Haunted along with prayer beads and mother daughter ring. Meaning 5 Hex totems, all with the debuff cleansing speed of Thrill and 2 of them being trapped with Haunted.
---
Eventually survivors might start cleansing totems, but the odds are still stacked in her favor if she's playing  well and grabbing/downing them quickly. Not to mention if survivors are trying to coordinate cleansing these totems, chances are they are doing gens super slowly if at all.
---
And if all else fails, you're still Spirit with 2 of her strongest add-ons even if you're perkless at that point it should still be an easy 4k.
---
Than pulling a teeth
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Otz made it very clear that these guys we're not being toxic at any point (Nor was he, but I guess you see that a bit differently), but if they are truly practising for a competetive tournament they should do it in a private lobby because its not fun at all for a random Killer to go against a full on optimised SWF team.
---
They can play as optimally as they want because they are probably practising for a tournament, but as soon as Otz chooses an optimal build with a good Killer suddenly he's the bad guy and displays "pathetic and childish behaviour"? 
---
Whats the logic here?
---
&gt;Build isn't even cool or original, either. PGTW, Ruin, Discordance. Yawn. Everybody runs that shit at red ranks, dude.
---
Because the survivors builds where fun and unique? No they we're optimal, and so was his. The build wasn't made to be fun or original, it was made to be optimal.
---
&gt;You so badly want these plebs on youtube/reddit to think that you are the superior player. Why does it matter so much to you?
---
Because in the Video Otz was always talking about how good he is and how superior he is to these survirors? 
---
No. He Said multiple times that these are ridicilously good survivors, and that anyone including him would have a very hard time playing against.
---
&gt;Karma means absolutely nothing to somebody like me.
---
Alright then. I have the thing called reading comprehension and I can see that you're more interested in starting beef with people about this than to actually make a point clear.
---
that's just mean &gt;:c
---
I looked at the scores on the last tab and it had 19066 by my username

You should've gone for the HEAD!

**hits Dwight with instadown hatchet then the entire lobby DCs**

Just you wait for his Ace in the Hole
---
I cannot inore Imgflip.com water mark sorry but good meme anyway
---
&gt;"Hitboxes in this game are fucked, melee or ranged you will see hits that definitely shouldn't connect."  
---
The hitbox argument is a red herring and should not be as popular as it is. Some people people started blaming hitboxes, despite not really knowing if it actually was, and now suddenly everyone believes it to be true.  
---
The true issue with wonky hits in *most* situations is latency, not hitboxes, and this has been confirmed by the developers, whom I would argue know a lot more about the situation than a handful of people whose knowledge about it is limited, and whom I can guarantee know a lot more about the situation than thousands of people with practically zero actual knowledge about it.  
---
To say otherwise is to spread misinformation, and that really doesn't get us anywhere.  
---
&gt;"When you chalk it up to "I guess I'm just more confident in my juking abilities" you sound condescending as hell, no matter if you intend to or not."  
---
Which is exactly why I started the comment with that disclaimer.
---
Omg that was amazing üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Was just trying to explain that it's not overpowered lol
---
Jesus. You have anger issues.
---
I feel bad when 2 people dc and the third guy dies on first hook
---
Why is this removed, it was good
---
Agreed, I loved pig before egc, but then they took away the one reason I played her, survivors couldn't leave with the trap on
---
I totally agree. Spirit with her strongest addons alone is ridicilously good. But of all Spirit builds a 4 hex build would still be the one with the most counterplay to it.
---
Sandbag the fuck out of my friends and pretend that I‚Äôm a random and see how long it takes them to figure it out
---
Oh! Im rank 15 - on CONSOLE, I've played since Last December on PC, and Im pretty seasoned haha - so I have some experience with Her. Thank You so much for Your suggestions though, I'll see if I can re-kindle My love for Huntress, or just play some more Survivor!
---
You don‚Äôt have to be paid to be a pro at something lol
---
That‚Äôs what she goes for - Trixie exaggerates everything ‚Äúnormal‚Äù drag queens do, and it ends up very doll-like. She‚Äôs not going for realistic or natural makeup.
---
*he
---
I agree, that would feel awful. Never had that happen, but I‚Äôm sure it sucks SO bad.
---
Hawkin's is weird.  If you have Balanced Landing you're pretty much good, there's not a whole lot the killer can do.  If you don't have Balanced Landing, you're not exactly in a great spot.
---
I will say though, as a Killer I love it because Doctor's Zaps can actually help in a chase there.
---
You mean OhPedo
---
Yea I was thinking the same thing, but couldn't you then say that anyone who is profiting off of streaming this game on Twitch is a pro?
---
I like the artwork of the shiney blade.
---
That‚Äôs a really cool concept but the last one is a bit like kindred
---
having the "most" counterplay to it, isn't saying much when you consider how little counterplay all her tactics usually have.
---
When you consider all the hurdles they have to go through. You have to commit to the totem to break it, and it takes 20 seconds at least for the first 1, there is a 2/5 chance you are exposing yourselves if you break one. If you ignore the totems, you will have to work through ruin and try to win before she starts snow balling from Devour. This is still one of the strongest killers with strong add-ons running around with notifications of where you guys are all the time.
---
There's going to be a negative impact no matter how the survivors collectively choose to tackle this Spirit build. Still a really strong thing to run with her.
---
Im actually maining huntress and trapper rn lol
---
I‚Äôve also had games where I have gotten 4 stacks and I don‚Äôt get the bonus. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just a problem on console or what, but it‚Äôs very annoying.
---
He was attempting to provide context to his criticism of Spirit by providing that info because you know the first comment that would have come if he didn't man be honest....
---
"Found the Survivor Main"
---
Anytime someone has an opinion about a killer mechanic or the other side
---
"Found the Killer Main"
---
That's typically the silly shit that immediately follows it.    This is why he said it.
---
Agreed. It's so annoying -.-
---
I need some shock therapy now
---
 Yeah, I believe his toxicity caused all this. His toxicity has spread across many other games and platforms. He started it all.
---
Then your not camping, your following the survivors, if they are stupid enough to make themself visible and remain in the proximity you aren't there to camp the hooked guy you are there to pick easy targets, like patrolling a totem. In every other situation I think camping is despicable tho.
---
Realistically it us the only way to limit your losses at the end of the game. The survivors may get mad but they would probably do the same thing.
---
What‚Äôs her kill rate in red/purple?  How about green and yellow?
---
This is why 80% of the time I play LF, I tunnel and catch a survivor who i know is in the game with his friends and facecamp them the whole match with my chainsaw revved so i can watch them d/c. My erection continues when their friend attempts a rescue and I slice them down and let them crawl away if they want, as long as I get to stare into the dying eyes of my first hook til they d/c, i fap it right thrn and there and squirt in their corpse multiple times throughout the process üòÅ
---
After the gens are powered I see camping as the only logical strategy
---
If you camp after gens are finished then idc since it makes it easy for everyone else to get out.
---
Pretty sure op means big time players like noob3 and  monto
---
ü§°
---
Funnily, I played a Nurse game a while back, made more than 30000 bloodpoints but didn't get a single sacrifice/kill and got brutal killer in the end.
---
if you saw how it used to be when they did stack, you would be scared.
---
That's when his open hand comes into play
---
Perfect!
---
Toxic
---
Treatment theatre for nurse. In theory this should be good, but there are SO many obstacles that fuck up your blink that it's not even funny. Like.. You learn to work around it, but it's annoying af
---
Yep might be the same thing then, it‚Äôs happened to me a handful of times where I was the last one to escape and I didn‚Äôt get my stacks. I‚Äôve gotten them if I left before the last Survivor.
---
They‚Äôre bad.  I just played survivor after taking a break.  My matches were all campers.  Because they are campers they will remain in yellow.
---
Just use Rancor, follow the obsession around for 5 gens, instadown and mori. EZ CLAP. üëè
---
When they were healing  him it looked like they were rubbing his feet
---
You guys are overthinking how powerful this build would actually be. If  HG gets cleansed first and you start to snowball stacks for devour then sure, it could be nasty, but any decent group will destroy the totmes in a heartbeat while the spirit gets one or two hooks.
---
It is also massively map dependant. Red forest, coldwinds, it would be a meme build at its finest.
---
You just mad that jojo is good?
---
God Scoops for the win
---
Camping in general is bad, m'kay, but I suppose that is technically the least toxic time to do it on your end. Obviously the survivor is gonna say otherwise though, since they're pretty much seconds from winning/escaping but are being denied it by a cheap, hard to counter play tactic (depending on what killer you're playing as, especially), so do keep that in mind.
---
Ill disect your answer
---
Self care is shit only noobs use it or solo because it takes too long 
---
Borrowed time situational in its for others not yourself
---
Balanced landing some maps have no drops so its risky
---
Decisive whats the downfall? 1min after each hook killer cant touch you??
---
I've had it happen to me and I'm on PC. I just thought I mis read or something.
---
What have you created?! You imbecile you doomed us all!
---
Cute :3

I like this
---
RIP
---
Whenever I tried a mori daily I used to get DCs during the loading screen so now I just take Rancor along with PWYF, Brutal Strength and Noed. Although it‚Äôs a bit mean I just follow the Obsession around until the last gen gets done.
---
You think they would ever do a killer that is like a Zombie horde? You would have control of only one of the zombies at a time but could switch between them like a hive mind? 
---
The AI ones would aimlessly wonder the map and alert the hive mind kinda like crows and you could then switch to that zombie kinda like the hag?
---
Maybe survivors would have a possible way to thin the zombies by sneaking up behind them and performing a kill action by hitting them in the head or something with 1 hit use melee items found on the map?
---
It would slow genny rush and would be risk /reward
---
Reward:kills a zombie
---
Risk:mess up the skill check and alert the hive mind 
---
Idk just a thought in the vein of Shaun of the Dead and zombies as a potential killer style?
---
With all due respect they shouldn't remove a daily just because you personally are struggling in your killer games.
---
That daily is worth 60K BP and is viewed as one of the easiest ones in the game to accomplish.  I hate using moris because they're cheesy and make games too easy but I love that daily because it's worth twice what the others are.
---
Just practice playing killer man.  You'll improve.  Watch some YouTube vids there's a ton of great resources out there.  Matchmaking can be rough sometimes though it's improving.  You just had a bad game.  The devs should not be balancing the game around you personally.
---
just sounds like survivors don't like going against something strong to me...
---
Lmfao this was great man, good props!
---
I sincerely hope so, but the Friday game is pretty successful...
---
Now for sale, sorry!
---
"I don't like to feel good. I like to feel evil!"

This build seems lovely heheh with cannibal oof
---
Man I like JoJo, but it's getting to be too much. People can't shut up about it.

He was definitely a heavy influence.  He created a Legion of entitled BM survivor assclowns that think what they do is cool and fun.

[recent video from OhTofu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV-0pZVfXHI)
---
watch the 30 second mark for the stbfl and unrelenting stacking. There's also tons more stuff in the video showing literally how unplayable/unbalanced this game used to be.
---
You‚Äôre not the father
---
When you are late to lunch at school
---
Literally no, I disagree. Survivors have no equivalent daily that they literally CANNOT complete without a special item or extremely specific perks. Getting a mori daily on a killer I have almost no good perks on, only 3 total moris (2 of which are yellows) and no insta-down mechanics, is completely ridiculous. Not to mention getting matched against players who are 10+ ranks above me who can just run circles around me because i'm being forced to play a killer i am NOT used to playing just to complete a daily? That's horse shit
---
That has nothing to do with the daily, it‚Äôs about you and the matchmaking tho, I love getting those dailies since is 60k for 5-7k or even less if I have devour/rancor on that killer.
---
A lot of his old antics have either been nerfed by the Devs themselves or just not really used anymore because everyone knows about them and how to counter them now (example: sitting next to killer at pallet to prevent them from breaking it), and unless I'm REALLY out of the loop he hasn't even really attempted to play in quite a while. That said, yes, a lot of the BMing and oddball strategies that Are still in the game today are ripples of what he and his fans did, which newer players pick up on by being exposed to them and not really thinking about the whys. That said, I don't think this would magically disappear by someone going back in time and preventing his birth, gaming has always had toxic players and other people would definitely have figured all this toxic plays out some other way.
---
it is powerful, it isn't her strongest build for sure. But it turns the secondary objective into a necessity, otherwise you will lose and creates decent game slowdown in it's own right and like I mentioned if you pair it with certain add-ons, Spirit will be a strong killer to face regardless of what exactly happens to the totems.
---
Have you ever faced/used/seen this build in action? It is pretty fun to play and is a different twist from the monotony of a standard match.
---
Thank you, I will  &lt;3
---
That's pretty regular for me whenever I have to do it, no matter the killer
---
I was doing ghost face, but some p3 Claudette up and urban Evanston away with it. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT DONE.
---
I always see it as the same way, good to see someone agrees
---
Whenever the survivors feel like playing normally (when I‚Äôm killer), I play the game as usual and try to get kills while still giving them a fun, non campy or tunnely time. If they try to be friendly, I just.... can‚Äôt kill them. Sure, I‚Äôll chase them, hit them, down them, etc, but they can leave. Darn cuties.
---
Gotta love those survivors who hate you for doing it and the killers who hate you after they fail doing it
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the lumberjack cosmetic!
---
Haven't seen a toxic Jake in ages, or any other kind of Jakes for that matter. Most toxic guy IMO is probably Dwight
---
Would Demo be a bad killer to do that with?
---
Oh my gosh I loved Trixie already but now I love her even more. So hilarious when she's salty! Hahahaha
---
This post is kinda a joke yes. Maybe Nurse has 2 blinks but if you blink on a max distance with the first one the second one goes to like 2-3 meters and then you take a breather. So it's basically 1 Blink and sometimes it doesn't go through structures (maybe It's my fault but whatever). And without the ability to cancel blink you can overblink you target completely and watch them default dance away from you cuz you just got bamboozeled XD. And you can't change my opinion about Billy and Nurse. TLDR they suck and I will never play them.
---
To be fair, "semi" just means "somewhat," not necessarily 50%
---
Trixie is a obviously a man, but it‚Äôs normal to refer to drag queens with female pronouns while in drag and male pronouns out of drag!
---
&gt; Each tome‚Äôs rewards will go away but they said they can come back in the store after an extended time period.
---
That was the rift. I'm talking about the rewards to complete a stage of quests -&gt; Tome
---
I can just imagine 5 year old Claudette running around with a flashlight saying "You can't killll me!"
---
Thank you &lt;3 nea is my main ( including far too much money to own every cosmetic :-:) so I had to do her good üòÇ
---
Yes.  They also don't have the ability to clear 60K BP's with a single daily either killers do.  They hook it up with a generous amount of bp's because it requires a perk or item (Moris, Devour Hope or Rancor).
---
Again you specify YOU don't have many perks on your killer YOU don't have many moris yet.  But a lot of US do.  A lot of US like the daily because it's easy to do and we have a lot of them stashed away on various killer characters.  Once you put enough bloodpoints into leveling up killers you start finding them on nearly every bloodweb.
---
Again I acknowledged that matchmaking was rough for you that game.  It's rough but it happens sometimes man.  That's not the norm.  You also aren't "forced" to do anything the devs allow us to trade out dailies for other ones.
---
Again the devs should not be balancing the game around one player that clearly doesn't have much experience with killer.  The vast majority of us enjoy getting 60K bps for one if the easiest dailies in the game.
---
At the same time though, you're kinda missing the chance to save someone else
---
His perk is great, but the only reason I've bought Freddie and Michael is because I love the movies and it's a lot of fun to play as them. If you're the kind of player who thinks a good perk is worth the money, or if you have a lot of fun playing killers you like from the movies then go ahead!
---
What else are you gonna do? Seriously you have no gens to pressure they are just waiting at doors to A scape B save, if they save u might trade one hook for another if they don‚Äôt you get a late sacrifice which is nice too. Just remember the 16(?) meters rule.
---
Why not the dancing clown
---
The second blink only goes for about 2-3 meters if you go for a max distance 1st blink. Call it bad fps or severe case of crab hands git gud syndrome. So it's basically one blink.
---
Jesus dude, haha.
---
I‚Äôve been running this with flip flop instead of MoM. It works like 1/10 times at most but so help me when it works it‚Äôs freaking awesome! Just had one yesterday against a doctor!
---
Cote fucking vaporized him
---
How can people say this game is balanced when builds like these exist
---
The same happened to me and Sony deleted the messages
---
Literally just saw tru3 get rekt while playing as spirit today on stream... if you think she's uncounterable then there's no changing your mind lol
---
It's even worse when it's a SWF because then you have a flock of flies trading hooks and all of them getting mad at the end
---
What about the ones that let you live after bs hits?
---
Maybe have it also affect actions speeds and not just luck.
---
Because as I said, the DCing survivor literally takes a double depip and loses the BPs of the game. They're already punished enough.
---
Yes you should absolutely shrug it off because it was one bad game.  They're going to happen sometimes.  You queue into another one and shake it off.  If it only takes one bad game to tilt you this hard than I'm afraid playing killer in this one might not be the best one for you.
---
Again I said it in my last comment so please read it this time.  You are not forced to spend anything or do any daily in this game.  The devs allow you to trade out one daily everyday that you don't want to do and it will replace it with another at random.  If they give you a mori daily again just trade it out.
---
Again I'm willing to bet if you polled the killer community the vast majority of them would vote to keep the mori daily because 60bp's is awesome and unmatched on survivor side.
---
The devs should not make sweeping changes to the game to appease one inexperienced player.  If they did NOED and insta heals would be base kit.
---
Now THAT is just not true. She is counterable. Her counter is just stupid as hell. Moving slowly to counter the fastest killer in the game is so dumb
---
I was completely stuck. It doesn't seem like many people know it but you can lock the killer in place where the totem/pallet would spawn of you hide just behind the boxes. Since you can't move, you can't reach around and give 'em a love tap
---
Eh, nah. I don‚Äôt want some laggy Asians or Euros joining my match.
---
If it works ig
---
Well those on the other hand...
---
‚ÄúMeh‚Äù
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far!
---
If you REALLY want a kill, you will get it, potentially at the cost of 3 people getting away. He could be the best "looper" there is, but none of that will beat the fact that you run faster than they do. 
---
Don't try to be fancy. Instead, turn yourself into a brainless kill-bot that only follows them in their tracks. If they drop a pallet, break it. Don't get cute and try countering their looping. Just keep on beelining straight for them. Eventually, they'll run out of pallets and you'll catch up.
---
Oh my god.
---
Honestly depends on what killer your playing and what perks your using. If your just a M1 killer, then camping would be fine. If you got perks like BW or NOED, then you should go for other survivors.
---
good news is with the dedicated servers they will not be able to dashboard and make you lose everything
---
Xbox doesn't face that type of DC as much, but it still sucks when they figure out how to do it. It's like getting DdoSd on R6 in Plat matches, and it really fuckin sucks mate
---
This reminds me of cartoon networks Welcome to My Life short. In it a monster goes to school and says in passing that another kid looked like him. That kid didn‚Äôt like that so he wanted to fight him. The situation was diffused when a friend asked the kid what was wrong was being like him.
---
Would you rather her be yet another m1 killer?
---
Yeah, I tend to agree, especially when it comes to a killer with a tracking/traversal power. Now since i'm a dumbass, what perk abbreviation is BW?
---
Yeah if my teams trash I play to pip up and get bp's too survival is often off the table lol.
---
I don't usually kill myself early though because I'd feel bad.  There is one exception to this though.
---
If we are playing Plague and I see 4 cleanses in the first minute I'm outtie.  Plague get me out of this shitshow please and enjoy being a machine gun all game.  I've seen noobs cleanse without even being broken lol.
---
.-. And this is why you get the blue arrows.
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt care what she becomes, I just want her to stop being so busted.
---
I had a daily ritual change 3 times one me, one right after i completed what it was supposed to be in a match
---
Blood Warden, it's one of Freddy's teachables where if a survivor is hooked in the EGC, no one can leave for a set amount of time. If your having issues with survivors being toxic BW does miracles.
---
Because Jason is the cooler Trapper.
---
Yeah I've heard that from multiple sources that the PS4 DBD Community is supposedly noticeably more toxic than the other platforms.  Lots of DC's and lots of hard BM.
---
Oh that is good news, thanks for sharing man.  I got something to look forward to.
---
It's interesting to know that somebody that's so different from what you would expect from the average DBD player actually plays this game.
---
True actually
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what it‚Äôs intended for. Any site with such a basic ‚Äògood/bad‚Äô voting system will be used just like that; it‚Äôs a design issue, no matter what the creators intended.
---
I love jason but I don't wanna another licensed killer I want somthing original
---
So trixie is like, an uber drag queen
---
Here is my friends Tumblr 
---
 [https://glenny-boy.tumblr.com/](https://glenny-boy.tumblr.com/)
---
Who?
---
I use up all of my moris as soon as I get them, cuz I just love fatalities. Yesterday, I killed a voice-chatting team, which was super satisfying. One guy was sitting on the hatch, while the other one suicided to let him escape. By chance, I ran into the guy sitting on the hatch, knocked him down, and did a fatality literally a foot away from the open hatch. Hit character was close enough to touch the hatch. His character was looking straight at the hatch as leatherface ran his chainsaw through his body. So satisfying. And the whole team was soooo damn salty haha.
---
Yeah that's always the problem with these kinds of posts.  Without clearer language or vids of gameplay there's no telling what happened in their games either way.
---
The only viable killers against the cream of the crop are nurse and spirit. Nurse is already getting nerfed. (rightfully so) But if they nerf both, then the other killers need to be buffed. You cool with that?
---
This looks like it's of a playing card
---
You're never safe when the killer is ghostface... unless you're in an open map with swfs and OoO
---
1. Pig crouches at the speed of Ghostface.
---
2. Pig's ambush roar happens at the moment of the swing, not at the start of the ambush.
---
3. Rule set 2 is default.
---
4. RBT'd survivors suffer from Oblivious if it's timer hasn't started - gives them incentive to not just play around and do a gen before someone else gets hooked.
---
5. Pig can retrieve discarded RBTs and reuse them.
---
6. Survivors can not escape through the exits if RBT'd just like it use to be. INSTEAD.. to compensate for the EGC timer, if you are RBT'd after the gens are done the box with your RBT key will be highlighted to you just as the your personal clock is highlighted to you when asleep in the dream world. The box highlighted to you will always be the one the furthest away from your location just like the clocks.
---
7. And of course a bunch of her addons need to be improved, too many to list off the top of my head.
---
I've just fixed the Pig for you, BHVR. She's now high tier, her ambush is actually GOOD and she can mindgame with it, her traps don't solely rely on easy RNG and can be re-used, and her end game isn't shit anymore - she keeps her power like every other damn killer.
---
You didn't have to butcher her, you could have went about it smartly. But you're so short sighted that you didn't give a damn about what your decisions did to her.
---
Go to Tru3 for those
---
Thank you:3 ^^
---
Use ds I always run it when solo
---
Gang bang kate Denson
---
Ace is shit
---
Featherface?
---
Easily my favorite thing to do in the match, it guarantees you either a kill or major gen pressure and usually gives both.  I've been getting the shit talk for making them 3 gen themselves and it's a beautiful thing.
---
Couldn't have said it better. I'm done with stressing out in matches as survivor or killer. I just play to have fun now even if the match goes horrible. So much better.
---
Sounds like your playing solo, solution to this is play SWF, find players that have at least 400 hours and play together.
---
Then it's gg
---
Feather: *exists*
---
Cat: REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
i have no idea why i got downvoted, that thing is objectively hideous lol
---
I do but I always get farmed right under a hook. So someone is in a chase and takes me off when they get some distance from killer and killer immediately hits me back down and throws me on the hook. My DS doesn‚Äôt activate quick enough.
---
How about the fact that matchmaking has been fucked
---
Nah, the 119. Got the rather smaller one
---
YES
---
This is also a huge issue. I‚Äôm a rank 7 right now and I‚Äôm getting matched with 18, 13, and 9 in my last game.
---
What does the ceiling actually look like I‚Äôve never checked
---
I've played since console launch and a week or so after the stranger things release I stopped playing, I'll come back to it for the next chapter.
---
I've never had that problem
---
Wait
---
WhOs jOe
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I was just overwhelmed by seeing someone who hates bigots and is rational at the same time. It blinded me
---
That makes this fine somehow?
---
Going to push back a bit against your DS rant. As a rank 1 survivor, but one that isn‚Äôt in the top 1% of the skill base, DS feels almost necessary against good killers because if you don‚Äôt run it you will he killed off your first hook. Good killers will see that you don‚Äôt have it and just take you off the map, which will almost assuredly win them the game. I like the anti-tunneling aspect of it because as someone who plays mostly for fun, getting killed in the first 3 minutes just sours my milk.
---
Also, give BHVR some slack man. Like Jesus these people aren‚Äôt out to hurt you, tone it down a bit.
---
Quench my thirst please
---
Ya' gonna love the Doctor then...
---
Looks sticky
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying to look for people. I usually play with my friend but he‚Äôs been busy with college stuff.
---
Some people don't care about those
---
What's wrong with wanting both? As long as a new killer is added, I am happy
---
Guys Tupac is alive he's in reddit oh god oh fuck
---
She was one of the first killers I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely fucked now‚Äù after hearing it.
---
That's a mori as far as I'm concerned
---
From what a hear and see, the game is a lot better when playing in a SWF. I wouldn't know since I don't have any friends that play this game. I feel your pain though. I get farmed all the time. Or just get 1 hooked by people standing around not doing anything. It feels bad and definitely makes the game less enjoyable.
---
It‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm on console. But normally they pick me up and just put me right back on the hook the DS doesn‚Äôt activate in time since I‚Äôm directly under the hook.
---
And I have over a thousand hours spent. Your point being?
---
*Distorted Hehes in distance*

Dare I ask, what's his mori like...

It‚Äôs kindred but reverse, and different enough that I think it‚Äôs alright.

I‚Äôm wondering how the first perk would work if multiple people brought it.
---
oof mori me daddy
---
I noticed that too. Definitely made me look like a rank 20 a few times

He breaks your phone

I always feel kinda bad when hearing stunned Huntress. She's still basically a kid and she doesn't get anything at all. Her angry child-like rants make me sad.
---
***\[BIG SIPP\]***
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
Have you thought of playing with some friends and doing SWFs? I remember when I first got into the game I had no clue! But a couple of friends taught me over VC/KYF matches. I'm not anywhere near good, (Rank 11 at best) But being able to play the game with others definitely makes playing Survivor WAY more enjoyable IMO
---
It was a little sketch they did
---
Look at their Tumblr I linked
---
Just today
---
It's, Canadian?
---
I LAUGHED TOO DAMN HARD GODDAMN 
---
‚ÄúBow towards me, pleb killer!‚Äù
---
What the actual fuck
---
Oh good, another game I once loved is following in the footsteps of freemium games and becoming a even more of a fee to pay BS with premium pass Shit.
---
well fuck Video games I suppose, guess They've gone the way of the dodo.
---
Btw my teammates are not broken or anything that could cause me to not be able to heal them.
---
Maybe a update? If I was you, I would look into the patch notes.
---
No survivor
---
There‚Äôs a bug at the moment where if you take a hit st the exit gate and escape you lose the item. You don‚Äôt drop the item in game but for some reason you lose it anyway
---
I don't have any friends though, how are you meant to do that with no friends
---
So long as survivors can 99% a gate, set up a tent on that hook. 
---
So long as SWF with comms exist, park your RV by that person. 
---
So long as DS exists, plan a family vacation to hooksville. 
---
You get my point.
---
What school has you jump over bear traps with a cat scared of feathers following you?
---
What Demo bug are you referring to?
---
lotta people commenting when they dc, IMO an intentional DC should never be ok for something that isn't glitch abuse or hacking.
---
"fuck you for being good at the game"
---
The proximity line that makes you loose points if you are too close of a hook with no survivors around, I am not sure the distance tho.
---
It's Territorial Imperative... you fucking want to do it don't you lie
---
Explain how that could possibly be true, when the entire chapter is just the killer himself, no survivor and no map.
---
You guys look like this lighting brain meme
---
Run it. Bamboozle the survs.
---
ITS OP, add a insta heal on to it. Bang you're too tanky
---
Reminds me of that vine ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt kill me! I‚Äôm a bad bitch!‚Äù
---
Donkey brains
---
Now that's some horseshit right there.
---
you responded after 2 minutes, then edited it 4 minutes later. You responded to my last one after only one minute.
---
Happened to me a handful of times on ps4, since the last chapter came out.
---
Bad players are bad, nothing you can do about it. As long as survivors are smart enough to not feed him, he won‚Äôt reach a much higher rank
---
If you don't mind imma just... use some of those.
---
I had a killer do something like this and it turned out he was just baiting us to get close so he could kill us, so now I don‚Äôt trust anyone lmao
---
I always thought of it being a 12 meter dead zone around the base of the hook, even then I can't really tell what's a meter length of distance in-game
---
Whoa, is that for the archives or for the rift? Because if it's for the rift, I'm gonna be stuck there
---
Unrelenting is best for new players who don't quite have swings down, STBFL is for the MLG Pro Strat 360 noscope killers.
---
I think Huntress is the one killer who gets angrier than the others when pallet stunned.
---
Fast vaulting over fences cause the [fence to collapse](https://youtu.be/21dn0YzPLwQ)
---
‚ÄúNo please Huntress. Don‚Äôt kill me I‚Äôm obviously a survivor and not the Entity‚Äù
---
out of the all the perks every killer has access to without teachables it's probably the best. I think the only other perk that wins out is whispers.
---
I have so many keys and key addons. Ive been considering using this. Because i genuinely think bond is a half decent perk, especially for solo que. 
---
I like. I'll likely use. Especially to use up those broken kets.
---
Salty
---
Idk if they have a ruin go find it? But gens are always good to do but u are using the right perks and strats to counter so keep at it.
---
Nah it's alright considering the price
---
The amount of salt my lord ,survivors are ridiculous. Ive been a red rank survivor multiple times, i dont get why everyone gets so mad ? Its mind boggling. I dont think ive ever sent anyone a message in this game about tunneling or camping or any of that i just play the game and move on
---
Poor summer child..
---
Facecamping still gives you enough points to pip at yellow ranks, especially because yellow ranks won't just do gens to punish the killer. Generally, habitual face campers (not just a tilted killer doing it once) can make it to green ranks pretty ez but cant get much further because a) losing points due to hook proximity is enough to make you black pip and b) they lack skill when they actually try
---
lol I have the same situation but with Freddy.
---
Take her out to dinner first.
---
prayer breads and mother-daughter ring
---
Kindred reveals the aura of all survivors to other survivors and will reveal the killers aura to the survivors of he's in a relatively close position to the hooked/kindred player. As far as counters go i would prefer more of a reason for people not to camp than simply giving an anti camp perk like borrowed time. Being camped is an easy way to de-rank and it can de-rank players who don't play into it since you need more than gens to level up. If anything I would just bleed points for gens to hooked players if they are within X meters of the killer for one stage for now
---
Youre not alone .. i am also a spirit main and lost.
---
Check your math, you‚Äôre missing a very important variable.
---
wrong. i play like instantly if survivor. like 1-3 minutes ( avg 1 minutes to match ). but about 15-20 min on killer
---
When you had your camera looking down the stairs, you had it way too angled. He came from around the left corner, but you couldn‚Äôt spot him because your camera doesn‚Äôt show there. It‚Äôs like the bottom left of the screen
---
Probably moonwalked along the downstairs wall and then face forward up the stairs so you didn't see the redstain and he was just out of view.
---
Once again, like I said, the chapter comes with a cosmetic that you can‚Äôt get if you buy the character with auric cells
---
Don‚Äôt forget about god tier the third seal
---
Up the stairs but not through the door you were looking at. Where you were crouched cut out the bottom left part. I would have been hella spooked.
---
That's pretty stupid tbh, You have to play into letting survivors unhook each other just to rank up, Survivors have to run into the killer and can't completely avoid them to rank up. The ranking system is to blame
---
Can someone please tell me, without saying ‚ÄúTHey‚ÄôRe tHe SaME tHInG‚Äù does it come with the ghostface chapter? Or the character?
---
If I could, I'd give you gold for actually starting it when the stream starts.
---
This mid chapter patch is comprised of four parts: general fixes/tweaks, the rework for The Nurse (and Instaheals), the Withering Blight event (which is smaller than the other parts, but is still there), and the Archives. The "cosmetic cash grab" you're talking about is the Rift, which is only half of the Archives. That's only a fraction of what we're getting in this update, which hardly makes it the "utmost priority." Sure, they dedicated a dev stream to explaining how the Archives work, but that's because it's a new feature with a lot of questions surrounding it. They know people are wary of battle passes, so they opted for some level of transparency and explained the mechanics surrounding the Rift beforehand. That still makes it only a portion of the update, not necessarily the focus. 
---
&gt;it‚Äôs them putting the main focus on something that is purely cosmetic‚Äîthe archives.
---
The Archives, once again, are made up of two parts: the Rift and the Tome. The Rift is what you're complaining about, but the Tome is full of more ways to get BP and get extra tidbits of lore completely free of charge. The Tome is not a "cosmetic cash grab." Straighten out the facts before making an argument.

You could have made your response so much more civil, but you put the utmost priority into being an asshole.
---
Idk what this matters with camping lol
---
Yup, you got 2 min to escape after an exit door is opened or the hatch is closed. The timer will slow down if someone‚Äôs dying/hooked, but it‚Äôll never fully stop. If the timer ends and your dumbass is still squatting in front of the killer you‚Äôll instantly get killed.
---
Not everyone needs to be as enlightened as you and learn from your vast confidence and knowledge of the game and how to dodge a hatchet. Some of us actually play the game too :)

&gt; DS feels almost necessary against good killers because if you don‚Äôt run it you will he killed off your first hook.
---
DS existing in some fashion isn't the problem, DS being hook immunity is what's the problem. It's said to be one thing, but it's something else when you read the fine print. It's just as strong as it was, has less counters than before, and was billed as something that it's not to quell any outrage from killer mains at the time of it's "rework". I didn't appreciate the shady practices from BHVR and called out their lies from the start.
---
&gt; Good killers will see that you don‚Äôt have it and just take you off the map, which will almost assuredly win them the game.
---
Good killers kill. What do you expect them do? Every survivor's living or dying should depend on their own skill level; likewise every killer's kill count should depend on their own skill level.
---
&gt; I like the anti-tunneling aspect of it because as someone who plays mostly for fun, getting killed in the first 3 minutes just sours my milk.
---
There was a way to make this perk an anti-tunnel one, but this wasn't it. It's anti-don't-kill-me-too-fast. There's a big difference. They had over a year to come up with something that punishes true tunneling (not the survivor made up definition, but true tunneling) and they blew it. They served us a meal on a garbage can and said "ta-da" as if they wanted a pat on the back. Here's me kicking that garbage can lid from their hands and front kicking them on the chest.
---
&gt; Also, give BHVR some slack man. Like Jesus these people aren‚Äôt out to hurt you, tone it down a bit.
---
Gotta be me, man. I am hyper competitive. I just don't like it when a dev creates something that punishes my objective and then tells me it's a rainbow. They could have been honest about what they were doing. But they knew the reaction they'd get, so they decided to play politician with The. Single. Most. Hated. Survivor. Perk. In the game.

never in any of my messages did I say "it's ok to use iri hatchets with belt", but sure

thank you for reporting this the post has been removed
---
Definitely laugh :D
---
Eh. If the killer‚Äôs in control of the game (for example, there‚Äôs three or four gens still up) then there really isn‚Äôt any need to tunnel. Just get the person who did the save. That way you have one person who needs to heal (or will be getting healed by someone else) while you chase another person. If it‚Äôs a quick chase, that‚Äôs now two or three people that won‚Äôt be on gens. Also it‚Äôs way less asshole-ish. Nobody wants to load into a game just to spend the whole game on the hook or on the ground.
---
However, if the game is reaching its conclusion, obviously yeah, just go for the kill to get a player out of the game.
---
Imagine having this pic on steam and then riposting it here to get noticed... Thats gonna be a yikes from me dawg

Im creeped out on whether you were saying that just for üòÇor if you were üòè

Ik it was just for üòÇ

I tried to headbutt gen and the spin around but both always fail, the only thing I found is downing them then letting them wiggle free
---
Gratz!

Just because you acknowledge it‚Äôs a dead meme doesn‚Äôt make it any more funny when you post it

Territorial Imperative for a meme build, dont go assuming man
---
Sometimes a gameplay video is particularly special, and worth sharing. In this case, there's a lot of RPDR fans and LGBT folk in this community, so a video by a drag queen is noteworthy.
---
If Trixie starts making these videos regularly, *then* sharing them would be spammy.
---
I wouldn't say degraded, it's like how both sides are laughing at each other.
---
Mainly the placement of where the spirit is. That's what made this iffy. Also there are just lots of other weird placements. Hag is strong but definitely not the second best. I main hag so I'm pretty confident about that.
---
I got matched with a bunch of rank 12‚Äôs and a 10 (I‚Äôm a 5, one pip off 4). One of them messaged me post game being extremely rude and claiming to have carried the game. 
---
They were all potatoes and I got 4 out of 5 gens done by myself.
---
Spirit and nurse are very strong killers, but a good survivor can still do a chase with them. It is much more difficult I agree, but then again to have chases with the rest of the killers most of it is playing ring around the rosy.
---
But...they‚Äôre just people that‚Äôs like me spamming a video everytime monto uploads, plus its barely about the content creator and it‚Äôs just people using them as a way to get karma
---
Thank you :)
---
Idk if I should be worried üòÇ
---
This should be used for all the Meg, Dwight, Jane and Laurie players out there.üòÇ
---
They always screw me over.
---
Maybe because you‚Äôre calling another person ‚Äúa thing‚Äù? Just a thought
---
Ohh so some survivors are about to have a bad day
---
I've been learning Huntress preparing for the Nurse changes, so far I'd rate her about even with Hag. Would you agree?
---
I kinda see it as swf is the best and worst thing to happen with this game. Without it i don't think that dead by daylight would be as popular as it is now and its nearly too hard to balance the game around it.
---
Mori: Chants to the entity and buries you in a pile of paint buckets
---
I rather they put a different item in tonwork with those perks, hatch removal is what I would like. Let survivors earn their escape and not betray their team for the sake of not dying.
---
*With great difficulty, it involves the dreaded* ***socialising.***   
---
(In all seriousness tho) If on PC, I'm more than happy to team up with whoever's wanting to make friends/find survivors to tag along with
---
While healthy or forced to run Iron Will she is strong but balanced with counterplay mindgames.  But while injured no Iron Will?  You might as well hook yourself.  She loses all counterplay if she can hear your groans of pain.
---
You wouldn't say degraded. I would though, because you have quite literally said you wanted to see how long I could personally insult you because "it seems fun." I don't know any other human being on earth that would want to endure HOURS  of being insulted but hey man like I said. I'm not a kinkshamer so get yours bud. But just understand. Not a lot of people are going to be as understanding of your fetishes as I am.
---
Neal* for a guy?
---
I just want wounded healer to be fixed ;-;
---
Instaheals are gonna be removed, but you still can mori people right off the hook
---
They will eventually nerf Spirit
---
wow a rework that‚Äôs 90% nerfs to a low tier killer making him only slightly more effective against randoms and 10x weaker against SWF 
---
nice, BHVR should make you head of balance.
---
DAE SHES STILLA  KID DAE OPLEASE HELP MY AIDS IS TAKING OVER MY ENTIRE BODY HELP
---
So many questions haha
---
So the first rift to be released will have skins for characters other than just Trapper and Claudette? 
---
Will every challenge be a ‚Äútier‚Äù level so it‚Äôll be 70 challenges to reach the max?
---
Can u complete a rift (free or premium) without doing anything on the tome?
---
And finally (lol) will everyone have the same same challenge per tier?
---
Haha thanks for reading/responses
---
Carry one away from the hatch, drop them, hook the other, return to the one you dropped -&gt; profit.
---
Quality content
---
Classic Gaston player. Most Gaston mains just taunt
---
Smart killers will focus the unhooker in that situation.  Dumb ones will tunnel the unhooked eat their Decisive and then come on here to post DECISIVE STRIKE IS OP BULLSHIT!!!
---
They should make a killer whos gay to piss off the homophobes when they get killed
---
Sometimes at the end of the match I competed a daily ritual for something and I never even had that ritual to begin with
---
at this point it would be trolling I think. But this convo reached the point where almost no one is gonna read it, so whatever its fine
---
&gt;People say stuff about being a main or not to attempt to clarify that they aren't forming their opinion as an inexperienced killer etc... Again defaulting to well you could be lying is just a copout and doesn't move forward the conversation at all.
---
Exactly, which makes it irrelevant and useless information
---
&gt;Lol!  Dude I didn't look up your profile.  I remember your name from countless threads on here as I'm highly active on this sub and simply remember you as being one of those guys that routinely accuses people of lying on here.  Just saying it's obnoxious and accomplishes nothing.  
---
Welp, depends. I had someone stalking me recently, that hopefully got banned now since he didn't post anything in any of his 2 acc made to stalk, so I don't know what are you talking about specifically.
---
&gt;If you think having to run a perk to have a chance against a specific killer is balanced I don't know what to tell you.
---
It does counter every killer tho. Plus I can make the same point for the core of the game. Being forced to use a perk to make the game slightly longer is pretty unbalanced too don't you think?
---
The difference is, one is to counter every killer by losing line of sight and using stealth, the other is a basic core gameplay that is broken and been tried to fix it with perks that are mandatory to not have a 4min game
---
&gt;She is pretty busted when you're injured and she can hear you and that's all the guy was pointing out.  It just annoys me when people pretend like oh Spirit ain't a big deal just juke your scratch Mark's which does work while silent...but once you make noise you know damn well counterplay go bye bye without Iron Will on.
---
That's your fault and decision to run the same exact perks all the time and don't adapt to the shift of the meta. Instead of adrenaline I run iron will and I have no problems with her, unless she uses prayer beads which is actually annoying and should be changed/made ultra rare
---
You can't complain because you have to run a perk to counter the best killers (including nurse, Billy, hag and so on) in the most efficient way possible. You never played killer if you think in that way dude.. I don't know what to tell you‚Ñ¢
---
&gt;I'm glad to hear once you were called out on this you made no attempt to dispute it. 
---
I.. I just did.. and did even before now that I read it. Maybe you missed it? Might be
---
&gt;Again being forced to run a perk to compete against a killer isn't balance and that's why survivors tend to be annoyed with Spirit.  She seems overly oppressive compared to any other killer in the game in that scenario.  Being injured against anyone else isn't really a big deal except maybe Nurse
---
So your point is "I wanna run whatever I like and be fine" which is pretty entitled if you ask me. Every killer MUST run certain perks or is shit. Only few can have the luxury to change 1 or 2 things like nurse and spirit. The others HAVE to run specific perks to be effective against red ranks or they just lose. That's it
---
Your argument is based on survivor experience only, I think. Since these arguments can be EASILY made for the other side, hands down. Do you think a trapper can run whatever and be fine? A ghostface run whatever and be ok? No. 
---
As said only spirit and nurse can switch up two perks at best since ruin or something to slow the gen just a little bit‚Ñ¢. And something to track the survivors like BBQ, they are forced to do it like many others are even more severely forced to run specific perks
---
Please, play killer at red ranks. Don't tell me you do already, I won't believe you after you bring up the argument "it's not fair I have to run specific perks" which is laughable to me
---
I wasn't aware of that. I definitely get teammates who hide in corners instead of pushing through gens still in green, but didn't think killers continued to face camp through that many ranks. I just figured you learn quickly that it isn't the way to pull in the most points.
---
Let them bleed out so when you pick up one the other dies near immediately or if a hook is close you should be able to get back in time before the hatch opens
---
The guy ur commenting on is like a rank 4 survivor and rank 1 killer lol.
---
I already had both of them in my arms before but no hook was close by so if i picked one up they would escape
---
*made with mematic*
---
So, you come in. Yell at me for being a dick. And then attempt to be a dick yourself. .-. You lived long enough to see yourself become the very thing you sought to destroy.
---
Nice legion cosplay üëç
---
i mean it takes a very long time for the hatch to open so you have plenty of time
---
They're probably going to start working down the line until they eventually get to the DLC characters. If they do add in a Demogorgon/Steve rift, it'll probably be 16 Rifts in since they were the 16th characters added.
---
That's even if they do Licensed characters. While I don't know if we'll ever see a Freddy/Quinten rift, I'd be surprised as hell if we never saw a Spirit/David rift.
---
FOR EVERYONE HERE I IM GONNA POST THE VID OF WHAT HAPPEND AFTER
---
Damn, I am hungry...  ‚ÄúWELL HI HUNGRY, IM DAD‚Äù
---
The oldest repost in the book
---
Where can I download this üòÇ
---
Was that Nancy stuck in the locker? Same thing happened to me and I was also playing Nancy. It happened after I healed myself with inner strength. When I tried to leave the locker I got teleported back inside and could not leave. Not even the killer could pull me out.
---
Well, if you don't wanna learn how to dodge them, that's your choice. It's not a good choice, but it's your choice.  
---
But, if you're not even gonna put up an effort, you're in no place whatsoever to blame the game's servers if you get hit by one.
---
It does :3
---
Ello good day Mister Demogorgon
---
Don't tunnel
---
If you DC before it goes off you can‚Äôt get hit by DS.
---
Iirc this is alongside the issue, or similar to, the one where you can't escape and that is fixed by pretty much being hooked and unhooked, have you tried it? (This is not a troll post btw just this happened to me and when I was hooked and unhooked it fixed, just like the bug where you can't escape).
---
Wow we'll come back to the you accusing everyone of lying thing at the end on this one.
---
Again I don't stalk anyone or look up post history you have a name that is easy to remember and I literally remember how argumentative as well as your propensity towards defaulting to accusing others of lying by default anytime they disagree with you.
---
Bro how did you just dispute the claim that I made that Iron Will is required to play her.  You quite clearly just acknowledged this as a fact and admitted that you run the perk yourself.  Not only did you not dispute it which you just claimed you did but you actually agreed with me on it.
---
And being forced to run a perk isn't balance and no you are clearly referencing Ruin with the mandatory killer perk thing and this isn't accurate.  There are absolutely alternatives to running Ruin.  Corrupt Intervention and Pop just to name a few.  There are entire killers before these even became meta where you could make the argument they never needed Ruin like Nurse and Billy.  Some player flat out make the argument Ruin isn't even that strong of a perk because while it stomps weak survivors, strong survivors can be so good at hitting great skillchecks that it's barely a hindrance.  Not to mention the fact it can be found and lost in the first 30 seconds of the match.
---
Now let's walk this back to the very first thing in my first comment I called you out on and that's your default go to maneuver of accusing the other person of lying.  Read your final two paragraphs.  You're doing it to me as we speak.
---
I don't lie online it's pathetic and sad and accomplishes nothing.  Hayden.  I've got over 3K hours in this game.  I've been playing on PS4 since a few months before the Wraith Cube came out.  I began as a killer main for the first two years before transitioning to a 50/50 player about a year ago for variety and to know and understand both sides of the game.  I used to hit rank 1 every month back when I only played killer and I've done it across multiple rank systems both pre and post emblems.  I have played plenty of red rank killer games over the years.  These days I usually stop around rank 3 or 4 since I play so much survivor too which I also play through red rank.  You seriously have to stop doing this.....People are not liars just for disagreeing with you.  There was this obnoxious dude named Hexohjeezohno that pulled the same shit around here and it was frightfully obnoxious.  Engage in a discussion don't copout by calling the other side a liar.  It's just sad man and doesn't get either of us anywhere.
---
That's why I run unbreakable, DS and borrowed time. The killer literally cannot slug tunnel or camp.
---
I almost spat out my muffin laughing at this
---
Hey, resident Canadian here. Who is also whiter than white bread. Did you come up with that all by your racist self? This is holy crap wrong. Is there a lot of refugees here, yes. But they are a huge minority but that are perfectly wonderful to talk to and are nicer than most "nice whites" I know.
---
i'm sure you've literally never heard of a figure of speech before. Michael Jackson looked more like a human being than this person
---
.-. You....thought I was being serious? Why? Because of one post giving context? No nonononononono I've been making fun of you from the moment I told you to suck dick. You don't even have an argument. You just came in here  and called me a dick and told me to stop. You opened the door to be bullied.
---
Hello my attention span is very short, when's this being released
---
Me, an intellectual Myers main will always go after that one person and mori him with an ultra rare memento mori.
---
I would do the world a huge favour.
---
Every time I bring a broken key lately, the killer runs Franklins. Love it.
---
They shouldn't though, not cause I'm against it but I just like that stuff not being specified because it's a game and I really don't wanna see it get political
---
I'm on xbone I'm gonna try to go down next to a hook to test it lol
---
What do you mean by your last sentence? Are you asking me why would ghostface not come differently than leatherface? Or are you asking why would he not come with the chapter?
---
Yeah I fall into your red ranks category. I die more often with red rank mates than purples or greens lol.
---
maybe minimalist isnt the right word, there's nothing even remotely minimalist about these, they're all very flashy
---
With noed and bloodwarden, I don‚Äôt mind leaving the hook. I patrol between the hook and the gate I know is open, I‚Äôm almost guaranteed to find scratch marks and a survivor. With another hook, I trap everyone and usually can make another hook before the gates stop being blocked.
---
We all make comprehending mistakes. But what‚Äôs good here is you don‚Äôt even need to pay for anything. Free track is just free stuff. And if you do decide to drop $10 for the premium all the rewards are retroactive so just play on the free track, make it to the end, then buy the paid track and get not only all the rewards but you get your auric cells back. It‚Äôs like Diet Free.
---
No I agree. I rant from time to time but overall I just try to enjoy the fun factor and it's a bonus if i live. Because surviving seems tough these days.
---
Whenever I see Survivors picking Haddonfield I make sure to Close Application i'm not putting up with their bullshit.
---
Do better
---
I know this feeling too well. It's getting really hard to be a killer and have fun. A lot of survivors will just absolutely tear you a new one if you do anything. Me and my friend both play as a killer and survivor, and so many killers we talk to are always amazed when we actually say they did a good job and talk to them like a human being.
---
I feel that having voiced actions that the killer is completely unaware of unless in a chase would be nice.
---
Mate, believe me I encounter that way more than I'd like to Haha. I'm distracting killer as far away as possible from last gen hoping the last mate will pop it, and nothing until AFTER I get downed and hooked.
---
As a Min main I approve of this cuteness great job
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
To be fair, Spirit is one of my favorite killers to go against. Maybe its my play style but I escape more spirits than any other killer and i find her very fun in a chase. Iron will is my staple perk against all killers and it makes escaping a chase with spirit very easy and most times very funny. I really dont understand all this sudden hate for her. I guess it comes down to adjusting your play style around each killer instead of tryinv thecsame things over and over. To me Spirit is quite balanced and fun to play and play against.
---
unnerving presence but that's rng if they hit it
---
I still don't understand why this isn't being punished more heavily at this point, especially if we're on dedicated servers.
---
If you DC on accident, it's not going to be a big deal, because you aren't going to start getting stacked penalties, but if it's happening a lot, it needs to start stacking and keep people out of games for longer.
---
If you're disconnecting, you need a break from the game anyways, not to join a new game (rewarded)  for fucking over your last group, only to potentially fuck over the next group.
---
Anyone who thinks we shouldn't punish these people is just part of the problem/actually one of these people who legit thinks they are more important and entitled to it over everyone else.
---
I said my point once. You argued against noed sure, but you were being a real dick about it. thats all. after I think the third reply its just shitposting and trolling. I doubt anyones reading this tho.
---
Haha with the sad level of teammates right now, Idk you might would get us still lol.
---
tbh if you get a 4k you should be guaranteed at least safety pip. i think the goal is so that you dont get boosted from stomps, but if anything stomps should just be void, not make you derank...
---
killer name is a joke
---
lol you should call it "Entity in Full Bloom"
---
It still kinda works in low ranks like 20-15 saved me quite a few times

ULTRA RARE OFFERING - THESE HANDS - if a Survivor unhooks you within 5 meters of the Killer without Borrowed Time, gain the ability to BEAT THEIR SHIT IN, causing them to DIE instantly. You gain all of the murdered Survivors Bloodpoints.

---
Ignorance at its finest
---
Again, it's just one video, and an especially noteworthy one at that. Letting this one slide isn't going to open a floodgate of drag queen gameplay videos getting spammed here with impunity, because there are barely any videos of that type.
---
The last the devs said they're still in the works for getting the licencing done. It's probably a Nintendo issue and not the licence holders themselves causing the holdup so it should be just a short time. The gameplay isn't bad at all and something to remember is it's just recently released, so for a game that was built for PC it's going to take some fine tuning. To play it properly on switch you should have a controller though which is the only set back out of box. As for the PS vs Switch answer.. what would you most likely play more. Switch comes with the same DLC's with Spirit as an added bonus plus is portable. Ps4 is not so portable and costs more for live. I'm unbiased to any one system besides PC as I own the game for all 3 and they each have their benefits, PC obviously having the most hands down for online but needing to buy more DLC. If you see yourself getting a Switch for other things than maybe go that route.. But the same can be said for PS. PS has the better graphics out of the 2 currently. Switch runs on dedicateds and is not host dependant like PS currently is. I find the player base on Switch to be a lot more casual opposed to PS which has a lot more dedicated players. There's subtle differences like that but honestly it's what you want to get out of it. PS would be the "better" choice system wise but again it's kinda preference. You could maybe even find someone's old gaming PC for the cost of either of them tbh.
---
And I thought cosmetics weren‚Äôt supposed to give the survivors an advantage! Smh smh
---
The game since the beginning and into its current state is a poorly optimized piece of trash. The fact that anyone would buy it on switch is beyond me. And that's coming from someone with 1500 hours on the game.
---
I love lich but he is a bit too op with his power
---
Learn how to loop. That's what helped me. I would also say just focus on doing gens and you should be fine but, I suck at survivor too. I get downed pretty fast if I'm getting chased right away.  But truly there's no trick, bud. I've only gotten better with time and only now am I starting to learn how to loop effectively....barely lol
---
It‚Äôs a hit or miss for me. I play with friends and most of the time we can call out if it‚Äôs a soundwhore or not. When you get P3 spirits or the ones in the schoolgirl outfit, they‚Äôll usually abuse the hell out of the sound.

Could have a cooldown to where if two players have a healing voice charm, if one of them plays all of them go on cooldown in a 16m radius or something.
---
.-. You seem real concerned about the amount of people reading this. Also. My point was I don't care if you think I'm a dick. I do not. I. Do. Not. I don't even know who you are. Lol. Like, why are you here? What compelled you to say that when you have no real context for what was said self admittedly? You wanted someone to pat you on the head for being a good boye or gorl and calling out the mean person. And now you're just flailing around meandering and bullshitting because again. You. Don't. Know. Shit.
---
Reminds me of a fright from psychonaughts
---
No thank you, the killer should always be on top and remain unkillable, bullying in DBD is already rampant as it is.
---
Why is it not true?
---
Are you okay?
---
They could definitely keep them quiet for the Killer unless it's in a chase, though I don't know if that would be necessary since all those actions (healing, unhooking, repairing) make noise anyway so it's not like it would give anything away.
---
I‚Äôve been facecamped in red ranks. Fuck knows how they made it that high.
---
Fucking creep, you can't just make an account and immediately make a rape joke then say something super racist.
---
SAME GLITCH happened to my friend in the basement, Stevus Christ has risen.

Hmm, I‚Äôm beginning to see what you‚Äôre saying. I don‚Äôt encounter true tunneling all that often but rank 1-5 killers hover near the hook so often these days which is why I‚Äôm convinced DS is necessary. What do you think they should change about it?
---
Because to me, survivors living or dying is very co-dependent. If someone gets sacrificed before 2 gens or so are done, it is almost assured that everyone else will die just due to the huge decrease in pressure. Again, as someone who is rank 1 but not at the very top skill-wise, to win a game we almost have to find ruin early-ish and have the killer not pseudo-tunnel.
---
I just feel like good killers will snowball to a 4K relatively easily with the new method of hovering near the hook (relatively new, that is).
---
Unless...? üò≥
---
sluggy boy
---
Yeah I agree hopefully they change it I‚Äôm pretty sure they changed the skilled huntress achievement the taking one for the team achievement is the last one I need
---
You'd be surprised with how dumb some killers can be &gt;!myself included!&lt;
---
Same, I have just been experiencing the burnout. Normally I want to get up to at least purple ranks to avoid all of the brainless teammates, but lately I just haven't been able to convince myself to get over that hump, even with going for adept and perk roulette plays leading me to be sandbagged every match by green rank tryhards that think they know everything about the game despite needing every meta perk and ultra rare flashlights only to still die at the hands of a Wraith that was trying to derank and farm points to begin with.
---
Wait what ? Someone explain. I'm pretty new

Skilled Huntress is still 100 long range hits on PS4. Rip
---
chase another survivor
---
take the DS and keep tunneling
---
While it doesnt; unrelenting used to affect hit attacks. And they stacked.

Same here. Unless I go literally dozens of games in a row of being an asshole and farming, this one is going to take a while. I haven‚Äôt made any progress on it in over a week because the killer hasn‚Äôt been nearby. It‚Äôs insane. 
---
They also changed the Legion achievement to down people with feral frenzy. Originally it required you to go back and forth between people, but now you just need to down people while they have deep wound active, so like for example if you‚Äôre playing Billy and down someone with Borrowed Time, you‚Äôd still gain progress. 
---
I‚Äôm really hoping either the number gets reduced or the requirements get changed for this achievement. As it stands, it sucks lol

The only thing that isn't effective vs swf would be that players appear to be killed when hooked in the basement, I'm pretty sure players can count their randoms hooks as well not to mention its more of a buff than a nerf
---
People give Legion such a bad time with these tier lists. They‚Äôre definitely not great at all but I play only Legion and I‚Äôve reached red ranks with them a lot. I‚Äôd say any killer can be god if you put time into themüòö

Tip: You can screenshot or game record on xbox and then use the xbox app to download your clips to your camera roll, this will improve quality for your next post. btw congrats on the prestige!
---
If I want fun I will play pig
---
You burn it as an offering and you get to play a certain killer, I had a glitch where I got a splinter on pig when I bought her, don't know how or why but it happened
---
One character stereotype that I'm pretty sure everyone knows is that megs farm a lot
---
Ace needs to save his hands for fingerguns.
---
Basically me
---
Maybe they can get off now, but they can‚Äôt get off again.
---
It's so odd to see worlds colliding like this, but I love it. It makes sense that Trixie plays, she basically grew up in the Wisconsin equivalent of Coldwin Farm lol.
---
Do you keep the same perks or do you go in with no perks or add ons
---
Havnt had a NOeD game in while and forget, do u see that ur exposed or is it a secret until ur hit üòÇ
---
I think most Bills are dumb, Claudettes are toxic, and feng‚Äôs are gen jockeys
---
The ultimate mindgame
---
Cant wait for feet pics myers
---
Yep. Spine chill is a good counter and a great perk against all killers. I personally dont run it as i can rely more on my eyes and headset for close to the same information.
---
Broken keys should be a common item
---
Euegh! Agh! Arrrghhhh... (dies)
---
lol ok
---
Just eat the DS then smack and re-hook the survivor.
---

---
Trixie Mattel! She's one of the most famous drag queens right now (I think she's doing the rounds on different YouTube channels because she's currently promoting her documentary, stand up special, and new makeup line)
---
I don‚Äôt wanna do it.
---
What if stabs me with her abnormal spider legs?
---
idk, maybe if they had bear trap on head, is it better to chase another survivor since they are not doing gens. but who knows what you think right? maybe kind of tunneler? no body knows except you and them
---
I‚Äôm glad you replied first. I was just gonna say ‚Äúfuck off.‚Äù Yours is better.
---
That‚Äôs no longer an option lol
---
i can hear this picture.....
---
i‚Äôm gonna kill myself
---
I like to think all wraiths camp, all ghosts are super toxic, all hags overuse traps, all nurses slug, and all billies camp without realizing that they have the most map control
---
As a ghost face main, I enjoy actually being creepy stalker... Others however...
---
Demo is best boy and does nothing wrong.
---
Steve's are general out to sabotage everyone else.
---
You forgot about Nea
---
he is just another toxic boy. but bigger. if you say he is the influence? not really. he just another toxic boy who like to put screaming, swearing in his videos. he just need the view and money, he doesnt care the others
---
I‚Äôd run it
---
Davids safe unhook without BT.
---
That‚Äôs probably because Tapp is not as popular a skin.
---
P I L L S  H E R E
---
On the flip side with freddy is that Borrowed time doesnt work at all against him.
---
Franchish
---
I would use Haunted Ground, but I don't have it.
---
No I dont feel like grinding
---
I think that's PS4 sided, as they barely change throphies.
---
Why you always lyin‚Äô
---
Thats ok :)
---
Haddon and Ormond are the only two times I'll ever DC. I cannot remember the last time I won anything there
---
He that strong yet he‚Äôs still garbage
---
Thanks for explaining how the Archives worked, it's as if nobody in this thread saw how it worked. The difference is that some of us know what the long term impact is on cosmetic shit and it's a company becoming more and more incentivized to make money rather than make a good game. But hey, it's up to you if you feel like being yet another shithead troll that's just trying to make mountains out of molehills out of my original critique.
---
Slug, Bodyblock, don‚Äôt let them get unhooked
---
Dying light and thanataphobia counter each other
---
Or don‚Äôt make this bloody Nea kill a Legion.
---
As a Bill main I try to do him justice.
---
yikes.
---
huh sure
---
oH rEaLlY?
---
Your friend is Joaquin Phoenix?
---
She lost them a long time ago in an accident...
---
oh
---
Power 30 seconds default? With a 50% hinderance to the survivors movement speed. That‚Äôs probably too strong lol. 
---
Also the librarian should really be a girl.
---
The entity is harder to please than my last girlfriend.
---
That is some disgusting lightning adjustments you have there
---
Of course sweaty.
---
Just a mom from the suburbs with two kids trying out a horror game for the first time
---
Love it &lt;3
---
Joey needs to step his game UP
---
That‚Äôs the point of her makeup Oop.
---
It's only not bannable because they cant enforce it, you're still totally breaking the spirit of the rules and the game
---
 Ok so I main both survivor and killer.  Recently more of survivor because why not I want to get red rank. I have gone against campers and while it does suck to be camped there are ways out of it. A good example is saving someone if you have borrowed time or if they have DS. But if your being camped, honestly stay on the hook, struggle as long as you can so your either teammates can get gens. It‚Äôs scummy but it‚Äôs better to be the only one that dies and not the whole team.
---
Preach.
---
Okay firstly, the idea of the power is to slow down people to hit them, once you hit them your out of the power zone and can escape so not to OP as you suggest but it‚Äôs a concept that would need testing.
---
As for the gender bias, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a boy or girl but I like the idea of a gent.
---
Just what we needed another game getting fucked by a Battle Pass
---
Im sorry for asking this, but whats abdominal dressing
---
Dude, I have to go to work in the morning and now I'm not going to get any sleep....
---
It‚Äôs still 30 seconds it‚Äôs kind of like clown but it‚Äôs always on you lol. 
---
Gender I just prefer female as a librarian lol. That‚Äôs what I picture sorry folks.
---
*Did you think you‚Äôd get away with copy pasting off of google images?*
---
Jokes aside, this is amazing.
---
In the past they were I think, it was a build called machinegun, so you might imagine.
---
Nah gender either way could work it‚Äôs all preference so no worries, I would love a clown effect to have the gas follow you with a red add on lol
---
Still don't understand why ghostfaces crouch in indoor maps...

Quick tip: If you are going to be running around something, stay close to the walls. When she was breaking the pallet and you started running towards the window, you ran miles away from the wall, making your path to the window take a lot longer than if you stick to the wall. If the killer was good, she would have downed you when you went for the vault. If you ran close to the wall, there would have been no way for her to catch up to you.
---
Samination didn't invent that joke. Don't imply that Samination would ever make an original joke.
---
Or, you were proxy camping and there‚Äôs no way anyone can make safe rescue without you spotting them doing so. BT means jackshit when you intend on tunnelling the unhooked person. Devs need to do something about tunnelling and proxy camping.
---
This was painful to watch. With the killer being Myers it makes it even worse
---
[Oh? You're approaching me?](https://i.imgur.com/WnSkwZX.png)
---
Still busted tho
---
I see where you're coming from, but I disagree.
---
Oh well. At least itll let me know if a killer is worth it
---
heck yeah i need that in my games right now, plz devs
---
Somehow the name knowledge can kill doesn't sounds good, at least doesn't sounds like it fits with the rest.
---
If you complete the animation before closure. Nothing about jumping into the air means you made it through the hole.
---
Yep
---
Well you either deal with an m1 killer that can one hit or get sniped by vomit and get easily downed
---
Bubba
---
WTF? What is this verdict? I mean, not that I care who has it but to split it like this?
---
Who has Jason then?
---
Define "do better" against a perk can hold onto all game?
---
Emotions are strong with this one. He‚Äôs not saying ‚Äúshe‚Äù isn‚Äôt a human period only that she doesn‚Äôt look like on due to her excessive makeup. If I dressed like a werewolf would i ‚Äúlook‚Äù like a human? No. 
---
TLDR; quit being sensitive and looking for a reason to bash someone who doesn‚Äôt agree with your ideas. Sticks and stones may break your bones but words should never hurt you.
---
The fact that you just said that means you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about lol.
---
Make it 5
---
She turns into huntress but literally 10x better
---
My friend had a glitch where it looked like Myers was having sex with bill. He was watching as I got downed in spectators and he was like wtf is going on. For him I was riding Myers from the front but for me I was on his shoulder
---
If the the person on hook wasn't the obsession then why would you instantly assume they have DS they could easily be faking you out.
---
Ummm he is f tier
---
Lol chalk it up to uh you just don‚Äôt know how to play him.
---
Ignore the people giving you shit my man, I've definitely seen worse for a first attempt
---
ü§´
---
I think it‚Äôs displeased that you‚Äôre playing on PS4
---
Generators are already slow and boring, there is no need to make them slower and more boring.
---
Ever heard of a  colloquialism? You know what he means by pro player, stop being pedantic.
---
What rank are you?
---
it is technically possible if a tile fails to load most commonly found in newly released maps, but these issues almost never make it through the PTB now.
---
Dehumanizing someone isn‚Äôt a figure if speech but work
---
But they aren‚Äôt removing her so people will play her.
---
Whatever rank you want me to be because I don‚Äôt decide you decide lol.
---
No it's called git gud
---
Just gotta practice using her phase properly. When your chasing use your phase and mind game them. Imagine where you think they go and pop out an whack them
---
no way, this would basically be how he was before. He could easily just hit the survivor once and then cancel frenzy and eventually use frenzy again to down the survivor. It would remove all skill from legion yet again.
---
Did infectious fright is good in general.
---
More like the devs
---
Sorry I said Miller, I meant Cunningham. Jason is bound to Miller and the rest of the series to Cunningham.
---
when you think tunneling is just something people do to be mean and it turns out to be the high rank meta
---
Correction make it 7, it says 6 for me but i gave myself a negative so idk if it says 6 or 7 for you
---
Probably because you put in his gamertag
---
Still says 4 for me tbh.
---
There's no way unnerving presence works with ds, are you joking?
---
You do realize unnerving effects ds skillcheck
---
Dehumanizing someone isn‚Äôt a figure of speech, but work
---
I mean, its not completely over but thats the most likely outcome tbh
---
Lemme guess when u got to the menu you were canibal
---
I have been told several time ‚Äúpublicly shaming other players (no matter how funny they‚Äôre msgs are) isn‚Äôt allowed and all names must be blurred out‚Äù and  also ‚Äúover saturated context‚Äù  (even tho no matter how many times it gets posted it‚Äôs funny as hell to read people‚Äôs rage msgs) 
---
Basically the mods are dip shits on this forum and don‚Äôt want other players to be laughed at bc they rage so bad
---
That's crazy, I wonder how small it gets
---
So if I go to. Miller and say ‚ÄúI want to license Jason‚Äù what do I get other than the character? Camp Crystal Lake?
---
Well, I don‚Äôt really have a killer main. I kind of like most of them equally. Kate for survivor since she‚Äôs a cutie
---
I like to play Laurie and Ghostface
---
"Bill?" Hahaha best part of the video! Awesome stuff man!
---
You know I just realized you‚Äôd no longer need Monitor and Abuse for scratched mirror Myers after the patch comes out.
---
Yes and yes.
---
Trapper and Doctor. Started using iridescent King for the first time this evening. Lots of rage quits. Felt a little OP. Highly entertaining for me though.
---
had to remove cause you did not hide the name of the dc player
---
Oh well in that case idk if it even states a number for anyone else because on my screen it says negative 7 and is highlighted blue because i gave it negative
---
Hehe
---
Laurie/Nea and Ghostface/Myers
---
They should just remove the zero, or make it 50 or something. 250 is a crazy amount
---
Unrelenting deadass let me get into playing killer. 
---
When I was newer (still only like 40 hours). I wouldn't swing unless I knew it would hit as I was too afraid of missing and losing the chase.
---
Unrelenting let me realize it's not that big of a deal.
---
Now featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series
---
Feng and whoever I feel like playing as killer
---
I think it was a meg. How long ago was it?
---
If I complete the animation that means I should be out if the hatch.
---
Maybe every 2 hits gives a token and drop the numbers to like 9/12/15 seconds?
---
That is both hilarious and haunting
---
Whats the problem?
---
Rifts are specific in the lore revealed, but they include ton of skins for most other characters.
---
You can't complete a rift without doing challenges in the tome - challenges give you Rift Fragments to advance the track.
---
Challenges are assumed to be identical for everyone. They hadn't mentioned anything about random challenges.
---
I suck with legion
---
It's not, not me. Or isn't it. It isn't not, not me. Or is it.
---
Did you buy Freddy individually or the entire chapter with the survivor?
---
You don't really need to pay anything to play the rifts.
---
So it‚Äôs maybe definitely possibly you?
---
It‚Äôs not u it‚Äôs just Legion
---
I play decent for my level but purple perk team just shitting on me all the time
---
Best way to okay him is yo get ckose to a survivor and when ykur witbin reach just sgart using the frenzy attack.. acter a hit look around and look for other survivors aura.  If they are ckose enough tou can rush at them and continue use the frenzy. Its a useful way to injure the survivors and slow the game down
---
"Okay. But there was a goat."
---
When Tomes are done (after 70 days) they become locked. You can still view the story if you unlocked it, but otherwise - it's done and no challenges can be done.
---
It's only the 10000th time this has been posted today..
---
You will technically be able to unlock all his teachable perks if you get him to lvl 40 before logging out or switching killers
---
Even a built in GPU from a PC made literally right now, is not designed for gaming in the slightest
---
Damn, it's almost like this sub is made up of individuals.
---
I don't hate any of the killers it's just when I play against trapper it is a game of anxiety
---
Whole chapter for all of them. Still get them for Mikey too it's just not as common.
---
Yes, but actually, no.
---
Grabbing something out of a chest when you can escape is not worth it. Usually it‚Äôs a brown item unless you have the perk.
---
Same if survivor just stops in a chase and gives up. I just want to hug them because I know they've lost all hope.
---
Google gen grabbing spirit
---
I‚Äôll write it down as a yes‚Äônt
---
Or add -ier or -iest and it‚Äôs an insult even with ‚Äúthe‚Äù
---
wow the mindgames
---
It was a while ago I believe, it was on Yamaoka Estate
---
I can't commit to that.
---
Yeah, while the tittle really fits the story, it needs some twitching to fit with the rest.
---
The easiest would be Deadly Knowlegde.
---
Anyway, thinking about it more, the story has some troubles as well, for example the victorian clothes, if you think about it they add nothing to it, you could simply put him in a Victorian age. his killer motives are also somewhat weak, him thinking everyone is a cultist seems somewhat weird and improbable, and it wouldn't be long before an asshole like Freddy, Herman or Ken would reveal that just to fuck with him.
---
My suggestion is that you actually work around him becoming tainted by the entity, like the rest of the tragic killers. Maybe something about him researching too much into the bad parts of human history made him a misanthrope or soething like that, or maybe even discovering who the cultist were, maybe someone close to him or someone he admired, tearing down his respect foer humanity. Something like this (Sorry for the crap quality I'm not good at writting):
---
"The cult has caught up with him, as they surrounded his house, torches in hand ready to get rid  once and for all of the guy that has been pestering them, Edward managed to recognize among the crowd many of the townsfolk, neighbours, people he saw on tv, and even... his own mother...The last bit of sanity in his mind crumbled, his fear was gone, all  that remained was a hatred for humanity, he looked in the eyes of them and laughed maniacally as his house burned down with him inside. His body could not be found. in the next weeks the bodies of several townsfolk were found horribly mangled but with something in common, shoved in their mouths through broken teeth they found a page of a book"
---
Kevin needs to be the killer
---
I‚Äôve Mained Claude, David and now Ash as survivor.  I‚Äôm on rotation as killer (no Billy/nurse/spirit/hag/legion/clown).  I have mained Myers, Trapper and Bubba.  Right now I‚Äôm considering maining Huntress. (Xbox)
---
Just cause you don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a counter silly goose!
---
Really? Its a known bug?
---
Add glow in the dark paint to the outlines and scare people in the dark üòÜ
---
It is a Battle Pass, but it doesn't cost money. You can do the challenge and get rewards.
---
You can pay money to unlock the Premium Rewards track which will give you much more rewards for the same challenges done.
---
I opened the door cause I already closed the hatch, and had mercy on the last guy. Then He said "LOL" in post game.
---
It's a known bug. Apparently ban worthy, so don't go abusing it.
---
ive never wanted to get fucked by frank more in my life
---
Avoid anyone advice saying ‚Äúgraphic bad, price high‚Äù
---
I was playing Michael and saw a meg who was my obsession, I immediately changed my name to ‚ÄúDONT TOUCH MY MEG‚Äù I built up stalk just enough so I could activate tier 3 immediately. I downed meg with m1 normally, and brought her into a house on the middle school map, anytime someone came in the house I‚Äôd chase not harm them unless they healed meg.
---
After they healed her, I popped tied 3 and downed her, carrying her right back upstairs and dropped her on one of those mattresses. Rinse and repeat till other survivors left her.
---
Endgame chat I typed ‚ÄúDONT TOUCH MY MEG‚Äù and they all got a good laugh, mistaking me for camping in hopes of getting 1 kill.
---
I'll never forgive the Japanese!
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs just a list of things everyone uses all the time, not overpowered thing
---
Most of the killers are fun if you give them a chance.
---
Oh, Mine was on that one map with a factory In the middle
---
Oh no not my *Item name + addons*!
---
Omg that‚Äôs a good tactic üòÇ
---
I wonder if we had the same killer!
---
It might be an issue on your end. I hit my DS just 2 hours ago when I last played
---
Welp my bad. Glad he was done already, I never play him plus the classic baby Dwight are such a popular meme üòÇ
---
If you cleanse, she'll be able to drink from the fountain you used and gain Corrupt Purge. It's like her regular vomit, but it inflicts 1 health state of damage if it so much as grazes you. She's like the Huntress, but with easy-aim hatchets and 115% speed.
---
If you don't cleanse, you'll cough a lot (making it very difficult to hide from her, you're loud) and you'll be injured. If you're not good at looping, once she finds you you'll go down fast. 
---
You're still better off not cleansing, since it's so easy to get sick again by interacting with an infected gen or unhooking an infected survivor, or encountering her again. If you MUST cleanse, do it far away from any important area, so she's forced to walk across the map and back to get it.
---
I was on Preschool and I watched this Nea go into the locker on the other side of the hole in the floor, not even chasing her, and I walked over and pulled her out and walked her to the hatch.
---
 It was the most innocent thing I had seen.
---
If you cleanse she will turn to the terminator and kill you all
---
I wanna hear ‚Äúoh fuck he closed the hatch I was camping on‚Äù
---
You can‚Äôt prove he‚Äôs there
---
That 1 person who drops in every once in a while to stay informed cuz forum's are too much of a hassle
---
I thought the process of coming up with this build was interesting and that the match itself was actually very fascinating. I beat them because I caught them off-guard with a build I made just for them, but that doesn't change the fact that these guys are crazy good and that their teamwork is ridiculously polished.
---
Thanks, I love to do that plus "disappearing" mid-chase to stalk and get the insta down is always fun
---
I think you got a couple things backwards there
---
Your IQ is below 0.
---
I think it‚Äôs a bigger deal that spine chill and premonition will work against him now, which is a pretty substantial nerf in my opinion since so many people are running those perks for Spirit.
---
I think it‚Äôs fine, T1 Myers isn‚Äôt that strong in my opinion to begin with.
---
Ahh...fuck. I thought I could be a bit more chill about the tome. Well let me farm the shit out of it.
---
Thanks mate!
---
Myers/Doctor/Legion and Jeff/Steve/Min
---
By all means, explain why. Don't be a contrarian just for the sake of it. Nobody's gonna take you seriously that way.
---
It makes you feel good.
---
Legion should be 1000 miles by Vanessa Carlton.
---
- Make Your Choice is triggered at the same time and has the same duration as DS, so it's not only an incentive to go after the person who unhooked them, but also a timer on if it's safe to pick them up again.
---
- Sloppy Butcher/Thanatophobia make the Survivor take longer to heal (not doing anything else) or actively punishes the entire team for them to not heal.
---
- Moris don't require you to pick the Survivor up again.
---
- Unnerving Presence makes the skillcheck much harder to hit.
---
- Slugging causes multiple Survivors to waste time picking them up/healing them.
---
- Fairly certain you can bodyblock if the terrain allows for it (don't quote me on that one though).
---
I don't see your problem with bloodlodge but ok, This map is where I find most of my 4ks
---
She's neither trans or a lesbian. She's a drag queen, that's her job. The over exaggerated makeup is a part of her brand. It's performance art, her aesthetic is basically glamorous, clown Barbie but very exaggerated. Outside of drag she's just a regular white Midwestern man.
---
Will they work against him?
---
I know Undetectable won't block it, so they will still be decent counters to Wraith, Peppa, and Ghostface. But Myers always had that innate invulnerability to them, did they say they were taking that away from him?
---
I know a few tips
---
1: wait for a buff and try to main a new killer in the meantime
---
Me and a Kate dipped when a Nea was hooked, the Bill had already bailed as well, kinds felt bad for her but the killer had NOED and was camping the Nea
---
I don't really see why they would give him undetectable without removing his other "trumps all detection perks" ability, since the only thing that would change about him would be his terror radius. Then they could just have reduced his terror radius and not give him undetectable and it would have been the exact same change.
---
My bet is on the shapeshifter.
---
Jake for now, no definite killer main
---
P3 blendette and prayer spirit with stridor
---
my bad mods plz delete
---
Sadly couldn‚Äôt correct it as I deleted running by accident lol but I‚Äôm English so I should be terribly ashamed xD
---
Some of these need a shitpost flair
---
&gt;Not in the slightest.  Rules are thrown out completely once it's endgame 
---
Rules should be thrown out when the game loads.
---
The only reason not to camp/tunnel is because it usually isn't optimal. If a situation arises where it is (hook in the center of a 3 gen, two adjacent hooks, etc), camp the shit out of it and feel great for doing it. 
---
I'll never understand why anyone complains about people playing optimally ("camping" or "gen rushing"). Complaining about balance, sure, but not the players.
---
The hunger
---
It‚Äôs quite small with Unnerving. Pair it with the doctors madness random skillcheck placement on screen and it‚Äôs super tough to hit. Not impossible, but it makes it a lot harder.
---
You can be matched against people up to 6 ranks above you iirc, it's perfectly normal
---
The Fear
---
I love Emergency Medkits, use Pharmacy on rank reset to stock up
---
The Deadlights

Lol pumped up kicks

God, I still have nightmares of machine gun Wraith.
---
P3 Nea or Laurie for Surv and Best girl Susie for Killerü§òüèªüíó
---
I had a match where I was playing Steve and this particular Michael was determined to down me and only me. When he finally got his wish, he picked me up and just walked around and didn't bother to hook me. I managed to wiggle off and he downed me again seconds later. Same thing happens with him just carrying me around, so I accept my fate and just stay on his shoulder to which he started nodding. 
---
The match goes on with the other survivors doing gens and me being carried around as Michael wanders through the map. When end game finally happens, all the other survivors take off and Michael decides to give me the hatch. I don't know what his goal was, but I appreciate the free ride. lol
---
I do this a lot with Michael actually. And a lean stalk with Ghost Face when a Jane runs by. 
---
My favorite Michael moment has to be when I was doing tombstone Myers for the trophy and the team pallet stunned me and teabagged at the pallet.
---
Three of them did this with five gens left.  I got Tier 3 in two minutes and I have my trophy.
---
I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt, because there is no link. Not yet.
---
Wraith while cloaked, Pig while crouched, Ghostface in Nightshroud, and Michael in T1 will all be given the undetectable status.
---
The undetectable status gives you 0 Terror Radius and immune to aura reading perks.
---
I think they should add a perk, maybe for some sort of Cannibal survivor, where you put a healthy survivor into the injured state while you put yourself from the injured state into the healthy state.
---
He's not solely the reason but I'd say he had a part to play it in, maybe even a big part.
---
I dunno. Ask the meat 400 upvoters.
---
Finally, some good fucking shitpost.
---
Dwight would be King let‚Äôs be real
---
So basically Erica from stranger things?
---
That‚Äôs not the issue. It isn‚Äôt ring, as my Dwight has all the perks available to him. When a new perk comes in the shrine, I buy it and the perk populates on the bloodweb because no other perk is available to my Dwight. Where do I go to get this fixed?
---
Jordan Peele‚Äôs ‚ÄúUs‚Äù chapter when?
---
God clapped by a SWF with a rank 1 and 3 rank 15s. Can confirm this. :(
---
You could also miss on purpose so the survivor thinks they can run another loop, but you hit them instead. Unfortunately this only works on bigger loops so I hope they buff it a bit.
---
I‚Äôm not suggesting you play shitty, I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt and we all start somewhere.
---
Unfortunately matchmaking has been broken for awhile.
---
Just suggesting ways to help so that you don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed. It does get easier as you go.
---
I think that's exactly why they would remove his other ability, so you  could just say "T1 myers is undetectable" and it would be consistent with the other cases.
---
I guess we'll just have to wait and see, I think either way T1 myers will be good on small maps for sure.
---
Honestly did not mean to post this here lol my bad
---
That is one blind killer
---
Because there is no pro scene in dead by daylight, the optimization and skill level of top players is much lower than perfect
---
Holy shot people who use self care should just die cuz they do nothing to help other than a 40second heal
---
Literally ever Ghostface when you break them out of stealth hahaha
---
3 to 4 ranks is normal, it‚Äôs not that big a difference
---
I agree! Look, my fellow survivors: If I'm looking for my next victim and fail to find one before you unhook, I will go straight towards where the notification took me. It's as simple as that. Unfortunately for the guy that just got unhooked, he tends to be the easiest to find because he groans in pain, so more often than not, I'm gonna tunnel the shit out of him.
---
p3 david p3 shape
---
Um ok, just hear me out. We need a drag queen survivor.
---
Ash/Laurie and Trapper/Mike
---
i fucking hate survivors and wish death upon each and everyone. survivor main ofc.
---
The correct play is to switch to Myers, equip a mori
---
Then let them bleed out and go mori some one else.
---
This is your only option sometimes, wait till theyre almost bled out then hook one.
---
I'd really only agree with Fredbear's pick.
---
Read my name... oh and huntress
---
Sorry mate, not sure. I think they have a website?
---
The Eater of Worlds
---
SWF, have two people try to unhook while one stays doing gens, one person can act as bait while the other unhooks
---
Piggy and Feng!
---
I always put "just another day" by oingo boingo with Ghost Face
---
I have the hardest time with the nurse. Timing the blinks and getting the distance right is tough.
---
Is that like a personal attack or something
---
The one good version of this meme
---
Hypocrisy. People just want a reason to get mad over. Pay them no mind.
---
good to know im on the only one with this issue, only difference is that im on PC.
---
Ace/Huntress
---
This was incredibly informative and the kind of thing I'd love to see more of. 
---
It's a damn crying shame this sort of mentality and playstyle would just be reduced to "lul, sweaty tryhard killer" instead of being seen for the amazing strategy it involved.
---
can we stop with these
---
Also because it looks a lot of Hag's perks are hex based anyway?
---
This game is really frustrating, because it seems like if I win, I somehow cheated. If I get 4K on idiots who play really cocky and don't respect my attacks, it's somehow on me that all four people got hit and hooked at the same time. 
---
I've gotten flamed for using "Spies of the Shadows" which I was under the impression was a pretty fair perk. The worst version of it too, the version that only alerts you within a 20 meter radius. So it will literally only work if you are right next to me.
---
This game's community is toxic as fuck, especially since the game is so stacked against killer in the first place.
---
Good Nurses can occasionally lose matches. It happens. Would you blame it on them not using the 5 blink build or the omega blink build?  
---
If the strongest killer in the game, whose base power is more powerful than that of any other killer, whose base power is more than enough to consistently win matches, can lose matches every now and then, then I assure you, so can the weaker killers even with their strongest add-ons.  
---
Clown with the Pinkie Finger. Insta-saw Hillbilly. Anal Beads Spirit. And, of course, IH Huntress. Losing every now and then will happen, even if you're trying your darndest to have the game hold your hand.
---
2 out of the 4 things you circled are not crutch perks, where as 3/4 of the things you ran perk wise, debatably 4 if u consider IF meta, are meta. Not to mention running the best addons barring iri hatchet.
---
If they are mindlessly yolo running at the hook that's one thing of course don't leave.  But if you decided to proxycamp from the jump in that situation regardless if you saw a single survivor or not than yes it is very lame to do that.  As you rank up you'll want them to get unhooked so you can improve your emblems and get more bp's in the process.  There is absolutely no need to mindlessly rush half the players out of the match when you are so thoroughly on control of the game like that.  Again you do you but I don't condone or do that myself in my killer games.  I'd rather use them as pressure and go chase the 3rd survivor off my gens while they're forced to pull off to perform altruism.  Games are more fun and competitive for both sides that way.
---
If downloading another game is enough for him to turn into a human lagswitch, I'm surprised people arent dodging his lobbies when they see the ping in the first place
---
We're talking about endgame here.  Gates are powered.  Nobody thinks face camping is a legit strategy any other time.
---
I meant she‚Äòs she kept on placing traps down like 30 times not that she has 30 traps
---
Just as I thought....trash.
---
Except I have no reason to not chase survivors going for the unhook. Two people hooked is far better. One will evidently get unhooked if the remaining teammates aren't jackasses. But the whole point of the killer is to waste time. Time I can get the survivors doing anything besides gens is worth it to me.
---
ITS ON MOBILE?!?!?!
---
I don't think they are crutch perks, I just think they are some of the best items in the game. I don't personally think crutch perks exist. If you play as killer against good survivors, you best hope you have good perks and addons.
---
End game yeah, this sun has changed my mind when someone said that there is no reason for the killer to want to leave a survivor once the gates are powered. So I completely agree there. 
---
You said that nobody thinks face camping is legit strategy but it happens to me pretty frequently :(
---
Imagine if we had a perk that let you suck away hook stages from a Survivor who tries to farm you so that you get hook stages back and they lose theirs in return.
---
solid art, but I will say that her cheek could be a little taller so the rest of her head doesn‚Äôt look so blocky
---
He‚Äôs a drag queen, trans and drag are two different things.
---
Super lame man.  There is no skill demonstrated whatsoever in camping survivors to death.  I want my survivors to know they were outplayed in a fun competitive match.  It's the reason I pip so easily with the new system everyone likes to bitch about around here it's also the reason I get a suspiciously low amount of post game salt as well.  If someone messages me it's more likely to be a ggwp than anything.  That's because I don't resort to crutch playstyles like camping with gens up.
---
It was my screenshot, it could have been a coincidence?
---
Try and get to green or purple ranks.  Never happens there.
---
Ghost Myers
---
I‚Äôm floating between 9 and 8, usually playing with rank 6s. I just have shitty luck lol
---
Didn‚Äôt you hear new wraith buff he‚Äôs the best killer in the game now
---
I think he is talking about things like dropping a pallet or vaulting.
---
What? Baby Dwight is evolving!
---
I have this same question!
---
Ok bye troll
---
He could‚Äôve paused installation and then started up again once the match started.
---
i mean most gens would be done by 4 minutes anyway.
---
You still shouldn‚Äôt DC...
---
F
---
Head on with decisive is extremely annoying though as well as an insta heal, also if he decides not to pick him up because of ds he has unbreakable. May not be crutch but its a pretty crappy
---
You seem really concerned with the emotional state of opponents in a video game.
---
Try not to loose perspective due to all the whining and rulebooks people invent. If you are playing to win then play to win. If that means tunneling and camping when needed then *do it*. If that means slugging when needed then *do it*. 
---
I don't get what it is about this game that people forget its a competitive multiplayer game, let alone how killers ended up actually believing in this survivor rulebook shit.
---
&gt; at the red ranks. 
---
And fuck me, I'll be "nice" after rank resets to obvious;y noob players. It's not their fault this dumbass reset is in the game. But once I'm back to red ranks its 100% no mercy 100% of the time.
---
No one is being sensitive and no one is being bashed though? These are just simple explanations for the ignorant comments that are being made, there‚Äôs no need to get defensive.
---
theyll stay green rank/lower if that's how they're gonna play
---
I was 700 BPs away from a perfect survivor game today. Good job
---
Yeah this has been around for a while and can be done on any device sadly. I've had a couple killers say that to me as well
---
Thanks for the info that clears my confusion
---
Pretty sure most emergency numbers redirect you towards the country‚Äôs emergency line
---
I usually see people complaing about the opposite on this sub
---
thanks for the info! i fully understand it now
---
That rando also drops a deuce in your shoe.
---
Head on is a meme build, you get hit once and thats it, now you play around it
---
**G L U P  G L U P**
---
f
---
&gt; I just said gg and left. 
---
You did the right thing. Just gg and leave, or close the chat. Take 5 min to untilt yourself and move on. Unless they implement any anti-toxicity mechanics that's all there is to do. Unless you are exploiting or like, blocking a dude in the corner so the game can't end or something, you aren't doing anything wrong.
---
Yep all the time. I just don't get it. Like I've lost against good things and won against good things. Who cares what perks you run.
---
Well no I wouldn't blame it on them, but I was responding to your point that
---
"you'd be dead with or without IH against a Huntress with such an extreme amount of practice. At that point, IH literally doesn't matter." Not the other points you just made, which I agree with.
---
but does this mean she can hide behind smaller objects and becomes a baby blendette 100x more powerful?!??!
---
Legion - another way out(Hollywood undead)
---
It's worth it to F L E X your superior time investment and in term skill.... your not gunna find truly good players who havent p3'd their mains.
---
Ace and the (Ghost)Face
---
This is why I just turn off chat now, people refuse to look into themselves and think about what they're doing in the game, just mindlessly blaming everyone else. If I'm being outplayed (whether playing killer or survivor) I just think to myself "this player is better than me, what can I do to improve", not blame everything and everyone else. I was once told I'll be reported for using Ruin because it's a cheater perk... I mean, hello? I hope these people at least admit it to themselves that they were just outplayed.
---
Maybe it was the same guy, but yeah, 100% coincidence. Kinda weird, even
---
Yeah, I was thinking it was the patch right before the DLC that it started.
---
Survs have perks that makes them guaranteed or more likely to be an obsession
---
Baby Claud is so adorable.... shame what she grew up to become
---
Throughout the entire match, yes. Not at the same time.
---
Nah dweet better
---
They also learned to just power through
---
I agree, it would have been nice to let him survive but it isn‚Äôt a toxic thing to do
---
Aside from some bullshit escapes its fair
---
How be a full Halloween special. Frankenstein and Frankenstein's monster. Dracula and Van helsing. A werewolf and idk who for that.
---
Same as exhaustion perks and DS and NOED. But no, I didn't lie, what will remain isn't the same as it was before.
---
I'm that bubba
---
You know the counter to getting hit on pallet drop is to not drop it right?....  it also helps if you dont camp pallets, bad idea bud.
---
Precisely. Trust me I get annoyed when I've been survivors DS and insta heal for the 100th time. But I don't blame them for using whats good. I just improve and get better. And to counter it, I use good perks.
---
She kinda looks like the girl from the Shining
---
Slug
---
Wait.. how do you teabag in a friendly manner?
---
Loona :)
---
Even better! They could even do cosmetics. Wraith could be invisible man, hag could be creature from the black lagoon, plague could be a mummy, etc.
---
Mag is my favorite killer
---
Well it sunlocked for all other characters but you still have to get it through the bloodweb.
---
Thanks !
---
Shoulda made a Sylvester and Tweety moment and had kitty coughing out the feather...
---
Are you PC or Console? :o
---
I think cool down is that fatigue you get when you get out of frenzy? I could be wrong
---
good question ig it just depends on the situation üòÇ
---
Even worse...when your Girlfriend drops a Firecracker in,front of you as you run to the exit gates...with the Killer behind you and you run into a wall and the Killer kills you on hook... True fucking story.
---
I was injured, jus off hook and the,Killer was tunnelling me because I,looped em half the match...I tell my GF on coms,to body block behind me and I'll escape (she opened the Exit Gates and ran towards me)....she yells excitedly "Take this Killer!"  And drops Firecrackers and blinda me..
---
..
---
I purchase all killers day 1.  I haven't seen a splinter in god knows how long.
---
I think head on can honestly delay some scenarios but I do not think it is a crutch perk. I mean head on or dead hard which is a crutch?
---
Upvote for name. (also BE buff trapper please)
---
I'm pretty sure they only go away if you have the chapter, might be wrong
---
#YUM YUM
---
Sure then. I‚Äôll do it.
---
Na, they always nerf the fun bugs just like space pallets and the exploding huntress hatchets
---
They‚Äôre incorrect.
---
The Tome and the challenges are permanent. The only time sensitive part of the tome itself is the rift currency you get from the challenges that give you rift currency. 
---
You can complete the tome whenever you want. The lore, challenges, and blood point rewards are permanent.
---
Blocking people doesn‚Äôt prevent you from playing with them. Everyone who wants to avoid him would have to remember his name and check recent players in every lobby to dodge.
---
i dont have reddit
---
We don't know, yet, but I believe it's alluded to that he's still avoiding the entity somehow. The main character of last year's events was found by the entity, however, and we don't know what has happened to him yet. Becoming a killer known as the alchemist would be very fitting of the story told last Halloween.
---
Did they patch the heelys glitch? I love that one
---
There's always that ONE ACE running Plunderer/Ace in the Hole around the whole map, giving out keys like it's a free weekend
---
I was in a match where someone managed to actually get a flashlight save.. out of my hundreds and hundreds of games it was my first time seeing it happen! What a chad
---
I just listen to Mr. Blue Sky when I play ghost face
---
WHERE IS THE HUNGER?
---
Why is understanding RNG so hard?
---
Well it‚Äôs bannable, so our opinions don‚Äôt really matter. As far as the devs are concerned, it‚Äôs scummy.
---
Imaging making a killer and your in charge of the naming so you call peenywise ‚Äúthe it‚Äù
---
Using the tombstone on a tea-bagger. Or, back in the day when we had to deal with pre-nerf DS, using the Tombstone on the guy with DS.
---
This happened all the time when I was at rank 5 last season. Idk why every became a potato all of a sudden.
---
It's always fun to see somebody get off their high horse for a short and biased rant with us little people. Make sure you don't break your chipped shoulder climbing back up, okay?
---
I agree. My group of 3 got 4 out of 5 gems done even with it but died in the end.
---
Yo.... Steve lookin kinda thiccc though. Those are some very cute puppers.
---
Source???
---
Honestly i just go fuck it and sprint, my teamate probably is in a chase already if the killer hasn't found me and i save time instead of blendetting around
---
They already have. DS exists. Killers can derank from being too close to the hook too often. Unbreakable exists for slugging. BT does not mean jackshit, as it buys you a lot of time to get to a loop. The killer is just wasting his time at that point by making dumb decisions.
---
play basement bubba agitation, iron grasp, and infectious fright. you will get a lot more salt and less teabags even if you only get a 2k people are just pissed you camped their friend cause they are 4 man swf :)
---
A man of quality
---
hehe I saw somebody named as that
---
U must be the only survivor that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt spawn right on it
---
Alternatively from the killer
---
"Sure hope I don't run into the demon that hides in the lockers..."
---
Oh no baby dweet is evolving
---
Fookin prayer beads, so op, bhvr has to nerf it
---
