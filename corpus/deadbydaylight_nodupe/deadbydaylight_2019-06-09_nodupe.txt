From now on I’m a window repairman billy main
---
---
---
Bubba. He took my friends all down in the basement. :(
---
Ik, the memes that I've made I've done the same
---
I’m not disagreeing and saying that they have a slight advantage. But that goes the same way for survivors then. Since you want a blood point boost for playing against swf why can’t survivors get a hint about what killer they are playing before the match starts? EVERYTIME
---
Huntress is not sexy with thos hairy legs
---
the weird thing is that other people were siding up with him, like I don’t know what’s shady about watermarking a meme I made
---
Ramping in dbd is where a hillbilly use a slope or something of the sort to reach areas he wouldn't be able to get to. For example billy can ramp up the side of a hill to get on top of it instead of walking up it like usual. This can be use to catch survivors that are on top a hill off guard or to get on top a loop and other things. If you want to see examples of this look up "RO - dbd billy" on youtube.
---
This happened to me last night
---
Daddy bing bong*
---
Oinko
---
Yeah early when the argument started I was getting upvotes but I guess they realized it was him and that's when the hivemind started
---
Adrenaline is good, Lithe/Balance Landing/Dead Hard are good too, Object of Obsession is perfect if you want to be toxic and you are good at looping, Distortion is good if you aren't good at looping and you want to avoid BBQ or other aura reading perks.
---
Nah I got 4 colorblind friends and they all say they're eye disabled, for memes and for free stuff
---
yeah you got downvoted badly just because of people who think he’s right because he’s like some sort of meme-god
---
Wmi?
---
Sorry.
---

---
Meant to say: Season 1 of Konosuba.
---
The same thing might happen to you, we're the ones being polite as well, no curse words from us or anything
---
To all killer mains i've teabagged at pallets. I'm sorry, the game wouldn't be as fun without you killers and I hope we can hug eachother a bit more in the future
---
Best regards
---
/Survivor main
---
We'll make it.
---
Was joking about an unhook build
---
I can hear the humming.
---
I guess it’s best to just leave this alone, thanks for sticking up for me dude, you’re a legend
---
Yeah np, you're the one that's doing nothing wrong
---
I see wasn’t sure haha don’t think I’ve ever used wglf or wmi hah
---
Except they’re not at a huge disadvantage, there’s plenty of perks to even the playing field, playing without perks is definitely a huge disadvantage though. Same with killers, but killers can’t do anything about SWF communication to make it even.
---
Is it like the final two episodes?
---
Got my vote! Draw up the clown from American Horror story that’s what we need!
---
Really? That’s dumb as hell
---
Ooo, I’m honestly a killer main too. 
---
The only time I play survivor is if I’m playing with a friend otherwise it can get really annoying playing solo. 
---
Trapper is my favorite to play as because, I agree, it’s extremely satisfying when they stumble into your traps. 
---
He’s my highest lvl killer with Michael coming in second. I used to main Billy &amp; The Huntress when I first started playing. Huntress can be rewarding especially when you get a hit with a thrown axe. 
---
Wraith genuinely scares me too because of his invisibility. NGL I try my hardest to avoid him when playing in a match against him, idc what kind of BP I’m missing out on.
---
Huntress is in a pretty decent spot. I wouldn’t want the devs to buff her until they fix hit boxes.
---
3rd grade writing level btw
---
Dude I get so many games as killer where 4 SWFs are running MoM, DS, DH, Adrenaline, or BT. (Those five perks are the only ones I see ever and I'm a rank 11/10 killer. Add to that, it's not enough they have that shit, they also live to bodyblock me to protect the unhooker going for a save, bodyblock the person who got unhooked despite having BT on, and bodyblock me through any loops. THEN, after that, they teabag like they're hot shit. THEN, they send me messages wherr they trash talk: "ggez, git gud, trash killer, nice tunneling, etc." I'm on xbox so you know they're toxic because without a keyboard, it takes a damn long time to type of that hate mail. Fuck these perks and the people who run them.
---
I swear I get NAT problems so freaking often. AMD Relive has a timer on it and I spend a 5 minute in actual lobbies but 15-20 loading, waiting, crashing, restarting
---
So many good killer cosmetic concepts! I would love this, or I hope we can get a new hag outfit.
---
Yea you will be Amanda for the next game.
---
*Pretty good job so far intensifies*
---
We do not have a totem counter try again, it needs to be universal not exclusive to one survivor. And killers can tell if you’re running object of obsession so yes they can tell. And ds or mom you can narrow it down to one of those just by someone’s play style. And what do you mean you don’t have to control what other survivors do? So one person should be responsible for all 5 gens and totems?
---
No one word can mean all those things. You young'ins are playing God with vocabulary and you will regret it.
---
Well they cant all be amazing and I can totally see immersed players using it
---
Killers: 
---
Friend- Freddy, Kill- Doctor, Marry- Michael or the Trapper 
---
Survivors:
---
Friend- Feng Min, Kill- Dwight, Marry- Kate.
---
Honestly, as someone who plays both sides. Noed  gives you the fear to get the [Bad Word Insert Here] out of the game. Noed has counter play. Cleansing all dull totems before all gens are done will completely nullify noed.
---
[deleted]
---
Cringe oink?
---
Maybe it’s unpopular but I agree with your suggestion. It’s better than adding a separate casual mode which would fragment the playerbase.
---
BHVR could make it so at the end of a match the killer gets bonus xp based on the highest number of survivors that were in a SWF.
---
x1.1 for 2, x1.15 for 3, x1.2 for 4 (just an example)
---
Hello my patient. Here's what you need. 
---
Overcharge
---
Unnerving Presence 
---
Distressing 
---
And whatever you choose. (Bbq or ruin for me)
---
Now the main set you will need is these addons. 
---
Stack calm series (usually yellow and grey)
---
Or if you have both use a purple calm and a purple discipline. It says the effects wont stack but it will stack your terror radius. If you wanna play for fun use purple calm and iridescent king. 
---
Your best maps are small maps usually game or institute. (Dont waste such maps if you're not using the purple strategy.) 
---
Here's what you do. Your terror radius is now massive. Switch to treatment as soon as game starts and patrol gens. Before you get to the first guaranteed you'll have at least one survivor scream. A game against doctor is a game of speed as he eliminates stealth. Your shock should be held for stuns. Yes it stuns. They jumping a window or unhooking? Hit em with a shock before hand and they are unable to do anything, even drop pallets. Your main ability is your static field. That causes screams and gives locations. Oh wait they have calm heart. They are still gaining madness which allows you to see illusionary versions of your self. You see one, immediately rush towards it. You want to shock people to hit madness two so you can see these illusions. Hook and repeat. Unnerving works well because it helps when you're searching as any survivor has smaller skill checks including with overcharge and decisive strike. Look at killer perks to see what you want as your forth slot.
---
And as a doctor I make that good money, blood points. You'll see why especially if you have bbq. 
---
Now be off, your visit is over and hopefully this has done you some good.
---
[Yeah he clearly doesn’t know. It’s kinda crazy they can just use his likeness without him even knowing.](https://youtu.be/JraX5iymwnE)
---
Damn this looks really nice. Great moves, keep it up, proud of you ;D
---
I mean lorewise from his add-ons its clear he lives for the thrill of nearly getting caught I mean he keeps a picture of his first victim in his wallet.
---
There’s a lot of regretful things generations have done
---
[removed]
---
No perks though.
---
Let's you play and see if you would buy the character.
---
Yissss
---
Bunny feng WHEN??????
---
Have you played Legion? The lunge is longer. Read the old Legion power. It must have been changed with rework.
---
For me, it's ALWAYS like this. Even third seal is usually gone pretty much instantly. 
---
Only Hex perks I use nowadays are NOED (Odds are low all 5 totems are cleansed) and Haunted Grounds (Weaponize the shitty totem spawns.)
---
Sometimes I even use Thrill Of The Hunt by itself. Doesn't slow the game down directly like Ruin but I feel like I get more effect because Survivors get this urge to search for "The other Hex he has to be running." and they waste their time (+ slower totem cleansing eats more time, and once the Hex warning goes out after TOTH is gone survivors get real tense because "The other perk must still be out there, he probably has Devour Hope go find it" and I can watch the tokens of TOTH count down with glee because survivors are wasting their time cleansing every dull totem they find.
---
Probably a dweet
---
BHVR is a smaller dev team is what people dont realize. They arent massive.
---
So I’ve recently gotten a gaming pc and I had like over 200 hours on PS4 DBD and so I bought the game and just love how much smoother the game is on pc. It also has opened the opportunity to share my love for the game with one of my best friends :). I bought the game for him and he’s already gotten 50+ hours in the first week of owning the game. We usually play together or he streams his gameplay to me over discord and I teach him how to play and such and it’s been one of the most awesome experiences I’ve ever had to see a friend love the game as much as me. I actually got my gaming pc from another friend who built it for me completely free because I’ve had some rough life stuff going on (that includes buying the parts). If I do happen to win this by some odd chance I’d love to give the copy of the game to that friend considering I’ve been asking him to try the game so I can share my love of the game with more friends. Hopefully one day I can have full kyf lobbies of just friends I’ve introduced to the game :))
---
Sounds like quite the trial, I would've been super impressed as killer, maybe a little pissed too lol
---
Maybe he escaped with it and forgot to take it off
---
Needs more sprint burst.
---
Solid work!
---
I really like the mask, it looks very well done. Not trying to downplay the costume, but If you own a hoodie, trade that out for the leather jacket
---

Pretty awesome! Don't respond to the morons who will inevitably come in and say stupid shit like "der, come back in 50 years and tell us you don't regret this" or "der why would you do that to yourself, tattoos are permanent you know?" I blocked a shit ton of idiots who just don't understand reasoning behind tattoos.
---
&gt; I’m not saying I don’t heal I’m just saying it’s annoying af when your teammates expect you to heal them all the time 
---
Ok, helping your teammates and being altruistic is annoying? Gotcha.
---
&gt; and it’s a waste of time to go around the map looking for someone to heal you
---
That’s a different issue.
---
&gt; If someone is downed and the killer leaves them would you wanna run up and have to heal them the whole way or have them recovered so it doesn’t take as long? Same logic also applies, get a head start healing and when you find another survivor/they find you then they can finish the rest.
---
 
---
That’s a really stupid analogy. Do you need a perk to recover yourself? And what is needed for you to finish a recovery and stand up?
---
&gt;  Or how about if someone else is healing you and then the killer starts chasing them and you’re on your own?
---
You do a gen to try and get adrenaline popped
---
Is Sprint Burst better than Dead Hard? And can you suggest 2 other perks?
---
You've created a monster.
---
"Slight" advantage my ass. At purple ranks and above this is a killer death sentence.
---
I just wanted to know what I had done to incur his bloodlust, but alas, he left instantly...
---
Speaking of Fog whisperers, they need to be held to the **highest** standards, as they are the most direct representation of the community in the eyes of the devs. Without judgement, that's why the whole controversy over Jendenise's de-pipping and *encouraging* this remains relevant. Like it or not, she did guide a lot of people in the wrong directions just based on something she decided to say and do. That's the perfect example of how something like what Cows did could go and has gone horribly wrong.
---
Or when there's a pallet next to the lockers in the ground floor of Coal Tower...
---
I'm dying. That's what I picture though after he insta downs me about 3 or 4 times
---
I mean, I don't really care. I've got this &amp; an Animal Crossing tattoo recently. Both mean something to me; my favorite franchise &amp; my favorite film! I'll feel the same way I will 21 more years from now lol.
---
I appreciate the kind words though! Mikey's currently doing some hardcore peeling so oof.
---
Thanks c: whipped it up in like 10 minutes? Was just going for a minimal-ish cartoony look. Ordered my Halloween stuff earlier today (way fucking early as a whole) and figured "Why not?" lmao
---
I like the idea, but instead I personally think the added “Perks” are completely new and unique. Also, I everyone had ds, most killers would probably commit die
---
Oinks in pallet stun noise*
---
where would you put plague on this list?
---
I learned about this game from a youtuber, it looked fun so I  got it on xbox. Games are fun but the potatoes when I play survivor are no fun (rank 13 or 14), and the toxic SWFs with MoM, DS, DH, Adrenaline when I play killer are even worse (rank 10 or 11). I hear that BHVR cares more about the ping of their PC players and the playerbase is larger so yeah.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I didn't care either, but some people who try EXTREMELY hard to troll or push their stupid beliefs on you. Mines peeling too, still a bit swollen too, but healing nicely. Again, that's some good work.
---
*shameless self promotion intensifies*
---
its really not effective as most survivors ignore dull totems, thats why everyone here complains about noed.
---
Modt will just do gens and maybe cleanse the Toth Totem if they stumble over it
---
If you're a mind game kinda killer I heavily suggest spirit, lots of mind game potential and just overall a decent killer if you aren't big in mind games and her perks are pretty good. Ranchor; obsession gets exposed effect when last gen is done and can mori them without them having to be hooked before. Spirit fury: break 4/3/2 pallets and then when it's activated the next time you're stunned with a pallet it breaks (super dirty with enduring). Haunted grounds; 2 totems are randomly selected and when they're broken all survivors receive the exposed effect for 40/50/60 secs (amazing perk to run if you do all/some totem builds). Hope this is helpful
---
Oh yeah, well I had to finish the last two gens by myself, and he escaped (I suppose he was hiding until I got caught, we were the last two), but I got hooked... I was so salty, and I purposely finished the temple gen for the trophy... now no trophy.
---
Had to play it mgs style a lot.
---
If you feel bad about tunneling off hook or don't want to eat a decisive, just body slam the unhooked person and chase the rescuer.
---
Now I want a killer that can throw survivors.
---
Just stand your ground on your own beliefs and keep your cool with em &amp; nothin' matters from there, to be honest. I appreciate it again, though!
---
This happens to me but it's with pallets and healing myself
---
IMHO the icon should light up or blink (maybe even the perk being worked on) and the notification should have a different sound and visual so it is super obvious ***"HEY! SOMEONE'S DESTROYING ONE OF YOUR TOTEMS!"***
---
Spies From The Shadows actually has unique crow shaped notifications and sounds so you know it's from SFTS.
---
The "Alarm" hex totem? Generic explosion thing. Same as a fast vault/locker/chest/pallet/whatever, blown gen, sabo'd hook, etc. 
---
It NEEDS to be distinct. I know you can check and see if the notification is coming from the totem but good luck doing that if you're something like Anti-SkillCheck Doctor and there's screams, gen explosions/other failed skill checks, etc. all going off around you. The actual TOTH notification ends up getting lost in all the chaos because it's no different from any other notification.
---
Well originally I was going to post.... Damn, that's a solid "sketch" because I assumed you were super talented and got it done fairly quickly but I didn't want you to be like "yeah took me 3 hours to get the shading right" and then I look like a dick haha. For real though, awesome.
---
Neat idea, although I feel like he’d just be an M1 killer against the other 2 survivors not in a trance
---
Nobody specified what rank now did they? You’re acting like every swf are filled with sweaty try hards
---
Wow, hard to tell if you are a troll or just dumb. Watch their official video.  The. Killer. Can. Open. it.At. Any. Time. That. Is. The.Entire.Point.Of.It.
---
It's a gamble either way.  Totems always are.  You never know how people are going to treat them, when they're gonna cleanse them, or in what order, if they manage to find them.  Best you can do is experiment with it and see if it stalls them any.  
---
Personally, I don't bother with them anymore unless they have ruin or I suspect noed or devour hope.
---
Looks good, mate.
---
I looked for over an hour on pintrest, tumblr, deviantart, or anywhere this image was linked but I could never find the original artist which is a shame
---
Lol it spawned literally right under you , and the hatch didn't spawn until you moved  .
---
That’s not Ghostface. That’s Shannen Doherty.
---
Pants..? If there's bunny ears there needs to be a bunny tail XD =P
---
And I’m sorry some survivors are good at this game and make bad killers look bad?
---
I know it was amazing hahaha.
---
?
---
nice
---
Tuesday!
---
I really like Play with Your Food. It's not great but I love running around like an idiot. For survivors, it would have to be Autodidact. I run it with empathy + were gonna make it and spend the first few minutes getting the shitty part out of the way and become an ambulance.
---
*I GOT A COMPLICATED ORDER.*
---
Maybe they can allow us to remove gens so the killer is guaranteed a 4k. Can't leave if we can't power the doors lmao
---
This makes him best designed killer.
---
Like I always say when I see this post: because they work.
---
As a Tapp main, I can assure you that he does not come with a totem counter. He has Detective's Hunch, which shows the auras of gens, chests and totems if and ONLY if he is the one to out the finishing touches on a single gen. He can also use Small Game, as well as any other character, to give a *very rough estimate* (within a 45° cone) of the location of bear traps, hexes and totems. Both of these are things that only benefit the person who uses them since yku can't show others the aura or have an actual totem counter.
---
I'm not really making a case to be agreed with, I gave my opinion and that's it lmao
---
Well I play survivor probably 80% of the time. I just find it more fun.
---
It looks great! I love the little details
---
I wonder how are they going to sell this DLC. I wonder if they will get the fix in time.
---
Could be an input lag thing, I've experienced that before. You press the button and nothing happens, then you release and hit it again....by the time you release it starts to recognize the first input and it ends up with the look of a start action + cancel. If he's playing on a TV or for whatever reason has high input lag, that could be the culprit. A bigger question is if he experiences the same thing with a mouse/keyboard and on other actions. If someone is having a problem that thousands of other people aren't; you have to look at local factors.
---
Haha !!!!!
---
Oh shit, I'm so sorry but I don't think even you care about the rank 20 to 15 survivors/killers who don't have any perks or know what they're doing. So shut the fuck up about "not mentioning rank." The only ranks that matter are 10 and up since they usually have access to most of the perks and have any experience. And yes, I've literally only played games against toxic, god-loop abusing, MoM/DS/Adrenaline/BT abusing, SWFs. So i don't know any other kind of SWFs because the ones I get who are casual, are so bad that they play like solo survivors.
---
I use NOED when i'm learning a new killer. I love to see salt when they bully me.
---
Haha !!!
---
I think my next step is to do the skirt and booties from the concept art
---
But he was wanting you to try his momma's chili
---
How is bloodlust stupid?
---
Thank you!
---
I think a lot of people would be happier with increased bloodpoint/shard gains from being higher ranked. This sort of system would make playing higher ranks even more painful than it already is for me.
---
Dang alright. No name on the tag? It's okay. Looks really good lol 😁
---
Kindred Spirits
---
Probably shouldn’t have posted if you cannot find the original artist
---
Inaccurate information, when I am aware the killer is Myers my nose is also plunged into agonizing pain.
---
I'll be sure to look it over when I get home after Day 2 at the con!
---
I read this in a bandits voice from borderlands.
---
It takes skill to use the one Laurie aura reveal perk without getting f’d over because of it.
---
If you gain weight he will be burger king myres
---
Bing bong~
---
Yup totally a joke. I didn't mean to say that.
---
if you get a killer to chase you for a while they seem to get really salty and tunnel you. I notice when I waste more of a killers time being chased or a friend does it we get tunneled and camped but other teammates who go down quickly they will ignore them in favor of the good runner in the game.
---
Decisive strike is annoying, then again I sometimes run NOED so I can't really be talking
---
So I look like and have her move?
---
Try playing nurse without it lol.
---
Basically this, when I first level a killer, noed is a great crutch until I get good perks, but then I get good perks.. I don't use it after that, I love me some of that perk where you can expose them or even kill them after they save someone from a hook so many times, after being far away enough, I use it all the time and forgot the damn name lol, they usually don't even know  I have a hex until it's too late, or the game gives me a dumb spawn.
---
Thanks! And essentially yeah but not every killer has to have chase altering abilities to be effective the doctor being an example his shocking does nothing to close the gap in a chase. I do get what you're saying though and I'll have to think about that for next time.
---
No Mither/Pharmacy/Self Care/Solidarity = 3000 IQ build.
---
I would legitimately kill for a girlfriend who looks like night out Nea
---
Dude i did this in like 15 mins waiting for people to get home with groceries lol. I can doodle familiar things fairly quickly, but linework and coloring gets messy (obviously)
---
I appreciate it lots though, thank you! ♡
---
A lot of the time the game displays the pips incorrectly when you are looking at certain aspects of the UI. I'm guessing you simply aren't pipping each game.
---
The guy is a chomo so I don't think it'll happen, nor would I want it to, there's plenty of other well known killers tbh
---
oh god oh fuck
---
He literally says "I'm a terrible liar" directly before telling an outright lie that is demonstrably false.
---
[Samination](https://www.youtube.com/user/ebolaworld) popularised it in his parody videos or at least that's where I heard it from first.
---
Then helped drive the joke into the ground.
---
No she literally does not, I don't know where this meme came from, she's an INDEPENDENT STRONG WOMAN, smh. She kills platoons of soldiers
---
I like the idea though! I have a few killer concepts of my own, if you want to draw some ideas just go to my profile, I have a couple
---
Why did you hit them then lol
---
🗿
---
You seem like a pretty angry person. Are you sure it's the survivors problem and not the fact that you're a rage-filled man baby
---
Making a stealth killer silent and sneaky &lt; making a stealth killer with multiple notification sounds with loud ass footsteps, leather sounds, wooshing cape sounds, and with loud breathing
---
What's with the weird colored perks? I see them on flashlights too
---
I’m so sorry you’re a toxic self entitled son of a bitch who thinks everything needs to be handed to them. No ranks matter in this game jackass the ranks mean nothing just like you. I don’t care what rank you are, you aren’t any better of a person than a rank 20 fresh outta the box nea. So you can take your self entitled I’m the best and all that matters.  I love how you say people are toxic because they are using PERKS put  in the game for a reason to good use. And it’s not their fault they loop you it’s not abuse it’s called staying alive I’m sorry they don’t stand still and let you get a 4k like you want. And btw the ones that are casual don’t give a shit how the match goes because unlike you this game isn’t their whole life.
---
Spies From The Shadows has crow shaped notifications and sounds for the notifications.
---
TOTH absolutely needs unique notifications. I'm a doctor main and if I'm running Anti-Skillcheck it is IMPOSSIBLE to read the notifications because there's screams, gen explosions, etc. all around me and you'll never be able to make out which one is a TOTH cleanse warning.
---
Cool thanks! I have another idea I posted the other day if you wanted to look at that for yourself as well
---
Honestly wasn’t paying attention to the endgame timer
---
Today on things I really wish I didn’t read:
---
#THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE
---
What's that say in fronch
---
The game already has a problem with people abusing the hatch mechanic by exploiting it open with a dc, you really think this won't be exploited and abused?
---
r/awkwardboners
---
That hatchet is like half your height
---
That shouldn’t worry you, when it’s a wraith and you don’t hear the bell is when you should be afraid
---
Then legs go all the way up boi?
---
How could you pass on alla that ass?
---
'WHERE'S THAT GODDAMN HEX TOTEM?!'
---
What's this from?
---
That’s just the doctor maddening him
---
Getting the survivors to trust you and then killing them all is probably the most evil thing you can do in this game, do it
---
*Survivors can be hooked repeatedly but won't die. Moris are disabled. 
---
*Survivors have to finish all 7 generators before the gates are powered.
---
*All BP catagories must be filled for both sides before the gates can be opened, or Survivors can be killed.
---
*Survivors who were hooked 3+ times will automatically get sacrificed upon maxing out BP for all players.
---
https://ecstaticasusual.tumblr.com/post/152600332325/obsession I believe this is the artist. It took me less than two minutes and a reverse image search.
---
He's real edgy in the reboot. He makes jokes tho, but they're just mean.
---
Freddy I think is scarier in this movie. A few good lines. People can hate the movie because the actors and writing weren't great, the actor who played Freddy did a good job with what he had.
---
I run NOED when I’m doing an endgame build or when leveling a new killer and it’s the only good perk I have, or I’m trying to play Nurse (on PS4).
---
I literally just opened doors in two different games after the hatch got closed. Nothing is impossible
---
*laughs in mori*
---
one of these things is not like the other, one of these things just doesn't belong
---
When you reach lvl  30,35 and 40 you get the teachables. but remember that when you unlock them it only means they can appear on other's killers bloodwebs, telling you this because some people think they get them for all killers instantly. Also you can buy them in the shrine of secrets for some shards (the ones that you get by playing the game, not the ones you buy with real money (auric cells))
---
BTW if you are still starting I suggest you don't unlock useless perks, like the huntress' so they don't appear in bloodwebs.
---
Honestly I never played it, I played Skyrim for the first time when it was put into ps4. I imagine the devs of dbd will do their Best, but we will see how that turns out :)
---
That happens when you apply it directly to the forehead.
---
Get the game. Wait for survivors to work on the gen in the bathroom, stand at the door and shock them until they dc.
---
That’s fantastic, I use distortion and hate when other survivors are near me and bbq shows the killer where I am
---
Jigsaw
---
Yea I’d feel bad if I got a 20k wraith ritual too
---
Ill be honest, i havent touched sprint burst after the exhaustion nerf patch, because BL became the better perk. Its more useful in nuetral game with its 75% reduction, and it has built in sprint burst, where you can choose to use it whenever you can/want too.
---
This guy gets it
---
Plague was more Chaotic Good. Yes, she really wanted to help, but she also let pride and ego override what she knew was really right. Also, it's implied the Entity is making her believe he is one of her gods and manipulating her faith and desire for healing to make her do the whole killer routine.
---
You know there are three parts to a friendship...sharing, caring, and SPECIAL TEAMS
---
Randy &gt; Sidney
---
...or you know just play the game  :-/
---
But can we say 'heck'?
---
Go to prison, say your selling shanks for cigs, get cigs, stab them. They paid for a shank.
---
True, but I would be less annoyed if I were to start missing hits I should miss and started landing hits I shouldn't miss. Even if in the end I hit less often.
---
It would also take out more frustration survivors have when getting hit when they shouldn't have. Might take out a small vial if toxins in the toxic DBD ocean.
---
Some games the killer is a potato, nothing IS impossible!
---
I think what makes it pretty threatening and disturbing is a lot of the killers seem to sort of hate their job in a way. Maybe Myers enjoys it, but Clown is clearly the only one who is having a fucking whale of a time brutalizing helpless survivors.
---
Yeah I’d be careful with that. Before, it used to be done a whole lot by bots and they set up measures to detect and ban these players that do this. Not sure if it’s still running but better safe than sorry
---
you can use pharmacy to heal others. replace it with MoM. you can't activate it cuz no one'll slug a No Mither and it's hard to block the 4th hit when the 3rd is your death hook
---
t h i c c
---
It’s a perk pack that a lot of people download
---
I unlocked every perk and got them all on my Claudette, but atleast I’m not toxic so i don’t use all the OP annoying perks
---
I actually had a Trapper doing this (AFK just hitting the air) a few weeks ago. I was shocked because I thought "These guys were taken care of" a LONG time ago.
---
Earlier today I saw a guy reading and unreading in a lobby on and off for like 30 minutes (Bot and maybe the user was checking in on it?) before whoever was running it dodged because we had one of those "Cursed Lobbies" where no matter what only 3 people are in it. Likely was also a bot and the guy at the PC gave up after a while.
---
No mither adrenaline self care solidarity is an OP meta perk build
---
&gt;booties
---
Have anymore of them pixels?
---
I actually wish there were more Hex perks that played off dull totems.  NOED is okay, but does nothing for the start and mid games.  
---
The problem I foresee with having more perks like that though is that it would essentially create two long term objectives: gens and totems.  This may end up stalling out the game far too long, which would be too much in the killers favor.
---
Won’t be anyone from the movies unfortunately:(

His power would be to literally just be able to fly across the map for a short burst.
---
But why
---
Fucking kiddies\*
---
If survivors are rushing the hook, you'd be stupid NOT to camp. And if it's preventing them from doing gens, then that's exactly what you want, that's a valid and effective tactic.
---
Good survivors won't rush the hook, they'll keep pressure on you by doing gens. With that tactic, the worst case scenario for them is that one guy dies but they get all their gens done. If they rush the hook, worst case scenario is that one guy dies anyways and then they don't have any other work to show for it, putting them at further risk of being hooked and camped to death.
---
Don't listen to the hate my dude, keep camping on those hook rushers.
---
Guarding is annoying, yes. But at the end of the day, it’s just a game. We aren’t kids. It’s a strategy /tactic of the game. It’s annoying. Neutral in effectiveness. The game lets you do it. It’s a game. Everybody should be (working together when applicable) and (playing to win) and over all having fun and just enjoy the game. Yes when the killer guards, it’s not.. fun... but sometimes people need to grow up and be mature and stop telling others to kill themself and such (because nowadays you can be reported by police for it and the gov does take it more seriously). Maybe the ones acting toxic by telling strangers only to kill themselves should be the ones playing a diff game or play nothing at all because we don’t need THAT type of behavior. I’d rather people guard than communicate in a toxic way
---
Yea
---
By using scratch marks or is something more effective? Because most of the time they heal right after they run.
---
then it would be impossible for the survivors to get out by it?
---
I got some hatemail earlier from somebody telling me not to play the game if I was just gonna camp. He was on hook and his 3 teammates were literally all right there trying to get him off of it. Like what do people expect me to do just run away so they can get him? I say if it’s working for you do it. Their fault for not working gens instead.
---
Did you mess up your hands and stuff too? Nice attention to detail.
---
Nah bro
---
he prob was playing killer and someone found the hatch before him
---
Insanity
---
for me as killer I love when survivors go for hooks right away it means more points for me and the closer to death they are
---
Aw hell naw
---
Agreed. For some reason this game seems to breed toxicity through an us vs them mentality. When it comes down to it we’re all just sitting here playing a video game chill out
---
doing it for the memes or random perk wheel
---
bold of you to assume we look for fountains in the first place
---
That looks awesome!
---
I think it's referencing when killers hit the window trying to hit you

lol yeah it was tunneling. Cuz he's a miner. Who tunnels. Rocks. A miner.

Am I the only one that thinks nea is actually pretty cute? I really like her urban style

Wait shit right

"EVEYONE ELSE IS A NAIL"

TAKE ANOTHER FUCKING SMOKING SPLINTER
---
You could try bloodhound, makes blood really easy to track and works well with sloppy butcher which also slows healing. 
---
Nurses call will show auras of anyone healing in a radius around you as well. Theres a couple of options.
---
Honestly i ship Wraith and Pig
---
Did he get lagspiked?
---
i stopped using NOED cause they never finish doing the 5 gens.

Wrong, Sidney is literally THE ultimate final girl next to Laurie.

Nice

Y’all

Ah yes the "not only am I an idiot, but I am willing to fuck my team too" survivor type.

Always worth the report.

Momma Pig always makes sure her kids are safe at the playground, wearing helmets when operating heavy machinery!

goo goo gaga

I would love to be in rank 10 as killer all the time

Thought that said Pig ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
#MakeVigilGreatAgain
---
Some killers dodge for the slightest things. It used to be far worse when killers saw survivor ranks, 2 or more purple/red ranks in your lobby? NEXT!
---
I love this game! My friend does like it too, but he has no money to buy it. I would give it to him If I could win. #HypeForFreddyRework
---
My friend when hes the first to die on hook so he just starts telling me how to play. Like dude, shut up, then he gets cranky.
---
My friend's a Nea main and literally whenever we show him "Nea's a Killer" jokes he immediately replies with "BOI HAVE YOU SEEN FENG?!"
---
Odd considering funworld differentiates him from his movie counterpart with their robe. Scream Ghostface has like, three ribbons that hang off, drawstrings at the base of the hood, and a sparkly robe.
---
Funworld however, its just black with spikey drapes on the sleeves, no hoodie drawstrings, and a jet black color, no sparkle to it.
---
 BHVR said they wanted to focus on the mask so they can create their own character behind it, which is probably the primary reason behind it. He's not just some Ghostface, he's their own OC.
---
Also when there’s a gen in the killer shack
---
But also teabags. BM value~
---
Getting seen means someone's in 32 meters of you :^)
---
but isn't that already done with the doctor
---
I mean Freddy Krueger was in MK9
---
Yeah
---
Thanks Dwight main, very cool
---
thanks! i didn't even think of that tbh, i would've looked cool 🤔
---
Getting survivors like that who save instantly is annoying but in the end just hurts the whole team meaning less time for generators and more hooks for you. Using a killer who instant downs full health survivors or perks like devour hope or make your choice are some counters. Also about the people who feel the need to message you to kill yourself just report them and ignore them. If your a console player playstation takes those messages seriously and will ban them for inappropriate messages. I know from experience.
---
With communication it's a fair counter
---
Without it it's blind luck
---
thankyou!!
---
 You’re just wrong lol. Like I get what your saying but survivor is easier because you are facing against 1 person but killer is 4.
---
 Favorites: Michael, because he actually makes the game scary when you're minding your own business and just see him in the distance. Clown because I play clown myself, and you don't see him very often.
---
Huntress is annoying, if only for the long distance injuries and knockdowns.  Hag and anyone else running Ruin SUCKS.
---
Extremely, imagine taking a game that serious? There’s even more messages too, apparently I’m getting banned on PSN so we’ll see 😂
---
Just for the colors or?
---
I read that about 20 times and it still doesn't make sense.
---
I assume you meant because they vaulted a pallet
---
I like it makes him look unique , they should lean into and give him some dreamwalker adrenaline junky skins.

Came here for this. SFTS seems so underrated.
---
It is the best exhaustion perk in the game, but it is highly situational most of the time.
---
You’re evil lol
---
Well theoretically a killer has four people to sacrifice, but what constitutes as a victory for the killer?

I dunno. I suck at drawing anything lol

I’m sure you’re not a fan of Huntress either
---
BL is the only exhaustion perk that has two abilities in one, short stagger time and speed when landing. Surprised it is only rare at lvl 3
---
Hey uh listen, good effort but you're not even close honestly. She has a striped blazer and a gray/white collared shirt? and nothing on her wrist. Kinda cool though if this was just your fit for the day and an accidentally cosplay.
---
Is this a digital or physical painting? If digital you could always take it back into your program and make a second version with the blood. Nice work btw!
---
He even laughs when getting stunned. Doctor does too, but in a different way. He has a sadistic laugh, like it's the pain that he enjoys, but the Clown is living it up in every part of the trial. No wonder his lungs are so bad...he's been chasing around survivors every second he could for DECADES, maybe even centuries of in-Entity time.
---
(and also because of literally everything else but yeah you know)
---
I do love that nurse has a skin that tells the world how toxic you will be as her
---
hoping you don’t proxy camp !
---
I think that totems need a rework in general which could help balance NOED.  Currently the only reason to cleanse dull totems (other than BP) is if the killer has NOED or TotH.  It seems really dumb as a side objective if it is legitimately only relevant if the killer has one of these two perks out of the 57 currently available.
---
?? They only added bloodlust because of looping, and since pallets in maps are getting a big change then....bloodlust should be removed. They can already *easily* catch up with survivors with their base movement speed.
---
A herethicc you say?
---
you can take a look at it on the forums [right here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/67624/sophisticated-librarian-adam-francis-by-mr-chub-chub#latest)
---
What does this mean? 
---
I assume aesthetically rather than balance reasons?
---
Where did you get the icons?
---
Freddy fucked and murdered children.
---
Problem is he only walks in lore and presumably not 4.6m/s
---
Just look at her insidious camping
---
What a happy boi.
---
Is this Loss? 🤔🤔
---
I love Auto haven, it's so much better than the newer maps.
---
Looping doesnt need pallets
---
No. Just no. This isn’t a debate on what is considered a victory. A killer has to manage 4 individual survivors. There is no theoretically.
---
Seriously one downvote ? Oh it’s gone it’s now one upvote higher
---
Perk is you cannot touch another player or you slow down 25% if you go 20 seconds without touching you speed up 25%
---
Am i the only one who prefers default icons
---
O what, no no no yours is a lot funnier lol
---
Noobs once upon a toxic is him making fun of himself tho,
---
Also, 
---
survivors: literally fucking spawns in game

So if I wanted BBQ and Chili for the Pig I would need to get the Cannibal to 35 and then Pig to 35?
---
So if I wanted BBQ and Chili for the Pig I would need to get the Cannibal to 35 and then Pig to 35 and it would show up in the Pig’s bloodweb?
---
Yeah pretty much. Ganeplay wise autohaven is ok just not interested in aesthetic
---
Maps that are usually nice looking in aesthetics are great for survivors so I’ll take the trade off.
---
Try to vault window (usually during a chase). Prompt for locker gets in the way. Dwight pic because Dwight has a thing for lockers.
---
For some reason, it makes my girlfriend motion sick. It's the only stage that does so yeah, I agree -- I'm sick of it too Cx
---
I get that I just mean that they didn't get her likeness but they didnt make Laurie a crack head with wrinkle skin.
---
Those icons are beautiful.
---
What If instead of a door he becomes the god pallet 🤔
---
Freddy is a legit pedo who kills the people that ratted on him
---
Why thank you haha.
---
I'm gonna stop you right there
---
If they ever make killers out of survivors, this guy should be the first candidate. Those are serial killer eyes.
---
Be kinda awkward on lerys, or gideon.
---
So if the devs can determine what constitutes as a victory, I should play the game to their system. However, I shouldn’t use the a perk given by said devs? Sounds like a very skewed interpretation of what started off as having some fun on a video game. 
---
With that being said I think you and I just play differently when it comes to killer. Maybe I like to play for fun and you like to rank up to a point where you’re struggling to compete. Some people are into that and I can respect it. You questioning the validity of my position has brought me to the conclusion that you are in denial that a survivor main is better at killer than you.
---
Sad oink ..
---
He doesn’t look half as terrible with his beanie on imo
---
By which I meant swing the axe into my head and nothing more if that's the case
---
Bros I like the ow reddit way more they at least wait a little before complaining about heroes being op... not the day of their launch
---
It's addictive man, but sometimes you gotta mix it in with a non meta perk
---
Honor code. As a killer I know survivors hate noed so I don’t use it. It’s called respect. Holy shit your second paragraph made me have a stroke. You are saying survivor is easier and that you are better than me when you’ve just *fucking* TOLD ME YOU DON’T RANK UP. *How the hell can you say killer is harder when you play at extremely low ranks?!* You’re way in over your head if you are using experience from high ranks.
---
Ok? We’re talking about a **real life** pedo who raped a 12 year old boy and got off scott free. He also owns the rights so technically BVHR would be paying him to license it.
---
Just recently started playing killer. Is there a reason people go for the melee attack instead of grab?
---
I seriously find it easier to just walk up behind the guy unhooking and press attack, for an insta down.
---
Yet when i'm survivor all i ever see is people just sprinting at hook swinging their weapon. (Cannibal and billy i can understand it.)
---
Yeah I’m red ranks. Maybe you just need to use headphones
---
You've never played with a Killer with good headphones then. 
---
It's all fun and games blinding the Trapper until he just follows you anyway by listening to your footsteps/breathing.
---
I had a similar idea but for legion
---
Not quite. Once you get the cannibal to level 35 and unlock the teachable BBQ it has a chance to spawn in any other killers bloodweb at any level so you might see it on someone else at level one or you might not see it until well past 50 depending on rng.
---
So why did you say you play for fun while I play to rank?! You keep contradicting yourself.
---
I can’t be high rank and have fun?
---
Fu...sion-HA!
---
It's all about killer and survivors getting points together not kills.
---
I think a more fun weapon would be like a sharpened tooth brush or something
---
On maps like the swamp the exit gates are miles apart and can easily be opened if the killer is at the opposite one. People act like when NOED is active they don't have the chance to open a gate and leave. The only time you could debate not opening a gate in time is if it's a windstorm wraith, hillbilly and maybe nurse.
---
Are there people that actually do that flawless thing?
---
Then why did you say I was different at all? If I were focused on pipping I wouldn’t be playing Trapper ffs. You shouldn’t be jumping to conclusions. I have nearly a thousands hours on this game. I wanna say 600-650 were on killer. I know survivor too. You said you didn’t play killer often. You are saying survivor is easier when you don’t play killer often and lie about being in red ranks.
---
"Hey mathieu coté, I'm looking for a job"
---
I’m so fucking happy I got it the day he came out. I can’t imagine doing it now.
---
Hmm well it seems the simplest answer is the killer gets the speed boost to help catch the survivor in an extended. Survivor doesn't because they're meant to be weaker than the killer and the killer is meant to have the advantage. 
---
If survivors want speed boost they have to use perks which even then are conditional and much less frequent.  
---
I'm trying to think of this as a kind of balancing of game mechanics in a general sense, so it's basically in a 1 v 4 pvp game where the 1 needs to catch the 4. And they're making the 1 who can already move faster, gain a slightly more movement speed over time the longer a chase goes so that it becomes increasingly weighted in favor of the 1 over time. 
---
It doesn't sound like a crazy balancing idea to me, maybe it needs more tweaking to find the best balance but it sounds like a good small increase in advantage to help control the flow of the games chases. I just don't get why you say it's generally stupid.
---
I think would be cool to see some survivor perks oriented around a killers bloodlust triggering.
---
Anti-body blocker build: (works well against SWF)

Mad grit

STBFL and MG are the only ones you really need, just be careful of hitting your obsession
---
Well I would say it’s easy, but it’s not fun. Cause you don’t talk to anyone while you play and you can’t listen to music really. You have to focus on chasing and killing people. People who dislike you for playing killer.
---
Since when was Laura Croft in this game
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I MUST HAVE IT
---
Quentin looks like a wax sculpture that was left out in the heat
---
People had some pretty valid complaints about it though. Against m1 killers you were basically handed a free hit (that has some real abuse if you heal to 99% before the killer hits you, you stay at 99% and can top off mid chase after it activates for 2 more hits before you go down) and unless they camped the shit out of you, you got it basically every game. Not to mention all 4 survivors can run it with no penalty to its effectiveness making it incredibly infuriating at times.
---
But wouldnt it be cool to see jeepers creepers? I think it would.
---
I don’t face camp but you bet your ass I’m going to set traps around the shack and watch a door if I have two people hooked in my basement.
---
The current endgame is not enough to stop teabagging.  At least he's nicer about it.  I'd suggest cutting the timer in half.
---
I saw dump “Quick and Quiet” for “Balanced Landing” and replace “Lightweight” with “Spine Chill”
---
I was thinking scarecrow dummies scattered across the map he could blink to.
---
Matchmaking got worse when they decided to fix it.
---
Yeah. Start the game as Myers and burn the shard as an offering. For that game you’ll have the ability to play as the pig for one round.
---
No perks, no add-ons. The ones you have selected will not apply to the pig that game.
---
This has me rollin!
---
WIP? that looks done and good to me, maybe just a little dirt and grime to be completely accurate
---
I mean...if you're good at looping and can make chases last a while then i don't see a point in cleansing. Yeah it makes you a 1hit downer but i'd rather be that than have to deal with her puke. I don't because of that and i usually escape vs Plague.
---
Take NOED out of the game
---
I never played Legion prior to the rework.
---
Take NOED out of the game.
---
You fool!
---
Killers arent wanting endgame to happen unless they know they already won, so instead of hooking survivors, they are leaving them on the ground to chase others. This ensures that the hatch wont spawn and the end game wont start.
---
Looks like a Meg. 
---
(Looks at character) Yeah, it's a Meg.
---
Is there something wrong with it now? Only read what it does the other day and figured running bond with it could be a good combo/support tool when you know who has an exhaustion perk.
---
~~I just need to get it first.~~
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted because it's the truth
---
The killer even spawning into the same match as survivors is tunnelling. If you don't wanna get tunnelled off the hook, then don't run 15 feet and stop to heal while the surv who saved you was smart enough to run clear across the map. What am I supposed to do, ignore the second down and hook that you just practically handed to me?
---
Any tension of struggling on the hook is kinda lost after you play a bunch. Having it be fail-able is fine, I just hate having to destroy one of my buttons. I think a generous skillcheck would be good, so long as it's unaffected by things like unnerving presence
---
Darn
---
What if I don't want you to see my Red stain through walls? 
---
By the way, are they gonna be fixing that next chapter?
---
You're wise for hiding them
---
DAMMIT.
---
Lettuce hag is watching you shower
---
hehe
---
When you show shirtless Myers Obi-Wan's quote already applies.
---
That legitimately sounds like more work than actually playing the game properly.
---
This is why you don't respect the 4%.
---
People dont like the truth. Sorry to say. I dont mind it. Was just explaining that people make up rules and others basically twist and turn them to fit their needs. That's why I dont play by their rules. If I wanna "camp" "tunnel" etc I'll do it. Its like if I were to say "you cant hide next to the hook to save someone or else that would make you a camper"
---
Some people will do anything for a 4k
---
Cuz he is an absolute UNIT
---
What fix are you taking about?
---
Saw this video, pretty comedic
---
Reasonably experienced player here, I believe the reason why some killers just go for the swing is because the prompt doesn’t work or show (it’s hit or miss in my case) and results in a normal M1 hit. Also, since I’m rarely able to grab people off the gen/unhook/locker, I just take the opportunity to get a free hit before they run away.
---
I quit playing my Totem Tapp build because I always ended up getting caught  and not having enough time to cleanse every single Totem by myself, I would really like a Totem counter so I'll know if I got them all.
---
All I see are keys and how much I want them to burn.

If DBD couldn’t acquire Jeepers Creepers rights, I would at least love a scarecrow based killer (wielding a Scythe of course) that can use scarecrows to hide from the survivors in plain sight
---
Honestly i gave up long ago trying to be an honourable player. Playing as a killer main i get so much hate from survivors no matter how i play the game even been abused by some ive intentionally let go. 
---
So now that ive worked out the entire community is toxic. I go out of my way to farm as much salt as possible.
---
For example running noed on myers.
---
Or i built a legion build that is designed to block gens and drag the game out ridiculously long but i never try to win with him i let every surv heal up after hits and just gen block. ( perks like overcharge, tinker, surveillance, discordance)
---
Longest match with him was over an hour.
---
I do not know any "funny" stories, as I know that my sense of humor is ... Interesting to say the least, I do know however that I already have Dead By Daylight, I also do know that I have friends, Unexpectedly... And they know that I know that they want DBD, and they know that I won't gift them DBD but I know that they know that there is always hope, and they know that hope is the last thing to dissapear, therefore I know that they know that there is a chance of me gifting them dbd, I also know that they will be suprised and satisfied and will know me as a better person if I were to gift them dbd, which I know will also make me happy. So ... I know that you know that you want to make a couple of degenerates happy, which would also make both of us know that you're a good person, I know that you know that we both want all this happiness to happen ;)
---
They can change the icons and backgrounds of the perks, some packs change the icons completely, some add colors to the icons, and some change the backgrounds of the perks. It also works with add-ons, offerings, powers, etc
---
Of course Wraith understands. He's so adorable.
---
I love this so much!
---
1.) Because I main Kate and love her
---
2.) This will probably really useful for the stupid role plays me and my friends do in Kill Your Friends
---
How do I vote? Do I just sign in with my reddit account?

#**S A M E**
---
You don’t have to buy it, but if you pay you get more cosmetics than normal
---
That would be great fix, but it should only apply to solid walls.
---
Yes, mostly in higher ranked matches.
---
A lot of them either go for 4 man survive or DC immediately.
---
It'd be cool but flying would probably be a no-go. Imagine all pallets and wall on the map being useless and there's no hiding. The game would end the moment it starts.
---
That reply is wrong, you don’t HAVE to pay, you just get more cosmetics, also it’s just items for your character, not an in game advantage
---
They can't work without the other &lt;3
---
That Huntress: Adrenaline is OP pls nerf
---
What do you mean by that?
---
Near the pallet, in the killer shack, if god pallet still up, if you run balanced, on a hill, so you can reach the pallet, on a tractor in coldwin. At least you won't go down in 2 seconds.
---
**THEY NEED TO DO THIS HE'S SO UGLY OMG HKSHKSHKSHSKHSK**
---
Just out of curiosity, how much killer do you play? What’s the highest rank you’ve made as killer? Also, which killer would you say you main?
---
Actually, you don’t have to pay for the rifts, but if you do you get more cosmetics and hey, guess what! It. Doesn’t. Give. You. An. In-game. Advantage. You don’t need cosmetics, you only want them.
---
***Yes they also need to do that.***
---
I'm rank 1 on both killer and survivor and I main Billy,nurse. Killer imo is just infinitely easier than survivor and the perks are a sure lot better.
---
Very understandable. Just wanted to make sure i wasn't overlooking something. Thank you.
---
No worries!
---
I ran make your choice for awhile and would accidentally tunnel the unhooked/injured survivor, even though I was following the scratch marks hoping to down the unhooker. There have been a couple times where it felt like they were supossedly entitled to not being chased at all after unhook (based on post game toxicity lol). But it's just common sense though to do that.
---
Ngl probably the best Huntress cosplay I've seen so far
---
I’m pretty sure it will have auric only cosmetics, or it’ll have exclusive cosmetics to that tier, but don’t @ me on that
---
I'm loving all the wholesomeness the Myers hug has brought to the world.
---
stealth killer btw :)
---
Naturally any perk would seem stronger on either of those killers. I wouldn’t really say that’s a fair basis of comparison. Besides, based off your post history I don’t really believe your comment. You seem to constantly complain about how overpowered killers are. 
---
That being said, survivor could easily be considered the easier role. You can literally do nothing the entire match and still escape. You don’t have the luxury of slacking as a killer. Despite the fact that I’ve been playing more killer recently I still have more time played as a survivor. One person working on their own against 4 separate people is always going to work harder than the other.
---
Is there any chance at all to get Robert Englund Freddy as cosmetics?
---
Is this a cosmestics contest submission?
---
When a fan manages to do it and a company can't ;(
---
From all your descriptions I dont think I would want to play survivor against you.
---
But the killer can only use 4 at a time while survivors get 16 at a time. Plus there is also SWF, so that’s a perk in itself.
---
I was looking for fan made cosmetics and I just searched “cosmetics” and found this, and it was funny hoe you said pay to win lol
---
I never got what was wrong with Quentin. I never saw his movie (just the original) but when I saw him I thought it was pretty cool that Freddy’s survivor looks sleep deprived and probably uses drugs to stay awake.
---
“Cosmetics” was said a fuck load of times in this thread lol
---
oh I wish
---
That little dot nose is beyond adorable.
---
can't submit cosmetics for branded killers though
---
Welp, I’m not seeing anything.
---
He doesn't need to be Billy or Nurse but please make him better.
---
If anything just get rid of Detect until you rework him.
---
I mostly play survivor so I can kinda predict the most often used hiding spots. Or I just get lucky and run into them again
---
Bro are you dumb, like I'm not trying to be mean but just because there is 4 survivors does not mean that one survivor is using 16 perks. Most of the time as well your not gonna see perk builds that different because theres like only 8 good survivor perks. And swf isnt a perk, It all depends if the group has good synergy and if they do itll just make it easier to know where the killer is. There really isnt one survivor perk that will stop camping/tunneling with the exception of DS but once you hit it's gone and the killer is right back on you again if he isnt a chimp and can see bloodstains and scratch Marks. Not to mention once you DS killers will only tunnel you because they are toxic and think survivors shouldnt have any chance of winning. Like I remember this one time I called a guy out for camping and he said it's because I looped him 🤦‍♂️.
---
Yep! Will need to add them on a convention and need to add some buckles and her throwing axe:)
---
Hehe
---
HAHAHA
---
Thank you!!!
---
2 kills ain’t a win, gotta dominate
---
And for my next trick, i will make the survivor DISAPPEAR
---
Idk why but I love the flashbangs, they are easy to use and also to find ;)
---
Hmmm
---
that game is lame
---
she's just so fucking juicy like jesus CHRIST how does she fit all that in suit pants
---
Np im 21 😂😂
---
It's gweat UwU
---
Haha !!!!
---
Oh man this is so cool! Do you think you have a measurement of the length of the ears? My friend is trying to create her mask and she didn't really build it up properly.
---
I think they both need reworks
---
I looked through that reddit and am confused. What’s it about?
---
Ill measure it later today :D im now omw to dokomi ^^
---
ghostface being myers and amandas son is my new fav headcanon
---
Had 3 matches in a row right now where I would begin a chase with a survivor down them and they start to float then everyone DCs immediately after. 2 of those games 1 person didn’t DC and when I hit them the screen faded to black as if the game ended and they had either escaped or died. I’m playing on Xbox One.
---
Thank you so much! I appreciate it!
---
Yes
---
Every nurse I have played against was trying her out because the matches were crazy easy. Is she really that good with a skilled player?
---
Make it Dio and I'm up for it.
---
This is cool and all but what I've seen people do is suicide on hook instead of dcing
---
I actually wonder why they're so shit at making stealth killers and giving them appropriate powers?
---
can’t have daddy issues if you don’t have a daddy
---

Making low-effort memes to dump on the game:

someone explain

---
Ghostface is a disappointment
---
That’s just a D-class with a white face
---
And the only reason emblem system exists is because killer mains (like marth, who I actually like) where moaning about killer cube system for pipping, emblem system has always been trash but it’s true colours were only revealed when they upped the requirements for a pip. NOED can turn a 0K into a 4K, ruin can make a gen rush non existent, enduring literally rewards you with no drawback, and if you add spirit fury to enduring you can get a free hit on a survivor, rancor gives you a free kill unless you are extremely bad, Whispers punishes you if you play stealthily (same with the Doctor itself), 
---
The “killer being able to get kills solely depends on the skill of the survivor” has been debunked by Scott Jund (DamnNoHtml)
---
The likelihood of finding a key and actually getting to use it is so low using it as an argument is asinine.
---
They could be from special Events.
---
Distressing on a Nurse, huh. Also 3, 3 Dead Hard, ah ah ah
---
Uhhhhhhh i hate this. I know its a joke but I've seen so many like this its annoying.
---
You don’t need a license for a machete. Or a hockey Mask. That’s like needing a license for a t-shirt and a hotdog.
---
His mori better be him quickly beheading and pulling the tounge out with his teeth.
---
Dead Hard OP pls nerf.
---
Hi! Disciple of Peter from r/PeterDisciples here to explain the joke. The joke is that the Dwight wants to vault the window to evade the killer, but the killer has a hammer and wants to hammer down the loose nail he sees in the window.
---
Haha I run that same build kitty Kat slut
---
P3 Nurse too.
---
Swim trunks skin.
---
*sack
---
Maybe not the machete but I do think that the mask he wears is licensed
---
u/PeterExplainsTheJoke
---
Remove dark sense
---
Honestly the toolboxes’ speed boosts are negligible
---
I as a oink main know  that Amanda is capable but  still sucks that her crouch speed is 90 percent plus her addons are so shit and it ends up helping the surviors.
---
Still love her tho
---
Well this is my wallpaper now.
---
I really want to see the post game chat
---
why?
---
The best video we are ever likely to see
---
Because it is kind of bad and there are way better perks like iron will or deliverance
---
It just means they took a percent off of it but it’s less than one and they don’t want to round up.
---
Well said
---
Or the killer dodged because I'm using p3 Meg
---
Honestly it's the best build because it makes a lot of people salty.
---
No Touching: Your determination to survive on your own consumes you. 
---
For every self heal action you complete, or for every generator you work on for at least 30 seconds alone, gain 50% increased action speed for 8/12/16 seconds.
---
If a player comes within 40/25/10 meters, you cannot heal or repair until they are outside of this radius.
---
I would love looking for that last totem only to realize post game I was looking for something that wasn't even there
---
I think 100 percent would be decent, 
---
105 %( tier 1 Myers) would be my godsend

"A-river-derchi"

*super happy oink*

Isn't it glitched rn anyway?
---
No problem. Glad to help.
---
So I suppose we’re going to ignore personal accountability when citing NOEDs ability to snowball. NOED can literally be made void by doing totems. I don’t get mad at killer for running NOED when I get downed trying to rush the hook during the endgame, thats a gamble I chose to make. Ruin suffers from poor spawns and like NOED can be made obsolete within a matter of minutes (sometimes less) in a trial. Even still, it hardly poses a threat to competent survivors who power through, hit skill checks, or even gen tap. Enduring just got nerfed to where it’s literally a counter to only pallets, should counters not exist? Spirit fury doesn’t proc on its own either, you literally have to break pallets then get stunned. Drop the pallet early if it’s that big of a concern to you. Rancor also requires you to run a perk just to get that kill, the aura reading is negligible when perks like BBQ offer better awareness and reward. Whisper gives you a general idea, it doesn’t point out the survivors exact location.
---
I’m not exactly sure of the point you’re trying to make here. I distinctly referred to the killer’s ability to pip,  not get kills. So I’m not sure why I should care what some person I’ve never heard of has to say. 
---
It literally happened to me twice yesterday. Granted this is purely through luck of RNG, just because it doesn’t happen every game does not mean it can be completely disregarded. Hell, I even saw one of the survivors I queued with find a key and escape mid trial. Combine this with perks that increase the rarity of found items and this unlikely scenario becomes far more common.
---
TRUTHFULLY the best form of advice i can give you is predict when the shocks are going to cheese you.
---
at some point you’re going to figure out how to stop survivors at loops and whatnot, but once the pallet is thrown down it’s a matter of guessing which side they’ll end up on after you shock them.
---
what do i mean? 
---
the pallet has now been thrown down while you’re in a chase. it’s not a basic unsafe pallet where you can mindgame without having to shock to prevent the vault. sometimes a survivor will try to vault immediately when they’re shocked. why that’s in the game i have no idea but it feels like shit LOL. they will literally scream and _sometimes_ they make it over. there’s a very short window of time that after they get shocked they can vault. when they do vault,over they’ll be trapped and hugging the pallet. that’s your free hit. 
---
also don’t build madness mid chase just get the down. you’ll probably get madness up by default if you’re at pallets, vaults, etc.
---
Weakling
---
Permanent ban will never happen. Especially if people paid for things.
---
I think? Sometimes the exhaustion will show up but I don't actually DH. Not sure if it's latency or if it's just not DH fast enough but I wouldn't be surprised if it was broken anyway.
---
Does anyone know if they're going to implement a crafting system? I think it would go pretty well in this game
---
Ahh that’s hot. That’s hot.
---
Reminds me of a trapper putting a trap down in front of a pallet I'm looping instead of just destroying the pallet
---
This isnt an actual skin, is it?
---
It actually doesn't work atm. It actually freezes the timer for how long it is suposed to reduce it atm. Hope they fix this bug soon
---
Yes, or even an in-game model viewer like some games have. I just left a comment but I really love how beautiful these character models are, and I feel I have taken it for granted!
---
I don’t understand why killers are allowed to see survivors names yet we can’t without a 3rd party app.
---
..Not stupid but Claudette
---
Are you high
---
That art of the killers dancing were right. Myers and pig were a good match after all.
---
Weinstein has nothing to do with Ghostface other than his studio paying for a couple scream movies to happen. Wes Craven owns everything Scream, and RJ owns Ghostface. Also, Scream is with a new license with a new studio. Salva actually raped a child, I would NEVER hand any money over to this fat disgusting shack of shit.
---
Yeah same.
---
I played with Mario and Luigi once and our other guy tried to make fancy Ace into Wario somehow.
---
I love the purple with the black nice work
---
fuck now i'm crying because i thought of chester
---
You're rank 1 my ass you're a fucking stupid rank 16 lets be honest. My god you're dumb mate please educate yourself.
---
Laura?
---
is this loss?
---
I mean it depends on which cosmetic.
---
There's the store-DLC + streamer-cosmetics. Most streamer cosmetics are in charity case but like DiaHype for example is not available there and has to be directly given to you by Diatech. 
---
Then there's Legacy-Prestiege which was awarded for every prestiege level  before november 2016. 
---
And to add to streamer-cosmetics there are artifact-versions which are given directly by the streamer, theyre the exact same as the charity case version except for their rarity.
---
Then there's exclusives such as BIG Hat, Donkey David, Street Meg etc. which were given out at different events. 
---
And finally some event cosmetics like David's Untamed-Donkey Jacket and Huntress' hound mask which were earned during specific events.
---
Nah, this is rework freddy
---
'50% pain'
---
And a 100% reason to DC from the game.
---
Obviously? Difficulty doesn't justify brokeness.
---
Just playing devil's advocate.  Rapist or not, if somehow this DLC pack did ever see the light of day, my sole criteria is merely the quality of said DLC seeing as how the guy did the crime and paid the time.  
---
Also Wes Craven owns (er, well owned I guess?) Scream?  I was under the impression the rights fell to Weinstein, hence why we've yet to see hide nor hair of MTV's Scream season 3 or any further film developments?
---
Because if you remove it infinite’s will come back again.
---
*seizure vacuum noises*
---
The 3 flashlights are basically  the same, and none of them are above B-tier.
---
it's not about the survivor, flashlights are ineffective vs killers that aren't horrible at the game.
---
It's a bunch of adult pretending to be 9 year old kids living in 2009
---
sadly not im afraid
---
Its not lol. Its just snug to my face
---
The ranged dmg puke is a pain in the ass. You can shoot it over obstacles and through windows and what not. And it doesn't have a cooldown so It's a fast 2 hit down. I'd rather loop injured and use dead hard.
---
he taped and orally(!) raped a 14 year old boy and got in jail for that and served his sentence in early 90s. where did you get that trash information?
---
This is top tier stuff. If you make one with Ashley Williams "Oh yeah!" sound, I will consider you a High Lord of Memes.
---
doubt it since New Line wants jackie earl hailey to be “The Freddy”, but i would love to have a robert england freddy
---
Should have put the old Kate scream over the first bit 😂😂
---
Are you trying to farm downvotes? Because I got one for ya!
---
You hit me right in the feels with this one......Sry bro
---
It’s been ... many moons
---
Tbh I wanted to try out noed too only for that and see for myself. Its honestly dumb how many kills I got with this perk that I shouldn't have gotten. Ik it's cool to get some more kills but relying on a perk to win a game is just not challenging at all and starts to make no fun so that's why I stopped using it (except insidious bubba, but only for the MEMES)
---
Everyone agrees but easier said than done.
---
also Im not sure of you're wording your text like that ironically or seriously and I dont think I want to know.
---
How? not to be rude.
---
get rid of him and adopt PINHEAD. 
---
PINHEAD PINHEAD PINHEAD damnit lol, Iv been going crazy waiting for him just as much as Iv been waiting for a GOOD Freddy overhaul, my favorite movie killer=almost worst killer, 
---
The post I saw about the pinhead chapter was like April 1, 2018 I think
---
True. It's cute and all but good luck surviving on Macmillan or Backwater swamp with that hair.
---
If you are on a hook, the generators finishing will activate adrenaline once you are unhooked
---
Agreed if there is a hole it should work different
---
Dad By Daylight
---
https://youtu.be/0RV_HHkunTE
---
So what I do is use a character’s three unique perks and then one more random one that complements them. I’ll then switch characters after leveling five or so bloodwebs. I don’t always win but I almost always have fun.
---
Skeleton and Dull Keys should get an S+ tier because of how stupid they are.
---
I think they should throw ghostface in a dumpster and bring in a pro = PINHEAD
---
While the overall name and general appearance of Jason is copyright (Big dude w/ machete and hockey mask), the machete by itself is not copyright because that is just a tool and the hockey mask by itself isn't either, unless it has the exact markings from the movies then they might have something. Ghostface is different because the mask was made by some company and the movie got the rights to use it.
---
GIFF F2P
---
WE ship them
---
they would have to make a bloody version of every cosmetic and then code the game in a way where it only gives you the option to use those versions when you both own the cosmetic and have the prestiege + redo with legacy.
---
Lightweight is virtually pointless. Drop it. If you want to be immersed use spine chill.
---
Worth the effort though
---
Pro 1 answers Con 1: Survivors risk staying in the trial and potentially dying to help or GTFO, a match shouldn't pointlessly last just because Survivors want to stand in the exits for the killer to eventually come by so they can run away.
---
2) A killer should have the advantage in a 1v1 against a survivor, if survivors decided to not cleanse the totems and NOED activates then it's their fault. (Small Game totem counter when)
---
3 &amp; 4) Survivors failed to complete 5 generators and the last Survivor failed to find the hatch first, if the killer prevented both situations from happening then they should have an advantage after closing the hatch in a 1v1.
---
Pig=upvote. I was asleep when this got uplaoded so I am a bit late.
---
I wish I had this much creativity. 
---
Funniest shit I’ve seen come out of this sub.
---
I actually like that a lot. I feel like something like that would probably make the perk less hated, and hell, the thought of it just not being some huge crutch at the end makes it sound like a pretty cool perk to me. As it stands, don’t get me wrong, I still hate the perk, so I’m not against it getting a change. I’m a big fan of Fungoose, and I agree with him on it, that it’s a perk that rewards bad play. The way that sounds it would reward good play, at least from how I see it.
---
I mean you could always get The Swamp over and over and over again like I do. I’d take an AH any day over swamp.
---

Everything you have goes away ( perks/ items/add ons) and you get bloody clothes in return. 
---
I personally only did it for the achievement. I find the clothes help for stealth purposes, but that is all.
---
KEEP SQUATTING BEHIND PALLETS
---
Yes you lose all your perks. 
---
No you don't get any blood points.
---
Yes you start from scratch.
---
Oh ok, thanks for the reply!
---
Been wanting this since I got the DLC. Don’t have a problem with current Freddy and he’s my main. Gonna be super stupid easy to play him now.
---
ah shit i predicted it 9 hours early
---
You lose everything from Offerings to add-ons to perks and receive a bloody shirt/ bloody pants/ bloody face depending on the prestige. After the third prestige (after bloody face), you receive nothing.
---
Fuck Roony Mara. Long live Heather Langenkamp.
---
you lose everything on the character except for teachables, the advantages of prestiging are a bloody cosmetic and possibly a increase in higher rarity items appearing on your bloodweb but i have seen mixed info on if that's real or a rumor
---
The OP is asking for a perk rework on the Survivor from the same DLC. Not cosmetic changes.
---
I'd say Monto, No0b3, TydeTyme, HybridPanda, Farmer John, Demi, Ussylis and PainReliever
---
Don’t need NOED with my spirit main build. They never complete the last generator, and if I can find the hatch b4 the last survivor 4kill everytime, Iv had people calling me a hacker but I’m not. Spirit be a bad bitch if u know how to play her.
---
Hopefully they make a paragraph in the future to add him or Sid
---
These abilities are mostly used for catching survivors off guard on generators or similar actions. Ghostface was meant to be the stealthy pursuer but now we will have to see what the backlash will do to his rework.
---
Honestly.... we need both
---
Same story, I have almost all teachables perks for survivors, I'm trying to get MoM on Feng min and it's like months that I'm at level 50 prestige 3. Only in the last days I used something like 7/8 escape cake and 4/5 bps but still nothing.
---
Ah, im just a dumb fuck. Thank you kind sir/mam
---
Rank 4 quing with 13 and 11..... interesting!!!
---
I was wondering this also
---
I thought the joke was that the nail will impale Dwight’s hand if he vaults lol
---
I'm a survivor main and I think killers are weak! Survivors just complain to much!!
---
Thrill of the Hunt + NOED = search and destroy
---
When I say “find a match” I mean I get a lobby and then instantly get kicked out with this or the the host dodges.
---
Looks like that guy on sealab 2021, also I wanna give a shot out to those survivors who like to wear bright ass close and nean blue hair. I can see you threw  the walls
---
The thing is that if you rebind your m1 and m2 to other keys while playing killer, you wont have these problems anymore, all good killers use q and e instead of m1 and m2 so they wont get this bug or input lag, whatever it is.
---
That's my boy trying his best to compete with Billie Ellish
---
I don’t know man, the perk seems pretty strong already. I didn’t buy that chapter so haven’t unlocked it yet anyway so- you’d know better than me
---
But it’s soo satisfying watching the survivor who 4 got she had the hat on try to run out the exit gate
---
Finger... Hand...
---
YOU HAVE TO STOP WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING TO ENTER LOCKERS AND IT WASTES SO MUCH OF THE SURVIVOR'S TIME. IF YOU'RE CAUGHT WHERE THERE'S NO LOCKERS THEN THE KILLER JUST GETS FREE WALLHACKS IN A SURVIVAL GAME ALL ABOUT STEALTH, IT'S WAY TOO STRONG. IT'S ABOUT AS OP AS THE OLD BORROWED TIME OR DECISIVE STRIKE
---
Normally I'd agree, but look at the plague. When a survivor becomes sick, they get some chunky green plague goo on their clothes, no matter the cosmetic. It looks very similar to Prestige except with goo instead of blood, which makes me think they could work something out for prestige cosmetics.
---
That's nice to know.  
---
Thank you for your effort.
---
My reaction when I first heard her injury noise was something among the lines of "yeaahh that doesn't really sound like pain noises, Jane"
---
Ohhhh that would sound be good !
---
Quinton looks like he hasn't slept for weeks! 
---
Oh wait....
---
Now I want pallet plushies...
---
I like to consider it more like borrowing.

Vigil at launch: Pretty good perk, not critical but doesn't hurt if you can find a way to balance it with your perks.
---
Vigil , half a year later : Running been nerfed, Vigil hasn't been updated.
---
Vigil , a year later :  Vigil doesn't do fucking anything.
---
Vigil, a year and a half later : Status effects have been buffed - Killer perks have had a complete rework. Killers now get permanent status effects.  Vigil only slightly helps with exhaustion.
---
Vigil, two years later : What's vigil? Never heard of it.

i just noticed, je had een WoW cosplay gedaan hoezo heb je die verwijderd it's a good one.

Nah I am, it’s just as soon as I find someone to do a gen with 😂 the killer also finds me

It is in the perk explanation.
---
Literally my Myers for M&amp;A
---
Survivors complaining about killers dodging lobbys, camping, tunneling or running NOED:  
---
"FUCKING KILLERS. NOOBS. THEY SUCK AND NEED CRUTCH PERKS AND STRATEGYS."   
---
Killers complaining about toxic survivors:  
---
"Wow dude. Take a step back. I think you got an aggression problem, mate."
---
I love this subreddit.
---
this gave me ptsd
---
Meg head strikes again
---
It’s not that serious bud
---
Yesterday it only tooks me 35 minutes to find a game.
---
I'd rather take killers dodging lobbys over survivors dc'ing after I found them/first hit/first down/first hook.  
---
The problem I run into with killers is them adapting their playstyle in a way I don't like.  
---
Yesterday I had a Huntress that facecamped everyone she got because 'She got looped and doesn't like that'.  
---
The problem I run into with survivors is them just disconnecting and fucking EVERYBODY over as soon as something happens which they don't like - which seems to be a lot.
---
Then you are part of the problem
---
You probably own a instagram page showing dbd art and say "credit to artist" like that helps
---
How about neither? 
---
One is a fatty, the other has pancake ass. Flat.
---
Sometimes as killer u see ppl that are way too coordinated and u can't believe they are randoms.
---
Wtf do you have against A Vigil,he's A good roamer almost as good as caveira
---
Vigil was introduced at the same time that Exhaustion was changed so that running made Exhaustion not go down iirc
---
No. No swearing in my Christian minecraft server
---
If you were cornered and he had trap setting addons he made the right choice
---
I'm down for anything that helps survivors earn more bloodpoints
---
Now make her wear it without making everything clip through it.
---
You can use it as you want (-:
---
Cursed Wraith legs at the botton picture.
---
"I go to VidCon."
---
Well, yes.
---
When hell freezes over lol
---
Remove shadow from the second leg
---
Blessed Dwight gang
---
How about reworking ghostface before he goes live...
---
Survivors already have a perk that gives stacks to BP earnings (WGLF)
---
Klopt maar mensen gingen te veel meme’en 😂
---
ty for letting me know :)
---
Sounds good :) I was thinking maybe the glass from the coffin thing Hoffman sealed himself in but that obv wouldn't make any sense for Amanda.
---
It's a good idea :) It could also be probable
---
Haha I would buy it   #shutupdevsandtakemymoney 🤣😂
---
LOL I am surprised that this Legion didn't DC.
---
I
---
Wow you’re big mad. 
---
Should everyone spend time researching a picture they want to post on reddit prior to posting?
---
Did the video work for you
---
I had 2 games back to back where I didn't camp, didn't tunnel, if i ran into the recently unhooked survivor, i just slug them and walk away, letting them get picked up. Exit gate open, i got 0 kills, 2 survivors on hook, i walk away, chase the baiting survivor so his teammate can unhook the others... game ends with 1 dude dying to post game collapse, boom "fuck you camping cunt" "get fucked" "get good" etc. same with game 2. 
---
It's discouraging. I mean im not the best killer out there, so when im playing nicely so that everyone has a good time, i am putting my own chances of winning at pretty negative odds. It's never even the one survivor you did manage to get, it's always the guy who's been teabagging you from the start
---
Wait wait wait, you designed david? wot
---
Get the pc version unless you like a cinematic 24fps
---
Sounds like a lot of yappening, and not a lot of happening
---
I love all this art, is there any showcase for the animators and/or riggers?
---
Just get all perks and you will get it.
---
Against semi-good survivors ur probably not gonna get 2 kills without ruin as a standard M1 killer. 
---
As survivor you can use whatever perk you want but killers are kinda restricted.
---
Don’t worry about it. A quick look into this person’s history shows they have a lengthy history of incessant whining on this subreddit. It’s not anything you did
---
It's just a bp grinding perk, it can't really be unfair.
---
I feel like there is something i'm missing, but i'm not sure.
---
Is this sarcastic? I can't tell
---
Don’t forget that it also doesn’t affect Broken at all, so it also can’t be taken to reduce the negative of Deliverance, or deal with Legion’s Broken pin. Not that it would make massive different, but 12 seconds off of Deliverance’s broken at least would give it a consistent use of making Deliverance safer to use.
---
Always nice to see good plays like this without t-bagging
---
phew!   thank you very much.. I was getting worried that I had violated some sort of hidden reddit rules I had no idea about
---
But the grind is the best part surely? Otherwise doesn't everything feel cheap?
---
Did Wraith sit on the syringe
---
I play both sides and I have been called SWF sometimes but little did they know I don’t have friends.
---
But when I play killer sometimes it really looks like a SWF because they are always at the right place on the right moment.
---
Beautiful
---
For as many memes there are on this subreddit, this is not a meme and I am actually being serious. No sarcasm intended :D
---
That offering didn't flip
---
what's so powerful earning 200% a stackable bonus to bloodpoints?
---
Exactly, that's what I did this season as well. You also don't have to wait 20 years to find a full lobby.
---
I never understood how people find flashlight saves hard, on console I get it because aiming isn’t the easiest but on PC it is so easy.
---
(I have 350+ hours so no I am not someone who plays non stop.)
---
America is a continent, sweety. Canada, USA, Mexico and all the Latino American countries are from America. You sound patriotic
---
Frank's mask looks super happy you wore it.
---
Prolly gonna get shit for saying this but he sounds like a Morty when you pick him up.
---
Lightweight sucks. It doesn’t do shit.
---
I screenshot my comment
---
I always delete this Ritual i hate it
---
PM
---
shrouded hunt &amp; stalk is way better than night shroud
---
True
---
i don't know why it was changed. it was pretty stupid tbh
---
Yeah. Doc with distressing and legion are still the best. Throw in bqq and chilli on either of them and you can probably reach +100k bp during the event
---
For me I don't find it really hard per say but having the stars align where someone goes down near enough to me that I can get in position and THEN get a flashlight save off, it's super rare.   
---
Flashlight saves aren't hard obviously if you are in swf and you are following your buddy around.
---
Awesome, cheers
---
No rules broken! Thanks for your post
---
Id want it to be shaggy.
---
Legion main here and i disagree, Legion is literally the best BP grinder in the game. 32k matches almost every match, 64k with bbq.
---
I’ll try. 🤗
---
Actually Doctor is the one killer you don't want to run Distressing on. 
---
Doctor by nature always maxes his Deviousness every match, Distressing just makes that faster it dosent give *bonus* BP like BBQ does, i,e it just makes you reach 8k faster.
---
You want to run distressing on killers who don't get a lot of deviousness points to begin with, like Trapper or Pig.
---
Next up a Noøk and Michael Myers crossover
---
why ?
---
Thanks! that super helps!
---
He's talking about the perks and in the movies he doesn't look like a gremlin
---
New dc giving me more problems than before
---
What do you mean? I quit meta perks a *long* time ago
---
*hides my bbq, ruin, enduring, spirit fury, pig build*
---
Guys is Decisive Strike still good? I bought it on the shrine of secrets but I don't know if I'm going to use it or not.
---
Legion. I main legion because i make around 60k bp on average per match.
---
Perks: BBQ, Discordance, Bloodhound and sloppy butcher.
---
Basically try to chain as much Feral frenzy as you can to start with, If you stab someone and see the chance to stab another always take it. The survivor you've left has to take the time to cleanse their deep wounds and then heal their injuries.
---
Always kick gens, ALWAYS if you walk towards a generator and see someone run from it, don't chase straight away, break it first. This way you get points plus it's degrading while you chase them, you're faster than them so you'll be able to make up the distance pretty quickly.
---
Also break pallets when you can, Ira button is good for this as you can break pallets after vaulting them.
---
Good luck.
---
Borrowed time would be my pick
---
**Youuugh**
---
4 man Claudette squad
---
okay, but make the killers addons the same too then. suddenly it's not that great of an idea? only op item survirvors left are instaheals, u get in like every 10th bloodweb, 1 level 50 bloodweb is how any points, 70 000? that's like 3-4 games, so you probably get 1 instaheal in every 30-40 games? i recently prestiged my man Jeff and he had 4 instaheals in 50 levels.
---
I honestly don't understand why people vault against huntress except when it's super safe.You basically guarantee yourself a hatchet hit,I'd rather try to dodge it instead.
---
And I've seen some people run bamboozle as huntress,bruh moment
---
this ghost face has nothing to do with scream.  
---
I think that's the reason they switched the phone to a camera for the mori
---
And they say d-strike sucks now
---
And you did
---
Not giving credit to the original creator
---
And karma whoring
---
Seriously 1 day on reddit and you desperate for karma? That's sad
---
Anti tunnel perk. If you feel like you're getting tunneleda lot you can use it unless you have other perks you prefer
---
Honestly it's pretty bare bones and non changing mostly, especially for Killer.
---
For Killer (Currently Rank 2):
---
The Nurse: BBQ, Ruin, Thanatophobia and Sloppy Butcher.
---
The Pig: Ruin, Thanatophobia or NoeD), Enduring and Sloppy Butcher.
---
The Hillbilly: BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury.
---
The Clown: Ruin, NoeD, Enduring and STBFL.
---
Survivor (Currently Rank 5):
---
Ultra Heals: Adrenaline, Botany Knowledge, Self Care and We'll Make It.
---
I M M E R S E D: Adrenaline, Calm Spirit, Urban Evasion and Iron Will.
---
All Rounder: Adrenaline, Self Care, Balanced Landing + Perk of your choice, I normally do We'll Make It.
---
You need more upvotes
---
&gt;Killers gain a considerable advantage over survivors during EndGame.
---
As they should, At that point it's a 1v1 and the killer should ALWAYS be stronger in a 1v1. EGC is meant to become a stealth game, When and if the killer sees you it's supposed to be over.
---
&gt;NoED activates during the EndGame sequence if all totems are not taken out, making a 1v1 situation with the killer very difficult to manage as a survivor.
---
Right, because it's endgame. If you want to take away perks like NOED for being used in Endgame than you should also be ok with perks like Hope or Adrenaline being taken away.
---
&gt;If the survivor does not find the hatch first, the killer will always win unless the survivor has a key.
---
See point one.
---
&gt;Killer can close hatch and camp exit gates- sometimes can just stand in between them and watch for a red light to appear on the gate and know where the survivor is.
---
​
---
I slightly agree but again see point one.
---
What is the Killer supposed to do, just stand there docile as you run away?
---
Would borrowed time pop if you unhook yourself?
---
&gt; 'm speaking to the fact that it does not serve as a balanced solution to the hatch standoff problem-
---
It's not supposed to. The EGC was never about hatch standoffs, that was just a bonus. The EGC was designed to prevent survivors from holding the game hostage by hiding and not leaving when they should.
---
I have to wonder if people will vote with their wallet this time around or are we going to just mindlessly buy whatever crap BHVR throw at us
---
One of the few things lf is good at is camping, so they're probably doing it because of that
---
Bond and Lithe are my survivor musts
---
YES PLEASE
---
If you focus on avoiding the killer and getting saves, get borrowed time. Keep in mind you're gonna get a free deliverance just by saving, even unsafely, if you have Borrowed
---
On the other hand if your goal is to keep the killer occupied and using some second chances to keep you in the game, Dead Hard is the best pick for survivability.
---
i've made some mistakes in my life too. some would say they're horrible. and i bet if someone caught me doing those i'd be sent to mental hospital till the rest of my days and wasn't able to make others happy with what i am right now. people change. i've chanhed and will never make same mistakes ever again. mistakes ≠ personality. you just assumed he did more than that and that he has something else on his mind as if you can read minds. that's sad and disgusting. i know my opinion is unpopular while yours is what considered normal, i won't change mine just because most people are unable to consider all factors.
---
To be fair its pretty obvious when a killer has noed
---
This is probably the largest brain meme I’ve seen to date
---
BBQ is really helpful but as you can see I use it on the High Mobility Killers or Huntress cause of her power so I can make the most of the Aura Reading. Plus some higher Survs know that Gens block its fucking Aura so keep track of where someone goes down and they move around the gen they're doing (if they can).
---
To say Ruin is a requirement at the Higher Ranks is an understatement. You can get away without it if you're a God Nurse or Spirit but otherwise no, anyone who says they do probably play against potatoes or all Solo Q. Oh, and currently not against MoM users, because we all love the free extra hit they get! :).
---
Finally somebody who agrees!
---
what are you talking about. What happened in the video required a self unhook with a 4% chance of success and a great juke to manage to unhook her teamate.
---
In the majority of other scenario it would have failed.
---
Impossible
---
Do they make a little squeaky sound when they’re dropped?
---
I see what you did there
---
If it has enough votes it could be a reality ;)
---
Daddy Pride!
---
Wheres the halloween medkit?
---
Dead hard if you know how to loop.
---
We can only hope so.
---
I think his perks should be high risk high reward obsession perks
---
I seriously hate these splinters man.  If I have every killer unlocked why do I still get them?  Makes me not even want to risk the Ultra Rare mystery boxes.
---
I keep getting them lmao
---
the worst part is healing when someone with nurses or bbq removes a stack and you know the person you're healing is being seen... at the very least it should hide someone you're touching
---
I've seen some stills from the movie and can recognize the actor's face. I know they don't have his likeness but God damn does DBD Quentin looks like he just got done with radiation therapy while Kyle Gallner just looks tired.
---
It's really hard to tell when people are joking on the internet. 
---
For what it's worth though I do agree that it is a matter of mindset. 
---
However, if someone legitimately feels entitled enough to think that they deserve respect for the 4 percent, then there's a problem.
---
What am I looking at?
---
"DS is bad"
---
"C*ntress"... that's actually pretty good.
---
me and my brother say he makes noises like a car trying to start
---
Can confirm, even after having bought Leatherface I still see stupid bone splinters in my Bloodwebs.
---
omg that's really clever
---
Playing as surv on PS4 I keep getting games where I'm immediately disconnected from a lobby that never even loads, with a message saying "the game you are joining isn't available anymore". 
---
Had 5 in a row that did that, am I just unlucky or is it a bug?
---
&gt; if someone legitimately feels entitled enough to think that they deserve respect for the 4 percent, then there's a problem.
---
it's not like the survivor as the choice ? why do you bring that in the discussion ? what is said in the end chat as no influence on the gameplay.
---
The 4% respect is completely on the killer hands. When the concerned survivor cry about the fact you didn't respect it it's too late.
---
Their hands are definitely tied on that one. Liscensing agreements are usually very exact and strict about what they allow
---
I know this is a meme and all, but what is genrushing? I'm a killer main and when I see a lot of gens pop then I just know that they are doing the objectives and I need to play more defensive
---
If anything the party starters should be higher than the firecrackers since the firecrackers are much larger and more obvious in your hand, making it more likely the killer notices you have them.
---
Did you make a new account just to feel good about yourself? Patethic
---
Isn't that the guy from dark souls
---
Splinters. They let you play as a dlc killer for one round
---
What do you mean Boob3 doesn't look like Nea???
---
It’s a great fan base till your on a dev livestream or within 100m of a hooked Claudette.
---
They said that they want struggling on the hook to be an uncomfortable experience.
---
BBQ for those extra points that they will need because they camped. Honestly once you realize its a cannibal assume camping and then just rush those generators down. You should have all 5 completed by time the person on the hook dies. If your lucky the doors spawned a considerable distance away from the hooked person. If this is not the case enter stealth mode and worse case scenario only 1 other person will die. A 4k should never happen when the Cannibal is camping. The best he should ever have is 2 kills. One at the start of the match and the other a sacrifice while the other two open the gate.
---
I think this happends when you buy the killer with auric cells
---
I call him chuckles
---
Imagine how bad that shit would smell on you head if you where Amanda
---
Im all ears should trigger on slow actions outside your Terror radius about with the same, or maybe increased cool down
---
Tremors needs to block the gens way longer. 16 seconds is almost over when you Reach the hook
---
agreed on Furitive Chase, it doesnt help much when it reduces your tr inside the Chase
---
Bunny Mom &lt;3
---
Well... That's what happens after drugs overusage and sleep deprivation I guess
---
This just gave me some nostalgic flashbacks to [this.](https://youtu.be/V46KYxFav24?t=104)
---
ah shit, here we go again.
---
When I get a 4 flashlight lobby with an obvious SWF depip  squad, I pick leatherface on purpose to do just that. They want to ruin my game, I'll ruin theirs.
---
Yes it is, for every clip like this there are dozens of occurences of DS just being a dead perk.
---
idk some people say aiming is hard for them so I thought on console it is even harder for some people
---
DS saved me and my teammates plenty of times, love that good perk 😜
---
Adrenaline is my #1 pick. Then I choose between Dead Hard/MoM/DS/BT/Iron Will/Bond/Balanced Landing
---
Just saw your Instagram. Better a "stupid" tattoo than that dumbfuck face you got.
---
I didn't use Adrenaline for a year because I thought it wasn't helpful, two weeks ago I started using it and it has saved my ass lots of times
---
I'm not sure why you are getting down voted. DS is an anti tunneling perk now and it has still saved the ass of a bunch of survivors since the rework.
---
Nothing to fix? Yes there is... Just add a timer like most MOBA games do if you DC once a match starts.
---
If you leave a game in progress you can't re-queue or start a private game until say, 20 minutes pass. Leave enough games (say you leave 5 of your last 10) and get softbanned for a bit.
---
If you really want to "move on" that badly, instead of disconnecting, just go find the killer and ask them politely to hook you. I'm sure they'll oblige. You're going to ruin the game *anyway*
---
Well on my Clown I run Coulrophobia, distressing,nurses calling and Sloppy butcher, only running distressing because Coulrophobia is only useful if you have a big terror radius. It's a pretty good anti healing build because no one heals unless they want to waste like a minute and a half.
---
Hex:Huntress Lullaby, Overcharge, Unnerving Presence, Distressing as perks, "Calm"- Carter's Notes and Iridescent King as add-ons and a The Game map offering.
---
They could simply update it to have 3 perks to choose from instead of 2, that would make it so much better
---
Show bob and vagene
---
Not a rule. 
---
Also not a rule. 
---
The only person breaking community guidelines here is you.
---
You know what? Because if this meme, I'm bringring Kindred in my next match.
---
Pester the mods enough and it will be. Draw enough attention to it with posts like these and it will be.  
---
I mean, what else would the mods do? Ban us for not putting up with scummy art theft in the name of fake Internet points? Fighting this fight is an assured win.
---
How dare you reveal me, the head on gamer, here to attempt to save you
---
A friend of mine hasn't replaced Unbreakable since she got it. It saves her ass at least once or twice each night we play. All a matter of playstyle
---
He isnt new to reddit when he claims he is posting to gain karma, he clearly isnt new
---
And what I did was call op out for not even bothering to search for the artist, I shouldnt have to do his job, if you cant credit the artist tou shouldnt even be posting his art its as simple as that
---
I personally like playing him for fun
---
So you mean even if I buy a killier I can't use him without a splinter? I was considering buying one but....what's point if I can't use him at free will?
---
No it means if you don't own the killer you can play as them for a round
---
We're left to wonder why  
---
He left us all  
---
#BEHIND
---
building both and nothing else is so meta, I almost escape 1/4 games! (no, I actually did this)
---
So you don't want to help them because it's not your job, but have no problem attacking them instead? Your mentality is not going to make this community better.
---
Can we stop bitching when other people bitching about bitching? They’re never going to stop so there is literally no point.
---
Kate, obviously
---
How did he get a skill check when the killer picked him up. Is that a perk or chance?
---
dEciSiVe sTriKe iS ruInEd
---
I Love it.
---
no, you have to get leatherface to lv 35 and then you can have to get it in the bloodweb like any other perk, in other words, by luck.
---
You could get it at the first bloodweb or you can get it after more than 50 lvls. it's somewhat luck, but if you don't fill the bloodweb with useless crap like the huntress' or agitation or so on, it becomes a little bit easier for you to get em.
---
clearly he outplayed you here
---
I've always wondered how it looks to the killer if the person you're healing has it but you don't. But yeah I agree
---
Wish we could get Nancy and a Englund skin.
---
*rawr*
---
They asked about it in the satisfaction survey, so we might get it soon(TM). I'd personally love seeing an in-game stats tracker.
---
Soon, I know they want to prepare some stuff.
---
Ah cool! Thanks for that info. I'm sure it's in their plan, but I assume a lot of other things are taking priority at the moment.
---
yeap, all of him ;).
---
It's ironic isn't it? The king of BBQ and Chili is the face of camping.
---
Yeah...you keep talking bitch ass NOED user. You're one to talk.
---
Thanks
---
Maybe you'll find out if you stop yelling
---
The hook tech is underrated, I love you
---
That's a huge hitbox ;)
---
*the meme is "oh how the turntables"*
---
Oh turn how table the have
---
Choosing whether you get slugged or not isn't a matter of your playstyle unless you're running sabo swf
---
You’ll still be able to see this, you just have to be far away (32 meters I think) and then Freddy will be invisible
---
Like... a singular certain person?
---
You're "not sure" why they're downvoted even though someone explained why in a comment posted an hour before yours?
---
huntress best
---
Best is when they cleanse haunted ground at the beginning and you get 1-3 easy stacks of DH
---
Why is Huntress still in top 3 ? Even Huntress mains like Scott Jund and Zubatlel agree that Spirit and Hag are better than Huntress.
---
I mean, it helps stall the game more than it would already but I honestly think it should start the timer the second its placed on the survivors head. Since it only ticks down to focus actions, it wont actually do anything if its activated in a chase or on a hook
---
I clearly disagree with that opinion, or I wouldn't have posted otherwise.
---
To be specific trappers name is "The miserable smiling killer"
---
Holy shit same, I hate, uhhh, that person?
---
*is it a person*
---
Jake wiggling is me when I'm taking a big and hard shit after 2 days without dumping
---
He doesn't deserve it
---
If I'm playing solo I tend to run adrenaline with deliverance instead of Autodidact and Poised. People have a tendency not to save me during the EGC and that unhook has come in handy quite often. I pretty much only play Adam and Jane
---
Spirit is very strong and super fun to play as. I also enjoy clown but not many others seem too!.
---
Username checks out
---
How is the wraith’s better than hillbilly’s? I mean, it’s almost exactly like trapper’s but horizontal.
---
Atleast wraith drags the survivor across the ground for a second. I mean they are both dog shit.
---
That’s exactly why they said they went with Quentin instead, because they couldn’t do 84 Nancy and the remake one just wasn’t the same
---
You dissing Spirit’s Mori? Also, while Doctors isn’t very exciting it does have cool effects. There is no way on this mortal plane that Doctor is ranked lower than Pig, who literally does the same thing as her base attack
---
Better solution
---
Don't tunnel the unhooked survivor
---
Honestly you just have to grind.
---
It depends... You want to have fun or you want to win? Also, are you playing on console or pc?
---
No not really but it is annoying after a while
---
One of her heads is a gas mask used to suffocate so i put on my gas mask and plugged up the breathing hole
---
The survivor actually defends and shit. Spirit is literally a exact copy of Freddy's.
---
I don't think they ever said they fixed it though.
---
They fixed some things that caused it to happen, but they didn't completely fix it.
---
No see she has cool warpy stuff
---
The Pig just stabs you tho so I mean
---
Ah thanks, didn't know that one.
---
I don’t, but there are *a lot* of killers that do
---
Plus there’s survivors that bodyblock the unhooked when they have bt and ds
---
*Drops jumpsuit*
---
Why yes, yes they do
---
Actually I wasn’t the one who downvoted that
---
Giraffe balls
---
You have to get Barbecue and Chili for killers and we're gonna live forever. If your only trying to level 2 characters, grinding to get these 2 perks won
---
t be the smartest option but once you get them, it's double bp every game.
---
Instead of nurse, declare yourself as a Chernobyl technician
---
Reactor 4?
---
ＤＡＲＮ
---
This isnt a good montage tho
---
Why dahell did you choose this song?? Its horrible
---
Also none of the clips are interesting
---
They all boring
---
It's godly for Myers. Also really good on Pig.
---
The fact that the hatch can and will spawn right under the killer isn’t “pretty balanced”
---
M&amp;A works with every killer, especially with Myers (in tier 1 he has no terror radius), and 110% killers like Hag and Spirit.
---
Myers hands down. M&amp;A makes his terror radius  in EW1 almost non existent
---
Myers and Freddy are my favorite killers for M&amp;A.
---
Just don’t use it on the doctor it will negatively affect his static field!
---
Honestly just take the two very rare instaheals u less you don’t use medkits
---
We need this in the game
---
Huntress is by far the best in my opinion. Her hum can make survivors assume she's a lot farther than she really is combined with a lower terror radius.
---
Other killers that benefit: 
---
Any 110 movement speed killer
---
Legion benefits greatly too. Old legion relied on his relatively small terror radius to sneak up and get a successful frenzy. Its not impossible to get a successful frenzy by any means but the lowered terror radius does help.
---
Cannibal slightly benefits but its not recommended as it probably won't do anything because that killer is hot garbage
---
Killers that get debuffed from monitor:
---
Spirit. Her vacuum warning sound happens only outside of her terror radius. So decreasing it would only make things harder for her.
---
 Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
---

And a mix of both would be neat but I guess I'm more focused on having fun. Sweating in comp games used to bring a lot of stress before.
---
This dudes a fucking genius why didn’t we think of this?
---
I’m pretty sure even if he has a tiny it’s Borsky fragment of hitbox in his view he can stalk. Unless the stalking mechanic just tests through obstacles
---
Michael is my favorite, too! And I'll be sure to get more later on of Jason and some others! Thank you so much c:
---
It's definitely NOT an exact copy of Freddy. Spirit hits you with the katana on the ground several times and then screams at you. Freddy just impales you with his gloves.
---
I hear they sell these things in stores, but don't quote me on that.
---
The mods of this sub are a joke. Goodluck getting anything done. Maybe we should petition to have new mods and have the old ones step down.
---
I've always hated that phrase. First off, with all the different powers, add-ons, and time management to worry about, Killer is easily more than half the game. But this isn't about that. For my point, let's agree with you and say it is half.
---
Imagine a game broken into two halves. You find one half very fun, engaging, and skillful. You're very, very good at this half, and play it all the time. The other half, you find boring, frustrating, or just outright infuriating. Let's call this theoretical game "Dead by Daylight".
---
Why would you ever choose to play the half you have significantly less fun in and enjoy a lot less than the other half? If you **really** enjoy one half of the game to hell and back, I'd say you have full rights to only play 50% of that game. I'm sure a lot of people like that would enjoy it as if it was 100% of the game regardless.
---
The only thing Ghostface is top tier at besides cosmetically
---
On every killer, being able to get 8m closer to survivor before they notice is no bad at all. But I think is better with killers that does not have the default 32m terror radius
---
Yeah. Its too bad. Maybe we'll get Ghost Face next year!
---
Yeah, another friend recommended spirit and I do enjoy her lore.. I'll probably end up getting her.
---
IDK too much about clown tho.. but from the gameplay I've seen he looks like a good crowd control character.
---
It's bad on Spirit because you want to have a larger terror radius.
---
Is this bait
---
I've fallen for that far too many times. But this time.. This time I shall definitely fall for it again.
---
BBQ &amp; Chili on your best killer.

I guess you play chainsaw boi. Unless the rest of the bloodweb is good

You know when the killer is really down for the count. After stunning the killer with a pallet or blinding them with a flashlight, gain a 150% haste status effect for three seconds. Causes the exhaustion status effect for 60/50/40 seconds. 
---
*Careful... this is the moment when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life, for one last scare. -Randy Meeks*
---
Are those perks and if so how do i get them shrine or bloodweb
---
Myers,leatherface,hillbilly(to some degree),hag,nurse,freddy(because of his Power) and maybe huntress(kinda of) mostly ambush type killers that dont have stealth that can take their terror radius away basicaly any killer that isn't the doctor but the ones that mentioned at the beginning are the ones that benefit the most from monitor and abuse
---
That belongs to the Bing Bong boi
---
i think Freddy, Myers and Hag benefit most from M&amp;A, i wouldn't recommend using it on Huntress, Wraith or Spirit since it's pointless
---
Can we stop bitching on Reddit?
---
BBQ &amp; Chili is a Cannibal teachable perk, it's a must if you want to grind bloodpoints.
---
Ooooo everyone watch out for u/DripTooHard5 he threatens people on the internet better be careful
---
lol
---
Getting Bubba is almost a must for his BBQ &amp; Chili perk.  
---
Other than that, I recommend the Spirit and Hag DLCs.
---
So am I his perks aren't broken but they aren't useless either. Their is really no reason to rework Quintin plenty of survivors are literally the hostess wrapper in my garbage can
---
switch Spirit and Myers and i'll be fine with it
---
Ok but this is so sad. Two of the most useless perks in the same bloodweb.
---
Or this is just a pick of you in a gas mask.
---
Why would anyone teabag ducks
---
Oof
---
This. BBQ and Chilli will help you rank all your killers up. If you unlock it in your bloodweb ASAP it’s more likely your other killers will get it too.
---
They’re mad about whispers? Are you kidding me?
---
No. They DON'T hear the woosh in your terror radius. Therefore, a smaller one means they can more easily tell when you're phasing.
---
RIP Cows.  
---
Banned from the live game because of an exploit in the PTB.
---
We will miss you.
---
The description says that she leaves a woosh in the spot she is moving, except if you are in her TR. Doesn't that mean that if you are repairing and she has a smaller TR, you will hear less woosh?
---
I don't get it.
---
She has a head where its a gas mask that suffocates her and im covering up the breathing hole suffocating me
---
Everytime A survivor hooks the killer you see the killers aura for 5 seconds. Additionally you gain a stack, each stack grants 25% bloodpoints in the survival category, up to 100%. Bloodpoints are rewarded post trial.

This made my day, thank you!

You need to know that you can buy some characters with the currency of the game, but there are others that you can only get with real money, and those are characters from movies. It depends on the number of games you play per day, you could get new characters with certain regularity thanks to the game currency, and pay with money for movie characters. Anyway, I recommend watching gameplays of how each killer is played and decide which ones are the most fun to use.
---
If by chance the strongest killers seem fun to you it would be the best of both worlds, for example Nurse is the best killer BY FAR, but she would not be easy to use at all, she will give you a lot of stress. Then (in no particular order) Hillbilly, Spirit and Huntress (maybe Plague too...)
---
Also, a meta perk you need to use almost always is Ruin (one of The Hag teachable perks). Barbecue and chilli (Leatherface teachable perk) would be nice too, you get more points and it's an okay perk to find survivors
---
You were in plain sight, right in front of her...
---
A kobe would be across the map or something where she has to actually arc the shot.
---
Billy does not have to somewhat aim that mf’s chainsaw got a hit box the size of a pallet
---
I think splinter is referring to A memory. Seeing as all of this is fabricated by the entity using their memories. As far as glass, no idea.
---
Actually I don't find the power of the spirit THAT difficult to use (playing in red ranks)
---
Yea it is pretty rare because to get it you'd firstly have to have a killer that is pretty bad or doesn't care to hit you or chase you, and even if he chases you he loses you without being able to get anything going. Then you'd also need a team that does nothing besides go down and get hooked while you rescue and/or heal them.
---
I have almost all perks on my Ace yet still no sight of Balanced Landing, I want to take the cheap stuff
---
Just play as killer if you don’t have any boughten I’d go with doctor I’m strictly survivor and use him to farm bp whenever I wanna it’s pretty easy just make sure you fill up your stacks and try to get people on hooks as quickly as possible
---
yea okay shut the fuck up what do i call you? mister mememaster? yea no please get the fuck off
---
It is, and increasingly as your rank "improves"
---
Lmaooooo
---
Sure you can't decide whether or not you'll get slugged, but playstyle is also a lot about what you know you're good at, how well you're communicating with your team (as mentioned, we're SWF), and really for a lot of people what kind of situations they want to avoid in a game.
---
She hates being slugged, and it does happen to her frequently. She's really not asking for it with her playstyle, maybe she's just unlucky. But she hates it, and often asks us to stick to gens or go help other people while she's taking care of herself with Unbreakable. It works for her.
---
It’s so hard to not run BBQ with the extra BP rewarded on top of the already good information it provides
---
You want him to get off? Ewww
---
I don’t want anything like a literal ghost, but I know people say they want like alien or predator or that stuff. I always say that’s cool, but we all know that making perks for them would be hard. I think humans have easier perks to make up because they’re not over the top complicated. I wouldn’t mind seeing non humans though for something new
---
Lmao - no, I'm just looking for other advice. See if I'm missing something.
---
Because lord knows teammates like that sure as shit aren't *anywhere* to be seen the second you decide to play Survivor.
---
Or when you always hear it, but never hear a heartbeat
---
Only because of bad experiences though. In low ranks people flock to the hooked person, leaving nobody on the gens, so I fill that role.
---
Respect the * D A R N *
---
This is what I run with the exception of BBQ for SB because of BPs. Otherwise, I’d run this exact build.
---
I made this post whilst spending an obscene amount of time in lobbies btw o\_O

See, now with this outfit, I wouldn't mind being spotted at a distance as ol' Rin. I love it!

If it makes you feel better these kids are almost certainly disliked by or unkown to almost everyone they go to school with.  They're just acting out and funneling their frustration onto 'teh rand0m' to make themselves feel better.  IMO kinda sad all around, but understanding where behavior like that comes from helps ignore it.
---
if you pull yourself off the hook its called a "kobe" because of the way youre jumping off the hook.
---
I want a killer that lore-wise, comes from the future. Nothing too too crazy, but something 50-100 years out would be pretty cool to see BHVR's interpretation of.
---
Ok please stop using the word impossible because it really bugs me when people in this community use it.
---
I have seen multiple people escape through endgame collapse to the point where it's not even funny.
---
Also don't capitalise in when it's clearly not the case because it makes it seem more like you just flashing out that word to make your argument seem more prevalent even though that couldn't be further from the truth.
---
I feel like people need to stop confusing really difficult and impossible together. The same thing happened when people were talking about trying to completea gen by yourself to make hatch spawn despite that the fact it's been done multiple times.
---
When I saw this in the video I was laughing for 5 minutes straight
---
That's a nice one but I still like mine because I don't have to hit several different buttons or anything
---
Why do you provide proof? Im mean its your argument.
---
The flaming barrels no longer hide you, they power her!
---
Yeah. The killer was kinda bad, and hit me one or two times, but always disengaged after I pallet stunned him. Idk why, but they did.
---
No, it’s not balanced solo at all. The fact that the hatch can and will spawn under the killer or under the survivor (which never happens)  it shouldn’t it should spawn at a middle point between both. The survivor HAS TO sneak around to find the hatch the killer doesn’t have to do that he can sprint around the map trying to find it. And now that killers can and will camp the hatch and not close it is the new hatch stand offs the killer should not have priority to close the hatch as a survivor is jumping in.
---
He couldnt see me, unless he has some config installed which make his game look like a crap.
---
Just run slippery meat tbh
---
It didn't trigger me too much, it was just the first time I'd ever recorded it happen to me. My friend was running the killer around so they could save me too
---
Freddy's mori is much shittier than spirits. at least spirit knocks survivors to the ground and stab thems to the side 3 times
---
I think he stalked your team mate..you can hear her still repairing :/
---
Myers's mori is too bugged to be good. Btw what is Doctor doing so low? he has like one of the best moris :/
---
Nurse blinks over to a survivor and hits them. Spirits entire ability is based off of mind gaming. In which she can’t see the survivor. Unlike nurse. Both are difficult as a bad nurse will likely miss every blink and swing. However once mastering Nurse you are almost guaranteed  to win. I main the top 3 killers I listed because I most enjoy high skill cap high reward killers. And you can take it from me that mastering Spirit isn’t the hardcore “always in a chase constantly and ending it within seconds” gameplay Nurse is. Nurse is very hard indeed. It’s a battle between the survivors skill and my skill. But Spirit isn’t that. Spirit is a high tier killer, and as such her gameplay will relatively be mostly ending chases quickly as well as going from hook to chase quickly as well. But she will never end chases as quickly as nurse. EVER. Because she is still a m1 killer. Even with the ability being as good as it is she still has to suffer the speed boost survivors get and the hit cooldown. Nurse of course has fatigue. But fatigue is nothing to a good nurse.
---
You don't
---
The best strategy is to hide because she moves slow AF, but with 2 correction blinks its basically impossible for her to miss unless shes a noob.
---
Funny how you point that out instead of acknowledging the fact that the other person's sarcasm went right over your head very ironically.
---
Will-os-wisp should be S tier because of the cute ghost
---
Thanks very helpful!
---
They probably think they are *sooooo* funny. I hope you reported them
---
Hey everyone, this video is a tad long but it's my first guide. It's meant for all the new killers out there, especially Trapper. Let me know if you habe any criticisms :) and sorry for mic quality, I'm a budget gamer :p
---
We’ll make it instead of dark sense
---
Everyone is saying what the trapper is.
---
Nobody is asking *how* the trapper is.
---
why are the firecrackers at different tiers? they are literally the same thing
---
Tru3 begs to differ.
---
Immediately thought of a Flame Atronach
---
its doesnt make it almost non existent. it makes it FULLY non existent
---
Then how else are we supposed to escape a killer's grasp if they take too long to reach a hook. Struggling is a literal counter to being downed. If you don't like it, have fun dying early in game.
---
Didn't think about that, but this is a concept so anything can be changed. I forgot his finger ring too.
---
it makes it so the killer doesnt bring you to the basement from anywhere in the map. and if someone is bodyblocking for you, it’d be pointless then
---
I hate DbD's grinding. A progression system is good, but there's way too much grinding in this game, especially on survivor.
---
Glad to hear it didn't phase you - trolling/toxic teammates is one of the only things that still gets to me in this game.  Even though I know why they're doing it, it's still frustrating to deal with.
---
I think they mean struggling on the hook? Not sure tho
---
The devs have stated I believe that they want all their killers to be humanoid (which they are), so I'm not sure what the limits are.
---
At least he has a good mori and cosmetics.
---
Make your choice, monitor and abuse, bbq&amp;chili, nurse’s calling
---
My brain hurt trying to read that
---
Everyone actually. But  
---
Michael Myers with Dead Rabbit (jumpscares guaranteed)  
---
Hag (she's hard to see as well)  
---
Ninja Doctor (both best calm addons and you walk in punishment with 12m TR or less, don't remember)  
---
Plague (easy first puke, if they don't use fountain ez oneshot, if they do, easy blood puke)  
---
Freddy (hit &amp; run with 115%ms and 16m TR)  
---
Nurse with Nurse's calling (they heal outside your TR and you can blink to them immedietaly)  
---
One shot killers like Bubba or Billy may do too
---
I love M&amp;A so I can use it on everyone :D
---
Oh definitely, the 2010 remake is just all around bad
---
That's basically it. Doing gens instead of hunting totems, opening boxes or finding the killer to waste his time and blind him.
---
Nurse does play a lot of mindgames, for example if you lose LOS with a survivor you have to predict what they're going to do.
---
I fart laughed at this.
---
Looping a nurse omegalul
---
those instaheals i nutted
---
Edgy.
---
I’m really happy that Amanda is getting a skin and that Freddy is finally getting a well deserved rework :p
---
If you could tell us how the cosmetics looked like it would help
---
yes that's what i mean
---
oh god dwight watch out freddy doesnt have free candy in there oh god oh fuck he cant hear us he has airpods in
---
They literally take the skill out of the game and pretty much just carry bad players or make good players almost unbeatable. Not fun for both sides so yeah, I guess it would be a good idea to do something about them.
---
Favourites: Clown and Wraith.
---
Most hated: Spirit and Hag.
---
So you are telling me that Waterlogged Shoe, Black Box, Amanda's Letter, Rules Set No 2, Fuming Mix Tape, Tattoo's Middle Finger and Iridescent Seal make the game unbalanced for you ? Majority of UR's are weak AF or mediocre at best, while the real unbalanced add-ons aren't even ultra rare add-ons ( Omega Blink Nurse, Instant Saw Billy, Prayer Beads Spirit ).
---
If we talk about Instant Heals and Moris, then yeah, they deserve to be removed.
---
Looks incredible! Did you do the mask yourself or did you buy it somewhere?
---
He means hook struggling
---
A pirate
---
Yeah same problem man, gotta get my daily’s in
---
wow my braincells are gone
---
Just have to get good timing. It’s possible, really really hard, but possible.
---
My mentality with this game is just this. You will not always win, that’s where the salt comes from on both sides, everyone wants the win every time. The state the game is in now, expect the L focus on having fun instead. I know playing killer I’ve even found the hatch and patrolled the gates, survivor still escaped, I’ve been the survivor that got ran into the EGC too. It’s all about luck honestly and killer skill level as well as your skill level. I still lose quit abit but I’m learning and getting better and I think that’s really what the community needs to focus on. Sorry I kind of ranted. Like I said it’s all luck really
---
Well that's a possibility but even if they mean the hook if you don't struggle a player is killed and the others wouldn't have a chance to save during the second stage.
---
Haven’t played in a few months. Not sure if I get it. I know how it looked beforehand.
---
What’s changed?
---
Well how else are salty people supposed to kill themselves? ;)
---
this picture is upsetting /s
---
That's not a mind game. That's prediction. The mind game aspect of nurse comes more for the survivor side. Where they try to get you to over blink or blink to a location you don't actually plan on going to.
---
I have a friend that unironically believes he’s balanced if not high tier because he has a built in one shot
---
A werewolf would be cool. Make him similar to the Hillbilly with some kind of sprint and slash ability. Make perks involving bloodlust, silver, the moon, etc. Possibly even make it two characters in one with some kind of transform ability.
---
Lithe and Alert
---
There really isn't anything you can do, I've experienced this as survivor and as killer. As killer I nearly always get the 4k if egc triggers, as survivor I rarely escape. (Only when the hatch is closed of course)
---
Imagine being mad over a game, strange world
---
You really only have 2 options besides flipping the coin on hatch.
---
1.  You don’t look for hatch and wait by an exit gate.  When the killer finds the hatch and closes it you start opening immediately and hope they’re far enough away and/or they check the other gate first.  It’s not likely but it can work.
---
2. My usual method.  If the gates are far enough apart and the killer isn’t billy/nurse/high mobility, wait by an exit gate and wait for them to check that gate and leave.  After they leave you can either power it up to about 15% and back off and wait for another round or just go straight for it depending on time.  The first red light doesn’t appear right away on the door so if you power it up slightly and wait for them to leave again there’s a decent chance you can get it, but still it’s difficult.
---
plus she might not speak english as a first language, i have no idea because i dont watch her. maybe she isnt at great at public speaking with english.
---
That is a toy xD i used it myself
---
That’s an old screenshot isn’t it.......
---
He always seems so sad
---
I mean she has a thick accent, but other than that she's a pretty enjoyable person. I'm not to sure if I understand what you mean by "super awkward" either, that sounds like a you thing my man
---
Damn that's nasty !
---
whispers is a very good perk depending on what killer you’re running. its good at the beginning , and when theres one left.
---
I appreciate your opinion, even if it’s different from mine. So here, take my upvote
---
Nice call. This could be really fun.
---
I cringe when Mcote talks more. He seems like a swell dude but he is just not good at public speaking.
---
No, literally nobody. She gets the information out that she needs to. Idk why you'd get uncomfortable, but is seems like an issue with YOU, not her.
---
A Legion brought me to the hatch today :)
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/464A521
---
She's on my shower curtain too!
---
I played a few rounds of DbD with an old friend that I've not spoken to in a while. It was nice. Made me happy :)
---
Who do you tend to play, because that changes your playstyle a lot.
---
Some basic tips though are to
---
A.) Practice mindgaming survivors 
---
B.) Learn to follow scratch marks and blood, no matter how unreliable they can be, it helps some
---
C.) Learn sounds, such as if a gen is being worked on, footsteps, things like that
---
The changes are probably for the best, but I’ll always miss watching survivors panic when I hold m2
---
Play with billy, he is kind of easy to use and you can make preassure map, also the option of instadown. And whispers or spies from the shadows is good for those moments with 2 people
---
Wake up combined with spine chill helps.
---
You should change your Reddit name to Mr. Ironic   XD in just joking, the community is one of my favorites, most of the time :p
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
Really had to stretch the situation for this meme.
---
lmaoo i regret this name sometimes 💀 but yea this community can be nice
---
That used to be how it was done, however I do think in the case of vigil they should bring it back with a slight decrease in speed. perhaps have exhaustion recover at 10/20/30% speed while running.
---
It's still something, but not totally crazy like back in the day
---
It’s not all that hard if your rank is low. Green/purple gets a bit more difficult, and in red ranks it’s as rare as a non immersed Claudette
---
I'm not trying to advertise myself, but I just made a video that may help you. Trapper is the best killer to learn killer imo, and the build I use isn't that perk reliant because I barely use most of the perks all game :) https://youtu.be/V3xFD0JdOh4
---
1 Spirit isn't so hard when sounds aren't broken ( and sounds won't be broken anymore in the next patch ) against people without Iron Will. Against good survivors with Iron Will and who know how to juke, yeah, she becomes a lot harder, because now you need to predict them and read their jukes, but again, she doesn't have the highest skill ceilling. Sometimes, you can outplay people as Spirit by just standing still and that doesn't require skill at all.
---
2 Huntress has the highest skill ceilling in the game : she needs aim, timing, prediction, knowledge of hit boxes and loops, she is the hardest killer in the game. Even if you master her, she still will suffer on majority of the maps or against immersed survivors, she really isn't as rewarding as she should be.
---
3 I talk with people who said that Hag has a higher skill ceilling than Nurse and these people were Nurse mains before becoming Hag mains.
---
4 Plague should be at standard skill required.
---
5 Pig should be at sorta has to predict, because she needs that with her Ambush at loops.
---
I absolutely agree:)
---
Id like to see some type of undead. Zombie, vampire, etc.
---
The entire DBD team is really awkward on stage, so yeah I agree with you on this.
---
I don’t really see what the situation from the show has to do with anything, considering more than half the people on this sub haven’t even watched the show. I used it because it literally looks like he’s standing behind / inside one of the hanging beef racks in the game.  Stay groovy.
---
Lol nope, taken like an hour ago
---
You &lt;3
---
Knockout freddy, class photo freddy... Im really going to miss them.
---
i think she does a pretty good job so far
---
i'm a weeb but my Legion is a red colored Frank with a mask that has an X instead of that dumb smiley so that people KNOW i am not like those other Legions
---
I almost got a double pip. I got a survivor out of the game with 3 gens left
---
It was one of those with the trucks in the middle out the map, he didn't have the add-ons and I play trapper and know it would've been better to just get rid of the pallet than to place a trap that I can disarm later and restart the loop
---
Lol good luck winning with that after the Feng Min design the other day
---
As far as killers go, Im trying to see who I excel with. So far the huntress and doctor have been going well. The hag is rough but i can do well with hex ruin in the early game. Been trying out the plauge as well and i think i need a few perks for her to be very viable.
---
Having fun playing all of the killers though. I also live a camp free life.
---
&gt;Do you at least tunnel?
---
Imagine not metaphorically killing yourself for a persona
---
*this post was brought to you by SEES, cowards*
---
Its ok i was just looking through videos before i came here. Most people just say the same generic things l, so i came to this horrible community of mutants to get some advice.
---
exactly why survivors are to overpowered they need to change devicsive to 3 seconds
---
Also ich finde ihn schon sehr geil da die Überlebenden einfach nicht Stealthy sein können aber man muss mit ihm umgehen können :D
---
Where country you from?
---
In my opinion his changes will make him a lot stronger from the looks of it his kit will be a bit more complex but also much more versatile and in general I think he'll be a lot easier to balance than he is at the moment this does mean that you'll have to re learn him though which sucks.
---
Is that a teachable? I have very little T perks unlocked for all killers.
---
I remember my first time playing against him, and I didn't know how he worked. My friends and I screamed so much we could barely escape.
---
Small game for finding the totem and stake out for the gens
---
Sadly somehow i suck with billy. Im more of a doctor kind of guy.
---
Anything else?
---
Neat
---
Not even all sniper rifles in the world can be more acurate

Small Game and Detective's Hunch to find the totem and Stake Out for skill checks. But you need neither of them to counter Ruin once you learn totems spawns/how to hit great skill checks.

Hi, MoMa - I would like to submit the best, latest work of art from the Internet.
---
Hey, man. At the end of the day, you literally paid for a tattoo that has a far as a deep meaning as shit on a stick. 
---
With your deluded judgement on things, I’m not surprised you think I’m ugly.
---
Just think about it, you got a horrible tattoo for the rest of your life, posted it on reddit for clout, and didn’t get the response you wanted so you got your high horse and cried about it.
---
It’s understandable to get upset over a Mori, but literally threatening you and telling you to strangle your cat (which you may or may not even have)? That’s literally pathetic
---
Susie is also 16 so for Americans she ain't legal(well most of America)
---
How to hit great skill checks? Is there a trick?
---
A lot of killers are underpowered right now, not just Legion.
---
as a pig main, i feel this... every time i run non meta stuff i get stomped on ;-;
---
Great artwork :D
---
I agree, it took me awhile to get the hang of it when i started. Scott Jungs (DamnNoHtml) videos on YouTubeelped me out a ton. You could always check him out too. The biggest advice anyone can give is keep practicing and don't get discouraged :) you are off to a good start thou because you know how survivors think ;)
---
I honestly thought you were snaring in a big puddle of milk
---
I actually quite enjoyed that. You seem pretty chill and like a decent player
---
He'll be able to teleport to generators, and place traps that slow sleeping survivors, giving him a lot more power and control ingame, and not have to worry about not being able to attack until they're asleep. Sleeping survivors simply give him more advantages than being able to attack them.
---
Tunneling is when you kill the same person after they are freed from the hook and focus on them for the rest of the game until they get sacrificed
---
Never discouraged, not a competetive game for me , just having fun and ruining those asshole survivors that think theyre slick ;)
---
See? I'm already getting salt. Lol
---
Depends how you want to play.

---
Healer Tank Damage Dealer? Bond, Dead Hard, Self Care, Spine Chill
---
Props to those who get the reference
---
That scene in the show made me cringe way too hard "get that dick off of my face" 😂
---
Yeah because she is the stealthiest making her hard to see so she could hide if she messes up a skill check and once she gets semi decent at it she should move on to Meg as she has better perks for dealing with chases etc.
---
I prefer the idea of trading in shit you don’t want for bp 
---
it would be v nice though
---
I wanna tombstone him
---
No.
---
New pasta, old pasta doesn’t matter I’ll eat it
---
Ooooo tongue twisters
---
Do you play pokemon alot? Haha
---
Hag is def fun i just need to level her up i feel. I only have her at level 8 and would like yo unlock her teachable asap.
---
DS is a great anti tunnel perk and it can get used almost every game. Borrowed time/Deliverance is also good for another slot if you plan on making a lot of saves. One of those perks that can be a game changer. Your favorite exhaustion perk, I prefer dead hard or balanced. And finally adrenaline. You can try throwing in WGLF if you want more blood points. I'd personally try and steer clear of self care. The reduced heal time makes the perk a trap perk IMO, and it's almost always better to bring a medkit or at least just find a teammate to heal you
---
Shattered Bloodline is the best DLC.
---
At least Clowns legal
---
in that case nah
---
but i will eventually have to get that person later so yah, i guess i'm the same as all Legions, whoops
---
Wow if Dale Gribble was in Borderlands. Love the idea.
---
Best trick I can find is either practicing it as much as you can, or focusing very hard on the great skill check zone. The second you hear the skill check noise, locate the tiny great skill check zone and stare at it. Try hitting greats even without ruin
---
I almost never miss good skillchecks fortunately but i am too scared to try great due to failing and revealing location
---
Freddy is really easy to run around with, learning to loop is the best way to do so. When your away from Freddy find another teammate that's awake or find a generator and fail a skill check to wake yourself up. When doing this make sure there is a safe window or pallet invade Freddy returns.
---
Are you new? You have a higher chance of getting all of them by not tunnelling. Gradually getting each of them bit by bit is much more easy and efficient than mUSt hIT iNJUr3d plAY3r it’Z v3rY l0gicAL
---
Dude, same. I honestly can’t believe they got away with airing that on TV 🤣😭
---
I love it
---
Lmao
---
All that matters to me is not putting my money in the pocket of a man who filmed himself raping a 12 year old boy he was entrusted with directing in a feature film.
---
Good point! I hope she gets lucky in her blood web and gets we’ll make it with spine chill early if she decides to use Meg since she won’t have a lot of perks
---
I am more of a player who likes to get chased and also do gens. I pretty much like to do everything. I am forced to do that because I am rank, it’s the only way to pip.
---
I just need a new build.
---
Her teachables are really good. Tip though, dont run ruin with devour. 
---
I have an ongoing joke where I constantly make cat puns, so I changed my autocorrect for it. Such as you to mew
---
I hit 6/11 of these points oh god oh fuck
---
This reminds me a lot of Te Kā. Nicely done!
---
It’s satire and irony
---
David is pretty tall and noticeable in this game that’s true. Empathy isn’t praised enough that’s for sure.

Best killer to start with ? Leatherface (if you are willing to buy him) or The Trapper  
---
Leatherface because his power is simple and effective, but more so because of BBQ. That perk will immensely help grind bloodpoints so you can get stuff faster for other killers. If you don't want to buy him, Trapper is a good guy to start with too, with his power letting you skip chases entirely.  
---
Tips for a beginner:  
---
\- Don't get tilted and remember to have fun. Killer is 4 times more fun than the survivor, so don't let these pesky sacrifices ruin it for you.  
---
\- At the start of the match, it's most of the time a good idea to go to the generator that is on the other side of the map from you. High chances to find survivors there.  
---
\- Don't jump from killer to killer, pick one and stick with him, preferably until you get all of his teachables, so you have a reliable killer you know how to use when you need bloodpoints for low-lvl killers.  
---
Tracking Advice:  
---
\- Use Headphones. Really.  
---
\- Remember all those noises that your survivor makes, like footsteps while walking, breathing, and rustling through grass when you are in it ? *You can hear it as the Killer too.*  
---
\- Noise and scratchmarks are going to be your best bets when looking for healthy survivors. Noise and blood stains are going to help you with injured ones.  
---
\- If you are near a somewhat repaired generator that is not regressing, chances are there are survivors around it. Spend 10 or so seconds and look around nearest cover.  
---
Hope it helps you. May the Entity bless you with many Mori-s.
---
Yeah even trading it for half the value of the BP is fine with me, just want to unclutter my inventory with this feature.
---
I got Bubba, Hag and Spirit for now.
---
Thanks for your advice, friends.
---
What’s a good perk build for every category? 
---
In a match I usually do 2 gens(maybe more), get chased, and save other for altruism. 
---
I’m going to start running decisive because of the people who tunnel and WGLF because I’m not earning enough BP. Thank you for the suggestion &lt;3
---
It honestly depends. If mew want to follow the Meta, that's what mew want to follow. That means things like dead hard, adrenaline, self care.
---
I personally run Were Gonna Live Forever/Alert, Well Make It, Adrenaline, and Lithe. Though I've been experimenting with builds for a bit
---
He is a swell dude look at his braces omiword
---
Here, take my second hand embarrassment at watching you try to be diplomatic
---
This. Not_queen is ironic name
---
They have to nerf it. I don’t like if survivor is of hook full state my noed is broken and should be buffed.
---
I thought it would be cool if it was a multi-Cenobite character. What are there ultimate goal?- PAIN GLORIOUS PAIN,  exp.- 
---
What you think of as pain is only a shadow. Pain has a face. Allow me to show it to you. Gentlemen, I... Am... Pain.- pinhead, he’s made for DBD, but I digress, 
---
The killer would just be called The Cenobite, Power Pain, start as the chatterer, the more damage/pain you inflict, you pain meter will rise once it’s full he pulls out THE BOX he has to complete skill check if completed the wall opens up and then enters another Cenobite, I thought mabey the mouth firing saw cds from hell raiser 3, b/c he would able to fire projectiles, acoustic pain, meter rises, play with the box &amp; ...   PINHEAD EMERGES. He could summon a chain to Damage/trap survivors, max pain meter again he can summon multiple chains that rip 1 survivors into chunks of flesh, Mori could be same, i dont know it’s just an idea
---
r/cursedcomments
---
LOL
---
Throwaway troll account... yeah but that was just a lucky play and both sides should've enjoyed it
---
Seems you play like me, so here's my build for you to consider, it's not a meta build and I play slightly immersed but it works and I got to red ranks with it. Exhaustion perk, Self Care, Spine Chill and the last one is whatever you feel you lack. I change the last one from time to time, if I feel like my team and I will be able to complete all the gens, I bring either Adrenaline or Poised. If I feel like I'm going to get chased a lot but don't know the map layouts, windows of opportunity, if I'm a Dwight, Prove Thyself, if I'm Nea, Urban Evasion. Tbh the first 3 are the only fixed ones for me because it helps me stay healthy for as long as possible and if I do get potato teammates, I can heal myself and wait for them to die and go for hatch.
---
Who cares
---
Ok go rent/buy the movies at least 1&amp;2 right now, it will improve everything, must see,
---
As a current Freddy main all I can hope for is that everyone likes his rework.  I don't really care for what they've revealed about it, so as much as I enjoy the character of Freddy Krueger I'm probably just going to go back to Doc while trying to figure out my Secondary Character crisis.
---
Who needs teammates when you got the hatch. 
---
As for the bug thing, never seen it. Sometimes they don’t scream, but I can still look over and see them.
---
It can work. I cant remember the name, but combining that with the one that hides scratch marks after a vault would be good for that too
---
Ive been playing Huntress and Hag a lot, unkocking most of hags teachables first.
---
Just bought the plauge with blood whatevers haha. I like her alot i just need the perk build to really enjoy her.
---
Time to leave them all
---
BEHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIND
---
Same
---
Only Claudette and Meg's are like this
---
Honestly that all depends on your device. I don't play console so I have no clue when to press it on there. As for PC, it all depends on how good a computer you have, what the input delay on your monitor is, and even the connection to the killer. Just mess around with it for a bit and see what works for you. Are you hitting skill checks later than you're trying to? Press it a bit earlier. Are you missing skill checks too early? Wait a split second longer
---
Oh my fucking god
---
Maybe the guy wanted to play as The Wraith tho
---
This is my main thought tbh. Whenever I bring this argument up I get replies of "BBQ and Ruin are the most used Killer perks are you saying they're OP pepega?" Put bluntly: yes. Have you ever had a game where you couldn't find the Ruin totem?
---
The difference between Killer and Survivor is that most Killer perks are directly counterable while few Survivor perks are. This is also why the counter perks to the strongest Survivor perks (namely Self Care [Sloppy Butcher] and Exhaustion perks [Killers with Exhaustion addons]) are so powerful. This is honestly the main issue I have with Adrenaline is that there is literally no counter to it, not even running Exhaustion addons which should inherently counter Exhaustion perks.
---
Is the counter to Adred as simple as having it not give a speed boost if you're already Exhausted? Honestly my issue is more with the instaheal, which I genuinely don't think should be a mechanic in the game. I really think that all instaheals (including Syptic Agent) should be replaced with a "heal boost" buff that'll heal you for 1 health state if you aren't hit in (X) amount of time. That way you can't just brainfart instaheal 2 seconds before the Killer hits you for a free chase extension. You shouldn't be able to loop a Killer an additional 3 times just because you brought a 6000 Bloodpoint addon, yet alone a single perk to get an additional 5 loops during the part of the game that has the least time to spare.
---
He should have gone on the live build then.
---
Why is the green medkit above the purple?
---
Looks like it’s time to prestige to me
---
Ah shit my day has come
---
You just have to look. If it's open it makes a woosh like sound. Otherwise you just got to look and get used to its spawns
---
Then they get hatch at the end of the game because the killer never chased them (since they were hiding all game) and they call you trash because "you got caught and they didn't"
---
Why? Because It makes killer more visible, and its so easier to spot clauds.
---
How? I use Nvidia freestyle.
---
A perk that I have not been a fan of ever since the patch is self care. I feel like it’s a waste time, when I use bond it helps me find teammates who can heal me fast and do a generator. Self care takes a while, by the time I’m self healing, I could doing a totem or a generator. Just my opinion on self care.
---
I will be trying out the build definitely, and for the last perk I’m going to put on Prove Thyself. I don’t need urban when I have spine chill I feel.
---
slug the 3rd survivor and try to find the 4th 'cause otherwise you don't have a better option
---
I think legion is underestimated. I feel like they are at the same tier as like doctor.
---
I mean who wants to play as a killer with no ability. I bet he only did it to surprise people
---
I just started playing the game a few days ao, and im kinda the same 😂
---
Ill go for gens, and if i see someone get hooked ill just wait until i finish the gen then i will go and unhook them or if noone is doing gens, then ill just stick to finding and repairing the gens.
---
I aint bout to die for one person lol, and if people arent doing gens, someones gotta
---
Oh okay that's  good idea haha
---
*cries in console*
---
It's random, but suspiciously there are places where it appears more often, depending on the map
---
The way they paused it looks like they were really trying to
---
That was a pretty good play by the Claudette.
---
be careful tho 'cause if you do so and forget where you left the 3rd one, s/he might get the hatch instead
---
Big no no! :)
---
Funny, I STILL get tunneled with DS, I just get fucking slugged now for 40seconds and soft camped and to counter that I need to run ANOTHER perk, what a waste of two slots.
---
Good shit post. upvote.
---
Sometimes they deserve it
---
U really don't think I was? I wasn't camping and I'm not dumb enough to NOT look for it. There is such a thing as survivors getting to it first and even if I did find it before the hooked person died I wasn't a insta down killer SOOOOO they still coulda got it. Kinda silly to assume I wasn't looking for it
---
Ummm not amazing but I can get by I can pallet loop and understand basics like the type of structures that you have in Dbd and how to properly use them but I still get cought out  don't practice enough reall
---
Some braindead gamer. And I'm being sarcastic, which implies that I'm IGNORING a YouTuber's opinion on the game. I really didn't think it was that hard to understand but I guess some people just lack comprehension, even with a /s.
---
What makes it anti tunneling? I get slugged way more now and still tunneled, just have to wait 40 seconds on the ground while I'm soft camped. Whew, so fun. To counter that I'd need to run Another useless perk like no mither which makes me a target, or unbreakable
---
Yeah true I just wish her traps still worked at endgame even as a survivor it was fun having both gates open but you and another survivor having a trap on your head rushing to get it off while being careful of the pig at the same time
---
Oke thx, though how do you mean free to play as he is locked
---
at least you dont have to deal with nurses ;D
---
Eh either way it's annoying
---
I’ve taken to running bond instead of self care in general, I’m too impatient for SC especially in light of the sloppy butcher buff.
---
im love u man
---
It’s both clauds too immersed and meg farms the shit out of you
---
Don't you have to censor their names?
---
Honestly, when this happens to me, I don't even get mad. The person who disconnect loses their points, so it's their lost. And if I get 3 kills, I win. If I manage to find the 4th survivor, that would be nice, but if not, I still won. No need to feel mad
---
You got me interested. I should probably run that build with a female survivor because of the body size. Easy to hide, you know. Sometimes when I’m getting chased I’ll get hit through windows or pallets because of the latency, not every killer has perfect connection.
---
When i go to huntress it says buy and it shows that i have to buy dlc
---
That would have been broken with EGC, removing it was a right thing to do.
---
Meh :)
---
Well u definitely know how to run-on
---
Talk about shards, I’ve got 9.1k. Im going to wait for the shrine though, I’m using them to get a couple of cosmetics.
---
&gt; A perk that I have not been a fan of ever since the patch is self care. I feel like it’s a waste time
---
You couldn't possibly be more correct. As for categories, I'll try my best, but it's usually best to have a build that's more versatile that can be used in most situations. Generally you can't control if you're going to be the gen jockey, the chased, or the medic, but if I had to make specific builds I'd say:
---
Chased: DS, Dead hard/Balanced, Adrenaline, MoM (You said you don't have mettle, so maybe something like quick and quiet, or deliverance or something)
---
Sneaky Beaky: Urban, Spine Chill/Premonition, Self Care, Empathy/Bond (Please never play stealthy, it just moves the pressure to your other 3 teammates since the killer likely won't waste time looking for you, leading everyone else to feel tunneled)
---
Medic: WGLF, We'll Make it, Botany, Borrowed Time
---
Gen Jockey: Prove Thyself, Resilience, Self Care, Spine Chill? (Heal yourself to 99, and enjoy quicker gen speed, then heal when the killer comes near. If you have a med kit, maybe replace self care with stake out)
---
Without bloodlust then on azarovs map (or whatever it’s called I don’t remember) there’s a chance that 4 t shaped walls with a window in the middle will spawn. A survivor can infinite there if the killer doesn’t get bloodlust
---
I'm not really mad just a little annoyed. I was using Huntress whom I rarely use so I was having a rough game already. It was one gen left and two ppl left, hooked the Ash for the first time and as I searched for the Meg I got half way around the map only to hear Ash kill himself on hook and see the Meg escape on the hud
---
This is even better when you remember the other survivor died literally right next to OP, then hatch just goes *pop* right there. They should make the hatch fade in just in case somebody is right next to the hatch spawn
---
So i click on huntress and its says buy and it directs me to dlc
---
Completely agreed I just miss it you know
---
I have some perks ideas :
---
Doing gens, you ? : Everytime your teammate is chased, you gain invinsibilty status effect, untill the guy dies on the hook. 
---
"Gens take 20 minutes do be done".
---
- every Claudette main.
---
DAT ASSSS : The Killer can't pick you up from the ground and you don't bleed-out.
---
"I am dummy THICC".
---
- every Jane main.
---
What anime is this please and thank you
---
I would like to mention that in this situation, huntress was actually the one who opened the gate (after I got hooked), not the other survivors.
---
WELL GET TO WORK! I NEED TO SEE IT!
---
I mean it's hard to care if they get hatch. You've got a 3k at that point
---
I’ve never killed myself, but I’ve given myself up many times when it apparent we aren’t all going to make it. It’s really on the killer at that point. 
---
A smart killer doesn’t hook ... he leaves you on the ground and goes after the last remaining player.
---
Damn this is pure fire super lit
---
(For real though, I really dig your design)
---
Anyone can cook
---
That's the way the cookie crumbles, unfortunately. It's a cheap tactic, but it's a tactic, and isn't even bannable, as they aren't technically 'cheating'.
---
It's annoying, I know. But the only way to surpass it is to just deal with it.
---
You could just slug. And bring deerstalker.
---
Dude, git guuuud, besides there would be 20 sequels to every horror movie if killers always get them all :p
---
Nah, a yandere is someone who kills/has harmful intentions to other people who give you affection.
---
Yeah but then if the last person is REALLY sneaky or is just waiting for them to bleed out then I feel bad for said slugged survivor
---
Haha more people run tombstone though from the games I've played, so far I've only encountered scratched mirror myers twice from when I started playing the game. Still, spine chill still helps, but I meant if you have both perks, whichever of the 3 you get, you'd still have a bit of use from at least 1 of them.
---
Usual spots are killer shack.
---
Oh well I just looked it up and just gave him what I saw lol
---
Oooh ok, that's a shame but here's some Game tips, place traps in the big door ways in the dead center, they sink into that weird black door frame just enough ;) works almost as well, but with every match sometimes I'll get a million traps, sometimes not one, completely shutting me down :p
---
At that point it can go many different ways. I don’t hide in closets, so that’s not an option. But if the killer is camping the downed survivor, nothing you can do about that. 
---
If, not I’ll get back you back up and we can try it again. Or if the killer is really good, they find me and it’s over.
---
wait you said you wanted to stay a little serious. even if its stupid the firecrackers function the same way. they should both be in same tiers
---
I dont feel bad.
---
It’s always The Game with this one for me.
---
You play on console right? try to "buy" it, I'm sure it will let you unlock it for free
---
Awesome, thanks you.
---
Just spam space(or whatever) to close the hatch. Even if they're mid-jump, it cancels it. Unless they changes that but I get what you mean
---
😂
---
I do because ik how that feels. I've been slugged and left so many times and quite a few times the person let me bleed out in while hiding in a corner
---
You sound like a whinny bitch.
---
I just run unbreakable.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
LOL I imagined the jade beads on the hat having physics implemented so whenever you run it would move in whichever direction.
---
I also really want this kind of thing implemented. I assume,based on other games which added or adjusted their crafting systems, they would end up changing the drop rates of different items so people wouldn’t be able to game the system and make a lot of rare/ultra rare items. 
---
The last survey they had included a question about adding a crafting system to the game, so this is/was something on their radar. However, IIRC the year 4 road map doesn’t included anything that would imply they are revisiting add ons, so I don’t think they have any plans for it :(
---
I wanna have faith in the Devs so I’m gonna say yes but honestly I dunno. Chapter cosmetics are supposed to drop with the chapter.
---
Lol I always have a problem with Unbreakable and DS. When im not using them I get tunneled/slugged but when I do I usually don't. But if I do by any chance I get picked up before I can use unbreakable or picked up after my DS depletes. I'm just unlucky I believe xD
---
Ahhh
---
I understand my guy.
---
Knockout, Third Seal, Blindness add on?
---
GGEZ
---
Because if you don’t prestige now, but want to later, you’ll have spent bloodpoints for no reason.
---
I sometimes dodge if I see like 3+ toolboxes in a lobby, just cause I don't really feel like playing against the team just trying to rush gens, it's not really fun and the general trend is that these guys are usually teams of red ranked survivors and a single rank 18. I don't rank past green ranks cause the game just isn't fun to play with people past like rank 8 :(
---
I don't really dodge anything else, though i'll get suspicious if I see 4 flashlights or 4 medikits, since it's probably SWF and they have instaheals/MoM/BT/Adrenaline, which yes I could face, but why would I want to? Those I just bring non brown addons to, but yeah I only really dodge 3 or 4 toolboxes cause I don't always use Ruin and the game is way too short if I face that team.
---
At this point, you may want to wait.  Freddy is about to change a lot, and you'll have to Unlearn a lot of whst you want to learn.
---
The dlc is free but you have to get it from the store still.
---
Yeah, I feel a little scummy doing it but it’s they’re fault I guess. I’m finally starting to get better at throwing hatchets normally and it’s great
---
Laughs in chainsaw
---
No one likes Julie.
---
It's sad, but true. Which is why we need ***a good Julie cosmetic some time soon***
---
Then your noob friends call her op immediately
---
If you want to play sneaky then for sure those are great perks. Personally, I hate playing stealthy. It's boring for the killer, it means you get let practice running the killer around, and you move all the pressure that would've been applied to you, to your teammates. If the killer can't find you, he's going to be hitting and hooking your other 3 teammates instead of you. This can lead to situations where someone is dead with 3-4 gens still left, where if you spread out the hooks/hits, more people would still be around. Plus, for the other 3 survivors, they'll feel more like they're getting tunneled
---
Is NOED good with huntres?
---
I "cheat" by putting a piece of tape on my screen and drawing a little crosshair on it, it helps a lot
---
Dead by NOED
---
He doesn't mean that you insta gib, he means removing the excessive tapping required, I. E. Either just hold space to struggle, or hold nothing but hit a button to give up instead.
---
*Baby killer tunneller gg EZ*
---
Yeah of course, it’s good with just about every killer. I’m not sure if they get 1 shotted by hatchets as well but melee swings definitely 1 down
---
The game doesn't officially support it, but if you can get a K+M to controller converter it would
---
This one has my vote
---
killers had a considerable disadvantage before egc when there’s one survivor left
---
most of the time the gates are not campable
---
If it works for you, it works! I personally am really bad at hiding, and I'm not a big a fan of it. But as long as you're contributing to the game then it's fine. I have no problem with players like you. What annoys me is the Claudette wearing the all brown outfit who hides the second she hears a heartbeat all game, is always too afraid to go for the save, and gets maybe half a gen done all game, but still gets hatch because she never was found.
---
Oh! Gotcha.
---
oh ok! do yo uh know any converters I can get on amazon?
---
That would be brutal as hell.  Good thing Nancy and Tipper are not so in the picture these days.
---
Salt 100
---
Pray
---
Yeah, it's really not that big of a deal to leave, especially if you're put into a situation where there's absolutely nothing you can do. This is the same mentality as the old hatch standoffs, where neither player wants to budge because "they've got to win"
---
Too many cooks
---
Don’t know who that is.
---
And the nurse strangling their victims as you watch their literal life leave their body isn’t brutal?
---
that might have been my fault sorry uwu
---
"can be juked" I think is more accurate than "can be looped"
---
I won't ever want to prestige
---
Im not a terrible killer have been ranking up pretty quickly. Just dont have OP perks yet and needed advice while grinding.
---
I didn't repost it. It happend to me today
---
Dwight or Meg. Dwight had bond which is an amazing perk to have when playing with randoms. Adrenaline on Meg is clutch at the end if you are decent enough to last that long and run the killer a bit. Prove theyself is nice also for extra BP while leveling your characters up.
---

This is one of the most famous ones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cronusmax-Plus-Game-Adapter-Version/dp/B00IBUGE6A/ref=asc_df_B00IBUGE6A/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=310689469388&amp;hvpos=1o2&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=3761138620506869012&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9046665&amp;hvtargid=pla-470527244567&amp;psc=1 but its a bit over priced, you could probs find others on amazon for cheaper
---
i have an adapter that has a usb in that has both mouse and keyboard however the mouse doesnt work.
---
I hate second chance perks, but honestly this was just perfectly executed. That killer should not have fallen for the dead hard
---
Well I usually do consider anything 2k or better a win. But I had such a bad game considering I don't use Huntress often and I was going for a daily. But I do consider my 3k a win.
---
Me playing Wraith, mindful of the other Bing Bong Bois who have lost their way
---
Hag should be higher imo. The ceiling of being really good with her traps is immense.
---
I just tried rotating your camera. I’m on mobile...
---
This.  If you're ridiculous at moving unpredictably, you MIGHT be able to avoid a 3 blink, especially if you've got dead hard up.  You should be able to outpace her if you've got sprint burst up (once, anyway), but yeah, Nurse is about 2 things, regardless of if she's 2 blink or 5 blink - &gt; Don't get found, and break line of sight as fast as possible otherwise.  Versing a decent nurse or a good spirit is likely the only time a good survivor is going to feel actual pressure in a game (assuming your team isn't potatoes).
---
I read what all the perks did and it doesn't seem to add up. Since i could see the first 2 peoples auras and i could even see the last guys aura the first time he got downed.
---
Aww poor killer doesn't get to bully the 3 remaining survivors T_T better report those people that didn't want to play the unbalanced match.
---
&gt; if you "don't want to waste your time" that's fine, but waiting for a game only to have people leave it wastes mine too. What's good for the goose, mate.
---
Right, but that second, third, and fourth survivor aren't responsible for wasting your time, the first one is. As a killer do you enjoy the unbalanced matches? I hate that shit on both sides, but it's not the other survivors fault.
---
Dude's a clown. He's the reporting vigilante no one asked for.
---
If only there was some way you could use perks, too.
---
Hey! 
---
Julie's cool; although I agree it's very sad her two best cosmetics are one that is her exact same default outfit but all denim and one that is her exact same default outfit but covered in blood.
---
Was that the one with dinner party hag and big bird Kate? Because no, it came out separately. Legion came with mountaineer Kate though, so that's something.
---
_You mother now._
---
Lolol
---
No it's just super lazy
---
Upon further investigation, I have in fact seen that. It was just a really long time ago.
---
You must not have played as a killer in the old days. People complaining about survivors being overpowered now are just bad or they somehow dont learn from their mistakes over and over.
---
You realize that that was the point of it right?
---
Honestly, I'd take both and ditch either ds or deliverance, depending on your experience.  DS, Adren, BT, and DH would be slightly stronger imo than deliv, DH, bt, and Adren.  The set up of ds, DH, deliv, and Adren is overly self serving, with nothing to help your team or help make saves, but DH is just too strong if you know how to use it to leave it out. 
---
  
---
My goto general purpose build is iron will, DH, bt, and adrenaline.  Alert gets some mileage as well, but that's one of those ones that practice and experience can largely offset.
---
I disagree. It’s not that useful on anyone but she’s the only character that can use it with a built in mechanic. Hearing humming for huntress is meh. A LOT of survivors will work through it. Heartbeat is when you really start to get going. It’s your last warning to get out of an open area. Everyone else doesn’t need it and honestly neither does she. I wouldn’t run it on her or anyone else. But she’s the best candidate for it especially in the high ranks where survivors are confident enough to hear the humming a wait until it gets closer. Directional or not It will probably confuse someone. Which is what the perk does on every other killer. It either confuses the survivor into thinking you’re far away because they just entered your Terror radius, or it takes them by surprise depending on how small your Terri radius already is. Every other killer I listed is okay with it but she is the best. Again, because it works with her built in humming mechanic. Is it good? No. But they asked for who it worked with.
---
ps?
---
That’s actually true 😅
---
literally unplayable
---
That makes sense. I've misunderstood the purpose of the EGC update, it seems. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy as any killer to see that survivors can't troll me and have the game stretch on forever. It just is lackluster as a whole, in my opinion.
---
Because it heals slower and any competent player doesn’t need bigger skill check zones
---
Good strat
---
If you switch anything make it Iron Will.
---
Do you even know how the rework works?
---
Like a super lunge or something that he charges up like the nurse.  Pretty rudimentary idea but it would be cool
---
THANK YOU. That’s what I’m saying, if they are going to rush then I have to get them. Atleast you get this
---
It's still an extra hit, but now you need 3 stacks of protection/unhooks to have it active. You never know if you'll be bale to use it every game, while Adrenaline always does ita job if you make it to end game. I'd say go Adrenaline, but both are good perks either way
---
“Should’ve gone for the Franklin’s” *Blinds for the fourth time after a pallet*
---
I only run the most meta build on all my killers.  Distressing, beast of prey, BBQ and lightborn
---
60*. 
---
And it makes a difference. Because if you're still the center of the killer's attention 60 seconds after being unhooked, that's precious time for your teammates to progress on the objectives. Sure it's not fun for you, it never is, but at least you're making the killer pay for his bad behaviour.
---
yeah my keyboard works fine just my mouse won't work
---
Shit, I thought you went overboard and put a bunch of dry ice on bathroom floor to simulate fog.
---
Thanks I got Adrenaline.
---
i dont think dbd has mouse support yet for console. ill see if there is a way
---
No problem, glad to help
---
RUN! 
---
   
---
Wait, no, CROUCHWALK!
---
trapper and billy for brutal strenght and resilient (for the fuck pallets build) else you might want to grab the meta perks (BBQ and Chilli, Nurses Calling, Ruin..) thas about it
---
Oof I can't deal with Spirit, because well most of the teams I get on solo queue are potatoes. They'll be the ones that touch a gen, find out there's ruin and give up and find ruin, or get spotted in the first 2mins of the game, then the other 2 are 100% altruism and no one does gens and everyone dies. At least with Nurse, good survivors that keep track of her whereabouts are still inclined to do gens.
---
It's up to you what you consider "funny" for me is piggy
---
People can still fall asleep with the rework, so it's a valid question.
---
I forgot that perk even existed. Damn.
---
Nah man. That was a hitbox issue. I agree bad hit. But thats not auto aim.
---
If I remember correctly this bug is bannable. So I suggest you report it
---
Brenda &gt; Randy
---
i dont believe you had to hit them that many times
---
Aww thanks, and yes Jake is asian. His full name is Jake Park and on dbd official wiki he's listed as Asian American. Park is also a South Korean last name.
---
I'm gonna be straight forward here..
---
If a killer did fuck all for 5 gens, and then gets a 4K with NOED, that killer earned a 4K. Your reasoning sounds like typical 'salty survivor' reasoning along the lines of 'they weren't playing the way a good killer should, so they didn't really earn it's
---
I mostly play survivor and solo at that. I think NOED is fine.
---
When used on Myers: Survivor will notice he has been stabbed and enter dying state after hug is completed... This IS Michael Myers, after all.
---
Get BBQ and chili so you can get more perks. And get headphones. And find an area to patrol. Bad survivors will leave the gens in your area last and most killers can deal with this.
---
Great effort if you asked that question just to make this poor joke
---
First hit injures them, they then pop an insta heal at the bottom of the stairs just as I’m about to hit him for the 2nd time. Then his metal of man activated and that’s how they survived the 3rd hit
---
I prefer Ashy (IIRC?) even though it's common and straight up just a recolor. The lighter hood and white pants just look cool to me.
---
Could this be any more low effort?
---
The only reason Ghostface is so high is because I like the mask and Robes he has on by default but with blood it just makes it better and Doctor has the best prestige Body which is why he is also C tier.
---

Suffocating yourself with a gas mask while wearing rubber outfits is a very largely representing kinky activity on the internets.
---

---
Everyone has their own styles but in terms of fun, it’s hard to beat Pig once you get some good sneaks on your victims. She’s more than viable with practice as well but to me, just has a whole mechanic and playstyle that is quite fun compared to Legion.
---
I do that when I play solo lol
---
Well I haven't watched Zubat so I'm not in a position to judge 🤣 Just that from the Youtubers I've watched, I'm trying to learn from Tru3 the most, and also, nipples.
---
&gt;. Not one person hasn't been helpful here and I always get full decent responses to my questions no matter how stupid the question is. Of course, there is a few sour apples (fucking camping killers and salty survivors) but in general, this is such a great fanbase. Thanks guys!
---
&gt;
---
&gt;TL;DR I appreciate y'all
---
Guarantee this is sarcastic. I'm new, only started playing dbd during the free weekend, but in this short time I've already met the low rank community and it's just as typically toxic as any other multiplayer community. I hear it only gets worse higher up so, again, par for the course.
---
By the way, I find it interesting that you mention camping like it has something to do with being nice. It's a low skill unfun strat but it is a legitimate way to play the objective just as much as looping is for survivors.
---
Lol yeah 😂
---
Dwights love looping that's for sure. I usually notice Claudettes running away from safe pallets
---
Was just tossing out some possibilities.  Did you get hit or bear trapped between that guy's first and second down?  If so, it could still be blindness.  Then again, this is dbd, so it could just be a straight bug... Hell, the ptb once again had broken sounds included in the patch for like the 50th time.  I have a feeling that the dbd code is exceptionally fragile.
---
I’ve only played this game 2 days and already got a message on Xbox about camping, I hooked a bitch then I saw her friend peeking around so I went around a corner and crouched (pig) then swiped him down when he came to rescue her, I wasn’t camping I saw that guy there and decided to bait him out.
---
Well you traded a hook for an instaheal and mom proc, so I'd say it was worth it
---
I like this change because the killer actually has to earn the NOED themselves and then as a survivor I can’t be salty when they gained the stacks
---
Yeah so as others said it appears depending on how many gens are done and how many survivors are alive. 
---
Basically, the number of survivors alive + 1 = the numbers of gens that need to be completed for it to spawn as a closed hatch that can be seen. 
---
It will appear/open when 1 survivor is left no matter what. Before, 2 gens needs to be done. Now it’s basically the last chance for the last survivor regardless of gens and is a mad dash of who can find it first. If the killer closes it, it can still be opened with a key.
---
I think most folks would put burning someone alive towards the top end of the brutality list.  Of course, all moris are brutal.  It wasn't a criticism, it was an endorsement.  Nancy Reagan and Tipper Gore were heavily involved in censoring sex, drugs, and violence in various media in their prime.
---
Most teammates aren't that smart though unless you're SWF. They end up getting slugged trying to help me. Every game would be pretty quick if people stopped being so altruistic tbh. I rarely play anymore lately since all the survivor nerfs and killer buffs.
---
gg ez baby killer
---
Thanks, I reported it
---
BTW this post deserves more attention, and it will get more if you change the title. Change it to something like "I trapped a Trapper" or something because right now the title looks like you just want people to see how well you guys did in the match.
---
Fucking hell, this is amazing.
---
The pig is understandable since you are supposed to remove the trap but but the rest dont...
---
Nurse has a horrible mori, she chokes you to death and thats it.
---
Damn, I never realised how loud his grunts are until I had to play without headphone and the sound echoing in my room.
---
What voice did they ask these actors to make during recording?  Won't be surprised if my neigbour ask me if I had good time last night.
---
I just bought the Halloween chapter as I saw the movie yesterday and kinda liked it, I'm eager to play as Michael Myers :)
---
Look qt his face reveal m8
---
You don't see the timers go down as Killer anymore
---
Lol just say that one fire bitch from moana
---
Dud they massacred my boy
---
I havent unlocked all the pwrks thats why i asked for the advice.
---
How is everyone good with trapper? I feel like im terrible with him.
---
As others said, basically practice your looping so you can get away. I find it easiest for me to wake up from teammates because I run Dwight’s perk Bond on every survivor build. It’s great for new players but even as a veteran, it’s my favorite survivor perk in the game. It can also help to self-care as well when you can, as those skillchecks can also wake you up. I struggled against Freddy in the beginning as well but the more you play against him, the more you’ll get a feel for it and how weak he really is.
---
Why the caps lock tho
---
And I would kill the rest of them
---
Lmaoo
---
Why ace?
---
Hope.
---
Is he some kind of professional idiot?
---
his perks, mostly the luck and aura increase, SUCK
---
Hope 1 is pretty unnoticeable, Plunderer's 1 is at least useful for finding items.
---
no thank you :-)
---
It's a good rework, and a needed one in my opinion, but I actually am going to miss the unique playstyle a little bit - he wasn't going to 4-man wipe most of the time, and fighting against altruism was more of an uphill battle for him than most survivors, but it was nice to have a killer who could at least *try* to control his own metagame.  Unfortunately, that interaction barrier was too much of a hindrance to ever truly be overcome
---
This rework will make his core playstyle more in line with a regular M1 killer, but him having a limited selection of gen teleport options and dream-based traps prevents him from being stuck like that, so while I think it'll make high-level Freddy play more boring, I do think it'll make it better in a way it's needed
---
That said, I'm especially gonna miss add-on Freddy: Pill Bottle Freddy was no Tombstone Myers, but he had some fun stuff working for him.   Pill Bottle+Paint Thinner was essentially 'Free Hit Freddy', but I actually enjoyed Class Photo+Black Box with Obsession perks for a 'reverse tunnel' build, pre-Remember Me nerf.  It made it easy to identify your Obsession at the very start of the match, then you could build your Play With Your Food and Remember Me stacks right off the bat, once you've got your tokens, start putting everyone else under to build Save the Best for Last tokens, and throw out some Rancor in the endgame to get the Obsession out of the way (would have probably just used NOED in hindsight, but decided against it, 'for science').  There were *much* better builds, but then again, there were much better killers too, but it was kind of cool to have a killer like Freddy who, because of his built-in aura reading, was able to make foolproof Obsession plays from the start of the trial.
---
Unfortunately, even a fun build like that or PB+PT *demanded* add-ons, and it didn't even change the metagame the way stuff like Windstorm Wraith or Tombstone Myers do.  So I think the interaction barrier ultimately did just need to be gone
---
Well, I can’t think of a mori that’s more fitting for an arsonist.
---
Because doing totems is hard and they need an excuse to nerf more killer perks.
---
They also don't wear a hat, they wear masks.
---
if i hit him enough, will he go down or i have to leave him and end the chase??
---
Who is that though?
---
I have to agree that Dwight is a great beginner survivor. I’ve played lots of DBD and I still run Bond on every survivor build. Teamwork is so important for survivor gameplay and his perks really encourage team synergy which increases everyone’s chances of getting out. 
---
Meg and Claudette are also popular choices because of their evasion and ability to heal themselves respectively. That being said, I actually think Feng is a great starting survivor as well. Her perks let you learn gen skillchecks more efficiently, keep tabs on the killer’s location, and make a quick getaway if you are found. I’m a Feng main with every perk on her at this point now so I’m a bit biased maybe, but I think she’s a hugely underrated starter survivor.
---
Well, he's not wrong
---
That’s stupid.
---
&gt; Yeah, slugging is a legitimate strategy against DS the way that slugging can be a legit strategy in general. This runs of the risk of losing the survivor in the grass, having them run unbreakable and getting up or having another survivor heal them.
---
A strategy has to have pros and cons otherwise it's not a strategy and just something you should always do, there is little to no cons of slugging + soft camping. No one is going to get close enough to heal me with the soft camp, I can't get up because of the soft camp, and I can't DS because I'm slugged till it expires. 
---
&gt;Also, a killer might not know you are running DS and try to go for the hook right away and it gives you a second chance. It's designed now that it will punish that instant hook behavior. You have a chance on the floor but have zero chance on your last hook.
---
Not when every killer is learning how DS works now and will just automatically leave people slugged, I've been seeing slugging a LOT more since the rework than before. "Legit stratagedy" sure but to say DS is good or it's anti-tunneling is wrong, I knew as soon as they put a time limit on the damn thing that people would just know to let it expire and **then** hook you. A game with perks should have a strong meta, the meta to this game now is that slugging is all but guaranteed and that means you'd be stupid to not run an anti-slug perk, which takes up a slot and gives you less flexibility. 
---
&gt;But also, more importantly, you don't have to run DS at all. Not all perks will work all the time, it's the game. Sometimes your hex gets found right away. Sometimes you are running Deliverance and you are the first hooked.
---
I get that, but people have their favorite perks and builds that flow with their playstyle, mine, this isn't LoL where I need to be using different characters and perks on rotation, and a lot of builds were ruined with bullshit reworks that weren't needed because killers cry ALL the time about everything if they aren't guaranteed a 4k. 
---
I want the 7 feet reach killers have to be nerfed, I'll be **well** past a window or pallet and still get hit and my ping was perfectly fine in the lobby so it's not lag.
---
I want to not be forced to be stuck in a match if I'm the last one and the killer closes the hatch, slugs me and then leaves me bleeding to go break pallets for points. This literally happened last night and then post game he told me to get fucked for asking why he forced me to bleed out and not just end it. I would have had the hatch if the animation and timing for the last person being killed didn't take so long for the hatch to open, it would have been an awesome clutch end game as he was walking back to me but because it takes way too long, I got slugged and then had to watch the hatch get closed and bleed out for what felt like 2 minutes. End game was for the killers, locker blindness was for the killers, DS nerf was for the killers, borrowed time nerf was for the killers, when do we get a buff or some love?
---
They made a lot of tiny nerfs that all add up in a big way and it's almost no fun to play survivor anymore because depending on the killer and perks that you can figure out within the first 3 minutes of the game, you almost know immediately how the match will go.
---
Finger ring can be made from a barbed wire. Maybe with a description of Clown getting it after a failed/succesful attempt of climbing over prison's fence.
---
Also BHVR seem to love having small details in their costumes. You can add a pair of broken handcuffs on Clown's wrists or shackles on his ankles. Or a prison tattoo on his fist, maybe his nickname "Hawk" with one letter on each finger.
---
These are just suggestions though you don't have to add anything you don't want to.
---
Have you ever went open handed with a map or key/slippery meat with up the ante tho?
---
Well, you know, the oft repeated mantra of killer mains, "just do Gens".  As much as folks want to piss on it, it's the most true statement.  If you concentrate on gens and only save at the last moment, your chances of survival generally increase dramatically vs any killer.  Against a good nurse or a very good spirit, it's the only way people are getting out alive.  You can screw around with most other killers, build points, pat your ego and get 2+ out the door pretty well.  Even with low tier killers though, if only 1/4 of the Survivors are actually getting gens done and the rest are hiding, saving, or generally dicking around... Well, that killer is probably on his way to an wasy 3-4k. 
---
There's a lot of folks who don't understand how the game works, how to properly manage a game, etc.  Unless you're up against the top 1% of killer players, a game should never end with less than 3 gens done.  It's practically impossible to not get 3 gens done vs normal human killers if the Survivors have any sense at all.  Boggles the mind, some days.
---
The killer can’t make use of Spirit fury and enduring if you never use a pallet 🤔
---
He didn't apply enough map pressure.
---
They’re both kind of eh. I would stick with Hope unless you’re low on items. But if you are struggling to escape a lot of games, Plunderer’s gives up keys fairly often which can help not just in stocking up but making an escape in a rough game.
---
I don't know man. I have a tendency to kill Megs on principle because they sandbag their teammates and sprint burst into the sunset.
---
Not as bad as Claudette. She sounds like you fisted her as you lift her.
---
But... it’s easier to cleanse dull totems than it is to prevent my low IQ teammates from getting downed every five seconds. I’d rather keep the current version honestly, you can normally tell who runs it by how they play and prevent it from ever activating.
---
But if he is Ed, how can there also be NoEd?
---
I've had that happen to me as well. Brought a pallet muncher build with Wraith's Very Rare Shadow Dance just for no one to drop a pallet.
---
Killers are always stronger than survivors in 1v1 situations, I'm not arguing that. It's also not the issue. I'm not saying the survivor should be overpowered or given an advantage just because they are the last survivor. I'm also certain that EGC is not meant to be a stealth game. If that were the case, it would not be timed and the ways in which a survivor could escape would not be given to the killer with ease. In most cases, the timer eliminates the ability  for the survivor to use stealth when the killer is faster and has no need to slowly meander around the map. When there is only one survivor left, I believe the timer is limited to 60 seconds if I'm not mistaken. If they have 15 seconds to fully open a gate and are forced to try and open another, the time it would take them to travel between the gates while stealthily avoiding the killer makes it pointless for them since the killers are much faster and will likely force them off of the exits.
---
I agree with taking away Hope and Adrenaline in EGC when all generators haven't been activated normally; I hadn't even thought about that to be honest since I haven't been bothered by survivors using those perks. What I meant by having NoED activate during EGC without having all generators completed seems like something that got missed in making the EGC. 
---
Referring once again to the first point, the issue is not that the killer can close the hatch- nor is it that the killer should not be stronger than the survivor. The behaviour brought on by it is an issue and, in my opinion, so is the lack of challenge as a killer. It makes the whole end rather boring to me.
---
well survivors lose their collision for a bit after you hit them, you definitely coulda got the hit off the second time you hit em.
---
ok bet
---
It's absolutely fitting, fits the game well, would look awesome as well.  My only side point was that it's a bit of a +1 level in terms of horrifying for most people.  I can imagine a couple countries that dbd operates in would maybe drop the boot on trying to include that in the game.
---
no no, there's still dreamstate, but it starts off in microsleep IIRC and failed skillchecks and the clock(s?)
---
It seems like he could pull people into a deeper sleep
---
It’s entirely your preference and I don’t think it’s wrong to farm or completely slaughter them. I’ll usually down people and drop them to signal I feel friendly so we can farm but that’s just me. I play a lot of survivor as well so I guess I have a little soft spot. But overall, there’s no right or wrong way to approach it.
---
Let me ask you this though. Do you cleanse dull totems against camping killers, or do you rush gens like everyone advises survivors to do? Or lets say you are the one hooked with a killer facecamping, you’d be perfectly fine if the others were running around the map looking for dulls as you are dying, instead of doing gens? 
---
That type of scenario is precisely why there should be a requirement like what he’s suggesting. Braindead campers shouldn’t be able to get the full power of the perk.
---
&gt;&gt;what are the chances
---
Hatch spawns in that spot literally every time on that map for some reason
---
When the boosted Meg main runs for the hook save against the Hag
---
It's no made by my tho

I will absolutely use that, seems sweet.

I hope you enjoy him! Michael is fun and very powerful.

because anyone commented in the last one and i want to know people's opinion
---
I nutted.
---
why in rancor the obsesion see the killer's aura? just random stuff lmao
---
WATATEN!: An angel flew down to me.
---
It's on crunchyroll if you have it. It's a little weird, but its pretty funny.
---
before i read the title and saw ghostface at the top, i was like, "excuse me wtf?"
---
Yea I searched for it there previously and it wasn't there, iv had it spawn next to the house and shed on the street my last game. This was unexpected though, he got me good with DS.
---
I don't find that to be true. If the survivor was able to evade the killer and find the hatch, then they would escape. If the killer found the survivor first, the survivor would be hard-pressed to escape the killer and make it to the hatch. I felt like that relied more on the skill of the survivor and the killer than in the case of EGC. As far as camping gates goes, I can understand a map like the Memorial Institute or the Game to be difficult to camp gates on or even have a clear line of sight on the gates. I haven't seen much issue in the other maps though.
---
Pig. She is really fun to play. You won't regret it *oink* Legion is kind of boring imo. Pig's ability has a lot more depth.
---
I personally don’t see it as that bad.
---
spelling lol and also his perks are hot garbage, vigil is useless and so is wake up, pharmacy is ok but bond and self care are better
---
Zis is the claudette dud, megs have borrowed time but will completely farm u anyway cause the killer is a crouching pig
---
Its praobly more going to be either 60 or 45 seconds is my guess.
---
Hope
---
Yeaaa, jigsaw good i guess

Had a great, non-toxic match against a SWF today.  I’m rank 18 and was using a level 1 Myers so no good perks and they were all rank 14-15 with the high level meta/detection perks and items.  Despite that I still managed to get 3 kills with the fourth escaping via a hatch since I never went past Evil Within one so they could never detect me.  I’d just pop up out of nowhere and grab them from a gen and hook them.
---
After it was over and I saw what I was up against I got “For having no perks you were an amazing Myers.  GG”.  It really made my day.
---
Wow, you’re kind of unpleasant to talk to! Have a great day!
---
Jokes on you. I mained Conqueror in For Honor for the "RAH"
---
The rest..yeah alright that's fair. lol.
---
Yeah I did. They just made the mask more bloodied and kept the clothes and knife the same from the leaks which probably meant the mask was just unfinished. I did want more blood on the mask and I got my wish.
---
but far hatchets are so easy to dodge
---
Ok. So why didnt they fix it over the years it's been released if it's so broken and unfair?
---
It was broken when it wasn't a totem perk. As a totem perk it's pretty decently balanced.
---
You can report them, telling people to die is against the rules I’m pretty sure
---
I do not usually camp, but when I do, it's to savor the tears of crybabys who complain about things like this
---
And you can still sleep at night? Smh
---
Didnt age well.
---
DS was like that for years. Just cause devs are slow to fix doesn't mean the perk is fair.
---
It only helps if the killer was at lunge distance, but its horrible when you arent injured because you eat a free hit or instant down if the killer was just thinking of not lunging
---
It wasn't the first thing I did, first thing I did was say I think that a killer getting a 4K with NOED still earned it. 
---
And no I am not saying it's a 'typical survivor main' opinion. I am a survivor main', and for the most part think my views align with the typical views. I do NOT think the typical survivor main' would say that a killer didn't *earn* a 4K because they used NOED. I went out of my way to say I think that saying that sounds like a 'salty survivor' kind of complaint. As in not a logically reasoned complaint about the actual balance of the perk, but just salty raging against the idea of a killer utilizing the perk to achieve success. I say this because I think the poster is adding nothing to the discussion by acting like getting the 4K under those circumstances is unearned.
---
Honestly I'd be a little pissed but I'd laugh because its always gonna be funny to me the first time it happens.
---
I mean a little bit of me thinks he is balanced but every other bit is saying Ghostface is garbage and the developers aren't going to fix him. The good side is thinking  you can stalk(one shot) and doesn't need to wait 7 seconds hit someone while on the other hand you can just counter him with perks and just looking at him. Man I can't believe they made such a bad killer that makes me conflicted because he is so damn cool looking but so garbage.
---
They are fixing Ghostface because he’s broken and bad
---
Idk why but this made me giggle😂 I couldn't do without perks and I never use any meta. At least i dont think so i really just use what i like
---
Yeah exactly. I really need to work on my looping. I kinda suck at it. This scenario just happened to have the right timing haha
---
I’m well aware, but there are undoubtedly some people who insists Ghostface is fine currently
---
2/11 I'm fine :D
---
Tell me what 😥
---
Unheard of!
---
Yep I agree the blood is the hardest to see but the body is pretty damn good plus his weapon looks pretty cool just wish it had a electric version with red electric instead of the regular white.
---
5 days after the PTB started?
---
True. Hopefully the power is fixed/reworked so I don’t feel awful P3-50ing him because that’s gonna happen regardless.
---
Blood Amber ? What is that ???
---
I never said that a match should last impossibly long because survivors are trying to troll a killer. I'm very much against that. 
---
I also did not state that a killer should not have an advantage in a 1v1 with a survivor. That would be ludicrous, seeing as who the killer is always faster and can take down a survivor. I'm also not saying that having NoEd left on the board is a problem if they don't want to cleanse totems. I'm saying that it's overkill in EGC unless all have actually been activated by the survivors. It feels undeserved at that point, in my opinion. I also don't know anything about a totem on small game, but that sounds completely unnecessary. There are only 5 totems, it's not difficult to count it out.
---
That's not what I'm getting at. I'm pointing out that it leads to less than desirable behaviour on the killer's part in most cases. People like to troll and play dirty when they can- survivors and killers both. It also does not leave the game balanced. By balanced, I don't mean equal chances for the survivor and killer to win. I'm talking balanced as in reasonable chances for someone to win. It takes away from the challenge and skill required to play as either party.
---
you're the guy who calls me a loser for hooking everyone twice and stabbing the shit out of them then eventually letting them go
---
I agree. OoO on ghostface in nightshroud is super op
---
&gt;A blood-red amber striped with black veins. The amber is warm to the touch. Can be attached to the Key using its jump ring to channel the Key's Aura-reading ability.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Reveals the **Killer's Aura** when within **32 metres** of range at the **great expense** of the Key's energy.
---
Add on for the key shows the killer aura
---
Dude, this doesn't look like Hag, this looks more like a old Spirit.
---
HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD
---
NOED is a real risk, not like Devour! What if the survivors don't make it to endgame? What if the survivors actually find the last dull, even in The Game? Props to you for taking risks, man. About time someone sees the risk in running NOED.
---
When you are asleep you hear the lullaby, which monitor and abuse doesn’t change, but awake survivors hear the terror radius, which CAN be changed, so monitor and abuse will actually be pretty decent on freddy
---
Yeah, it didn't make me angry but I thought I'd share it as my first post
---
Yes, you have found me, how ever did you detect my evil genius? Mwahaha
---
I'm pretty sure it's because of how the game is coded. Deliverance simply gives you a 100% chance to pull yourself off but inflicts Broken for some time. Henceforth you're technically unhooking yourself which is why you get unhook points.
---
Breakdown, on the other hand, just breaks the hook. Hook sabotage however is a channeled ability similar to doing gens and it awards points based on how long you did it. Henceforth since you didn't perform a sabotage action you didn't get sabotage points.
---
you sunnuva..
---
Ahhh, I forgot that this add-on actually exist.
---
Against any stealth killer it is IMHO; the whole POINT is these guys get to sneak up on you, so why do these perks affect them?
---
All I see are ppl complaining about him being bad. Sounds like you just want to call ppl out, which I don’t like.
---
Aw they said that ? Damn lol
---
I’m a big fan of David for his Dead Hard and WGLF but I haven’t used his default clothing for months so I couldn’t comment on how well he can disguise himself.
---
Claudette
---
What was funny and true
---
I will be sure to show her all these comments. I certainly continue to encourage her to keep painting :)
---
Thanks so much for the kind words!
---
I'm glad you like them!!
---
I'm glad you think so too! :)
---
I love it bc I usually don't go blinking around with Nurse until I spot a sign of a Survivior so I just walk up to a pallet and then I hear "HUWAHHHHHHH" and it scares the piss out of me
---
You got it! It would be similar to sickness but without knowing how close to death you are.
---
That looks so fucking good!!!!!
---
Took me a while to realize that a hatch realistically couldn't spawn where there's a floor below since you'd just fall into the bottom floor instead of exiting the match. Then again it is a magically spawning hatch so it could be a teleporter of some kind instead.
---
mhh jealous?
---
But it doesn't counter the other killers' powers entirely; sure it lets you know where they are so they can't really use their powers depending, but it's not a total counter.  Against stealth killers, if they try to stealth, OoO will immediately tell you where they are and you can watch what they're doing
---
I never said he didn't deserve it and I'm not complaining over 3kills if u would reread my post u would know what I'm complaining over. So instead of being silly urself by commenting on someone's post just to be disrespectful and not pay attention to what the post is saying before u comment, why don't u either try reading it and pay attention to what I am saying or don't comment at all. Simple as that
---
Can you explain why? I have been considering her
---
That was just a last-second idea to help Survivors when The Pig has high-value add-ons equipped.
---
I will be sure to show her your comment!
---
I don't know why you are so mad that afflictions without timers are not changed by a perk that only reduces timers.
---
1 It works against all add ons that don't say "until healed". That should be obvious. Thinking the perk is useless because you lack reading comprehension is fucked up. 
---
2 Why you would think it works on exposed is beyond me. 
---
3 it does work on all exhaustion perks, including head on. Which is its main purpose. 
---
4 it debuffs 100% of the things it says it does. You are trying to shoehorn in afflictions (RBT add ons, etc.) that don't go away over time, and you should be able to extrapolate that easily.
---
Even if vigil reduced facemask blindness, taking of the trap is faster. Lol
---
I know i'm not the best artist, but man do I want this in the game.
---
I thought the emojis were enough I’m sorry xXJokerGamerXx
---
Before, they could be grabbed out of the hatch. I understand that now they cannot in EGC. I agree that hatch standoffs were awful, but this was not a very balanced way of eliminating that problem. Also, as a killer, if I couldn't catch them before they found hatch, I would just hit them so they would leave. No hatch standoff, I get a quitter bonus, they escape. No biggie. Not getting a 4k isn't the end of the world to me, I suppose, and I find it annoying when they don't feel like I worked for them.
---
I am aware of this, and don't mind it. I already made note in the OP that survivors can still escape with a key. Also, note that I enjoy that they reinstated the hatch close option for the killers. I have absolutely no issues with it.
---
I disagree. It wasn't a guaranteed win for survivors if the killer slugged or was skilled. In fact, slugging was a very common counter this sort of issue. I've done it myself when I was having difficulties with the skill of the running survivors. I would also raise the issue that besides having a key, there doesn't seem to be any other counter to EGC for survivors. Even then, killers can still slug to avoid that problem in EGC as long as they are skilled enough to prevent the survivors from getting enough generators done to spawn the hatch on the map. It just seems like an anticlimactic end that doesn't have much challenge.
---
Personally prefer Lithe as easier to pull off but still on command
---
XD yea ! can't unsee now.
---
Still nice concept would love a serie of skin from hell
---
Oh how the turntables
---
Unless it's a duration add on it's useless.
---
I'd prefer him to be crap because at least survivors will have fun instead of getting steamrolled but yeah I think this discussion has been good don't want it to be very long.
---
you shouldn’t have to slug 
---
i’d rather take the gamble with egc
---
Yes, it's a hitbox thing, just like how a hatchet can hit you a when just an inch of your shoulder is shown through the cover. I've been in similar situations and you can stalk without seeing all of the Survivor's model, just a very tiny bit is good enough.
---
Bamboo and Corn on the other hand might as well be made of lead, exploitable as fuck.
---
Where and what is this contest? First I've heard of it!
---
Because she is black (pause) it makes her basically invisible on dark maps(I'm not the commenter just answering the question)
---
Mori me.
---
We’re not talking about killers
---
TIL James Charles invented the leather daddy look.
---
I started getting this error last night too. I put in a ticket with BHVR and they said they're working on a fix for it.
---
i actually dont care about your opinion. If you think that something as original as this ONLY because its japanese its from the weeb community then you are fucking dumb. You should like the skin not the fact that is japanese or not. If you are here to cry and bitching about the fact that u have no original ideas nor drawing skill then bye bye
---
That's how you counter the entity. 
---
No worries… even if you escape you'll have to do an other trial. Just enjoy your free time.
---
Couldn’t of said it better myself
---
We love Sydney but Laurie already fits the final girl archetype whereas Randy would be the “Horror Survivalists” he’s the guy who’s ready for the zombie apocalypse, he’s the guy who knows what to do when he’s chased by a slasher, hell he probably already knows the best ways to fight leatherface freddy and Michael Myers
---
*at least
---
Me likes. Upvoted.
---
Holy shit the hatchet is beautiful. And the rest of the cosplay is really good too
---
Thanks, edited it.
---
Holy fuck you're butthurt.
---
I was making a Weeb joke and referring to the popular "OwO what's dis?" copypasta. You clearly can't take a joke and seem to think any negative jab or joke made against you is a personal insult.
---
Next time, actually use your brain before you insult someone.
---
He’s basically the mouthpiece o the movies and Sydney is just as clueless to her own movie as anyone she just also happens to be the sole survivor
---
Well, telling this here won't make a difference so try your luck in the forums.
---
The old DS had a lot of counters, juggling, hitting or spinning to make the person miss, hell even the chance someone might miss on their own due to lag or lack of skill, then if someone else was the obsession, it was as good as useless because of the hook layout, you were never far enough away to wiggle enough to activate it. 
---
On top of that, when I did get DS, the stun wasn't very long and I'd get caught not long after, literally all DS guaranteed me was a few more moments with the killer in a chase so others could do things, but I'd still get hooked most of the time.
---
Ok I'm complaining about killing themselves for someone else, me complaining about a 3k? That's two totally different things. And to top yes I'm that everyone does it but u see it 3x as much with SWF, plus who cares if I complain about it? It doesn't stop the other 30 thousand ppl on here that complain on a daily basis about stuff that's just as bad or worse. And no, ur not giving criticism by calling someone "fucking silly" that's just disrespectful and that's why I'm getting upset. I didn't ask for u to come to my post and call me and the things I say "fucking silly". I made this post to rant just like every other post made on this subreddit. Sounds to me like ur just trying to be a troll.
---
Where? I have yet to encounter any. Nurses i go against struggle to get one kill.
---
Here is a link to my other video, which is me sharing my ideas to fix Ghost Face.
---
If you prefer playing survivor WGLF is a good farming perk
---
I feel like I'm in a huge minority, but for me it's always the goddamn David. Like fuck just because you're playing the guy doesnt mean you have to roleplay him my god
---
She looks like a little kid you tell to "stay still"
---
Grammy? That's awesome though. Really love the lamprey aspect to her mouth
---
Unfortunately I don’t have a clip as evidence, but there is actually a away to get behind the hooked survivor and unhook them while totally protected. Very similar to how it was shown here, you have to run forward to make the killer hit the hooked survivors hitbox, and then you can wedge yourself between the pole of the hook and the survivors body. As far as I know you can’t be hit because the hit box of the hooked guy will cover you. Then you can unhook them while facing the pole.
---
Yeah but Sidney is also highly self aware as well. There’s a big reason she’s survived all 4 movies. I love Randy but I feel like if they used the Scream license they’d HAVE to use Sidney, since there would be no Ghostface without Sidney.
---
Playing Frank as the Legion is like playing Spy and not being a weeb. A surprise sure but a welcome one.
---
With as many comments that I’ve seen the past few days, I’m going to go ahead and say that the pig the most beloved killer.
---
ONE QUARTER PORTION
---
How the fudge could you take " **pounces on me and rubbies my bulgy wolby** " seriously?   
---
Even the word **Weeb** is almost never said seriously.   
---
Yes not everyone will get jokes but you appear to know what "Weeb" means so why wouldn't you get the Sarcasm of " pounces on me and rubbies my bulgy wolby "?
---
And still, Even if I was "Insulting" your art. Reacting like that is really childish, And stating shit like **"  If you are here to cry and bitching about the fact that u have no original ideas nor drawing skill then bye bye "** is even more pathetic and childish.
---
Hey dude, I checked out your video. My question is when you talk does your recording software lower the volume of the game itself or is that something you do in editing? Your commentary is smooth. I wouldn't mind listening to your voice, however I found a lot of the footage a little dry with very little action. I would suggest editing most of the boring stuff out. Adding in some background music would go a long way as well. Either way I left you a like and subscribed.  
---
I would like to ask you to check out my video as well and let me know what you think in the comments. I will say that this one was intended to be funny but I do NOT like my commentary at all. Check it out:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB5SBVT45pQ&amp;t=157s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB5SBVT45pQ&amp;t=157s)
---
Do you want me to be honest or just like and act like everything's alright? He is a 1 shot killer and the only way to counter him is by looking at him if they make it too high he will be broken if it's too low he'll be trash he needs to walk a thin line of being good or shit tier.
---
“You didn’t kill me the way I wanted you to kill me”
---
this is absolute fire
---
That’s a lot better than your first comment! At least there is some hope in it. Being honest is fine and all, but at least leave something in there that offers some type of positivity.
---
thats actually quite funny you are trying to defend the game. 
---
"No its not a bug, its a feature"
---
I hear that, just saying it's a counter to dealing with survivors getting hatch or taking too long. You just end up holding the game hostage as a killer. It's definitely not something that's good for the game, either.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/5ZjKcmU
---
Wife her
---
It is a feature tho, im a myers main whenever im not playing pig /s
---
Please, screenshot the moment of the video where he could see at least tiny bit of me.
---
Because I'm sure this tire is much bigger than me :)
---
I would play games on PC but I don't want put in all of the effort to get decent on them. I can tell from Twitch/YouTube that there's a lot of hate in the chats
---
Even if they fix the bugs he will still just need to be looked at to be countered some of the seemingly good suggestions could make him overpowered or  just straight up annoying. They know he is broken and actively fixing the glitches and taking suggestions but he just seems like a killer that can easily be Broken or easily bad. I do think they can make him at least the closest they can to balanced i also think I was being harsh but Ghostface is in such a difficult spot to balance I don't think they'll fix him fully.
---
(I greatly appreciate your kindness, but I am a man)
---
Kung lao? Lol
---
legion taking the lead huh? Weird but I don't mind
---
you don’t get a free kill from egc? what?
---
Bond is an easy alternative
---
Go commit finger ring
---
i'm sorry to inform you and your friends, but character collision in Dbd is no big secret.
---
It's not a bug. It's a Splinter. You can see the offering in the screen shot.
---
I've been dreaming up of a sort of "score card" for killers and survivors. Something secondary to the rating system so you can actually rate individuals based on game performance. Results would stack from game to game and give you a professional grade that would be displayed in the lobby. All you would have to do is click an icon next to the name.
---
Again, this is all just something I've been dreaming up. I can design something and post it if would interest others...
---
Heres my suggestion!

I was playing on ps4 but my friends don't wanna play as much anymore so decided to play where I wanted to originally and play with my other friend that doesn't play because he has nobody to play with. Also they really do its sad but I feel like most of them are just trolling
---
I dont have a horse in this race, believe what you want to believe.
---
A "Kobe" is when you escape the hook by yourself...
---
Did you even read the offering you used? The Splinter? It lets you play as the Doctor for the match, without any perks or add-ons. 
---
The only buggy thing is how it displays on the endgame screen.
---
No, I mean faking the unhook, running through and unhooking after the killer attacks the hooked person. I’ve never seen anyone else do it and it’ll suck if killers start anticipating it.
---
You don't understand he is different then those other killers you can deny stalking by going behind corners or just hugging a wall with Billy but Ghostface has so many factors into him he can easily become broken or just stay bad if they remove the ability to deny his stalk by looking at him he'll be OP if they make the time too high to look at him he will be OP he is a very hard killer in my eyes to balance because if they make it so you have to stalk longer he'll be bad if they make the exposed effect go away fast he'll be bad or if they make it high. But again this is all opinion who knows maybe they'll make him perfectly fine.
---
Be rough, I like it that way.
---
Splinters are only for licenced killers. And he said there were two killers in the game, a doc (him) and a trapper
---
You made me more hungry :(
---
Self care is still a good perk. Its just you need to know when its worth it to heal, most people running selfcare run to a corner to heal every time they are injured. Its a timewaste you cant afford.
---
It’s console. There is no post game chat
---
Life has many hatches ed boy
---
The control scheme won’t matter much.  Just try to get use to whatever you feel is right the more you play with it the better you will play with it.
---
Thank you for finally giving some respect to Joey
---
So does Jakes, Francis skin from L4D
---
When you combine r/raimimemes and r/deadbydaylight
---
I don't want to be rude, but if you don't vote for Spirit, ur gay.
---
Clown doesn't have that high of a skill ceiling. You just need to know where to throw your bottles. That's it.
---
I nearly had a stroke reading that
---
No chance, I'm afraid. The release date is set and probably agreed-upon with Fun World.
---
It was if there werent 5 gens left lol
---
"I just don't believe they'll will make him good because they are afraid of the backlash they would get I mean look at Nurse and Hillbilly(besides Spirit because she has the highest skill cap) they are really only the good killers in the game and everyone complains about them."
---
It's hard to complain about a killer that requires knowledge of how it works, tactics, and the skill required to use it. The killers you mentioned usually can't be played and mastered easily, it's the individual players skill with the killer making them such a strong killer. A good player can demolish people with even the "worst" killers.
---
Legion upon release was easy enough to play and ruin people's experience with the game because the skill cap was low and his power made the game drag on with the constant need to mend.
---
The key is balance. The community of people who know what they're doing VS each killer can tell you a counter to every killer.  He can be balanced.
---
Bloody awesome
---
I'm pretty sure this is true if you let go of shift, or whatever button makes you sprint on consoles.
---
I disagree with Bubba being so high. Clown needs to be up in his spot. Maybe Plague in B.
---
i'd like a human without masks, without outfits, without scars, etc. Just a normal murderer that accepted to be in the realms of the entity
---
Im very curious if anyone will earnestly try to argue against you on this
---
I don't agree with camping, but I feel like the people who downvoted this comment have absolutely zero self-awareness, and that shit's fucking hilarious to me.
---
Do you think having your right Stick click as using an item is good?
---
I don't think slugging os toxic it's just annoying having to be on the ground for 90 % of the match
---
You game failed to load a graphic. it's a pretty common bug I've seen a lot of before.
---
Borrowed is for hook divers.  Doesn't effect yourself if you unhook with Deliverance.
---
I'll farm if survivors show they are interested. As survivor I'll max out any categories I can, and be on my way.
---
Farming is boring I agree, but it's a refreshing change of pace from the sweaty tunnelers that deny their target a chance of getting their time and effort's worth out of the match.
---
Have buffs been confirmed, or are we just speculating that the devs will only buff him the slightest amount?
---
Wasn't this already posted?
---
yes i have used references! i just looked up for "ninja axe reference" and saved the first result
---
You're gonna get a lot of hate, bud.
---
You think that's bad? I literally played a game today where all the pallets were INVISIBLE for me. I see a Claudette just standing in an empty space and all of a sudden I get smacked by literally nothing.
---
NO0B3
---
Is it? I thought they fixed that last update. The Splinter is there though.
---
Yes! I love his dino dick too
---
I know that I just believe he can easily be bad or good as I've stated multiple times I just think he won't be good when he first releases just like Freddy. These Developers aren't the best at balancing so I just don't believe they'll fix him when he comes out but I'm sure they'll fix it in like 2 months as he is such a complex Killer im trying to be as nice as I can it's just it's annoying seeing a killer you are very excited for be in such an awkward position.
---
Ummm ya never sell out your teammates... that was dirty!!  Secondly dont chase after people to heal them such a qaste of time...  I'd switch well make it for borrowed  time..
---
Yes it's just you
---
Personally, I wouldn’t use that but if you feel that works then go for it
---
Always nice to see someone punished for being a douchebag.
---
My personal favorite is when she slow crouches all the way to the hook just to unhook you and ran away with her fucking sprint burst, triggering alllll the traps and getting me hooked again🙃
---
Thank you for giving love to the plague
---
Mostly accurate but i'd move hag a little bit higher. Also "fedora man is bottom tier lmao" doesn't apply here, his transition mindgames and strategical gameplay aren't easy to learn
---
Maybe the splinter didn't work because of the two killer bug. Idk. Guess they didn't fix it
---
Looks like a dark souls boss. Nice.
---
Oooh yeah I've totally seen these, they're all the fake throwing axes all over commercial brands (I throw axes as a hobby) yeah these things look really nice, dont really function, but def look cool, nice
---
Ruin is a necessity on all Killers past rank 12. Aside from that, I always run BBQ for those BP boosters. I have a habit of changing my other two perks though.
---
I bought PGTW with shards since it’s in the shrine  - I plan to use it on the doctor since PGTW is getting a buff that will help slower killers.
---
I agree, but it should be physically look at him for x seconds, that way mew cant just stop your gen, spin in a circle, and get back on it
---
I loved watching Uberhaxornova and his friend play through this back in the day. It was hilarious.
---
Yeah, by me. A day ago, i fought i should drop it again, as ghostface poo on the floor
---
Just go with it and use the most op add-ons then they get even more salty which is fun.
---
most killers with a 24 meters or smaller terror radius can make a good use of it. It's also kinda decent on legion, but only kinda
---
Dont hold the survivor during the last few seconds of end game.. killers are toxic assholes.. he got what he deserved..
---
Wondering though, how did you make the hatchet? I see you 3d printed (and painted?) the mask, but how did you do the hatchet?
---
I not once said to remove the ability to stop him from stalking. I only said it needs tweaked. As
---
"/Beneficial_read" said, there are many one hit killers, all with their own way to counter them.
---
If they tweak him now, and release him in a brokenly op status, then your right. People will complain and they will end up nerfing him. Having a second ptb to verify that he is in a state where he can enter the official game in a working, usable manner would be best in this case.
---
Checkerboards have hearts too
---
Fair enough, I see what you're saying. It's probably a 50/50 split on trolling and being serious
---
I have most characters with good perks maxed (Meg, Nea, David, etc) but I had never used Ace before. The only reason I started using Ace is because I think he has some of the funniest cosmetics. I spent about 750k bp on Ace to try getting my usual perks on him but i was unable to. I have sense switched out We’ll make it for BT until I get We’re Gonna Live Forever which I always use for the extra bp. Also thanks for watching and the feedback!
---
Love Playing Myers.
---
Hate Playing Huntress.
---
Like going against Pig.
---
Hate going against Freddy.
---
Well Make It is one of my favourite perks of all time. 100% healing speed after the unhook is fantastic
---
I was so bad at catching people in my last game they probably thought I wasn't hooking them intentionally. 
---
Thankfully I still got 2k out of it but it was close.
---
Great work. 5 hours well spent!
---
Ding Dong Bing Bong
---
Wasted money? Yeah, every single cosmetic on Legion. Playing Susie skin? Mostly not. Watched Mirai Nikki? Great Anime, tho I'm over my edgy teen phase...dark times. But I can't deny those cosmetics look sweet XD
---
Does the breakdown breaks the hook permanently? Or does it comes back like sabotage after a while?
---
Why do you say that?
---
Hag.  She is beautiful in every way.
---
It looks like kung lao from mortal kombat
---
ohh! i didnt know that........ thank you!
---
r/Theportalhasopened
---
Hey that's me
---
If I may ask what's up with this build it's pretty close to mine except I have balanced landing instead of empathy.
---
I hate so fucking much the forced camera rotation when you trigger one
---
Same here just played against the most infuriating David earlier on Xbox. 
---
Fucking dude had MoM, Adrenaline Rush, Decisive Strike and Unbreakable maybe. I got baited at first and just leaved the fuck out of him after I wasted so many time on him. Still got two of them but damn I wanted to crush his brain with the hatch metal door.
---
That’s awesome
---
Oh ok I understand better now. But yeah even if you don't hear the heartbeat, if you can see Freddy, then it's not much of a disadvantage.
---
But thank you for clarifying!
---
I heard that:
---
If there is all survivors alive, the hatch won't spawn till 3 gens have been done
---
If 3 survivors are alive, 2 gens need to be done 
---
(Now it doesn't matter since they changed it...)
---
4 perks that must counter as much as possible vs 16 perks that counter possibly every common Killer loadout and playstyle.
---
Discordance isn't a strong perk either. It does nothing to either of the people working on the generator. Not like the other person not getting chased can't resume the work on it.
---
It's a little like a horrible, gory groundhog day for the survivors, isn't it? What if the killers we're actually former survivors who succumbed to madness and harnessed the entity's powers?
---
Why are all the dumb Davids on xbox?!?!?!
---
You're using Hag exactly as she was intended.
---
I can die now.
---
I don't know who that is but from google searches the colors are similar but his clothes are all chinese.
---
no you keep pressing shift and while vaulting it doesn't count as a sprint.
---
I just started this game last week and yeah Claudette is so fucking scared like it’s always the last one I see running frantically with a toolbox in hand.
---
Well kung lao is a chinese monk. This skins clothing is more traditional. (Btw im not tryina bash the skin its actually pretty nice).
---
Huh, interesting. I did not know that.
---
No, it’s happened a lot, I even lost my save file but I was lucky it came back for some reason. Save file deletion is and still is a big problem but usually behavior can give you bp (usually 26million) to get back progress
---
I think Ghostface will end up sitting at the middle/ upper tiers once he is revised. The community as a whole is underwhelmed by ghostface's current condition, he is very meh.
---
There is plenty of time to fix him, hence why every killer/survivor goes through a ptb. This killer at current is broken to the point of being nearly a m1 killer, which wouldn't be bad if he were intended to be this way... He is not. 
---
Going forward I think a double ptb phase, or an emergency secondary ptb phase is better than releasing something broken to fix later.
---
Got some good games as the Trapper level 12 Killer today. 
---
Like 4 gens left at the end 3 injured in 3 minutes at beginning, people running in traps in front of palets and windows left and right triggering that sweet snap sound. 
---
Started the game last week and it’s awesome !
---
Hey I faced this guy as billy today.
---
The hook auto-repairs after 180 seconds.
---
I dunno man and like half the Killers play Wraith lol I can’t stand that bell sound anymore that’s why I play killer now!
---
Tunneling is too scary right now with BT and DS in play, and it’s so much better to have two survivors pressured than one constantly. Tunneling is bad for everyone really
---
Bodyblocking with Wraith though is 100% fair tactics and smart, predicting where a survivor would go and stopping them getting to that pallet/vault. I’m assuming you mean the ones that won’t even hit you, but hold you in a corner. Pure toxicity. Bing Bongs are nice, don’t mind our outcast brethren they don’t speak for the clan
---
When you put more time in drawing the killer than behaviour puts in to think About his power
---
I was gonna 4 man SWF that shit with that fucking offering that makes hooks appear with more distance.
---
The skin I drew is more traditional to South Korean culture it's not really the same. And thanks for the two-sided compliment.
---
“Man, I wonder what this big ole generator is doing here.”
---
Joey is underrated
---
Frank and Joey really need a bit of appreciation.
---
I agree, it's terrible right now. I love the game but these queue times have gotten atrocious.
---
Yo u/GlenOck there is pig in this
---
The survivor loses the ability to hug Myers after the first time it is done
---
Don’t say that killers will say it’s broken and needs to be nerfed, we need to be exhausted 24/7
---
I played the game after not for a while and found a red envelope on my trapper, I know the feeling lmao
---
Yeah that’s me two weeks ago. Everyone is scared of you and miss skillchecks. I miss those games because now at rank 11 I get tryhards Megs with flashlights, troll Davids with MoM and Decisive Strike and Clauds that do gens in like 12 seconds.
---
I upvoted. Thabks for the heads up.
---
If they change to 100%, people will still not gonna use it.
---
This looks so dope!🤩🖤
---
You hit me with that Peacekeeper and Nobubu comment. I was denying being profiled until you threw that in my face 😭
---
You tell me. I think frank is the best looking legion member tbh. I don't really dig Joey's edgy style.
---
Meg is a stupid yeeyee ass looking bitch and anyone who mains her doesn't deserve basic human rights
---
I camped one Claudette today, she kept on blinding me EVERYTIME I picked someone. Like she didn’t care about gens just followed me around until I chased and got someone. 
---
I hard facecamped her like looked her in the eyes from 20cm until she died screaming impaled by the Entity like she deserved to.
---
It's just my educated guess. If there was somehow a way to instantly power a gen it would likely be similar.
---
I’d use it
---
Gideon should be this games rust.
---
Sure, that's why they are doing, for example, a freddy rework... It's on us guys LUL
---
Came here to say the exact same thing. However I applaud this mans bravery to still post it.
---
Doctor’s cosmetics are the best, specially the business suit(black one).
---
We out here
---
Did not know there was a David torso flair until now.
---
Its made of foam :)

I still never faced The Cannibal on Xbox lmao. Only saw Legion, Pig, Clown and Plague once so far. 
---
Have fun mate !!
---
bruh I bet you fap to Jane
---
You too, mate!
---
What do you have it as? What about sprint?
---
Meta play, use Sprint Burst, get it down to a 1 second cooldown, do a fast vault and make the killer think you are using Lithe. 300iq outplayed 
---
You'd be surprised.
---
This isn't true because isn't good enough to be able to down a survivor
---
It’s random but in certain maps it is known to appear in certain places. In Badham preschool the hatch is most likely going to spawn next to the generator in the boiler room and in one of the coldwind farm maps the hatch will spawn on the second floor of the house (logic)
---
Imagine not using adrenaline in 2019. /s

Those are dope! Super jelly!

---
He clearly just outplayed you.
---
I was actually doing that
---
I changed the locker/vault/pallet button to Square (X) so I can heal people under pallets, lots of lower rank survivors haven't changed it and it gets quite annoying when they drop a pallet on you when they try to heal. 
---
Also make sure your activate ability (dead hard, pebble ect) are on a button like X (A) so it is easy to activate and doesn't interfere with other actions.
---
Indeed his perks are utter garbage
---
It’s best to just ignore them. Some, not all survivors can’t accept the fact that they lost and will make up any nonsense they can to make you seem like the bad guy and that you did something bad or cheated
---
He delivered a well thought out response
---
This is not happening is terrible. we'll make it was close to being top tier for a long time
---
They went off in my profile comments too, it was funny as tbh

That's 2019 for you :)

I’m sure plenty of people here wouldn’t mind doing a KYF with you that understands and would help you! Ask around.  I think there’s a subreddit also for people to play with, I just don’t know what it is
---
I thought they fixed the all seeing Myers glitch a long time ago.
---
I think everything should stay default.
---
But, Pallets and Windows etc. should be RB.
---
Gens and Healing etc. should be RT
---
And Items should be some other button. I chose Y.
---
Hell yes fanfic time
---
Pig is better and more fun to play.
---
I only heard about this with no0b3, who else had the same issue?
---
Gen interaction is L1 (left bumper), Vault/Pallet/Locker is Square (X), Dead Hard is X (A), Crouch is L2 (left trigger), Skill checks are Circle (B), Running is R1 (right bumper)
---
I'd switch the bumper and trigger interactions though as you are on Xbox.

I love it when people talk about gens speed but never offer ANY helpful advice for what can be done to make it more fair and fun for both sides.
---
Also the new DS will not activate unless you tunnel as killer, that would be their fault.
---
MoM Is one of few annoyingly "OP" perks survivors have but yet only about 2 months after it was released the dev's plan on nerfing it. protective hits will just make it buggy and only strong for SWF which so many people complain about here.
---
Survivors hardly have it any better at red ranks as a lot of players run meta perks on both sides.
---
ZubatLEL and almost me, but I’ve heard of countless other stories of this
---
No
---
I haven’t seen anyone on this subreddit say that ghostface is op.
---
Huh. I still think its kind of garbage to just Have to live with losing it.
---
It also made it much more tedious for solo survivors which no one ever talks about.
---
I have become a Killer main 60% to my survivor playtime which is around 40%, because i hate dealing with teammates who don't plan ahead and communicate and the epidemic of camping and tunneling on PS4. 
---
I swear even when i escape a game alive I didn't have fun compared to when i have been sacrificed/mori'd but still had a blast.
---
It’s all RNG... and bad RNG at that. After I unlocked BBQ in the Shrine it took me 37 Bloodwebs to get it on my Doctor. 11 more Bloodwebs later and I still only have Tier 1.
---
Bruh
---
Do it no balls
---
I have to constantly spend points to not be at a million lol. Don’t know if you’re serious?
---
she will definitely appreciate that comment. thanks for the kind words!
---
*dubve_770 has left the chat*
---
Honest question, is it not camping when you put a trap st the hook and then immediately teleport back when it gets set off?
---
Of course its my fault when the five gens are ready in foor minutes
---
Doesn't have a survivor OR a map. and it's referred to as a full chapter and is treated as such. I know Leatherface and Bill came solo, but they didn't take the full 3 MONTH cycle for them to come out as a "chapter" And having had Ash added in isn't even an excuse as much as I love Bruce Campbell and the Evil Dead franchise this doesn't compensate for not getting a map in the time spand of three months.. (or even a mere map variation AT LEAST)
---
But yes overall I was super excited, but ended up being disappointed. And that's coming from a big Scream/Ghostface fan, very let down here. Would've even preferred an original chapter over this.
---
I've just recently been going for teachables, so any bloodpoints I had stored didn't last long
---
thanks mate! I am super happy with the way they turned out
---
The gainesville one I think.
---
or here's a REALLY GOOD buff idea.
---
- *Ghostface cannot be broken out of stalk/stealth mode.*
---
He hit them three times. If he didn't, he would've gotten body blocked. If he put the survivor down, they would've used the Insta heal on them
---
I agree on the outfit thing. It makes Ghostface look like he's the Grim Reaper or something and not actually like Ghostface. The three stripes on the top of his head look weird and don't match his outfit. The ripped pieces of cloth float behind him like he's supernatural or something when he's not.
---
You're right, I must correct myself. It is IMPOSSIBLE to get a gate open before you're found unless your killer is an utter potato.
---
&gt;(or even a mere map variation AT LEAST)
---
I heard Springwood, Haddonfield, and other maps were getting some variations added to the game.
---
I do think he has the best(kinda hard since I love clowns cosmetics) non licensed character cosmetics but since we are comparing prestige clothing Ghostface is just a little bit better then Doctors
---
These look better than the ones in game. Really nice job!
---
This ghost face is independent, he just kills people’s whatever. But remember Sydney is still alive Randy died in scream 2 witch gives him a perfect “in” to the world of DBD. And unlike Sydney who’s character already has representation in the form of Laurie Randy would be a new kind of survivor, he knows he’s in a game or at least that the realm he’s in plays by rules, I guess he’s similar to feng in that regard but I think he’s different enough. Also why does every slasher have to be paired with a female to stalk and kill? Randy also final girl’d in the first Scream.
---
I played against a hag who would put them all in one area, and I died because I couldn’t leave the area because the camera kept turning.
---
It's a race!
---
We aren't getting any new maps/variations or anything until Freddy rework. which is in about a month and a half.
---
Well I tried it the nice route so just because you can't do it doesn't mean it's impossible.
---
It's again it's been done multiple times if you find it so impossible maybe that's a problem with you.
---
Oh really? that's nice!
---
Must be the Nurse since she doesn't break hers.
---
Huntress is free. Everyone else is 500 auric cells ($5) **alone**. The whole chapter in other words killer and survivor is $7 I think
---
Might as well make a spriggan while you're at it. But that would probably be hag because claws and nature.
---
get this old man some smokes. this old retired soldier deserves some.
---
I think Ghostface is getting a red cloak with the devil outfit but then again it does cost cash. I don't get why everyone hates his design I absolutely love it to death but yeah besides that you are pretty damn accurate.
---
It works on every killer well except Spirit and maybe Doctor unless you want to do a small terror radius on him.
---
I don't like it on Spirit because it screws up her hearing distance of phasewalking. Since it'll blow up from 16 to 32, I can't really leave a chase to change focus to a gen nearby with 16m radius without alerting survivors. 
---
24m is the sweetspot, not so big but small enough to catch survivors off guard with a faint terror radius. Good Spirits will abuse their terror radius and not just to pallet mindgame in chase. 
---
I act like I am chasing a survivor but I leave my radius right at 23 meters on a gen. Survivors get caught off guard and I can get at least like 2 gen grabs in a game unless the survivors have Spine Chill or pay attention to the faint terror radius.
---
It keeps up good map pressure. If a survivor is grabbed that gives the killer good pressure fast. The survivor that was chased will still be pressured by phase walk until the husk disappears. 
---
Discordance and Surveillance are good perks to attempt gen grabs.
---
I also hate Prayer Beads so I don't use that dumb crap.
---
He makes some good points but the hex totem  proposal is a bit too strong. 
---
If something like this would ever come in play ruin would just be even more common place and they will always see out the most secluded or easily patrolled area.
---
Swap trapper with LF
---
I was think that was like L1
---
Imo those streamers, like noob3, should never have gotten banned for wanting their legacy back after the game just deleted their save file. You shouldn’t punish your players for wanting something back that took a lot of time to get when your broken game decides to randomly delete people’s save files. It’s not like they didn’t have the legacy in the first place, they just want it back. Now, exploiting bugs and shit in public matches for your personal benefit is a whole other story and people should 100% be banned for that shit.
---
Well, hooks auto repair no matter how they’re sabatoged, it just changes how long depending on how it was done
---
Go commit finger... ING?
---
Tell that to all the shit posts which get up-voted for things like. 
---
LoLz I gOt a SuRvIvOr tO dC!
---
If helps i would like to genuinely hear your thoughts on this.
---
It’s camping by proxy imho
---
I don't condone dcing, but I still don't like Legion the way he is. His ability is still very linear. First hit free, second hit M1 to death is a really boring playstyle to play and play against alike. He's better, but not fixed imo.
---
&gt;without her, there’d be no ghost face at all.
---
Dude ghostface exists because wes craven really likes the look of the peanut eyed ghost mask. The mask and the movie scream are not the same thing. All I’m saying is that I would prefer Randy because as a survivor because he’s funny and meta and Sydney would just be a funnier Laurie.
---
Meg and Feng mains*
---
Hard to swallow pills. Getting downed doesn't mean you should dc
---
His stun noise makes him sound like an actual ghost too but maybe that’s just the aesthetic they were going for
---
Yea there's an emblem for keeping people off of those.
---
if you are chasing a survivor who know how to loop and knows the layout of the map, you should break the chase and go after weaker survivors.
---
it's not a sure fire thing but it helps.
---
Age of consent in UK
---
Make fun of her knees
---
Hard to swallow pills. Getting mori'd isn't unfair, you were just stupid enough to get knocked right after getting saved
---
thanks!!!!! 👽👽👽
---
everyone seems pretty maxed out for a rank 12 game
---
I'm most disappointed by the fact that we'll have to wait until September 2021 for it...
---
I meant in the Scream universe. Which is where Randy is from, dude. I don’t think you understand what I’m saying at all. If they wanted Randy as a survivor it’d have to be a Scream movie chapter since he’s a character from the movie. Therefore, if they were to hypothetically do a Scream movie chapter, I’d much prefer Sidney because her and her mother are the sole reason the Scream movies even happened.
---
Actually pretty damn clean, nice work of your girlfriend!
---
The blade as well? Because you got that older, slightly dull shine / rust look down pact!
---
Maps are still awful. They are either killer or survivor sided. Even i have to admit Balanced landing on Haddonfield is a nightmare.
---
Oh ok :p
---
Eh I somewhat agree. Nurse, Billy and Spirit players have no excuse, but the rest of the cast are still woefully weak and near unplayable without Ruin.
---
Ruin is a huge problem in this game. If you buff killers so they're stronger without Ruin, they become oppresive with Ruin. It needs to be nerfed and survivors slowed down in some fashion or another to make up for it. Continuing to balance around this polarising perk is hurting balance a lot.
---
This is essentially Fragrant Tuft Myers, but with no terror radius.
---
honestly both the perks are get out of jail free cards. #noskill
---
I agree! Just like getting your hex totem destroyed doesn't means you should DC.
---
"I guess she had to go!"
---
haha thank you!
---
Of course, they are in the blood web after all. 
---
Just like a survivor getting a flashlight save because the killer was stupid enough not to face a wall while picking up a survivor.
---
F
---
would you do it if they gave you more benefits?
---
Okay fair points might try changing my build I've recently been playing around with diversion
---
;)
---
Try finger but hole
---
im pretty sure ive seen youtubers do that before
---
Doing gens, you?
---
If they trigger the trap not 5 seconds after it's placed, I'm coming back right away. Survivors should be smart enough to wait for Hag to get out of range tbh.
---
I apply to none of these except knowing when to use feral frenzy. I love Frank and Joey! Anime is stupid tbh.
---
Oh fak
---
Owo
---
He has a learning curve but when mastered he can shut down any loops with the right Add ons and build
---
I about died laughing this morning when adrenaline hit after my post hit stun was finished and I dropped the survivor a second time.
---
Haven't gotten any so im good ^-^
---
i cannot imagine a knight in shining white for some reason
---
Streamers do it literally all the time...This is some special snowflake ass shit lol.
---
Watch any VoD from kittychipz or Jendenise and youll see it.
---
Omg they need to change this, it's so irritating
---
Shit there's actually a Claudette here
---
So you're saying that the best strat against a good survivor is to leave them. If all survivors are good you'll just get rushed and lose. 
---
But "balanced"
---
Then I suppose you're one of the rare Legions
---
Billy is one of the easiest to learn and one of the stronger killers.
---
I thought you were just making a bad joke for a second but there actually is lol
---
I despise him personally. Every game when I play survivor seems to be a Billy, I don’t want to add to that.
---
Michael then, he's my favorite
---
Legion. I know this Reddit hates them, but they're honestly really fun to play and can vault (although slowly now after the rework). I would personally consider them m1 since their power has been murdered, although I guess it's still usable.
---
Lmao that killer was so bad,ggwp Dwight
---
She's a keeper!
---
Remove ruin’s hex effect, make it a token system. Each survivor must deal with X ruin skillchecks. Token are consumed upon great skill checks and good skill checks. Ruin’s effects end for that survivor when all tokens are consumed. Makes it consistent, but not too powerful. It’s really an early game stall. Maybe add a single token to every survivor’s pool upon hooking a survivor for the first time.
---
Ghostface.
---
Ok I'll start doing this . Delet this
---
Kind of unrelated but I’m worried this might also be toxic on my part, is downing a survivor and then running off to chase another nearby survivor considered poor form?
---
Lol, "Adrenaline is skill"
---
Have you seen this sub-reddit? Everyday there are Shitposts talking smack about survivors and "making killers scary again"
---
You have it backwards.
---
What I mean is that sometimes you have team mates that do nothing but still benefit from adrenaline. It's a good suggestion, it just feels too one sided imo.
---
Really? In my opinion Michael scared the living hell out of me when I first played against him. When I heard his theme song blasting in my ear I couldn’t even concentrate
---
Get Jeff
---
She should make them on Etsy I’m totally thinking about getting my own perk build for my wall
---
I would love to think of a whole bunch of attacks and encounters for the Killers and Survivors, this is really creative and I hope you get this done :)
---
Thank you!! I’m pretty proud of em :)
---
it’s like I’m runnin’ Ace in the Hole irl
---
Try doctor at rank 1
---
We Hags love making you bump into walls with our traps &gt;:3
---
We will definitely work on that! Thank you :)  message me if you’re interested
---
And what do you suggest? I'm all ears.
---
Also please don't put words in my mouth I said it's not a surefire strat but it is better then going after the survivor who has 800 hours on DbD vs a survivor who just has 100.
---
Just because they’re rank 20 doesn’t mean they don’t have money
---
Bruh it’s the weeb memo to eat up being called a weeb
---
Try solo survivor at rank 1.
---
It's gonna take them more then bloddy 5 hours to fix him, but you already mastered your field of play I see. Good Job! He is bloddy brilliant!
---
He should just be on there four times
---

Also Amanda doesn't oink; she sneezes like a puppy when her snoot gets booped.

Thats the point.

I full on thought this was gonna be a satire post as someone 3 years in the future complaining about the PTB for Chapter 21.

---
Now this is what I was expecting coming into this thread lol
---
Once 60 fps on console has been achieved I think crossplay would be fine, and the advantage quicker queue times would outweigh any disadvantages. On DBD, Keyboard and mouse isn’t hugely better than controller compared to other games like FPSs (ignoring the huntress and the nurse, but even then the nurse is mostly bad on console because of the frames not controller), and on survivor it doesn’t really make a difference at all. I play on both and I’m a rank 5 killer on PC (using controller) and rank 3 on ps4. 
---
The ranking system would mean that it gets balanced out by most console players just being slightly lower than PC players, but even then I think rank 1 would still be possible on console. 
---
The only problem I think would be Bill, as valve might not want him appearing on consoles. But if he did, then it’s kinda like an advertisement to console players to get the PC version to play him.
---
80% Escape rate on Rank 1.....most played Killer is Nurse, this doesn't sounds like fun to me buddy! But sure the devs aren't responsible for the balance, sure.
---
