I would get Oni - mainly because as a survivor main, I absolutely loathe coming across Plague. So boring.
---
---
---
Seems pretty toxic all around
---
Anything Hag
---

---
Don't want her coming near me unless I have a power washer ready.
---
I love to think at the end they start flaming the Feng for not wiggling.
---
Against one shot people, it's basically over powered, and everyone is not going to or not able to cleanse, so it fucks everyone over.
---
It doesn't work out the way you guys are saying.
---
I honestly feel like Tru3 insults people whenever he can
---
That last sentence is cursed. I do not want to click that link.
---
That's how you win games thoüòé
---
Fuck sloppy but this change really isnt much of one, people run it for the slow down, which is why its so annoying
---
You can't rush anyone down when you have a 4 second stun every single time you use your power.
---
Addons that would increase the charges of a medkit don't do anything
---
Lmao those perks are forever cursed now to me.
---
They don't have the charges they are supposed to have
---
God fucking dammit I‚Äôve been wondering why it felt like there‚Äôs no difference. I wasted a ton of add ons lmao.
---
Imagine coming on reddit to boast about how you facecamped someone as the strongest killer in the game.
---
And taking a photo instead of just screencapping lmao.
---
I feel like leader and prove thyself together would be great but I really don't know how to use them, do you just glue yourself to other survivors?
---
I don't understand what your point is.
---
I can‚Äôt stand tru3, 50% whining 20% bitching 20% ‚Äúmind gaemz‚Äù 10% gameplay.
---
I legit didnt even notice. Damn, nice job
---
Your a good artist!!
---
"Tryna bust that NOED but killer keeps tunneling my ass"
---
Would a post making fun of Tru3 also be allowed? Or would a downvote and report be required there as well
---
And I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt take aggro, but if you spam them with a flashlight till they focus you that‚Äôs toxic.
---
That it isn't a bitch move? That letting survivors to do gens and give the impression that you're being nice until you slug them all down once noed is activated?
---
God help anyone who thinks otherwise.
---
Except
---
 I care
---
Don t worry freddy has been in a worse state for 2 years
---
what‚Äôs happening here?
---
That is not even that bad.
---
Me too
---
There all literally double my level
---
The only other way to level up the Rift besides the Tome Challenges is just to play the game as much as possible. 
---
It might be hard for you to max out now if i‚Äôm being honest depending on how many Tome Challenges you have left to complete.
---
I started at level 12, i‚Äôve done all the Challenges and I play for at least 20 hours a week and only just got to level 70 2 days ago.
---
You should see the amount of crap the mods remove on a daily basis..........
---
Imagine winning at rank 13
---
I mean the spy in tf2 basically does this and is arguably the most fun class in the game. 
---
It could be fun as killer if executed properly. 
---
As survivor it would suck ass though.
---
Meanwhile my stream is just me taking the blame for everything. Guess i have to be more arrogant to get those views.

Just play the game. That's literally it.

---
Whenever someone disagrees with him*
---
not a fan of Tru3 by any means but seeing it from Tru3's side, idk if I disagree with what he did. 
---
He only just barely opened the gate in time. I think the only wrong play was sitting in the exit gate then leaving when chat spooked him about BW

---
* *Platform:* Xbox One
---
* *Type of Bug:* Ingame
---
* *Description:* Can not play as either killer or survivor, or even join friends lobby.
---
* *Steps to reproduce:* Try pressing the Y button as a survivor or killer and you will never be able to join a lobby with the game wait to connect to one, and sometimes even getting into a lobby as killer, but ultimately being timed out before being told that you need to "Connect to Xbox Live" despite being connected to Xbox live. I have also seen NAT type error messages telling me to change my NAT type to Open, which it always has been and has never changed. 
---
* I feel as thought its important to note that I have also tested this on my sisters account through my Xbox but have not been able to join games through my Xbox. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled this game but it did not help my progress into getting into a game.
---
* *Expected result:* Getting into a lobby with friends, or playing the game as a killer or survivor on my own.
---
* *Actual result:* Getting "Connect to Xbox Live" messages, being told a host could not be found, or to "change my NAT type"
---
* *Reproduction rate:* Incredibly successful. Ever since I bought some auric cells on black Friday, bought some killers and Oni when he came out, an got him up to around Level 15, I haven't been able to connect to a match.
---
* I would like to also point out that this happened about a week after I bought killers/auric cells in this game so its kind of annoying that I spent money on the game only to be locked out of it completely and not able to even experience the people I have purchased.
---
I mean ya I have had that most of the time but you can even look up videos of it happening. I play Xbox. Idk if that would effect anything.
---
&gt;salty messages are like what baby boomer pussy tastes like...depends
---
The salty messages are against the subreddit rules. If you see them, report them.
---
So is spamming multiple iridescent emblems... common bugs...etc...etc
---
Haha survivor bad killer good
---
I wish I could tell that this is sarcasm, but I‚Äôm sure there are people in this community who really think this is a bug
---
Trapper either needs a new power or traps auto set via base kit and not add ons.
---
That's because most smart survivors use DH to get to a pallet/window. 
---
 I don't think it's OP(except nerf it so they can't go over fucking trapper's traps, that's some stupid shit), but it is really strong. It can especially when used right, act as the equivalent of another health state

Comparing TF2 to DBD I see

This post is just as pointless.
---

---
He‚Äôs not as bad as everyone makes him out to be. He‚Äôs definitely above the average player but can be easily annoyed.
---
the only time it can happen is when you get a 10 o'clock skill check so its pretty hardcore rng for the killer
---
Thank you!!
---
Yeah that sounds like a you problem, not a game problem, and when I mean a you problem I mean your internet, or sometimes when I‚Äôm versing a killer with shit internet it can effect the survivors in my game and make us laggy so it could be that, it‚Äôs not the game it‚Äôs the people connecting to it, if the problem is a constant thing though then it‚Äôs probably your internet
---
I think it could have been better but the concept of it was interesting enough for me to enjoy it
---
Not even close to the top 5
---
Gonna save this for next time someone complains
---
Well the main change is to make Sloppy Butcher work with specific attacks and the Hemorrhage modifications cause the Status Effect to be easier to understand and write in a description format.
---
Obviously this isn't a huge must have change, but this would still be good for streamlining Hemorrhage and clearing up the language used in Sloppy Butcher.
---
Hold your pitchforks guys. I don't know this Ussylis guy, but he has a point. If a survivor is being held hostage by a killer or because of a game breaking bug, they could be penalized. Same for when a survivor has to dc because of a IRL emergency/urgency. He is also not wrong that many people who do dc often are going to adapt and improvise by killing themselves on the hook. For example, if a survivor wants to rage quit, they can simply just run up to the killer, get downed and the once hooked they are going to attempt to struggle on hook (screw that 4% am I right?) and just suicide. Thus, causing the same effect of having a person DC (its the same as DC we have today, but just a few extra steps).
---
/r/dbdgonewild post it there
---
But have you experienced stridor metal spoon+ anxious grasp nurse? I'd chuck infectious fright in there but i dont have the plague so...
---
There are plenty of perks that are very commonly run that help the killer track the survivors
---
Just play Legion and listen to that killer track. Never gets oldüòé
---
im a survivor main &amp; i dont hate when they camp 1 because we can just gen rush his ass 2 yeah my blendette ass always see a david bum rushing the bill on the hook so i understand
---
I'v had the opposite experience since her nerf, any game i get against her its just the same build and even then its not even that effective
---
If you do it right you can run backwards.
---
Frankly
---
Have you listened to his voice like once he is not German lmao
---
Theres a difference from a hatchet that you have to aim and a move that you can just move your screen left and right to hit everything around you. I do agree with you though
---
People usually DC to screw over the killer. So giving yourself up would be good for the killer. Situations where a survivor has to DC because of a big or nowhere near as many as when survivors DC because they are mad. Also, if someone has to DC because of a bug they would get a short penalty.
---
If I could change DS, I would:
---
-make the timer longer (or not go down in a chase or something like that)
---
-make the timer instantly end if someone else is hooked
---
-make you unable to use it from lockers (even though I love to bluff having DS by hopping in lockers, despite not running it)
---
He does that because the Emblem system "forces" you to 4K. As a Killer every Kill matters if you want to pip. You can 4K and still depip. A Survivor can die and still pip easily. DC'ing also cucks the Killer of most Emblems so thats also toxic af and just bad manner in general. Slugging is just playing how the "Entity" wants you to play.
---
wish they'd just remove both
---
Gift wrapping instead of a sarashi actually sounds like a super neat cosmetic.
---
I'm gonna copy and paste this idea forever
---
1. Timer is 20 seconds
---
2. Pause timer while in a chase or downed
---
Hooking a Feng always gives me a headache
---
I love mad grit, even if it‚Äôs not that good
---
I dislike Oni but that makes it even more fun to go against him. He is hard asf to escape against but escaping isn't everything. Personally I see it as a win if i help someone else escape more than if i escape on my own. Every killer is powerful in their own right, same with survivors. But Oni is like this op hybrid killer. Hes huge, fast, and strong. It is absolutely terrifying fighting against him, which makes escaping so much more rewarding imo. At least, unlike Billy and Bubba, Oni has to meet certain requirements to one hit someone, a "charge" of sorts. In that aspect, Oni is much more balanced than other one shot killers.

---
And then they take it as bm and harass the shit out of you in post-game chat
---
I've gone up against a ton of Oni.
---
Lore wise it makes sense
---
For killers their job is to torment survivors and make them Lose hope which feeds the entity.
---
For Survivors they need to put themselves in dangerous situations and helping each other escape giving them hope that they can win.
---
All of them suck maybe empathy
---
Beach day DLC 
---
I want bikinis, one pieces, short shorts, speedos, floppy hats, everything beach theme!
---
Bro plug your shit and put it in the comments
---
I'd go with either Prove Thyself or Empathy. Mettle of Man is pretty bad now ever since the nerf.
---
You will be com banned which means you can't message people or join partied but still play games but not type or speak in them. This is for Xbox anyways
---
Is it a decent movie or is it just kinda neat that it's reminiscent of a DBD killer? I'm weirdly funny about leaving my comfort zone and trying new movies haha.
---
I very much agree but yeah only when he has his Dash up, and only on PC.
---
*21st Century
---
what would you recommend for solo
---
Empathy
---
Are there any killers that you can clearly see their face? Even counting skins the only one I can think of  who‚Äôs not completely distorted is clown and he‚Äôs got face paint
---
prove thyself for sure!! it‚Äôs on my standard build. bond is better to have than empathy, and it goes well with prove thyself
---
survivors when i play killer VS me when i play survivor
---
I'm glad you haven't been held hostage many times, but its not an excuse to put down his opinion. Its like saying, "diabetes isn't bad because only one person in my family has it." To elaborate, he is not saying that a single survivor is going to be held hostage many times therefore, causing him to be unjustifiably penalized for dcing. He is saying that many people within the community are going to/have already experience being held hostage or a game breaking bug in which they will be forced to dc, causing them to be penalized. Also, you have to take into account the many people who play DBD and suddenly they have an IRL emergency/urgency that needs to be attended to and they have to shutdown the game during a trial. Therefore, I think that there should be a grace period or certain measures in place to forgive players who are met with circumstantial situations that cause them to dc/quit mid-game.

Drop self care and run bond prove thyself. If you know where your teammates are you don‚Äôt need to heal yourself
---
I forgot to say, its PC that im talking about
---
I‚Äôm a blue haired feng , I do all the gens but I can confirm; can‚Äôt run the killer for shit.
---
did you get adept?
---
How exactly is it against the rules?
---
Sry if the questions sounds mean or smth, I'm genuinely curious.
---
How?
---
Restarting the game every 2 or so matches helps a bit but that‚Äôs really it.
---
I'm not usually one for cutesy art when it comes to our favourite murderers, but this makes me happy. Good job!
---
Rank 4, no one even got injured, I did 2 gens
---
Then my original point has more merit. Don't get into a chase until it wears off.
---
If anything the movie became more suspenseful once he took the mask off imo. That's the whole reason he did it. She tried bargaining with him to spare her life because she didn't know his identity and he basically solidified his intentions by removing the mask.
---
That it happened 3 times in one day you fucking shitfuck. You have to be totally brain dead to think that‚Äôs true
---
Good god. Does your mom tie your shoes?
---
Yah yah that now make sense just in my opinion it just scary when the killer is unknown
---
I said it because you made a comment about dribbling which isn‚Äôt a thing anymore? No need to get defensive, I was just letting you know when they changed it
---
It‚Äôs most likely because of this sub loving Otz, where as id say most of the player base has Tru‚Äôs mindset when playing.
---
I‚Äôm not saying we shouldn‚Äôt love Otz and shouldn‚Äôt try to be more positive, I‚Äôm just saying Tru isn‚Äôt out of the norm.
---
She is called The Pig because she wears a pig head. Remember she isn't wearing a full pig suit underneath her robe. She is just wearing a pig head which has a symbolic meaning behind it. Therefore, if she removes the pig head, she removes the only pig semblance she has and removing the significance behind her outfit.
---
It's hard to avoid chases when you have to do gens and the killer knows where said gens are. Plus theres tons of perks to help her
---
No this is the worst take. There‚Äôs a reason people found out the meta was stalling, it‚Äôs because their rush down sucks ass now with the insanely long stun. Even with add ons it‚Äôs just not good enough. Legion honestly needs a huge rework not little touches and changes. They to be a fast rush down killer, one that can vault pallets and windows and run fast with their ability, get a hit, do a wipe animation, then they are in normal mode until the power comes back. Something like that, it‚Äôs not hard.
---
Yeah fuck you automoderator
---
This is why I‚Äôve started sending killers gg after entertaining games, even if everyone did get wrecked
---
I know it seems like a pretty small dash, but it's a monumental distance gain in the context of a chase, and usually means the difference between reaching a pallet and getting downed.
---
Regardless, I'm assuming you're going for a stealthier playstyle, so you should probably run Sprint Burst instead of Dead Hard.
---
Horror cliches I think
---
Thank you, this helped me a lot
---
Too many people stroking his ego has ruined any fun I had in watching his stream.
---
Oddly enough the least played survivor is actually Jeff. Saw it in a poll and analysis, just forget who did it
---
I‚Äôve had this issue for 3 days now Dbd does not care sadly.
---
I thought they fixed this üòñ
---
This makes my grit mad
---
Those who have not experienced scooter ankle are too innocent to know, just hope it never happens to you
---
Hmmm I love traps.
---
The killers are obvious but the survivors are different. I'm pretty sure it's stated in the new archive lore that the entity slowly devours entire world's so the survivors are probably randomly selected depending on who's easier to take atm and it just goes until it sapped the world dry
---
Oh no it‚Äòs back
---
This leaves me very confused and I'm not happy about it
---
Well that‚Äôs good to know. I‚Äôm not mad or anything. More confused really. I got more pissed about getting dribbled out of DS than NOED or hex ruin. I didn‚Äôt play a few years ago when I‚Äôm guessing DS didn‚Äôt have a timer but a one time use? Based off noob3 vids.
---
I've had people charge at me after they got unhooked and be salty that I killed them. Bitch it's not tunneling if YOU come to ME
---
True story
---
Like I mentioned in my first comment, since the change of DS the skill check happens during the pick up animation so it‚Äòs impossible for the killer to dribble you. If it happened to you it must have been before the change.
---
Basically target the most vulnerable
---
Honestly Bubba doesn't need anything. If he's unfun he's unfun, he's not under powered though, and the stats showed that pretty well. 
---
He still has one shot and AOE one shot potential, and he's INCREDIBLY string with the basement. I constantly watch games go to complete shit with Bubba when people go for the wrong unhook at the wrong time, or they camp when there is an SWF.
---
If they Biff him he's gonna get close to or actually I've powered. I don't get how people can't see that. You can get a fucking glimpse of how his power could looks with Oni. No fucking thanks.
---
I really do not get this idea that all killers need to be too fucking tier. It's a dog shit mentality from people who want to 4K every game, or feel trapped because they're only willing to play the over powered or over performing (because of poor mechanics) killers. 
---
I'm really glad we got the stats, and I wish they was a constant thing we had. O know they won't do it because it would expose issues with how they buff and nerf things, but as a community I think we need it.
---
One shots need to be earned, and his really aren't. If he's not fun for you don't okay him, it doesn't mean he needs buffs.
---
I think you responded to the wrong person.
---
Oni fits tank. He even screams like him
---
"somehow". You over here being a damn liar
---
Got told I was using a exploit, asked which one so as not to do it again. Person said it's been too long to remember even though it was only just a few hours. So either he runs into a lot of exploits or just had a sucky excuse.
---
Shocktor Brother
---
Right, I understand that many people will just have that one emergency and that's it they won't get punished for it. BUT, what if its a person who dc'd because of bug or hostage situation or what if they had the emergency and next game they crash or get held up by the killer? I mean there are many factors, you can't just say that its one and done because many people that I talk to in the technical forums have reported that they crash many times due to pc bugs and the only way they can test it is to jump into a live game. I think overall its hard to predict when stuff like this can happen, but it does happen and its unfair to ignore it and just leave players getting unjustified penalties for something that is out of their control. I'm not saying the penalty feature is bad, its just flawed in my opinion and I think there should be a genuine grace period or a system that can detect whether a player is continuously leaving mid-game due to bug/pc failure rather than dcing willingly.
---
What is playing both sides so you understand the other one better. /s
---
Yeah she already has the passive bonus, why can't the others get one?
---
I wasn't sure about Oni or Nurse either, but I've been having a ton of fun with Oni ever since he released on Tuesday and thought he was really strong so I put him in top tier. I almost put Ghostface and Myers above Nurse as well because of the Nurse nerfs, but in the end I decided she was still pretty strong but just not the absolute best.
---
I thought that originally but then i tried picturing a tank with a katana and laughed for a few minutes.
---
Maybe Charger?
---
They won't go down unless they're complete bots. It basically just forces them to heal one extra health state once they're not in your terror radius.
---
The playerbase was 100x nicer than dbd's and way less sweaty. It wasn't their fault it died it was the devs and the legal issues purely.
---
No you would be really REALLY surprised what PlayStation deems bannable/reportable etc
---
Nurse, oni, and nightmare wont make sense. the oni isnt a ghost, freddy doesnt fuck around with that, and nurse just doesnt need to be blinking when she isnt
---
They will just go down if they don't mend before the timer hits zero (if they are mending when it hits zero they are safe to finish) deerstalker would be useful in this case but tbh it's rare that I actually see someone go down to deep wound so I wouldn't pick a perk just for when they do.
---
That‚Äôs coward talk my friend
---
Same here
---
My experience with most killers, especially at red ranks, treat this game like it's LoL or CSGO which is sort of embarrassing because the skill cap on this game, for killer included is nowhere near those games. I assume they suck on everything else so pretty much have to grab wins whenever they can on a game like this.
---
[removed]
---
Mad Britts
---
They're closing them at the end of the year, so this month is free to play since it's dying in a month.
---
Yeah maybe
---
Especially if you played spirit
---
I would say probably not, but in the realm of the entity, suffering is not an unusual occurrence, so I wouldn't mark it as impossible personally.
---
It's pretty hard to get impressed by the same red jpg for the 30th time in a row.
---
... oh yeah. 
---
Could give him like a car part? Like he smacks you with a driveshaft?
---
He's an artist he can't afford new cosmetics
---
LOL FORTNITE BAD ROFL
---
Yeah like maybe the entity enduses shit loads of pain after the entity takes like a sort of blood offering after he crushes the blood ball leading to rage
---
he just gets super angy like my dad when im holding the flashlight wrong
---
Meanwhile... hahaha I decisive striked this guy at the exit gate. Serves him right for trying to secure a kill in the end game
---
Reminds me of the Ultra Rare "A Fucking Gun" item
---
Absolute genius
---
https://youtu.be/lItNYsksvUA
---
Pain is part of the process. It's okay if you can't change. Not everyone is strong enough to do so. 
---
I hope all the best to your mental health. Really sad to see someone getting crippled so bad from a thing that is supposed to generate fun.
---
How is he butt hurt? For saying that something doesn't make sense?
---
Yeah because you didnt double pip, points aren't directly related to emblems
---
Yup! Its even worse becaude of that. I can hear him basically all over the map so im not always sure if hes near or far xD I still have yet to escape from him though, cant wait until the day i do!
---
I feel that pain
---
I think it'd be cool if he could pour his bottles into a gen so later once it gets to a certain percentage the heat cooks the stuff making gas come out of the gen to blind them and alert the clown of let's say a maybe half way done gen?
---
Who would get a bill costme
---
Yep
---
Oh really? That‚Äôs your reaction to me saying that I don‚Äôt like survivors getting a ,,get free out of jail card‚Äò‚Äò that lasts way longer than it should be and that can be abused by experienced players to such an extent that they are pretty much invisible!?
---
It‚Äôs really interesting I think he‚Äôs the killer with the least changes since his release
---
Without exact details of what happened in the match (how many hooks, chases, etc.) you can't exactly expect people to tell you why.
---
The emblem system isn't perfect (and probably will never be due to too many scenarios that could happen) and you shouldn't be punished with a de-pip for winning but also shouldn't pip because it wasn't a challenge.
---
Lightbringer is whatever, Silver/Gold I'd assume.
---
Unbroken would be Iridescent if you never got touched.
---
Benevolent would probably be Bronze if the Killer never gave an opportunity for you to heal or unhook someone, sadly nothing you can do if the Killer refuses to create an opportunity to heal or unhook.
---
Evader would probably be Nothing or at the very best Bronze, you can try to be around the Killer or try to force a chase to get points to help improve it to Silver or higher.
---
you are missing the point I am making I am saying the things I have been told is that people on console have problems with his turning radius and I am saying it is the exact same on PC hence why I dont get how much harder he is on console
---
^its ^not ^fuck ^spirit
---
The Spirit, Oni, and Quentin were brought due to anger.
---
Nea, Adam, Jeff, and Benedict Baker or Vigo all went to one of the entity's realms.
---
Jane, Tapp, Amanda, and maybe Feng  were all on the brink of death.
---
Claudette, Kate, Jake, Huntress and maybe Meg decided to do random shit in the woods
---
Clown and Ghostface were already traveling and causing mayham.
---
The gatekeeper emblem is stupid imo. It‚Äôs cuz you got gen rushed which isn‚Äôt really your fault.
---
I'm so glad DBD got me into Evil Dead, fucking awesome franchise
---
If someone is looping me the entire game and isn't toxic I give them hatch, like they deserve this way more than their shitty teammates
---
Idky you got downvoted
---
I think BHVR has enough cosmetics in their store now. I think they need to focus on quality of life changes. Sorry, by no means do I think this is a bad cosmetic or something, but I just think that DBD would benefit from bug fixing and QoL changes rather than just constantly spewing out cool cosmetics. On that note, I also think that every cosmetic they release is usually expensive or very time consuming to acquire.
---
OP, Are you ok?
---
Your on Xbox so there is no post game chat and also they probably just dident know about the perk bbq
---
Hate that I only found out about this game in the past couple weeks. Sad.
---
I agree legion is in a better place now. Just like my grandma and my first dog.
---
I know why I didn‚Äôt get it. I was just highlighting how you need to milk matches to have a chance.
---
‚ÄúPretty much invincible‚Äù fuck no lol, once again you are trash at the game gyro you are a shit rank 20
---
This was before DS was changed
---
its a trap
---
Besides I didn‚Äôt insult you now did I? So why are spilling insults around like a toddler?
---
Oh ok, since you wanna use that analogy I am also going to use it. I mean, how would you feel if people who pass stop lights FREQUENTLY didn‚Äôt get penalized?  Because that‚Äôs how the current system works.
---
Would you rather not penalize anyone for the small chance of something going wrong? Stupid mentality if you ask me.
---
I thought this meme was funny being a console player with the shitty frame rates and lobby times. +1
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt no life this game regardless.
---
Run No Mither.
---
Checkmate.
---
I think it's even scarier when you don't know the intentions of the killer
---
Bruh I get more 4ks than 1,2, or 3, is not hard i didn't even know people post their 4ks lmao
---
You actually have multiple times on other posts, once again I see you everywhere complaining about nonexistent problems you trash rank 20
---
If it‚Äôs not impressive to you that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm not saying it will be to everyone.
---
*quietly
---
Could be - if I did I apologize for the confusion I must have caused!
---
Lol insidious bubba.
---
Alright opinion time, how would a nerf to NOED be where it becomes a totem at the beginning of the match?
---
I personally think it's a bit absurd to be faster and able to 1 shot survivors because all gens got done. However I'm asking if this is a good change because I'm not sure if that would render it useless.
---
I haven't seen the Evil Dead movies yet, but I'm pretty sure Ash could kick Steven Crowder's ass. But that isn't saying too much, to be honest.
---
Very adorable art style!
---
it works
---
Been waiting sbout 10-20 minutes lately for survivor
---
I gave up on it and started trying builds. The Oni and the game in general are more fun when you‚Äôre not tryharding
---
You don't need Spirit to win, aha. Play Hag; she's a strong killer that isn't completely brain-dead to use. Nurse is easy on PC, Spirit's strength is just judged by how good the users headset is.
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
 
---
&gt;# If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019

---
Balanced, this landing is.
---
Gens went too fast, should of of protected better kappa.
---
You can't touch if you can get close. 
---
I will get close if I know I have the chase to do something, tho.
---
Anyway, why are we talking about banging a vengeful and very angry ghost?
---
Edit: not that I wouldn't bang her, tho.
---
Insidious Bubba is best Bubba.
---
In my experience mostly they still don't
---
I like each survivor having their own unique boost though.. this way you don‚Äôt a survivor strictly for their teachables..
---
Yeet that hatchet fellow huntress main
---
Oni is a ghost, he is just different from the The Spirit, just like The Nurse. The Nurse is also a ghost, but like I said, she's just different. And Freddy would appear to Passive Phase to awake Survivors experiencing Micro-Sleep, further signifying to awake Survivors that he's only partially in the Real World, which is something you could argue ghosts are like too.
---
What did he say? The post got deleted.
---
But there is a grace period... It's not a "DC once and you're banned kiddo" kind of arrangement at all. It's after repeat dces that you're punished. Even if it wasn't, then if you have an emergency you need to tend to, that'll take longer than your in game ban anyways. I fail to see your point here.
---
That, and you're thinking about it wrong. Being held hostage and "game breaking bugs" is such a non-issue that it shouldn't have even been brought up as a reason against DC penalties in the first place. In most if not all cases, it literally does not matter. In the very rare chance it does, you have the end game timer or the devs actually fixing the bug in the first place. A much more fitting analogy would be: "let's burn this bridge that 99.9% of the population wants because the .1% are painting graffiti on it".
---
So yes, I will in fact use this to put down his opinion, because it's a dogshit reasoning for a dogshit opinion.
---
Does the time at which gens are completed effect the medal as well as how many are finished?
---
Okay Polnareff
---
It's a meme at this point. Lol
---
Why tho?
---
There is something called xbox messaging system, just click on their names and msg them
---
So why handicap yourself by playing a killer that is clearly not better than spirit, when spirit is top 2 MAYBE top 1?
---
I can tell &gt;_&gt; Look at that 3küò≥
---
Huntress hatchets are 1000% harder to hit than vomit.  Huntress also moves slower than plague.  Plague has AOE vomit. It's not even close as far as comparing corrupt purge to hatchets
---
I got chat banned for a week on Xbox for saying dumb
---
There is something called disabling messages from unknown users

Swf*

At least come up with something creative to call me you sack of poorly packed horse shit!
---
Exactly, having passive gen pressure and/or more map mobility would be so useful for him.
---
it was better on the ptb where that shit actually went for like 15 seconds lol
---
Probably had a challenge to kill people whilst NOED was active or during the EGC. Now that there‚Äôs a set list of challenges to adhere too, I try not to be too pissed off with killers like this. Everyone has the same goal in the end.
---
It‚Äôs almost entirely because of Legion‚Äôs Trailer so BHVR did it to themselves.
---
Yeah there ain‚Äôt much you can do with Oni in the beginning of the game
---
You don't know if they disabled messaging :/
---
I'd believe 4x
---
Ok Mr Schiggy you can go crawl back to your hole
---
When I first started playing him a bunch I wasn't aware of the different pain moans volumes but now that I do I'm very happy with my choice. 
---
Even now though aside from hearing bill [on console so he wasn't around then] from so far away it will actually throw me off sometimes I don't notice much of a difference.
---
Something about how mad grit had nothing to do with it and that he was sarcastically interested in watching people play as potatoes
---
I was legit 0.1 seconds away from closing hatch on the last guy, getting a 4k against a full red team would've been so satisfying as a green (albeit almost purple)
---
My only critique of Yui is the neon pink sign on her back of all her outfits.
---
It doesn't really  matter how many are completed, it matters how fast they are completed. If they get all the gens done in 5 minutes your gatekeeper is shot. However, if they are stuck on three gens for 8-10 minutes that is pretty much a guaranteed iridescent gatekeeper even if they manage to finish all the gens.
---
Unironic tyler1 omegalul
---
I mean ig but do you really think these killers need buffs
---
I mean, it‚Äôs a good idea with all the viruses sent through the messages by bots
---
Yeah I thought it would be cool if there was a xmas themed cosmetic that had the wrappings she wears on her base cosmetic be actual bow wrappings, so I'm hoping we get something like that someday!
---
This is the second killer video of the the day that gives me immense joy.
---
Never heard of it.
---
Scroll a bit farther down man.  We detail why it's a terrible idea below.
---
&gt;big yikes
---
&gt;my dude
---
No, you have to specify an order in which you apply the operations.
---
Was a huge problem a while back
---
Yeah I understand how the emblem system works but thanks. I just never realized how dumb it was until this game. The killer failed to even injure any of us. I did two gens and was never even found by the killer.
---
Lmao well I dont go on here enough to care. Personally a 4k is so damn common (I'm a killer main) its definitely cringe to post a 4k. As a for a survior to post getting away with 4.. unless any of these had like hella context and vids it doesint manner. Now maybe a rank one killer killing all rank 1 survivors, that would be pretty cool. I'd like to watch the video, even the other way around, all for rank 1 survivors getting away from a rank 1 killer. Either way that would be entertaining
---
Lmao, I was waiting for someone to butt in with their whining.
---
Sounds like a damn orgy. 
---
Noice!
---
Feelsbadman. Oh well, you did good. You can hold your head up high knowing that you nearly 4k'd a full red rank team!
---
Why does everything have to revolve completely around balance? Are you not able to have fun unless you're completely steamrolling?
---
bc its been 3 years.
---
Sounds like survivor main propaganda to me
---
Is it really a meme if it 4k's tho?ü§î
---
Sure gloating sucks and maybe nobody cares. But as a frequent player sitting around 12-14 ranks I can understand how someone might just be proud or excited that they actually got a 4k or an escape or whatever. 
---
I don't see anything wrong with sharing something you're proud of. 
---
But I do have a problem with all the try hard red ranks sweating all over some baby killer's excitement.
---
Too bad, get outplayed.
---
How is saying what he has a history of doing whining?
---
A 4k and a brutal at best.
---
Dbd forum? Full of baby killers crying.
---
I main bill and Steve for survivor and Jesus he is so loud lol. I don't use iron will though so I'll use my terrible smokers cough to assert dominance against the killers.
---
Is Jane legally a midget?
---
Ooooh didn't know about nurse
---
It came out years ago and the news that everyone would get it was a month old

Reddit is not the same as the forums. It‚Äôs pretty 50/50 there but here it‚Äôs like 70/20

300 iq trapper.
---
Haha nice job dude
---
Had this happen when the exit gate opened. Was just on the edge of escape, got rubberbanded back and the killer hit me and downed me. I just put the controller down and took a rage dump.
---
If you go into a locker while you have ds the killer can‚Äôt do shit!
---
If you combine that with a full swf group that I‚Äôm sure someone like you have! Then yes you are pretty much invisible while you have ds that like I already said lasts way to long for an ,,antie tunnel perk‚Äò‚Äò!
---
As long as it's not a de-pip I can sleep soundly at nightüò¥
---
You're banned
---
[deleted]
---
I've had 0 many times
---
It upsets me how your power ran out when it did
---
Yeah something should be changed there. Doesn‚Äôt seem right that all you have to do for survivor is escape but as killer you need to do so much more. I say if you get 4 kills that should be the way you get the adept trophies. No more of this double pip garbage.
---
It'd be great imo because it would fit perfectly with how pop works you'll know what gen to slaughter
---
Maybe a 45 second count until the next chance to 1 shot, after using it? I‚Äôm fine with the killer being able to 1 hit down with NOED, but it should be limited. I‚Äôve had my entire lobby go down many a time trying to save someone because fucking of NOED. Wouldn‚Äôt have happened if there were some sort of delay.
---
You think that the same team who desings cosmetics also fixes the game?
---
Is that Heath Ledger as the Joker?
---
Actually thats another Pig nerf. If you equip the perk, you start the trial already stunned for the duration it takes to complete the first gen.

1.wait outside the locker, dumbass

2.no you aren‚Äôt invincible

3. To fucking bad

Her wild card outfit doesn‚Äôt have it as bright neither do her tank top outfits

It your game downloaded on an external storage device? Having as internal storage helped the game preform somewhat more consistently for me.
---
Discordanance, Monitor, STBL, and Thana is my usual build 
---
You don't build STBL stacks nearly as fast anymore but you also don't lose them as quickly.
---
STBL could probably be swapped for Pop.

Trapper is the kinda guy who wants to F\*\*\* and be F\*\*\*ed. What 100% straight man wears a girdle? (Circus strongman cosmetic).
---
Add to the list of issues dead by daylight has caused
---
Successful Feral Frenzy attacks inflict the attacked Survivor with a Deep Wound. Survivors inflicted with a Deep Wound must Mend themselves (An action similar to healing). It takes 12 seconds for a Survivor to fully Mend themselves, or 8 seconds if a Survivor Mends them. Survivors inflicted with a Deep Wound also suffer from a Bleed Out Timer. When a Survivor's Bleed Out Timer depletes, the Survivor is put into the dying Health State. Deep Wound Timers pause while they are Mending or running.
---
Ooooooh. Shots fired
---
Pretty sure they said they're going to give him a rework or something  eventually.
---
Yeah fair nuff. But this person didnt actually loop me the entire game, it was just a total  of 3 mins as they ran from pallet to pallet and dropping immediately  then blind as i break, then when it came to shack they were downed immediately. And if they didnt have a pallet it was just run to the infinite. 
---
So i just downed others in between finding him
---
If theyre gonna rage about it to the extent then i dont feel bad about it
---
He shouldn't  have clicked his flashlight  at the start if he cant actually loop!
---
Don‚Äôt say that, Steve will start screaming
---
More like Yui screams. That shit is unbearable on hook god help us all.
---
Already did
---
And that‚Äôs a win. HUUUUAAAAAA
---
&gt;reddit quote.
---
The lumbering industry was pretty big in the state of Maine during that time period, but i don't believe it's specified whether she's American or British. Smithson is an English surname.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules)
---
Because you didn't do anything towards your emblem scoring. No altruism, no co-op points, no chases, no chase escapes, no saves. Literally nothing. All you did was gens and that's not enough points in the match to get a pip. 
---
Downvote all you want to but that's facts. That's why farming matches with killers is boring as fuck. You don't get any points for it.
---
My new favorite dbd meme lol.
---
But that outfit takes away the amazing hair
---
It's a meme that actually works. I mean, if you know its coming, then it likely won't. So SWF often breaks it, because the hooked surv can just tell the others to stay away. But hey, when you go down that basement to save your friend and see that bright yellow apron in the corner, you know you're f'ed
---
Especially when this has been a well-established meme format.
---
Back to /r/politics with you.
---
wow... i dream of the day i get that much. did you cheat? thats way too much. thought it capped at -1?
---
What is this from lmao
---
If they made a licensed Alien Chapter, the map should be on the Moon, that'd be sick.
---
Oh yeah sure when I‚Äôm playing doctor whit a big terror radius build and I get ds by the survivor that I randomly found that was unhooked 50 seconds ago that I didn‚Äôt eve tried to save because it was on the other side of the map!
---
I sHoUd HaVe JuSt WeNt aFtEr SoMoNe ElSe!
---
Yeah, I feel like that's most likely the case. I believe the devs once mentioned time doesn't work the same in The Entity's world, but it's still possible to count the numbers of days that have passed if you try.
---
Genuine question cos I‚Äôve been mulling it over a lot: would Bubba being able to break standing pallets be too OP? He has no mobility, nothing to help in a chase, no map pressure, and basically no power if the Survivor isn‚Äôt right in front of him in a big empty space. You could go around the map breaking pallets, but then you‚Äôre just giving the Survivors time to rush gens, or get away if you go for the pallet over them. But that might make for a spicy endgame. And it would fit his flavor text that says he robs Survivors of their tools.
---
Thoughts? I think it‚Äôd be okay for him, but I know how important pallets are. I just want my boy to have something...
---
Most likely. Trapper was possibly born before then, so it seems like no one ages in The Entity's world.
---
I got it my 1st try both on PS4 and my alternate account on Xbox. Both rank 9. Trying it on my main account (rank 1), got the exact same iridescent and a gold on the gens. One spot away, if I had stopped one less gen from popping, I would have got it. The way rank reset is now, gonna be a bit more difficult now. Not because red rank survivors are so good, but because they're almost ALWAYS SWF. I'll get it, but it's hard. Especially with a killer I've got an hour or two with and his perks are all tier 1.
---
How? I tried over 20 times as solo survivor, and just can t. I think i will wait rank reset for that shit.
---
Then wait for the ds to run out dipshit
---
Yeah guys.  If you want to be considered good at the game you need to give survivors second chances so you can get extra hits. But don't let them heal or else you get punished for that.  But you need to let them heal if you want enough hits. And don't win too fast or else you didn't pressure the gens enough
---
I agree that situation sucks, but I have reservations about deactivating the perk because of other survivors playing poorly. As someone who plays solo only for archive quests,  your team being bad is really hard to overcome. You‚Äôd at least have to have other conditions surrounding the deactivation, because sometimes you won‚Äôt be saved until another person is going on hook and if your decisive deactivated 10 seconds after you got unhooked it‚Äôs probably not gonna do you much good.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with the way decisive is used sometimes, but I think decisive should be enough time that a survivor is able to get into a better position (away from the killer, healed, into a good loop, etc.)
---
I do think decisive could use some tweaking, although tbh I‚Äôm really not sure what tweaks it‚Äôs could use, but I really think survivors shouldn‚Äôt be penalized by other survivors because sandbagging is awful as is.
---
Sorry, I meant that the trapper was taken in early
---
A jojos meme
---
I guess one man‚Äôs trash is another man‚Äôs treasure
---
You seem to downplay how big of a difference speed changes are to any killer. Competent survivors could outlast your frenzy, especially with how short it lasted. You'd almost be lucky to get more than one survivor in deep wound. Before the update, the add-ons to extend Ferel Frenzy duration were a borderline must. Not being able to injure more than one survivor early in the game was usually a death sentence. These issues were resolved by the "buff".
---
&gt;This means that perks that trigger with a basic attack will no longer trigger under this circumstance.(Nerf) This Nerf is so big for legion that it almost makes him useless. With this while using feral frenzy the following perks don't work: Sloppy Butcher, Save the best for last, Remember Me, and all other Basic attack perks.
---
Ok let's analyze this.
---
Sloppy Butcher pushes to incentive for good survivors to not waste time healing. This allows them to spend more time pushing gens while staying injured. By not putting Sloppy, survivors are more likely to heal which is allows survivors to waste more time as they'll be put back into an injured state soon enough. Even if you disagree, one add-on now acts as Sloppy. STBFL is useless on Legion, I'll leave it at that as that's obvious. Getting stacks for Remember Me should still be easily possible. The only real perks that got nerfed are Franklin's and Dark Devotion and I think Legion can survive without those two perks.
---
I guess so lmao ü§£
---
Huntress is a 110 killer and is also slower with a hatchet readied then plague is with puke readied. If a huntress respects a pallet that you dont drop, she doesnt get a hit. If plague respects the pallet while in purge she gets a hit regardless of if you drop it or not.
---
Or even better when the whole team has ds and I can‚Äôt do shit because everyone was once on the hook and I can‚Äôt even slug because that‚Äôs So ToXiC Gg Ez tRaSh BaBy KiLlEr gO KiLl YoRsElF fUcKiNg RaNk 20

Thanks! 
---
Also, it's possible to copy and paste images. Or, if that doesn't work, save the image you want to upload, then on the textbox tools there should be an "insert image" icon. Click on that icon and insert the image you want. You can do this multiple times, but you need to space between your images.
---
Literally impossible for everyone to have ds active, go cry me a river you are a shit killer
---
Happy cake day
---
Should be noted that this can't just simply be due to the survivors being stupid. You get points for GATEKEEPER by doing things that regress or halt gen progress. You have to actually rack up points smacking gens and having them regress and whatnot. I don't know if the amount of time the match goes for affects the emblem, but if so, then that just also gives points, but you can't just hope the survivors don't do gens, because that isnt really a strat. I think the best way to double pip is probably to get PGTW and/or Overcharge, and THEN have a good game, while smacking gens all the time to keep survivors from doing them or at least giving themselves away when they try to do them
---
I was considering doing this to get the 2 hooks in EGC challenge but decided it was too dickish.
---
If anyone is struggling with it, just run Blood Warden if you can. Kill two survivors as early as you can, then let the last two finish gens. Hook one during EGC and the other one will either try to go for the rescue or be trapped anyway.
---
I‚Äôve though about a killer doing that, and it would fit Bubba. I think it could work, but I‚Äôd give it a decent cooldown so it can‚Äôt be completely abused.
---
Basically there are two ways I see a team can play vs the plague. No one cleanses or everyone cleanses. If the team doesn't work together, then she will wreck the ones who don't cleanse.
---
I second that. I keep hearing the alien entering the vent sounds from Alien: Isolation. Imagine working a gen and all you hear is *BDUPBDUPBDUP* from the vent above you
---
Hex: Hush 
---
disabales your headphones until cleansed
---
Imagine running into it with the killer on your tail and glitching inside it
---
Do you main Steve?
---
(Why start a chat when we have a public comment thread)
---
fuck leatherface and anyone who plays leatherface
---
But we want more head pieces. As of now, Adam only has five unique head pieces, and three of them can be considered the same cosmetic just modified slightly (Default head, Prestige head, and preppy outfit head).
---
no u
---
For a solo survivor I recommend:
---
**Bond**: Will give you a lot of information on your team and will help you find them to heal you and for you to heal them which is an important part of ranking up. It will help you know when to go for unhooks or when to not bother because someone else is already going. You can also often see someone get chased by the killer so you will know roughly where the killer is or if you see them get injured and can't see their aura then you know the killer is really far away.
---
**Spine chill**: To give you information on the killer and will also increase vaulting and repair speeds whilst activated. Can really help you get into a better position or hide from the killer. Is very strong against many killers who can sneak up on you - ghostface, myers, spirit, wraith, freddy and killers with monitor and abuse.
---
**Decisive strike**: Can really save you sometimes. Not used every game but I end up using it probably in 50% of the games I play. The killer will either have to leave you on the ground for 60 seconds which is valuable time for you team to heal you and do gens or they will have to pick you up and decisive strike will then stun them for 5 seconds giving you distance to get to a pallet or much better position.
---
If we are talking purely base characters and no dlc, then I would replace decisive strike with adrenaline, unbreakable or borrowed time.
---
**Any exhaustion perk**: Personally I use dead hard but sprint burst or balanced landing are both very strong too.
---
Dead hard basically lets you dodge one hit and can be used to get to a window or pallet that you wouldn't have made otherwise. Although sometimes it lags and doesn't work.
---
Sprint burst can prevent you from getting injured in the first place and gives you time to outrun the killer when they are very close and make it to a pallet or better position.
---
Balanced landing can turn drops that would otherwise slow you down and get you hit into you getting a huge head start on the killer. It can also be activated off of small drops like stairs.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Those are my personal suggestions atm but you'll find the ones that suit you best. I would highly recommend leveling david first for his perk "we're gonna live forever" as this will give you bonus bloodpoints meaning you can level everyone else faster. He also has dead hard. Otherwise I would probably level Dwight first for Bond and you could run prove thyself along side it for faster gens and maxing out the objective blood point category.
---
I levelled Claudette first for self care but I now think it isn't worth it as it's common to see killers with perks that slow down healing or some killers who render it useless. Better to use bond to find team mates and get them to heal you or use a med kit.
---
I just really like his trench coat. It‚Äôs so nice, and the default color of it is the best looking one compared to the recolors you can get in the store
---
No. I just appreciate his moans lmao
---
A killer has to win 12 chases without tunneling or camping to win. If your ruin is gone early you could play to the best of your ability with zero mistakes and all gens will still get powered with 0 kills.
---
NOED is there as protective method for Survivors who gen rushed without clearing totems. It‚Äôs no different than Survivor perks that help you for ‚Äúplaying badly‚Äù, such as adrenaline, dead hard and decisive strike. By your logic survivors are getting extra help for playing badly and getting injured or hooked.
---
Moral of the story is. It‚Äôs not a huge buff for playing bad. It‚Äôs a last line of defense for survivors playing well. Which can also be easily cleansed but w/e.
---
I think you underestimate the power of DC'ing.
---
Yeah, i'm sorry I went into a tangent on this shit, but i'm not kidding when I say my therapist actually encourages me to keep playing. All because playing killer kinda keeps me calm and shit. He deduced that after watching me play around the launch of Clown. And yeah, my problem solving skills do need a touch up, i'll admit that.
---
Very strange boner...

Nah.  A fleshdwight.  üòé

That's even better. DC always means that survivor admits he cannot defeat me and admits my superiority
---
The cosmetic team is a completely different team from the bug fixing team.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
either toxic assholes or genuine good people who got a good laugh out of it
---
Most accurate thing I‚Äôve seen today
---
Oh shit you rightüò≥
---
You mean, you explained an opinion of yours and would rather not explain it again? 
---
Just because someone gets a tiny speed boost over the others, doesn‚Äôt mean it will be played exclusively. By bad survivors? probably, but by good survivors? Nope. It‚Äôd bring more variety and it‚Äôd be more fun tbh to have many different survivors having a fun passive, just like all the killers. 
---
I don‚Äôt like how they‚Äôre just skins, because since that‚Äôs the case, most people play friccin P3 Claudette because there‚Äôs no reason not to! That‚Äôs right there counters your reasoning for not giving survivors a unique passive, since there are almost at least 2 claudettes every round. Give everyone a reason to be different survivors.
---
"all you have to do for survivor is escape"
---
Uhhh.. if thats your logic, then "all the killer has to do is kill all the survivors." Neither scenario gives the winner a full iridescent emblem game. As survivor you need to spend lots of time being chased or doing things with the killer nearby, or cleanse like, 100% of the totems, you need to make sure you do a lot of gens and open a gate and make sure you spend a lot of time healing other people or unhooking them. You actually have a lot more to worry about if you want a flawless game, with all iri emblems and 32k BP. And other survivors can steal potential limited progress towards your iri emblem. Not to mention I'm pretty sure one of the survivor emblems literally CANT be iri if you were hooked at all, meaning you have to also never be hooked. 
---
That's not to suggest the killer doesn't have just as hard of a time balancing his responsibilities, but I'd argue he has way less things to worry about. He just has to juggle more.
---
That makes pharmacy even less appealing, thanks for letting me know though!
---
__woosh__
---
The hatch really be racist like that.
---
It is possible for all to have ds active a lot can happen in a minute tat least get some arguments you little salty survivor
---
Wow you're right on the cringe. At least he finally hit one.
---
Your welcome!  Be aware that while all the other medkits increase the speed at which you heal others, Emergency Medkits are the only ones that drastically cut down self healing time.
---
I've done that before but I think having bond would be a better complement than the detection perks. When you see survivor auras you have an idea of what they and possibly the killer are doing.
---
I can't get a 4k the last survivor either escapes or I accidentally press b on the hatch.
---
I didn't downvote you.. 
---
yes because I didn't have to. The killer put 0 pressure on us. I understand the emblem system but my point is it's dumb. You shouldn't get punished for obliterating the killer by de-pipping, that's ridiculous.
---
r/woosh
---
So it it now plague then oni then trapper?
---
I got scolded for wearing Trapper's black apron (with the bloody skull) and Rogi. They said I was "camo'd out", but I have never in my life had an issue seeing any killer except maybe the hag with her default outfit.
---
How do people not see the fast moving/large people?
---
I've seen this bug, it's pretty weird
---
Oh no ;-;
---
I really hate Swype texting sometimes lol.
---
Good meme
---
That's odd. I have the occasional issue but most of the time it's fine. Google " down detector dbd" and you can keep an eye on issues with the game and see if others are having problems
---
To unlock the cosmetics on the rift. You get them from playing, and from completing challenges.
---
I hate new gatekeeper. As a doctor main I've had matches where they complete the first 3 to 4 gens fast, only to get ground to a halt via a 3-gen strat. 45 minute match, bronze gatekeeper.
---
This actually made me lol üòÇ
---
I literally can‚Äôt even get into a lobby
---
Wym? Iron Grasp, Agitation, Mad Grit Bubba is the strongest thing possible in this game!
---
I would buff his add ons, I mean his best one is a brown one lol.
---
I believe this is the first of many. DBD will just have a battle pass from now on. I have no idea if there will be down-times between, I assume so
---
Yeah, I hope they fix this since it‚Äôs also the same for killers. Sometimes you just go up against some really silly survivors and kill them all in less than a minute with 0gens done. You don‚Äôt get many points for chasing, and gen monitoring and thus de-pip despite the fact that you completely won that round. 
---
And then as you said, the flip side is true for survivors. You gen rush the game, no one gets hooked by the killer or even chased, and we escape = de-pip. 
---
Not sure if this is a matchmaking problem or an emblem problem because this can happen when everyone is the same rank.
---
Confetti pallet
---
But none of those killers need passive phasing in the first place especially a nerfed version of it, hell spirit doesn‚Äôt need it but it does comes into play in specific situations. 
---
They could use the disturbing of electronics on a new killer they make that‚Äôd be interesting.
---
Thanks, and yeah it should be u/pro-oni-main (I‚Äôm new to Reddit so that‚Äôs why)
---
whats so special about this? If you save all the way to 1.000.000, you will end up with 0 every single time.
---
fair enough
---
I agree those perks are great but I can‚Äôt use them for adept. In my game I was able to gain pressure when the survivors were throwing themselves at one of the final gens. In that case I didn‚Äôt have to milk it, but getting 9+ hooks without the survivors dying too early requires a bit a milkin‚Äô
---
Hey jane had advantage due to gate openning on her side first not fair! &gt;:(
---
Pretty sure every human being has, whether he admits it or not. Lmao. But yeah, I slightly misread and though you just wanted all iri emblems. I also said that, yeah, the Killer ones are vastly unfair especially if your killer doesnt have good perks
---
Actually it‚Äôs not longer tied to terror radius. As long as they are sprinting or mending the timer doesn‚Äôt go down anymore, regardless of terror radius
---
Imagine comparing TF2, a class based shooter, to DBD
---
Can you restore licenses?
---
You tried and succeed, nice work
---
those hobbit gremlins are horrifying
---
Hmm, should I disqualify her for a false start?
---
I agree it needs to fixed, not sure how though lol
---
He claims to have invented the ‚ÄúSloppy Butcher + Nurses Calling + Thana‚Äù build even though it‚Äôs been used for years and claims he made a breakthrough by using it on Wraith and Ghostface, even though that‚Äôs been one of Wraiths most popular builds since The Last Breath and had been carried over to Ghostface after he got buffed. He‚Äôs even been called out on it by other streamers that it‚Äôs already a popular Wraith build but he‚Äôd rather just stroke his own ego.
---
Hey I would take Bond on a killer. Sounds pretty fuckin OP to me lmao
---
Agreed, the killer having bad perks is vastly different from a survivor having bad perks. Because you always have a chance with survivor if your careful. Killers are a serious task to get that adept trophy.
---
If you were in deep wounds it heals you one health state so thatd be back to injured
---
You‚Äôre an idiot though if you think that you can play a clown, ghost face, leatherface, wraith, etc at red ranks *consistently*. Also, just because you state your OPINION, doesn‚Äôt make it canon, so you can think I‚Äôm an idiot and I can think you‚Äôre an idiot, however it makes neither of us right in the matter of hypotheticals. So I can bring YOU to the location of the brook, but I can‚Äôt force you to drink from it, moron.
---
I mean... it would be funny. Killer can mori for near instant game. 
---
Survivor turns around, boom, fades to ‚Äúescaped‚Äù.
---
Thank you, I now understand why I couldn't mori Feng Min at the end of my Adept Spirit match.
---
They need to rework all of his add-ons too
---
peepoSpeed
---
Guess what, Survivor DC because of how bullshit the game can be sometimes (YES IM TALKING ABOUT YOU HITBOXES), and guess what? Its gonna keep happening penalties or not until you fix your fucking shit bhvr.
---
People on ps4 message the n word and threats after killing them so no
---
JEFF MAINS RISE 
---
Edit: My username says otherwise, but I used to be a Kate main. But when Jeff came out I just had to main him.
---
Had it on full volume at 3AM.
---
Played it again at the start to subtly let them know there's other sounds too.
---
I am uncomfortable holy shit lmao
---
Just a run of the mill injured state. That‚Äôs garbage if that‚Äôs the case. I‚Äôm red wine angry.
---
i just got lucky with a bad killer i guess, had a new oni get his second down once all gens were done, waited for a gate to be open then gg ez
---
Absolutely zero need to lower yourself to personal insults dude.  If the topic hadn't reached it's natural conclusion before it would definitely be over now.  I don't engage with people that can't engage in civil discussion.  Once you go full Tom Petty with it it's over.  Have a good night.
---
&gt; if she's stunned, she loses corrupt purge immediately.
---
I did not know this.
---
All they‚Äôd need to do is improve his chainsaw a bit (at the very least, don‚Äôt punish Leatherface by making his movement stop to a crawl when activating the chainsaw), and then boom he‚Äôd actually be a good killer.
---
Sucks tbh I dont have this issue maybe u should contact customer support or reinstall
---
Someone took time out of their day to make this... 
---
and it was time well spent. Bravo.
---
Today was the first time I played in weeks. 
---
My team let Myers get to tier three very quickly. Of course the one he‚Äôs chasing runs to the gen I‚Äôm on. He starts to go after me and downs me vaulting a window. He hooked and facecamped me. 
---
It was a nice welcome back.
---
For the bonus BP for both them and you.
---
People do it to either bm the killer (crouch spam, drop items) or to get extra points by healing and such
---
Why does T-Bagging at gate give in terms of BP
---
There'll be a second pass with new missions in the Archives and new lore that'll replace what is there currently.
---
Yass üò´
---
Yes, perhaps she should take comfort in the fact that know she knows for sure he plans on murdering her. Soothing.
---
But why do they do it every single game? If it's fair and no one really abused the game why do it instead of just leaving?
---
People want to be dicks
---
actually it's plague, oni, huntress, then trapper I believe. The wiki mentions The Doctor is from the 80s I believe.
---
The ones I run into don‚Äôt do gens ;-;
---
Lol that ghost edit though.  You just couldn't help yourself....sad man.  Blocked.  I don't do insult exchanges with petty trolls man.  Have a good life.
---
Definitely, it‚Äôs a fair trade for a survivor escape. They escape its adept so the fair trade off for killers is 4 kills. I suck as killer so I know how hard it is even with the perks you want let alone the base perks for that specific killer.
---
Interesting situation. I never considered this since I'm on PC
---
You know I completely forgot about Spirit, yeah I guess she does
---
Perks I‚Äôm using: Brutal Strength, Pop Goes The Weasel, Enduring, and Agitation
---
Well...is the killers fault for entering a match with 4 flashlights without franklin's
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
Omg don't cross the streams.
---
Yeah the insult IMO is flashlight spam. Crouching a bunch I interpret (and mean to be) just my little survivor guy trying to talk to you but alas he is mute and cannot form words, so instead he spasms his body up and down in attempt to make peace.

Yeah happens to me too :/ But usually when I get that pop-up I'm able to join into a game after I queue again.
---
Seriously lol? Demo is definitely one of the better killers
---
&gt;That it happened 3 times in one day you fucking shitfuck. You have to be totally brain dead to think that‚Äôs true
---
&gt;Good god. Does your mom tie your shoes?
---
Oooooh. We were talking about two different things. I thought you were referring to my post.
---
Also the possibility of that happening 3 times to someone in one day isn't impossible. But unlikely though.
---
True ig
---
I still play legion even if I know that I'm putting myself at a huge disadvantage at this point. They've just always stuck with me since they came out, not sure why. But I think legion is one that I'll continue to stick with regardless.
---
If the teammate getting carried to hook is death hook and you haven‚Äôt even be hooked yet then it‚Äôs 100% worth to go down so they escape and keep the game a 4v1. 
---
These guys...idk I guess they assumed ‚Äújust one more hit‚Äù and didn‚Äôt think about Mad Grit until it was too late
---
Ight
---
Bodyblocking isnt toxic, ever. Unless you‚Äôre holding the game hostage as killer. It‚Äôs only to save teammates
---
This will be an ongoing thing. There will be more archives/rifts in the future after this one with new lore and cosmetics
---
we jus need,       MONEY!
---
Moron
---
I dont fucking play steve, play with steves, or watch youtubers that play steves, yet i heard that fucking scream
---
I mentioned this is another thread the issue, that thing that wether intentional or unintentional this game is addicting.
---
"That is one thing i have noticed about this game, from grinding trials, from playing killers that are not S tiers, from getting literal rocks as teammates.
---
This game, this experience, its not about having fun, its about chasing fun, you keep playing, keep grinding, keep hoping, because MAYBE maybe this match you MIGHT have fun. Fun is not a constant, its something you hope for, its the thing that grabs you and pulls you into just another match, that idea, that chance that maybe this time you might actually enjoy your time on the video game, and the problem is it works, when you having fun you love it and its great and like a drug addict they got you hooked, you will sit through all this crap, you will slog away at the worst matches ever, all just for that payout, that chance that daddy BE will give you that fix of fun this time, and no matter how bad it gets, they will drag you back, because hey those last four games were bad, but maybe this one will be good, sure your trapper, you have no addons and your fighting 4 bloody claudettes with Flashlights and Toolboxes all with connected names, but there is that CHANCE, you might have fun.
---
In a way its almost impressive, how well this completely flawed game works at making you chase the carrot through all their BS, all their problems, all the worst play experiences, just because the carrot tastes really good"
---
I‚Äôm just trying to understand why you wouldn‚Äôt assume mad grit is a possibility on the killer who owns it
---
I will never understand why people facecamp, i am a killer main for the most part and just standing there and not chasing is boring
---
Most of the time they teabag till I show up, then immediately leave
---
They teabag until I get there then immediately leave the first second they see me
---
Exactly my man. You get it.

Can we add legion complaint posts to this? 
---
Like 1 in 3 posts on here is people complaining about how they nerfed legion. 
---
We get it, he's shit. He's always been shit.
---
Oh then they're just being assholes to you lol. Yeah just ignore them and move on. They're just BMing you.
---
He looks like he's given up
---
In all fairness 3 minutes is quite a long time but he shouldn‚Äôt be wasting pallets by instantly dropping them.
---
It was there first. Mind your own business
---
I too keep getting this
---
This happened twice while trying to do my unhook in end game collapse challenge. They'd pretend they are letting me do it then noed me in the end game collapse. üíî
---
What now
---
But what if I can tack on a story about my cat dying and his last wish was for me to get a 4k, and I title it "this one is for you, Schnapps"?
---
It happens man. As a legion main I can attest that to that and that might happen quite a few times no matter how much legion gets nerfed. Some people just hate legion because of how ridiculous his ability was upon release. People dc a lot for no reason in this game though lol so it could have nothing to do with legion in this case.
---
You're a straight up Fuck wit
---
Ikr. The vault speed helps! I'm using STBFL better as well because I can save stacks by using frenzy on my obsession. I'm not seeking to injure a bunch a people unless they're very close. I stick to one target and down them more efficiently instead. 
---
Maybe it was my build, or my luck, but I kept getting 3 to 4 kills against purple ranked survivors. I went from rank 10 to rank 8 this afternoon with Legion. 
---
The edge lord kids are still alright.
---
I've had teammates that made me want to post a is this my teammate meme with the hook replacing the butterfly.
---
Yo is this 2018???
---
360's are so much fun to pull off
---
It's a death trap now.
---
Pac-Man
---
Haha thank you
---
You also have the broken affect and can‚Äôt heal. You‚Äôll infect things that you touch as well like windows, lockers, and gens. It is absolutely okay to cleanse as long as it makes plague go out of her way to get it and it‚Äôs not near the gates in the end game.
---
I've never had an issue seeing a killer by I have spine chill so I don't NEED to see the killer when that fucker pops off I'm heading out I don't wait around to get eyes on the killer. Although I do say I like the new map when the killer heads up to the top of the platform they are easy to spot and if I see them head my direction I peel off before SC even.
---
Oh nice. I main the new girl Yui. Idk hoe to put a flair on in mobile üòî
---
Should a killer *really* have to sacrifice an entire useful perk slot to counteract a co-op system that shouldn‚Äôt even be in the game in the first place?
---
Any killer can
---
People dc'ing because of a hit they don't agree with or petty shit like that is exactly why they're going to be implementing this lol
---
Prerework freddy was good, stop this nonsense. He was extremely hard to pull off, you needed to know all timings perfectly and know exactly what to do to succeed. But escaping a good Freddy was extremely hard
---
It's stupid to cleanse early. 1 gen left or none is when you should cleanse
---
I miss my easy stacks of STBFL tho ;_;
---
You didn't even reply to him
---
Lucky for you, I‚Äôm also on mobile, you click on your name like on one of your comments and at the bottom of the Popup it should say add flair
---
I agree but i get very annoyed with the screen practically being blocked by the green vomit
---
*cries in surge, STBFL and sloppy*
---
Its gonna keep happening, that or suiciding on hook
---
I can tell that you've never played against old Legion
---
The blurry Legion in this picture is a mood.
---
This would be benefficial since sometimes I play as Survivor and forgot that my challenge is "Hook a Survivor".
---
Or if you would let me hook a survivor as a Survivor that would be nice as well.
---
Ik, regular swings seem longer to me, no power involved. They seem to me more consistent when attacking from the other side of windows etc.
---
I just think that takes away some of spirit‚Äôs uniqueness and draw for no good reason. Phasing is part of her whole aesthetic unlike the other killers so it makes why she‚Äôs the only one that has it. 
---
 The other killers already have their ‚Äúthing‚Äù, freddy is already a horror icon, nurse goes through walls/floors and is high skill, and oni is a massive demon that collects blood and has demonic flames when he uses his power. I don‚Äôt see why they should also have part of spirit‚Äôs ‚Äúthing‚Äù for something that really isn‚Äôt going to make a difference for these killers
---
No Mans Land
---
How?  I never played them so I don't know what is and isn't a buff.
---
Oni is gonna be the pioneer all the jojo an anime refrences here huh?
---
#*REAL MEN OF GENIUS*
---
i mean, yea oc, but that can be said about any annoying thing in this game
---
Just started playing him more with PWYF. Most fun I've ever had with him in a long time.
---
Corrupt Purge being able to down is the biggest difference. I don't care much about Vile Purge.
---
That is true, but the fact that if you look at many DBD posts in Reddit, Twitter, Steam, Official forums. A good majority of them are posts that are asking for a certain licensed killer or about a survivor/killer getting a certain cosmetic. I think it would mean more if we stop seeing less of those types of posts and more posts of people asking or proposing some quality of life changes. Like I said before, I don't mind getting these cool cosmetics that people are proposing to the dev team, but I much rather play a balanced and fluid game than to play a buggy ass game with my cool cosmetic. I mean hell, would you want to shell out $10 for an outfit that you can barely play with because the game is so buggy/unoptimized that it just takes the fun out of the game and causing you to play less?
---
I‚Äôve been playing for about 3 years now. There‚Äôs still good guys out there! But I do agree, majority of players are wank like that.
---
I never said that.
---
SAO is a good anime if you dont pay attention and you are really fucking tired while watching it
---
Give Ace a Nick outfit.
---
Make Oni Coach when he finds out the helicopter isn't made out of chocolate
---
Yes but doing all that doesn't take enough time for the collapse to happen. Generally I'll do that then mess on my phone
---
*it works at Green rank
---
Edited for accuracy.
---
PWYF is super fun on him, pairing it with Nemesis is even better because as long as you get stunned and blinded enough (which you will because you‚Äôre LF), you are almost guaranteed to always have at least one stack.
---
Nah legit didn't know.
---
My game hasn‚Äôt ran this well on MONTHS
---
Raw steak then..
---
On PC, correct?
---
I'm not. Shit is random yo,  why would I dodge my own swf?
---
made me laugh
---
Not when it‚Äôs almost dead center...
---
But like, was that fun to play as? You were just a M1 killer that had to wait 7 seconds to hit somebody
---
I know that
---
I'm one of those things, and not tired, cause I usually have it shoved in my schedule right after lunch.
---
I love Adam. He's my third P3 survivor with every perk (except the new ones) but it does suck how limited he is. I change my outfits on Jake and Dwight like every round but I can't really do that on Adam. :( Well, not noticeably anyway.
---
They changed his mechanics so a few perks aren't useful for him anymore, and his mend times are slightly shorter. But he also received huge speeds buffs which override the nerfs.
---
cool
---
I didn't even know who Otz was until seeing threads hit the top page praising him like he's the only DBD streamer alongside Noob3.  
---
Tru3 though has been around since the beginning so he _used_ to be brought up quite a bit around here alongside others that for some reason are no longer brought up/mentioned much despite their contributions and bringing in good viewer numbers.
---
New perk:Fuck off
---
When you chase a survivor for 1 second/0.5 seconds/0.0001 seconds,you pull out a gun and shoot them in the fucking head.All survivors have a heart attack and die you get I billion bloodpoints.
---
**‚ÄùIs that a motherfucking Jojo reference!?!?!‚Äù -The Entity**
---
Woooooow. I think a big meal works just fine lol.
---
That's for sure, no bugs in my house!
---
Made me cry
---
Oh man, you're a real one! I just absolutely hated his play style so much I just couldn't do it. I dropped him as soon as I unlocked his perks (He has fantastic perks, so at least they did him right in that sense). Such a shame because his tandrum sounds are so spot on and his little jog too ... 
---
If they ever get Pretty Lady Leatherface cosmetics, hell, I might give him another go.
---
I think he's saying "I'm adorable and it's dinner time"
---
RIGHT THROUGH THE PALLET
---
Because Hazbin Hotel is in no way related to Dead By Daylight, yet we get the same cringey content posted every single day.
---
We get it, you‚Äôre a full grown adult excited over a Cartoon. This shit is the new MLP/Brony fandom all over again.
---
Why do they do that?! So rude.
---
P3 blendettes in bushes=invis
---
Neither is spongebob or any meme for that matter
---
I know, that's why I asked. Also, why would adding a cosmetic be a problem? They can't do both?
---
Nah it used to be just kill based and you'd just have players cheese lt with ebony moris and trash camps.  What an achievement....
---
I like the idea of the double pip requirement but they need to still address how the emblems work because it does seem overly oppressive at times and this post looks to be a prime example of that.
---
Also in regards to the argument that survivors have it too easy I agree.  Simply surviving isn't much of an achievement.  Personally i think they should have to double pip as well along with their escape for the sake of fairness.
---
Yeah I have to because of the film on my glasses. It's good for outside but not inside.
---
Haha, it‚Äôs haunted grounds and you thought it was ruin! This joke has never been made before!
---
Surge?
---
So does the cat unfortunately. He loves to grab my mouse and attempt to run away with it....
---
Yeah it really would be cool if that happened
---
Wait until a demo does it. You'll lose your hearing.
---
I do it to 4 man swf's instead of ebony moris. Who needs eardrums?
---
My friend once got a warning for calling someone else a noob. Ps4
---
He changes everything if I don't lock my computer before walking away the little asshole.
---
One thing to be weary of: I noticed while playing killer that survivors are super easy to see from up there also. Makes perfect since why the devs said they wont do a flying killer after testing it.
---
It's pretty broken. It's like from that angel you can even see through the reeds and bushes. So it goes both ways.
---
The boss has spoken
---
So, ps4 has way more people playing survivors than killers...  and I love playing killers but because matchups are so survivor heavy, my purple rank is always matched to 2-4 red ranks. and man anything other than a 4 man escape I get whiny messages like this 
---
I have no desire to get to red so I play all characters I like and I 0k pretty often, clown, hag, doctor, Freddy...and 1 in 2 games that I win, someone needs to whine
---
Camp- I would pop a gen across the map and come back, that‚Äôs camping
---
Tunneling- I chase another and my nurses see your healing in middle of the map so I hit u, tunneling
---
Heck I just play for fun and I am not even that good, I hit walls more times than I can count
---
And now apparently using green Addons is considered boosted. In this match I see the Bps so I fooled around and 2 hook everyone, hit walls so often and still I get this kinda messages. Maybe don‚Äôt run around the map if you are up against the hag, even if u loop very well?
---
Sometimes if you wonder why no one play killer and the survivor lobby has such a long queue, this
---
I have a little bed on my desk for them, they just love being seen.
---
How is Hag D Tier?
---
She‚Äôs the only Killer I‚Äôve ever reached Rank 1 with
---
What‚Äôs with the basement?
---
#*Look how they massacred my boy...*
---
Thanks, it's my cats favorite place to walk :)
---
That‚Äôll be much better as it‚Äôll all be balanced and designed around that.
---
Dead by Daylight is about chasing.
---
Winston ‚ô°
---
true
---
A m1 killer whose power basically stopped genrush and gave you a lot of info + really confused survivors with some add-ons. Wraith or trapper would kill for such power
---
Same. I‚Äôll even say gg to insidious leatherfaces.
---
Solo survivor here I dont care if the gens take more if that means more people playing killer and queue times shorter
---
What an asshole, cats are lucky we love them
---
At least you did good as the Big Texan
---
don‚Äôt ever compare the glorious Ash to Steven Crowder ü§Æ
---
Just bc he loves it doesn't mean it's good for him
---
Yeah the ones with homes are ‚ô°
---
/s ?
---
Shouldnt be a issue since you can't do both at the same time, here's your upvote.
---
Become? Try always was the fucking prick
---
Old, but gold.
---
Depends, if they have noed then yup but if you could save them then you should go do that.
---
Disagree. You are always at a disadvantage no matter what if you use No Mither. Disabling the blood orbs is nothing. 
---
Its like saying No Mither counters Michael Myers because he doesn't need to go into EW3, it's a counter to Iridescent Head hatchets, it's a counter to Billy/Leatherface chainsaw, ghostface's stalk, ect. 
---
Sure you don't get the full affect of these abilities, but you are effectively always exposed. Never a fair trade
---
No pwyf :(((
---
I play Hag as my main and I was having a great game against a SWF team. I hooked someone right off the bat in basement. I trapped the hook and the steps leading to the basement. I was trapping generators nearby, and then all 3 of the survivors come rushing in setting off *Every trap I set*, and I knocked two of them and the other got away. 3 survivors were hooked, and I use *every trap I can,* knowing it'll be an easy game. 4 gens were done at this point (They all gen rushed), and I camped the last two gens, which were both within 40 meters of killer shack (Where in this map the basement was), and I bided my time until he comes running in, setting off every trap on the steps. I waited until he set off one of the hook traps, then teleported him and *yoinked* him off before he could get the save, and then hooked him, winning the game. After the game, I got a message from their whole SWF group, calling me racial slurs, telling me to kill myself, and telling me how bad I was at the game. Did I deserve the hate, considering they made bad plays?
---
Aslong as he doesn't chew any power cables he's fine.
---
Ghostface. Better than Myers, and is not OP but iz very good
---
Ok bet
---
All it takes to understand why are these two word sentences:

I would like to assume that they can, but the problem I see here is that not many people are making posts about the problems of DBD. We all know the devs roam around social media while working. So why not populate the DBD social media with posts on possible solutions or flood the forums with posts/clips of broken/unoptimized stuff instead of flooding the forums/social media with posts about possible killers or possible cosmetics?
---
I mean there is a reason they keep pumping out so much cosmetic and chapter based content. Its because people keep asking for more and they are more than willing to pay up front about it. I mean seriously think about it. When the devs start fixing stuff in the game it gets like less than 10 posts a day (rough estimate ik) and then they don't even get paid to fix the stuff in the game because that just comes naturally. But when they start teasing or releasing new cosmetic/chapter content, you have so many leaked posts or posts related to it or people asking for more to the point that content creators jump on it as well and on top of all that the devs get paid money for it. So really, there is more incentive for them to focus on chapters and cosmetic content than fixing stuff in the game.
---
You're fucking scaring me, OP. Stop it.
---
Agreed.
---
Very philosophical.
---
As an alltime solo survivor, its getting really frustrating to always "lose" because ya teammates are trying to flash their shiny flashlight into the killers eyes.
---
There are already some solo survivor perks (i.e Laurie), but an reliable perk that actually changes something would really benefit survivors who don't have the friends to dick around with.
---
Existing on the same map as survivors is considered tunneling
---
Adding coach would be a godsend. I would main him.
---
I think BHVR did a pretty good job so far
---
No, but for this situation you don't need to sacrifice shit, this survivor setup is hot garbage in terms of practicality.
---
Hello SirEseer,
---
I have also been receiving the same errors! I‚Äôve been playing the game for over a year and never experienced this issue until this recent update! Plus three of my friends are also receiving the same errors. I also submitted a ticket but so far they have been no help. Did you submit a ticket in the help link on the DBD website? If so did they have you try to do a hard reboot on your modem and Xbox?
---
Maybe try formatting instead of having a block of unreadable text.
---
Vision impairment is a thing, break your posts up into readable sections.
---
What perk
---
We haven‚Äôt seen their perks though. For all we know, their perks could be entirely build around a toxic ‚Äúmeme build.‚Äù Which is no fun for anybody but them.
---
Thatd be his club. Maybe just a pipe for his katana
---
Its a bandaid idea, it doesn't change the complaints people have about both and would only pacify those that need bloodpoints. Some people don't need them as much and wouldn't get anything changed.
---
Where'd you get a screenshot of my last match
---
That statue is a troll.
---
I had game where feng been bitching and telling me iam noob after game. Played billy i chainsawed her before exit gate and sacrifaced her
---
Like Frank Reynolds, Michael knew it would allow his ass to breathe
---
He's basically a Killer main with strong opinions and obviously an ego.  He's been around a very long while and is one of the streamers that got a cosmetic in the game.  He's the type who tends to blindly defend Killers even when other big name Killer mains agree that something's broken, i.e. Spirit's ability having no counterplay because you have 0 indication when she uses it if you're in a chase with her.
---
Damn I guess we wouldn't get a bill outfit, no survivor would fit his looks
---
Adept needs you to get a double pip as killer now, so even with a DC it would be possible.
---
Since OP barely had chasepoints, I assume the game wasn't going on for too long, so unlikely that he got the achievement.
---
This is the same for me and 3 of my friends in Arizona. We all tried doing there work around DS and it still doesn‚Äôt work.
---
You're spare parts there aren't ya bud?
---
If you cant read it then get assistance or find another method to read my posts instead of being lazy and expect people to do it for you.
---
Honestly I'm tired of memes in general. I'd rather see discussion of builds, perks, and tactics.
---
Honestly, at this point, I'll take any Adam cosmetic we can get #justiceforadam
---
I was also getting the same exact thing. Now I can only start Killer games but nothing for survivor. Very frustrating.
---
Op: makes 7 minute long cover in a genre that not everyone will like.
---
Also OP: Why does nobody upvote my content?????
---
Yeah :(
---
The queue have been long for the last three months only for surv I can have match like killer in two seconds the only explination is there is a lot of people playing surv and nobody playing killer and this dont have in one day the queue times are bigger with every month
---
it's part of the end game collapse update
---
What he gained: slightly faster movement speed, slightly fast vaulting speed
---
What he lost: ability to apply sloppy butcher, ability to get save the best for last stacks, survivors mend fast, deep wounds timers are no longer tied to chase and only go down when the survivor is not running. 
---
Id say adding a small amount of speed to movement and vaulting at the cost of all the negatives was a nerf. The speed increases help him with his frenzy hits but that was never an issue with him in the first place. Faster mend times and not being able to apply sloppy lessens his slow down. The new deep wounds being tied to running buffs all endurance effects such as bt and purple instas while also taking away urgency as survivors can run full map away to a safe area to mend and not have to worry about losing any time on their timer. Not being able to get stbfl sucks because he can no longer get any benefit from hitting a survivor multiple times while in frenzy which was nice if there wasnt a second survivor in frenzy range.
---
This is a shitpost, but like someone said just make a moonbase. Doesn‚Äôt have to actually be outside. I mean It could be like another Hawkins but maybe a little more open.
---
The joke is that TydeTyme once made a video where he ranked Leatherface as B tier while ranking Hag at D tier. He showed footage of himself playing Hag and he placed about 2 traps in the entire 7 minute long clip.
---
He also ranked Clown as A tier because of Clown's "ability to deny loops" and then proceeded to rank Hag at D tier.
---
Space Coconut (a really prominent Hag player) made a video about it at the time: https://youtu.be/VJLFHVpLxkk
---
I struggle to see so it helps me know where things are. May not be any good to people with good eyesight but I feel it helps me.
---
Just checked the wiki. He does need to be crouched, as well as in night shroud, in order to get rid of his red stain.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about bro it‚Äôs fine :) if it‚Äôs really that helpful then use it. As long as you have fun and not ruining the experience for others it‚Äôs ok
---
Of course hiding is the best option but sometimes you can't avoid getting chased.
---
Thanks
---
True, he was running bbq, murmur, devour soap, NOED
---
I mean, looking at that, I don't understand why they went into the basement to heal.
---
One of the doors was already open, Tru3 was opening another one, they all would have gotten out if it wasn't for that dumb play.
---
Surprised it actually worked out like that.
---
Pinky finger is only meant to activate on a direct impact
---
Holy shit he looks scary to go against &gt;_&gt;
---
You‚Äôre a saint. I don‚Äôt gg facecampers, my ego wont allow it
---
I did. That just seems like something the devs would fix immediately so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I got on right now and got hooked in the basement on any map I get that it would happen or not
---
Real Hand.
---
It's a 4v1.  If only one player is having fun at the expense of the other four then that's shit game design and the other four are going to eventually stop playing.
---
His claim is that he faced a 4 man 15/16 times. That is a tiny portion of the community being faced in 15 of 16 matches.
---
what good is the game to anyone? but we still love it and play it. 6yrs old is not too young, and even if the game is bloody it is not doing any wrong from a boy playing a video game.
---
The screams are the only seriously "graphic" part of this game aside from moris. Everything else is just blood-spatter without any actual visible wounds. I really doubt a 6 year old is gonna be a good enough killer to see a mori, but yeah that part could be too much.
---
No he meant 4 man as in he killed a 4 people 15 times but in the 16th one he faced a meta SWF group and complained as if killers were weak.
---
yes, more love for my boy Jeff
---
Assert dominance? Absolute garbage play!
---
Lets meet in the middle, all SAO games sucked hard lol.
---
Nah I've never had the willpower or desire to play that much DBD in the span of one month.  Though the rank reset changes are going to make it way easier to get down to red.
---
Thanatnafobia
---
(Look, I know I spelt it wrong, but you get what I'm trying to say right?)
---
Your already playing Pig that's charity enough.
---
I'm always so confused when people post there 4k's I get 4k's alomst every match and I'm a low rank killer
---
ok
---
Lmao
---
Especially happens if you get 360ed  while in corn and even corn maps in general are terrible frames
---
I think Ace got scared maybe the door wouldn‚Äôt be open in time? So he went down there to run from the killer but the other person tried to finish healing him?
---
wait for tapp to be in it
---
They just should keep working on dead by daylight and then make a sequel that's better
---
I mean Laurie would be in her sixties so we know time doesn't work the same.
---
Hey!
---
Who has two thumbs that fail every skillcheck try, when you were waddlin' yay high?
---
This guy! 
---
Who will spam 'X' for those stingy survival points, though?
---
You're looking at him yo!!
---
Doctor is getting a power change as well, not just an addon change. The leaked descriptions included references to a new power.
---
Speaking of Hush, I lost interest after he took off the mask to reveal that he was the guy from The Belko Experiment
---
Make him a killer
---
Perks 
---
Paranoid  
---
Watching a survivor from a distance causes them to feel uneasy. Giving them Oblivious for 10/15/20 
---
Seconds. 
---
Deadly ambition:
---
Once stunned by either a flashlight or pallet the next time you hit a survivor they get the exhausted status effect for 15/20/25
---
won't tell, didn't see face: 
---
Once a survivor see's you and a chase is started,they become your obsession and  you gain the ability to see their aura for 10/15/20. Survivor gains haste for 5 seconds 
---
Your main weapon is a hunting knife 
---
Power 
---
Your power consists of a crossbow. Only can be used once exposing your face to survivor after a certain amount of time. You get bolts from walls around the map only can hold five bolts at a time
---
&gt; Insidious Wraith,
---
Is actually not that bad if you pair it with Dark Devotion, the brown add-on that gives you Terror Radius in Cloak, and some sneaky plays.
---
Hitting the Obsession causes him to think you're following him invisible for a while, and Insidious lets you chase someone off only to "leave" by standing still.
---
It's a great build to play to unwind, though it probably gives Survivors a heart attack
---
I used to watch Tru3 videos a looooong time ago. Now I hate him lol. He used to have fun with the game, now he's way too competitive. If he gets downed is because the game is wrong lol
---
"The disconnect penalty test will take place sometime after the update is released on PC platforms and Switch‚Ñ¢.", from their Twitter. It's not online yet.
---
I kicked a gen earlier today and got clipped into a wall.
---
Ash: not again
---
Btw S tier is nurse spirit freddy ghostface billy according to the meta. Otherwise amazing tier list
---
Unhooking right in front of the killer is the equivalent to a Hashinshin TP (that is, dying from a gank and then immediately teleporting back to lane on a minion just to get ganked again)
---
This uncultured fool
---
It makes bitter pill sweeter. I honestly would feel much better against keys, which I hate, if I was given an extra reward for playing against it. Currently, my only reward is moring that survivor who yields a key or taking Franklin hag.
---
this is my ass when i was new in brown ranks like oh theres a lit totem it must be devour hope it breaks (exsposed) me shit
---
That's why I love Gibsandpieces and Hybridpanda  (when ever he comes back to streaming) They both know they aren't perfect and are not afraid to have some fun with thier builds or take a troll game from a donation.
---
Oh that makes way more sense. Don‚Äôt worry. In time you will get better at finding gens and better overall and  s h o u l d  eventually not need deja vu or will replace it with a better perk. Have fun :)
---
But how? If you could find a game then it means that noth everyone plays swf and that would mean that I was wrong but I'm never wrong and survivors are bad because they all play swf.
---
I had a wraith who "cloaked" but was completely visible tho whole time. It was wonky
---
No0b3
---
Clearly we just need a survivor perk that let's you hook a survivor.
---
Let me put muh dick in yo eye
---
True
---
Ah, so that's why I still see survivors yeet out of the game once something minor and inconvenient happens to them.
---
made with mematic
---
I played Freddy and you could easily get bullied when you played as him, I understand where your coming from but overall I don‚Äôt think he was a good killer.
---
From a year ago? Legion used to be exploitable. But they changed that. Now he‚Äôs ass. And he was never OP he was just easy to abuse and break.
---
But what if you don‚Äôt wanna be a scumbag, and you actually want to save your team (by the way, ppl on red ranks don‚Äôt give a shit about totems) 
---
Even if it‚Äôs a loss for the killer with 1k, being realistic, any respectable survivor will go back for their teammate, and the killer knows that, having NOED increases the chances of getting a 4K or at least a 3k tremendously and you know it
---
That's exactly what happens. üî™
---
It would be cool to injure or down survivors this way, would be more realistic
---
That‚Äôs pretty HOT great work keep up the good work
---
Kill them all
---
Haha thanks :)
---
Feels weird when Tapp has more unique purple outfits than Adam does.
---
Holy fuck you just made my day Ahahaha
---
Haha I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of duos/trios that I end up with but I don‚Äôt have anyone I know that plays the game, so I just do my best solo. It works about as well as it you‚Äôd expect. 
---
I definitely take notice of groups popping in when i play killer, but that just means if some solo pops in I‚Äôm semi-nice to them, cause I know that pain.
---
Yeah it gets me a lil mad bc the surfs think their pros or smtnüòÇ
---
That ‚Äúguy above‚Äù is the legendary Change my mind World champion known as Steven Crowder‚Äù
---
This happens way to often, when the killer offering does not turn
---
I just can‚Äôt play him for long periods, I get like two meta SWF teams in a row and have to go play a killer like Freddy to cool myself haha. He is definitely amazing in terms of visual design and sound, he looks and feels like Leatherface from the films. Just wish his gameplay matched it. 
---
I too am really hoping for a Pretty Lady cosmetic, Devs recently said they could do some ‚Äúfun stuff‚Äù in terms of LF skins so I‚Äôm hoping that comes with his supposed add on rework.
---
6 is too young ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
When you hit a Jane
---
Only part I'm looking forward to. Doesn't have Kirito, from what I know.
---
The extra bloodpoints would be nice, but it still doesn‚Äôt change to how they can not make matches very fun, especially Mori. 
---
Killers need to win just one chase against a survivor and be able to eliminate them instantly after they are unhooked.
---
With keys, unless the killer closes the hatch and starts EGC, survivors have to complete a number of gens based on how many are alive to use them.
---
Its fine, find the hatch.
---
Nice! Don‚Äôt worry about the haters, you know your kid they don‚Äôt. Both my daughters started playing mortal kombat at around the same age and can now school most of my friends. They are 7 and 9 btw
---
The Chili seems to affect cornering. (Which would sorta make sense! They are, after all, replacements of Hillbilly's steering addons)
---
Try mashing WASD randomly when chainsawing from a standstill. Without the chili you change directions sluggishly, but it's MUCH more responsive with the chili.
---
Chili just seems to affect your cornering. Like you can catch up to survivors in a loop slightly better. It doesn't seem to adjust straight-line performance though.
---
Bruh
---
I think you took what he said a little bit too literal friend, relax.
---
I use
---
BBQ, Thrilling Tremors, Pop, Nurses/Haunted Grounds/Devour Hope (last perk is interchangeable)
---
Add-on wise: if you use the two yellow tape addons they give you a far as fuck short beam and a cone that's 8 meters a think in front of you also without giving you a stupid charge time. You can snipe people far as fuck with that thing, it helped me earlier prevent someone feom escaping because they couldn't open the exit due to my shocking even though the gate was 99'd.
---
"Do.. I... look... like one of them?!"
---
Oh alright, thanks!
---
It sounds like they might be getting more serious about making new games again after Artifact served as a huge wake up call and more platforms are trying to compete with Steam.
---
Basically
---
Thank God you posted this in December or I would have failed NNN
---
Yes but you are not likely to pip because of using one
---
Maybe just lower the drop rate, or make it so you have to get a sacrifice first? Seems harsh to totally remove it
---
Thats y i grind BP with BBQ and never play that new killer till i get my 4 perks tier 3
---
So are brand new parts
---
I'm convinced BHVR doesn't even know what to do with Edgy Gang at all. Everyone here and on the forums are on a scale from "delet legIon!1!1!" to "I propose many changes to the power, etc....."
---
In short, community isn't helping much either... I had a small glimmer of hope when they changed his pins to be much more useful than before, and upping his FF and vaulting speeds *just a little bit*.
---
Edit: Quick thing to add, his trailer suggested a killer that could "disguise" or at the least blend in with other survivors and get the jump on them, and we got teen with a knife that can run fast. They released a killer made of *4 separate individuals*, then locked 2 behind a paywall and couldn't even get 2 more voice actors to fill the roles of the 2 behind the wall of "open your wallets".
---
Only part im looking forward to is when i skip SAO and just wait for stone ocean
---
What does mad grit do?
---
Only if keys are removed too.
---
I tested in game and it does the same thing as the old Scrapped Tape, they just updated the description (assumingly) unintentionally.
---
What‚Äôs up with the True hate? Yeah he‚Äôs not always right but some of you guys are toxic on purpose just to get these kinds of reactions from him.
---
Running Haunted Grounds on trapper bc who tf would do that
---
Ok guys everybody hide now, shits gonna get real.
---
The art style of the faces reminds me a bit of the Papa's Pizzeria games. Nice work.
---
Can you explainhow he was uncounterable but a bad killer? I really haven‚Äôt been playing long. All I see are people who DC when against Legion.
---
That is their final form
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e7owp6/glitch_spot_on_coldwind_farm/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Accidental leak.
---
Hey at least you looked good being sacrificed
---
Do people still care about pips, its so easy to pip no matter what
---
Sloppy you would often combo with thana so if everyone wanted to just not heal they would receive a 16% slowdown to gens. Also many people would run monitor and abuse on legion so when youre just m1ing around while everyones injured youd be able to get closer with your smaller tr and then youre basically an infinite t3 myres. Stbfl was good on legion because it gave you value from landing multiple hits in rapid succession as well as gave you value from hitting the same person twice while in frenzy if no one else was close by. The faster recovery speed doesnt just help in chase, if youre in frenzy it lets you get to the next person faster or if everyones injured and youre just m1ing around it lets you recover quicker and potentially pursue a new target if say there were 2 people at 1 gen you can slug the first and then quickly snap to the other. Or if people are bombing the hook and you have a bunch of stack you could down the rescuer and snap right on to the saved person. Its just overall a good utility perk. All this different utility was sacrificed for an extra .12 m/s and .3 sec faster vaulting. I mean if you think thats worth it then god bless you, but like its super not.
---
Literally everyone has seen this video. Fuggin clauds
---
How do you know it wasn't a killer game?
---
Can someone explain what shadow born does?
---
It says it increases your pov but how though does it make it so I can see more stuff on the screen?
---
Thanataphobia. Good players don't typically heal against Legion so thanataphobia would force them a 16% decrease in gen speed provided you injure all four survivors. You can add Nurses Calling, Sloppy Butcher and Ruin for ultimate slowdown. Either they waste time healing or they get slowed down on gens so a win win for you.
---
I'm a Survivor main by the way so I'm speaking from experience against Legions at red ranks. Good luck.
---
What about just hear me out what about when you as a survivor are in a map with the spirit or Oni the endgame animation instead of the entity the survivor take a katana out and stabs into their torso I don‚Äôt know because I feel like it maybe fit into the Japanese lore I mean the spirit has here own closing hatch animation I don‚Äôt know what your opinion
---
Let's remove the hatch, Bloodlust, End Game Collapse, Keys, Devour Hope, DS and Noed while we're at it.
---
&gt;Only if keys are removed too.
---
I love this mindset...
---
"*Devs can't change this because / before that so they should do nothing*".
---
Moris need to go, Keys need to go. I don't mind which one goes first or if both go at the same time.
---
There are MANY and I mean MAAAAAAAANY perks that work on Doctor. Too many for me to think of a build so I'll just list some good perks here:
---
**BBQ + Chili** (Good on any killer)
---
**Ruin** (Good on any killer)
---
**Pop Goes the Weasel** (Good on any killer)
---
**Unnerving Presence** (Makes skillcheck zone smaller, works well with the skillchecks on a random part of the screen for survivors feature)
---
**Overcharge** (Gives survivors a really hard skillcheck on a random part of the screen when they repair a damaged generator)
---
**Hex: Huntress Lullaby** (Skillchecks on random part of the screen + skillcheck noise indicator delayed = very hard skillchecks to hit)
---
**Distressing** (Works great combined with Unnerving Presence, Calm addons, and other skillcheck perks by increasing your terror radius and gaining you map pressure)
---
**Save the Best For Last** (Good on any M1 killer)
---
**Discordance** (So that you don't waste time going to every single generator trying to find a survivor, plus you can get multiple survivors into madness this way unless you don't use treatment mode at the start of the game)
---
**Thanatophobia + Dying Light + Coulrophobia** (Slower heals + bigger terror radius + snapping out of madness 3 = some pretty solid game slowage)
---
**Iron Maiden** (For if your in treatment mode and survivors don't scream instantly. Plus when they exit a locker they'll give away their location and be exposed for 60 seconds)
---
**Bamboozle** (Since Doc is an M1 killer, it'd be nice to have something to help with loops)
---
**Dark Devotion** (Some survivors may expect a big terror radius Doc, but all you need to do is hit your obsession and for 30 seconds, they'll realize they jumped to conclusion too soon :D)
---
**I'm All Ears** (So you don't have to predict where a survivor will go or what their next move will be when they vault a window)
---
**Enduring + Spirit Fury** (Good on any M1 killer)
---
**Infectious Fright** (Certain addons + this perk (or just running this perk by itself) = some pretty nice pressure on survivors)
---
**Overwhelming Presence** (Bigger terror radius + Doc's ability to deny item usage quite easily + this perk = screw all items)
---
**Play With Your Food** (Even though he has an ability that's meant to counter looping, Doc still gets looped quite easily, this could help shorten it though by making you faster)
---
**Corrupt Intervention** (To block off generators and give you less area to patrol and an easier time finding survivors)
---
**Lightborn** (Again, Doc denies item usage very easily, flashlights are one of those items. If you use this perk, all flashlights will be rendered useless and all flashlight users will look like complete jokes)
---
**Thrilling Tremors** (So that you know which generator to go to after you hook a survivor)
---
**Blood Echo** (To deny all exhaustion perks easily after you hook a survivor)
---
**Franklin's Demise** (To deny item usage even more)
---
**Knock Out + Hex: The Third Seal** (To cause more pressure by slugging, works good with Infectious Fright, a bigger terror radius, and maybe even slow-heal perks)
---
**Devour Hope** (Doc doesn't have an insta-down, this could help him with that though)
---
**Nurse's Calling** (Nice little aura perk so you can catch survivors when they're healing)
---
**Brutal Strength** (So Doc can break through pallets faster and possibly not get looped for as long. A bit outclassed by other anti-loop perks but is still pretty solid and works good with fake pallet addons)
---
**Remember Me + Blood Warden + Rancor** (End game builds work well with Doc, or in this case THE endgame build. Find and hit your obsession, mori them once the exits are powered so no one can open the exit gates at normal speed, hook a survivor and block the exits with Blood Warden)
---
**Nemesis** (Pretty okay for making your obsession not know where you are for 60 seconds, even with a big terror radius)
---
**Make Your Choice** (For if your one of those players who doesn't go into treatment mode at the start of the game and instead waits until a survivor gets unhooked so that you can use treatment mode to find the exposed survivor and insta-down them)
---
**Fire Up** (Not the best perk in the world, but Doc still does have a hard time winning chases, this can be decent on him especially if combined with Bamboozle)
---
**Surveillance** (So you know when to be annoying and go back to a generator that you just kicked and find and chase the survivor who touched it \[or just kick it again and walk away after like 6 seconds of chasing like a true annoying thing\])
---
**Haunted Ground** (Again, Doc doesn't have an insta-down, this can help with that as well)
---
**Surge** (So any gen in your terror radius blows up and regresses when you down a survivor, works great with bigger terror radius)
---
**Agitation** (So you don't waste as much time carrying a survivor to a hook, plus it increases your terror radius while your carrying a survivor)
---
Oh you right my bad! Then OP could‚Äôve been dressed to impress the survivors?
---
&gt;Let's remove the hatch, Bloodlust, End Game Collapse, Keys, Devour Hope, DS and Noed while we're at it.
---
lul
---
I mean I usually give props at end game. But my hatch giving is random and fickle
---
I think I am too stupid to understand this meme because none of the things listed are toxic.
---
I mean in this case he‚Äôs 100% correct though.
---
Console framerates during a chase will just drop for seconds at a time. Nothing more tilting than chasing a survivor into an open field and then having no scratch marks or any sign of them a few seconds later.
---
I would say is awesome but I‚Äôm too lazy to leave a comment
---
It‚Äôs a meme bro
---
Anyone remember when they did this with Kate? Before ber scream was changed.
---
I think it refers to dark devotion
---
I mean it didn't really stopped genrush because you had to put everyone to sleep and waking up was easy but yea it could have some good interactions with add ons. But idk i never found Freddy to be really fun to play as, but if you had fun with him that's ok I'm not judging. It's just that devs said in one of their streams that part of the reason for the rework was because some players didnt find fun in Freddy's kit, but if you had it then sorry your main got reworked :/
---
No, let‚Äôs not.
---
&gt; NOED really only works at green ranks or lower because survivors gen rushed without a care for anything else and they got hit with it. 
---
That's incorrect though, this shit happens all the time at red ranks aswell. Also I think you overrate Inner Strength, sure some people run it, but it's not a meta perk, at the mid-high ranks people usually just run Iron Will and sit on gens.
---
A bad meme bro
---
What took 20 minutes? I'm out of the loop.
---
Well camping is toxic towards the person getting camped and the one camping because neither of them are getting much out of the game.
---
Not cleansing is only good if you‚Äôre the one on your team dedicated to running the killer.
---
Thanks!
---
when yui gets hooked she hits that crisp G7 whistle note like mariah carey who?
---
I could here before even playing it
---
It's just an awful system.
---
Plague can't apply enough pressure ACCORDING to the game... Healing from fountains goes against Plagues emblems for some reason.
---
The game is fun when avoiding this stuff, as killer at least... Rank 17s been queued up with Rank 6s...
---
The entity probably didn't like that
---
What was he supposed to do, completely heal the OP in the few seconds from scratch while the killer was right above them? That leaves you with two dead survivors, not one.
---
Gimme the SUCC. I can finally stop being mad and think I'm wasting time when I keep getting looped by survivors. Then when I get my form I can catch them easily.
---
I wish BhVR would really crack down on the obsessive camping that goes on within there game, on PS4 it‚Äôs almost every game or every other game now and it doesn‚Äôt matter what rank they are! Then when rank reset is a few days away it‚Äôs really bad. 
---
I know they have stated they don‚Äôt mind a little camping but it‚Äôs all the time and for no reason. Had allot of campers tonight, it‚Äôs frickin mind boggling and I‚Äôm like why don‚Äôt you go patrol a gen or make
---
Good use of your bbq since the other 3 teammates are on the other side of the map working on gens. 
---
When it comes to tunneling, I normally see why that person was tunneled to begin with and if your gonna be a toxic pos to the killer and think your gonna bully them well you get what you fucking deserve. 
---
You can only poke the bear so much before he pokes back.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt understand how it isn‚Äôt toxic. If you get downed and then camped the entire game, you end the game with next to no BP. Toxic is a term that gets thrown around. 360‚Äôing the killer? Not toxic, just skill. Looping the killer? Not toxic, just skill. Mind gaming the survivor? Not toxic, just skill.
---
&gt;But things like camping, IMO is toxic AF. But hey, that‚Äôs just my opinion, you see it differently so all good friend.
---
I could explain the pros and cons of camping but since you made it clear this is your opinion, to each their own.
---
Camping is just a strategy, not even a good one.
---
I am level 700  and I never saw survivor queue so long  the last year like solo survivor you found matchs in less than a minute and killer was two minutes now you can stay for 15 minutes in a lobby like solo and two seconds like killer
---
And I know that is happening for the Rush you have to use ruin  every match and still is insane the speed of the gens I know that because i reed people whit the same issues with the game
---
*TERRY BOGARD SPECIAL MOVE*
---
I unfortunately got disconnected right after the game, so we didn't get to talk in end game chat. Has this happened before? New bug? Idk, but it was amazing. AmA.
---
I mean, I agree with you but you'd think after trying so many times to fix a certain power to no avail they'd eventually move in another direction like they did with Freddy. (although that did take quite awhile for that to happen) They definitely didn't advertise it correctly and I know that pissed a lot of people off but for some reason I always found the killer fun. Despite the fact I'm basically putting myself at a disadvantage by not playing one of the other ones, I just always enjoyed it. I'd hope they would eventually take the gang in a different direction some day.

What a waste of time on a post
---
Like you want a pat on the back or something?
---
Who cares when this is posted, the title and the image explain the meaning anyway. Regardless of whether it‚Äôs rank reset or not. Don‚Äôt see any negativity about it either; just a funny but unfortunate circumstance.
---
it increases the range of your vision like the angle of your field of view, if that at all explains it
---
Yo is there a link to him complaining? I wanna watch it.
---
Leatherface with this perk sounds scary.
---
There is a glitch where survivors get stuck in lockers and killer can‚Äôt kill them.
---
Old bug that keeps coming back. Like running through the exit and not be able to leave.
---
A Hush chapter would be pretty cool. The girl (her name is blanking on me) could be a survivor, and have a new perk in which your sound is completely (or greatly) muted but it gives you advantages in other areas, maybe aura reading or something.
---
I too would love to see the edgelords up there with the big boys. And I have hope for this,  because of the spectacular job with bringing freddy from the bottom of the barrel to standing proudly with the top dogs.
---
No he hasnt
---
Sounds like an interesting update though
---
I reached rank 1 with him. I feel like most of my games I didn't win because I played good as Demogorgon, but because I played good as killer. His shred has its uses but you are still an m1 killer in a lot of situations.
---
His portals are too weak, you have to place them, you have to be on top of one to tp, they are basically a 1 time use because of how easy they are to spot and destroy, you can't re-use portals unless they are destroyed. The vision they give is straight up useless, the sound they emit has a 8 meters range, while the detection range is 4 meters. So if you see someone with your portal, they are 100% destroying it, and because of how fast they are to destroy, + you have to be on top of another portal to tp, + you are probably busy doing something else, all of that combine make it extremely situational to get any value from the vision, from rank 5 to 1 with demo I think I got a hit 1 or 2 times thanks to the vision and the oblivious effect. 
---
The biggest problem is the addons. Travel speed is great, the one that make it longer to destroy portals and the brown addons are ok, all the others are garbage. Give him something to improve his shred
---
Imo he is mid tier, he falls in the category of "Yeah cool killer, but why would I play this instead of Freddy/Billy/Huntress/Oni ?" Other killers do what he does better than him
---
Yes, any attack by ghostface or myers will apply Sloppy, regardless of whether they are exposed or not. A general rule of thumb is if you damage them by pressing m1 (Oni's charge, ghostface's smack, etc) it will apply sloppy, whereas if you damage them with m2 (i.e. Billy's chainsaw) it won't count as a "basic attack". There are some random exceptions to this, like Legions Frenzy or Pig's dash attack won't apply Mangled unless you have the addon, but for the most part this rule remains true.
---
Not talking about it? you dont  reed the one thousand posts about the gen Rush?
---
The devs just hate Legion and there is no reason why. It‚Äôs sad really, I had almost 750 hours on them but I just can‚Äôt play them anymore at this point. It breaks my heart, but I can‚Äôt keep going through them breaking Legion over and over again. It‚Äôs getting heart breaking for me üòî
---
Michael is like the fuck you doing here?
---
I dont think Adrenaline is broken. It requires you to work to get the health state it's not free at all. Decisive strike gives you invuln for 60 seconds
---
Yeah, Deep wounds and mending is exclusive to Legion and when the killer hits a person that has borrowed time activated. Mending is not healing. So if a survivor mends they'll still need to be healed.
---
Why not
---
Rank 1 doesn‚Äôt automatically equal good survs i know, but staying in rank 1 without depiping once for 3 weeks while only using legion is proof imo that this is viable. I know noone has any idea what I‚Äôm talking about but I‚Äôm telling you, you can consistently get to a position where they either go left and get fucked or go right and get fucked, this shit works more than enough to secure a 3k almost every game at rank 1
---
If you‚Äôre still looking for more, I‚Äôm available. Even made a post earlier looking for a group tonight or a static.
---
Same with David who I've been using as my main until I get my recently P3'd Ace fully perked out...
---
Which is gonna take awhile at my pace as I kind of regularly hit burnout on this game's grind.
---
Amazing
---
I agree. I use my frenzy to injure people as much as I can so I'm okay with the nerfs.
---
Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all!
---
Nothing at all!
---
NOTHING AT ALL!
---
Sloppy isn't that great on Legion anymore because his Feral Frenzy doesn't proc M1 effects as of the most recent patch. That being said, this frees up a perk slot to run a different slowdown effect like a DL or even  Bloodhound as your detection perk, and one of the buttons now applies a Mangled effect if you hit someone who's already been struck by Feral Frenzy and still has the Deep Wounds timer. This allows for you to Deep Wound everyone, and say "fuck you" to one survivor in particular, and still have that extra slot
---
Lol no, not at all. Wraith body blocks shit, legion gives you a choice to go right and get downed, or go left and get downed
---
Definitely. It would be an amazing Frank outfit.
---
Pantless Myers tombstone'd everyone in my team today. I don't know how I survived. I think it's because I kept running off to unhook them that by the time I unhook someone he already nailed someone else.

The new add ons are the best thing about the new Legion. They should consider adding an exhausted add on for Legion. Imagine being broken and exhausted? OP!

I‚Äôm down! I don‚Äôt have a mic though which is the only downside

Lmao I don't have a Shirtless dead hard gang &gt;_&gt; I should make one now thoughü§î

Kate's basically getting the same skin treatment Nea and Feng were getting for awhile.  Guessing Yui will start getting quite a bit of attention since she's bound to be popular.

Yet you're so bold with your statement calling him dumb, when you don't "frequently" watch his videos.
---
iight cheers bro. Enjoy your 2% faster movement speed 2.5% faster vault speed at the cost of like 8 perk synergies. Honestly if you think thats a buff then theres no changing your mind, its a buff.
---
Dude, that should be the description of the cosmetic.
---
Correction: They gave *everyone* all the exclusive cosmetics. We didn't necessarily already have these on PC either, but I have them all now.
---
Based on how you responded to other people's sarcastic comments, it seems like you just want to make all of the games longer. This can be done without removing any of the things. Funny enough, all of the things you have said that should be removed/you agreed should be removed are in a heavily nerfed state from their release i.e. BNP, Moris, Keys, etc. Why remove what is sometimes the only tools you have against a toxic opponent?
---
I had a guy try and juke me, mess it up and before I even hit him, he DCed. Swear to God he just alt + F4ed almost instantly
---
What the fuck is wrong with you

Clown‚Äôs a boomer lmao

Remember Kate's scream in the PTB? Stuff of nightmares.
---
Nah no need to feel bad for a noed myers player
---
Clickteam Fusion.
---
I kinda want to play Ghost Face because I enjoy the stealthier killers, but I'm not a great killer and the "hard" difficulty put me off. Is it worth trying?
---
And this is why the game is in the state that it's in
---
Pretty recently actually not sure which patch but think it was when she got cosmetics
---
You have time to cleanse it in the Endgame. The killer isn‚Äôt going to risk his one hook by going to look for survivors trying to find his NOED. 
---
Also I play Red rank Killer consistently and Survivors cleanse 3-4 totems on average per game I see them doing it with BBQ. 
---
NOED really doesn‚Äôt need adjustments when it really only helps a small amount of killers secure an extra kill or 2. And before I get the Killer main replies I play survivor in Red ranks too. In the last month or so I‚Äôve seen NOED proc twice and in one of them we left 1 guy to die and in the other we found the totem and we all made it out.
---
Lol "top tier killer"
---
I love Tru3 sometimes.
---
Wallahi I will.
---
Stalking with Ghostface is hard but no one stalks with Ghostface because stalking is trash.
---
People just press a button to remove there terror radius to become a better wraith.
---
Dud. You're trying to say everyone likes synthwave by telling us about a video with half a million views. Lmao. Fuck off man
---
Ds?
---
British gangs right now*
---
yup
---
Yes it does
---
Balanced as all things should be.
---
Why not? If only a minoritary part of the player base use that mode and cause so many balance issues delete swf will be good for the game al least you lie and a big part of the player base is playing swf and the devs have to balance the game around that
---
A video with half a million views that is literally almost the exact same thing.
---
Ok you‚Äôre right. 
---
This will still get downvoted due to mob mentality
---
Just happened for me in a doc game, came looking to see if anyone else has had it happen and came across this one as well as others... Fun stuff. 
---
https://youtu.be/00RSTLgk9Kc - proofs
---
Clearly somethings different. Maybe it's the quality. Maybe your entitled pissbaby attitude seeped into the musoc
---
Agreed. I don't enjoy playing a serious match when there's an early DC because it feels a bit cheap to crack down on three Survivors who haven't had a chance to do anything yet. I've noticed when there's been a DC that the remaining Survivors put in less effort. If I'm to play a serious match I want them to be actively doing stuff, not just giving up. It's a good chance to take the opportunity to farm and secure some daily rituals and challenges get done. One of the reasons I'd never tunnel (unless someone was being toxic and I wanted them out the match) is because it results in fast deaths and snowballs, which means a shorter match and less going on.
---
Let‚Äôs be real here DH isn‚Äôt used just to avoid one swing. It‚Äôs used to go from one loop to another. Adrenaline is debatable I don‚Äôt care much for that perk, it doesn‚Äôt bother me. The killer can patrol gens but that doesn‚Äôt guarantee you won‚Äôt get gen rushed. That‚Äôs not on the killer. That‚Äôs the nature of the game. Especially against a coordinated team.
---
iridecent head, a huntress add on that insta downs with hatchets
---
short for iridescent
---
Casual playlists please
---
Well the people is tired of wait for this being fixed and they are stoping of play killer
---
I never said there was anything wrong with the perks in their current state, i said there is something DEFINATELY FUCKING WRONG when all 4 survivors in the game have 2 perks that give them free escapes. literally think about what your saying.
---
Just put survivors into GodMode for 60 seconds and they cannot take damage/be downed. Thats literally the fuction of decisive... and if you hook someone during the endgame and a gate is within 100m and they have DS? you might as well watch them walkout because its a guaranteed escape...
---
Like i said. it should be limited to only 1 DS on 1 survivor per game... meaning the other 3 people are disallowed from taking the perk into the match and must pick another. likewise with dead hard.
---
Nobody, Literally Nobody:
---
Survivor: oh I just ran into a dead end in a hallway because i have zero map knowledge and im dog shit at losing a killer and i cant even pallet loop properly. OH WAIT LOOK HERE, PRESS E.... AND I GET AWAY? WoW!
---
DBD Devs: pRetTy Gud jOb sO fAR.. Literally a Case of Balancing for Rank 20. Im on the brink of uninstalling from the autism im seeing in this thread holy fuck.
---
It's not that hard, it was possible even before the devs made it an intentional feature.
---
I probably get 4 killed  75% of my games under rank 6 if I'm not queuing with all my friends lol. The amount of people that just crouch around the entire match and do *nothing* is insane.
---
Ohhhh. Why would someone shorten the word iridescent
---
Ah yes, give up whole pressure to afk
---
Spirit is top tier not ghost face lol he is just above average
---
sure.
---
Yep in the movies he would have to stay up for  long time so he wouldn't get attacked
---
Yeah I get it. Something is downvoted so more people downvote. I just see it as a disagreement more than anything.
---
You can do it, just gotta start it before he goes behind the wall and track him perfectly.
---
dont ask me idfk
---
Nah blaming the vision impaired for being lazy and also blaming you for being hypocritical. You say it takes no effort to format a large post to be legible, then you should take your own advice and reformat my post so that its legible FOR YOU. Get over yourself.
---
Tbh, whatever you say dude, it‚Äôs getting late I should go to sleep, bye, we can keep having this argument tomorrow
---
Its not about the tunneling. killers dont tunnel at rank 1 because they need map pressure. 
---
the idea of giving a survivor 60 seconds where basically the killer cant touch them in anyway is so fucking bad. you might as well give the survivor godmode where they cannot be downed/hooked. think about it. I can down 2-3 other survivors in 50 seconds and then find you again without even tunneling and still get DS'd. if the gens are done and the gate is open anything under 150ft, you might as well just watch them leave. its a guaranteed free escape. not to mention almost everyone runs dead hard with DS.
---
Make the timer 15 seconds. so it only counters being farmed off hook. anything after that is fucked.
---
Unless they did the same for me earlier I let them die
---
Oh that's why it happens? Thanks for letting me know. :) i was so confused haha.
---
Tell us another gram gram. Tell us the one about the Junibodgerhogger
---
they don't like perks that actually make you target the obssesion.
---
Survive with friends!
---
That's even worse than getting rid of 'em
---
Okay thanks. I wasn‚Äôt sure if SFW was something different than SWF.
---
I have chased many a claudette into the talk grass, swung with them directly infront of me, and they just dematerialized. Never to be seen again until they reappear teabagging in the exit gate.
---
As a Laurie Strode main, killers have no problem spotting me.
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten a killer match here myself so can‚Äôt say, but it definitely seems dark, even as a survivor.
---
No one likes tydetyme lmao
---
its also way too dark indeed unless they wear bright colored clothes its almost impossible to see them and even if you do is way easy to lose them if they just crouch anywhere.
---
The game is bad because you're not appreciated. Boohoo
---
I think they just had a typo! Hopefully otherwise I have misled you.
---
1. Jump into a locker for 4 seconds.
---
2. Distortion.
---
3. Literally standing still so the killer doesnt know which direction you're planning to run to.
---
4. Running in one direction then turning around after BBQ has ended after 4 seconds.
---
5. Sitting behind a generator so your aura is hidden by the gen's aura.
---
6. Running towards the direction of the hook so you're within range.
---
7. Literally just being behind the killer out of their LoS.
---
There's 7 counters right there, 6 of which require no perks and 5 of which require zero luck on a survivor's part.
---
Urban evasion ftw
---
It's intentional. It's not a noise made by a survivor, but it's just there to get your attention and alert newer players of the exit gates being summoned.
---
Maybe just a limited time mode?
---
They were all added in for free along with the Oni patch. The devs decided to be generous to everybody. :)
---
I guess the bright orbs and the loud noise didnt do it for em?
---
Unpopular opinion, I Don't find tru3 to be that bad. He gets on with some really stupid stuff, but I don't mind watching him from time to time, or turning on his stream in the background or something.
---

I‚Äôm my old age it seems my memory has failed me an I can‚Äôt recall what a junibodgerhogger is

Meg is the most toxic survivor.
---
Bubbas are the most toxic killers in my experience.
---
Game is bad because game is bad
---
Lol love it, I run mad grit, it's a wasted perk spot but when you get the chance to use it. üòÇü§£ Assholes deserve it.
---
I feel like it's the other way around
---
Iron will and unbreakable are under rated and decisive strike and adrenaline are overrated. Iron will makes tracking way harder for killer cause you need to rely on scratches blood and footsteps not noise, and unbreakable can swing matches hard. Decisive strike was good but now killers just assume you have it so they avoid you or slug you off hook 99% of the time. Adrenaline is great, but sometimes its useless, like if you are healed and not in a chase, or you die before 5th gen. Borrowed time is also in the same boat as decisive strike, but it's easier to force BT to be useful than decisive.
---
This hurts to look at even as a survivor main
---
Ik I didn't draw it I was looking at fan art
---
Then why are you here? Why are you making content for the game? Why are you posting your content about the game on the games subreddit and devoting so much of your time to this bad game?
---
Technically the meg saved you whilst getting karma.
---
So it's fine to fuck over the killer for survivors playing like shit and vice versa. Literally you're supposed to play worse sometimes if you want to ensure a rank up. This is why nobody gives a fuck about getting rank 1 any more
---
Thank you!!!!! For fixing the nat error!! I dont get them anymore!! Thank you!!!!
---
Billy and Bubba are the two scariest killers to face with dark devotion by far. Bubba sometimes can even sneak up on multiple people healing and down them all
---
Myers would butcher them
---
Forgot the tears from the past nerfs
---
Yes, calling a spade a spade, that's so reddit!
---
Lol I remember that. Crowder only used words that maza himself uses so nice fuckin try
---
Allegedly L4D3 was like 80% complete but they had an internal disagreement on whether to use source 2 or UE4 and it was completely canned.
---
You're being absurd for absurdity sake.  It would drive so many players from the game as there are players that play this game because they can play with friends.  We already have issues with queue times this would be horrible to see in practice.
---
Also your spelling or grammar or whatever that is in the next section makes your next thought a bit muddy but it looks like you're accusing me of being a liar?  This  would be quite silly and very lame to default to that here needlessly.  Don't be that guy man.  
---
On a game by game basis the statistics have proven that the majority of games played are soloqueued.  That doesn't mean that plenty of players don't still play swf though and I never made such a claim.  Just stated a fact.
---
Lmao karmas a bitch
---
What happened at ep 13?
---
it's a sidegrade not a nerf, since they also buffed it's healing speed by 50%. That means Pharmacy is a 15ish second heal with both the actual healing AND chest opening times. This is the fastest self healing perk in the game, beating out self care, inner strength and just bringing a brown medkit.
---
Oh my god, that ripoff, hahaha.
---
I do say, from the couple of ripoffs, that has the better art and programming.
---
But its so fucking rough, a deformed vat clone of the game. You like it because it REMINDS you of this game. What gameplay tips can we get from that? 
---
Forfeit button. nope
---
**GAME DESIGN.** The way this game is made, is that is balanced so that hooking all the players several times is JUST ENOUGH time to kill most or all of them. They do better, more escape, you do better, they all die. IF SOMEONE DELIBERATELY DIES OR FORFEITS, its basically like giving everyone a 4 minute penalty. SO NO. Rage against the dying of the light. Do not go gently into that goodnight.
---
Honestly NOED isn't even that big of an issue after like rank 15
---
You should probably remove the "non-toxic" part of your flair.
---
Why? Ochido is literally the epitome of toxic.
---
YES I AM!

I'm not trying to be rude, but I've never seen a good player run urban evasion. It's a huge red flag for me lol.

Agreed. Maybe making their power have very little to no CD and you can down people with your power (it functions like a normal hit). No frenzy stun of course. Take away the deep wound effect (it does nothing anyway). Will be a very good, consistent, well performing killer.
---
The Lighter
---
Yeah I used to watch his videos often but over the last year I can't bring myself to watch any of his stuff anymore. The constant bashing of the game got tiring.
---
Ah I see. You liked a thing and that thing changed so now you are just given permission to whine about it to everyone and tell them that they are what's wrong with the game and that they should appreciate the content you make about the game because you used to like a game. I see now
---
You disconnect almost every game in a row because of a bug? That sounds like a serious problem. I remember we had that load crash bug a year ago, but its gone now. 
---
If the game is completely broken (i havent heard about this) and then why worry about penalties, if the game is UNPLAYABLE for you?

Ive had people BRAG in chat after the game about that. (from their SWF's)

I mean I don‚Äôt run it but on that map it could be pretty solid

Who is this supposed to be
---
Once I hit red ranks as survivor I noticed a lot of the fellow survivors stopped looking cute/wholesome and started wearing lots of red and black especially. Makes me nervous to do a bad job in front of such serious lookin survivors!
---
Same

The montages are funny, and the only person being toxic right now is you.
---
Thanks, I didn't know that.
---
I honestly though you where referring to Adrenaline for some reason.
---
The current very of decisive is in no way unfair because the killer can always choose to play around it, and the survivor has little chance to actually use it strategically against a good killer. It's the most fair survivor perk in the game from the killers perspective, because they can just nullify it entirely if they choose.
---
I also like the idea that the traps should require 2 keys. Basically making it so it‚Äôs impossible to get it off the first time.
---
how to rocket jump in dbd
---
&gt;most of the player base has Tru‚Äôs mindset when playing.

I personally just play for the memes.

not really competitive but I still try a bit

Just imagine Home Alone's third act as MCote relentlessly bullying Pig and Legion and you'll have a hilarious if not somewhat sad time
---
I would like to thank you. Giving me a second chance to argue with this ignorance again. I guess people really either lie to get away with DCing, or truly completely misunderstand everythting to the point its awe inspiring.
---
"**SO YOURE GOING TO ARREST ME IF I TURN OFF THE GAME**?!" I imagine some people are saying.
---
NO....YOU WILL NOT BE BANNED FOR DCING once. Nor will you be banned for turning the game off, or even uninstalling. You will not be arrested. Obama is not sending a drone strike to retaliate. Please reread
---
OMG, thank you for letting me know this. I had never even heard about this and now I'm really excited.
---
Yah that blue shirt does no one any favors.
---
100% why I dont stream with multiple people. I just dont see the joy in blowing peoples ear drums out
---
Without noed its an insta? I'll play a game in a few and try it.
---
Yui‚Äôs scream is ear piercing omg.
---
Sometimes i try not to kill people to fast. I can hit people so hard, they go into the next dimension and disconnect
---
So its good if you're braindead for 99% of it?
---
I will admit that I didnt enjoy everything after that as much but I didnt hate it. I thought the villain was way to over the top to the point it made me uncomfortable but meh. Still entertained me.
---
That ‚Äúguy‚Äù is obviously Steven Universe from the Cartoon Network show Steven Universe, duh

Or identify actual problems? Since neither are really the issues causing balance problems.

Be glad you don't. I avoid playing Bubba at all costs, unless it's for a daily for this exact reason. But Bubbas are FAR WORSE than Megs

Its just a game bro

People kept calling me Charmander because of the similarity to my name so yano I AM CHARMANDER ok thanks.

Tell me about it. I was and still am into Smite

Idk who Tyde is but this still got a good laugh outta me.

Maybe it's time to stop playing if that's how you feel. Don't play something that causes you stress.
---
Both are unbalanced.
---
One time, was playing against a streamer  and I escaped. While spectating, a Claudette did this and was shot up into the air. The streamer was so pissed off and reported her for exploiting a bug. I tried to say it was just dumb luck but he banned me from his chat.
---
This sounds like bad design. Why should one side lose if the other plays like trash

Killer main:Red ranks for almost a year

Survivor main: Since the start

Killer rank:2

Survivor rank:1

Your opinion: Yes. She has so much info and she gives away none, she is so unbelievably easy as well so you dont even feel like you got "outplayed", you dont even feel like you got "played". 
---
She breaks survivor, people argue that people hate her bc "she is just good" or "its bc you cant loop her like you do everyone else"
---
Which i say, i dont want her to be gutted, but she needs changes, she has no counters, so when she finds you, you are dead, no matter what. no matter how many times you say "b-but iron will!11!" it wont change anything. Footsteps are loud as shit as well and you still have no idea where she is or if she is even phasing.
---
Considering you made a similar post over a week ago, this just might not be the game for you. Yes, there are days when it can be more frustrating than fun, but if you can't just turn it off and walk away to calm down you should look into playing something else for your own mental health.
---
It‚Äôs easy to rank up as legion. Easy chase and hit points. I suck at killer and got to rank 9 in a day
---
Looking forward to the completed piece =)

Other way around for Jane

PILLS HERE

No..they aren't. They are both are resource you have to bring in exchange for something else. In either case you are sacraficing something more reliable for the power they provide.

Once again...you don't know what balance is.

Wow. Never have I ever read something so stupid and so far off the mark at the same time. I would just correct the several errors, but I bet its just gonna fly over your head.  Cya later dummy, if you wanna know why you are completely wrong, just reread my previous posts.
---
I'd say the change broke even.  They removed most of his synergy with perks that were prominently freatured on him but allowed his base power to be more effective on its own.
---
Honestly I'm a STBL whore and not having to sacrifice 4 stacks whenever the obsession decides to mess up my day is nice.
---
It wasn‚Äôt toxic, the video was made by AaronPlays. The video was something about 4 hype Neas.
---
This discussion is quite ironic.
---
Anyways, exchanging them for something else is an awful way to justify something is balanced.
---
"Oh, I have an item I can bring that lets me kill the killer. But I have to sacrifice bringing a tool box to bring it, so it's balanced."
---
No, that's not how balanced works, hence the irony.
---
Oh my god, at least give her some time to breathe!
---
Must be dying, faster...
---
Its completely unfair. You are invulnerable for 60 seconds after you are unhooked 60 seconds in a 10 minute game is fucking insane. Even more if your 4 minutes in.
---
&gt; he is not saying that a single survivor is going to be held hostage many times therefore, causing him to be unjustifiably penalized for dcing. He is saying that many people within the community are going to/have already experience being held hostage or a game breaking bug in which they will be forced to dc, causing them to be penalized.
---
You mean this part where you are contradicting yourself? Or is this an extremely elaborate way of saying that this isnt happening to one person, but many? lol
---
Wait... That map has grass and rocks? I can't see anything out of this darkness...
---
Yea, I'll miss some of my old Legion builds. But just making his base power more effective makes it all worth it in the end imo.
---
Jesus Christ, went right for the killshot.
---
I think these are cool ideas. I still feel the locker thing whilst cool, not really going to change the effectiveness of the perk. I like the sound of re rolling w chest though.
---
Oh wow I can‚Äôt believe that streamer got mad over that. I sent the video to the killer and explained what happened and she thought it was funny. Exactly like what you said this was just dumb luck that I could never replicate lol
---
*this is the biggest attention grab I‚Äôve ever seen*
---
  Also, you have to take into account the many people who play DBD and  suddenly they have an IRL emergency/urgency that needs to be attended to 
---
DO YOU PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE DBD IS GOING TO PENALIZE YOU FOR TURNING OFF THE GAME ONCE?!?! hahahahahhaa oh my god, its the same amazing argument everytime, i cant believe it.... Every game that does this.....
---
If you're not up for it, leave this game. Relax. Play something that you're going to enjoy.

lets not fuck Q times more then they already are. everyone is high rank bc its easy to rank up as survivor, your suggestion would do nothing but make it worse.

I was loading into a game as Wraith last night and someone crashed while we were loading and inherently, the game we were loading into was cancelled. Got a message from a random person saying "Camper Noob = Lobby Crash hahaha" with threats of crashing all of my upcoming lobbies. Promptly got into another game 5 minutes later with no problems.
---
because suicidal thoughts dont fucking go away.  its a constant fucking battle and i have no one.  im hoping i can find a reason with this.  If you dont want to deal with it just scroll past, it means nothing to you.  but the fact that youre upset im not dead because it means im fucknig ffake is stupid.  just dont comment
---
Honest question:  which one gets the blind points?
---
360 a frenzy legion is great but have you ever 360 a leatherface
---
We need this ngl we need more l4d related stuff seeing as valve is back at making games.
---
Thing I wanna know is if we did get some more left 4 dead survivors I genuinely would love to see what kinda perks they would come up with,
---
I had this one with Ellis but thought against it because it seemed to gimmicky to me, here‚Äôs a bit of it, feel free to put yours in.
---
Technical Genius
---
While working on a generator while within the killers base terror radius generator repair sounds are moderately reduced while giving a repair speed bonus of 3/6/8%
---
‚ÄúEllis: I built that thing to be 99 percent zombie proof, shame the one percent ripped it to shreds‚Äù
---
Just be careful. If they find out that it‚Äôs an exploit that people abuse, they will ban you.
---
its a very advanced loop, if you want to run it perfectly it will take ages, if you PM me your discord i might be able to teach you how to do it perfectly.
---
Not based off color, matchmaking can go 6 ranks higher or lower. If it doesn‚Äôt find a match in those ranks then it goes to 7, and so on. So this matchmaking is working perfectly.
---
This is already top comment but I still think it needs to be higher
---
Just let killers see the survivor's ranks before games so you can dodge any high rank survivors. Also, bring back seeing your fellow survivors ranks!
---
Well considering Tharp just changed rank reset a 2 month break if you are in red ranks presumably you would only go to green so it should help you out a bit
---
GLORIOUS! You respond to someone calling you a pedant, by being pedantic. 
---
Willful Ignorance is an idiomatic expression, describing someone who makes a bad faith choice to avoid becoming informed, so as to avoid making a decision they find difficult.
---
I wouldn't say perfectly because the skill gap between a rank 9 and 4 is pretty noticeable.

I mean it‚Äôs working as intended. Plus you still got a 4K so why does it matter?
---
You should I care whether or not I am guilty of such a thing when everyone is?
---
Not enough players to spread everyone out.
---
Nah I doubt they'll nerf it. Mad Grit exists baby! Just slap that shit on and machine gun your knife to a hook and laugh as people attempt to body block!
---
The way you want to run it is starting from the corner opposite the pallet. That way you have enough space to fast vault the window. If you are starting at the pallet and running clockwise to the window ( so you're vaulting from the outside to the inside) then that's wrong.
---
This is like behaviour saying "Is water wet?" And then leaving the conversation
---
Hmm I don't play against many trappers but I will have to look into that next time. Also, agree with the Kates
---
yes but did he ever get nerfed throughout those years?
---
In my experience, Ghost Face players aren‚Äôt just the most toxic killers, they are just the most toxic players period. Leatherface players are pretty bad, too.
---
For survivor, I‚Äôve actually seen a lot of really bad Aces. And Claudette‚Äôs seem to be pretty terrible towards both killers and and their fellow survivors.
---
Again, this is all personal experience.
---
Exactly why we need cross play!
---
More willful ignorance. What a trumpism too " WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE." 
---
Got any more hits from "Sophistry 101"?

So true about devour hope. I almost got all 4 a few nights ago because the totem was in a great spot but I actually felt bad for the last person so let them go. I may never get that chance again.

"Is this camping the basement?" - Survivors
---
I mean sure, it's working..but I'm pretty damn proud that I got a 4k against red ranks my dude. I don't think its that deep.
---
Breakout is suuuuuuper underrated. Made an entire post explaining why actually.
---
I'm Rank 4 so it's one of the most common things played lol
---
Ghostfaces aren‚Äôt more toxic than any other killer, they can just T-bag and now survivors fee what it‚Äôs like and hate it therefore GF seems more toxic to them
---
You came from GTA? Yeah, you should be fine then.
---
now ya know what its like to be a killer
---
Red rank players who understand literally every game is a shitty game, you are new, watch some streamers or somthing to learn killer.
---
Yikes. There‚Äôs also a legion bug right now where flashlight blinding with break them out of their power but not stun them.
---
The REASON the games are shitty is because the matchmaking is fucked, has been since launch
---
If only spirit was that thicc
---
No. It's not really.  What flaw was that? that I said it was balanced, and then clarified my point by saying it's part of balance.  
---
Again. You have nothing. You haven't addressed anything. 
---
Either come up with an argument, or admit your'e a crybaby and just want to complain.
---
Believe me, i know whatcha talking about

Fuck Carlos Maza

The chain traps would be way too much like Mortal Kombat. The first one is honestly the best for him.
---
No one, it‚Äôs meaning he has no friends. It‚Äôs the silhouette for when you wanna invite your friends.
---
Fair enough.
---
Matchmaking was changed to progressively check for matches across larger gaps. It starts matching against your own rank, then +/-1, then +/-2, and so on. Up to a supposed maximum of +/-6
---
The problem is that no one wants to play killer at low ranks. So there aren't as many Red/Purple ranked killers are there are survivor groups looking for a killer.
---
So a Rank 8 Survivor group looks for a Rank 8 Killer, finds none. Looks for a Rank 7 or 9 Killer. Then a Rank 6 or 10. And so on. By the time it checks for a Rank 2 or 14, it finds you and matches.
---
But don't forget... Survivors have it so hard and killers need to play by their rules or survivors are going to stop playing because killers are mean... :,(
---
They made one yesterday too, me thinks somebody just wants some attention.
---
Oh
---
Not a trend, this is the same person that made that post.

When he's playing survivor, and gets away with a stupid hiding spot: "Haha yes, live trash"
---
Plus man

Ah yes, I forgot. Maybe if I go stand motionless in a corner, I'll have more fun, since the survivors will surely have fun
---
Damn he's in 1st place 100% of the time in Mario Kart
---
the way some of the girl characters scream when hooked makes me think that their gonna start singing a song lmao
---
Calm Spirit is thw best perk.
---
There are two states for the RBT -- Active and Inactive.
---
When you first put the trap on, it's Inactive. When a generator pops, it changes to Active.
---
If the trap is Active, it'll kill the survivor as they try to go through the exit gate. If the trap is Inactive, it won't.
---
Basically, if the trap is ticking down (or would be if it wasn't paused for some other reason like being downed), then the survivor dies.
---
Today I learned bodyblocking is toxic
---
meh, good...rather be hated for telling the truth than be loved for living a lie
---
It's a very good perk, but only when it works. I have too many situations that it isnt useful for it to be something I run. It is a solid A tier perk, but not the god tier best perk in the game the community paints it as.
---
I've had matches were A the killer is camping and I can't save or B the killer is roaming with NOED and I debate whether to try to save them just to read "it was for points" or "i just struggled to struggle" or leave them and get called "selfish." Though most people I've been in that situation in were cool with it, I hate being in that situation because I feel like an asshole letting them die and I don't know if they want me to save.

It is top 3 though. Most of the time it helps you. You‚Äôre most likely not gonna be healed at the end because you‚Äôre trying to get a gen done or are running from the killer and that gets you a head start and a health state. In my experience it helps me a ton and adrenaline was popped as I got hit to the ground so it saved me. In conclusion sometimes it just gives you a boost but in the right moments or if you‚Äôre injured, it‚Äôs a real good perk. S Tier imo

Please tell me what your typical play session is like where you get held hostage and have to disconnect over and over and over all day long?

I main survivor and even I can't stand the sheer level of whining that's permeated this subreddit. Every day it's another couple dozen posts about how killers are toxic for... 
---
\***pulls out card*** 
---
...*doing the thing killers are supposed to be doing*...
---
I know things aren't perfect on either side, but damned if some of these other survivors have no sense of community. It's like, "If you play killer, you're a horrible person that deserves to be aborted."
---
NOED does not need to be nerfed. Its not very good and very easy to play around
---
Bruh she was just nerfed. Git gud
---
i dont even understand what you mean.  How am i threatening suicide?  no one gives a fuck about me
---
Just double checking so i don't waste the add ons. I know a lot of crap gets broken
---
Lmaooo. Tru3 said HIMSELF, the one thing that devs needed to change was a clear indication of when she‚Äôs phasing. This subreddit is just full of clowns who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking aboutü§°
---
Honestly, the best thing you can do is watch people like [Otzdarva](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDO__Z-tZD4bfG9m4AkK_uA) and other amazing players on Youtube and Twitch. You'll lean quickly by watching how and what to do. Otz is especially amazing to watch for educational purposes. He breaks down everything he does as well as teach new and cool tactics. I've been playing since launch but this guy surprises me sometimes with what he comes up with. Plus he's very wholesome. Other than that trial and error.
---
You'll be the first one to see if it works out :)
---
Im gonna wait patiently :)
---
couldnt be a swf or the carried would tell them about mad grit
---
Was that before or after he tried to pick apart Scottjund's Spirit video by making up ridiculous scenarios to claim that there's plenty of 'counterplay' to Spirit?
---
He's consistently better for me with the most recent update than he was before. I didn't use sloppy or STBFL on him though, so I got all around improvements.
---
When you turn on your phone to check that random notification in the middle of the night
---
Every killer would t-bag if given the opportunity to do so
---
&gt; No. It doesn't depend on you whether you get multiple people or not. It depends on the map and the survivors' positioning. It's not about playing "optimally," it's about getting lucky.
---
That's like saying there's no point in placing Traps as Trapper because all that matters is how lucky you are with the map and survivors. I mean sure, *maybe* you'll get matched up with survivor potatoes and all you need to do is walk around smacking everyone to get your win. 
---
&gt;Everyone on Reddit always say they don't heal against Legion. But guess what? Almost everyone in game still does. Rank 1s still self care against sloppy butcher. Even if survivors didn't heal, it still did it's job. Sloppy Butcher on Legion was to deter healing further (on top of the power) so Thanatophobia could actually be useful. Since Sloppy Butcher doesn't work on Legion, people will continue to heal as they always have, but now without the slowdown, making Thanatophobia also bad on him.
---
I see what you're saying here but if they still choose to play through the Thanat while mangled (which optimal survivors will do as to not waste time healing), then Sloppy becomes useless again. Thanat is actually great on him as long as it further convinces survivors to spend time healing. Now obviously you're right if survivors still choose to heal through Sloppy/Thanat and not progress gens. But survivors not aware enough to realize what a bad idea that is are probably not going to last long in the game or in chases regardless.   
---
&gt; Wrong. Healing gives survivors an extra health state. Feral hardly ever shortens chase time, if at all, because of how long the fatigue is, and the fact that you are just an m1 killer for the second hit. Feral makes for easy injures, but not healing makes for easier downs. Forcing Legion to hit you twice still wastes his time.
---
What are you talking about, if you catch a healthy survivor at a safe loop, Feral Frenzy takes care of that rather quickly. If you choose to commit to down the survivor after injuring, you simply need to catch up and end frenzy and the chase begins within decent range. Forcing Legion to hit you twice requires you to heal which takes time out of game progression and that's the whole point. Time spent for the healed state will go to waste after how easy it is to re-injure. Also if survivors choose to heal, they also choose to give Legion the crucial intel. Efficient survivors would just deny this by not healing and progressing the game as it wouldn't be efficient for the killer to frenzy already injured survivors..
---
&gt;If you can't notice the extremely obvious benefit from STFBL, there is nothing left to say. 
---
You mean the minuscule benefit? Please enlighten me on this extreme obvious benefit. 
---
&gt; You seem to be completely stuck in this mindset of thinking about everything in a vacuum. In a vacuum, Sloppy Butcher shouldn't be good on Legion. In a vacuum, STBFL wouldn't do anything because you can just Feral them. In a REAL game, those were his best perks. 
---
Yea no, you've listed two perks that are now useless on Legion, but were never very *useful* to begin with, in theory or in a REAL game. Sloppy *could* be useful but could also have been a wasted perk slot or could have even worked against you as killer making it a perk-slot not worth using. Quite an extreme from his *best* perk. STBFL was easy to acquire stacks, but had very little actual practical use in a REAL game aside from the occasional hook standoffs and getting a jump on a survivor after downing another (not to mention possibly handicapping yourself if you choose to avoid your obsession). If you want to talk about real perks that got nerfed, you can talk about Franklin's and Dark Devotion. But I'd agree with you there and I'm going to miss running those perks.
---
&gt;Because in a REAL game, you don't always have Feral, 
---
Yea but the recent *buff* makes it more likely that you do.
---
&gt;or you are hitting someone while you have a survivor on your shoulder. 
---
Huh? Ok? What does STBFL or Sloppy do here?
---
&gt;In a REAL game, survivors heal against Legion all the time. 
---
Yea and I want to incentivize them to do so as much as I can. Even if it means running zero perks to counter healing.
---
&gt; In a REAL game, you won't get the option to hit 3 survivors very often.
---
Yea, but the recent *buff* makes it more likely.
---
Playing sweaty = playing at your best/putting killing first. Then wouldnt the people who can stomp a team in seconds rank up quickly, and then play against sweaty survs?   
---
Nothing wrong with sweat my guy, just the rank system
---
I unsubbed as soon as he said the only reason he was going back to DBD was because he needed the money to buy a new house, not because he actually liked the game
---
I played fifteen games today, most with 1-2 friends. I needed three more escapes for my challenge. I got one at the beginning and the last two at the end. I was fuming until game 14.
---
I think it‚Äôs best to just let it happen rather than force it to happen, it sucks if you‚Äôre fixated on the thought of getting them done but once you have one toggled it‚Äôs bound to be complete at some point. I definitely get where you‚Äôre coming from though.
---
I used to be a rank 1 wraith, but you needed to tunnel and camp and a bunch of stuff. Im finally making it back to red ranks fairly and it sucks man, cant play any fun killers
---
They don't lose, they just don't get rewarded as much for their win.
---
I don't watch much of DbD, only for fun: people like No0b3, Otz and HybridPanda, as well as Ohmwrecker sometimes. Honestly watching any good and decent player on either side works as long as you pay attention to what they do. Scott Jund and Monto are a good shout as well, saw him mentioned in other comment. You can just go to twitch and watch whoever is the top DbD streamer at that time. They are all decent to great players with few actually amazing and god tier ones as well.
---
These rank reset changes are god tier, people will be able to get to there actual skill rank even if they dont play enough
---
The problem I have with this is that you have 1 person dead, 1 person hooked twice, 1 person hooked once, everyone is injured, and the Jane was either hooked once or twice. You also still have ruin up and they've only done one gen. You couldn't be stomping them much harder than you are, so is it really worth complaining that you got DS'd?
---
"A while back"  
---
I'm pretty sure they don't have it activated
---
The game is at its best when it's a tense back-and-forth.  That's what BHVR has decided based off of their emblem system.
---
You may not like that, but that's what their ideal for the game is.  Survivors who genrush and evade a Killer will get just as little out of it as a Killer who stomps the Survivors without the Survivors getting a real chance to fight back.
---
Post nerf increased the effectiveness of Frenzy and allows for a higher probability of putting multiple survivors in deep wound.
---
Pre nerf Frenzy made it likely to get the first deep wound easy but the other three survivors would be able to gain enough distance and reach safety. Especially without frenzy add-ons. 
---
Being able to effectively put multiple survivors in deep wound outweighs the loss of perk benefits.
---
A ranking system that doesn't reflect winning/losing is bad design
---
No not really
---
We'll make it with ghostface, great for farming then healing who you damaged.
---
As if Ghostface wasn‚Äôt OP already
---
When did survivor mains complain about pig? I thought she was fair

tl;dr idiot content creator who infamously ranked Leatherface as B tier and Hag in D tier. Videos on that subject here:

He's also well-known for jumping onto various DbD clones and making content for them, insisting that they're the hot new thing that will "replace Dead by Daylight." In particular he was really into Deathgarden and I remember him saying that "everything about this game is better than Dead by Daylight except for the playerbase. Once people realize how much better this game is they'll all come to this game." Mmmm that statement aged like a fine wine, didn't it?

Finally, a post about Michael‚Äôs cosmetic that doesn‚Äôt mention his pantsless-ness
---
Lol I played against that person yesterday
---
What bill should have done was take the down and let himself be shouldered, to incapacitate  bubba. Instead of running a loop run to an open area where bubba wont turn down the opportunity, further from basement of course.
---
Good pointü§î
---
&gt; It absolutely doesnt outweigh other perk benefits. No idea what mental gymnastics are being performed to reach that conclusion.
---
The perks you listed aren't very beneficial. 
---
&gt;Your entire premise just assumes that it was a struggle to apply more than 1 deep wound per frenzy which was very, VERY rarely the case.
---
Yes, and this was corrected with the update. It was a struggle with how quickly the frenzy ended and how slow window/pallet vaults were. This isn't the case anymore. Therefore, it's an *overall* buff.
---
Hey this is a thing now!
---
How about you take a seat and we talk about that iFunny watermark.
---
Shh, she's beautiful ‚ô°
---
I feel like agitation, iron grasp, and mad grit are all underrated unless they are used together. 
---
In my personal opinion I feel like corrupt intervention, nemesis, Dying light, and blood warden are all overrated.
---
For survivors I feel like adrenaline, decisive strike, and a dead hard are all overrated
---
Iron will, unbreakable, break out ( yui kimura‚Äôs new wiggling perk, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the right one), and empathy are extremely underrated.
---
I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions and thoughts in replies

It should've been one of the homemade masks while he was in the asylum from the rob zombie Halloween
---
You were aiming a bit off him for the majority of the time but you definitely revealed him several times no doubt about it.
---
No one is going to do that, not even I would predict the entire rest of the team throwing the game like that.
---
If BHVR knew how to make a functional ranking system, that would indeed be a logical assumption
---
Funnily enough I killed him yesterday with Leatherface. First to die in the match too
---
How does that have anything to do with you spouting false information about his opinion on her phase indication? You‚Äôre just changing the subject lol. It‚Äôs fine for people to have different opinions but it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôd rather not look at the facts before making false assumptions and accusations about a person.
---
I use ifunny/sc cutting tool to make my memes üòÇ  dont hate man! my profile is KingOfMilk
---
may i ask what that yellow perk is?
---
I don't know what you think I uploaded this clip for, but I got news for you bud. This isn't a complaint post or a post whining to change DS. The perk has been a meme among killer players since the rework for this sole reason and this was the stupidest example of its "aNtI-tUnNeLlIng" purpose I've ever experienced, so I uploaded it just because of how funny it was. I don't think DS is overpowered, just INCREDIBLY inconsistent.
---
Do you get it now? :)
---
This exactly. Make legion a near top tier killer that can cancel loops with ease. I see no issue with that
---
The last thing they mentioned was it was going to be turned on after everyone gets the update. They didn't confirm it on twitter or anything though, so I think it's on but they didn't confirm it.
---
ah sorry for the pic quality, that's sloppy butcher
---
Looks really well done, good jobüëç
---
If there is one person on hook and everyone is healthy, it is an extremely bad idea to give the killer a free down.
---
Yeah, I played nurse on the new map and whenever I try and blink through those stone heads it wouldn't go through them, even with a fully charged blink.
---
perfectly fine. i personally would replace that perk. its a bit useless unless you plan on slugging everyone the whole game.
---
That's one way to get 4 instant DCs, a depip, and no bloodpoints
---
Oh fuck off- everyone with half a braincell hated Legion. We have Spirit hate circlejerk (which in of itself is justified) but Legion was the same problem a million times worse. Totally unfun to play against due to how fundamentally bad it is in design.
---
Our most fun killers are the ones which can *miss* high damage output cause it gives you some means of counterplay as survivor. Billy and Huntress have very strong pressure, but only if they have good execution play by play.
---
Legion on the other hand was no risk, bite sized reward, but you could spam it over and over. His frenzy is impossible to outplay- you WILL get stabbed. And if he runs out, he'll have his power back super quick. His nonstop stabbing alone was horribly designed enough on its own, but his "chase the survivor backwards" exploit was the nail in the coffin. No one would blame players for instantly DC'ing upon seeing a deep wounds timer on the bottom left on anyone.
---
**Legion is not that bad** right now. He gets effectively a free hit on 1 or more survivors in exchange for a 4 second stun. Hitting someone gathers info on everyone else. You're essentially a 115% M1 killer with a perpetual insta-down.
---
If you're unable to make modern Legion work, you're going against survivors way out of your league or you're playing them wrong.
---
There was nothing good about frenzy letting you down people. That shit was aids to go against because there was nothing you could do as a survivor (OR as a dev to fix it) short of allowing survivors a free dead hard every 3 seconds.
---
It looks like we have the same friends.
---
Hm, okay I may need to work on my aim then, I always have trouble breaking him out. Thanks for the tip
---
We heard you the first three times.
---
Normally yes, to trade 1 hook out of potentially 8, to stop the bubba basement snowball, its different.
---
Just my advice, continue playing a 3 or 2v1 with 5 gens if you want.
---
Hold the attack button to charge up an attack when in Blood Fury. Allows for instant dying state and smashes pallets. I'm not too sure what else to say, I'm still learning him as well üòÖ
---
What if I told you he's always been a part of you &lt;3
---
The wiener.
---
Thanks for the tip, I go against ghost face majority of the time, so I‚Äôll make sure to have him centered and see what happens. Thank you
---
Well this guy clearly didn't
---
i didn't go past the loading screen before the dc
---
Sorry but I dont know how to link screenshots, but I can at least tell you how it looks like.
---
 So instead of the survivors appearing at the campfire when you find a lobby you are taken to another screen. It has gray background with the survivor sign in it. It is divided into 4 segments for each survivor. Each segment contains the character icon at the top with the character's and player's name under it. Under that there is shown what items and add-ons the survivor has. And finally under that are the perks of the survivor.
---
If you play killer then you will see 1 extra segment that survivors can't see. It has red background and the killer sign in it. It's the same thing but with killer. As the killer you can also see what items the survivors have but you can't see their perks or add-ons.
---
We have these things probably because the mobile team is separated from the main dev team. Also you shouldn't be very jealous since there is a lot of things that mobile players don't have (the bloodweb for example) altrough we do have some mobile only features (like the daily login calendar, ticket system, and free AC)
---
It's okay but I just personally don't really like it nor do I use it.
---
he said that the shards should light up on all skins and that prayer beads are overpowered and should have been nerfed too, not sure where you guys are hearing things but i imagine not from him
---
IMO Franklin's is entirely unnecessary and even counterproductive. Most survivors will waste time trying to get flashlight saves, which are usually very easy to counter for the killer. Let them follow you the whole match to try and make saves. It means there's fewer survivors doing gens.
---
i would say it's too late to change now but someone DC at the loading screen
---
Nice, enjoy your 15 minutes of being fascinated by iridescent heads
---
Yeah I guess if the perk was made meta then that would probably be the counter-play. All I know is that rn, in the red ranks, killers are most certainly not doing that when they see me running around them.
---
f... they didnt appreciate your mori
---
If you press the windows key right before the scream and then again to go back into the game, the rest of the sounds remain normal but you don't get a deafening scream :D
---
My GF has been wanting to learn killer so she will screen share when she plays, this is me everytime she gets someone
---
i think its the 18th of this month
---
I think it was just a misplay on your part, no reason to blame someone else for your own mistakes. You could have just escaped instead of going downstairs. And if he didn‚Äôt open the door when he did, he would have just gone down instead of you and you would have been pushed out.
---
This post has changed my view of life. thank you for this.
---
Should I turn it back down for other killers or is it better to keep it at 100 for them too?
---
Yeah good advice cheers
---
haha ok thanks :D
---
It's much better. It allows for lunges to hit way better.
---
Yes, that's an accurate assessment of what I said.
---
Why are you telling me what I said? Did you think I'd disagree?
---
Infinite Loops also count as not toxic. They're unfun, but they're not toxic. The survivors shouldn't **not** use them just to please the killer. Just like the killer shouldn't **not** tunnel just to please the survivors.
---
Pallets, Flashlights, Brand New Parts, Sabotaging... All not toxic.
---
You know what else isn't toxic? Teabagging/Flashlight clicking **IN GAME** for the sole purpose of getting the killer's attention. If the survivor is trying to get the killer to chase them, teabagging/flashlight clicking isn't toxic because it fulfills the requirement of a higher objective -- Namely getting chased to act as distraction for the rest of the team.
---
Teabagging/Flashlight clicking at the **END** of the game is toxic. There's no longer a higher objective, the game is over. So context matters.
---
Whenever someone DCs, it saps all the fun out of the match for all the other Survivors and possibly the Killer.
---
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. If one must suffer so 3-4 others do not, this is acceptable.
---
Nice hacks
---
You can quick smash, but you need to be away from objects otherwise you'll probably crash into them instead of hitting anyone. Use Wrath when after a hook, or when you think you have an opportunity to get a few people. You need to use it so you can clean up the orbs and have a higher chance of tracking newly injured people or people who haven't healed yet.
---
And it's fair for people to arbitrarily decide to ruin entire matches? Especially with these queue times, I think not.
---
I didn't use hacks
---
Other way round
---
What does everyone think of gen camping like if I know they only have one gen almost done is it douchy of me to stand there cloaked with wraith and wait for them to come back?
---
Do you have to down survivors out of a demon dash or can you just use the demon strike on its own to 1 shot and break pallets
---
or maybe mental health is an ongoing battle and venting here helps.  You don't need to fucking comment if it bothers you, but you know that saying I'm faking pain for attention is going to be hurtful so idk why the fuck you feel the need to say it.  No one understands mental health anymore
---
... but isn't that what they did?
---
The scream at 0.15 was truelly amazing Ahahaha
---
because depression doesn't go away over night.  I don't know why people are fucking surprised.
---
I get red ranks at rank 8. So much for playing for fun.
---
I enjoy the challenges makes me change up my playstyle a bit. Some of them are mind numbing like unhook 25 ppl. The don't get hooked running spine chill was a lot of fun and intense. I've played both sides so I've progressed thru the rift pretty decent. I only hope the make more original challenges in future tomes. If I have to do unhooks, do gens again I'm not gonna bother. I hope more perk involved ones are put in.
---
bullshit, everyone knows the cap is 0.9
---
That's not a bug it's how it works
---
I think the only good think of sao at this point is the first arc,the rest of season 1 is just bad and season 2 is trash at a very high level
---
I've experienced it both ways, mainly with killer though, much longer waits.
---
Demon Dash into smash and by charging a lunge. It's just harder to do on console. A basic hit isn't going to 1-shot them. Only the charged lunge.
---
I'm saying that nothing in the post implied it was meant to show off a funny situation and it came off like a passive aggressive complaint. That's why everyone was commenting as if you were complaining, bud.
---
Rick Sanchez, you son of a bitch
---
I‚Äôd say try to get used to it
---
O P T I M A L SWF
---
I play both sides just so I can try to get whatever lobbies I think will be faster, but yeah some days I can go make some lunch and come back just in time to join a lobby, its brutal.
---
Really? Last time i played about 2-3 hours ago ranks were still gone
---
Two Myers one Kate
---
Yes
---
He died
---
Needs PWYF
---
Would be hard countered by Enduring. I don‚Äôt mind the concept.
---
Now i'm curious, how many dc?
---
You can cap every category and still get gold gatekeeper.
---
I don't know as the game didn't even start lmao, DC in the loading screen
---
Indeed. I don't think it was a great idea. It's one of the reasons survivor lobbies are taking so long, and I feel like it honestly prevents a good deal of newer players recommended by friends from wanting to play the game. Sometimes, you wanna play with a friend who can help guide you along for a bit, and that doesn't really work with higher ranks as much.
---
Would be nice if I could even get a match against him lol
---
I know this isn't off a current comment but idk who tyde is but he sounds like the anti-Otz lol
---
I want this too, but I think they will never implement it
---
They are still supposed to have the stun because it cancels FF. It isn‚Äôt supposed to just give the killer a free hit.
---
Rough google translate of the Spanish:
---
‚Äúlet's play whatever we want. You don't like it, you don't play.‚Äù
---
someone said that the deal with being able to use his character might stipulate that bhvr isn't allowed to touch the mask
---
If that would have been a Wraith, i would have called the police.
---
Depends on how you played to get there, but just getting to red ranks is pretty good, The real achievement is when you naturally reach and stay in red, I believe in you.
---
I had 2 other people doing this to a Myers in a match right after I got the first blind on him. I just slowly walked away and watched the shit show from a distance. I kinda felt bad for the dude. I initially used mine just to get away but I popped off some chain blinds to make sure of it.
---
Frosty Eyes? Cleanse totems.
---
Ghost-pig-face, Ghost-pig-face, does whatever a Ghost-pig-face does,  
---
can he place a trap on your head, no he can cause he's not pig,  
---
can he stalk and one-shot you, no he can't he's not Ghost Face.  
---
What does he do, no one knows,  
---
But none the less, he's Ghost-pig-Face!
---
Only to someone with a low opinion of themself!
---
I do this with my buddy who I introduced to the game. It‚Äôs great because obviously he learns a lot plus I‚Äôm more critical of my gameplay while showing him. We both improve!
---
It‚Äôs pretty much play with No Mither or play against a Gatling Gun huntress
---
If you post something like this you need to block out any usernames
---
I would only care about 4k‚Äôs if they were done with insane requirements eg. Old Freddy no perks or Addams at red ranks.
---
Almost everything but shitty meme's get deleted on this sub...
---
Nurse - Duh
---
Spirit - Still top 2, just harder to play
---
Billy - Loopable, but has giant pressure, punish potential and an ability to end chases quickly
---
Freddy - Some put him above Billy. Kinda obvious why he's here
---
Huntress - Ends chases very quickly
---
below that I'd have either Oni or Hag
---
Hag is a mess to play against as solo survivors but is sabotagable.
---
Oni is like Billy, but can't curve much and has to charge his power. Billy is more reliable and that's what counts the most. You have no tools to get the first hits easier, which makes getting your first power hella hard in red ranks, and once you get it, people tend to heal, hide and wait for it to end
---
This is why i hate that you can't hit hooked survivers anymore. It used to be a way to shut those Fengs up.
---
Do you not realize that it activates for 1 minute after a survivor is unhooked? Even if you go and hook someone else it‚Äôs still active when they get unhooked. No matter how long they‚Äôve been on the hook. Dumb asf.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
They gave that sweater to everyone for free
---
Ain‚Äôt no one wanna bring streamers with a mori I don‚Äôt condone dcing but if one happens for this I understand why
---
Well we can leave the mask the same, but he does wear bandages in the beginning of 4. It‚Äôs weird, but I understand I suppose haha
---
aaaannnnd you ruined it ;)
---
Alright. I have an idea based on this, being a new backstory.
---
A young man, called Chris Brown before the world was ripped from him, and him from the world, had his entire life to look forward to. Early 20s, good job, good house, and a lover ready to wed. Life, was perfect.
---
 Until that fateful day, when coming home from work he saw an familiar vehicle, and a light on in his house, and the front door cracked open. Rushing inside, assuming the worst, his ears were assaulted. Quickly investigating, his fears were confirmed, and a cold rage enveloped his heart. 
---
Chris was never a violent man, but this day he broke his vow and ripped both his wife, and his now ex-best friend to literal shreds with his bare hands. The neighbors heard this, and called the police. To escape, he leapt through his bedroom window, now cut and bruised, he fled. Finding his way into the local theatre.
---
Lost, scared, confused and hurt he hid, the numbness fading away and a torrent of emotions flowing forth. Grabbing a nearby puppet, irrationally needing to end the pain, the puppet ancient by most standards, held together by rope and worn leather straps rather than string, he found his way to the rafters. 
---
The police now closing in, he took the plunge, the rope around their necks like a diver and their tank. Soon, he found himself in a new world, trapped with the pain he has inflicted, forced to relive that day over and over again, while his rage fuels the mindless puppet that he now is.
---
I love hatches.
---
Console red rank surv. I‚Äôve played some good ones and some really bad ones, but he‚Äôs definitely sitting up in the A tier imo.
---
Not really. Rank is 90% playtime, but if it feels rewarding to you there's nothing wrong with it.
---
Dont blame u lol. Its macmillan with dark trap add-ons. Its actuslly a pain to face a good trapper on that map.
---
no, but it was a shit perk on him to begin with so it doesnt really matter.
---
*Unhooks someone 3 seconds after I turn my back and I turn around and instantly knock them down again*
---
StOp CaMpInG nOoB
---
I can relate
---
R E A
---
Why are your perks all blue?
---
This is why we use bond and spine chill people
---
Salty killers coming up with excuses for their lack of map pressure.
---
Right? I thought i was the only one but jesus, Oni feels like a stealth killer to play against.
---
WTF?? Is this on the current update? This is so 2016 man
---
I agree. Objectively it‚Äôs strong because it gives a chance to come back from otherwise completely lost games. However, I find in most cases it usually only nets 1 kill unless the survivors think it‚Äôs a good idea to be altruistic against a 1 shot killer.
---
Either or it‚Äôs a perk that wastes a slot until it‚Äôs too late in the game, which could be better used by a perk that is useful and could prevent the game getting out of hand in the first place.
---
It also can reinforce a bad play-style and expectation if you use it and rely on it too much to win games. It‚Äôs a crutch perk, and if you don‚Äôt strengthen your ability to play without it then you‚Äôll find it very difficult and jarring once you stop using it.
---
No, but thats really not enough differences for them not to be compared, and changing obsession is irrelevant without other perks to back you up
---
BONK.exe is not responding...
---
Tbh the only killers that should be put in the ‚Äúhard‚Äù category are Nurse, Spirit, and Huntress. Most of the hard ranked killers are fairly simple to play
---
I still main Legion. Legion will always be my main and favorite killer.
---
Doctor
---
are we not gonna comment on how you‚Äôre the type of person to be salt about winning GGG GEN RUSH TIER 2 RESUCUE HAHA UOU SUCKIEHDHF
---
Any specific skin???
---
The Nurse
---
Nah, just do default
---
Do you have a link?
---
Alright
---
I had a guy type me a mad rant demanding to know why I ruined his fun by slugging him for like 30 seconds.
---
He was near a 99d gate and a dead hook and I didn't know where his teammate was so I could have been easily bodyblocked. He could also have had unbreakable so I couldn't leave to find his mate. As soon as I found his mate nearby and pushed him through the 99d door, I hooked.
---
None of this satisfied Mr. Give-Me-Fun or his team of idiot hecklers. It's like they expect me to give them a YouTube hilight for free.
---
Yeah, and 6 per cent of players have reached rank 10 according to Steam. Seriously, the Devs even said not to look at the stats they release for accurate information, there's so much that happens that isn't recorded.
---
I play legion a decent amount and I‚Äôve been blinded plenty. Never once have I skipped my stun.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen you can swap challenges and keep progress on the first one. As long as you remember before the match starts you should be okay!
---
No worries man
---
My main goal was to make him a hopeless tortured husk who mindlessly follows orders from those stronger than he is out of fear, no matter how gruesome the task. He would always have a pitiful look on his face and would usually be quiet but when false light activates he becomes desperate grunting and moaning loudly. And if he fails to hit his target he becomes obsessed with them like a lingering order that he's desperate to complete.
---
Actually I think the young viewers are mostly with these terrible editors like Noob, which I find unwatchable because of the cuts and so called humor. That's what the kids and tenns watch when they got to youtube, because 'there is so much going on, lol, wtf was that sound, haha' kind of content. Trues content is just gameplay and that's it.

It‚Äôs so annoying I play killer at rank 8 and get a 4 man who are rank 2 and then play survivor at rank 5 and get rank  7 killers when my friends are both rank 10
---
Dying Light is a terrible perk.
---
Doesn't affect the obsession, boosts the obsession, gaining stacks requires you to hook people affected, which reduces its effectiveness and if you ever hook the obsession you risk them killing themselves and throwing your hard work into the bin
---
it also makes the obsession the biggest threat (works the fastest, as it isn't affected by Dying Light) that you can't do anything about, cuz you have to hook everyone else
---
Those are some broken-arse legs, I never will unsee this, and I now hate the benevolent icon for the sheer discomfort those god damned mutilated legs give me.
---
A buff. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. RIP Legion. Can't use a good 25% of perks because Frenzy hits don't apply them anymore.
---
Yeah it seems like it. I'm asking though cause I saw montos recent vid on legion mixed with pop, blood echo, dying light, and thanatophobia and it looks insane. He used a time add on and the addon that makes the survivors hit after the first one hit with feral frenzy broken. It seemed kinda dirty tbh.
---
I think its saying that survivor mains bully them, not that they complain about them
---
Platform: pc
---
Type: controller
---
I left the game for a while and have just started playing again. I usually use a PS4 controller plugged into my pc to play but I‚Äôm getting weird input lag only on Skill Checks. Like I‚Äôll hit in the right place and by the time it registers it‚Äôs way outside the skill area. If I disconnect my controller and go back to MK everything is fine. I‚Äôve tried googling the issue but the terms turn up all kinds of unrelated issues. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
---
I had the same glitch with a nurse on the same map
---
Rock Solid just seems like a poor man's Enduring
---
You're totally fine. 
---
A lot of misinformation about the lawsuit gets thrown around.
---
How am I being defensive? People said that Crowder wasn‚Äôt what he said he was, I provided some proof, and I replied to people who responded to me. That‚Äôs not being defensive, it‚Äôs having a discussion. I asserted a claim, people said it was wrong, I backed up my claim. If you want to call that defensive, feel free. What would you call the people who are responding to me though?
---
Killer players always describe SWF grouos as these scary, toxic and sweaty tryhards, but 80% of them are just this. Sandbagging and tryting to fuck each other over lmao
---
Sure he has got his personality flaws, but you can‚Äôt deny he is good at the game. You can watch and learn from him, and most of his stuff is pretty informative and at the very least entertaining.
---
Is he the best? No, there‚Äôs always someone better, but I think some of the hate he gets is a bit much considering.
---
Oh okay thank you.
---
Oh okay thanks.
---
There's an addon that does this. It gives him extra bloodpoints
---
DS Stands for Decisive Strike, the perk you see on the left
---
I hit it every time. Just practise I guess.
---
Stop playing for a while? The killer challenges are all trapper based. It's not a good reason to DC.
---
So well put. Legion isn‚Äôt completely useless and dead like people keep saying, I play more Legion than any other killer and I can pretty reliably 3-4K  with them in most games. If you‚Äôre under the impression that they‚Äôre useless then you don‚Äôt play them right
---
I guess because I don‚Äôt like people who are homophobic, sexist, transphobic, racist, etc. and all around bad people. I like it when everyone is treated like a person and like we‚Äôre people, and I don‚Äôt like it when people pretend those things don‚Äôt exist. So in your view, I‚Äôm sensitive, and defensive, because I talked about this, and why would anyone care about it? In DbD your supposed to be empathetic and care about your teammates to survive and pass a trial, in Ash v Evil, he displays more heroism than Crowder ever has. 
---
So... Guess my point just because people like you think I shouldn‚Äôt, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not going to post this kinda stuff, because you shouldn‚Äôt ignore when people are assholes.
---
Blinding those toxic spirits smh
---
What changes legion got?
---
Only when you hit someone outside of FF.
---
killer have franklyn's and hit u as u left?
---
Spine Chill.
---
Steven Crowder has also said a lot of racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic things. 
---
Don‚Äôt deny it because it isn‚Äôt in your favor.
---
I could call myself a piece of shit, that doesn‚Äôt mean you have permission to call me a piece of shit. That‚Äôs not how words work. They are magical permission slips
---
Yeah thats my point, its fair game.
---
Block out the names next time.
---
That was just tunneling with extra steps
---
Congrats
---
Thank Fuck i had headphones
---
Here's the thing, if you constantly went up against your own rank you'd never truly get better at playing. Sure you'd rank up really easy going against only ranks within your own but true progress would be made as a player. Going up against players "out of your range" makes you learn better counter play against better player. That's why match making is any where between 6 above your rank. Match making is working fine.
---
Do what other Oni killers do, farm injured survivors until they get their power and slug.
---
I don't see an awful lot of reason for that, the people I was up against weren't the ones at fault.

Mainly use your shock to shutdown window vaults or loops. You can block any interactables with it. An example: Survivors is running to the hatch and teabagging at you? Shock makes it so they can't go in. Survivors want to open an exit gate? Nope, shock says not happening. Someone camping a pallet? Shock them and feel them mashing the pallet throw button when they can't do anything for 2 seconds. You can do the same with downed pallets or windows. You have someone that's really annoying with an flashlight or toolbox? Tier 3 makes it so they can't do generators or use their items. If you hook someone at the beginning, you can use your shock therapy to make someone do their initial scream when in your terror radius to find them when they're hiding.
---
I had this happen to me, a survivor actually rescued me by working on the genny and I was able to grab them. The grabbing animation pulled me out and put me back in place. I have no idea if I was just hitting the exit gate from their POV though, they just called me trash üòÇ
---
"gg piece of shit"
---
A stream I watch from time to time, who is a killer main, has said that if someone uses No ED on most cases its because they dont know how to play killer and I couldn't agree with him more.
---
So he can fap while watching us
---
Lol people always find something to bitch about. And that‚Äôs on any game. üòÇ
---
"gg too wz noob killer"
---
Ehhh what? No?
---
Why in tf are they reworking doctor hes just fine
---
That's almost exactly how words work
---
And what things has he said? I'd really like some examples
---
Hey I made Quentin https://www.reddit.com/user/Rewouu/comments/e7s5b1/quentin/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I hope this makes it to trending

Can confirm it has and does work.
---
Then blind their brains out.
---
No idea then =/
---
I can only dream.
---
Use your power as much as possible. As a new doctor player, try to use the green electrodes + interview tape for a 'sniper' build. You can literally shock people from outside your terror radius.
---
When people are in tier 3 madness, they will be hunched. At tier 3, they won't be able to repair gens/heal. They'll need to become sane again, in a process that takes ~10 seconds by default.
---
You can grab people off of hooks/gens/windows in shock mode. Use that to your advantage to deny unhooks, by spamming M1.
---
For more, you can always look up youtube gameplays.
---
Those two moried girls under jeff lol
---
This was the 4th time it's happened to me. Once I was able to grab someone as well, and accord to the survivors I just appeared out of nowhere. The other two times I got called toxic, baby killer, and that I deserved it
---
Yea force politics, gender and sexuality onto people.   Thats a away to sell your game.
---
No... that‚Äôs not. Here is one example of Crowder being racist;

Brilliant
---
Thank you
---
He was literally the killer to play for the first month or 2 of release so....no he wasn't always.
---
All the whining on here and the forum is why he was nerfed into the ground 3 times with 1 "buff"
---
My friend's stream dbd i stop watching cos the game is trash.
---
Had a fellow survivor call me a farmer because I tried to save him before he hit stage 2 even though the killer was proxy camping. He killed himself  to deny *the farm*
---
Oh i know this one! Aaronplays - 4 hype neas.
---
There are more clips in the thread. One in which he cooks a dog. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs satire
---
You don't keep the items you had btw. It pulls one out your stock. You lose everything with a dashboard
---
Yeah they kept running near me and freaking out when I hit them so I get the feeling it‚Äôs just a crap bug that needs fixing ASAP
---
Underrated
---
you shouldn't post other people's artwork without permission, and definitely not without credit. It's inconsiderate to the artist
---
I think overall, from the people I play with, it's cause they don't understand his power.
---
If they tunneled a single person for 5 gen it wouldn't have been a 4k. If the killer just tunnels a single guy and the other 3 manage to die I would question what they were doing all that time.
---
Because your not allowed an opinion on this sub apparently
---
because hes really arrogant  who actually believes hes a god at the game, when in reality he just a sore loser who cant admit his mistakes because his 12 year old audience keep worshiping him and bans anyone who criticizes.
---
Nope, you'll start fresh.
---
A rengar main lol
---
Ot has creepy statues that look at in the dark
---
sounds great! now make unbreakable and dead hard bless perks so they have counterplay that (in unbreakables case) isn't 'guess they have the perk :/'.
---
Red ranks with both Killer and Survivor, and my queue times are significantly faster for killer, since there are less killers at high ranks than survivors and the game needs 1 for every 4 survivors. 
---
The trade-off is having to verse a lot more pre-mades and people sweating their asses off, which does get tiring pretty fast. "Oh, let me try out this new build and have some fu- *3 gens pop by the time you get a single down*"
---
I dont THINK its satire either, I know for a fact that it is lol
---
If you actually knew anything about crowder you'd know it was
---
Either they're toxic or waiting to make sure they dont have to save.
---
Top 3 killer better then billy wdym????
---
Aah yes just as I thought you don‚Äôt even get a simple jojo reverence you uncultured swine!
---
This is why I Alt-Tab when I get hooked lol
---
OP
---
I got a 4k like this on the same map but with freddy
---
Should‚Äôve taken balanced landing, would‚Äôve escaped without broken legs
---
I could literally give you any clip and you would say it‚Äôs satire. That‚Äôs not what satire even is, btw. It‚Äôs a racist caricature
---
there was no mention of swf anywhere in this post.
---
Lol you were stomping the entire team in a game you had complete and utter control in and this is when you get triggered over a DS proc and have to take to reddit for?
---
I can't even imagine how you respond when you're losing a game.
---
Real Talk now: People make the Red Ranks seem such a deadly place as a killer. I frequently visit this place and gonna say: its not. Yes, you potentially face a lot more of these 4 man unstoppable groups (not gonna say swf bcuz i know by now there are also amazing solos out there), but you will also get potatoes and mediocre ppl as well at times. Its not a lost battle once youre there.
---
it‚Äôs a known bug. i think some have said if a survivor works on the gen it gets you out of it, but i‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a real fix or not, haven‚Äôt tested.
---
The fact that i'm a Steve main makes me cry and laugh at the same time lol
---
Totally thought the sound of slugs and spirit stuff was just me. Maybe gonna take a small break until this is all sorted. Dont feel like getting basement hooked or being stuck kicking a gen again.
---
First assess whether you consistently overshoot or undershoot the skill check; I very much leaned in one direction when I missed it often. Pre-check, if you overshoot, tell yourself "okay, I'm going to hit it BEFORE it's in the zone!". And the reverse if you undershoot. Then do that. You'll retrain the habit &amp; should be able to place it correctly later.
---
Also, practice on gens, naturally.
---
they are still testing it on pc and switch
---
I mean not really since you don't get rewarded for hitting high ranks and also it isn't that hard but since its your first time its nice
---
Nope, pc
---
I think they broke they sound files at least for me like everything is weird some survivors are soo loud yet far away from me and some killers  sounds are soo quiet yet they are close and im not talking about stealth killers.
---
my favorite streamer is FunGoose :) he‚Äôs a killer main and he‚Äôs seriously so sweet and fun to watch. he‚Äôs incredible at reading the board and knows a ton about every killer/survivor. He‚Äôs also fairly small still for now so he‚Äôs able to get to every question on stream. he‚Äôs an actual educational streamer. Please give him a look, he streams 4 days a week i think?
---
You're saying whispers on mobile gives a red directional line pointing towards the in-range survivors?
---
ahwüíñüíñ
---
Posting this literally tells us "Hey, look, I am an asshole and I have a video to prove it". Being a dick to someone and then boasting about it online is something an agry schoolboy would do.
---
Tbh I haven‚Äôt noticed the bug with wraiths power. Hell he‚Äôs still my main in red ranks. Well actually I haven‚Äôt played a game of red ranks yet since I just got their for the first time so I don‚Äôt know how it will go
---
Great concept, terrible dumpster fire of an execution
---
He just deflected the light. Fuckin Genji
---
In essence all billy does is hold m2, occasional m1 through vault/pallets. He is in the free roster and is labeled easy.  Slap a ruin bbq and you got red to purple rank billy with half the effort legion had.
---
Dont get me wrong- both killers are oversimplified for your arguments' sake. Both needs mindgames and knowledge at tops. When to rev up, curves and whatnot. But this arguement does legion dirty if you ask me. You NEED to know how to be an m1 killer to finish the job. And you need to know how to zone/pressure well above all with 0 power. Loops too. Vaulting over a pallet means nothing if your power cannot down the victim. At least billy removes the obstacle permanently.
---
God I hate hillbilly, it just feels so unequal comparing certain killers.
---
Toxic clicks
---
If I was to make this into a full-out meme video (Like SirRodions videos) then what would people think? I would use this as the beginning clip.
---
I played with Tyde, but not DBD. It was Last Year The Nightmare (which has voice chat). As soon as the match started he went into boss mode. "OK guys I will now teach you how to kill the killer". Nevermind the fact that we all already knew how to play the game, but we kind of just let him ramble.
---
Even survivor mains are going ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù
---
I love butt dancing at the gate as GF is that not allowed too?
---
i played a game yesterday with a Nancy who was running breakout/streetwise with an Alex‚Äôs toolbox. she had all the hooks prepped and managed to get three saves by sabotaging hooks before the killer tunneled and facecamped (i got her off with borrowed time and died for it, but she escaped :‚Äô) )
---
definitely doubt it will be meta, but a really fun meme build
---
Deja vu
---
Btw pls don't use noed, I'm a killer main and u fly don't need it
---
Hell yeah. I started to believe I'm the only person seeing this. My faith in people is back. 
---
Especially when he plays survivor he plays SOOO bad. He rarely looks behind, blindly throws down every pallet he can find instead of being resourceful, rarely uses windows etc. 
---
When he plays killer against good survivors he cries and says "Can I get a normal game with normal survivors please? Why do I need to face toxic SWFs" bla bla bla. It's always the others.
---
No you can't get banned for any of what you described and I'm honestly pretty surprised at how you thought you could be based on anything you told us.
---
No thumb
---
Now i see it
---
that's ironic.
---
As someone who plays both sides, with survivor being Solo Q only, I concur. It's goddamn infuriating to deal with teammates who just crouch and do fuck all while I try to get a Gen done.
---
Happened to me too, there is also a glitch that makes the katana look like the stick
---
It's not really that good. It's more of people not working on gens. 1-3 gens should pop in a normal match before you get the first hook. People shouldn't really heal against this build. The only reason why it works is people are wasting a lot of time with healing for some reason even tho they have been broken for a minute and have been doing just fine
---
Its for when you get pallet stunned
---
Trapper was trying to force him into a trap
---
With the legion trick, you could just hit a survivor, then trail them until they bled out for a confirmed down. This would work every chase, so they ran bloodhound.
---
Against this version of DS, trailing a survivor for 20 seconds would be worse than just tanking the DS. Smart killers would just look for another survivor and let it expire (like they're supposed to.) Also, if a killer tried trailing you, you could just run in front of them to restart the chase. This didn't work against legion since he would just down you if you walked up to him, but it would here because you would be slugged with DS indefinitely. Even if killers tried respecting DS every chase, survivors would just stop running DS and waste the killer's time for free.
---
Nah he just has a fucking sweet gaming chair.  Crazy what a difference those things can make.
---
FOV gains don't stack.
---
It‚Äôs next to this one
---
Ok, if I want to use it I use it too bad just cleanse
---
tru3 is just mad that he will never be as good at survivor as that Ace. When he plays survivor he simply throws down every pallet he can find saying "this is fine, there are a lot of pallets on this map. As long as I buy time this is good play". Yeah, right.
---
&lt;3
---
Damn okay thanks that really helped me i will try kindred now
---
Lmfao
---
Wdym this happens often?
---
Damn, I woulda never thought to do that, very crafty!
---
They're not testing dedicated servers on PS4 tho. If killers were dodging you on dedicated servers you guys would still stay in that lobby instead of being kicked out. You'd just wait for the next killer to join
---
I agree that he is B tier.
---
His lethality and mobility put him above Huntress, Nurse, Legion, Doctor, Trapper, Wraith, Clown, Demogorgon, Hag, Leatherface, Pig and Myers.
---
But the time he spends without his power, and the difficulty of landing hits; put him below Hillbilly, Spirit, Freddy, Plague and Ghostface.
---
Why the downvotes? He is a bit toxic
---
A similar post did last year, so probably. It's a great meme after all
---
It‚Äôs a bug where you lose your item even though you escaped with it. It‚Äôs been around for months
---
[Here](http://www.twitch.tv/umbra/v/517265019?sr=a&amp;t=12s) at 19:27
---
Dedicated servers are only active for pc and switch, if it was active for ps4 when you're a killer you'd see the ping counter on the bottom right like when you're the survivor.
---
What it's like 33 secs with 3 survivors on one? Even less with toolboxes and BNP. But right they fine lmao
---
Thank you, do you play ps4? how are your load times?
---
can normally find a game pretty fast
---
People are still laughing at these memes? Shame.
---
Destroy my child
---
Why is there a big white block in the middle of the top panel? Did you cover a watermark?
---
Damn a witch skin for Hag would be amazing.
---
They justify being trash (as a killer main) and using it but in reality I just realize they're probably in middle school and wouldn't play the game anymore if they took it out lol
---
There are so many C shaped rocks it's mental. both killers and survivors get stuck on those a lot
---
That‚Äôs my point too. I dont get why he mentioned it implying it‚Äôs now useless on legion.
---
Hex: Jesus Grants the ability to kill someone randomly when you place them on the hook for the first time.
---
The guy literally dubbed himself as the TRUE TALENT. Why would you even expect him to be humble?

Honestly I'm not really sure that even sequel could replace it, because it's hard to convince folks to replace their *every character P3 all perks* 2000h worth of grind game progress for the same but newer and with less content initially

Could dying light work well with the oni's new perk nemesis? Because it you try to purposely get stunned then the person your chasing is the obsession and will be too busy running to be doing any gens while everyone else are slower at doing gens plus you could keep swapping out the obsession in the event of them killing themselves. Just a thought
---
I think you mean 
---
WAZAAAAAAAAA
---
Power creep! Make new killers better than old killers.

Steven Crowder is Ash confirmed
---
He is a really big streamer and I will fucking throw hate at him everywhere in order to stop people from watching him. Because then I'll get people that will dc against ghostface and wraith because true says they're op and teammates that throw every pallet instantly against spirit because that's the tru3 tactic. Tru3 should disappear from this community asap

People DC a lot on black offerings I find, but some of them are overkill. Saw a Myers the other day with Ruin, NOED, Devour Hope, and Dying Light, packing an Ebony Mori.

 I love the character of Leatherface but it‚Äôs so sad how almost every time I encounter a Bubba I immediately assume they‚Äôre just a noob

When you zap people they cant vault or throw pallets, ao make sure you know when and if to shock people in chases
---
Oh, it‚Äôs you again.
---
Just do totems, lol.
---
Yeah I hate the new map as killer. I play Nancy as survivor with her bright ass white sweater and I can still hide in the long grass without being seen, it needs a rework.
---
You need to grow up. People disconnecting from games because of who the killer is, is a reflection of them being pathetic and nothing to do with him. And now disconnecting penalties are becoming a thing, hopefully people that truly ruin the game will start to be banned. And throwing pallets early is just one way to play the game, everyone plays differently. If everyone was the same then no one would play cause it would be boring. Why is it so hard to let other people enjoy what they want to enjoy. It is my number one biggest pet hate.
---
Don't forget shitty memes like this that aren't funny and just give an opinion.
---
I might check him out. The main three I watch at the moment are Tru3, Otz, and PainReliever. I used to watch Noob3 but his upload schedule is nonexistent at this point. I also enjoy watching Markiplier and co. play too but that‚Äôs strictly cause I find them funny. Skill-wise they don‚Äôt offer anything plus it‚Äôs all pretty old now. Wade I think played it some without them but I only watch him every now and again.
---
&gt; Tyde is a joke and I'm amazed he didn't move on to Hide or Die or Identity Five or Soul at Stake or whatever "game that will replace Dead by Daylight" of the week he found.
---
Cause those games didn't have enough of an audience for him. DBD is where the money is.
---
Just for clarification, the survivors had no way of rescuing me, is was physically impossible.
---
When I want to make a peaceful interaction to a killer, I crouch once and big nod at them.
---
Survivor to survivor I double tap crouch as a thanks.
---
Spamming crouch always seems like bm to me.
---
Yes it was console, so what you are saying is escape then exit the after screen menus
---
Still more like camping
---
Stop complaining so much, god
---
That's not getting outplayed, if you farm someone right behind the killer with BT and that person has DS so while you SB away, that's not really outplaying the killer, but slapping them in the face with perks designed to counter camping (the terror radius) when they didn't even have the chance to leave, it's just screwing them over for existing.
---
Bubba w/ Insidious in the basement (or even behind the nearest rock) is pretty much exactly like that, there's not any counterplay outside of the Bubba being a potato, and it gets him a free down if anyone tries.
---
This exact same joke was posted like 3 days ago
---
yup, thats the only way you can deal with it, of course if the killer does this before the gates are opened you're screwed anyway
---
I suppose they could do an Overwatch 2 approach. Rebuild the engine but all progress and cosmetics carry over.
---
Or and this is crazy I know, maybe they are doing the tome challenge?
---
If the obsession just kills himself then that‚Äôs a good thing. Now it‚Äôs only 3 survivors. I don‚Äôt understand this argument. You have a whole survivor gone from the game.
---
The only real benefit to a sequel would be an engine upgrade and mechanics overhaul, but the loss of all your progress,characters, cosmetics etc would sting. Unless they copy what overwatch 2 is doing, but at that point just upgrade the current game. DBD will keep the lights on at BHVR for a long time.
---
I was going to say "I hope this hasn't been done before" lmao.
---
Wow and I always thought I was losing some items too, I wonder how many I've lost this way..
---
No it isn't taking the game hostage. It's pretty cheap I totally agree.
---
Just to note about what people are telling you about his power.
---
He's basically just an M1 killer that can shock at unsafe pallets to get an easy hit, which is irrelevant because it's an unsafe pallet anyway. Very rarely can you time a shock to deny something in a chase, like a window or pallet vault, and if you do a good survivor will just keep running and you'll have to switch modes/lose BL because of it, and thus slow you down so they're fine.
---
How about just removing all the useless ones while they're at it.
---
No, it‚Äôs just scummy camping. Take it as a compliment and move on.
---
If you want it centered around that perk, people may hate you for it but: Head-On, Quick &amp; Quiet, Decisive Strike, Inner Strength. Swap out Q&amp;Q for borrowed time if you want to hook save.
---
Lol bruh...
---
It's a known bug since about a week or so
---
Plot twist:
---
He was Killer
---
If your obsession dies you actually will want to tunnel off hook to try to get DSed in hopes if gaining a new obsession. 
---
Dying Light as part of a ‚Äúnothing gets done‚Äù build along with Huntress Lullaby or Pop, Ruin, and Thana is actually not terrible on Plague. She negates the healing bonus to the obsession with her power, anyway.
---
You forgot the never ending shirtless dead memes

Hazbin Hotel is wildly different than the other examples Medic even gave, if you consider like... Anything about the setting.

Spongebob/Patrick/Sandy are basically the three stooges, MLP is monster-of-the-month-friendship-fest that only gets grimderp like once in a blue moon.
---
And then there's Hazbin Hotel, where no matter how bright and colorful it is, their world sucks down to the very last pretentious demon who is just waiting for the next purge and doing evil either because they like it, or out of nihilism.
---
A new killer perk.
---
Using Feral Frenzy purely for mobility and detecting Survivors with Killer Instinct makes him quite good if that's your preferred play style on him. And the increased vaulting speeds also help with catching up to Survivors.
---
Deep Wound was already pointless before this new nerf (no one ever goes down unless they are a newcomer and don't understand what Deep Wound does. There's literally no reason not to mend when it starts ticking down), so just ignore it. Use it to initiate Killer Instinct and that's it.

i dont want this community anywhere fucking near AoM or any other non-pop culture horror game/figure.

---
Yeah, my dog is the same with threats like that. They know we don't mean it.
---
Hag is strong, but I would say she goes down SEVERAL tiers if good survivors have flashlights.
---
Imo The Mandalorian was a bigger disappointment than finally getting a lobby as killer after a 30 min queue only to have a surv leave during load screen.
---
Also whenever he beats someone who's shit, and people actually mention it in his chat, he'll say "that's what you always say, that they're bad".
---
Obviously he's playing against top (or "creme of the crop", as he names it) opponents all the time. But he's just better.
---
DS skillchecks not even appearing, died because of this twice yesterday.
---
At least you don't see it 24/7, gotta live with it since these devs will never bother to fix it.
---
aim a lot lower he should be in the middle mostly
---
Exactly
---
Eh. I just play the game normally, but I'm respectful at least. None of that toxic bullshit, just a guy trying to please his tentacley overlord, or vice versa.
---
Nothing with a "timer" on it is holding the game hostage, BHVR's philosophy is no situation you are in, in which the game can be brought to an end either by your own actions (completing the generators included) or by way of a timer (hook timer, EGC timer) can be considered a hostage situation.
---
So if the Pig puts an RBT on all 4 survivors and they somehow all have their keys in one box, that she is blocking, that's not a hostage situation. The survivors can still complete the generators, open the exit gates, and cause the game to end (even though 3 of them will die by triggering their RBT and the 4th will get the hatch).
---
If a Bubba traps all living survivors in the basement, but refuses to down them (he doesn't have to hook them since death has a bleedout timer) then he's holding the game hostage, unless the EGC has already begun.
---
And let's take the Pig situation above; if the four survivors refuse to repair generators, the survivors are the ones holding the game hostage (infinitely immersing for a long duration counts, since a killer without Whispers is never going to find a dark Claudette crouching a dark map to avoid crows, and sometimes even with Whispers), the Pig is allowed to block a box to cause the RBT to kill someone (her objective is to kill survivors after all), but the survivors (*as a group, you can't report that one survivor cleansing totems instead*) refusing to complete their objective (repairing generators) can be reported.

"Coffee and Farm, Dinner and Electrotherapy" 
---
That's what it says on my psn account. I play nice killer WAAAAAY too much in the mornings and usually now. (I play doctor.) I do it for blood farm. Make my blood points (or dailies) thank everyone and walk away. I even created a rule list so I cant get banned for it as people say. DBD has killed my fun on multiple occasions and I feel like bloodfarm is the only way to play killer without getting upset as the toxicity of survivors who message you and taunt you after or during game. (And they say killers are toxic for NOED &gt;_&gt;). I play nice killer a lot and if it works out everyone leaves happy. If it doesnt then I'm satisfied that I know I wasnt playing my best and they can pretend their high and mighty.
---
The plague is a killer that is easier to. Loop her well enough and you're better off not cleansing because that's the only way she can down

---
Had PWYF, NOED, Bloodlust 3 and Devour Hope with 2 tokens.
---
It was probably a 4 man swf with the rank 10
---
Friends?
---
(Just a opinion) The reason why I think it shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed because , (1)gen rush exists and it‚Äôs a clutch perk for low rank killer to either get a pip or brutal cuz at high ranks it a loss if you kill everyone at when the gates are powered and most likely you‚Äôll depip or get brutal.I‚Äôm not saying gen rush is your fault it‚Äôs the devs poor game design.
---
(2) like yin and yang ‚òØÔ∏è- there is adrenaline and Noed - in the killers perspective its bs to have all survivors pop adrenaline and just heal all of a sudden and have a speed boost for 5 seconds (yeah may look rewarding to the survivor side but what can the killer get for being rewarded to be in the endgame - nothing but Noed is there to help people not lose their rank or help them barely pip which might look scummy to some but it‚Äôs a game style people have and judging them is kinda stupid cuz the same argument is used at why you‚Äôre using D strike it‚Äôs scummy to use against us killer - just a example ik it‚Äôs for solo que people who get farmed but at times people abuse it)
---
It‚Äôs not tome 4, it‚Äôs the fourth level of tome 1. It‚Äôs also nothing but master challenges, so it‚Äôll be fun to see all the complaining people do when it comes out haha.
---
Was half expecting you to grab him and throw his ass on a hook, the way you were stalking him lmao
---
And then you just have Otz, being wholesome as fuck
---
Na he had a mori so he wouldn't have picked me up, me and the last other guy already hooked, that was our first hook so he couldn't do it to us
---
If the obsession kills himself over dying light then that‚Äôs only a good thing. That‚Äôs 100% reduction in gen speed, healing, unhooking, totem cleansing etc.  
---
I agree in the situation where the obsession isn‚Äôt an idiot and doesn‚Äôt kill himself dying light isn‚Äôt good.  
---
3 survivors are at a massive disadvantage.

I need this in my life more then I need "Billy v2.0 a.k.a. The Oni"!
---
No I mean what is your level and devotion? e.g level 30 devotion 2
---
This why I never trust a killer asking me to help them shit like that happens
---

Na he had a mori and that was my first hook as well as the guy who died (on his first hook)

Devotion 5 lv 86
---
If someone released these icons as .rar files we could manually do it in game files and I'd be happy as all hell
---
The fact you say "killer main" shows you have absolutely no idea what he's about.
---
DS wouldn't have helped bro, he had a mori
---
Lmaooo this is true
---
What do you mean? You want the blue/red icons in the image or you want to make your own favourite icons?
---
Devotion 12 level 55 :)

# he said:

Ah, now see the Mori skulls, good play in any case!
---
I couldn't imagine cuz the rank 20 crawled far away and bled out when i had no idea where she was.
---
Ohhh that‚Äôs why , no wonder when I tried to uncloak and got no distance
---
Ah the only stats that matter
---
you‚Äôre playing on hawkins there‚Äôs plenty of walls you can look at to avoid flashlights. Bodyblocking at the end would be annoying but if you‚Äôre just talking through the course of the game then you should be glad they‚Äôre taking hits, you get your power faster

Are you using hope?

I'm about to cry
---
I love how you posted this the day that my friend was streaming and for the first match was playing iridescent axe head huntress.
---
I'd actually rather be able to see our personal stats
---
Kills per killer, person most played, most used perk etc
---
She even got period from it
---
Yes, I am jealous of a guy who needs 9 year olds' compliments to build his ego.
---
Depends on the context
---
I had a challenge
---
There's no specific build for each survivor since they no differences between each other except how tall they are, how loud when injured and breathing. The only perk that would be flexible depending on who you play could be iron will. But you can still run that on every survivor.
---
Play around, test perks. The most meta build I can think of is 
---
Dead Hard
---
Decisive Strike
---
Adrenaline
---
Then whatever you want, Iron will, Borrowed time.
---
Dude... his comment is sarcastic.  ‚ÄúDone a pretty good job so far‚Äù is a common joke in the subreddit
---
Welp some survivors do the same thing getting headstart of 3+ gens on a killer that was thinking they are farming
---
The real tragedy here is playing Billy and using NOED.
---
Lol
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure depending on how long the survivors wait they‚Äôll be matched with as much as 5 ranks apart from theirs
---
Id be happy if trapper mori been like open trap above survivor head and then let it close which would kill survivor
---
Oh stat tracker would be fantastic
---
Look, I don't hate the guy per se, its just his young audience has made him sooo arrogant, its pretty annoying to hear him basically talk down to anyone who isnt "better".
---
Smash his head into the ground with that thicc butt
---
well of course i used it. Im HOPING that its the right perk though hehe. but seriously theres only one perk called hope right?

Agigation and mad grit with some afker on the back should be real fun.
---
I had no clue that was a thing. That‚Äôs pretty cool
---
That also happened to me, as legion  an as Freddy. As legion I was able to grab someone on the gen, and as Freddy I coukd still teleport.
---
What was weird, is that when I teleported to a gen, I was still stuck in the gen I just teleported in. After like 4 teleportations, I finally got a gen that was worked on and was able to kick it and I was free.
---
Wtf
---
Welcome to gen rushers meta survivor ma dude
---
It is called hunger games simulator. I would have put pictures but there wouldn't have been enough room to see it all.
---
Imagine a raptor as the killer with some Jurassic park survivors.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Now I know who to bring Iridescent Heads and a Mori for.
---
Mee t√∂ihin
---
Okay thanks! What If I dont have Laurie Strode?  I can only get this perk by buying her with money?
---
Higher Killers can be spotted more easy and you can also look above object's while looping the Killer and the small ones are harder
---
Honestly they are bright AF but they're also some of the dopest I have seen. When I see that glow in the dark neon mf running at me I'm always like damn that outfit is A tier and looks badass
---
I really liked his videos at first. His were the first DbD content I saw. His door to door mace salesman bit is why I wanted to get the game myself. But that was a long time ago. He was very negative for a long time until I stopped watching. I hope whatever has been keeping him down let's up and he can find contentment.
---
Well next time someone gets tunneled/camped/whatever it's not the Trapper's problem either. No fun for both parties, but at least ThAt'S nOt mY pRoBlEm.
---
I had already broken 8 pallets by then since the rest of them were throwing them early like potatoes. Figured Bill was gonna do the same since I had yet to chase him till then.
---
Idk why you‚Äôre deciding to be stupid but whatever

Why would that be helpful when you're injured lol?

Copy and paste the meta perks. Or my go to build Inner strength dead hard empathy and detectives hunch.

You can't perform actions such as repairing and healing while in T3 madness

I didn't take it

No. Her perk is on the shrine of secrets right now in the shop.
---
Level 946.. nice
---
You stink
---
Iron Will its no underrated but unbrekable i Also think its super underrated
---
Whoever upvoted this is a bitch
---
Nooo I want a full damn trex
---
Yes! When they are few meters of you.. Thats why i say whispers on mobile is op.. survivor have no chance to hide in brush or behind the other side of the gens
---
PWYF is bad for him, right? His power is literally an offensive attack.
---
This man is too dangerous to be kept alive
---
Me when I get found first by other killers: "Ugh not again."
---
Me when I get found first by Legion: "Time to do gens after I mend." üôÉ
---
Im not so sure if i escape while it is still active. Ill try to do it after this.
---
The first rework fixed them from just autodowning people with no skill but it didnt make them any good, they needed to be changed
---
I personally leveled feng to 40 and then got david leveled, I got bbq from the shrine and then mained killer until I got most of the teachables I wanted like BT Dead hard, bond etc
---
Pretty good idea so far.. In all honesty it would be awesome to know all if this plus Total Gens completed what kills on each individual survivor and on what maps items used perks played per game advanced T-bag stats plus let killers know how many Dcs lifetime.
---
Yeah that's different approach and I like it. It won't heal lots of core issues, but let's be honest, it won't be perfect even if re-done from scratch
---
It depends on what you mean by win? For survivors it may mean getting everyone out or just yourself. I had a match today where one survivor spent a majority of the match looping the killer. They ended up getting sacrificed right before the last generator popped. But they won us the match and would have gotten plenty of points for their chases. So winning as a survivor can be subjective.
---
Same for killer. Do you only count a win if you sacrifice everyone? I believe (someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) the devs consider two sacrifices in a match as a standard match for a killer. 
---
Truthfully, at lower ranks it‚Äôs typically easier for killers as survivors try to work out the game and how to play on certain maps / killers. Once you get into yellow ranks you‚Äôll go against survivors who know what they are doing, have good perks and you‚Äôll face the dreaded SWF groups. All these things make playing killer at higher ranks harder.
---
One of things I love about dbd is that the wins and loses aren‚Äôt always so black and white. I might have been sacrificed as a survivor, but that got the rest of the team out. I may have sacrificed three survivors but lost the last one in a hatch match as a killer. I try to think about improving my play, being an efficient player (both killer and survivor), what emblems I got over whether I won or lost and that I and the other players had a fun match.
---
I feel like there is something I'm missing with Whispers. I know what it sounds like, but I hear it 90% of the match when I use it, and it doesn't really help me find survivors at all because I don't know if the whispers get louder when you're closer or what. I feel like all this perk does is make me waste my time walking around an area I otherwise would have just passed through.
---
Wow a post about matchmaking that is an actual legitimate complaint. You shouldn‚Äôt be matched with these guys.
---
&gt; TT got real salty and left a comment that metroidvania isn't even a genre and that "With the 27 years of gaming under my belt this is by far the superior Action RPG."
---
Yup that's Tyde for ya lmao. I've seen country leaders in WWII with less of a superiority complex than him.
---
Yeah, nice meme and all, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to bring up streamers on this subreddit anymore. It **ALWAYS** devolves into ‚ÄúOtz good true bad‚Äù and I‚Äôm tired of all this hate towards my boy true. People exaggerating about how cocky he is, straight up lying about what he‚Äôs said, and now I see multiple people lying about the demographics of his viewership trying to invalidate any credit he has as a streamer. I hope you didn‚Äôt mean any harm, OP, but it‚Äôs obvious this subreddit isn‚Äôt mature enough to handle any streamer-related content.
---
It‚Äôs probably just a swf group, there‚Äôs no way he matched with you by just searching solo.
---
No not every single cosmetic, but all the ones he thought were only given to console players, yes.
---

---
Sorry I don't speak tree
---
Ah, thats fair. How does a 2 killer game work with stats? If one survivor is hooked, do you both get BP?
---
No it‚Äôs bannable if you‚Äôre holding the game hostage and I believe that has to be 10+ minutes
---
Right, but it‚Äôs happening across the map when I‚Äôm not even blinking lol
---
Tyde is what people who make fun of Tru3Ta1ent think Tru3 is: completely Killer-sided, unwilling to take any criticism, constantly whining, and with a massive superiority complex to boot.
---
It‚Äôs sucks as survivor too, there‚Äôs no good loops and the middle is a death trap
---
He also plays multiple games and picks the highlight ones of that session though so there very well could‚Äôve been horrid games
---
As a Wraith you have the Undetectable status effect while cloaked, which means the person running Object can't see you, even though you can see them, and you still got bodied? Should probably just improve your gameplay chief.
---
Honestly I know we all like to rag on him, but here's what I've noticed. He is usually correct in his views, but he always has one incredibly stupid outlier that derails his point (Corrupt Intervention D Tier perk)
---
Not the first time its been posted here but like how you knowingly took someone else's photo and attached your name like its adds a certain credibility. If you bother to look it up the photo came out in 2015. 
---
Go to Snopes.com and search it up. Then stop using other peoples stuff.
---
This is litterally my build! XD, Except instead of whispers I have bbq
---
sir you should really calm down, it‚Äôs not that deep
---
I do think it should be a bigger skill check considering you only get to use the perk once and if you miss it, it‚Äôs gone.
---
Bruuuuuh reddit did that no I idiot that hapens if you save a post inform yourself idiot
---
Yeah, went against him for the first time recently. As someone who still finds skill checks slightly intimidating, suddenly having them show up all over the screen has caused me to miss a few. I can see how better players who have the timing down would completely ignore that feature though.
---
Best advice I've seen. i wish more people would play both survivor and killer. I think it would make the average player better at the game, as well as make the community significantly less hostile towards each other.
---
Apart from at the start of the game the chances of 3 people on one gen is slim to none if you have been doing your job
---
I mean I guess but I could never do it cause if I don't like it on me I wouldn't do it to someone else
---
I never dc'd ever in the game but ok
---
I was waiting for someone to say Nea but more importantly wow another Bubba. What is up with Bubba that makes him so toxic
---
I always run spine chill, but most times others dont get my message when running off.
---
Yeah now that I think about it was implied that he died in a subway crash.
---
I got confused due to the trailer showing him in the house.
---
That's not toxic at all. That's how it should be played unless every time you are butt dancing afterward
---
A true friendship
---
Honestly at this point i would be happy if you could just switch challenges while you are waiting for the match to start.
---
No i don't want to unhook people as Wraith, cmon i still have a minute let me change my challenge!
---
I only butt dance at the gate when I haven't been touched for the entire match
---
Just the guy in the basement, the other 3 were the opposite of hostages
---
Imperial Guard vs Chaos, circa 2.123.456.M41 (colorized)... If anyone actually understands that reference I will be surprised and impressed.
---
Killer: equips lightborn because he sees four flashlights in the lobby 
---
Survivors:
---
Oh... I only have 970 as Im level 10. Can i get it on time?
---
The gift that keeps on giving.
---
I‚Äôd say both but if I had to choose I‚Äôd say all challenges are active at once
---
I think he gets a bad rep from new people playing him with insidious, and veteran players using him to meme.
---
My first week with the game I bought bubba cause everyone was saying bbq is the best ever lol. Problem was I thought hitting the survivor on the hook was what was making the timer go down, I had no clue it was an actual timer not a healt bar.
---
Yeah match making takes extremely long during lower ranks once you get to higher ranks it‚Äôs much faster I just got to red rank and I get games in less than a minute lol
---
whats swf? and what are the decent killers that are fun but have a chance against the optimized groups?  I think ill end up maining a killer anyway as i usually am solo
---
Damn rank 20 and he's already an immersed Claudette? That's crazy :O
---
killer is def easier to preform well in low ranks, but technically survivor is the better side but to get to the point where its OP most of the time you need a lot of game sense and a really good swf
---
In real Life Legion would Scare me most
---
To those people I only have one thing to say. Marry christmas ya filthy animal
---
You right, nothing scares me more than unhooking someone only to hear the rev of a chainsawüò≥
---
And i normally play with deerstalker but i couldn't find it in the blood web so i just used Thrill of The Hunt instead.
---
It would appear you had been yeeted to victory.
---
I do until the first excessive teabag. Then I focus on that person and nothing else.
---
Pls don't get rid of speed limiter. How will I ever get my ez 4ks?
---
Dude you should run knockout as well.
---
I didn't use sloppy/STBFL before so it feels like a buff to me.
---
SWF = survive with friends. A game mode where up to 4 survivors can be sure that they get into a game vs the same killer. Can be used as either a fun time to enjoy the game with your friends, or as a tool to be toxic and make life horrible for the killer (since you can build your survivor perks deliberately to work well as a team and be on a voice chat program to tell everyone where the killer is at all times)
---
As far as killer advice, the "big 3" are Freddy, Spirit, Hillbilly. Those seem to be the three that are considered to be best. Oni looks like he could be very good too. Really though, I'd advise to just play what looks fun to you and not care about your rank.
---
I‚Äôve gone and stood in corners of the map after being blinded repeatedly by survivors. Honestly it gets to a point where even when I think I can‚Äôt be blinded there is a crack in a piece of wood that I get hit out of. Thank god for Franklin‚Äôs
---
its their first iteration. sometimes the first iteration of something is the worst one. it will improve with time, but ye rift isnt that great.
---
I got an 80%, not bad
---
Yeah. It's nothing like Pig who legit just got a few random nerfs patch after patch until the undetectable buff.
---
95/110!
---
Imo, this is one of his upsides lmao. It lets Bubba get away with a lot of simple mindgames.
---
Not if you close the hatch however, it can only be opened to trigger the EGC but the AEGC is also triggered by closing the hatch so it won‚Äôt let you
---
I fully agree, if one thing about him needs changes it‚Äôs his add ons. I‚Äôd love a full overhaul, it still kinda seems obvious to me he was a little more rushed than other killers because he has Billy‚Äôs add ons.

Blood dragon gang

Why?
---
I've watched his Youtube videos for over a year now, and I do it because I enjoy his survivor videos rather than his killer videos. He plays survivor EVERY DAY, just like he plays Killer EVERY DAY.   
---
This isn't about him having a "killer mind". I don't know what you're talking about and, frankly, I don't think you know either.  
---
He is NOT a Killer Main. People who say this are those that don't watch his streams or his videos, and just sit around here making up bullshit memes about him.

Can I join? ;-;

Plus they figured since ya can‚Äôt do shit with the pig anyway, let‚Äôs throw in a toolbox and now you can even fix gens with the survivors

Idk man, have you seen tru3 playing Wraith? He really is just Ghostface's invisible brother
---
upvote because thats hilarious, but I still think that you should need to take it off to get hatch if the doors dont kill
---
And plays the game 25/9.
---
See? B tier lol

LOL. He got to rank 1 using no survivor perks. It's RIGHT THERE on Youtube, under "Dbd No Perks/addons Road to Rank 1".  
---
What are you even talking about????????????
---
Yes that‚Äôs why plague is one of the tallest killers so she can puke over objects easier

That's a pretty good idea. It's happened to me too, trying to do a challenge  you remember you had as a killer only to remember that you had chsnged to the survivor one

I didn't really have the motivation to continue it, but it was a productive use of waiting time at least. :/
---
Tru3 or angrypug
---
Yes, I'm saying if you mistime the perfect timing of the save and blind them without getting the stun with the flashlight you still get the archive done because it just requires the "survivor to be carried by the killer"
---
imagine getting this mad defending someone who doesn‚Äôt know you exist loool
---
For the deplete key challenge use broken key with blood amber, it worked for me u just use it up really fast at the start of match instead of needing to open hatch

One more thing, I don't normally make content on reddit, so watching this ping-pong between 10 and 13 likes with nobody making comments in any way is quite amusing.
---
I asked him recently on stream if he was enjoying dbd he said he still hated it and said anyone who doesn‚Äôt play it every once in awhile doesn‚Äôt play it because it‚Äôs fun
---
You have to be very dumb if you think that the dc penaltys are bad for the game
---
Look, I play legion pretty religiously as well, they're probably my favorite killer to play as. But we can't doubt the fact at this point that if you play legion, you're putting yourself at a severe disadvantage than if you had picked another killer to play as. He has no way to end chases, no efficient way to down people quickly other than his normal attack, and boosting his running speed literally doesn't change anything. Again, I love the legion, I just acknowledge the fact that they are in an awful state at the moment and it's been like that pretty much since they were released. It's pretty unfortunate.
---
If this wloud happen to me i wloudnt have any regrets to camp
---
This is why Kindred is an S tier solo perk.
---
PSA: You're on struggle and the last other Survivor is teabagging somewhere across the map. They're on the Hatch and can't rescue you. So stop struggling. You lose like 300 points and give them 7000. They'll appreciate it and will be more likely to do the same for others in the future. Spread the Good Word.
---
Tru3 bad, Otz and Zubat good. Updoots to the left please, I'm so original
---
Level 4 is already gonna be extremely hard. Not everyone is gonna be able to beat all the challengers and gating rift progress to only the people who are able to seems like a bad idea
---
was playing against a Michael the other night and the second to last survivor had been hooked, Michael was chasing me so I had no way of getting to her in time so I came to terms with the fact that I was gonna die. Michael ended up downing me and carried me around coldwind for a solid 3 minutes looking for the hatch, and then let me wiggle free and escape!
---
last night during a trial against a ghostface 2 of the players had disconnected and he ended up letting us remaining two farm with him and escape the trial. I felt so bad because he brought an ebony Mori with him (again, I was expecting/wouldn't have minded getting got at that point) but definitely appreciated being let go! 
---
dunno if either of these folks are on the sub but in case you are, thanks, I had a blast playing with y'all :) - a p3 Steve (PS4)
---
Sure but that doesn‚Äôt mean you need to BM. Unless you have seen all 3 survivors either, still not amazing to just camp. Just get a few people hooked before focusing on a few select. 
---
Do you enjoy sitting on a hook entering phase 2 because 2 people are hiding near the hook? It‚Äôs not fun, if you know someone is sat near the hook and you have their location, just go for them... don‚Äôt sit on a hook ‚Äúbecause someone else will unhook‚Äù
---
Pink is better
---
Probably would only work against killers with hollow bones like ghostface and legion. Dropping onto Oni would just injure you
---
Anytime I see blank is over party I hate it because cancel culture has destroyed so many lives

Keep playing him and If you have any questions you can PM and I might be able to answer most of them
---
just counterplay 4Head
---
he‚Äôs not the best killer, not even close
---
*PewDiePie intensifies*
---
Probably the most thought out suggestion I‚Äôve seen with perks that are actually reasonable and balanced. Plus I‚Äôve always wanted to see Alexa Woods as a survivor, and this killer could pair well with her.
---
Edit: Maybe Game Over Man could be for a TOTAL of 120/90/60 seconds to activate so you dont have to waste a full minute in a chase, but instead have multiple chases with a survivor that add up to 120/90/60 seconds.

I got it on shelter woods after 2 people dc‚Äôd. I placed all my traps at the exit gate in a line and kept walking into them. Eventually the 2 survivors came and did the same
---
I love doing this stuff
---
I really recommend watching Space Coconut's Hag guide to see how he breaks down all the usual criticisms that Hag gets. All the typical reasons people give for Hag being bad (flashlights and Urban Evasion being two of the big ones) he rebuttals with genuine points on how you can capitalize on it as Killer. He made that video back when Hag was trash tier due to her trap placement speed and he'd still consistently get 4ks with her.
---
Side note: watching old Hag gameplay with the 5 second long trap placement, 3 second long hooking animation, and pallet vacuums is painful lmao.
---
I specified that the killer knows ALL other survivors are hiding nearby in the post. This is what I‚Äôm referring to.
---
And I do indeed like watching over my hook victim instead of hunting someone down because it means I get that satisfying skull on the bottom left, but only when I have a reason to, like when people do nothing but wait for me to leave.
---
Also, of course I don‚Äôt like being on hook phase 2 because a killer is guarding me. If I know all my buds are sitting behind a rock waiting for killer to leave I‚Äôll end myself, they won‚Äôt save me anyway if they ain‚Äôt pressuring the killer

Man this happened to me last night when I was running BBQ and chili with a survivor pudding. I was so disappointed...
---
Brock Lesnar as the survivor pls.
---
Hes A tier already
---
It really isn't. It's nowhere near as bad as old Legion, because, as everyone has said, just don't stun him and he's as much of a non threat as ever. 
---
Besides, Legion's been pretty much the worst killer in the game for a while now. He needs SOMETHING to make him worth playing.
---
depends on which ones were talking about
---
the aforementioned iri head insta downs are bs if paired with infantry belt (and it usually is)
---
Exactly. Playing as Bubba *is* a mind game.
---
You use him, survivors think you‚Äôre a shit killer who just installed the game but then you fucking obliterate them in less than 10 minutes.
---
Not quite. Power capable of being disabled. Very loud.
---
Most Leatherface players are only playing him as their first Killer to unlock BBQ because streamers told them to do so.
---
To be fair I was also one of those Leatherface players. ~~Though my first Killer was Myers lmao~~
---
Yeah and for the situational challenges like EGC unhook you‚Äôll do it 100 times before you equip the challenge, then you‚Äôll never be able to do it.
---
Now he must die for us.
---
I dislike those who get 4Ks and still complain about how broken and unplayable x survivor mechanic is. You killed them all regardless. What more do you freaking want?
---
**Fun Fact**
---
With the legion nerf, they also buffed Borrowed time  and purple insta-heals. 
---
Enjoy this idea.
---
A little lower effort this week. Feeling a bit sick so excuse it if it's not too much of an issue, lol

What rank are you and what system are you playing on? I play both killer and Survivor I started playing 2 months ago not having played in like 2 years. Already hit red rank survivor and see Noed very little now and games I do like last night they still couldn't get a single person. As killer Rank 7 If I run noed its basically useless either doesn't activate and I basically only had 3 perks all game or it does activate and I get someone it gets cleansed and they save their the guy. Noed is literally a safeguard for low-mid ranks compatant survivors will still loop u or cleanse it after activates or it won't activate at all. I hate to be that guy too but people who are red rank and have trouble with Noed clearly got carried by playing with friends and aren't really deserving of that rank.
---
Ace as Nick would fit perfectly.

&gt;Took a break from the game
---
Still, going through the patch notes is always a good idea. You don't even have to read the whole thing, just the beginning of it, where they put the major changes.
---
Level up your main till you have 4 perks you can life with, then get teachables.
---
"just don't be bad, man"
---
I actually played Leatherface recently for a daily (first time in a *long* time) and he's *not terrible?* People really undervalue an on-demand instadown, and are too quick to dismiss his strengths with "he's low tier lol." Don't get me wrong he **is** low tier, but even low tier Killers can kill.
---
I think the main reason people don't want to give Leatherface a chance is that even in the best case scenario he's just an objectively worse version of Billy. He takes far longer to "instadown" than Billy due to the animation time of his chainsaw, and he can't use his chainsaw for mobility. There are a bunch of technical nitpicks with his power as well (it gets cancelled if you let go of it a second early, you slow down a ton while charging it, the hitbox is buggy as shit, Chili addons, etc. etc. etc.) but the reason no one really complains about them is that even with all those issues removed Leatherface would just be a worse Billy by every definition of the word.
---
I actually love playing against good Leatherfaces though. Instadowns are never fun but if a Leatherface genuinely outplays me I'm happy for him and happy I had a fun chase against a Killer who isn't Billy, Spirit, or Nurse. Leatherface's Mori is actually one of my favourites: it's super stylish and I hardly ever get to see it since no one plays Leatherface, and the few people that do don't even know what a Mori is. I'm never mad when I see a Leatherface Mori I'll be honest.
---
The legend says you can track survivors through the blood they leave on the ground while injured. 
---
As a colorblind, I am yet to see such thing in any map that isn't indoor.
---
Tell me about it ... BP farming is such a ass pain as a survivor as well. One time I ran 3 bp perks (WGLF, PT, NOLB, w Dead Hard) had fun but I was pressing objectives hard as hell.
---
Don't use windows, don't drop pallets, DON'T RUN GOD DAMN IT
---
Fellow protan returns once again to voice my support in our ongoing fight for a colourblind mode. The most common 'excuse' I have seen that non-colourblind players will "abuse" it. First of all, I seriously doubt it and secondly 8% of males suffer from some form of colour deficiency, you gonna tell us we're not allowed to see scratches etc because of that? Ridiculous.
---
It's nearly 2020, the game's been out for over three years, and we still don't have a colourblind mode...
---
Legion is incredibly easy to pip with. I'd be more amazed if he somehow manage to depip or safety pip with Legion. Pipping doesn't mean shit.
---
Same, i can never see bloodstains unless it‚Äôs an indoor map
---
I honestly think the game was really fun but it suffered from pretty much the same problems that DbD has (extreme lack of focus combined with an awful community) without the horror movie aesthetic and Michael Myers / Freddy Kruger / Jigsaw Reverse Bear Traps / Stranger Things Demogorgon to carry it. But hey at least Deathgarden had the Terminator... as a skin for a bottom tier character.
---
Have you ever seen Deathgarden's competitive community? I mean let's just laugh at the fact that a game that's in early access at best has a "competitive community": DG's competitive playerbase is the most elitist group I've ever seen. They'll mock you insistently if you use anything other than invisibility + sniper rifle. If you think the Survivor community and their "Self Care wastes time run Adrenawin + Free Win Strike + Balance Hard + Balanced Time" meta is boring you haven't seen DG's community.
---
And of course, what do we get in response to this combination? Another Legion nerf that makes deep wound even more useless. We won't get direct Legion buffs. That's not happening.
---
I finally got it last night after a few matches. In Lery's Memorial of all places. Used my ability once when a survivor hid behind that corner between a door where the exit is. Which makes it all more sweeter, Rank 1, going against SWF. Would have gotten a couple matches before, but I couldn't find the last survivor for the ONE hook I needed to get the iridescent emblem, she died one second before I finally found her.
---
It gave you a huge advantage for no added effort
---
You won't...
---
They are like skyrim sovngarde statues.

Just run No Mither and you practically halve the time you can exist in a trial.
---
Funny you say that, I‚Äôm working on three killers right now and plan to do a few survivors next! Be on the look out :)
---
Just close the game and restore licenses
---
Ok thanks. Need to look at the changes again.
---
Sounds like someone who's never seen a 4k
---
:D
---
Ok describe him yourself then because this is spot on
---
But that's literally what I talked about in the post...
---
I feel like Flip Flop fits into anti slug build a lot better than Unbreakable. When you consider all the perk synergy between Flip Flop, Unbreakable, Tenacity, Boil Over, Sabo in general, and the new perk Breakout, it can be really useful.
---
Tyde either doesn't see it's potential, or is grading perks on their individual use in which case the tier list is still dumb somehow thinking Dance With Me is an A tier perk on its own
---
The problem with his opinion is that he flat out refuses to change it, as perfectly exemplified by his "the community has been proven wrong / opinions can't be wrong" tweet. And in regards to funding his house I'm sure he could still get enough money to pay the bills playing different games. And if he can't well... maybe it's not because people only care about DbD content from him? Maybe it's because he's a narcissistic asshole who refuses to take any criticism due to his massive superiority complex?
---
Sounds cool!
---
And that‚Äôs just for now, if you and others reading this have any requests for Dbd or maybe even something else, just message me and I‚Äôll see what I can do :)
---
Here we go again
---
i did this once and Ash won with 7 kills lmao
---
They have been out for like 6 days
---
The thing is spirit has a timer on it and wraith can use it as he wishes??Using phasing as a means of mobility is very ineffective if you don't use addons that add movement speed/charge time.
---
Wack
---
lol i guess dweet found a way over the walls without claudette her help xD
---
But then they take the bullet for ya
---
Bill - Bill
---
I understand it's a toxic thing to do, but if I need  a late hook and sacrifice to get max bloodpoints is the only time outside of EGC tome challenges that I would do that.
---
That 32,000 still feels like an accomplishment, even now.  And especially with BBQ
---
Man that new survivor cosmetic looks tree-refic!
---
Feels like that mouse has done that before. Either way, all you can do is watch and go "Well I suppose that little fucker deserved to live."
---
Most people see prestiging as a waste of bloodpoints. I did all my survivors to 50 prestiged ace to 3 and kept leveling him for all the perks. Now i'm just prestiging people to 3 while playing ace but that's just how i'm doing it.
---
It might be, but that‚Äôs his problem. I don‚Äôt bother with his videos anymore. But I bet DBD is his biggest money maker so that‚Äôs why he sticks with the game. If he wants to stay with the game then he needs to chill out and be less pessimistic.
---
can u imagine the faces the voice actor was doing while they were recording this.
---
I'd drop some points into whichever survivor you're playing until you get a handful of bearable perks, then focus your killers up
---
Play a lot and do both
---
95/110 Bruh
---
All killers have 2 purple and 1 green perk (at tier 3) for demo its mindbreaker, Cruel Limits ame surge is the green one. Its always been this way
---
Definitely a SWF, would've been nice to know their ranks beforehand though.
---
And what color are they at for tier 2? (The one in the picture)
---
David, Bill and Meg. These guys seem like the hero type so they can distract the killer and save me when needed, and if worst comes to worst they can die for me to live.
---
They are purple for 2 and 3
---
Yellow perks are green for 2 and 3
---
Not a surprise the killers and survivors dont have a chance againts the choosen one
---
I do my partner's killer challenges for him. This is him.
---
I did my part
---
1 day ago i literally made a steve move to the next dimension when i knocked him in the killer shack where i could still hear his voice but his body was nowhere near to be found :xD &gt;!he bleed out and his teamates told me in the end game chat he was on the roof of the shack the entire time lmao!&lt;
---
It isn't S tier solo perk. 
---
One game, I was hooked in basement and I had one friend in-game ith me. This Meg sandbagged him against the Spirit, and this Ace did a gen right above me as of to insult me. I died on first hook WITH Kindred. Why should I be punished over a pip for the mistakes of other survivors? &gt;:(
---
funny story, its servers are getting shutdown.
---
they where broken, they are still good just healthier for the game
---
If you're going to use cosmetics anyways there's no need to get the prestige if you won't ever use the bloody clothes. Yes you get better things blah blah blah but it's not worth it in the end.
---
Baby yoda is the entity encouraging the killers
---
Every time I‚Äôve watched True he seems like a guy who gets upset at the unbalance of the game ‚Äî especially related to strengths of survivors. Anytime he mentions it, he‚Äôll get a little too caught up in some of the negative comments in chat. This usually leads to him ranting about the state of the game. He comes across like everyone‚Äôs out to get him, but I think it‚Äôs negativity in his chat (and posts like this) that influence his negative attitude the most. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs amazing or anything, but I haven‚Äôt seen anything from him that warrants this level of mockery from the game‚Äôs Reddit community.
---
I am not a daily watcher nor a big fan by any means. So I‚Äôm pretty unbiased.
---
Yup yup.  I member buying bubba just for bbq.  Got him to level 11 aaaandd bbq showed up in the shrine.  I bought that and haven't touched bubba since. 
---
I pretty much dumped all my BP into clown, nurse, hag, pig , spirit and freddy to get their teachables.  Well I do use pig, hag and freddy a lot as is.  
---
Slowly working on some survivors finally.
---
Nobody is asking for blood to be changed, just the bright red glowing auras of gens/survivors/hexes and scratch marks, the stuff you're _supposed_ to be able to see easily and clearly
---
I was waiting in queue for so long last night that the game was pairing me with green rank killers. I'm rank 2. 
---
The match making system is abysmal right now.
---
You can turn off the watermark if you want
---
If pig could grab while crouched she would be a ton better
---
When I last had it, it was green at tier 2
---
I can live without blood but I can't continue without scratches. I barely play because of it. There's no excuse to not have the option to change the scratches to blue. Protans like myself are red weak, and hey-ho scratches are red...
---
I never said it was
---
Actually yes it does, have you eve tried it?
---
Nice
---
No it doesn‚Äôt because shadowborn maxes it out so monitor does nothing
---
Find it! Please?
---
Oh. Guess they changed it.
---
It looks like a silhouette
---
Scratches, gen auras, hex auras, survivor auras with BBQ/I'm All Ears/etc, hook auras when carrying, on top of other things. Which would be find if they didn't choose oranges, greens, reds and browns for 95% of aura colors so they blend in unless you mush your face into a rock or a white wall.
---
I've had this game for 2 years and I haven't played a single game as billy.  Just seems so boring.   
---
I'm liking oni so far though but hes not easy.  At least compared to some other killers.
---
Idk I feel like it‚Äôs already more organized then the way you suggested
---
Why would everyone go down there lol
---
Also you should never rev at a pallet unless you‚Äôre going to go through past the pallet with it.
---
Obviously this worked out for you, but just in general!
---
Took the quiz, I like the complexity of it. Do have one question though. Wouldn't artifact be considered the rarest of rares as currently there is only one person with the panda.tv gold shirt in the game? I thought that was considered "artifact" as only one exists.
---
Yeah I just made it up.
---
I used to play the game and i did enjoy it. Kyfs was fun with my buddies but its so buggy and i didn't feel like anything got fixed so i stopped. I don't care if anything is fixed still won't ever play it.
---
I would love the pretty woman mask with the suit
---
No perks, just be a jerk and win the game with minimal effort
---
The "rarer drops" increase is .5% per prestige
---
Ring ring ring,
---
The entity is calling!
---
Sweet! Look forward to more memes using this format.
---
Ideally I'd like a search box where you can filter by perk name (or description?)
---
Especially if you don't know if you have a perk or at what level the current system can be annoying
---
Colorblind mode is good but not an FOV slider
---
Yeah I know the pallet thing, but the rest of them were throwing pallets down super early so I figured Bill would likewise
---
If I‚Äôm playing killer and I can tell a player is very new, I go easy on them. Just don‚Äôt kill them immediately, let them at least try and play the game first.
---
Nah, a smaller streamer from my country
---
Monitor also increase your FOV. Just not as much as shadowborn.
---
Gotta be honest, the last 5 games I've played they all let me die on my first hook. I hate when I'm with a swf group.
---
Wait times are fucked huh
---
Pretend to farm then hit them with the noed
---
Feng and Meg to gen rush with me,  then maybe Nea or Yui to run the killer.  
---
  
---
1. I would be excited to see Ash, since he's a God Slayer, and Ace would hopefully rub off a little bit of his luck on me.  
---
2. In reality I would get a Dwight a Claudette and a Bill, the prior 2 who wouldnt do gens bc theyre hiding and the latter who is extremely unpredictable.  Send help.  
---
3. I think the team I picked would be best, since their is 3 gennies and a runner.  We'd get out real quick.  Worst case Feng could run for a bit while Meg sprints for the unhook on Nea.  
---
Good luck in the *real* fog
---
SB, fixated, inner strength, spine chill.
---
The pig is too powerful. Do you know how main times I dont pip up because of her? I keep only safety pipping EVERYTIME!!! We get all the gens done leave and still no pip! Her perks are too powerful to deny pip......
---
/s
---
I feel your pain
---
I disagree. Killer is easy as shit. Rank 1 killer playing as Legion (someone this subreddit like to call useless and trash) and I‚Äôm consistently getting 4k games almost every time. Either that or 3k and someone hatch escapes. My first game as Oni yesterday got a 4k in red rank.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse + Whispers to know where people are and then crouch to get the drop on them, or no whispers.
---
Remember when this last year was supposed to focus on optimization and QOL, i remember.
---
oh welp...
---
Just skip it man, and do it on rank reset.
---
You still have time to go back later and complete it.
---
Clever little bastard
---
Never thinked of that! :D
---
You just got outplayed 9head
---
Thundersnail!
---
Yeah just played a game and it happened to me. I died in like the first 5 mins of the match
---
What? I honestly can't even understand the point you are making with this post. If it makes you feel better to say stuff like that please go ahead, I only want everyone to have a good time. That said, I really can't see what point you are making here.
---
There's a rank 5 among the survivors, they were most likely together. Matchmaking uses the lowest rank in the party.
---
what was the nerf? haven't played in a while?
---
First the hunger games and next THE.....
---
next hunger games
---
I play immersed so I have empathy, spine chill, dark sense and self care
---
I can‚Äôt skip it because the other killer challenges are done and in a few days i‚Äôm moving houses so won‚Äôt really have time to complete it then.
---
How would that prevent OP from going back? It would waste the pallet and the whole team still would have been downed. 2 people going down for the save was idiotic
---
I used to play both killer and survivor and tbh i never really had a issue going against them as a killer.
---
I don't think my viewpoint is skewed, I purposely watched his older stream videos and I identify that he played nurse alot in the early days because she was the only killer who could really go against sub par Survivors, and he's also ultra competitive so playing Survivor didn't appeal to him as much because it was considerably easier (and still is) but that doesn't mean he MAINS killer because he plays both sides equally now, and constantly points out bs on both sides. But people don't want to hear that part, they want to hear the part where someone is looping him at a loop with 100% visibility and he can't physically get them, then gives up on chase, and points it out at him complaining, rushes to Reddit to say what a toxic streamer he is, then continues watching the old ochido videos of groups of Survivors bullying a killer. Whether you like his ego or not, he says things, and then provides video evidence of those things he claims. He's never toxic to who he's vsing, even when they're being toxic to him. I find it quite ironic how you post something claiming he's a killer main on a post about when he's given a SURVIVOR build, with a weak SURVIVOR perk, complaining about how it's a BAD perk. But you do you I guess.
---
The hero we don't deserve.
---
I unsubscribed from him recently.
---
Oni is fun.
---
Deep wound not going down in terror radius -&gt; deep wound not going down when sprinting or mending.
---
Same. Got 3x Sanctum Wrath in a row. Claudettes and Iron Will. I was Legion so I just used Killer Instinct GOT YA B\*\*
---
I just had a hag down everyone in the basement in the first 30 seconds and put literally 80,000 traps there. I don‚Äôt have borrowed time. It went as expected. I blame my teammates mostly but the hag was very over zealous ü§ß
---
Kinda wanna experience this. Just once tho
---
Spine chill, lithe, head on, quick and quiet or spine chill, inner strength, sprint burst, stake out. these are my two main builds that do fairly well for me at rank 5/4 :)
---
Right before you get hit, you can see yourself rubber band back to the window. Outplayed tbh.
---
I know it‚Äôs old and overused, but it‚Äôs my favorite format so have an updoot
---
I feel like this game could be scarier. That Last Year game looks pretty scary
---
"Your thick blood coagulates practically instantly."
---
"You don't leave pools of Blood"
---
Works thematically for me
---
No mither should stop blood orbs. When Ono came out I threw it on thinking I was so smart. Two seconds into my first game against Oni i realized the devs missed an opportunity to make it actually usable
---
I get that Leatherface isn't the best killer out there (still pretty strong imo just because he has an easy to control instadown but that's irrelevant), but why do they have to have scummy builds almost 100% of the time?
---
That would give them a good use, yes, But then they'd have to make sloppy butcher make survivors drop more blood orbs dont you think?, or does it already do that?
---
Yeah. I guess so.
---
Love your art style!

I know and useally i capatilize massively on their over altruism but right now i just can‚Äôt do it. They‚Äôll just go destroy noed (if i even get it at all) and come rushing in to save their teammates, there‚Äôs honestly nothing i can do about it. If it were purple rank (my rank i‚Äôm at btw) then maybe i could go against some survivors without communication and MAYBE complete the challenge. But since i‚Äôm playing against swf of WAY higher rank i can‚Äôt do anything to stop the rescue.
---
Prestige whoever you want. It doesn't matter.
---
The worst part is when you see two people working on a gen and the Killer is chasing the obsession so they KNOW no one is coming. If I go to second state on first hook I just die tbh. I'm not spending another minute waiting.
---
There's no way the killer's hitbox is big enough to completely block the basement stairs. And honestly, like others said she was basically camping so you weren't getting rescued anyway.
---
Think about it, you spend around 30+ secs in a single chase, you finally get them down and then someone runs over and deletes all of your progress without any skill needed, even in the best situations you will loose at least one gen from it
---
But... He was playing killer? Or *survivor*?
---
Power -&gt; frenzy -&gt; catch up -&gt; cancel power -&gt; regular hit
---
That‚Äôs why you gotta get to red ranks or play SWF
---
this happened to me once but i had a key and wiggled out
---
I agree and disagree. A good survivor doesnt just sit on gens and bs their way through a game. Just like how good killers dont just see someone and hit them. Assuming that they're a good player, they're obviously going to do more than that. HOWEVER, yes I see what you're talking about in purple and green ranks. Personally I dont find having to pay attention a disadvantage whatsoever. You see killer mains on twitch do it for hours and hours at a time. It's not that hard after you do it for a while.
---
He's entitled to his opinion, but when he makes it public and opens it up for discussion, he should expect people to disagree. Especially when he's saying Hag is one of the worst killers, Clown is like near top tier, Spirit and Bubba are both B tier, and so forth you would expect people to question it.
---
His response to people's criticism is whats off putting, he has the whole holier than though attitude and sounds like a condescending douche whenever talking to someone with difference in opinion. I commented on his videos semi often and always got responses like this because I didn't agree with him.
---
The epitome of this attitude is the podcast with The King where they're discussing DCing and if it's ok to do or not. I'm personally against it and so was Tyde, but the way he talked about it literally made me disagree with him cuz of how much of an ass he sounded like.
---
Have you guys tried the combo sloppy butcher+bloodhound? The blood glows and stays for way longer so even if there is tall grass you can make an effort to track via blood(don't know how it works for color blind people, sorry if it doesn't do anything for you but if it works it sounds like a must have perk to play properly)
---
Most of my experiences are they Urban Evade away &amp; I have to take the aggro from the killer D:
---
I agree. There have been many good suggestions for secondary objectives. Maybe bhvr could have a community contest to see who can come up with the best idea. I see people saying it would make the game harder for low ranks but lets be honest, if people are allergic to gens and just ue around the map it doesnt matter if gens take 40 sec to get done, they still wouldnt do them.
---
The challenge only requires you to load NOED. It doesn't require you to get use out of it. Even if all five totems are cleansed you get the challenge.
---
The easiest way to get this challenge would be to make damned sure to hook every survivor twice so that there are no escapes once you get an endgame hook. Use your best killer, the one you can guarantee hits and downs with, and keep at it and eventually you'll get it.
---
Console health is abysmal right now. 
---
People have always complained about window hits but since the last two patches is the only time window hits have seemed actually bad. And they are really bad right now 
---
But killer hit registry is also terrible right now. In the last couple days I‚Äôve slammed a Claude with my club and no hit registered. Her character model was literally going through the club.
---
Then I had this clueless Feng who had no idea I was right there and my hatchet went literally through her head. No hit.
---
I‚Äôve had a couple instances where people slow vault and no hit registers 
---
That‚Äôs just a couple examples 
---
BHVR needs to address this. In addition there‚Äôs this ongoing bug that crashes the game usually at the end.
---
for my play style and queuing solo I‚Äôve found that kindred, dark sense, lithe, and adrenaline works well. i‚Äôm working on getting the quick and quiet teachable and may end up switching that one in instead of adrenaline
---
I dislike camping, bu unfortunately, lot of survivors feed into it when killers do so it‚Äôs ‚Äúviable‚Äù to them
---
I have enough time to finish this totem 
---
Aaaaand they're gone.
---
That could possible work (with rng on my side too) might give that a shot but i don‚Äôt think it will be for today or i just might smash my monitor for the first time in my life..
---
That too.  The farthest I've got in ranking is 9.  I think I could get into the purples no problem, I just don't really have the time.  Good point though
---
You over here making concept art while I‚Äôm scratching my balls between lobbies . True artistry
---
Agreed Kindred is S tier solo perk since the buffs
---
BeCaUsE yOu LeT tHe KiLlEr GeT yOu LoL
---
Here wait Let me get this totem. Oh wait here's a chest. Wow a gen half way let me finish this real quick.
---
Shitpost
---
But for the subreddit it's just a blessing üòâüòâ
---
With his chainsaw.
---
Still not even close to enough time. The basement was literally right behind him
---
I main killer but play survivor with friends. I would say that killer requires more skill, attention and stress, but if you know what you're doing you're more often gonna get a good result. Survivor is less stressful completely but you're less likely to escape. Certainly, as a killer you need to be constantly paying attention, whereas being a survivor means you can spread the stress. And as survivor there's not much to 'do'. You'll either have a longer chase or a shorter chase but against a good killer you're going down.

And when i try to post this shit bots block it and say its unrelated to dead by dayilight fuck this shit
---
As for me as well üòÖ
---
Max fov+monitor or shadow born would be exploited if that happened, but i don't know if it would worth it to sacrifice a perk for that alone knowing there are others more impactful for playstyle, still it would be a gamechanger.
---
Yup
---
I guess nobody got it lol
---
I got an 83%
---
I know it doesn‚Äôt but i helps a ton when you don‚Äôt have to hit them twice in a chase to get them down. Hooking them twice is what i‚Äôve consistently been trying but the moment i‚Äôll finish one of them all the rest of them just leave because there‚Äôs absolutely no reason to stay.. every survivor knowing what you‚Äôre trying to do sure doesn‚Äôt help the big picture at all.
---
I agree
---
They‚Äôre being sarcastic
---
I love this haha
---
When I first read lucky break I instantly thought ‚Äúoh yeah this‚Äôll counter the oni‚Äôs blood orbs‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm sad because just like no mither, it definitely should stop the orbs
---
Hey man you seem upset, almost like you care about this. Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have posted a comment
---
No. It already takes an insanely long time to get your power going as it is since they nerfed that aspect of his power 
---
This would just make him worse on console than he already is
---
Your Freddy example is bad because they literally removed that aspect because it was broken
---
Your clown/doc example is bad because those aspects of their power isn‚Äôt even the viable part, especially for clown
---
You‚Äôre literally asking for perks to not just counter a power, but deny it entirely 
---
No
---
That just happened to me
---
Reddit‚Äôs new update added watermarks to these images when you save them
---
Breaking a pallet with a chainsaw takes longer than kicking the pallet unless he's running charge add-ons, I wasn't paying attention whether he was or not.
---
I feel it was particularly bad the last couple of days: I'm a lvl 9-10 killer (if I mostly play the strong ones and it is my best rank ever achieved) and I consistently got matched with nothing but 5-6 purple ranks.
---
I get that is considered normal matchmaking, but I feel the difference in skill is just too big. I get shit on every game with this matchmaking, so let's not pretend it is fair
---
 Went into a match and had 2 people DC as soon as they were hooked (one of them a Twitch streamer). We were facing Leatherface.
---
 Killer just starts ignoring us as the 2 of us remaining run around farming and gen-popping, then gets involved by letting us pallet-slap him and escape his grasp. Dude lets us escape and even apologized after the match for the 2 that left.
---
 We need more players like this.
---
Yeah you can't save until the pick up animation is completely over, basically making it impossible to flashlight save from a competent killer. Flashlight op tho.
---
Julie=blue hair Susie=pink hair just so you know...not the same person
---
Deliverance is kind of gimmicky though, it requires a safe unhook first so that means you can't be the first one hooked (it feels like I am the first one found whenever I run it) and if you do get the opportunity to use it, the majority of the time it would be better to let your teammate unhook you instead because you can't be healed and they ran half way across the map to get you.
---
It was almost definitely not something they intended when they made the perk. Not saying Legion doesn‚Äôt deserve some love, but giving him a way to guarantee a down with absolutely no counterplay is not the way to do it. And no, ‚ÄúDONT STUN HIM‚Äù isn‚Äôt counterplay.
---
Love getting double discordance as soon as the game starts, everyone gets crap some time‚Äôs.
---
The way I started was as killer. Played my main to 50 while playing others. I‚Äôd play my main to get BP and out the killer I wanted to play to level 15 for 4 perks. 
---
When I started playing survivor (rank 5 rn) I started as David for Dead Hard, got all his teachable then started playing Meg for Adrenaline, bought DS in the store quite a while ago, then played Bill for BT so I had a meta load out to always rock with. Now I‚Äôm leveling up Nancy for Inner Strength while playing w my meta perks, and putting the BP I get into Nancy. Since she only has a few more levels I‚Äôm branching out and starting to play others who‚Äôs perks are more for fun now, and I have all the meta teachables so I can try hard or play for fun with the new survivors.
---
oh I know, I just couldnt find an example with just colorblind settings
---
Claudette players were talking to you cunts
---
Lol nicely played.  I'm genuinely surprised it took this long for someone to hit me with this comment.
---
My absolute favorite pig build is Pop goes the weasel, corrupt intervention, discordance and bbq or nurses. Favorite addons are the yellow crate thing with an extra trap and combat straps. I double pip almost ever game and I‚Äôm rank 6 right now so it works pretty well for me
---
I haven't played in 2 days cuz I've wanted a break from the Oni, but yeah, there's been a lot of DCing. I think it's because there was rumours the DCing bans were coming to console, but now it's confirmed they aren't on console and people aren't scared anymore.
---
I guess the nerfs were enough for most people to stop playing Spirit. I‚Äôve only seen her twice this update.
---
Its not a disadvantage, it requires more effort, which is the point I'm making. Killer is "harder" than survivor because it requires more effort. If you know someone else is getting chased, as a survivor, you have free reign to do whatever objective you want. But you don't have that luxury as killer. During chases, you have to think about how much time this survivor is wasting, which gens are the others on, is the loop they're at worth your time.
---

---
Yeah, must be then.
---
The killer has so many tools lmaoo what do you mean. Legion has an add on that shows him which generators are being worked on. Its honestly easy knowing where they are that isn‚Äôt an issue.
---
Played a game with this perk, thought it was useless til I got one of the last two survivors downed. Last guy attempted to bodyblock, and finally, I had the chance to use it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Survivors are the powerhouse of the game because of the maps and how fast gens can be done
---
I had some fun with Deathgarden but streaming it was awful. Wed have 5 people waiting for a match and it would take forever then when we got in we would get kicked or all end up in different lobbies. It was so much dead air that we just stopped playing it. I would have liked to see it continue but when the most basic matchmaking didnt work it was a bunch of waiting around.
---
I thought legion was slow and meh
---
Now his vaults and running feels more normal
---
I like it, can't please the meme though
---
Also, I've barely gotten to play against the oni. I keep getting nurse, and trapper.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs supposed to be orange to yellow text for this specific template. If it isn‚Äôt it feels off.
---
Also I‚Äôm not downloading that crap. I‚Äôm on my phone, I have all I need, mematic and a way to remove the watermark without spending money, and meme maker for adding in cut out imagery.
---
I have a gaming mouse and switched it to one of my extra buttons. I hit more accurate skill checks that way too. But if someone is playing on controller, I can totally understand how annoying the struggle button would be.
---
Thats my preference but Myers is still a solid choice. At the end of the day who looks cooler to you. Play any killer long enough and they are viable

I play PC with a gaming mouse, I might have to try and switch it up if it can help with the cramps, I put it on F for the fun of it, but avoiding cramps is probably better
---
This is a whole ass MOOD
---
The center of the last one looks like shirtless David, atleast for me lol
---
You putting in the effort is appreciated, and I hope you feel better! These are not big things to ask of a game company, and yet we‚Äôre still lacking, so I‚Äôm glad people are pointing out the problems to BHVR regularly
---
There was a survey while ago that asked if we wanted this,  I voted that I wanted it for other people :/ but I guess others didn't

I‚Äôm a Legion main too, but I would really just rather a full rework on their power, Freddy style. Feral Frenzy isn‚Äôt going to work. Ever. It‚Äôs just not feasible to balance.
---
Every time I kicked a generator and didn't get stuck....
---
You keep hollering about a nerf but every oni I‚Äôve played against has gotten and spammed his power consistently chasing an injured survivor for a few seconds. 
---
But you also act like IF lucky break was changed around to effect the way blood orbs drop, that the killer couldn‚Äôt just wait for the duration to end or find another survivor. 
---
You‚Äôre talking entirely hypothetical and frankly unreal situations. 
---
‚ÄúOh damn this survivor I hit just happened to have lucky break? Guess I‚Äôll just pick my nose for 120 seconds while I get gen rushed so I can get my power instead of just finding another survivor.‚Äù
---
Oh you right, forgive my ignoranceüòé
---
Pretty sure he‚Äôs got mental issues . I heard him say once ‚Äúdon‚Äôt try to control me because I‚Äôm gonna rebel‚Äù in reply to someone making a genuine suggestion to better his build . Dudes a clown who lives in his own world , and when you burst his bubble of that fragile reality he loses it. I.e banning you .
---
HEY NOW, YOUR A KILLER
---
So youre flexing about being a toxic assole?
---
It‚Äôs all good
---
Yeah... you see this is either low ranks who don‚Äôt know any better, or your three other teammates are altruistic swf. Either way, feels bad. 
---
Killers will also be penalized for camping in terms of emblem and bp if no survivor is around as they‚Äôre camping. So if the killer doesn‚Äôt walk away a certain amount of meters (I forget how much) after 10sec of hooking someone - penalized. If there are survivors by the hooked survivor, no penalty. Therefore, camping is only rewarded if you, the survivor, reward it.
---
From the killer POV, camping is bad unless the player was toxic all match and I‚Äôm petty as heck, or you know there‚Äôs survivors around in which you still shouldn‚Äôt camp but do what‚Äôs called soft patrol - go around to kick the nearest gen, destroy pallets, walk around to see if you can find that nearby survivor you hear, etc. Every second in dbd counts for the killer even more so than survivors because it‚Äôs a 4v1 game. So killers who camp with no survivors around are not good killers to begin with.
---
It's a joke lmao
---
I read about what the statues do, but I hardly notice them because I am too busy getting tunneled or face camped and even if I wasn't busy, I wouldn't be able to see it because the map is so dark.
---
I recommend to NOT drink that wine.
---
Another over used meme
---
I'm not talking specific killers with specific add ons. The killer ROLE requires you keep in mind and out pace four other people, while survivors need only keep track of one. It requires more effort and focus to play as a killer rather than a survivor.
---
I think you're mistaking British for English, Great Britain consists of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland so people from all of those could be considered British.
---
Then again i don't know why i'm arguing this with someone who thought a northern English accent was Irish.
---
Hey r/Deadbydaylight, PICK UP THE PHONE!
---
I agree with you on that. Legion needs a rework, but until then I'd rather have some benefit to playing them.
---
Wrong
---
Balanced landiiiing
---
Solo survivor is definitely on par with killer as far as difficulty goes. SWF, while INFINITELY more fun, is a lot easier than both.
---
In my own opinion artifact should be rarer than event. Though the loadout sytem always puts the event items first, even though you can purchase a lot of event items from the store as where artifact items are actually extremely rare and only a couple hundred people have artifact items. Artifact items became a thing ever since the streamer skins became part of the charity case. So people who got the streamer skins "legit" would have a way to tell that they have the original one instead of the charity case one.
---
I honestly don't know about [panda.tv](https://panda.tv) but I guess they are artifact rarity because of how they are obtained. I wrote after the question that I used the loadout order for the rarity incase people would get confused as you can argue over how rare certain rarities are. But I defintely agree artifacts should be the rarest. Same for legacy skins that are only "very rare" even though nobody can obtain these anymore where as some ultra rare skins still can.
---
TL;DR. The ingame order puts event items first so I used this system as you can't really argue about it.
---
They need to at least address latency, though I‚Äôm not sure if they have yet
---
Precisely my point of reference when I posted that
---
He said fuck it and got a welding mask. Try and blind him now.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about the part of Oni's power that breaks matchmaking. Whoops, my bad
---
I got very lucky and had someone hooked in basement, slugged, opened exit gate, the hooked the other one. It was first game on.
---
Ahh.
---
We already got a "rework" that amounted to nothing but massive nerfs and a slight movement speed buff. At this point they're just incompetent and lazy.
---
I guess so but I just don‚Äôt see piping as a win. That‚Äôs just me. Maybe that‚Äôs why I get so many 4ks on red rank survivors on console. If you‚Äôre dying you‚Äôre losing in my eyes.
---
Susie is both the girl with pink hair and the girl with blue hair Jesus I can‚Äôt with you smh Julies hair isn‚Äôt even visible LOL  literally a simple google search of Julie from dbd could tell you that
---
Pig is literally fine, I don't understand this circlejerk about her being bad
---
He looks like a robot
---
You just said you need more time to develop counterplay
---
He did actually tell that when blood warden was active
---
I mean when I play survivor I‚Äôm usually designated distraction so I‚Äôm definitely not just pressing right click. I think of it as playing a game of chess, trying to predict what the other person will do and counteract it. Trying to be resourceful while not getting myself killed in the process. Trying to run while also not going near anybody on gens it‚Äôs a lot about thinking on the go. Not relenting trying to get around whatever killer you‚Äôre playing, if I accidentally run into a beat trap I‚Äôve thrown the game because that‚Äôs me down and my team aren‚Äôt (usually) as strong at distraction (I usually end up getting camped anyway though rip). When I play killer it‚Äôs basically doing the same game of chess except trying to trick the other person as opposed to predicting them. I‚Äôd say both roles are pretty equally difficult from my stand point however I can see how somebody who plays survivor differently to me might have a different opinion.
---
Lol you can go up in rank and still die, so i dont see how that's a loss. Its the overall game we play for the entity.
---
Aw shit, here we go again
---
I'm playing (well trying to at least) on PS4 right now and I keep being disconnected from the host in the loading screen.
---
So that you can dodge and make survivor queues even longer than they already are.
---
Gray is the Entity and Daniel Dickens is the Clown and absolutely nothing you say will convince me otherwise.
---
Amazing. Quality content. 
---
Meanwhile my friends thrive off my screams of fear when playing against stealth killers.
---
I wouldn't mind a Freddy or Hillbilly at this point. Better than all the camping ghostfaces I run into.
---
I chainsawed a pallet as hillbilly yesterday while a Jake was slow vaulting it and it didn't even hurt him.
---
It‚Äôs called struggle for a reason. This game is very sensory based, sorry it just doesn‚Äôt fit for everyone.
---
690 right now üëèüèª
---
In my personal opinion, ranking in games should only be by your rank color. (Ex: If your rank color is green, you should only be playing with green ranks in your match)
---
Wait how long has it been out? I just started it a night ago and love it. I main killer Doc and SO FAR had 1 survivor escape me out of 9 games as Doctor. 
---
I can wait to level him up some more, I am already running into survivors with pruple perks to my 3 green now. And starting to see people try to bait me to let others fix gens. 
---
Love the game!
---
You‚Äôre right, I said it wrong. I meant that there are counterplays just like any other killer like looping, but there aren‚Äôt any strats against him specifically
---
Not stunning Legion is the definition of how to play in a way that counters that build. This is yet another massive killer nerf that happened because survivors got mildly irritated that pallets were slightly less safe against a bad killer.
---
I noticed i got better as both survivor and killer and it made me happy.
---
part of me thinks they should remove the hook timer(atleast for the first hook) but also remove the escape attempts or move them ti the second hook and get rid of the annoying button mash you have to do. it would help fix camping the hook as well as not punishing someone as hard for bad randos. this might cause some unintended problems balance wise but i can't think of any rn
---
And people say Oni has no counterplay. Like lmfao just hide in a tree 4head.
---
Hail Thuuri.
---
Ok so yeah just looked and saw and her hair isn't visible my bad you guys are right. I always thought that mask and outfit was Frank and that the two girls' hair was exposed. I was wrong so sorry bout that!
---
Flair checks out
---
Killer is about more than chasing one person, its about knowing where all four of the survivors are and out-playing them all. Survivor is about doing objectives while keeping track of one person. Its definitely harder on killer, generally speaking.
---
This title sounds oddly specific
---
Meg.
---
Jeff with a diaper... Would buy that 100%
---
Same thing happened to me with the Oni, and it didnt fix its self until I hit someone but according to my friends (i was in kill your friends) i was moving the whole time.
---
I stream to mixer, the last 3 weeks and I like it. Just started DbD and love maiming Killer Doc.
---
Attack of the clones Geonosis vibes
---
Girl I‚Äôm sorry but frank doesn‚Äôt have breasts LOL but there really should be a skin where Julie has her hair out
---
I never said we shouldn‚Äôt have color blind options or how they can be abused (example in a moment though). I only pointed out that if someone thinks people won‚Äôt abuse things (if a way is found) that they are absolutely wrong. So don‚Äôt act as though I said something I didn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre calling  ‚Äúbollocks‚Äù on a true statement. 
---
But since you want an example:
---
For instance, settings are important. If you can set your scratch mark colors to be different from aura colors and generator colors and ECG ground colors as the killer, it WILL make it a lot easier for not colorblind individuals. If the setting is similar to now where all the colors are the same (red in this case, but let‚Äôs say blue as an example) then that‚Äôs fine since they‚Äôre all the same, and it means when colors overlap and are SUPPOSED to be hard to see, that they‚Äôll blend just as they do now. 
---
Though I doubt the devs want blue blood to become a thing. Still, brightness is a concern. They‚Äôll need to ensure any color options are only as brights and visible as they are now to those who can see the red. Otherwise killers will set everything to be bright so they‚Äôll never miss anything. Same for survivors too tbh.

potentially yes, but timing isnt too easy, and they have to go up the stairs a couple times, if the miss

Thanks for taking me simply saying lucky break should effect blood orbs as a personal attack. I get it, you‚Äôre a hardcore oni player ‚ÄúTHE ONI IS TOTALLY BALANCED YALL JUST GOTTA GET GUD‚Äù

Rename him to The Centurion

Legate is similar to Legion people will whine about it

Definitely doing that.

oh my god

If you're playing on PC and have a mouse with infinite scroll, rebind struggle to MWheel down and unlock your scroll wheel when you get to struggle phase, no more mashing, just occasionally respinning your scroll wheel

I saved it thats why it appeared thanksüñí

holy shit what even are you

you think Oni is OP

oh my fucking god

Lul sorry

*Most*, maybe. Off the top of my head, Myers has three purples.
---
It's not like the person standing there is doing gens anyway..
---
Dead by daylight is bad, every other game that tries to do what it does is worse.
---
And that something I‚Äôm fine with. It‚Äôs just like I was saying earlier, someone said that they didn‚Äôt believe people would exploit stuff in the game, and I‚Äôm pointing out that it‚Äôs not true. They didn‚Äôt say anything about whether or not you COULD exploit color blind options. The main point being, if there is a way that colorblind options will give you an unfair advantage, people will exploit it. So they have to implement it in a way that doesn‚Äôt change how killers can see things right now. I think we‚Äôre in agreement on that.
---
I‚Äôm also saying that if they don‚Äôt do it correctly and it somehow gives an advantage, it will be exploited left and right.
---

Ok idk

Here's a first attempt at making my own Killer, just because I thought "How could would a Roman soldier be in DBD?"
---
The art is not mine, you can find the artist [here](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/q2kVn), always give credit.
---
A few comments. I did wonder how I could incorporate a shield into the Killer, but I concluded that that wouldn't really fit a Killer given it's defensive nature, but Romans also used the Pilum, a Javelin, so I ended up making a ranged killer. I was worried he could end up to similar to the Huntress, so I tried to make it different to the hatchets with the mandatory wind up, and the utility beyond just damage, but with only one. Though I'd probably even change the slowed movement speed to just having to stand still.
---
My concerns with the Perks would mainly be that Divide Et Impera could encourage tunneling. I toyed with the idea of it being more powerful, at the expense of not being able to put non-obsessions into the Dying state, but that would have just made tunneling mandatory. It could be combined interestingly with Play with Your Food or Save the Best for Last to decimate Obsessions. Make an Example is effectively just Infectious Fright, but for hooked survivors, trying to play into that theme of crucifying your enemies. And Decimatio, an interesting way to punish cowardice within survivors by weakening their actions for abandoning teammates.
---
Do 2-3 totems each game. You'll likely find them on the way to each generator, but if there's something like 2 gens left then look a bit harder. I do this in my survivor games, and it works wonders. Almost every noed game I have, the perk never activates and they are left with only 3 perks.
---
She still has over a 50% win rate across all levels of gameplay. She‚Äôs not dead, you‚Äôre just being overdramatic.
---
You are not entitled to a 4K. Sorry to break that to you.
---
Don't feel bad. I once had a daily for the Spirit to kill one person by my hand so I befriended my obsession and let them do all the gens then I mori'd them with rancor! Ah, good timesüòé
---
I almost never use these perks so I didn‚Äôt know that. You don‚Äôt need to get mad at something as stupid as FOV.
---
Here I am disappointed that we didn't use a picture of ash this time, that's the girl's name in the meme.
---
Legatus, Legate, Centurion. Something suitably Roman.
---
Not too similar to Huntress?
---
Been playing since before Huntress released, so I adopted pretty early, and I had to suffer through worse stages of this game's development than likely most of the people who made a huge stink about this.  
---
Was living in a motel with no internet when the two events the cosmetics they "reviewed" came from, so no, this doesn't reward "early adopters", the event happened last year, that's not "early".  Plus, all the ACTUAL early adopter stuff, the stuff I already had because I actually AM an early adopter, is now free, so no.
---
Just admit y'all are butt-hurt you wasted time on one of BHVR's early, and so bad they don't even want to do them anymore, attempts at seasonal events. This has zero to do with rewarding player dedication and everything to do with covering for their own coding mistakes and caving to pressure from a toxic community.
---
Like there are times where I play killer and I just kill everyone with no regards but then there‚Äôs that one game where you just feel bad for survivors for some reason.
---
oh no
---
Oh well you know. hes fucking myers i think he deserves 3
---
Who tf would give the killer a free down like that?
---
I only feel bad when people DC at the start or when survivors get sandbagged or farmed. Don't feel bad for doing challenges :P
---
As a SWF survivor, I agree with you.  
---
As a solo survivor I don't.
---
Playing killer or playing solo survivor is equally hard imo, because a lot of it depends on your team/survivors and how well they go at it at the game. You are never gonna survive as a survivor if 2 survivors DC in the first min of the game, while a killer will streamroll those last 2.
---
But the joke comes at the 3rd to last panel.
---
But you only focus on one person at a time. Even when you switch off to somebody else you‚Äôre not mind gaming multiple people. You have to keep in mind other survs when playing surv too not to mention if you‚Äôre playing solo it can feel impossible to get everything done while also keeping the killer busy. Besides if a killer is struggling in a chase they have the option to switch up, if a surv is feeling outmatched they just go down and don‚Äôt have that option.
---
David or feng
---
This looks like it took at least a few hours or more just how long was that wait time
---
Maybe that's because so many of the Archive challenges are specific to Trapper.
---
Where did I say he was op? I just said you‚Äôre obviously one of those people that thinks every killer is balanced at launch and gets triggered when they get any little nerf or balance lmao.
---
Jesus, the memes here have sunk to an all time low.
---
Yeah this helped alot because people were steam rolling me when I played Oni even though I'm a billy main playing the oni was fun thanks interact
---
Exactly this! Is it possible? Sure it is. But the circumstances need to play exactly in your favor it‚Äôs just not fun.. i don‚Äôt want to do challenges based on a lot of luck.
---
There‚Äôs only one time when Mikey was the little brother and caught his sibling doing kinky shit.  We all know how that turned out....
---
They could give him a Toga and sandals and call it a ‚Äúfrat party‚Äù skin and get away with it maybe
---
This goes both ways at least, charge reducers (like the rare medkit one) increase heal speed but don't reduce charges
---
Still badly needs fixing
---
I made macro's on my mouse one for space bar so I can drink or eat while doing a gen one handed. I also made one to repeat space bar and A D for struggle and wiggle. Wiggle doesn't go any faster the faster you hit it any way so I can slowly do it and still get the same result but it allows me to drink and less fat fingering a key (my brain likes to twist the order and mess up wiggle for some reason).
---
Is it the same in normal matches or just in KYF?
---
Unrelated but does anyone know how the unnerving presence challenge works cause i don‚Äôt know how. If anyone could tell me how to finish it that would be much appreciated.
---
Yeah right, that too...
---
I play on ps4 and i can say with the people i get ranked with it‚Äôs really fcking hard. You actually have to play ‚Äúbad‚Äù in a way to get into endgame. And then have the extra pressure to down someone quickly.
---
He must die giving his life to save everyone else in Endgame.
---
That would actually be a scary team before Chapter 14 but yeah, 4head devs just gave exclusives to everybody weSmart
---
But you can unhook and open doors, so why not mend?
---
Pet the doggo
---
&gt;It‚Äôs more than unlikely. It‚Äôs fucking absurd. I‚Äôve been playing this game for years and it hasn‚Äôt happened to me even once. 
---
Ok? It never happened to you so that must mean that it doesn't happen to others? 
---
&gt;Do you realize the conditions that would have to be met for it to happen 3 times in one playing session?
---
Like I said before, this isn't impossible but highly unlikely. If that truly happened to someone, then yeah, that person truly is unlucky.
---
If you honestly think that happening to someone three times is just as likely as into running into a dinosaur tomorrow, then I don't know what to say.
---
Actually he spelt it, ‚Äúdecapiyated‚Äù
---
You hadn‚Äôt even finished the vault animation, it looks bad but you would have gotten hit no matter what.
---
Doesn‚Äôt surprise me. I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs a spot where even a Claudette can be seen.
---
set messages to friends only
---
It was a couple games, and I think total wait time was about an hour and a half between em
---
I lagged back.
---
There‚Äôs really nothing else to say when you can clearly see the lag.
---
I really hate that a lot of people seem to only know ghostface from scary movie, or prefer those over the actual scream movies 
---
The funny thing is that ‚Äúscream‚Äù is already satire, so scary movie making fun of it is a giant r/woooosh
---
I found adrenaline and decisive on the shrine. I basically never play survivor but it is really nice to have them available because I don't think I will ever get a survivor to a high enough level to unlock their teqchables
---
I did, but they can just send a friend request with a hate message attached to it
---
yes ure missing a corner of a post-it note in the center of your screen to use as an aim guide
---
What's even worse is dcing first hook
---
I have no idea what just happen.  Ut I only started this yesterday and I'm a Doctor main at level 16. So, I'm lost still except I'm good at killing survivors so far. Until I run into the groups I'm hearing about anyway
---
self care and no botany? ew
---
I feel like killer is a good analogy for life and how people interact with others. Some people will instantly switch to rage as soon as they feel disrespect, others will bully, some are just pure efficient and uncaring.
---
I like to watch my friend play and when he gets teabagged, he can suddenly switch to a rage, tunnelling, camping and multiple hooking some survivors. It's ironic because it's the sort of behaviour he berates others for.   
---
Personally I try to play "fair", I'll cycle through who I hook and try to hook everyone twice before I start finishing them off, I won't go for the recently hooked and won't camp. I'll even give players a knowing look as I walk past, (giving them a temporary pass) especially if I've been repeatedly destroying them in the match.
---
Often I'll let the baby players escape or give the MVP the hatch. To me getting a 4k matters less than getting my challenge/daily/achievement/maximising blood points. I honestly don't care if anyone escapes or not, if they outplayed me then they deserve the win, if they were outplayed it's usually obvious. Sometimes I'll determine the group I'm against is low rank and will switch to just screwing around once I've double hooked everyone.
---
I'm a level 7-8 and get matched with rank 4's :/
---
true but it can buy time and may confuse the killer, for instance if you're in a chase
---
2 slowdown addons and 4 slowdown perks
---
Yes that's because you're not actually stuck there, it's your camera that's stuck there. That's why it can actually be difficult for survivors to tell if you're stuck because you can be moving around. Someone else posted one of a trapper that was walking into a wall on the other side of the map from the gen that his camera was stuck on. This bug really sucks.
---
First make a main for killer and survivor, next level them up first (at least to level 50 or prestige 1) to get perks on them and Ad ons after that level up another killer/ survivor to level 40 to get there teacheables (good ones hopefully) finally level up your main even more to get those and you should be set to repeat this process until your P3 with tons of teacheables
---
Freddy with
---
Ruin, Thantophobia, dying light, surge
---
Addons- Paintbrush and Swing Chains.
---
Surge can be replaced
---
we don't know the guy you mentioned. i dont know why you assume we wouldve heard of him. imo wraith is teh #1 greatest killer. especially if u attach the snake addon that makes him move faster when cloaked
---
Jane
---
The killer placed me one second away from the hatch and closed it in my face. If you were the one playing at like midnight last night then yes I was the feng
---
imo he isnt, he just fits tru3's playstyle very well
---
I know scream and thats it satire but its more parody of the killer gliches and not satire while scary movie is completely satire
---
Killer ain't much better considering you can get stuck to generators by kicking them.....
---
You use urban evasion so this post is irrelevant
---
boring.
---
Wait bhvr balances the game? I thought survivors did
---
a map where stealth actually works? finally
---
Still nothing on killer getting stuck to the gens though..... fuck us I guess
---
I forgot spirit existed after this update for some reason
---
I was gonna post the full clip with escape but I thought it was too long, I ran back because I thought piggy would recover in time to hit me so I wanted to play it safe and wait her out.
---
No. Tru3 is known for his dumb opinions, the fact people are even questioning this is shocking to me
---
Anime pls ?
---
I love how I can't play the game and have to wait for survivors to herp derp around me while the gate is open....
---
I simply farmed with them and let them get the last gen done. Then i downed 2 and opened the gate.
---
having conditions and being conditional does not equal gimmicky
---
Alright let's run down this list...
---
Tunneling is has BT and killing one dude does less for you than hooking everyone. 
---
Camping literally loses you the game anywhere above rank 12 where survivors go do gens instead and the killer is afk on a hook.
---
Morris give less BP than hooking and saving a survivor and can cause you to not pip
---
The killer gets addons to their power (survivors get addons for their tools like endurance for a handful of seconds but ok) Sure someone them are very powerful but they cant be used every game consistently.
---
EGC is killer sided how? It just forces the game to end. "The killer is camping the gate" go to the other one. There is poor design in the doors being too close but the EGC ending the game is not a crutch at all.
---
NOED absolutely. Fuck this perk. It shouldnt exist. It (very much like Decisive Strike, rewards who is using it for playing poorly. That's bad in design, as players will eventually require it to play the game (just like DS).
---
RUIN. Ah yes. The ruin crutch when survivors can steam roll generators in 37 seconds with just two people and one tool box. Ah yes Ruin is a crutch when survivors have Brand new parts that allow them to solo a generator in 65 seconds or have a friend and do it in 33. Ah Ruin when Survivors can run Prove themself with Tool boxes and finished generators with brand new parts in sub 30 seconds with two people on the gen. Ruin isn't a crutch. It's a perk that stops gen rushing.
---
Seeing the lobby is a crutch? Yeah let the killer not know who the obsession is so that when he spawns in hes fucking clueless. Let the survivors run 4 tool boxes and the killer not have a chance to grab Franklins. This game is heavily Survivor sided. With out a way to prepare for toolbox genrushing you are going to have a bad time.
---
BBQ isn't a crutch. At all. It rewards the player for playing the game correctly. That not a crutch. It's not like NOED and DS where the user is getting things just because they took the perk and they are bad at the game.
---
I am not sure if you mean dailies or archives but one of the archives is literally mori somone on a specific Killer. Some archive challenges are get two NOED sacs during EGC. That one is very difficult is you dont use the crutch becuase tou have to go ton egc. Ones like Basement while someone is already in the basement also changes the way you play forcing you to play around the basement and opening yourself to getting gentushed. 
---
Host Connection advantage... what? The games on dedicated servers (Xbox and PS4 arent I know) but oh no the killer lands hits that were hits on their screen. Even children's games of Tag have rules where if the person who's It says they got you, they got you. Cry more about this but the game would be fod awful if killer committed to a seing and went though a survivor but didn't take a health state.
---
The basement: counter to basment games is dont play near the fucking basment. Kinda a big brain play I know. It spawns in one of two locations on every map. If you dont see the basment there it's at the other one.another thing about the basement is the  jungle gym above it. Every basment spawn, with the exception of Hawkins Laboratory and the one that spawns in the farm house, have extremely safe loops near them. Even if they aren't in the shack.
---
Pallets are not crutches. Looping is a fundamental part of the game. Pallets that are not safe are not to loop around. They are to stun and gain distance. If you drop it early and get hit or play around a bad pallet that's your fault. Meanwhile the new map has infinites around the basment.
---
I am sure you are a Killer main. Everyone on Reddit is a rank 1 Survivor and Killer when they are trying to change someone's mind. DS is a free 60 second health state and if you bothered to read my comment you could see why going after the unhooker and hooking them wont always get you to avoid DS. It's a crutch. You know it too. Adrenaline isn't a crutch. You are rewarded for playing well with Adrenaline. Meaning you deserved the heal. That's not a crutch. Keys are absolutely crutches you can play poorly and put yourself in a very bad 3 gen and you can still just win the game because you have a key. Sweaty SWF is also a crutch I have gone against rank 2 survivors who would run into walls while looping because she needed her SWF to help her.
---
Congrats put of 17 guesses on what's a crutch you got three that are actually crutches.
---
Angels of Death. It‚Äôs inspired from an RPGmaker game on steam too.
---
So you did escape?
---
At least you get to play fullscreen with more than 0% resolution
---
this is soooo good!!! i love the colors !

Whats that dudes name ?

Im not gonna vibe check you cause you already failed i was laughing at all these comments and then this dickhead shows up starts telling people how to interpret memes.

Waazzzaaaaaapp

Ok, thanks. I'm a little bit slow sometimes ^^
---
I like this idea a lot, it makes the Legion feel properly like a "band of merciless killers" rather than a single kid with a knife. But I think it would be a little more interesting if: 
---
Instead of using the attack button anywhere to place or swap members, the Legion starts the match as every member, sort of huddled together pretty close in single or double-file, or maybe even merged together in some horrible entity creation that cycles between who is seen, sort of like Spirit phasing, except instead of vanishing they change into a different person. Then, the Legion can use the Active Ability button (usually Left Ctrl) to enter a locker, at which point three options become available: 
---
Use the Attack Button to exit the locker in a lunge attack, damaging any survivor in you path,
---
Use the Power button (usually right-click) to swap positions with another Legion member, or 
---
Use the Active Ability Button to simply exit the locker, leaving a member in it if not all members are in position. 
---
Only one member enters a locker at a time, and all other members not currently in a locker vanish after entering a locker.  
---
*The Entity took their friendship and strengthened it, twisted it into another aberration of the fog. They no longer have a need for words, they are The Legion.*
---
If you only do gens and keep track of the killer, I can see why you think survivor is easy. Because you're one of those teamates.
---
All good friend
---
spirit was barely nerfed
---
I'm really amazed how the devs keep breaking random stuff each time they introduce a new killer. This seems to be a severe case of spaghetti code. Thanks tho, I couldn't quite put my finger on it what it was.
---
Pls bring back Machine Gun, I miss it so much
---
The dude in the picture? His name is Isaac Foster.
---
I'd replace Ruin and surge for BBQ and PGTW, as they go better with his kit, but y, that's basically it.
---
I would definitely have to say claudette. Self-care is nice but it‚Äôs not all,botany knowledge is very useful, and empathy is always overlooked but is still extremely good
---
Ty
---
Yesterday I saved a Dwight after cleansing NOED, and the other two scrammed. As soon as I got Dwight off the hook I got trapped, and he left me! Trapper wasnt even around ):
---
oh that's why I got blinded without any survivors around
---
Fuck, you're right, it seems the patch removed it.
---
I use ghostface because he's a great killer if you know how to use him but teabagging makes him 88888 times better
---
Power -&gt; frenzy -&gt; catch up -&gt; cancel power -&gt; lose distance from cooldown -&gt; end up back where you started -&gt; end up walking up to the survivor for a normal hit
---
Sadly i was playing on console :(. He never ended up messaging me though lol.
---
Base Wraith is an okay killer. I'd put him like at the end of the middle tier. He has the mobility to patrol gens faster than most other killers who only rely on their 115% speed but those who can too outshine him. He has the ability to get into chases fast and get the first hit because of his ability, but has no means of ending the chase fast either. He can be looped easily too. His ability is very limiting as with out addons, it only gives you map pressure. He has no way of slowing the game down or ending chases fast. This is all assuming you're playing against player that know what they're doing. Wraith does become deadly with his addons and right perks tho, but still, average at best.
---
I learned this week that I can feel better about BM survivors by tunneling the guy teabagging and letting the other three go farm and leave. :\^) Three survivors thank me and the last one tells me to kms, everybody wins!
---
I agree wholeheartedly. You learn a lot about both sides by playing both. Even if you main one or the other, a little double-sided experience goes a long way!

He ranked selfcare S-tier on november and said that there is no better realing resorces
---
No problem dude (:
---
It may be saying something but you know the saying - show, don't tell.
---
Being chased for 3-4 minutes with no gens being done, being hooked and left on hook because the corners are more interesting then saving you, exploding your gens and running away, guiding the killer towards you because they suck at looping, farming you on a hook, that's the kind of BS I've come across TODAY as a solo survivor from my supposed teammates.  
---
Sure, a killer requires more "concentration" but it's by no means harder (nor easier) then solo survivor.
---
Im literally not telling people how to interpret memes though? This is a very literal meme, there is nothing to interpret? I was simply agreeing with the other person that there wasn‚Äôt anything swf related in the meme. I‚Äôm being downvoted for being factual?
---
Can k have the template please?
---
Dont straw man me, man. "Keeping track of the killer" encompasses safe unhooks, heals, opening gates, cleansing hexs, etc. You have to know where they are to know that its safe to do your objectives.
---
I had to make this because I have about 17 BPS and 6 Escape Cakes and everytime I pop one it‚Äôs like the killer is playing in his ass or tunneling. Or ultimately, just D/C from rage. Totally not caring it‚Äôs all worth it in the end.
---
thank god, disgusting killer
---
its a way of saying walking crouching while doing nothing...i dont use UE per say
---
I approve this meme.
---
Without addons, what are your thoughts? Addons can make all the killers a lot better than their base kit.
---
I wish survivors had unique ways of escaping. Yui could be repairing her motorcycle.
---
IMO Iri Head Huntress is top tier
---
Anyways yea u could make a separate tier list for with addons / without addons cuz some of them really do affect the game a lot.
---
*Laughs in hag*
---
I hate assholes in this game as much as the next guy but rule 3 says you can't shame players.

I haven't had that happen yet.

Wait, you haven't watched stranger things?

I had a rank 20 in my rank 1 game

Imagine giving your own money just to spite someone and then making a meme out of it for internet points loool
---
had a game against a ghostface on hawkins, it went south super quick which resulted in one person dc‚Äôing and when he downed the other survivor tht was still alive with me I went to hide just in case of BBQ but turns out he was dropping and picking them up so we could farm! he even opened the gate and escorted me out thru the exit, we all got a lot of bp just from messing around too; 10/10 would game with again, was a fun match! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
No, you're just very unlucky
---
Cold dirt and one of the mixtapes
---
Omg, so many sore killers in comments. Game is very killer sided for quite some time. So it's understandable why survivors trying to justify their failure.
---
If you do lemme knowüòé Good luck!
---
I agree except for SB

That‚Äôs a good red ranks exhaustion perk
---
I don't think he can read.
---
I bought him earlier today and was all excited to play him. So excited that I forgot to choose my first perk, and went in with no perks :') rookie mistakes haha
---
Kinda. I don't think it's similar enough to be a SWF tho.
---
Great idea and it's always good to have creativity in the community. The only improvement I have is the amount of writing with little visual. If you have all the text in one big block it makes people not want to read it, it may also he a good idea to design perk and power icons. Good job ;)
---
You seem upset about something.
---
How so?
---
Wat is that katana D's
---
Balanced landing players: teach me

Just use detective hunch and inner strength totems begone build I use
---
Yeah I never get a killer with a mori, some people just seem to always get them
---
I played like 5 hours of killer last night, no idea how to reproduce it, never happened to me. :/
---
Play however you want. There are no rules to it, killer tries to kill and survivors try to escape. People will try to use "etiquette" as a handicap for themselves.
---
Thank you!
---
The dumbassery is strong in this one.
---
How can you make a girl's sliced up corpse sexy?
---
It's one of my mains but I recommend you not listen to anyone else‚Äôs opinions, Why everyone has their own ways of playing
---
I actually died for booping it, still makes me laugh.
---
Self care and urban sure, but SB I disagree with. You cant honestly say SB is a crutch perk while all the other ones arent, because they do very similar things. If you're going to say all exhaustion perks are a crutch, then so are hex perks.
---
Pay no attention to guild books or player made rule books. Only follow the rules given by the game itself. If you don't want to give the last guy the hatch don't.
---
Sprint Burst is more than legit. Seems to me you don't play in red ranks often.
---

Why are you not using a macro?

Why the fuck are usernames your way of saying it's a swf, no shit it is a sef

Eternal Darkness Chapter
---
I was playing solo survivor against a Wraith. I looped him for 4 gens, and when he hooked me he facecamped the shit out of me and kept hitting me on the hook. My teammates were champs and cranked out the last gen AND got me off the hook AND bodyblocked for me to get to the gate.
---
For once, I can say I had good teammates :)
---
There are a terrible amount of unwritten rules, letting the last survivor escape is just if you're feeling nice or not, Standing infront of a hooked survivor while there are still gens to patrol is an asshole move, picking up a survivor and moving them to hatch, then closing it is a scum move too, t-bagging is toxic, there are alot more
---
Sorry I must have missed it, how have spirit and legion been nerfed?
---
Game about brutal murder: censor fuck
---
Trailing a survivor for 20 seconds is absolutely not worse than tanking a DS. Getting stunned by DS eats up 5 seconds alone, you think you can catch up and end every subsequent chase in the next 15 seconds? That's the dream of every killer nowadays, and if it was the case nobody would even bother respecting DS in today's meta. You're also wrong about it being easy to initiate chases if a killer tried trailing you. Have you ever seen people running Play With Your Food? They trail all the time while also being able to end chases by just looking down or away, which pretty much nullifies your idea of simply running in front of them to restart the chase.
---
Sprint burst is top exhaustion perk.
---
who am i giving money to
---
But do what you want, just don't exploit lmao
---
SB can definitely be used for sure. I‚Äôm just not a fan of feeling like I can‚Äôt run to waste it.  I just think you can get much more use out of dead hard.
---
Brock Lesnar or Goldberg would be survivor lol
---
Meg has the best but all 3 of taps perks are solid
---
Yh completely teleport out of a chase, seems fair.
---
2 times really doesn‚Äôt count for anything
---
I figured out the standing by hook when the game made me lose points for it the first time. 
---
I had 1 guy/kid send me a voice message after as the doc I won in under 5 minutes saying I sucked at the game etc etc. I was more upset since the killer matchmaking takes me almost 10 minutes to get into the game... I wanted to play longer to.
---
Do you play solo survivor?
---
The thing is that the difficulty of the game has a degree of rng. Did you get the god loop on crotus prenn, or are there 3 dead zones? Did the matchmaking do its job? Is the duo swf actually trying, or are they trying to sabotage each other?
---
True that. I don't think anyone wants to spend up to two minutes in chase for level one GoM
---
Sprintburst is good and self care is nice when gates are open but your team left without you. Self care is meta for a reason. And is better then inner strength simply because your not always gonna find a totem.  I just don‚Äôt see self care being a cushion perk. It takes a lot of time to selfcare
---
I post oversaturated content and it gets removed for being oversaturated. I BLOCKED NAMES, still oversaturated you nob
---
I wonder if the killer would have seen and/or been able to interact with you as the escape run animation played and you were still stuck inside.
---
Just realized how I've written it is not what I intentioned. It should be "Survivors that look at a hooked Survivor while within X metres"
---
It's okay, you'll learn more as you go along and get more hate messages
---
Actually, the next legion buff will let survivors knock them out and then hook them for extra bloodpoints!

---
Lanius was on my mind. True to Caesar
---
Just had a game where the killer didn't even saw me, a Myers. I was running spine chill and it saved me on 3 gens
---
For like a month I'm facing only Huntresses, it's like 60-80% of all killers I encounter. Red ranks, EU, PC. So well, no
---
The game seems to be back on it‚Äôs unoptimized bs again. The other day I was trying to get blinds for the tome and the first time I‚Äôd turn on the flashlight near the killer without fail every match, frames dropped mega hard.
---
It clearly says three times in a row. And while i get  your point, i‚Äôve dealt with this multiple times this weekend. Just it being so bad tonight makes me wonder if people caught on to something or if the servers are messing up.
---
add kindred onto that and a healing orgy
---
Camping should be only viable if you are getting destroyed, if im going against toxic pieces of shits who just want to ruin my day, im atleast killing one of them
---
I did realize that after I posted it. Already realized some mistakes or changes I'd make, so can so a V2
---
Newer(ish) player.. What is the benefit of prestiging? Do you keep their perks or have to level them up again? Is it just for the cosmetics or is there an actual gameplay reason to prestige?
---
Yeah, I've noticed quite a few people DC when we go up against doctors. I think it's the skill checks that a lot of people hate.
---
I do that sumtimes cuz I'm trying to get that 30 hatch closes achievement. need 2 more. I usually let the survivor go out the gates after though
---
When your devour and ruin are both in good spots
---
DC penalties aren‚Äôt on console yet as there‚Äôs no dedicated servers. Also salty Killers will normally force close the application instead of dcing normally as it crashes the game and no one gets any points.
---
Jesus of suburbia?
---
This was added recently and the match I\`m talking about heppened before that patch
---
I have never even heard that.   Wasnt ruin on there like a few weeks back? Maybe a little longer.
---
For real. It's a giant deadzone, and the 4 corners have loopable structures. It seems like 80% of the time all 4 structures will be 4 wall tiles as well. If you're not near them, immersion is practically your only option.
---
Yeah me too. It‚Äôs almost like you called me out for being sensitive and defensive, then went on a huge sensitive and defensive tirade after actually calling me a psychopath, because it‚Äôs almost like you... care... after claiming I shouldn‚Äôt have made a post because it seemed I cared too much.
---
What a hypocritical thing to do
---
Meg
---
Exactly why I wish it'd just be ordered alphabetically after you own a perk with all perks having just one color in your inventory rather than "This is a RARE perk"
---
Like it **does not matter** that it's rare or not once I own it
---
I‚Äôm not monto haha, but thanks for the compliment!
---
what is this shitty phone?
---
Think she disconnected
---
Then you'll see broken bone remains on the ground. (Although I myself do believe there should be something like a noise whenever dull totems are cleansed so people can keep track)
---
it would be cool but that would be a lot of work for somthing so small
---
I do indeed
---
dont make fun of my nurse game play im trying my best
---
It said she escaped.
---
Ok bud
---
I think it was too, because now that I think of it I think I had decisive strike too, even though I just bought it out of shrine this week
---
If you submit a ticket and show this video and give their usernames, they can.
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed anything when playing killer. I got stuck in a crouch and couldn‚Äôt walk when I was playing survivor, and the not being able to wiggle thing happened again.
---
Dont know then lol
---
I need my Viking Jeff and I need it now.
---
Yes, They can be banned as that is teaming
---
How do you not recognize the Scoops Ahoy hat?
---
When Feng drops from the catwalk in the foundry
---
If you slugged her, perhaps the game lagged and it appeared as if she was still in the same spot. And when your character model got close it reloaded and refreshed to show you that she was infact crawling away and ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù. Then I imagine on her screen that she was crawling away toward the hatch for however long it took you to slug and hook the other survivor- giving her the hatch. (since she had a fast crawl).
---
Otherwise, it could be cheating. But I‚Äôve had plenty of games where when the killer would be nearby my player character, the lag would spike.  But when he‚Äôd be outside terror radius, the game wouldn‚Äôt lag. And I think it has more to do with gaming code/internal memory issues instead of ‚Äúoh this person has bad lag.‚Äù Think of it as each object in the game has to have certain values loaded in, which when you‚Äôre by some objects it‚Äôs not as hard for your gaming device or servers to process it. Like if you were just beside a lit totem. 
---
But if your player character was next to a person being final hooked animation, a lit totem, a killer, a hatch spawning and opening animation, blood physics, and object physics, it‚Äôs more likely that the code and hardware processing these things might lag.
---
Its also important to notice this if it happens more or newer killers/players or older killers/players.
---
If it‚Äôs an issue on old ones, it means the code isn‚Äôt optimized for the new game mechanics. If it‚Äôs new ones, then it means the new content is rushed and the code is not at optimized. 
---
Just my food for thought.
---
‚ÄùLost our offerings and add ons both times‚Äù kinda fooled me
---
This lobby waiting thing is productive with you. I envy! 
---
Great drawing!
---
Use blood warden, get everyone on death hook. Let them finish gens (pretend as if you're friendly) and betray them mercilessly. As soon as 2 or 3 are down you open 1 exit yourself. You hang one, that's 1 kill. Everyone close to the exit will reveal their aura bc of blood warden.  Abuse that, down 1 before the timer ends and hook him. Is he on death hook as well? Great, that's your challenge done. Otherwise camp him mercilessly. If anyone dares to save it will be a trade. Had to betray a cute bill for this challenge but got it first try nonetheless
---
It's not a bug, before Bill came to console his perks were base perks with different icons on the perks.
---
I'll have to try more survivor, it will also let me see killer abilities without buying or using them.
---
I'm not sure having the blur effect last for longer is a good idea. There's a good amount of people that have to kill themselves on first hook or DC against clown simply because the visuals of the gas make them sick of give them headaches.
---
That makes sense then thank you!
---
Ok for real, No mither should give the following effects.
---
You dont drop blood orbs
---
Thana ignores your injured status through the whole game
---
BP boost
---
And exhaust recovery, possibly at a slightly slower rate.
---
I do think yuis new blood perk should be changed
---
I did spirit. Hooked someone after gens were done, opened the gates myself. Downed someone else with noed and they were on death hook. First person killed themselves on hook.
---
Wow what scumbags.  Yes the trash sandbagging survivors as well as the micro penis babykiller can all be banned for teaming with each other.  Your video is blatant evidence of that.  You would have needed to report them all in game on the end score screen though hopefully you did that.  Assuming you did the devs have a way to send your video to them on their website.
---
Where can i do this?
---
For christ sake, all times then* whatever if you wanna be a nitpicker while someone is just asking a question then be my guest but do it somewhere else
---
I think the effect is too minor for the addon. If it allowed to do more, like breaking windows as a guy bellow suggested, then it could work, but locker breaking should just be a nice touch to his power, since lockers barely affect the gameplay (only if survivors run those locker based perks) and wasting Oni's instadown power for denying it is kinda useless
---
Lol i'm the same guy xd
---
I highly suggest you read the new players guides and glossary of common terms on here :)

Literally every ruin I had yesterday I had a few the game started and it was clearly in front of them because less then 40 seconds and gone
---
He's a terrible killer so people have to use whatever advantage possible, usually through a scummy build. He is also the best at camping basements because of ability to down multiple people instantly
---
Did she hurt you
---
Vertical Dead Hard (Extreme Edition)
---
If you were running Beast of Prey and Nemesis it was stronger than old Legion, as a Legion would just have to hit you once with feral frenzy and then they have a guaranteed down. After the hit, if a survivor did stun the killer, they would bleed out, but if they didn't the killer could just bloodlust them and they would bleed out anyways from Beast of Prey.
---
I'd say that she's fun, but she's been heavily nerfed over time making her a bit lackluster overall, and I have no personal experience with the demogorgon to speak of.
---
Fair enough lad.
---
&gt;we heard you loud and clear. So we're opening up DBD to the steam marketplace. Now you can sell your unused addons and items on the steam market place. Bloodpoints will now also be purchasable in packs (10000 blood points for 1 dollar). Stay safe out there
---
Surprise motherfucka

Butthurt TydeTyme's fanboy on my radar.

Oh, sorry, I'm not used to reddit on PC and those nicknames are so hard to spot xDD
---
Makes the game look like an acid trip.
---
I did with clown but I‚Äôm good with him but I just killed 2 and left 2 alive and threw bottles and didn‚Äôt kill them to get them to just do gens and stop freaking out. When it got down to one I would try to watch them both . For me one was running around so I followed him cause he was the better of the 2 . Once the gate got power I downed them both walked over to gate opened myself then hooked both . Pretty simple was at rank 8-9 when I did this
---
Less than 40? Those are rookie numbers! I consider myself lucky if it lasts more than 20. (In all honesty I understand your pain brother)
---
Oh i actually didn‚Äôt know that. Should‚Äôve read the patch notes instead of the leaks. And yeah i can‚Äôt believe people take the time to do that, as if matchmaking doesn‚Äôt take long enough already.
---
&gt;Legion is very op with sloppy butcher
---
You need to use a regular hit to apply sloppy now though.
---
I mean, I still think Kindred is S-tier solo, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs always 100% going to work for you.  Adrenaline is considered an S-tier perk and you can have dozens of games in a row without using it if you get unlucky/don‚Äôt end up needing it.  At the very least it removes the scenarios where you team genuinely wants to help but thinks someone else is closer.  (If you‚Äôre hooked on the clear opposite of the map and I don‚Äôt see indication of a chase, I‚Äôm going to assume someone else is closer than me and will probably continue my objective until to late to prevent you from going into struggle).
---
That‚Äôs not even potato behavior.  If all three other players stop every time there‚Äôs a hook, survivors would always lose.  Without some method of communication of what the other players are doing (which buffed kindred now gives you regardless of what side you‚Äôre on), dying in first hook is way more common.
---
It‚Äôs not going to remove EVERY instance, but it‚Äôs still a massive help to solo players.
---
Epic
---
Haha christians would love this

Jeff is the true Jesus of DBD, just give him a white robe cosmetic and sandals along with the longest beard in the world, boom. You got Fat Albert Jesus

No problem you said you were new so there are literally no dumb questions.  Ask whatever you need to that's what this sub is supposed to be for.

---
Sometimes it do be like that
---
I agree that BBQ isnt OP and that there are counters, but that whole list of yours isnt actual counters. 
---
1, 2, and 6 are counters. 
---
3, 4, 5, and 7 is the survivor hoping the killer doesnt choose their aura to go after or is far enough away that they can hide once their aura does go away. 
---
Again, BBQ isnt OP or anything but listing "Standing still so the killer doesnt know where you're gonna run" isnt exactly a counter lol The killer knows where you are and you're giving him a 4 second head start to your location. If it's a Nurse, Billy, or Oni they're already on top of you.
---
This happened to me at end of Match while they were all hooked . It also has happened to me with locker but that one all I did was open it again. What I started to do is when I go to kick gen I hold S key to walk backwards and it never has happened to me again
---
If they remove the hook timer for first hook, all that means is the first player to get hook doesn‚Äôt get rescued until gens are done/someone else is hooked.  If there‚Äôs no time pressure to save them, get the gens done while the killer has an extra objective to track.

I am in green ranks and literally never got a game vs survivors this easy.

Usually I face survivors 3-5 ranks better than me and not the other way round

I was surprised I pulled it off too lol,I suck at flashlight saves. I‚Äôm like rank 12 right now.
---
I think it should be 2% increase bp per prestige and 1% bp increase per devotion. Would be fair.
---
Really
---
If only they made the idea of a killer stabbing you over and over work instead of just using a pre-existing mechanic that they have to buff to keep said killer in check
---
I love angels of death
---
Early survivor ranks are tough because no one has a solid understanding of gameplay mechanics and teamwork is key to escaping. So, I'd say to just work on working with your ability to loop the killer and learn how to run the tiles if you wish to become a better killer overall. Use windows more than pallets to evade the killer, pallets are better used to gain distance and to rid the killer of bloodlust, imo. Try to read the killer's movements and capitalize on their mistakes. These things will help you later on as a killer when you recognize the survivor's mentality.
---
Mental breakdowns? Extreme exhaustion?
---
Jesus Christ.
---
meant that i‚Äôm rank 20 lmao
---
If you are interested is an samsung galaxy a70
---
You are correct. Rank does not matter. Legion is a stalling Killer who cannot effectively stall. His synergy with perks allowed him to stall better. 
---
By taking that away AND nerfing the mending time, he has lost any ability to do so. A slight increase in speed does not make up for that, besides, the speed increase was just a revert of a previous nerf. 
---
As for your comments about what Reddit wants, it seems like most people here understand Legion is a bad Killer and fundamentally flawed. I, personally, would take old Legion minus the exploits over new Legion until they can figure something else out. I have made a redesigned power for him, if you look at my posts.
---
This is actually the best fan-created content or killer concept I've ever seen for DBD.
---
Makes the game look horrendous if they're cranked up, and they filter the entire game anyways so masking the greens as well doesn't really help all the time. 
---
Red Forest is a perfect example of this, the tree needles on the ground get filtered to cyan/magenta as well....and look exactly like scratch marks.
---
Plus console doesn't have that option, so anyone on PS4/XB/Switch is SOL until they add the option.
---
You‚Äôre kinda a dick for not just stepping in it.. I did this before to got person to understand then gave them hatch. He was probably going to give it to you anyway
---
No they don't. U can't even know why people dodge.
---
Lol they won't come that easy again.  Typically the only way to flashlight save against a killer is during the pickup animation otherwise they just look up while walking but this dude had other plans.  
---
Congrats on the save though.  Noob killer or not it was still a clutch play.
---
Well, better than being camped.
---
Also, I should have asked earlier, but which platform are you playing on?
---
Remember that you can pop the door open yourself and trigger the EGC once the gens are done. If you can get your slugs on the ground and open the door yourself, you can get the challenge that way.
---
Survivors have to keep track of their team and their success is at the mercy of how useful their teammates are. Solo survivor is 1000x more stressful than killer. But the times where you get a team that works together without comms and you all manage to escape feels so good.
---
It's this kind of behaviour that that just triggers a deep inate fury in my soul. Utter scumbags.
---
That‚Äôs so me whenever I‚Äôm working on a gen and someone‚Äôs hooked
---
Because higher contrast colors make it more obvious which direction scratch marks fade in, which makes it significantly easier to track survivors.
---
easy fix to killer losing points. get rid of the proximity to hook minus if hes by someone who doesn't have a hook timer. the killer will lose if hes camping someone who literally wont die till after 3 others escape so theres no need for it. they could also increase it based on the amount of survivors left. so if he camps someone who doesn't have a timer whileall 4 are alive, he loses 0/sec cuz he's gonna lose anyway if he camps someone who doesn't have a timer while 3 are alive, he loses 1/sec. something like that. i feel like the issues this could raise are easily fixed while the issues by not having it are near impossible to fix
---
Holy shit
---
nice criticism. i see why my idea is so bad now

What About teleport survivor right on hook ? ü§î
---
TRANSCRIPT/ADDITIONAL NOTES
---
THE DELINQUENT( alex delarge)
---
POWER: ULTRAVIOLENCE
---
‚Äúwhat‚Äôll it be then, eh?‚Äù
---
alex‚Äôs time romping around the streets during witching hour has honed his fighting skills, particularly with his trusted cane.
---
THE DELINQUENT can target ONE OF FOUR of a survivor‚Äôs body parts.
---
targeting the HEAD will cause the survivor to see intermittent blinding flashes, with [all] noises being 25% louder.
---
targeting the ARMS makes actions 30% slower, and [the survivor] can no longer emote.
---
[targeting the] BODY [will cause] hook degeneration [to be] 20% faster, [and all] aura perks [to last] 0.5s longer.
---
[targeting the] LEGS [means that survivors] can no longer vault [over windows or pallets].
---
i‚Äôd ran out of space on my paper here; oops!
---
i thought alex (from kubrick‚Äôs ‚Äúa clockwork orange‚Äù) would be a cool idea for a killer. i‚Äôm not sure how well he‚Äôd get on with the legion, though ‚Äî he‚Äôd probably dismiss them as american scum.
---
as for his power ultraviolence, i thought the basic idea would be that it‚Äôs activated when alex swings his weapon (his cane), with a pre-determined target; actually hitting would be one of four different buttons assigned to each body part. it would last until a survivor was hooked, and although a survivor could get to full health with it active, the power would still apply. 
---
i‚Äôm not too sure about the percentages, though. i‚Äôm not really a numbers person.
---
any/all feedback is appreciated! :o)
---
I can't imagine how anyone over 8 years old can have fun doing this kind of shit. Fucking buttholes.
---
Nightmare on Elm street 6.... or whatever everyone else says.
---
so Im still wasting time looking for what could just be bone remains
---
These two with Empathy, Inner Strength, and a sceptic is alot of evil fun!
---
Our time has come
---
Oni‚Äôs wig flying off when I head on‚Äôd him definitely made me smile (and laugh my ass off)!
---
When I first saw nemesis and blood echo I thought it would be the plague perks everyone was scared of with him. Infectious fright and dark devotion just seem to go so well with them. Freaking 0 terror radius insta kill machine that always knows were you are lol
---
That would be great!  y0vr face is my tag.  That's a zero in the tag
---
Why is the no collision thing a nerf? Was spirit players just phasing until they hit resistance to detect survivors?
---
I use urban evasion and spine chill all the time. Spine chill lights up for more than a second I sneak behind an obstacle and if the killer comes looking for me because he knows someone is in the area I just circle around it to not be found then get right back on the generator once they're gone. Nothing wrong with it unless you're using it the entire game all over the map.
---
It‚Äôs for bloody cosmetics only, there is no gameplay effect at all, except maybe being harder to see (Claudette for example).
---
they said it was unfair due to the fact that they could accidentally bump into you and get a free hit
---
Can you permanently destroy all his traps?
---
Groovy
---
Hatch is a bad mechanic and desperately needs a rework
---
Well luckily the topic is the different roles.
---
No because the Deep Wound timer only goes down when the Survivor stops moving.
---
Some fries motherfucka
---
Gotcha. Thanks
---
the man on the hook isn't another objective to track. its one less person doing gens. this would likely not effects killers much at all but would make solo surviving less punishing
---
great job!! :oD i adore your linework!!
---
I‚Äôve not had it happen to me after the patch
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs the 80s suitcase and not the previous event cosmetics they added?
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
this shit is so infuriating, and anyone who does it deserves to be banned.
---
Ah nevermind, im playing on switch and the hotfix is coming to my platform a little bit later. Oh well
---
pretend to farm and then nae nae them
---
Thank you! I'm going to use these tips and practice tonight!
---
Thats it, i'm getting me mori.
---
Ah shoot you‚Äôre right :\
---
True, I hate this scenario also with both chainsaw killers haha.
---
I love how the person above you acts like an entitled shit and presumes to cover it up with some spicy vocab and then literally does nothing to respond. Fuck that kind of person they aren't worth your time.
---
I enjoyed your views on the pig for what it's worth
---
*inclusives
---
Just a tip, players who actually used codes have the items in there steam INV. so you can place them on you're item showcase to prove they are legit
---
The leg target seems a little too powerful. Idea for a change instead it can be that the survivor periodically gets skill checks while running (Gen sized) and if they miss they stumble losing some speed for .5 seconds and be extended with addons up to 1.5 seconds. Pallets, vaults and Dead hard have priority over the skill checks so you don‚Äôt accidentally stumble. Only activates while running (walking and crouching don‚Äôt count). Could be affected by unnerving maybe?
---
Survivor bad killer good
---
Every time I see these cosmetics now ik it's going to be such an easy game, all the meh players are using them bc they where cool, and now all the people with exclusives are using other cosmetics
---
According to the votes, people don't like stories that are slightly different
---
If it's one game, I don't think it's bannable. If he does it every game and forces players to farm I think that's when it's bannable.
---
More killer entitlement right there. 
---
You are not entitled to a 4K. You don‚Äôt want a hatch escape? Close it before the survivor can get in.
---
Double discordance?
---
I'll try to find it
---
Ave, amicus
---
This game would feel so smooth if you didn't get yanked back by windows
---
Ngl most of these changes sound horrendous. Who exactly is out there complaining about Billy where we need to nerf him? I hope to god literally none of these changes go through except maybe 3 of the addons.
---
He was toxic all game. he got hit by 3 ds's and tunneled me really hard. If I were him i wouldnt chase me the whole endgame collapse. He also couldve messaged me or just be friendly, but he didnt.

bad ppl deserve to have their free will taken away as soon as they prove that theyd use it to choose evil. which is partly what jail is about, but i refer to legal evils as well

---
I got this first try by just killing 2 as wraith, sitting on hatch till they got all gens done then just killed them both with noed.
---
My opinion is that it isn‚Äôt.
---
I think you really just got to get lucky. I actively tried all night one night with blood warden and came really close but never got it. Then the next night I just played normal killers that I like obviously with NOED equipped and just got lucky one match. One was dead and the remaining three were overly altruistic, I down one right as last generator gets fixed the other two came in to heal them and I ended up downing them also, ran to the furthest door opened it up came back and hook 2 and carried the last one to the door. Just keep NOED equipped and try and play a good match. I did this at rank 8.

Survivor is hard simply because (outside of SWF) you can still be a massive team player with being able to perfectly balance gens, chases, and unhooks, but fail because of your team's shortcomings. You can run a killer around for what should approximately be 2 gens or more, but it doesn't really mean anything when you have blendette's crouch walking around the map to find Ruin or jump in a locker because Spine Chill lit up for one hundreth of a second. Even in more casual/less competitive SWF groups, it's a lot less painful because people know what to do, when they should do it, and how they should go about doing it.
---
Dude he was probably just trying to get u to step in the traps you were only one left with hatch up I wouldn‚Äôt just walks way either if I was close to challenge. Have u done the 5 trap one it‚Äôs not easy everyone just disarms them constantly it‚Äôs fucking hard if you‚Äôre not at rank 20

Lmaoooo
---
oh, woah! i prefer your idea by far; good for keeping survivors on their toes!
---
being affected by unnerving is great too. i could definitely see that being a popular perk! thanks for the comment :o)

There was a big comment section here a few weeks ago desperately calling for Billy nerfs. People were actually being upvoted for saying his chainsaw should only deal one state of damage

---
" Oh I really like this killer I think I'll just go straight to p3!"
---
This is obviously horseshit
---
Please learn to be more discerning
---
Everytime the killer does this I can tell they think they are so unbelievably funny every time, like "wow dude I had no idea you were going to do that! I thought the spirit with prayer beads was going to simply let me go! You sure got me"
---
I haven't been paying attention. What happened (I knew about the legion nemesis combo in the ptb) what changed?
---
And leave you behind?
---
Never.
---
I appreciate it &lt;3
---
Tbh Billy is easy to counter and has weak spots ect 
---
Unlike spirit , hopefully they don't nerf Freddy or Billy
---
Is there in game voice chat? As a killer can I speak and taunt players? That would be amazing, if it carried the voice through the world without direction detection.
---
ITS NOT ENGLISH
---
You're, not your.
---
That's fair
---
They can't make this stricter because of queue times, which also kills their game.

Then don't try to body block. I don't see your point. Mad Grit only pauses the wiggle timer when hitting a survivor, and Perfect Organism only goes up to 15 seconds of exposed.
---
I knew something was off earlier
---
Wait, you can do this again?
---
Then you had uncoordinated/shit survivors. What platform do you play on?
---
" no I just don't get into longer discussions with people that are clearly toxic as shit. "  
---
\- Says the person who immediately goes into a long post and resorts directly into toxic commentary.   
---
" you responded with a snarky over the top response. "  
---
\- You forgot accurate. My post was very accurate.   
---
" Pig was never good, ever. "  
---
\- Pig still has over a 50% kill rate (actually 65% now that I checked again) across all levels of gameplay. Any points you make are moot given that data from BHVR.   
---
"Now as for the stats, the same stats that put nurse... NURSE... at bottom of the tier list."  
---
\- Straight up BS. LMAO. [Look at the stats](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/) and try again. She not the bottom in terms of kill rate, not even NEAR the bottom. Nurse is at the bottom of red ranks, Clown is at the bottom of all ranks.   
---
"And the way BHVR sees the stats, piggies across the board get a lot of kills, so they see no reason to change it. "  
---
\- I agree they should change it, but not to make her or any killers stronger. I'd call a 65% kill rate across all levels of gameplay pretty darn high for what you called a "killed" character.   
---
" So I've wasted way too long on this, especially as I still don't think this is going to change your view on me or my thoughts on piggy "  
---
\- You'd be right, you have wasted your time. You've demonstrated to me that you don't understand statistics or game balance, and you set out to try and change someone's mind rather than look at facts objectively and attempt to interpret them, choosing instead to indulge in your own cognitive dissonance on the subject. You spent way too much time trying to make excuses for the stats rather than simply accepting them.   
---
You are *not* entitled to a 4 k. You *should* have to work hard for a 4 k, and a 70% kill rate across all levels of game play puts pig in a favorable position when she goes into any game.   
---
Imagine being a survivor, going into a game, knowing your chance of survival is about 35%.   
---
\*gasp\*
---
For huntress I think they just need to fix hit boxes , there are certain boxes and loops even though you can see the survivor but you can‚Äôt throw the hachet through
---
Honestly agree. It's a catch 22 for the devs. I would much rather have games with higher ranks (whether I'm playing killer or survivor) than wait 30+ mins for a lobby at all.
---
Curious how you only have so many aurics and serum considering you're up to tier 70.
---
Did you spend all you got from the rift?
---
You wont win every game, play at prime times and youl get better matchmaking
---
youl also learn more from getting bodied than by bodying
---
Both PC and Xbox. I swap between them depending on how I feel.
---
Loop is love, loop is life. But tbh they really need to change survivor gameplay just a bit. The Main reason I try to grab the killers attention so I have a Good excuse over why I am not doing gens. Really hope OOO gets on Shrine soon
---
It‚Äôs a different David jacket
---
I don't know why, but he's so much louder in the shop.
---
With the recent statistics that BHVR has shown, killers in all ranks have been able to kill 60% of the time (3~ ish kills) per game on average. Obviously that‚Äôs not enough to say survivors are weak or killers are strong but you could maybe say there is a potential correlation showing killers are slightly stronger atm.
---
Edit:spelling
---
you wake up in a long hallway and the first thing that you see is this meg charging at you at 60km/h
---
what do you do?
---
that's a BHVR debuff when you play NOED so it's not too powerful, making also the challenge impossible to do !
---
So you would be fine with it if they just changed the flavor text on Oni's power?
---
Well when life gives you lemons *unzips pants*
---
I actually take off my headphones when searching for a match because oh my god he's so loud...
---
Explanation: Dark Devotion is a killer obsession perk that makes it so when you hit your obsession you give them a 32 meter terror radius while setting yours to zero. It's very fun on legion due to their height and appearance making them look like survivors from a distance. Walking up to survivors on gens will often allow you to get a grab or at hit in if survivors aren't attentive enough.
---
Just play a killer you enjoy playing and you're good at and the rank will go up in no time üòâ
---
Killers are the power role apparently.....
---
Could you share the link ? Would want to see who wanted him nerfed
---
Imo it won‚Äôt *directly*win you a game if everyone know what to do over any other perks (DS getting you free/Deliverance getting you off the hook/etc) but it makes the game a whole lot easier for everyone though in a solo environment if that makes sense
---
It's pretty funny.
---
Funny how anytime someone dishes out facts, another person's response is "you just don't play X". Which isn't true in the slightest, not that you'd believe any of that.   
---
Sorry you don't get your 4k just because you say you deserve it (aka: entitlement). Hatch system is a risk system, you either slug and risk someone getting back up, or you hook and risk someone escaping if they find the hatch first. It's not supposed to be *easy*. You're supposed to work hard for that 4k.
---
The slowest gen build to exist. He got 2 addons that make everything slower now combine that with ruin, thanphobia, pop goes the weassle and dying light. The game can take up to 10 mins with no gen progress
---
During the dev stream they said it will be more like a year
---
I feel like it changes all the time. Last week I couldn‚Äôt win at all, but these past couple days I‚Äôve been escaping with at least one other if not all of my teammates. Some games I still get screwed but I‚Äôve had a lot more good ones lately. Not sure what‚Äôs goin on
---
Nemesis used to work on the legion, because it brought back the old cheese where you could down survivors by just following them without chasing them while they have deep wounds.
---
However, BHVR "fixed" this, by changing deep wounds entirely. Now the timer for deep wounds is not connected to the terror radius anymore, because the timer doesn't go down anymore, while the survivor is running. Which makes a whole lot of sense...
---
the game shouldn't have a mechanic that puts certain players in actual physical pain. I want my character to get ripped to shreds, not my fucking finger
---
Bruh, you're gonna get so many complaints doing that, XD

Survivor really is not that hard, you can waste time and still win, but if you waste time as killer you'll probably lose.
---
I'm pretty sure mouse and keyboard input is blocked on console because it would be an advantage, correct me if I'm wrong
---
Honestly a great movie and I'd highly recommend it. The killer has the same style and vibe as dbd's legion with his appearance and the way he "moves" around the movie, similar weapon and idea of the killer
---
Regardless, to trail every survivor for 20 seconds is to assume every survivor has DS, and in that worse-case-scenario survivors will just stop running DS and get trailed for free. And it's certainly less effective than just slugging the survivor for 60 seconds, which is what you can do right now.

She's far not the worst, but definitely not the best. The common consensus is that pig was in a pretty good place, but BHVR nerfed her out of nowhere. It was a small nerf overall, but was overall unnecessary, and with no reason given.

Her perk will eventually get on the shrine, for now just focus on leveling every character you do have to 40. A good build with just the starting characters is, Unbreakable (Oni addition causes lots of slugging) or Adrenaline (its on the shrine rn actually), Borrowed Time, Sprint Burst is alright but theres better perks and you don't HAVE to run an exhaustion perk for example, Prove Thyself is a really good one. Iron Will is a massive underrated perk. Dark Sense is good if you like to see where the killer is. All of these you can have without dlc's
---
Decisive Strike is also on the shrine right now, if you think you would ever use it I would grab it.
---
Balanced Landing is less OP since the nerf, so if you have Feng Min, Lithe is 10x better
---
Try Iron Will instead of self care! Its good esp when you have a spirit!
---
I love how killer mains always have this victim complex even though they are usually the architect of their own demise. Maybe if you don't tunnel as pig they wouldn't feel the need to nerf her.

You mean comparing Ash and Steven Crowder, or Bruce Campbell and Steven Crowder, both of whom are actors? They were just comparing looks, but personalities are important too.

Speaking of which, what IS your point exactly, or ‚Äòidea‚Äô? It just seems like everything you accuse me of you‚Äôre doing, but you‚Äôre just getting angrier and angrier the more you‚Äôre going on. Maybe you should just stop. Reading the word salad you typed up, it seems like you don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre saying. Besides, people were being defensive and sensitive. Everyone is open to criticism. You just criticized me, or attempted to, and they denied Steven Crowder did anything in his past when it‚Äôs a documented fact. When I pressed them on it, they shut down. Just like you‚Äôre getting now, you‚Äôre getting extremely upset and your talking points are devolving into nonsense.
---
Could the hatch have possibly desynced? I remember seeing a post on here where a survivor jumped through a closed hatch because on the killer's screen it was closed but on the survivor's it was opened. Did you see him open the hatch?
---
Lol nah man you need to play Friday the 13th if you want to do that.  There is no voice chat built into the game natively period.  In swf groups they just use party chat built into consoles for swf communication and PC uses discord usually.  Even then that would just be for talking survivor to survivor.  
---
Also take a lot of what people say on this post with a grain of salt.  Anytime a player asks about playing fair or actually caring about the experience of the opposing side it draws the roaches out from under the fridge who relish in popping on here to say something like
---
"It's a killers job to kill do it by ANY means necessary.  They basically just play weak cancerous games and say that shit to justify their trash camps and tunneling off hook.  I appreciate the fact that you remember there are human beings on the other side of the gamepad and you aren't trying to Ruin the fun of all parties involved.  Killers like that typically improve much faster at the game since they don't rely on baby strats to get their kills.  Not camping and tunneling will teach you so much more about the game and allow for fun competitive games for both sides.  You'll get way less salt post game than others too
---
Ever since the pallet rework you can't just barrel through pallets, you basically have to mInDgAmE and know which pallets are safe. You used to be able to slap on Enduring and SF or Brutal Strength and pepega but now if you kick every pallet on the map gens are gonna get done way before you clear them all.

---
Unpopular opinion, but there are times when tunneling is just the most effective way to approach the game. It has nothing to do with the survivor or even the killer, it's just a matter of "Do I want to chase the person who isn't hurt, and who is going to be more difficult to down, or do I want to chase the person who will drop after one more hit?"
---
It's absolutely no different than the survivor who runs those specific looping patterns between pallets or environmental objects to keep the killer from catching them. It's not fun for either player, but it's effective and it's the best way to win and/or get bloodpoints.
---
Then there are the people who do it out of spite or just sheer maliciousness. Can't excuse them.

I personally think that Keen Eye needs a small nerf, maybe you can't use it while running? I also agree with the comment above, I think the killer needs something else for his power. I would really like to use this concept in a fan made ideas compilation that I've been working on recently, and you'd be credited. If you want access to the doc dm me your email, and if I have any other questions I'll let you know

---
I thank you for your insight.
---
Honestly? I think this community is way too prescriptive and unwilling to allow for any deviations in opinion. I think the idea that Wraith is top tier and better than Billy is ridiculous, but who cares? There are people with dumber opinions out there, hell plenty of my opinions would be called dumb by a not insignificant number of people. 
---
It‚Äôs like, if you think that perks like Bitter Mumur or Kindred or Surge or whatever have their place and aren‚Äôt terrible, people will call you a stupid noob and tell you that if you‚Äôre not running all meta perks you might as well just bend over and let the other team have their way with you. 
---
I‚Äôm not a Tru3 fan either btw, and I disagree with pretty much all of his opinions. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad that he has them, hell I‚Äôll be happy to see more Wraith at high ranks instead of the same three or four killers over and over. That said he‚Äôs guilty of this as well so I wish he‚Äôd take his own advice a bit.
---
I dunno why you‚Äôre getting downvoted for your opinion, but your not wrong
---
I love Oni and it hurts to say this but he has no counterplay right now. You can even do 180 degrees turns rn because his key binds and mouse stack when trying to curve. Behaviour already said this is unintentional and will be fixed.
---
Indeed
---
Being able to manipulate your position is a ridiculous amount of fun and makes Freddy feel unpredictable and powerful.
---
I also like the idea that the more the gens are powered and the closer they are to escaping, the less power Freddy gets over the survivors. Just reminds me of some Dream Warrior level shizz.

 Edit: in all seriousness though, we were literally body blocking, giving the killer plenty of chances to attack someone else, and they absolutely refused to attack anyone. So it wasn't really a matter of who to get out, it was definitely the killer only going for a single person

Avoid insta down killers as youll get less malicious because you wont be hitting them as much and you ll get less chaser because youll be ending chases quickly. Ghost face is pretty good but his playstyle is a bit knowledge dependent so if you want something easier freddy is the way to go

Tall killers do have a higher POV and can therefore potentially spot survivors better, however, short killers have an advantage too. They may be harder to spot and can mindgame easier on loops with higher walls.

When you're playing pig, and someone was just pulled off the hook, and you activated ely try dodging around people I stead of attacking, so you can only go for a single player, it's kinda malicious at that point. She definitely had ample opportunities to attack other people, but only focused on one person the entire match.

yeah ruin/corrupt less experience at higher ranks is like that for me, end a chase against a decent survivor and 2 gens pop at the same time with 1 almost done lol, gotta rely on the survivors 3 genning themselves
---
Billy is absolutely fine except that I don't find fair do be body blocked when he fails a chainsaw so I don't make it anywhere and get chainsawed after even though he made a mistake.
---
Lol imagine not expecting every killer on console to not have ruin and noed together
---
How is it any different really, apart from being marginally quicker to mend now?
---
As a survivor you still have to mend before you can do anything useful, and the timer didn‚Äôt deplete in a chase anyway
---
I don‚Äôt see how it makes a significant difference, it just stops him potentially abusing the new perk
---
Absolutely you can blame the killer.  He's voluntarily participating in this trash.  He doesn't get a free pass to break dev policy just because the survivors are also scumbags.  It's equally on killer and survivors in this scenario.  It takes two to dance.  .
---
&gt;Oh yay you get 5 points for wiggling the problem is fixed yes
---
I mean... Unless you AFK in corners you will have a decent BP scoring as survivor. 
---
What people actually want is get 30k BP for soloing generators.
---
I must have missed the interesting part.
---
&gt;Picture of screen instead of screenshot
---
Because I'm on console
---
Also I forgot I had the perks on, the point was I had no crutch perks and running insidious is pretty much a joke because pigs a stealth killer
---
no sir. 20k being the best. Like I played the best on my team. On average I'd say it's about 15k. and when I'm getting 50-60k as a killer, I'd say that's unfair
---
The third person (16) looks like someone who has some experience. He has multiple rank 3 perks from different survivors maybe has something to do with it. Not sure.
---
Yesterday a Yui saved me 2 times using that perk, thought it's complete trash but that game changed my mind
---
Bro, Yhorm is the easiest boss in Dark Souls 3. Those rank 20s are going to destroy you. :D
---
Keep me updated
---
He's the most pepega brain killer in the game, just abuse the power to get free hits and don't commit to chases. Come back when power is up while they're healing, easy downs.
---
Of the picture?
---
Heres the secret to all button mashing games. It's not about pressing it with your thumb or finger. Instead, you use your whole forearm. You lock your hand &amp; thumb into a position just above the button, then flex your forearm super tight and it will start to vibrate. Since your thumb is so close to the button, the vibrate will result in you pressing the button exceptionally fast.
---
It's a bit goofy, but it works. This is the secret to ultimate button mashing speed.
---
Is that first one lightborn or shadowborn?
---
The only thing that needs to change on Billy is his addons, instasaw is one of the most OP things in the game
---
Shadow for the 9% fov increase
---
I just noticed that the flashlight itself flashes every second you use it.
---
Mood
---
Turn that poop into wine
---
When you do 3 gens, loop the killer for 3 minutes and get hooked when 1 gen is left and your teammates just let you die...worst feeling ever.
---
I was stuck ina gen multiple times but only in kyf after picking up a survivor I just got teleported a few meters away and the survivor was at the ground I let his teameates heal im of course because he freed me
---
&gt; no sir. 20k being the best. Like I played the best on my team. On average I'd say it's about 15k. and when I'm getting 50-60k as a killer, I'd say that's unfair
---
You keep including BBQ in your math... sir. Base points vs base points the devs brought survivors earnings a little closer to killer.
---
Even dying as obsession now nets you 1k BP.
---
Then the post wouldn‚Äôt be posted because that‚Äôs genuinely a bad idea.
---
I kinda find it funny how he went from probably having some of the strongest end game potential, including his own perks to having one of the worst end games and also having kinda bad synergy with his perks.
---
Hit: Ahhuuhuuuhuhu 
---
Hooked: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Not being able to see jack shit will make it more frustrating not scarier. 
---
If you spend a lot of time on a game it is obviously not going to be scary anymore. I don‚Äôt know why some people on this sub act like this is some surprise, because this is true of any horror based game. The jump scares or sense of dread is not going to get you the fiftieth time you play Dead Space or the twentieth time you play Silent Hill (unless you‚Äôre a massive pussy). This is the same case with DBD, it‚Äôs obviously not going to scare you once you learn the game mechanics and things like that. Making me not being able to shit is not going to make the game any scarier, and making it too dark to see Trapper‚Äôs traps isn‚Äôt any better.
---
Because it's a team game. Sometimes ya just get shitty teammates lol
---
I've gone struggle to Meg's not wanting to waste their sprint burst, so they slow walk across the fucking map as the killer is on the complete other side in a chase. Now that's a "I'm killing myself" moment.
---
Remember when you used to be able to loop a killer for 5 gens and still pip?
---
Emblem system is trash.
---
it‚Äôs a perk. it‚Äôs a hex so it is tied to a totem but you only know which one after the gens have been done
---
Are you dumb dbd isn't a scarc game and doesn't try that would just be unfair
---
My Surveillance makes 3-gens especially deadly, and my Discordance cleans up anybody that tries to make a quick gen rush. 
---
But yeah, only having snares or pallets at end game does suck (Freddy can use his snares to block off exit gates in an EGC against 1 player, though). Freddy's pretty much the only killer who doesn't have his power both at the beginning and end of the match, but for some reason he's the only killer whose presence is literally all but telegraphed to survivors when the match starts (since the hud shows the dream timer when the match starts).
---
Honestly some of his older videos are still great if you want some insightful thought to spark discussion, but it's very obvious in his later videos that he's grown tired of the game and is far too cynical for his own good.
---
His video about "the truth about camping" is actually pretty good, among others including some of his older tier lists. But all his newer ones are just overly cynical and painful to watch.
---
I love this üòÇ
---
Me but trying to level Yui and Oni at the same time.
---
you're one of them right? simple, if you dodge you're a pussy. that's all. bring a mori instead. i hope you get dodged everyday from now on. hope you like it then
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Hag is D tier even weaker than Spirit. Should play a top tier Killer like daddy Myers you noob.
---
First prize motherfucker
---
Gotta love Myers! I love those jump scares outta nowhere!
---
When you rebel against the entity
---
None of those are particularly similar. Sharing mechanics is pretty damn common in games since, you know, the mechanics make the game. Every chapter adds some mechanics and expands on others. Micheal added Obsessions for example. People also compared MM and Leatherface to Billy. He's not *that* similar just because he can run. Lots of killers can instadown. Is he really similar to Leatherface because he can instadown multiple survivors?
---
Man, streamers and content creators do this all the time. All my favorite ones, too. It becomes frustrating to watch lol
---
Lol...what the hey?
---
Self Care is nowhere near S tier but it's still very good. People are too quick to hop on the sElFcArE wAsTeS tImE train nowadays. You know what wastes more time than Self Care? Being dead. Nothing pisses me off more than that one guy who goes down constantly cause they don't have Self Care or Iron Will as a loud-ass Survivor and have no idea how to play stealthy.
---
Good job, but You missed a good opportunity to use Kristmas Kate, or Kandy Kane Kate  :)
---
Oni tracking betrays him since you dont know if their fresh or where their going.
---
His power when hes in it is stronger than bullies except for anti loop since Billy's saw does actually end loops because the curve mechanic.
---
Oni is temporary, Billy is forever.
---
It's like trapper being sometimes stronge3 than nurse... for example a good basement or a nasty 3 gen and a bunch of traps work almost at once.
---
Does this make tapper the new number 1 killer? No.
---
Consistency is better than occasional spike of power.
---
"Renders the chainsaw silent"
---
Damn
---
Jeffsus
---
All rise motherfucker
---
Not necessarily, they'll close down when matchmaking doesn't work anymore.
---
Dbd has so low loading times at waiting for players but would be nice for killers waiting to create a lobby
---
What happens when you bought it
---
If the killer ever gives up a chase where more than 1 gen is done, the game is essentially over lol. You often spend as much time finding the next survivor as you do finishing the current one. It's totally RNG and non-skilled based whether it's the right choice or not to give up a chase, but 80% of the time it's not.
---
The problem is, there are certain loops that are too good and can't be "left", as in you try chasing someone else, they too will go to that same loop and do the same thing, so there's no point in switching targets a lot of time if the loop is just vault spots and not pallets.
---
I like giving it if they played well. I almost always do, I like to put positivity out there and you usually get nice messages.
---
Wouldn't let me unfortunately.
---
If they did this even less people would want to play killer because they cant dodge bullshit items without getting penalized and your queue times would be even worse
---
Sad
---
Wholesome moments like this make the game worth it.
---
You mean "gg piece of shit"
---
Haha yeah, that's a good idea :) and thanks!
---
Yea, while I guess you could say Freddy's rework "worked" in making him a good killer, it really does seem like they got kinda lazy with him and just gave him half a dozen powers and said, there now he can't be bad.
---
While it's "not allowed" it's not like your ruining the game for anyone hence their not being much fuss about it.
---
It's rare when I see a killer do it and I'm always a little suspicious of an endgame build with the way many killers go about it.
---
As a survivor I don't find it very fun but hey I'm maxing out my bloodpoints so I'll take it.
---
As a killer it seems the survivor's are usually very worried of the aforementioned endgame build and usually just go for a fast win.
---
I had this bug once at killer I just thought that it just wasn't shown to me after I hit the survivor it spawned and after I killed him I asked him about it and he said that the hatch didn't spawn at him either
---
This is why I (playing killer) always go for the sandbaggers lol
---
Where was he?
---
Ikr?, I finished it yesterday, you feel accomplished, But now I don't have a goal in mind so I'm able to return to normal gameplay and not sacrifice my entire team because I'm chasing a killer with a flashlight and not doing gens
---
nope, it's not about items. You could use Franklin's if that's your problem. people dodge certain survivors 'cause they maybe remember them from previous matches. this is not fair at all, bring a mori if you're scared of a P3 and bring franklin's if you don't want to deal with "bullshit items'". problem solved.
---
For survivor I like to run: Spine Chill, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time/Breakout
---
For killer I usually play Plague, and I run: Ruin, Pop, BBQ and Infectious Fright.   
---
I usually run add ons that increases the effectiveness of the vomit and an apple.
---
Yeah if I know it‚Äôs a SWF group I‚Äôm going to leave because I wanna play this game to have fun, not to deal with a try hard team. Also mori? Thats unarguably worse than lobby dodging. What a fuckin goober
---
I never really come across it but I understand your turmoil and why you posted this.  Just because there‚Äôs  a P3 Claudette (or any character) in the lobby doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll be a good player. Rank does indict some level of skill but it depends mostly on playtime. Unless someone is just total trash you‚Äôll get to red ranks with time for the most part. Last I heard they are gonna implement some sort of penalty...not sure though. People should just deal with it...play the game and move on ya know?
---
For sure
---
This is some weird shit
---
Yeah but the guy on the hook is free. Borrowed Time makes sure of that
---
lmao keep being a trash killer then, have "fun" dodging you pussy
---
Haha, at least Charmander is a adorable Pok√©mon
---
Right on dude! Good job!
---
My girl got this glitch, essentially if you buy anything it won‚Äôt unlock anything else and once you refresh to the main screen it‚Äôs like nothing happened
---
finally someone with a brain.. it's kinda upsetting to be dodged more games in a row, kinda boring too.
---
Yikes
---
didn't make sense to live that long
---
cant stand these non-toxic moments
---
Good luck out there
---
Damn I didn‚Äôt know being rank 2 was being a trash killer. You learn something new everyday. Have fun being the epitome of what‚Äôs wrong with the games community tho  &lt;3
---
While you‚Äôre only using generic, I‚Äôd recommend thrilling tremors (debatably better than bbq), sloppy butcher, whispers (only once you get level 3), and I‚Äôm all ears. Sloppy for slowdown and to keep survivors injured, thrilling and whispers for reliable info at all stages of the game, and I‚Äôm all ears to end chases faster.
---
As a Kate main I love this...well done! It's adorable! üòä
---
When survivors are literally the same person, it's hard to choose which one to go after. Too many times I've accidentally went after the non-toxic survivor when I wanted to kill their toxic clone first instead.
---
How do I feel about farming? I think it's alright to farm as long as everyone else wants to but no killer should ever feel entitled to farm when the survivors don't want to.
---
I played a game a couple weeks ago against a Demogorgon who wanted to farm. My teammates started farming with him but I was doing gens because I really didn't feel like taking a long time to farm with the killer when I could just be playing a proper game. He hooks the 3 survivors twice each and then came over to me who was completing my third gen. I didn't want to give him a free hook so I started looping him, something I actually enjoy doing and I looped him around the shack for about 3 to 5 minutes until my "teammate" came over and threw the shack pallet in front of me so I couldn't get out the door which allowed the Demogorgon to hit me. Then she kept sandbagging me when I moved onto a nearby jungle gym and the Demogorgon downed me and put me on a hook to where she unhooked me and he downed me again and picked me up. I had DS so I stunned him and then looped him for a few more minutes until he eventually downed me and camped me on the hook until I died.
---
He let the rest of them escape after that. I don't really care anymore but he obviously felt entitled to me participating while he and my teammates were messing around. I didn't want to DC because I didn't want to depip and all I wanted to do was to get out of the game as soon as possible but whatever.
---
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know memes these days need perfect quality. As if I would take the time to take a picture of the Oni at the exact right position, perfectly crop his giant hair and make the hair actually look like is behind the kids back. This is a shitpost, Not some beautifully made animation. Let me remind you that a shitpost is supposed to be trollishly poor quality.
---
LOL after he enters the game with u, does he do his best to reveal ur position to the killer and then teabag u in front of the hook when u get caught?
---
why? you mean my =^,^= tattoo on the side of my finger?
---
edit: tried to write this cute face here but Reddit made it weird XD
---
I think it‚Äôs weird you have a problem with lobby dodging but not being tunneled and moried right at the start of a match
---
Just search up hero fighting huge monster meme on google for the picture
---
Do what makes you happy as long as you're not causing intentional harm, naturally. If you're the Killer and you want to farm then do it. I farm for certain challenges and rituals depending on their difficulty or tediousness such as damaging 40 gens or pallets, which was a nightmare so I just had a Survivor tap a gen, I kick it, they tap, I kick it, rinse and repeat. This was before they reduced it to 20 or whatever. I farm if there's DC early on and less than 3 gens are finished. Or I'll farm as a Killer if I've had a string of serious and competitive matches but I'm still in the mood to reel in those sweet points because I like to keep reaching the 1,000,000 cap and then go on level up sprees. I'll definitely farm if there's two or more party streamers offered and, again, I'm the Killer.
---
There's really nothing wrong with having the occasion friendly match. I've made friends through it and I like to play around in them as the Killer by doing stuff like throwing a ton of The Clown's bottles at Survivors while I let them work on a gen. Also applies to vomiting all over them and electrocuting them. With farming Trappers I'll go out my way to walk into their traps, be freed, and then walk into them again. Bonus points for Trappers who walk into their own traps when farming. Also friendly Ghostface t-bagging with the Survivors. I love that.
---
That was a great game buddy xD
---
Yeah I agree that is shitty. Not to mention having one person down can seriously fuck up everything for the rest of the team. It‚Äôs totally possible to still escape with just three but it can be a pain in the ass. If someone dodges/DC‚Äôs and ya got shitty teammates your fucked lol. No fun for anyone. I feel ya on this buddy
---
Still sad that people trash talk for others having opinions.
---
Are we talking weeks or months? I‚Äôm just asking because I was hoping to give the mugs to some buddies this Christmas.
---
You can deal with that in a sec. A free hook is still a free hook.
---
I play Huntress 90% of the time and the loadout is the classic one, Ruin, BBQ, Nurse's Calling and Whispers. I sometimes play Spirit too and I use Pop, Ruin, BBQ and Nurse's Calling. I rarely play Survivor but when I do it's Bill with Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, DS and We'll Make it, I like to have a build which can help my teammates but can work for me during chases and such
---
It's a feature, the dev's put it in the game

I hadn‚Äôt played in almost a month and before the month before that I hardly played at all so I‚Äôm rank 15 right now. 
---
I‚Äôve been left on my first hook to die four times in the last two days because everyone uses urban evasion and self care. I swear I‚Äôve watched about ten different people stay crouched or heal on the opposite side of the map that everything is happening since starting to play again.

---
Wholesome
---
so you lose to rank 20 survivors?
---
at least you play, you're not playing lobby simulator. You can still escape someone with a mori, there's still a possibility you're not getting hooked first. but at least you get to play. try to get dodged for 3 games in a row and spend 30 mins in lobby. fun, right?
---
Im rank 14 with most perks unlocked, had the game a few months (just araond the time plague came out) and never got past rank 10 survivor tho, still pretty bad at survivor :(
---
I am having this problem as well. My Xbox settings and my internet is working properly. But I checked 3 times anyway. I can still find a match after a while if I keep insisting but I get disconnected randomly on most of the matches I find. I submitted a ticket and they said they‚Äôre monitoring this and that some Xbox services might have some trouble right now.

Here's some additional information in regards to killer and survivor perk rankings.
---
Only the first round back i did,now i just get 4k‚Äôs cuz i got used to the demigorgon.(i know he‚Äôs a low tier killer but he‚Äôs fun to use)
---
Well sensitivity is all personal preference
---
You coward
---
Adding a temporary ban for lobby dodging would be stupid, there's many factors on why it shouldn't be added, 1 people should be able to decide what matches they want to play , 2 ping related issues, 3 encountering someone(or group) that was nasty in a previous match. I get where you're but banning for lobby dodging would be the worse choice BHVR could ever make.
---
Finally hit rank 1 after grinding out 70 games in red ranks. Super happy that I no longer have to try as hard to win games.
---
Keep in mind that there are 5 different variations of the Badham Preschool map. So it may seem to you that you have been sent there but in reality it's a different variation everytime, counting as a different map for the game to choose from
---
That‚Äôs kinda weird.
---
You're absolutely right but there is an absurdly strong feeling of entitlement amongst a lot of killer players that disconnecting from lobbies to cherry pick the groups they're willing to face isn't remotely wrong despite the fact you might have waited in a 10 minute queue for the pleasure of watching them dodge like cowards immediately.
---
It is a HUGE problem but they won't hear it.  They feel entitled to do it.
---
So i hit a survivor in the air after they ran off of the edge of the staircase, and then this happened. In the post game chat, they said i wasnt moving at all, and were confused as to why i stopped moving.  
---
I was stuck like this for about 7 mins.
---
You gonna make me type this up again you bozos?
---
Deacons of the deep
---
I love it when your working on a gen, looking around for the killer and all of a sudden he‚Äôs over there just staring at ya! Shit lol! Scares the fuck outta me but man I love it!! Scratched mirror Myers is fun to play and play against in my opinion at least.
---
Depip?
---
:)
---
Yea, playes 12 games today, and i kept track of all maps that i played on, got badham 6 times, sanctum of wreath only 3 times,2 coldwinds and 1 game
---
But he comes back right?
---
gj. face is a bit generic but I really like your art style
---
So they've just... nerfed The Legion even more and buffed Borrowed Time? The Legion was too weak before but that's ridiculous. There's little to no pressure now. That rework is desperate at this point.
---
I don't care what rank you are.  If you cower before survivors and flee in terror at the first sign of a remote challenge you aren't a good killer.  I don't know if you're trash but certainly not good.  
---
Just change your loadout/killer selection.  Devs show you lobbies so you can counter what you see with your loadout NOT so you can endlessly make players requeue in the Hope's of eventually being allowed to play the game.  Man up or switch to survivor.
---
Pips dont matter when you got the boys IMO
---
yes I intend to update the pack but for now happy clown who is the person who makes perks in color and he has not updated it yet

Lol I just clipped it from this vid https://youtu.be/lciujLlTEGY and when I saw this part it just reminded me of DBD

Oh lord i bet it was fun
---
Why not just grab her?
---
After the last 3 games I had this hurts me deep.
---
If I see a key I‚Äôm out I have been screwed over way too many times from keys
---
the problem is it doesn't really tell the whole truth by showing the Nurse as weakest bc the truth is nobody wants to play nurse which makes her look like the weakest usually the only ones that play nurses are the newer players. The players that know how to play nurse like me just never want to bc her gameplay is that boring
---
they got a temporary ban, it's time for killers to get theirs too
---
Check out /u/datsti‚Äôs comment, that solved it in 2 minutes
---
Well I mean should you be forced to play against something or someone you don't want to? I'm not sacred of anyone really I'm just getting my opinion on it. Also lobby dodging isn't a pussy move it's just someone doesn't want to play that match, or they're busy. Honestly your whole argument against everyone has just been bring a Mori or you're a pussy if you lobby dodge and honestly it's quite stupid
---
Thank you so much for sharing! I love yui sm! Also Im loving the sketchy aspect of it! Also the shading and the bike as well! Looks amazing üíï

You answered the question in the last section with "balance problems".

Which would be quickly abused by SWF's to great effect.

Did you watch the video

OP's mom
---
There was no prompt to grab her, and nothing happened when I tried to. It was really weird. She could only heal and get healed, but she couldn't move or interact with anything else as far as I know
---
His reveal is broken. You shouldn‚Äôt need to have it perfectly middle of screen. You should have been able to reveal him. Sometimes you can reveal him as he goes around a wall. Just shows the whole process is broken
---
No no it wasn't 3 games was huntress that for no reason wanted to tunnel me like I just locked eyes and the huntresses probably went "You oh yes you will not have fun today" the other 2 games was nurse that AGAIN JUST CHOSE TO TUNNEL ME DOWN I swear to god I didn't even act toxic
---
Alternatively, it's Yhorm the Giant from Dark Souls 3.
---
Difficulty is subjective and relative.
---
Going with number one:
---
Ash because obviously 
---
Bill because he is likely to sacrifice himself to save others. Also for an old guy he‚Äôs pretty strong, in the comics he fights his way out of a zombie infested hospital with no guns after being under the knife.
---
Claudette because she seems to have some medical knowledge that would be helpful in healing.
---
I love how her having her power broken is described as "fair" when without it shes a 110% speed killer. This community never disappoints me.
---
It‚Äôs literally also a waste of the killer‚Äôs time
---
Do you think they don‚Äôt also have to wait?
---
Do gens as the last survivor still up with the only other survivor on the map slugged.  Are you intentionally being absurd by offering advice designed to feed the game to the killer or did you misunderstand the scenario he was asking about?
---
Beautiful!
---
If you finish a gen - killer sees that - goes there - very probably finds you - you ded...
---
not very high iq play tbh
---
Be a cool idea yea if he could see in night vision and shit
---
I think it is supposed to be the way Ghostface is when In nightshroud when crouching
---
Discordance, STBL, BBQ, and then whatever perk my whimsy tells me to get.
---
Times like those, I just bring out Forever Freddy. Nice amount of time. :D
---
Slugging for the 4K will never be toxic no matter how much you stomp your petulant little feet
---
If we started doing things because they made "thematic sense", then Oni would auto mori you with a demon strike. So no.
---
Its never this extreme but something similar happens on console to me where when I get hit through a window or by a huntress hatchet that shouldn't have hit, the killer searches the area where they "hit" me but I actually went down nowhere near where they're searching.
---
No. I‚Äôve only been to around a year of art class, and it was a low effort drawing.
---
If you are looking for a game that is going to scare you; you‚Äôre better off playing a story based horror game. Those games are more tailored to build fear and suspense. Horror doesn‚Äôt technically mean that it has to be scary. Horror is meant to cause shock, disgust, and/or fear. Comedy horror movies and zombie movies are still considered horror movies, despite the lack of fear they cause you. Besides, there wouldn‚Äôt be much they could do to make the game any scarier without changes features. Making the game darker is just going to make the game harder to see, not scarier. Pretty much the only fear you‚Äôre going to get from DBD is the fear of being caught by the killer or the occasional jump scare.
---
That's some fresh bullshit you've got there.
---
&gt;If you finish a gen - killer sees that - goes there - very probably finds you - you ded...
---
&gt;not very high iq play tbh
---
Imagine... dying in a video game... the tragedy. People value escaping way too much in this game.
---
Doing a gen, sneakily going past the killer and making a run for the slugged player is not a bad play. Better than hoping the devs will do everything for us.
---
They hated Jeff Kaplan from the Overwatch team because he told them the truth
---
I use Corrupt Intervention, Ruin, Monitor and Abuse and Brutal Strength
---
People slugged less when the hatch didn't spawn automatically. Either pick up the slugs or do gens. Deal with it.
---
I try to go out of my way to compliment the killers after every game, but most of them have their messages turned off due to all the rage they usually get.
---
I got caught before NOED was active but after gens were done I saw a lit totem while dangling from the hook, I killed myself before my dummy randoms all died as well, especially since that killer was pure trash and noed was his only way of securing any kills.
---
Yeet
