That actually sounds like a great concept. When the Legion was first announced at the Game Awards I honestly thought they were going to be able to disguise themselves as a survivor. I want a killer thats can disguise itself. That would be awesome.

And the worst part is I really wanted to get good with her on PS4 so during the event I leveled her way past 50 to get the parks I wanted. I get stomped hard with her and I have 31 event cakes,12 BPS, and about 15 puddings so I have to keep getting stomped on till those are gone lol.

I mostly play survivor, but I enjoy killer much more. I am rank 1 on survivor every season, simply because I play it more. I float at rank 5 or so on killer, occasionally going up or down a bit. I never play nurse or billy. I primarily play pig, doctor, and now ghostface. I never need the op killer or the op basement camping strats. I often let 1 survivor go every game, just because that's what I like to do. The amount of times I actually get basement hooks is almost never. Only when I kill someone looking at shack. Even so, I wont camp or proxy camp them. I have though, been epically face camped or proxy camped on basement hooks when 4 or 5 generators remain. And you know what happens? Someone tries to save me, we both die. OR someone tries to save me, trades, and they die. OR they face camp me till I die. My survivor allies, whether in comma or not, find out im being face camped, leave me. And go finish gens. BUT. I die. And there are still gens left because my first hook is LITERALLY not enough time to deal 5 gens even with toolboxes. So. I died with no counterplay. That killer goes and gets someone else. Repeats the process. And what happens? Maybe the other 2 get out.  Maybe not. But still 2 people died with no counterplay and the killer got a nice pip or safety while 2 maybe 3 survivors depip because they can't get altruism and you dont get enough points for just doing a few gens.
---
Ill believe that when i see it. Ive went up against multiple nurse mains in the red ranks, and they've all been bullied and ran around the map for 5 gens. The state of console just doesnt allow nurse to be top teir. Its not the fact that people just suck with her, its the fact that consoles are so poorly optimized that is makes playing nurse reliably and consistently impossible. When dedicated servers hit, and the Devs optimize the game more, Nurse will probably become top teir on console, but until then, your better off playing Spirit.

I don‚Äôt think they care too much about the stories now, some people have paragraphs of story &amp; then characters like Meg have essentially an unfinished writing prompt for a backstory.
---
Ghostface is practically an entirely original chapter with licensed cosmetics.

That‚Äôs a good question. I honestly don‚Äôt know.

That's what got me thinking that this would be great! We also already have another john carpenter monster, so what's stopping another?

SWF?
---
Because when you are verses those survivors it doesn‚Äôt matter which killer you play. So most of this discussion is just based on his theoretical power. And theoretically you can get more use out of Trappers power with add ons than you can get out of Legions power ever. Even his ultra rare add on is pretty meh.
---
yhen i cant see the orange line :(

---
(Doesn‚Äôt stereotype people for using certain survivor skins) ‚ÄúHey look! That guy‚Äôs **weird**!‚Äù
---
1. Having whispers on nurse GREATLY decreases the time it takes to find a survivor. Also remember that you can still hit survivors by chasing them for a little bit (you‚Äôre long melee attack gives a bit of a speed burst), so you don‚Äôt always have to blink.
---
2. Try using a time watch to decrease fatigue time until you get better.
---
3. Sloppy butcher is great if you have trouble finding survivors after you blink.
---
4. Learn how to use the blinks properly. 1st blink is usually to cut the distance between you and the survivor, and the second hit is to confirm the hit, i.e. if the survivor tries juking/change direction, you can use the second blink. 
---
5. Nurse has a high skill cap and is frustrating to play. Learn her without add ons first, having add ons is detrimental, even if you‚Äôre a pro die to you developing a blink muscle memory, i.e how long you need to hold to travel a certain distance with a blink.
---
If survivors won‚Äôt do gens, the survivors will lose. The term survivors has 2 different meanings here.
---
I think at best it would slow down gen rushing by like 4 or 5 seconds tbh. You could easily just set up a code or something like "everyone tbag twice right now" or "point when you're close" and completely nullify any kind of confusion. Spine chill and premonition would also fuck them over really hard since they likely wouldnt make the killer immune to it. 
---
Just overall, the ability would work like once at very start and then be borderline useless for the remainder. Also I really doubt Bhvrs ability to have the killer properly take on the survivors customized appearance without a ton of glitches
---
Because usually they are.
---
I heard it was coming out on Netflix only a little bit after it comes out on tv but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
I see a lot more taxic Fengs.
---
&gt;it rewards you for playing bad
---
This is kinda not true. It activates regardless of how you play. And it does come with a tradeoff of having empty perk slot for the first part of the game. Just like Adrenaline.
---
A British gangsta goth is good enough on their own for a killer
---
Wait so for the second perk, once an exit gate is powered the other gate‚Äôs switch is blocked and the opened gate is blocked not allowing anyone to leave through it?
---
it's still pretty fucking funny
---
Hmm
---
I'm a Type-1 diabetic and if my blood sugar is even slightly off I tend to do awful. Something just makes me lose focus and fall for really obvious jukes and spins. 
---
I've actually caught my blood sugar going high/low from having a win streak as average killers like Wraith turn into losing 2 matches in a row horribly as Spirit.
---
Hopefully.
---
You can just do the tutorial as survivor and practice as long as you want
---
I thought so too
---
I'd drink nurses bathwater
---
Not really out of the realm of possibilities to get the actual rights to use The Thing. There's already John Carpenter material in the game with the Halloween chapter. I know they go through whoever owns the rights and not just John himself but I think they have the connections to get the rights if they wanted to.
---
Jokes on them I'm already both
---
I've encountered a few not as many as Nea and Claudette.
---
And this is why DC penalties are going to be nice. 
---
You don't care about your team and will gladly blade them if it means you get into a new lobby 10 seconds faster. 
---
Proper Penalties will mean that the above is the most efficient, and will at least wastes the killer time a bit longer for those who still want to be in that match.
---
"yeah I'm a break this fucking devour or ruin" haunted ground "weeeeeeeeeeeell tits"
---
First game is always the easiest because your playing against rank 20s. But still it‚Äôs cool for ya.
---
He is gonna be the worst killer once Freddy gets reworked. The only time I have ever won with him has either survivors being potato or them just disconnecting because it is Legion.
---
The two major contenders are Balanced Landing, and Dead Hard.
---
Dead hard will let you make plays, and also extend loops. Even if the killer knows not to swing at you, you can use the distance gained during a loop to get a few extra runs around it.
---
Balanced Landing turns dead-zones like hills and walkways into safe-zones, but you need to know the maps and your pathing really well to reliably utilize it.
---
The others:
---
Sprint Burst lets you ignore hits if you time it right, but you have to be careful about when to sprint when you have it equipted. 
---
Lithe will be basically a more situational Sprint Burst, it won't let you dodge hits nearly as often, but it won't be as hard to manage
---
Addrenaline ignores exhaustion so you can run it with others, but be warned that it'll mean you can use your other perk once the gens are done until your exhaustion resets. It's genuinely such a powerful perk that running it is almost never a bad idea, regardless of playstyle.
---
Head on is for memes and gimmick builds. A master can probably get some decent use from it every now and then, but it'll be generally less useful than most other perks.
---
The best
---
Actually no you can grab a healthy survivor you just need to tap the attack button
---
I main Billy when I play killer and I've never had a big issue with it. I think Lery's is way worse. I've gotten some of my nicest chainsaws on Haddonfield!
---
no, it‚Äôs an exhaustion perk
---
Maybe if you timed it so the ticks lined up perfectly, otherwise, no.
---
I don't know anyone that lewds the Hag. Then again I don't go on r/dbdgonewild very often. I do know that people love to lewd Susie, Julie, The Pig, The Nurse, The Spirit, The Huntress, and The Plague though.
---
Family guy reference
---
‚ÄúShut up Meg‚Äù
---
I'm trying not to use any add-ons to try to get the hang of it, also I'm doing a pretty dang well job getting in 2 hits before they get aways but locating is a hell of a task as Nurse. I actually do run Sloppy butcher, I've also been trying Stridor after I posted this to make locating even easier in chases after fatigue. I'll try out whispers once more but I'm really liking Stridor so far.
---
Is that a generator towards the basement of the suffocation pit?
---
Meg&lt;Kate&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;literally everyone else
---
Okay thank you for answering and good luck on killing those survivors
---
Or maybe make her like Freddy when she uses the addon? Completely silent phasing but she sort of appears and disappears during phase so you can still see her coming but it's a lot more difficult, and no terror radius while she's using her power? I think that's more balanced than not being to see or hear her at all the whole game.
---
I think this Beta is in its Alpha stages
---
Japanese or broken knees
---
Don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôve all been there as killer. Once you get to yellow ranks, it will get better. But once you get to green you‚Äôll need to work harder then ever cause that‚Äôs also where survivors also step up their game and know how to loop good

I love when they loop at the hook, simply genius.
---
For stating the most common reason for disconnects? No, I am just not a bitch and don't care about losing karma to state the truth. This subreddit is already the butt of every joke for anyone who has played the game since the beginning. The sheer balance decisions and complaints found on this very subreddit are completely laughable. The devs themselves even make jokes about this subreddit. It has nothing to do with ignoring the vocal but merely the type of players who congregate on here aren't to be taken seriously, so a whole lot of filtering has to happen.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I am just stating why you see streamers leave the match. Why you see your teammate who is getting tunneled off the hook while the other three survivors body block the killer to let him get away only for him to get downed again and he disconnects. Why at least half your survivors, if not all of them, disconnect whenever you play iridescent huntress or omega blink nurse. Its not because they are raging or being babies. It is simply to go to the next game to actually have fun.
---
The real fix would be to fix issues that are commonly labeled as "unfun" or "unfair" (that includes both killer and survivor sides mind you). I will not play a game that will frustrate me, so I will just move on. Again, big difference if it was a competitive game.
---
When you're about to grab a survivor but then you gotta feel ya boy's gains.
---
No. That's the pig. She draws her without the mask from time to time. I'm telling ya she loves those two to death. Just as I love the hag to death.
---
I mean more like they stop giving a fuck about the feel for the game, and/or start being TOO self-aware about the community. Stuff like a skin of Dwight in a baby costume, wacky hit effects that change the blood to sparkles and rainbows, dance taunts, and constant voicelines from each character.
---
Oh shit I totally forgot about Reddit. I was gonna make it into a deja vu joke. Guess that other guy finished it an other way.

Try setting the .ini to "Read Only" in the properties tab.

I main killer and there's only 2 things that piss me off:

1) Salty/cocky messages

2) T bagging at the hatch since it's entirely luck based.

If you do either, uninstall.
---
I didn't know there was a mod for this game that made it turn-based.

Ahhh I get it now, excuse my silliness :)

Youre good.

If a survivor knows the formula for distance between each loop and the killer speed and survivor speed they can male it impossble to be hit until all pallets are gone, i know a guy that does this at rank 1.
---
I love this
---
Please make some MS Paint concept art
---
The frame rate on console would make me sick in the cornfields :P
---
bri, get rid of your killer morals, you will do better as killer, chances are you arnt bad you are just trying to play "fair" but they wont, getting rid of morals will hep massivley
---
I just had a match where I hooked 3 people 3 times and the last one twice. No one escaped. 3 died on hook the last one got killed by the entity cause time was running out! I had 32k bloodpoints but didnt pip up twice! This is utterly broken imho!
---
First week impressions is down pat, they ain't changing though.
---
Yeah pre much gen rushing is a swf where a designated runner loops and the 3 survs move from gen to gen getting them each done in 25 seconds.
---
I just want to find the hatch someday.
---
How did they still lose?
---
Wait that‚Äôs illegal
---
Its a meme for a reason, this game has a long history of people telling killers how to play.
---
How is having 2 people DC fun?
---
All these apologetic killers in here. If you tunneled, you tunneled.
---
jump scare!!!
---
i disagree there are 3 options:
---
1. you wreck the team and dont use noed at all
---
2. survivors wreck you and noed dosent help very much
---
3. (very rare) noed actually gives you 3-4k
---
Once again NOED punishes the survivors for playing bad not for the game reaching a certain point, and I guess left behind "punishes" killer for 3 survivors being dead, oh hey same with sole survivor.
---
*‚ÄùI‚Äôm not hiding, I‚Äôm role playing!‚Äù*
---
So how does bond help about that?
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind seeing the addons get scrapped altogether. 
---
Some killers absolutely need good addons and some just don't and I don't think killers should have to run addons just to have a chance.
---
I'd like it if they took the F13 approach where the killers power just gets better over time. Which would punish survivors appropriately for taking to long on their objective and not punish them for doing their objective to fast (looking at you noed)
---
we've all gotta play to our strengths
---
Kept running into the same trap over and over again.
---
You wylin
---
That was sarcasm.
---
Dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed time and self care
---
thats not the point bro
---
im the killer main its just so much crutch perk that it needs rework
---
and anyway who has time to cleanse 5 totems that cleanse for 15 seconds and killer even might not have noed
---
Monto time
---
Is there a stereotype for all survivors? What are they? I know Dwight has an affinity for closets and I bet Jake just sabotages pointlessly.
---
I wouldn't say that, unless I've misunderstood. Someone that's really fucking good at pig isn't gonna 4k every match, while the best Nurses out there basically do just that and there's not really anything you can do but hope they choke.
---
I should have specified I was talking about window and pallet grabs

Moris, ultra rare add ons (prayer beads, tombstone, fragrant tuft, iridescent heads, pinkies finger, fathers glasses, iridescent seal, paint brush) and rare add ons, insta saw billy, leatherface in any way, nurse with more than 1 blink, spirit with add ons, 3 genning, camping a gen, "proxy hooking" (choosing hooks so you have an advantage when theyre unhooked, legion in any way, "slugging" (not hooking the person you downed straight away), anti gen builds, using the basement, body blocking as wraith, doctor in general, NOED, and not giving last survivor hatch. 
---
I think i got them all, its hard to remember.
---
Oh yeah juggling wasnt allowed before DS got balanced, now you aren't allowed to wait out DS. Theyve come to accept Ruin finally which is nice because its mandatory above rank 11. Please remind me if i missed one of the rules guys.
---
I think the popular opinion is Jane&gt;Kate&gt;Meg I believe
---
Itll be a good perk for like a week max then people will just cleanse it anyway. Randoms already clease everything they see weither or not its haunted or devour
---
Could have been an accident?
---
After reading other comments, maybe normal attacks through a window are ok. HOWEVER, I honestly think any ability based melee attack shouldn't attack through a window. Including Chainsaws, Nurse blink attacks, Phase Attacks, Feral Frenzy etc. I swear chainsaws are a get out of jail free card when it comes to looping around vault locations. It shouldn't be. "Don't let the killer get close" is all well and good, but his ass is faster than me, but if I make it to the other side of a window and get instadowned... It's such bullshitm . A perk like Lithe, Dance with me or Quick and Quiet should increase vault speed imo, something like this would help counter this crap.
---
Someone also said that all character hitboxes are the same, so Feng Min has the same sized hitbox as Jeff or David. I understand why all character have the same sized hitbox... But if anything the hitboxes should match middle sized characters like Jake or Dwight. It would be a nice medium. It wouldn't feel as super bullshit when you play smaller characters.
---
Ooooh. I get it now!
---
In case you were somehow still unaware you are also really good at being dumb. You should add that to your resume. With a little work it could have a nice home at the top of your skills.
---
Don't worry, they'll unhook you as soon as the killer doubles back to check on you.
---
but how is there a winner if survivors have to cooperate
---
i scraped the idea anyway so youre right
---
You are the first person to ever understand the reference.
---
Just be prepared to get hardly any points
---
Even so, there's no reason why survivors should depip because a killer disconnects.
---
Nice honor to have. It's one of my favorite episodes.
---
The smartest person knows not to show it...
---
I mean devour hardly even gets to used. Only time it doesnt is when its spirit cuz they think its haunted. Plus this would be a bit much if the totem did last to endgame and matched with blood warden
---
yea i aggree
---
you chnged my mind hex will lit after powered exit gates
---
Pig when she finds you: Stop! You violated the law! Pay the Entity a fine or be sacrificed!
---
You have to keep walking backwards until you‚Äôre around or at the edge of the sight blocker. Some survivors fall for this, others dont.
---
Wow 15 whopping seconds for barely hidden totems that spawn in obvious spots to completely nullify a perk before it even comes into play and that net you 600 BP each. What torture.

Yep i got a 4 man swf for the first time in ages last night, they all had names to make fun of new killers, i hadnt played killer a lot this season because of the queues and ive been enjoying survivor so i was rank 12 or 10 or some shit, i saw a medkit a torch and 2 toolboxes, i was feeling confident so i went plague and utterly shattered  them,  very satisfying to embarass them for a d rank killer like that, i even got a 4 man devour off.
---
Ok bud
---
A truly smart person wouldn't think they were the smartest person. They would be aware of all they don't know. The truly ignorant feel they are the smartest person. A stubbed toe has more smarts than you.
---
What lol
---
OOOH i see!! Thank you!
---
What do you play on? I believe there‚Äôs a looking for group subreddit , I‚Äôm not sure the name though. Maybe someone can link it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can find a post around here that gives you all of the stereotypes. I‚Äôve seen it myself.
---
I did. And out of the probably 100s that I faced, I can count on my hands the ones that were actually good. But that doesn't change the fact that those that were good, they were fully capable Nurses and didn't get ran around. I never denied that Nurses on console get fucked all the time, I denied that even the people who main Nurse and actually learn her can get bullied for 5 gens jus bc they play on console.
---
Like, I wouldn't be defending how capable Nurse can be on console if I didn't experience it myself, both as survivor and killer.
---
You expect me to just sit here on the toilet and let you say that
---
No it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs called taking the most efficient route to victory. I‚Äôm not letting an injured survivor leave and chase a full health one. Don‚Äôt care if there‚Äôs nothing you can do, that‚Äôs your problem not mine.
---
The DBD discord has a looking for group section for you to team up with SWF groups. Generally they're decent and I've found a couple of regular teams on there.
---
This would be broken. Rigged HORRIBLY against 2 survivors left. And rigged against one survivor left even more. Impossible to get out, on an end game timer, a killer looking for you, AND totems to break. Just a terrible rework idea. I don‚Äôt like noed much on either side, but this is too much.
---
Maybe to you, but other people are allowed to give out the hatch however they feel lmao
---
Its partly the killers fault, they know you got farmed and choose to fuck you over 2x.
---
Most games you can definitely afford to have one person waste two minutes cleansing totems, especially since you usually have to look for ruin anyways. And since it is, indeed, a crutch perk, the killers who use it tend to be on a lower skill level of playing, which makes it even more affordable time-wise. NOED exists to counter Adrenaline and Survivors who rushed gens without cleansing dull totems, and its fine as is as long as the current short gen times remain the same and Adrenaline goes without a similar rework.
---
There is currently no reason to nerf or rework a perk that can be easily and affordably countered before it ever comes into play, and which can still be destroyed and removed after it does, and which provides a viable counter to a similar crutch perk.
---
my point is its a shitty perk and it rewards being bad theres bad counterplay to it and propably gets cleansed after at least 1 teammate gets hooked because of it
---
this shit needs rework
---
and im talking from survivor perspective and killer perspective
---
Well... Aren't there perks that makes you have a favorite survivor to kill? I honestly didn't focused just on one but being logically there are perks that benefits you for tunneling
---
Okay. Fair enough.
---
You can continue to take that route but that route earns you significantly less points.
---
Noed can be useful. When you dont have a lot of perks as a newbie it's a good one for the slot. It's also good as a safety net when you're new. Anyone who is higher rank and still using it though needs to not be allowed.
---
I missread, my bad.
---
I‚Äôd rather kill a survivor than potentially allow one to escape, keep being salty :)
---
honestly like 33% of the perks could use buffs
---
Watch out for bt nd ds If you do that
---
Mash A
---
Bitch tf perks for then
---
I once got hooked and had a Claudette immediately unhook me right in front of the killer. The killer immediately downed me and hooked me again just for it to happen again. This happens one more time with the killer just trying to kill everybody around. I messaged the Claudette after the game asking why they did that to me just for them to message me saying that they have no team.
---
Sounds about the same.
---
I should've told ya to keep spectating. Talk about a missed opportunity.
---
I am sorry I upset ya. I don't set out to do those things. I'm an asshole as we've discovered. Thx for the abusement.
---
You know what? I‚Äôd do the same thing
---
Keep being salty? What..? If thats how you want to play thats fine by me but just know its not the most optimal way to play because you aren't doing the tasks your supposed to be doing as a killer.
---
Nat 20 on stealth.
---
You‚Äôre*
---
Agree with all but self care. You waste so much time with it
---
i aggree you can use it when you dont have good perks and before rank 15
---
but come on, there lots of better insta down perks that can rekt survivors easier like make your choice or devour hope
---
I know this might be a bit off track, but has anyone noticed that sometimes while playing killer, the game will just show four survivors d/c at the same time,  and it‚Äôll go to end game screen? I‚Äôve had survivors message me wondering why I would d/c and I have to explain that it showed the opposite for me, and is a weird bug.
---
Taking down the wounded person on their last hook is always the best move.
---
Exactly. There's a ton of them and people like you only use a couple at most.
---
Okay hun.
---
Hmmm, How about ‚ÄúWhile all generators are revealed, Reveal 1 Survivors aura for 1/2/3 Seconds every 10 second with a 15 second cool down. This effect cannot apply to the same survivor for more than two reveals.
---
Have you seen those dreads ? Hag ain't had a bath in a LONG time.
---
Disregard the comment at the top of the video
---
but seriously how many you had games when your teammates cleansed dull totems because killer MIGHT have noed
---
Only a killer main or someone who doesn't play survivor much would suggest garbage tier perks such as those. Not only are they awful and extremely situational but I bet you've never ran those perks yourself and they also still don't impact a game as much as NOED does no matter how many extra letters you add to words. Imagine thinking survivors are playing bad for completing their objective.
---

I finally got past rank 10 to land at rank 9 and have been so stoked about it! Achieving a rank goal is nothing to frown at!
---
Yeah its when you primarily go for one survivor, but I'm going to let you in a little secret...fuck the survivor rule book about killers and how not to play. They will complain about any and everything. Play the way you like and you will get better. 90% of them complaining is because they don't understand that you played the way you needed to in any given situation in order to win.
---
Classic trapper gameplay, the only killer whos power actively interferes with them amd the only power that can be sabotaged and ignlred completely.
---
I refuse to pay the fine! I'll pallet-loop my way through every guard in Whiterun if I have to!
---
Dunno about Spirit being that low.
---
I literally said anything is fair game. I dont complain about gen rushing at all, just pointing out the definition.
---
Then pay with your blood!

When your friend is choking on a tarnished coin and you're trying to help them get it out.
---
Ace, Keanu James, Jane, and Bill are spot on. Nice job mate
---
Are you sure you're spawning close to a killer? Some killers do very fast patrols of the gens. Just don't assume you're safe, even if you believe you are.
---
I'm new too, and I have died... A lot. But dying can be fun, too. Remember a survivor on a chase/getting carried/getting hooked still helps the team by taking up time. 
---
What I did when I was really new was set a simple goal for myself (escaping was a hope, not the main concern). So it was just "I'm going to do this gen and not get found".. so I'd be super cautious on one gen, taking forever. Once I got it, I'd go to the next.. then it went on to "I'm gonna get a loop on a killer", or "I'm gonna pallet stun".. etc
---
The fun is in the hunt/chase, not necessarily in escaping. At least it is for me.
---
A person of culture
---
I agree, itll probably change with dedicated servers
---
Imagine thinking d strike is still toxic and op
---
Yeah i watched some memes looking for the definition and yeah it describes very well what you say
---
EAT THE PORK, BITCH!
---
This for sure. It feels like shit when you miss out on that last kill because of the hatch but hey man that just means there will be a sequel.
---
More like 6000 bloodpoints
---
I mean its true, sometimes they can be completely off and still hit.
---
Adept Nurse was one of my final achievements.  
---
Hillbilly isn't that tough. Even if you use his chainsaw solely for map traversal, you'll have a good edge.
---
Grabs were removed because you can close the hatch, in order to remove hatch standoffs. Clearly, you still wanted to do them lol
---
Hatch grabs have been removed. You now have to close the Hatch.
---
I mean i got chat banned on xbox for calling jeff a fat cunt
---
damn it i forgot about the timer
---
ok new idea: turn it into token based not hex perk 
---
you get the token every time you hook someone
---
every time you get token your movement speed increases by 1%
---
when you have 6 tokens you THEN it activates rigged switch and it only blocks for 15 seconds
---
anyway you forgot that tiny little text that lets you see what switch is rigged
---
"sometimes infused switch will change colors slightly"
---
if you are focused on a color it is clearly visible that it changed color
---
At that moment I'd change my Steam name to "Gay and Proud".
---
It‚Äôs doing your job as killer
---
Welcome back from your hiatus
---
Nea helps her killer brethren
---
Playing bad for not completing a secondary objective such as totems, that's why it's a secondary objective. Don't complete it and you probably have to deal with NOED, whoops should've just spent the 80 seconds at most (since they probably ran ruin) to not deal with NOED. Interestingly enough I've never been able to play around adrenaline
---
Why? I don't even know what does words mean (i haven't played in a while) i stopped playing like 2 months after it went free on PS Plus and i lost my account so i decided to buy it now that it is on discount and there are a lot of stuff that is new to me
---
Why is it so bright
---
So a few months ago I convinced my best friend to try the game out. She liked it enough to convince her boyfriend to try it, who then convinced a few of his friends to play it, and now in our discord server there's a small 5-6 person group who are all playing DBD now.
---
And it's a really strange feeling to not only get other people into a game I'm into but also have them regularly on and asking if I can play with them. I think I like it, though. :)
---
Too dark in original screenshots
---
Rip
---
Ah man, I didn't know this either. I had me and a claud both waiting for a hatch to open as the last survivor was dead on the hook and I was surprised I didn't grab her. Also her jumping in seems to take priority over me being able to close It, or at least survivors can jump in quicker than a killer can close it assuming they are both ready as soon as it opens
---
It's only good on the Game. 
---
That map is small enough that you can use FF to find out which gen they're on, exit FF, and then head to the gen.
---
That said I still I question the thought processes both behind creating Fuming Mixtape and making it an Ultra-Rare.
---
No, there‚Äôs still a window of time where you can close it while they jump in. It‚Äôs still pretty killer sided.
---
/u/not_Queen_bhvr
---
Come to the killer side, alone you can rule the galax... game.
---
Whatever it takes
---
Oh sorry borrowed time (Bill's perk) which mean if the guy who unhooked the hooked person will have either 30 seconds or 60 seconds depending on what level it is of being able to take 1 hit while injured but also causing the player to bleed out if not mending decisive strike (laurie strode perk) is if you down a survivor with in a short amount of time then he or she will be able to break free from you leaving you stunned for a few seconds
---
Portuguese, or hung from trees.
---
Changing character won‚Äôt affect matchmaking, it mostly considers your rank, although matchmaking can be questionable at times. When you‚Äôre at the post-game lobby what ranks are the other players you‚Äôre matched with?
---
Does those perks activated everytime of have a cooldown?
---
Congrats, and yeah, you're right about that.  It's just so common to hear players ragging on the ranking system.  While yes it has flaws, it's still a ranking system.
---
I did try it playing it with a PS4 controller but it didn‚Äôt work I could move but I couldn‚Äôt look around and run so no not at the moment.
---
Alright, maybe bond instead. I know it sounds crazy but that perk can help so much
---
I only do it if their teammates either threw them under the bus or DCed, cause that‚Äôs just a FeelsBadMan for them.
---
This is the best picture explaining NOED!
---
W h a t
---
That's honestly a good question, last couple games I didn't shift through the end stuff to look really because I was so eager to jump into another game. I'll have to look! Thanks for the info on character switching though, that would've got me nowhere. I'll probably play a game or two here and take a look, and I can post an update!

OK total rework of the old suggestion please read it again!
---
Deceive strike doesn't but will always activate after someone is unhooked so if the person unhooked is acting cocky make sure when you hit them to wait atleast 60 seconds then it will run out and make the perk useless ( borrowed time) works only if  a rescuer unhooks Someone in your terror radius
---
Super killer sided.
---
The point is the irony of the post buddy
---
Your team doing gens, claudettes be taking screen shots :P i bet most of you still escaped with only 4 pallets and a tourist Claudette XD
---
Please tell me what you use for editing because I want to do something like that but with Legion instead
---
I‚Äôm not usually that guy, but *elude. And yeah, it can be pretty thrilling to narrowly avoid the killer, having them just barely miss seeing you.
---
But it only makes him take one more hit? Or is he immune for 60 sec? Also is there a way to know when someone has that perk on?
---
shes noming on the bacon
---
I wouldn‚Äôt really know because the killer usually doesn‚Äôt have NOED.
---
I actually didn't know nea was considered a toxic survivor. I'm tempted to switch to Jake now so I don't get grouped up with the toxic crowd QQ
---
Sounds like you need to buy Legion and actually see what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
People forget Lon Chaney's Wolfman, it's humanoid so it could work.
---
Platinum the game and you won't have to play it anymore.

Fair enough, wondered why I should never get those grabs.

Nice try buddy. Own him and have hi. P3d

That's what I was doing until killer queues got HECKED up
---
What's wrong with ruin
---
"What is this? Am I witnessing some kind of illusion?"
---
What helped me with Nurse was to slug. Such a time waster. I never slug, but I did it coincidentally in a game and noticed a pattern with their behaviors.
---
exactly my point noed isnt THAT common but not  enough rare that it isnt pain in the ass
---
Survivors are way more toxic than killers, you can't change my mind.
---
Why don't we all just universally agree that if the person on the hook is wiggling then that means that the killer is within view?
---
Adept Hillbilly took me forever to get too
---
if this was a repost I didn‚Äôt know lmao
---
Can we make illegitimate and unsupported reports bannable, Sony? Like, if someone states they reported me, can we counter report them for "Salt Reporting" me, and all I need is a screen cap of their claim to win since they probably have no evidence of whatever offense I didn't commit?

I have watched streamers a lot and recently started playing on xbox when it came to game pass. I can‚Äôt stand seeing people crouch slowly up to me and hide behind a rock until I hit second stage while watching the others get hit and downed on the hud. C‚Äômon people use the information your HUD gives you!
---
How is it somewhat toxic?
---
Because hes from Florida. Like me. We ALL like  hot pockets
---
Oh yeah I totally messed up that word and appreciate the correction lol.  Almost at level 40 with her and then  will probably level up other survivors or begin playing killer a lot more.
---
Welp thanks for the quick guide
---
Well tell your 'friend' that using you as a narrative if you dont support the content is just lazy. Doesnt cost much to make a reddit-account
---
So, it's mostly people in my range that I'm being matched with, so it isn't a problem with that. I didn't really thing it was, but I guess ya never know. Probably just people around my level (12) are learning quicker than me and I had some unlucky matches. Last couple went decent, actually got all four survivors out on one.
---
Big conclusion with little information. How bold.
---
No its actually really rare past green ranks. I hardly ever see it. Even if it is, its fairly obvious since most killers will do a build around it and won‚Äôt kick gens or have ruin. You notice the distinct lack of perks in play, or that they‚Äôre tunneling their obsession, some other details give it away at higher ranks. 
---
And y‚Äôknow, its still ridiculously easy to counter before it ever comes into play.
---
Its not that NOED rewards Killers for playing poorly. Its that NOED punishes survivors for ignoring the killers play style and the dull totems to rush gens.
---
No one‚Äôs joking about it . We‚Äôre serious , he‚Äôs just really hot .
---
I think everyone understands you, but throwing the whole match because they found the cheats before you did, *while you have plunderer‚Äôs I might add*, and wanted to check them for loot regardless, so you fuckin lose them the game, makes you a cunt.
---
You need to complete a certain amount of generators.
---
The amount you need to complete is the number of survivors alive +1.
---
That was hilarious, have you made more of these?
---
I got a SWF trying to pry on low rank killers today. I taught them a lesson by getting a 4K

do you want a link to the 2.0 version?
---
To each their own. But if I kill the last survivor by closing the hatch and get flamed "for not giving" the hatch, because  he "deserved" it by just being alive as the last guy. When no gens are done and his teammates were onehooked etc, I will try everything to find the hatch first and kill him.
---
Some survivor think, its an unspoken rule to give the last one the hatch no matter what.
---
Drop to the edge, it should respawn you into the game and this time exit normally.
---
You do need enough time to pull this off though.
---
I‚Äôve gotten to try some decent VR while visiting in laws.  It‚Äôs pretty cool, but the guy who owned it did say once the calibration was off between the headset and the computer and it made him puke.

Pretty fun stuff but definitely limited in the movement department. This was a few years ago so there is probably some newer stuff out now.
---
What are you gonna do? Teabag me?
---
I like Wake Up. It‚Äôs pretty niche but I‚Äôve has multiple games where I only escaped because I barely got the exit gate opened in time with Wake Up. The only buffs I‚Äôd like to see for it is have it permanently reveal the gate switch aura for your team whenever you open a gate, and also give it a bloodwarden effect where your team can see your aura when standing inside the gates.

You can't please everybody.

---
No. NOED doesn‚Äôt need a rework just because bad survivors can‚Äôt counterplay.
---
Only exhaustion perk that will activate while your exhausted is Adrenaline. 
---
That being said, balanced landing still half works the other way.  If you used your dead hard, you would lose the speed boost of BL, but you get to use the fall stun Resist still.  So not totally useless.
---
Cool colors in this!
---
Lose your faith in survivors again...bro I play so much killer and that formed my opinion on the perk.  It feels skilless and cheap using it.  I took it off all my killers ages ago from the pallet removal update on since that's when devs finally started showing killers that they give a shit and was the start of them balancing all the broken shit survivors had.  It is incredibly bad design man and teaches killers the very worst habits like overcommiting to chases, not pressuring gens, and just making poor decisions midchase in general.  
---
And how in the world are you still complaining about post rework decisive?  I don't even get d striked anymore it's like playing 3 perk survivors.  Simply don't tunnel and you don't get hit with it.  I make a point to switch targets.  Games are more fun, better pips, more bp's etc...if you still eat decisive regularly post rework that is a personal problem with your specific killer play.

I‚Äôm usually a killer but my friends convinced me to play survivor. My steam name is COFFEE. I can do discord or radio silent, both is cool with me. I‚Äôm rank 7 but I‚Äôm not looking for ranks.
---
I've actually spent the last week running Small Game and clearing totems. You will not clear every totem in 80 seconds and you score a substantially smaller amount of bp and can even depip after clearing every single totem yourself so in a way you "play bad" either way. I fail to see how you can try to justify someone having to sack themselves every game in case of a potential NOED vs the much needed and long overdue nerf/rework of NOED.
---
*Great is the weapon that cuts on it's own*
---
I always run Kindred when solo queueing to fight this
---
I just did the exact same thing as Freddy, but I think he really screws with worse players a lot better than some of the other killers. Even without perks.

Summary:
---
NOED doesn‚Äôt need a rework for bad survivors that want to ignore counterplay.
---
Just cleanse dull totems.
---
It's still bullshit when you score and interrupt but the gen finishes before you touch them and they can just run away
---
Yup
---
Claudette: hiding in grass not doing shit
---
Dwight: polishing hatchets for huntress
---
Jake: sabotaging hooks
---
Meg: comes to your gen, fails skill check, spring bursts away
---
Quentin: both people who main Quentin are super nice
---
Jane: appreciate her personality (also recognize that head on is literally the best thing ever)
---
Bill: don‚Äôt mind me I‚Äôm a console player, the bill meta has yet to develop
---
Laurie: reminiscing about D-strike
---
David: Running straight to the hook for his WGLF stack
---
Adam: racing David to the hook for his deliverance 
---
Nea: urban evasion + sprint burst + huge brain
---
Feng: this one is personal, because I main feng. I don‚Äôt know the stereotype but I‚Äôm hot steamy garbage at survivor so there you go
---
Jeff: Being loud as fuck
---
Ash: groovy
---
There‚Äôs Ace and Tapp but I honestly don‚Äôt know what to say about them
---
Tbh, if you find youself forced to camp the last survivor a lot of the time you probably could do with a bit of 'getting gud'. You definitely lack pressure early game and NOED will not make up for that (many survivors just leave when they see NOED is active anyways). You're not going to learn how to apply pressure by camping either so...that's that. 
---
There really is no way to stop the salt if you camp.  Period. Imagine absolutely wrecking a killer only to get cheesed on/miss that escape because of dumb luck. I completely understand how fruatrating that would be 
---
At the same time, I don't blame you for camping. If I had a really rough game as killer, and that is the only way
---
I had no idea this was a thing until I read your comment. Too bad there‚Äôs no voice chat in game to indicate this or anything else in a team game... although I guess voice chat would defeat the purpose of the wiggling anyway lol
---
The one thing I hate about this game is how much RNG totems add to the game, much more so than what‚Äôs already in it. You could have a totem last 1 minute or last 10 minutes simply from where it spawns.
---

u all say he's toxic etc etc, but its really fucking tilting that you can get sandbagged literally 10games in a row, and then you exit the game, launch it a few hours/days later thinking it would be fun, and you get sandbaged once more and the killer lets the sandbagger run away, this game is garbage toxic and not fun right now. wow im even getting reported because i have legacy 3 claudette with only 690hours in the game, the fact that i had an almost 2year long break doesn't matter, im a cheater :DD

---
Do you think I care that clauds are seen as toxic? let your actions speak louder than their ignorance, we will end this pregidous together, comrade
---
I'm gonna disregard the moon mechanic as a power out of your control isn't fun, and I'll disregard the rage mechanic  as it's not too well defined and it seems to be more passive like the moon idea so I'll focus on the leap part. This is your best bet as you could start with 2 leaps like Nurse but any swing should then trigger exhaustion otherwise we get a similiar pre-rework Legion issue with spamming attacks. He could also be given a crouch mechanic that reduces but doesn't remove terror radius so you can switch from 4 legged to bipedal. You could do addons that reduce leap fatigue, extend leap distance, add leaps, and add ons that augment the crouch like more discernible blood trails, closer scratch marks, louder sounds which brings more attention to the animal aspects.
---
PS, I already responded earlier on a different comment how you can use a Lon Chaney style werewolf so as to keep the humanoid requirement.
---
This just seems really needlessly convoluted.
---
"Got you nose"
---
Is this a 2018 meme or what
---
The killer already takes point penalties for staying within a proximity of hooked survivors when there are no unhooked survivors around. I realize that it probably sucks for the survivor who gets camped, but a hooked survivor shouldn't get bonus points for getting hooked and having a bad killer.
---
I struggled through understanding your broken english, but it's ok I actually don't care anymore and definitely don't care enough to look at whatever fuckin guide you're on about. I watched a flashlight video posted a few months ago where they timed the blinds in a frame-check and the one was 1.030 and other was 1.090 but sure bud
---
That sounds lame and impossible for all killers but nurse and spirit (and billy).
---
Again, I feel like you're missing out on the "on purpose" part they didn't "find" the chests before me, they knew the location of the chest. I also exaggerated in my comment. I made it sound like I do it deliberately, but in reality I only have 1 game on record where I actually did what I said I did.
---
 I joined a game where there were 3 claudettes. I asked in pre-game chat to leave the chests to me since I had plunderer's and ace in the hole. One of them said that they would deny me all chests. They burned a shroud that made us all spawn together and we happened to spawn inside shack right next to the basement. One of the claudettes was closer to the stairs than I was and even though I imidiately made my way downstairs, she made it to the chest before I did. I decided to wait there untill she opened the chest, maybe she wasn't being that big of a cunt and had a looter build herself is what I tought.
---
That tought dissapeared when I saw a brown toolbox appear. I ran back upstairs and went to look for the other chests. The next chest I found was being opened by another claudette, she just finished as I rounded the corner and started T-bagging me. Thats the moment that I snapped, didn't bother looking for the last chest. I just went around and threw eveey pallet I could find down, later I saw that the last chest was indeed also opened.
---
There, now you can judge me for the full story, but don't you dare say that they just "found the chests"
---
Altogether, enduring is now 150ms slower than it use to be, or 15% of a second slower.
---
It is 1/3 of a second slower than it should be right now.
---
Is this a 2017 meme or what
---
If you think about it really hard, like Stephen Hawking levels of intelligence, people will usually give up once they see they‚Äôre hit with a chainsaw, so you could get an easy second hit in theory-but it‚Äôs much easier to just instadown them since 50% bp isn‚Äôt that worth it.
---
In the description for his power.
---
but seriously who cleanses dull totems these days because killer might have noed
---
thats just waste of time
---
It‚Äôs the ego man even a old survivor main like me is disappointed in that survivor, the game is about fun not making fun of people because you won
---
If you think its ok to have internet that is so bad I have 500 ping, then your the one who should dc.
---
Someone feel a draft?
---
Love the way you drew Amanda! Really cute art!
---
OH SHIT YOU'RE RIGHT! It takes 1.05 seconds to blind someone with a flashlight! Thank you! I need to correct some comments lol. Sorry, simple mistake.
---
This is a really thought out concept. Similar to ones I‚Äôve shared with friends and unlike some illogical ideas. I‚Äôm thinking of the fun that could be had activating the power when you see two survivors healing with nurses calling and they just injure each other further lol.
---
Thanks. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me me why it would be that lol but I guess I'll be a little more patient next time
---
I mean, I think Ace is the one who brings up a reasonable point
---
you know what true would say 
---
"Dead ard is an op perk that gives survivers an unearnd second chance"
---
Also yeah what the fuck was up with that english I think i had a stroke holy shit
---
YES YES AND YES, I love this idea!
---
60 seconds is not remotely a little window
---
His perks are pretty trash, but if you don‚Äôt care about that and just wanna play as Ash then it‚Äôs fine. MoM got nerfed hard and is not worth running now. His other two perks are far too dependent on the killer slugging (which rarely happens) that they‚Äôre not worth running if you‚Äôre trying to run a serious perk build.
---
I heard he‚Äôs really loud. Ha it will be fun
---
It's even worse considering the queue times for killers right now. A whole swf could dc and still get back into the game faster than the killer they bailed on. Even with the husks the killer would probably depip too, for insult to injury.
---
I bought her and been having a blast üòÅ
---
If you cleanse you instantly die.
---
" said killer main that uses noed to keep him away from rank 20 "
---
this is why we have a toxic community. Assuming ANYTHING without knowing someone.  Are you enlighted or something, why do you think you are entitled to speak about others or why your opinion is more important?
---
As a survivor, i'm cleansing dull totems because i am scared of noed.
---
As a killer, i'm rarely using noed.
---
Thank you
---
I agree, it's more of a beginner perk. Once you get better at tracking and intuiting survivor movement, there are far better perks to take.
---
No U the killer: You activated my trap card.
---
I did this too today. Never tried the perk before. In the past haddonfield was kind of a "meh" map for me but with balanced landing I love upstairs gens with one point of entry (staircase) and a couple vaults nearby. 
---
Tons of fun to give the killer the slip on a high vault.
---
What if you only hook them once each then mori their asses?
---
I sympathize with the fact that it isn't fun to get facecamped, absolutely. The thing is you're conflating fun and point gain here-- adding points to compensate getting facecamped doesn't do anything to make the game "more fun" so much as it takes the sting out of it a little bit. As someone who is also a new player but only plays killer, facecamping is objectively bad. Once survivors see a killer is facecamping, they just do gens uncontested. 
---
The experience sucks for the player getting camped, so more should probably be done to reduce the behavior or environments that promote facecamping rather than reward the victims of the behavior. Adding or removing points to either side doesn't address the issue. It's a bandaid fix, and not even a good one. As much as it sucks, it's best not to stress it and to move onto the next round. As your rank increases, you'll probably see it a lot less often.
---
i love how you just nope the fuck outta there
---
np, sry. have a good night.
---
Just sent you a request.
---
ok sorry for that
---
please lay your arguments why noed dosent need change and i will lay mine
---
Adrenaline, an exhaustion perk, and then two of your choice. Popular fill-ins include DS, BT, Iron Will, Deliverance, Prove Thyself, Bond, Sel Care, QnQ, etc.
---
If I‚Äôm trying to win, I‚Äôll personally use Adreny, Dead Hard, Iron Will, and DS (if solo queue) or BT (if swf).

But usually I just solo queue and want to farm so I use Plunderers, Ace in the hole, WGLF, and BT.
---
*No Homo has entered the chat*
---
I haven‚Äôt really played him as survivor but when I hook him as killer he‚Äôll scream for 10 seconds lol it‚Äôs funny as hell
---
Owwww
---
this is 5th of all time so i believe this is a winner
---
Noob Question, whats BnP?
---
And here I am telling my killers they‚Äôre gods if I barely escape.
---
(new to the game) was bouncing between rank 16-15 and thought I'd never get past it, then got to 14.. then rank 13 matchmaking seemed like impossible matches for me...
---
Now rank 12. :)
---
Brand new part. It's an ultra rare survivor add on to the toolbox.  It used to be able to be used for an entire generator. If I remember now it only works till like 25% of a generator or something. Check some old videos of it.  It was nasty.
---
Cool
---
That‚Äôs how I see it. I just do totems if i suspect they have them
---
I updated the bottom of the post with my perks, but forgot the levels. But I started off playing Meg and was decent with her, but I bought a couple of the on sale DLCs and honestly felt like I was having better luck as Kate.
---
I may try going back to Meg and maybe give Claudette a try. I tried Nea and wasn't too good at playing her but that was when I first started so who knows maybe I can man her a little better now?
---
But I haven't done a whole bunch of perks research, which I supposed would be a pretty good investment of my time if I'm hoping to get better.
---
All they'd have to do is actually allow the two standard emotes "come here" and "over there" while hooked.
---
This is part of why I sometimes use Kindred. Not knowing where the killer is is a huge part of the game. With Kindred at least the other survivors can see this is happening, and if they're smart (granted they're not always smart) they'll be doing gens. I've never played killer but when 2-3 gens pop I'm sure it's kind of an "oh crap" moment.
---
Was gunna sneak back in for the survivor.... but big nope to that!
---
?
---
I do gens lmao
---
I'm not going to lie to you and say I haven't had games where I've felt I've deserve the hatch(especially games where someone d/cs on their first down and we get a few gens done)

I know we're probably talking about Ace mains, which generally seem to be the cooler ones.
---
But if we're going by him as a character, isn't he suppose to be a sleazy conman who talks his way out of everything and avoids problems out of pure luck?
---
r/deadbydaylightLFG
---
Exactly why I don‚Äôt run that perk. Call it selfish but when I do they all try to pass the burden off each other, I‚Äôd rather have two people trying to get me without knowing that none at all
---
By chance was this on ps4?
---
You recognise when they can do it and just dont chase them.
---
refer to the old STBFL + Unrelenting combo for how BS that would feel for survivors, not just in that situation but in loads of situations.
---
If you‚Äôre a survivor run Spine Chill, it counters like 90% of the killers with stealth advantage. Self-heal is a must as well, an exhaustion perk is also very much in meta, I personally run dead hard it prolongs chases more consistently than lithe or sprint burst‚Äîbalanced landing is also good but I majorly prefer dead hard because it causes the killer to waste more time. You can choose to put your own thing in there, some people run DS or adrenaline‚Äîbut adrenaline requires having a team that finishes all the generators so..Take that as you will. 
---
For killer always run hex ruin, I usually run Pop The Weasel as a backup in case that gets taken out, which it does very often. I don‚Äôt recommend running survivor tracking perks because a lot of that technique just comes with experience. What perks to run on killers is SUPER variable depending on which killer it is, usually two gen slowing perks are integral and the test is up to your choosing. 
---
I‚Äôll extrapolate my point above: some killers have really good map pressure (The Hillbilly) and some don‚Äôt (Hag or Clown) so for these killers it‚Äôs wise to run two gen impairing perks, Hillbilly you can get away with having one, but two might also be smart. Killers that are really strong in chases like Clown and Trapper can benefit from Nurses Calling or Clourophobia so that you can slow the game down as much as possible. Generally if you don‚Äôt know what to run Enduring or Iron grasp are really good perks on any killer for this nice recovery times and easy basement hooks. 
---
Hope this advice helps! Feel free to ask any more questions!
---
If i had a dollar for every message i got after this exact thing happened. Legit had a guy die and tell me what trash i was cuz i lost him on a chase a few times. I play nurse main so its hard to track sometimes while im staring at the fucking ground. But i ended up killing 3 out of 4. And it was just all trash talk. And the guy talking the shit was the one who got killed lol.
---
You should read Ace's backstory :D. When he was still on earth, he had a gambling problem and debts kept piling up, he got taken by the entity when they were about to collect his debt. In the realm of the entity is where his luck turned. Thats why Ace always smiles, being taken by the entity was a blessing to him.

Here comes the weekend to teabag in your face and then fuck off.
---
It merely doesn't always work, better survivors will take note of the time it takes you to round a corner and know you're mind gaming. Others will take it a step further and leave the loop if they think they're going to try and double mind game. Sometimes mind games simply don't work against some survivors, you gotta keep track of that as killer.

---
What about a flip phone
---
It doesn't work because he doesn't go after just anyone lore wise .
---
It talks about him gambling and scamming people and if he got in trouble he talked his way out of it. I'm sure his perks reflect that despite getting in the problems he always came out on top due to luck  and keeping that positive attitude.
---
sounds like the typical smooth talker who always got into trouble thanks to his bad deeds. While he may not be perceived as a mean person, he does seem to lean towards  the "bad guy" side of the survivor spectrum.
---
That was filthy. I love it.
---
The saw would've taken too long to charge, plus it was a split second decision. I'm guessing you're a tbagging survivor too, and you're a pretty easy example that most people in this game are more toxic than 12 year old cod players.
---
TYPING LIKE THIS DOES NOT MAKE YOUR POINTS VALID
---
Hell no. I can loop killers quite decently there.... Unless they are Trapper.
---
Gideon is worse.
---
You defiantly could‚Äôve gotten the saw off before they got out had you started with that.
---
*bill intensifies*
---
lol, I still think he's cool. And that's just the character himself, like I mentioned most Ace mains tend to be cool and from I notice are mostly always solid teammates. Not to mention he is also audibly the quietest survivor in the game so he's got that going for him.
---
Yep. I told my friend who was complaining it was a nerf. He uses it a lot I personally dont but i know how it is. So then I tried it and he was right that it is slower. So it's either a bug or they straight lied so killers wouldnt be annoyed. Figures they nerf down mettle of man and they give a nice fat nerf to the enduring spirit fury combo.
---

Im not actually. I dont like T-baggers in any shape or form. You posted something stupid that everyone experiences to try and get sympathy which you wont get. You could have chain sawed and got her btw.

---
People DC if they dont like the map. Or the killer has a secret offering. Or they don't like the killer. Or if a friend dies early. Or if they get downed first. Or if they don't get kills before last gen is popped. 
---
Too many reasons to list, point is if you don't like the game uninstall it. Don't leave as killer to screw the survivors game. Don't leave as survivor and sandbag your teammates. Just leave.
---
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS YET, BUT WHEN YOUR TUNNELED, YOUR LITERALLY DEAD ALREADY ANYWAYS. LOL. SO YOU'RE NOT FUCKING ANYONE OVER. THANKS.

How, there's no way to tell until you hit them and you can tell their name.

Potato? The only reason I didn't get the 4k was because the game bs'd me out of the grabbing animation, despite me being in the middle of it. You're clearly another example of this game's toxic community. If you don't like what you see then oh well, move on.
---
Yea when I know they are at the gates I just go make myself a sandwich until EGC runs out, surprisingly survivors are still there by the time I get back.
---
dude I literally just justified leaving my team mates behind. Fuck I bet you'd get pissy even if I left as I am being moriiied too. IF IM DED, I MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE.

If it's trash, why complain?
---
Noed takes up a perk slot that does nothing until the gates are powered. Its also a perk that punishes players for ignoring the secondary objective of doing totems. If anything we could buff Noed and make cleansing totems increase gen repair speeds for all survovors to make the secondary objective less optional. The problem isn't noed, its that cleansing blank totems is basically ignored.
---
That's why you go with Bond
---
The Candyman kills to stay relevant, as a spirit forgotten is lost forever.
---
Oh god i remember that episode
---
I mean I guess but look at this way if you are being tunneled and have DS and you're decent at running the killer around then at least you help your team do some gens and you get some blood points out of it I know its annoying but this is still a team based game you should always try to help your team even if it results in your own death
---
If the Killer is camping just do generators. A camping killer against good survivors only gets one kill. Or 99% the last generator and have someone pop it with adrenaline as you go down. There are plenty of ways to counter camping. People just don't have brains.
---
Killers lose points for proximity to hook as well so unfortunately for you I don't think anything will stop camping besides those Killers ranking up and realizing it's useless
---
Just make it old Freddy
---
Then yes as you said, they should actually implement that belief into the game and not leave out dated info on it. Because the vast majority of people wont see it see or remember that over what they‚Äôve put into the game.
---
Alrighty Eeyore...
---
Was having a pretty frustrating evening playing this game - experiencing random glitches and definitely being a little more toxic than usual because of it. Saw OP's post and it kinda talked some sense into me. Sure, OP's post isn't gonna change the whole community, but who knows? Maybe our community will have one or two less whiny assholes because of it. 
---
So thanks OP. Gonna try to be more positive until I undoubtedly forget about this post in the next couple hours.
---
Oh no, he's *gasp* playing the competitive video game!
---
While do what megs do , she  began to wonder what that glowing white thing that appeared is.
---
Yeah. On easy.
---
Adrenaline, DS, and Dead Hard. All with InstaHeals or Purple flashlights.
---
The community of this game is a shit show.
---
RUN WHAT YOU WANT
---
PLAY WHAT YOU WANT
---
DONT BE A TOXIC SHITBAG
---
I'm yet to get a message from a fellow survivor lmao. I guess I have that to look forward to
---
he‚Äôs coming to console and was present on the leaked mobile version, right?
---
Do you own stock in capital letters or something?
---
DUDE, I mean I am actually decent at survivor lol. I've been to red ranks.. and I'd be there still if I didn't DC so much.... I can run the killer quite well. But just like every other good runner, I fuck up. Sometimes they tell me they had to camp me because they knew I was the best one.... I was like... then allow me to be the one that has a shot at escaping then?? like why does the best one need to fucken die right away?? Thats not fun.
---
You got way more wound up about the post than I did about the tbagging. And it wasn't even the tbagging part that was annoying, it was the fact that the game bs'd me out of the grab and that's what allowed the survivor to escape. If this post is really causing you psychological problems than I suggest you move on.
---
This should be a copypasta
---
that also annoys me to hell ngl

---
This is what i consider tunneling, just odd behavior lol.
---
But the issue is that some, maybe most Killers literally cannot kill fast enough to have a chance against a decent SWF group. Adding some depth to how generators work would separate these players more and give solo players more ways to help, but just extending the time would only really add a few seconds with SWF groups, support campers, and make the game much harder for solo queues.
---
I'm not saying scavenging for parts is the best solution, I just think it's better than a flat timer increase or the situation we have now.
---
Sorry then. I got my angst up just at the thought of the majority of team mates I've had who used no mither.
---
Keep in mind the Legion Exploit was a large issue with the code, and to fix it they‚Äôd need to redesign the code for both add ons
---
How do u find the discord
---
Had a game before where some guy died on hook straight away at the start of the game, then me and my friend both got hooked across the map from each other. We were both wondering why the fuck the third guy wasn‚Äôt getting either of us. Then when we died we got to see the guy was sat in a cupboard with crows sat on top and making loads of noise, then ghostface finds him. Then we see he was rank 20 with no perks equipped
---
Must have been one of his first games
---
Yeah, I got two of these in a row and am seriously considering uninstalling if that's what my future looks like.
---
Fun fact: This type of person doesn't spawn before Rank 16.
---
You can't say that here. Regardless of accuracy. Like you can literally play however the fuck you want but like, can't say that. You've gotta be the killer that lets the last one go or only kills the dumb players on the surv team.
---
Just Look At That Grin. You Are Clearly Wrong.
---
Yeah but that's not what happened here.
---
Replace DS with Adrenaline and you've got a good meme
---
Well, yeah, you're not wrong.
---
How the hell is plague a D tank killer
---
You could‚Äôve faked it or took a hit
---
If you mean the game itself hardly any. The people that may message you is a different story.
---
Understandable the vast majority of users I see using them are Davids which shouldn't be too much of a shocker but they're the ones that go down instantly and DC.
---
One time somebody quit in my lobby, I though ‚Äúyay gotta go find another lobby‚Äù but I was honestly great full for it. We would have gone against a leatherface with iron grasp, agitation, and fucking insidious. I‚Äôm so glad that somebody left that game before it started
---
She tried, okay?
---
I'll face camp survivors if they're dumping on me in a chase and then tea bag mid chase(especially if it's like the first chase of the game)
---
I said the same thing. Till I never ever chance it anymore and cleanse all totems. Look at it as totems is part of the game. Do all gens and all 5 totems. The best feeling is when they have no ed and look stupid at the end.
---
Lmao funny how I ran into this.
---
It boggles my mind to see any killer complain about the new EGC Hatch.  It is ridiculously killer sided man.  Find it close it, collect your 4K.  I close it in like 4/5 of my killer games on average.
---
I tried but he chased me for a split second and immediately went back
---
Yep. On PC I only play nurse with controller. Otherwise it is more of a whack-a-mole game since there is no counter play against her when she can make pinpoint turns and adjustments. 
---
With a controller, you can‚Äôt make a quick 360 after a blink or very precisely point towards a person.
---
I don't mind borrowed time. If they're stupid enough to make that save right in front of me, I'm hitting the unhooked one and leaving them. It just takes more time for them to heal themselves. Gotta mend 1st, more time they spend away from gens, better for me.
---
It's awful.
---
I thought Dwight was always in a closet, though. Look, I'll be honest; I haven't been keeping up with the DbD anime over here, but I always see Claudettes playing altruism. 90% chance it'll be her to unhook and her to try to distract.
---
You are a sad, strange, little man. You have my pity. Farewell.
---
He messed up the vault but I dont know why he left considering how the killer that handled that L wall T wall. It‚Äôd be an easy escape regardless.
---
No, fuck you for being so good that my heart almost explodes lmao jk jk.
---
"suspect"
---
and it turns out you lost 5 mins of generator progress because your prediction was wrong
---
My buff for him would be giving his last downswipe motion a hit box. So many times I would‚Äôve hit someone if that was t just a visual effect.
---
The problem is he/she is not wrong. Don‚Äôt like the DC part, but there is a fundamental problem with the nurse.
---
Okay well that's going straight out the window in this game what's your second pick?
---
Lungs are vital for hamon users
---
we need the high ghostface mask....WAZZZZAAAUPPP
---
tbh, they are kinda fucked rn, with the freddy there are gonna be SO MANY GLITCHES no doubt, also the exits not working, this, and the ptb coming up
---
So this is how they made ghostface
---
So what should hatch condition be? Highest BP Survivor only after 1-2 sacrifices/DCs?
---
Actually, it could be fun if one person gets to take it early. Watch them instantly betray their team.
---
Or weep because you were on that team thanks guy.
---
If it is SWF, they will either all DC or none will.
---
That‚Äôd ruin the fun
---
I wish there were a BP bonus for lore-setting situations. Encouragement to roleplay could probably chill people out a lot.
---
Collision trap Hag is pretty fun since her traps have collision before they're activated and you can block off an area
---
But what if they want the points?
---
Is that a Darkest Dungeon reference!?
---
Since one is double gay it canceled itself out, so you still omega gay.
---
Thank you &lt;3.  My delicate heart can't handle the support I got haha, I really appreciate it
---
The weird part is seeing a specific Killer. Like that's not just SWF.
---
Good to  know
---
You'll realize in this reddit that it's full of killer mains. Theyll trash talk you anytime you say something like that. They find you running adrenaline equal to no edm look, as a survivor and a killer. Cleanse all the totems. Dont worry about it being a quick match. Take your time and cleanse totems. So then, if it is a trash killer you'll smack them.
---
Imagine actually being a baby killer, successfully getting a win on a first time map, and then being accused of camping and getting hit with so many insults it legit almost makes you not want to play the game anymore. That was me today! Survivors are gr8
---
That's the scary part. I main Killer, and I get that that makes me some avatar of whatever adolescent angst toxic SWF groups dwell in, so they want to hurt me, personally, with every fibre of their being.
---
But then they ALSO want to hurt the people on their team who aren't explicitly their friends, so what's up with that?
---
I like how powering the generators makes the killer bad lol. Gates powered does not = Game over.
---
I think the convention is to not look until there are a certain number for one person.
---
Or a certain number FROM one person to see if that person's a liability.
---
I've honestly experienced more killers (and even some salty teammates) bitch about the last survivor getting the hatch than survivors bitching about not getting it from the killer.
---
Like, I don't know who people are playing with as I can only speak to my own experiences. But I don't think I've ever heard a survivor complain that a killer didn't outright give them hatch.
---
For Survivor:
---
Lots of different perk builds are extremely viable but I‚Äôll just list off a few of the most powerful perks.
---
Exhaustion perks are pretty important because they affect the amount of time you can waste during the chase. Generally Dead Hard and balanced landing are considered the best while Sprint Burst is the easiest to use. Lithe can be good but it can also be wasted if you have a window you want to loop at the start of your chase. Head on is pretty awful and a meme perk. Adrenaline is technically an exhaustion perk but serves a completely different purpose because it is an endgame perk. Essentially it is really useful for any game where you can actually make it to the last gen being powered. Finally we come to vigil. In theory it‚Äôs a good perk but in practice it will never be useful sadly. As for picking between dead hard and balanced landing, I personally prefer balanced landing because its passive affect is really useful and dead hard doesn‚Äôt work against instadown killers.
---
wow that was a long but important section.
---
Healing perks are also pretty useful because they can drastically change the game. Self care is the most meta of these but due to recent nerfs I personally find that getting someone else to heal me is better but as a solo player it‚Äôs pretty essential. Botany knowledge is a nice helpful passive but not many use it due to other powerful perks. Autodidact is another great in theory poor in application perk. I just find it takes too much extremely important time to get past the debuff. Solidarity is ok but not particularly useful. My personal favorite is We‚Äôll make it because the increased healing speed is just absolutely INCREDIBLE. most killers don‚Äôt have the map pressure to make it back to you by the time that 3 seconds go by. I feel I should also mention Pharmacy as it‚Äôs a pretty underrated perk. It essentially leads to a faster and better self care but finding a chest can be tedious, especially in solo survivor.
---
Kinda leading off that are hook saves perks. Borrowed time is the ultimate counter to face campers but it‚Äôs easy for your teammates to waste it especially solo survivor. I already mentioned We‚Äôll make it and how much I love it.  We‚Äôre gonna Live forever is the only survivor perk to apply postgame bloodpoint rewards so despite it not having any other purpose I run it on almost every one of my survivors. Decisive Strike is a good anti tunneling perk but some killers will tunnel you if you use it so be careful.
---
Other than those major categories some really powerful perks include:
---
Iron will which is easily top 5 perks in the game because it counters spirit and a little bit of nurse, the two best killers in the game
---
Kindred is almost a MUST HAVE if you are solo survivor but is essentially useless in a swf group.
---
Spine Chill is really good against sneaky killers like ghost-face, Pig, Myers. Wraith, and spirit and can be useful in a lot of situations.
---
Urban evasion is 1 part meme 1 part actually really good stealth perk. You kinda just need to experience it yourself.
---
Resilience is just good. It‚Äôs not Great. Just a solid perk.
---
Quick n Quiet can really mess with some killers minds. I actually really like it.
---
Unbreakable rarely works but when it does it‚Äôs youtube montage time. Basically if you just plan on not getting a use out of it you won‚Äôt be disappointed but if you do pull it off it is fun asf.
---
Object of Obsession will make a killer hate you.
---
Calm spirit underrated and on top of its main purpose it also counters clown and doctor.
---
Leader and Prove Thyself are gen rush basics.
---
Empathy is sometimes useful.
---
TLDR
---
Use either Dead Hard or Balanced Landing.
---
Use Either Borrowed Time or We‚Äôll Make it.
---
If you want blood-points use We‚Äôre gonna live forever
---
If solo survivor use Kindred
---
Self care is good
---
Iron Will counters the best killers in the game
---
find some perks you like and just play them.
---
That was really long and I put way more effort into it than I was expecting so please don‚Äôt hate on me too much.
---
deep wounds timer doesnt go down unless out of the killers terror radius, the killer also can no longer see how much time you have left on it
---
and the sanity of trying to talk with 90% of the people on this sub.

mmm dat peppersteak

If the background is light, you should use a dark outline and vice versa. The one on the right looks better.
---
Well, I like memes, but I've yet to see a fun bug. Today I got Za Warudo-ed trying to pick up someone disconnecting. Interesting, but not fun.
---
Just your friendly Xbox gamers, reminding you about trash day.
---
Who wouldn't
---
Basically
---
Oh hey! Me, too.
---
Because his point is just.
---
After playing like 3 games with him and literally double pipping every single one because survivors couldn‚Äôt find ruin. Still gotta try bubba and trapper once I get ruin on them but he is still dependent on survivor mistakes.
---
Go ahead, dc. Id rather you be gone than risk ds.
---
Just uninstall.
---
Better to give the slot to someone else than be a toxic douche about it.
---
The game obviously isn't bringing you any enjoyment with that attitude,and you are actively harming the enjoyment of others with your actions.
---
Either uninstall,or adjust your attitude.
---
The world will not adjust to suit your feelings.best to go ahead and swallow that pill now.
---
Survivor is easy anyway, I don‚Äôt mind doing them just to do them lol
---
I honestly don't get why people have such a hard time remembering this one.
---
It's like either side would rather make a convoluted argument about how tbagging/clicking/camping/tunneling is ACKSHULLY OK instead of just admitting that you're just kind of being a dick.
---
First encounter with it today on PC. Thought it was tied to the player D/Cing.
---
....why didn't you use the chainsaw?
---
It's almost needed to pip with LF past green ranks
---
Old Freddy, but with a twist

Only reason I run Kindred religiously. So they can also watch each other crouch nearby and do nothing.. good times

One of these guys makes explosives in his basement. Can you guess which one?

Looking for more people to play SWF/KYF. I got 2-3 I play with but they‚Äôre never on at the same time
---
Seems the best way to enjoy "Competitive" games is to leave long enough for your rank to drop, find some jerks, and curbstomp them.
---
The problem being that once you reach your proper rank, it's back to the toxic cesspool.

But adrenaline doesn't reward you for being bad, it rewards you for completing the objective of finishing all 5 generators. 
---
NOED is the complete opposite of that.
---
Yeah, but they flash you when you're breaking pallets. Which doesn't make sense, but I guess Killers don't have eyelids.
---
That's the really annoying one.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be a flashlight clicking t-bagging fuck. But I imagine you‚Äôll enjoy playing me mostly because I fucking suck lmao. But I have been picking up tips. But a good half of my messages lately have been just gg from killers and me calling them gods. And promising dick sucking when a killer lets me escape in exchange for dropping boards on them.
---
Ironic how survivors don't do a gen and get rewarded, nobody bats an eye. The second they are hit with noed, they lose their shit and complain about "rewarded for doing bad".
---
&gt;MORE CUNTS WASTING THEIR TIME LOL.
---
But hypocritical coming from youüòÇ
---
Wtf do i look like chasing your healthy teammate when they unhook you. I would be a fool to let you run off and heal so stop complaining
---
*you're
---
You must be the guy the devs balance this game around. How you been man?
---
i picked this up recently and this meme is completely lost on me
---
At the moment it didnt seem like a good idea because i didnt know how much progress he had so i decided to go for the grab, which clearly didnt work out.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests
---
Lowest kill rates. Plague's on the bottom 3 for every platform.
---
Imagine thinking your good by nearly escaping because you were to busy teabagging
---
I like how you grabbed him and he took off lol. Had that happen to me a few times.
---
But adrenaline rewards survs for doing well and completing their objective, while noed rewards bad play...
---
Right! Omg how could we forget about iron grasp and agitation though! Oops! We're so stupid!
---
I suppose they should remove the other emotes cause they ruin the fun.
---
"It's very important that you know that I am better than you."
---

Or, do totems.
---
Mortality clarified with a single blow!
---
idk about survivor is easy
---
i think all sides have fairly same difficulty just in other skills
---
I'm rank 5 Nurse on console, it isn't bad as long as you know how to deal with the loss of frames.
---
What a dipshit.
---
As much as I hate to admit it, as a prestige 3 Claudette ( don't use the cosmetics) and a killer main, I see soooo many fuckin shit P3 skin claudettes being the most useless or cunty teammates. I've decided to become a David and Ace player to better suit my personality.
---
Look you want survivors to have a little hope of actually making it out.
---
The ancestor is the entity
---
Definitely the one on the right! It pops way more. :)
---
Wait what you can play DBD mobile now?
---
Actually, the tip system is. I assumed it was every time when I came off hiatus.
---
wwH
---
Yes yes I was the only Claudette dressed in the school clothes cosmetics and I still got tunneled the fuck out of from the basement. I get hooked in the basement, I get saved, Huntress is right outside the basement and I die.
---
I just dont understand to console players can we please make it universal knowledge if a player points and waves when you are already searching a chest they must have plunders or Ace most of the time people dont want your item they want you to have a better one
---
Look, it's only unfair if it gives the Killer an advantage. Survivors should actually have jetpacks, but these Killer mains just keep whining about getting genrushed then BMed in chat.
---
I‚Äôd be titled because I CANT SEE A THING
---
Idk how new it is, it‚Äôs been around at least since late October, cause that‚Äôs when I started playing.
---
Is this legit?
---
Second example happened to me tonight. There was this Kate that would sit at pallet loops directly in my line of sight hoping I'd engage, and after I picked up on what she was doing I stopped chasing her and focused on other survivors. They then proclaimed they "broke my ankles" in chat. Keep in mind, I'm still learning how to play killer. Logically then, why would I waste my time getting looped on a survivor that's purposefully baiting me when I know for a fact others are working on gens and my attention needs to be on them? That's not "breaking my ankles", that's deductive reasoning.
---
Oh yes, I'm definitely going to reply. I agree, we all have different experiences. You just experienced, 'Making yourself look like a cunt' &amp; 'Exposing yourself as having the opinions of a spoilt crybaby cunt'. Hopefully you learn the right lessons from these experiences. 
---
Oh and no, I'm not a toxic survivor main. I play both sides, to red rank, very fairly. 
---
But yes, I would T-bag you at the exit.
---
Of course it's two Dwights
---
No but git gud tho. It's your responsibility to, even though they're the one who got hooked.
---
I almost exclusively pick jeff.
---
Does it really matter who you pick? Any character can use any perk... so does it really matter?
---
I legit thought it was just going to be a chatlog of him being obscenely toxic after a SWF win.
---
I do this and expect the person to take the hit but they don't and now I'm suddenly being fucked
---
why have a fucking attitude? why be rude it's disgusting and no you aren't stating facts you're being rude
---
Lol what the fuck? 
---
Where in my comment was i rude?
---
Multi-Dwight isn't a bug.
---
Multi-Dwight is the reckoning.
---
I don't think his point is that it's toxic, it's just a flag of a new/bad player.
---
cant you just rate the suggestion and dont post "do totems" crap i have frickin arguments why this needs rework
---
 
---
* you dont know if the killer has noed
---
* takes a long time searching totems to totally counter it and you dont know if the killer has so it could just been a big waste of time
---
* even after exit gates are powered you must look for hex totem to counter it
---
* by that time at least one survivor has been hooked
---
so it litteraly punishes survivors for not wasting 10 minutes searching for totems or punishes them for cleansing all bec killer didnt have noed
---
its loss for two choices
---
there is literaly no counter to it
---
Gotta get those meta perks.
---
Do you have any dark green to replace the black with? I like the left one, but the arms do look too skinny.
---
I get them all the time now at red ranks on ps4, really good ones. Please help me.
---
*coughs* You mean "Jeff", right?
---
Being tunneled ticks me off, but then I remember that rank means nothing and I like de-piping.  On to the next match.
---
Well, IDK about console, but I can empathize with just wanting to have fun. As soon as it becomes a war to prevent shitty people from being happy, it's no longer fun.
---
Wait...... isn‚Äôt that why we play DbD
---
but she's feeding Myers
---
I was last season, now 3 again üòÅ/
---
I havent seen this Kate skin before
---
Tunneling is what good killers do. Hard tunneling is rare.
---
I will have your finest milk steak with a side of jelly beans.
---
Omg what have I done? I got so caught up in calling out the killers.
---
I can't stand Billy. I don't want him nerfed into the ground because that's not fun for either side. But the fact he can rev his chainsaw and keep the same speed is beyond bs. If the slowed him down while he did that and gave him a cool down (since it's a one hit kill) I feel he'd be fine. But as of right now, I hate every time I face a Billy. It kills any enjoyment I have with the game.

Their decisive strikes certainly don‚Äôt care who you go for.

That unhook right as you landed the freebie is true to form.

Ohhh. I never bothered memorizing his abilities.
---
It's not what I load it up to do, but once you've been teabagged by an obvious SWF, I'm envious if you can still manage fun.
---
I think you're right. He clearly didn't say you are in you're. He said your. Xbox gamers are so kind these days.
---
I used to dodge swf. Now I slug them all.
---
Oh, they're supposed to LAND the pallets?
---
I just get that treatment for looking at them near one, no matter how many I dodge.
---
NOBODY CARES.
---
If you play alot...
---
1) Level characters to unlock the teachable perks you will use.
---
2) Get Ash to 50.  Ash is the man.
---
3) Save 1 million BP for when Bill releases
---
4) Get bill to 50
---
5) Prestige bill (or ash) after you use his blood point offerings/best items
---
I'd focus on your favorite characters and then work on prestiging the others.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I just gave you a follow and I'll look out for whatever else you have. I really like them. I think huntress is my favourite even though I dont play as her very often lol
---
Well, no other perk makes dull totems a meaningful part of the match.
---
Well there's Bond, Empathy and Aftercare, but you'd have to sacrifice a perk slot :^)
---
Fuckable
---
Yeah, I'm personally kinda bad. She's doesn't even play her. She really likes wrath
---
Devour hope is pure random.
---
I stopped drawing because I suck and never got even marginally better four years later. I love art but I have no talent.

I was going to say the same thing. I just couldn't remember his name.

It's a sign to stop self-caring.
---
Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow... :(
---
You're the one person who uses SFM to create non-pornographic material. Careful, the FBI may kidnap you to study the uniqueness of your brain.
---
Pretty good analogy
---
And find those perks. I find it odd that everyone just kind of talks about perks as a given when they're provided on an RNG basis and all lost on prestige.
---
It could be Hopper, even if he would be dead he could be a surv, Tapp is a dead Saw-character.
---
You've used the same insult 3 times without any evidence and you've resorted to trying to use my karma as you're majn point, its sad really. I reslly dont care about my karma and the only reason it's so low is because retards like you get angry when they see a post that disagrees with their opinion. I mean really dude you got pretty angry for no reason, and you're only making yourself look like a fool, just stop.
---
But if we let them continue maybe they'll all ragequit forever :D
---
Lagswitchers ban only last 12 hours tho
---
Sunday
---
Honestly no. Hag is pretty balanced imo
---
Tbh pinata wraith would be fucking awesome. But that one with the shroud over his head is too good to not use
---
Adrenaline activates for completing your objective while NOED activates for failing to do so.
---
Learn to play the Nurse. It‚Äôs all you can do if you wanna win against people like that.
---
Most new players play as Dwight, which is why they hide in lockers more. Took me till level 33 to realize Dwight‚Äôs perks suck
---
Nah, they'll trip all the Hag traps on their way to it, and then she'll down the both of you
---
excuse me? I am a P3 nurse in red ranks, and tunneling is only necessary against toxic survivors....
---
The worst part is no matter how many times you try and escape. The game will just not let you leave. Which is completely bull.
---
Combine it with Tenacity, Resilience, and Dead hard. Ultimate meme value
---
I feel like billy should be replaced with micheal myers. i just picked the guy up and without fail, every damn match i have with him will see me find one survivor and then suddenly all the gens will decide they want to hurry up and go see the endgame rerelease, and i‚Äôll have 2 minutes to down and hook 4 survivors
---
I just had this happen the other day when I was playing Ghostface. I could see survivors‚Äô auras and which way they were facing on the gens. I couldn‚Äôt believe it, until it was consistent throughout the match.
---
Don't let this thread die please
---
Leave my mother out of this!
---
&gt; I'm not the one to be messing with
---
LMAO
---
well no other hex perk is invisible
---
so you must make a quess if killer has noed and if not you waste so much time
---
if its not insta down perk its ruin 2.0
---
Same thing has happened to me actually! It's been every match! I could see which way they were facing on the gens and it's been super easy lately to just pull them off.
---
nice i love the concept, but it would be better if both floors were accessible by fixing the appropriate generator.
---
Oh heck I can't believe I didn't think of that- Yesterday I got looped so much by a bunch of high ranked survivors that I almost fell when I stood up for a break due to getting so dizzy
---
Don't give shitty people an excuse to fuck over their teammates.
---
Does the nurse need balancing? Yes. Does this give players impunity to ruin the game for everybody else in the match? No.
---
‚ÄúFailing gen will attract the killer but it can also distract killer from the claudette using self care, because stitching a wound is noisier than a *exploding car engine*‚Äù
---
You buy the full chapter.
---
I mean, its really fun when I use. each to their own, I guess.
---
I run deliverance so I can sacrifice myself and  be the one being camped instead. Jump off the hook, waste the killers time, decisive strike, waste more time, dead hard, waste even more time, quick and quiet for some locker Jukes and usually that gives my team the time they need to finish all the gens and all of us getting out üòÇ plus it‚Äôs a super fun build
---
Now imagine that with tool boxes and prove thyself
---
Damn, I bought the pig and detective tapp separately. Thank you for answering my question
---
It‚Äôs part of the game in my eyes. Throwing the debate of killers op vs survivors toxic out the window, you got to get over the fact that sometimes you play survivor and a killer runs all the annoying perks, just like survivors will run annoying perks when you play killer. It‚Äôs a game of wits, you must adapt, outsmart, and predict.
---
I still derank cause killers get boring to play against at rank 5 and lower. They all run the same perks and play the same 6 killers. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs hard, cause I dont try, but it‚Äôs a game, I play for it to be fun, not to spend 20 minutes on a boring match for a shitty amount of bloodpoints. I can get a good 21k in a 8 minute match. And same goes for when I play killer, red rank survivors are either super immersed, or waste time so the match takes longer to progress.
---
And New Part
---
Damn dude excellent use of one of my favorite words. I especially liked "spoilt, crybaby cunt." Def my favorite. You fucking poet, you.
---
it‚Äôs amazing how many people you meet that don‚Äôt know you can be pulled out of hatch
---
Well.. it was Pride month anyways... you gotta take what you get.
---
Just don‚Äôt get downed 4head
---
90% of the time, they say this because they still feel defeated by letting their entire team die and they're convinced that their is some kind of "external victory" to be won outside of the game, and so they say things like this in a desperate attempt to invalidate your victory so they can try to feel better about their loss. Most of the time this does not work either.
---
Oh that's cool I actually only play PS4. Maybe we can play a game sometime if you're up for it.
---
Lol I dont mind no ed anymore bc I just cleanse all the totems üòÇ easy. but what's up with you comparing dead hard to that. They dodged a hit is equal to you one hitting them if the didnt cleanse all 5 totems and repairing all 5 gens?  Idkkk sounds weird
---
You can be rank one by tunneling and camping or rank five with everyone having fun, plus you‚Äôll improve faster
---
Am i the only one who sees the hilarity of him using the survivor with the luck based perks
---
The only rules I believe In for killer as a survivor main is no face camping, basement camping or proxy camping within your terror radius or tunnelling a survivor straight off the hook and NOED passed rank 12 Everything else is fair game
---
Or just become a nurse main.
---
Too OP. It‚Äôs basically Hag without any counter play. (You can‚Äôt even use Urban Evasion since you move at 100% speed.)
---
‚ÄúPalletstun this you casul‚Äù
---
He does not know of the pain ahead
---
‚ÄúWhere did all the pallets go‚Äù
---
Just takes practice
---
Yeah, gen grabs have been sinisterly easy, especially when night shroud is active. I can just walk up behind them, knowing which way they‚Äôre probably looking, and then put them on a hook and use my Pop Goes the Weasel. 
---
It feels so dirty having this information fed to me during the game, but I can‚Äôt just ignore someone doing gen progress.
---
Yeah, im 100% down dog
---
There is no point. But... When I do a gen rushing build I put in No Mither, Resilience, Spine Chill (for action speed and awareness), and Prove Thyself. Only do this if you're confident on not getting hit.

Slab and Hair tuft Myers

I just want to ask why 360ing is on the list it takes skill and can prevent me dying am I supposed to just take the hit or something?
---
Then people can just code the robot to walk 5 meters back and forth... I like where this conversation is going lol
---
V nice she's fun to play and hard to master
---
Oh lord, as a Killer main, I wish I came across more teams who abandoned their hooked allies
---
That's the advice I like.
---
Oh the weekly noed crybaby thread...
---
If it‚Äôs not better than Nurse it‚Äôs not OP.
---
F
---
I find it odd that you wouldn't have even one of them on any character. If I want to use a certain perk build I go by who has the perks first and who I'd like to play second.
---
Also personally I like not having all perks on every char, forces you to try new builds.
---
That is not my point, my point is that you can have fun if you don‚Äôt do it
---
It would‚Äôve been so cool but I had to go do errands.
---
That was the joke, yes.
---
yes, that's pretty obvious
---
Its released on mobile in certain countries
---
Not comparing, I'm a rank 1 killer and it's literally on at least 3-4 of the players build.
---
Fun fact about the Speed Limiter:  
---
It works with NOED.
---
Just play Doc. That guys already super happy. He laughs so much.
---
&gt;:)
---
Literally every Nea and Feng use the same ugly pink hair.
---
Sounds like you lost to a ghost face, then a billy, and then a Myers
---
Lmao, that might‚Äôve been me
---
Okay - it‚Äôs better than Nurse. Being able to instantly teleport up to 10 separate areas on the map and force players to crouch-walk the entire game would end with 4ks and 0 gens done in the majority of games. Throw Ruin in there and it‚Äôs a GG EZ for the Killer every match.
---
But are those worth it as first teachables.  I recommend either Claud or David for wglf. Self care is pretty good for new players. Prove thyself and leaders benefits aren‚Äôt all that great either since rank 20s don‚Äôt genrush since they‚Äôre still immersed. I would recommend getting Jake second or third when you have more experience. Bond is useless if you don‚Äôt know what the auras are doing
---
I love it!. Also opinions typo xd
---
It comes from entitled survivors.
---
They're allowed to do their objective asap all they want but the killer has to be inefficient.
---
I used it the same way but most people I play with online tend to wiggle once the killer is GONE so show "hey come get me".
---
Unfortunately not as universal as you'd think.
---
Just do gens
---
You do know that dedicated servers won't fix anything in regards to lag?
---
Someone that has poor connection to you is still going to have poor connection. Laggy hits will still happen, there is no fixing lag.
---
Darkest dungeon crossover, I dig
---
It‚Äôs literally just the hag. Crouch and the power is useless.
---
Haha thanks g
---
What's funny is seeing people already D/Cing against Nurse...
---
... on DBD Mobile.
---
Fengs are usually noobies or Military Coordinated SWF members from my experience.
---
Ace mains usually dont take the game too seriously, but can be gods.
---
Tapp mains are an absolute mystery. You never know what you gonna get.
---
This is why the pig should have a bigger fov when crouched
---
Sabotaging your teammates, usually on purpose.
---
Bodyblocking them so they can't get away from the killer, throwing pallets when you aren't even being chased so that your teammates can't use them, not unhooking a teammate even tho you're close to them and the killer isn't around, purposefully missing skillchecks to regress generators, bodyblocking the gate switch, ~~using autodidact~~, etc.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong on this, I haven't played in a month, but didn't they remove the ability to grab survivors at the hatch? I think they removed this when they added the endgame collapse.
---
did they? i started playing again a week ago (Love hate relationship games are best taken in shifts) and i didn‚Äôt think of that actually.
---
You see it break it, noed always lingers in the darkness!
---
"I always wondered what became of that unfortunate little Dwight..."
---
Had us in the first half
---
haha I never would do that to you. Trust me bb ;)
---
GIVE ME SOME IF THAT DARKEST DUNGEON LOVE! YES PLEASE! WE NEED MORE MOSQUITOES!
---
Console buddy, on console you never find anyone below 40. It's always 90 or above. The common matchmaking it around 130 to 180 MS.
---
Tunneling is focusing solely on that specific survivor and essentially rushing them off the map.  They get unhooked and you're basically right on their ass immediately to rehit them to the ground and pop them right back onto the hook.  I read your comments and it sounds like you did tunnel a bit.  Most inexperienced players do it.  As you play more and more of the game you get better and feel confident switching targets to get more bloodpoints and a better pip rather than constantly focusing down one survivor at a time.
---
Knowing this subreddit, it's probably just an old repost from when DS was actually an issue. Either that or OP is a baby. Either is a terrible option, really.

GIVE.ME.MORE.
---
(The art is amazing)
---
Care to explain how running D Strike makes you new or bad?
---
U right
---
Survivors can do quite a lot to control the game for themselves. Forcing the killer to waste time and chase you down, sabotaging/hindering their power (like popping Hag traps when she's carrying a survivor), luring the killer into loops and wasting their time with that, knowing where unpowered and powered gens are to keep the killer away from the unpowered obes for your team.
---
&gt; force players to crouch-walk the entire game
---
That's the joke of this post. This is the Hag. I'm salty
---
I do lmao. It's stressful.
---
what a beautiful thread, I'm glad i caught this lmao
---
Hag can be countered by Urban Evasion, regular crouching (if UE isn‚Äôt equipped), and by destroying her traps with flashlights. Hag also can‚Äôt lay so many traps on the map at once. But in this scenario, anyone with Urban Evasion is instantly screwed because they can‚Äôt physically move that slow. There are also only 7 gens on a map, so that leaves three traps for any other area that might be of use to survivors (i.e. the basement, center of the map, or both exit doors.)
---
And how big is the ‚Äútrigger‚Äù area of these traps? 4 meters? Even that small, with ten traps that‚Äôs 40 meters on the map that are a ‚Äúcrouch only‚Äù zone. Without knowing where the traps are (and if the Killer is smart, the survivors won‚Äôt), they‚Äôll be forced to crouch at 28% speed the entire game or risk an instant hit/down. 
---
Add a small terror radius and you have a guaranteed pain in the ass, OP Killer.
---
*Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer...*
---
&gt;"Oh, we're being toxic now, huh? Let's see how toxic you are when I bring an Ebony Mori!"

Semi new guy here, what‚Äôs tunneling?
---
IT'S MA'AM!
---
I got survivors about 5 ranks above me playing a killer I have one perk and nothing else on for a daily. They obviously won and went all "gg ez noob bby killer" on me. When I replied that of course they won looking at the loadout they just didn't reply anymore lmao.

listen...the idea of a killer that can look like a survivor is great, everyone thinks about it, but it is hard countered by SWF and pretty much useless against good survivors whobare aware of their surroundings
---
Why does no one mention how Ghostface's mori looks like hes straddling you and putting his Richard in your hole.
---
Nope. Read it again. The first few are very small nerfs to meta perks and the rest are buffs.
---
Yo, this Branflake Man needs porn. STAT!
---
You still get value out of it, slowing down gens is practical use of the perk and a reason why you might not want to run it anyway as you get its benefits regardless.
---
While you don't get ANY benefits of Adrenaline if it doesn't go off.
---
well, clearly it's Spirit and Billy since at red ranks, 95% of my matches are just these 2 (for me). Nurse is pretty good since the framerate has improved, Huntress and Hag can be a nightmare to face if players would've played them more.
---
There's no such thing as talent. Practice makes perfect! 
---
Just fffucking dRRRAAAAAAWWW!
---
It's sweaty every match just about. They need to implement a rewards system.
---
You‚Äôll get reported for teaming. If someone gets footage you‚Äôll both be banned.
---
Also, yeah, it‚Äôs a pretty big dick move. Best not to do that.
---
I think I knew what every perk and killer ability in the game did before I even started playing. My friend showed me the game, and then I spent the next two hours staring at the screen, going through everything and asking him what everything meant. And then I went home and kept reading on the wiki.
---
Probably a bug /s
---
So is ghostface, once a swf team coordinates, GF cant steakth at all. I made Wolf to counter this, being as a false Accusation will harm the entire team. Even a proDBD player will mess up once, and that once will more than likely ruin the team for a few. 
---
Even in the flip side of this, GF is Garbo against swf, but still if played with extreme caution, he can be extremly viable in high ranks. Hell, even myers.
---
Praise NOED, anti-teabag assurance policy.
---
is it just novelty value? don't you get no points that way?
---
Yes
---
The dumb moron even said "Green Iron doesn't get you that far."
---
I've literally been a lvl 1 killer before (currently lvl 5 because rank reset and I mostly play survivor rn) and didn't have to run noed against SWFs to get 4ks. You're just a trash fucking killer. Get tf outa my face with that "it's all we have to counter" lmfao and I'm the inexperienced/ lazy one here.
---
Yeah it's unlucky.
---
I cant say I'd drink the hags
---
&gt;play the game for fun
---
Exactly this\^
---
But after all these years its just impossible right now. When you are an experienced survivor, this game becomes just unwinnable for killer, you would really have to do some stupid mistakes to let the killer get 3k or 4k. Thats why last 3 matches I played only as spirit, this girl lets me get 4k. And do you know what survivors think about it?

AND MY KEY
---
Well now we said it.
---
Nope, i use the beanie.
---
You're  very talented
---
What rank are you? I find that at the higher ranks people are more likely to go for saves in order to pip.
---
Even with that in mind, addons augment his power which i havent listed. Certain ones make it harder to work on gens when he works on them, or evenexposing the team if accused wrong (thats iradescent) 
---
If you played your cards right, and understand your character, he could play as a slow down killer and make the game slower by having to watch your back and keep asking 'Is that you' its the point of him. Paranoia. 
---
Yes, i understand that swf is strong and disguise isnt optimal, but swf against any killer is strong. With the right perks and a few addons, he could be really good. 
---
I play Legion at rank 3, and yeah its bat shiz hard and often infuriating to do anything, but i play him good and average a 3k, even against swf (and one group that messaged me legions op and reported me lol)
---
I‚Äôve been running jus plunderers on console the last week. The first thing I do is go and open all the chests. I leave the items there for people, but I usually take one. 
---
I‚Äôve been getting tons of purple medkits, flashlights, toolboxes, and keys. I usually always keep the pink key for myself. Multiple times yesterday I was pulling two purple/pink keys a game. It was great.
---
I‚Äôd even message the other survivors after I died and tell them I dropped a key, so they could get hatch. I just don‚Äôt want that killer to get a 4K.
---
Not cool.
---
Im just finding this out myself but im to trash at the game to be toxic so ill continue using Nea
---
lol
---
Beat meat to it
---
I remember playing ghostface and the only reason I got a 2k was because the survivors got WAY too cocky and messed up so bad. I wish instead of having to rely on survivors making mistakes it‚Äôd be more mindgames which is why I‚Äôm hoping that these map reworks will make that possible.
---
you stole this line from a movie but I cant remember which one
---
when did they say they run NOED?they're just saying that it is incredibly easy to counter and that if you cant be bothered to cleanse a totem instead og focusing entirely on gens, its you fault, killers have to protect gens while trying to get kills, kicking gens takes away time from the killer that could lead to the survivors winning. Deal with it, if you dislike NOED, play around it
---
I cosplay while streaming and have warn all sorts of masks from giant teddy bear heads to just sunglasses when i'm cosplaying ace visconti. This one is actually very easy to see through. The mesh is very thin and only darkens my vision a little bit for which i compensate by turning up the gamma on my monitor. Good question.
---
I've seen this lvl of delusion.
---
Dead hard gives a distance advantage. Especially when used in conjunction with windows and pallets.
---
Killers: camping, tunnelling.
---
Survivors: 4xBNP or Instaheal. 
---
Everyone: don't be an asshole and remember everyone is trying to have fun not just you.
---
Doesn't seem that hard to follow.
---
lol really dude? I'vemade great points against tunneliing killers... what have u done?
---
From the Devs:  
---
 "Following the 3.0.0 update, many people experienced longer than normal Killer queue times. In short, the longer queue times were caused by an abnormally large number of players playing as Killer, resulting in not enough Survivors to fill their lobbies. While queue times are expected to be longer when a new chapter launches, it seems to be exacerbated when a Killer is not accompanied by a Survivor. Additionally, the Bloodhunt and subsequent Anniversary Celebration appears to have caused more people to switch sides to maximize their bloodpoint earning. We will keep these factors in mind as we move forward, but we will also be making changes to the Survivor bloodpoint scoring to help alleviate this issue in the future."
---
No rank 1 killer uses noed. I call shenanigans.
---
All exhaustion perka are good and even better when you upgrade them to reduce the cooldown. Except mayve head on cause this perk just wont work good. Urban evasion is great to level up you can sneak at full walking speed all the time. Level up iron will to be complete silence when you are hurt. Quick and quiet is a really good perk and can be very usefull in chases. My personal favorite is diversion. You can use it in so many ways
---
How does it represent r/deadbydaylight?
---
This is my first full week of fully investing my time in DBD, ive had it downloaded for awhile now only playing kill your friends but now i can say im pretty addicted. 
---
I think being killer is extremely fun but its not for me, ill let you killer mains do what you do best ;) 
---
Survivor gives me a rush i enjoy immensely. I cant wait to play some more
---
Me when I get insta downed my Iri Heads or pulled off a gen by gen snatcher spirit
---
Thank you, finally someone with some God damn common sense. Welcome lmfao
---
Ruin gets stomped within first minute usually. Use Pgtw.
---
A. you were rank 1 killer yeah? so you should know a killer can tell if its a SWF. if you see 4 survivors join in at once, your going to prepare for SWF, thats what i gathered from that. He uses NOED agaibst SWF.
---
B. kicking gens doesnt take much time, yes, but lets look at it respetively; 15s to a survivor is just 15 more seconds touching gens. a gen kick for a killer is the possibility that a surv can reach a good loop which will waste more of the killers time. a strong loop usually takes about 15-20s if the killer knows what they are doing (not counting shack or buildings).
---
i see a lot of david‚Äôs and i‚Äôm a david main myself (though i‚Äôm switching to bill when he comes to console) 
---
and i see a few kate‚Äôs but jeff is probably because he doesn‚Äôt have good perks and he is very large character (and being released with the most hated killer might have an affect)
---
The highlighted perks are the best ones in my opinion. Ultimately, you need to choose according to your play style. 
---
Ace - Open-Handed, Up the Ante and **Ace In The Hole**.
---
Adam - Diversion, **Deliverance** and Autodidact. 
---
Ash - Flip-Flop, Buckle Up and Mettle of Man.
---
Bill - Left Behind, **Borrowed Time** and **Unbreakable**.
---
Claudette - Empathy, Botany Knowledge and **Self-Care**.
---
David - **We're Gonna Live Forever**, **Dead Hard** and No Mither. 
---
Dwight - Bond, Prove Thyself and Leader. 
---
Feng - Technician, **Lithe** and Alert.
---
Jake - **Iron Will**, Calm Spirit and Saboteur.
---
Jane - Solidarity, Poised and Head On. 
---
Jeff - Breakdown, Aftercare and Distortion. 
---
Kate - Dance with Me, Windows of Opportunity and Boil Over.
---
Laurie - Sole Survivor, Object of Obsession and **Decisive Strike**.
---
Meg - **Quick and Quiet**, **Sprint Burst** and **Adrenaline**.
---
Nea - **Balanced Landing**, **Urban Evasion** and Streetwise. 
---
Quentin - Wake Up, Pharmacy and Vigil. 
---
Tapp - Tenacity, Detective's Hunch and Stake Out.
---
I think people should get permabanned for ragequiting. With 100$(dollar) cost of unban.
---
This way we gonna get rid of some ragequiters. Other poor ones gonna be afraid and even if some reacher a-hole ragequit. Devs gonna have money to keep servers up for quite some time
---
I'll have you know not all of us need NOED to play killer.   I wreck plenty of swf groups without resorting to the end of game participation trophy that is NOED.  Just apply relentless map pressure and make intelligent decisions midchase and you can win games without the training wheels.  Play aggressive, try to constantly keep them disrupted by forcing them to leave gens for altruism.  Pop Goes the Weasel is fantastic now post rework and helps bigtime.  Highly reccomend.
---
/a
---
Just cleanse totems 4Head
---
If you don't want to cleanse totems they you pay the price if you get caught when the gates get powered. It's one of the few perks that can actually efficiently counter gen rushing. That being said a rarely use it on any killers besides wraith since it seems people like gen rushing wraiths.
---
How gory is it?
---
It probably has nothing to do with playing nurse. They dont know youre playing nurse yet. Its probably just them disconnecting on their own
---
Making Gens :)
---
demogordon
---
Thank u so much :) 
---
That‚Äôs actually rly helpful !
---
Pop, bbq, and whatever else. I use haunted ground + ruin and almost always get an exposed down every game. Range add-ons are the best. Don't get used to having more than 2 blinks. Learn every survivor you play against, do they double back after they turn a corner? If so blink to the corner and not past it. Learn what they do when they break line of sight. Also get used to playing with 100% sensitivity because it helps a ton
---
"I uhhh... accidentally DCd"
---
Ok.
---
Off-topic but I would've loved either Jessica Biel from the 2003 one or Sally from the original as the survivor that came with LF.
---
That is very true like for me, if i think the survivor is better than me then i'll be boosted af like i get this weird annoying feeling and my heart starts beating faster and when i try to chase someone my eyes are all over the place and i can't focus. Idk if anyone can relate but this happens so many times.
---
**D w e e t**
---
Rank says nothing other than ‚ÄúI played a lot since the reset‚Äù.
---
9/10 if you're gen rushing without breaking totems, you are gonna get wrecked by noed. Every time i see a dull i break it because of the chance there is noed God forbid they run bloodwarden with it. I've had a fair amount of games go to shit in endgame from these two perks. But most importantly if all your doing is gens and escaping as fast as possible. You will not pip in lower ranks.
---
Freddy is atill weaker. They got the same speed. But leatherface can attack without waiting after reaching a survivor. Freddy prob got the better lounge but bubba can deal with pallets way better and trigger people to throw pallets down, wat makes him a better chaser then freddstar. Also leatherface can instadown people. Its also easier to lead survivors with bubba in an direction you want because they have to avoid open places
---
Mild. There‚Äôs blood and aside from the hag mori where you see a liver there isn‚Äôt much. None of the character models are made to show like guts and gore. 
---
So basically just blood.
---
Increase to 100s and remove the pause after you hit a good ruin check so you can keep working on it. Ez win
---
Even as a killer main, I agree that these changes are too much. I can understand being a bit salty about them, but it doesn't justify changing perks that are fine as is.
---
People are dumb.  I never get mad unless a killer is hard camping a hook for no reason, or 3 genning on purpose (which is easy to tell when you are a surv who realises it early and are trying absolutely everything to lure them away and they continually refuse to move away for any reason)
---
Also couple of issues that were in the main game. People getting stuck in lockers and pallets.
---
Also that look behind you button I think is a little useless.
---
Freddy much weaker but after the rework it will be between him and legion on who is the worst
---
Literally no where did I ever say it was overly effective you fucking idiot I was making the point that it actually effects the gameplay. Unlike cleansing totems. If nobody runs up and taps the gen then it will regress a significant amount. Also perks like pop goes the weasle and overcharge make kicking gens much more effective I think you need to learn how to fucking read and not make assumptions you dumb fuck. Might make you not sound like a dumb fuck.
---
It‚Äôs not back, hatch has been unchanged since egc :)
---
Oh no worries, that's what I took from your posts. It's kinda "meh" that survivors can just stop er from gaining her bloody spit, as it is part of her power (not as bad as survivors looking at Ghostface but still). However I found it to be just as well if they don't heal.   
---
Sure, I can't spit them to death over pallets, but they're extremely easy to find and broken. Add to this the usual enduring+spirit fury combo and I will get them after two pallets or earlier, even if they loop like mad. It's beautiful.  
---
And I like it because it punishes survivors who mindlessly pallet loop. There's nothing wrong with looping, but if looping is the only thing you know to do, you're gonna have a bad time vs. Lady Adiris.
---
It used to be a horrorgame 3 years ago when everyone was a noob and the bing bong boi was everyones biggest fear lol
---
Oh no they pressed ctrl repeatedly, oh shit, oh no, I can already feel my mental health decline.
---
Seriously, people will always bm in any game, just ignore it.
---
If you have some more girlfriends, sure, hand them over.
---
Don't tell them to let you do something, instead mention that they should look in the open chests since you will leave anything you find in them.
---
"I'm running treasure hunter build.  Check open chests for gifts :D"
---
Even though the end result is the same, psychologically it registers as they're fucking themselves over - rather than messing with you and your plans.
---
Omg this is hilarious XD
---
Please explain to me why selling virtual cosmetics is a bad thing. Right now all I see is just more crotchety rambling "EVERYTHING WAS BETTER AT MY AGE", sorry but that's how you come across.
---
really? it happens quite a lot when I play nurse, Probably 50% of the time.
---
Could be coincidence. What rank are you?
---
I do find when I'm going through grass or trees that I can't see anything :')
---
Also fuck yeah for sneakman
---
doing gens? or are you the guy that makes them?
---
Just in theory:
---
The killer will take approximately 20-30s to find a survivor, a chase with a well experienced survivor and killer not accounting for Instadowns takes around 30-40s. If the survivor is either the obsession or in comms with anybody adding the killers roughly 15-20s to actually hook a survivor by the time you're done with a SINGLE hooked survivor 3 gens could be done. Of course it depends on killer ability, element of surprise, items, spawns, great skillchecks and coordination but the fact that an optimal WILL look like this is reason enough to use ruin.
---
Oink
---
just because they downvote me doesn't me they don't like me.... it just means they disagree with the good points I've made
---
This is a bug then as it should be slightly faster after the change.
---
The rate of recovery was always set to 1, Enduring boosting it to 1.75 which meant a stun of 4 sec would be divided by 1.75.
---
Now it simply halves the stun, which should be stun in seconds divided by 2.
---
Source: dev stream (don‚Äôt ask me which one but iirc either McLean or Horvath explained Enduring once).
---
My thought exactly
---
What are you talking about
---
like 10
---
I have that issue on Ghost Face too. I should have maybe thought of the connection between the two.
---
Ahhh. So you \*are\* a crotchety old man troll. :-)
---
I agree with the other guy just cleanse totems.
---
Just wait until you get to like rank 4 or 5. The dodging is incredible
---
You REALLY don't wanna know how the sausage is made.
---
Well, the look behind button is really handy in a chase I think
---
Change exhaustion back were it was you can recover when you run
---
How in the ever loving fuck does this happen?
---
Also that's another point I wanted to bring up. Can we stop using the term gen rushing like as if the survivors are doing something wrong? It's literally their main objective to do gens. Also no its fucking not one of the few perks that can effectively counter survivors doing gens. That's probably the dumbest fucking comment I've ever read. Know what else counters survivors doing gens and escaping beside fucking trash no skill involved noed? Good rotations, not tunneling, perks that make kicking gens more effective, perks to help significantly shorten the chase, good mind games, predicting survivor movements, all of which require you to have skill and basic understanding of how the game works. And good for you not running noed you're probably a decent killer, who doesn't suck dick and has to run noed for cheap 1 hit downs.
---
Ghostface is probably the killer most likely to actually play video games.
---
They could fix him easily but they need a license for the looks of the actor. The actor himself even made a post when Freddy joined DbD stating that he had no idea that Quentin was going to be features in a video game (also stating that he may play it), so we are pretty sure they don‚Äôt have any license regarding the actor.
---
Peanits from BHVR acknowledged it in the official DBD forums. It's linked somewhere here in this thread as well.
---
Freddy can injure and put you into the dreamworld by hitting you. And he can always hit you.
---
Is that him at account level 46?
---
I would buy Clown's bathwater and drink it
---
 **Chainsaw Charging** 3.68 m/s; 92¬†% 
---
\~Wiki
---
I think Billy's fine though. He's strong but he's not broken. I find it really fun to play against current Billy.
---
Ok but Billy cant turn while chainsawing, so, in order to make sure he isnt fucked if a survivor runs behind a wall, he can move at full speed while revving. its a balancing mechanic
---
Its not about his luck, its about that hes a fucking idiot
---
Not gonna lie
---
so yea, he shouldn't
---
and he doesn not.
---
Going for the healthy survivor after an unhook means more hits, more chase and more hooks, which means more pips and more BP. That doesnt mean Im going always for the healthy survivor, but if there are 2 gens or more left I usually bring balance for my own profit.
---
How to treat pallets tbagging survivors
---
Love it my dude, but please bring forth the Trapper
---
It was fast vault
---
console sucks üò≠ i can never 180 correctly
---
This isn't counter play.
---
"Just don't pick the person up you've been downing" isn't a counter play.  
---
It's the same with dribbling regarding old DS.
---
If you would dribble a survivor you would lose time while doing it, and then the survivor would still keep the perk for his next turn.  
---
I get it that it works great as "anti tunneling" perk. But DS still hits me even though when I am not tunneling.  
---
I'll hook a person, the person will get saved, and within the 60 seconds I'll be getting 1-2 other survivors, until I down the first one again, who then proceeds to hit me with DS.  
---
I can't just "wait 60" arround the downed guy and slug.  
---
It's basically: "Ignore the person and go for someone else" or "Get hit by DS".  
---
But you can't allways just IGNORE a survivor. Especially in the late game.
---
I wish I could find it fun. But he's definitely in my top 3 least fun killers to go up against. I just hate trying to buy my team time only for him to follow me revving his chainsaw and one shot me ending the chase instantly.
---
Repost
---
Using Ds does not equal bm
---
Maybe if you didn't cuss so much in your writing I could actually understand what you were saying. Maybe you need to do some extra anger management today. Joking aside, kicking a gen without pop or overcharge and even depending on what rank you are at overcharge is pretty useless, but if you kick a gen and leave the area the survivor is just gonna hop back on. And if you chase them sure it might do like 10 or 20 seconds of regression, which surprising just the same amount of time as cleansing a totem.   
---
And really the main point of it all is if you don't like to go against NoEd there is like 5 different things you can do to stop it. You can Cleanse totems before gens are done, find the totem after the gens are done while hiding from the killer, You can just leave or pretend you are the only survivor left and do a gate that way so he doesn't find you, you can use one of your teammates as bait, or you can git gud and loop a killer going faster until they either DC or you run out the gate.   
---
Plenty of stuff to do so that you don't have to deal with it. However, there are the certain times that you just get unlucky and get hit with NoEd as soon as the last gen pops. And there is only one thing to say to that  
---
Welcome to the club of how it feels to have Ruin go down in 20 seconds of the game starting!  
---
(But seriously you might want to dial the swearing back, the mods might hear you)
---
After all the drag race memes I've seen in here I think those pair are in for a little surprise.
---
I know.   
---
Some responses below I mention that whenever you are saying that Noed ISNT BROKEN you'll get downvoted, even while giving good arguments etc.  
---
Mid-Rank survivors will never change their opinion about NOED.
---
I found the APK online and it works fine. Thanks!
---
Who you callin' pinhead?
---
I do know about those "experiments", and the only thing there's really to say about them is that they played against bad and mediocre-at-best killers, mostly. Yes, 4 good survivors trying hard to win will win the majority of their public matches. Just like a good killer trying hard to win will. For the same reason: the survivors they'll meet will be bad to mediocre at best, on average. Take marth himself - a killer main that used to stream, and won most of his matches, regardless of which killer he played. Same with tons of other streamers, that hours upon end, stream after stream, only rarely have survivors escape through the exit gates - hell, often hardly 3 gens getting done.
---
Yes, voice comms are BS. I would advocate for SWF handicaps due to the existence of voice comms, and due to the fact that they will never be "removed".
---
Your idea that killers get 3-escaped and that constitutes a balance concern can easily be countered: a competent killer can consistently tunnel at least 1 survivor to death during regular play, and then NOED/hardcamp a second survivor to death end game. That's how easily a "balanced" result can be achieved. Yes, the game is not competitively balanced for the idea that a killer will 3-hook every survivor, let alone while alternating targets, but tunnelling, camping and slugging simply do exist.
---
Again, I do think core balance is more-so in favor of survivors, but not tremendously so. To "counter" marth's streams, have a handful of streams of people that play killer and win the overwhelming majority of their matches: KOR: https://www.twitch.tv/sal_gu, https://www.twitch.tv/goku2093; RUS: https://www.twitch.tv/exize, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzycaikz6yplScJRPJwEpzw; NA: https://www.twitch.tv/zubatlel, https://www.twitch.tv/scottjund - this is just a very small selection of dozens of streamers I know that have no problem 3-4-killing all day long.
---
For the tournaments, this channel https://www.youtube.com/user/MegaMoviePlay/playlists features a number of concluded ones, and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC15_OOsLgbI7_M3fQ7P5jPA that one an ongoing one. There are again a lot more, going back as far as 2016, and even during those dark times killers still were not just being blown out. Some such examples here: https://www.twitch.tv/k1lljet/videos?filter=highlights&amp;sort=time

Stopped reading after I read you must crouch to recover. YIKES

#yOu ShOuLd LeT mE sUrViVe nOt HiM
---
‚ÄúKillers aren‚Äôt allowed to play the game optimally and we shouldn‚Äôt have to run perks to counter tunneling. ‚Äú 
---
Not saying you should always go after the unhooked person but if that‚Äôs the one you found then why not?
---
He stuck around at the exit gate just to use DS, that is the BM.
---
Scott:mario maker 2 blocks :)
---
I can accept that. I know there are things I still need to work on at rank four. I mean, I'm not rank 1 for a reason. I just find it annoying that Billy is so quick while also having the ability to one shot and it's almost identical to his usual running speed. It's one of the only killers I consistently struggle with.
---
I mean OBVIOUSLY if they‚Äôre stupid but when killers literally stand there and wait for someone to unhook just to down the person that got off it‚Äôs kinda mean when there could easily be an exchange hook situation there
---
lmao when was the last time you saw more than 2 people on a gen?
---
Yeah, I didn't think so. Stop trying to excuse your dumb ass crutches, the game continues after the first few gens and you can still kill them all in that window of time.
---
Survivors are op in that game lmao
---
10 out of 10 relatable and hilarious
---
stop, i can only get so hard
---
idk why that amount of downvotes (the rank 20 got mad) but I just got to elaborate a little bit - *sometimes it's better to hide stealthy than run*, in this situation it's okay because the killer was probably going to chase the saved survivor but that's it :D good luck on your next saves, x
---
Sometimes your big brain plays are so complex that the new killers don‚Äôt understand, and then u just mind game yourself. Vice versa happens to me when I play spirit, my fake phases literally never work on rank 17+
---
Yooooo....you are doing God's work. As someone who plays killer I'm like OK I hate you but as a survivor I'm like ü§îü§î
---
No no, its a survivor which disconnects after being caught while tbagging at the pallet
---
Please consider putting on your grown-up pants.
---
Downing 3 survivors in the span of a minute isn't a common situation man.  You're grossly overstating the use of Decisive.  Again I don't tunnel and I don't eat decisive as result.  To call Decisive a crutch at this point is just ridiculous.  It punishes babykillers from camping and hard tunneling you off hook.  Killers that eat it regularly literally do it to themselves with their playstyle.  
---
How is Adrenaline skilless?  They repaired all their objectives for a brief couple second window of benefit.  They have to go out of their way to earn it.  Killers can just go afk and not play the game and still earn theirs lol.  I've actually faced that before.  Meme Wraith who would afk during the game until endgame when noed proced lol.
---
And I agree they do run NOED as a safety blanket.  That's the problem.  They know they have their mindless instadown and haste to fall back on so they're less likely to break off a chase to apply map pressure.  Overcommiting to chases is the most common characteristic associated with NOED gamers.  I make the argument the perk opens them up to gen rushing because of the playstyle it often invites.  You can often tell if a killer is running it early on by watching how they chase.
---
This is false because if you were all P3 claudettes we would not see you.

I was playing survivor recently and in the chat there was one guy who said he was gonna chase the killer around. Instead for most of the game I ended up being chased and, when he did, he got downed and hooked in the first few seconds. The guy was on his last hook and barely escaped in the end, only did so because we were taking hits for him. And in the end he still wrote "ha gg ez". In that moment I wished the guy had just died

Memes aside, it is a good question, though. Why the fuck are broken keys and key add-ons in the game? Why haven't they been reworked? They're garbage.
---
Say that louder for the people in the back that are busy on their phones not paying attention.
---
So specific, you know you did it to em good. Did they happen to be a Billy or Leatherface by chance? Or better yet a Legion?
---
&gt; I know there are things I still need to work on at rank four. I mean, I'm not rank 1 for a reason.
---
Rank doesn't mean anything... A lot of people reach rank 1 by urban evading around, working on gens, making saves, escaping or even dying (you still pip) and barely interacting with the killer. 
---
Just get yourself involved with the killer, practice chases and ranking up will be effortless for you, then you will realize how ranks mean nothing.
---
&gt;I just find it annoying that Billy is so quick while also having the ability to one shot and it's almost identical to his usual running speed.
---
He can only 1-shot you easily if you are out in the open. If there is a loop nearby, a window or even objects to run around, you can force his M1. 
---
Perhaps you need to play as Billy to understand him better? By playing as him you can learn what other survivors do to counter you.
---
Go for Decisive Strike! Seriously, it stops or heavily deters killers from tunneling and from bad unhook saves from survivors.
---
I am well aware of the times you are talking about and it is good, that we aren't there anymore. I just can't see your argument. I know it was really bad before, but that doesn't mean it's good now.
---
I've only seen one true stereotype, and that's of Claudettes being absolutely unbearable
---
Dwight might be the character I've seen the *least* in lockers besides maybe Ace
---
Jake is never the one to sabo my hooks, usually Feng
---
of course that's all personal experience &gt;!and i am also very biased because i'm a Dwight main and i'm usually the one doing all the fucking generators LMAO!&lt;
---
Done its being posted now
---
Then you'll naturally derank while playing.  You should learn more against the higher ranks if you can avoid the tilt.
---
Uh... pretty friggen often. Anytime I see a teammate on a gen, I run over and help, becase we're literally finishing the gen in half the time. Thats an extra 40 seconds we can spend doing anything else. Seeing as a good survivor should be able to loop somebody who's not the nurse for at least 30-40 seconds, we can finish a gen per chase. This really isn't a matter of "trash level gameplay" This is pure statistics and entirely shows that gens are done too quickly. Fundamentally, the game should be balanced without perks, and persks should just allow for another level of stratagy and gameplay to dead by Daylight. I agree with this guy completely, theres a reason why LITERALLY every good killer ruins Ruin with just about every single build they do. Its so nessecery on anyone but Nurse because theres so much time wasted of just running around and doing nothing. Insulting and treating people poorly just because they have a differing opinion from you isn't going to help the game get any better.
---
I picked the "normal" characters because those are free and I cannot buy coins in game for some lame reason. So I cannot buy rare characters.. üòíüòñ
---
Wdym by ‚Äútilt‚Äù? And sure mate
---
Not like the survivor who has just been hooked can't heal before you find them again...
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain a while ago the devs stated they won‚Äôt provide exact numbers in relation to slightly, moderately, considerably, etc.
---
That whole exchange was entirely too respectful for this sub.  Quick somebody throw a chair.
---
Ace mains will kobe every time,guaranteed
---
Thank you for participating in this discussion. And to answer your question: I want nerfs to things that are not balanced. And exhaustion perks are not balanced in my opinion. That's why I want to hear the opinions of other people. You should work on your behaviour in discussions. Telling people to f\*ck off and that they have a "biased noise" doesn't really make you someone I want to argue with.
---
I mean the hatch is a necessary mechanic though just to give survivor side a chance when it comes to last man.  If they had to fix 5 gens to have any means of escaping that would turn every 3K into a guaranteed 4K.  Besides with EGC the hatch close mechanic has finally shifted the power in this scenario to killers anyways.  The days of the dreaded hatch standoff are dead and  buried.
---
Thanks for your answer man. But this has nothing to do with being salty. They are in my opinion just too strong. But I would be interested in the reasons that lead to your opinion.
---
Good old fashioned Nurse
---
Holy shit this is such a funny and clever comment, you really got them good LMAO
---
Well I just kill whoever gets in my line of sight no matter their playstyle or build.. I basically play the game.
---
Sorry, it's a term I've used from League of Legends.   It's used whenever a player has had the occasional game(s) and starts to perform worse.. Basically meaning if you have a game where you have entity displeased and it'll make you play worse the next match because you're upset.
---
I know you csn just use a VPN.
---
No I‚Äôm Dirty Dan
---
That was freaking amazing- Do you have a link for the remix?
---
OP‚Äôs text sounds like a threat TBH. I‚Äôm kind of scared.
---
That's what I meant. I just didn't put it in that category for analysis purposes. But you are right, you travel distance faster with it than normally, of course.
---
Borrowed time is great for this, the amount of times I thought I had a good unhook but didn't, only for them to activate BT and that survivor runs to freedom, it's not always just assholes guys, those heartbeats get disorienting on console
---
Mmm even better
---
You bought them on the European account right? If so just wait a minute. If nothing happens check to make sure it charged your card
---
If you want keys out of the game moris need to go with them.  Premature crutch for early hatch escape vs. Premature crutch for early kills.  Two sides of the same unbalanced coin.  4 gens done for a hatch lol!  Jesus just say it man.  You feel legit entitled to a 4K every game.  The EGC is so killer sided it's a joke man.  All you got to do is find it first and close it (you are faster so not very difficult).  Once it is closed they are dead.  Only potatoes give up doors in egc unless it is a massive map and the doors got a lucky survivor spawn on opposite sides of the map.
---
It was really fun! In general I'm surprised by how much I like playing him, and I wonder if my games only go so well because I don't camp and people are thrown off by it lmao.
---
***ADVANCED TORTURE TECHNIQUE***
---
It charged already yes. And it was on my European account yes.. üòñüò≠ I hope they'll give it or that was a total waste omg.. üòî
---
That's the recommended course of action lol.  Just play the game, ranks don't mean anything unless you want the achievement for just to say you did it. You should pick up a few tricks on how to beat the red ranks and if you can't just think about what you did wrong and how you could of played it differently.  You could even record yourself and review it if it's important enough to you.
---
*giggles in nightmare*
---
No. I'm kinda new to the game.
---
True thanks mate :)
---
i'd like to see the legion
---
No love for Kate mains.

I'll just be over here playing my guitar... menacingly.
---
I feel so dumb sometimes with spirit lol, other day i was running round, fucking chase music starts out of nowhere and im sitting here like...¬† ¬´¬†...wat...¬†¬ª but then i hear the sound of a dull totem being cleaned and I snatch and immersed claud so it evens out lol
---
If you‚Äôre being toxic, in a sense you‚Äôre just being ‚Äúmeme-y‚Äù except at someone else‚Äôs expense of fun and without the ‚Äúmeme‚Äù context. So there‚Äôs a thin line, and since ‚Äúmeme-ing‚Äù on the killer can be really annoying and comes of as insulting I just wouldn‚Äôt bother. Especially considering the already massive number of toxic players, it makes sense that the line is almost none-existent without any communication.
---
You're spesh pal
---
But you're complaining about perks other than adrenaline when shit like noed and prayer beads exist so... exhaustion perks really aren't that op if you can counter them... e.g. if you know someone has lithe you cut them off windows, balanced landing funnel them away from houses... basically you can't learn how to chase people properly so you want stuff nerfed.
---
This isn‚Äôt an official dbd Reddit. They more than likely won‚Äôt see your feedback here. I‚Äôm sure they have a feedback page on their forum.
---
When are you usually on?
---
Yeah ots been an issue for a while to the point where nobody cares anymore.
---
Well you are playing dead by daylight, rank doesn't even matter a lot. In most of the situation rank just show how free time you have to play. Even at red ranks you can find the guy who urban evade around the map and camp pallets, the Larry who gets 2 sad camped kills or the killer that plays with only nurse/spirit with the best add-ons. I prefer a fast match making than a perfect one.
---
Yeah, thinking about it now, I think you're right regarding the ability to swing without punishment. Although I don't think "spamming" is the right word as you'd only be allowed to swing once after each leap AND the leaps are slower and harder to land accurately. With that said I do think that not punishing the killer for missing will be very frustrating from the survivors point of view.
---
The crouch mechaninc is an interesting idea but I have to say that with there already being a couple of killers out right now with that exact mechanic I'm not sure how fun it would be if they added yet another.
---
However I do like the idea of a "stance-switch" between 4 legged and bipedal though! Perhaps if he went into 4 legged it would give him more of an "animalistic" power allowing him to channel a tracking power. Like you mentioned, easier to see blood trails, scratchmarks being visible for longer (although this could do just as much harm), maybe some sort of scent mechanic which, depending on what way the wind is blowing, would give off a Killer Instinct or some other on screen effect.
---
And yeah something like Lon Chaney Wolfman is pretty much what I was imagining! :D
---
Imagine being spesh
---
I don't think so, maybe just get her food and tell her to go to sleep.

But he did tho?

---
Second one looks way better than the first one, the black outline really helps it stand out.
---
"Get out of here with that biased noise man." This implies not only telling me that you think my opinion is shit without any real arguments that relate to the points I made but also being disrespectful against me at the same time. Comes close to "f\*ck off" to me. Also the amounts of nerfs something gets doesn't allow for a good judgement about the current state of balance. If something was adjusted (buffed or nerfed) it requires tests and data to examine the new state of balance. Just because something was nerfed it simply doesn't mean its balanced.
---
Also you are telling me I'm "incredibly" wrong, but, again, don't relate to anything I said. Other perks are a complete different topic that have to be discussed in a seperate way.
---
Charge back through bank or call PlayStation in the morning

Middle finger üñï lookin blade no hate just a a find good art
---
I am actually, so I would hook them with pleasure
---
And here I was making fun of them :(
---
Is it really anything to do with skill? If a survivor will be dead on hook why wouldn't you take the opportunity to remove them from the game? It's one less survivor to worry about. Also as someone who runs devour hope I don't see the issue with getting chasing the unhooked survivor, it's all about them tokens!
---
This is the funniest shitpost ive seen in a while
---
Sounds likely, but either way Lv.46 is still being somewhat new, so if it is OP's friend's own account the title isn't exactly wrong.
---
Not chasing them, but immediately downing them but farming them immediately off of hook, also as someone who runs make your choice and also devour hope, I tend to go for the healthy survivor, as it makes the injured one waste time healing instead of gens
---
You should level David first for WGLF and Dead Hard and then play whoever you want using WGLF for bloodpoint gains.
---
Maybe, I'm sitting on exactly 50 hours right now and my level is only in the mid twenties, so i didn't consider 46 to be new
---
its worth it every single fucking time
---
I play him quite often, to varied success, against randoms I usually 3-4 with him against SWF I get rushed quite hard, personally my changes would be. 
---
‚Ä¢Faster Frenzy recovery

‚Ä¢re worked addons (Franks tape is useless)

‚Ä¢Faster vaulting

She still dummy thiccc for that rod... I mean hook.

I play controller on PC and I never have issues, though I can't do 360s while playing survivor.
---
Don‚Äôt chargeback they‚Äôll ban your account.
---
I see a man of culture
---
Yeah, he can be quite situational. TBH since I don't play regularly or take the game too seriously I don't mind losing every once in a while if the survivors aren't dicks about it. So I'll probably never hit red ranks unless I really put my all into it with my Hillbilly, but I honestly don't see the point.
---
Even if it were visually gruesome (it is mostly not), the best I've heard its graphics be described is "grim-dark Scooby Doo", and within that... aesthetic, even more gory stuff would not have much of a visceral effect.
---
Is the problem the bad framerate on console? Or the fact that you play with a controller? Or both?
---
&gt;Me:*Runs Kindred*
---
*Killer aura shows facecamping*
---
All 3 other survivors: **MINE MINE MINE MINE**
---
How did you pre registered? Cant find it on Play Store
---
Then we stop using the term ‚Äútunnelling‚Äù is just the killer doing the objective quickly.
---
definitely, they basically became another M1 killer, which i hate it + their add-ons are awful af and the fact that M&amp;A or Distressing don't affect their TR anymore during Frenzy is complete bullshit
---
If tracking boosts seem too much then it can act as a second chase mechanic where you can do a Pig-esque dash. Now what you still need to do is think of 3 teachables, good luck to ya.
---
This is accurate. I‚Äôm r8/9 killer and last night I had a couple bad matches as Hag, that last sprint to 40 for the teachables, and both matches one person actually sent me a message talking shit. 
---
Come on, really? I understand why we get salty messages sometimes, but these were just pure assholes. I feel like r9 is the fence between *tryhard* and *having fun* modes.
---
Tbh, I think prayer beads should be ultra-rare, not having any indication the Spirit is coming is a pretty major buff for her.
---
easy solution, just slug em
---
Idk, what ever she asks for
---
Thanks for filling me in. I don't use Instagram or follow girls, might be why I've never seen it.
---
And all you need to complete the build is Insidious, BBQ&amp;Chili, and Bubba
---
Keep in mind, this is on a phone. Kinda weird though because DBD doesn't really belong on a phone. No one would play it, disconnects would be all too common with incoming calls and what not.
---
This is good
---
Only if the item is shitty tho
---
because multiple killers ruin the code and they'd have to rewrite a lot of it to fix this stuff
---
It's cause of these guys that I went full on toxic gameplay wise
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just better to make sure they see it on their forum instead of just hoping they see it here you know.
---
No. Hes stronger than he was before, and I‚Äôd argue even less fun to play against. He needs a rework.
---
I havent seen any episode, but the demogirgons looks great, I hope they made it as a killer
---
Guys cmon, she is just enjoying herself
---
I don't though!
---
It‚Äôs always either *cunt* or wanka‚Äô
---
Um, did you just counter your own argument? If you think they're unhooking in your face because they run BT, the unhooked person WILL get away since they have BT active. It would make more sense to hit the unhooker, especially if you're something like Billy or Huntress who can secure a down on the unhooker pretty reliably.
---
The effort you have gone to make this post being all upset by shirtless myers makes me curious. What did he do to you to make you like this?
---
That makes freddy Mega OP
---
Dwight: well shouldn‚Äôt you be hiding in a bush letting your friends die
---
It will only fix lag switching.
---
Yes, you will be connecting to the server. But the person that is laggy to you will also be lagging in your game. If the killer is having a bad connection, you will still experience just as many problems as before.
---
I've seen this exact thing happen in For Honor. They switched from p2p to dedicated servers and besides the game no longer ending when host disconnects, nothing changed.
---
It's been fixed with the update that breaks off a match when someone disconnects during loading, so no it really isn't.. 
---
You disconnect/lose internet : offering lost
---
Someone else disconnects:item returned.
---
Console Nurse main here. She is still really tough to play, but she isn't nowhere near as tough as she was around the Legion patch: now the framerate is decent enough to understand what's going on and what you are looking at while blinking.
---
i started playing legion recently and she‚Äôs for sure a weaker killer but idk how they could make her better and less annoying without removing the deep wound effect on frenzy attacks
---
Broke gang wya?
---
Lmao represent!
---
It's TRUE though
---
*shoulder touch*
---
Hey
---
well there was another hooked survivor, he could be buying time for them to get saved (which they did)
---
What rules do u have for survivors?
---
Deliverance / Decisive Strike / Unbreakable is my favorite build for this reason
---
I mean you're not wrong
---
The problem is that on constant after you blink, you can't move your camera and you have to wait like a second so you have to swing blindly hoping the survivor is in that direction
---
I don't know...I've been hit with DS twice back to back before and that killed my momentum hard.  I'd say it's still just as strong as ever if you down the little fuckers too fast.
---
Tapp and Quentin are like super rare pokemons. I had maybe 1 Tapp in my last 10 games, and not a single sleepy boi.
---
DM a staff member.
---
Bruh he looks like he was cut out of a screenshot and put into a a different picture.
---
Most people? Where?
---
It's not toxic but it can fuck you over if you "tunnel" two people to death (at the same time, not one at a time) with a killer that has an instadown.
---
No i dont, it's screen of my friend, no FS or something like it
---
Which killer are you trying out?
---
No tea bagging at pallets or windows don‚Äôt farm survivors do gens no cancerous behaviour such as flashlight clicking to harass the killer don‚Äôt DC on first down don‚Äôt body block other survivors on purpose don‚Äôt sell out other survivors don‚Äôt open the gate too soon and don‚Äôt fuck your team over
---
I know i know it just looks funny
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cajlcl/is_there_a_bug_that_prevents_a_lobby_from_filling/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It‚Äôs bad enough that for a good nurse it will not make that much of a difference. You will get maybe 5 or 6 K. 
---
Only if the Nurse is still learning, if they are using a controller, or if they are doing a no-perk no-addon challenge build will it make any real difference. 
---
Honestly, DCing against Legion was what made the Devs change them. The more people DC and complain about Nurse, the more likely she will get changed.
---
Stealth and walls no, but mind games yes. If you know what you're doing you bait her blink and run back, juke them. You can also just be unpredictable and run behind blind spots to force her to either guess where you are or have to walk in order to get a line of sight to blink.
---
There have been numerous times where I join a game, and everyone sits there for like 10 minutes because there are only 3 survivors in the lobby. You leave, and suddenly you get into a lobby with 4 people, which means there were more people, they just weren't being stuck in your lobby. If someone leaves the "bugged lobby", it almost always fills the third slot instantly, and everyone goes back to waiting. Has this happened to anyone else?
---
That still doesn't work.  It happened to me twice yesterday and both times the killer got the kill. You have to escape through the hatch. üò≠
---
Sure you can. It just takes a full second to turn because the devs think max sensitivity should be like turning the SS Saratoga.
---
Wdym yur happy you got a pip, if yur red tank not sure why you wouldn‚Äôt pop
---
Because when people play SWF they have an advantage because they are more coordinated and usually have good comms. This would usually lead to a more difficult experience for the killer so a group of lower ranked SWF will rank with a higher rank killer to compensate
---
Besides rank really doesn't matter to much. I've seen red rank survivors that are as useless as new starters so just enjoy the game
---
Salt on console is nothing. Try having a chat box at the end of every game.

Its weird this meme is used this way because the pdrson speaking is the one leaning.

Pretty much everything you listed has been reworked or just straight up nerfed. When was the last NOED nerf? ü§î
---
Whatever.
---
Ditto! Been saving my bloodpoints now at a mill to splurge on him straight away!
---
it was ten but with left behind someone did a gen in nine seconds
---
I play with controller on PC too. The only way to make it any way tolerable is to change the binding for the right analog stick in steam to mouse and adjust the sensitivity there. People on consoles can‚Äôt do that. Plus they have to deal with the low frame rate.
---
If nobody cared why would they respond
---
Enduring+spirit fury 
---
Be the bane of pallets as they are destroyed on your almighty forehead!
---
When I first played the game I thought this too. It was only after I looked on Reddit that apparently it was the other way around.
---
Ah nice, now I know
---
Nobody cares about you intentionally being a dickhead but Jane's thickness is a very serious matter.
---
There's nothing wrong with being an optimal survivor. That just means you're doing the best you can to accomplish your objective. The issue many killers have is that it is possible for the survivors to be so optimal in the first place. It's possible for 3 generators to pop within the first 90 seconds of a match. There are certain loops in the game that a killer cannot use mind games at and therefore just has to chase until the survivor messes up or bloodlust enables a hit. These are balancing issues where the devs are at fault. I really appreciate the devs in this game most of the time, but they clearly don't balance the game well enough for red rank players. If you come up against truly optimal survivors that don't make mistakes, without using Nurse/Spirit or a mori you're not pipping and can only aim for a black pip.
---
That combo does nothing more for him than anyone else. Better off using Iridescent Button. 
---
Legion's not the worst Killer, Sloppy Butcher let's him slow the game down, but he lacks map pressure and lethality.
---
it's only serious if you think that fake women are important
---
One Hit Huntress or Silent Wraith (No bell sound or heartbeat after uncloaking)
---
I wouldn't worry about deranking, you will continue to improve over time without forcing it. The better the players you play against the better you will be anyway! 
---
I love spirit btw so excellent choice!
---
Thanks mate and I will try my best to improve &lt;3
---
Oh man you're doing the thing again.
---
you can not install the pack?
---
If this isn‚Äôt true I don‚Äôt know what is
---
I had someone dc because of that exact situation yesterday.
---
Good times.
---
I doesn't always help, but generally Survivors will trust you and usually follow your 'come here' gesture if they see you make it in my experience.
---
With Bond I can find them and then guide them to a generator. As long as I stay on it with them, they're usually willing to stay on it too. 
---
Even Baby Dweets and Megs who only have Sprint Burst 2 will usually power through both the Terror Radius and making mistakes on the generator as long as Nea or Quentin is there to point determinedly at the gen.
---
I‚Äôll have to try that :)
---
As killer: smack, grab, hook
---
Someone has to do it
---
only a monster would use pink hair
---
A good hillbilly that is
---
Pretty much this,  I do "decent" with nurse while I'm still learning her. But by the end of the match when pressures up and I start making more errors I get more frustrated and make even more errors
---
You guys need to stop screaming SWF every time you see a bad matchmaking. The algorithm is fucked up. I‚Äôm against R13 when I‚Äôm R3 and I‚Äôm solo survivor.
---
There is a mobile game?
---
I didn't call for a nerf to: Michael, Nurse, Spirit, GF, or any other viable killer. I play killer as well as survivor. My complaint was with Billy. Also, I *want* Bubba to be buffed. I feel like Bubba and Billy should both have good map pressure and effect use from their chainsaw I'm different ways. I just find it ridiculous that Billy can charge across the map, see me, and then run up and one tap me like a M1 killer on steroids.
---
I'd swap out SF and Enduring for Monitor and Abuse and another stalling perk of your choice (PGTW perhaps?) M&amp;A will help you get first hits or free downs if they don't cleanse, usually without needing to brute force through pallets with SF.
---
Plague is pretty underrated tbh, just requires a different approach.
---
He‚Äôs underrated.
---
I learned the hard way that tunneling is frowned upon ... so instead of tunneling one person I now give everyone a fair chance and tunnel everyone equally :)
---
What you did is against terms of service. Lying about your country of resident *could* be considered fraud, but Sony would never pursue it. Also Sony doesn't permit the sharing of games between accounts. You're lucky you didn't get suspended.
---
Best bet is to buy the game on your main account.
---
Yeah, they just need dedicated servers so its easier to know why someone dc'd, then there will be a time penalty for leaving a match earlier and looking for another one
---
Thanks guys :)

Huh? Uhm ü§î I didnt lie. I only made an usa psn account because my best friend from the usa introduced me to this game.

I even just got my money back that I spend for cells that I still didnt receive. They didnt even say anything they tried to help me more than anything tbh. üòä

Be stupid...  I'm on console.  The only way I survive high rank Nurses is by going completely retarded.
---
If she's on her way or chasing me...  I'm literally just moving the stick around and hardly paying attention to what I'm doing.
---
If I try to be intuitive or clever in the chase...  I'm downed in about ten seconds.
---
When I'm just running and moving with no plan what-so-ever, she never lands a blink hit.  I'll end up going down on basic attacks only.
---
It's not just Freddy it's also the survivor who unhooks right in front of me even though im a tier 3 Michael
---
Rabid Identity V Stan defending game goes here
---
Delicious
---
Will it be avaliable in Poland?
---
The last time this happened to me I ran around the outside the edge all the way to the other gate and then ran through and I was back in the map.
---
I‚Äôm one of the few that enjoying old Freddy, it‚Äôll be sad to see it gone forever.
---
Leatherface is the worst by a long shot. He has no way of applying pressure and his power is nonexistent at higher ranks. It only works on open spaces and even if you find a survivor out in the open, they can do a close turn on a tree and completely counter his chainsaw. Freddy can stall the game and win eventually, but he's much harder to play
---
Now that‚Äôs a black mans ass, delicious.
---
I shall try this
---
why not highlight bond üòî
---
Michael looking pretty sexy
---
it can be pretty good if everyone hits the skill checks
---
I placed my bestfriend her adress. So????
---
But they mentioned this issue on the stream? I would assume the other 3 were SWF then. Like everything it's going to have moments were it isnt perfect just stick with it :)
---
THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK
---
same
---
There are dozens of us!
---
To be honest I would rather play against a 5 blink nurse than a prayer beads spirit. Prayer beads literally makes it an rng guessing game with no form of counterplay on the survivors end.
---
I don't play killer but I'm just curious, why would you not phase back to the hook after you get notified that there has been an unhook? That means that at least 2 out of 4 survivors are in that general area so wouldn't it be smart to go back over there?
---
Hahahaha, my friend recently got me into this game. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt play it because it‚Äôs scary. I‚Äôm someone who doesn‚Äôt watch scary movies &amp; if I do I can call out the jump scares and still get spooked by them ... but here I am now dropping pallets on Michael Myers face
---
Discordance. o.√¥
---
I personaly prefer empathy. It's map wide, you won't find every survivor with it but you can track the killers chase and can find people to heal so they don't waste time self caring. Bond is just a bit too short in range for my taste.
---
bye sisters
---
Gotta get them bloodpoints lol
---
It's possible that he just wanted to make you waste some time at the exit gate to let someone save the survivor hooked. Then when the survivor got saved he tried to do noise with the window to distract you but he didn't notice that you was coming back and he fucked up with the timing. Maybe not everything a survivor does is BM...
---
i think that the tier lists between console and pc (hell, maybe even mobile) don't change. Nurse is painful to play in console but she's still as destructive as she is in pc
---
He was unique and fun to play as, the new Freddy, though visually cool, is just a clown, hag hybrid.
---
It‚Äôs okay to go for kills , just eliminate players as needed. Otherwise let them get their rescue points and such ... it‚Äôll let you get points for throwing them back up aswell... also if you face camp you don‚Äôt get the opportunity of other survivors coming out of the woodworks for you to chase... they‚Äôll just go pop gens and escape bc you‚Äôre being toxic
---
genrush is a lie
---
It happens fairly often. I especially love it when they get off a toxic full med kit off right in front of me.  Meanwhile someone is unhooking the 3rd survivor. DH kicks in and they‚Äôre upset they just wasted an insta heal. So they DC.
---
"i hate noed"
---
then cleanse totems...?
---
"no i don't want to"
---
Bugs are the most terrifying part of dead by daylight.
---
Dat ass
---
Alright this was funny. 8 out of 9 stars for you sir.
---
reminds me of "As a Sniper, Press MOUSE2 to zoom in with your sniper rifle"
---
Stereotypes exist for a reason and claudette ones are so damn true
---
Not entirely true, this all depends on the architecture used for the servers. If the killer's location is determined or verified by the server, then the survivors will not experience any lag if the killer is lagging. The killer will simply not move.
---
For registering hits the server can also be used. If the server is used for verifying hits then this will ensure that all hits are determined fairly.
---
If you play with 300ms and complain about playing huntress on P2P you should think about the survivors, getting hit by something that never should've hit.
---
I one had a guy send me something along the lines of "gg but I looped you around like 5 pallets lol" after I killed him. I'm still not entirely sure what he was trying to get at.
---
I remember i was playing on mobile and It said facing the Nurse, and I was getting so excited to see how bad she was in mobile but she ended up dcing so the match never started :(
---
You could run this build with any killer! I just prefer doctor because it‚Äôs easier to get points with him. Shocking people itself is good points but then you get to know where everyone is which allows you to pick and choose your chases. Sometimes I let survivors drop pallets on me just so I can break them lul .
---
neither perks are crutches also do you even know what does incel mean
---
Except it could just as easily be phrased as "Adrenaline is a perk that rewards survivors for rushing generators at the expense of everything else, NOED is a perk that punishes survivors for rushing gens instead of cleansing totems". Not to mention if reward for failure is inherently bad wouldn't everyone hate new DS more than old DS? And wouldn't ruin be the least controversial perk because all it does is punish the survivors failures?
---
r/atleastyoutried
---
&gt;why not highlight bond üòî
---
Bond in my case leads to more harm than good. All it reveals me are survivors hiding behind rocks rather than working on gens while I am looping the killer and this is rage inducing. 
---
If your team is decent, you should always find them near generators so Bond is not actually useful, same for Empathy. Most cases you can just use your eyes anyway.
---
I had someone invite me to a party when I slaughtered their toxic SWF.  He proceeded to call me a bastard and threatened to rape my entire family.  I‚Äôm only in green ranks. I‚Äôm honestly scared for my family for if I ever hit red ranks üòÇ
---
r/lostredditors ?
---
Clauds are only toxic cuz you cant see that crispy bitch evwn if she 4 foot infront of you t-bagging.
---
Nah, just wanted to check something. I'm tryna take it down
---
No. All killer lunges are identical except for Myers in EW1 and 3.
---
That's some ultra instinct shit right here...
---
What? Console is getting Bill Overbeck, best mid chapter ever...
---
Shhhh. I‚Äôm actually wining as killer for once ü§´
---
Yes. Reduce fatigue time back to 3 seconds. Make it possible to trigger Feral Frenzy at-will again, without having to wait for the power bar to fully recharge. Rework some of the add-ons that are now more or less useless (detection range, Pins, Study, Frank's).
---
They broke their streaks, I broke their legs.
---
This is the kind of shitpost we need.
---
But not deserve :(
---
Exhaustion perks are a problem, but this is too much.
---
Simply increasing Exhaustion time from 60/50/40s to 80/70/60s would be enough for most perks.
---
That said, Adrenaline should work as follows;
---
In light of the Freddy Rework, it can still wake you up. But since BHVR based this on how Adrenaline works irl, the perk shouldn't give you Wolverine's healing factor. In reality, Adrenaline doesn't heal you, you just become numb to the pain.
---
As such, it still heals you 1 health state... for 40(?) seconds. After that, if you haven't healed or are currently healing, you go back to how you were. That said, it still removes Deep Wound for coding reasons.
---
Salt on pc is knee jerk, and more trollish (such as GG EZ). Salt on console is more intense and ranges from why you‚Äôre a bitch to your whole family being genocided. Think about it. You get out of the game, and then go out of your way to add them and type a paragraph with a controller. That‚Äôs dedication.
---
Tunneling may not be fun for survivor targeted but it is quite legit and preferable tactic for killer..., if you take 1-2 survivors out of equation as quickly as possible you reduce pressure and make it far easier to control and farm rest of them. 
---
Not to mention that they are far less inclined to rush for a save and to make mistake on first hook, knowing your buddy is on second hook spamming SPACE and nagging you on VOIP to save him makes you do stupid Shi* that I can exploit...
---
Same goes for Tbaging and or flashlight clicking if you can derail someone to chase you half of the match while generators are getting poped left and right even if you die.., you won..., just like me if I can do same by hooking guy up and making you rush that hook instead of fixing generators I won..., is it fair? Nope, but I am here to kill you with machete not kindness...
---
Did you forget all about  the thicc jane memes?
---
I would also say there is a decent chance of not getting a crossover. Behavior has made mobile games and Stranger Things already has 1 hit mobile game so I wouldn't be surprised if it's something like that also.
---
The difference between red rank survivors and purple and above is fucking insane. I have 900 hours (about even killer/survivor) and I've been playing with a new friend (from her 50 hours to 250) and it was just painful, survivors walking away from gens as soon as they hear the heartbeat or insta-lockering.
---
Like, I want to write a guidebook to every new survivor to read to help them when they start.
---
1) don't try to escape the hook in 90% of scenarios.
---
2) just because you heard the heartbeat, doesn't mean you Sprint Burst away from the generator.
---
That's why his every message is being disliked I guess
---
Tasty
---
I feel like it should be like sole survivor but for gen progression. I'm not sure what the values would change to though.
---
Ah okay
---
Meh
---
It's against terms of service, all I'm saying. Be careful, because you can get banned for it.
---
Okay, real question though, why'd they nerf empathy?
---
Turn your steam to online if its offline currently.
---
Hmm ok. üòñ They didnt say that on the phone or anything. But thanks anyway!
---
Love it!
---
You're God damn right. Mine. Gimme, gimme. Lol
---
That's how it is on Console, PC version is alot more fun.
---
cause bond wasnt already getting picked enough over the perk lol. bhvr sure acts weirdly
---
On console i play her with the yellow range and yellow speed add on
---
I know but heres hoping!
---
It sucks conpared to the previously crazy broken version. The new version is still great, i donno what you're talking about
---
You lose ranking points if any injuries are healed, so the system itself kinda promotes tunneling.
---
Which comes with starting on console. So for us console players she is easier than a pc player going to console to try her out
---
They sure do
---
I dont why this misinfo keeps getting spread. The penalty for having more then 1 person on a gen is irrelevant. The coop BP bonus more than makes up for it, and you'll waste more time running to different gen then just hopping on the one with someone else near by. 
---
The multiple survivor penalty is just there to prevent co-op'ing gen from being crazy OP. Unless Ruin is active theres no reason NOT to co-op.
---
More like I'm enjoying myself lookin at that wagon while she's on the hook
---
No. I'm not gonna play with a controller , fuck no I have been a dbd player on console where I used to play nurse. It was frustrating af. Then I bought a PC and it was a completely different story with the nurse.
---
Rank reset is the 13th of every month and rank gives dumb cue times and more difficult games
---
It's in a beta state.
---
I'm running overcharge and deer stalker on gf atm kinda just down everyone then hook em one by one matches are pretty short so I might have to change it up to get more points
---
Deer stalker is good if you down them and move on ... overcharge is a little useless
---
What's ur main build on the spirit?
---
I got adept Bubba when just playing normally with only 3 perk slots open. I tried to get Hag for 3 days, finally got so upset that I just prestiged her and lost 10 gruesome gateaus.
---
Can't wait for the DC punishment. If you don't know, read up on it. Comes with the dedicated server update. The more you DC, the longer you are "banned" from the game. Fuck those people. Finally getting rid of DCers.
---
My tip would be to always use Vile Purge and to keep track of your surroundings; your perks look good to me.
---
I personally stack Vile Purge effectiveness add-ons on her and just Puke at everyone. Once they're Broken it makes stealth impossible and ensures every chase is a one hit down. 
---
The reason I stack effectiveness add-ons is because the sooner I get everyone Broken the better. If they cleanse for some reason I also need to be able to quickly Break them again.
---
Of course the biggest part of playing any Killer is situational awareness and pressuring Survivors. Knowing when to guard a gen or hook and knowing when to go and commit to a chase.
---
Nea looks worse in-game, I think this is pretty good cause of that.
---
Would you rather play on 150 ping or 100?
---
It provides very little bang for your buck - it's crazy expensive and only does 25% of the gen in exchange for quite a few *very difficult* skillchecks. You're better off running a Yellow/Green Toolbox with extra charges and repair speed/efficiency
---
too many schoolboys
---
Question: How the fuck do they not see the fucking knee sticking out and the fricking tip of the rifle just over the wall???
---
I think I'm a good Hillbilly, but Decisive Strike fucks with me something fierce. I don't camp, but I would probably take the bait and try to punish an early Deliverance, and then get hit by DS.
---
The same girl also trolled a lot of guys by saying that she was gonna upload videos of herself on pornhub and then it turned out she uploaded a bunch of videos there that had nothing to do with porn.
---
3 iridescent and 1 gold, so basically keep 5 gens undone for like 6-9 minutes, hook people 9+ times and get the 4k.
---
You also get negative points when survivors heal eachother in one of the categories and for staying near a hooked person in another category.
---
Sloppy butcher BBQ nurses calling and ruin
---
I think it's actually pretty good  only thing I had a little giggle at is nea looks happy to see Ghostface instead of scared aha
---
Yeah I'm not sure why it's in there I just needed a 4th perk lol I need points bad
---
You're wrong. I am eastern european player and I'm playing on console. Thus, he have to deal with ME.
---
Oh I'm quite aware of it. I'm not a fan of people who DC in most cases. It just punishes everyone. Your teammates and the killer get punished cause someones being selfish. It's why I never DC even if im facing a "no fun allowed" killer or a gen rushing swf. I just let the game end and move on to the next.
---
No, it's ramen
---
I just got Ruin on my Ghostface, took me about 50 blood webs
---
Her FOV is terrible when crouching, it;s actually lower than it should be regarding the posiiton of her head ;) Her posture should be lowered to adjust the FOV or her FOV should be adjusted to her posture
---
I've tried to make her look freaked out but it didn't work :'D
---
Except the drawback means that they literally never get to use the benefit. What kind of killer slugs a survivor with no mither?
---
He is terribly bad dude...
---
Bowel movement. ‚ÄúBM‚Äù as a gaming term generally refers to when someone does something to intentionally pissing off an opponent, such as teabagging.
---
Gonna be nerfed tho, I know this is a joke. But he will no longer be able to see their auras.
---
.............‚ù§ i never loved anything more
---
I disagree. The skill checks really arent hard, and even if you miss them you still get *some* value. 
---
The problem with survivor bloodwebs is that literally half the nodes are completely worthless; Luck offerings, all the non-battery FL add ons, almost every key add on, most of the map add ons, the skill check toolbox add one, etc. 
---
There are two catagories when it comes to buying stuff out of the bloodweb 1) stuff that has some value, anything &gt; 0, and 2) literally worthless filler. 
---
BNP absolutely has value, and it has an impact on the outcome of a match. Yes 7k is expensive, but 7k for something of value is better then spending 3-6k on something actually worthless.
---
Are you joking? He does make noise. Admittedly, it's not as loud as the game, but he does make noises while hurt, or over exerting himself.
---
Besides, there needs to be a stun sound to show that the killer has been stunned.
---
Lol, just use spine chill noob
---
These should be those modded textures or whatever for the perks but with the killer portraits in the menu! :))
---
It can feel like camping. That being said, as a killer main that hates camping, its on survivors to give you something to chase. I'm going to go where I know survivors are. Like you said, if there's an unhook, that means at least two survivors are there. Don't be the killer that leaves chase to go back, cause that's kinda douchey, but if survivors aren't giving me anything to look for, I'm going back.
---
Ok well he BARELY makes noises. I wish his stun sound was different. He sounds silly as hell
---
"Yeah, she's the entity"
---
Also I don't recall him making noises in Halloween 2018? I haven't seen it in a while but was he actually vocal in that one. (Halloween 2018 was awesome btw.)
---
Half the killer addons you roll are shit too, though, for every killer.
---
I don't really see it, honestly.
---
Ahh ok, thanks. I thought bowel movement originally but thought it was more game related than that.
---
It's not funny, it's sexy &gt;:C
---
Always amazes me how shit the devs are at balance
---
Cool drawing, I love it!
---
That‚Äôs my main! Gold Star! Tell her to keep it up! Definitely not a shit post!
---
Naw.
---
Wish they'd add statistics and stuff like that
---
i think Head on needs adjustment not because it's OP or trash but it should get some QoL changes. little things like showing the 3s time to "charge" the perk or no collision while the killer is stunned. i love the perk but hate that i can use it like once every 3 games just to get stuck on the killer (actual use not just random stunning the killer for fun)
---
The trick is to stop using bs killers like Myers in the first place
---
Yeaaah, it's kinda quiet but he makes pain noises. Took me a few rewatches to notice.
---
https://youtu.be/IMyeIiVPfLY
---
Around 1:12 and 1:59
---
Yeah, 2018 was definitely one of my favourite Halloween films. I'm excited for the 2020 sequel.
---
Being accused of wallhacking when playing scratched mirror Myers. Myeeees.
---
Is this actually a cereal when haves milk parody?
---
You are correct, im sure what your point is tho. 
---
All the bloodwebs need a pass from the devs. The grind in this game is bad enough without having to dump tons of BP into *literally* useless garbage.
---
Let us burn unwanted items/offerings for a small amount of shards or just eliminate all the useless crap and replace it with useful brown and yellows. The world wont end if survivors are bringing yellow flashlights and brown toolboxes every game.
---
Hmm, I must be lucky. In over 2 years i've gotten less then 10 people (give or take) that sent me rage
---
It‚Äôs called Kindred.

Same. Even if I pull a monto move I don‚Äôt get flack

Left Behind with 5 gens + mori'd prove thyself took slightly over 9s.
---
Afterwards they did a 4 man gen in slightly under 9s
---
All the time or only at certain times of the day?
---
They do
---
Oh dear God
---
Uh yeah that‚Äôs not on the Wiki, the only thing close is his MS while he‚Äôs actually using the saw which is 230% or 9.2MS which looks like what you decided to use in your ‚Äú92%‚Äù. If survivors were 8% faster than skillbilly he wouldn‚Äôt be able to ride their backs while he revs. The meme might have said it in a confusing way, but he runs at 4MS or 100% the survivor running speed while revving. 
---
~QuiteYaFuckinLyin‚Äô
---
the thing is, if there's 3 survivors doing 3 different gens, the killer can only stop one at a time. you should work on gens seperately, not just because it's slightly more time efficient but also because it applies pressure to the killer at different points of the map. a lot of killers can't keep up with that sort of map pressure.
---
Not a bad idea to have two perks that reward failure. At least things would be clear. If not I fear that one day someone will say that they use NOED to counter Deja Vu.
---
Thank you guys :)  it took me like 5-6 hours and I'm really happy with it :)

---
It's funny, because it's so true
---
Fair point
---
What i mean is, I'd find a few gens around it and go from gen, gen, gen, hook. Unless I'm playing someone like the hag in which case, it's a lot cheesier than that. I try not to be unfair but I'm not just gonna let them win
---
What's BNP?
---
Ruin punishes survivor mistakes. A series of mistakes can turn into total failure to escape.
---
NOED activates because the killer already made that series of mistakes and he/she is rewarded for failure. 
---
Anyway NOED probably needs a rework now that MoM and DS are no more.
---
Dont let them pull you down. DbDs community has bright sides too and that bright side makes it worth giving another chance
---
Lol yeah that was my buddy ü§£
---
Doesn't it automatically end the game if someone DCs before the game starts? I'm pretty sure that was added a coupple of patches ago
---
Oh that's interesting to know. Thanks for your reply! :)
---
Brand New Part.
---
First they were OP, then they were basically fine, but like any remotely good thing survivors have, killers want it ruined so they kept complaining and now it's less then worthless
---
Not too long ago I was playing doctor and ended up in the game map. Survivors definitely didn't do too great, but they were super nice in the end game chat. They thanked me for the fun game and wished me luck.

Maybe she doesnt create an account because she doesnt want to waste her nerves on people like you

Lol. I doubt it you actually getting a refund considering they are allowed to change things.

He's bad, the entire community thinks it. How I'm the world is playing a 40 minute game fun for either side? Because thats all Freddy did. Was slow games down.
---
And maybe, you sgouks wait to play it before whining like a baby yes?
---
I always enjoyed facing him, when you skill checked in his face, always fun haha,
---
Enjoyed this haha
---
Decisive isnt shown in this meme because its toxic, it's shown because it's another ''if i fuck up horribly'' perk, same with the syringe. It gives you a second chance, it's in this meme to tell you ''This Dwight had more chances than usual and still barely made it, but that didn't prevent him from saying 'easy'''.
---
Once i was in a game as Ghostface. This one Feng Min kept unhooking everyone in front of me. I tunneled and t-bagged with the other 3 survivors as she died. The other 3 survivors and I then proceeded to farm and i let them all escape.
---
How do know he's trash, did you play it?
---
Freddy was not fun. Also BHVR can change if they want to, it's part of the terms of device. All games are allowed to
---
Had a trapper game yesterday where Nea was running through traps like nothing. Looks like similar bug to when survivor can‚Äôt escape through exit gates and just runs through.
---
How do you know he will be bad if you haven't even plates it yet. At least wait until it comes out
---
as a quentin main who messages killers saying gg and applauding good plays, thank u.
---
Always loved seeing someone that's asleep hiding in a locker lol
---
Adept wraith is the one I just can‚Äôt manage to get. He‚Äôs a super simple killer to play but I‚Äôm finding it so hard to get merciless with his 3 perks.
---
What? Adrenaline activates immediately as the last gen is popped. It‚Äôs impossible to be hit by NOED before adrenaline activates and then be saved by adrenaline
---
And just because OP didn‚Äôt include it doesn‚Äôt mean NOED shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed too.
---
NOT THE MELEE HATCHET
---
Sorry to tell you this way my friend, but some Dwights are corrupted...
---

If you want to train I‚Äôll be up for some kyf I‚Äôm a rank 3 spirit main :/

There's a loading screen tip that says the Wraith is very unhappy when he gets lightburned, and it's that kind of charm that makes me wish there were more tips like that.

Gave me a good chuckle
---
\*drops all the pallets\*
---
"Who killed the pallets?"
---
Lmao did you seriously compare a perk which avtivates after you do 5 gens with a perk that activates after you lose 5 gens?
---
Mobile games aren‚Äôt good, not sure why people are surprised
---
r/sbubby
---
Its not high risk at all, it gives you a 1 hit down for playing poorly. A terrible killer may have gone the entire match without getting someone and could end up getting a 2-3k because of noed.
---
LOL üòÇ I got scared too!!
---
Sticking on the gen is boring as fuck. If they increased the time, more people will feel survivor is grating.
---
And as a killer your only true enemy is map rng or bad map design. Being a good killer means being oppressive to everyone. If you're letting people complete important gens uninterupted you're not doing it right.
---
I know the feeling of not wanting to leave people behind but sometimes you have to, his playstyle was rewarded with two kills.
---
Just as one could say survivors objective is escape and killers is to kill one would say both those perks help with the objective. Killers can get those final last kills and survivors get the boosts they need to escape.
---
Or i could go devils advocate and say adrenaline promotes poor play by being a free health state and all that other goodness by not doing any gens or good looping all game. While noed is planning and going to punish survivors when it gets to end game by knowing the killer wont have great early or mid game potential. NOED is such a stong perk that survivors fear the chance of it being run. So it always gives a benefit to you. Every dull totem you see cleansed and you dont run noed just know you wasted at least 16ish seconds of their time
---
I was using spirit first time this happened to me. I pulled like 2 or 3 people off gens that game and got 4k
---
For adrenaline use Noed, for gen rushing use perks and just stop camping and start to apply some map pressure, for borrowed again stop camping, for ds again the previous one, for infinites use bamboozle, for flashlight watch walls and use lightborn, insta-heal is a red add-on and like every red add-on is supposed to be a really powerfull thing(btw Franklin's demise is still a way to counter), for pallets use spirit fury, brutal strength, enduring, ecc. MoM got nerfed so not a problem anymore. T-bag it's just a survivor pressing spamming a key, it's annoying but doesn't really change a game if you just keep your calm and use your brain. Just adapt your build based on your play style and on what you see in the lobby. Almost eveything has a counter if you want but obviously you can't counter everything in the game simultaneously. 
---
Ps: I play both side (red rank killer and survivor).
---
It fucking sucks. It saves what, 8 seconds, 10% of a gen?
---
That's ridiculous for an Ultra Rare and everyone agrees, except for the kind of killer main who thinks every survivor should spawn on hooks
---

More like a moving van going through a rural area
---
Looks nice man I could never draw anythin close so its good to me
---
True the other 2 did escape I think I dies with one gen left so probably
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
If there's two people on one gen, the Killer either loses all momentum guarding said gen, or has to chase ONE of the Survivors. Then the other Survivor can finish the gen.
---
cool thanks.
---
This is why I only let someone have the hatch if they don't struggle. If they start struggling, I will drop them and shake my head no. If they struggle again after I pick them up I will hook them. If they don't struggle they can escape. It happened too many times that I would let people live and that I get messages that I suck as a killer etc.
---
That's the main problem with this game. Everything is balanced around optimal play/good players when almost no one plays optimally or is even good.
---
Something HAS to be done man
---
Wasn't BHVR, valve's licensed bill only for PC. Since console wasn't part of the deal he couldn't be added
---
They are working on him for almost 1 year, it cant be that bad.
---
iirc he‚Äôs actually protecting the kids going to school, search up ‚Äúthe troubles‚Äù in Ireland
---
Play how you want man, but your not learning anything from camping lmao. But like I said, if your intention is to not really become a better killer and just camp, you will only get so far
---
Too bad it can get destroyed in 30 seconds leaving killers with only 3 perks. Then the people also run NOED so they play the majority with only 2 perks and wonder why they lost
---
Hmmmmm, I don't whether to trust this or not so I'll just consider it.
---
the crossover we're all waiting for
---
At low ranks deliverance hard carries games if you're the only good survivor in a team of idiots
---
And my axe!
---
It sounds op and you‚Äôre denying survivors a optional objective for boldness/pip points. Survivors would have to be reimbursed somehow for the destruction?
---
It's a reference
---
And this is pretty much why I don‚Äôt play DbD anymore.
---
The day they remove end game chat, I might come back
---
(Incoming salt) three dead and you managing to crawl out is not an easy win.
---
It's important to remember moments like that for when you think maybe you should just let the last survivor get the hatch; no mercy, spare the rod and spoil the child.
---
I think you are completely wrong.
---
The game is balanced around lower rank survivors and that's why a lot of killers feel cheated, because if the game works for low rank survivors, how the fuck can they beat high rank survivors.
---
Of course, shit happens and the game balance rotates but I have always found survivor to be resident sleeper because it's often way too easy, even at higher ranks.
---
What‚Äôs Deliverance got to do with anything? Nobody cares about that perk because it‚Äôs so situational it‚Äôs barely used. You also have to earn Adrenaline but you still complain about that as if it‚Äôs an op perk.
---
So use 1 perk in the hopes of countering 2/3 out of 16 killers?
---
'Kay
---
Never had this but I imagine a scenario like:
---
Surv:Hahah trash killer I double pip‚Äôd anyway thanks
---
Killer:No, no you didn‚Äôt, it says right there.
---
I sat literally 5 minutes in front of this post until I realized you meant ‚Äûloop‚Äú
---
damn right if it pisses people off I'm gonna abuse it
---
I can't think of anything that's benefited low ranks though
---
High risk? Im sorry but are you insane? Noed activates 99% of the time (from my very oen experience) and when the survivors do 5 totems they waste more time than on ruin. What else do you want? Its a win/win perk and clearly unbalanced and everything BUT NOT high risk....
---
Yup, you're absolutely right. I'm a Nurse main too on console.
---
what's the point of bringing SC and medkits as well??
---
Thats adorableüòç
---
Myers' perks are a strange one. STBFL is amazing, Dying Light is meh, and PWYF is trash. The reason I find them strange is that they actively go against each other.
---
Play between rank 7-15 as survivor if you don't believe me
---
I think cannibals could be a challenge since he doesn't get that speed boost like Billy
---
The rest are very minor buffs that would not change the meta even a tiny bit but only make survivors a bit weaker.
---
Why should adrenaline be nerfed? Most of the time its not even useful because youre not in a chase or died before the 5 gens finish meanwhile the killers have noed..... speed boost and one hit for failing your objective.... meanwhile adrenaline rewards doing the objevtive....
---
Running 5 seconds faster with one health state more after doing the gens for around 10-20 minutes is not unbalanced
---
A high risk perk like adrenaline should also be good. Why should a perk that activates after DOING 5 GENS be weak?
---
Not that i would give you shit for setting a challenge for yourself but I wouldn't personally feel like I had to limit myself just for the survivor's sake. I'd just play the killer i enjoy most, which is Ghost Face right now. He's still really good but i also like to play against him because there is clear and distinct counter play.
---
He still has a bigger ass than 90% of the females in the game lmao
---
That is so true ,I put not much time in dbd and am not really good ,but I am not crying when I loose and give others the fault
---
Usually Huntress. IMO she's somewhat of a low skill floor/high skill ceiling killer due to her reliance on aim and positioning, so she feels fun to me on all levels because of that.
---
Other than just killers on their own, Speed Limiter Bubba is a super fun/challenging build. Sometimes you'll get survivors that stop moving cause they think they're down already, but instead you get a double saw and down them anyway.
---
That's an issue the devs have to fix. But as I said, it'd be broken otherwise. Besides, the devs designed it to be a challenging perk, not an easy perk to use with an extremely powerful ability.
---
I... I love it
---
You forget Billy doesn‚Äôt actually move as fast when revving and can‚Äôt get multiple people, and leatherface can get multiple people, hits, and he speeds up when chainsawing too. Keep going off though I guess.
---
that feeling when they call you a hacker when you're just using bitter murmur and they won't take 10 steps away from the gen
---
I still want  to whack myself into a wall if in endgame both the savior and the hooked guy have perks to get away
---
What‚Äôs a blood hunt?
---
They had to drop Freddy rework for a while because Legion needed it urgently considering the amount if dissatisfaction it was creating...
---
Awesome cosplay
---
They are better than before but they are still bad \^\_\^ I don;t think they are less fun now
---
Because this is probably their first match ever. They probably don't know yet how the game works.
---
I can't wait to read all the whiny cries of serial DC'ers crying that the penalties are too stiff.
---
Someone finally talking sense.
---
So what your saying is buff letherface? See I think they should add insidious into his kit that way he won't need to bring the perk. This will give him more room for noed and make it so that he can get 2 kills instead of one.
---
Welcome to dead by daylight!
---
NO I'M DIRTY DAN!
---
But sometimes, they aren't baby Dweets. :c  They are just pretending. :c  And then they BM all over the map and t-bag the killer to shit after you pull them off the hook, and all you can do is offer your sympathies to the killer in post-game chat.
---
"Mobile games aren't good"
---
Identity V: Am I a joke to you?
---
So? Facing a wall is not a perk, wait for dead hard is not a perk and not camping is not a perk, and apply map pressure is not too. There are things that you counter with perks and add-ons and things that you counter with brain.
---
Lol could be worse you could lose the ability to run I'm not allowed to run as survivor because everytime I'm in a chase it pushes me back like obi wan is using force powers does it as killer aswell in a chase its the strangest thing and everybody I ask about has no idea what I'm on about
---
Is Apex still popular? I barely ever hear anything about it these days.
---
Yeah they'll wait until last second just to do it. I see it all the time well I solo survive and when I play killer. I see it a lot when I play freddy especially
---
Only a week after making it too &gt;:(
---
Not a Console player, so I wasn't sure, yeah.  Either way, good news. :)
---
This is more of a problem on console and this happens a lot at night. They just match you with a game that may or may not be even they just want you to get into a game
---
I mean it gives you more reaction time against most Killers. It‚Äôs **really** effective against: Spirit, Myers (T2 onwards), GhostFace, Wraith, Hag. Essentially anyone with the element of surprise or often use M&amp;A. 
---
Hell, it even can be used to get into cover versus hatchets or avoid an angry Billy chainsaw up the rear. 
---
It‚Äôs so solid that i‚Äôve been running it in most of my builds. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yep, truly amazing
---
To add to this, characters that already have his perks will keep them, but prestige‚Äôd characters and brand new characters will NOT see his perks until you have levelled Bill up to get his teachables
---
For instance you have a level 50 Tapp with borrowed time, if you reset Tapp to prestige one AFTER Bills release Tapp will not see borrowed time again until you have unlocked the teachable.
---
Yikes. Imagine trying to have all this coordination without a swf group.
---
That was back to the PS3 due to the complicated CPU (Cell) to program on. This hatred is long gone. Even if Valve doesn‚Äôt!hate PlayStation brand anymore, we all know that the staff doesn‚Äôt care about consoles in general: it releases games on them, then it doesn‚Äôt support them in the long term, ultimately letting them taking the dust unlike on Steam.
---
It's the survivor perk that killers complain about the most, so really it's the NOED of survivors. The nerf will make it seem a little less of a 'crutch' and still functions as normal if not exhausted.
---
Literally how they play lul
---
That's my girl cake day! :)
---
Eh I don't like perks that require luck to function well, since my luck sucks
---
"I led the killer on a 40 second chase I'm such a good player maybe I should start a twitch channel to stream my skillz"
---
How dare the survivors do the objective!

---
yep, it would be the #1 choice. a post i made before about it follows:
---
Alien Xenomorph (self.deadbydaylight) submitted just now by Anna_MoIIy
---
since they like using horror movie characters but every killer in the game is the same humanoid shape, xenomorph would be a good choice. it could be called the parasite (or the d!ckhead), and there are tons of ideas for what it does, even if almost everything has been done by other killers before in some form. it could have an acid spit, walk on all fours, have facehugger eggs around the map that some gameplay element can cause to open up, the facehuggers themselves either just act like the pig's helmets but where another survivor must pull it off of you, or are actual AI enemies that scurry around. the most ambitious concept would likely be that just 1 survivor could burst a chestburster that is either an AI enemy, or the killer can switch to it, to be a very very fast and short attacker, or it quick-grows into a much superior version of the alien, which you switch to, where it's much faster, always downs in one hit, has acid spit, etc. so it's like a new idea in which if you can get rid of one survivor in a special way, you become a super-killer for the rest of the match. and ripley would be the survivor in the chapter
---
And, there's a big difference to "Yeah, I did a gen" and "Our 4 brand new parts, prove thyself and all toolbox strategy is working like we planned"
---
Ok im not saying noed is op because it really isnt but noed is litterally a free second chance. Like if all the gens get done you basically get a second chance to win
---
Yeah, still going strong.  Most of the people i know are still playing.
---
It's not complaining or anything like that, but on the flip side, isn't the killer supposed to get a 4k? Which would mean camping and tunneling to take players out of the game is the objective?
---
Gecco posted on their Instagram that they will be unveiling more from the Dead by Daylight license at San Diego Comic-Con  on 7/18-7/21. Wraith was the first statue shown and Hillbilly and Trapper seem to be in the works as well. 
---
For those unfamiliar with the company. Gecco is a Japanese figure manufacturer that makes premium format collectibles from various gaming franchises, most notably for the Dark Souls series. Being a premium format company, I can fully expect these statues to cost somewhere around $250-300 each.
---
gee i cannot wait until Ruin becomes teachable
---
In my defense she told me 2
---
That really is a plot twist if the killer is getting scared.
---
Sounds like it's functioning as intended then. As a survivor you are gambling that the killer doesn't have noed(or that you won't be hit before getting out of the gates) by ignoring the totems. 
---
Pick your poison:
---
* Potentially being 1-hit downed when the gens are done
---
* Potentially wasting your time cleansing dull totems in case the killer has NOED.
---
she is on it
---
It just depends whose on at what time.
---
Bet
---
I was playing vs. a wraith and after uncloacked he didn't have a redstain, is that one of his add-ons?
---
Very rare David Romero?
---
Damn, your right
---
I know am diagnosed with bipolar, anyway pray beads is the single most broken thing in this game in my opinion.
---
i don't know, I'm not a game developer. I'm thinking it's time to admit that to fully offer a healthy game experience, dbd needs to be reworked from the ground up. currently you can't fix core issues of the game (most notably, the fact that most killers can't compete with the speeds of gen repair since they lack map control) without breaking some other part of the game. for example, a good fix in theory would be to reduce map sizes so low map pressure killers have it easier. however, this would just end up making the high map pressure killers (nurse, spirit, billy, hag which are all very strong) overpowered. you can make gen repairs longer, which would end up making survivor gameplay more boring and frustrating. you could shorten or reduce the number of loops, which would alienate casual or weak survivor players from the game. to me it seems that there are few ways of actually fixing this. especially since the devs have been working solely on band-aid fixes which are only healthy for the game as long as these problems exist. so if they actually do somehow fix the core issues, the band-aids they've implemented will become the new core issues.
---
then stop tunneling/camping?
---
This same thing happened too me. Hooked everyone except for a Claud who had urban and was P3, so she just used a key and escaped, then told me too ‚Äúget on her level.‚Äù this fan base is so horrid sometimes xD
---
PWYF is good on Leatherface and ok on Wraith
---
It‚Äôs a good buff. Really makes him viable with map pressure and help in the chase. But he won‚Äôt see auras when survivors are asleep, and there‚Äôs no action speed debuff.
---
Why wouldn't you leave at the sight of a 500ping?
---
I found it weird too but stands have much more potential than hamon
---
I'm sorry if I offended you, I just wanted to use an hyperbole.
---
Some times I see a downvoted comment and another one that said the same thing and got upvoted.
---
I mean it‚Äôs luck whether or not the perk is just decent or really good. 
---
It‚Äôs never not good - unless it‚Äôs scratched mirror Myers. In that case, good luck.

Sry but can you remember insta-saw billy?
---
i mean... the only thing your getting from this stuff is downvotes so..
---
But not the lost packets, spikes, low connection speed.
---
Yea i forgot about wraith. He has an addon that hides the red stain and terrorradius for 6 seconds after uncloacking. Its a grey one but wraith gotta lot of usefull addons
---
I'd say about equal. Though Jane's ass is like fucked up
---
"lol you can counter nurse by just hiding."
---
Even if they only appeared on lockers and generators for Demogorgon matches, that would be rad.
---
I know this struggle so well, it plagued everyone.
---
Is this a spoiler
---
It‚Äôs Ace(?) and ghostface seeing each other while he‚Äôs doing a gen
---
if you do that, i will let myself get downed so you get punished. learn how to unhook properly or choke. I've had enough of survivors thinking that BT makes it okay to farm people. (unless the killer is actually facecamping ofc that's a different story)
---
I don't know off the very top of my head but it sounds like something he may have. Could have been The Ghost add-on
---
i think the only nerf thatd even be potentially considered would be a pray beads nerf. she's pretty balanced imo and while i do find it annoying as piss when she does the "imma stand at the pallet and see how he reacts, potentially buying myself a free hit" i like how going again a good one takes more than just ring around the rosie simulator
---
also, nurse """rework""" is confirmed
---
YOU SOCK
---
The demogorgon "laugh" is so unnerving, I really hope it makes it into dbd. There's so much creatively that they can implement.
---
Wat
---
I need the doctor statue!!!
---
Not really, no.
---
Many survivors have this rule where you're not allowed to play certain killers like Nurse or Billy. Not allowed to use certain addons like spirit beads, or that "no bell sound" addon for wraith. Not allowed to run ruin, noed, or the spirit fury+ enduring combo. Not allowed to chase or down a survivor that has just been unhooked, not allowed to slug, not allowed to be close enough to any hooked survivor that you can respond to their being unhooked. Not allowed to put the survivors in a "3-gen" situation where you can easily patrol the only remaining gens, not allowed to play perk builds that make skillchecks hard.
---
That‚Äôs any major update but ok...
---
It will be posted
---
Packet loss if severe will show as spikes which can be seen in lobby. Low bandwidth affecting RTT will also show as high ping...
---
Thanks
---
Then bring back the old decisive. A perk that rewards bad gameplay
---
Wow I thought it was a 3D modeling  or something at first, Amazing cosplay!
---
Ah that explains it, i wanted to dead hard but didn't see a redstain and the killer was lagging already so i thought that was a side effect. Thank you.
---
Most survivors play survivor because its the easiest role to play as, they want low effort low skill games, they don‚Äôt to put in the effort to find said totems.
---
Joseph best boi
---
"how are you even self caring in the corner? You're not even injured!!"
---
I hit rank 1 survivor a year ago and stopped playing once I got the achievement. The only way that I would describe the survivors at that level was "efficient". The saltiest people were the killers. I had a Billy that would go out of his way to tunnel and (literally) facecamp me until I was dead every time I wound up in a game with him. He said he would do it in endgame chat and he did in every game that I wound up with him in.
---
This was pre ping indicator and I ultimately wound up installing the ping detector thing to dodge him just because of that guy. Don't know if it's still like that, but word to the wise.
---
Sorry, I just assumed it was about being salty. My mistake. I can understand the thought of them being to strong. They have a lot of benefits for the survivor side, including quick getaways that can change chases drastically. However, most of the time they can use them once a chase, and people can mess up with these perks. Most of the time as well, a killer can somewhat counter with their power, even if not directly.
---
Oh same thing. Sometimes when they have "ttv" in their names i go check them out after the game. Most of them are cool with it, but some will then start accusing me of stream sniping lol
---
Story of my life with this game, I‚Äôve had games where I‚Äôve spawned In the killer terror radius.
---
why does he have the Brandon James mask
---
was a tiny streamer forgot the name
---
Yeah getting "3-genned" sucks as a survivor but the harsh truth is that the killer can't 3-gen on their own, the survivors **MUST** help the killer 3-gen. If we get 3-genned I don't blame the killer I blame myself and my teammates for not paying attention and letting it happen.
---
Is that why I dont escape as survivor most games yet 4k most games when both my ranks are 9 and 10 at the moment. Hmmmmm
---
Maybe he is one fo those geniuses that keep feeding him stalk levels and then complain when they get tombstoned.
---
Yeah they are low ranks ? What‚Äôs your point ? I start at 10 after rank resets, it‚Äôs not a high rank,
---
Btw if i remember right tier 1 myers also dont got redstain maybe even tier 2 myers im not sure
---
Yep that is how I did that
---
I will probably do something similar with huntress for her "snipe hatchets" achievement, I will just let them farm while yeeting axes at them from afar.
---
Hit the nail on the head. It's hard not to tilt once you start missing your swings. . Going in that for swing and missing quickly starts becoming aggravating. Not gonna lie, I've DC'd a few times due to frustration. It's an uphill battle, though. Some matches everyone escapes, other matches I'll mori all 4 survivors before a gen is done. I guess it depends on how many games I've played and how tired/titled I am. On the other hand, that fucking corn field map I always lose on
---
Pretty much all of the female survivors before jane have the exact same body model, and they all have the same ass, which is none until they crouch and the body physics have an aneurysm.
---
The bandwidth is the size of the pipe the ping is how much it takes to get from one side to the other. Unless the pipe is full you can't see it with the ping.
---
The ping you see is an average, if it was real time you would see it fluctuate more, spot loss and spikes.
---
You don't need severe packet loss to feel the game jitter.
---
sci-fi, not horror
---
The same way all the dlc character are. Sure the nurse is garbage too but at least everyone has access to them so they can see what they do actually learn how to fight her. There is not a single balanced dlc character when you consider the vanilla game.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre serious or trolling.
---
diese show war zu gut
---
u/primadonnap lmfao üòÇ
---
Purposely pointing the killer to the locker she was hiding is indeed very shitty of you. 24 hour ban feels like a fair punishment to me.
---
In the game I was talking about I was a spirit. I had one person on a hook. One person off, one gen left. And the hatch was by the dude on the hook.  I got called a camper because I was check by the hatch. And the closest gen. there was no need to check the other gens on the other side of the map because I knew as soon as I phased over there. They would get the unhook off or get the hatch when the dude died.  I got called a camper.  I always love being called a camper. Because what camper comes into a game with Devour Hope?  I always try not to be toxic. The only time I‚Äôll hook the same survivor that was just unhooked is when a door is open. Because if I let them go. That‚Äôs literally just giving them the win.
---
I think every single high rank person agrees nurse is OP especially with addon. Nerfing her is a no brainer.
---
Black Sperm, is that you?
---
Maybe dont tunnel or camp then?
---
You meet an asshole in the morning and hes the asshole. You meet assholes all day long and maybe you're the asshole?
---
I would love one of these
---
#if they weren't so expensive!
---
Yeah I don't get it, being facecamped to death sucks but... it's not as if it has no in-game consequences. While the killer was sitting there staring at me or hitting me my team was cranking out gens and escaping. Those are the consequences, the killer chose to ensure my death, sacrificing their blood point gain to do so.
---
I'll take that deal.
---
Wow! fuck me, I didn't knew they changed it.
---
Dang, back in the day all you had to do was hit 100 survivors coming out from invisibility, I got it that way, way easier than the current merciless level requirement.
---
Well shit
---
I see more people saying its unfair to solo survivor players more than anything. And they are right. 
---
Small game isn‚Äôt a fix to it either.
---
They even admitted that it was probably an accident. Its not the Megs fault the killer lost sight of her
---
Very cool, nice drawing.
---
Legit this is what i always say on our discord.
---
You don't run perks when you play survivor right? Because running perks is easy mode.
---
Yikes. Maybe just the idea of Survivor is the ‚Äúeasiest role to play‚Äù but as a whole I disagree. 
---
Both Survivor and Killer have major skill gaps and I don‚Äôt think either can be called an easier role. Stop.
---
Hey look an actually valid matchmaking complaint post
---
Because I stay there purposefully so it's not all try hard, though I dont play try hard also. My point is that how is killer harder when you see more 4ks than 4 man escapes
---
This would make the survivors only objective to do gens. And y‚Äôall would STILL complain about gen rushing lol.
---
I think thats dwight with his pizza hat
---
Good thing is everyone will call him an asshole when queue takes forever.
---
It's... Sci-fi horror....
---
But I already have that...
---
Rank up and it won‚Äôt be easy anymore.
---
how much are they?
---
This is why she‚Äôs the only one I demand gets healed. I don‚Äôt need her yelling halfway across the map while I‚Äôm on a gen. I unlocked iron will as a teachable specifically for her ( now I just need it to appear in her bloodweb)
---
That kinda happened to me recently too.  I saw twitch in some dudes name and normally when I see that they‚Äôre never streaming. But this dude was. I showed up. Wished him a glhf. And locked my screen. I phase to the furthest gen and he was there. BUT.  I didn‚Äôt see him there.  So I went on to chase the person I did see.  He had moved from that point. But of course he moved to the gen right in front of the hook from where I hooked the first person. He was he next to be hooked.  A couple mins go by and he‚Äôs on the other side of the map and he must have missed a heal check or something as I got the notification and went that way. Put him on the hook and he let himself go.  I continued with the game as normal and went back to his stream to give him a ‚Äúgg I guess‚Äù he went on to say that I clapped him and we ended up playing together for the rest of the day.  I went back to re watch what I had missed at the start to realise that I was the first killer he went up against in his stream and he called me out as a stream sniper throughout most of the game.  Which I find funny because If I was sniping. A.  I wouldn‚Äôt know where he was right at the start due to twitch delay. B. I would have gone after him and not a different survivor.    It‚Äôs a shame. He was a bit of a noob so he didn‚Äôt understand stuff like BBQ showing aura and other things that allow you to do so.  Which is strange seen as he was just about a green rank.
---
Not gonna lie, it really feels like no mither is purely a "sandbag your team" perk.
---
I don't know if I remember correctly they made a trapper one and it was pretty expensive
---
Go hide in a bush mate i tank hits even with BT
---
only tier 1 doestn have the red stain
---
Removed - Oversaturated Content
---
Meh, maybe it‚Äôs just from personally experience, when I just want a relaxed session I‚Äôll play survivor, I find it much easier and less stressful, just knowing I have three other people helping makes it easier, as killer you have to rely on just yourself, I‚Äôve had no mither survivor games where I have pipped and feel like I didn‚Äôt contribute much at all.
---
its sci-fi with jump scenes
---
100% other people can play :) just want to make sure I put emphasis on creating a safe space for people who are apart of the LGBTQ+ know they can play.
---
[Yeah I think you‚Äôre right](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/7/7e/D_Head03.png)
---
it is and it was before. 
---
its laugheble well at least the nerf wasnt massive

Going out of your way to do it even if it negatively hurts you means that even if it costs you your life you WILL flash the killer the whole match. Look, I don‚Äôt wanna get stuck in your strawman argument because I stepped my foot into it by accident, let‚Äôs focus on the fact **customer support was not supportive enough**
---
why i get the feeling you are one of the many crybabies that demanded the devs for freddy to be gutted when he got released....
---
I'm both unlucky AND bad, so I usually need a perk that can work in spite of that
---
My life right now.
---
There isn't one coming, but my idea to make this came up recently, and the last Blood Hunt was like 2 weeks ago.
---
And if course the person who rescues the hooked survivor runs in front of the one who was just unhooking, instead of blocking and taking aggro:P
---
Not mine, my girlfriends. üòÇ
---
you are bad if you actively ignore totems you see, its you shooting yourself in the foot
---
Sound like BHVR
---
wdym? am i about to get wooshed?
---
*Ghost Face stalks* ‚ÄúI can see you, bitch!‚Äù
---
-_-
---
For everyone saying ‚ÄúoH jUst cLeAnsE tHe tOTeMs.‚Äù First af all you don‚Äôt even know if a killer has NOED. Secondly, I believe each totem takes somewhere around 15 secs to cleanse so take 15x5 so that‚Äôs 75 seconds and you spend another 90 seconds running around the map. THAT IS 165 SECONDS LOOKING FOR A PERK YOU DONT EVEN KNOW THE KILLER HAS. To add on top of that, if you are playing with randoms and have no communication you could spend 2 minutes looking for the last totem when someone else already got it.
---
&gt; I ran back to Meg's hiding spot and opened the locker to put the Killer back on her trail
---
and 
---
&gt; Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates
---
sure sounds accurate to me. i wouldn't want to play with you
---
Shouldn't that be David? You know, the original owner of the perk?
---
I call it snuggle mode
---
Perhaps campers trying to make it known this is okay.
---
Besides ghost face having a bit of a bigger belly it‚Äôs an amazing drawing dude! :)
---
I mean if it's a tradeoff like "remove/rework NOED, but make active totems look dull baseline", some will agree.
---
My advice is don't be in too big of a hurry to climb ranks. Games are often more fun at lower ranks lol.
---
Insta saw and not like any of Nurse‚Äôs stuff? Cause Nurse‚Äôs addons are way worse.
---
Combine no mither with object of obsession the very best combination lol
---
Because the way the exploit works is that the game thinks there's 4 survivors, but one of the survivors exploited to load in as a killer.
---
Congrats mate!
---
There‚Äôs a fucking mobile dbd? We takin phones and such?
---
Spine Chill is an S tier perk for these exact reasons. I've gotten to the point now that I feel useless without it.
---
I've never watched Stranger Things. Is "oh hi!" a reference? I plan on starting it sometime soon.
---
Not sure about how big the playerbase still is, but I still play and have tons of fun. Definitely not as popular as it once was but it's very much alive.
---
There's literally NOTHING good about his current kit lmao. Invisibility? His damn lullaby literally tells you where he's coming from, it's useless. And what do you mean he can't force people to sleep? Everyone in match literally starts with a timer that puts them to sleep.
---
Hey! I float around that rank because I prefer not to take it all THAT seriously, but try to focus on my gens and saves.
---
SerCapelli on PS4, EST
---
Lmao
---
I honestly don't know if the trade-off to be able to hit people at all times will surpass the vision Freddy has now... I rather liked the way you could slug people in sleep mode and hunt other survivors down. It was a great late game change of strategy that usually ended in 4 kills.
---
I know that person with the Insta-heal medkit was mad once he noticed it was the Plague
---
Its funny cuz nobody plays nurse cuz she is not even free on mobile
---
Because people don't like changing how they play to adapt to challenges, they'd rather just continue playing as they always do and whine about anything that causes their usual method not to work as well.
---

---
He doesn't move at 115%... Also LF is shit and even Billy isn;t great against decent survivors
---
The hatch isnt killer sided... if killer finds it first too bad for the survivor, if the survivor finds it first too bad for the killer and if the killer closes the hatch and the survivior has a key the survivior always wins
---
It's mostly luck based. So you have to find the hatch ASAP and close it. Some survivors will anticipate this and head straight for a door. Some will look for the hatch. Once closed if the doors are far apart you will most likely not be able to patrol both of them and the survivor will win. If they are close together it's almost a garaunteed win. Likewise you can anticipate and gamble that the survivor is by a door waiting for you to close the hatch and you can meet them there and chase them. Again it's all luck for both players. I'd a foot the attitude: whatever happens, happens, it doesn't matter either way :) on a side note, I've seen a couple cocky survivors die to EGC because they didn't leave for whatever reason and they misjudged the timer. Karams name is the entity, and she's a bitch ;)
---
Nah, im posting this here because I literally play normal and getting flamed anyways :)
---
I wouldn't say it's harder to be "a killer", but it's "harder" to be Nurse or Huntress due to the cap on sensitivity (on PC you have far more options, particularly the freedom to change your mouse's DPI settings), the general inaccuracy of a thumbstick versus a mouse, the occasional frame rate issues, and perhaps to a lesser extent the difference between a trigger and a button for charging your power.
---
Now, sauce for the goose, survivors have the same problems - but they're generally not trying to aim at a moving target. *If* you used the right level of charge *and if* there's no dropped frames *and if* you're on target then you only need to worry about predicting the juke.
---
Upping the sensitivity cap would help, from memory I don't recall seeing any deadzone options or curve settings that would allow people greater control over their sticks.
---
&gt;Quote From Man Teabagged
---
will bluetooth controller support be added to dbd mobile when its released?
---
Not to mention the freddy rework wasn‚Äôt entirely a rework but rather a complete recreation of the character. Pretty much all of his ability is completely new mechanics, stuff that seems complicated coding-wise. It‚Äôs not surprising that it took them a while.
---
I get your point man. But communication between survivors isn‚Äôt a given. Most games there will be that one solo that cleansed a dull totem for no reason. NOED isn‚Äôt op, but I just want bvhr to put some way for us to know how many totems are left.
---
When ghostface first came out it was insanely long maybe like 10-15 mins to get a lobby? Now it‚Äôs around like 2-5 so idk
---
Frame rate got better recently.
---
Thanks for proving OP's point. you're butthurt, and you didn't even play against OP!
---
Just cleanse totems lol
---
Unrelated to the video, but on PS4 if you tap the 'share' button it will let you save a video clip. By default the clip is only 15 minutes long but you can increase the max size up to 60 minutes.
---
After taking a clip you can insert a USB stick into your PS4 and copy files (both screenshots and video files) from your PS4 and onto the drive. The drive will need formatted the first time you use it, but after that it should be fairly simple.
---
Then it's as simple as putting the USB in your PC and uploading the files through there.

---
There is a BR game called "Cuisine Royale" the on the preview program on XB1. Kinda a mix between Fortnight and PubG but without the building. Its free and worth checking out.
---
Thanks for the info! I wear glasses 24/7 and I my contacts are too expensive because of astigmatism so I can‚Äôt wear mask very often unless I get a free trial pair, which I usually do for Halloween. I‚Äôd never ask the question before so I wondered about it.
---
They never mentioned it on the Stream, but injuring a Survivor will also instantly put them to sleep.
---
Little things will mess up an entire blink so you have to know the map
---
What's the show called? Now I'm interested.
---
Welcome to The Hookers* how tough are ya?
---
It really isn't as hard as you think. I am able to easily do a 360 on console after a blink. Now charging my blink and trying to aim it is hard, because of the sensitivity, but the hit is not. You just gotta learn your limitations. If you have a PS4 and want to see my Nurse in action, then my psn is KingExcalibur8.
---
Spine chill, balanced landing, iron will and bond.
---
I died when I read this, cuz I literally learn everything from memes in the sub
---
This is what I try to explain to my friend whenever they tell me that survivors need a buff. In theory and in decent practice. If everyone is the same skill level within the game. The survivors should be able to pull off a win imo. Like you mentioned it only takes 1 chase to pop 3 gens. Given that they arent potatoes and do all the gens on 1 side of the map it means that the killer is on constant patrol and if the survivors are in coms with each other the survivor getting chased can loop the killer around a gen that isnt being worked on/finished. Either the killer lets the survivor go to the have them work on totems/gens or they try to get the 1 down and thats about it.
---
You should flush those thoughts more often then
---
Freddys aura tracking gives him unparalleled amounts of information letting you reengage a Chase immediately if you got shook along with keeping track of what other survivors are doing.
---
Lullaby only tells people you're near, the fact they can't see you until you sleep them still has value and can be used in some mind games.
---
As for forcing people to sleep I should have been more clear, he can't actively force people to sleep. Which means new Freddy is forced to play "mother may I" anytime he wants to snare someone or be tricky with a dream pallet while survivors can cough lightly and make themselves immune to half of Freddys power.
---
The thing about NOED is it's pretty OP, but it requires the game to go all the way to gate powering. With the nerfs that "Remember Me" got so it now only gives 16s. instead of up to 30s. extra gate switch time. I think NOED is a requirement for a lot of builds and killers. Since the Devs don't do anyting the lengthen the game even a little bit more and Gen Rushing is becoming a bigger and bigger issue at all levels of the game I think the late game 1 hits are quite okay... I don't use NOED on Freddy anymore though since he doesn't really need it inho. I run most of my games with BBQ+C, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel &amp; Bamboozle and they work very good with Freddy. On my off-killer (The Plague) I do use NOED her disease during the game (and the subsequent Broken status) and NOED late game makes her quite terrible to play against and with "Franklin's Demise" she's just a pain in the old tuchus!
---
I just started playing this game 2 weeks ago and that is the biggest turn off about it. People get so pissed when you beat them and you get accused of doing all kinds of things you didn't so they can justify why they lost.
---
Monto's builds are fun, and I'd love to give them a proper try once I finally unlock everything on all my killers. It's gonna take quite some time, but with BBQ the grind isn't so bad.
---
Apparently some people are still playing in June 2016; when Wraith was 'OP' and Hillbilly was the 'weakest' Killer.
---
Yeah , I‚Äôll have to lug my Alienware laptop out and get it all set up... r/foundthemobileuser
---
NOED isnt op, but it's still bullshit, Killers shouldn't be rewarded for losing.
---
I know megs using sprint burst is basically a meme but sprint burst I bugged right now and in my opinion the best exhaustion perk in the game
---
Yeah, survivors should be given compensation. I don't think ti would be overpowered though as not only would it not synergise that well with Hex: Ruin, you actually have to find the totems to use on the map.I am all for the tweaking of numbers though.
---
How can you easily do a 360? Anytime I blink and a survivor ends up behind me, the time it takes me to turn 180 is enough time for them to make enough distance so I can't even lunge and hit them.
---
Look at the flair, friend.
---
Lol darn, it's a reference to final fantasy 6. There's a boss where you fight a phantom train, and a character who does martial arts moves and one is a suplex. So you can literally suplex a train. It's a big meme to FF fans.
---
You had one job
---
Why I get the feeling you are one of those eleatist pricks that buys all the DLC exclusively to shit on less fortunate player. Piss off scum.
---
I have done this so many times on accident and I bet the people I do it to think the exact same thing
---
So I need to know every wall of every map in the game just to be able to do well with a killer? Sounds like a whole lotta fun to me.
---
Survivors would genrush anyway. This perk helps in chase so it actually can slow down the game by catching survivors anyway.
---
You handle it by slugging.
---
I main survivor now with a decent understanding (or used to have one) of the game. As a killer I had fun and I wanted to try survivor. I find survivor fun when I don't touch a gen. I usually try to seek out the killer and try to loop them and blind them because its more interactive than just P3 Claud super glued to a gen and walking out without ever getting hit by a killer.
---
I don't know, i think the second one you get caught you get a day banned, then permabanned, my guess
---
Well most campers and tunnelers do think what they do is perfectly normal and insanely enough most campers and tunnelers I see in-game will literally deny that they did such a thing in end-game chat, so yeah can't really trust you on your word.
---
Ruin is fine even when destroyed as it on average (for me) lasts around 2-4 mins, which is a lot of time saving
---
NoEd is overrated though, it‚Äôs a perk that only helps you once you‚Äôve already lost. I‚Äôd rather have a perk that stalls and let‚Äôs the game go on longer than a catch-up mechanic, which is why I‚Äôm not a fan of blood warden either
---
Yeah but we have shirtless David. Along with unbuttoned shirt David. Michael Myers has never been shirtless and it would be incredibly weird to add. Why don't we advocate for more shirtless male characters, which is actually possible and doesn't mess with an iconic character?
---
I kinda feel the opposite lol that‚Äôs when all the try hard sweaty and camping tunneller killers come out of the wood works. 
---
I don‚Äôt exactly need bp for anything anymore so it‚Äôs meh for me.
---
For me, if i know they are behind me or are gonna end up behind me, I lunge as I do the 360 or I quickly 360 or 180 and i lunge and get them.
---
The fact that one of them has an XXXTentacion PFP makes this even more hilarious
---
I don‚Äôt dc. At the end of the day.  It‚Äôs still bloodpoints. That I worked to get.  So unless there‚Äôs a hillbilly with nurse ability blinking. I stay in the game
---
I wouldn't recommend even trying her. You might get a 4k here and there, but it's either a 4k or no kills. Just depends whether the survivors are braindead or not.
---
Too real
---
I agree to an extent I get salty messages sometimes but that‚Äôs only when I purposely camp someone. Maybe you‚Äôre focusing someone without realizing
---
Well A, the new ones will match PC frame rate (if everything is to be belived)
---
And B, I'm not sure if that will help

It's even better on Plague
---
This usually happens when the killer has absolute shit ping.
---
Just say ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù when they send you stuff like that :)
---
Why is ‚Äúhoe‚Äù capitalized but not Clown?
---
I do as well, but I can do a 360 after a blink. It's just a bit slow if you dont do it immediately
---
People just DC if they miss their No Homo check, anyway.
---
Its honestly embarrassing the way survivors whine. I play both sides and if a killer tunnels me, its probably because he thinks its his best chance at winning. I could escape him if i were better at juking/looping
---
How did you miss?!
---
Since I had the traps there I tried to block the middle to push them into the traps lul
---
I only give hatch if they played like normal people and weren't dicks anyways. Usually I don't really play seriously, but when they're dicks and I'm playing a regular killer I'll damn well do my best to kill them lmao. Just kinda hard with nothing but Tinkerer :P
---
Think about it. Your objective is not just to kill, but to make sure gens don‚Äôt get done so they can‚Äôt escape. If you worry about a survivor who now has to heal, you are wasting time on focusing on the gens that are being completed when you go towards the hook. 
---
At the end of the day, yes you can play however you want. But if you want more points/higher chance at killing everyone and not having more gens get done, not proxy camping is a good way to ensure that.
---
ew an X fan
---
Agree. High sensitivity is a must for most killers, but the Nurse needs it more than any of the others. I‚Äôll also never understand why the add-on that shows you the landing aura of her blink is very rare instead of common.
---
And how can you end games fast Hm? He has no chase potential, no way to finish a chase quickly. And saying I don't need to wait is stupid. You should at least try it once. You might end up liking
---
"So should I just struggle or...?"
---
"Is killer still by you?"
---
"I have Kindred on, you tell me!"
---
I figured I swung too soon , but after watching the replay I‚Äôm confused. Maybe he used dead hard into a trap ?
---
Yeah just walk around and don‚Äôt hit the survivors to establish that you are friendly. Then let them do the generators still just spinning in circles and messing around. Eventually just start blinking and pick one up and drop them. They‚Äôll get nervous but just don‚Äôt hook anyone so they know you‚Äôre just farming.
---
Still though as a girl who has a big butt. Jane's big but pancake butt looks funky and unrealistic as fuck lol
---
I mean x is the superior zoom button
---
I know it‚Äôs so tilting sometimes. I really don‚Äôt know but if you‚Äôre talking about the Haddonfield houses, I think they‚Äôre a little tricky since the inside is raised from the outside, so you either go through the whole thing or you don‚Äôt at all. I used to think maybe if your blink is at least halfway through an object you‚Äôll get to the other side and if it‚Äôs less than halfway you won‚Äôt, but I really don‚Äôt know these days.
---
Because I did that meme in a hurry while struggling
---
Lmfaooo.  I only play swf now bc of this.
---
Yikes. You just proved the OP‚Äôs point.
---
Lemme just repost that without that issue (and better cropping)
---
I'vr had the opposite experience while trying to get into survivor lately. Team full of R12-15s vs R20 killers with 1 perk half the time. Both a Michael and Ghostface with 1 perk said it was their first game with the characters too.  
---
  
---
Sidenote: Don't say "ez" in chat after when the killer had 1 fucking perk. Actually, just don't say "gg ez" at all. I had to defend new killer players last night 4 times because these assholes are so toxic.
---
It wasn't the tbagging that was stupid but the fact that I grabbed the survivor, yet they still escaped and tbagged, and it's not as bad as your making it out to be.
---
The other day I was accused of hacking because I was able to instadown survivors as hag. I had Make Your Choice....
---
I'm talking about the redwood house.
---
‚ÄúWhy should I care about survivors‚Äô opinions if they don‚Äôt care about my totems?‚Äù
---
Why should they respect your totems in the first place? What?
---
Funny enough, I was playing as Myers and just refused to stalk for the entire match. I wasn't even running Scratched Mirror, I just wanted to run the entire match with an Evil Within 1 Myers. 15 minutes later, I double piped and got all Iridescent Emblems...
---
Yeah, I'm never stalking as Myers again.
---
Pre-Change Decisive was equally as worse as NOED. Both are perks that give bad players the easy way out to an escape/kills. It lets trash killers get kills to rank up from equally trash survivors, and they get to Rank 1 easy. Again, same with Decisive. That‚Äôs my problem with it.
---
Good man.
---
Mother‚Äôs dwelling?
---
Far left.
---
When is the reset? I assume with the new update and Freddy build
---
I don‚Äôt wanna have to learn Unbreakable and Borrowed Time.  The update‚Äôs gonna suck.
---
Just say ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù when somebody sends you hatemail :)
---
Who complains about the scream volume?
---
Does it do that? I thought it was doing that with the "facing the X" tips, but none of them have been the killer the tip suggests.
---
13th of every month

---
this comment really hit home for me. My survivor rank has slowly been going up, and the games are getting more stressful. definitely a lot less fun.
---
i miss the lower rank days.
---
Oh keys are a huge crutch too.  Broken item for premature escape with no counterplay very stupid item.  But then again killers have moris which are the same thing only for early kills so you couldn't really mess with one without adjusting the other.  But I'm sorry running a perk that allows you to collect the strongest buffs possible for killer in exchange for playing poorly or not at all even (you could technically afk and still earn your instadown) is just lazy poor design.  Killers that learn to play without it are generally much stronger players.  You can do a lot with that 4th slot when you don't feel required to save it for an emergency safety blanket.
---
I also teabag at the gate shit I don't care I escaped heres a teabag
---
That‚Äôs now how his story goes at all though. 
---
He does tests on prisoners but no one really keeps an eye on him so he tortured them. 
---
Then once the people go see what he‚Äôs doing they come across the doctor as we fully know.
---
Why ? If you play against a Clown in red ranks, that match is gonna be EZ.
---
I love reddit
---
Better version's here now
---
The fact that you play survivor too doesn't mean you aren't an entitled killer.  You literally just said as much twice that if a killer kills 3 survivors they deserve to kill the 4th.  That is the dictionary definition of entitlement.  Luckily the devs didn't agree and added the hatch mechanic to have some form of balance for the all too likely scenario where your entire team is potato and no matter how good you are individually you won't be repairing 5 gens against them.  A survivor shouldn't be guaranteed to die simply because the other 3 don't know how to play the game.  Hell man it isn't even a likely chance they get out with EGC anyways.  I find and close the hatch successfully 4 out of 5 killer games.  The new system is heavily skewed in our favor.  Kind of takes balls to even bitch about it let alone take it to the extreme you do here.
---
Yeah but enough people bitched about his current set up. I'm liking the new stuff but I'm hating the psudeo-invisibility and lack of aura tracking.
---
However, Freddy is easy to survive against with a team who all know what they are doing and move in on each other. He's at his strongest when everyone are running around like idiots because they hear the lulliby and panic off gens.
---
So I'm really interested to see what I can do with new Freddy
---
I tried again today and after 5 minutes there was an Lobby for me. The surv came in the Lobby after a few seconds
---
Im not sure who would be the best choice on mobile, any tips ? :D
---
#ThankYou
---
Not if you're just 60 hours in game tho
---
So, I have a LOT of questions, as I'm trying to learn both sides.  
---
1. If a Hag puts a trap on an interactable thing, and interacting with it stands you up (Exit Gate, hooks, etc), does it trigger the trap during the interaction?
---
2. Is there an actual way to escape basement if the killer hovers around there, or do you just have to take the L as if you got hook camped?
---
3. Is it worth putting bloodpoints into characters you need for dailies? I get very few bloodpoints due to my low skill (usually around 6k per match) and it seems like you need them for a lot of stuff on both sides, and that dailies are the major way to get them. But stuff like "survive once with x survivor" is especially dificult for me due to how difficult it is for me to survive as anything..
---
Imagine not having kindred
---
 We gotta take the bad with the good. If you ask me, having Bill really makes up for having to grind for teachables. You get to keep his perks if you already have them, but I don't know if that only applies to survivors who already have his perks unlocked, and if you want it for a survivor you've never leveled up before, you'll have to unlock the teachable from Bill. I'm not sure, but I am sure it'll be worth it.
---
Noob3 is a really good player so just take it as a compliment
---
The Game has 20+ safe pallets and it's a super good map for Balanced Landing. It's a very strong map for Nurse, Spirit and Hag, but for killers like Hillbilly or Huntress, it's a pretty bad map.
---
Yeah games do it all the time.. a 2 killer game mode is a major update and will change a lot of killer scripts and survivor scripts... but it‚Äôs a lot more along the lines of a chapter without a new map or character under the assumption the killers don‚Äôt interact (personally I think all you‚Äôd have to do is stop killers from destroying the same gen at the same time and picking up the same survivor)
---
Because it gives killers a speedboost and free instadowns as a reward for not doing their jobs by defending the generators?
---
I usually don't care about tbagging, it's just this one time that the grab didn't work that was annoying.
---
I haven‚Äôt played mobile but probably spirit
---
did you kill any of them?
---
Not so fast, it isn't hard to run from glowing red object to another, the problem comes when you find a survivor, that ONE survivor is taking you away from your objective while the others are completely fine and now safe since you're chasing someone else. It's so easy to waste the killers time but you'll only effect a survivor group if you have three unable to participate (down or hooked) and that is the only way you waste survivors time. And they complained about legion because they didn't need to down or hook to stop the game for the survivors. But anyone survivor can stop the game for any killer that's where the difficulty lies in the killer role
---
Yeah 5 mins is the avg queue time for me. Takes a while
---
Also, they fixed they aura issues from Ormond.
---
And you forgot to mention : Disturbed Ward has the most OP building in the game.
---
GG matchmaking
---
No I got flashlighted every time I picked one up :(
---
Tbh, a lot of survivor mains are equivalent to Olaf in terms of comprehension. Myself included.
---
You don't deserve a reward for playing badly. It was why old DS was nerfed and it's why NOED should see a rework too.
---
Thank you‚ùóÔ∏èit was really fun be the huntress
---
So you did a meme about yourself facecamping a random guy... Your matches must be as funny as this meme and the post lobby full of positivity for sure lol.
---
There is nothing thicc about Spirit.  Nice ass, maybe, but not thicc.  Don't @ me, Asian fetishists.
---
impossible
---
The thing is he's still kinda just an M1 killer with a little extra sauce. He's got cool pressure and mobility but at red ranks I still don't see him able to stop the gens from flying against most teams. His teleport has sooooooo much startup time and if you bait it by canceling it like the devs said you could do for a "mindgame" like.... they just walk away, see that you didn't TP and then just casually walk back.
---
Don't worry, you'll be killing them all easily one day
---
Thank yooou!! I was afraid of the result at the first moment but now I like it
---
uwu
---
True, I am good in chases but suck at flash light lol
---
Joke's on them, I'm super fucking gay.
---
I just had two games in a row where I died on my first hook
---
This happens pretty often so I‚Äôm not upset
---
This probably won't help you, but i get the exact same thing why on of my cats lay on one of the function keys on top of my keyboard. The game doesn't exhibit any type of behavior other than a frame drop.
---
Actually, i think it's pretty good
---
Spirit.
---
This happens to me almost every game. Coupled with the mind numbing amount of bp grinding, I can't play DBD to much in a week or get frustrated
---
His lullaby isnt even direction dood. And yes, it helps him find survivors pretty effortlessly. Are you saying as Freddy you have trouble finding people? Loool.
---
Spirit..hands down. After Nurse I would say she is the strongest and fun to play with.
---
It depends on what killer type you play as and the perks you‚Äôre using. 
---
Also play more solo survivor to understand Killer reading. The more varied killers you go against will allow you to learn what to do/not to do vs certain killers and builds.
---
i've restarted steam/router/pc, nothing is helping.
---
Eh, I must be lucky or people are (as usual) blowing it out of proportion
---
I main clown, I never have issues with exhaustion perks lol.
---
Stop caring about upvotes / downvotes. This is a place for discussion, not for karma farming. Deleting a post because you're getting downvoted is idiotic.
---
I posted above, retail will probably be around $200-300. That‚Äôs the usually rate on their 1/6 statues.
---
I mean I kinda get it. I run gen protector perks and have a pretty heavy map pressure. I'm not bitching about it tho I find it hillarious tbh. The only thing that is incredibly annoying is when people disconnect.
---
I was just scratching the surface. There's also Yamoka, where the jungle gyms and bamboo are aids and as killer you're always constantly run into stuff with it as grass is giant just like bamboo, Lerys having a shit ton of vaults and walls making it very difficult for Nurses and billys, Swamp maps which are just considered generally unfun to play on and the list goes on.
---
Here is a doll so you can tell me where did sharp hand joe touch you.

---
Besides that, i don't purchase the dlcs to "shit on less fortunate players". I purchase them because i want to play as either freddy, myers, leatherface, amanda or ghostface, but you do you.
---
Happened to me the other day and EGC got me. Bullshit.
---
So correct..
---
This kinda goes the same even for killers other than spirit. I can't count the amount of times that someone gets unhooked, I run back and see scratch marks, follow them and it's the same guy that just got unhooked while the guy who saved is urban evasioning away. If you're the healthy survivor and the killer is coming back towards the hook you *need* to actively take the aggro away. Like, I don't want to be a dick and tunnel but I'm not going to just leave the only survivor whose location I know just to be nice; killer really really needs all the pressure they can get.
---
No but because it gives survivors a second task to do except of gens and slow the game down
---
I posted above in my rundown. Retail will more
---
Than likely be around $200-300, so as nice as they are they are more aimed towards serious collectors with disposable income.
---
Have the devs ever said why survive with friends is allowed in ranked? The difference in coordination is too big to just be overlooked. Every other match, I face a group in comms, find each other immediately, let each other know where I'm going, carry around 4 flashlights or 4 Instaheal medpacs or whatever other things they feel like and follow me around, maybe a key if they're feeling like getting the trapdoor. Isn't that a bit much to deal with compared to a normal match where the survivors have to relay information to each other through perks and movement, and not literally talking to each other the whole game with a pre prepared plan?
---
Thank you! I'll give it a try :)
---
I‚Äôm hoping they will make the whole cast of original killers. I‚Äôd love Legion and Spirit.
---
How did you know this was my fetish?
---
Yeah and then a console Nurse goes against PC survivors, seems fair.
---
im gonna miss old freddy in general, he‚Äôs so fun
---
I love dc's, especially since I suck. They're great
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dttb4Gkf8bA
---
I mean you're ending the game early regardless so even if using a key you're leaving scoring events on the table increasing the likelihood that you'd just safety possibly.
---
Unfortunately I don't stream but I'd be fascinated to share my play with people like you so they could see that it is in fact entirely possible to play killer sans training wheels.  I just play hyper aggressive and pressure the hell out of gens.  I chase efficiently and abandon the chase if they're in a particularly broken area.  80% of my wins are ended with at least 1 gen up because of this.  Gen rushing is largely a symptom of the complete lack of map pressure many killers display in their games.  If you don't disrupt the survivors they will just crank out gens.
---
Self care is good since you don't need a medkit and don't need ur teammates if you get hit.
---
Yeah worst map in the game.
---
I agree.  Sometimes when I play as killer and don't get a hit on a vaulting survivor, but other times I do. There's also no real consistancy in how close or far the survivors are when I hit them. It's weird.
---
I actually took a clip of me getting hit after a vault and it looked like blood gushed out of my shoulder like magic. People say survivors have to be very close to the window for a hit to register, but to me this was a little bullshit:
---

---
You can also upload videos directly to YouTube if you connect your accounts.
---
You probably did it a little too early. If you blind them before they regain control of their character you‚Äôll blind them but they won‚Äôt drop the survivor
---
Oh please stream or start a youtube. You seem like an expert.
---
I don't mind when 1 or 2 dc but I've been having a bunch of presumably swf full team disconnects.
---
The game only ends when someone disconnects while the game is still loading. People can still get disconnected because of shitty internet, but the game will still go on because the disconnect happened right after the game finished loading.
---
aw fuck, that's a bummer. glad you told me now though, or i'd just keep making the same dumb mistake. thanks mate!
---
Yeah, its like she either dominates from the beginning or get stomped, because she cant protect gens if everyone stop cleansing. And she cant finish a chase quickly, even though they are one hit.
---
Especially Haddonfield is bullshit, you just cant win..
---
Jane (thicc hardon)
---
Neither. Omega blink Nurse is the strongest.

New freddy is an oddity. Not saying it's good or bad but it's quite the cluster of abilities.

Hags teleport but with gens.

Doctors fake pallets.

Plague/Pig external "cleanse" action.

A mix of trapper and clown with the slow traps.

It's pretty obvious dude, more bloodpoints = more ebony mori's, instaheals and purple addons.

---
I'm personally holding off on saying it's good or not until I get a chance to play with it myself. As is I'm worried the rework will turn out to be a case of "looked good on paper, bad in practice". I do hope I'm proven wrong and it turns out Freddy is now awesome, but the number of downsides his power has now is unsettling.
---
but did you kill anyone?
---
Are u the guy from the last Ghostboi montage??
---
Freddy does force people to fall asleep everytime he hits them, and they also gradually fall asleep as time goes on. Sure survivors now have more ways to wake up, they will be asleep more often AND it takes longer to wake up as you get later in the match.
---
the gen teleport at the very least still allows for map pressure and getting across to far away ones when needed. It will probably work well with perks like Discordance, Thrilling Tremors, Pop goes the Weasel, Surveillance and so on to allow for actual gen control as well as tracking the next survivor. It will help initially for finding the first survivor and later in the match can be used more often more likely to just jump from survivor to survivor.
---
It is looking like his power is offering a secondary objective for survivors in the form of waking up, anti-loop capabilities with his traps, and map pressure/travel with his gen teleport. Not sure how you can see that as bad, or especially how it's somehow worse than the Freddy we have now.
---
Literally the only thicc beings in this game is Jane and (Yes, unironically) Clown
---
I heard rumors he might be playable character soon, possible a killer?
---
The idea of the Surviviors is that they need to work as a team in order to beat killers. The issue is that the devs never accounted for how the power dynamic would shift if Surviviors had access to voice communications. Bc of this, we see SWF usually get the better of killers and only the genuinely overpowered killers (Spirit, Billy, Nurse, etc) stand a chance against them. 
---
This is an asymmetrical game, the idea of 4 randos darting around the map not having any sense of communication was a mistake to ever think of as a good design philosophy, it literally paints the game as "the killer should easily kill all 4 Surviviors". This had bred a sense of entitlement amongst killer mains and this belief that anything short of a 4k is a loss for them. BHVR never balanced this game around the idea of coordinated teams against killers. SWF was problematic to bring in, but would cripple their game to remove. They'd lose most/all of their base if they removed SWF
---
Thats exactly what I am doing but it doesnt matter since nobody cleanse and they are sick anyway. The Big downside is: Dead hard is meta and it extends the chase. But I will keep trying
---
I have quite a bit of playtime in this game and it is the only one I play.  I know you are just talking shit but I actually do know what I'm doing in this game.  I've always made a point to main the weakest killers (Freddy, Trapper, Wraith, Legion, etc...) which makes me feel better prepared when I go up against swf groups.  It always cracks me up when someone is this incredulous over entertaining the notion that it's actually possible to play games without NOED.  Speaks volumes about your personal killer play.
---
3 of the 4 survivors just came out of there. That‚Äôs the right play if he knows they are there.
---
i was in fact wearing prescription glasses under the mask. It had enough room to not be uncomfortible
---
Reminds me of the time I wasn't playing much killer because of the wait times this season. So I played at like rank 11 and some dude said I had a lag switch and said I should jump off a bridge just like Etika...(my name was RIP Etika because he was confirmed dead that same day)
---
Ignore the downvotes. These are obviously all the bad freddy mains who asked for the rework in the first place.
---
bummer. sorry my man
---
1. No. If ur in range to perform an action that would stand ur model up and the trap is in the interaction zone, the trap will not trigger. 
---
2. They fixed the basement stairs not being wide enough to get around a bodyblocking killer. 
---
3. Don't focus on dailies too much. Bloodpoints will come, just play the game.
---
Yes! It‚Äôs the last one that shows too :)
---
Once i saw someone on stream float 10 meters up after ds-ing a trapper
---
I don't think they're that hard either. It's just about the perk.
---
Dwight knows what's good.
---
Jeez take a joke. Ik its a beta what do you think how am I playing the game?
---
Usually yes. If all 5 people bring an offering, the killer‚Äôs is always last.
---
Eh when all of them are nearby and not doing gens it's a good strat. It's when most of them leave your in trouble
---
I just said it is not toxic. To be fair, slugging is more toxic and annoying than DS
---
That's the thing though, there are a lot of survivor perks that have to do with reading friendly auras and otherwise help with communication, but survivors in voice comms don't need to waste perk slots on those because they can tell their friends where they are and what they're doing from anywhere on the map. It also completely defeats he purpose of stealth killers because they'll always have at least one member looking around for them so that they all know where the killer is going. At the very least, killers should get some kind of point bonus if the survivors are queued up together, not enough to give them a big win every swf game, but enough to negate the whole "Hey, you can't surprise us because we're literally talking to each other like our characters are carrying cell phones" aspect of swf.
---
Ok, if you can add me as soon as possible so i don't forget XD
---
That's so annoying
---
Wym? There's always been an invisible force field that people can hit through but not walk through in auto haven.
---
It wasn‚Äôt really a nerf in my opinion,138 metres is basically infinite considering most maps are on average that size.
---
Remember when survivors actually ran Saboteur and did something else than only generators? Made killers have to run iron grasp.
---
Taking your suggestion now.
---
Oh I seen something just like that! :O
---
It's so funny! ahah
---
While you're right, it still doesnt explain it. I'll never understand some of Behaviors choices
---
I‚Äôm sorry! I forgot my guitar gal!
---
The trapper just looked at him for a good 10 sec after that
---
Nice cherrypick of the comment .  Him setting up traps is fine .  Patrolling the building with traps set up is camping . He doesn‚Äôt need to patrol the building if he set traps up .....
---
Or we can nerf the much needed gen progress for survivors. Or make it harder to find a hex totum
---
You‚Äôre wrong, it‚Äôs a Jigglypuff seen from above!
---
Implying that cleansing totems doesn‚Äôt require a special condition of trusting randos to follow along as well
---
I‚Äôm not mad, preschool is pretty busted. Literally 4 strong as hell buildings (shack, 2 houses, the preschool). The entire map is just safe as fuck.
---
Trapper was like "Mother of God!"
---
Some players are just better rabbits than others. I'd rather chase someone I have a chance at getting rather than get pallet t-bagged by the SWF twink.
---
were you playing as nea? thats probably why
---
Honestly a wounded Bill is louder than the Pale Rose foghorn
---
Finally, someone who speaks the truth. Let my brother run free.
---
If the devs nerf Spirit I stop playing this game, at least. I'm tired of being just a toy for survivors when I play killer
---
Hrmm I missed that he sleeps on hit. Was that in the dev stream?  That'd solve a good number of issues I have with the new kit honestly.
---
You make good points about his port working well with the anti-gen perks, but with the high base cool down I'm not as certain that it'll be as effective as one might think. The question is once we're in game will people be sleeping often enough to make our snares/pallets reliable and our port cool down minimal.
---
I think you should give it another try. The abilities are rarely game changing and its more about gunplay than anything else IMO
---
* generator takes 80 seconds without toolboxes or perks
---
* chase (including time to find a survivor and time to hook a survivor) can easily take 80 seconds
---
* 3 survivors can do gens while 1 survivor is chased
---
* 3 gens can be done in the time it takes to hook 1 survivor
---
* survivors do 60% of their objective in the time it takes killer to do 8% of their objective
---
* bhvr wonders why ruin is mandatory
---
* bhvr wonders why newer killers camp
---
* bhvr wonders why killers dodge lobbies with toolboxes
---
* bhvr wonders why adrenaline is so strong
---
* bhvr wonders why noed is so strong
---
Well change your caption then. The caption makes it seem like tbagging was the problem
---
Are you a high rank? Maybe he‚Äôs playing against new people too
---
Does my hand taste like ass to you?
---
Every game for me as nurse (console) usually involves all 4 survivors running around in circles around me teabagging and flashlight spamming. The only thing that keeps me sane is knowing I have NOED and that at least one of them will regret being so toxic at the end of the game. Their team mates usually bail at this point. I rarely pip but it does give you some satisfaction. The only killer I will use NOED unapologetically on because of the toxic survivors I get every game. I'm not a good nurse at all, but don't mess me around.
---
Can I share ur gameplay on a facebook group? I'll give ya the credits.
---
Yeah, I was about to say the same. Most posts are salty people complaining when the average rank difference is like 1-2. This is a 5.5 rank difference on the average. That's pretty huge.
---
Yeah, I thought it was gonna be clear but I guess not. My bad.
---
That'd be pretty cool! I know the devs are super on board with secondary objectives as a game-slower (Freddy rework, Plague's whole kit, Pig's traps, those cantankerous thingys) but a full separate mandatory phase would really help the killers that don't have the same types of pressure. 
---
My idea would be a gas can or a battery that you have to install into an exit gate before starting to open it that spawns at the generator(s) furthest from both gates. Sort of how like even though Corrupt Intervention doesn't slow down gen progress very much, it forces survivors to have to move which gives the killer an opportunity to find them without having to just circle around gens until you get lucky. It's really hard to effectively pressure the gates as they are now. Having the survivors have to safely bring an item across the map would certainly help give some killers that are more prone to getting to end game (Trapper, hag, wraith, most of the m1 bois) keep having a fighting chance instead of seeing the last gen pop and be like "oh theres still 4 people alive? Guess i get no kills this game."
---
Yeah but while it is completely cosmetic, it still takes forever to unlock anything. I enjoyed the game initially but was eventually put off by how grindy the game felt just to unlock something.
---
I love them!
---
I thought the game had a lot of safe pallets and it has a few spots to use bl. How is it bad for survivors unless it's nurse or spirit
---
very very accurate
---
The problem is with SWF, if you make adjustments to control highly coordinated teams, it's going to crush solo queue.
---
I've heard it proposed to have a que for swf and one for solo so killers and choose, but sure how well that would work as far as getting matches and lobby times.
---
Lol that face
---
My man! Thanks for taking my request. Shit is so cute
---
Maybe hes just lonely ü§£
---
But wait there is already one map like that!
---
Just yesterday I died my first flash light save after about 2 years of playing :D
---
"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man!"
---
Nurse is BS any way, but they are rare on console so I don‚Äôt have to worry.
---
Claudette's scream is pretty bad.
---
no he was just literally saying hi to them, what other reason would Mathieu have to say hi to netflix about a collab between Behavior and Netflix than it being a Dead by Daylight related collaboration? Since Mathieu is only really working on DBD most of the time.
---
Tell her thank you very much

---
I just hate that double pallet that spawns downstairs occasionally. Like this loop is strong enough even after the pallets are broken did you really need to add a second pallet spawn
---
Man, Kreig's new skin looks pretty awesome
---
It's assumed we're going to get some licensed cosmetics for bill or the l4d series because people think valve wouldn't just allow bill to go to console without a price, so I hope we get something
---
No. He said "complain about Noed and want a nerf = you are bad" and I just said that a lot of killers complain about the half part of the things in the game and want all these things to get nerfed, now he can get his conclusions. I'm not judging what is wrong and what is right.
---
95% of the people I see complaining about the new Freddy rework don't actually have anything constructive to say about new Freddy versus old Freddy. All they're doing is complaining about the fact that Freddy doesn't have literal map hacks anymore.
---
I'm going to be 100% honest with you: the reason Freddy is being reworked is specifically because of people like you. The reason Freddy was *nerfed* is specifically because of people like you. Freddy's tracking ability is overpowered; there's no beating around the bush with that. The reason that it's allowed to exist in the game in its current state for so long is because Freddy is absolutely dog shit at chasing which "balances out" the fact that he can find you instantly.
---
Freddy is extremely unhealthy for the game. It's not fun for the Survivors to have a Killer they literally can't avoid, and it's not fun for the Killer to wait 7 seconds before they can do anything.
---
The things you are complaining about being removed are being removed because they are Nurse levels of overpowered, and the only reason that they were allowed to stay in the game is because they were attached to a Killer who was 10 times worse then Leatherface or Wraith could ever be.
---
Having a character be really good at one thing and one thing alone is no way to balance a character.
---
Auras are better, but totems are still hard to see sometimes. Also forget about seeing scratches
---
As a Kate main and a GF fan, I'm so happy for this quality stuff. Good job!
---
Some YouTuber has an opinion that differed from most others so he's full of bullshit. 
---
Who cares? Maybe he's better with Clown than Spirit. 
---
I know a lot of people have Wraith in the bottom tier but I play him way better than the complaints I hear about
---
This is more-so directed at Freddy's aura reading because BBQ has counters now. (Going into a locker.) Freddy's aura reading you're essentially forced into dealing with unless you want to play Dwight Simulator and hide in a locker all game.
---
If you used ranged addons then you never had to "wait" before hitting a survivor.
---
This new Freddy is a new since his power(s) depends on survivors making mistakes.
---
So rip low ranks survivors and rip high Rank Freddy players.
---
What's funny is my que as killer takes ages and never gets me paired(rank 8 killer atm) like this but my que as survivor is 2 seconds  and I sometimes get games where everyone is rank 20 or everyone is rank 5+ (I'm a rank 9 survivor)
---
As a main killer, I agree with u about the survivor auras on gens, It's really a OP bug.
---
But the infinite mending was fixed fast, they actually fix things fast, but the auras thing should be fixed already, maybe it will be fixed on this new update.
---
I use his addon black box making me odsessed with one survivor and they start the game in the dream state I immediately go get them and because I‚Äôm not garbage it doesn‚Äôt take long to down them however more often then not survivors spawn together or close by and I pull all the survivors close to my obsession into the dream state to which only takes 2 seconds thanks to red paint brush. However if I missed any while I hook my obsession thanks to barbecue and chili I will know where they are if they are outside of 40 meters. if they aren‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt see them that means they are near by so hence I will remain nearby as well to get them into the dream state as they go for the unhook and pull my obsession back in and hook them again because I want them dead because of dying light. Which makes getting gens done nearly impossible when they are in the dream state forcing people to find one another to wake themselves up or fail a skill check hurting their gen progress even more however more often then not they just try to find each other. Which I look out for and when I see two peoples heading for each other or getting close I will go and attempt to down them both which is relatively easy since my terror radius is also tremendously reduced thanks to red paint brush and more often then not I get the drop on them since I can predict where they are going since I see their auras by this point I will have either 2 on the hook with a 3rd either dying on the hook or being saved by the only other person up and moving. Which means I have a good estimate of where the last 2 are if they pulled off the save and I will head in that general direction or follow the person who unhooked if they are in the dream state. If they don‚Äôt go for the save and let my obsession die that means they will be coming to try and unhook 1 of the 2 on hook which means I just have to stay in the general area again. So on and so forth so that from there it‚Äôs all relatively down hill for them oh also I have haunted ground which I will let them cleanse if I see them in the dream state and wait to down them right after they cleanse it if they aren‚Äôt in the dream state oh well it still benefits me since I will have someone in the dream state to hunt down. Along with with devour hope Incase things aren‚Äôt going my way. With all that and the way I play leads to a very quick game.
---
Nope. The 10% Try hards between rank 1-5 don't make up the majority of the game
---
They are always coming when I can‚Äòt play
---
Nice reading comprehension. I wasn‚Äôt alluding to the physical traps. He set a ‚Äútrap‚Äù knowing they‚Äôd come. But I suppose you think he should go to the other side of the map so they all get away happy and free!
---
Try out whispers. It's a bit of an underated perk. It will tell you where survivors are and where they aren't.
---
I have 14 characters. I told Siri pick a number from 1 - 14 she picked two so I‚Äôm playing meg for a while
---
I'm a survivor main (rank 9). I've only played against freddy twice and both times all 4 escaped. I looked at  Freddy's powers and it seems really underpowered. Survivors have to be asleep and then you still have to 2-shot them?
---
I've only been playing for two weeks, so maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.
---
Willdo. I'll keep an eye out in the blood web
---
This, I cannot understand why survivors can‚Äôt get this through their skulls
---
Good or bad lol
---
Congrats! Soon enough you will be in the red! Good luck!
---
Its very small though and pallets dont matter for killers like nurse. There are a few safe pallets but I wouldnt say there are any more then maps like Blood Lodge and Gas haven.
---
If you are playing a mid tier killer against a top SWF team and they find ruins early there isn't much you can do. Even top killers like truetalent lose those games.
---
&gt;All survivors not doing gens and trying to save one guy on a hook when the killer can see them
---
"FaCE CamPiNG BaBBy"
---
It's not even that feeling when you are playing killer. Even as survivor I see like 2 people go for the unhook or notice it when I'm nearby then run off to do a gen. It's like "Ya we should save him, but we're making it easier for the killer since we still need 4 gens done"
---
He must be
---
Sometimes I find them at the right corner of the map.  If there is 3 or more gens left and they‚Äôre on death hook I‚Äôll either leave them or down them and leave them. Depends on if they have an item. But they only get one....     Right Peter!?
---
Spine Chill literally counters half the killers in the game and is still good vs the ones it doesn't counter, once it lights up you can start moving and hiding, and if the killer wastes his time looking for you, then he's screwing himself over and has to leave the area to find a new target.
---
Sometimes it can be the connection. Sometimes i'm thrown out of a match randomly
---
If the killer benefits from noed regardless of whether they have it in play or not, then you need to really think about what "high risk" actually means.
---
Map pressure&gt;aura reading
---
Good
---
This would be better if it was ‚ÄúHow could they let me go to phase 2 on the hook‚Äù
---
How did you get so many shards? Do you get more quicker on mobile or something?
---
the long cooldown is only if nobody is asleep, it will only take long the first few times and the last few times assuming you're killing people since dead =/= sleep. 
---
we don't have any numbers yet, and we'll have to wait until tomorrow in the PTB to know for sure. So nobody knows how long microsleep takes or even how much people are put to sleep every time Freddy hits them. The way I see a gen teleport mainly working is once you're done with a chase, with a couple gen tracking perks thrown in, or just knowledge of knowing which gens are getting done you use the ability to go there quickly, doesn't seem like an ability you really want to spam in the first place, and it's main use is just to find the next survivor asap.
---
I'm assuming he'll have add-ons that will tweak the cooldown, or affect how fast/slow survivors fall asleep. They already mentioned add-ons that make the dream snares apply debuffs and his gen teleport making all gens spurt blood to confuse the survivors.
---
also they never mentioned it in the stream but it was shown in a clip of Freddy hitting Nea and her instantly falling asleep. Watch on their stream [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypdDN388Xg) around the 18:50 mark. I'm pretty sure they said in a post somewhere too but I'm not sure where to find it.
---
I mean, once on the hook they already just sit there with a blank expression anyway
---
Can do
---
Dude you don‚Äôt have to defend yourself. You made an awesome play. Play by your own rules not what others say you should do.
---
I went out of my way to record before that moment for you. I‚Äôm pretty nice when it comes to camping and tunneling players. (https://imgur.com/gallery/vmg5k2R)
---
I love how you advised we stop with the assumptions when you clearly assumed dude was camping and he wrecked that with a video from moments prior. Also I really can‚Äôt stress this enough but idc what your rank is. People can‚Äôt scream ranks don‚Äôt matter and then try to use their rank to validate what they say. At the end of the day the killers job is to get kills and I‚Äôd say this guy did that.
---
Congrats! I love playing against the pig üê∑ just hit rank 15 myself
---
You don't move much faster and the stun means it's better to just walk everywhere.
---
Literally survivors who don‚Äôt take hits after farming somebody are the most annoying teammates to have
---
Because people have friends and every game is ranked. BHVR can‚Äôt do spilt queue (ranked and casual) because queue times are already super long. High rank killers would have a super hard time finding a game. There‚Äôs already no incentive to be rank 1 already. So why would you rank up and be unable to play with your friends. Also SWF is a needed evil, as choosing not to queue against SWF would make queue times WAAAAAYYYY linger on both sides. So BHVR averages out the ranks. Not saying it‚Äôs right. But it‚Äôs how things have to be at the moment
---
I can't get over Jake sounding like a dying whale.
---
Watched your other clip yea you totally weren‚Äôt camping lol
---
Notice how my traps weren‚Äôt right on the stairs? And I was leaving the building alone until I got that notification. If I didn‚Äôt get that notification I was going to try to chase down that meg.
---
&gt; 3 survivors can do gens while 1 survivor is chased
---
I desperately want to play a game like that. I'm used to all 3 of them crouching around the hook when the killer is on the other side of the map, or searching chests/self caring while I have only a few seconds left.
---
The Freddy we have ATM is like a double sided coin. As a survivor the aura reading is hell if you can't find someone or can't get a skill check, but on the other hand the actual part where you have to purposefully blow a gen or fail a skill check or just in general do something that tells the killer where you are or something is pretty cool. The aura reading is definitely the part that makes it annoying to go against, ESPECIALLY if (usually all the time) the Freddy is using Monitor and Abuse.
---
With the new Freddy I'm super happy about because even though the aura reading was fun to use, I know it wasn't entirely fair. The fact you can now have a trap to slow survivors and you can mind game with a gen teleport is making me consider maining Freddy after the rework is live. The fake Pallets on the other hand, idk how well it will be useful since good survivors keep track of pallets.
---
It's not that I dont want to I just think as of currently right now it's a waste of time. And noed is just a cheap crutch for bad killers. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hex Ruin! Comes with the Hag! 
---
Other good gen perks would be Thrilling Tremors (Ghost Face) and Pop the Weasel (I think the Clown?) 
---
Overcharge is decent too! (The Doctor)
---
What is ‚Äúslugging‚Äù, because I‚Äôve been accused of slugging while playing ghostface
---
Oh wow okay! Thats nice.
---
4K all day baby , that was a 75K bp match ;))
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dead perk‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm a high ranking killer and even when they get ruin first majority of the games they‚Äôll do the haunted grounds totem and I‚Äôll get 1-2 downs.
---
Being Salty over such a Post is just salty itself.
---
The game is balanced around survivors getting no communication. Communication is a big advantage for survivors which is easily worth 2 perks at least. So when you face a SWF, of course its much harder.
---
Coordinated players =/= SWF
---
probably not for Freddy :P I would love to see some Laurie cosmetics though..
---
She is afraid if clowns, that may not happen...
---
1) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_ypdDN388Xg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypdDN388Xg)
---
2) Most dailies aren't to hard it depends on how good you are with the Killer or Survivor in most cases and how leveled and perked up they are. I only hate the Mori daily where you have to kill a survivor by your own hand because it's killer specific and you don't always carry a mori for that killer.
---
3) Myers is always a strong killer even without add-ons or offerings.
---
Nice! Well done
---
This me trying to convince my friends to play apex I stead of battlefield
---
I stopped using it in exchange for perks like borrowed time ... I figure if I‚Äôm good enough in a chase / being stealth I won‚Äôt get hooked and I‚Äôll get more bloodpoints rescuing someone instead. Kindred is for people who don‚Äôt have trust in their team or themselves.
---
Slugging is when you down a survivor and don't pick them up. You just let them bleed out.
---
More popular than DBD at the very least. I loive DBD but it seems to have a niche player base.
---
I mean I thought the tweet was obvious proof that DBD and Netflix were coming together. I was wondering if that meant Stranger things or not.
---
im starting to use Kate.... Ash is too damn loud when injured
---
Thanks, seems like Freddy will just become an overall much better killer, maybe low high tier, or high mid tier.
---
Some people are disappointed with the rework because they spent a very long time practicing with a killer everyone else said was weak because they like how it felt to play them. They could have gone down a different path and kept his core identity while changing his ability so it doesn't encourage tunneling as much and having him be able to keep more survivors in the dream world for a longer period of time, instead of changing him into a completely different killer, but they didn't, and some people are sad about that. I'm sad too, I really liked old Freddy, but I'm also excited to try out the new one. 
---
Also, Freddy's tracking was never super overpowered. It is certainly stronger than the Doctor's tracking while the survivor is in the dream state, but unlike the Doctor, Freddy actually has to find survivors first before he can start tracking them, takes longer to start tracking them do due to the transition, has more difficulty tracking multiple survivors at the same time, and survivors can break his tracking much more easily.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôve been accused of it more than once but I usually down someone and then go down someone else then hook both so idk
---
what a cutie
---
I also thought this was rendered in a program. Wow.
---
Why should I pay for something that even MatK thinks is no benefit to the players? It would only be a slippery slope if it passed.
---
At least you can unlock free lootboxes. DBD you can only buy cosmetics. Honestly, DBD is the worst game i have ever played in terms of free skins.
---
i have the claudette face and the p3... need to kill those other 3
---
i thought at first you were talking about the Jigsaw Piece and i wanted to ask you if you were ok lmao
---
I am. I did not buy it is the gray part
---
Okay I‚Äôm gonna just come out and ask, what‚Äôs p3?
---
1: What is a rough estimate of bps to level a survivor up to level 30? Im trying to get the iron will teachable.
---
2: What about level 50?
---
3: Do you yourself have to open the hatch to get the "Ware did they go" achievement?
---
4: Are higher tier perks on the shrine of secrets less than lower tier perks?
---
5: What is the fastest way to complete a gen
---
You would have to pay for anything, but some people would want to. And it would absolutely benefit the player. More income from the game, more people they can staff on the OSRS team. Tired of this "slippery slope" excuse for being afraid of the past repeating itself... No one at Jagex wants P2W for OSRS.
---
Tell me all the nicknames, I'll share it on a facebook group.
---
Love it üòÅ good job and keep it up!
---
Killer needs to control the map. If survivors control the map, you have failed. As they pop generators you gotta try and get that pressure in once they have less to work with. But keep in mind that as the killer there are matches you can not win. Either survivor, killer type, map type, or map spawns. Just do your best.
---
i know hun, i know, i was just confused for a bit
---
Even blinded they can still hit you
---
It‚Äôs actually in the killer‚Äôs favor nowadays if the survivor who rescues takes a hit for the survivor who was just unhooked. Nowadays, it actually severely hurts killers to hit the survivor who was just unhooked considering borrowed time and decisive strike. Personally, I love when the unhooker runs straight to me to give me a head start on a new chase
---
Really now? :0 If they do more than just these three then I might definitely collect them all. I do have a shelf with the Trapper mask already and I have the room so maybe, hmmm. What about you? Are you planning on getting all of them or just faves? :)
---
The solution is very simple, also give communication to the random groups and then buff Killer to balance things out. But every times something like this is suggested everyone whines so BHVR can't implement that.
---
Same reasons as you. Dead by Daylight is a gimmick game that was supposed to die within a year, yet they managed to turn it into a competitive time-sink of a game, and I love it.
---
&gt; the community in this game is sincerely awesome
---
should we tell them?
---
S. A. M. E.
---
Same
---
Only as OP as they are good, which most are not
---
Even better, "Dead Hard On"
---
i don't enjoy this game üëÄ
---
yet i still keep coming back to it so that means that the game is doing SOMETHING right to keep me coming back but i have no idea what that something is, i DO enjoy this game but at the same time it pisses me off endlessly, i just don't know what it is
---
Killer running PWYF/STBFL: "I'm gonna pretend I didn't see anything"
---
Fair point, i do admit survivors will still do haunted ground totem an absurd high % of the time even after ruins lol
---
So when I begin to heal someone hit LB or L1 because I‚Äôm on ps4.
---
In what region do you need to be to download the app?
---
I have never seen this show, but just the fact this kid is living a real life DND game and just wants to go back too fake DND, is a total mood.
---
I try not to follow one survivor for too long, I know how that works. If I know I won‚Äôt catch someone I just walk the other way and patrol gens
---
it depends. Against a high map control killer you should prefer working on gen as a team to confirm a full repair to put pressure on the killer. Or it's the killer that will control the map 'cause of BBQ on his power.
---
It sounds like you need to not play the game for mass amount of hours and take more breaks then.
---
hmmm
---
 what console u on?
---
Ghostface is what drove me to main killers in general. I just got to red ranks for the first time ever in this game and it‚Äôs been..frustrating but super fun.
---
I‚Äôm still surprised to get rank 2-4 SWF who make forehead plays
---
That‚Äôs a different story. But they always camp and tunnel  just because I exposed them like wow
---
nah, it's not that big of a deal
---
3 survivors on one gen each only sounds like a good idea when you only need one gen left. That way it‚Äôs an insta win.
---
Just finished a game where the survivors were having a ball in the chat after and it was so nice to have everyone just enjoy the game :)
---
I don't get how people say it's not useful :/ 
---
Her ability is, without cleansing, loud survivors and permanent exposed.
---
ATM out of those I would prefer just Wraith since he's the first killer I played when the game was in it's early stages. Also his design is more interesting imo. Trapper is cool but to me he's very basic but distinct, the Hillbilly's deformed face is cool but besides that there isn't much besides the chainsaw and mallet. Wraith is very cool looking since he has this muddy skin, the long cloak, the glowing eyes, the sticks coming out of him, his tall slender look with that very up right and unnatural stance, and the weapon being a creation from the lore where it's the auto haven owner's skull and spine made into a weapon. Wraith is more interesting as a statue. 
---
For me when I get a figure it has to be something distinct and fun to examine from time to time.
---
I think of the two near bathroom, the one above bathroom in terms of safe pallete. Besides that majority of the pallets I can think of are ones near stairs in which it's pretty easy to mind game them
---
Made me lol
---
salty messages from bad survivors
---
You know I totally agree we should get a free skin once in a while and I get the free loot box appeal, but I am really happy they have a page dedicated too skin buying, so I don‚Äôt have too spend 4.99 too get a chance of getting the skin I want.
---
no you're delusional. Survivors get completely rekt by inexperienced killers at low-mid ranks. 
---
The only think that can save them from time to time is a lost very experienced survivor that will carry the game.
---
The game is definitely not balance around bad survivors.
---
Why not have both? BBQ N Chili, and Nurse' Calling ;)
---
The correct definition of this game‚Äôs tunneling is focusing all your attention on one survivor, regardless of your position in the game as a killer. Refusing to chase and hook other people, refusing to stop other generators being worked on or doing anything other than getting one person down and out. 
---
It‚Äôs is more commonly referred to when a survivor gets chased by a killer by running into them or being unhooked unsafely by a teammate, but that‚Äôs ignorable. As a killer you obviously want to down and hook and kill the survivors, however recognizing how much time you‚Äôre spending on one person vs the other three is very important and spending 2-3 gens chasing one person is never a good idea.
---
I just think that, at his core, old Freddy was very unhealthy for the game as a whole. There was no way they could've buffed his old kit without making him massively overpowered.
---
Would I have prefered old Freddy to stay along with new Freddy? Honestly no, because again he's extremely unfun to play against.
---
(1) Not that I'm aware of
---
(2) Do the dailies: Complete three gens
---
Sacrifice two survivors as "X",
---
Uncloke and hit a survivor 4 times
---
Teleport and hit a survivor 4 times as hag
---
Heal survivors 3 states
---
(3) Michael is bumpy at first but I got used to him after around 3 games and his add-ons arn't a nessatie so if you don't like it you won't lose many bps
---
Kinda looks like Mcote.
---
Prestige 3. Leveling a character to 50 three times for their bloody cosmetics.
---
Nobody cares.
---
YES! I‚Äôve gotten some absolutely insane ones before, I had a guy tell me to ‚Äúenjoy extended wait times..blocked‚Äù as if he represents a significant enough portion of the player base to impact my wait times üòÇ
---
What is p3 and what is SWF
---
Survivors really aren‚Äôt that loud.  The stink cloud will give you away before the noise would.  And okay.  Think this. 
---
You have been hit by the vomit. 
---
Now they have to chase you and hit you once,   If you‚Äôre good enough at the game.  You won‚Äôt be hit.  
---
You go and cleanse yourself. 
---
Now not only does she know exactly where you are. 
---
But now she can attack you from SERIOUS RANGE, and her vomit can hit you up to around 4 times.  Meaning you‚Äôve just been insta downed from 10 feet away.   Where as if you have 4 smart survivors.  You‚Äôll probably never see anybody get hooked.
---
Yes. PWYF will give you bonus movement speed in all cases.
---
Well the name explains a lot, but I‚Äôm not trying to complain I‚Äôm just stating a pattern that I‚Äôve seen with Ghostface players
---
*Insert maybe you should play a different game developer meme here*
---
I feel it, there are definite matches that go super poorly and make me question my love for this game üòÇ
---
Thanks, I am not very confident in my voice so this makes me happy : )
---
So there is a killer who can Teleport to generators and give passive debuff with doing nothing?
---
How is that less interesting then just a passive power that you litteely so very little at all.
---
From what I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs when the killer goes after you right after you got off the hook. Despite there being other survivor(s) they could attack, they ignore them and go after you til your last hook.  And I mean like you JUST got unhooked and the killer comes and ignores the survivors running in front of them and goes for you.
---
Literally. Nobody cares.
---
Ah.  I see you have intellect too,   I see a lot of killer mains complain about the new DS and I brought up just slugging them for a min if you feel like they have it. (Because apparently just taking the DS so you know they don‚Äôt have it anymore is out of the question). But oh Lordy no. Everyone seemed to really hate that idea üòÇ
---
This is not an appropriate time to masturbate, Goblin
---
There is a YouTube and streamer named OhTofu who occasionally puts up videos about running loops and managing time and tiles effectively who is relatively unbiased sometimes and at the  dry least is informative.
---
Then why take the time to comment aren‚Äôt you contradicting yourself?
---
Sauce?
---
Haha me too, sometimes they just overun everything so why not just a little sweety kill
---
Aren't we still waiting on the Pig cosmetics?
---
Really. Nobody cares.
---
I think it makes sense to warn people that the killer is there by waving and struggling, like ‚Äústay back, you don‚Äôt want any part of this.‚Äù But either interpretation makes sense, unfortunately
---
I‚Äôm a killer main. Killer does not need anymore buffs. Killer is powerful as is.
---
P3 is prestige 3 and swf is survive with friends
---
Pallets dont matter for nurse on ANY map. Doesn‚Äôt make it any better for the killers that do care about them.
---
A mix of the atmosphere (i always loved horror movies), and the competitive aspect of the game.
---
That's at least two survivors not doing gens.
---
Prestige rank 3. Meaning they have all the bloody cosmetics
---
Everything a killer does is toxic behavior according to this community. Look if dude was camping and had traps all around him or some shit I‚Äôd agree with you. But that‚Äôs not what happened here. And you‚Äôre not gonna like to hear this but sometimes camping an area is the right play. Hell even a 3 gen strat is a glorified proxy camp. Sidenote, some people don‚Äôt care what works in the top ranks because they play this GAME for fun. If I cared about what worked in top ranks I wouldn‚Äôt play half of the killers I enjoy using
---
You should put this on your epitaph.
---
Also, I never said I rely on noed, I simply don't think anything is wrong with it. Boohoo you got exposed, cleanse totems.
---
Just do the fortnite thing, console players are against console players unless theyre queuing with a PC player, then they would be against PC players.
---
Almost every survivor has perks that are worth getting for your main survivor. If Nea is going to be your main girl, focus on getting her to 50 just so you can at least have a decent chunk of perks to play with. For the other survivors, slowly but steadily level a few up to 40 for their teachable perks. Notably, David King, Jane Romero, Bill Overbeck(if you‚Äôre on pc), Dwight Fairfield, and Meg Thomas. While all survivor perks are nice, there characters specifically  have at least 1-2 perks that are going to much more useful in aiding your survival than the others.
---
I've luckily never had it happen while I was that far away, I know ping can also play into a hitbox's consistency and that can make hits look and feel like shit too. The game with the Bubba I wasn't super far away like you were in that video, but I also wasn't right up against the window for him to be able to get that hit.
---
I don't play killer very often but I've had games not give me hits that should of very well of gotten a hit off on a survivor (like them just starting their window or pallet vault) and then other games I've had give me pity hits because the survivor was already through and starting their run away from the vaulting spot and I get the hit. It makes it unfair for survivors, but also makes it really cheap for killers and honestly ruins the fun of playing killer imo.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with slugging, it‚Äôs a strategy, people just get mad when you don‚Äôt hook them right away
---
Maybe not stoping but oh boy the pain
---
Looks like two kids wanting to buy adults tickets for a movie
---
You are having an easy time winning against red rank SWF teams using a mid tier killer? I call bullshit. Even truetalent lose most of these games.
---
That is why ,IMO, League of Legends has the best model. You can buy a skin outright or a lootbox. ALL of the champions can be purchased for free in game currency, and the devs shower the players in ways to get free cosmetics.
---
Now you're just being kind of a douche but this conversation has obviously run its course anyways.  Enjoy your incredibly skillful downs my man.  See you in the fog.
---
How about.... Not cleansing at all because I enjoy being able to loop the killer and survive longer without giving the killer loop ending insta downs like a noob would do.
---
What do you consider losing? Also I play spirit with no ruin. Yes spirit is top tier but I don‚Äôt use ruin or any gen slows for that matter. To me winning is getting 2 kills.
---
Nea looks pretty happy to see him.
---
He wants that ghost D.
---
Just a salty killer who made the nonsensical decision to tunnel a survivor for 4 gens.  If you're going to display that type of horrible decision making and time management you deserve to lose.
---
What about soildarity and no mither lol
---
Miss Piggy &lt;3
---
I have a relatively wide swath of friends to play with, all of them play overwatch, R6S, or some single player game.  Boring af.  Overwatch got stale for me a long time ago, and I hate FPS games where skill is all about twitch firing.
---
I get any map offering that appears of possible because I like to ask the other survivors what map they'd like to go to.
---
If I get no response, *selects jigsaw piece* "Cowabunga it is"
---
Idk why you're so bent out of shape. Typical to dish it but can't take it then back out of the conversation.
---
Just wanted to see your skill in action because you talk alot of big game. Oh well, not surprising coming from this sub.
---
Yeah but I'm not good though lol
---
Is she alerted when people use fountains? I didn't know she saw that. Also didn't know you could get hit more than one damage state in one puke.
---
I never understood why this definition has changed to "come save me". You don't call the police to tell them you are okay and you don't turn on a fire alarm to tell everyone "there is no fire, so come right in". 
---
If people use this to inform others they are safe, then for cases where you are camped (ie. there is danger), you are screwed with no way to alert anyone.
---
That doesnt work without selfcare i guess
---
Now that I think about it...yeah lol
---
&gt; What do you consider losing? 
---
Not pipping (safety pip)
---
Spirit is top tier but i wouldn't call her broken. she's ok compared with Nurse.
---
&gt; To me winning is getting 2 kills.
---
Depends if you pip or not imo.

I was told to start a youtube because of my skill once. But it was during rank reset and I just got done mulching the trial with survivor skin. Took it as a compliment.

Does it? I must know... I don't have the perk on my guys and I use Jeff's distortion but you only get 3 tokens

For people who played L4D growing up the update is hype af, but for people who don't even know who Bill is the update is just bonus grinding for an old man they've never heard of so I understand their annoyance.

I agree, if I down someone who was just unhooked, I just slug them. I run Sloppy and Thanto too so it really is in my best interest to stab every healthy survivor I see.
---
Baby killer

I also had problems with emulators, tried to install DbD on 3 different emulators in 2 different ways for 2/3 of the emulators and it didn't work no matter what I did.  
---
I'm hoping when it's out of beta I can run it on an emulator because my phone isn't strong enough (minimum of 6s and I have a 6 :) ), but I wouldn't be surprised if they had anti-emulator stuff to prevent people from abusing Nurse/Huntress with PC controls on mobile :T
---
Nice generalizations  but it goes both ways . Camping is only effective if the the generators are done or if you see people around the hooked person ..... nothing else.  People that play the game for fun also care about improving  .  If you don‚Äôt then that‚Äôs weird you would be on a DBD sub reddit .
---
I promise you. No one cares.
---
Nah, mobile homes.
---
I'm rank 4 right now. Feel free to tell me I got there using the method you just described. I'll wait.
---
The reason why Whispers is a powerful perk isn't necessarily because it tells you where survivors are, but more so that it tells you where survivors are not. Whispers is one of the best tools for knowing where on the map to apply pressure are what areas you can ignore. It's also one of the best perks for tracking down immersed survivors once there are only one or two of them left.
---
A lot of the Hag's map pressure comes from the fact that she locks down huge areas of the map, requiring survivors to waste time crouching everywhere or else risk surprise popups. Unless every survivor is running Urban Evasion, simply by virtue of being the Hag you slow the game down by quite a bit.
---
I only stay if I see a survivor sitting and pointing trying to get me to chase them because 99% of the time that means there's one other person waiting for me to chase them. Otherwise I wander off hunting for more chili
---
It makes a special sound and the fountain becomes a white aura
---
She can hit all survivors at once and knocking one or two into the dying state. And yes. It plays a noise that you used one. And then The aura changes colour until she goes and interacts with it.
---
It's when the killer goes after someone who was just unhooked, typically in an effort to knock them out of the game ASAP. It's seen as toxic because there isn't much that survivor can do in those cases and they're just screwed from the get go.
---
AFTER 1 year. First learn English, then complain.
---
Those figures make me think of The Evil Within 2 for some reason.
---
Thank you for reading my idea, I hope you have a good day
---
(I'm not saying that you didn't read my idea, but I think it's very suspicious that you commented in such a small period of time, I posted this post less than 2 minutes before you commented, it's okay anyway, but if my theory is right, I hope you spend some time reading everything instead of just the title, this is just a post from a game but in other situations this can be problematic)
---
Basically ‚Äútunnel vision‚Äù. The killer dials in on just one survivor and makes it a priority to chase them.
---
I too am a terrible squirrel. It just seems like the killers are substantially faster than me when I'm trying to loop pallets.
---
&gt;Plague
---
Legit? I'm thinking about buying her.
---
It really isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs completely dependent on RNG
---
If I get hooked, why do I need to hear that loud ass scream? Makes no sense.
---
i think this ultimately wouldn't change anything. so many people run ruin that survivors 
---
* have learned most totem locations
---
* bring small game
---
* learned to tap generators
---
* honed their timings to hit great skill checks
---
Ruin being so common was really only effective when it wasn't the meta. Now that it is, survivors have taken necessary steps to counteract it. having it on a delayed start wouldn't really change the outcome.
---
Every pallet behind a staircase is safe. The pallet in the pig room drop-down is safe. All of the jungle gym pallets are safe as always (except you can't see through walls), both pallets by the bathroom are safe. Both pallets above the bathroom are safe. Almost every pallet that spawns behind a shelf system near a wall is safe because it spawns on the end of the shelf instead of down the middle, and even then the shelf is so long that it's pretty safe. Every pallet near a door is 100% safe as well. Need I go on?
---
Honestly haven‚Äôt had any issues on mobile other then on Lerys.
---
I thought the dream pull trigger was being replaced with traps
---
Depending on the gates they might get 2 or 3 depending on the killer.
---
I've always wanted to get into DBD, but I've always heard that its not very welcoming for new players, what're people's take on the state of the game and players? How hard/easy is the game to pick up and play? Also If anyone could hit me with any beginner friendly tips or is okay to teach me this game a bit, I would appreciate it.
---
She has add-ons that are actually really effective if people never cleanse. There are ones that let you start with a corrupted pool already, gives you corrupt for free when a gen is complete, and her ultra rare that lets you see the survivor everytime they puke, i.e. stay sick.
---
A smart plague who knows she's going against survivors who don't cleanse 95% of the time, will just make her build around it. At base she makes stealth very difficult and makes everyone 1-hit, playing around the fact that survivors refuse to cleanse makes her even better, throwing on stuff like M&amp;A and Thanataphobia(I know it isn't THAT great but basically having this as a perma debuff does help to an extent). She is far from bad, and can play around both survivors that cleanse a lot and those that don't cleanse at all.
---
200 hours played here. I don't like it anymore. Maybe I'm just burned out on BR in general.... but most of my Apex game I have teammates who leave as soon as they're knocked, and the loot distribution sucks ass too.
---
If I can see 2 people who are both next to an incredibly safe area I'm not going to chase them. That's 3 people not doing gens. I'm in control of that situation.
---
Ahhh I see. Thanks!
---
Thanks, makes sense
---
/s indicates sarcasm
---
...okay, but I meant under which condition should the hatch open.
---
Thank you, i was unaware.
---
Nah, empathy is good for flashlight saves and sabo builds (rare, I know. I still like using it for flashlights though).
---
WGLF is a curse at high ranks.
---
I‚Äôve been farmed out too many times to count.
---
Red ranks are hell, I don't recommend you playing there
---
It's not necessarily super intuitive right away, but it's pretty easy to pick up if you watch a few youtube videos, even just people playing the game (I was first introduced to the game watching Roosterteeth Let's Play videos) and when I finally got the game I thought it was pretty easy to follow. At higher levels there are more strategic elements and "builds" (involving perks, powers, bonuses, etc.) that make it more complex but as far as getting into it it's not too punishing.
---
What? Yes you do. You lose some points towards the pip, but who ares about that.
---
It is! F13 is both of those! But then again, F13 isn't radioactive with toxicity, despite what I went into it thinking.
---
Probably only let voice chat be between Survivors and not to Killers.
---
A Lot of people that play this game are straight up fucking trash and make shit plays either on accident or intentional and it makes it very unsafe to play against her when she has corruption. "don't worry I have borrowed time, bro." 2 downs in 2 seconds........ You can't loop her cause of corrupt and you've probably already been hit at least once by her already anyways which makes the whole "but 1 hit the whole match" a moot point since she can down you from 20m away and over obstacles.
---
There's been tons of times i've been 1 hit for an entire match because scrub ass killers can't break the chase and go after someone easier and I make it out just fine. Being injured doesn't make much of a difference. Being injured against a corrupted plague is kinda bullshit and gives the killer free downs they would never have got if they were playing other killers.
---
4K HD to make up for the 1K camping kill
---
I‚Äôve noticed gen/doors auras are a little bugged too...
---
Certain hair cosmetics will give survivors away.
---
1. Impossible to tell but if around 50k gives you a level past level 10 you can do the calculations on your own.
---
2. Level fifty will take almost twice that. I feel as if once around level 40, the bloodweb doesn‚Äôt expand anymore. It could be more, I rarely take notice.
---
3. Check the achievements description and it‚Äôll tell you everything you need to know, or look it up.
---
4. I believe so.. Some teachables are like 2-3k and some are lower. It‚Äôs been awhile.
---
5. Depends. Rushing at the beginning of the game is an easy way to finish a gen.. If they have ruin you could look for the totem, or you could just tap the gem, or just YOLO it and go through all the way if you want to take the risk.
---
6.  It‚Äôs up to you. If you really want a perk, than play the character you want but use the bloodpoints on then. That‚Äôs what I did.
---
7.  It‚Äôs all up to how well you play in a match and if you follow everything it wants you to do.
---
8. I assume english isn‚Äôt your first language, which is completely okay, but i‚Äôm sorry if I answer your question wrong because I believe you meant to say against.. Well, if anything, nowadays the killer loses time when they camp and you can just gen rush and get out of there but risk losing one survivor.. Though, if one of you have Borrowed time or anything like that, you could cooperatively get him off the hook and make the killer lose precious time.
---
If you have any more questions DM me
---
Yeah, I think the perk is in a very complicated place right now, I don't think any idea will simple solve the problem then, looks like it's a very situational perk and I have no idea how could we fix that, I hope we can come up with something
---
Killers aren't threatening at all in this game, unles it's Spirit or Nurse
---
Someone forgot to turn up their headphones!
---
Auras are somewhat bugged right now. I‚Äôm able to see survivors as they repair gens or run towards people on hook.
---
Can‚Äôt play this game on speakers.
---
Please, don't cleanse vs Plague. All the good survivors don't and when you do, you're fucking them up by giving Plague the Corrupt Purge, which has no counterplay and is extremely strong. So, don't. cleanse.
---
You forgot hatch (I see killers STILL complaining about it), object of obsession, keys, dark clothing, bnp(not even joking), and just basic looping.
---
I‚Äôm mean a this is a very minor bug that not a lot of people know about and it‚Äôs not game breaking like wake up was. Also popular Dbd youtuber Ussylis made a video on it and even explained how to do it and he has been just fine.
---
Maybe. It was saddening though
---
But then your gay value will eventually overflow back into a negative value.
---
Same. It should just be a beam of light going straight up or something.
---
Her backstory is so sad and she only kills people because the entity told her they are reborn forms of her father :(
---
The only weird thing to me is the survivor screams are shorter on their side then the killer side. I‚Äôd say make the survivor side match the killer side or make the killer side screams shorter to match the survivors.
---
My friends were dumb and bought Friday the 13th and now
---
don‚Äôt even touch it
---
I struggle with P, it's a rare key in videogames, so, idc if it breaks
---
1: Roughly 500k-650k can get you to 30 as long as you spend cheap and smart. 
---
2: About 1.2m will get you from 1-50 following the same rules. 
---
3: No. As long as the hatch is open and all 4 jump in, everyone gets it. 
---
4: The shrine is ‚Äúrandom‚Äù in the sense that some perks show up a LOT more than others do. 
---
5: The fastest way to finish a gen is with the Purple Toolbox (not Alex‚Äôs‚Äù toolbox) with A Brand New Part And Socket Swivels, Run Prove Thyself And have one person on the gen with you with the same toolbox. Implying you both hit your skillchecks for BNP and no skillchecks appeared, you both with be done is less than 20 seconds. 
---
6: Pick one survivor to be your main. Level up everyone else to 40 and keep them there. 
---
7: Gold Unbroken is never being hooked or escaping despite being hooked once. Iridicent Unbroken is never being hit. 
---
8: Borrowed Time and Body Block. Bring an insta heal as long as it isn‚Äôt Leatherface and pray your hooked friend has Decisive.
---
I bought Legion but Spirit is who I am going for next
---
i feel like that's a good summation of the situation.
---
cheers!
---
That's mysterious. It could just be a coincidence, or it could be something about playing Survivor-side vs. Killer-side. If you're solo, you aren't encountering any full SWF lobbies, for example.
---
I also don't know how Killer toxicity scales, although I've presumed the inverse, as toxic Killer behaviour usually costs efficiency, and Killers are only stronger at the lower ranks.
---
I wish theyd fix his fucking neck
---
Whatever dude enjoy your day. You‚Äôre obviously just gonna be argumentative about everything. You play how you want I‚Äôll play how I want.
---
So all the strength lies in the corruption. Otherwise she's like Huntress but with vomit and can't down a survivor with her projectile?
---
If you move the stick in a circle instead it goes at the same speed and won't damage your controller as much
---
I‚Äôll play the Game any day over Lerys as either side. Can not stand when those broken glasses appear on my webs.
---
1.	Probably a few 100,000, I‚Äôve noticed it takes a bit over 20k for a full sized level
---
2.	 500,000k at least
---
3.	idk I think so
---
4.	the shrine is a bit of a mystery, although what I and a few other people believe is that the more people have a teachable, the more likely it is to show up, even though every perk has a chance. This is why certain perks seem to appear so much.
---
5.	the absolute fastest solo would be an engineers toolbox with spark plugs and a brand new part as well as wake up and technician and spine chill all giving you a speed buff. Assuming you don‚Äôt want to talk about such specific stuff, it is fastest to do one gen with multiple people on it but fastest to do all gens if everyone splits up. Also, on games where the killer has ruin, dont gen tap. Doing the skillchecks will very quickly teach you how to hit great skill checks more consistently and it is faster than tapping or searching for ruin (but if your team is oblivious go ahead and search)
---
6.	Id reccomend getting one survivor (especially meg or Claudette) to a good level first so that you have someone with generally strong perks without teachables to work with, then level up survivors to get teachables based on what you want.
---
7.	not sure about this one actually
---
8.	The perk borrowed time will save them, but in order to get the unhook you‚Äôll need to have basic coordination with your team. This just means everyone has to go in at once if you are going to save so that the people not rescuing can take hits to keep the others safe. Make sure if they are camping to prioritize doing gens. The killer should only be able to get that 1 kill if done right.
---
4 p3?
---
Really? Damn that's actually kinda of hilarious (and sad). I'll probably get her, thanks for the info!
---
So going by the monto vid that did the same thing.  Yes.  Cleansing is a good idea.  But at the same time.  You‚Äôre not going to know that there doing a full 100% sweat build like that.   And honestly. That add on shouldn‚Äôt be that much as it does give her the help she needed.   I did my adept Claudette against a plague and as all the survivors cleansed themselves. It was only me doing gens as they were being chased down with projectile damaging vomit. I‚Äôd rather stay sick and my aura be shown every time I vomit rather than be found and be put down instantly from a distance.
---
Nope, pretty good to be honest.
---
You just need to get better at anatomy, for example Ghostface's arms are quite small and nea's face looks kinda weird, needs more chin and nose. and the feet would use more work.
---
Nea's face looks flat, maybe some shading would help and GF body seems in a weird position, try giving him, a more dynamic pose next time.
---
But overall, it looks pretty good.
---
Korn.
---
Yo.
---
Slurpee.
---
Too bad it'll be seen at 5 fps (assuming it's like every other port to the switch) :/ that is a sick looking skin
---
Well...they said they weren't doing console exclusive things anymore. Guess they did the big lie.
---
Wow this is awful, is this legit?
---
For context, though, do you see anyone being able to stop gens from flying at red ranks who isn't Nurse, Billy, or Spirit?
---
I heard from some people here that it depends a lot on RNG so I think the perk is in a problematic state right now, I hope we can come up with something to make the perk viable
---
I wonder what the item's lore will say.
---
Mobile version runs beautifully, albeit some minor graphical issues. I'm sure it'll be fine.
---
Laurie, "come over her trapper and pull my finger"
---
Exactly. Hopefully it's a QOL fix down the line.
---
Playing DBD without sound? She's earned my respect and sympathy.
---
Right but that's not dream pull
---
Eeyup. I can only find information about it in regards to the Japanese version of the game, though.
---
&gt;Are you a rank 20 survivors don‚Äôt give two shits about ruin pass rank 10
---
I am a veteran player seeing ruin with an objectively eye. 
---
This perk being a totem that can be removed within the first 30s on top of being RNG reliant (you can complete a whole generator without getting a single skill check) makes it rather weak. At the same time, having two effects directly tied to it on top of survivors prioritizing totem hunting instead of powering through, makes it obnoxious. 
---
I wouldn't give a damn about Ruin if its only effect was flat gen regression (as it says in the description) but the stronger one, is preventing you from progressing the generator for 3s or so seconds.
---
Like I said, this perk has to be nerfed before being buffed.
---
i thought that someone was going to dc, any way, thats sad
---
This says all: https://youtu.be/6iy8xSQW9YI?t=69
---
Speed doesn't matter as long as the stick is moving so instead try to knock the killer into stuff by keeping in either left or right, and gently moving it up and down, and switching between left and right when an object comes in the killers left or right side
---
You gotta use Long ain‚Äôt
---
I offered up a lot more than that but again you resorted to being childish and making smartass little comments quite a while ago.  I also live the fact that you appear to doubt I know how to play the game, this is like the 3rd time you've brought it up.  Like I said I play primarily this game.  Been playing for years, first time I hit rank 1 was back during the days of instablinds, pallet vacuum, Wraith having to uncloak to kick a gen, exhaustion recovery midchase, etc...I didny come here to brag about my play but you keep coming at me with this misplaced assumption that I  want play just because I come down on the biggest crutch perk remaining in the game.  We don't need it anymore man.  A lot of updates have gone our way over the course of the past year or so.
---
&gt; Mobile version runs beautifully
---
two different languges, possibly very different hardware architecture (i'm not sure, i don't have a switch).
---
Especially when it‚Äôs Legion  running ruin, thanatophobia, and the one that leaves them mangled. They LOVE finding new survivors cause it takes forever for the ones just unhooked to get back into action
---
I have tried her out for rituals but I'm not into her... Especially her rest after blinking
---
Not more exclusives :scream:
---
Yeah that‚Äôs usually what I do when I see SWF
---
But Old Freddy had some mindgames with the phasing (Or with pill bottle), heavy stall, and stealth by simply being invisible until you slept them.
---
New Freddy has little stall besides survivors failing skill checks to wake up. Old Freddy had 50% speed in dream world WITHOUT addons, and with addons it could reach a sickening 75% or even 95%. New Freddy has no stall in base kit, and addons won't let it hit even 50%.
---
Switch runs a glorified android OS. Seeing as Elder Scrolls Blades was straight ported over directly and it runs fine, I think DBD will be fine as well
---
Should see another clip I have, it's worse but it wont let me upload it
---
No because you can literally exploit the perk by gen tapping and if you miss the great get off the gen count to 3 and get back on it. It‚Äôs a bad perk that needs a buff or the other option make it so killers don‚Äôt have to run the perk but that won‚Äôt happen as it‚Äôs nearly impossible to pressure gens if your not a mobile killer.
---
well ive already seen this joke about a 1000 times
---
I think if the killer could go to a totem and make it activate would be interesting but if a survivor is working on a generator and see that Ruin got activated and they had something to reveal the killer's aura, like a key or something, they would see the killer and would know that the Ruin's totem would be close to the killer right now, if this is a good idea or not, I don't really know, I hope you have a good day
---
I just want to see you play.
---
I had a 3 man do this just now when the rando was being carried
---
If 2 or more survivors are in the same place, it would be a smart move to go there
---
i just wanted to comment and say that i hate when people attempt to derail arguments with "lol u low rank". 
---
Additionally, i appreciate your assessment of the situation. cheers!
---
I mean I get it's nice but don't see how it makes them a dick if they don't? Killers like bloodpoints too
---
I think you guys are being to toxic to the guy. Not everyone is a master to the game.
---
actually made me laugh lol, good job.
---
Yeah, you've got a good point there. But, hey, a "new" free character is still cool, at least!
---
Classic DBD... Everyone's the bad guy
---
I still haven't seen it either- He didn't mori me cause I hadn't been on the hook all match haha
---
Ok, call me ignorant, but where did you got that or did you made it?
---
I'm sorry, is this some sort of peasant joke I'm too rich to understand?
---
No I haven‚Äôt.  Might be a possibility but I started playing in August of last year and I  have yet to run into anyone I blocked. Since then, the people I get team up with have been in America for the most part.
---
Prioritize guarding important gens, (killer shack gens, gens that spawn in the same place every time, etc.). Kick them down as often as possible. Pigs‚Äôs perk surveillance is pretty good at keeping tabs on when gens are getting worked on.
---
Badham is NOT Fine at all.  Literally every part of that map is unmindgamable, shack is actually a good place in comparison to the other parts.
---
stupid people hurt me.
---
Looked to me like he was being smart, buying time since there were teammates still in the game. However, your little show at the end with your chainsaw could be seen as BMs too
---
Don‚Äôt forget to put them on the hook first
---
I think it's pretty easy to pick up. There's definitely stuff that you'll need to practice but when you're at low ranks against other low ranks you can just have fun with it. As for the tips, as a survivor I'd say to try and limit how much you drop pallets. You want to drop them to stop the killer from hitting you, not just to slow them down, so if you're being chased and the killer is a fair distance away from you, just leave the pallet alone. And remember to unhook your team mates. A 'win' is not just escaping. You have to do objectives and help team mates, and distract the killer if you want to score well. 
---
For killer: It's ok to abandon a chase if the survivor is wasting too much of your time. If the other 3 survivors are just sat on generators whilst you run after a strong survivor, you're going to lose. Anyone can do generators, but not everyone is good in chases. Find an easier target and get them instead, and then try and catch the stronger survivor in a bad position where they can't get away from you. Camping hooks is also a bad idea as it leaves everyone else free to just do generators. You also get less points: survivor is not just about escaping, and killer is not just about killing - ideally you want to hook everyone 3 times, and that means letting them get unhooked. Obviously if you see a survivor going for the save, try and get them, but don't just stand by a hook until the person dies.

just change you country/region on the App Store to Denmark and then download it and awitch back tot our home region.
---
I think in the first 3rd year stream they said Red Paint Brush would make all four survivors start the match already asleep + skill checks no longer wake you up, but this might have been changed since then.
---
I know in the PTB for Ghostface the Unicorn Block had a different description. 
---
https://i.redd.it/mqx8va2pxm231.png Blindness for 60 seconds after they use the clock or hit a dream snare. Remember this was in the Ghostface PTB and they also changed Ghostface's addons which made crouch-hits inflict mangled or hemorrhage, so this might have changed since then. (Besides Blindness is a pretty shitty status effect for a green addon)

I saw a spreadsheet with lots of different killer and survivor builds to try last week, but now I can't find it. I thought it was under the useful links tab on this subreddit but it isn't. Does anyone know what I'm talking about and where to find it? I feel like I saw it on this subreddit.
---
All cases? So does it also work when carrying a survivor to a hook?
---
I just head on bumped into a  killer but he just grab me
---
Depends on which killer, survivor skill, and map awareness on both sides.  Doctor, nurse, hag, wraith (maybe not), and spirit have a great time on this map (and all m1 killers benefit from easier map control).  Trapper, Billy, Clown, Huntress, ghostface, and Leatherface have a bad time on this map.  
---
Gens still go quick (arguably quicker) since they are closer together and easier to get to.  There are tons of safe pallets and all stairs/holes are places to proc balanced landing.  Overall I wouldn‚Äôt call it killer sided since more than half the killers perform worse or are made into m1 killers, combined with very little mindgame-able loops.  I personally as a 100% killer main don‚Äôt get excited when I get this map.
---
If you are being chased always have a action in mind like windows, pallets, or general loops
---
If you have distance or if you can take a hit (if you can afford it) loop the killer around the pallet first instead of waiting and dropping it. It gives pallets a longer life and more use. 
---
The pallet in Killer Shack is known as God pallet since it's a very good looping spot because of the window, the small shack area. 
---
For more popular killers
---
Hillbilly: Windows are your friend since he has to get the chainsaw just right to chainsaw through. However pallets are fine to stall him for a short time only because the chainsaw goes through pallets.
---
Hag: Usually the traps will be in a general location, but a good hag will have them in known locations survivors will chase so she can end chases quicker. Good Hags are nuts.
---
Spirit: When she stands still she could be tricking you so never get closer to her body. More importantly when she uses her ability run away then try to run towards where you think your scratch marks are so you have distance and can trick her into thinking you walked away.
---
Michael: Even in chases try to break line of sight as often as you can. This includes using trees and poles just so it takes longer to gain Evil Within.
---
Leatheface: Similar to hillbilly but is easier to stun him. Try looping through right forests, it's a 50/50 chance they either hit a tree or dont
---
1. There are a few answers to this already, but I feel like it could be stated a bit more clearly, so here goes: As long as you hold down your ctrl key (or whatever crouch is assigned to) the entire time, you won't set off a phantasm trap. Even if the animation shows you standing to do an interaction, to the game you're still in crouch mode as long as the key is pressed. You can perform all interactions while holding crouch. I think the only thing you can't do while crouched is sprint, for obvious reasons.
---
Plague. Her perks are better and i find her more enjoyable
---
If you walk up to someone in a trap if you are not carrying someone you can grab them if you are at the right angle and carry them with out hitting them.

I'm trying to think the logic on why devs would need to Nerf spirit. Trying to find something to fix on spirit feels like such a nit pick compared to bigger issues.
---
It's also garbage until tier 3, IMHO, so I wouldn't bother with it until you've fully leveled it.
---
And Hag, it's her best map
---
I made a mistake on the name
---
1. We have a killer called The Shape
---
2. Lunge is the same for everyone, you can't make medium lunge
---
3. Terror Radius is 32 for 115% killers for balancing reasons. You can't change this either.
---
Gotta ask tho bc I've never had to throw away a pair of underwear over this, but let's say you fall off a hill and stand still on landing, will a trap trigger?
---
No problem. Insight is a little useless when you have stupid team mates. I'm convinced that by design, the plague was built to destroy people who make way to many mistakes. She's easy as pie to play against when everyone else is playing optimally. Which rarely ever happens if you solo queue. 
---
Just make the best of whatever happens and don't expect much from anyone in the game and you'll have a good time.
---
I just bought the game based of a friend's recommendation, what, if any, DLCs are worth purchasing? Additionally, what is a good survivor or killer to start playing with?

\&gt; guy gets ban for griefing teammate
---
\&gt; guy tries to get confirmation about said ban, admits that in at least one game he griefed his teammate

tech support probably closed it and moved on. it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to determine this guy literally just admitted to committing a ban worthy offense. i don't see any reason for support to reach out, when they need to allocate resources to help people who aren't actively shitting on their community.
---
Just play a little bit more hours bud
---
I never really use that aha. Its probably pretty good. But even the killer itself

Wasn‚Äôt expecting anyone to care, just thought it was funny to see his watermark there, had to send it to a few mates (including 2 console nurse mains) besides we are talking about someone who grammar nazi‚Äôd one of my messages and called me childish for having fortnite (haven‚Äôt touched in over a year btw) I deserve to be a little petty back don‚Äôt ya think? ;)
---
The graphics bring me Alone in the Dark vibes
---
Easy! Don‚Äôt run Dying Light

---
Oh
---
If the Spirit is super, ultra good, your best bet is Iron Will. Even then though you'll still get found if she's top tier so.
---
Kinda can't counter a super good Spirit.
---
I have no idea actually. I‚Äôve never come across that situation as far as I can recall.
---
I'm actually terrified what's gonna happen to Badham. It is already a terrible map but recently they released Ormond and the Temple which both have a ton of terrible unmindgameable loops. Ormond is probaby the worst map in the game at the moment. If they think those maps are fine I am really scared what's gonna happen to Badham...
---
The generator teleport is not for grabbing people, but with perks like tinkerer and pgtw, freddy can be really hard to fight
---
Use the teleport with the Discordance perk and you don't have to walk across the whole map to get to the survivors. Or the last three gens if they're far apart. Combine with pop the weasel? Seems useful to me. Fake pallets sound fun to use, especially if you see a survivor going towards a loop you know full well has a fake pallet. The other trap could also be great if you place most of them in one general location, like the killer shack.
---
Personally, I'm very excited to try out the rework.
---
Similar to a nurse, they are called the insta dc characters for a reason. Difficult to learn but oh boy, when they do
---
You could just edit the post. Anyway:
---
1. Lunge cannot be "medium". Every killer has the same lunge (except Myers in tier 1).
---
2. TR is 32 for 115% killers (except Myers) for balance reasons.
---
I'm like 60% a survivor main, but when I do play killer I play legion because I feel like Legion generates a lot of bloodpoints, is fun to play, and I personally have a lot of fun going against Legion. It's also funny to see people saying Legion is OP when Legion's like, mid tier at BEST. But they can easily 4k, and they are fun. (Also the skins are really cool.)
---
Oh I will , it's just the matches I got with him as the killer were actually hell , when other killers were okay. As long as there is no camping because man . Why do people do that
---
Iron will is good. May want to consider Diversion, although that is incredibly situational.
---
That‚Äôs lame. I don‚Äôt want to have to run iron will every game to only play 1/5 spirit games. I guess 20% of games is just an auto loss :/
---
Thank you though I appreciate the tip
---
yeah! I suppose it was always a bit empty in the middle tho but it really looks like it was more dense than it is now
---
Why is always Trapper the one with exclusive cosmetics? Ok, it's the mascot but it is also one of the less played killers
---
I couldn't edit the title, and people wouldn't read the comments before making one themselves
---
For spirit if you're outside her terror radius while she uses her power you'll hear this *wooooshh* sound. If you're inside her radius though, you won't hear anything. While she's phasing she moves faster but she can only see scratch marks (although certain add-ons can change this). The best way to counter her is to either walk or double back on your own scratch marks to try to lose her. If you're injured she'll be able to hear you though so unless you're using Iron Will it might be a challenge. 
---
For Wraith he can't attack while he's in his cloaked mode and it takes a few seconds for him to uncloak (and you'll hear his bell, although some add-ons can change this). The best advice I can give you is to keep an eye open because you can still see a rough outline when he's cloak and hear his footsteps. If you see him, try to get as much distance between you and him or use a pallet or vault if you think you can make it without getting hit.
---
I don't know what matches y'all are participating in but usually in mine there are people searching the totem and in my whole time playing dbd I have only seen it once that there are 4 people repairing one Gen. In theory this is uber, sure but reality looks different ü§î I also had matches where we never found the totem and died without a single gen made
---
Yup, exactly.
---
People are pretty biased when it comes to NOED. Tell them it isn't a broken op noob crutch perk that makes any rank 20 win against 4 rank 1s and they'll lose their shit.
---
Tbh I prefer this over what we have. It's not Robert England but it looks a lot better than the remake Freddy
---
From my killer viewpoint: Can't blame me of shit when you're all fucking ninjas.
---
From my Survivor view point when I unknowingly farm: Shit! Run dude! *Charge straight into the killer and makes them chase me.*
---
From my Survivor view point when my only SWF partner tells me the killer is going straight back to the hook: FOLLOW ME YOU STUPID FUCK! WHERE ARE YOU GOING!? I HAVE A FUCKING INSTA-HEAL!
---
Dude me too! His scream is the best imo
---
Of Flesh and Mud and the Cannibal are great choices because they have the two best killer perks in the game. Barbecue and Chili for Cannibal and Hex: Ruin for Of Flesh and Mud.
---
Claudette or Meg, who both come with the vanilla game, are excellent choices for beginning survivors because Claudette has Self-care and Meg has Adrenaline and Sprint burst. All three perks are extremely good when you are first starting out.
---
They... they did "q" gen ?
---
Ormond should just be deleted tbh.
---
It's the old beta, not the mobile app
---
All the survivors are basically identical in how they play so which one you play as is very much down to you. However, Meg and Claudette are free and both start with strong perks so they'd be good picks. As for killer, trapper and wraith are free and very straightforward so would be good to start with. Hag is another good killer for beginners if you bought the version where she comes free. All of the DLC killers are really fun to play. When you play as survivor you'll be matched against DLC killers pretty often so you can see which killers you find fun/interesting/strong to play against which might influence your decision.
---
Imagine having five perks and no items, that would be more balanced.
---
Dude I‚Äôm a big trapper main I love that killer
---
No, but like, SWF would LITERALLY make a killer who can transform into a survivor useless. All other killer powers at least do SOMETHING. 
---
"Hey, anyone near the killer shack? No? Alright, that's the killer then."
---
That person is not shitting on the community. He only did this once. **Once.**
---
If everyone got banned for disconnecting once or doing this specifically once then half the community would disappear in a few days because everyone would be getting ban hammered. Sometimes they don‚Äôt mean for that to happen like disconnecting or discovering their team mate (it‚Äôs happened before where someone runs into their teammate as I, the killer, arrive and they panic and run away as I take the person in the locker and hook them because hey are easier to deal with compared to the one guy escaping my clutches)
---
I love totems because they are important for the objective so people don't spend almost all of their time running from the killer and doing generators, I would love to see other forms of different gameplay to the survivors, I don't know if granting more blood points for a longer duration of the totem would do a difference, it's kinda of a buff to the killer so survivors spend more time not doing gens, but anyway, I hope you have a good day
---
it doesn't have any unique assets and we have 3 other maps in the realm
---
Wait a min they have a mobile game of this wtf???
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
Lmao don't listen to these kids, play the game however you see fit. Survivors have all kinds of stupid fucking rules. Your only job is to kill. That's it.
---
&gt; Sometimes they don‚Äôt mean for that to happen
---
While this is an absolutely true statement, OP even stated they did it to get the killer back on the trail of the meg in question. If that isn't a bannable offense, what is?
---
Hey, is the leatherface in the basement?... Ok.
---
people really complain about this?
---
Yeah, way back, wasn't Meg also black? White Claudette is seen in the old Dbd trailer too, [this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGhIXLO3ul8) She's the one dead on the hook in the basement.
---
&gt;If you're good enough at the game. You won't be hit
---
But if the Plague Player is also good enough at the game, a single mistake might doom you.
---
Bruh jane moans in ‚Äúagony‚Äù like the biggest sidechick when hit
---
Well before ghostface and even the matchmaking priority update, matches as killer weren't that much longer than survivor.
---
You take that back mister!
---
Ohh, LOL
---
Dead Head Hard On (Erectile Dysfunction Perk) 
---
If you are suffering from a floppy disk, you may go into a locker and quietly weep and the killer will pity you and let you live.
---
The difference is that if the Leatherface is hiding in the basement all game, he's being stupid.
---
Even if my victims have borrowed time I tend to still catch whoever gets boosted by it by sheer tunneling (and by tunneling I mean ‚Äúacting like a pack of wolves looking for the weakest prey in a large herd‚Äù tunneling, not ‚ÄúI shall ruin their fun by attacking them specifically‚Äù tunneling. Gotta win somehow when all they do is group up and heal each other after losing me am I right fellas?)
---
Ok yeah but I don‚Äôt know
---
How does this even happen?
---
&gt; puts spirit in Low-Mid tier
---
this makes me unreasonably angry
---
I mean playing survivor on console isn't that big of a disadvantage.
---
FUCK YEA its hella fun too
---
&gt;wned at all f
---
I've noticed you have quite a few different answers for the unbroken category question. You get iridescent if you escape the trial without ever being downed. You get gold for escaping the trial regardless of how many times you were downed/hooked. If you do die, you get silver/bronze/no emblem based off of how long you survived. You get silver for surviving for 9 minutes, bronze for 5 minutes.
---
It drives me nuts seeing other survivors healing in the middle of a chase like this. Congratulations you healed 5% of your health and are nowhere closer to escaping the killing. In fact your increasing your chance of being downed.
---
Oh my friends do that all the time, even if I tell them they should stop and actually wait for the killer to go away. But as a Bill main there is a risk I like to take for the borrowed time perk but they just don't have that perk.
---
Nurse is fine, she just need her own rank like prestige rank, or rank 0
---
Wow, was not expecting that to be the ending.
---
Use whatever perks and add ons you want!
---
If I feel like bringing a mori then I will. If something is legit bugged then I won't use it.. otherwise enjoy the game you paid money for it!
---
She low tier because she can‚Äôt see people which means she is bad Eururjjeje
---
That list makes 0 sense it looks like you put the killers in random spots.
---
In an asymmetrical game, there shouldn't have to be as much balance as this game has, the numerous role should be less powerful than the power role, not equally powerful or more powerful. Survivors should be harder to play as, but in higher ranks that simply isn't the case. They don't need to multitask as much as killer does, their time is a lot harder to waste than the killers'. the balance is just skewed incorrectly, that's all there is to it
---
uh, ok.
---
Why always Trapper? Very few people play him, give Billy a skin as he hasn‚Äôt gotten a new one in a while
---
Medium vault?
---
Is this rank 15 survivor trying to make a killer tier list?
---
Are you from Bizarro world, OP?
---
Spirit without a doubt.
---
Wdym this is perfectly justified
---
well then in that case it wouldn‚Äôt made more sense to just post a separate reply instead of replying to my comment
---
Maybe he is literally Canada‚Äôs best
---
What‚Äôs the badham rework going to be?
---
No trapper op
---
You just need to get her to level 35, then comes the RNG bullshit.
---
Now you can facecamp while taking a fat shit üëå
---
i bought legion recently and from my experience (purple ranks) the legion is a very meh killer and plague is just better 
---
legions perks are ok too discordance is nice and mad grit is useful for basement builds 
---
plagues perks seem alright
---
Forget about the auras on Ormond, what I really can't fucking see on this map are the goddamn scratchmarks.
---
Oh, so, now we have differing levels of seriousness, I see. Because you made it sound like, as long as something is common place (like being a sexist pig), it's perfectly fine. 
---
Do you not like your own logic, is that it?
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of battle royale but I respect people‚Äôs opinions.
---
Freddy required skill because he relies completely on mind games. 7 second transition allows for crazy MI dgames, you have no tools to shorten chases so you need to know all the mind games and jukes in the book to do well. With the map knowledge and stalling tool he was essentially incredibly high risk, average reward.
---
Mind you I'm excited for the new freddy, but I will admit, he won't be as interesting and unique to play.
---
Rank 20 actually lmao rank 1 are so low
---
This is a troll list. Don't waste your time, people.
---
I think you get a bit of a pass with Dying Light, because the survivor who has it on them knows they have it, and once they‚Äôre out of the game, the rest of the survivors get an icon too iirc. Like there‚Äôs at least the courtesy of letting that one survivor know you‚Äôre gonna be on them, so they know to play a little more carefully.
---
For Spirit you are correct. She cannon see survivors while using her power but she can still perceive the world in normal time, so Grass moving and crows flying away will still tip the player off. She can also see scratch marks or hear you/bump into you too so be weary of her. Also Spirit has ‚Äúmindgame‚Äù power in the fact that you don‚Äôt know when/if she‚Äôs using her power so she could just be standing there waiting for you to walk out of position when you‚Äôre mindgaming yourself into her arms. Spirit really has no downsides outside of her learning curve. Once you lead to read people and watch for the map, you‚Äôre pretty much unstoppable. 
---
Wraith will in almost all cases move faster when invisible. However he cannot do anything until uncloaking so you need to be cautious of where the bell is coming from or red light is shining from. Outside of specific addons wraith‚Äôs problem come in securing the down. If you get your first hit, that‚Äôs freat but afterwards you have to cut people off from safe areas or play the chase game until you get your hit. 
---
Ghostface has lots of power as long as you know the map. Getting people exposed all hinges on how stealthy you can be so you have to, kinda like the character bio is, learn how your victims move and navigate. The smarter you are with map knowledge the more effective you‚Äôll be at Ghostface. 
---
Pig has...issues. Similar to ghostface, the smarter you are at map awareness the better you‚Äôll be at Amanda because her power can and cannot be used at certain times and recognizing that is paramount to her success. Her biggest drawback is she technically has two powers and they both suck. Her addons are all over the place and very underwhelming. Being good at Amanda is being good at the game in general and your power is more of an annoyance than being strictly helpful in chases.
---
Not the moment, but the name should be right after the loading screen.
---
A*
---
It's has happened to me 3 times and on one occasion it actually killed me from the Endgame Collapse. It is because of the killers connection and it the only way to counter is for the connection to fix itself or to go through hatch
---
Lol I don't what logic you used but it wasn't mine, that's for sure.
---
Yep
---
Maybe try Stridor. Maybe Discordance as well.
---
Just shows how good Beast of Prey (?) is
---
Well, consider playing more hours
---
Yeah I know, I'm just blind and an idiot.
---
There must be balance. just not on a 1:1 level. 
---
Yes, the killer should easily overpower a single survivor, even two. Three should be tough, four should be balanced. BHVR have stated that a perfect game is two survivors exit, two die. That's the balance they're looking for. A skilled Nurse will easily trounce four survivors.
---
Haha, a little bit! 
---
I'm still bummed that I couldn't get the Keeper statue from EW1.
---
JE SUIS CALME!
---
~~for anyone who gets this ref dw I hate ME! too, I'm not insane~~
---
Oof, good point. :')
---
Same thought. Your putting people... on meat hooks. Why wouldn't they scream loudly??
---
Stick your hand in the fire, you're gonna get burned.
---
Bring on the down votes.
---
Are there still teachable perks?
---
Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a turtle move that fast lol
---
Lmao ok now we‚Äôre talking
---
Nothing about being salty there. You become his primary target because you seem to know how to counter his stalk ability and that makes you an obstacle he has to get rid of.
---
I mean run it if you want, fuck that guy.
---
Like someone else said, play how you want, whatever works for you, and you have fun with, go for it!
---
I used to try and follow all the stupid survivor rules and I'd still get death threats and hate mail after every other game, so just disable chat, and play with what gives you the most fun.
---
An image I like to dream up when I'm feeling toxic and I dislike the killer is "Close your windows everyone, we're going through a tunnel!"
---
Shhhh... don‚Äôt tell them
---
Bruh moment
---
That's pretty rad! I love Wraith's design but you have a real appreciation for him, haha. :) I def think his backstory is super sad. :(
---
*Sighs* *Raises hand*
---
Is there something wrong with rancor? It‚Äôs not letting kill my obsession when gates are powered
---
Serious business over here
---
This brings me to my other point
---
First time
---
It was his first time doing this, you don‚Äôt ban someone for doing one bad thing once if it is only minor such as that (you can just get into another match when that one ends and the problem should be avoided for now)
---
I‚Äôve been hook farmed, ive been face camped, I‚Äôve been 4DC‚Äôd, I‚Äôve been flashed the entire match, etc. but what do I do? I don‚Äôt threaten them with bans or get so upset I wanna report them, I just ignore it. Next match should be better! I‚Äôve only disconnected once intentionally, and that was still when I was quite the rookie. I made a mistake? Yup. But it was one mistake. Not 16. That is why I side with OP. The only time I report is when they trash talk me in messages (I don‚Äôt report for hook farming unless I‚Äôm not the victim, but if I am the victim I don‚Äôt report and go along my way)
---
TL:DR
---
You bring my other point into account, one time offense means can be forgiven for now. Reporting should be reserved for hook farming and trashtalking. (Sorry for that ‚Äúreporting‚Äù strawman arguement, I got a little too heartfelt in this in a good way and wanted to help more than needed)
---
the queue times have gone auto quite a bit since GFs release at rank 7 i find a game in around 1-2 minutes
---
It‚Äôs non canon, because it‚Äôs not bubba
---
For sure - got two or three people I know on this who have been looking fora multiplayer game and haven't been sucked into Apex, but for the most part, Apex has still been the singular gaming habit of like half the people I know for a solid few months now
---
Honestly its a reasonable reaction after being IMPALED with a meat hook
---
I can fasecamp while nutting
---
I said we already have a shape
---
I never said that, I said that if a Nurse on console goes against a full team of PC survivors the Nurse won't have a good time.
---
&gt; I get hooked
---
&gt; why do I
---
&gt; scream?
---
are you serious?
---
Ruin is a useless perk in red/purple ranks. People hit the great skill checks and the totem is gone in 30 seconds anyway. Use Pop Goes the Weasel instead to stall more.
---
The Switch [gameplay at E3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gSGzkvMkLU&amp;t=33s) looked quite decend.
---
You do realize that hitting the unhooker and hitting the unhooked survivor with borrowed time is about the same right...? The only difference is you‚Äôre hurting yourself point wise and time wise by hitting the unhooked instead of just chasing new prey
---
**Darn**
---
Mixed that up. But playing on pc survivor isn't a huge advantage, it's just like playing nurse on in general, horrible.
---
yeah, wise choice to change to pc whenever possible it is, especially because survivors have it easier since they have an analog stick to 360 and move in general, and killers have a harder time hitting survivors, i played a lot in ps4 and now on pc i feel the difference
---
I like that about a lot of DbD killers. Like the Spirit, Hag, and Huntress were just either traumatized or victims of horrible situations that turned them into what they are now. Makes it more empathetic as some might still retain their humanity despite what has become of them.
---
The killer was also shocked and messaged us to say "wtf" haha
---
*Hex Ruin* !!!
---
I think clown should be higher on this list because he‚Äôs high on his tonic
---
What do you mean gone auto?
---
That's sort of the thing: DbD isn't a niche, it's a midlevel player base - by all accounts, its online numbers are only respectable. But compared to literally every other asymmetrical multiplayer game that's ever been attempted, it basically reigns supreme
---
The issue isn't that it's a dead game, or even a dying game - it's as popular as ever. The issue is selling people on asymmetrical multiplayer: most folks just aren't down with the 4v1 concept
---
Thanks random David for sticking around!
---
Or he gets free hits on two survivors and now they have to heal. It's 100% better to stay separate and do separate generators. It's indisputable and the benefits aren't even close.
---
Ok thanks also didn‚Äôt the pig killed with her traps when a survivor scaped?
---
if it would be that easy then nobody would be salty and toxic, the thing about these kind of games is that there will always be toxicity and salt
---
That‚Äôs a lot of dead boizzzz
---
What isn't toxic in this fucking game?
---
Genuine question. I picked the game up recently and I keep seeing toxicity thrown around at everything down to quickly completing your objective as a killer or survivor. The people I've played with have been actually quite nice, often sending GGs after a match, but online is where it seems like playing the game in any way counts as toxic.
---
I've not even touched some killers due to people screeching toxicity. I love the game, but damn.
---
You said it was a "normal" joke. IE, common place. It's sexist, so clearly, to you, if something is common place, DESPITE BEING MORALLY WRONG, like I said in the first place here, you think it's fine. 
---
That's literally your logic here, that you are presenting.
---
He still has stall in the form of addons. 50% stall came with the caviat of finding people, and even then it was ineffective in most cases since Survivors would wake up so fast. Now it'll happen regardless.
---
His mindgames are better and don't require a Very Rare addon to use. His stealth is also far healthier as you're no longer fighting Wraith on steroids.
---
Everything that was removed is what people hated playing against which made players DC and demand nerfs on Freddy's first itteration. Everything that's being added is what people hated when playing as Freddy and made people demand buffs for a boring Killer.
---
No matter how I look at it the change is for the better. No more unhealthy cancerous mechanics and a lot more skill-based gameplay.
---
He was the first killer made so he gets spotlight
---
Nah. Mostly just spend my time dealing with idiots who'd rather be a smartass and a dick to a total stranger than to try and understand humor....  ;)
---
if it would be that easy then nobody would be toxic and salty at each other, it is pretty common to find people who just cant handle losing
---
This isn't console?
---
i dont see any logic of not cleansing literally just makes you one hit the whole game
---
I never presented that at all, Again as I have said before, That is not my logic, I have no idea where you pulled that from.
---
It not a passive debuff it‚Äôs a trap you have to place like trapper yet only slows them down instead of injuring or holding them in place. Teleports to gen like hag, wraith, or nurse except with a delay that lets them know you‚Äôre coming which makes it worthless. He can turn the trap into a fake pallet instead with an addon yet doc has the same thing but it doesn‚Äôt take away any of his other attributes. They took skills from other killers and put them together into an underpowered amalgamation of garbage so whiny trash can have an all around character.
---
It's not misinformation. It's 100% more effective to get on separate gens than it is to get on the same gen.
---
I'll add you I'm civilduckling56
---
Pretty much every killer at every rank. Also, add to this that the controls make looping virtually impossible, killers stop when lunging, nobody can hit a god damn skill check, tunnelling in every game, the terror radius mechanic is awful because the camera gets ultra close to your character in a lot of situations, walking instead of sprinting is more difficult than it needs to be, hit detection is worse, every single match I've played (rank 42 survivor) has at least one DC, most games don't start with a full team, map offerings don't work, perks don't have descriptions once you've bought them, etc etc. The mobile version is serviceable at best, the majority of the time is complete garbage. Stick to literally any other version of the game.
---
Honestly I'm so used to it on console that I don't think it would be the same without the salt lmao.
---
Used to, they changed with the new endgame collapse sadly.
---
Despite it being her one niche use for it, some people believe it to be too strong for her to be able to keep them in the game while the timer goes down. Despite the numerous ways it could be balanced out.
---
His tracking wasn't as strong as Nurse because Nurse's ability to do basically everything better then average puts her in a completely different league above the other killers. That being said Freddy's tracking ability is ludicriously powerful and unfun to deal with. You can't escape a Killer who knows where you are 24/7.
---
This did, again, come with the caviat of Freddy being dog shit at chasing which is extremely unhealthy for the game. You can't have a Killer who can find Survivors super easily but never down them. It just forces one Survivor to loop all game while the others play M1 simulator.
---
if he‚Äôs not free,i will have problems
---
What's the best way to beat ghostface? I find all the other killers fun, but ghostface just seems to be relentless!
---
theres a 50/50 imo, there can be surv who dont get salty or the ones that acuse you of camping because you are in the map while someone is hooked
---
we hope not
---
-Consoles Peasants
---
if it would be that easy then nobody would be toxic and salty at each other, it is pretty common to find people who just cant handle losing and just yell that you are camping when you are not
---
Seems kind of bland to be honest. Ultimately he's going to be a worse clown in a chase with a bit more map pressure.
---
What‚Äôre you implying?
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/arrested-development-college-jason-bateman-oN6ERSh4LKhuU
---
Great! I'll be online soon. Shoot me a message on Xbox
---
Really, you never said it was a normal joke? Would you like me to screen shot your message for you, since your eyes are apparently not fucking working?
---
Killer dosen't stop when longing, you need to hold forward while lunging, auto walk doesn't work with it
---
No pig = I uninstall
---
that he probably wasnt camping, and the survivors just were angry that they didnt win and started yelling for no reason
---
Just find a swf group and get on separate gens at the start of the game.
---
Just did
---
I mean he DID admit to proxy camping, so I doubt this.
---
It's all fun and games until survivors start vaulting hooks.
---
No. She's mid tier at best on all versions.
---
the camp at the end was just to strong, at least he chainsawed into the hook to allow us to get this far
---
How soon after blinking can you attack as Nurse? I always feel like I take too long after warping to attack. Is there an indicator, like can you attack as soon as she screams? I'm on PS4, I dunno how/if that affects it at all.
---
But I‚Äôm not camping at the hook I‚Äôm going back to chase after them when they rescued them
---
Why would you use Balanced Landing together with sprint burst?
---
Literally everything in the game from the pitiful amount of time it takes to complete a gen, to the ridiculous number of pallets that can spawn.
---
No she got murdered by behaviour
---
Wow much constructive very positive tnx :)
---
Spirit or Legion. 
---
I can imagine that. 
---
Their stories. Spirit's death, Legion's creation... that would be great.
---
You could do that before.
---
Shitting was a bit more complicated
---
You're the random that throws games for everyone else.
---
even if he was, i get salty survivors that throw shit at me just because i killed them and thats literally 100% of the time for me, at least one survivor will get salty and call me a tunneler because i killed them
---
600 hours of console and I've met ONE semi decent nurse. I've used her a few times and good lord it's tough.
---
Perks : Hex:Ruin, Monitor and Abuse, Enduring and Spirit Fury/Surveillance.
---
Add-ons : an Apple ( mandatory against survivors who don't cleanse ) + effectiveness/Black Incense.
---
Strategy : infect everyone as quick as possible, after they get broken, you can use Enduring and Spirit Fury to get the second hit or you can leave them and try to ambush them later with Monitor and Abuse and Surveillance. If everyone is broken and nobody wants to cleanse, you can use your Apple to get Corrupt Purge. Black Incense will give you free wallhacks when survivors are broken, so you can use it with an Apple to snowball into a 4k.
---
Pretty much at the end of her scream, but as long as you aren‚Äôt mid blink and the window is open, you‚Äôre free to attack. The only indicator I know of is the little click noise that goes off when your blink window is over before your fatigue.
---
&gt; [ghostface] started slashing me on hook which is the killers version of teabagging
---
ghostface can tbag perfectly fine already
---
Diffrent killers have much diffrent lunges. Compare Doctor to Trapper and youll see what i mean
---
Train yourself to put the killer in the center of your screen, no matter who. The constant vigilance of looking around will save you.
---
What phone are you playing on?
---
It should let you kill them when all generators are powered. Maybe the gates were powered because the hatch was closed, before all the gens were done? I'm just guessing, because it seems like it might be a bug.
---
Bill for sure. Gets less disadvantage, but extremely good bonus
---
So true! Badham's biggest problem lie with the building it copied from Haddonfield, anyway!
---
What the fuck did I just see?
---
Only BM in post game and taking games in game hostage is ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. Everything else isn‚Äôt and people are just vocal minority. Some people will call anything toxic and you can just ignore them because the word toxic holds very little meaning in this game.
---
Yes, if you escape you get to keep your item and its add-ons, and they'll be fully charged in the next game.
---
**Please stop veering from the topic.**
---
From a killer point of view i kinda would like to face Bills. Easier to chase, but way harder to camp. Since i don't camp that's good for me :P
---
I‚Äôve had times where I try to take a hit after unhooking someone and the killer goes straight through me to hit the unhooked (ya know, broken hitboxes)
---
&gt;  She gets a free corrupt pool if everyone is fully sick and no one cleanses though. So make sure only 1 person does. Don't let her have more than 1 pool active.
---
Dunno if that's the case. I'm a Plague semi-main and I can confirm 4 broken survivors does NOT give you a free corrupt purge. 
---
However, when you cleanse at a fountain, that fountain becomes blocked off from survivors until either one or two things happen.
---
One: Plague goes over and takes the corruption. She gets corrupt purge and the fountain becomes clean again.
---
Two: If ALL fountains are corrupted/blocked, they all reset to clean and the Plague automatically gets corrupt purge. 
---
Just clarifying that for you. You might be thinking of the apple addons, which make one pool start corrupted from the beginning of the match. The only other "free" corrupt is the aforementioned "pool reset" that occurs once ALL pools are corrupt, aka *everybody* is cleansing to the point Plague can't even keep up.
---
I think nea should be higher, after all she does have experience evading the police and such.
---
&gt;blink Nurse.
---
Lol is that a thing?
---
ü§îü§îü§î
---
What's this list for?
---
Yes, as you look at him, you'll here a sound start to play which tells you you are revealing him, and then once he's revealed you'll get some bloodpoints and he'll sort of flash. At that point, run. He can't get a one hit kill on you. You can reveal him whilst running in the opposite direction as well, just look over your shoulder and run backwards.
---
Why is it BS?
---
I think they work best not unique or else you would see the same 1-3 Characters and never any other characters because they don‚Äôt fit the meta. 
---
Survivors work best not unique and just as skins.
---
Hey don't diss this possibility , Payday 2 came out with a fully voice acted and uniquely modeld character as a switch exclusive and she was timed.
---
ay gj dude! couldn't imagine the work you've put in :D
---
Eeeeeiiiiiiiii... thump-thump, thump-thump, thumb-thump, thump-thump
---
Well it has a lot of designe problems but they are solving it (not very fast but hey). In general the balance is horrible, but you can enjoy it and its getting better with the time.
---
The content of the screenshot is a repost. People have been posting "1 away from leveling up" since player level came out. I don't see how they are different from each other.
---
Legion, because they break pallets with their asses.
---
This is more of a "fantasy" pick a choice game, than an actual suggestion.
---
I agree we would eventually figure out the best 3-4 survivors and the others wouldn't get played.
---
I think this will be a timed exclusive
---
&gt;Payday 2 came out with a fully voice acted and uniquely modeld character as a switch exclusive and she was timed.
---
It's amazing!
---
Rub her back.
---
You can kill without being a dick too
---
The less seriously you take it, the more fun you'll have :) some people treat it like an esport and it's misery, for others it's a "just for fun" horror game and its a blast!
---
Whats this hahahahaha
---
Sometimes the community can be awful and you'll experience some bad things (Killer camping, survivors teabagging, dc'ing).
---
But, overall, it's a really good game and it's even better if you play it with friends.
---
Give me your Steam username, if you want, so we can play together!
---
I always see people complain about the shit they get in the chat but I've yet to get any hate as a survivor or killer
---
The problem is their speed for balancing.
---
Community: Fredy is not strong enough
---
Devs: 2 years later they finally buff him (and then you have to wait another 6 months to readjust...)
---
1) bandwidth usually means fuck all in multiplayer games because transmission of data is so minor. I was addressing the ridiculous idea that low bandwidth would affect the game quality which would only be if it was so choked down it was increasing the RTT.
---
2) That's pretty fucking obvious, it still fluctuates enough to show if you're going to experience "500ms" ping though.
---
3) No one is talking about jitter. Remember the context.
---
Head back to the OP and try not to move the goal posts.
---
yeah david is strong but his whole character is that he's a dumbass who throws himself into danger he'd get himself killed
---
It would be cool if it played after you escaped
---
Yeah, it's nice to have a map that doesn't have the safest place possible to get to from anywhere on the map easily.
---
He is weak in comparison to the other killers, but if you are determined you will get good with him. I currently play him pretty much exclusively, just got to rank 3.
---
Capitalize on every instance where a survivor tries to hide(make it look like you didn't see them hide and it will be too late for them to escape your saw), oh and don't be afraid to saw through windows. Also equip bamboozle.
---
The reason I main Bubba is because Texas Chain Saw Massacre is my favorite horror film.
---
She should run at half speed and have harsher penalties for falling from heights?
---
Would smash both?

There's a difference between surviving and whooping some ass lol.
---
No.
---
Yeah, you never called it a bad joke there, bro. Normal implies commonplace. I'm sorry if you don't understand basic English words and their definitions, maybe crack a dictionary open? Because that's literally what your statement implies.
---
Alright alright, my bad for not reading further
---
Simply no, huh?
---
This is, I think, the crux of the issue. Sandbagging is not a ban worthy offense, regardless of what any given person may believe. In order for it to be griefing, the condition of actively working with the enemy would have to be met. Not "well I think it is" but actively met. I was in no way working with the Killer.
---
Make Jeff look like keunu reeves. #breathtaking
---
This meme made me breathe voluntarily for a while
---
fortnite runs a solid 30 fps on switch, only lagging when theres a lot of shit going on
---
buddy????
---
That's why I love this game we play!!
---
I mean I'd say that guys like Tru3 and Hexy also don't really know what would be actually good for balance either but yeah, they should probably not be so afraid and at least try things more often.
---
I just hope they nerf Billy‚Äôs base movement speed to make up for his insane travel speed .
---
Keep it up man B)
---
I like both cause there's plenty of ways to escape killer and great ambush spots for killers.
---
It's for joke purposes, yeah.
---
If the survivor you chase is good, the strategy is to bloodlust 3 them all game and then once the gens are done you down them with noed.
---
Then once they get hooked you are allowed to blink again and make sure they die. Sick strat tbh.
---
The concept of the game is very good and fun, although out of all the games I have ever played in my life, this game has the worst balance I've ever seen.
---
That's my opinion, you decide.
---
There should be a slider for different volumes in game. Make the max settings the same volume as they are now, to prevent people from turning up different volumes for an advantage.
---
maybe he is just lonely, poor guy
---
This sub seems to be 60/40 on what can be classified as being a dick. Tunneling survivors is a legit strategy, said by others, and regardless of if it‚Äôs toxic or not, you should ‚Äúdo what you want to as a killer to win.‚Äù I personally don‚Äôt tunnel and camp as a killer, and I don‚Äôt appreciate having it happen to me, but saying what you just said in this forum will probably get you flamed
---
This is entirely wrong, make a new one and this time make it more accurately
---
Couldn't agree more. Actually looked the other day expecting to see something like it there already
---
She then turns into a 115% M1 killer that can one shot you. Don‚Äôt know why this strat is so popular.
---
Ok the teleport skill is still garbage so what does it matter if you can use it more often and the lullaby is garbage to it‚Äôs no different then a terror radius, you hear it you know he is there.
---
I choose less time in the lobby
---
I closed the hatch, Darn.
---
Dying light is super weak now. No point of removing it. Left behind though delete please.
---
The other people summed it up well so I'll just add - play killer too. Even if it's just the rituals. Having an understanding of their mechanics will help you as a survivor.
---
But dying light is barely used in the game and if the killer doesn't bring a Mori it's kinda useless
---
Why do people do this?
---
Its a pretty casual game which is great to just spend some hours on it ! Its fun and entertaining but if you like competitive ranks or ladders its not for you as LOL,R6, Overwatch. Etc.
---
I got a "KYS" after a 5 min hag sweep... its there
---
feng is a skinny ass gamer girl the fuck would she do
---
It‚Äôs only worth it if you‚Äôre playing on your own because otherwise you‚Äôll be in the lobby waiting for a game for like 20 mins not even exaggerating it‚Äôs so bad.
---
Yeah, I'd like to give it a try but don't have a lot of time to queue in a lobby.
---
being hooked
---
Agreed.
---
Like o.o !
---
I didn‚Äôt say sandbagging is ban worthy, anyway
---
I can‚Äôt follow what you‚Äôre saying anymore.
---
Manipulate the Killers with gamer girl bath water.
---
I have never seen an achievement chanfed so its still accessible. I own so many "dead" games that can never be completed for this reason
---
...
---
True !
---
Aaaayy
---
Thank you I really appriciate your opinion and i'll try these advices next time :)
---
Hide very well, come up with smart strategies.
---
So i really don‚Äôt understand why people get salty about the killer ensuring the survivor gets sacrificed. If that‚Äôs how he wants to play why complain? It allows you to repair the gens.
---
Trust him.
---
Source: am Northern Irish
---
it was proabably a deal with switch, we might be getting someyhing big coming, like cross platform
---
Didn‚Äôt they say in one of the streams they are gonna do another summer event like last years back yard bbq event.
---
meant to say down
---
That's what borrowed time is for
---
If you don‚Äôt run that perk don‚Äôt farm people without taking hits and getting them killed
---
How do Claudettes have fun by basically crouching around not playing that game. I don‚Äôt get it
---
*Freddy Kruger's basement* has literally two of the safest pallets in the game...
---
 This game does not need cross platform, it really doesn't.
---
Is there an offline mode?
---
So if the survivors finish all 5 gens they should get a free escape?
---
Hell naw, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a killer preparing for the endgame, it‚Äôs not like generators are hard to do currently.
---
*cries in Kate's original scream*
---
Not at all.
---
Fetal Fatality?
---
Yeah I don't really understand this argument, like at all.
---
Hide if you want, wait out the corrupt purge, but how is being constantly exposed a good trade off? Unless you have Iron Will, which not everyone does, you're going to be heard, and then if you're find your chases are going to be short as fuck anyway since you're one hit.
---
Either way her power is still effecting the game,you're exposed or she can get you with range. And I seriously don't see why you wouldn't just take that risk instead of being insta down for the rest of the game
---
As a killer main I‚Äôm gonna save you a lot of headache. Adjust your message settings. Trust me
---
I'm just not big on purposely harassing other players (t-bagging, post-game chat) for shits and giggles. We're all just trying to have fun.
---
This is the turtle from ‚ÄúThe tortoise and the hare‚Äù we all read about as kids. Always knew slow and steady wins the race was bullshit.
---
When the killer kills me faster than I like
---
Freddy should be ok. The aura vision.
---
Big brain play though. Fail the DS on purpose to break out of the dream ;D
---
But sometimes I get some actually wholesome messages.
---
Which side is favored?
---
Yep, as an Xbox player this happens quite often. Even as a survivor, killers will message you saying that looping is toxic. But, I actually get GGs and other nice things more often.
---
Noed is basically insurance if you can't kill the survivors before exit gates open.
---
I love it!
---
Nice samination reference
---
People complaining about the legion got them to change or, not DCing. DCing is a epidemic in this game and it has no defense except IRL problems. Be an adult, squeeze whatever points you can, and move on.
---
Yeah, same here.
---
I can't stand P3 Claudettes. Not because of the "camo" they carry but rather they always, ALWAYS seem to be the toxic player in the lobby.
---
Some people just get chased near the hook, making it easier to camp (accidentally)
---
Dude didn't even hesitate - left the gate straight away.
---
Idea: Samination
---
I know. And I miss getting those myself. But it‚Äôs not worth wading through all of the hate. At least it wasn‚Äôt to me.
---
They REALLY should consider adding workshop support to steam so people can change their icons with ease - not that it is difficult by any means but make it easier for the noobs and eliminate any ban worries.
---
I havent played in sometime. So I am trying to learn the finer details about endgame collapse.
---
When the killer closes the hatch do the exit gates open faster?  Wiki says exit gates should take 20 seconds but they seem to open really fast for the last survivor during endgame collapse.

No it goes deeper than that

You're supposed to use the sounds of the gen to cover up he sounds of your healing right next to it
---
Sometimes you can mind game one that spawns on the upper floor between shelves, but it depends on the RNG.

Scooby-Doo on his hind legs for survivor

Didn‚Äôt know it worked like that

I'm amazed then, I've had to disable public messages on my steam profile because I genuinely couldn't just enjoy the game anymore.

I don't mean this as an attack/insult or anything, but I genuinely do not believe that you have not encountered any form of hatred of anything in chat/outside the game.

---
What's this?
---
Surprisingly, I don't get that much salt.  It's just when it DOES happen, it's REALLY bad.
---
But the thing is, Laurie did whoop Micheals ass. Multiple times. And hes practically unstoppable.
---
This is my first post on Reddit ever so forgive me if I made a stupid mistake.
---
Change your graphics settings to low.
---
Because it is the only horror survivor game out right now . Would instantly be back on Friday if future support gets announced .  DBD is fun but the skill ceiling is too low in comparison  and every update seems to suck a little fun away .
---
Was hoping you‚Äôre playing on a bad phone :D the textures look really bad
---
I don't really farm, but yeah unless Im hurt I usually take aggro
---
Yeah man I was playing Ghostface to wrap him up before I prestige him and literally four games in a row I had three gens go off in the time span it took me to have one chase
---
Red ranks, no ruin, and in each lobby at least three of the survivors had tool boxes
---
I hate camping, I do, I usually try to be a fun killer for the survivors but like my hand is really be forced here. I'm not dodging, I'm not bringing Ruin, and my chases really aren't taking that long, yet I'm still getting messed up
---
yes it would be a good idea
---
Or David in a very cheap looking Scooby Doo costume...or just a dog collar idk
---
[Number 45](https://youtu.be/UfzYsSjYagQ)
---
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to reply to the other person, not you. You have the right idea!
---
The game feels as it sending two signals get out survive look out for yourself. While saying be a team with people who don‚Äôt want to team up with you. It‚Äôs two sides being fed but not one steady direction.
---
Definitely. I just hope that they do go that route if anything - they'd be asses to start charging for them.
---
LOL
---
The teleport isnt garbarge? A 18 second global cooldown is not garbarge. The Lullby is better as its non direcitonal.
---
Well technically so has every survivor in DbD.
---
Even then you can lead the chase away. It will do 1 of 2 things
---
1) The killer stops chasing you and will let you heal up to try again or to let you do a gen
---
2) The killer chases you and your teammates have time to unhook you
---
I know the situation could be that they find the best loop spot nearby but in the situation of someone being hooked. I would take the hit if you can to lead him away
---
gas heaven  is like one of the most fun maps to play lol
---
Bruh this has basically nothing to do with dbd
---
I don‚Äôt think so...
---
No we are not just a lot of people need to drain the oven of salt from other teaching them toxic concepts.
---
I'm pretty sure this is how it looks like for everyone at the moment even with awesome phone specs, due to the reason it's in beta you cant expect much from it until later. I grew a fond of it over time because I hated how bad they appeared but the game seems to play extremely smoothly.
---
Wtf is tunneling
---
When does the new reworked Freddy drop?
---
Grats!! I‚Äôm so close in hours but so far in achievements. Shame on me. Good job so far!
---
Laurie takes a big beating and whoops Mikey's ass over several films
---
Oh, makes sense
---
Some things I would have preffer to never know.
---
Then shouldn't they all be top tier because they're all equally skilled in the DBD world? No. We're talking about how they did pre-trials. Tapp died like immediately. Laurie nearly killed an unstoppable being.
---
It's fine. It's not a dick move or anything like that, it can be a strategy. The only reason people complain is because it can be boring for them, but I'd rather be slugged and potentially saved later than hooked.
---
Thinking about it now, I suppose it *can* be a dick move to just slug everyone and never hook anyone at all, even after all 4 have gone down. I had that happen once. It was just a long time of all of us crawling around, killer not hooking anyone.
---
Yea, wiggle out is a set amount of time as long as you are moving the stick :)
---
TIP: You can also pause in-game and it will show all the offerings, the survivor's on the top, and the killer's on the bottom.
---
It might be different on pc but on console matchmaking with friends is looong
---
I think you hit the nail on the head. It‚Äôs really the toolboxes that can crush gens, which require RUIN to at least slow it down just a bit.
---
But that‚Äôs the thing. Ruin shouldn‚Äôt be a near requirement at red ranks. Sure some killers don‚Äôt run ruin and can still 3-4K but let‚Äôs face it. Against an organized swf at red ranks, it‚Äôs required. 
---
The ability to move hexes should be good. But there should be a downside to that too, otherwise killers would just always move them around and place them at op spots. Maybe a severe lengthy reassemble time that leaves them open to gen rushing, and the totem isn‚Äôt active during the reassembly process.
---
Wait a second, it does kill if the trap is active?
---
It‚Äôs got a delay and the gen you are teleporting to shoots a geyser of blood when you start the channel it‚Äôs absolute worthless trash you can teleport to it but no one will be there that‚Äôs for sure. Ok and why does non directional matter? If I hear him coming I‚Äôll just hide until I see him and urban evasion him so ya it‚Äôs trash
---
Leave.
---
I don't think they open faster in the endgame collapse. The perk 'Wake Up!' makes you open exit gates faster, and being near someone with the Leader perk also makes you open exit gates faster, but I think those are the only times it's quicker.
---
Maybe recently, but last I heard it was rough. It's good they fixed it. When it first released I saw gameplay and it looked like a steady 15
---
No. your trash. Do you just hide with every other killer who cant find you?
---
Nea should be higher tbh
---
Not really. It's entirely free to play, and the only things gained from loot boxes are cosmetics.
---
Thats good :) I'm probably wrong then!
---
Ah, well fair enough. That's still doable.
---
Ps4: mlblou; looking for people down for swf or kyf. Can be serious or not at all. Usually I play with my bf, we're ranks 8 and 11 but we'll play with anyone. I suck at looping so looking to practice that too!
---
u/nwordbot u/xDirtyxBurgerx
---
I'm not saying that lmao, they all have different skill sets. But making the argument that Laurie should be higher because she's whooped michael is kinda moot in a game where everyone can do it. Tapp is higher than Laurie because he's a trained officer with combat training, and David just because he's street fighter. Her lack of experience actually fighting is what puts her under them. Though barley.
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
I have looked through xdirtyxburgerx's posting history and found 11 N-words, of which 4 were hard-Rs. xdirtyxburgerx has said the N-word 2 times since last investigated.
---
Can I ask why the preschool needed rework in the first place?
---
Hehe
---
So glad I‚Äôm gay,
---
Theres also the whole being body blocked by people outside of the dream and not being able to do anything about it. Also self care exists so free wakeup.
---
If the Spirit gets blinded (indicated on Surv FOV by killer blind) The Spirit cannot enter phase walk and will be forced out by the blind if she is in it.
---
ofc! Again, dm me if you have any more questions
---
(Hint: The hair)
---
I'm not saying she should necessarily be higher than those two, but she should be top tier. And it was revealed in the latest movie that she DOES have a LOT of experience. Imo shes definitely in the top tier, but we're all entitled to our opinion.
---
A killer can't guard 4 gens you blithering fucking moron üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I have been seeing so much adrenaline I am  tempted to start using noed.
---
Yeah I guess the most important thing is that it‚Äôs running smoothly. Can‚Äôt wait to actually play it
---
I didn‚Äôt expected this XD but borderlands is fine
---
That doesn't seem right since I remember times I was in spirit walk and heard survivors doing that causing me to know there location. I'll have to try that in a KYF lobby
---
Well, probably a months time.. Typically for the devs, they do an introduction, then 2 weeks later PTB, then release.
---
Makes sense because Ghostface about a month ago plus this month would make it an even 3 months per chapter.
---
The only perk that can prevent 3 gens from popping after your first chase needs to be nerfed? The fuck?
---
I think it is fine üòÇ but thank you really üòè
---
Aaaw thank you. I will tell to my friend that he did good job ^^
---
In U.S. I see 'gg ez' and mean comments on my steam account, but that just may be because it's pc.
---
No his is -Partrick- math.
---
Oh and not to mention certain mechanics in this game are ridiculous like for example, some perks can give the killer ability to Onehit you, which is absolutely insane. 
---
People say it‚Äôs fine but when you wait 10 minutes to get in to a game and then you get Onehit downed it‚Äôs like...what‚Äôs the point even playing?
---
I don't remember it being stated Laurie having any actual combat training outside from practicing at a gun range. Which is hardly a factor in a place where nobody has guns.
---
Thank you. I will have to tell about it to my friend that he did really good job
---
My truly what?
---
she is, you gotta play her a little differently from other killers and be wary of how all the survivors are playing, but it is fun.
---
I have a link to the apk which I got it from that is if your on android or you could watch this video by GamingGrizzly on YT and he shows you how to get it whether your on Android or IOS.
---
Oh shit 2009

---
 20 96
---
Well..
---
Got a fair few event cakes just waiting
---
I like how they see the two die two escape as the optimal outcome yet the scoring system screws you in that scenario.
---
That will be Trappers skin in smash bros
---
Still would be an advantage to turn other things down...  If you could turn things down like generator noises when you're a survivor.
---
I mean, on Xbox Ghost Faces are either extremely toxic, or the nicest players you'd meet. There's no inbetween. I've had so many Ghost Face players give me the hatch/let me escape, but I've also had a lot tunnel me for 5+ minutes and facecamp me even if that means the other survivors get all the left over gens done.
---
Wish it was at least you look at it no big circle
---
realistically, if you get impaled on a hook, what do you think your reaction would be? game functionality aside, what do you think the correct elicited response would be?

Leave Nea alone she‚Äôs cute
---
I see that knee like I see a glimpse of that totem
---
Just focus on gens, be altruistic if you can but if the killers camping just let him waste his time. You have like a minute or 2 between phases on the hook so theres no rush. Pick up bond or aftercare, they're both really helpful. 
---
If the games looking like it's over fond the hatch and camp it.
---
I am not putting game functionality aside. It is at the forefront of my argument.
---
Lmao so you sit on gens and let them pluck you off? you‚Äôre looking more and more like an idiot as you type I bet you have never made it over rank 15 and when you can no longer defend his trash rebuild with facts anymore you attack me, that‚Äôs honestly pathetic. And it‚Äôs you‚Äôre btw
---
I mean. It‚Äôs been in the game since day 1.  I feel like if something was going to be done about it. It would have been done by now.
---
Spirit is more your style, but keep in mind Spine Chill is a complete and total counter to her. Whenever I see Spirit in red ranks, I actually sigh in relief because I always run Spine Chill.
---
i love this answer
---
Trappers needs a buff honestly. He should be able to find his traps in lockers like how huntress finds her hatchets in lockers. They would be under the hatchets and he could take them whenever he felt like it. Except once you take a trap from a locker it‚Äôs gone and no more traps will spawn
---
On survivor-side, it's fun to outwit and outmaneuver Killers while working as a team to try and survive. For killer, it's the rush of the chase and the ability to completely assert your dominance over the survivors.
---
Nah, I‚Äôd still like to see NOED nerfed, or at least reworked,
---
I swear his scream sounds like patrick.
---
Let me dream man. Lol
---
That‚Äôs the same with any killer really
---
*PvZ theme song*
---
&gt;anything they interact with while fully sick becomes infected, this includes gens, vaults, pallets, totems, and lockers.
---
Just to add to this because I was bored one match when I was vs'ing potatoes. If you have Franklin's or there's a chest open that has an item in it, you can puke on items in the chests and on the ground and they become infected items. I'm not 100% sure if that was a 1 off thing or by design but I did it a couple of times in that match.
---
Like Zubatlel said : "If Billy would be made 110% speed, he would be the worst killer in the game".
---
You do that then Freddy will get ya,   Just trying to help ;-; XD
---
Hey new guy!
---
You must have been that default Dwight I saw fucking up gen skillchecks in the barn at Coldwind!
---
No you can‚Äôt I‚Äôve countered everything you‚Äôve brought up with valid facts the rework will never survive in mid ranks let alone in the high ranks where people currently can make it with Freddy. If anything they should make the rebuild a free to play for beginners to practice on because trapper is better than him honestly. At least his traps actually harm and stop survivors.
---
Hes probably with his gf like "idk some crazy chick keep texting me."
---
He can say whatever he wants . If he has no reasoning behind it than it means nothing . He still has a instadown and insane map pressure ...... that alone will keep him top tier .
---
God that sudden ping rise feel terrible
---
Tip put them. Around hooked boys
---
EVERY killer can survive high ranks so that point is mute.
---
Billy broken ? Spirit and arguably Hag are better than him against good survivors. Billy can be looped like any other 115% movement speed killer and map design can ruin him like any 115% movement speed killer. 
---
Nurse is fine without add-ons. But with range or more blinks add-ons, she becomes truly overpowered.
---
She's not bad to play as. She's not my favorite to play as though. I only use her when a daily comes up and I generally have fun using her when I do. Most people seem to have fun with her but I don't know anyone that uses her exclusively. It's worth the money though even if you end up dropping her from your playlist just for her perks. They can help slow the game down and the tracking perk of hers is pretty decent in some situations more so if you combine it with distressing.
---
KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK A GOOD ONE
---
Feral Frenzy
---
I know how to get it on iOS I‚Äôm just too lazy :D
---
I guess I‚Äôm gonna wait for the release and see the finished product. Until then I will judge every screenshot or video I see :D
---
How does plague have an advantage?
---
Be nice if leatherface got more faces! Was fun hunting them!
---
Corrupt purge
---
This looks like a really bad fortnite skin
---
Rancor is kind of a weaker perk now that the EGC is here. But if Rancor worked when you closed the hatch you‚Äôd just be rubbing salt in the obsession‚Äôs wound.
---
I should try this sometime, looks really effective.
---
I mean the switching between left and right. I though it would just wiggle randomly.
---
Did you record it?
---
You need Iron Will and probably even Spine Chill to counter a good Spirit. Without these, God help you.
---
There‚Äôs 4 blinks with no downsides.
---
The 2 blink add on and wooden horse has 4 blinks no downsides.
---
But yeah omega range blink nurse is more fun/difficult for survivors imo.
---
This is awesome

---
He‚Äôs a very difficult killer to play. He‚Äôs undoubtedly unique, but very hard to get things done with if you don‚Äôt adapt your playstyle, and almost impossible to do anything with against really experienced survivors.
---
Spine Chill doesn't do much without Iron Will against Spirit, a good one still can track you easily.
---
\*angry as fuk\*
---
Is this only on PS4,
---
It's just like the PC or console version? I beg to differ. The mechanics are the same, the execution is a heck of a lot different. I've played enough to get to rank 42 now but it's painful to play even when you're used to the controls.
---
She literally gouged Michael's eye with a coat hanger
---
Well don't play around it but when you get fucking beaned thats your problem, I'm a rank 1 survivor and have gotten in 8~ times, since I don't try too much and it really doesn't hurt my game that much.
---
no? ‚Äútrigger‚Äù is a clinical term and if you‚Äôre still using this term that was parodied in like 2016 you‚Äôre probably 13
---
The lower in ranks you get, that harder it is to pip so this is good, but keep getting better and better
---
Is there a way to get killer-specific perks on a different killer other than leveling the applicable character until the perk is teachable or waiting for it to drop in the shrine of secrets? 
---
Seems like everyone runs BBQ and Chili or Ruin (or both) but I have &lt;0 interest in getting the Cannibal and Hag up to level 35.
---
I enjoy exploring for new survivors after hooks. That's why I run Make your Choice and Hex: Devour Hope or other similar perks that reward me for doing so.
---
Have fun gen tapping and taking way longer to do a gen.
---
Yeah, I played all the time for 3 weeks when it came out, but I got bored after that.
---
Can you elaborate on that?
---
This definitely happens in all of my lobbies as killer. I have a pretty above-average connection and don't get any lag in-game but for some reason loading any webpage makes the survivors spike by like 200ms for .1 second, so I have to do all my profile checking at the end of the countdown or they'll all leave thinking I have bad internet.
---
sounds like it could be a more general problem than Clown specifically - only tips there are the usual, practice getting good at throwing bottles and pushing survivors away from loops with preemptive placement. you probably shouldn‚Äôt be chasing someone for 2m, only time that will be beneficial to you is if they dropped every single pallet, setting you up for a strong end game (at which point NOED would be good, but anyway). know when to switch targets and stay defending gens. look up how to play tiles as killer if you are not sure you are handling shack/L walls properly. note Bamboozle changes this a bit and it might be best immediately vaulting to force them away from that tile. this combined with bottles can turn strong loops into completely unplayable ones. thats really the strength and focus of Clown. a killer will always catch in an open field run, so use gas to push them away from loops and just walk them down. all you have is chase and m1, so you gotta have solid fundamentals as Clown. even for experienced players it doesn‚Äôt hurt to go check those tile tutorial videos and refresh yourself on how a killer should approach every kind of loop/obstacle. also as you rank up and play better players, if doesn‚Äôt hurt to bring out those strong addons like exhaust/expose gas. :)
---
as for perks, you have no tracking and no ruin/intervention, if you are hunting and chasing for 5-7 minutes at spawn, thats always going to be a bad time. i would try to get 1-2 of bbq, whispers, intervention and ruin in there. Pop is useless if you are not getting consistent hook momentum.
---
Are you playing with rank 21s?
---
Billy is easier. But Spirit is probably better against high tier survivors. 
---
Spirit is more stealthy as well, but you need Prayer Beads to unlock her true stealth potential. Her power is better using to counter loops than to ambush people.
---
I noticed last night The Game really messes with Small Game. Not sure if being two stories confuses the radius of the perk but it‚Äôs probably the best map for totems and SG doesn‚Äôt even help. Not to mention some places are blocked off until gens open the door and you have to go way around. Easy to waste a lot of time on that map looking for totems.
---
Of all the maps I‚Äôve escaped the least amount of times from The Game by far. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty killer sided.
---
Small fucking dev team my ass, they are like the second largest indie video game company in Canada.  If they have less then 20 people working on animations I'll be fucking surprised.
---
Seeing OP's comments I can tell he doesn't know anything about balancing maps.
---
Nope, leveling &amp; the Shrine are the only way to unlock unique perks
---
Ah well, off to buy Hag then. Thx!
---
Why people hyped for bill ? Survivors are just skins and bill is a 0 cosmetic survivor at that
---
How do I counter ghostface's power. I am a bit ashamed to ask because I am rank 4 survivor and I still can't break him out of stealth. I look at him but nothing happens. Even if I put the center of the screen on him nothing happens or maybe if I am lucky I can start revealing him but the sound disappears almost instantly.
---
they will be devs trying to get 60fps on all consoles. it is a lot easier to be nurse than it used to be
---
This is pretty much the Trapper's greatest flaw: Why does he not have all of his traps in his possession from the start? He is the only Killer who has this issue.
---
Huntress starts with all her Hatchets. Pig starts with all her RBTs. Clown starts with all four bottles. So why not Trapper? It's such a simple change and would allow him to waste less time walking for his traps.
---
Projecting at its finest
---
When Hill Billy hooks someone and sees another person across the map with BBQ.
---
Very dependent on skill. Generally at low ranks killers are very strong but at higher ranks a group of survivors who know what they're doing should be able to get the upper hand.
---
Trapper love
---
Many Billy mains agree that Billy isn't that good. I know even survivors mains who don't struggle too much against red ranks Billy. Just because he is played the most, that doesn't mean he needs nerfs, maybe other killers needs buffs ?
---
It's very easy to say 'a good survivor/killer won't fall for that', but it's not a good argument to make. Even rank 1/2 Spirit's become much easier to deal with when running SC. The reason is because they can't rely on their power to jump you or trick you. In the beginning, for example, Spirit's try to use their powers to pull someone off a gen/totem to get an easy down. SC lights up and avoid that all-together. If I'm on one side of the pallet and the Spirit is on the other side, the chances of her tricking me by fake using her power drops down to 0%. IF SC stays lit, she isn't using it. If SC goes off, at any point, that's my cue to book it because she's using her power.
---
However, SC does have its limitations. Doesn't really help against Nurse, and is less effective against Billy compared to Spirit. Still, I love the perk
---
Yes! It's really, really fun, and can be super tense if you like horror. For how simple the concept sounds I find the game to have a really great amount of variation; no two matches ever really feel the same.
---
The only killers I play regularly is Wraith and ghostface, and Freddy occasionally. I'm considering branching out and playing others. Mostly to get teachable perks.
---
Mortal Koooombat!!
---
the hell you talking about
---
Holy shit, I legit forgot about her perks. It's just like white noise in a bloodweb when I see them. Yep, Huntress worst killer perks
---
They shouldn‚Äôt have wanted to twin with an asshole ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It happens.
---
Correct lol so walk away
---
Yeah when I get hooked by a camper I'll try to signal to keep doing generators, and I'll struggle till the end hoping the team can get the gens done and escape. I'd rather take the loss very slowly in hopes that the others survive just to stick it to the camping killer.
---
That‚Äôs hot, I have to get a switch now
---
1.There is no unranked/normal mode
---
2.Even if there was that would probably kill the game
---
With my pro gamer moves. 
---
This was done on Xbox. I remember setting up to grab the perks and logged off and the next day I grabbed one of the perks and for whatever reason, the entity didn't consume the other so I grabbed that one also
---
I don‚Äôt think it is random that there is a correlation between Billy being played the most at high ranks. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they buffed everyone else instead .
---
I remember when I first bought the game, I got it with the Halloween bundle, and I looked at Myers perks after figuring out how the obsession worked, and thinking, with no more experience than the in-game tutorials and one or two matches, "Wait a minute, those don't work well together... how do you get the achievement?"  
---
400 hours later, still don't have
---
But then Red/Purple killers would play mainly against SWF no matter what. Or am I misreading what you‚Äôre trying to say?
---
He gets exclusives and promos because he's the games icon and the first killer to be made.
---
That's fucking badass
---
Bill is no longer left behind
---
Yeaah, it's a tricky one. It's advised to try to focus on getting STBFL to work and ignoring the other two
---
People complain about *everything*
---
Well see your first mistake is picking clown. xD
---
That's about right
---
Maybe they could toy around with numbers a bit? Like let's say ruin remains a hex perk. Fair enough, that's the Hag's theme. Maybe instead of the current effect, the perk be adjusted for keeping the survivor focused on the gen. As long as the totem is active, the speed of the needle for the skill check will speed up anywhere from 25% while looking at the gen to 125% when not looking at the gen. This tied with maybe an effect that dampens terror heartbeats when looking at the gen. This way you have a tug of war between surveying for the killer and working on the gen.
---
Usually, you shouldn't be grabbed if she doesn't have Prayer Beads and you shouldn't fall for the trick with standing still at a pallet. Spine Chill is good against her, but it doesn't completely counter her. Spine Chill completely counter just bad Spirits who abuse WAY too much Prayer Beads.
---
Where's the explanation
---
I play both killer and survivor but I'm all "I KNOW IM FUCKING TOXIC INSULT ME WORSE BITCH OR FUCK OFF" as killer then as survivor I'm all "what i'm not toxic wym i'm just angry"
---
Mark spoiler
---
S Tier: 
---
Nurse: Being able to blink through walls, loops etc, will basically always make her S tier. She can completely counteract loops from happening, keep map pressure etc. This is probably the killer that needs a rework the most. Change my mind.
---
A Tier:
---
Billy: Billy (currently) is the best killer at keeping map pressure. (I do believe that rework Freddy might be a competitor.) He is strong. He has a insta down built into him, and that‚Äôs about it. But the map pressure is what is keeping him up on A tier (in the highest spot on A tier mind you)
---
Spirit: Spirit, is super fun to play as. Super annoying to go against. A good Spirit, can almost always track down an injured survivor (unless they have iron will) The 10% movement speed doesn‚Äôt really do much worse tbh. Being able to mind game at pallets (rarely works but if it does, that‚Äôs a free hook), or phase walk to hit them whilst they‚Äôre freaking out, it‚Äôs strong. And the counters aren‚Äôt that strong. idk, I‚Äôve played only 1 game with Spirit, but from watching streamers/youtubers, she seems to be right under Billy, or maybe a tie?
---
Plague: Plague has two ways it can go. Either 1, everyone is basically going to run No Mither, which makes it very nice for you. Or they cleanse, and you basically become stronger the Nurse (in certain ways, you can still kinda be looped). I feel like Plague is a killer that needs to have more counter play, but, she can still be countered. And she‚Äôs strong. 
---
B Tier:
---
Huntress: I do believe that Huntress can be a devastating killer to go against. She can chuck hatches (if u didn‚Äôt know that, you‚Äôre clearly new), which, with practise and mind gaming, can be crazy strong. She‚Äôs kinda like a weaker Nurse. The 10% movement speed does kinda affect her. She has problems at catching up, checking on generators, etc. But, I still feel like she‚Äôs not a killer to be underestimated. 
---
Clown: First, being able to almost completely block of loops, is strong. It can end chases super fast, and, counter plays are hard to pull of, although, there‚Äôs many. Being able to chuck a bottle to areas where survivors can be, can save you upwards of 10 seconds, which is actually crazy strong, since, time is the thing your most limited with. Not really anything more to be said, boring killer to play as? sry clown mains.
---
Hag: Being able to teleport, is strong. And it can work as a finding survivor thing. I feel like she‚Äôs strong, but the counter plays are way to strong. The amount of Urban Evasion gamers out there, completely counter the Hag. And the 10% movement speed is the reason why she isn‚Äôt up there with the Spirit, or Plague. Still, she can be devastating, when your lucky. A very luck based killer.
---
Ghostface: I found it hard to put the G face on this list. He can be countered, sometimes, by looking at him. But the glitchy area of detection sometimes makes it impossible. And sometimes, you the killer won‚Äôt even possibly be able to see a survivor, and be spotted when your behind cover. He is kinda broken in that regard. But when you do get them ‚Äúexposed‚Äù, one of two things are gonna happen. Either 1, worst case scenario, the survivor is going to take you out for a walk on the beach, through a lot of pallets, or two, best case scenario, you just hit them, and hook them in one attack. He can be devastating, if he works like he‚Äôs intended to be. (I am partially a G Face myself, so, I know most things from experience, he‚Äôs super fun to play as btw, and really easy to learn)
---
C Tier:
---
Doctor: A good Doctor can be scary scary. Being able to keep survivors in place, is not broken, but it‚Äôs strong. But, learning that timing, and it not always working the way it‚Äôs supposed to, because believe it or not, lag is one of Doctor's biggest weaknesses. On your screen, the survivor is not vaulting, or is in the animation, when you ‚Äúrelease‚Äù your shock, but, in reality, the survivors has already passed the limit. But, if there‚Äôs no lag, and your experienced, prepare to have a lot of DC‚Äôs, and a helluva lot of fun. He‚Äôs good, is what I‚Äôm trying to say. But not as good as any of the other one‚Äôs listed above.
---
Piggy: Piggy‚Äôs main ability, is to slow the game down, just a lil‚Äô bit. But, the RNG is keeping her low. If they get the trap of on their first box, you have just wasted 1 trap. But, if it‚Äôs the last box, she can be strong, as, survivors tend to 99% generators. Capitalise on that, and keep pressure, and protect the boxes. That trap goes off their head, and it‚Äôs time for toxic gen rushing. Map pressure, and map awareness is what a Pig player needs to be successful. In chases, her crouch ability can be strong, but, usually, just use it to sneak up on generators.
---
Daddy Myers: He‚Äôs actually, kinda weak. When you pop your tier 3, your basically a god, but, since every survivor is going to be scared shitless now, you won‚Äôt really be able to find survivors. Use BBQ, it‚Äôll make your life easier. Tier 1, isn‚Äôt really that needed. idk, he‚Äôs very basic. He wastes a lot of time stalking. Especially early game, getting from tier 1 to tier 2, it‚Äôs a massive time waste. Ghostface in my opinion, is just an upgraded Mookel Myers.
---
Legion: Alright, listen. Legion, with the right perks, can do some serious time, in terms of time saving. So, activate Feral Frenzy, stabby stabby one person, find someone else, hit them, one more, and one more (if you can), and chase the final person you find. Your 15% movement speed killer, so, chasing as an M1 killer here isn‚Äôt all that bad. Get them down, and the other survivors should‚Äôve spent time healing. Why heal against a legion? Thanataphobia. They‚Äôll want to heal to get the slow down away. So, now use Sloppy Butcher. 4 seconds extra healing, with the extra 8-12% decrease to Thanataphobia, that is a massive time save for you. Without these perks, and Legion is easily an E or F tier killer (in my opinion, this is coming from someone saving up for the chapter and Susie, obviously)
---
Freddy: I have been a Freddy main, since, late 2018. I still kinda am, but, after the re work, I‚Äôm gone. The current Freddy, WITH PERKS, can be good. Without perks or low level perks, don‚Äôt expect to win or even get close to that. Being able to sleep multiple people is strong, as, they have to waste time waking up. Problem with this, is that, after they have woken up, they can just continue doing their gens. But, if they haven‚Äôt gotten out by the time you hook someone, you‚Äôll have a target immediately. Biggest problem is the thing with loops. His power doesn‚Äôt help in the chase, which obviously is bad. But, if you lose them, use the aura, and sneak up on them, and, that‚Äôs a viable strategy (if you do lose them, don‚Äôt do this intentionally). He‚Äôs also very fun to play as. He‚Äôs kinda like a degraded Legion, but, has some benefits that can still keep players coming back to play him. Like me.
---
Trappy Boi: Trappy boi, is the killer with most ‚ÄúRNG‚Äù. It‚Äôs completely luck based on how smart the survivors are to avoid traps. Placing traps mid chase tho can be a strategy at times. But, his power, unless someone steps into his traps mid chase, doesn‚Äôt help in the chase, only during rare cases. But, he‚Äôs a strategy, a lot of players like that. Otzdarva is an amazing Trapper main, who also plays other killers, check him out on YT and Twitch, he‚Äôs super nice and enjoyable. You might learn a thing or two there. 
---
D Tier:
---
F Tier:
---
Wraith: His power, doesn‚Äôt help in the chase. And being invisible, is kinda lackluster. Make him like the Identity V invisible killer, he seems balanced. And he sounds like he could be around the Pig. I don‚Äôt see any benefit to play as the Wraith. 
---
Bubba: He‚Äôs just an M1 killer with an insta down built into him, that is very weak. Seriously, he‚Äôs boring, he‚Äôs bad, he‚Äôs just, baah. (sorry bubba mains)
---
And that‚Äôs it. Sorry if your main was low, but, truth be told, some killers, are just, bad. RNG is something, that, if the RNG is on your side, can be crazy strong, and around the Billy area, and if it partially works or just doesn‚Äôt work at all, is going to be just thrown all the way down to the bottom. Trapper was the hardest one to place. He can be crazy strong, he can be crazy weak. tbh, after writing this down, he‚Äôs probably around the Pig, spec center in the middle.
---
Just watched flawed Billy pickup El on his shoulders like he's about to sacrifice her to the entity.
---
Really good placement. Man they were super careless though, I would've been mad at myself.
---
Had to post that aswell. Should be there now.
---
What makes you think I'm obeying their arbitrary rules, I'm talking about them complaining, I'm sure we'd all appreciate a more civil post game chat.
---
Doesn't spine chill counter prayer beads?
---
Tapp should be way way lower. He's a Detective. His police skills are rusty and it showed in the film.
---
I know that, it just almost seems like a waste of work designing the model since people rarely play trapper. He already has so many other cosmetics, like the Beat New Trapper Mask, Iron Chuckles Mask, Woodsman hunter and the Celebration Mask for Death garden
---
Most probably a bug, you‚Äôre suppose to keep the add ons
---
I did.
---
Yeah they sound triggered
---
Interesting that Switch players can play as Slade/Deadshot.
---
Having the need to use a perk just to counter an addon should not exist
---
Spine chill counters more than that. Wraith, ghost face, tier 1 myers.
---
Yeah I see it, I think I got here too fast
---
Jumping into a locker afte being unhooked... Thats a ds move so she must have missed it xD
---
It is?
---
Honestly, same with camping. If a killer is truly camping, every other survivor can finish all 5 gens before the hooked dies. If a killer is just preying on peoples inclination to rescue hooked people, it is GG.
---
I never thought of it like this but you are right. Completing a gen allows the survivor's to have completed 20% of their objective. In the same time, a killer getting their first hook is only 8.33% of their objective. That's eye opening. Will definitely use these stats in future.
---
I'd be up for playing. My best friend and I stream it as well on twitch. I think I just hit 14, and he's 8 or 9. Both survivor mains. We should be playing tonight around 7-8 pacific time.. Join us! Both LGBT too :)
---
twitch: mixasaurusrex
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ i wouldnt save them.
---
I've never seen Stranger Things (but I plan to watch it eventually because I've heard it's a good show) so contextualize me please.
---
Who is this man?
---
Hard repost lmao. Wait more then a week next time.
---
Thats weird cuz that map looks a lot better on my phone
---
Personally I've never ran ruin, only haunted grounds, which works miracles for me. Totem spawns are horrible so they get found immediatly = they don't check for ruin = immediate cleanse.  My last few games I've also found 2 people there, one cleansing and one protecting, but that might just have been luck.
---
I bought Freddy because of the rework! Slowly putting BP in him and I'm going to wait for it's release to play him.
---
I think we can just agree to disagree at this point.
---
Haha I gg'ed her and told her to keep working on it :)
---
I ain't repairing any gens lol and I'm not complaining sort of I don't give a shit tbh I just thought I would post the very first video I've ever posted on reddit
---
I'm gay for death, so yes.
---
Wow, this change sounds amazing, it would be really cool if it was a perk from Ghostface, like, since you wouldn't be looking around most of the time, Ghostface have a good amount of time to stalk you. I think this idea would be more interesting if the gen progress was 25% slower if you don't look to it (It has to be very close to the middle of the screen) instead of the needle speed, but your idea of a terror radius if you are looking to the gen sounds really cool, you had an awesome idea, thank you for sharing with us, I hope you have a good day
---
As assface
---
For some reason I find that survivor mains playing killer do the very things that they hate as survivor. Maybe because they know it works on them when they‚Äôre survivor lol.
---
What is the purpose of a survivor using the "lessen mist" offering, or for that matter a killer using the "darken mist" offering? The 2nd makes a little more sense to me since it might be harder to see gens, etc. but I have no clue why a survivor would want to make the map easier to see for the killer.
---
Eh nurses calling on Spirit. She already tracks injured survivors well enough.
---
Swap it out. Monitor and Abuse is good with her. I got rank 1 on Spirit running Monitor, Surveillance, Discordance, and Ruin
---
Not you in particular but just anybody? If that‚Äôs how he wants to play so be it. There is a counter for it. No need to be salty little bitches about it.
---
They really need to buff him to make these cosmetics at least worth it.
---
Once you realize ranks mean nothing in DBD, every match will be casual.
---
This is my wife‚Äôs main killer. Do you happen to have a link to an album with all these? I‚Äôd like to share them with her.
---
I began with him, and was hooked (no pun intended) ever since. 
---
There is ***nothing*** more satisfying than hearing that well-placed trap snap shut on some poor sap-sucka trying to be slick on the map.
---
I wanted to p3 Jane but I can‚Äôt get over the way she sounds. It seems like they purposely made her sound like she‚Äôs in a damn porno. There‚Äôs no way none of the devs realized this when they heard it. And it‚Äôs not even that I mind being heard by the killer, it‚Äôs just that she sounds so damn obnoxious! I really hope they re-record her ‚Äúgrunts‚Äù of pain someday...
---
For a second I thought that was Ace. Haha!
---
Woah thanks for the advice ill be sure to keep this in mind
---
To break ghostface out of his power you need to pallet stun him or stare at him to reveal him. Because there‚Äôs no guarantee to pallet stun him all the time, you reveal him by staring at him and putting him in the center of your screen. Stare long enough and you‚Äôll knock him out of it. By doing this vs all killers it‚Äôll feel more natural when you‚Äôre doing it against GF.
---
why are you being downvoted the fuck?
---
I‚Äôd buy it
---
Guess no one has half a brain then...
---
Because truetalent isn‚Äôt as good as you think. He says he played perfectly but any decent killer can watch his videos and point out at least ten big mistakes.
---
Watch zubatlel or scott. They consistently get 3-4ks and will actually point out their mistakes.
---
Yeah but then too late and the killer turns around. The timing has a very narrow window of opportunity. If you can practice in kill your friends, do that there.
---
Basically I start the flashlight right in between when the killer is hoisting the character onto their shoulder. But it takes practice.
---
And then that‚Äôs if the killer doesn‚Äôt face the wall, or if you even get in front of him on time. If you are chasing the killer for a flashlight save then you aren‚Äôt on gens and are hurting the team that way.
---
Because like all adults have ever told me, life ain't fair
---

---
Haha le triggerded killer mains are overüòé this joke has killed all triggerededed pussis
---
Thanks for the short explanation. I'll remember this when I watch the show.
---
As penisface
---
ok.
---
I don't really get why people complain about tunneling. Isn't it just a good idea to go after a certain person in some situations like if they're the obsession?
---
Sounds better than dead head
---
He meant this is THE shit
---
Its weird how you went from second person in the beginning of the sentence to first person at the end
---
if they're facecamping and someone unhooks you, they're the asshole, not the killer. Not their fault your teammates are idiots.
---
Slugging, well, if he managed to do that to you all, you were probably not going to win that one anyway, but if he just left you all to bleed out that's a dick move.
---
As for the pig, that.. you can report. That kind of behavior is bannable.
---
sure
---
Less most for the survivor could be helpful for seeing objects in the world like Trapper traps, hag traps or even spotting a killer like Amanda and ghostface easier while they‚Äôre crouching. 
---
Inversely those same stealthy killers can use thicker mist to their advantage. However majority of killers would rather have less mist instead of killers getting yellow or purple or at the very least replace those with opposite variants for killers.
---
I feel like they'd go Demogorgon (not sure if that's how its spelled!) over Billy though.  Billy was a one season (secondary antagonist), and the Demogorgon was the original Big Bad and is now being primed as the S4 Big Bad again.    
---
I wonder about Survivor though.  I thought it was interesting that Fortnite went for the Sheriff over Eleven (who is the star).  People seemed to think it was about hitboxes.  Hell - I'd love to get all the kids...Eleven, Mike, Max, Dustin, Lucas &amp; Will.  But I wonder if  they're too short?
---
Came here to say that.
---
I'd guess that a smart killer will probably not go for meg in priority, probably try to go for other survivors first.
---
But i guess a team of 4 meg might be annoying lol
---
good job devs
---
Did anyone see the face she does when getting moried by ghostface? She is 100% enjoying it.
---
I just thought it was interesting both Solo Survivors and Killers are bugged by the same issues.
---
To all of you who complain about it.... 
---
Have you ever been impaled and dangled on a meat hook?
---
You have to hit it before he gets in "no lunge" range. A good killer will not lunge if he knows you have dead hard.
---
Nea for sure. I would just run to everyone else to fuck them over if the killer was chasing me
---
Ace 
---
Perk- unbelievably luck, can take an extra hit before going down
---
Curse - 25% less time on hook before being sacrificed
---
Before anyone says anything. THIS IS AN OPINION
---
Yes Yes Yes Yes...
---
#Y E S
---
Be a bit op even with the drawbacks. Think of the 3 gen strat they could pull off. They walk together between 3 gens, 1 chases while the other continues patrolling gens. No way to win.
---
Deathstroke*
---
Also kinda new to the game.. what does the obsession do? I really don't have a clue.
---
Well, everybody should've play with Meg, she's literally the most OP survivor you listed there.
---
Just to give my own example, new decisive last WAY too long. Changing it to thirty seconds tops off of hook would mean I dont get punished for finding an injured survivor on a gen grabbing them and eating a stun. Sixty seconds is a long ass time in a 5-6 minute game.
---
Are you worried about a ban or something? Your fine dude.
---
Well for how strong they are I think they are good as hex perks.
---
I love it in theory, but it would be too hard to balance without making them too strong or weak.
---
Shout out to the perkless Michael that let me get this screenshot
---
Trapper daddy‚Äôs outfit is always the bestüëç
---
Console Nurse still ain't scary tho. PC nurse almost makes me shit myself.
---
Zaddy!!!
---
None other than being the last alive
---
&gt; Think of the 3 gen strat they could pull off
---
Obviously if survivors gen lock themselves that's very very bad. They would need to make sure last 3 gens aren't too close together. Then you simply need to have a survivor on each 3 gens.
---
finger gun!
---
Puking survivors make a ton of noise. And say she breaks you and leaves you for now. If you don‚Äôt cleanse, the next time she finds you you‚Äôre instadown. Four survivors all broken is my wet dream as Plague. And then you add Thanataphobia on top of it.
---
I'm lookin for someone, I'm a rank 13 ghost face and a rank 15 survivor
---
Well yeah
---
I need whatever your smoking if you think queue times for switch won‚Äôt be long
---
"If you can't handle playing Killer you can always Switch."
---
*When he asks to hide in your locker*
---
I...never said that.
---
*Who needs loops when you can figure eight*
---
Cross platform is kinda needed to help with queue times, sustaining life for the game
---
It took me a whole minute to figure out if that was Tru3Talent or not... I feel the big dumb  üòÅ
---
Killers are crybabies too, they just hate to admit it most times
---
well the reason people camp with him is because he‚Äôs shit at everything else. if he was buffed people wouldn‚Äôt need to camp with him.
---
Well of course he isn‚Äôt. Half of his add-ons don‚Äôt work or punish you for using them. I‚Äôm just sad effort wasn‚Äôt put into their rework, like with Freddy.
---
I guess the really important stuff you shouldn‚Äôt change. Turning down the scream isn‚Äôt going to give you an advantage, if anything it will give you a disadvantage as survivor as you might not hear your teammate get hooked. Things like menu music and such.
---
It's trapper ggez, point at every pallet.
---
&gt;Freddy got ruined in October 2017.
---
&gt;Legion came out over a year later in like December of 2018.
---
&gt;I'm honestly shocked they didn't fix Freddy in a year at least.
---
They also figured out some minor tweaks for Wraith, Trapper and Hag as well as some perks for survivors and killers.
---
when can we get the download?
---
I actually redownload it when I got my 144hz monitor. They have a altered version of the old map and like flying dragons with loot. Quickly uninstalled it because it's only fun if you like losing or if you don't have people to play with.
---
It's happened with ghostface (out of night shroud obviously), leatherface, Myers, trapper, everyone I play. I'm ranking 10 so I'm not sure if that's how people play at higher ranks, but if so I see why killers get so toxic/fed up. I've had maybe 1 game that wasnt full of idiot toxic survivors. Seriously, who tbags over revealing GF?
---
They get to a pallet in case you are about to chase them, then if you do chase they they are already at a pallet. What is so hard to understand about this?
---
I need some gay friends cuz for some reason DBD is a big hit with the gays.
---
I too wait until the actual chase and then start dropping pallets.  If I can find one, that is.  I have no instincts to find them but once I do, I'm usually dead as it drops or soon after.  But I'm getting better at the game.
---
Wraith is still garbage.
---
Trapper is still garbage.
---
Hag is great for the 8 people who play her.
---
Freddy got nerfed to death and was bugged for ages and they never bothered to fix that.
---
Survivors‚Äô lives are literally threatened by the killer, they have every right to engage in methods that will give them a chance to survive
---
I‚Äôm an idiot, ignore me!
---
So in other words, let's just go sit here IN CASE something happens? Nvm the teammates on gens/hooks,  killer is nearby gotta sit here?
---
My inner spirit is a legion of love for you.
---
That‚Äôs a pun I have for you.
---
Just get close and see if you can bait the pallet down, works very consistently until purple ranks
---
You can click on OPs username and see gis recent posts since all the drawings are there
---
Then 2 seconds after they free themselves -. -.
---
Trapper without stitched bag + honing stone is hell mode.
---
It's steam who does that, not BHVR. You view your recent players through steam not DBD
---
Doh! Didn‚Äôt even think of that. Thanks!
---
The thumb cramps üò¢
---
I just dont see a point in waiting at one. Most killers arent going to find you if you pick to decent spot to go hide. Hell, I've had killers literally walked past me. Survivors that sit at pallets are just wasting their own time
---
Agreed. He and doctor are unplayable without good add-ons. That's just poor design.
---
I doubt you have 1 person on hhok and 3 survivors just sitting at pallets not even attempting to make a save after you decide to go after someone. Unless you're at rank 20.
---
Great
---
As you should! *hugs*
---
This is on PS4. Not sure if it‚Äôs the only system that does it.
---
This, recent players in steam....its like people forget they are using steam to play with people....
---
Uses*
---
I doubt that the "possible DBD DLC" will contain a non-humanoid killer. If it were a demigorgon (idk lol) it would have to walk on two feet and be able to have a standard hitbox (unless devs are feeling spicy). I bet that they'd just do a character that is flayed because that'd be easier to model.
---
I also bet that the survivor will be sheriff David (That'd be dope so dope. One of his teachables would probably be related to his anger problems lol).
---
&gt;Wraith is still garbage.
---
&gt;Trapper is still garbage.
---
&gt;Hag is great for the 8 people who play her.
---
&gt;Freddy got nerfed to death and was bugged for ages and they never bothered to fix that.
---
You're entitled to your opinion but it doesn't change the fact that devs spent time making significant changes to these killers and their add-ons.
---
I'm on Xbox, and it hasn't happened to me, which is odd.
---
It's bad man, the toxicity never improves and if you think waiting by pallets is bad, wait till the Flashlight saves every time you get someone to dying
---
It wasn't a rework (typical me marking words), and a nerf or not, is up to the player. 15% might be great for some, but the slower things with the power might be 2 much of a trade off. I feel lile the cooldown should be turned back to 3 seconds, and the normal vault speed. Also, missing shouldn't cancel your power. About Freddy, I have been a long time Freddy main, (since about august of 2018), and been with him for pretty much 40% of his changes. The rework tho, it isn't Freddy. In other words, I am not happy with the rework.
---
damn op you really hate the final girl trope. laurie should be top tier. shame on you
---
plus, they are not ideal vantage points, at one angle maybe but unless you are in one of maps that reminds me of corn mazes (I'm no good at the names of them), then you can pretty much scope out your nook and have time to run for it.  
---
I try not to hide anymore to survive, I've become much braver after not seeing anyone work on generators at all and just doing it myself.  I also try to dash my way to the hook too after being a killer once and no one saving the poor gal I hung up one minute into the match.  That didn't seem like fun at all.
---
Do people prestige their characters solely for the cosmetics or is there another reason why people prestige?
---
Well I mean flashlight saves and sabo builds can also be done with bond, just look at the manner of how they're running. Also if you talk about range I can strike an argument with you not needing that much range, if it's out of bond's range you probably won't get that flashlight save or hook sabo without being completely useless in the transport to the chase.
---
Lmao the unnecessary stalking, let the man breathe!!!
---
They were just throwing themselves into those traps. That's such a good feeling. Gg, wp.
---
I remember after they fixed her, to her current state I mean, people were still thinking that she'd be weak because of her power cool down/low speed.
---
She's so damn fun to play as. Actually feels like you're in control of the game and not the reverse
---
I know what you mean.
---
I had a game last night in the Meat Plant where the survivors managed to power the gates before I got any kills..
---
Game was legit looking like a 0k....
---
then cue me getting 1 Hook, an then 1 person slipped into a trap by the basement. Hooked them there. Then ***another*** person fell into a trap I laid *just* below that hole you drop through to get to the lower floor. ANOTHER basement hook. 3 hooks and the last guy just "NOPED" outta there.
---
went from 0k to 3k in the end-game.
---
The snowball effect is real.
---
Sorry
---
i need the link to the youtube video
---
I can see where your coming from, but, completly ignoring the basics of the game (looping and stuff), changes the gameplay completly. And counter play is almost impossible against a "try hard" nurse. idk, she's in a weird spot, a teleporting killer could fit, but not in this way. A rework wouldn't really fit. If anything she shouldn't have been added to begin with, but, you know... :/
---
I don't think that good or OP are the options we are looking for here. Having ms slower than the Nurse would be horrific.
---
Basically yeah. You need 2 iridescent 2 gold to double pip if I recall for red rank killer. And you get iridescent sacrifice emblem if you get 9+ hook events. The gatekeeper emblem score is dependent on if the survs are doing gens or not. It‚Äôs basically chance.
---
Wraith is usually guaranteed a free hit if you have the right add ons though, so he makes chases shorter
---
ultra graphics 100000
---
A great Billy accomplishes the same thing and it makes both sides feel fair
---
There's this whole love/hate thing going here but I honestly enjoy this game and I play it almost every day. 
---
If you are a horror genre fan it's a good fit. I never even played online before Dead by Daylight, I just loved the concept.
---
I'm playing killer not survivor so I can't do that
---
Deadass had this experience, and got farmed by my teammates twice, barely managing to escape the second time. They got put on the hook the second I opened the exit gate
---
I ran back and unhooked them, taking the double hit and getting sacrificed so they can escape. They better be grateful.
---
In what planet does Hillbilly win on Haddonfield?
---
Are you upset he's losing his aura reading?
---
I try to crouch as much as possible. When I‚Äôm not hunting a survivor I crouch and patrol gens that way they won‚Äôt run away when I get near, then I ambush and chase them. Save your bear traps for later in the game or for people who pose a bigger threat than other. That‚Äôs how I play
---
There‚Äôs more of them than there are survivors.  So she would have to not go for them on purpose.  At that point you should realise you‚Äôve got a farming killer.
---
It does hinge on the addons for ghostface sometimes too because a few of the more rare ones add time to reveal him. Plus because lean stalking is much more efficient, you are revealed in just about the same time he may be needing to stalk you up. What‚Äôs dangerous is you also don‚Äôt know how close you are until you get exposed. Just try to keep vigilant and keep out of dead zones.
---
If you have not unlocked a survivors' teachable perks, and if you want those perks, then yes. Otherwise, just play whoever you want.
---
These idiots who barely make it out and talk shit are my favorite. It‚Äôs just like there on autopilot no matter how the game goes with there insults.
---
tysm!
---
that is EXACTLY what he is
---
bang bang
---
Against the 90% of survivors who suck/play solo/play SWF for fun
---
Damn that‚Äôs a whole book
---
Corrupt only lasts one minute man
---
let's go outside and throw the ball around sport
---
Not cleansing.  She has to chase you. 
---
Cleansing.  She doesn‚Äôt have to as she can insta down you from across the map.  
---
If you‚Äôre cleansing.  You‚Äôre basically going after a combination of The Huntress,   And Leatherface.
---
All my hillbilly games ever
---
This happened to me earlier today too. It was against a Spirit and she DCd after probably around 8 minutes of pure chase and looping, and I depipped.
---
This is glacial isn‚Äôt it?
---
Only takes 20 seconds to get from side of map to side of map.  Even less on some maps.  I‚Äôd say the only exception is the game because of the map layout.

---
And why should that 10% be uncounterable? She shouldn't exist, I agree, but neither should SWF. If one disappears than the other should too
---
yep
---
Well, I hate it. I only played him to get his perks to teachable, and then I dropped him like a steaming pile of trash.
---
True talent just uploaded a game recently where he got iridescent chase against a spirit
---
How do you juke and get no evader emblem?
---
Susie machine broke
---
Even so. If you‚Äôre just aiming up and blindly puking.  High chances you‚Äôre going to hit someone.  At that point.  You know roughly where they are. Just throw up the same way and boom.  They‚Äôre down.     If the first throw up didn‚Äôt insta down them already that is.
---
I mean maybe I've just never been abused by this insta down from across the map because whenever I go against her corruption I still tend to lead a chase 
---
I've just personally never had a game where not cleansing was a better option
---
The specifically added the blindness because of this strategy. SWF would have one object of obsession and they would sit in a locker and  tell their team where ever the killer was going. Or they would simply just hop in a locker really quick to see where the killer was and then get out.
---
I was gone for about... 8 months, did Spirit get any changes? I can't play a single lobby against one without at least two DCs
---
Master the art of The Pig &amp; join me as Prestige 3 Level 50 Rank 1!
---
You can easily hide behind anything when she‚Äôs puking that far away
---
Usually when I‚Äôm patrolling I‚Äôll stand up when I‚Äôm far from a gen then I‚Äôll crouch when I‚Äôm a distance near it, is that a decent habit to at least pick up in gameplay?
---
you saw the latest halloween, right? and yknow tapp died??? laurie even successfully raised her own daughter to be a fighter...
---
You all seem to act as if 150ms vs 100ms stun time reduction is the equivalent of 150 ping vs 100 and 1.46 m/s vs 1.44 m/s. They are not. You are just delusional if you actually think they are comparable.
---
Wait, what does p3 means?
---
yep, thats how a good ranking System works, duh
---
I hope to eventually. Pig is really fun. Plus Amanda
---
Clown is ok for anti looping an has no fucking map pressure at all. I personally put him at almost the worst tier of killers.
---
This game would die without SWF. Playing with others is a huge part of what makes survivor enjoyable. In my opinion killers need quite a few buffs/ QOL changes and then anyone queuing solo as survivor needs buffs like some sort of built in bond/ totem counter and more general information. Trying to balance the game around SWF hurts solo queue so much.
---
What is blood hunt?
---
doing that is not being a good guy,
---
she is deranking on purpose to bully killers. Bullying 9 and saying ohh, I feel bad for this one, let's give him something, doesn't change the fact that she is doing bad.
---
Then you‚Äôre not going up against very good killers.  Even with every video I watch I always see the smart ones never cleanse.    This is why monto made a video about making the survivors cleanse. Because he knows that the best way to deal with the plague is to take away 1 of her powers.    What good is a killer without their power?
---
This cat meme will never not be funny.
---
"Chebse Borgor" how can you not laugh at that lol
---
You do see her archway of vomit right?
---
You need to treat him like MM, do not let him stalk you, dont try to out stalk him, look around and when you see him run and crouch behind cover then start crawlinf away and reveal him when you can, at all costs avoid being revealed.
---
Walls exist
---
Firstly, I never said the 10% should be uncountable, so stop putting words in my mouth.
---
Secondly, most people play SWF to have fun, not be OP looping machines.
---
Third, something has to be done about Nurse and tryhard SWF. The new loops seems promising to help against strong survivors, but we'll have to wait and see
---
I would even say 15 seconds
---
Thank you üíñ
---
lol well i hate his perks and love his model. Opposite views on that end

Looks great. Can‚Äôt wait to see your take on legion and piggy!
