Wait. BHVR wonders all those things? Did the devs say something??
---
---
---
I would say he’s fairly balanced but he’s just not desirable to play, but I think it’s also due to the fact that it was so hyped up when he came out and now the hype has died
---
I mean, I’m only Rank 5 Survivor so maybe my opinion isn’t as valid as a Rank 1’s, but I’ve had a huge amount of matches here Killers *didnt* run Ruin and destroyed us, even when we all worked really well together (I usually solo queue but sometimes SWF), idk in my experience Killers have won pretty easily without Ruin so whilst I understand the general consensus, I don’t necessarily agree with it. 
---
I *hate* facecamping though, I’ve never gone against a Killer who got more than one kill when they facecamped.
---
I am not sure. It is possible but it looks like it caused everyone else in the lobby to end up disconnecting aswell.
---
This is why I bring Discordance.
---
&gt;Konami needs the cash
---

---
I think your idea is alright, but this is just objectively wrong lol. They've been making more and more money every year the last 5 years. Pachinko and their mobile games make them millions
---
For the Let There Be Light, Could you sub in Better Together for Bond?
---
Yeah except the fact that survivors complain at low rank because they are not good at the game.
---
You tell low rank survivors to “git gud” but then they complain even though they are the reason they don’t rank up. Yeah you need the cooperation of 3 other people but if all low rank survivors stopped yappin saying “KiLlErS oP nErF pIg” then they would actually get better at the game.
---
But no they would rather have BHVR give them more crutches and making killers lives miserable. And at high ranks you can’t just Git Gud, you have gotten good, then game is just so imbalanced once survivors also Git Gud, you have no chance.
---
Yeah he should be able to teleport across the damn map because having zero terror radius and being exposed in 5 seconds isn’t enough. 
---
Stick to memes because these clown comments aren’t cutting it.
---
Dead by daylight is only fun with friends imo.
---
The true intention of your surgery
---
The problem with the above scenario is that it proposes a game where all four survivors are not only very skilled, but are also coordinating their planned efforts (likely through outside communication) and make no mistakes; meanwhile, the killer in the proposed game is not particularly skilled or capable of flawlessly executing their plan (if they have a plan at all).
---
You can't plan game balance around the assumption that 100% of survivors are going to be perfectly coordinated, especially when doing so requires third-party support. Also, if you put four top-tier players against one top-tier player, it shouldn't be a surprise when it's difficult to balance the game and you should expect the side with more collective skill to win more than half of the time.
---
I for one am overjoyed that BHVR isn't building their game around something that will only happen in 0.1% of matches.
---
No, I don’t think I will.
---
Normal hag is scary enough. :P

I hate posts like this. The game isn't very well balanced. It doesn't matter which side you play, you're still going to have the occasional game where you get absolutely destroyed. 
---
Imo the game is about as balanced as it ever will be right now.
---
Also, you should never be chasing one survivor for 80 seconds. If that's happening to you then you need to get better, especially if it's a common occurrence for you.
---
*Zooms off into the sunset, never to be seen again*
---
Oh, well fuck 'em tbh. I can understand dabbing on people who use the 2-3 blending outfits, but there's no reason to bully normal Claudettes.
---
I feel so BAD as a high rank killer. I busted my tail and I'm on the cusp of 18.
---
I hit rank 14 as killer for the first time today, and suddenly 2 gens are done before I find someone, then a third pops while in my first chase.
---
I got two hooks in the whole match. I guess I need to level hag now
---
tbh in the lower ranks, my duo partner and I always run kindrened and open handed. 32 meter radius to see the killer if I am hooked as well as give information to all other survivors really helps a lot in communication and organization to save while not to waste time.
---
This is why dead hard is still so strong, you can use it early and loop longer at pallets without wasting and maybe make it to a new loop and save pallets. It’s such a resourceful tool.
---
Ping is relative, so...
---
Based purely on playing matches?
---
800 XP per rift fragment, 10 fragments per tier, 5-600 XP per match, plus 300 XP for your first Killer and Survivor matches.
---
First Survivor and Killer match each give 1 fragment, thus we need another 8 for the tier. 8 x 800 = 6,400 XP needed. 6,400/550 = 12 matches. 
---
So that means 14 total matches per tier.
---
However, that fails to account for Archive challenges and the free tiers you get for reaching the epilogue of each Tome level.
---
I’m a killer main but I just don’t care about what either side thinks about the other I just play the game.
---
My comment isnt a joke he needs some form of mobility so he can pressure the map as without map pressure it's hard to win at high ranks any killer without any mobility options will struggle.
---
My suggestion is to give him the ability to his in lockers and teleport to other lockers and he will needs to have his power meter be full to activate it.
---
I maxed it out too, still didn't do anything.
---
Glad we could sort that out, too many discussions on this sub degrade into childish squabbles
---
Go into a custom lobby and click and hold on the killer to rotate them
---
Honestly as a player with lots of time on every exhaustion perk, you nailed it
---
That's what I'm saying. BHVR would rake in cash. Konami does not care about anything except pachinko machines.  We need this killer and map. The chapter can be called Chapter # Survivors Guilt. I luv this idea.
---
When I first read this I thought you were making a joke and meant it actually spawns on the walls. Maybe that was the joke idk I’m such a normie
---
For me the hype has never died. I’m a frikin huge fan of Stranger Things and this is my favorite dlc for this game. But yeah it’s sad. I’ve only gone against a Demogorgon once and I managed to escape along with a meg because he kept camping the other two. And that was almost a week ago, I haven’t seen a Demogorgon since then.
---
How does that make any sense. You get a permanent 15% speed regression because they cant heal
---
Nea has only been the problem survivor for a year or so...ever since Noob3 became popular, really. Back in the day there used to(and still are) groups of Ochido fanboys who'd all play Claudette, use instablinds, and teabag everywhere. This is the reason why Claudettes are hated...they used to all be toxic assholes(of course some exceptions here and there...).
---
Just upgrade her to lvl 40 and get that self heal perk
---
That's what YouTube and 2500 hours do to you.
---
Don’t get too thirsty. Then your fridge will be really empty. /s
---
^ This is the best way to go about it! ^
---
Oh yeah, huh that’s kinda weird
---
link?
---
Now why the hell would ANYONE want to go above rank 8 in this game?
---
Yeah, basically there's 2 gens left, they feel cocky on an unhook or get a little too far from pallets. If survivors are being too cocky I'll see the runner (because they're teabagging on a hill or near a loop) and the 4th guy will go for the unhook. No gens being done so it's like 2 more hooks minimum. 
---
Usually I'll have 2 slugs and a hook after the poorly executed save attempt and then I'll chase the runner risk free.
---
Most games I can win if I can kill 1 survivor with 2 or 3 gens left, even if I'm just having fun with wraith and getting stomped.
---
Also 1 hook + 1 slug is almost always better than 2 hooks no slug. You can really slow down gens in the mid game by keeping some survivors on the ground while you hunt
---
Well he might be doing a lot of acting for the new stranger things chapter so he’s not popping up to much so if that’s the reason I for give him
---
You need more awareness. It's not even about breaking off the chase. It's about knowing to chase the survivor towards unchecked gens so you can kick them/hit other survivors and then continue the chase. 
---
Gen pressure is the first step in getting hits, downs, hooks, and finally deaths.
---
I was gonna reply something similar but I didn’t want to waste my time. There isn’t a counter argument to saying it only applies to a certain rank. You prove your point to be circumstantial and limited when you have to divided a group up just to make your point have any validity. If gen speed was such a big issue, every rank would have the same complaint and BHVR probably would have changed by now.
---
Not to be rude, but can you quote where exactly the devs have said this?
---
You're playing a horror game. If you don't want to look at disgusting things and listen to disgusting sounds, you should probably delete the game and buy The Sims. Everything is cute af.
---
Absolutely no worries!
---
why didnt u guys just do totems tho? i realize u didnt except his strategy and thats fair, but i find that people usually do totems to get more BP when the killers afk
---
If your metric for game balances involves matching up against an entire optimized team build using third-party apps to coordinate, you clearly don't know what a balanced game is.
---
I think it should just increase efficiency which makes it use less charges.
---
The dudes still living in 2016 lmao
---
Just a shame its 100% up to Konami lol. Them getting into video game horror would be HUGE! another kickass idea would be resident evil 2 chapter, killer beingThe Tyrant, survivors Leon and Ada or Claire and a raccoon city map
---
This exact thing has happened to me before. I swear dev's knew what they were doing making that drop, lmao.
---
I run chlorophobia and thanatophobia with iridescent button and etched ruler and it slows the game down quite a bit.
---
Escort should be the rework of baby sitter
---
Then she bumps into you and hits you.
---
It was on Peanits twitch stream. I didn’t clip it. But I’m sure he’ll confirm if you ask him.
---
It depends on when they came out, 
---
Pre-Store:
---
Common- stock cosmetics
---
Uncommon- dlc cosmetic packs
---
Rare-prestige
---
Very Rare- legacy prestige
---
Ultra Rare- event exclusive cosmetics
---
There’s also “artifact” these where given to specific people, popular dead by daylight content creators. They don’t make these anymore
---
Post-store:
---
Common- recolors
---
Uncommon- retextures
---
Rare- new models with multiple color variants
---
Very Rare- new models that typically only have one variation.
---
There are plenty of exceptions to these rules but I generally believe this is how they are organized.
---
There’s also “event” rarity, but I think you can figure out how those work for yourself.
---
I haven’t figured out how trinket rarities work though, I’d love to hear if you have any ideas
---
Seeing as how a 4 man SWF meta with comms is only beatable with Spirit and maybe Nurse.. yeah I’d say it’s a good place to start. Why would you not balance the game around the best there is?
---
PLEASE PENNYWISE and yes I agree most likely unlicensed
---
Blood warden is deadly, especially paired with noed
---
It's simple: Survivors want all killers to be 110% movespeed no power m1 killers they can bully all day. Killers want all killers to be Nurse.
---
Teach me.
---
Never forget the obnoxious voice changing Jason's.
---
Is there an indicator that you are playing with Windows Store players? I have played around 20 games since the crossplay feature and everything looks and feels the same.
---
There is not much secret on pop,just use it on a gen with some progress
---
He got blessed by our lord and saviour Matthieu Cote. Next time try to pray before you hit ready.
---
Listen to the original song. There’s an awesome verse that mentions all the killers. They didn’t use it in the music video.
---
Is this the same straw poll posted to r/Oinkers_? Cuz if it is that explains all the pig mains.
---
I did listen to the original. It's a shame they didn't use that verse but I like what they did instead
---
Meh. Most killers at the high ranks just use the highest tier killers with OP addons and offerings so what's the difference letting pad players play with Mouse-Keyboard players since we are getting demolished already on PC.
---
For the "kill all survivors *by any means*" challenge, disconnects count.
---
Where pop is good is in three gen situations so pick 3 and defend with pop but of course if you have a pop and you see a gen with some progress might as well give it a kick

The whole song is the same except for that missing version. They just cut it. Maybe because they couldn’t recreate all the killers for the live action music video.
---
Either way, still a good song
---
I'm not saying it doesn't happen but. I am constantly a solo survivor high rank and the killer wins a fair amount of the time. I just personally don't know why this sub thinks killers are reds are like 20% winrate or something it's probably 50-50 imo lol

Dude if fucking remember that Jurassic Park 3 arcade game from Pizza hut. Nostalgia overload
---
Its only game why you have to be mad?
---
If they have any sort of common sense they can be pretty strong lol
---
There's a lot of potential options.  Could make it so some of the generators need a spare part that can be found in multiple locations in order to fully power them up.   Could give the Killer the ability to power down one Generator if enough time elapses without a new one being powered.
---
Could also have side objectives like totems or the various killer mechanics.  Could also do something like Deathgarden where there's objects that both sides could benefit from depending on who finds it/takes it first.   
---
Another idea could be having map-based things that folks can do to open up a new area or so on.  An example would be if The Game had a section closed off until Survivors are able to turn a switch on similar to the exit gates.
---
Why isn't everything in Comic Sans? xD
---
Remember when you played Legion, you had a 93,5% chance to trigger a DC? I member.
---
I had this happen last night, it was me and another survivor and I'm being chased, I hear the last part of the gate by me opening but then the survivor opening it ran off, killer switched to her and downed her...I hit the gate button and it instantly opened. She had a good 3-4 seconds before I got there and we probably both escape. Unfortunately the killer camped her so I had to ditch her but I still don't get why she left it at like 99.9%
---
I don't make fun of but I instantly feel bad because I know the gens will get fucking smashed
---
Should i save or should i go..
---
Should i save or should i go now
---
If i save i can get in trouble
---
But if i go i miss some points
---
Should i save or should i go
---
This is all assuming the survivors are competent. But yes, it would be nice if ruin wasn't mandatory for most situations, same with noed.
---
what..
---
Insidious Bubba never made sense. All that waiting for what, one kill?
---
I've ran into a spirit with Noed, Rancor, Haunted Grounds AND Devour Hope. Unfun as fuck but then we ended up farming cause they felt bad.
---
WORST IDEA EVER.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You're cuddling new survivors too much this way. having to do 3/9 gens is also a torture for killers, how are newbie killers suppose to get their "wins" or even learn the game, you can't 3 gen, you have way more gens to patrol and if you follow a survivor too long and all gens pop because they only need to do 3.
---
I don't have an idea on how you can balance this problem, but I know it's NOT that.
---
Go fuck yourself. Actually. Daddy Kenneth is sexy and arousing and you know it
---
Considering this was after a long night of hard losses, I likely would have died for real.
---
Eh, I think diversifying the types of gens would be a bad idea.  But there could be things like fuel that generators require, and only the generators spawned closest to Survivors start off pre-fueled or w/e.  So for the other ones Survivors would need to be scouring the area to prep the other generators for repair.

There are no rules, he can play the we he wants to

---
It really isn't if they don't bother healing. It's, what, 12 extra seconds on a gen at tier three if everyone's injured? And much much less for actions like cleansing or healing. It's very miniscule.
---
Beetlejuice

---
I didn’t think to clip it. So it’s honestly my word against his should Peanits choose to deny what he said on stream.
---
i mean.. i like em.. i got a chase build for him that works super well
---
Oh hella yes
---
Doesn’t mean I can’t call him a trash noob
---
this would be really good wit the halloween event
---
I'm not the kind to run early so when it procs I'll know the direction they are generally in so I have a decent sense of where they'll be coming from if they do find me. I'm only rank 12 ATM since I've had the game for a week but I've been a vet of the cat and mouse genre for a while so I have a sense of when to be spooked and when to just be on alert. I'm also playing as a lvl 50 Steve Harrington with no other talents from other survivors unlocked. What would you recommend as a good loudout to practice with for higher
---
Might i also suggest giving him Heelys
---
Jason jorhees but thats not happening
---
I got to rank one with resilience and spine chill.
---
why does leatherface’s chainsaw make hillbilly’s chainsaw’s noise this is making me uncomfortable
---
I play both, but idk why I'd be triggered. It's true, I choose not to play against a killer with 0 counterplay.
---
Hag has never been a strong killer tbh. It’s hard to get map pressure unless you are constantly hitting survivors/kicking gens. 
---
Hag isn’t as perk reliant as she used to be but they make her job much easier
---
Lol fuck off
---
screw 360s, we only do 420s now
---
I’m new to the game and always use deja vu.. what’s so bad about it?
---
Lol survivor policing is just as real.
---
Yeah except when you go against a team that realizes that healing is pretty pointless and just sits AFK on gens.
---
I main Bill as survivor and use the P3 head.  It works for the character.
---
No.
---
Perfect! This is what I was looking for. Thanks
---
It turns out in my video where it took 30 seconds, we had tool boxes out. So my bad on that.
---
Relate, i sadly can
---
Base kit is garbage. Which other killer has a power that drains on normal attack hits? Whats the point of hitting a survivor twice with their power if it does nothing.
---
Maybe it's just because Killers are better at this rank, but I'm seeing way more terrible loop play at purple ranks than I did in the greens and yellows.
---
Lmfao!!! This killed me
---
This is why I like playing wraith. Fun for me, refreshing for everyone else.
---
The real problem is people who wait till the match is fully loaded, DC then have the last person hatch escape so you Depip
---
He's right, he's allowed to camp. It means he's bad at killer, but he's allowed nonetheless.

Imagine complaining about hope, SWF using perks and medkits. And then saying that killer mains dont complain while complaining?? Yikes.
---
If you think you “need” to run ruin, you should exam how you pressure the map. No one “needs” ruin they just need to pressure the map better.
---
Absolutely. I dont play as much as I used to but I usually find losses as killer far less infuriating than I do as survivor. In my case I think its because I'm a much worse killer than survivor so when I lose it feels like its much more my fault than bs thing #307 that I couldnt control.
---
The same people that think Killers using perks that wouldn't be meta on anyone else on that specific Killer to synergize really well with their kit are OP and "boring". (i.e. STBFL on Pig and Demo, Surge/Nurse's Calling on Ghostface, Sloppy and Thanata on Legion, etc.)
---
Killers make a ton of BP without BBQ, it’s just nice to get extra which is why you run the perk besides it’s aura reading ability. It should still take a perk slot like WGLF &amp; NOLB.
---
To be fair he’s right. It’s not fun and it’s boring but I dont get where this came from that survivors get to dictate how the game should be played.
---
Most killers hate looping when they start. Then they learn to deal with it. However survivors learn to abuse the most broken loops in the game, which isn’t fun for the killer either.
---
Is this allowed? He did this for about 2 minutes straight, I only caught the end of it.
---
Legit never here’s about 1 survivor complain about plague once. She’s so averagely mid tier it’s comical.
---
Not edited btw!
---
can I be a part of this, please? uwu
---
I run a similar build, but instead of Thrill I use 3rd Seal. I find that it really throws them off.
---
huh
---
perhaps affected her too much, my new ketamine concoction has
---
Sorry im doing the only objective in the game.
---
I clicked here expecting a great big pair of tits. I was disappointed.
---
I don’t play any of those killers lol. I main Freddy, Trapper and The Pig. I also like to play Legion for BP &amp; Doctor is also really good for BP. (:
---
Haha, got ant pictures?
---
My man.
---
Dude, they should add a map with Vigo that has lighting like that..  
---
Like, the void as a map, and killers would just look like this by default there.  
---
Husks of past survivors laying around everywhere, broken building and sceneries that ain't correct..etc
---
Do you mean you camped two person in the basement when the exit gates are powered? What they used and how they timed their gens isn’t relevant here, “gen rush” is just survivors playing really well. but I don’t see what you did wrong regardless.
---
"You didn't apply enough pressure 4head." Because Wraith and Legion are the best at map pressure and I clearly don't know how to play them. I'm in the "Ruin isn't necessary and shouldn't be, but you need to snowball HEAVILY to to adequately." I've never found Ruin fun and only use it on Plague with Thana and Dying Light, I usually prefer Devour Hope because I find it a lot more fun to play with, so basically every match turns into "If my totem gets destroyed before I get 3 tokens I need to play my ass off to win." So I have basically a 50/50 shot at doing well.
---
In a realistic scenario where survivors play decently you need ruin if you play anything under top tier killer.
---
Same, although my first game ever as killer was with Legion at rank 20 on the day of rank reset and got a 4K. Not the most skilled players other than 1 guy from like R14 probably but it made me like the game a lot more as a new player.
---
While I'm normally against camping, when the exit gates are powered and you have no other objective what are you supposed to do. Ignore the salty bois.
---
that’s hot
---
iv never played a non solo game, what’s it like?
---
somethingsomethingendlessbitchingaboutoldDS
---
You have no idea how many times this has happened to me when I play killer.One time when I played as Billy and didn't even bother using my chainsaw, 3 gens were done real quick I thought it was gg, then for some whatever reason the entire team just goes to negative IQ and all rush to rescue 1 person from hook.....and by miracle I got a  4k,with 1 PERK.
---
Right back at ya’ 😉
---
Not my fault that proxy camping is popular, although it is avoidable at times. However, if its a killer that is proxy camping and deliberately tunneling you after being unhooked, regardless of BT, DS, etc. I wouldn't be mad if the survivor getting camped/tunnel disconnects. Does it suck for the other survivors? Hell yeah, but I wouldn't be mad about it.
---
When the exit gates are powered all bets are off. They could just leave and take their win. They’re not entitled to a free rescue.
---
I see what you mean, but "Claudette is 7 years old and yet she feels very alone" to me is way better, even in the context of the writing pov. There are a lot of books written with this same tone but they are far more interesting and less cringy, and i think its probably because they dont rely on the same literary strategies over and over again. Its hard to get through any of the writing atmospherically, because it just ruins any immersion when they all are written like that.   
---
I feel like all these entries could be boiled down to like 4-5 sentences rather than like 2 paragraphs, and with that extra space you could tell some more interesting story tid bits. Instead it feels like its just padded out content.
---
Thanks.
---
You kill anyone though? I'm not good enough to get to purple ranks but I'm apparently good enough to kill red and purple ranks.
---
yeah definitely!
---
The problem I have with this math is that it completely ignores so many factors. Yes, if survivors literally want to end the game as fast as possible and they are coordinated and all spawn next to separate gens then they can do it really fast. But the reality is this doesn't happen that often because even really good survivors don't just sit there and do gens. Doing gens gets you basically nothing in terms of points. You won't even get a pip if all you did was sit on a gen all game. You will win, but you'll have nothing to show for it. So survivors will do other shit, break totems, search boxes, get someone off a hook, work on the same gen instead of splitting up, take hits, purposefully get in a chase to pallet stun and otherwise get their points up, etc. And survivors that spawn together and rush to do the three closest gens to them will just 3/2 gen themselves, giving the killer an easily defensible position since he can now completely ignore half the map.
---
You can't do this math in a vacuum. This isn't an argument against ruin, its just an argument against bad assumptions.
---
I can’t read your whole flair so I don’t know your opinion on blendette and entity nea jokes
---
I would hate permanent whispers. I messed up my hearing somewhat because of concerts. So now, if there are too many overlapping noises, I can't hear anything. 
---
Whispers effectively makes me oblivious to any other sounds in the game when it activates.
---
Haha. Someone said during the stream that when it was just the small webcam box, in the right light it was almost uncanny. I just happen to have tattoos on my left arm and everything.
---
It probably shows the survivor lagging. If my connection is bad as a killer I can tell.
---
Idk why but when I run sloppy butcher and discordance, it doesn’t matter what my other two perks are I always get at least a 3k (I usually run mad grit and iron grasp for convenience)
---
I WANT ONE NOW TAKE MY MONEY NOW DAMN IT! I'LL USE NOED ON YOU IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME ONE!  Can you make a  Totem one?
---
Killer rule #50 don’t try and survive at all it’s not fun to kill you then
---
Yeah it was visible at one point I don’t know what changed but I said they aren’t funny.
---
no nut november no nut november!
---
No. Worst version on worst system,
---
Unless you are playing specific killers Ruin is kind of a must to run if you want any chance at a win as killer as soon as you are out of potato ranks. You know it won’t last long they’re going to find it and many survivors are good at skill checks but it does often give you some breathing room at the beginning of the game. If you don’t run some kind of slow down perk you’re often going to be struggling unless you’re playing Billy, Nurse, Spirit.
---
Relax, not everything is about yourself
---
12 seconds plus ruin and pop adds up; I dunno, it seems strong to me.
---
Death I will get

Throw a xenomorph in, I'd be super into that. Though the more realistic option would be pennywise.

It looks good, although he does seem to have the expression of not getting enough sleep and taking too many pallets to the face. I like it.

As a rank 10 survivor who consistently gets rank 16 teammates I can confirm
---
Your logic could not be more wrong. Of all the killers you mentioned the only one who has to collect their own traps in order to place them is trapper, continuing grasping for straws if you want I guess but this is not the same thing. 
---
I agree with your bottom message fully.
---
Lol yeah, it might also still be visible on desktop, I’m on mobile iOS
---
Nobody ever tried getting four blendettes to hide in bushes and then ambush him by shining flashlights in his eyes while one of them beats him with a pallet
---
It isn’t that bad I enjoy it just needs some patching
---
Don't forget to chase survivors towards unchecked gens. It scatters the other players, often nets you a free hit, and you can kick the Gen. 
---
It also gives you the chance to chase someone else.
---
 why is that I don't really care on visuals being downgraded
---
Do you know how long I've been playing this game only to just now learn this?
---
Personally I like quick matches. That's why I don't like Friday the 13th. Among other reasons...
---
Honestly Fixated is probably my most favorite of the new perks to come out.  Makes playing with a Killer's line of sight so much better with that increased walk speed if you're hiding around tall objects, and sitting on Sprint Burst doesn't feel as painful.
---
I liked the movie.
---
Lol it's a game
---
As a Nea main who puts Urban on everything I don't DC just because spirit but god damn if she isn't the bane of my usual strategy...
---
Nostromo map would be sick, exit gates are escape pods and special generators open doors like in other maps.
---
1) Get visibility perks
---
2) follow Discordance as soon as it fires
---
3) Feral Frenzy as many people as you can
---
4) Hook anyone you can catch after that
---
5) Follow your visibility perks
---
6) Magic happens
---
7) 4k
---
Go to Dead by Daylight support but idk if that's banable... Especially since you don't have the full thing it's impossible to know for sure how long he had u there.
---
[removed]
---
I am as well, I think I fixed it. It’s mostly visible in my original comments instead of thread comments.
---
Never tell Reddit not to downvote you
---
This is kate after she got jacked because she got tired of dying. X gon give it to yah.
---
It’s a very useful perk on high/mobility killer like Spirit, Billy, and Nurse but good on everyone else as well now that it lasts longer.
---
I personally like to run various perks with it like Brutal Strength, Thrilling Tremors, or Surveillance but it really is not necessary. 
---
As others said, don’t be afraid to hang onto it a bit and not use it on the first gen you see with barely any progress. Also if you down another survivor shortly after a hook, try to use it nearby before hooking them if you can, so you get another use out of it. This can be especially nice when you have really committed bold survivors that tap it right away to allow a second PGTW kick.
---
Yup, seems about right.
---
Facts dude survivors have it easy enough fuck them
---
You know your not wrong.  Lately I’m either crushing with a 4K or getting stomped myself by good coordination and solid plays.  Occasionally someone gets the hatch before I find it,  and sometimes on large maps someone might get a door open before I get there.  
---
Same on survivor.  My swf will leave killers on the dust all night one night,  next night we are saving each other and all injured with 5 gens to go. 
---
It’s been wild .
---
I always upvote Jojo/DBD content. It doesn't come up often...
---
I'll personally ask my good friend McCote and get right back to you buddy
---
Lol he’ll yeah
---
Sidney Prescott is so friikin h0t I’d main her for the rest of my dbd career
---
What’s proxy camping?
---
If you don't mind the Switch version being behind on updates, I'd say go for it. The game does have some frame rate issues on the Switch though, but I haven't found them to be so bad that it ruins gameplay.
---
Ghostface. Freddy
---
Give killers bonus BP based on how many people are SWF.
---
If you played Spirit you’d know perfectly well how to counter her
---
It’s an okay movie, just don’t expect to be terrified or anything
---
&gt;low rank killers use noed. 
---
And herebi an still getting matched with red rank killers using noed :(
---
I love reading these chapter ideas because the perks most of the time are awesome as well as the character ideas
---
Hit my Rank 1 on hag a year ago. Was... painful.
---
Yeah, I agree the devs should move swf to an unranked game mode (or just make it kyf) or at least introduce action speed penalties for it. Swf is a huge reason this game has so many imbalances and why it’s so unfun a lot of the time.
---
That’s not how it works
---
Remember when people played legion? 
---
Pepper Ridge Farm remembers
---
I'd just watch it but it's on you. Personally I like alot of movies/games ppl hate on for not being perfect or that get bad reviews.
---
Not every movie needs to be a perfect cult classic to get enjoyment out of
---
Why the hell didn’t your team finish the gens?
---
Iron Will gets coountered by stridor + she can still hear your footsteps.
---
 Spine chill is a smaller counter unless she moonwalks.
---
You dont exactly have time to stay still and study her body (And its still a 50/50 if she is Just faking the phase.) + she can just wear a cosmetic that covers the shards.
---
I think he is lethal but most people use him wrong and it leads to zero fun games.
---
Baby Wraith gives me life
---
Yeah as a Ghostface main that's a really bad assessment of his viability. 99% stalking a survivor is potentially your strongest tool in the game, especially if you do it on injured survivors because they won't expect to go down in one hit so soon after being healed. The "no stalk" shit that's on the rise is good but only when you don't know how to utilize stalk properly, players who do will dominate a game because either you ambush a survivor and shut down a chase before it even starts, or you don't give them that speed boost after being hit to get to the next loop.
---
Urban immersion means you deserve it
---
Because then solo survivors suffer even more If you balance it around 4 man swf. I don t even think all of you realise how bad solo survivor is. I would rather play as bubba vs 4 man swf and get 0 kills, then play as solo survivor with 3 randoms against good killers. And sad thing is i am red rank solo survivor who gets usseles team and a good killer. People think only killers suffer from swf, but solo survivors can suffer even more. My last game today was with rank 4, rank 13 and rank 14, because this meg thought that bringing her low rank friends to red ranks was good idea. So we played against freddy, and those 2 low ranks lasted in Chase litteraly around 30 sec or less, and game ended at 4 gens. So If devs want to balance around 4 man swf, i am ready to delete dbd with my 1100 hours, solo survivors alredy suffer too much, balancing around 4 man swf would mean death for solo survivors.
---
Yes and no. Yes because sometimes bullshit fucks someone over so they have to leave but a lot of the time people leave after getting outplayed or they see a killer they dont like playing against so they would just leave so its hard to say definitely do this because then people who play spirit would never get to play because they would get dodged all the time and thats not really cool (not defending spirit players but still)
---
I swear my teammates get worse in red ranks, they dc for any reason and try to be toxic even if it kills them.
---
You can also estimate the time she’ll take to go to a pallet if she faces, and stun her midphase
---
&gt; ecause then you can easily fuck lower ranks 
---
 
---
Oh well.. know what would fix that?  A real fucking ranking system so that lower ranks would be filled with lower ranks and it wouldn't be fucking anyone over. You balance games from the top down.
---
Bro I’m sorry for not upvoting but the number is too good.
---
An interesting Xeno passive would be where pallet stuns on him will destroy that pallet in 10 seconds (due to the acid)
---
I always assume the killer has some plan involving NOED when i see gens popping left and right with barely anybody being hooked, and make sure to run a lap or two around the map for totems before the last gen pops. Saved my ass a few times, but there's only so much i can do as a soloqueue. A totem counter would be a godsend to know at least how many totems have already been done by my teammates and not waste unnecessary time looking for totems that might not even exist anymore.
---
I wouldnt main the Samsung galaxy.
---
Feels like any killer with ruin pop and sloppy can slow the game down enough for a 4k tbh
---
You can see that they finished one, then he stopped like 5 seconds later.
---
I won that challenge because one person left before the game started, which caused the match to end right as it was suppose to start. Apparently that also counts as "killing all survivors".
---
Don’t need to, I’ve witnessed enough incompetence in real life to understand what ineptitude looks like. Just like I don’t need to be Gordon Ramsey to know a dish is shit.
---
Thana is seriously fucking awful even if you use it on Plague. It adds 3 whole seconds to the repair speed, oooooo time to go DC this game is never gonna be won now.
---
Yeah fair does.
---
Wasnt the data showing that certain killers underperformed on specific  maps and that maps were the biggest issue in determining  how many survived?
---
A survivor DC'd while it was loading but it hides who from the kiler
---
New DS is clearly intended to counter tunneling, which is something I think everyone can agree on is a fine balance for it.  Other than that however, no survivor perk should be able to stun the killer practically on demand.  I haven’t been stabbed by DS for tunneling in about a month.  It almost always happens when I’m dumpstering survivors too quickly, or a survivor wants to body block borrowed time so I wait it out then get stabbed after I down them.  
---
A minute is far too long, and killers shouldn’t have to eat DS when a survivor jumps into a locker.  DS also shouldn’t activate on end game collapse, because who else would m1 killers go for?  They have to hit survivors twice which is impossible when gates are open.
---
Had a game were me and my friends all played David with snow mither. Ended up being against a Myers on the stranger things map. We actually did ok, ended up doing like 4 gens before only one was left. Myers closed the hatch and my friend was at the gate. He ended up opening the gate just in time to dead hard out the door and Dodge a hit. Got his adept David king achievement, and hate mail from the killer
---
Oh hello there satan.
---
Where was the Killer? Peeing in the shack?
---
What rank were they lmao
---
The only killer we need is the Thing from the 1982 horror movie
---
You're not shocking them and acting as if it's hysterical?
---
One is horrific mutilation of the human body and the other is a natural function so yeah I guess you're right
---
That’s true. I’ve seen a number of people approaching red ranks with only around 250 hours played, which is low by DBD standards, and you see people with 2-4k hours at green ranks due to not playing much anymore.
---
Still theres a much higher chance of going against better survivors at high rank than low rank. The best players are often diehard players and boost to the top every month with thousands of hours played.
---
Here I was thinking this meme format died.
---
Why would you screenshot that?
---
P3 lvl 50 Hag and Cannibal  
---
Got some low lvl survivors.
---
Vommy mommy meow
---
why? i watch killer streamers and on high rank they shit on the survivors. if anything, the middle rank killers need +1 help, red rank ones do not, or they should just learn to play, the skill ceiling is there.
---
This \^. The difference between red ranks and purple ranks isn't looping skill. A lot of purples still loop decently enough but waste too much time not doing gens when they aren't being chased. Rank 1s aren't there because they optimize looping, although that helps. They're at rank 1 because they optimize the gens. They do things like repairing in the terror radius when they recognize the killer has tunnel vision, or running away from active gens when they get chased, or spreading the completed gens out to avoid a 3 gen. Looping without gen pressure is just useless and a waste of pallets.
---
Blind killer is a cool idea, but the mending thing is just Legion again so it'd have to be something else.
---
What it looks like to play him obviously can't literally be blind, but maybe he can see outlines of environment within \~12m (basically normal vision within that space). Outside of that range his vision is extremely blurry or even nonexistent. And his power would be to see **moving** survivors within that range.
---
His strength would be mindgaming (he can see moving survivors through walls) and his weakness would be patrolling (cannot see anyone unless close, simply standing still makes them invisible). He could compensate for his weaknesses with info perks like whispers, stridor, etc.
---
Counter play would be standing still to prevent detection when he comes to patrol or watching him from afar and rotating to stay out of his route.
---
I think the biggest thing that would make people salty is inability to escape from chases if his "vision zone" would be too big, since making that distance between you and him would be the only way to escape. So the distance of his "vision zone" would be the crux of his balance.
---
Sounds like rank 14 problems
---
Tbagging being toxic I understand. If someone is infinite looping you, then their just better than you. If you chase someone you can't catch that's your own poor decision, and not toxic gameplay. I say this as someone who, as a grey rank killer, frequently gives up chasing people I know I can't catch.
---
I struggle so hard with Legion most of the time. I clowned on one hard the other day, but other than that they stomp me into pieces. So fast. So stabby.
---
he caught you lacking &amp; peppered you with bottles to make sure you were an instadown, stop tryna get people banned cause a match left you salty
---
Plot twist, it'll be Cujo. Just a big, angry, rabid doggo chasing you through maps.
---
Jokes aside though, while I love Stephen King, I'd honestly love some of the more obscure properties. (Maybe not totally obscure, but the ones people don't think of as much until they hear about it and just 'Oh! yeah that exists and would be pretty damn cool')
---
If Stephen King though, I'd honestly like Jack Torrance. I may love cosmic monsters/entities but I have a weakness for realistic fear. People who just kinda go off the rails.
---
Eh, it was a good experiment for them regardless.  They learned quite a bit from it, like the fact that initially making it 30 vials earned on Killer and 30 earned on Survivor (instead of 60 shared between both sides) led to horrendous Killer queues.  
---
It was rocky as hell but it was a good learning experience for events.
---
I was playing Spirit against a pink-haired Nea with a flashlight earlier and I nearly shat myself but ... she didn’t even use her flashlight and died pretty quick. I was shook.
---
Stop bullying killers ffs.
---
Sloppy applies to the injury, but not to the deep wound. I.e. Mending is unaffected, healing is affected.
---
Yo! BHVR!! Ya'll need to talk to this gent &amp; make this a cosmetic ingame!
---
Ive had this recently. I fee the survivors still make what looks like boneheaded decisions at red ranks, sometimes they dont look to play much different to green ranks.
---
However the gens get done. Thats the difference. Even with a bad start for us, the gens get done. It actually shocks me how our survivor team wins sometimes. Ruin up, no gens done, 3 hooks for the killer....yet at least 3 of us escape.
---
All I can assume is that when not in a chase high rank survivors simply spend more time on gens. Lower ranks play more conservatively.
---
I feel offended...
---
Just got to 42 after my last match
---
Respecting pallets and trying to do mind games in situations where they had absolutely no need to do anything but circle me. I was trying to be too pro. Knowing when they are pressured enough to need a snap decision was a big upgrade in my murder ratio.
---
20 iirc
---
No one is really scared of this game at all, it's just not fun to play against anal beads for balance reasons.
---
Oh my god, you got downvoted for stating your personal opinion... who woulda thought
---
Fix spirit and freddy first. Then let's talk
---
It took your team two minutes to finish a single gen? Why didn't they cover multiple gens if he was so obsessed with you?
---
Red rank killer here.  
---
Yeah, I'll disengage and chase others and defend gens. I got that.  
---
Just infinite looper tbag swine taunting/swf bullying gets my goat.
---
I don't need to fly a helicopter to realize that a helicopter in a tree means the pilot fucked up.
---
Completed 21 yesterday
---
They can’t bust all their license nuts at once, so to speak. 
---
They need to be released intervaly to increase the player base.
---
People keep saying more objectives are needed, why not add one that forces interaction with the killer.  
---
Let's say 3/5 gens require a special part, and the killer has them, and the survivors need to "pickpocket" them by getting close enough to the killer to press interact and run off.  
---
This helps the killer by the survivors needing to actually play with them, and it gives survivors more blood points to get and a chance to show off teamwork.  
---
You could add on if the survivor is down with the item, they drop it so someone else can grab it.
---
They could just have it set up like Fortnite's crossplay though, in that if you party up with a friend from another platform you'll enter a crossplay player pool. Otherwise you only play with your own platform.
---
That way if people don't want to see other platforms they can just not play with them.
---
Also you get points for every bottle hit. Nothing wrong with farming, survivors do it at every exit gate every game.
---
*Spirit phasing noises, sounds of bill moaning in the distance*
---
I rarely play killer but honestly the only "toxic" survivors I ever seem to see are Meg. It's worse when you get a SWF of 4 Megs. Even then though I think I get your pain - I'll never fully understand taking things out on people who haven't done anything to you. I'm a bit of a bleeding heart though so that's probably just me.
---
Just keep going for it is all I can say. It'll be frustrating no doubt but not everyone is going to judge based on character alone!
---
Lol, I figured it would happen. This isn’t my first Reddit rodeo.
---
It certainly is. Thank you for noticing.
---
Spotted this in my feed. I still remember months ago, maybe over a year ago, where I was arguing with someone here about the same thing. That not counting travel time between generators, it was impossible for the Killer to get even a single kill unless the Survivors made the mistakes for it, and that's counting if the Killer is already playing perfectly. Playing Killer doesn't reward you for playing well because you're just a multiplier, the better you are, the worse a position the Survivors are in, but it also means you're entirely dependent on them making the mistakes in the first place. He tried and tried to argue but there's no refuting simple math.  
---
There's a reason I don't play this game anymore. Killer is what it is and Survivors are Generator Repair Simulator 2k1x.
---
Theres 1 other person alive dude lol
---
Currently less content then every other version, and has not been updated to recent content. Will probably be updated in the future, but currently garb.
---
dS oNlY wOrKs If YoU'rE tUnNeLiNg
---
That's different. This guy sat there for as long as he wanted. The points were unlimited. There's only so many points you can get from opening exit gates.
---
That wall of text is hard to unpack, so I’m just going to give a general response.
---
Pretty much every other competitive game is balanced around top tier play. Let’s take, for example, Smash Brothers. How is this casual game able to draw in casuals and hardcore fighting fans? They know how to balance the game.
---
What the devs need to do, honestly, is sit down and say “Hey. Why are top tier survivors only picking 5 - 6 perks. Why are killers only choosing 2 or 3 killers to play?”
---
It’s going to be a huge undertaking, because they’ve allowed the imbalance to go on for so long. But I feel if they just did incremental balance changes, it’d be good for everyone. 
---
You’ll see more perk variety as survivor instead of just Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing and Decisive Strike.
---
You’ll see more killer variety instead of Spirit with Haunted Ground, Ruin, Stridor and a flex perk.
---
There is a reason competitive players only pick one killer and just a handful of perks. There is a reason survivors only pick those BT, DS, DH and a flex perk. Those are the only things viable in competitive play. And that’s a symptom of imbalance.
---
Dude I love the pumpkin head movies I love trash, I just really dislike boring movies
---
I hit rank 6 the other day and SAME haha.
---
The Mori can just be the pachinko machine being slammed into you so you can die just as the franchise itself is.
---
(Please don't take that as genuine salt at Silent Hill I've loved Silent Hill since I was a teenager lmao)
---
Same, but the killer was waiting till I’m close to the exit to DC, RIP, I was laughing for a while after that tho
---
That sounds like something made up to fit the description
---
I see a lot of comments here along the lines of "play spirit get tbagged lol spirit mains". I don't understand this mentality. Like I get spirit can be unfun to go against but so is nurse? Leatherface can be pretty unfun once he slaps you on a hook. But do you really need to bully someone because of the character they play lmao
---
It’s the reason I truly believe rank doesn’t matter, besides maybe 1-4. If you just play enough and aren’t a dum dum while playing you can rank up. I’m the perfect example
---
&gt;Just curious how far along everyone else is
---
I started on 16, currently 44.
---
&gt;I play a decent bit each day but feel like I may not have time to earn all 60 serum that I want.
---
We will be getting more Tomes in November and December which will make going through the Rift significantly faster.

Bing bong, you are wrong

The fact you even have to say that speaks volumes.

How tf does this have this many upvotes with that cringe at the bottom
---
I never made it about me. I pointed out things that seem to hint at autism based on my own and other's experiences.
---
\^\^\^ if you look close enough, you can see that I'm already injured, lol.
---
New to PC version so I don't know how it was before but yes, 120 is as high as I can go.
---
EGC camping is fine. They can complain all they want. It's smart. I don't do it if it was a good game though, just to be polite. (Mostly if I need to guarantee no de-pip)
---
I got to rank 1 killer without Ruin because it's a boring anti-fun perk. I never needed it while I played there.
---
Theres no winning with entitled survivors. Just play whoever and have fun. People will always bitch about something
---
Im rank 2 at my max currently 4. I play GF with trues style and i get at least 2k's every game barring ones where i get completely clapped.  Its not possible to down a survivor that isn't complete ass or bad tile rng within 20 seconds. In a best case scenario you sneak up with 0 terror radius in their blindspot and get the hit on the gen because they saw you before you could grab.
---
Then they get to a pallet and unless its a weak pallet, you have to break or mindgame it, which usually isn't skill just a fuckup on the survivor. If you get the hit, then the chase is over and its been like 30 seconds. If you didn't then its the "can you hit them before the next tile rng spawned a pallet" or leave them to go check another gen.
---
Yall wanna complain about a 2minute holdup but be making killers wait almost the full 3 minutes every endgame collapse, "hE's dOiNg tHe oBjEcTivE" to use everybodies favorite excuse
---
I think it's like always coming back to the hook after going somewhere else
---
I want to get my s/o one with Jeff as the survivor instead
---
Perfect example why we need DC husks. 
---
4K all lined up but nah, you can get it completely taken away from you via exploitation of gameplay mechanics.

Whyd you make me fail nnn
---
Yet statistics show that average escape rates are literally at about 50%. 49-53% depending on the map,.
---
I acknowledge there is core issues with the game, but it's blown out of proportion. Statistics show average of Survivors escaping is half, with some maps being spot on 50%, which is exactly where escapes rates should be.
---
People need to realize there's a difference between p3/brown/green Claudettes and the default/cosmetic Claudettes
---
It's pretty much the same concept as Killer camping. Actually a liability, but seems rude.
---
Although pallet campers are great at eating hatchets, so Huntress mains love them.
---
Remember when people played literally anything other than Trapper?
---
Haha exactly plus there would be a skull to show it's an instadown
---
Man i'm not going to dc as a survivor that's some weak shit. The killer would have to bm or something.
---
Yay we weren't forgotten!!
---
At least they don't DC against Huntress.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Goodness how much do you play per day? I’m been trying to grind it out but it just isn’t working lol
---
Yes, i too am a Red rank player (both sides btw). You are literally just saying that you should Hope that the spirit isnt smart and Just tries to run trough the pallet. You also dont hear the sound of her phasing while you are in her TR
---
Every day.... If you are playing solo then always assume they have it and play smart during last few gens. If you are in a team why are you not doing totems? I don't expect 3 or 4k games. So don't expect to survive. I played solo to res ranks. I rarely ever get killed by NOED. When I do it's my fault. Stop blaming the killer. The devs gave massive points to do totems and we all know NOED exist and can out play it. Is NOED cheap? No. Is adrenaline cheap. No. If I tell survivors what perks to bring would any of you listen. Fuck no. Relax and let it go  . When I was a new killer I used NOED  too as a crutch. You learn to out grow it. When I was new as survivor I despised NOED till I realized that I play way to loose. Now I do totem and probably stoped NOED a 100 times. Not picking on anyone. Just saying you win some you lose some. I'm not a super good survivor but I know most of the time I get killed it was because was not played smart or not planning for end game. I always assume they have it.
---
ERRRHUUUURRRR REEEEEE
---
Mmm sexy finger dancing clowns
---
You could've healed them but they all DCd. :/
---
I know your pain
---
Best strategy as killer against swf is basically play dirty, mori for extra points.
---
U could hear it, unless she has prayer beads
---
When I first got this game I thought it was a fun and casual horror game to shit your pants too. I had no idea it would turn into a sweaty meta-filled esport that has toxicity that would make Chernobyl blush
---
Just get used to losing a lot.  
---
The more you lose, the more exp you get with her. You'll be better at timing, getting a sense of when to throw a hatchet, when to loop, etc..  
---
It's really just practice, if you wanna get good, prepare to lose a lot.
---
That's pretty much it. Legion isn't efficient, but can waste so much time fatigue sets in.
---
I usually main killer but even that's bs, unless the toolbox has that new gear or whatever it is, and even then that's mainly if the entire survivor group is armed with them.
---
Shit that looks scary.
---
Fo sho fo sho. Jumping in a locker with DS is the toxic thing. Just running it is fine.
---
I’m an idiot, can someone spoon feed me?
---
Her head looks like a mass of tumors
---
To a new player, being Killer might sound fun, though. Baby levels is where Killers have bad waits; newbies won't clutter red ranks further.
---
Killers also hear a special sound indicator telling them they found their obsession.
---
Scott Jund and ZubatLel are both top teir huntress players. I believe Scott has a tutorial on her.
---
Proximity camping, in my mind its where the killer 'circles' the hook to make sure they can intercept any unhookers and be close enough to go to the hook before the unhook to either tunnel or go for the unhooker. Scummy tactic. Tbh the word is thrown out too much imo, so others may have a better description.
---
Thank you.
---
Practice makes perfect 
---
Once you get a feel for her
---
It will payoff
---
However he's not holding the game hostage. It's the same as running around looking for totems when the gates are open.
---
Nah I don't like going against pigs, Michael's (cuz I'll just get tunneled if I juke them), ghostfaces. Don't judge me I need my heartbeat
---
It makes me mad that you ran by that flashlight without picking it up.
---
Damn I love it
---
Freddy's fine (minus the undetectable while asleep). The only problematic killer in the game right now is the Spirit. Nerf the Spirit and buff the rest of the killers and this game would be better for everyone
---
You not got anything to say to my point. Just proves your words are nothing but air.
---
Ok i agree that alot of killers need some kind of buff but it should come more in the way of an additional surv objective or longer gens. Spirit is a bit op tbh and doesnt require that much to hit the skill cap. Its hard to have fun after the 3rd spirit in a row at rank 1.
---
The game is super binary in a lot of ways. Like Otz demonstrates, if one round of Exposed gets everyone hit once, it's over barring Unbreakable.
---
And yet normally, it's 2 hits x 3 downs to kill one of four Survivors.
---
So 4-24 hits are required to 4K a game, assuming everyone hit goes down without healing.
---
Left behind gamer? That’s a new one
---
It's always the immersed Claudette for some reason
---
I don’t disagree when I first heard it, but it makes sense lol
---
she was a spirit and she acted like that wow lol
---
Since I started playing around a month ago, I don't think I've finished a trial as the hag with more than two people escaping, and get a 4k like every 2 games. It would happen more often if it wasn't for the hatch. Point being, the Hag is OP
---
I disagree. I am the definition of middling. I am not the best survivor by any means, I sit at rank 10 pretty easily. Freddy has the ability to not only place traps, but have a 2d FLAT noise that is quite obnoxious.
---
He can apply near infinite map pressure using the generator teleporting, and there are no counters to his fake pallets besides being awake.
---
e\_e
---
Even at red ranks. Both side use every advantage. Survivor mains will NEVER listen to what perks killers want you to run. I don't get why survivor mains expect killers to listen. It's not broken. I swear. I get killed by nurses calling way more then NOED. Think about it. You get unhooked. Run away and start to heal then boom down again. Nobody says shit about. NC. I think the mindset is if gens are done we won. No. If you piped you won. You don't have to escape to pip.
---
what are you a fuckin tibetan monk
---
Why did he bother exposing you? Lol
---
Level your killers to 20 :o give yourself a fighting chance haha
---
Loop next time?
---
Idk about a good huntress main to watch but I have 150+ hours with her. 
---
For add-ons, try to stick to the heads that cause exhaustion and mangled effects. 
---
For a perk load out, I use Ruin/Thanaphobia/pop goes the weasel/ sloppy butcher.
---
For tips:
---
Don’t spam hatchets. Use them to end chases and begin them. 
---
When you are in a chase, watch for when survs go for  pallets. When they throw them down, they pause and it’s a free hit. Same goes for vaults. The best advice I have for you is to play more. Learn how survs play and what they want to go for. Hard reads are a staple of huntress gameplay. The best times to go for a hatchet are when a surv goes for a vault or is running in open space.
---
Literally not mate, You dont hear her phasing sound if you are in her TR.
---
Any member of Legion would lose a fight to Ash, David, or Bill.
---
22 right now.
---
I figured....they should remove rank altogether. It doesnt mean shit at all. Im only rank 16 and i murdered swf before in red ranks. This game blow at matchmaking anyway and pairs you up with whoever is available.
---
This game is not even horror nor competitive. It's just a casual action type of game so if we make it so no rank system remains, then people will play to have fun and not betray or farm each other for points
---
If you grab a hatchet, Huntress immediately adopts you.
---
Thank you!
---
Feel free to check this from a year ago https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/community-community-data-requests literally all killers on PC have a 50% kill rate, which is what the devs see as balanced. Only a 1/4 of games have swf and that's only 2 man groups, not these mystical 4 man flashlight squads everyone claims they go against every game. If there's a known infinite, why are you chasing survivors around it? You and the original  commenter are making it seem like killers are getting beaten 30 seconds into the game with no kills. I also never said killers have the power role lmao.
---
So is the correct way to play Pig just finding people and being booped?
---
She's a little confused, but are we tired of this meme yet?
---
It could be with custom game
---
The other day I played a match with my friend against a Myers and my friend is on way higher ranks than I am because I’m still new to the game. I pallet stunned the Myers like three times then he snatched me up and moried me. I made him mad :”) (I died first too)
---
80 seconds isn’t even close to how long a low rank survivor can run a killer, it’s more like 10 if that. once you’re seen, you’re often downed in the next 10 seconds at the lower ranks, you don’t need noed or to facecamp at those ranks
---
Playing dead by daylight is definitely a game that blows your high
---
How would you have any idea? It's not like I play both sides, or in red ranks on both roles
---
Personally I'd read the wiki. The Nun had too many dumb parts for me to really appreciate, plus it's a Prequel anyway so going in anyone who paid attention to the story line already knew the outcome.
---
Absolutely correct. Not most but a large amount. That's not counting the salty ones that stay till the end just to whine.
---
You gotta understand that your teammates are people too. They aren't going to sit there and have someone ruin the game for them and just keep taking the abuse just so you can keep having fun. People play video games for their own enjoyment, not for the enjoyment of others.
---
Yes
---
I recently found out about 2 streamers who are rank 1 without running ANY slowdown perks. One of which is pig main.
---
Scorpionz and TSA_Matei. I jumped around their VoDs and sure enough they are maintaining rank 1 without ruin, pop, or whatever.
---
Yeah, but you can get that from Pig, Myers, GF, or the Spirit getting you in her terror radius. No need to keep things unbalanced.
---
Besides, she can keep beads; they just need a downside. Something thick and meaty.
---
People are skipping the learn to play against it phase. The killer looks stronger than it actually is. Without the OP addons, at least
---
Tbh I think it'd be so much funnier to have Cindy Campbell
---
Kinda makes up for him not being good in other areas.
---
🎵If I go there will be trouble🎵
---
If I save the killer will have noed and blood warden and we'll all be fucked
---
20 completed every challenge and played the hell out of the double exp weekend not confident I'll hit 70 before the rifts gone though :/ and I won't buy the pass unless I do
---
Welcome to Meta by Daylight.
---
JK it'll take you much longer than a night to farm out Ruin.
---
You have enough of a say to stop it
---
There are even more killers who would sit permanently in yellow ranks if you removed NOED from the game.
---
In that situation, it seems that the hooked survivor is quite far away and in the basement. You should go if you have borrowed, but if he gets downed by NOED I think it's best if you leave.
---
After getting five Spirits in a row earlier today, I would welcome a Trapper

Crossplay improved my queue times drastically. I don’t think they did that exclusively for friends playing at different platforms.

.....sigh. There is so much to unpack here that reading it started to give me a headache. ....No. just No. I'm out. 10/10 troll or worlds DBDs biggest dimwit.
---
It's basement trapper with honing stone
---
Detective's Hunch AND Small Game sounds like a passionate hatred for totems. The Killer didn't kill your family; Hex: Ruin did.
---
For maximum totem hate, have a friend bring Leader and follow you.
---
why not make different balances for different sets of ranks.  The subtle changes that need to be made would not over complicate things.  Be at most 3 different set of rules
---
Nephew delete this
---
High rank Killers is face Camp
---
Yeah uhhh I was already injured. That would not be an instadown.
---
...wait, then why is everyone a toxic douche to people 5 ranks below them?
---
I just thought about this today. So much lore there. Would benefit both companies in a way.
---
ive had people dc within the first minute &amp; stay 10-13 to talk shit in the end chat
---
I just googled it to see if anything was different and apparently in March this year they started automatically matching xbox and ps4 players
---
Bonus points if he had Blood Warden.
---
I played 8 games earlier. 6 trappers, one myers, one hag
---
I actually enjoy that a lot especially while playing killer. They are the easiest to mess with since they are just juiced up on rage.
---
great video, subscribed
---
Nah, it's legal to use the map. Just depressing to see.
---
Now TEABAGGING at those optimal pallets is punishable by death.
---
Idk man, Konami may suck, but ever since they went pachinko they need more money lol. How do you think Nintendo not only got Snake back for Smash, but also got two Belmont's as fighters with a Dracula boss, plus Alucard and Bomberman as Assist Trophies? Konami ain't doin shit with their IPs so other people might as well
---
Stalk progress doesn't reset so once you full stalk someone they cant be stalked anymore for the rest of the match.
---
I believe you can get 4 total EW3 procs in one match.
---
If killers without any real counterplay are scary (the glowing shard thing is confirmed to not work, btw) then I'm terrified of the spirit o/
---
Perks are 2k shards each on the Shrine, while chars are 9k. Survivors are really just skins of each other, so that's 3k extra to get them, plus you'll start getting rituals for them, so you'd have to REALLY like a Survivor to justify buying them.
---
Killers vary a bit. Some Killers may not suit your playstyle, or be licensed when you're unwilling to pay for them. I'm stingy, but even I bought BBQ off the Shrine. In general, though, I'd buy a Killer over their perks because I like being able to change up gameplay.
---
If it makes you feel better that's how I play her when I play survivor
---
Dude just spin in circles towards them. Works every time for me. And then meg and I have a little dance, maybe some chardonnay, it's a nice time.
---
I am seriously not memeing right now or exaggerating but i seriously don't understand people that are not finding matches. I find survivor and killer matches instantly, even late at night no matter what. How come i do but other people don't?
---
I wanna know the same thing
---
Hes not holding the game hostage. It's a shit move but the game was still progressing.
---
Thanks :D
---
I'd really like to have Sister Irene as a survivor from The Nun movie.  
---
In the film she &gt;!has the protection of the convent's dead nuns who warn her when the demon nun is nearby.!&lt; id like to see that translated into her perks. I think It'd be really cool to have a nun in a white habit running around the entity's realm. (I'd immediately prestige her.)  
---
Another survivor would have to be Herbert West from Re-Animator. He's green syringes would make perfect charms.
---
What? Complaining about bad game mechanics?
---
Ok thanks
---
I couldn't agree more, it's a shitty thing to do in all cases. I can't understand why there's a chunk of the playerbase who thinks it's an okay thing to do. Maybe I'm just scarred by wait times in between matches on the PS4, but it's such a bummer when it happens.
---
yes that's how we do custom perks in general it is necessary to superimpose an image on the usual Square
---
people don't complain about her strength people complain because instead of reacting you have to gamble in chases vs spirir
---
Could be a region thing, I'm from Australia so maybe aussies just dont fuck with this game idk man.
---
Unpopular opinion, rank doesn't matter till you get to red ranks, that is if match making does its job
---
So one EW3 for each survivor basically?
---
Also, happy cake day!
---
I never play with Ruin. It is far from a neccessity. You can apply pressure. Rarely are 4 survs good enough at looping to mean 3 gens will pop during one chase. You'll eventually get better and it won't be so bad, like every other game in the world.
---
Because originally the devs wanted KILLERS to be able to kill but couldn't figure out how to balance it, so they relegated it to an item and called it a day.
---
Why are keys in the game?
---
I hate going against spirit but i won't let my team down because we got to face her
---
I think the Slenderman would be a cool addition as a horror icon. That Slender game really reintroduced the helpless fear part of horror games alongside Amnesia and Five Nights, but I think Slenderman stands out among those two as the game that really took this aspect mainstream and brought it back into the spotlight. I think if it weren't for Slender bringing that back, games like  Outlast and DbD, where you can't do anything but run from the killers, just wouldn't have been possible.
---
That being said... he would be *so* difficult to make work I think. His model is absolutely massive so he probably wouldn't even fit inside places like Lery's, but also his mechanics would need to be heavily adjusted in order to work within DbD. I could see them basing a killer off of the Slenderman, but idk the original Slenderman wouldn't fit too well in DbD I don't think
---
Is spirit THAT cheesy though? I am a kinda new player and i main her because i really like her artstyle. Should i feel bad about that? xD
---
I guess that counts as 4 disconnects and id assume a killed dc counts as an escape
---
cornbreadfiend - PS4 
---
message me and lemme know you found me from here please!
---
Honestly outplayed.
---
You are aids
---
As an autistic person I have related to literally every piece of lore I've learned about her so I guess that tracks.
---
The face you make when there's one donut left in the pantry
---
I'm from sweden so i have some EU servers i guess? Always active and always able to find games instantly. Longest i have to wait for killer sometimes is like 30 seconds to a minute, never more really.
---
Speak for yourself
---
On PC it goes on sale for like $10 (without Hag and Doctor's DLCs) and you can aim certain Killer skills better.
---
Open hatch early at least they don’t have 90% chance of working every time if the killer has any actual skill
---
Man I'm uhh coming to Sweden lmao
---
Valak would be kinda dope if put into dbd, and have no clue who Herbert West is.
---
You can nerf spirit once you buff the other 15 killers 
---
(Maybe not all of them, some are fine)
---
To be honest sometimes survivors(I'm a survivor main who plays spirit when I rarely feel the urge to play a killer or for the mission) force themselves to get proximity camped. If I hook someone in the basement and I see two set of scratch marks around the shack you bet your ass I'm trying to find you and send you to basement, or fake leaving and catch you in the basement.
---
Yeah for sure, Dead Hard is clutch, I don’t use it but I know it’s powerful
---
Delicious
---
Finally, some good fucking shitpost
---
I don't do PC games and I'm okay using a controller like I said I'm pretty good on the PS4
---
? Release nobody knew what the fuck they were doing and still died even though there were infinites for days on the maps
---
Except as survivor you don't want to be doing gens together, it wastes time and is greatly inefficient. He also basically doesn't have a power of you don't heal everytime he stabs you, if you're in a strong position then don't bother healing and just do a gen. I see all the time in my games for legion to come over and stab a couple people and for them to heal only for him to come back and stab them again.
---
But he is because the progress of one or more survivors is being prevented with no way out.
---
Yeah sometimes they just walk up to me and dc, or let me hook them so they can commit suicide on it.
---
As long as you don't run clapper. BING BONG ME BABY.
---
The baddies who couldn't be bothered to find them/look at any forum?
---
Nah fam, give him a hoverboard
---
Seems like it. I just had two people DC as Huntress.
---
I had brown addons.
---
If his teleport was instantaneous it would be a problem, but as it stands it's fine.  It needs to recharge and you have plenty of warning when he begins to teleport. 
---
The snares are fine but I can agree that the pallets can be rather tedious, but even then I just remember what pallets I have and haven't thrown down and memorize the locations of broken pallets while I'm awake. If I see a pallet I know I've already used I just throw it down.
---
Freddy's rework was great and he's well balanced and fun to verse now imo (minus some op builds - *cough cough forever freddy* - and the undetectable status while asleep, like I said). Spirit's the only killer with a problem right now.
---
That’s a great idea! I’ll have to do that.
---
You say they turned they're brains off but we're they ever on? Holding M1 doesn't take that much brain power or skill, just pay attention for skill checks. If every survivor is on a gen at the beginning of the game there's no reason 2 gens at a minimum shouldn't get popped.
---
That .1% would cause me severe panic
---
I could do literally anything but i can't sell em sadly...
---
The killer said sorry bout the lag, so he definitely noticed it.
---

Not everyone plays online but everyone was bad? 🤔

She was time traveling like the terminator.

I just had the most surreal match against Legion today. Level 1 unbreakable Bill died 2-3 minutes into the match, Legion has Ruin. I got hooked once before Billy died. I proceed to seperate from survivors and do center gens while checking for ruin. Legion finds me, we get into a chase. I loop the legion for at least 5 minutes and only one gen got done during this time. I get bored and lead Legion into basement and get myself hooked. Blendette saves me surprisingly. I start doing the center gen again. Legion on me again. I decide to loop him and after 2 minutes I lose him, there has been no gens done after me getting unhooked, we got one done when bill was alive and one during my year long chase. I start doing a different gen and stealth his first gen check and get into a chase on the second one. Run him around for 2 more minutes, my team is obviously not touching gens and searching ruin for the last 10 minutes, I try my best and lose him a few times but he kills me in the end and blendettes are found sooner or later resulting in a 4k. Ruin is literally best killer in green ranks.
---
as far as I know
---
As far as I know
---
that's what i mean when i say he goes against the 'natural' way to play, doing the things that most players instinctively want to (especially lower ranked survivors) are what legion's designed for. otherwise they're just a plain, m1 killer
---
I’m on console here - I am lucky to hook 3 times as nurse, let alone kill. 
---
I’m a low green/high purple killer normally but nurse... I just can’t seem to learn her
---
Because 99.9% of players will never encounter that scenario, and yet 100% will be affected by any changes you make. Why would you cater to a very small minority of your players instead of the vast, vast majority? Not to mention that if you only cater to one very small player base, the game will never evolve because everyone will be using the same meta, forever.
---
This happened to me! luckily I had an RTB on before I got frozen so it killed me. Do you know if she was holding a key?
---
&gt;If it makes you feel any better, I don't play much anymore
---
It does actually, thanks.
---
No, she was empty-handed.
---
Yeah, it's like people have played the game so much that they don't have patience for anything mildly annoying so they just DC against whatever they don't have fun against.
---
Haha survivors complain about everything here have an upvote for your post about survivors so complaining
---
I do agree that there should be a sign that see is phasing but still leaves room for a mind game and prayer beads need to go but that’s about it, I think every killer is just terrified that they are going to completely gut her like they have done to killers in the past
---
Better Nerf s tier killers then
---
I play on pc with low settings and I don't stutter with status effects, or at least, I can't notice it.
---
Wack hooks and gens and spin, that usually gets my point across
---
The only way i could move was if I activated my key. I thought maybe the key was the source of the glitch, but it seems it's something else
---
And yet the majority of Smash Bros players will never make it to tournaments, yet that game is balanced around the highest ranking players. How is that game constantly evolving?
---
&gt;Survivor can perform a fast search through (200% of a slow search speed) a JigSaw Box, which would damage that survivor by 1 health state or he can perform a slow search that will allow survivor to safely search though the JigSaw box.
---
Better be like the trapper where you cant be put into dying or nobody would ever use fast search.
---
&gt;The Pig can see the remaining time of the Reverse Bear trap, while survivors have to rely on an glowing indicator. 
---
no
---
&gt;Active Reverse Bear Traps trigger automatically beyond the Exit Gates
---
After reading everything i notice that post  powered gates are effective again. No.
---
Sloppy butcher is a decent little slow down if you change targets and can keep it up
---
Does Amanda's Secret actually show the aura of the survivor while they are *searching* the box though? The last time I used that add-on it only showed the aura *after* they were done searching. Not sure if it was just bugged then or if was changed at some point, as I'm pretty sure I've just used it the once.
---
As Far As I Know
---
I dont see your contridiction there? Not everyone who plays a game will go to the respective online forum of said game.
---
Yo, what is that guy on top of the ring with a "D" hat?
---
That's a directly competitive game. DBD's gameplay model is completely different. It would be impossible to make it competitive because of how asymmetrical it is.
---
Same here, my theory is that they underestimate you when they see that the killer is Legion and subconscious get lazy. By the time they get back into gear then you've got enough momentum to kill them all.
---
I'm pointing out the hypocrisy of not wanting to generalize the community as capable of using the internet but ok with saying they were all bad
---
It's a way for a killer to stay sane after getting 10 rounds of teabagging flashlight clicking toxic swfs in a row 😂 if you're getting mori'd just know that killer is having a bad day
---
it's a perk that is not used by the game and it has no effect
---
He's not even bad, just unloved
---
No u
---
Looping itself is fairly simple unless you get greedy and try to save the pallet, what I notice most people(me included) is getting to a loop or getting from a dead loop(killer breaks pallet or unsafe pallet) to a new loop. And for that you just need to gain experience and try to remember pallet spawns.
---
read the title
---
So if a killer 3 gens the survivors and kills one, the others escaping through the hatch on the other side of the map means skill?
---
The problem is that once you get to rank 8 or above you face a toooon of spirits, not only gets boring, it is also a lot of guessing and pretty much almost automatic hits.
---
Yeah im from aus aswell(Brisbane to be precise)
---
And q times are usually long at night and okay during the day but for some reason as soon as i hit red ranks no matter what time i play either as survivor or killer i have to wait up to 10+ minutes just to get put into a lobbu
---
F13 had a lot of problems. Counselors were easily able to complete like most of the escape routes literally 2 minutes into the match. Keeping in mind Jason doesn't even unlock all his abilities until 2:15 minutes into the match.
---
If anything F13 had an even harder time finding balance, imagine if 7/7 counselors knew what to do, Jason literally can't do anything, even kill anyone semi decent since he doesn't have his abilities yet, meanwhile if people knew the spawning algorithm of parts always being in a 2x2 grid of where the main objective is, knowing how to easily repair with even 2 repair counselors, and learning all the tech for stunning and juking Jason, you could literally have the phone, both vehicles, and Jason demasked all done within ~5 minutes of the match starting and having all 4 victory conditions available, meanwhile Jason is struggling to run from the sweater girl or frantically kill her or Tommy, while everyone is just joyriding around until the cops come or until Jason finally dies or DCs.
---
Balance in F13 was a lot worse than DBD.
---
Is joke article
---
Im ok with saying almost every survivor that played the game on release got clapped by killers until the infinites were widespread. It is a factually correct comment, with the skills most survivors know now and how to play the maps if we were on 1.0 then we would destroy killers and it would be a 0k every game. Yet somehow on 1.0 killers got kills every game.
---
Just no with zero argumentation, wow, man you really convinced me my suggestions are not okau
---
I feel offended... why everyone hates legion today
---
Console players when they heard bill is coming to console:
---
22
---
My money would be on Ghostface next. There is something about his stealth that when used well... I can just see the whining coming.
---
As Near as I can figure.
---
The segway without a steering wheel kind
---
Dweet with new decisive strike
---
Same
---
It does seem that more often then not BHVR goes too far or not far enough and rarely lands in a good middle ground.
---
There'd be a trade off between the Ghost Face DLC and a what if SCREAM chapter.
---
Having and Original Ghost Face character with high customization with a combo of irl Fun World Masks combined with original outfits (including Fun World Classic Ghost Face by the end of this week!), or a killer with probably nothing to use for cosmetics at all with a survivor that would possibly get at least 2 extra cosmetics, and finally a map. I'd prefer the former imo
---
Chiming in with a late "assuming nobody has comms and the totem stays up." The problem imo is that 3rd Seal isn't strong enough to be hex.
---
&gt;  I’m not playing weaker killers like Pig. 
---
As a Pig main: ouch.
---
I switched from Legion to Pig because i thought she was much better. Now I'm reading she's weak. What does she lack exactly? Got great results with her but then again, I'm only killer rank 14.
---
Nothing has changed on my end. I just dropped a pallet in a killers face a few minutes ago
---
As a survivor i feel like my DS is useless 99% of the time since the killer never tunnels, but as a killer main i feel like they RUN at me begging me to eat the DS after they get unhooked just so they dont have a wasted perk slot and it just feels bad to not be able to punish it
---
Yeah but we also need counter play other than just getting hooked once or twice DS and BT help aginst tunnelers
---
I do actually.  It's very convenient
---
I believe that was the intention
---
There are SO many cosmetic things they have to add..  
---
- Choosing which survivors sit in the campfire.  
---
- Selecting which track plays in your lobby.  
---
- Ability to organize your character list.  
---
- Ability to change their portraits.  
---
- Masks for survivors.  
---
- Saving perk loadouts.  
---
- Emotes for killers and survivors.  
---
..and a bunch of other stuff.
---
I feel the same way
---
Just pretend your ruin blew up in the first 15 seconds of the match like it always does.
---
I've had this happen a lot lately.  There's been times where the killer is literally just standing in the pallet for a full second and I'm sitting there spamming space bar and nothing happens.
---
I never said it can't be balanced as an asymmetrical game, I'm saying that it's not a good comparison to Smash because in Smash both sides are meant to be equal and both sides have the same goal. Balancing the two games would look completely different; even in the case you mentioned, nerfing Spirit isn't a matter of balancing Killer vs. Survivor, it's a matter of balancing one killer vs. another killer. Balances are primarily done among each side. Balancing one side vs. the other is a lot harder, and even then they're not going to say "this one hyper-focused perk build can complete a match in 3 minutes, so let's buff all killers". They're going to look at the average match length (probably among different ranks) and then look deeper and see what trends come up.
---
my personal favourite it when they do it while i'm walking to the hook and then i get there all confused about what's going on
---
Addendum: If you'd like an example of a tweak, this is the easiest, simplest solution I can think of, in two parts:
---
1. Whenever a survivor cleanses a dull totem, it shows all other survivors a notification similar to the one when a hex totem is cleansed. Instead of a loud thunderclap, it creates a quieter, slightly echoing snap that you usually hear from a dull totem being cleansed. This way, astute players can keep track of how many dull totems have been cleansed, and even where they were.
---
2. Create at least one more hex perk that works similar to NOED, possibly triggering when there's one gen left. Since it feels kind of silly for so much of the game to revolve around one perk, which you don't even know if the killer is using.
---
I rarely farm outside of special occasions (entire team does everything they can to save someone and then that person D/Cs, I get 8 hooks before they even get a gen done, somehow they miraculously win my heart, etc.).   
---
When I do farm though, I have a simple rule: If the survivor is pointing at the hook, hook them. Especially if its their last hook. They want to leave and you get points. No reason to force them to make a choice between staying or d/cing. Only dicks force a farm. Offering is fine, forcing it is rude.
---
I DC agaisnt spirit, am not triggered, AMA
---
Very accurate
---
No matter how much Tru3talent or any biased killer main tries to push a certain narrative of her being completely fine, and the entire community including 4k hour survivor mains just need to L2P, the devs themselves have stated that on paper she is over-performing and will be receiving changes.
---
Down someone normally and then hit a gen while you let them wiggle off. Makes it clear what you want easily.
---
That does not work I believe
---
You could definitely play safe and wait if you want but there's always the chance that the killer might start camping the totem when he gets the 3rd stack, which might lead to a lot more insta downs. Haunted grounds isn't really that good, usually the killer will only get one kill against decent survivors if they're lucky enough for the totem to be destroyed mid chase, hg getting destroyed when the killer isn't in a chase happens extremely often for me and I'm rank 3
---
So yeah, I personally prefer to cleanse it and I get more success out of it but you could wait for it if you want
---
I agree. The guy you’re replying to sounds like a less than mediocre killer
---
Hmm. I dunno. I don’t really know the specs on my PS4. All I know is that it works and it’s smooth sooooo yeah.
---
Fun fact: two years in and Destiny 2 (A fucking loot based shooter) does not have loadouts. We can hope, but damn it ain’t looking too promising.
---
I only got 2 today which is pretty good. I black pipped agaisnt both so that's a bonus
---
The screen shots are to show my power recharge and how its well past the point where i should have recovered. (sorry for how bad it looks)
---
I have legitmately never d/c'd in DBD. I don't understand the benefit.
---
Because of the introduction of dedicated servers within Dead by Daylight, the killer's ping as well as survivor's are crucial to gameplay. Your problem sounds as if either you are constantly having horrendous ping, or the killers are. Most likely the problem resides with your own ping. And if you have a VPN active on your network, that might be the problem as DbD will be connecting you to the closest server to where that VPN is directed to.
---
That's actually the point, those add-ons are the main target of the change
---
NOED is just poorly designed like a lot of things in this game and it's annoying that we have to go out of our way to prevent a bad killer from getting free kills they don't /really/ deserve
---
It's shit like that they said would be fixed but it is not. The issue is obviously the large hit registration boxes killers have. Heard them explain before it is a cone and of a survivor is in that cone during the swing you are hit.
---
In a survivor game all 4 of us escaped and i felt bad because i know the struggles of playing leigion
---
Absolutely this, and it's hilarious. Had a really fun ghostface game because one Joe brought OOO and gave me a constant, game-long BBQ on him.... If he'd runanything else he'd have gotten the hatch, but i knew exactly where he was and when to stalk a corner
---
Oh jesus. I haven't seen that icon yet. Hmm but then again I am rank1 so maybe I need to wait a month or two for them to show up at the high ranks
---
Impressive! Good job!
---
Like the wraith *buff* lol
---
ird head huntress would like a word
---
Who complains about BBQ lmao what?
---
Wow this team lol
---
Congrats!
---
No lmao he broke a pallet and he picked up a survivor the damn flashlight was directly in his face and it didn’t do jack
---
Then play normally, just like in a normal game where you would get hooked and nobody came to save you
---
Did they send toxic messages after?
---
This is exactly what I like to see
---
No but got invited to the party after... Lmaoo
---
I hope to never run into you in a game. I'm not a toxic survivor but I just want to get points.
---
Doesn’t mean /r/nsfwdeadbydaylight isn’t a thing
---
What?
---
I'd rather DC than play normally.  Wastes less time DCing and getting onto the next match than it does to farm.
---
Or a black rapper who knows Kung Fu, though that's an older halloween
---
Haha I just heard loud Russian shouting from my headphones.
---
In its original form, it was broken. Old school DS was literally a get out of jail free card that rewarded being sloppy, and it drove anyone who had to put up with it up a wall.
---
What the fuck are you trying to communicate, you shaking spastic?
---
Probably the Mori..
---
I’d honestly love that but he’s a bit obscure and if they add another clown it’d probably be Pennywise. :/
---
I think the ones playing there are gamepass subscribers. I was in a match with rank 20 perkless Claudette.
---
You have to time it so you get the blind after the pick up animation/when the killer can move again
---
I salute you
---
They should make it so you could play a ranked and non ranked mode
---
It's pretty good. I'm at tier 15, but there's only 70 levels so I'll probably be done in 60 days
---
I'm nurse main so idk what's going on
---
I’m gonna be really sad if Legion doesn’t get an archive
---
Love when the last one dc's.
---
I hope the next dlc isn't licensed I've got 22k auric cells I'm sick of hearing pennywise, pinhead, Jason I'd rather there just be something original and unique to dead by daylight the more licensed characters the more of the games charm goes.
---
That's how I feel anyway.
---
Trust me i know how the game works I’m saying the flashlight doesn’t affect or blind it’s like he’s completely hallow in the dream and it goes right through him.
---
Yikes
---
Do these devs look like they're interested in free these days? Just curious.
---
Quick and Quiet is not underrated lmao a lot of people use it
---
No, that’s kind of why I made this post?
---
Its like people forget that there are daily quests that make you play characters that you aren't good at.
---
damn your user flair is spot on
---
Some clips of the cosplay in motion :)

Technically every original DLC is free so I don't know what you are on about. Is it that bad having people grind a little to unlock other characters? 46 levels and you get 9.000 Iridescent, it can't even be considered a grind since you level up just by playing the game.
---
I’ve seen people of this subreddit talk about how apparently BHVR has hinted towards the next killer being “The Alchemist” or “The Hunger” which I don’t think are licensed properties?
---
The way I see it, voice chat is game breaking and shouldn't be allowed by the devs to the point if they can prove you're using it, you get a ban. The game was intentionally made so there wouldn't be voice chat so the survivors couldn't talk to each other. So doing it is technically cheating because it goes against what the devs wanted.
---
You can't get banned unless you DC a lot. If it's once every 20 or 30 games that you DC, I'm pretty sure you can't get banned for that.
---
This is how I handle it when I'm in a farm situation I don't want to be in personally
---
I have been tempted to many times but have never intentionally DC’d
---
Saame
---
Lord, forgive me for what I'm 'bout to do
---
I can't get thru one game without both people dcing and I don't get how people are still in redranks
---
nah, depending on ur rank u can safety pep. gens + natural survival points + searching chests + totem + items (for example, a map gives u bp every once in a while) can result in a safety pep. probably not for red ranks tho. not sure above that
---
Dude, I love the demogorgon for this shit. Please go through a pallet, I’ll just use my innate always on ranges Spirit Fury and break it. Like 2 minutes in there’s no more pallets.
---
"Somehow"
---
Finally atleast I know I'm not the last legion main
---
Listen man, I honestly don't know why I do well as Legion. I don't main Legion. I main Huntress, why can't I 4k on Huntress that consistently?
---
True. I can't remember what the actual percentage but I think you should be fine in that case. I don't know the percentages so I try not to risk it at all personally. Then again I'm so cautious that I avoid using those perk packs that have been proven time and again to be safe lol
---
I main Huntress. 
---
I wish I was this good with Huntress.
---
Thanks homie
---
That's awesome!!
---
This right here is some good OC 😆❤️
---
It's fine we get good over time
---
Ya want the churro?
---
Aight, I’m aboutta head out
---
If ruin was a baked in mechanic then low tier players would learn the importance of looking for totems and get better at doing skillchecks quicker.
---
F
---
I am a Freddy main it does the same whether a survivor is asleep or not.
---
Ok, I see what you’re saying, I was the same way. But still, by working on getting more game sense, you can get a sense of where the killer is coming from without the perk. Knowledge of the killer’s rotations becomes natural the more you play and actually try to learn rather than relying on perks. Look at survivors like Ayrun, Ussylis, , Noob3, Fungoose. 
---
To answer your question, you can never go wrong with Borrowed Time (Bill), Adrenaline (Meg), Dead Hard (David) and Iron Will (Jake). Also keep in mind Decisive Strike (Laurie) and Balanced Landing (Nea).
---
But quite frankly, the perks you use really don’t matter. Survivors have a 4 man advantage to a killer, so they have more room for error and bullshitting. Good survivors like the ones listed above can literally use no perks and contribute more than the rest of their team. What matters is being able to loop the killer. If every 4 survivors on a team knew how to loop very well, the killer would be an absolute joke unless they have bullshit OP type addons. 
---
But in all honesty, most survivors are shit, simple as that. Any monkey can hold M1 to do gens but not everyone can loop efficiently. But a lot of killers simply can’t play well enough to beat those said shit survivors. It’s hard for sure but not as hard as these dudes say. If you tunnel the first guy you see when the game starts all game, of course you’re gonna lose. But if they learned how to use split pressure, rotations, when to break chase with a survivor then they’d do much better. Even though that’s not what you asked.
---
Legion is fun, they have good synergy with tons of mid to low tier perks that other killers wouldn't bother running, they completely break the ranking system so that even if you do poorly, you'll never get entity displeased. They are some of the best BP farmers in the game. The power is simple to utilize. Also Joey is best boy.
---
How can you not love them?
---
Well that’s a reasonable, if not slightly unpopular position to take let’s just take a peak at your other comments aaaaand it’s literally constant negativity and blatant antagonism. I award you a singular yike
---
To be fair, that's against a SWF group. If it's 3.or 4 blueberries against a semi-competent killer, the opposite is true and the survivors have no chance. Hence why I'm always saying that the game.is unbalanced, in BOTH directions.
---
Tunneling is great, its basically a free -25% efficiency for survivors overall actions while also tilting survivors. 2 birds one stone
---
All that I've heard Peanits say is that he doesn't personally use ruin and doesn't see it as a necessary perk. Not saying he hasn't said that, just that I haven't personally heard him make a statement other than referencing his personal play style
---
Similar thing happened while using Legions neon Joe skin. All the neon bits were lighting up while the rest was black
---
Wtf is this? I play this game but don’t understand 99% of the memes on this sub.
---
Yep pretty much
---
So I used Brutal Strength and it did work. Thank you!
---
Lost the mori and addons too :/
---
They said they wouldn't do any more free DLC since they will all be available with shards if they not licensed. I don't know why that's bad since DLCs used to be only purchasable with money.
---
Run what you like man, fuck all these people who act like there are only a few "best" perks. If it works and you have fun, fuck em
---
Only thing that bothers me are fast vault windows hits that should never exist, pallet hits after they fully hit the ground, survivors sandbagging each other, or survivors hesitating during altruism plays.
---
that’s crazy lol
---
Oof, also they dont want to be de-ranked
---
With my limited experience as trapper I usually have to spend extra time in an area to grab or reset traps... by the time I walk away some idiot has come up right behind me and uhooked the guy. I'm going for whoever is closest at that point.
---
I'm a rank one survivor and I don't think I've ever had an 80 second chase in my 1200 hours of the game.  Either I lose the killer or I'm downed - one of those will happen within 30 seconds.
---
Yet I get chased for two minutes straight and all my teammates do the dull totems and chest while urbaning around.
---
I mean Game devs do actually have to entice the players to continue playing their game, There are plenty of fish in the sea and so they must add new content, fix and balance often. I believe the only free stuff we will get would be via season pass, A free killer should be paired with a survivor but i'm fine with the same paid set up they have now. It keeps a source of income for them in addition to the killer being available to purchase for players that keep their game alive after a few months. At the moment it isn't a free game so i did actually expect some kind of content like the huntress but it's w/e
---
Uh, wiki says no
---
Yes por favor
---
They still are because it's so easy to injure people with the ability. After they've mended they're still injured. That way they either heal and waste a shit ton of time or get tracked down, or don't heal and get thanataphobiaed and stay one hit.
---
The people must see the truth, Uncle!
---
God, they even wasted their bps.
---
Use bug flair
---
I want an OC Killer with Old Freddy's kit + some mechanic buff. Ideally as another free char, at least to Freddy owners from before the rework, because it'd be kind of rude to the people who liked Old Freddy to go "buy him again."
---
Looks like we're getting Pennywise, though.
---
He looks like Freddy Krueger from Nightmare on elm street.
---
It also doesn't help that for low rank survivors, especially if you're solo,gens take FOREVER to do. It's so stressful and hard to escape in low ranks, but once you go higher up, the killers become the victims and survivors are the gods. When they finally nerf gen speeds to where it's balanced in high ranks, it'll be impossible to play in low ranks
---
Well, he forgot to add: "if all survivors are competent"
---
He's a great killer, but he's also kind of too powerful. Toss on the Tony mask and explode Survivors with one punch.
---
he resembles a short asian man
---
The annoying thing is getting DS'd after you've already chased and hooked somebody else.
---
Had a rank 7 twitch streamer in my game today who couldn’t seem to last in chases and kept blowing up gens. I called her boosted post game and she assured me she wasn’t. I watched her stream playback and all she did all game was blow up gens and then run away, get chainsawed instantly after running in a straight line, and use all of her engineers toolbox and miss the BnP skillchecks. 
---
No wonder queue times for survivors at rank 1 are 5 mins, it’s too easy to rank up for survivor.
---
Petition to make the lobby have an all chat and extended by 3 minutes so that everybody can clearly establish the boundaries before the game starts.
---
Moris aren’t fun gameplay. Point blank and period. Plus if one survivor quits its pretty much over for everyone else tbh
---
Uhhh...17? The ordering is weird, but I just got Nea's jacket. I only care up to Miss Pussins, anyway.
---
Which only happens when I’m killer hahah. But yea.
---
Makes fun of one side
---
"AKTSHUALLY ON THE FLIP SIDE"
---
Hells yeah
---
Thanks didn’t see it
---
As a Billy main (when I play killer) I think a movement nerf would encourage people to try to use his ability more in chase. There are a lot of millys out there but not a lot of top teir billies.
---
Just take out the ability to manually quit a game, tbh. Why is there a "Leave Game" button making it so convenient to do something you're not supposed to?
---
[This is me when I get the spirit in general](https://youtu.be/Ds0vpkvwxzg)
---
Same tbh
---
Honestly its great, I love playing low tier and people talk shit at me.
---
Then next round I play spirit and they DC =)
---
She could be autistic but with what little we know about her it'd be hard to say either way.
---
Every sec in this game is subjective. Rushing a gen hurt will most likely bite you in the ass. If it is safe to heal. Do it. If you need gens poped like right now then do it. I wish we had killers demanding 4k every game to STFU of people entitled to escape. OMG adrenaline. What noob.... That's what you sound like crying about NOED. How many downs did killers lose thanks to insta heals? They had to fix because at least 2 man ran it. Only 1 and 5 prob run NOED. I've played 11 SOLO games today. 2 NoEds and guess what. I escaped every time.
---
Same, these meme is funny as hell because it’s true lol. Even tho I don’t main Nea
---
I thought BHVR said they're never going to add a Killer who could be mistaken for a Survivor.
---
Not for any reason that I've heard; I guess it'd just be too fun.
---
Bullshit. Moris can be fun if you don't tunnel with them or even go as far as to only mori on death hook. 
---
Problem is often the killer will quickly return to the hook, tunnel off the hook, and then mori.
---
It’s always the dudes who don’t know shit defending Spirit
---
I’m definitely getting that from her story as well.
---
I wanted to love wraith, love the idea of cloaking... but I think its time we just hold a pillow over the poor boy until he finds peace...
---
They go down a pip for DCing lol. Had a better chance to not derank if they stayed.
---
A lot of smurfing

It's the punching down that gets me. I can't fathom having genitals so inadequate that I need to insult someone 5 ranks below me with no addons to enjoy a victory.
---
Although I also had a guy call me trash for winning a hatch standoff.
---
Twirling knives, sitting on a crate, leaning aginst a wall..  
---
Would really make it *feel* more like a gang.
---
I hope they never fix thix XD
---
Do red ranks even run NOED? Lol
---
Discordance should help you initiate chases and stop at least have the team from doing gens.
---
Sloppy is an excellent slow down skill
---
Killers like Legion, Dr, and Plauge are very good at slowing the game and Legion can cause some map wide mayhem.
---
Spirit, Billy, and Freddy have insane map mobility. The nurse does too but I don't know if the nerf completely ruined that.
---
Having a gen or 2 get done as the Trapper isn't the worst thing if you are trapping efficiently
---
This is basically all I got.
---
the issue is that a coordinated, consistent SWF or series of 4 really good randoms is just able to option select every killer except for nurse and spirit, because nurse and spirit ignore the game's fundamentally flawed mechanics
---
I've actually had a game where the Killer was AFK and I think my team was ecstatic. Nobody even bothered doing gens but me.
---
Jason will never happen until the rights who own the Friday the 13th series is settled
---
Maybe they should release an update buffing killers overall with the theme of the entity realizing the survivors have learned to deal with the killers and easily escape so the entity got mad and made it harder.
---
It means you hit them at some point.
---
/s
---
“YoU fArMeD rIgHt In FrOnT oF mE” just admit you’re waiting for the unhook dickhead lol legit watched you walk away out of view
---
Bond: *Oh no you don't*
---
It’s like face camping. There’s nothing the killer can do except lose all their Gen pressure by staring at the locker for 2 gems, or eat the DS and lose their map pressure anyway.
---
They also started putting bots into the game to pad player numbers/get faster queues.
---
I was the Nea
---
Kind of pointless if they don't. Or at least condescending.
---
So probably not.
---
This really makes me wish they had a mori that used all 4 members instead of one.
---
Maybe have a member slash  then have the survivor stumble into another that proceeds to kick them down, the third delivers a brutal kick while the last one moves in for the kill.
---
What do you mean by “fight back”
---
I think she’s fine, but unfun is definitely fair to say.
---
Yea, I dont DC when there is a mori in play. I just try and stay alive
---
I don't set out to farm, but end up doing it when there's a DC and I feel bad. So I guess just play Huntress and bring Iri head, then adopt anyone who doesn't ragequit.
---
It’s called “Decisive Strike”
---
Removed for highlighting multiple disconnect
---
So what's the symbol to request death? Point at a hook and teabag?
---
Ahaha, yeah. Most of the time its "No offense buddy but you're the only one around", after going on a trapping trip
---
Well, you can already fight back with Decisive Strike (stab the killer) and head on (slam the locker doors on him). Make a build around taking hits and "fighting back".
---
So 5 seconds before the clip starts both the david and feng are going for a body block on the hook. I smack the david and realize they are gonna commit to this and drop the kate. Clip starts immediately after.
---
I wish it were that simple. When I get a farming killer they're like "I'm not hooking until I get my daily done"
---
They were asking for it tbh
---
Cause it was funny lol I’m gonna memify it
---
SERIOUSLY THO. THIS JUST HAPPEND TODAY. I was playing ghostface and as soon as i saw that a player was using OoO i went into dark shroud. The dcd in less than 5 seconds
---
what a cunt
---
Spent all that time and bloodpoints to get 1 kill. Got that .0005 IQ gameplay right there.
---
Ight bro I'm bout to head out*
---
Open handed has it's uses.  
---
Up the Ante? You will never use it and will be pissed off everytime u see it in your bloodweb.

---
Now we can add an Arabian survivor
---
You a clown or a clown? No it's not lol.
---
So do you suggest getting not only OH but also UTA since the later will be annoying?
---
Or they just have decided instead of playing the game, they will let the game play itself.
---
Be honest you run into way more moris at high ranks then you do unkillable god swfs.
---
But what about Freddy's sunglasses?
---
I agree. Plague is also on that list. 
---
But the bottom 3: Pig, Legion and Doc need reworks for sure. Wraith should get his Soot addon as base kit. I think with Clown there’s little you can do to buff him without making him bullshit. He’s already annoying as is. He already excels in chase. Trapper should get some more traps off rip and be able to carry atleast 2 base kit
---
The problem is the rank differences, and it’s hard to balance the game the while keeping both in mind.
---
In low level play, killers dominate most of the time, and survivors can’t loop/escape chases.
---
In high level play, Ruin is mandatory to use, and almost all the survivors know how to run the killer, hit great skill checks, etc.
---
kill both of you instantly letting the survivors win accept the one who brought the grenade, they get whatever amount of blood points the killer had x2 because they sacrificed themselves for the team, but it would be a perk that’s almost impossible to get
---
Naw, shirtless Meyers before sunglasses Freddy 4 sure
---
Yeah your like "The fuck? It hasn't been a minute? That must of been last millisecond"
---
It happened again
---
It takes me 3-5 minutes to find a match and if you did this to me, you deserve to be camped by insidious basement bubba
---
Well I mean the first second you start to stalk you can see which person it is and that they are injured.
---
No, grab Open Handed.  
---
Skip Up the Ante.
---
Damn
---
The reason they don't do splinters for Legion, Spirit, Clown etc, is because you can buy them with shards
---
But we already have shirtless David we don't need two sexy motherfuckers in a game
---
I only dc when survivors are being extremely toxic. When I play survivor I never dc
---
Alright, thanks mate
---
Hawkins lab is a good billy map don't @ me
---
Yes we do
---
I do know, its just survivors think that the killer hitting the person who is injured on hook is tunneling. When it clearly isn’t, but y’know, everything that a killer does is against the rules isn’t it?
---
Wrong.
---
 How?
---
I'm okay with shirtless Myers as long as we get it after November because shirtless David almost made me lose

---
So delusional....says the one that commented calling me a spirit main but thab gets offended when I call you a survivor main. HAHAHA nice try. I'd bet you DC everytime you cant win. But dont worry. You'll find a game you understand someday kid.
---
They should have made what they did with the mobile — no SWF lobbies.
---
Edit: Now they implemented it. RIP fun games. 
---
On a side note, seriously, this game should BAN all possible communication devises in order for you to play it. It is just too much hassle, and is unfair to the killers.
---
Not at all. DS isn’t a crutch perk like NOED or Adrenaline. DS is a perk used to mold the molt. It bends the killer, making them completely unable to do anything productive against them. Obviously you’re too dumb to understand this and further debate will not change that, so I will not be replying to this thread anymore.
---
I seem to get some really randomly salty DCs when playing Doctor in particular.  
---
As a Survivor the disconnect button is pretty much the "fuck this I don't care anymore" button.  Usually only used when I've gone through several annoying games and then get the straw that breaks my camel's back.
---
Which is the most ridiculous explanation for a game mechanic, but ye.
---

---
I wouldn’t mind being stuck in an eternal trial with her uwu
---
You're a wholesome soul. That player doesn't deserve your kindness.
---
It's the lore though i didn't make it up
---
People threaten to report other players in this game constantly. Doesn't mean a ban will come of it. Especially not in this case. Just ignore the salt, it's not worth the aggravation.
---
No you’re obviously not getting he was in the middle of breaking a pallet and the  flashlight was directly in his face it didn’t blind him whatsoever
---
10 minutes later: still no gens are done. Lol
---
I use to always try to unhook myself, resulting in staging and then just not struggling and dying first hook lol
---
yes but struggle movement
---
I always see to use monitor and abuse on legion. Is this not required for a good build?
---
Lmao tbh
---
I don't tunnel and still get DSed now and then. 1 min after unhook is 10% of the average game. TEN percent per DS user. Goes like this. 1 hook survivor A. Then go find a survivor B. I hit survivor B. At that time Survivor A is clear of my TR. And unhooked. Survivor B runs me back towards you. On purpose or not  I Hit him again he goes down. Then Survivor A the DS user who I was not thinking about pops out by his own mistake. Or got  spotted by a fluke. I hit him . I pick Survivor A up.....Shit DS. That is not tunneling. I was chasing and guy lead me to you. Now. Derp derp derp. Go pick up the first guy you downed.  No. Not going back to him then back to you. Hooking you right there is the efficient play. I'm playing in a hurry to stop gen rush. I personally forget to see if Survivor A is the obsession.  Then go back and  hook Survivor B. Then patrol. .......See what I mean. So killers are slugging now because you might have DS. Then you call him a toxic player because he slugged you. I don't mind DS. It is fair. I'm just giving a a scenario to show you that 1 min is a long time in a game where it's played in seconds  for the killer. Btw. The term tunneling is way more subjective then it used to be. It was tunnel vision. I hook you. And chase only you after unhook. Now people  imply that they got a chance to use DS so he's a tunneler. No you were just spotted. Sorry about the rant. I think DS is fine. Not OP but I think certain players just gave reason after reason why they should not be hit or downed. Gens done. We win. A 4 man running BT and DS and Adrenaline is a hard 3 or 4k. It's confusing. They can dive bomb hooks and it's confusing. I'm not a this perk is OP guy. I'm a read and react kind of guy.
---
I have never had a game last hours before 🤔
---
What if we lower survivor movement speed. Let’s say by 10-15%. Then, Spirit/Nurse won’t be as dominant, as survivors fall down quickly regardless of which killer you play. 
---
But, give survivor more options to avoid the killer by sneaking around, reduce the noises in-game (especially while injured) and scratch-marks.
---
So, hunters would be determined by three factors instead of 2:
---
- Speed of chasing/downing
---
- Map pressure/presence
---
- Ability to find survivors
---
Hence, most of the killers will be designed with having two strengths: 
---
For example, Spirit is good at map pressure and chasing, but is Super terrible at finding survivors. 
---
Wraith has map pressure and tracking (make stridor and bloodhound a part of his cloak), but takes much more time than other killers to down somebody
---
Doctor — tracking/presence/chasing (however, nothing particularly great with presence and chasing (both below average), except superior tracking
---
Etc.
---
Ideas?
---
Ok, for those of you who are wondering why this is posted, it's the God damn ebony Mori. My first one
---
Thanks! I tried to tell them they should have just held on the hook because they would have been fine. But I think that made them more mad O.O I get that not everyone likes to play against killers who play like me but we’re a pretty rare breed.. just get through the game quickly and move on to the next 50 killers who are more than happy to annihilate you x)
---
What killer?
---
I think he's from a mobile horror game called Identity V.
---
Ruin is needed because of faulty game design since gens take 80 seconds alone, 4 survivors and 1 chased, and a chase can take 80 seconds so that would mean that 3 gens would pop in 80 seconds so in a single hook. Now DS is supposed to be an anti tunneling tool that is used as a second chance after running the killer around, downed, hooked, unhooked, downed again and picked up. This takes well over 80 seconds and after stunning him you run to the nearest pallet and run him around again. Now tell me how is this the same thing? NOED = Survivor's DS if anything...
---
Nice pun lol
---
Adding obsession stacks wouldn't be ideal since Obsession perks count on ignoring your obsession or keeping them alive until the end
---
Yes.
---
\*Luigi's mansion intensifies\*
---
Xbox my guy it's part of the system on there so it works as a function by default
---
Survivor main and it shows.
---
Ok will do
---
You’d be surprised
---
Completely wrong.
---
If anything, BBQ is the killers DS. Ruin is a survivors exhaustion perk slot. 
---
Second, unless your playing with complete retards, while chasing someone 3 people should be on gens, call it two just incase that chase started with 2 people on one gen and he fucked off to find a chest.
---
Thats 2 gens done by the time you get the down, if at all because of strong RNG tiles at the start of the game. Now, the next chase it wont be as many gens because they could be closer together and you as the killer wont be willing to chase to the dead part of the map with nothing to protect.
---
But this is still 3 gens minimum by the time you have hooked two people. The less gens, the more pressure a killer has if they 3gen themselves, or the pressure becomes nonexistant because they did the gens correctly or you didn't defend the correct gens.
---
All of my reasoning assumes no ruin and competent survivors that don't die in the first 10 seconds of a chase. You can probably add ruin back in at rank 1 searches because they tend to hit the greats alot more, but the RNG on skillchecks is too much. You could get 10 skillchecks in the first half or 3 overall. Or you could just really unlucky and get the hardest possible ruin checks 50 times at the last 10% constantly and you have to hit the great to finish the gen, or be stuck there for a minute just trying to do something that should of taken 10 second a minute ago.
---
Killer main lol.. so anyone who don't agree with you = killer main
---
Ok..
---
When I started getting back into killer my queues were less than a minute long ( I was back up to rank 20 because I haven't played for so long)
---

You know someones mad when they call you 'kid'. Making up more things i see by saying i DC. Never Dced from a game yet, but keep feeding your delusion if thats makes you feel better. Stay mad.
---
Still I want them!!! do you have Discord? If so send me a DM on Reddit!
---
&gt;Well according to the survivors rule book
---
zzzzzzzzzzz
---
16% of 80 (seconds) is 12.5 seconds not 3
---
still terrible of course. failing 2 ruin skill checks is 14 seconds, but I think the thought process is that thanat effects healing too?
---
According to the survivors rule book you can’t sleep when a survivor main is telling you how to play the game.... get with the program man
---
I’d rather play against any other killer. I don’t think she is fun to play against at all.
---
Glowing shard thing?
---
As expected.. I said that before. There's a pattern, first was Freddy on launch, then legion then nurse (but touch her softly or people would just destroy BHVR) now spirit and soon again Freddy, Ghostface and any viable killer or killers you can't use the same strategy you use on 90% of killer's cast
---
That's sad
---

I can understand that if the spirit killer uses prayer beads (i dont use them because those are op and ruin it) which in my experience most do.
---
Congrats, queue times now take an entire hour instead of 10 minutes because you killed off the main appeal of playing survivor.
---
Yea the game is broken right now but itll soon be fixed.
---
She's damn fun to play as but against not so much lol. Check out scott jund's video on why so many people hate her
---
I haven't seen any plauge hate to be honest. 
---
At most I get salty because my Steve build is We'll Make It, Iron Will, Second Wind, and man she just deletes three of my perks :(
---
but whatever
---
I am new on hunting side...
---
I can confrimed
---
Literal garbage noob rant that doesn't even know how to play killer. I imagine you could get away with no perks and still win even at high ranks if you play well. Corrupt Intervention or Pop goes the Weasel is just as good if not more meta than Ruin.
---
Killer mains can smell idiocy and ill the informed apparently.
---
Did you have a friend cut off your arms to make it authentic?
---
Sorry to say it but there will be a Billy nerf. I think the killer complaining is out of hand. I ask people how many times has NOED killed you in games Idk. Maybe 20 to 50 times out of 1000 games. Then ask. How many times has a Nurses Calling killed you. You know. You get unhooked. Go to heal and Bam. NC hooked again. I get people saying prob like 150 to 200 and some out of 1000 Games that you died.   So NOED is OP? You can literally watch them short circuit like a robot Sparks are flying. BuT NnnNOeD IZ OP???You get killed way more times by being tracked with fucking whispers prob then you do NOED. .... So anyway. Booo NOED iS OP. PLZ NeRf....
---
Mariah has done it again
---
Survivor mains can smell idiocy and ill the informed apparently.
---
Link?
---
Lmao I had the exact same videos recommend to me earlier
---
People kept saying that supposedly if you look at the shards on Spirit they glow when she starts phasing. I have no idea if it actually works or not.
---
Joking and not joking I want Chucky, won’t happen (at least anytime soon). I don’t know who that’s really left I can see them realistically doing soon. 
---
Pinhead is hardly a slasher as he doesn’t chase or use weapons, he basically just commands chains to do his bidding. Nor would I say he’s a heavy hitter popularity wise but I guess I can kind of see it happening. Jason is in copyright hell so that’s not happening anytime soon. From what I gather Pennywise also isn’t coming anytime soon according interviews with DBD devs but he seems like the one they’d want the most. Not sure who else would fit but I could possibly see Jack Torrance because of all the new Doctor Sleep movie hype.
---
P3 Level 50 Ace and sexy ass Myers
---
Aight I'll check it out thanks
---
You just pointed out a clear advantage then say it is not because people don't **want to** play just to escape and take the advantage. Which, can happen pretty often if you played killer more than once in red ranks
---
I think so but also no because newer killers tend to camp more because they think it's the best strategy and that obviously brings on a horde of hatemail. When I first started playing as killer I got so much hatemail I changed my settings so randoms couldn't message me. I did hook camp to be fair but as I said it's part of the new killer mentality ( I think ).
---
Now I always let them get the unhook and I run pop goes the weasel and bbq and chilli
---
Its because noobs swf and leave teammates to die so they can rank up so right before rank reset you got red ranks with people that have had the game for a month and killers intentionally tunnel or play camp the hook to get an advantage so exactly ranking up isn't fun which is why a lot of good players don't rank up. No matter what rank people get salty when they get caught firat and DC cuz they're only good at hiding til hatch. How many times ive seen people wait out deaths for hatch is crazy. Not to mention 100% of red rank killers use BBQ and half the idiot survivors  don't even realize because they crouch walk and the killers go straight to them, amazing
---
Yeah. Ok. Some people slam that same button because they got found first. Some slam it just because you have ruin. That's prob 50% games I get DCed on. My fav. The salty SWF who dive bomb hooks and get downed. I wish I could slam their head into said button. I only get to play maybe 1 or 2 hours a day. Then after waiting in lobbies I get maybe 6 to 8 games. Half or more will have a DC. Almost 1 will be. SWF DC train. My ping sits at 42 to 60. So not lag.  Human condition to take advantage of others but in a horror theme game it's sad.
---
I only d/c against spirits when I’m solo which is about never so yeah I d/c a decent amount rolling a dice at every pallet isn’t fun
---
**Frank cry in the corner with his harem**
---
I don't see why not
---
never happened to me lol
---
I don't think it's necessary, could run surge, ruin, corrupt intervention, surveillance or thrilling tremors instead but it is a very good perk!
---
I tend to use it on killers like wraith, spirit and hillbilly who I know have the speed to hook someone and then go to any gen that needs pop the most.
---
Poor kitty
---
I don't think is hard to understand, it's English. Especially when in the image of the thread there's a obvious mistake (then instead of *than*)
---
Survivors have a clear advantage, and in the pic is acknowledged, then come again to say it's not true due to stupid people. It still an advantage, just because survivors won't just take it and make every game last 3min, doesn't mean it's not a problem. Just means that those survivors should've been stuck in a lower rank than where they actually are
---
I still see red rank survivors just do fuck all the whole game, something that shouldn't happen. Only those who actually play efficiently should be up there, so isn't that survivors are not advantaged, they are. The problem is how easy and flawed the emblem system is, since if you do a bit of everything you pip anyway, but if you run the killer for very long or do a lot of gens without getting in a chase you depip.
---
We've seen many times how useless is the killer, even the old Omega blink nurse, against 4 survivors who just do gens. They depip and 4 survivors escape in few minutes.
---
What else are they supposed to do tho?
---
nah he said what he meant, he's clearly trying to give you brain cancer
---
Both are very good perks, but you know how some people have the deluded mentality of uNiVeRSal pErk bAD
---
I do the same too. I'm survivor main but when I play killer I do this for dailys and archive. And usually everyone ends with high BP so why complain
---
He speaks the language of the gods
---
In response to maths, here's an opinion!
---
Also DS can't be removed from the game by a 15 second action, let alone 4 of them, and players who try to use it offensively by running at you, bodyblocking, etc.
---
Ah when I was reading her lore I got that feeling but was never really sure because I'm not too educated on it
---
When is real punish mechanic come?
---
I say ignore em. They can report you but most of the time, it doesn’t do anything. Plus all they’re reporting you for is you being a friendly killer. They made the choice to die on the hook and not wait to be saved by another survivor, so that’s on them. Anyways, I wouldn’t worry about it. If you enjoy your playing style then keep at it!
---
Ok. Not anecdotal? Every red ranks don't use noed but every survivors, regardless of the rank, use adrenaline.
---
There you go
---
I see your points but man you didn’t need to attack my spelling and knowledge.
---
Nope. No DC. I might get tilted but no DC. In the games I played online in the past 20years punish you for hours if you did or show a DC percentage so the person can decline. In fighting games you are ridiculed for a high percentage. I seen people change accounts because they could not get people to play. So I'm not better then anyone. I'm just used devs punishing or banning. I know it's just people knowing their is no repercussion now.
---
Swiggity swoogity the entity is coming that booty
---
freddy, plague, pig, legion, clown
---
in that order
---
I thought franklins didn't work with feral frenzy.
---
Noted
---
My team always uses Self Care through Thana / Sloppy Legion so I’m pretty much the only one trying to do gens, but since everybody else is hiding and healing themselves I’m the only one Legion can ever find. I hate teammates in this game.
---
Tapping takes longer then just actually doing it
---
Peanits is a dumbfuck. He proved it several times. He's one of the mods who should get erased from this community as well as many others
---
Im pretty sure every killer tried this at least once lul
---
"Comedy"
---
True, technically it’s an opinion but that’s because there isn’t any data out there proving my point because no ones done the research. True on the second point but there are strategies to counter some of the things you said. I’m not claiming it’s perfectly balanced but from my experience killers get 2k games and up about 50% of the time
---
That's not really a choice.
---
Get one hit and go down if you fail to loop and mind game properly, implying NO ONE ELSE cleanses.
---
Or cleanse, get 2 hits, immediately get hit with red puke twice anyways with no real counterplay.
---
Her power depends on people NOT cleansing, which is antithetical to the rest of the game's design.
---
Legion first
---
Same thing for Noed free 1 hit down boo hoo am I right
---
......Why did you even apply when it explicitly said friday daytime?
---
Enitity did not virus! So vax is not needed.
---
Ingame ofc.
---
Sometimes life just gets in the way.
---
I sincerely doubt that denying Plague's main power is fun as you then just have to consistently loop and mindgame without fail which isn't fun either.
---
He was mad initially because he thought I was out to kill everyone except Feng. But he stayed mad even after I explained that I wasn’t trying to kill anyone so who knows.
---
Survivor mains usually never have anything concrete to say. Met some pretty nice ones though. Mystical folk.
---
Cause cleansing is a similar mechanic to just flat out healing, for healing to be punished feels antithetical to how you play survivor.  Moreover games moving slower due to perk combos can be annoying as well.
---
No cause then that'll be 6 6 6
---
I heard the Mummy is the next killer and last year they said they would be introducing the oldest killer in history and we were thinking Vampire or something weird like that. Im happy to see more OG killers
---
I like your sense of humor friend
---
These are super common bro.
---
People haven't seen the depip squad I guess.. it's not only theory but is also true in practice
---
Surprisingly, survivor times in mobile took only few min without SWF (or almost instantly). Killers Queues take up 10 min. 
---
Not sure about that...
---
Thana, Ruin, Dying Light x4 puked survivors is a lot slower of gen progress x5.  She doesn't need to kill you to get there either, just get you puked on and hope you don't cleanse, and if you do cleanse she cleans up everyone who didn't cleanse.
---
As someone else brought up, JUST Thana is an extra 12.5 seconds and it combos with the other two I mentioned.  Gens will BARELY move at a certain point.
---
Hide in the closet James! You still have time!
---
Up the Ante, Luck offering and Slippery meat with friends is hella fun but besides that luck is pretty rucking useless
---
Good thinking but saving shards for other things atm
---
It doesn't need to be long range to be effective.  Corrupt Purge is very fucking powerful especially since the windup time is nowhere close to a huntress and you don't have an effective ammo count just a time limit making it effectively more powerful.
---
It doesn't help that Corrupt Plague is effectively punishment for cleansing which people hate not being able to do.
---
It's pretty decent just don't expect much. The atmosphere is the best part about it.
---
In order of tier lol?
---
To be honest I just completely forgot it was today, by the time I realized I had even been accepted (they didn't send out an e-mail saying I was accepted until I was already out and about all day) I wouldn't have had enough time to finish a full 15 games by the time the experiment was over.  I would assume in tests like these they accept enough people just in case a few aren't able to participate, and I would have loved to if I could have.  
---
I have signed up in the past for a few tests and never got accepted and for some reason thought it was tomorrow (Why do it on a Friday instead of Saturday..?  I don't understand half of the decisions the developers make)
---
I'm sure they got the information they needed from the people who did the experiment though.
---
TLDR: I thought it was tomorrow, didn't have a chance to check my e-mail until not enough time left to complete 15 games in the allotted time period, and every time I've signed up to join these experiments they don't accept my application.  So a bunch of bad timing and bad circumstances can't change the past.
---
Overall it's just a video game though, not like I needed to be there for a job at ATC Traffic Control where lives could be lost.
---
Lol but it’s great when they don’t see you!
---
Got dc'd in rewards and then as soon as i hooked the meg in the next game dc'd :(
---
Yep. When you come into the app if you on are mobile there will be three dots to the top right. Hit that and it will say contact mods. If you are on PC it should be on the side bar.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Nerf SWF, Then Nerf spirit. 
---
Theres bullshit on both sides, Spirit is fine
---
Learn how to play against her
---
Only things that detect you are spine chill and premonition
---
Nah. I dig it.
---
Just run through it. Even if you dont hit greats.
---
Depends, if the survivor has a video of you just helping feng and bullying them it’s going to come off differently when they submit a report ticket.
---
I’ve ran AC and had video clips of survivors helping the killer find me and I’ve submitted support tickets.
---
The only response I got out of all my reports was just for this different feng min bodyblocking me until I got crows waiting for the killer to come over
---
That hook deserved it.  So how many "tunneler" "camper" "fuck you piece of shit" "gg ez baby" and or death threats did you receive afterwards?
---
To be fair, I was scared as hell when I started playing beacause it was my first horror game, but later played with a rank 5 team through discord and learned all of this stuff from them and got introduced IRL, so for my solo games this just became auto. I still suck at being chased so still go for sneaky sneaky hide if killer comes to my gen, else I always repair, heal or save
---
NOED and Ruin is the only semblance of balance for Killers. I just did a 0K game as Piggy because the Survivors were a party of gen-running, tea-bagging trolls.
---
There's nothing Psuedo about it. Amanda was a cultist.
---
Good to know if affects more than just me, I figured it was something to do with controller on PC connection. Yeah losing chases is beginning to be super frustrating, but I'm not a big fan of playing with mouse and keyboard, I'm sure it doesn't happen there or there'd be more complaining around here.
---
I also have the Switch version and I never experience it there either, this may be an oddly specific bug ugh
---
Thanks &lt;3 Im watching a lot of videos at least while I wait lol. I love monto? i think he is
---
Good luck.
---
I've noticed it on xbox. Thought it was just me going crazy or my controller being haywire.
---
Me too. ;)
---
Not bashing strong perks. Half the game's fun is screwing around with perks and playstyle. Not just flattening survivors as fast As possible.
---
As I said; I find killer boring otherwise.
---
I guess a lot of people disagree. 
---
Plus whenever strong perks get overused they usually end up getting nerfed sooner rather than later because someone got butthurt.
---
I'm mostly advocating playing the game to have fun, not just winning.
---
But it would seem there's a bunch of people who *can't* have fun unless they win.
---
That’s quite a difference here still.
---
Repentance is just a worse version of we re gonna live forever and Durability is just a worse version of hangman's trick
---
Actually, the aura is shown *after* the trap is removed. Aura is not shown when they start removing the trap, and same with the noise notification. Both happen when the survivor removes the trap, and does not show if the box didn't have the key.
---
Do you go to work and have your boss tell you that today is free because the last few times you should have made more than enough money?
---
I do the same thing for the sake of fun. They could try to report you for farming/grieving, but it's not going to do anything. You're fine. 
---
Keep doing fun games, especially since queue times are awful right now.
---
I wish to not run it. However I'm still un-experienced and I can't get better at chasing, petroling, setup with some killers when as soon I spend 10s into a chase, 3 gens get done.
---
None actually.
---
Following your own flawless logic, i can just tell you that SWF are fine, and you just need to learn to play against them.
---
But i'm not gonna, because unlike you, i actually take some time to think before typing something on the internet. SWF are indeed powerful, and something needs to be done, but if a killer as bullshit as the Spirit exists, which at high ranks can really only realistically be beaten by a 4-man SWF with SEAL team six coordination, then the problem is the fact that such a killer even exists.
---
No, Spirit is as far from fine as it gets when killers are concerned, and as a soloqueue survivor, she is downright disgusting to go against. The devs themselves have acknowledged that she is overperforming, but hey, i'm sure you know more about their game than them.
---
Also, if you somehow do know an actual way to properly counter her, go look up Scott Jund on Twitch or Youtube, he's openly invited anyone who can provide him with a concrete way to outplay a Spirit to show him. Go ahead and showcase how "easy" it is to play against her, and become internet famous. You obviously shouldn't have any problem to do so judging by your comments and attitude, right?
---
I only dc if I need to go somewhere
---
The pose looks like when the cool guy in the friend group walks in and everyone immediately stares at him and he does the hand thing and says "wazzup?" and everyone laughs and cheers for him and you do too because you want to be a part of the fun but all you can think is how he's so much cooler than you and you want everyone else to like you too and then he decides to sit by you and talk to you and you're really happy
---
Hi guys! Killer main here.... ill take this one.  
---
(Clears throat)..... nah
---
Tbh if this was real it would make me pick up the game again
---
You’re talking about tournaments like you know something. You know jack shit.
---
Oh thanks. I think.
---
In this moment gen also start move his pumps like he is 90% on few second, i saw it too
---
I stopped reading once you said "Swf are fine"
---
Get to red ranks on killer and try to say that with a straight face
---
Until you've had all 5 gens pop in 3 minutes you aren't ready for this conversation
---
Ok lol
---
The plot thickens..I have 20ish hours on the XB1 version and haven't experienced it. Must indeed be something super specific, meaning it'll probably never be fixed :-(
---
Any proof for that? You underestimate the complexity and difficulty of creating AI at least remotely playing like a human.
---
&gt;If you’re losing why don’t you just go win?
---
Nice idea, but if you think Konami will for one second license out Silent hill to a game they don't own you are dreaming...even if Konami only make Silent hill slot machines these days... #FuckKonami.
---
"Do I know you?"
---
I want them to add Candyman but I think they'll go with an original killer that goes with the lore they're trying expand
---
I guarantee you’re not good. My 4 stack would walk through you.
---
Yeah I run it I just suck at paying attention to it😅, so I just wait for the chase most of the time.
---
Monto is pretty good. I like watching Noob3 and Usslys cuz they are toxic survivors and it's funny 😂😂
---
Salty Dwight bring Haddonfield off and BL, get knocked down in first 30 seconds cos im not that stupid to just follow him on infinite, insta DC.
---
Red ranks BTW
---
It work, but its hard to see. Most good spots is her left leg and right shoulder, u can check it in KYF
---
I compared them because they are arguably the two best perks
---
Pretty good job so far perk:moderately/considerably/ tremendously increase the chance of getting a broken hitbox. Also every single time you get hit you will hear "pretty good job so far"
---
Dont be sorry. Let's face it, each DLC is required to have one very meh perk, one niche and one borderline OP set up. You did good mate
---
RERO RERO RERO RERO RERO
---
I personally only tunnel toxic players... And you have to have been a special kind of toxic for me to face camp you.
---
Dropping a pallet and blinding the killer may not be against the rules, neither is making sure you die on your first hook
---
Randomness is random, and sometimes produces random events that seem to not be random 
---
Each tile has a chance to have the hatch. Preschool takes over many tiles, but has only tgis one spot. If it landes as any of the preschool tiles, it spawns there
---
Thanks, and happy Cake Day!
---
Your build makes me feel bad
---
I love the head personally
---
This is the cutest thing ever. Lil Demo and Hag ;-;
---
Increase default number of chests spwaning in, make the special part found in a chest, can't be dropped but doesn't count as an item, instead appears as an icon on your screen. If you die it's dropped at your hook/death location and its aura is revealed to all survivors. After a short time it's returned to a random chest if not picked up again (killer can waste time guarding it but gives up chances to hunt). 
---
Just thought of this off the top of my head. Thoughts?
---
that is indeed what blood warden does
---
I’m broke so I can’t afford much
---
It lights up for them, so they know the direction, but not the distance.
---
It's fun mind gaming against a nurse, it's not fun guessing against a spirit. Nurse was at least harder than Spirit, anyone can get r1 with spirit in a day.
---
OoO’s icon also lights up
---
Can you please create renders of her in herTest Subject outfit?
---
I mean DS  is alright but I'd say BT is better maybe even dead hard
---
Wish I was this good with legion
---
Do you think its possibly some type of lag? Matches have been bad about that recently.
---
My life as a Myers was a living hell during the Winter Solstice with all those damn firecrackers. Hate those things with a passion.

As a console pleb; I'd rather have the option to get bodied by some dirty basement dwelling pc player playing blue hair Nea than sit in my room fingering my arsehole for hours waiting for these Japanese fuckers to stop godamn leaving the lobby after they get matched
---
Any survivor in coms or brains knows to just not chase into gens. I'm green ranks and only low levels do this.
---
you know what that last one would be neat
---
it would be like the old tinkerer but wouldn't need to be reconsidered cause they don't make survivor items at such a rate
---
The gift of the entity
---
This is genius
---
Rank 20 this guy.
---
It's always been like that. It is fairly annoying but I've gotten used to it. Adds a bit of an eerie effect and makes me more paranoid than I need to be.
---
Doge legion best doge
---
Gf? LOL nice one.
---
I really really really hope they don’t correct this
---
I would like a brown flashlight with 2 seconds of use.
---
Change Mori's to be after you've been hooked twice.
---
Make Sprint burst an active ability like dead hard.
---
Change ruin to be like corrupt intervention to avoid it being destroyed because someone just happened to spawn on it.
---
Unbreakable should just be built-in with increased time to get back up to injured state, and give the broken status effect for some time.
---
Whispers also feels like it should just be built-in, but I've seen arguments against it.
---
Built-in unbreakable is the one thing I would like to have happen if I could only choose one. I just feel it's very frustrating for new people to not be able to get up and play the game because of being slugged. And slugging is just fucking awful.   I know the positives to slugging for killer, but just get rid of it. 
---
 Just my two cents that nobody cares for.
---
There’s fast vaults medium vaults and slow vaults.
---
STEVE BEST BOI
---
Just run your typical m1 killer perks like enduring SF
---
Haha amazing.
---
Ahhh. Angle and speed. At about 45° to the vault point and you're good, anything more and it's slower. You also need to be at 100% speed or more ( hope, SB, adrenaline, ect..) To fast vault. That's why rank 12+ will pull away from a vault point before vaulting 80% of the time.
---
You know what’s toxic, the obsession unhooking in front of the killer. Also, tunneling is the state of chasing after one person until they’re dead. The OP clearly isn’t doing that.
---
&gt; I stopped reading once you said "Swf are fine"
---
Lmao well that's too bad because he was just making fun of your "just learn to play!" argument and actually agrees that they need to make some tweaks to SWF. Maybe you should bother reading out what you're replying to next time.
---
Ran around throwing down every pallet my first two or so games because I thought that would stall the killer during a chase. They’d *have* to break it while I ran off. Thankfully, my friend caught my dumbass tossing every pallet known to mankind and told me how dumb I was being.
---
You’ve watched tournaments. Which means you watched the randos with zero experience get 4k’d. Pay attention to the good teams. I’ve played in tons of tournaments and won thousands of dollars from this shit. Every finals match I’ve been in has been Nurse/Billy/Spirit and the deciding factor was a 2k, not a 1k. Good teams _are not_ losing to anyone by 3k.
---
Secondly these killers are still getting destroyed by pubs, even by solo queuers. The amount of 2nd chance perks and the obscene amount of pallets that can spawn on certain maps is hilariously skewed towards survivor, even against the best of killers. I have 11k kills and still lose to random rng and 2nd chance perks. Survivors are coddled by the devs.
---
Why not? If anything Spine Chill got buffed recently since it now detects T1 Myers.
---
That could be a cool way to balance
---
Yup! Love doing it too. Pretty nice when seeing the whole thing come together.
---
I've done it, but only by getting several games in a row that were not against top tier killers. Usually I play a fun build after rank reset and change to some more meta perks once I get to rank 4 or 5 because it stops getting fun from dying every time the killer is at all competent or able to take advantage of my team being too altruistic or assuming I have DS
---
Or alternatively: AHH, UUAA
---
my first match i ever played was as old freddy. i didn’t realize i had to pull people into the dream world to attack them. i got 0 hits. luckily one of the survivors was a freddy main and he added me on discord and we talked for quite a while about how to play freddy
---
I meant knowledge as in grammar
---
i went into a match earlier and didn't realise i still had the pink key i looted in the last one until i was brutally cut down by the huntress
---
i hope somebody found it and enjoyed their gift
---
Self care, DS, iron will, and whatever you want.
---
They could have Freddy’s original glove (original series and remake have a different design), the one pictured, the finger knives from Freddy’s Revenge or his finger knives from New Nightmare
---
I don't like survivor much tbh
---
Done
---
Ah yeah, that is useful to know
---
Poor Taryn
---
He’s the entire circus
---
I’m bouta head out
---
Is that the pallet stun whimper?
---
I play both sides, no matter what side I play, I hate survivors.
---
My first game with her was a 4k. I enjoy stealth sort of plays. Easy claps. I don't usually use her. I'm expanding my killer and survivor base. Gonna try and p1 more people by the end of the year
---
spirit is a pretty easy killer to learn
---
&gt; i shouldn't have to run meta perks just to survive in the game
---
laughs in killer
---
You laugh, but people have suggested perks to huck a toolbox at the killer and stun them.
---
Legion is the most fun to play out of those three in my opinion. Spirit can be super frustrating and Plaque just gets kinda boring. I also like how the Legions power works where you can "see" survivors nearby when you hit someone with the deep wound and the fact you can fast vault pallets and windows.
---
I was trying to do it mid-chase, There were no pallets around to use and hag is too fast for me to outrun, plus they were in an area where its hard to juke them. Just an unfun matchup all around that was.
---
Just adapt
---
Use iron will
---
4head
---
Thanks. :)
---
I'm the one person that won't dc your ass why you cryin
---
It’s hyperbole don’t be pedantic
---
everyone's first game with her was a 4k
---
Won't miss you
---
When you get to red ranks for the first time and you realize you cant have fun anymore
---
It's a fair point since i'm a baby killer. Thanks
---
"HA! You stopped vomiting for 15 minutes, you were FAKING IT!"
---
These are players with thousands of hours and years of experience some of which I consider to be among the best players in the world, on both sides. The Korean tournaments are unfortunately lost in twitch VOD nirvana, but there's a good log of Russian tournaments, such as the TTB series on this channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMnXKxQcvdi7QIrC2XdQJsw.
---
Here's one example game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T3tiydu-RA&amp;list=PLANRIcAwSIvqzg5rqqvjS6yEw8iguvQ_4&amp;index=10
---
Both Huntresses with 3ks, with Iridescent Head but no extra hatchets allowed. Doc with a 3k. Then obligatory 1ks. And to note, this tournament counts hooks rather than merely kills.
---
I mean, 2ks are really not that hard to get, even against tournament-grade survivors. Competent killers can tunnel 1 survivor dead in regular playtime relatively reliably, and then secure a kill on a second survivor in the end game by hardcamping, potentially with NOED.
---
With "performing well" I never meant to say all killers are actually competitively viable in a tournament setting, just that 2ks and more can and do happen with them on a regular-enough basis. The game is certainly survivor-favoured with 5 players of equal skill and experience on a server, and while it does depend on the killer, map, add-ons, offerings, items and perks used of course, a whole bunch of killers could definitely do with buffs.
---
I watch a lot of tournament killers on their personal streams as well, and watching them play public games is boring, because they are barely ever actually challenged. I won't say there aren't some things on the survivor side that should not exist in the form they do, but again, if you are a good killer and playing hard to win, you will only very rarely lose public games, even with low tier killers. I mean, I don't really have to link twitch streams of people that play hours on end, day after day, and only have a handful survivors total actually escape through exits, do I? You have been around, you should be aware of this.
---
Which tournaments are you participating in?
---
Plague just looking at this bitch stealing her meme like 'what?'
---
Because Nurse got fucked and requires fighter pilot precision now.
---
oh yea you won't get many blinds while using the flashlight on a killer who is running at you. It takes too long for the blind to go off and they can simply look down, up, or to the side a little. Generally you just want to use them while they're in an animation so they're unable to look away from the light.
---
I thought that you need to pick up herbs when using botany knowledge
---
wasn't meant for you so you can kindly take your ass somewhere else
---
Yeah i agree, looks really fun, is fast af i like that. Thanks
---
If you don't get it. You really never play killer..
---
You may say it *ruined* your game
---
Just suicide on hook and move on,
---
Your dead hard isn’t working either? Shit has been busted since the Withering update, super inconsistent....
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dtsxvz/looping_done_right/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
No-Ed and Chill
---
It sometimes works but it's not intended
---
playing solo requires you to run meta if you want to stand a chance. 
---
Sadly the only good solo perks are 75% of the meta perks.
---
i use ds alert balanced and adrenaline, you could  switch alert out for smth else and it would still b a decent build
---
I feel like I live life playing against spirit.  Whenever its anyone else I get so excited as survivor.  Even Nurse I'm like 'YES', and not because I hate Spirit but simply because its different.
---
Killers: just do bones
---
Survivors: **do bones**
---
Killers:
---
Im a red rank killer, I just don't play it as often as survivor. used to main killer
---
Make lobbies great again. Third party program which can get you banned
---
Suureeeeeeee blame it on this so called “entity”
---
Lol what?
---
ain't that the fucking truth.. it really shouldn't be that way though
---
 I haven't yet tried the other two but I can say that spirt is very fun to use. just try to be fair to avoid dc. I usually use an add on to reduce the cool down of her power and one to increase her speed. Her weapon is cool, her power is cool and tracking survivors based just on sound and scratchmarks is fun.
---
You posted publicly. So...
---
that is the most fucked up thing to do. I wouldn't dc or suicide even if they have a mori, don't abandon your teammates because something went wrong for you.
---
There are a lot of changes they need to do. I would love to see a simpler version of Overcharge to be added to killers base kit and Kindred to be added to survivors (maybe it shows auras of all survivors every 15 secs or so for around 3 secs)
---
I posted publicly for constructive criticism, not sarcastic murder.
---
that seems a bit op to just add them as base kits.
---
Hmm so u just can slug and hook them again?
---
What a fuckin gem of a bug, hope you had fun zooming around the map
---
Please don't nerf adiris she's my main and isn't even that top tier
---
Yeah and she got some tricks too, seems good
---
I was thinking of Steve’s perk babysitter would’ve been like that at first. 
---
My idea is it should be the baseball bat, and it’s an item only obtainable by using the perk, and live or die you cannot keep it. But you would get it by completing 2 gens, 2 safe unhooks and healing others for 2 health states (stacks with Second Wind).
---
You’ll get the bat next to you as an item, and get 1 swing. It can stun for 2/4/6 seconds
---
A weaker version of Overcharge in kindred are no where near OP. 
---
Kindred gives info that is required for survivors to play well in solo Q, it would give them a better chance AKA making more solo survivors and less constant SWF.
---
A weaker overcharge would help slow down gens after kicking them, it would make sure if you kick a gen, it will delete a decent amount of progress
---
That's why u wanjna unistall right?
---
You're a joke
---
Maybe the survivor queues are nice and short because you and the 4 other people playing on mobile keep finishing at the same time.
---
I suppose
---
what? idek what you're talking about, I uninstalled the game because shitty killers can use spirit and get to red ranks.
---
legion is meh, spirit &amp; plague are both a lot of fun though. spirit is also kinda overpowered if you care about that
---
legion is both fun and viable, it's just hard to play them, they don't forgive mistakes and you have to give it your 100% every game. they're only worth if you're dedicated to playing them, like i am. 
---
are they low tier though? yes, of course. but it doesn't make them unviable.
---
Take 1 bodyblock for a one time endurance? Or two per use? Are you high
---
Anybody is allowed to comment and post whatever they like as long they respect the rules
---
Are you implying I shouldn't?
---
Spirit is likely the one you'll have the most fun with. Plague doesn't get to use her power if the Survivors are smart, and Legion is really just Wraith with extra steps. Spirit is an entirely different Killer from the rest of the cast.
---
i love ur idea
---
Same reason I still put traps on people after all gens are done with Pig. More points
---
i don't get why people would be mad about this. if a match becomes farming for whatever reason, it's no longer the game people queued for. i get that it's sometimes seen as a nice/friendly gesture, or just an easy win, but you're no longer playing the game and nobody is owed points for that.
---
Gens would be dwight if you have more then 1 person on a gen
---
This game is really everyone for themselves
---
I’ve had the game since beta and haven’t, I don’t know why, sorry bud. I’ll probably just prestige 1 killer and 1 survivor all the way. Myers tier 3 looks pretty cool so I’m trying to do that
---
Yeah gotta find the chill swf buddies
---
Isn’t legion supposed to be a high schoolers.....
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Ok we need more answers, so the MVP sort by new people know what they gotta do!
---
According to the rules you can get banned if you "Target specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience"
---
By that I think they mean tunnelling one guy multiple games in a row. But what this clown did is definitely targeting someone just to ruin his game, should get punished imo
---
We weren't string enough....
---
Most of the time, it is just someone having a bad day and finally deciding to get off in my experience.
---
They all are over 18 dude
---
Yeah Freddy pretty much ignores Borrowed Time mechanics evwn if you can get the deep wound effect
---
Light born?
---
bc without right/meta perks or godtier killers it's impossible to win :(
---
action priority btw bhvr, perfect game
---
I main Legion for Susie uwu
---
Q&amp;Q, head in, spine chill and iron will
---
That's not how it works at all. I block people I don't want to play with again and still have to dodge the lobby myself. It once was so bad that we'd match against the same deranking killer over and over again who'd just DC after the game started that I messaged Microsoft support and asked why I'm still being matched against him if I have him blocked. They confirmed that blocking doesn't do anything ingame and that they can't do anything about it and that it's up to the dev to seal with that.
---
Myes, quite 🧐
---
Wow lol
---
hard to watch
---
Remember there can't be viable killers. Anyone who has an easier time dealing with swf is a "problem". So you have to sweat as hard as you can and use all the meta perks, and maybe in 1 out of 100 you may have fun.
---
Nurse all comes down to muscle memory. I can only give 1 tip. Play her, once you know how far she blinks and you can kinda predict survivors she will get easier.
---
First we need to know what your issues are. What do you feel is wrong? Can you not protect gens, chase, what is the issue? And what perks are you running?
---
I run noed also :D
---
I think the Legion is considered to be the best Killer to farm bloodpoints with followed by the doctor
---
I like to use him with 
---
BBQ and Chilli + Hex: Ruin + Whispers/Discordance + Save the best for last(Myers perk)
---
While he lacks getting sacrifice points he easily maxes out the other 3 categories devousisness, hunting and brutality.
---
When you use his power, Feral Frenzy, you get points in devousisness which you also use to find/hunt players (hunting) while you're fast af and you switch targets multiple times (survivor found) and each time you hit them during frenzy it also counts towards the brutality score
---
Place holder*  Thanks for the great looking icons!
---
1. Dbd isnt meant to be competitive
---
2. Crossplay wouldnt change much, except higher player numbers
---
Therein lies the problem. The game is balanced taking the occasional fuckwit into account. That’s why when you play a 4 man swf and all of them are playing to win and being relentless on the gens most killers can’t compete.
---
Likewise at low ranks, too many fuckwits not doing gens and the survivors get wiped out too.
---
Killer overall is strong versus uncoordinated teams. You can 4k with addonless/perkless wraith if you wanted.
---
Or maybe they should buff the other killers so she's not one of the only viable ones against red ranked SWF squads.
---
Ok so here is my mentality when playing nurse:
---
I start game, blink to gen nearest totem. Blink from gen to gen until I find a survivor. Blink and usually miss and then half the time I lose them during the stun and the rest of the time I will chase them and then try and blink and down them. 
---
I can usually get two survivors on the hook only once each per game. 
---
I guess my main problem is that chases take too long and even though I can blink from gen to gen, it takes ages because of the stun afterwards and the decreased range on the 2nd gen.

Again. You don’t need a meta build or even a semi meta build to rank/pip. Doing gens and running loops requires no perks. You’re able to run pretty much anything. An exhaustion perk is in no way a requirement, it’s only a luxury. That’s why every exhaustion perk barring Head On moves you at the same speed for the same amount of time.
---
what will it take for dbd to be competitive?
---
less gamebreaking bugs.
---
B I G B R A I N
---
Spirit bad. We got it..
---
Next? Probably Freddy or gf
---
That's the thing, I play casual but I also see the potential of further progression. With the idea of more modes I can finally play with other casual players while competitive players play with competetive players.
---
I hope they give a opt out ik I won’t want to play with pc players I’d be happy to play with Xbox players though
---
It actually is.. it's just very unbalanced tho
---
this but for Julie owo
---
Yup, that's the beauty of it. Look at Modern Warfare. It's based on controller input.
---
I think a spider like creature would be terrifying. Didn’t they mention something about The Nun recently?
---
Ree ranks, almost every game is a 4k with a fucking trapper. Only slow down perks I use are corrupt intervention and PGTW. Right now you look like rank20 killer who wants to always 4k without any effort....
---
BHVR’s gotta learn one way or the other that she’s broken.
---
Who was it meant for then? Only people who agree with you are allowed into your safespace?
---
Bye Snowflake. Won't miss you.
---
Who is spirit?
---
Also what’s with the hate for spirit? She got one update a year ago and all of a sudden playing her is the same as burning down an orphanage?
---
I hate when survivors bring OoO, im main trapper but if they have that perk im just an m1 killer because they know where are my traps
---
Survivor with controller isn’t that bad.  Killer with controller however is the worst.
---
Have a lot of of fun! ;)

---
People love legion now. There are still grumpy shits who can't handle mending
---
Glad they delayed it for switch tbh, all over the place on PC for me, my archive challenges were screwed first day, did one and completely bugged out and unable to do anymore lol, didn't even give me the goodies for completing the challenge either! Atleast it's just cosmetics/bloodpoints though which I'm not too fussed about anyway.
---
I dont enjoy playing even if im playing survivor, the map needs a rework
---
legion is an information killer. use your power mostly to chainstab and apply massive pressure on people, also getting the info on where they all are.
---
respect pallets when in power. the best tip i can give is to activate power in chase after the survivor drops a pallet to vault over it. also be extremely careful with stabs in power and don't be afraid to end frenzy earlier to recover it faster. 
---
small maps are your best friend. 
---
stall the game and eventually just kill everyone.
---
I try not to but I tend to want to leave if someone is camping. I know it's supposed to be a playstyle it's just rude tbh. I get tunneling isnt something that survivors need to be salty about but tunneling isnt camping.
---
They know everything. Voice comms+OoO is basically cheating.
---
That’s the ass eater 9,000
---
Welp nurse got nerfed so now the spirit is the new killer people wanna see nerfed. After her another one will take her place and so on
---
It's a pattern that never changed. Before was Freddy, then legion, nurse and now spirit. Soon people will cry about Freddy again and ghostface when spirit will be nerfed
---
Is something that will happen. Oh I almost forgot when people asked for Billy be a 110%ms because he was too op. There was also that trend
---
Resolution scale helps but that comes with a headache. I was in the same situation for a while, My graphics card was able to play it on low settings but after time began to not even produce 10 fps on the lowest possible settings, making me upgrade.
---
But I think the spirit hate began before the nurse was nerfed
---
Good thanks man.
---
I only despise camping when there are more than 2-3 gens left, come on You havent lost the game yet you dont need to camp :(
---
It's a small dash forward that gives you i-frames. You can use it to avoid hits from the killer by using it right before they swing. You can also use it to get a little extra distance to reach a pallet or window.
---
The entire game is balanced around ruin right now which is bullshit. 
---
So tired of that thing. 
---
&gt; Make a sliding scale gen repair time for different level of players. 
---
1 takes way longer than 18 - also make gen kicks worthwhile for killers.
---
Thanos: ............... naaAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
---
I've found it takes about 10 -12 games to "lvl up" in the archives bar, so in theory if you play atleast 10 - 12 games a day ,then you should hit lvl 70 with about a week left on the 'event' to spare (which is about 2m 2w). 
---
Hope this helps in not seeing it as so Grindy
---
The thing is I save people from campers all the time with borrowed time. I always have it yet no randoms ever bring it. Usually people wont do gens and they will just sit there and hope the killer leaves. I never dc before my time is up I just try to avoid the negative for dying when i never had a chance. I dont want to loose out on my items. Havent done it in a awhile but it used to let me keep my item which campers can smell purple items so it's just frustrating. I dont care as much as I used to though about losing out to a douche bag though so there's that.
---
You mean you gotta play the game to get the free stuff, and it's not just handed to you? Imagine that.
---
Outplayed ;^)
---
Cross-play between PC and PC
---
Has anyone ever started cleansing a dull totem and then it lights up with NOED?
---
Thanks to SpaceCoconut (YouTuber)
---
I'm just farming the rift as he suggested. Took my wraith, bring end game perks (I don't have blood warden sadly) and make the gen pop in 3min
---
Do some hook, some Mori with rancor and Lets go to the next game. I depip yes, but I'm farming the rift since you get 1xp per second plus some extra for other stuff
---
So just by doing that you farm exp, have fun creepily stalking survivor, and they have fun too, and get your points
---
Artful Dodger!
---
Good thing if I see a blendette on the lobby I bring a mori, tunnel her and kill her right away
---
Why would someone sit on rank 12 though if they play better than 1? I sit around those ranks and I'd say I know how to play yet I dont rank passed purple and others do. Rank isnt for matchmaking. It's the reason matchmaking problems exist. If we all qued up without rank the learning curve would be steeper but finding matches would be so fast. I dont think it can get much more competetive than it already is though so there is that.
---
I only DC when the server drops me, which ithas been a lot lately. Makes me feel like scum when it happens, especially when we were doing really good.
---
The oldest killer turned out to be Plague, she’s from Babylon, which is really fuckin old
---
Scott? U mean this guy who thinks Spirit has 0 mind games? Don't make me laugh xD
---
We have a buddy that was trying this out with on Windows Store with his Xbox Game Pass but could not get in a lobby with him.  So am I to understand it has crossplay but does not enable grouping?
---
Probably for the best with the current matchmaking garbage.  I'm sure his rank 20 ass would really enjoy getting cornholed by red rank killers.  Pretty typical that BHVR can only operate in extremes.  Either the killer is rank 20 because we have 1 new player how it was before, or the absolute opposite red killer because 1 red rank survivor is in the SWF like it is now.  I honestly feel dirty when I convince someone to start playing this game.
---
Because people get sick of red ranks, it’s not hard to play the game and not pip on purpose. Red ranks is where all the Billy’s and nurse and spirit come to play, would you want to play against those 3 all day everyday or would you want some variety? It’s not hard to pip up and is not hard to pip down, unless you’re really bad, but even then you can still pip pretty easily. And also, some people play immersed and end up in red ranks some how, but can’t last 15 seconds in a chase, yet I’ve seen streamers and friends get loops for 2-3 minutes by someone in purple ranks. Like I said, it’s about how you play the game, if you wanna pip, learn what it takes, it’s literally not hard at all
---
I have never heard of anyone making fun of someone for not having something. Only if you farm someone without bt or complain about gen rushing without using ruin.
---
You can get those Outfits for Putrid Serum until the Rift ends, so you easily have enough time (more than 2 months) to get the 2 free outfits.
---
Nothing a killer does justifies a DC. If you end up on a hook, and they camp you like a douche... Take one for the team and buy your teammates the time to work the gens. Stop being entitled and thinking you're the only one playing. Lol.
---
Oh fuck that bitch I hate the dude that turns invisible too
---
Stop its nnn
---
Lmao right. I never understood complaints like this. Oh my god. I have to play the game to get rewards? Who knew?
---
All ruin does is increase the length of the match. How does not running it improve your skills? If you wasted too much time on a chase just acknowledge it, you don’t need 3 gens popping to tell you your 80 second chase sucked
---
And huntress axes are basically undodgeable already. I'd play against red rank Spirits all day but Huntress is insta DC. Snipes harder than Bandit when he had his ACOG still
---
You wait it out. You waste the killer’s time so that the others have more time to do gens.  
---
There’s other people behind screens playing this game. Would you dc if you were playing with friends?
---
Interesting
---
Pop amazing for snowballing, but if your losing you get nothing
---
Opposite for me, the whole reason I bought this game in the first place was for Michael and Laurie. It’s amazing having so many iconic characters in one game and it actually making sense.
---
I actually love it as a perk but lmfaooo I was dumb but it was fun being immersive
---
Why though? Its an Oni head
---
I'm at the same boat as you. I'm around rank 10-14 as killer and pretty much never get paired around my rank. It's either survivors well above or below my rank. Getting loop for what seems like forever is no fun. Other times the survivors are just too inexperienced and the game is too easy. 
---
If you haven't already, I'd turn off the postgame chat, assuming you're in PC. I don't have to hear that I'm trash anymore form survivors well above my rank. There is a little icon (arrow? or a little text bubble?) next to the chat to turn it off. This has saved my sanity. Playing killer is much stressful than survivor for me. You always have to be moving. Don't need the extra stress from postgame chat.
---
That’s stupid and I guarantee you’re not as good as you claim
---
i dc against lag
---
Of all the paid DLC myers in my opionion is the most fun
---
They say they don’t want any children in the game, this usually is used as to why there aren’t children survivors but it probably works for killers to. I’m pretty sure the legions must be atleast 18 because of this.
---
The thing is that spirit is op, there are no counterplays, she can just stand there and trick you, it's not even about mind games with her
---
I don’t dc. Its bad for the team. I’ll be honest and own up to dc’ing once in the past few months though. I’m playing survivor with randoms. Three of us start off next to each other so we hit the closest gen. Dwight pops it and runs off. Killer of course sees me and not the other two, so we get a chase going. I’m downed, hooked. I’m rescued, wraith is camping so he immediately downs and hooks me again. Next person rescues me, wraith runs past two survivors to down me. He slugs me and runs off after rescuer. So I’ve been tunneled, camped, essentially farmed, and I’m on last hook anyway. I DC because killer doesn’t deserve perfect 4K. Not sorry. I pride myself on being a fair killer. Dogging one person until they die hurts everyone, even if the killer isn’t good enough at the game to realize it.
---
Devs say they will not put children in the game so they are atleast 18.
---
Sam
---
Good to know... I assume if I prestige, it would also disappear correct?
---
It's not a video.
---
DC against someone is against the EULA
---
Just read the post made by not_queen
---
I didn't know Captain Smartypants was on reddit.
---
I know it's bannable, I just haven't heard of anyone actually being punished for it
---
Sure.. did you ever watched truetalent? Just look it up, it will save me 30min to just explain how to counter her by writing
---
True, now it's rare. Still can't wait it will be very common a nice they mentioned it
---
Plunderer's Instinct highlights dropped items in white. 
---
In a recent game, someone died with a pink map. I grabbed it, and was able to use it during endgame sequence to find the hatch. The Ghostface was not amused...
---
Yeah, usually one dc even through half the game ruins it for all the people including the killer
---
I play on PS4 but I have my DMS set to friends only
---
I started the game a couple of days ago, and stealth killers are my biggest enemies, luckily I just got spine chill so I can at least know if they are coming my way
---
Which ones do you not have yet?
---
you'd be surprised
---
Myers or Freddy, if I'm honest. 
---
Myers can be really fun, especially when scaring the shit out of people.
---
Freddy is fun just game mechanics wise. Having a lot of fun with him at the moment.
---
I’m not saying they’re children I’m saying they’re teenagers
---
Btw you’re the only one in this thread right, unfortunately reddit attracts lots of delusional people.
---
&gt; The hallmark of imbalance in any game is when something is so imbalanced that players are practically forced to run certain things just to counter that one thing
---
then it's not imbalance if there is a counter to it. you made 0 point.
---
I heard that if someone dc’s or is mori’ed on top of  where it would spawn, it bugs and doesn’t show up, not sure how true. Did anyone dc?
---
Did you use it till you lost it that way? you need to hold it even when you die for whiteward to work
---
When you play Bubba and the survivors bumrush the hook for the save
---
*revving intensifies*
---
Lol you’re just mad cause you can’t win against a rank 20 killer unless you have decisive? Wow.
---
ok.
---
Waste the god pallet, jump in locker, DC, win.
---
My spirit was wearing the same until recently switched out the uniform for the red kimono. But I’ve been learning Huntress until everyone calms down about my Girl again.
---
How long ago was this video recorded? Whenever I'm on a hook (since the last patch or two) it automatically kills me no matter what stage I'm at.
---
the Game health state is way more important than you playing the game or not. And we don't need the swf population to keep the game running given that solo survivors are still the big part of the playerbase. Queue time would still be okay without you.
---
It's not mean to hurt you, i'm just explaining than we can't always satisfy everyone while keep a game balanced. And everyone with at least 2 neuros understand there is too much difference between a solo and a swf team to balance the game for both.
---
Pig is ridiculously overpowered, I’d get her
---
what
---
voice chat exist in F13. 2/3 of the solo player don't use it or don't speak English and ruin the game for the other since it's balanced around voice comm.
---
If you make voice comm a think in Dbd solo team would still be wrekt but people would just tell them to buy a mic.
---
So you have no desire to get better or learn, just nerf her? Lmao typical.
---
What'd she say
---
If the killer knows the unhook is about to happen they have no reason to leave, would be a misplay to.
---
They’ve definitely been working to improve QoL for console. And wait a sec...you were just complaining about dedicated servers, and now that you find out we don’t have it, “well how come I don’t get the good treatment?!” Chill man.
---
I think about a week ago, but I was actually hooked while someone else was currently on a hook, which for some reason doesn't kill you instantly like if everyone else is already dead and you're then hooked (if you look in the corner, you can see the other guy die a few seconds in)
---
Spirit is bullshit because there is no real counterplay to her. I honestly prefer hillbilly and old nurse over the current spirit. People started saying the glass shards on her glow when she phases, but I literally cant see it. Even harder when people use cosmetics that only has like 2 glass shards on her back.
---
Freddy is unquestionably the stronger of the two killers.
---
you can pip with only one kill dude. If you don't pip with 3 or 4k it means that you both didn't protect the generators at all during the first minutes of the game, and that you get all your kills by one or two hooking survivors.
---
So you complain about dedicated servers, and then you complain you don’t have them? Also, it’s not about pc being preferred over console. It’s just that they have to go through a different process to implement those changes. It’s easier to implement dedicated servers on pc than console.
---
Also dude, it’s just a game. Chill out. If you’re getting this pissed just uninstall.
---
I DC'ed once because of how pissed I was at my shitty ass teammate, whonof course, was a Claudette. She sat in a corner all game, no unhooks, left me to die on first hook, didnt do gens, and got hatch. Also she stole my Dull Key. :(
---
Ok but any reason why
---
I lile how you got 7 downvotes and no replies
---
Freddy always. From vaccum of no teachables to best possible build he always wins.
---
Argueable better teleport outside of endgame scenarios, and their secondary powers freddy ends loops faster then a demo can. 
---
Freddy can't "miss" like a demo can, doesn't require you to telegraph, you just drop and keep looping, and isn't predictable. You see freddy drop the trap and you are *forced* to leave the loop or be hit, you just know that if the demo times it correctly you have to run away and juke the lunge.
---
&gt;Take 1 bodyblock for a one time endurance? Or two per use? Are you high
---
Most people trying to bring Endurance MoM back to life usually are.
---
First off... "more stronger".... 2nd... freddy easily...
---
Yes demo has a slightly better raw chase and is indeed better on some maps... but freddy literally cant be looped, and he can teleport to gens passively... he also had sudo stealth with the lullaby mechanic.
---
ruin always get destroyed first from personal experience
---
r/redditsings
---
Freddy teleport imo is stronger than Demogorgon, he always can shutdown most loops with his dream snares.
---
Freddy also counters one of the strongest perks BT, bt is useless vs Freddy.
---
Yeah ever since the stranger things dlc, the game got vastly more popular and the roles reversed. Killer queue times are now nearly instant while survivor queues take ages. It's because people dont pkay both sides. People only play survivor so theres way more survivors playing than killers. It's funny too because the same newbie survivor only players are the same ones to bitch about balance lmao
---
MLGA doesnt work anymore with dedicated servers
---
Ghostface is a stronger pig tho
---
This is my hair.
---
I dont wear wigs.
---
wtf do you even mean?!? i complained about the dedicated servers cause they were supposed to be better and they weren’t but then i find out we don’t even get them.. that even more ridiculous
---
Yep, that's the one I meant, I keep mixing them up lol
---
Some skins avoid that, so its not a reliable counter.
---
Competitive play requires a functional balanced game to some degree...
---
We are going to get them. I believe they’re still in the testing and perfecting stages, and that’s why they haven’t been fully released.
---
Generally only in cases of hacking or where the team is very obviously not interested in playing the actual game.
---
Honestly i dont mind the endurance effect on paper, but i didnt play when MoM was a thing and can probably see how prenerf would be annoying to see on every survivor in the game where you cant play around it.
---
I like how my meme is causing more confessions than a Catholic church 
---
But your sin is forgiven my friend
---
The survivor half of me smiled, the killer half of me cried
---
Depends which one gets more DC. The winner will be nerfed for over performing
---
Exactly
---
The problem is not Spirit strenght, because if that was her problem then people would DC way more against old Nurse.. which didnt happen.
---
Its because how unfun is to play against her. Same as old legion, old legion wasnt even strong, he was just boring as hell to face.
---
Get it Girl!

True it takes forever I’m level like 37 trying to get to 40 before the 13th and it has taken a lot of playtime

sir,in 2 years i never dc'd
---
I don’t think that perk combination is good because as a legion you want to incentivize people to heal and if you run that build then people are just never going to heal, and that means they’re gonna just pump gens, and thanataphobia is just not as high of an impact game slowdown perk as pop. I feel like making legion more lethal when you’re injured is more important, incentivizing healing with perks like Save The Best For Last, along with perks to create map pressure around high priority generators like Discordance and Pop. So my ideal build would be something like Pop, Ruin, Discordance, and STBFL (replace ruin with chili personally because legion is a BP farming machine.) with addons like Cold Dirt or Joey’s mix tape to reduce the fatigue from you inevitably double stabbing someone with frenzy because STBFL.
---
Okay one thing. THERE. IS. NO. THING. AS. DISTANCE. CAMPING. YOU. TOXIC. MFS.
---
The most effective way to prevent a killer from tunneling is having the rescuer not immediately disappear after unhooking you. If the killer doesn't have the intent to tunnel you, he will immediately chase the rescuer instead of wasting time trying to find you. 
---
Now, if the rescuer unhooks and then hides in a locker or crouch walks, the killer will inevitably find you because of the grunts of pain followed by scratchmarks of panic running since you need to find a loop ASAP.
---
If the killer doesn't know how to play and actively ignores the rescuer despite seeing him in clear sight and starts looking for you, there is nothing any of you can do. Your only option is DS and unfortunately because it is still a skill check, you can miss it just as easy, leaving the killer unpunished (on top of the multiple counters).
---
Then be.
---
Both blood warden and remember me are strong in their own scenarios, but can equally not matter at all in games. Fire up is his weakest perk and isn't really worth running at all.
---
What game is this? Looks like a new age Oregon trail lol
---
The funny part is that, even if the chase lasts 30 seconds..that's already too long, because 2 survivors on a gen takes 44 seconds..the killer doesn't have the time to hook the survivor and get there to maybe Pop it.
---
I'm actually pretty sure on one of Peanits streams he said they have something in the works for legion but it's still in early development.
---
I mean.. she's not that fit at all. But she looks so good I can't say I don't appreciate it anyway
---
Great job man! If you can do a spirit/Feng you'll make me so happy haha
---
If you wanna get there easily, play Freddy
---
I was clenched the whole time watching this
---
She isn't a man.
---
This, my child, is pure art.   
---
Amazing man!   
---
May i ask where the stream link is?
---
I actually did paint a schoolgirl Spirit last week! (although not posted here) but it is on instagram @jubalina.illustrations :D
---
I know you get 1xp per second. But I get 400~ for a way shorter match and make people farm ( except megheads for some reason..)
---
I corrected my comment infact
---
It’s been weird, lately I’ve had a ton of killer diversity. Just hit red ranks again and I’m seeing some billies, some huntrsses, some Myers, some plague, some wraith, legion, hell ive seen more clowns than spirits lately. I
---
Will look it up! ( ╹▽╹ )
---
Found the spirit main
---
Why thank you. I’m gonna go ahead and post it even though it’s not allowed. Maybe in response to a request is different. Twitch.tv/YouHadMeAtGaming
---
There are viable killers, and i listed them in my comment above. Freddy, Huntress, Hag, Nurse, Demogorgon are all perfectly viable to stand against red rank SWFs. Hell, Fungoose has proved that even Leatherface can be viable in red ranks with the correct setup. Above all, these killers actually allow for some counterplay by a skilled survivor, and therefore aren't complete cancer to play against, unlike Spirit.
---
The main problem with Spirit is that she doesn't just have an easier time dealing with SWF, it's that only SWF stand a realistic chance of surviving against her, she just demolishes soloqueue players and non-coordinated teams with minimal effort. She can hear you, she can see your scratchmarks, she can see your blood if she brought that addon, and she can also bump into you. Meanwhile, you can't even be sure if she's phasing. How is this fair and balanced? 
---
She is broken from the start, and yet she also has some ridiculous addons. Add them on top of her base kit, then add an Ebony, and poof, free depip for everyone in the lobby. But hey, we are all just entitled survivors who can't adapt and counter her, which is supposedly very easy according to all these big brain killermains, and yet not one of them has provided us with a consistant method besides just dedicating 2 out of 4 slots for Spine Chill and Iron Will and just hoping for the best.
---
Found the survivor main
---
Wow, what’s amazing, and rip killer
---
Junji Ito Collection, have A mechanical shark as the new killer.
---
Yeah she's bullshit when for the better part of a year no one has said anything about her except for prayer beads. She's going to nerf hell just like the next powerful killer until survivers have an 80% win rate. 
---
But God forbid a survivor plays. unpredictably in order to counter a killer.
---
bigpussy is the killer?
---
Assuming you're not planning to pay for DLC, I would only spend shards on shrine perks if the perk belongs to a licensed character. Otherwise, I'd save them for characters. I don't think I've bought a single perk off the shrine since they changed the way shards were earned and jacked up the perk prices at the same time.
---
Bear in mind, though, that I am a collector and a completionist whose dream is to own every character in the game and have them all at P3 with all perks. So while I prioritise characters I actually like, I will at some point happily spend shards on characters I'll probably never play, just in case I change my mind at some point.
---
It really depends on what you value. Neither is a ripoff. If you'd like to be able to play different characters, save your shards for those. If the perks are the only thing you're interested in, you may as well just buy those, and if you happen to have 11k shards and no good perks on the shrine, then you might consider buying a character instead.
---
Somebody sounds entitled. Oh boo hoo, you actually have to work for something and it's not just handed to you. Must be rough.
---
Found you! You even did Morrigan!!  You're really good tbh
---
For some reason I'm playing a lot better. The nerf wasn't even that bad
---
hospital with billy
---
True, so Mabye 2.5/3
---
Which is why I said not everyone has to play like me. I’m rank 5 so I obviously try and get some BP each game but my point is letting that person at the end escape, giving them a 2nd chance when you down everyone too fast or letting everyone live when someone DCs helps make the community less toxic.
---
If you don’t care about this and just want 4ks every round that’s okay but at the end of the day it’s just a game. Getting messages from people thanking me is what makes it worth it.
---
You deal with it or you just play survivor until they fix something. Playing killer was not this bad, the previous years. It's just NOT fun at all and i say this as rank 1 killer. Doesn't matter how good you are at the game, it doesn't get more fun
---
Survivor side instead..it's a damn joke, you can fuck aroud, get hit, annoy the killer and you would still rank up lol
---
As long as they have it on them when they die the item goes with them as far as I know.
---
Its kind of like the phenomenon that dumb people thibk theyre smarter than they are. These casuals think theyre the shit when the ones who are truly good mostly just shut up and play.
---
Gross

People have been complaining about spirit since forever. Dont know what you mean by that. And there is no "playing unpredictably" against an experienced spirit. It completely depends on the killer if you get hit or not. You can choose to go a way you think she won't expect but then she'll just listen to your footsteps or collide in you. Whether you live or die against a spirit is just a fucking coinflip. Iron will works well against her but every spirit uses stridor so its useless.
---
I may be biased but I would say the Plaugue!
---
No
---
I had a very clicky Nancy in my game who kept going to blind me. She had already got a rescue blind, so the next time I downed someone, I obviously wasn't going to pick up them up with her around. Plus she had clearly been wanting me to chase her the ahole match. So I chased her and the second she was downed she disconnected. 
---
Like...why are you going to go out of your way to get the killer to chase you then DC when you inevitably get downed?
---
Argument has never been about whether she's strong or not, it's that she's boring as fuck to play against.
---
Clown and Trapper are significantly lower than Billy and Huntress in every tier list ever, but they're far more annoying to go against.
---
Buffing the other killers is the only good solution imo. If they nerf Spirit, you will face forever Freddy which is pretty much the same shit
---
Just go get a bite to eat and say fuck it
---
&gt; survivor plays. unpredictably in order to counter a killer.
---
this isn't a counter to spirit
---
Right? r/Marakath is very obviously projecting.
---
And then I‘m super happy when someone doesn‘t have ruin lol
---
Yeah incredibly satisfying
---
The only times I have dced are when the connection was so bad, I was teleporting back into buildings, the killer had injured me and I ‘magically’ teleported on a hook. I always gave the benefit of the doubt and tried to keep playing, because even people with bad internet deserve to have fun, but if it was impossible to play, I would leave and message them saying their internet may be acting up.
---
I love this. Good job mate!
---
If the game lags out to the point where I physically cannot play or if I know the killer is 100% hacking.
---
&gt; So is the overall problem to do with every other killer not being viable
---
Not really. If you're good enough you can make most killers work.
---
&gt;or the overall layout of the maps making the other killers not viable?
---
This is absolutely the case. If maps had any semblence of consistency or balance then my previous statement would be even more true. When everyone plays correctly it isn't killer vs 4 survivors, it's killer vs map. (Or in some cases like The Game, Lery's, or that new map, it's "survivors and killer vs map")
---
I didn't want to come out and say it like that, but yeah, you nailed it.
---
Freddy 100%, Demo i kinda meh
---
I'm a spirit main and I can tell you
---
Yeah. P much. The only people who stay are those with BP offerings or newbies.
---
... I mean it probably doesn't help that I usually bring Franklin's along too to get rid of pesky Flashlights
---
While that could be a big part of the problem, it's usually SWF groups that I run into that are like this-- not always, but most of the time. They're like this, and they have meta perks and really good items. Same could be said for killers with meta perks, and good addons. 
---
I feel like it's not always experience in these cases, but I'm sure that it is a fair amount of the time.
---
They need to change the rank system to what it was before. Nowadays, if you're a casual, you can't rank up, and you end up matched with newbies and rank 15/16 who fall like flies.
---
She hadn‘t enough time for the pick up animation
---
I'm new to this game and this is my first post here... just wanted to share this Michael Myers fanart I did. I hope you guys like it. You can get high-resolution image from my  [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/mrdiode/art/Michael-Myers-819691954).
---
&gt; The problem is communication counters them
---
Not really. Most events that happen in the game are picked up by solo survivors anyway. "Killer is coming towards you now" is only really handy to communicate if the killer is Ghostface- otherwise everything else is easy to pick up on and every counter to a killer interaction is running to a good tile and running strung together tiles well.
---
Yes because borrowed time helps you not get tunneled lmao
---
Lots of practice, try to avoid Add-ons as they mess with your muscle memory (plaid flannel is an exception) another small tip would be to use keyboard and mouse if you don't already, the extra turning speed with the mouse is a great help against a controller.
---
If i know im not gonna have fun in a game, im gonna leave. I paid for it, ill play how i want.
---
Im not one of those who think people shouldn't play certain killers, play whoever you want, play how you want. But if im getting irritated with a match why on earth would i stay?? To benefit other people who dont pay for my experience? Riiiiighht
---
You got hit with borrowed time. The trap doesn’t count as a “hit”, so after he M1’d you out of the trap, your protection activated.
---
I think with the testing they have been doing with vanilla servers and testing altruism that they might be changing the base game a bit. One can only hope
---
Aces perks aren't the best as they are rather situational, open handed requires you to run another aura reading perk, taking up 2 slots just to have a slightly longer range on bond/empathy/ etc. Up the ante is just garbage as it only slightly increases the odds of escaping bear traps and hooks. Ace in the hole does have some use with chest searches but requires finding chests and if someone has already sear he'd chests the perk becomes useless.
---
I tried to get to rank 1 with perkless, addonless hag a few times but I always start too late and end up in rank 2 at the time of rank reset
---
I think getting there perkless as anyone is impressive
---
For me (in Sweden) the Killer queue is 10-15 minutes between each game.
---
That too, but when I stepped in the trap my game had a mentdown that flickering shit wasn’t me it just happened
---
You wife now
---
Tbf in some modes MW forces you into crossplay.
---
My idea would be a change to dead hard when dashing directly into the killer stuns them but makes you exhausted for longer.
---
&gt;I’m rank 8 now at the time of posting this. Impressive, or no? Will it be impressive if I make it to rank 1 as perkless Legion?
---
Not really. Legion is fairly strong from ranks 20 to 4, where people barely know how to loop and waste time self-healing against you. Once you start facing people that just power through gens while injured, your kill ratio should decrease. 
---
That doesn't mean much tho, Legion is a fun and viable character to play as, specially since he removes stealth which makes games boring for killers.
---
What's so weird about it is that I've had better luck with builds that aren't optimal/meme builds at red ranks? Like, sure there's a ton of amazing players up there that will just stomp that, but it's so much more fun than dealing with the slog of toxicity in purple/green. Not disagreeing, just my personal experience with how things have worked for me.
---
As survivor, I'd rather get absolutely destroyed by a killer who's very skilled and just playing the game to have a good time, than a killer who's mad about the last match's group, just trying to be toxic (Because lord have I seen those sometimes) 
---
And as killer, I'd rather lose quickly to people playing optimally, rather than a full swf that's using any method they can to make the killer mad, and sometimes the odd solo survivor mad.(Spamming totems / flashlights / teabagging / D/Cing w/e)
---
The master from the strain and Nora as survivor
---
I guess you've never had an exit gate daily, cursed to always be chased or everyone else gets the gate before you until the game after you delete it c:
---
*laughs in P3 hillbilly with 34 ebony mories*
---
God, if you're there, forgive me for what I'm about to do...
---
The game starts at rank 3 so from there it's impressive.
---
No i think it was her dad, cause he doesn't like his moms medical bill
---
Alternatively, controller for survivor is better than keyboard for most as pulling off things such as 360s is much easier.
---
 In a survivor game all 4 of us escaped and i felt bad because i know the struggles of playing ~~leigion~~  Killer without Ruin
---
I agree in some cases, but I have met a few that were okay-- and my group tries to not be toxic, of course we all have bad days though. 
---
I kind of wish that this game was less encouraging for people to be this way-- but that is the problem with us vs them games.
---
I want a killer who can actually make the game scary and intense at all times, for example a psycho that could spread his insanity to the survivors in a remixed version of the docters power.
---
Balanced landing. It even works when you are not exhausted and if you really know how to use it you can loop the killer for very long
---
Buff the other killers to be as strong as spirit and nerf spirit add ons
---
Problem solved
---
People play spirit because she’s strong and not incredibly difficult to play
---
Nope, every wraith I play against stands next to the hook and tunnels people to death because they can’t get more than one kill.
---
It already is here
---
You husband now.
---
"Guessing game or git gud". Yeah. that's usually the way it goes lol.
---
To explain my comment, the way you said "She's either going to do this or that, so take a guess and hope you get lucky"... In other words, you aren't reacting or thinking yourself, you're doing something randomly, taking a guess, and hoping it works. It's a guessing game man.
---
Just unlucky.
---
:/
---
Well logical
---
The reason why lithe is the 2nd worst exhaustion perk for chases is because of one thing, there is no situation where your like "Damn if only i had lithe". This is because your other exhaustion perks would of been used at the same time to the same effect, if not better.
---
Dead hard can dodge the hit or make it to the next pallet just the same as the lithe speed boost would of, sprint burst would of gotton you this distance at the start of the chase rather then now, balanced is situational but gets you the BIG distance if you pathed correctly(or didnt get fucked by map rng).
---
When you don't have lithe, the window is still just the same loop you want to abuse in the chase, lithe just makes you leave it and run to another nearby loop.
---
If you don't have balanced, some loop areas are basically dead to you because of the stagger unless you have massive distance already, in that case you pathed incorrectly by coming here without balanced. 
---
tldr: You can always use a window loop to great effect without needed needing lithe, you can't use drops without going "If only i had balanced"
---
Who is wolfx
---
She hittin the meanest default dance.
---
Can u not make me want to do the huntress pls
---
Actually they will
---
You know why?
---
Whiny people.
---
Me get... More busty.... And hatchets.
---
Yeah well what can you do? Talk to the killer about it in post chat? In my 2k hours in this game I have never been able to stop a toxic player from ever changing. I also, never been able to have a civil conversation with them either since all they do is ignore what you have to say and just bad mouth you all the way.
---
Survivors that dc against spirit are just lame. They should go back to rank 20. I get that she's strong and all but it doesn't give you any right to destroy the game for everyone else.
---
Last time I disconnected was against a huntress, that was standing on a downed person while aiming her hatchet at my hooked friend . She waited like this until my friend was dead. No chance to save either one of them. Not playing against these kind of idiots.
---
There is no competitive play. There are ranks, but that doesnt mean it is competitive. They are to sort people into groups to match together
---
hello survivor main
---
Cutie
---
Speeaaaaaking of Legion, am I wrong or is this killer based off of dark web hackers? I just get that kind of vibe from them
---
I only disconnected once. I was playing against a hag, had a bad day at work, completely dead tired, and just wanted a fun game before bed. I can not stand the hag. She hooked me, put down eight hexes, and then camped me,and no one was daring to come to my rescue.  
---
I could have been a credit to my team. Let them do gens while she stares at me on hook, wasting all her hexes.  
---
But I was having a shit day and wanted to play a match before bed, not just stare at my screen until I die and just... yeah, I disconnected. I felt like shit but I was feeling like crud anyways so.
---
Unless your level 50 with no perks appearing at all in the bloodweb, just unlucky.
---
This is giving me 2005 YouTube PTSD
---
A guy I play in SWF with had a really fun idea that I think would work LEAGUES better. 
---
Eliminate hooks entirely. 
---
Make it so killers are an actual threat. Keep the 2 hit down system, and when someone is downed, Killer KILLS them. Basically like a mori every time you are downed. 
---
The catch? Every survivor has 2 respawns. So 3 lives, as it were, which is not all that different from what we have now. 
---
You respawn immediately, with the caveat that you are invisible to the Killer for 20 seconds. This completely eliminates camping, saving, slugging...however, gens would obviously have to take a bit longer to compensate for the fact the other survivors have next to no reason to leave gens now, as unhooks would no longer be a thing.  Sure, you could heal the other player, act as a decoy, but who is going to do that willingly unless someone is nearly dead?
---
Mori's functions could change to eliminate a life. 2 downs instead of 3 required, which really isn't that much different from how they are now, again. 
---
Keep everything else the same. Killers become more of an immediate and present threat, and would probably have a FUCK of a lot more fun. No having to haul anyone to hooks, no having to deal with flashlights outside of pallets or brave people doing it to you just out of nowhere. 
---
And most importantly, they have the time to do their own objectives. Survivors can still waste it by being competent loopers and what not, but not have it swing entirely to the Killer's advantage as gens would still be doable, obviously.
---
Yeah it's not really worth talking to some people
---
That's not what he said, I would link you what he said but just scroll up
---
He literally said "Swf are fine just git gud"
---
Like a toxic survivor main
---
Chapter name: Inner demons
---
New killer: The psycho
---
Short bio: Riley lived his life simple, he went to school and had friends like other people his age, that's when mental illness took over. He now calls himself "Kevlar" and is a feral version of the man he used to be. Riley and Kevlar constantly struggle against each other to take turns in controlling the shell that once belonged to Riley completely.
---
New survivor: Riley Swanson
---
Short bio: Riley always battled mental issues since he hit 13 years old. His most recent challenge is the existence of an alternate personality. "Kevlar" named himself and he has a burning passion of hate for anyone who isn't him. He hopes he can be trusted by the other survivors, Afterall Kevlar and himself are different people
---
That's why it's not a good idea to run devour with anything other than thrill of the hunt. Ruin tips them off that there's a totem around, so they go to find it, and a lot of times multiple survivors will find multiple totems. If you only use devour with thrill of the hunt, they don't have a reason to look for it until your one hitting them, so by then it's too late. Unless they stumble upon it by accident, but that's what thrill of the hunt is for.
---
Wish this would be a skin in game, it looks super good.
---
Nice fanart
---
Damn the stress at that moment
---
I mean healing at all is bad against legion for the main reason that, if your hit by his ability your always gonna take 1 damage unless your already injured, and being healthy puts you at risk of being 2 health stated incase of failure to mend.
---
&gt; we are all just entitled survivors who can't adapt and counter her
---
Agreed
---
I'm going to get some very confused people trying to unlock my phone now...
---
Hmmmm.... I'd go for some kind of cultist of the Entity. Fully robed, sacrificial blade carried by a blackened hand that resembles the vile appendages of the Entity.
---
We'll call them the "The Apostle" to use the naming conventions of the game.
---
For ability... How abbbboooout...
---
Dark stride: after x.xx seconds of transition, you are lifted from the ground on 4 legs that resemble the Entity's limbs.
---
During dark strike you can walk over intervening obsticles and vault points. As you are raised up, you can't M1 them with your knife. Instead a fifth appendage will strike out from under the robes, however you can only attack survivors directly beneath you, requiring pinpoint accuracy. The fifth appendage won't apply effects like sloppy, Franklin's etc. 
---
There would also be a transition time to return to the floor, during this time you can continue to move but at a reduced rate, similar to the wraith uncloaking. You automatically return to the floor to pick up survivors. 
---
If survivors light burns you, you fall to the floor and are stunned.
---
Perks would promote the zealous worship of the Entity.
---
Maybe one that massively increases basement hook bloodpoints but reduces the blood points of all over hooks. A monstrous shrine 2.0. How about basement hooks triggers an effect like cruel limits in an area around the basement and you have aura reading of anyone in that area for x seconds. I don't know, winging it here.
---
Mulling over ideas for the other perks. I want positives and negatives to each one. 
---
That's the first idea off the top off my head but I think this comment has gone on long enough lol.
---
Wrong meme format
---
I don’t DC against her and I dislike DC’ers but I honestly can’t blame people who DC against her. The counterplay is almost as bad as it is to old Legion/Nurse
---
I play survivor 80% of the time, at high ranks, and when me and my friends play, the only killers that give us any real challenge are nurse, spirit, and Billy.  Everyone else's most of my over 1000 hours has been a breeze, or annoying at most.  However when I am playing killer I always get swf that force me to use ruin and sweat my balls off.
---
Yep. I think we just need to accept that sometimes we are going to meet people online that just want to ruin other people's fun for their own pleasure. I mean it sounds bad, but what can you do about it? I have encountered many and I have reported them, but nothing happens because the devs refuse to take action against players who just target other players and they say nothing can be done because they are just playing the game. Hell, the devs can't even give you the decency to add a feature that allows you to block that player from ever matching with you in a public game.
---
Perhaps
---
I just think it's kind of dumb for being punished for cleansing a power that otherwise keeps you injured all game, not to mention is super easy to use on top of that.
---
Well I've got these same things, and I don't think I'm autistic. You might be reading too much into it my dude.
---
Why is this so satisfying?

Very well put, much appreciated
---
Every. Freaking. Ghost face. Except one. Bless you, that one Ghost Face that didn't make me want to just quit to actually play the game. Bless you.  
---
On the plus side, most Ghostfaces think you're going to disconnect cause they camp so they sit there and watch you forever while your crew do gens.  managed to get 3/4 of the survivors out because by the time the ghost face downed the survivor, got them on a hook, then waited for them to die, the rest of us had done all the gens gotten the door open, and ran out.  
---
Baby Dweet and Baby Ghostface.
---
What rank? What exhaustion perk are you using? What’s your play style like otherwise? 
---
Need some more info here.
---
Nah that's the mori, he just materializes a road roller out of nowhere and yeets it at the survivor
---
&gt; **I mean healing at all is bad** ~~against legion for the main reason that, if your hit by his ability your always gonna take 1 damage unless your already injured, and being healthy puts you at risk of being 2 health stated incase of failure to mend.~~ 
---
Fixed that for you
---
Just run adren and rush gens
---
Oh, thanks!
---
P3 Level 50 Nea and Pig, about to Prestige my Mikey, Kate and Kavid Ding.
---
And you said spirit is fine get good like a toxic killer main, seriously is this a troll? I find it hard to believe someone could be so far up their own ass without it being deliberate.
---
But what?
---
Who are you so cultured and bright in the ways of..... science
---
Camper /s
---
**Repeatedly** key word
---
What he did wasn't bannable
---
"Help help a viable killer please nerf!
---
 Dev help I can't win!" I have zero sympathy for survivors who say this crap. Prayer beads are unbalanced and remove counterplay. But the spirit on her own can be beaten, yes even by a solo queue for I have done it so quit your bullshit.
---
Oh, definitely Proud, I am
---
No she’s not she can be very easily countered just like every other killer in the game, the only thing about her that needs changing is beads, but even then, they still have counterplay *cough cough* SPINE CHILL *cough cough*
---
0:16 
---
Demo: Thank YoOOOooOooOuUuU
---
Red ranks btw. This clip should show why people need to stop instantly panicking and running away to the nearest loop. Many killers, even ones in red ranks are very reliant on seeing rapid motion and/or scratch marks to direct them to a survivor. Also, don't just sit behind an object, keep moving and stay out of line of sight.
---
This turned out great 😁
---
Counter-play should be something that comes about from plays involving skill and experience, definitely not from running certain perks. If you’re telling me you legitimately think slotting in a perk from a paid DLC is counter-play, not just in the case of Ruin and generators but other things as well, then we might as well hand over the entire gaming industry over to someone like EA and allow them to make every game pay to win.
---
It's incredibly sad how heavily Ruin is relied on in this game. I say this as someone who plays both sides equally; as Killer, I hardly ever use it because it gets in the way of me using perks that are actually fun.
---
For real his crap reads like whining. Her bumping could be removed I feel and prayer beads need work. But she gets a ton of hate from survivors like this who don't know how to counter her and throw up their hands and go "well I can't figure it out DEVS FIX THIS"
---
It's just sad.
---
Legit, one of the last survivor games I played yesterday, it was Macmillan estate, literally took 3 steps and there’s a totem right next to me. As advantageous as it is to get rid of a hex perk so early on its honestly unfair. Survivors should NOT be able to spawn right next to the totem. 
---
And they really need to have better totem placements to help killers. Too many times have I played killer and my totem is smack in the middle of the map for everyone and their mother to see.
---
Usually they have something arguably worse, like devour or noed up their sleeve
---
Ave Caesar!
---
Nah I play both sides, probably more survivor than killer but that's because my friends don't chill enough to let me play killer
---
I usually get rank 1 on both most seasons, but sometimes only time for red ranks and not grinding to rank one
---
As someone with 500+ hours on survivor and 500+ hours on killer
---
Spirit is fine, SWF is not
---
I once went against a doctor at rank 10 and everyone except for me DCed. Poor doc only has level 1 overcharge and monitor and abuse
---
He and you have almost the same Laurie build lol
---
Yeah, I def agree on that part. A lot of survivors don't remember that it's a team effort-- some people will die, and some will survive if you do what's needed. 
---
Getting a gen done for a sacrifice is always better if it's a three gen situation.
---
DAYUM
---
BPS, cakes and puddings didnt exist until the first dbd anniversary. They were so well loved the devs decided to let them stay, this is why the rarities are out of proportion
---
Yeah and I'm gonna use a perk slot on a stupid ass perk while I can bring something more useful, big brain moves
---
I mean, rank is generally just an indicator of time played per month. Unless you’re really, really bad (or new), you’ll reach it without much effort simply by playing a lot.
---
i know. my question is why they didn't change worse offerings
---
I wanna see Frank’s cute face on top that shirtless body
---
If my memory is correct... The main character isn't evil, he's just trying to get his girlfriend back or something
---
I don't DC kid, I'm rank 1 survivor tf you talking about, I survive games against her but Spirit is still op as hell
---
Anyone knows which comic thats from doe?
---
Your flair probably answers that
---
Superman/Batman #56
---
Which survivor is that? Cause that outfit is some Claire Redfield vibes and I want it!
---
Not necessarily. What they rely on is changing the relationship between a Killer and a Survivor. That's already handled by buffing the Obsession's altruism actions, making them immune to the debuff, and disabling the perk if the Obsession dies.
---
It's super tight, you should do the other killers too
---
FR.
---
To be fair, he said the words Reddit rodeo as if he wouldn’t get downvoted
---
I get your point but the less people like you I que with, the more fun I’ll have. Sucks when others hold at least some of the power in that scenario. You DC because your bitch ass doesn’t like tunneling - you’re a bigger dick than the killer in my eyes
---
The last 3 times I ran Devour Hope, Ruin, Haunted grounds and third seal all together, the survivors would break the 3 totems that weren't haunted grounds. What are the f*cking chances?
---
1/1000 that are the chances
---
Ima just past out
---
That happens often to me, but with about 10x speed lol
---
High rank solo survivor is an awful experience because it doesn’t actually require any skill to get to red ranks, only an investment of time
---
Every time I play, no one powers through ruin, half the team are running self care and everyone seems allergic to doing gens in general
---
Looking like that, she won't have any trouble hooking herself one.
---
r/dbdgonewild would like this
---
Very cool.
---
Why my flashlight hard
---
I need these rn
---
Take my upvote!
---
The problem is - if you look at the overall stats, this game actually favours killers, based on the data BHVR published. The kill rate is over 50%, even at high ranks
---
The problem is, as anyone who plays killer will know, sometimes you play a good group of survivors and get battered when there’s almost nothing you can do about it
---
Therein lies the problem with trying to balance this game - if survivors play everything correctly (I.e. can loop respectably and all commit to working gens when not being immediately chased), they have the advantage. But in the majority of matches, they don’t - there’s always at least one fuckwit on the team who ruins it for everyone
---
So we end up with some rounds where the killer gets completely owned, other rounds where the survivors have lost all hope within a minute, and a handful of close exciting rounds which are in the balance. This is the nature of asymmetric MP games
---
thank :)
---
I wish we could give other people our add ones because I have 12 of those glowing boxes I’m never going to use that I would gladly give you
---
I was trying to find something on this. Yeah when I uncap I get 120 fps only and it stutters.
---
facecamping?
---
I’d rather have this comic than people complaining about perks that you can literally deactivate by doing an objective.
---
Well see after the Halloween event you won’t be able to get them no more so keep them as a collection
---
No Mither/ Self-Care/ Object of Obsession
---
It seriously has very few professional artists, so this but unironically.
---
The mask is possessed and controls him
---
Self Care ?
---
Good no mither build:
---
Dont run no mither 
---
Use literally any perk instead
---
This made me chuckle
---
But why ?
---
Hag is the scariest killer
---
Those jump scares are so much in the spirit of the game! Love it.
---
But i am gay
---
I’ve been getting mostly ghost face and spirit recently.
---
Bc it's a beckon saying "I'll just pick myself up" and you are always 1 hit away from death it's a terrible perk
---
Those perks rarely activate in my experience
---
Yeah, because winning and having fun are mutually exclusive. Miss me with this bullshit. Some people don't think its fun to get shit on in every match.
---
I really don't know. The nurse blinked like 10 times the whole game
---
Her power doesn't depend on people not cleansing - just for some silly reason the community has decided it's more "efficient" not to.
---
If only "just viable" killers like the plague didn't get called OP by the community
---
spirit
---
Not anymore.
---
Mori me pls
---
But i --
---
"No real counterplay"
---
"Unfun"
---
I see these two things copy/pasted against nearly every fucking killer in the game besides the goddamn Trapper. I'm legit sick of it.
---
Weird for you to asume that such a Round is longer then 3 minutes. Like I even legit had a Round that was 2 minutes at most till we all died
---
There’s much more to balancing the game than just removing SWF, which would hurt the game more than help at this point. Game health wouldn’t matter if people stopped playing with its removal.
---
I've heard that "Eli5" several times already.
---
Who or what is that actually supposed to be? oO
---
Claudette is the OG mascot of toxic survivors. P3 Claudette SWF teams used to be literal nightmare fuel.
---
Yes, as long as you don't get prostate cancer from being too backed up
---
wait isnt she like 7 wtf?
---
This is how you tell this person doesn't know the first fucking thing about survivors and really has no valid point and doesn't appreciate offerings.
---
34? Rookie numbers
---
They got to make away for that not to happen
---
The developers say its a 'strategy' are you FUCKING kidding me
---
And here I never thought I’d find myself saying “Wow I wish I were that table right now.”
---
Frank is 19, which at that age would put you at senior year of high school if you got held back a year, which with his past, isn't to far a stretch to assume so.
---
The only one who is possibly younger than 18 would be Susie, but even then I wouldn't be surprised if all members range from 18-19
---
I only play legion because my girls and don't care much about male cosmetics. Don't matter how edgy the are.
---
It angers me

Yeah, praise all the people that worship Spirit and her absolutely fair amount of reactive counterplay /s.
---
Honestly guys, if you wanna be clutchy, just play Nurse. Atleast the Survivors feel like you deserved the kills instead of "Oh cool, another coin toss".
---
Jason voorhees...nuff said
---
Why are people annoyed with Plague ??? For me playing against her is the same way I would against a huntress.  If anything you have to be on the same page with your other teammates whether y’all are going to cleanse or not.
---
Up
---
Me too
---
Hook me, mommy
---
Nah, man. They are babyraging about spirit. Every second post is about spirit its ridiculous. Guess survivors want to feel safe while playing the game lol
---
Konami definitely does not need the money. Pachinko machines make more than their games ever did. By a large margin.
---
Yea, like he brushed it off so he could then say he acknowledged it while going on a massive bitchfit about spirit
---
Oh my god I can not agree more with this!!! &gt;_&lt;
---
I am genuinely blown away by the sheer amount of people trying to defend Spirit lmao. Fuck other people’s fun I guess? Survs are merely bots after all. 
---
Don’t forget, Dead By Daylight is an eSport. MUST sweat! /s
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday
---
If she looked like that, I wouldn't be running
---
* Screenshots highlighting common UI bugs and/or glitches, e.g. bugged Devotion EXP gain, massive amount of negative bloodpoints, not being able to escape, ... .
---
100% agreed. Let us pray it gets added  despite Konami being equivalent to EA in their blatant scumbaggery.
---
I wish you were that table, so i could love her silly on top of you.
---

This system would be okay if this was a free to play game, but its not, we all paid for this game and shouldn't be forced to either buy or endless grind for the content (even if they're just cosmetics)
---
It would be a nice combo, but you're spending 2 perk slots to see people for a few seconds after hooking. It can even be countered by hiding in a locker. I really dont think the combo is worth it
---
Hey man i think he might be flirting with you?
---
Why? I'm a Nancy main. Got her to P3 got bother her outfits.
---
She's cool!!!
---
I literally have a shit ton of pink/purple items and adodns but I never use them. I just like to see them in my inevntory being useless and covered in dust
---
Ay i know it's rough and the temptation is always there, but you won't improve if you disconnect against toxic survivors. Endure, learn their behaviour so next time you are more resistant to their behaviour, every defeat and victory gives you experience.
---
Explain Like I'm 5
---
/r/explainlikeimfive
---
No nurses now, well except the terrifiyng ones.
---
Same I use my other items. But I never use the last one until I get more in the web. 
---
But for the event stuff I always keep them and never use them. Maybe it's the collector mentality. But I want to see it grow.
---
Dedotated sewvers.

You take that back. Hmm, need more hatchets, be right back
---
She's 6
---
Skullkid killer confirmed
---
Same goes for idiots that do pointlessly risky unhooks. I was in a game earlier, hooked someone, another survivor runs up and unhooks in my face before I can even leave. Your a minute into a game and I've already mori'd a survivor because you just couldn't help yourself.
---
You're right, good to know, thanks
---
That's just strawmaning at this point.
---
I’m like that too, still haven’t used the discontinued offerings like the slight chance to go to Macmillan.
---
They already announced a rework for him
---
These days anything is holding the game hostage for survivors..
---
He's not.. please learn what hold the game hostage means before posting cringe
---
Yeah, you're right. He's a total dick for not wasting his time sitting on a hook purely for your enjoyment. He should just take a big fat L and sit there watching his screen for 10 minutes while spamming space, and then do it again next game if he's unlucky. Just so you can have more fun. 
---
Yeah, no. There's a reason devs try to discourage camping, and that's because no one wants to be camped. DCing is annoying, but I don't blame them if the killer is being an asshole.
---
Really? They have really fucked up wording
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; 
---
Thank you
---
They won't. Otherwise who will buy the tiers?
---
I hoarded BNPs until devs announced their nerf. Then suddenly I felt the urge to waste all of them. 
---
I hoarded Syringes until devs announced their nerf. Just like BNPs, I started using them nonstop.
---
Now I decided to change this mindset and have been using all my hoarded Ebony Moris (150 just on Nurse, Billy and Huntress). Same thing for 100+ Iridescent Heads. 
---
There is little to no point in hoarding items, before you notice, you stop playing DBD and it all goes to waste.
---
Real A+ material you are bringing to the conversation. 
---
Me - this game has problems that lead to people DCing on mass
---
You - Y u PlAy n E pVp hUh?!?
---
I'm the type of blendette who does the gens,im not like the others who hide and do nothing
---
You husband now
---
i wish you were that hatchet ;)
---
Entity "I don't know what is going on but that random box is going to get it."
---
my build for Plague is Thanatophobia, Moniter and Abuse, Ruin, and BBQ xP
---
liked for dabi
---
Try corrupt intervention. Imo that's a more reliable ruin, and less boring.
---
tbh if you got one of those mag lights that you load like 4 d cells into it wouldnt be too hard to beat someone to death with it
---
To be honest I wouldn't even mind DbD going into a competetive direction. Having several queue's (un/ranked), maybe sort of a draft pick at which Killers and Survivors can ban perks and maps etc. Sounds actually fun, so I wouldn't be against it, as someone with 2k hours this'd make this game so damn refreshing actually.
---
But at that point, DbD is the very opposite. Ranks don't matter as everyone with 100 hours of gameplay can reach R1, while R1 and proximity doesn't make any fun to play at to begin with, since everyone's playing the very same shit 24/7. Sure, when I want to improve and become "the very best like none ever was" , I'm literally forced to face meta, but just because I'm a good player, I don't want to be forced to int / dc just so I can have some fun in my games again simply because there ain't a fucking casual queue.
---
They should give Spirit some fucking indicators so facing her isn't casino royale while also make reaching the Ranks muuuuuch more harder. In addition to a casual queue this might help a lot with dc's. Simply because most of the dc's that ain't accidents, are people that are like "meh...Still too high".
---
When you set down your pink key to let the Kate know you have it and to stick close when the hatch is available but she picks it up and runs away only to escape via the hatch leaving you to die
---
Too bad your problems is a lack of adaptability. I won't argue with someone who never played any PVP game before and can't adapt or see counterplay just because is lazy
---
Much obliged, actually makes sense when it comes up to making Spirit popular...Lol.
---
They have the advantage in the chase unless the killer you are playing has something that helps you. They control whether they play it safe and drop the pallet almost instantly, or play it risky and be much more efficient. E.g if a gen is just about to get done, they can play it super safe to ensure that it gets done and you cant intercept it. You can mindgame them, but you can still drop the pallet early gaining a lot of safe distance with literally no skill involved. 
---
Also i play both sides, and i main Legion. If i had a good SWF and not a bunch of baby randoms at rank 1, yes i would easily win most games as long as our squad doesn't mess up or we come up against a god nurse or god spirit. 
---
You need to address the real issue and that 3 gens get done in the first chase and theres jack all a killer can do about it besides running ruin which gets cleansed almost instantly.
---
Worse when you get a map like Hawkins or Swamp where totems can spawn in the exact corner of the map.... right where survivors also spawn.
---
We've tried having more objectives last halloween and it was a shitshow.
---
99% of the proposals for new objectives boils down to "more gens but they look different". Nobody really wants that, gens are super boring to do as they are.
---
In every hatchet swinging maniac is a cupcake loving childe!
---
Never up more than a minute when I play killer anyway. -.
---
When I play survivor however, it's up all game and my teammates all die before finding it and its usually in an obvious spot.
---
What about third seal
---
Beautiful!
---
You are a fantastic artist OP please keep this up! Wether it be DBD or whatever interests you.
---
You do realize what month it is, right?
---
*Are you trying to sabotage me?*
---
The fact that ppl didn't DC as much against old nurse should tip you off that something is wrong with spirit. 
---
There is next to no counterplay against her save for luck. Escaping her is literally, in my experience, completely up to chance, you're just as likely to lose if you vault over an obstacle or try to walk away or literally any juke. Don't say iron will because stridor counters that. Even worse if you get injured in a chase, now you'll never be able to lose her. Maybe in red ranks they can juke her better than I can, but I doubt it due to how many people complain about her, but for me personally and the majority of players (who are not red rank), she is way too OP.
---
Did they buff Spirit or something? Or is it just people hating on the next most viable killer?
---
It would be quite more impressive if you reach rank 1. I don’t think rank 20-5 really has any challenge and rank 1 is just inconsistent power level at best.
---
Uh-oh. No ruin means noed
---
I too love to give the killers my box at the exit gate.
---
Why would you care about pipping? You don't get any benefits from it.
---
I do but im not into lore and stuff likr that
---
don't downvote him, he's right. The AI basically roams around, gathers loot, pickaxes through walls that are between it and the loot and generally just wanders towards the circle placing single walls every so often for no apparently reason.
---
If you see the killer bringing a secret offering, crash the game with Task Manager
---
It’s a rank 1, prayer beads spirit with an ebony Mori.
---
If you wanna "cite," you know you can just crosspost right?
---
“Fuck you” -Feng Min
---
Where can i enter this heaven of yours? I'm asking cause 90% of my games are Hillbillies and Leatherfaces : ^) and the ocasional Ghostface with NOED : ^)
---
Well I dont. Every single killer has plenty counterplay except for Spirit. Doesn't really help that it takes no skill but rather headphones to be good at her.
---
I have a stockpile of items and use them every now and then, I also quit burning good offerings like BPS, because anytime one is burned either I get the worst sweaty try hard killer who has the match over in 60 seconds, or a team of potatoes who say they are rank 6’s but play like rank 20’s. 
---
My Nea, Strode and Tap will never be prestiged...
---
It wouldn’t make sense from their perspective. They added a battle pass to make money. If they give it away for free there’s no incentive to buy it. Scummy move, but it’s whatever
---
I already lost to Monto’s stream of panthers Myers bruh. Embrace mommy huntress
---
Sir, I ask you to delete this them delete my life
---
Haha good one
---
I actually use the other Julie skin, I like it more honestly.
---
"Get down....oh yeah BT, you good to go fam"
---
I think a lot of the time, you'd wanna just leave. Take the sprint burst from getting hit and head to another loop. This way the killer would need to run after you, wasting and buying more time. If you just stayed in the same loop, then you're just making it easier for them when they eventually down you.
---
The devs said they won't put survivors in the game who are underage so that you know, killers aren't actively killing children in the game. They never once said that about killers. Lore wise, julie and susie ARE in fact under the age of 18. Frank is the only one who is over the age of 18. But hey, whatever you have to tell yourself so that you're not at freddy status and get burned at the stake.
---
No you're right
---
&gt; which would hurt the game more than help at this point
---
that's where your brain stopped working. Try again
---
she's not.
---
Legion really needs a new power. I expect edgy teens to start showing up all over the place, not Usain Bolt with a blunt knife.
---
Report that shit! If your on PS4 or Xbox those idiots are banned! Not sure about steam
---
Amazing!!
---
Nah, many people just don't do dailies at all cause they suck balls in terms of value.
---
Like, as if I'm going to play a almost no-perk Survivor and attempt to open a exit gate for 30k. If you ain't lucky enough to get this done within the first match, it's wasted. Especially if you consider WGLF being a thing aswell.
---
Dailies ain't worth shit when it comes up to BP. And buying tier's is astonishingly overpriced, when I'd want to buy the pass AND the tier's, i'd end up with paying 90€.
---
I personally think it's a very good idea that would make dailies atleast somewhat worthy doing again. Either this, or give us controll about which character we receive the daily with.
---
Except that you're right and they're under 18.
---
I remember toying with the files, but I'm sure I set it on read-only afterwards

#WHOA MAMA
---
I will be keeping this for later reference
---
my problem with nurse is the same problem with legion, she takes away the few securities survivors inherently have, and while (like in legion's case), that doesn't necessarily mean an overpowered killer, it does mean its an unfun killer to have to try to counter  
---
(clarification, i mean that legion isnt op, but hes unfun to play against. Not that hes op, as we all know he never was)
---
You - i WoNt ArGuE w U!
---
Also you - *continues arguing*
---
I can only assume you are a spirit main that somehow is still in green ranks.
---
&gt; Counter-play should be something that comes about from plays involving skill and experience, definitely not from running certain perks
---
you want to be able to counter play a build without perks or addon ? And you are okay with this ?
---
If you are able to beat a survivor team with meta perks and items without perks or addons then survivor would never win if you actually equip 4 perks and strong addons.
---
For fuck sake, start to use your fucking brain in this subreddit guys ! it's crazy how lazy you are when giving your opinion !!
---
I mean, as killer you want the survivors to pile on 1 gen instead of spreading around on multiple ones.
---
What's better, one gen popping in 48 seconds or 2 popping in 80? If the killer comes only one of the two gets disrupted, etc.
---
Okay, I disabled read-only and I will see how it goes. I watched a video where a guy said that you have to put it on read-only. Thanks!
---
Huntress confirmed for Hazbin Hotel?
---
Love a T H I C C woman.
---
The head looks like she weighed 300lbs at one point but lost the weight so she now has that extra skin, or maybe she still weighs that much, and that skin is being held together by a bunch of wrapped wire. It just reminds me of a bunch of fat trying to escape but is barely being contained by thin strand wrapped around.
---
The rest of the cosmetic gives this, "wow that looks wicked and evil". The head cosmetic changes that to,  "that's disgusting, why is only her head overweight and bloated?" None of the other pieces gives this overweight bloated look, only the head. It makes zero sense and just kills the wicked and awesome vibe. It turns it into an actual joke that makes me want to laugh at how ridiculous it looks.
---
yo this is sick. if i fail nnn for this, i won't be regretting it. 
---
can you do the same for Julie, or you don't take requests?
---
Maybe if they fixed gen rush you wouldn't see ruin as much
---
Legion by far ain't priority when it comes up to that. Aslong as LF, Plague, Clown, Wraith and Doctor are on the table, Legion definetly does NOT need a buff.
---
Don't get me wrong, I like Legion. Susie is bae. BUT aslong as there are Killers that need it much more, I don't want to see a huge shaped buff or rework for a character that doesn't need it as much as others.
---
she was 7 when her mother died. over a few decades she grew to hunting larger and larger game, and eventually humans. so she’s probably early 30’s to early 40’s
---
Hello Huntress main here,
---
First off thank you for taking the time to come up with a guide and put in effort into the questions. 
---
Secondly I have added my input and hope it helps you in your data. 
---
I look forward to seeing the guide!
---
Yeah soz
---
But it does break stalk...I mean he keeps whatever stalk progress he has on you but he can’t continue to stalk you until his power gauge refills
---
Red rank player here who wants to confirm you are correct. I am not the best looper and usually the randoms I play with arent either, but we all do some gens.
---
Give it for free? wdym, im not telling them to give free premium rift pass, just a new way to get fragments to tier up
---
Remember that 10 Fragments = 1 Tier
---
Battlepass = 75 Tiers
---
And, just so you know, I already completed the Archives challenges it offers and im, at the moment im replying, in Tier 14/75 :)
---
Wow really? If you send someone a death threat on PS4 your done
---
Because my time is limited and I'd rather spend it in a fun match
---
You're not wrong. I do my best to make trapper work at red ranks, but there have been several encounters with scummy survivors that made me wish I was playing spirit to dominate them without much effort.
---
True
---
&gt; The spirit is willing
---
Plan B, you say?
---
why would you need to combat that?
---
Like a full rework or just some buffs? and where did they announce it?
---
Spirit is different because she does not offer "reactive counterplay".
---
You don't see her vault, you don't know when she phases aslong as she's within TR. So when there's a pallet or vault between you, it's always a gamble what actually happens, without giving the Survivor ANY clue about her current action or wherebeing.
---
Nurse however, offers a lot of reactive counterplay. You know the direction she will blink to, you can estimate the range, you can use LoS-blockers and even lockers to deny her. So a Nurse is much more readable than Spirit is, thus making her actually more fair regardless of the abillity.
---
oh my fliping god that's a real thing
---
Same on PS4. As a green solo survivor i need to wait 2-5 min for a game, and as a red rank killer i find game instantly
---
You yourself admit there is next to no counterplay against her. If that's not OP then what is? Too often it feels like you'll lose no matter what you do when playing against spirit.
---
You bring up a great point, however, which is that other killer need to be buffed. I understand why a lot of killers play spirit, especially in red ranks, as she's one of the only remaining viable killers there, but from where I sit in green/purple ranks, she's utterly destroying my team every single time. When you're in lower ranks, you have a hard enough time with relatively strong killers like Freddy or hillbilly, let alone spirit.
---
But I see your point. Fixing her would ruin games for killers at red ranks, and leaving her ruins games for survivors not in red ranks. It's a lose-lose situation.
---
On PS4, I'm always running into Trapper.
---

I am unable to continue my archive via the survivor route. I had an error message that prevented me from claiming the bloodpoint reward for the previous challenge as well. I can't click on the boxed up challenge (Empathic) to start it. Now I am stuck with an incomplete archive unless I do it via the killer route. Please help.
---
&gt; Now we really need one like this but of Michael in ~~his new outfit~~ nothing
---
I'm just gonna say it and I don't give a fuck.
---
Spirit used to never be a problem because there weren't a lot of people using her and those that did made it obvious they didn't have a headset. The problem about the spirit is the same as when insta heals were announced to be getting a hard nerf. You rarely seen insta heals until then. Then it was 4 man teams popping out insta heals every match. 
---
The problem with spirit is that she has always been a 1 sided killer. What I mean by a 1 sided killer is specifically loops and mind games are all one sided. All in favor of her. Anyone with some headphones and without a hearing impairment can use her efficiently and there isn't much counter play to her. Add to the fact people are using her to tunnel people straight off of hooks and it's near impossible to get away from her in a chase after she's hit you because she's just gonna phase and instantly catch up to you. 
---
She went from a once in a while seem killer to anyone who wants to boost to red ranks on EZ mode will use her and there sure as fuck a whole lot of people who want the lowest effort into learning how to play the game on here using spirit since she takes no skill to use. That's why she is unfun.
---
We need to get bubba and freddy on switch before it can happen
---
Ooh, i actually use a similar build!  
---
I use open handed to increase range, then bond, Plunderer's instinct, and window of opportunity. It's kinda like a psychic, and i use it on Feng. It's my Madam Feng build. Lol

*Susie sprinted away from the bullshit she was hearing*
---
And your little dog to!
---
A couple of days ago my game crashed while I was being hooked, as the first hook of the game. I felt so bad, it obviously looked to the killer and my teammates like I was a salty salty jerk.
---
Idk theres only like 3 perks I think that need balanced right now. Ruin, adrenaline, and decisive. And the only thing I'd do to decisive is make the 60 seconds go twice as fast when not in the killers terror radius. Idk how to fix it with ghostface and Freddy though. I think they're doing ok. Isn't this a small conpany?
---
Yes YES *YES*

oh ok thanks for the info

---
I don’t even use decisive
---
Exactly lol
---
This pic is kinda sad.
---
I almost miss people talking about her instead of the Spirit.
---
I dunno, I've been successful with it up to red ranks. But I also eat pallets and break them every possible chance. It forces players to move to different areas. 
---
Also, breaking off the chase to check a gen is always a good thing.
---
Yes he is the hero. Best 16biit Gore game. You can play part 2 and 3 on a Genesis or emu Part 1 on turbo grafix 16 emu  mame emulator.  They are great. Cool music too. I beat them all over the years. The one the made on ps3 my friend was a tester for it. I helped him get a job at Namco. So I got nothing but love for those games.
---
This game needs a pretty big perk overhaul. We just had one of the biggest DLCs ever with NINE new perks and most of them failed to even make a dent into the meta. The game is filled with shitty perks like Monstrous Shrine, Predator, Mindbreaker, Furtive Chase, Mettle of Man, No Mither, This is not happening or Slippery Meat. 
---
The worst thing is perks that get added rarely see timely overhaul unless they are broken, so when a perk is released and it is crap then you can be sure it will likely stay crap for quite some time. The majority of Stranger Things perks could use a buff but the devs are likely busy with the next DLC. 
---
They really need to start balancing the sandbox more, not everything at once but a few perks here and there. And stop creating perks that give you a small advantage when you do some incredibly convoluted thing to activate it.
---
Maybe the delay of the archives will affect the schedule of the next ptb
---
Yea it is
---
Good Lord that Assassins Creed pic takes me back.
---
She has the mental maturity of a 6 year old, she just wants to play Houses :(
---
So you’re going to be an asshole over a difference of opinion? I bet your toxicity reflects in how you play, too.
---
No decisive needs to be active for 30 seconds and not go down while in terror radius. Once downed you have another 30 seconds to get picked up
---
Why are bps green but still the rarest offering
---
It may be because there are not a lot of players at your rank right now, what with rank reset being only a couple days away now. On the 13th rank reset happens and you should be able to get plenty of games.
---
100% this
---
I used a really dirty combo of STBFL and the Matchbox add on, which was so disgusting, Old Legion would report me for cheating.
---
8 stack M1 hit, into blink hit, almost as fast as a chainsaw down, and it ignores vaults.
---
I'm not saying I disagree with this. In fact it's so true it hurts, but at the same time, as more gens get done, more of the map becomes a dead zone that you don't need to worry about. In this sense 1 gen is not always 20% because many killers can really dog in with 1 or two gens left depending on placement. 
---
Is my point pretty moot? Yeah, I just wa t to see Ruin as not the deciding factor when I play killer or survivor
---
‘Because rather than learning how to face a killer I’d rather rage quit because I know there are no consequences to my actions of leaving a game’ 
---
Corrected it for you
---
Legion can be actually good with the right build, but yeah, most of the time you get genrushed. But I still like him as a killer
---
On Xbox too. But the problem with PC is that they type it in the game, so they don't violate anything on Steam, but only in Dead by Daylight. That means you have to make a screenshot, send it to the Devs and hope they ban that account from playing Dbd. But you can't really ban their Steam profile like on console.
---
I bought a teachable from the Shrine once and it glitched and never actually unlocked. It couldn't hurt to email BHVR support asking them to check if they're unlocked for you .

Completed a challenge in the archives and couldnt claim it, got an error message, restarted game and challenge was claimed but i didnt get any bloodpoints or rift fragments.
---
You still have an advantage on mouse and keyboard it would be detrimental to have console cross playing PC.
---
Well, I guess nobody would want long hide-and seek game, because it might be boring. However, what are the other options? 
---
If the game is left in the state of being all about chasing/looping the killer, the problem will persist. And if you increase the gen times, random survivor teams would be unbearable.
---
Me husband now
---
Honestly portals are not your main ability. Your main ability is Shred. You should work on getting good muscle memory for when you can use Shred to get a hit on a loop that you normally wouldn't be able to. This is where most of Demo's strength lies, since the Shred lunge is way longer than a normal attack.
---
When you've got some pressure rolling, you can drop portals around the map for ease of movement, but you shouldn't get too focused on making sure your portals are placed perfectly or anything.
---
Not really. It is always different people. I never really played with the same person twice in a row. You would be surprised how many play it now
---
Meanwhile ghostface in the distance
---
Oh yeah I can’t do anything useful with it either, I’m either behind a gen or in a locker the whole game. It feels damn good to see the killer though
---
I dc when people get toxic. Playing killer and getting tbagged and gen rushed, dc. Playing survivor and getting tunneled, dc.
---
Yeah I finally moved away from it and have way more fun on the killers I play now. And when I do use it, I’m a lot more comfortable being creative with other perk builds these days.
---
Because it's not fun being slugged for 4 mins, I'd rather die already and move on.
---
Thought this was an old Freddy clip for a sec
---
Can we have a David one and a Michael👀👀
---
It’s pretty great against a Freddy or a Ghostface, honestly. I found out that killers give up chases more quickly when you’re running OoO.
---
S Rank Perk, toxic SWF's are going to show their dominance by just straight up dying.
---
2 minutes at max.
---
Also getting Blocked and blinded as the Killer isnt Fun either
---
Giving 3 free fragments for a daily that often take only one game to get wouldn’t make since when normally it take around 3 games to get 1 fragment
---
This is literally me, I play legion and I always seem to get a 4k. Idk how it happens anymore. I think it's survivor stupidity most of the time
---
I literally came into comments to upvote the samination shout outs.
---
Glad it didn’t take long. XD
---
Also if you complete the rift pass, you would have enough auric cells to buy the next pass, so they’re loosing money the more fragments they hand out
---
Unbop me
---
Mind of a child btw
---
By the way the chase music I’m talking about is Utrenja - Krzysztof Penderecki
---
I'm pretty sure you can do it as long as there's a totem you can cleanse.
---
It's the lamest "strategy" that a killer can use, but if survivors fall on it.. so why stop?
---
I made a [Pinhead](https://i.imgur.com/wn272P9.jpg) concept a while back that would be interesting to see an adaptation of.
---
I made a post yesterday about Pyramid Head from silent Hill 2.  I thought his perks should be guilt based. Like he forces altruistic plays or suffer guilt.  That is what he represents inner guilt. I don't want to spoil the game. His map would be a silent Hill map. Lots of fog. Rust and darkness. The survivor would be James Sunderland. This could be unique because it might imply survivors deserve to be in the entities realm. Like they did something wrong in life and since James shows up if others can see the Pyramid Head then they most be guilty of something. Just imagine that Fog horn sound for his terror radius. Idk. I think it could work. If you have not beat silent Hill 2 I envy you. That game  has the greatest adult non video game story ever. Every time I beat that game I feel relieved and think about my own guilt. So many people say it is one of the best games of all time. I wholeheartedly agree. Anyone else think Pyramid Head would be great?
---
Imagine if BHVR cared about their customers from a business standpoint.
---
Looks like we can only dream to be thought of.
---
That perk is money lol
---
Wait why would ghostface need a rework/nerf he’s imo one of the most balanced killers that I have played and played against
---
Thank you Father.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dtxudy/when_youre_in_an_intense_chase/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Oh boy, you know you're gunna get down voted hard haha.
---
People are still parroting the idea that she's completely gutted and bad.
---
This rework did exactly what it set out to do, kept experienced Nurse's just as effective, made subpar Nurse's have a harder time getting their effortless 4ks, and made the entry level slightly easier for newer Nurse's. But that doesn't like up with the whole "BHVR wants to destroy all killers!!" mentality so people don't want to believe it.
---
When the gates are powered and you haven’t gotten a kill yet it kinda makes sense to get a kill but 4 gens? Really?
---
Tapp wont be divorcing this one
---
You can use it multiple times.
---
It’s exactly like you said. The archives are pretty much your daily. You complete challenges, you get rewards. Plus there’s more tomes coming out, which will be even more fragments
---
Chances are good your fav video game YouTuber will talk about how damn good silent Hill 2 is. Bring that oppressive atmosphere to dead by daylight. I luv it.
---
someday you people are gonna learn it's a lot more enjoyable to pretend rank doesn't exist at all
---
Whenever I end a match, the game keeps getting caught on the loading screen and I have to close the game and restart it just to play again. 
---
I'm also encountering serious lag spikes mid-game but the above is happening far more frequently.
---
I like the way you think
---
When I notice no ruin and the killer is Billy, Nurse, or Spirit, I prepare for an assblasting.
---
Thanks for this advice. Demo's a bitch for me to use personally, so these tips really help.
---
I wold be so happy if I only died to noed 20 times out of 1000 games, your math is completely false
---
Thank you, I've been trying to practice those so I'm glad you noticed! \^\^
---
I’d say have Danny as the survivor, as he’s in Doctor Sleep. Since the Entity’s realm doesn’t give a shit about time and time relativity, it could be explained away.
---
Well I don't fucking know if I'm a camping killer or not because I can't get into a match, lmao. Well, like 7 months ago when I last played this game, no I wasn't, it's a wack way to play
---
Once per totem cleansed
---
huntress is so lewdable and cute,ahh
---
I do, also yeah I get why people might like it, it’s not really a bad theme it’s just hard to listen to on repeat and it’s loud
---
fluffy
---
Mad grit
---
Can I just say that this is probably the most annoying aspect of Legion.
---
Why the hell would BHVR think it's fair that a SINGLE missed attack should stun you for 4 seconds, completely take away your power for 20 seconds and also not restore any scratch marks or blood for tracking afterwords. Especially considering the power itself is completely non-lethal.
---
Mad Grit
---
Lookin like a snac
---
Well I hope they don’t touch him because he’s one of the few I enjoy playing against
---
Ok thank u
---
np
---
Also consider this. When I hook you and go to a BBQ aurora or gen patrol if I don't see anything I'm going to start to come back at some point. I have to assume survivors are close with no aurora reads and gens close are off. So when I do come back I'm not going to tunnel you. However when I'm chasing the unhooker I could not tell you how many times the unhooked runs out in the open. Almost like they think I won't down them again. I will. So what I'm saying is there is a reason to come back. Most of the time I see the unhooked guy is because they think they are safe. Keep running and I will find the unhooker or squad who most likely is around since I seen no auroras. Also remember. I and a high amount of killers run NC. So I will be looking to hit the guy healing you. Healing or staying in the area that you got unhooked from is always risky. As for people who tunnel right off the hook. Yeah they are bad killers. When I was new I would use NOED and openly tunnel. As I got better I don't do either. I think if 1 gen is left or poped then everything is fair. I know how you feel. I play solo and I see blatant tunneling. It's going to happen.  Sorry about the rant.  I get called a tunneler all the time. Even though I don't. Sometimes it's just I accidentally ran into you. I always have try to run past to let you know I'm not going to hit you.
---
So good for confirming all the totems are gone off the map. Yes, maps with stamps can do a similar job but I feel that a toolbox or med kit is still a better item slot. 
---
Only time Detective's is annoying is when multiple gens pop at once, denying it of some usage. But it's the best perk off the Shrine I ever bought.
---
Not always true. They’re latest BIG rework with Freddy was perfect, just like their most recent additions- ghost face and demogorgon (personally) he’s a fair and balanced killer. They have some flaws like revealing not working, but survivors can counter and have potential not to get demolished instantly with skull less tactics. So I find calling recent game balances shit not true, idrk about nurse but I don’t think you’re considering all factors.
---
They made it grindy for a rea$on
---
Imagine thinking the most OP power still being in the game is a "nerf". She got a much needed rework that only gave survivors a slight chance at survival.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s “normal” but it happens on occasion. Some survivors are salty Sandras
---
You can play who you want to play jack ass. You realise there needs to be around quadruple the amount of survivors on at a time for every killer to get a game right? And don’t ask people to downvote you, because let’s be honest, you’re not right
---
That is so weird to me that they do that high up.
---
Big BS you dont learn how to face spirit
---
About the servers, are you on PC or Console?
---
Hey, she's being nice!
---
I'll always take Survivors giving presents over being tbagged.
---
Honestly it's kinda funny to me. I understand she was super powerful on pc but on console you never saw any nurses and I know why the frame rate and hard to gauge blinks ,but since her add-on rework I've seen more nurses than ever before. I like fighting console nurse even though they are pretty boosted you can normally have some fun that you really can't with other killers.
---
Yeah that could work too. But what would his perks or power be?
---
This is some r/expanddong material
---
Channeling his inner freddy from scooby doo.
---
I put 3 fragments there but it doesnt need to be 3 mandatory, I just put 3 just to show the idea, ya know?
---
Besides whats the deal, 10 fragments = 1 tier
---
Not necessarely.
---
I hope they don’t hes my main and if the nerf him I may actually leave this game because seriously what’s with them being so ready to start nerfing killer but we have yet to hear anything about a Wraith, Bubba, Trapper, Clown, Legion and Pig buff all really weak killer in-fact they seem to busy beating the Pig over the head with unneeded nerfs then buffing her
---
Its clothes not perks dont act like this is some spit in your face pay to win bullshit
---
I would too if it came from a naked David
---
Is plague high tier?
---
Damn you Frisbee!
---
There is a streamer and youtuber called BersGamer what always he plays legion he kills everybody, he is very pro with legion, is spanish
---
Whatever spin you'd like to put on it, it breaks down to Spirit is OP, I'm not a meta player, and my time is valuable and I'm not going to waste it 
---
Sure.
---
Maybe you go find it then instead of expecting everybody else to do it.
---
I get that she’s still strong but it literally is a nerf
---
The survivors are coming for everything we love maybe another killer gate?
---
Lol they should simply reduce the required amount of rift fragments per Tier to 5 but they won’t because $MONEY$
---
Pretty sure it's 4 mins unless they changed it, definitely feels like 4 mins. Also, wiki says it's 4 mins.
---
Mid
---
  
---
So are we getting the cosmetics and shrines that we missed?
---
*laughs in small game*
---
To add to this, survivors have way more reasons to DC. When I play killer, it's just me. Almost any lack of performance falls on me. Only times I DC on killer is if get corn when I'm Hag and this one time when I was Ghostface with OoO and Haddonfield with BL lol.
---
Other than that, everything else can be boiled down to my mistakes or superior plays on the survivors part. Different story as survivor.
---
Killers can tunnel you, Spirits are basically all you get at high ranks and as an actual solo survivor that shit sucks big time. Then on top of that survivors can fuck you over. Hook farming, urban evading everywhere, self-caring, not working through Ruin or finding it quickly. Pair that up with your own mistakes and survivor can turn into a real BS experience somedays.
---
So when I see someone quit out of the blue, I'm not quick to judge because most likely they got downed at a vault they shouldn't have or just got farmed for the 100th time today or their shit teammate just kept failing skillchecks over and over while healing them. 
---
I know this sub is pretty sympathetic towards killers but I would say survivors really experience a lot of crap too, especially solo survivors. Not saying you should DC whenever you want but games are supposed to be fun and this game gets unfun pretty damn quickly, regardless of winning or losing.
---
Makes me think of something you would see in Limbo
---
@ you
---
Just tryhard to Rank 1 so you get those sweet exclusive Rank 1 skins. Then MEME.
---
It's ironic. check out r/dogelore
---
Freddy 100%.
---
Prob something like Ruin, Thanatophobia, Sloppy, and Nurse's Calling/Dying Light/ Whatever you want to run for last slot.
---
I recommend watching otz latest legion video! He shows what in his opinion is the strongest legion build, and the match was quite intense. I'm in mobile now, so I can't link it unfortunately :(
---
"What you keep falling because you're dizzy? Liar, now go walk on that icy sidewalk all the way to school"
---
"You can't walk to school? Guess I'll have to take your phone away then and see if you can stand staying home then."
---
If you want to rage quit a killer you aren’t willing to learn how to play against I have no problem as the killer, 
---
my problem arises when people want certain killers nerfed because they’re salty and not willing to learn.
---
For me it’s Discordance, Thanatophobia, Ruin, and Sloppy Butcher
---
Isn't she like,waaay buffer tho?
---
Not toxic? Simply don't want to bleed out for 4 mins so the killer can up his ego...
---
It also made survivors that already had an easy time juking a Nurse even easier to juke, while also making even the most braindead of survivors capable of it
---
Hag pls ;)
---
This happened to me once but the killer trapped the hatch and, well, you know what came next.
---
Yo Angelo
---
Play killer and I’ll join your lobby. We’ll stare until death do us part.
---
What
---
As in B? Because that’s where I place her.
---
I mean, I personally find it boring. That's enough of a reason for me not to slug and prolong an already won game.
---
What kind of dumbass drops a pallet 5 seconds into a chase?
---
That’s a lie
---
Aaand another one of these kind of posts...ON NNN
---
?
---
I’m ready for David to clap these cheeks
---
I don’t even use Legion’s power bc of how bad it is for me if I miss a single hit
---
That it’s fun playing in red ranks.
---
Fix the safety pip with 11 hooks, 3 dead and one person escapes through hatch.
---
Spend the entire match hooking, not camping, breaking generators and a good time chasing, kill 3, 4th finds hatch, and it's a safety pip.
---
It's why they slug.
---
IMO of course
---
I love this as GF main. Its time to payback.
---
Ya, you're probably right. She's a solid killer, just have to spend a lot of beginning game ramping up.
---
Not the latest, but yes, I've watched it. I still like to use some perks I personally really like tho ;p
---

*Curb your Enthusiasm theme starts playing*
---
So it’s just a Yikes me for being an uneducated Boomer, got it.
---
Thanks for dropping knowledge like books falling.
---
Yeah, it’s typically a token of respect or a thanks if you’re being merciful. I do this fairly often if I go against a killer that lets me go or if I’ve seen other players bully him.
---
I had a game recently where an obviously new GhostFace got stomped and everyone else was pretty mean to him. He hid in a corner so I went and brought all the items to him in a pile and he was very excited. :D Of course, killers can’t use the items but it’s generally just a sign of respect from one player to another.
---
They pretty much just play so they can bully people. Idk about you guys but you can usually tell when they will send salty messages but they never do when you facecamp them until they die.
---
Mori me mommy
---
Plague with corrupt is huntress on steroids, you just die.
---
Its not terrible to cleanse in some situations, especially if you use fountains out of the way on larger maps.
---
You just have to run away briefly until the killer commits to one survivor, it take like, 5 seconds to determine. Then you loop back and continue the gen.
---
Xbox version is a bug
---
My favorite bit is how Wraith just dramatically uncloaks himself to make it clear that he's there before recloaking, lol.
---
You can still just loop her. If you don’t give her power then she is a normal M1 killer.
---
I’ve been told not cleansing is just as dangerous as cleansing, since you’re character loudly coughs and vomits and you have stink lines exposing your position behind cover if you try to hide. She can also one shot you obviously due to the broken status effect. But if you do cleans she gets her red vomit which will damage you on contact, this can be trouble if you’re the only one cleansing and everyone else is a one shot. My advice is to cleans at the end of the round but pick the cleans spot farthest from the exit gates. That way if she wants her precious aids sauce she has to leave to get it, allowing your team time to either open a gate or leave.
---
blindfolded gameplay
---
3k with hatch and 4k can be the difference between one pip and two. You can't really blame them for trying to secure that last pip if they're trying to rank up.
---
The issue was for xbox only as far am I'm aware.
---
Usain Bolt would probably be higher tier.
---
A live mushroom cloud, why do we have here?
---
The radiation in my eyeballs, I can feel
---
That feeling is great, right?  
---
Claudette gets found 10 seconds in and gets hit once and suddenly:  
---
*Abandoned +600*
---
Even if it’s a bug, it looks like he was exploiting it for personal gain.
---
Also the report system is a joke.
---
What about killers
---
Real honest answer is you can buy 2 other killers for the price of the stranger things DLC on PS store. Wait till new killer is out and goes on sale you will see more on ps4.
---
Did you escape?
---
They want us to suffer like actually being hooked and struggling lol
---
I understand where you're coming from and agree for the most part. Like the chances of a survivor being tunneled multiple games in a row are slim, so DC'ing because of one game being tunneled is really not the move.
---
That said, they are here to enjoy the game and for some, 3 random strangers 1 match worth of enjoyment isn't worth sticking out a crap game. Take facecamping for example. The way to properly counter it is to bust out gens and let that guy die. 
---
That's basically just asking someone to sacrifice a fun match for 3 strangers to win (that match won't be fun for anyone because the killer is occupied for so long). That's a lot to ask and is kind of unfair. So people DC.
---
Imo, it's on the devs to find a way to punish acts like face camping more (or reward survivors for their time more when being camped or slugged for an eon) and to improve the game so there are less reasons to DC, or more generally, less un-fun things in the game.
---
But again, I completely understand your point. But I guess I feel it's selfish to ask one stranger to put their fun on hold for everyone else.
---
But I mean there’s nothing wrong with that
---
Yeah
---
Belly jiggle physics.
---
Epic
---
y'all ever wonder what her cooch smells like?
---
Lowwer rank killer is strong and as such more people play killer, queue times take ages.
---
High rank survivor has the same problem.
---
rank should just be removed.
---
Are they actually 4 man or is it just the lobby is populated when you enter the match?
---
They’re nice pants
---
1/10 no Netflix
---
Oh hot mama.
---
Vomited on me, this lady has
---
Ghoulish skin, I now fucking have
---
Corrupt Purge allows a good Plag to snowball easily because even the smallest pixel of Corrupt Purge can down you. Without Corrupt Purge, she is just like any normal M1 killer. If you know how to loop, it's less dangerous to not cleanse than it is to cleanse.
---
When the gates power, cleanse at holy water fountains that are farther from the gate.
---
because r/DBDGoneGay exists
---
Killers are the same.
---
I consider myself a good nurse, and I think she deserved a nerf on missing blinks, but the map pressure lost was the thing it hurts me the most, my chases don't last much longer as I almost never double blinked after double blink, but I feel I'm loosing more games just because I move around much slower 
---
as I said, mixed feelings, the better I get with the new nurse the more I think "wow, the old one was op" while at the same time I feel more annoyed than before because I'm spending more time looking at the ground than ever, specially when I go to a gen and there is no one there so the game is blink-&gt; ground -&gt; blink -&gt; ground -&gt; double blink to try to get a survivor -&gt; ground -&gt; gen is at 0%, repeat until finding a survivor
---
She is honestly just not that fun to play against.
---
Plus it was recently fixed.
---
r/comedyseizure
---
Welcome to Dedicated servers. Your ping to the server + The Killer's ping to the server = BS like this.
---
Hits are not server sided, they are still client sided.
---
I think dead by daylight is trying to make you relate to your character a lot. Trying to make you feel what it feels, like the heart beat, you share the anxiety with your character. It would seem stupid to look at « yourself » doing a tough action while doing absolutely nothing. Also, do you think they should remove the struggle phase when you’re getting carried too?
---
Stop or imma fail
---
thanks \^\^
---
because you have time to calculate your hit which resets after every hit, effectively being able to injure the entire team in seconds. personally i think the issue is with the deep wound effect as it seems to be absolutely useless. its so easy and quick for survivors to mend (they can be done by the time you hit the last guy on the team) as if it never even happened. it doesnt really slow the game down and no one in their right mind is gonna let the timer run out, meaning theres no way to down anyone with it either.
---
All good man, just a lighthearted joke :)
---
Isn't she really young
---
Not really, you can guess what she'll do with 90% accuracy. 
---
Pallets stop her. Windows stop her. Sounds can really confuse the shit out of her and you can mess with her quite well if you do it right. And if you don't get hit on the phase walk, she's a 4.4m/s killer for about 20 seconds. Yeah, she's really challenging once you're injured, I won't deny that, but you know what, I'd go as far as to say she's easy to deal with if you're not. You can confuse her so damn easily at that stage. I just don't undrestand the struggle your side seems to be going through. I honestly wish I could see your gameplay against her to figure it out.
---
Nope. If you actually 3hook 3 of survivors without letting them gen rush you during the first part of the game, you'll pip even if one escape.
---
If you dominated the match but the last guy escape through hatch you will had iridescent gatekeeper and chaser, with gold in Malicious and either gold or silver in Devout. Which is a pip even in high rank.
---
Most of the time killers in high rank black pip while 3 or 4K 'cause they they one or two hooked some survivors and don't hit enough. If you tunnel someone, instead of hitting him 6 times you only hit him 4 times for exemple 'cause he would't have time to heal.
---
If you focus too much on killing you may make yourself lose 'cause for the game you had it too easy.
---
I'll edit my comment after reading it but could we start making the lore based text in a different font? There's always so much noise with these posts. 
---
I've seen a few suggestions about this idea, tbh i think it would just be annoying, Killers would obviously use them to completely break any attempt to loop that exists in addition to throwing them through a pallet. It doesn't look like a very balanced idea in any regard since he's already one of the fastest killers
---
How old are you. I find it had to believe that you are anything over 10
---
It's a joke bro, this is a real bruh moment for you
---
Idk but the waiting on the ground while your friends dont pick you up is getting annoying. Or having the killer just follow you for a minute
---
You’re a moron and deserve your downvotes
---
Oh word so you do think the same thing about all survivors running Adrenalin and Dead Hard and shit with their styptics
---
Huh, interesting opinion. For me on killer side, i don't mind running one of the same perk if it means the game can last longer, cause in the end, its the killer and addons that really change up the playstyle for me.
---
Basic m1 killer with permanent noed and ability to hear them a mile away. I hear what you’re saying though. Would you agree that the one option is not way better then the other? Or do you feel like someone who  cleanses is bad or
---
Throwing?
---
Or buff the numbers so it's actually worth considering
---
The Plague is a lose/lose match IMO. The characters sucks and should never have been added in the first place.
---
I love the idea but I would say they apply deep wounds but also vanish after hit, keep the flashlight thing to make it a easy counter
---
You're right. But what I mean was, I've seen a few Ghostfaces who really took advantage of that stealth masterfully. I think there might be something there that could make him very viable at high ranks and if more people figure it out, he'll be next in line.
---
She a bad bitch, only character I can get a perfect game with 8 K bps all 4 categories &amp; 4 kill, shes also the only character that I can’t be looped with.
---
I think it should be reworked just because sometimes you get a lag spike and just die even though you were mashing the whole time.
---
If the Nurse was easy to juke before then she wasn't a good Nurse and she was getting carried by 3 blinks and range.
---
If you are "simply really good with her" then her change shouldn't give you problems, as her blinks are just the way they were.
---
Maybe let prayer beads work like everyone on the whole map hear her.. so you know when she is using it, but you don't know if she comes to you or another person
---
did you watch the video?
---
That’s not facecamping, killer isn’t in their face.
---
Sure man, whatever you say. If you aren't talking out of your ass, and actually have a method of consistantly outplaying Spirits without relying on luck or the guy playing Spirit being useless, we'd all love to know it. Go hit up Scott Jund and showcase your method, otherwise shut your trap and accept that she's bullshit.
---
Uh, no they're not. They have a base speed of 115%, like a few other killers. This would be replacing their current power, Deep Wound, which really just sucks ass.
---
Hmmmm.... 
---
 Perks: 
---
Maybe something like "Here's Johnny!" Ability to destroy pallets or possibly windows? Pallets are increased speed (similar to Brutal Stength), but Jack may also swing an axe and destroy the windows so that he can walk through without vaulting? 
---
"Hair of the Dog"- after a chase for X amount of minutes, Jack becomes enraged and gains speed and inflicts broken status on hit survivors. Possible add-on to make it an insta-down? 
---
Thats all I can think of for perks. 
---
Ability: 
---
"All Work and No Play" Jack devolves throughout the game, each survivor sacrificed causes his connection to the Entity to get interfered with (by the Overlook maybe?). Jacks terror radius becomes spotty, sonetimes playing as if right behind the survivor, other times it disappears. The red stain may disappear or appear behind a survivor like in Tier 3(2?) madness for the Doctor. And any other affects that my happen. Those are only two examples tho
---
See, you say that. But spirit has been out for more than half a year and no one knows how to play against her. There’s ways to do better and ways to do worse, but there’s no real counters. If the best survivors in the game haven’t figured out a counter despite more than half a year passing it’s probably because she doesn’t have a counter. And no, iron will isn’t a counter as it’s countered by stridor. Spine chill isn’t a counter either as it only helps you avoid a gen grab, not when you’re in chase
---
Sarcasm.
---
Real talk she is a giant child and this makes me wildly uncomfortable

See, the thing is I dont blame them per se, I just dont want to sit there for fucking ages after already having lost and theres nothing I can do about it.  Played against a Suzy yesterday that downed me as the last survivor, then closed hatch and just watched me bleed out not doing, waiting until right before I died before hooking me.  I dont blame people for slugging for a 4k, but I would prefer some way to kind of 'opt out' without losing all my bp.  
---
But I also understand why that wouldn't really be possible since that would basically just be a no downside dc then
---
I can relate but with The Huntress. I haven't saw one that hasn't killed me, though I'm not complaining. I love The Huntress
---
True, Im a nurse main and in my opinion she is still very good. Maybe now spirit is better but? Id say its just little bit harder to learn for new players. She still has what makes her good. The blinks that can go through walls (fuck the 3 blink accessory)
---
That's what I missed, the Serum expires two weeks after The Rift ends, I thought after the event \^\^
---
why can you not link a video on mobile ?
---
it's possible
---
Whatever dude, no matter how much you try to justify her bullshit, she's still getting nerfed, so guess who's getting the last laugh here.
---
He probably didn’t go the end, the video was well cut

---
A wraith relying on speed boost, and camping while trying to counter borrowed time. Yes this sound very refreshing.
---
That's what everyone says, "She'll just be a basic m1 killer." Like m1 killers can't fucking wreck people. Add to that constant exposed like status, you can't hide in lockers or vault anything without giving away your location, not to mention all the extra noise + scratch marks.  
---
..and if she has that add on that reveals your aura? Fuck man. I'm cleansing.
---
How is he weak ?
---
Hopefully he sets a new precedent for streamers
---
I like corrupt, pop, brutal, and thana, works decently at red ranks
---
So what do you propose? A nerf? What would you change?
---
Detection perks like whispers(which is common fairly common at high ranks) can entirely negate attempts at stealth play, so by cleansing, you’ve went from facing an easily loop-able perms-T3 Myers, to a Machine Gun wielding Huntress who probably has a good idea where you are anyways if she had the sense to bring a tracking perk and has a decent headset. There are some killers in the game that you’re better off not trying to stealth around, Doctor and Plague are two big examples of that. I don’t think you’re necessarily bad if you cleanse, but you’re definitely misguided if you think giving the killer a minigun is worth a single health state and marginally improved stealth
---
Where’s the hairy leg? And chest?
---
Same. It just annoys me how people have their mind set on one way to vs her and when I do cleanse so many people throw the game.
---
Can you give me your specs?
---
Stridor cancels out iron will, spine chill isn’t very helpful in a chase and her shards glow SOMETIMES on the default cosmetics. If she’s wearing another cosmetic set it never happens
---
His lunge is abysmal. The only thing going for him is the portals for better map coverage but unlike hag traps they cant be used to hep during a chase. So basically he’s just an m1 killer that can take like 10 seconds and telegraph loudly that he’s teleporting to 1 of 3-4 areas on the map that he had to take the time to set up and which can also be destroyed. So yea...
---
you can generally tell when its an intentional dc or a disconnect, on an inentional dc after you press "leave match" it creates a soundque as the player icon turns to the dc icon, whilst on another disconnect where they didn't press "leave match" it just shows the dc icon without the soundque
---
The devs said in the past that they want it that way. It’s supposed to be a struggle. In my opinion it’s just bad game design though.

I ship nurse x huntress
---
I'm a 50/50 player. I main trapper :)
---
I really wanted to read the end chat, if he didnt smash the click button to quit the lobby the fast as he can
---
He can relate a little to Billy. Knowing when to and when not to use shred is an important skill as well as knowing how to aim it.
---
Nice.
---
Any time I play against Spirit, I don't even try the guessing game bullshit at pallets. I just start running. See her in the distance? Run. Hear phasing? Run. Think she's phasing up onto you? Drop a pallet and hope she didn't go around the loop, then run.
---
It's worked out so far, but I haven't been going against good spirits. Just some boosted people playing her.
---
All characters are over 18 and the huntress is the hottest one
---
It comes up because it's mentioned in her lore, iirc. Also I didn't wanna start an argument, I just think it's inappropriate. I simply said I wouldn't like to fuck someone who talks like a baby. But I heard that's also a fetish so whatever haha
---
Edit: I do play her myself, she's actually my main killer. I just wanted to state my opinion. Nothing wrong with that lol
---
The people who claim a killer perk that survivors have an opportunity to turn off is op then they don't know much about game balance. Change my mind.
---
She's been killing people since before the world war right? I thought I read a blurb about her raiding villages for young girls to raise. And when a german battalion traveled through the forest they all got murdered. That's where the infantry belt add on came from right?
---
Only for IOS or android 8/9 or also for Android 7
---
Maybe it’s just that people don’t know how to play him, place their portals in bad spots, don’t take care of their portals, etc. In the end he’s basically an M1 killer as rank 12 and above will be able dodge his power.
---
Lol. Pyramid Head apparently represents sexual violence, and has been caught raping other monsters, so...
---
DJ Blyatman &amp; Russian Village Boys - Cyka Blyat
---
This has been tested repeatedly. You’re wrong. On her default cosmetics it works occasionally, but it also happens randomly sometimes. They don’t flow because she’s phasing, they just randomly glow and people have conflated the two. If she stops moving you can see them glow, but if she stops moving she probably is or is about to phase. They don’t glow because she phases, you just pavloved yourself into thinking it does
---
The lowest you could get was 0 I thought.
---
Yea like other than huntress and nurse there’s really nothing a mouse and keyboard gives advantage over. Everytime i see marth88 playing survivor he always uses an xbox controller and he’s definitely in the super top level of players.
---
Is to never play as him because he's not only boring in design but also a low tier killer.
---
115% is the fastest class of killer bud. He's one of the fastest.
---
Well I wasn't sure, so I responded in this way.
---
No borrowed time with we're going to farm forever? I love this
---
Someone didn't read the new mod rules
---
i personally run thanatophobia/sloppy/STBFL/discordance.
---
that is actually a /REALLY/ good idea. however, i feel like some limitations should be placed so its not too powerful.
---
1. 25 seconds seems like a really long time. for example one health stage on a hook lasts 60 seconds, meaning if a legion was guarding it, they’d be there for the duration of half a health stage, which could be devastating if you’re applying pressure as well. i’d have it around 15 seconds and 25 max with addons.
---
2. you said the legions could attack other players, essentially meaning there would be multiple killers on the map that survivors would have to be wary of. i think if the legions could attack other players, they should only be able to apply the deep wound status effect. (maybe you, the actual killer, cant go into frenzy but you can summon legions to go into frenzy for you)
---
3. instead of summoning legions, it might be more realistic (based on the game mechanics) to instead have them work more like traps. you could ‘place down’ a legion, having them guard a spot, and when someone entered their terror radius they’d go into action.
---
4. there has to be something alongside the time limit to determine when the summoned legions are done to ensure they cant do too much damage. maybe if they miss a hit, get stunned, etc theyll disappear, also with a noise notification.
---
Well you use self care, so I see nothing wrong
---
IMO a few factors, if you think she’s got the vomit aura add on or apples, I’d cleanse. 
---
If not I wouldn’t simply because it’s much easier to run a killer around that’s trying to physically hit you rather than hit you with her power.
---
How do I play this?
---
Freddy counters BT for no real reason (yes I know how to make it work but still), which I think is an oversight. Other than that I agree.

---
Ain't no fuckin way spirit is better because spirit's map traversal is crap compared to nurse (like most killers) and her chase speed is still, in most cases, slower than nurse.
---
&gt; This rework did exactly what it set out to do, kept experienced Nurse's just as effective
---
Not literally just as effective, no. 
---
&gt; made subpar Nurse's have a harder time getting **their effortless 4ks**
---
hahahahahaha
---
&gt; made the entry level slightly easier for newer Nurse's
---
Ok, maybe, but being a new nurse is still the worst experience in the game even after being made "slightly easier" and something you have to go through for hours and hours until you start winning sometimes.
---
I have I phone 11
---
I once did it to my friend but it wasn't DBD. He didn't laugh though. Not because it wasn't funny (cuz it was), but because he had crushed lungs.
---
So? Their power is terrible. It needs to be changed.
---
I like some killers to be better than others, especially the nurse, and I primarily play as survivor. It’s more terrifying to not know who the killer is, hoping it’s an easier One to win against, and then hear her screech and think, “crap, I’m done for.” I find losing can be just as fun as winning, especially when the killer is skilled enough to play as the nurse and win.
---
I'm not sure, cause I am minimalist in real too. But I love hoarding digital stuff. Like my bank account. I don't like to spend a lot of money. I like seeing the number grow. It feels the same when I see the numbers grow on the items.
---
But the I do like to collect irl stuff too mainly TCG I played. Once I obtained two master sets I sold everything else. And they are all in their zipfolios tucked away for when I play
---
When there are only two people(1 survivor 1 killer) the hatch spawns at 0 gens done. If you mean there are two survivors then there’s 3 people in the match so you need to finish 3 gens for it to spawn.
---
Your art is friggin' amazing.
---
Wow that sucks, they were the best kind of shit posts on here, guess I'll just delete it
---
I have Demo and play him, but not frequently just because his split powers are a lot to keep track of and I'm not a huge fan of how loud and clunkily he walks (I like it from the point of view of his character design, but I personally prefer to play quieter and stealthier killers)
---
But I'm a PS4 player so maybe I will play around with his perks and take him out for a few games soon! I still can't decide on how I want to design his loadout....
---
The rule is survivors alive + 1 = gens done, for the hatch to spawn.  
---
Example: 2 survivors alive, 3 gens done; hatch has spawned.
---
Ah, I see what you mean. I still don't think it's that terrible of an idea. If modified, it would probably turn out to be better than Legion's base power (and make more sense for a group of teenagers). The added ability to send members running off could probably be removed.
---
&gt;Ghostface cock dude
---
well I can’t say I ever thought I’d read that
---
And I miss.
---
Legion - four killers. They are on the map at the same time. 3 in the lockers and one controlled by you. You can hide in the locker and switch to a character in a different locker.
---
If survivor tries to hide in a locker occupied by Legion, survivor gets stabbed and has to mend. Killer also recieve notification.
---
Or/and
---
Legion can shape-shift into a survivor (spinechill still works) he/she shape-shift back to its form after an attack action
---
EDIT: But shape-shifting idea would suit some other killer better. Some future killer maybe
---
Same thing happens with Legion sometimes on this sub.
---
Like are you for real?
---
just dont hold r2
---
My dude it’s literally owned by his family now.
---
They weren't tho
---
She is in college
---
Since when? That’s news to me. New Line/WB has always had the rights since the original
---
But you can’t scan a larger area as your running, plus after using it for awhile you figure out how to use it very effectively and pinpoint totem spots quicker, then the devs change that and it’s back to square one on new spots... 
---
I always run small game on any survivor and it will always be a built in perk for me. I wish they would give it a slight buff with cleansing speeds are increased 20%
---
Well they were in my opinion the best shitposts on here, but everyone has a different opinion
---
That’s the problem, I’m not a game designer. I’m not gonna pretend that I have some kind of solution that will keep her fun to play as and make her fun to play against, because I don’t. You can understand something is broken and needs changed or fixed without knowing how to fix it yourself
---
Because after a set amount of time the rights default to the original creator.
---
Feng is probably the best starter chatacter. Use Windows. Dont throw down every pallet
---
Yeah well if i tap it theres an even bigger chance it will miss
---
Bringing problems to the attention of the devs is definitely a way to help them recognize what's going on. They do lurk this sub afterall. Many people complain already, maybe if more will they will do something about it. They already know about Legion's situation rn, thanks to this sub. Didn't they teach you that apathy is a terrible ideology?
---
I've been spamming him for a week or two and I'm doing pretty good. You can't always dodge the shred and it sometimes completely cancel some loops and they have to throw the pallet earlier. Also you can easily fake that you want to break the pallet with Shred, the same way you do it with Billy, and it makes the survivor cocky and not drop the pallet, giving you a free hit. Also as you said, it can be used to make the survivor zigzag, wasting a lot of time and ground while you get closer for a M1 hit.
---
The undetectable effect isn't that useless, it's here so that the survivors aren't a 100% sure that you teleport near them. And no matter what, it's still a pretty good map pressure tool as you can easily find a new target if you placed a good portal and use BBQ. I'd say he's mid tier, probably a tiny bit better than that even.
---
Sure clearly different, but nurse is also clearly better.
---
The Reddit app now watermarks pictures if you save them, crediting the OP.
---
I can play legion perkless and wreck people. He’s a bit boring to play imo. I float between purple and green rank on my second devotion for reference.
---
So you can play mobilally.
---
This is a cool build; I would definitely love this on Claudette, Tapp or Nancy because I see them as being the most shrewdly intelligent of the survivors
---
(Cackles in 3-gen Hag)
---
Isn’t that the whole point of the tome challenges?
---
It would've been perfect for a Nurse map considering she's supposed to be connected to the void.
---
Have you done that because I've been on their apps store and it never works.
---
But you can't even see the outfit when you play as killer. I never understood the killer outfits because of this. If I pay for an outfit, I want to be able to see it while I play the character, not just during the lobby screens.
---
Yeah there was a glitch last week where people could see ahead and the challenges were the same. So this looks like the final product for challenges. I’m hoping for the next set of challenges they lower the difficulty for some of them, we will see. Thankfully it’s not a required purchase and doesn’t add a ton so it’ll be fine.
---
Oh wow you are correct, news to me my mistake.
---
Never cleanse till the end.  Whats the point?  You're either going to touch something and get infected again, shell find you and do it, etc etc etc
---
I subscribe to /cringe and I could post 80% of these comments lol yikes
---
I have, as has people like Scott jund. If you’re that convinced that it’s a real thing then hit up Scott Jund on either YouTube or twitch and take up his challenge. Prove to everyone that you know how to counter spirt so we can finally “just adapt”
---
I can help you out whenever you get the time. Just pm me your username. I’m a lot better at explaining things in voice
---
Lol and people think crossplay is gonna work like the devs designed it to. Welcome to DBD where everything has a bug or glitch and if it’s something new, it won’t work properly.
---
Not really terrible, just unbalanced which in practice would make it very annoying.
---
She's good but not #1 anymore.
---
I actually really like that. Window destruction would be a super strong perk though
---
I was really torn as to if I should post there or not! Considering it's very VERY NSFW where as this is quite mild in comparison lol
---
Shitposting=bringing something to the dev's attention got it bc they're gonna take you seriously 😂 And no it's not apathy it's common sense
---
Well they probably never played him. He looks good on paper but when you actually play him you see the cracks.
---
Where is this screen shot from? The animation style looks familiar
---
Somebody didn't leave so I'm guessing it's steve
---
Ruin is a good perk to go against because it gives false confidence to the killer. They generally have worse gen patrol because they use it as a crutch.
---
I learned everything by watching good players like umbra or tru3ta1ent on twitch..if you have time try and watch them
---
I wouldn't say they're based on dark web hackers per se, but I think that's a cool interpretation of their hoodies and masks (kind of like Mr. Robot?) and it might be fun to try design a hacker's build using perks that evoke intellectual problem solving (Surveillance, Furtive Chase?, Hangman's Trick?, idk!)
---
I got called a sweatlord for playing plague
---
Yah and 2 wore out controllers along with many others having wore out keyboards because a few incompetent devs can’t simply just change the action to holding a button down. I should mail them the broke controllers and say “here you guys can use these since you have a piss poor design feature”
---
The team can continue trying to balance the game based on the numbers and statistics they collect, but this game will never be close to balanced, even if they had a larger staff to do it.
---
First off, there are too many perks. There are just over 70 perks for survivor, and over 60 for killer. Perks can be used in combination with others sometimes, and perks can be used to counter others. The number of perk combinations for survivor alone is over 970000 (when using a full perk loadout). Sure, you don't have to test even close to that many combinations, but even if you had to test 1% of that number, it would take a long time. Now, factor in interaction with killer perks. It quickly becomes an extremely difficult exercise.
---
Second, balancing perks doesn't take in to account the human factor. You can have a game that gives everyone the same weapons, same number of players on each team, etc, and the game still won't be balanced due to matchmaking, or connection speeds. Skill is difficult to determine in DBD. I may be running the best perks, but if I suck at other fundamentals, it's not going to make a difference. In a top tier player's hands, even some of the worst perks could be a dangerous thing.
---
Combining both of the previous points, the randomness of everyone's loadouts (including items and add-ons), can change a game entirely. If all the survivors are running Small Game, the killer can say goodbye to their totem perks. If someone is carrying a flashlight vs a Hag, her traps around the hook become a minor nuisance.
---
The team at BHVR has been actively working on balancing the game, but they should only do so much at one time. In the last year, we've seen perk changes, killer power changes, map reworks. Having a larger team means that if there are more changes, there are more things that could conflict with each other. We don't want one part of the team balancing a perk that conflicts with a new killer rework, or makes a new map design not work.
---
Old legion was justified though. Unlimited mending was way too broken.
---
You know it's possible to bring up an issue through humor and sarcasm right? Your common sense is very dimwitted
---
I know. So what should be changed? Just wondering
---
Legion should honestly be a Puppet Character. You'd have all four members on the map, but three are "immersed" where you leave them and have to be manually swapped to.
---
It's either that or code simple AI.
---
And other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself
---
His ability is to give someone a deep wound and then trigger killer's instinct to show you where the next survivor is. Go stab him.  
---
He's really good at keeping everyone injured.
---
xD
---
Why are you getting so upset when I'm trying to have a discussion with you ?
---
You can only enable/disable it in the main menu of dbd. (Where you choose to play as killer or survivor)
---
This is too op, please nerf this.
---
I don't cleanse unless other people start to. The worst situation is when everyone's broken and one person gives her corrupt purge.
---
I always wondered this too, and once spent an absurd amount of time trying to figure out how to pick up the item a survivor left me.
---
There is the possibly of up to a 6 rank discrepancy between Survivors and Killers  in order to provide players with quicker matches. This is intended.
---
You must suck if you can’t pull a win with spirit
---
100% agree. A way I found that helps discourage any DC or first hooks from me and is playing super altruistically at Endgame. If I know I could escape and survive, I basically won, so I'll go try to make sure everyone gets out. Helps care less about surviving and can lead to some fun moments!
---
Oh I know, it’s just frustrating when it’s all of my matches
---
Yea u got to put in a zip code from one of Denmark’s hotel
---
wait didnt it come out like today? There was a thing about it on the news page when i opened it like 3 hours ago
---
“Mind games” is part of the games terminology now, and thus has a different definition in this context. Same as “camping” or “tunneling” have different definitions in this community than in the real world. A mind game against an unsuspecting survivor is a guessing game, but a good survivor knows about mindgames and knows how to counter it. It becomes two players trying to force the opponent to make a mistake, thus requiring skill. Spirit just stands there, requiring no skill
---
like what you said about a legion breaking a pallet, when you placed down a legion theyd do whatever necessary action there is to do within their range (breaking a pallet, kicking a gen) and if there are no nearby survivors theyd then stand guard. once a survivor gets within range, they’d give chase. since theyd only be able to apply the deep wound status effect i’d consider it fair for them to be able to detect any survivor not in a locker within range, despite whether he can visually see them or not.
---
Sometimes sure, but by and large a perk that can be turned off by survivors should be stronger than one that's active from start to finish no matter what.
---
You forgot to put spirit somewhere along your title of description, fail
---
I play both sides and she's boring to play against, single player mode killer, he is the one coin flipping if he guesses right or not.
---
It was worth the full watch, I love it when things just all into place like this. Trapper is so much set up, but so rewarding when it works out.

My points are listed above on why I cleanse. I don’t want the killer to have permanent noed with vomit sounds.  I like being able to hide when I need to. I see your point about touching something and getting it anyway. I usually do okay with finding a gen that’s not infected nearby though.
---
You can actually get blinded after shredding a pallet, I've been spamming him lately and I can tell you, you can, maybe not on standard flashlights, but you definetely can !
---
It was a bug, I fixed it back.
---
Aw, it's so cute and small.  
---
26 of these babies and maybe the doors will open.
---
Yeah, I think he's in a good spot. Not a guaranteed win but definitely can hold is own in any match up.
---
It's the nurse effect where the killers power can be repeatively spammed with little repercussion. That allowed her to constantly chase a survivor through multiple "cooldowns". 
---
For plague It actually is annoying to be doing well in a chase, but she doesn't loose enough speed when throwing up so she'll always keep pace. If she decides to get closer before throwing up you can pretty much file a report from abuse form because there's nothing you can really do. It feels awful and when she throws up on you until you're broken for a lone wack...the salt is coming. The clown would also fall in this category as his gas effect in a chase = a free hit and he can refill the mixture on a down in addition to having 4-5 canisters on average. Most killers are currently full of ability spam aside from the now- balanced Nurse and huntress and scream but he can just brute force a chase with 115% MS as a stealth killer making a double edged sword. 
---
So i see an argument for most of them as it's just annoying and Reddit is a loud speaker
---
Rank 2 Survivor
---
I havent seen it yet, but I wouldnt doubt it with a strong flashlight
---
Still think shapeshifting would be a cool idea for pennywise if he ever gets added to the game. I imagine though if the power was only to turn into a survivor he'd be shut down hard by swf and just be an m1 killer sadly :(
---
I kill myself on hook out of spite if a team mate farms me in front of the killer and I go down instantly again. I’m not in this game to get someone 1,000 altruism points or help them with their daily.
---
Nah bro, that guy that's kinda far away from the group looks like hes about to dip
---
I mean I don’t really get to play all that often so yeah I’m definitely not that great at this game yet
---
It's not permanent NOED.  NOED is dangerous because by end game most pallets are gone, you're one shot, AND they have a speed boost.  Plague is just a normal m1 killer.  If you good at looping you won't have a problem. 
---
Ah see you try and hide.  While I dont. No need.
---
I still manage to do well with them and I'm having tons of fun since I bought them.
---
However I can't deny that there's so many things not working properly about them and honestly by now Legion should  be a top priority rework.
---
I can usually tell just how salty they'll be in end game on how they play, yeah. Doesn't make it any more fun though!
---
I just had a full prestige, red rank Laurie D/C from a match because she thought she was being sly by looping me around the Haddonfield fences, but little did she know that killers can swing through the openings in them. She just stood there, and left. Couldn't accept that she screwed up. 
---
I don't get it!
---
It was in some dev stream a while back i think. Someone in chat asked about legion because they thought he wasn’t in a good place, devs said they were looking into him.
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
&gt;and more often than not survivors are spread out around the map rather than all grouped together.
---
which is already a worst-case scenario for legion no matter how you slice it. and that's why you don't use power unless you're sure there's multiple survivors nearby (...unless you run stbfl but then you focus on one target anyway and not run across the map unless you're sure you get there in time). *you also use frenzy for info*, so yeah.
---
&gt; how well the frenzy does to slow the game down is almost purely circumstantial to map, perks, and skill. there are other circumstantial powers, yes, but the extent to which the legions frenzy can be either completely useless or extremely effective is kind of ridiculous. 
---
true, but saying blatantly that deep wound is useless is an exaggeration. 
---
his power helps him get the first hit, get info on nearby survivors, stack stbfl, or (try to) get in a good position before ending it so maaybe you'll end the chase a bit earlier. or sometimes to travel quickly across the map but it's really rare. plus stalling the game greatly. it won't really be "completely useless" even in the worst scenario.
---
Maybe combine it with territorial imperative to make the basement a lot scarier
---
People are already asking for a nerf bec of his power to slow gen speed which is bs but the seeds for nerfs are rising
---
yea #1 in the least played killer...
---
Even if it was a joke, it does take courage to post something online like this. ^^ So seeing a comment like your's could dishearten someone genuinely trying!

I dont either. I'm on console so they have to go out of there way and send me a message. Sometimes if I can a toxic person and they message me I just send short and sweet replies. That usually shuts stuff down quick.
---
Oh, I am so sorry that you got 4K. Lemme call Gypsy Blanchard and tell her your sob story, it’ll make her cry for sure
---
This is really cool.
---
Imagine the neckbeards who get off to video game killers
---
she ded
---
this was posted almost 3 months ago..?
---
Lol ok, I mean I do try and find it, sorry If rather working through it or rescuing the teammates that are going down to the killer.
---
what?
---
lmao what
---
I can’t change my mind even a little bit because you aren’t actually providing a good argument. You didn’t even address why you thought I was only talking about killer or why you thought I was implying killer should be able to play without perks. I say this as objectively as possible, it feels like you, or at least your argument, are simply biased against killers. But I think it’s very clear that you’re at your wits’ end and realize I have a point considering you’re *only* trying to insult me now and that you have no intention to actually try to argue logically.
---
Or don't grind that hard and relax.
---
Next tome LEVEL will unlock soon and you got 59 days to go.
---
Just 1 tier per days is enough.
---
Rift supposed to keep you "occupation" until next big thing/chapter.
---
Just relax man , you will get your free stuff :) no need to rush (like the narrator).
---
You have learned a lot. Mainly that that's why you get people using a single killer with the most op build because if they don't they get everything you complain about. And in turn it's why the other side uses all its op perks and all that shit. But now that you can see why both sides are assholes and why no one ever seems happy playing this game
---
I always tell my friend that the Huntress is the hottest killer (even considering girl legion), this will help me prove it. Thanks
---
And us Trapper + Wraith fans over here just suffer eternally
---
Not worth tapping, tbh. Just do the gen normally, and if you don't get a great it's better to just wait the few seconds and get back to working. It almost renders the perk null if you don't get like 20 skill checks. 
---
Just make sure to at least hit the regular skill checks, and you're golden!
---
Why the hell would BHVR think that a 110% speed killer that can't down survivors in a single hit and needs 5 hits to down someone was a good idea?
---
 2018 Azarofs place had only 1 gate
---
Well I mean spirit, nurse, plague, and trapper go against the normal way to play. It's almost as if when you play against a different killer, you adapt to the way that killer plays. Crazy I know
---
Ahh that's a shame, so if I'm playing on game pass do I not get to play with console/steam players? I gave up at around 35 minutes btw and still no match.
---
It’s noed without the need to Guard a totem and able to hear survivors a mile away.  I find it hard to believe you don’t try to hide at least once a game behind a rock or tree if you hear the heartbeat coming. If she doesn’t find you then hiding just wasted a lot of her time.  I’m not talking about playing stealthy all game but even just looping around a rock while waiting to rescue a teammate becomes impossible.
---
And I hit the great skill check thinking I missed 0-0
---

is it suppose to be a problem
---
I love playing surv, excuse me
---
Which of the killers did you try?
---
I hated queuing killer too until I found out I only like Trapper and Pig.
---
You were always able to detect GF and Pig in stalk.
---
I always find stuff like these really cool. Something id like to get into as a hobby. Where do u go for supplies and what not ?
---
this is how i feel when i chew 5 gum
---
I'm not a stealthy player to begin with, so I guess it doesn't affect me too much. If I've got a good loop or jungle gym nearby, I'm usually good for a while.
---
We all play the game differently, and have different levels of comfort with certain things. I play alone most of the time, so I'm used to playing injured. (I also run Dead Hard, which can give me another chance when I'm injured.)
---
They could of at least called you a piece of sentient vomit.
---
The real question here is why a broken key? If you just wanted to see the obsession’s aura wouldn’t it be better to just bring a dull or skeleton key since it doesn’t use up charges and even more so with your weaved ring... idk you do you but key add ons are bugged some what you lose a random one most often
---
PC.
---
I've been experiencing the NAT type error since dedicated servers were launched, and it prevented me from connecting to 3 out of 5 lobbies. I opened the required ports on my router, I gave permissions to DBD in the firewall settings, but nothing helped. But at least I could play SOMEHOW.
---
AND yesterday it just got even WORSE, and I'm yet to find a single match without getting the error. Like WTF? DBD is the only multiplayer game that I had such an issue with. I visited the official forums and I'm definitely not the only one.
---
It's still not worth it against a plague.  AoE huntress?  Or wraith?  I'll take my chances with wraith.
---
Thanks edgeworth
---
It'd make more sense if they just gave you a little profile badge to show that you obtained the ORIGINAL generation of these and then made them regular items.
---
For me, at least, just a little icon only I can see is as good as having one of the originals in my inventory.
---
these were just based on how i play as legion (hint: not bad but not good either) and it seems your big brain figured out how to correctly optimize the use of frenzy, so im gonna play a game or two with those tips in mind and then ill get back to you. (this isnt sarcasm i just have dry exaggeration syndrome)
---
Or right hear me out just DC /s
---
Wyd?
---
She's worthless at top ranks because her power doesn't aid her chase. She's very pubstomp because she renders everyone Broken.
---
yo good luck man! hope you don't get 4 blendettes who gensrush you without even getting seen by you.
---
Im a Tapp main! yeahh cause hes a detective and hes supposed to go 'hmmm...' smartly
---
Yeah, that's a lot of effort just to be an ass, lol. You'd think people wouldn't go through it? But I guess, in some cases, you're just THAT angry.
---
I use free software to 3d print on a $200ender 3. Just some sandpaper snd acrylic paint after printing it. U can see [my last post](https://imgur.com/l5KWI15) for a raw print off the bed. Actually, everything in that photo is right off the bed without any paint.
---
I can’t run Iron Will, i’m busy running Small Game to counter Trapper, Hag and Freddy, Spine Chill and Premonition to Counter Wraith, Myers, Pig and Ghostface, Calm Spirit to counter Clown and Doctor, Dead Hard to counter Huntress, Nurse and Plague and Decisive Strike to counter the tunnellers. 
---
See how silly it sounds telling players to run a specific perk to attempt to counter a Killer?
---
Can i get me special bing bong?
---
That’s not the reason ..... it’s like this cycle killer plays another killer for fun but gets  shits on by gen rush and toxicity then people ask why are there nurses and spirit been playing a lot. Call me wrong if u want to but this is actually the reason
---
whats worse: 4 blendettes who stealth their way through the whole game or 4 neon neas who are ballsy because they know you cant hit them
---
They dont understand it's just a game and they dont have to treat people badly to feed their egos. It is what it is
---
This subreddit is full of dipshit survivor mains
---
Although I prefer noed than ruin though. Noed is just pity kills, ive already played the game I dont mind if the killer gets his turn. Ruin? Ruin messes with my IQ
---
I dc when I get the kind of survivors who go to the point to kill their teammates - SANDBAGGING &gt;:(
---
I know we will never get a deaf survivor (cos gameplay reasons), but I'm very happy with representation in this game. Autistic people are underrepresented and when they are it's pretty much clichés on top of clichés.
---
Hope we will get a LGBTQI+ survivors too!
---
Why are you being downvoted this is true lol
---
We found a killer main people!!
---
It’s in the trailer, all promo material, and literally in first 5 minutes of the game.
---
“Spoiler”
---
You'll never improve at the game and you're ruining it for 4 other players by doing that.
---
Bring on the Hazbin Hotel memes please
---
That's the issue. Everything people complain about in the games isn't the Killers' or Survivors' fault nearly as often as it is the devs. Looping is optimal because the movement is so limited. Slugging is optimal because of the hatch. Tunnelling is often a good idea because there's no reward for chasing a fresh person.
---
Camping is still dumb and that's the player's fault; git gud.
---
Well not my fault she has 0 counters
---
I wish ruin was not a necessity, it’s so boring to go against
---
Use No Mither then.
---
I love the idea that when they finally penalize DCs, they'll just add another way to ragequit.
---
I always do daily challenges so i find out who im playing that day.  daily to catch survivors in bear traps , guess im playing trapper.  Daily to fix three gens. Guess im playing fing mei. Daily to escape as meg, guess im trashing it.
---
cool af. Putting the ART in fanart eh?
---
I have a lot of fun with him, constantly zooming around the map, using his undetectable status to surprise people.  
---
If they pop my portal? Great, i now have a free one to pop somewhere.
---
Demogorgon joins the legion
---
I don’t mind it anymore, simple fix actually. Soon as game starts, I see a spirit, dc move to on next game :) it will take the killer way longer to find a game than it’ll take me to find one so don’t really complain about spirit anymore :)
---
Yeah he’s not great, he’s a worse hillbilly.
---
People are calling bs on TrU3Ta1ent build cuz he has no terror radius and red stain stealth and he can still m1
---
Omg I would've been so salty
---
Demo is actually quite good. He isn´t top tier, but he is definitely among the better killers. It takes a while to get used to him. STBFL is absolutely crucial on him. Don´t think too hard about Portals, just place them near gens or hooks and you will naturally create a good network. Be VERY aggressive and pressure them around the map, scan for portals often and whenever you see one getting cleansed port there (always keep at least one portal ready so you can port from anywhere). Add-ons that make portals harder to cleanse and increase your movement speed are great. 
---
Shred is kind of like Blink in the sense that you need to play with it for some time. It can be weird at first, and you can totally suck with it, but if you master it you can easily shutdown some longer loops. Plus it destroys pallets which is a huge plus as well. I don´t feel like the lunge is inconsistent, after playing with it for some time I got used to it and am pretty consistent with it. 
---
You need the right balance of setting portals and chasing, and that is hard to achieve.
---
because not everyone has a pc. or if they do have a pc they, its not that great
---
I like how the Entity is driving the car
---
I don’t like the trapper. And I am rank 20
---
Spirit takes that option away entirely.
---
This reminded me of one match where I was running a chest farming build and went into the basement just for a Freddy to come down when I opened the chest. I took the toolbox out of the chest and put it down in front of him before crouch walking out of the basement. And he just let me which was amusing.
---
She is literally a grown woman
---
Matches like those SUCK. It sounds like you have a good idea of what everything means but are drowning in overwhelming information and getting left behind.
---
Honestly, what helps me is forgetting about a total win and going in with a Killer you like and just focusing on one piece at a time. Build small skills; win one chase, get one hook. Use your special power once. As you practice, you'll start integrating all those small lessons and start getting as devastating as the Killers you go against.
---
Anyway I'm sorry to hear you had a shitty soulbreaking game but hey, we've all been there! And it'll be worth it because I promise one day you'll go in relaxed and absolutely slaughter them, and those games are super worth it
---
The only thing that I want is to stop getting only Killer challenges when I play mostly survivor.
---
The locker idea was what i had for ghostface before he was released. Nice.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dtzw05/is_there_a_reason_killers_are_all_disconnecting/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Of the starter Survivors, Dwight is one of the best to use first because Bond lets you see what nearby players are doing and Prove Thyself gets you a little more Bloodpoints, the currency most things require. Every Survivor's perk can become available to others with enough time and BP, as they are unlocked for others at levels 30, 35, and 40 and must then be found on everyone else's Bloodweb.
---
If you decide you like being altruistic, Claudette and David are great choices to move to. Claudette has Botany Knowledge, which speeds healing, and Empathy, which is like a much larger Bond, but only sees injured allies. Self-Care is a trap, in that it wastes your time.
---
David has We're Gonna Live Forever. It does nothing in-game, but can increase your Bloodpoints for a game by up to 100% for taking hits for teammates or safely unhooking them. His Dead Hard is also meta, as it allows you to do a dash/dodge during which you are invulnerable (but intangible to attacks, as well).
---
The piles of bones are totems. They're usually inconsequential, but if generator skill checks appear red, Hex: Ruin is on the map. Totem spawns are semi-random, and you might want a perk like Small Game to help you learn them for each map. You CAN work through Ruin, but it's difficult for newer players. In general, lit totems (those a Hex is tied to) are good to destroy, but there's one Killer perk that makes trap ones (Hex: Haunted Ground).
---
Looping is the #1 Survivor skill to learn. When being chased, you want to find a spot with a pallet and circle it, forcing the Killer to chase you to get within striking distance, then drop the pallet to separate yourself from them before they can hit you and run to the next. You can do similar things with windows, especially high-up ones.
---
To learn more about Killer, I can recommend the Youtube channel "Not Otzdarva", but he doesn't play Survivor as much or as skillfully.
---
It depends what level of skill you’re at tbh. I enjoy facing Spirit because of the fact that you need to mind game as best as possible. But to say it isn’t possible is absolute nonsense.
---
Actually quite the opposite freddy and gf have immunity against OoO since the last patch
---
Nothing changes the fact that you got so mad and salty at a video game that you came on here to swear and whine and complain and announce that you’re deleting your account.
---
By snowflake. No one will miss you.
---
More survivors just running to the hook anyway even though you're firmly up their rectum in invis
---
I've been playing Legion a lot recently, and man, toxic fengs and nears are literally the most frustrating thing-- they all play this way? Lol. I love the D/C at the end because they can't accept that they went and played that horribly.
---
Ok thanks for the reply.

I made it into a survivor match, just checked the options and crossplay is turned on so it can't be that. Trying queuing for killer again but no luck so far.

As an update, we had a lovely visit, while my Dad kept her company I fixed up her house, repaired her kitchen sink, fixed a hole in her kitchen floor, and cleaned her whole house. It seems my 2 relatives that live near her haven't been caring for her home. 
---
  I enjoyed it a lot, and showed her females can fix plumbing and use power tools!
---
.... And why do they resort to playing Spirit? Because she's easy and strong
---
She’s strong not easy
---
It still takes skill to master to master her
---
&gt; a shitty soulbreaking game

---

---
Wraith's old windstorm addons became base a while ago, plus he already does get a speed boost while invis.
---
Spirit next please! Such good! Much adoration!
---
She's VERY easy. You dont need skill, just a headset. No need to mindgame survivors, just stand still and react to what they do.
---
You *probably* still can with bamboozle, Franklins, sloppy butcher, and enduring
---
It’s been like half a year and people are still bringing up old legion. Fucking amazing. How is that even relevant? Who said otherwise?
---
It’s hard to see with that cloth over your head.
---
It makes me sad that Killers don't get to keep items like that. It'd encourage more Survivor play if you could accrue items as Killer.
---
Depending on the mechanics, it could also encourage Franklin's Demise.
---
I agree. I’d rather play against noed than ruin cause ruin just feels like a drag. But at this point ruin is in every game and it kinda just feels like it’s a standard part of the game.  I’m more surprised when there isn’t ruin.
---
Yeah, dude, sure. Chainsaws, hatchets, traps and stuff are kinda op. Killers shouldn't be able to use m2 this game, it's too much. Kappa
---
Yeah but what if you finish it? for example, I finished Tome I and im at Tier 14/70, so this would help :)
---
I use a macro for this reason lmao.
---
The devs also consider survivors quitting out as a kill for their stats(not kidding). It's one of the reasons they claimed Freddy was in a good state for so long, because he had so many more survivors DC against him.
---
Also, it'd be great if the devs would release stats often(last was what, a year ago?) with clear divides between ranks. Low rank survivors are a whole different world from high ranks.
---
Holy shit yes please I’ve spent 40 hours just getting the spirt  outfit
---
I thought I made it pretty obvious
---
I most of the time suicide in games where the team mates aren't doing anything useful. They are instead crouchwalking on the other side of the map, doing dull totems and there's no chance we're gonna escape cause you'll alone have to do 3-4 gens and also do saves and looping.
---
Then play the game? Adding more ways to progress faster and faster would really make it lose value for players that frequently play. What do the more dedicated players get out of it?
---
Iron will
---
This. Activating his power on some maps practically turns the game into a slideshow.
---
well, with blendettes you can at least get lucky and find one and then find others, but 4 neon neas...
---
Does anybody know who this artist is? This is really pretty fanart
---
Cmon were all big boys now, we can hit our Ruin skill checks
---
I just gonna say that she would be hairy as shit
---
I'd say it's a pretty nice counter to a perk that's broken if it's against a non-detectable killer.
---
Or just work through it.
---
Ok Boomer
---
That moment when the guy you chase runs across half the map to unhook..those idiots
---
oh.. that's dumb LMAO i started playing 2 months ago so
---
I've seen countless games against her thrown by cleanses where the game is ended by her corrupt.  She is so much easier to play without cleansing man.  Just rush the gens and loop her for a bit during.  The only players that think cleansing is a good strat aginst her are the ones that don't know how to handle themselves in a chase.  Learn to loop and you'll prefer the No Mither status to the Roided out Huntress she becomes when you guys feed her.
---
The devs consider a survivor disconnecting to be kills you know, and whether I play killer or survivor, I still see DCs happen all the time.
---
She's been DCd and complained about a lot since her release, it's not a recent thing.
---
Before Nurse's change people complained about Spirit more than Nurse.
---
What a world, where we can penalize people who dodge lobbies as a killer when the game hasn't even started but we can't penalize survivors who disconnect :)
---
Don't be an obnoxious coward when you see 3 toolboxes, guys, this guy might get offended by it. Just accept your lack of fun in the match.
---
You can already see the killer with Empathy. The 3rd is Windows of Oppurtunity, lets you see vaults and pallets, so you dont run into  gym only to see the pallet has already been used. Also lets gives you insight on what would be an optimal loop. With WoP you can create a whole racing circuit grand prix if things go your way
---
This works for Survivor mains and just prestiged killers
---
That's a counter to every killer
---
Course
---
It'd be fine if killer queues weren't 15-30 minutes per game.
---
I cant see why

Hey, if people sexualize some of the shitty doodles on dbdgw theyll love your actually good art even with clothes on
---
Add penalty to DCs first then we can talk about whether choosing to not play with someone before the match begin should be punished. Also the reason survivor queues are long is because the game is so imbalanced that people are willing to play survivors so much more that they would sit and wait 10min rather than get an insta game as killer.
---
Sultry clown next
---
Ok boomer
---
Now you have felt our pain. XD
---
As a killer, I can tell you it looks pretty much the same. You swing as the pallet goes down and just get lucky, 9/10 you get stunned instead and the survivor isn't hit.

---
Survivor: Alexander James

Killer abilities-
---
1. Parole: if The Executioner sees any survivors, he gets a speed increase of 15% For 10 seconds while the survivors are in an exposed state for 5 seconds 
---
2. Pallet Town: he gets to destroy pallets faster then any other killers. 
---
3. Hide and seek: The Executioner can see any survivor which are hidden in the closets. 
---
Survivor perks-
---
1. Blood sacrifice: if the survivor gets killed, the killer’s aura gets exposed for 10 seconds. 
---
Hunted: if the survivor is in an exposed state, pallets have a 50% chance of stunning the killer for 5 seconds longer. 
---
Mori: Death Sentence: The Executioner slams the survivor’s head on the ground 5 times then decapitate the survivor.
---
Bio: Vince Van Killmore was the executioner for the castle until he killed every occupants in the castle in a fit of rage. He now patrols get castle looking for new victims to slaughter.
---
Rank 10’s complaining about killers, I’m not going to waste my time further. Have a good evening.
---
The problem is the devs don't even see a problem with this because they can't relate at all to the problems of red ranks, or they simply cannot balance the game around all ranks. As this is a casual game they seem to only be interested in making red ranks problems a bit easier while balancing around outside of those ranks. That itself doesn't make a lot of sense when nerfing the killers that can handle them generall
---
If you make all the killers that are really only equipped to handle really good red ranks/SWF (which, these days due to the MM changes, red rank killers generally go against SWF) do not be surprised killers go out of there way to make sure they never enter red ranks.
---
Me, I don't play this game anymore because I've just grown sick of a lot of things after 3 years, so what they choose to do is irrelevant to me.
---
This is groovy
---
Same reason people buy skins and cosmetics in first person shooters.  To know others see how cool you look, or just to support the game.  And to be fair I'm a low rank killer so I get to stare at myself in lobby for about 10 minutes before I actually get to play everytime.
---
Don't delete...
---
People shouldn't accuse other people of being thieves - especially when an idea like this seems obvious and would make so much sense. I was honestly thinking the same idea the other day.
---
I still think BHVR's plan was to knock Nurse down a peg overall, I mean if you threw on the right perks and her best add-ons you could literally wipe the survivors within like 2 minutes a lot of the time, these changes made it so not anybody could do it with minimal amounts of practice.
---
As far as Freddy goes, I personally just think he was overtuned in the fact that they just gave him a bunch of abilities and said there now he can't be bad, He literally makes Clown obsolete with just a portion of his kit and then has utility in so many other places. While I wouldn't call it OP, I just wonder why he needed all these mechanics.

I agree 100% with this. I find its the survivors who are toxic and bullying low tier killers or killers trying out something fun or new, that are the ones that complain about only facing nurses and spirits at high ranks. Like of course...you're just proving the point that other killers don't stand a chance so of course you're only going to end up facing top tier killers.
---
Sorry for the small rant &gt;.&lt;
---
YES, THANK YOU! I was so worried you gave up, come on show us all how much of an absolute degenerate piece of shit you are bud, it fuels me to see that I can anger you so much that you feel the need to call me a snowflake and attempt to deconstruct anything I say. I love it, it just shows me how powerless you really are, fuel my sate for your idiocy, degen!
---
Hatchets are the exception I mentioned, Bear traps are fine. 
---
Is this? A new player?
---
Weren't these part of a charity dlc thing where they added a bunch of youtubers and streamer cosmetics?
---
Survivors should get them too if they d/c? I didn't say they shouldn't. Killers dodging lobbies is a much bigger issue than survs dodging killer lobbies. Besides, like, I said, dodging 1 or 2 shouldn't get a penalty because that would be too much. 
---
Maybe instead of crying about toolboxes, people should improve their gameplay? I know it's terrible to suggest people try and improve, but if more than like 5-10% (at most) of this game's population could play it, it would be a much better experience overall.
---
I think dc should be penalized too. I think this is a popular opinion though, which is why I opened with an unpopular one.
---
are you playing with boxing gloves ?

Never broke up any controllers nor keyboards and I play a lot of mashing games.

This game needs a lot of work so both sides are happy then we can call it a horror again and it will be more scary than annoying .-.

She's also getting a nerf in one way or another, as they've already said. Probably in about 5 months to a year, if we go off how slowly they balance just about anything in this game :)

No matter how you try to paint things, no matter how you try to convince yourself that everyone around you is wrong, you're still the one that came on here to cry and complain because you got so mad and salty at a video game. If you don't want to be called out for crying in public, don't cry in public.

---
Your pretty much spot on the other killers aren't viable at high ranks they don't have enough mobility options and no map pressure which is essential at high ranks.
---
I have a an idea to help Ghostface and give him a warp ability but I don't know how the others could be helped.
---
I'm pretty sure this is a repost
---
PS4 version is a bug
---
Safety pip or depip?
---
I did it and it worked fine. Maybe it’s because of the address you’re writing, there are many guides on YouTube on how to do it. It’s quite bad anyways
---
To me wraith isn’t that bad all you need is the right add ons
---
She is and they have already said that she is next to getting nerfed.
---
It's also not fun having to cut your chases in half just in case you are the second-to-last survivor remaining.
---
#BUFFTHETEENS
---
Hag, Demogorgon, Freddy and reworked Nurse can be deadly if played well. Spirit is just too easy: stand still, hit, phase, hit again because the survivor without Iron Will cannot do anything to counter you. Use Stridor and it is worse.
---
No one should be forced to use perks to counter killers and bad mechanics.
---
New Nurse is still the strongest killer.
---
Learn to play.
---
They don‘t need a buff, they need a huge overhaul. It‘s the dumbest base kit of any of the killers.
---
huh. I recently downed a bill moments after the fifth gen popped but noed was gone by the time I’d picked him up.
---
Trapper? Just let him have all his traps at the begging of the match, after placing all his traps, let him only carry 2 at a time.
---
There is a video on YouTube about this
---
This actually doesn't seem like a bad idea

it's literally just you buddy. you're the only one here that's got a problem.
---
I am probably alone in this, but I REALLY don't want Pennywise in DBD. I love the classic licensed killers and Demigorgon is OK, but I am not liking the idea of Pennywise.
---
Yeah it’s just par for the course. I can’t even get upset anymore. It’s expected
---
This is dumb
---
because I had only one ring add-on and I didn't care about opening the hatch, I wanted to not lose the ring add-on. In normal matches, I can take the gate. If I don't, I'll die. Unless I use the ward, I can't protect the key from both AND have the ring, so I protected it from death and took one that can't even open the hatch, cuz I don't want to
---
Lol what, it's always the killer queues are always long
---
I also just started playing and I am not able to find a game as killer. Waited 45minutes and still no lobby. I'm also on PC and rank 20, because I couldn't find a game yet. 
---
But survivor queues are about 2minutes for me.
---
Im not a fan of freddy just being a mashup of other killers personally.
---
You are arguing against something that doesn't exist here mate, literally no one is saying killers should get lobby dodge penalties while survivors can dodge to their hearts content.
---
But go off I guess mate
---
Can't the stealth killer see the survivors whenever it is active though?
---
Seems like it's more detrimental to the survivor than the stealth killer as the perk basically becomes a buffed premonition.
---
Its downloading :3
---
Also when you hear the killer coming you try to be stealthy but as soon as you let go of the gen a skill check pops up and you miss it cause bad timing
---
...How on earth did you arrive at that conclusion? I'd say your logic is flawed. The number of possible outcomes does not determine probability. That's like saying your chances of winning the lottery are 50/50: You either win, or you don't.
---
Sir it’s no nut november
---
The meters can be reduced to 2/5/8 the perk is meant to prevent survivors from being able to hide near the generator when the killer is there.
---
So many salty survivor mains in my mentions because they can’t loop a spirit 😂😂
---
Very hot 
---
Would smash
---
Not sure why people do that. It's so dumb. Just went against a spirit today and ran her around for like 2-3 gens before ultimately going down due to a nice play from her. She isn't bad to go against at all, annoying maybe but that's it
---
I want ALL the characters to be dressed in ugly sweaters and join Adams fine fashion choice
---
Great OC
---
1 second cool down to her power and some visual indication she is trying to phase and that's all the spirit need. If she even needs that much
---
This reminds me, H20 announced on his Twitter years ago that he was gonna giveaway codes on his Twitter, he was gonna post a tweet with a lot of codes.
---
I say there all day refreshing his Twitter, and he never did it
---
Also they dont work ( for me at least), first they were bugged so you dont play them with the splinter equipped but you could played them after that for however long you'd like if you dont swich to a different killer and know when I wanted to use one I cant play as those killers at all.
---
Try Franklins, bamboozle, sloppy butcher, thanatophobia. I don't have Legion but I know Franklins works with the frenzy
---
Sorry I don't live on these forums
---
Yeah, my point is simply that it’s not a choice
---
Give him the Freddy rework with multiple abilities
---
Something like being able to summon a fellow member of the legion that movies forward for 3 seconds then leave by the power of the entity
---
During those 3 seconds the player can take control of the other legion member and the original walks for an additional half second then disappears by the power of the entity
---
After the power is used the play will have continued control of the new member on the field
---
*Legion members who appear can only wear cosmetics owned*
---
Lol, screenshot you being above rank 10 please. I can tell you're a scrub just from a few sentences
---
"lorewise" ...I think getting carpal-tunnel syndrome IRL trumps "lorewise".
---
Me running ruin as killer - totem ded in less than 1 min. and 3 gens done in less than 3 mins.
---
Encountering ruin as survivor - ruin brings the game to a screeching halt because all of my team mates refuse to touch a gen while it's up, and get themselves killed looking for it.
---
I'll keep my eye out for ruin as i move about, but seriously ppl, just power thru it....the gen isn't going to bite you just because ruin is up.
---
- Responds to person.
---
- Insults that person for responding.
---
You're literally still the one responding to *me*...  Isn't that odd...
---
It is literally a disease.
---
Cowboys can’t be sexy-
---
I bet you feel dumb right now.
---
Dunno xD
---
Save me :(
---
I thought OoO didn't work on stealth killers because of the undetectable status effect
---
Oh jeez yeah. Or they get salty when you don’t dive bomb the hook/killer for them at the end. I had a guy who completely farmed/screwed me over by leading the killer to me who had the audacity to tell me after the game I should’ve taken a hit for him when it was just the two of us left and the killer had him in his sights. Ridiculous
---
 First and foremost - no. Survivor should look at the killer in order for them both to see each other. Stealth killers hide their auras now, but survivor still gets his perk  lighted up, thus survivor knows that he is looking at the killer.
---
 And second - stealh killer is supposed to sneak up. Stealth killer can't teleport, doesn't have any tonic bottles or hatchets, doesn't have a chainsaw at his disposal. Being stealthy - is all he got. So it really hurts when this only ability is taken away by some crutch perk.
---
It is. I play both sides and i find its pretty easy to play against and unreliable to use. Pop is better in my opinion. People running ruin has just forced me to get better at great checks.
---
:(
---
I say it's tedious and adds nothing of value to the game, and at worse afflicts people with carpal-tunnel... And your response is "lol video games shouldn't be fun, they need to have annoying things that serve no good purpose?" I can't be understanding you properly lol...
---
Dead hard is so easy to bait tho. I personally don't see a huge problem with it
---
Chase perks and Unrelenting imo
---
It makes it slower, slow down perks are boring to go against. But slowdown perks need to exist because of how fast gen repairs are compared to the lethality of the killer. Instead of having slowdown perks and making gens repair slower, they just need to buff the lethality of killer and buff specific killers. Killer earns you more bloodpoints and is more fun at the moment because how much more engaging it is rather than sitting on a generator.
---
This, red ranks don't cleanse, after early game is over her power is just keeping everyone injured, that's literally it. I mean its not super weak and has synergy, but she is incredibly prone to gen rush because she has no slowdown from survivor healing.
---
Shes pubstomp because low rank survivors actually cleanse, and when they do, gg
---
Lobby dodge if you see more than 2 toolboxes.
---
Ikr? They miss a skill check and urban evasion around the map for 12 minutes looking for the totem lol
---
I Love you, you juste explain my though better than i could ever, i must add that survivor are generaly l'ESS skilled than killer, simply because in a game they need to do less

Let's reserve shapeshifting for The Thing.
---
Hum
---
I slug for the sole reason that it is harder to abuse reviving a survivor, while it seems that everyone now hook baits killers (or however it is called) and I ain't dancing this dance. Plus, sometimes you gotta slug the survivor to catch the last one left while they are still in your line of sight.
---
That's what I'm saying. If they nerfed his move speed I think it would encourage learning to curve which may be harder but imo is far more fun and rewarding.
---
I’m playing on PS4 and finding a game is usually pretty quick. Some days can be frustrating as you’re waiting what feels like ten minutes for a game but generally that’s not too common.
---
Same. I have to mori someone as Hag, but I fucking hate the Hag
---
Ironic you call the 3 inside maps outside the box
---
You dont often find max potential survivors but I know like 6, 4 man swf who are just god like their easily my favorite to face against and make the best stream footage.
---
Till November 13.
---
I just wish people would actually ask "Why are so many people DCing"
---
Instead of just going to the childish mindset of "ThEy NeEd 2 jUsT gEt GuD!"
---
It's all about having fun. If there is no counter play (real and perceived) then people will opt out. Once people understand the ranking system is bunk they will most likely DC over anything they consider unfair. It's why red ranks DC the most.
---
&gt;Look its a [insert easy killer] Oh They are using [insert meta] Perks and a mori, Im out.
---
I dont have it but I was thinking of playing plague so maybe I will
---
I've seen you on so many subs, now you're on the DbD one?
---
I'm going crazy.
---
I've had this happen to me before, though it happened to me when they D/C'd right as EGC would have gotten them. Was not very fun. :(
---
You know it's bad when you get praised in post-game chat for not having Ruin.
---
Kaka Krabby Patty!
---
I get about 1 survivor challenge for every killer one, and when I do it‘s never ever for my main
---
You gotta force players to do something they don't want to. Most red rank survivors get tunnel vision when it comes to nearly completing a gen. They always go back to the same one when interrupted. 
---
You just have to snowball it from there.
---
True and that’s what sets them apart from other killers. They don’t look different from normal survivors, except for the masks and knives. That’s probably why I’m not so crazy about it.. ahaha
---
This or an astronaut themed killer always interested me I like the way the suits look and the potential for skins are very cool
---
You’re  gonna be shitposting for a while
---
I mean that you gotta have this hard part to add connection to your character, the main purpose of a game is to be fun for sure but you gotta have some weird part in it to create some type of bond
---
If they nerfed his movement speed he would be one of the worst killers in the game.
---
Lol for me I have the abused mentality reaction. Whenever I get a game with no ruin my thoughts immediately go to what is the worst thing that could happen? I jump from, he's got devour hope, he's got NOED, he's got insta downs, etc. Maybe its because im at red ranks so I am not used to things going well for me in survivor games.
---
I agree, but it just doesn’t feel legion enough for me. Killers are supposed to be scary imo. And a lot of the silly cutesy cosmetics takes away from that.
---
I mean it goes under communication abuse because of how much they spammed it, it's one of the categories of it. I told them after their trigger happy spam of it that they could call me out on my light tunnelling(it wasn't a great game for me) but spamming everyone's chat so rapidly was my issue because they were trying to get a rise out of me. I wouldn't have reported them if it was once but spamming the chat so that it was the only thing in it? That's the line.
---
Although I prefer to cleanse I won’t if the rest of the team doesn’t either because that would put them all in danger. 
---
I cleanse when:
---
1. She has corrupt. 
---
2. Others have cleansed. 
---
3. I’m on death hook. (then I just have to hope others cleanse as well)
---
I do not cleanse when:
---
1. No one else has. 
---
2. I’m in a position to unhook a sick teammate.
---
3. If I’m running Resilience.
---
I just downvoted you just cause everyone else is doing it

Hasn't come out yet. Think it comes out this week.
---
It's a timed thing.
---
Does
---
and why do you even care?
---
Lol so much fun
---
this.
---
over time i got used to lure survivors into a 3gen final, and from that point i usually get 3 or 4 kills. just stop chasing that one nea for ages and defend those stupid Gens.
---
Less time being forced to play for it, while you still have the option to play normally if you so choose
---
At the end of post like this you need to kind of throw out that hillbilly is broken too and needs a Nerf otherwise they will say you're just picking on the top killer every single time
---
I know
---
I support you brother
---
I only do this when the surv is about to struggle on first hook.
---
I'd let her give me an iridecent head. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
PC and switch mortal kombat players both suffer from late updates and a bunch of other shit, wdym?
---
if gen speed wasn't so fucking fast it wouldn't be needed as much. Its no fault of the survivors, I don't think like "YOUR DOING YOUR OBJECTIVE TO FAST REEE" the blame is on the game itself. 80 seconds for no perks/toolbox with a single survivor who hits 0 great skill checks. even in this scenario, if you have someone on a gen at all times, with no overlap (again, not realistic) it would be 400 seconds..6 minutes and 40 seconds for this statistic. Of course, normally a game will have times where no one is on a gen, or multiple people ar eon gens/ working on gens at the same time, spice in toolboxes and perks, blah blah blah.  
---
let's do some thought experiments, which again are in a vacuum, not realistic, but as close as we can get with the 20 minutes before I leave for my friends 18th birthday (going to see joker, we live in a society), so we are not taking into account perks/tools/addons that make these situations. we are also saying, in this case, no one gets left on hook for a full stage (3 hooks to kill)  
---
lets say the survivors are bumble fucks at gens, and the total time of the game is 10 minutes. to 4k, a killers main goal, that means that 12 hooks in 10 minutes, thats 1 hook every 50 seconds  (49.8 exactly).   
---
On the other side, we have pro game g-fuel IV drip gamer SWF who can run a game in 3 minutes (this can be a game length, ive had 3 minute games). To 4k in 3 minutes the killer must hook a survivor every 15 seconds.   
---
Finally, what about that perfect statistic spot, 6 minutes and 40 seconds for all gens. that is 1 hook every 33 seconds. your chase time plus time of animations, plus time of getting to hook with a wiggling survivor..has to be 33 seconds to match the gen speed.  
---
What this boils down to is that especially as the survivors get better, they control the pace of the game. the killer, who is supposed to be the power role in the asymmetry, has to match the survivor's pace, not the other way around. Now as I said before, these times are in a vacuum, so they are not perfect, but I think they show that in this game gen time is an issue.  
---
Now then, I would write more but I need to go now, my friend's house calls to me!
---
Oh, I get it. I thought It would come out every week a New Level. Thanks
---
I wish there were more close games
---
Yes nerf every killer so survivors will quit crying. Then you can cry when you get face camped every game and lobbies take forever because killer is unfun to play.
---
Normally I would say no to a shape-shifting killer, but legions trailer makes them look exactly like they could shape-shift, so I would be fine with it
---
I'm rank 3 survivor and rank 6 killer, and spirit doesn't need a nerf. You are a whiny baby.
---
[Beetlejuice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bojp4Q1vvRg)
---
My idea for a solution to this is have the recover action also act as a "slow bleed-out" funciton. As long you're holding m1, your bleed-out bar goes down normally, but when released, the bar goes down twice as fast, or some other amount.
---
Literally what is the point of the end game collapse when survivors can completely circumvent it with doing this anyways, I heard when it first came out that people said stuff like "oh it's to keep survivors from holding the game hostage"
---
??? You can still hold the game hostage. As survivor and killer.
---
In my opinion gate progress should regress if you leave it before fully opening it.
---
I still think Plague has that huge absurd flaw of her power being literally too impactful and demanding on the Survivors at the same time.
---
As in, when smart Survivors prefer to not use the well at all and stay injured, you will not be able to use Corrupt Purge at all, if you don't use apples.
---
Which is the very reason why the apples are the most popular Add-Ons besides of charge speed.
---
I'm not fond of a that huge part of a Killers abillity not seeing any up time simply because it is tied to either using a Add-On or on the choice of the Survivors.
---
The worst thing is, I get it tho. Corrupt Purge is absurdely powerful, almost similar to a faster Huntress with auto-aim as she can down anyone who's within the range and LoS.
---
So the Corrupt Purge itself needs some kind of overhaul if we don't want to remove the gimmick of her wells.
---
Because generally, survivors don't cleanse until 1 or 2 gens left. They're always injured, and if they do cleanse, and you can get to the well, you're a puking huntress.
---
Best part is you pop the gen they were trying to get while you hooked someone. They take that chance to unhook and do it all over. And you regress faster than they can progress. Hardest part is lureing the 3 gen to happen but sometimes they just do it to themselves.
---
Comes out the 13th apparently. No problem my dude see you in the fog :)
---
Ruin with thrill I use that build on console and pc and it works great
---
It used to grant a token no matter it was a safe rescue or not.
---
We already have The Clown and Pennywise looks horrible tbh, I don't even know what his power would be
---
That h20 mask is so dope
---
I am a spirit on console who destroys every game 
---
Perks don’t really matter (except ruin or corrupt intervention ) 
---
You really just have to listen closely for survivor breathing, footsteps and injured noises while phasing 
---
If u can’t hear those clearly ( for whatever reason) you shouldn’t play spirit 
---
Just get a good headset lmao or just do your best to predict survivor movement 
---
Prediction works half the time 
---
Best of luck
---
She is absolutely devoted to the entity which she sees as her god due to her unintentionally  or maybe intentionally summoning it in her lore.
---
Also the entity doesn't care what you want, it will torture people like the wraith until they kill.
---
She is the hardest killer to loop however that doesn’t mean she’s overpowered it just means you have to try hard
---
Change Huntress Mori to her putting you in a headlock with her thighs and popping your head like a melon.
---
I get DCed against all the time.
---
Do you stream? I wish I could see your gameplay
---
Beautiful art! I’ve a grave dislike of the Huntress, but you depict her so well in this.
---
🧂
---
Bad eyesighr. Can relate. Sometimes i even run into the killer w/o realizing
---
tapp*
---
Same goes for survivor. I've played 5 games today as killer and survivor and have dcs 4 out of 5 games. One because we played against doctor, one because we played against spirit, one because I played as billy, and one that might have just been a crash because there was really no reason to dc.
---
I get where you come from.  I personally don't mind being stylish and cute.  I'm more likely to buy cute cosmetics than scary ones, and so they're smart to gear towards the other side as well instead of only the scary side.
---
I use Pop, Ruin, Thrill and BBQ. Very good winrate with her.
---
I'm pretty sure they're aware that legion is in a bad state hes just low priority rn
---
I don’t sadly but I am also rank 7 so take my opinion with a grain of salt
---
That's literally the entire point of the joke.
---
\*Actual sounds from me running to my fridge\*
---
Only if you know a hook is near
---
She is mentally a child by canon, idk what are you trying to do here...
---
I just think Legion main should be banned from the game honestly. The killer will never be fun to go against unless their power is torn down and completely rebuilt from the ground up. I used to find old Freddy extremely boring to go against. Now he's one of my favorite killers in the game. Legion takes no brain. Especially the ones with sloppy Butcher and thanat. My biggest complaint is that matches will last 20 minutes because they don't go for kills. They just slowly wear everybody down.
---
Personally I play killers that takes skill. Huntress for example. I also play a lot of bad Killers like wraith Leatherface and trapper. Because they take skill to consistently 4K with.
---
I do not for one second believe that you have fun in a match against a Legion with Ruin, Pop, Thanat, Sloppy.
---
Having generators go even slower while constantly getting kicked with pop goes the weasel and dealing with a legion who won't chase you for more than 30 seconds.
---
I play Both Sides equally and people who play like that disgust me. I'd rather go against insta saw hillbilly or iridescent Huntress.
---
Nah nobody NEEDS to play a certain killer to win against a swf because playing ANY killer against a swf is HIGHLY UNLIKELY to win due to the fact that this game was never meant for comms. As killer you have to understand you’re on a 4 minute timer.  There’s so many reasons why it’s broken. A gen takes about a minute and 20 seconds and a chase can take that same amount of time. There goes 3 gens right there. And swf can simply just give the heads up they’re being chased and that the gens are safe to work on. Can also let other survivors know when the killer is not on them anymore or where his location is, COMPLETELY disregarding stealth killers. ( Michael, ghost-face, pig, wraith) Not to mention swf can coordinate taking hits (creating distance for their other teammates) which in turn can make that short window of time killers have to counter four players at once, even shorter. “Lets all use adrenaline/decisive/deadhard/etc” that’s even more toxic, imagine turning every killer’s first hit into a built in insta down and mori. That’s Thats how cancerous it is.
---
I mean, I think it’s fair enough since if OoO is lit up, the undetectable killer can still see the survivors aura, while the survivor can only see the general direction of the killer. Fair trade off in my opinion
---
I'm sorry..demo DOG?!?
---
I'd argue that the button mashing doesn't accomplish that at all, it's tedious, carpal-tunnel syndrome inducing, loud, annoying, encourages suiciding on the hook, lag spikes can kill people... I mean, do I have to keep going? I'd argue this isn't a "weird part", it's a bad part. Bad design.
---
Show som leg
---
Yea I realize that, but that's not always going to work and also they can dead hard past the pallet and miss the prompt (I'm guilty of this). In open field you're done for.
---
Not my main. I'm just mad that BHVR balances the game around no skill players like yourself. Nerf enough killers and the game turns into nobody playing killer. The ones who do play killer will pretty much be forced to facecamp to secure a kill. Seems that's what you guys want tho.
---
Okay, so do that and get back to us with your art
---
For me it will make me slightly hesitate to hook you, then I'll go "hmmm... nah, YEET" then throw you on the hook. I dont have much mercy. Sometimes though, I might.
---
Also I shake my head and hit at the air to make them stop wiggling so I can take them to an event hook, am I a bad person lmao.
---
Ps4? Restart your ps4 or turn internet off and back on
---
As it stands, a good Spirit is unbeatable. She’s easy to pick up, has little-to-no learning curve and most of her counterplay relies on guess-work. 
---
Iron Will, which is one of her few consistent counters is countered itself by Stridor. She may even choose to completely remove her own weakness with something as easy to obtain as a purple add-on. 
---
However, a big reason Spirit is performing so well is because on average 1 to 2 people disconnect against her on their first down in matches. 
---
She simply isn’t fun to play against. While it isn’t luck-based on wether you win a chase, things like physical detection and Stridor shift the tone of a chase completely in her favour.
---
here's a treat good boy
---
I'll tell you a story then
---
I'm currently on rank 10 as survivor cuz I haven't played much this month. I got matched with rank 17s, I played against a scratched mirror myers. I was being chased for 10 minutes (I check the time every time I start and end the match, they chased me since the match started)
---
we ended with 0 gens done. I got downed cuz claudette sandbagged me and died on the first hook while not being camped
---
that's some shitty experience.
---
being camped tho? you chose to say. you could just kill yourself and start the next one. It's not like every match counts, is it? rank doesn't matter past purple unless you want the achievement, so why would you care about one shitty match?
---
Ironic or not, if a word offends you, kill yourself
---
Exactly. God forbid people understand that more than one person can think the same thing
---
That's why I don't work on gens w/ Megs unless I know they aren't  braindead  lol
---
Not
---
I don’t want to screw over my team
---
Some things I’ve learned for the Demogorgon is to use his Shred ability as a mind game as much as you use it for its original intention. Once that mouth opens and your claws come up, survivors tend to flail back and forth to avoid the “incoming” attack, which causes you to gain distance on them. Then you just stop Channeling Abyss and ain’t at them. Hope this helped!
---
Is that why so many posts are so low effort?
---
also, are you sure this vid is recent? killers can't hit you on hook anymore (at least on PC) and I see blood here
---
Turn my internet off and on and it didn't work. I'm going to try turn my PlayStation off and on
---
They should not have nerfed her. Anyone playing as her until rank 1 now just gets completely wrecked. They shouldn’t have nerfed insta heals either. They seem to make decisions on this game based on the top .01% of people that play it.
---
Easiest way: Switch to a different killer.
---
I was decent with him, or so I thought, until I got to better ranks. 
---
Now I am lucky to get 2 sacrifices in one game.
---
No games for you.
---
Alright. Hope it works. It worked for me

1050ti, i5-8300h. No SSD. I did some research and I’m thinking the HDD might be what’s causing the problem. The thing is terribly slow. It’s a 2TB 5400 rpm (I didn’t know shit about computers when I bought this thing, don’t judge me lol). I’ve always had problems with the HDD being slow, I have 500mb internet and my internet can download things faster than my HDD can write it, so I don’t even get the full benefit of the internet I’m paying for. Unfortunately it’s a laptop so upgrading is not really an option. 
---
Another shitty thing is that the price for similar laptops has DRASTICALLY dropped since I bought it a year and a half ago. I paid like $850 for it (it has a 144hz screen which bumped it up in price too, again I was an idiot, almost no game I play can even hit 100fps. I also got 1x16gb RAM which made it more expensive. I cringe thinking about it lol) now similar laptops are selling for like $500-600 NEW, so if I were to sell mine used and use that money towards a new pc, I’d probably only get like $300 for it lol. Feelsbadman.
---
The struggle mechanic is gxay
---
It just makes brown ranks more aids
---
I think your over thinking it bud, this game doesn’t create a “bond” with you to the survivors. Struggle phase is truly annoying and gives an incentive to suicide if you prefer not mashing a button for a full minute
---
I favor Clown over Freddy any day.
---
I find it very hard to play against her even when she is a potato rank killer because image is so hard to predict. Not fun.
---
She looks fab!  Great work
---
Well said
---
Socially, like math and stuff, sure. But no child could pull that shit off with just hatchets against guns.
---
It's a good build and for the people that are saying they wouldn't run haunted they have to think that most survivors think for some reason if it glows it goes no matter what.
---
Everything in this game is a coin flip, it's all guessing games trying to predict what the killer will do based off of past experiences with that killer. Spirit isnt unbeatable, dont be such a victim.
---
Bruh I'm dead
---
I don't wanna
---
It worked ty. Now time to wait 5 minutes for a lobby because matchmaking is trash
---
One thing this made me consider is how cool it would be if some perks received aesthetic changes based in the Killer. So, instead if the Entity blocking generators for Corrupt Intervention or Thrilling Tremors, Kraken tentacles were used instead.

Hello I'd like to report a bug, I survived against a spirit yesterday, in fact all the survivors survived, which reddit says is impossible, can someone tell the devs?
---
*health state
---
Have you gotten to play a round yet? I'm at work and wondering if it's worth downloading.
---
I’m grown enough to know I can choose what no want. If I don’t enjoy playing against spirit, I’m not going to force myself? Nor am I going to be negative and keep complaining about her in detail. I believe she needs an adjustment. Her current state is only fun for a small fraction of players. If I choose to DC that’s my choice, because I don’t want to do something I don’t need to. We’re talking about A video game, where I log on to have fun. I don’t get on thinking “alright, what am I going to do today to make sure everybody has fun even thou I’m not”. It’s not my obligation to make sure everybody has fun. That falls on the developers of the video game. So if I like many dc, don’t blame us. I’m not sorry if it ruins the game because it’s not my fault. Nor is it my obligation.
---
I would not mind having this chase me.
---
I'll give it a try
---
Honestly this has got to be the beat huntress art I've ever seen and no I'm not only thinking about the sex appeal of it.
---
You only got that thanks to the lag though,missed by a mile
---
I use ruin, thanatophobia, sloppy and nurse's and I've been having a lot of success with them
---
Wow what a big brain counter
---
Maybe if you stopped gen rushing every game
---
We wouldn't run ruin
---
Not even that good of a build but is sure to make people salty, is noed necessary when you know half the survivors will dc in the loading screen?
---
BBQ and Nurse's are really good perks for her
---
Blame Dedicated Servers.
---
We've still got three more archive books to go through over the next two months; by the end of it we should be pretty close to maxing the Rift (assuming you play daily, anyway)
---
16.
---
How would i know if it works now you little bitch. I'm not scared to fight any killer lol.
---
&gt; The only thing that I want is to stop getting only Killer challenges when I play mostly survivor.
---
It does that on purpose to encourage you to play the other role.  Killer mains get mostly survivor challenges.
---
Lol yeah. Glad it worked :) and good luck
---
Last time I checked original DLCs are free, with shards and all that
---
Dwight's face kills me.
---
Sloppy Butcher, Nurses Calling, Thanataphobia, and Save the Best for Last are all good options
---
I mean if all that child has ever done is hunt both animals and people yes they could.
---
Epic gamer moment
---
Oh what!? I was under the impression it was one tome per rift. But if we're getting more then that's fabulous
---
Just look up?
---
I would love that addition! I already finished all the challenges a week ago, so this would help with the grind a lot
---
Still hate going against spirit more
---

Yeah, it could be the HDD. If you haven't already, you could try defragmenting it, that could help quite a bit. As well as some other things. Here is an article with some ideas that could help: https://hetmanrecovery.com/recovery_news/what-to-do-when-your-hard-disk-gets-slow.htm

You could also download something called Intel Extreme Tuning Utility and run a benchmark on your CPU, see if it's not throttling (it'll basically tell you in the results if there was thermal throttling).

I always saw it as a quick way to see a survivor was healed. Of course the survivor portrait changing and also glowing for a quick second does a pretty good job of that already, but I suppose the Bleeding event is kind of like training wheels until killers figure that out.

"I hate these spirits, they kill everyone in like 1 minute, I wish the games lasted longer"
---
Freddy: LASTED LONGER YOU SAY?
---
"WAIT NO-"
---
Whose time is the last survivor disrespecting?
---
Forgot that you lot can get burnt by being flashed anywhere. Just pack Franklin's if you see a flashlight
---
I have been playing for the last couple of months now I cant que my main (killer). I waited for 45 min and  nothing. Then I swap to survivor and I get a match in 15 seconds. Is there a bug or something?
---
Bro this is awesome
---
Nah fam we get four tomes per rift.  The tomes themselves are only enough to get half of the rift, iirc, but you're getting rift tokens from normal game experience too so I think by the end of the fourth tome we shouldn't need to grind too much.
---
That's the point of the game silly
---
I don’t play as killer much, is there any real point of doing that though? I thought it just looked funny hahah
---
Kind of the idea as an alternative to Hex: Ruin.
---
She sucks. I've tried again, and again, and again to play her post rework. I never get more than 1 kill and I am frustrated the entire time at how goddamn slow she is. I'm just glad I got her teachables already so I never have to play her again. Playing Nurse is all the fun of cutting yourself.
---
You might be thinking of the hook timer. That lasts 2 minutes from 1st hook to death assuming you don't get saved.
---
PS4 used-to-be huntress main here, filled out your survery, and hope well for your guide.
---
There seems to be a bug in the game. I experience the same issue when jumping into a game.
---
Yep, you still won't get me to do it because I don't want to
---
You get that set up from youtube?
---
You are such a badass, wish I could be like you.
---
Is that her nipple?
---
or... or... hear me out here. when i get burned, don't put me into a bugged state for no reason.
---
Oh yeah I'm not claiming otherwise, just pointing it out.
---
It also helps avoiding leaving 3 gens too close to one another when you are playing with randoms
---
Feels bad :/
---
bhvr will
---
Everyone cried for nurse buff, she doesn't get touched
---
bhvr fucked with her enough to make the crybabies shut the hell up while not actually doing anything to make her worse
---
It was god damn genius
---
you know I don't know much about Bagans himself but Ghost Adventures is pure garbage.
---
and he just has one of those faces you just want to punch for no reason.
---
I'm a rank 16 as well. I've been waiting in this killer lobby for 15 minutes now.
---
Honestly if you are just starting i would say go for claudette and put on self care because you are able to heal yourself when you get away from the killer and go back out if you wanna do that. With self care yes it is slow but you do get the heal without relying on other players to heal you. Some won't they might be busy with gens or running from a killer.
---
But i would recommend playing stealthy and crouching and learning how other people play and the killers play approach  And one perk you want to use is spine chill because if it lights up then the killer is going in your general direction yes it is a starter perk but it does help you learn the sounds and signals of approaching killers. I prefer using the female characters because i find them less bulky and more stealthy. I found balance landing good to start with when running away from killers and If you plan on using some height structures to get away.
---
She looks like chucky
---
Clown fucking sucks
---
u/damnnohtml hey. This dude says he can counter spirit you have a champion.
---
After the current rift ends.
---
People say using a perk doesnt count as a counter to spirit... but if you're reliably only getting spirits, why shouldn't you use iron will
---
To anyone pointing me my mistake in Kate's response: I did that on purpose.
---
Killers arm:
---
 Reach 1000
---
Or when your item is about to run out so you stop using it, and that second you get a skill check so u fail
---
You specifically called it a double exp weekend.
---
For sale?
---
Alright i think i get it, does it uncloack you when you get burnt? I can remember right now, if not it should since the stun is already bad enought to give survivors time to run
---
His perk involves throwing Aaron at the killer.
---
He can teleport to any generator that hasn’t been finished by survivors. When you are looking at the generator you want to go to, there will be a red arrow above it. The generator will spew blood while you’re channeling your power and the survivors will be able to see you emerging from a pool of blood on their end unless you are using a specific add on. His power has a cool down that you can see on the left side as a brown square with a white border around it.
---
Not sure how the devs acknowledging ruin, noed, and face camping would admit all of this. But yeah, this is all true. 
---
But I agree with the devs that they should not add voice chat. It sounds great, teams can coordinate. But unless all 4 people are super forgiving it would be a shitshow. Imagine if someone got face camped and demanded that everyone come to save him, we would have to hear his demonic screech for a whole minute. I would have a colossal fear of messing up skillchecks. Everyone would command others to do the best strata, and it would be hell if 2 people got in an argument.
---
That doesn't actually answer his question at all
---
Also for the OP: "Demogorgon"
---
You very much can, I do it before I leave a hook all the time.
---
Yes! Do this let’s get some new original killers!
---
But ending that survivor’s life then causes the other survivor to find hatch. It’s one of the best ways to ensure a 4K, there are a few perks to counter slugging (which is common in higher ranks)
---
Legion mains should be banned for using a playable character?? Are you ill? You trully are a disgusting person judging on what killer people play.
---
 I love Legion and i have fun going against because i like the fact that this person is playing the same character i love. Behind their screen, they could be super kind souls who have a ton of good friends, yet you are ready to fuck them down just because they enjoy their favorite low tier killer.
---
I saw many people that hate Legion in the past, but no monster like you. You should be ashamed to be the person you are, that same kind of person who's capable to harass people on appearance. Rethink of what you say and leave people alone.
---
We are human beings behind a screen, trying to enjoy a game, because this is what we are supposed to do. We can all have fun without having any assholes sticking around and teaching them how to play/what to play in a game.
---
Know you are a mean and terrible person. I don't wish you a good day.
---
You gotta play new nurse at high ranks. She cant blink that far now, and she cant blink constantly. That means that she is gonna struggle on big maps, corn maps, indoor maps. Almost any map for her kinda sucks now. I feel like you haven't played nurse at all to say that survivors have only a slim chance to escape now
---
So there is a time limit. Thanks for the help.
---
Because I don’t like her
---
Im just glad she has a change coming.
---
the bug is, after you are burned you get stunned, you appear to everyone (plus yourself) as uncloaked, yet you need to uncloak again to be able to attack.
---
Its not wrong :/
---
Toolboxes are the bane of a Killers existence and I honestly don’t know why people don’t talk about how bullshit generator speeds are on average, Which is boosted by a considerable, Moderate or tremendous amount. Seriously. Toolboxes are part of the problem in this game yet no one talks about them.
---
Tunneling is when the killer focuses on one survivor above the others and makes it really hard for them to do anything. The other I’m not sure
---
exactly, I'm gonna have a bad time if I'm forced to play yet I am because of the battlepass system lol
---
Okay to be fair its more a psychological thing that doesnt apply to everyone
---
Daring today arent we op
---
I don’t like being 1 hit, cleanse plz
---
I don’t think this community is for finding swf...?
---
People didn’t like nurse but didn’t dc half as much as they do against spirit
---
That's not what they said
---
No you didn't

* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam. 
---
It’s because you shouldn’t have to run perks to counter 1 of the 17 killers in the game. 
---
I DON’T play survivor (and still love playing Spirit) but I can understand it being annoying.
---
Honestly, I'm not really sure why anyone complains about this game. It is such a crap shoot of what you are going to run into with so many variables out of your control.  For the most part, taking things like ebony Mori's out of the equation that eliminate entire sequences of hooking, the game is more or less a complete and true game of luck and chance. 
---
You don't know who the killer will be, you don't know what there build will be. 
---
You don't know what perks the survivors are running, you don't know how well they will play together. 
---
The game, by nature is relatively well balanced based solely on those mysteries alone.
---
Yeah I copy and pasted it from another community
---
because I shouldn't have to use a perk to play the game, I should be able to use whatever I want tbfh. deleting the post though because one user thinks he owns the internet
---
I think doubleback is when you run from the killer and go one direction, and when they lose line of sight for a bit you go back over your own scratch marks.
---
What do they call this type of emerald/crystal art. ???
---
Yeah but remember the entire De-Ranking Controversy back in January. Lol even a Fog Whisperer and her pathetic Friends did it and then proceeded to bully low rank killers
---
Im guessing no safety pip. :(
---
Please use the shift key, it allows you to make something called a paragraph making reading long statements easier and allowing you to split lore from idea
---
&gt; I'm not some scrub either I'm red ranked every season.
---
I think every real red rank player knows that these aren't mutually exclusive.
---
Is it a legitimate strategy for me to kick you in the nuts while you're playing? You can piss off someone to get them off their game, but it's not exactly FUN or a cool thing to do, you're just ruining their game. It's sort of unsportsmanlike
---
Doge By Daylight
---
I’d say David or Bill
---
When spirit is one of the most seen killer in the game that’s kinda more then enough reason to do so
---
He was letting you go chief
---
Robot killer based off of soma
---
Helps to find something to do during the queue. I just read
---
I second this
---
david for dh and wglf, then nea for balanced landing
---
I don't like spirit because she could be across the map, and then suddenly appear beside you. With nurse, you could at least tell where she's teleporting. Spirit requires very little mindgaming because in a loop, if she stands still, she is either faking spirit walking, or actually doing it, and in both cases she wins
---
LMAOOOO
---
Sorry that I like playing games that last more than 2 minutes.
---
Aww man i'd hate to be in that position in the middle of a chase, confusion would cost you precious seconds, Behaviour needs to know
---
Bingo, that’s the point that they’re making. She’s in games way too often because she’s too good of a killer.
---
According to her lore, it’s not that she’s mentally like a 6 year old, and is in fact more like she had disregarded her humanity beyond basic survival instinct, and is closer to an animal than anything.
---
Spirit is better and it's easier to beat people as Spirit
---
Lol Tru3ta1ent actually proved Ghostface’s Power with his mean build
---
People feel there’s no counterplay to her. The problem with this is that they try to play against her like they do most killers. If you try to counter Spirit like any regular m1 killer, you’re not going to win.
---
You can counter Spirit by:
---
1.Playing as Spirit. By understanding how she works, you can see what her weaknesses are and exploit them. (And yes, she does have weaknesses) 
---
2. Not waiting by the pallet. Many people do this. Either drop the pallet early or position yourself better.
---
3. Make her guess what you are doing. If you know the Spirit is phasing, try to make her think you are doing one thing and fake it. It’s a 50/50 chance whether or not she gets it right. There’s no universal guide on when or where to do this. It just comes from experience
---
4. Pay attention to her shards. When the Spirit is phasing, her shards light up. If she is standing in a pallet trying to mindgame you, just wait for the cue. If you see them light up, slowly vault it
---
5. Pay attention to when she phases. Spirit has to recover her power. I can’t even begin to tell you how many times Spirits try to mindgame me when I know for a fact their power is recovering.
---
6. Use Spine Chill and/or Iron Will. Both are VERY solid perks and it’s not unreasonable to ask anyone to use them. They counter most killers and give you tons of information.  They don’t just shine on Spirit, they shine on stealth killers and Spine Chill even gives you a vaulting speed boost. 
---
7. If you break LOS with her. Walk. This is critical to losing her. This may sound too obvious, but many people don’t do this. Trust me. It’s common sense but most people freak out and don’t stop running.
---
8. Don’t dc just because you see her or if she downs you. You’re never gonna learn if you keep dc’ing.
---
The only requirement for being good at Spirit is good understanding of the fundamentals of playing Killer, and a decent headset
---
Yeah true.
---
I think you should level up Joe
---
Do hatchets form the huntress take away STBFL stacks?
---
I think the reason splinters dont have perks is to make you wonder what it would be like to play the killer with perks so they will buy the killer and theyll make the money. :D
---
^
---
Lol. Joe mama. Everyone knows that, even Yuri.
---

He didn't hack and he couldn't move or do anything and could just point at things.
---
Flip flop rework: see all the dull totems
---
Imagine me dragon my nuts all over your face.
---
I like the exhaustion one with spreading or faster reload . I have only used a red once and game went to fast
---
nothing to do with that. Scratched mirror myers is exploitable and he was a low-rank. I'm more mad that the others didn't get a single gen done in 10 minutes, which actually got me a bit mad
---
Nice man! So good
---
david's reaction is just relatable.
---
Dodging lobbies isnt the same as dcing and it shouldn't be punished, its like.... an abortion instead of murdering a baby, ok maybe that was a bad analogy.
---
Still, sometimes I want to play a specific build, and if a 4 man swf loads in with items that specifically counter what I'm trying to do, I have two choices
---
1. Switch to a different killer build
---
2. Dodge
---
And with how long I wait in lobbies I want to play with the build I have in mind, I want to play how I want to play! Sometimes I switch but sometimes I just really wanna play sloppy butcher wraith or something but I cant do that when all 4 survivors are using medkits.
---
(Tbh tho its hilarious to switch to plague when all survivors have medkits)
---
I only hate versing her because she takes no skill and her power is simply too good. She is by no means “impossible” to counter. But she just takes no skill to use.
---
Yeah I think it's stupid that you have to basically make DBD your main game to consistently get higher ranks each month.  They need to change it to be seasonal/in line with the Rift imo.  That would fit in much better and ranks wouldn't be so stupidly effing volatile.  
---
Like the only other ranked system that I can think of that uses a monthly reset is Hearthstone, and that's because Hearthstone is fast-paced and designed to be super casual.
---
Have you tried playing civilization V?
---
It's a bad idea, it would just be a complete pubstomp for anyone who knows what they're doing, they would win every game and no one would have any incentive to improve
---
I don't think changing the rarity of the add-on will change anything but removing collision could be a drawback of prayer beads.
---
I agree, it is a bad analogy. 
---
The only thing is, while dc'ing is worse, it's not cool to waste 5-10 mins of a survivors time when killers get 30-60 second lobbies. 
---
Maybe instead of a time penalty, you should be matched with higher ranked players or groups if you dc a lot. I just think that such behavior should be penalized.
---
It is an unpopular opinion after all.
---
If you played better than me then you cheated that is the unspoken rule of DBD!
---
yes but, she has the brain of a 7-year-old.
---
MOMMY
---
Amen brother.

not an M1, but chainsaw always worked as well. No hit sounds, no blood, no screams, nothing.
---
I checked M1s the other day as well but it was during a day of playing Hag only so I can't find it. There I only played one bubba match so I knew where to look for it
---
Not EVERY killer needs a mobility option to be viable
---
Ghost isn't getting a rework. He's a good killer, not op, an still new.
---
finally someone gets the reference
---
I main Nurse....
---
I agree. Saying that word is pretty fuckin rude in my book and I downvote it accordingly.
---
Finishing the game in only minutes?! wow what nonsense! \*survivor mains all agree than think for a second and slowly looks down\*
---
People buy this game and play for like 10 hours and hop on this sub, a lot of noobs here
---
You have to finish as many gens as there are players in the match. Each game starts with 5 players. 
---
Hatch spawns closed when: 
---
—Four gens are finished and 1 survivor is dead (four players remaining; 3 survivors + 1 killer)
---
—Three gens are finished and 2 survivors are dead (three players remaining; 2 survivors + 1 killer)
---
If 3 survivors are dead, hatch will either open if it’s already spawned or spawn opened if enough gens hadn’t been done. 
---
If killer closes hatch at this point, endgame collapse begins and survivor’s only option is using a key or opening exit gates. 
---
Killer can also activate endgame collapse by opening exit gates, in which case hatch stays open. (Killer cannot open exit gates after endgame collapse has been started.)
---
Opening exit gates are the only way a survivor can activate endgame collapse.
---
Hex: Rotation Lock
---
It should make a second basement spawn. There's the Entity's basement, and then the Killer's "Monstrous Shrine."
---
Bonus points if it contains an empty chest to bait Survivors.
---
Yea you can.the ps4 elite controller is programmable and only costs a few bucks more than a regular controller.
---
Also,turbo controllers have been a thing since the 90's haha
---
That would be hilarious
---
"impact gate speed"
---
how about
---
"impact the gates activating at all"
---
Funniest thing is, BPS used to be brown offerings but ostensibly with the rarity of green. Then they reworked the rarities and now you see green BPS
---
A much more simple and elegant solution would to simply give survivors in every match voice comms, now every match is swf! :D
---
From the guy's perspective who keeps getting put back on hook so his game is over in matter of moments, yeah, you're pretty toxic. It's up to you rather or not you want to change your play based on that perspective.
---
pretty good job so far. imo it should be fixed. if the devs want to keep the timing, they need to change the animation to represent the true situation
---
Can confirm.
---
People are definitely overreacting to Spirit because she's the only viable high-rank Killer and everyone up there is tired of seeing her, but she needs a few adjustments. Beads actually is unfair, removing a balance mechanic with no downside, and her vault animation being missing is essentially a bug.
---
Dont really agree with him being able to turn during shred to turn him into a billy copy but I wish he had higher level addons to reduce the missed shred recovery
---
I didn't think it was more obvious that the next season was based in Russia...
---
Also I extremely doubt this is the case. Why spirit of all killer and why this show? There's no correlation other then DLC, if dbd killer were put into a show it'd be their own one
---
Not right now he isn’t but I wouldn’t be surprised if BHVR decides to given their track record and people don’t particularly like to play against him (which I don’t get he’s really fun to go against) but enough complaining could twist BHVRS hand let’s not forget about og Freddy
---
How do you set up those? I want to take a bite at my sandwich without having to throw it all of the sudden
---
"If a survivor is bad then we die, therefore survivors dont have an advantage" ok survivor
---
great gif.  love Patriot so much
---
I believe they said they wouldn't do that though. Could be wrong though
---
Have you tried any of counterplay I suggested?? they could increase your chances of winning against a spirit. You can't treat Spirit like any another killer looping works on most killers but with Spirit your most likely to lose the chase so losing her in an chase or being stealthy increases the likely hood of you surviving.
---
What company is this!?
---
This is funny but that title makes me wanna downvote.
---
"NeW foRmaT" shut up
---
I'd rather the drawback match the concept. So, Prayer Beads removes the auditory warning; make it give her Wraith-style visibility when phasing. There's still a warning she's coming, but it uses a different sense and so has different situations it's effective in.
---
They're all like rank 15s
---
Question. Did you make this?
---
Looks great but I don’t think big booty Jane would fit in that locker....
---
Demoman Gorgon
---
Dem Ogre Gone
---
Demog Organ
---
Demogorgon
---
Showerthought: Legion kids arent entirely evil, they went on a killing spree of being super fucking high and the entity keeps them high kinda like it keeps quentin sleep deprived
---
No. They all got reworked to give her bloodpoints. That’s not a buff.
---
Beacause spirit has less counterplay
---
Oh yeah i remember trying to mind game a spirit, had father glasses and smacked me no problem
---
HAHAHA
---
That’s why everyone is playing spirit.
---
it's almost like it's a bad thing!? Idgaf about your us vs them mentality, this isn't a competition of who's more oppressed.
---
Lol
---
If they're smart, the devs will just nerf beads and give a vault animation, maybe brighten up her shards when phasing. Anything else and they're handing Survivors invincibility.
---
And I don't imagine the Doctor buff allegedly coming after will make him strong enough to replace Nurse.
---
thats what they are implying.
---
I don’t encounter her that much on Xbox surprisingly. And I don’t want to run perks I don’t normally use on the off chance I will meet her. Like I don’t ever run spine chill, I prefer premonition. I think having to run a perk specifically to have to counter her is bad design when you can usually make any sort of perk build work against any of the other killers in the game. 
---
I have tried the normal sort of survivor strategies and have found that they don’t work all that well when compared to other killers. I can deal with every other killer in the game but her, and I think a large part of the player base feels the same which is why she needs to be tweaked. I think her power is interesting there just needs to be more cues for survivors to play off so it is not just a guessing game against her.
---
This is a good point, OoO still lights up even if you cant see the aura, its basically a permanent premonition
---
I'm not a plague main, but when I get SWF curbstomped at red ranks this is how it goes:
---
They toolbox through thana and can loop a tall M1 killer for a minute per hit as long as there're pallets and good tiles, so they don't give a shit if they're injured all game and can't hide. Gens get done in 5-6 minutes. They all get to a fountain and cleanse basically simultaneously, strategically avoiding fountains near the gates or center of the map. 
---
In many cases if I want to go corrupt I have to let them open the gate and leave. Even if they accidentally give me a convenient corrupt, then the situation is I have to try and 4k before it runs out or I get stunned against ds/bt/unbreakable. On a lot of maps the game spawns a loop at the gate which makes this situation super difficult.
---
I think the worst thing you can do is cleanse as soon as you're broken over and over, but that said you still have to play carefully and be good at the game to do the no-cleanse strat.
---
I think both are balanced.
---
NOED is balanced because not only it can be countered but survivors have multiple ways to counter it and as if it wasnt enough, multiple tools to assist with that task. Survivors have more control over NOED happening or not than the killer itself since he can't actually protect dull totems. 
---
Counters: 
---
* Cleanse 5 totems.
---
* Just locate as many totems as you can but don't waste time cleansing it just yet. If you see the killer is struggling to catch survivors, go cleanse the totems you spotted before the last gen is done.
---
* Just locate as many totems as you can but don't waste time cleansing it. After the last gen has been repaired, revisit all the totems to see if one of them lit up. 
---
* Don't waste time looking for totems the entire match, just look for that one lit totem after the last gen is done or once someone gets hit by NOED. 
---
Tools to assist with cleansing totems:
---
* [Green Map](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Map) with [Red Twine](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Red_Twine) add-on.
---
* [Small Game](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Small_Game). Just mindlessly run around the map and do a thorough search when the alert goes off, reducing the time wasted looking for totems. 
---
* [Detective's Hunch](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Detective%27s_Hunch). Doing your objective AND easily finding totems. (this perk recently got a really good buff in the last patch). 
---
Not a tool but comes with play time. Memorize most if not all props that can contain a totem attached to it. Drastically reduces the time spent looking for totems. 
---
Very rare but not impossible, you can loop a killer with NOED (just like an EW3 myers + the mov speed) to some extent and escape without getting hit. 
---
So yeah, NOED is fine. Feels very cheap because of the 1-shot but still fine. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
*"bUt HoW cAn I dO aLl ThIs If ThE KiLlEr ChAsEd Me, HiT mE wItH nOeD aNd My TeAm SaT bY tHe ExIt GaTes?"*
---
You see, the problem here is not the **perk**, is your teammates or players in general. They should be doing any of the steps above while you were being chased.
---
It also forces the killer to play with 3 perks throughout the entire match leaving him at a disadvantage right from the start for a hope that he will have NOED.
---
Adrenaline is balanced for the same reason as NOED, you put yourself in a disadvantage through the entire match just so you can maybe get the edge during endgame by not having to waste time healing. If you die before that, you wasted a perk slot.
---
I mean I run about bleeding for majority of the game cause resilience and tool box is op
---
??? I meant brand
---
open a ticket with bhvr on their site. they'll give your auric cells to you
---
I’m interested to see what people say here. I love Myers and I’ve played him more than any other killer and I’m still not sure what his best build would be.
---
Matching me with higher ranked players wouldn't effect me because I'm already stuck in rank 1, I might just dodge on purpose to try to find the sweatiest survivors possible too.
---
From the looks of things you only unhooked one person and barely ran into the killer that’s probably why
---
This comment made me laugh very hard. Imagine calling this "rework" a buff, jeez you r living in your delusional bubble for real.
---
ELI5 what's going on with dedicated servers. How are they affecting gameplay?
---
They don't want to because it breaks the atmosphere of the game, but I dont see any other solution
---
spine chill is a necessity imo. I like resilience too bc relying on randoms for heals is an absolute meme
---
freddy is one of the strongest killers with dying light thanataphobia and slowdown addons. slap ruin and  either sloppy butcher or pop goes the weasel and thats a guranteed 3k if youre somewhat decent.
---
No??
---
That's really weird, never had that problem.
---
Just run Iron Will
---
Right. I'm about to get my second piece. Not sure I'll get all 6.
---
I didn't buy the pass. I expected it'd be too grindy, but I could always buy it if/after I completed it. So that's vindicating.
---
Spirit would be terrible if they did that tbh
---
Always willing to do it but I'm gonna just take a wild guess he's on console like every one else on the planet apparently.
---
Before the update I* ran BBQ, nurses, ruin, and monitor. I doubt it was the best build, but it certainly isn't with the update involving his tier 1.
---
Oh, a "genius" but i doesn't have any fancy buttons to config stuff
---
Just accept she's dead. Accept it and play spirit as long as possible since she's the next killer who gets nerfed after that well  good luck trying to dominate as billy on difficult maps against strong survivors
---
I think they both are dumb and unfun to go against
---
That's not what I meant I know you can't visibly see her when vaulting but whenever I'm chased by a spirit they usually go around a wall or something rather than vault.
---
I guess deleting the add-on would be messy a rework would be better.
---
Facts 💯
---
Oh no a nerf to make counterplay against something basically uncounterable. The horror.
---
Lmaooo please get someone to sing this
---
That's what I'm afraid of.
---
Did you win? GG
---
Did you lose? Fucking bullshit
---
She has more counter play then a god tier nurse
---
While I haven't played her myself, from what I hear there is an issue with the landing position of the blinks stuttering. They've been working on fixing those issues, but last I heard it was still a problem.
---
Adrenaline is for sure
---
F for the survivors.
---
Use Dwight to get Bond and get Spine Chill while you do it too. The former lets you know who is near you, who is injured, who is being chased, etc. and the latter lets you know when a killer is coming for you specifically; this will help you massively with knowing what's going on. Your performance in-game will give you points to spend on these. Then gameplay should be prioritized as \[healing --&gt; gens --&gt; wasting killers time if chased\]. It's much more complicated depending on the killer you face but that's the bare bones basics. It's not that important at low level though, just try to survive and enjoy the experience. If you like the game then over time character specific perks can be used with other characters, which mean you can have crazy perk combos.
---
"Mori" - an offering burnt that lets the killer do a cool execution without needing to sacrifice you on a hook 3 times. Only works after they hook you once.
---
"Hex" - a perk that is deactivated when a survivor breaks a skull totem hidden on the map. Usually more powerful but more temporary, if you see red skill checks you it's "Hex: Ruin" and you can disable it if you find a **glowing** skull (not dull skull) on the ground somewhere. Only **glowing** skulls are ones that are tied to a perk, the others are duds. The killer knows when you disable one.
---
"Looping" - wasting the killer's time during a chase by running around the same obstacle over and over. Requires a pallet or window since the threat of losing you on the other side stops them from just rushing you. Critical to give time for other people to do gens.
---
"Farming teammates" - using teammates for points instead of trying to get everyone to live. Rushing up and unhooking next to the killer is usually this since they'll get downed instantly and you basically halved their live span when you should have ran the killer away or let him leave.
---
It's not that many things, to be honest. I find that the game at a high level is about deducing what perks your opponent has, your looping/anti-loop game, and pressure. Pressure is either doing gens or hooking survivors depending on the role, just something that places you closer to the win scenario and forces your opponent to play more precisely. None of this matters at low ranks though, just play as you think you should and have fun. Low level is chaos and silliness lol. I recommend playing survivor at first, then trying your hand at killer after a couple games.
---
Still the best? Sooo, how does it come that noone plays her anymore and all you see is spirits and ghostfaces since the last weeks? The answer is simple: Nurse is dead.
---
Oh you mean Captain Cutler from scooby doo.
---
Funny you can’t even respond to him
---
to be honest, and i know they claim a rework is coming, i think they are about to get rid of ranks. i think, and these are just approximates, 75% want them gone, 15% want them in, and 10% dont care either way
---
Yeah, I was just being glib.
---
I wouldn't even call it a rework. Just a nerf. Nerf beads and it should be fine.
---
Just play Spirit and win 90%
---
I'm not home either so I havent been able to. Wouldnt recommend downloading it without wifi. Also not sure if it would let me play once downloaded since I'm in the US and idk if the android I have can run it
---
c--
---
You think I'm cute?
---
❤
---
No, I died in first hook
---
Shred can be activated beforehand and gives more bp for actions done with it.
---
They dc against me.
---
Just because nobody plays her doesn't mean she isn't the best still. Ghostface and Spirit are just easier to play, this is how it used to be before the nerf too. Nurse has always had a high skill requirement.
---
Also Rift: 6 level gap with empty free slots on last Page. Just put some BP here, BHVR
---
Her hair looks different when she's phasing. Also, when she is phasing, if you are unhurt and stop running and crouch off a different direction, she won't know exactly where you are, giving you a chance to fully evade or at least get to a jungle gym. If you are hurt, use the same strategy used against a nurse: constantly change direction when you think she's getting close.
---
Imagine needing to counter Trapper though.
---
Although Small Game hits him twice because Hex: Ruin is mandatory on all Killers.
---
Они в шкафчиках, Джонни! Они в шкафчиках!
---
The simple answer is most Nurses realized they actually sucked at Nurse and don't get handed free wins with Omegablink anymore.
---
All the good Nurses are still utterly destroying with her.
---
I wish I could :/
---
They're pretty bad if you managed to get TWO kills by face camping in the end game, how did they manage to fuck up so badly?
---
Edit: forgot basement existed nvm
---
I mean, it's a pretty basic meme. Not much to get.
---
That was probably me. I thought I was bullying babies from the early game, but it turned out they were above my rank.
---
Mercy is a painful mistake in this world.
---
Bill (Borrowed), Nea (Balanced), David (We gonna live foreva (farm BP), Deadhard)
---
I guess
---
Looks like wolf’s mask in payday 2
---
Nope, why ?
---
I do but just not all the time usually when i vault and then i wait to see which way they go. In a straight line i just look forward until i see a pallet or vault then check behind to see distance. Looking forward most of the time always helps me with dead hard because i wait till i see their red stain on my clothes instead of looking back which will tell them i have DH
---
You don't, or get extremely lucky. They are in fact reworking her because of this.
---
If you want to see a lot of good Trapper gameplay, watch Otzdarva on twitch or Not Otzdarva on YT
---
Rule 8 rule 8
---
At least take solace that the survivors did it to themselves. They should have known what kind of game they were getting
---
That doesn't make it any less the best exhaustion perk barring Balanced Landing on a really good map, where the killer just walks away anyway
---
Just because sometimes something doesn't work out doesn't make it not broken, especially when 4 people can have it. An extra pallet is a lot of time and if you're in the open you're already an idiot and probably don't know how to even use DH let alone properly loop lol
---
Wow that looks impressive!! Can you do more of that style of artwork? I would LOVE to see legacy nurse and Dweard!!!
---
Honestly.
---
Just make teabagging in the exit area pop a 5 second Blood Warden, or Exhausted in general.
---
Squats are tiring.
---
I have to agree. I don't think Freddy is OP, but he's annoying as shit to play against because he has so much utility in his kit from his add-ons, and that's just before you even get to his perks. Idk, I'm just not with the idea that a killer should have 3 different powers. I think they should have either gave him snares or pallets, and saved the other idea for another killer.
---
I am disturbed
---
shes got the mind of a 7 year old.
---
There's a perk for her to counter that I though isn't there and how will iron will help if she can see us.
---
I'm kinda half and half I mainly play survivor now due to killer lobbies taking forever. 
---
That is true most game mechanics don't work against Spirit same as old nurse. I feel like if you ever get Spirit it would be helpful because you would know how good survivors play against her see if their strats could work for you.
---
Which is exactly why Nurse got nerfed.
---
I think they count DCs as kills, in which case I can see how they'd think that.
---
If you catch the belt then you play as killer
---
T O X I C
---
PGTW needs another level first.
---
Can we get the base printed one as well like without the paint?
---
Did you get this from Facebook?
---
That's what it seems like definitely first killer I'm buying.
---
I third this
---
The Spirit can simply look down while standing still. It appears as if she's looking straight ahead and she can still see you leave while not getting blinded at all. It does not work.
---
That’s just my normal build. Didn’t construct it to be toxic (other than the add ons)
---
That's it, from now own I'm downvoting every "wholesome messages" post I see, they're not special, they're not rare, I see them everyday, and worst of all they're boring.
---
Cuz nurse is garbage now
---
It is a mechanism against slugging,which isn’t fun for anyone. Then again,it you want to play optimally as a killer, you sometimes have to slug.
---
Billy vs. Billy
---
Who would win?
---
Get hooked, the other two go rescue, another gets hooked, you’ve done one gen and now have to do two rescues and loop them killer for 3 minutes so the boys can find the glorified hex totem and play. 
---
A story of sole survivors.
---
I'm pretty sure the spooky ones actually have different stats
---
You can set up macros with software only.
---
Exactly. Idk how they could make these totem spots and think they’re balanced.
---
Didn't know the pig was a guy
---
Unfortunately you can go to the official forums and see a dev there constantly talking about how he doesn't need Ruin, and has fun games without it and so it isn't mandatory. People like that guy are the reason nothing gets balanced, because they're in their own idiotic fucking world.
---
Dont forget Bubba, for BBQ (good perk, sweet bonus BP, also a lot of giggles from BM bois who DC just because you Bubba)
---
Wait, are you saying the Sloppy Butcher + Distressing meta isn't all the rage? Damn.
---
Oh I don't DC I'll never be one of those. Unless the killers slugging me during end game just to bm. Then I'll dc ain't nobody got time for that.
---
ok boomer
---
Bill
---
Uhm...30 seconds? Are you actually aware that most of the Killers would consider themselfes extremely lucky when a chase would only last 30 seconds? Not everyone's chase efficiency is similar to Nurse or Ghostface y'know?
---
And I must correct you if you actually think that stealth Killers and Spirit are a good comparasion as they are not at all. EW 2 Mirror Myers sucks so much that none plays it while EW 1 Mirror Myers is extremely map dependant. Ghostface aswell as Myers can be seen while they stalk, if they've hid themselfes well, good for them, the Survivor might not recognize them until it's too late, but that's up to the Survivor, as you said.
---
The difference between stealth Killers and Spirit is that they can be recognized. You have literally NO cue what a still standing Spirit does while there is a pallet inbetween you. meaning she lacks reactive counterplay and thus turning chases against her in a Spirit vs herself and a coin toss at every pallet for the Survivor. Which is everything else but fair.
---
Nurse's blinks can be somewhat predicted, stealth Killers can be spotted during their assaults, Spirit does not give away if she phases or not during a chase in any way. If you can't see the problem behind that, the problem is with you, and not with Spirit actually not having a problem to begin with.
---
L2 charges your power when it’s full you hit R2 to shred
---
Fantastic idea, but it's BHVR. They'll consider it 2021
---
I think it's explicitly griefing. Everyone sees fun happening and newer players being able to approach their level of initial advantage and ABSOLUTELY HATES IT.
---
After how many years of being out?
---
Dang took my post
---
Actually pretty well done, honestly.
---
That's very wrong, spirit is very easy to pick up and master. It took me just 10 hours after nurse nerf and I was slaughtering EVERY single match since then. I have a higher kill ratio with spirit than with Nurse  and I was a nurse main for ~1000 hours
---
Yeah nerf is better word for it. Also some say Yakuyoke Amulet is op what's your opinion on that?
---
For you maybe
---
Oh luckly I picked it up in the shrine 2 weeks ago.
---
Helping a crap ton since all my killers are only around lvl 20.
---
If they do, that's even more reason to make them always drop and just increase their frequency on holidays.
---
Been lucky enough to get it on most of them
---
What are they fighting for
---
Very well deserved nerf for Spirit.
---
He’s a good boi
---
I just got BBQ for him but haven’t used it much. I think that and Ruin would be part of a strong build. Myers is a slow starter so Ruin is very helpful.
---
When you got all 4 SWF bully stack in your basement and enjoy from post-game salt
---
Adrenaline yes, NOED Against Swf Yeah Against any solos no. 
---
But I don’t think the mms should be part of NOED.
---
I used the perk fixated.  Drop the pallet early, wait for her to phase,  don’t go towards her in case she is bluffing the phase.  After a phase you have roughly 20 seconds before she can do it again and she is 110% speed.  Just make as much distance as possible. 
---
Break line of sight as much as possible
---
I don't have a problem with adrenaline, dead hard for distance can be annoying. I also haven't seen a single styptic or syringe since the nerf so I dont know about that yet
---
Why Adam? Adam Mains are true Chads. Unlike Nea, Meg, Claudette, Laurie, Ace and Feng Mains.
---
I feel like an underrated yet huge contributor to toxicity Im swf is peer pressure, people dont want to correct their friends when they're raging at the killer. It's a lot easier for everyone to blame the killer for everything, after all the killer is always some random that's not in the call.
---
The entity is the timer. OP said without the timer Nea would have escaped, and I believe she would have.
---
Im here to read all of the arguments
---
Leaving people injured prevents tunneling though surely?
---
Уууууууу сука!

---
*Looping a sandwhich, only makes it tastier*
---
For a mori
---
The devs are approaching EA-tier, so that won't happen, but I'd at least like for the shard costs to drop off some. Like, Hag and Doctor should be much cheaper, and then everyone between them and the most recent Killer should have their cost scale UP to 9k, with Survivors being less because they don't bring a new power, just their perks.
---
Also not happening, but it'd be nice.
---
oh man if you just started the match looking like one of the survivors in your lobby and had a chance to hide your form &amp; play mindgames
---
(shame SWF is so prevalent since that makes this basically unviable no matter what)
---
It's fun seeing people find out about it for the first time.
---
Personally, I say 3. Scrap FF and figure out something more fitting to their story.
---
Not totally true, if you read the book you’ll find Pennywise murdered tons of adults as well for as long as the town of Derry had been there. He preyed on children and preferred their fears over adults, but he was also the cause of every huge massacre that happened in the town’s history. Most of which involved adults.
---
Okay good. I've literally just watched videos of rank 1 spirits getting multiple 4ks just by pulling people off gens. Or standing still to make people waste pallet and run straight to them. The only thing is vaults but which way do you go when she's phase locked lol. She's absolutely ridiculous. You can honestly be a trash killer and still probably get 4ks with her. I respect nurses but not Spirit.
---
Came here to say that
---
Is that what that event is for? If so then I'd argue it's actually more confusing for newer players. I started not too long ago and every time I got the bleeding event I assumed it was because I just got close to some blood on the ground so I'd stare down and try to find it.
---
Spirit or Wraith don't have reasons too.
---
I don't understand, what I said isn't an opinion-based statement. You cannot blind a Spirit looking downwards, therefore you cannot reliably blind her when she is standing still to determine if she is still there because she can be looking down. There is no "for me, maybe." That's it, that's just what happens.
---
\*Claudette, covered in radiating red glare from the Collapse,  opening the gate with 4 seconds left*

\*bong bong*
---
Well, because everyone is injured, it's basically a one shot spray projectile for them, which is brutal. You could say everyone should cleanse, but that means she gets a near limitless supply of ranged damage juice. 60s of that isn't the end of the world if everyone is healthy and can take a spurt, but she'll have 4 corrupt purges over and over, and that will mean constant corrupt purge which is just as damaging.
---
Purging is fine near completed gens away from the killer, since she has to break patrol and waste time to get it then come back. The more gens in that side of the map done the better, since it means she has divert more time away from the current gens. However, this scenario is pretty rare, and people just hate cleansing regardless, so don't expect a pat on the back. Cleansing during emergencies such as going for last minute rescues is also alright - people will say it's dangerous for the unhooked person, but you getting downed instantly means they're dead anyway, and the killer can't safely leave the hook during EGC to get the corrupt purge anyway.
---
Here’s a link to help you better understand the ranking system. Escaping doesn’t guarantee a pip, hence the emblem system. This breaks down how you can get more points per emblem and what gives you x points. 
---
PS the killer probably depipped too.

Not really, that's how Huntress' Hatchet hitboxes have always been. The amount of Huntress that get carried by her watermelon sized hatchets is quite insane actually. And also extremely infuriating for every Survivor. I myself have been struck by hatchets while already been around the corner dozens of times already. But I guess that happened to everyone atleast once or times.
---
But yeah, it was Claudettes own fault for underestimating Huntress in general.
---
That’s true but as a survivor getting chased by a cute legion or billy or whoever isn’t exactly as mortifying. But i understand completely why they make these sorts of outfits and there’s nothing wrong with it, just not my taste.
---
If I see you gen tapping my gens as the killer I'm chasing you because I know you're ba- inexperienced at the game
---
No, just no
---
What does that have to do with anything? The devs are slow, everyone knows this.
---
Myers wins. 
---
Trapper is like Jason But trapper can die while Jason can basically go in a coma for a year lol.
---
omg ive loved this idea for so long i just have zero art skills to draw it out, glad someone else does tho 🔥
---
If this doesn’t become a Legion skin, I am uninstalling.
---
All she needs is to remove prayer beads, even as killer I feel like I'm exploiting if I ever use them
---
If you do that I'm downing both and only hanging the saver.
---
He doesn't need to go back on the hook for that, not his fault. But he also doesn't get off scott free.
---
Why would fixated help against her? Isn't it just seeing your scratch marks. In most situations she will catch up. In the spots she can't she'll just break the pallet for later
---
You are right. Feral frenzy should apply the BROKEN status effect instead.
---
BHVR, pay this man.
---
This is an incredible idea!
---
Legendary!
---
Ruin is a necessity because killers have no early game pressure and there is a distinct lack of early game perks.
---
Bbq is a necessity because the grind is so horrible.
---
Fix both of these problems and they'll become less common
---
Monitor is still good,  you just don’t need it now for the scratched mirror build. 
---
Myers is on of those killers that can use almost any kind of build. 
---
A new fun one is the scream for me Myers Build. 
---
Infectious fright, knock out, monitor and Abuse , ruin(or any slow down perk). 
---
Run it with dead rabbit and another add on of your choice. 
---
The idea is you can stealth really well in tier 2(16 meter terror radius - monitor 8 meters - dead rabbit) tier up to three for large terror radius from dead rabbit plus 8 meters from monitor and down someone to trigger a large infectious fright reveal, knock out means they don’t know where they went down or what direction your coming from.  Play an offering for Lerys, the game, or Hawkins and you can go from one chase to 4 downs quickly.
---
Freddy is a really strong killer now. He can end chases quickly, apply a lot of pressure, and slow the game down just by existing.
---
I'm sorry.  I thought it was Jonny Bravo at first.  XD
---
Now remake the locker with a little Dweet peeping out of it.
---
He’s good mate
---
He can't one shot people with shred so giving him the ability to turn isnt op.
---
ahahahahahah yep xD then I would go for Mikey's
---
Whoa there buddy, take a chill pill
---
It is an absurd argument because I made it out of the one you made. :)
---
If the killer is disrespecting somebody's time by continuing to try with somebody slugged, so is the survivor. 
---
Since that is absurd, it follows they're both absurd arguments.
---
Another annoying thing that makes Trapper bad :(
---
I feel sad for you because you have to put others down to make yourself feel good...
---
I always pretend that they're trying to make it look like a comic book art style
---
I am as chill as a butterfly, just laughing.
---
Vibe check
---
According to a stream, Freddy has the highest kill rate or something like that at the moment.
---
I mean the way I play I'm likely to pip off a 3k anyways or at the very least guaranteed safety.  Is a 3k really the worst thing in the absolute world?  I don't mind giving them a chance to make it there first.  And since I play half my time on both sides I know how thoroughly bullshit it feels to be slugged for that amount of time so I don't do it to others.  I remember it's a game and there's room to play cool and still win for both sides.
---
hahahah yeah xD, I wish one day we can see Jason too in the game...
---
I read the patch notes for every update and I remember there was one a while ago saying something about fixing a graphical issue that made her shards glow. It disappeared and came back only recently after an update.
---
And where do you get that from at all? 
---
I mean when you are playing Killer you are in first person and when you are playing survivor you are in third person. 
---
2 big drastic differences that you see right off the bat.
---
No, OoO against Freddy is still fine. GF got Undetectable which blocks aura reading when in stealth tho
---
Something just as boring and tedious as spacebar.
---
U motha fuck a
---
Fair enough. I did read the book, though that was about 9-10 years ago, so I forgot that.
---
Replace sloppy and noed with make your choice and ruin, it's much better, and put on movement speed and charge speed addons (Dirty Uwabaki and bloody hair brooch)
---
Fuck
---
No it doesn't man because it was a flimsy false equivalency to begin with.  What part of being slugged for 4 minutes so the opponent who defeated you continues to play their game feels like shit for them do you not understand?   Be objective for 2 seconds.
---
That would be pretty cool but I wouldn’t be so hopeful because through the whole lawsuit thing Jason’s license is a mess.
---
p l s
---
brooo! dont do this to me! its still NNN
---
He loved people who didn't fit in and the bullied. He'd eat up Claudette and Dwight faster than you could blink.
---
Ok big brain gamer, how about this: after playing for 8 hours, maybe your tired brain can make a small mistake one time after 1000 hours playing dbd?
---
For some reason? Jesus christ you're fucking dense. Being slugged is fucking boring and defeats the purpose of playing a game; as you're not playing jack shit.
---
And then if you're unlucky enough to get an abuser who slugs you, the very last person who isn't dead, as they spam shake their mouses, swing at the all and watch you slowly bleed out, only to pick you up and hook you.
---
That's abuse.
---
Had it once or twice recently. Strangely enough the game usually makes it up to me within the next game or 2 I've noticed where it let's me keep an item after death
---
Truetalent did a test with her on stream right after the rework and she requires 4 fully-charged blinks to catch up to a survivor she just hit assuming they are running in a straight line. That was 90% of the length of the whole Blood Lodge. This was with her best addons. Billy and Spirit can still catch up to a survivor they just hit with one use of their abilities with no add-ons.
---
I'll agree people blow the nerf out of proportion, but Nurse lost some catch-up potential, no matter how experienced the player is.
---
I mean everyone’s got their priorities I guess. People like to try hard to get the 4k two get a pip or even double pip if they were good enough. I see why it’s annoying but there’s people who play to win, and less for fun lol
---
Omfg 😂😂😂
---
Oh yeah it only takes that much cus I'm red rank and killer's can get really sweaty lol
---
https://youtu.be/auvHNhHTjpM
---
Did you know that a lot of animal offspring are abandoned after a certain age in their childhood? Yet somehow they continue to nature mentally. It's almost like having or not having parents isn't a factor in how you turn out mentally.
---
 Take your psuedo-psychology and shove it up your ass.
---
Oh my god literally same character, same killer, same bs
---
*My stomach after I eat a hearty breakfast*
---
But then there would be no variety
---
Yeah. If you want to play alternative to the way I play, go fuck yourself!
---
Maybe console to pc crossplay might happen. That would be nice because some of my friends want to play dead by daylight with me but they dont want to buy it since im on ps4 and they are on computer.
---
Being slugged is the exact same as being hooked lol
---
Please, go on. Find me where in the lore it says that she's "mentally a child."
---
Yeah mate I’ve never seen anyone make this kind of mistake though. 
---
The whole point of what I said is to show you that you’re essentially making yourself look bad. Im not even trying to make you look bad you did that yourself lol.
---
I like the tactical choice to show these are the kinds of players running self care and urban evasion
---
i'm feng :)
---
Pc or console?
---
&gt;Aslong as LF, Plague, Clown, Wraith and Doctor are on the table
---
doctor? r u tryna say he needs a buff?
---
If im playing against a nurse I can see what they are doing with how long she hold her hand out and where they are looking  and take in that info but if a spirit stops at a pallet how do I know what she is doing, I have to guess aka coin flip
---
I’ve seen multiple streamers play her at high ranks and get pretty easy looking 4Ks. She still ignores walls, pallets, and loops.
---
&gt; she can’t blink constantly
---
Yeah, if she could then she’d get a 4K if a hamster were playing her.
---
He is pretty solid.
---
Not what I said. Go fuck yourself if you self care in a corner while I go into struggle then urban evade over to me, throwing the entire game in the process.
---
Ok gamer.
---
Pray
---
well, hey there pretty momma
---
Ah my bad man, you sounded pretty pissed
---
He could create like water around his terror radius like the doctor that slows you down (not so much like clown slow a lot less slow) and maybe it would charge up like Myers but only when you injure/down and when it fully charges you can ruin a certain part of survivor gameplay for a certain amount of time (for example the controls get reversed) but I don’t know honestly
---
If survivors didnt whine and dc they would actually probably escape
---
She's literally a hundred years old. She doesn't look like it because she's in the entity's realm where time doesn't exist. And no, she isn't seven mentally either because you don't stop aging mentally when your parents die.
---
Is this supposed to be an insult or do you recognize that I’m a gamer simply due to my comment on your post.
---
i think if you get out of the "every competent team is a sweaty 4man swf" mentality, even the devs said 4 man is rare as fuck and 3man is not that high also, and concentrate on your game and mistakes instead of the false blame game you will get much better. like i play a lot solo and i get so many "fucking filthy swf" endgame chats its insane. it like the cheat accusations in cs.
---
Same with Nurse's "fatigue". Why the fuck is a ghost getting tired?? Shes also unusable on console, with the shitty turn-rate.
---
&gt;As for Freddy I think he's very strong but people are far too quick to label new mechanics as overpowered. I don't understand how Freddy is overpowered when half of his power is essentially Clown / Doctor's fake pallets, and the other half is map mobility which Killers like Billy already have far more of.
---
If people are calling him OP that's silly.  Last I checked, his snares have clear telegraphs and they're like giant red circles of blood on the ground.  When he uses them in a chase, sure, then it's like going against Clown, but that mostly combats looping.  His teleportation can be strong but it has a windup time and there's also a clear telegraph when he does it.  Dream pallets suck but they can also be easy-ish to identify.
---
I've never been yoinked by a Spirit but I was yoinked by a Hag last night because I didn't know they had taken away the teleport animation from her phantasms. 
---
Not reading patch notes = me stupid &gt;.&lt;
---
I Will go pray for the entity
---
Why are they only at level 40?
---
She can literally still teleport through every game mechanic. People good with her still get regular 4Ks. She is so far from dead your comment reads like you haven’t actually played her.
---
Fixated, iron will, spine chill, dance with me.
---
Not even remotely. You die much, much faster on the hook and get a max of 2 chances. The second phase kills you instantly if you just don't press spacebar. With the option of unhooking yourself either actually getting you off the hook or getting you to the second phase faster.
---
Slugging is a grueling, very fucking slow way of dyng in the game with no way to make it kill you fast, and if you don't have unbreakable you're sool.
---
When you put it like that, yeah. Survivors that do that are the worst.
---
Only during the event? Throwing fellow survivors under the bus is my favorite thing to do as a salty solo survivor
---
Naw but to say something isn’t as good as something else doesn’t mean it still isn’t good in general.
---
Because that is when their last teachable perk unlocks
---
&gt; Once people understand the ranking system is bunk they will most likely DC over anything they consider unfair. 
---
Wish more people understood this. ranking is a function of how many hours you play in a given month basically. 
---
you can be a complete potato killer or survivor and easily get red ranks.
---
Did you message them first?
---
4 hours after posting and no one has noticed that wglf is purple

Let dumbasses be dumbasses

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/du2txk/okay_folks_who_sabotaged_this_hook/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I've had the same thing tonight! I tried and it just hit the hook every time.
---
No. Literally nothing changed other than Nurse getting nerfed so people use Spirit more. Instead of adapting, instead of calling for BHVR to maybe balance the other killers so people don't feel forced to go Nurse/Spirit/Billy, they choose they usual third option, crying and whining for a nerf.
---
Ah, you have a point, but Spirit is hands down the best killer in the game right now. I hate saying that, since my favorite is still Myers
---
I see the same amounts of nurses as before the rework
---
1 tier per day is asking a lot though.
---
10 fragments, first 2 come from your first surv and killer game, but then you need like 10 more full games to get that tier.
---
Putting the games generously at 15 minutes from searching to end game, that's 3 hours for 1 tier.
---
IMO, that's pretty absurd. IMO, the Tomes shouldn't be required to unlock everything. Requiring a 3 hour grind for 50 days with Tomes is scummy and predatory.
---
Can you imagine fooling around with the huntress in her living room, but when she says "Why don't we...move to bedroom, da?" she just picks your tiny ass up, flings you onto her shoulder, and carries you up the stairs lmao
---
I haven’t been able to play mobile on my iPad for awhile, says it needs to download a patch but keeps failing :(
---
This is so cool!
---
Boosted rank 6
---
Even though I’m neither a girl and I don’t care for legion I love Masks! And I have to make this one!
---
Sloppy butcher, thanataphobia, the clown perk that slows down healing while in terror radius ( it kinda sucks and I can't think of the name), and nurses calling.
---
This is amazing!
---
This ^ please god yes
---
OP, no. Legion has been relatively underpowered since their launch. But holy fuck were they the most *awful* killers to face for a while. The “mend” bar used to deplete as long as you weren’t in a chase, no matter how close the Legion was to you. This resulted in Legions cheesing the fuck out of chase mechanics to guarantee a down on survivors after a Frenzy hit. Frenzy was also WAY faster back then (as it should be...), and you could double stab a survivor to take a chunk off their mend bar.
---
I've never heard that. Sounds like it's coming from the same people saying Spirit's OP in general, although it does seem like it should switch rarities with Father's Glasses.
---
Yeah my boy needs some more outfits
---
Because they don’t know how to counter you. Also, the whole grass thing is very situational. Not every map is covered with grass (except Yamaoka Estate of course).
---
I play a lot of Spirit. When I play survivor, I imagine what I would do as Spirit. That’s why it’s my number 1 tip. You would not believe how much this helps.
---
Oh well, let’s agree to disagree
---
So it’s ok to face camp if that’s how they think you should play
---
Very interesting! Thanks!
---
that’s not the point of this post. you honestly wouldnt understand at all if you don’t play console. that’s like assuming you know what mcdonald’s taste like when you have only even eating burger king. definitely not saying bk is better though
---
Honestly to tbag you need to have right position and direction. I almost got screwed yesterday by direction. Plague hit me while I was healing but I was facing the wrong way, so instead of into the exit I was facing parallel to it. Luckily the cool down of being hit over is longer than it takes to walk a meter and hit. Also tip: if you hit someone on the hatch as it opens, you can close it before they can enter it
---
Well she's supposed to look like a demon and her skin is swelled up by the putrid serum. I for sure think it looks awesome
---
You forgot the incredibly low effort meme templates saying the generic dbd shit pasted onto them like "uhh camper salty survivor noed totem"
---
Yea, I'm sure the survivors didn't wanna watch either.
---
:’(
---
All of these perks are WAY too OP. A perk that makes unhooking a survivor give you another free hook? And makes them exposed to encourage tunneling? That’s probably the most egregious one.
---
The best of minds think alike
---
Not super OP on their own merits but people quickly worked out exploits like moonwalking or infinite mending which made Legion pretty terrible to play against.
---
... Just use your other hand, you only need one to drink.
---
If you have bp offerings the good ones then I would play with those. 
---
But if you don’t have that then I would just prestige. 
---
With 1 mil bp not counting any saved up dailies that’s about 35 I would say.
---
The commissioner is a Mikey fan, so she wanted a pic where our Stalky boi protects the girl from Trapper :) , it was her idea, and since Mikey is my favourite killer to play against, I give a tumbs up for her!
---
Didnt expect this to happen.
---
It’s just a balance thing, otherwise she’d know where you are all the time. I play on console and I did manage to get a few 2-3ks with old nurse. I was just getting the hang of her when the nerf went live...
---
I mean, you are running a map
---
Lol she would be broken af if they only cured the sickness
---
Get BHVR’ed

Joemama is Joe Swanson's African ancestor, who appeared in "Untitled Griffin Family History". He, like his descendant, is paraplegic, paralyzed from the waist down. In lieu of a wheelchair, he used a wild boar as his method of mobility. His best friends were Nate Griffin and Quagdingo. The three were captured by Cleveland from South Carolina, and brought to the American British colonies, along with Tobi, Ali Williams, and the African ancestors of Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons. It is unknown what became of Joemama following the arrival in the new world. The status of the wild boar is unknown as well.
---
He wouldn't fit the theme
---
yeah, i haven't seen the movies in a loooooong time im just going off the wikis, but how can I change them.
---
"That box is looking at me kinda funny.... OBLITERATE IT!!"
---
"These things are a necessity so they should be free," or "I have used this crutch for so long I gave myself a limp and now I can't walk without my crutch."
---
No the survivor objectively can't do anything to end the game before then.  The 3rd survivor is slugged.  There is no hatch, there is no exit gate...unless you're talking about voluntarily approaching killer and killing themselves as "something they can do to end the game before then."
---
Uhh....what?
---
lmao did that one dude suicide like a minute into the match
---
I've had the same problem, i just started playing nurse about a week or two ago, ohtofu has some videos, where he watches viewer games (survivor and killer) and talks about mistakes they make and how to improve on these mistakes.
---
https://youtu.be/pxnvGvXd_Rk
---
This one in perticular is a nurse game on ps4 and it helped me a lot.
---
If you want some tips on how to improve your killer game overall, then i would recommend you try and watch "Not Otzdarva", he really analyses and explains his killer games while playing different killers and that was really helpful too.
---
Also my build for the nurse at the moment are the perks nurses calling, bbq and chilli, whispers and hex ruin the first 3 perks helped me find people very fast and ruin to slow down the game a little (because as i said i'm not that good either) you could also try and swap "nurses calling" for "i'm all ears", which is a ghostface teachable and helps you during a chase
---
This would be great in the Scooby doo pack
---
They got hooked a second time and I think just fucked up pressing space or something
---
Ahe he told you fuck off in the nicest way possible, it was nice to read.
---
I just think NOED should have mms taken off and I think the perk would be fair and even more fair against solos.
---
That was my thought lol
---
A lot of people were calling him op because of the bug where he didn’t lose bloodlust when he placed his snares and you couldn’t do anything about it cause they could just bloodlust you at a pallet and slow you down which is already annoying and it’s boring to play against a killer that stacks slow down addons and perks
---
Yeah there is not always grass or corn thats is true. But there is breathing and footsteps all the time.
---
You really think all the survivors I go against are idiots and dont know what to do? :D 
---
I play both sides 50/50 and IMO there is no counter play against a good spirit, she might fall for your fake once, but a good spirit doesnt use her full power for that so she can pretty much use her power again instantly and just get you anyways.
---
So you think you are entitled enough to tell somebody how they should have fun? Lmao, survivor mains are so funny
---
!remindme 21 days
---
I should read more of this topic, I know that there is a problem with the license, but don't know how big it is.

They got cocky and started trying to be as toxic as they could. plus I had No ed.

She's mad, deluded, feral and traumatized to the point of thinking that tieing little girls by neck in freezing cold with no food is saving them. If not literally a child, she thinks extremely simple and primitive. Even the most primitive animals understand that young need to eat to survive. There's nothing that implies rational adult thinking in her story. It's not hard to get a picture if you actually read the lore.
---
Want me to go on more? I can.
---
The problem is, I dont really want to buy DLCs, so bbq and chili and Im all ears need 2 be on the shrine for me to get them (since u cant buy the characters from movies without buying the dlc). Ty for the tips!

&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here’s how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor’s rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.) 
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
&gt;* **New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there’s no other new players queuing.**
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other
---
It is a little rushed, but I think it was intentional to sound more manic.
---
I would use any and all BP offerings on a character before prestigeing, everything else is pretty pointless.
---
What is this from
---
That head nod
---
#*"YOUR SOUL IS MINE*
---
I'm going to let you in on a secret... ALL perks are crutch perks 😱
---
Crutch -  thing used for support or reassurance.
---
Literally every single perk is designed to help or support you in some way, a lot of them give you that support FOR FREE, what crutches smh. Enduring? Removes stuns FOR FREE. Whispers? FREE INFORMATION. Exhaustion perks? FREE CHASE EXTENSIONS! OH MY GOD EVERYTHINGS A CRUTCH, AAAAAAA SKILL ISNT REAL, ITS NOT REAL, NOTHINGS REAL, EVERYTHING IS A CRUTCH, ANYTIME I LOSE ITS BECAUSE OF A CRUTCH, FREE WILL DOESNT EXIST, WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE MACHINES WITH A FIXED OUTCOME, GOD IS DEAD, END MY MISERY.

I’m fine with DS, just don’t complain about Ruin and NOED.

this is standard, according to BHVR
---
Thanks for the suggestions! 
---
I tried defragmenting it about a month ago, but after about 12 hours of letting it sit, I got tired of waiting and stopped the process. I know I probably should’ve let it finish, but on the bright side when I stopped it the windows defrag tool was on its 5th pass and said that there was no fragmentation present. That’s not to say that it wouldn’t find fragmentation had I let it run all the way though, so maybe I’ll try running it again overnight. 
---
Honestly I think I just got shipped a faulty HDD by Lenovo, I was fed up about a month ago and decided to call and see if I could get a replacement, but my warranty expired literally 2 WEEKS before I tried calling support... my disk usage in task manager reaches 100% WAY too easily, it’s terrible. “System” always eats a ton of disk usage even after trying all the remedies I found online.
---
I do have intel extreme utility downloaded because I undervolt my laptop, it makes it run like 20 degrees cooler which is nice. I have noticed it say thermal throttling in the past, but never with DbD. It only happens with newer, cpu-heavy games at cranked up FPS limits, and even then it only throttles for a split second. I’ll try running the benchmark. But yeah, the cpu I have is also pretty trash. I still get 60+FPS on low-medium settings on all the games I play which is good enough for me, so for now I can’t justify getting a new pc... once I start falling below 60fps I’ll probably upgrade immediately. Just sucks that DbD is my most played game and I still get tons of stutters.
---
Sorry for lengthy response, few beers and nothing to do :p
---
It would be fun if devs made "Kill with Friends" mode where you either play with randoms or invite friends (2-3) to help you. Balance legion around this and, well, there it is. nyo-hoho

It's only good with OoO and you still don't need it if you know how to use OoO effectively
---
it's broken with OoO against freddy (you see them through walls when looping, when they don't see you), but OoO itself is so ya know... it's just an OoO upgrade

Edit: I wanted to use it with Babysitter, but you don't gain stacks when people die, it's just off the entire game.

A hydroponic corn farm. Indoors, well lit, and corn everywhere. 1 big room.

No way. Neither Clown nor Doctor have map pressure (unless Doc has TR perks) , Freddy is far and beyond those guys. And he has addons that inherently slow the game down. Neither Clown nor Doctor have that
---
My fav is Monitor, Infectious Fright, Ruin, Pop
---
Of course that's what I'm talking about: throwing an objective down the drain to make it easier on his poor teammate, whose time is so valuable that even the killer should do that for him.  Why shouldn't the survivor respect his teammate's time and forfeit in a losing game?
---
Like you say, the game is already decided but people are just acting entitled to their 4th kill (or their mercy hatch escape).
---
The Fury, from MGS3.
---
We need a flame thrower killer.
---
Everything except cheating and exploiting bugs is acceptable in a game where you are supposed to kill or survive.
---

---
I think noone uses them because they're by far the shittiest item in the game. I'd rather go into a game with nothing.
---
I used it once to get Laurie's achievement.
---
All 4 survivors dont need to escape to win as survivor, this game is unique in that both killer and survivor can win in the same game, if a killer gets 3 kills they consider it a win. And that single survivor escaping considers themselves a winner.
---
Totems are a secondary objective, NOED’s existence is the incentive to complete your secondary objective. If NOED was weaker, or didn’t exist in its current form, dull totems would be utterly pointless. As for Adrenaline, I can’t find any reason anyone would thinks it’s imbalanced, just like NOED it’s a wasted perk slot unless the survivors manage to get all 5 gens done, in which case a temporary speed boost and a heal is a fair enough reward

They did talk about a fire themed killer when people started asking about tony hawk
---
Maining Nurse at rank 16 is not the same thing as maining her at rank 1. Don't get it twisted

Sorry. Forgot to check for my grammar.
---
Them avoiding the puddles is part of why theyre good, they have to go out of their way to avoid it while you can just walk right through it and close the distance. Otherwise they have to go through it and get hit if they want to even try to loop or just run away altogether.

Bold of you to assume I drink with one hand

Dude, i would buy the game in a heart beat if they allowed cross progress. I don't want to start over after 1,000 hours.
---
Insta Dc= Insta Dislike/downvote bye!
---
Nancy
---
Looks neat, who’d be the survivor?
---
There are plenty of people out there who think BHVR is slowly destroying all killers to appease "crying survivor mains", hell some of those people are notable streamers.
---
Why does she have pants?
---
I used to use it alot. Only came in clutch ONCE and the killer still found me, ended up letting me live tho
---
Oooo that makes a lot of sense actually. I’m dumb, I didn’t consider that at all for some reason.
---
Yeah I can see it being a problem on pc a whole lot more than console but I play on console and only up until recently have I been seeing spirit almost every single match in the red ranks and they all play like they belong in yellow to brown ranks still. They all stop everything they're doing to phase back to the hook even if they're currently chasing someone half the map away and when they start getting dunked on they just start slugging everyone until everyone bleeds out. That's just some straight brown rank gameplay right there.
---
It takes no skill, no effort and no learning curve to use her and the matches just suck overall.
---
I can see where you're comming from but you have to keep in mind that this is a asymmetrical PvP game. While the Killer obviously needs advantages to have a chance of outmatching the 4 Survivors, every player as a individual needs oppurtunities to react to what the other player is doing. A perk that would suddenly erase the Survivor from existence for 10 seconds by rendering them invisible, muted, not leaving scratchmarks or anything that gives their positioning away, would be despised by Killers aswell. Simply because they can't do anything about it. And this is where the difference is between everyone else and Spirit. Nurse's blinks for example can already be predicted before she blinks. In terms of Spirit, the Survivor has absolutely no indicator and has to rely on luck in order to survive. Which's obviously intoxicating for any kind of game. In addition the Spirit has access to Stridor, which doesn't even make the gamble two-sided, since she'll hear you during her phase, regardless of using Iron Will, Spine Chill or whatsoever. Plus, the fact that you have to pick specific perks just to have better chances against a specific Killer, is lame aswell.
---
I got the game last month what am I supposed to do :(
---
I feel you there, i still use the plaid flannel addon to see where i blink, lucky they made it into a brown addon. Most of the times i pair it with addons that reduce my blink fatigue, but one of the green addons (i forgot the name) makes you move at normal killer speed for 60s but disables you blink ability for that time, if you blink hit a survivor, this might help, so you don't need to blink twice
---
Other than that i unfortunately can't help, i'm still learning to get the blink distances right
---
To be fair the plague was willing to cut off her own toes to save someone.
---
#ENOUGH.
---
Keyboards with their own software?  The future is crazy.
---
Nah fam, that's the killermain response after the devs nerf their beloved Spirit and they now have to actually put in effort for their 4ks
---
Ps4. Anyone else getting a jake with male pattern baldness while using the old jake head?
---
I picked Gas Heaven because it is a gas station, and gas station sells things, so I just thought of this as kinda of a cool idea to add, feel free to change it, maps, items, anything. The reason not the other maps is they don't really make sense for this, If they add a shop to every map then not just Gas Heaven.
---
Maybe she was drinking directly from a very full pitcher of lemonade.
---
Underrated comment
---
Trust me, there's not only three viable killers, you just can't play most of them. Sure, some seriously suck, but definitely not all but a few.
---
Please stop disconnecting. It ruins the game.
---
Where are y'all getting these omegablink Nurses everywhere? They were such a rare occurrence for me and I'm always sitting on purple/red rank survivor...
---
I find fixated pretty good too.  Drop the pallet early and use the extra movement speed while walking uninjured to gain distance while she tries to mindgame you.
---
I’d agree but 3 fragments per Ritual is just a big nope, I’d say make it either/or.
---
Can i buy one?
---
I said what I said. If you suck at your job you deserve to lose the game. It's like with survivors except the game's more forgiving for killers.
---
that isn't what is being talked about though. Why do you feel the need to inject, "but survivors too!" in a discussion about Nurse, and killers in general. I'm sure any level headed person can see issues this game has overall, but trying to downplay one just because another exists doesn't stop it from being a problem.
---
It was the game, and I was in a corner where we could see each other, it wasn't fair
---
Please point out to me every killer that’s able to go against a coordinated swf team and not get stomped outright.
---
but... there are 2 gates and a hatch.....
---
I mean I know “dcing” got very popular and is used as a “counter”  even though it’s not a counter lol. But stick with the match, sure you got put into a bad game or had a bad spawn which doesn’t always happen. 
---
But you have teammates that you are going to hurt as well. Nothing’s more annoying then someone dcing because something was unfair because it hurts everyone else in the game. 
---
It comes off as rude and selfish even if you didn’t mean to act that way. Especially when you play this game long enough you start to see how bad dcs affects everyone and even yourself.
---
Bill for borrowed then Nea for balanced or Feng for Lithe and Alert.
---
Or you could pull an epic gamer move and level Ace.
---
Imagine dcing against mirror myers lol
---
Don't be a bitch and play through it. You won't get any better without playing against a challenge. And how did you know he had a tombstone? Did you wait until the end or wait for him to kill someone?
---
I don't know, did I?
---
Don’t have her
---
Awww, how sweet
---
Yes, this build has a 50% chance of working. Actually, a higher chance of working because not all 4 survivors always go to the same gate. And sure, if someone finds the hatch then good on them.
---
This build isn't meant to get a 4K, it's just funny to watch them panic when they try to open a gate and your invisible body is there blocking the button.
---
Thrilling Tremors is already better than BBQ if you don't care about the BPs, though. It's not counterable by hiding in a locker or behind a gen, it prevents rotation for 16 seconds, and the cooldown is not significant.
---
You mean the nurse? Because as far as I'm aware the killers are not allowed to see eatchother
---
I want deep sea maps. The entity can dp whatever ot wants so why not maps on the ocean floor? Like if the water had all been drained out or something. Could be sunken ships, wall loops could be replaced by coral/ rock walls. That would be a very different experience
---
I love how posting anything anywhere on Reddit is sure to start something like this
---
Not counting down would be horrible. Decisive could last theoretically all game. Plus the problem that needs fixed is survivors abusing it and that makes it worse
---
But Claudette is a good botanist girl.
---
The archives are making me relate to Claudette too much
---
It’s also not fair to load in a match and have one of your teammates DC.
---
It’s also not fair to lose emblems and BBQ stacks because of DCing survivors.
---
Alright well I didn't instantly dc, but I was right next to the gate and he basically spawned right next to me. He already fully stalked me, and 2 minutes later he already killed 1 of my teammates, so there wasn't much I could do when he came back to me
---
Hey look, no comments
---
Yes it does. It can piss people off
---
It gives +25% BP to all *survivors* in the trial. Unlike the bloody party streamers, of the same rarity, which give +100% BP to all *players* in the trial.
---
Basically they're just shittier versions of bloody party streamers that are even shittier because they don't help the killer.
---
Finally someone sees the real issue with dbd.
---
Congratulations!!! You won: "            "
---
Stopped using the skin because of this
---
That’s not true at all wtf
---
Imagine complaining about the concept of survivors having something to do instead of gens though
---
Wait moving your camera lets survivors see you as Wraith? I thought that they can’t see you unless you’re walking.
---
PLEASE. I go against so many killers that run Dying Light and Ruin... They don't even kick gens, they rely solely on people being altruistic to find and kill people. 
---
At some point, we have to be altruistic. Gotta get those points.
---
Sorry I did not see all of these complaints until now. I did not have notifications turned on for this one because i thought no one was going to read it.
---
&gt;He's Clown / Doctor with more map pressure
---
-
---
&gt;Clown / Doctor have no map pressure
---
https://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Yourself-to-Read
---
But that doesn’t stop you from playing the game
---
Yeah they're taking the fall for someone else's mistake but they're forcing the killers hand. Not much you can do but just take advantage of the bad play
---
Yeah, that'd be nice.
---
If I got killed by this I couldn’t even be mad I would just find it simply funny lol.
---
Half the show is garbage.
---
The stories at the beginning with the creepy imagery is always somewhat interesting.
---
Killers dont just let you sit on the ground for the full 4 minutes unless they lost you
---
Oh really? I assumed they could see wraith looking around cloaked because when killers look around their entire bodies move.
---
So still, not only did you waste your own time, you've ruined the game for the other players
---
Yeah it does. If thats all you go against do you really wanna keep putting up with it? People have litterally stopped playing the game because of it
---
How are you meant to play her? I'm so fucking bad like it's actually not even funny anymore.
---
I may have not been entirely truthful, I didn't dc, just teabagged as he walked towards me
---
You have no idea what your talking about if you think "not kicking gens" means bad killer
---
How do u get that torso for Jake?
---
It still has a countdown, 30 seconds. But kinda like how deep wounds doesnt work in terror radius, they would have to loose them and leave them alone.
---
But if the killer still wants to tunnel the 30 seconds timer will pause and start again when they loose them or it'll restart when they down them. When downed being in the killer terror radius does not matter bc you are downed(duh)
---
Well they don't exist anymore.
---
I think this one wasn't bad hitbox, just delay to register the hit and the animation, because the claudette literally went in the direction of the hatchet.
---
If people (on both sides) weren’t so toxic, you’d say more variation in builds. Meme builds, for example, would be used more if players bothered to just fuck around more. But as it stands, the game is simply competitive at heart, so you’re going to see a lot of the same perks.
---
It’s the same thing in like CoD. You’re not gonna see somebody run around with a rocket launcher to mess around because why would they do that when they can use the best assault rifle and win? 
---
I hoped the Rift would offer more diverse play styles, but really, once you complete the challenge you just go back to your regular build. Honestly, I think Daily’s should be more like the rift challenges. Would spice things up at least a little bit.
---

I mean we have quite a bit of perks that can synergize off each other. (Card games rely on more synergy though, fun random fact)
---
Yes not everyone runs them but you will find that there’s special people that just play for fun (the best people). 
---
I don’t like perks that are made to synergize with another one to be good because then it feels bad by itself. I like perks that are good by itself and become even better when it has synergies.
---
I meant previous to the nerf...
---
The rift, idk wat tier
---
"Collect your reward!". Grinding for these is so hard but I 100% require everything.
---
Its impossible to make every killer top tier, doesn’t mean the game is unbalanced (just because of that)
---
No worries my friend. Definitely an SSD would solve a lot a problems. But what is curious is that you said you get those stutters when a game event happens. That kind of sounds like a CPU issue. The drive would be acting up when loading textures and such. But from the benchmarks I'm seeing the 8300h is no slouch, it should be able to handle DBD, so who knows.
---
You could try playing a match of DBD while running a CPU monitoring tool and when the stutter happens, see if CPU usage spikes to 100%. If that's the case, maybe there is something in the system you could disable for when you play to give the CPU some room to breathe.
---
There's like 15 different builds I've come up with that you can run, it's up to you if you only want to run meta perks.
---
As a Legion main I approve.
---
How come it's the worst add-on?
---
Sure, it isn't like the times where you could instantly repair a gen, but I can still use it just fine.
---
Already suggested a quasi rework for Legion here https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b4bmuh/legion_reworked/
---
However, I did like the sound of their original concept as said in an old dev stream: Legion can imitate a survivor  (mask is off at times during the trial so I guess this is Legion's version of stealth), can teleport to lockers and come out of them of them to cut off chases/surprise survivors, has a bat as a weapon.
---
If they did that, then I wouldn't mind a complete overhaul of Legion as I think it sounds really good/viable. This is BHVR though so.. it could just as likely end up being ass. But we'll see.
---
It’s hard to create a bunch of different lighting settings for every map
---
I'm just learning to play Legion and this is really useful, thank you!
---
No, you're not reading auras with spine chill.
---
Now if they can only do something about my boy wraith, he needs some loving
---
Three DCs, you feel bad, you let the last guy go, “entity displeased”
---
Tru3 actually did a thing on this. Basically when you get the 'slow vault' ( don't hit the right angles), there's a delay in your hit box moving, leaving about a second for the killer to hit you, even though your survivor is out of range.
---
We're noticing it more now with the dedicated servers. It blows.
---
PC: Dead hard not working half the time with dedicated servers and doesnt give you your exhaustion back when downed through it. Also, lobbies for survivors kick you after a couple games saying "unknown error."
---
So you weren't decent with him and that's why you think he's bad. Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
Honestly, I wouldn't mind a doubled-up mode. 8 Survivors vs 2 Killers.
---
Pls nerf freddy he is too op 😱😢
---
I wonder, didn't try my hand at Nurse after rework but also didn't find a single Nurse until now while playing survivor on red ranks (and I mean it).  
---
I think they should have kept her base power instead of shifting everyone's mains to Spirit, I'd appreciate more diversity instead of the opposite of that.
---
Legions frenzy should still be able to down survivors
---
Those perks definitely synergize well, but they're still really niche...like, could you see people choosing to use those builds over what they're using now? I guess I'm just hoping for strong perks that don't have much niche to it, but instead do great when paired with one another.
---
1
---
Legion right now is one of the most unique and fun killers, although he’s bad
---
So you're the reason every spirit has prayer beads.
---
Okay maybe the ultra rare flashlight add-on is worse. 
---
Point is, of course you can still *use* it but it’s barely even worth it. It went from extremely dumb insta-gen, to skill-check hitting a gen until finish for about 20 seconds, to giving you a 15-25% headstart on a gen. When you compare its significance to insta-heal and killer ultra rares, it is not on par anymore.
---
I’d like to see the same difficulties in skill checks as now, but up until at least 50% again.
---
Yeah 3rd or 4th best right now. Definitely strong and viable.
---
That's so weird
---
Don't even run to the hook when in the chase. Run to the other side of the map preferably with finished gens.
---
On...nurse?????
---
But I didn’t slow vault
---
This would go so well with a scooby doo themed chapter.
---
The villain could be the deep sea diver from the episode Get a Clue Scooby Doo.
---
Please make the scooby doo dream reality
---
This is the height of entitlement man.  Killers are entitled to 4K's now because of mandatory 3rd man slugs?  This is absurd man.  All I'm asking is for them to  kill their 3rd and close the hatch like the devs intended when they reworked egc.
---
Susie is a QT.
---
Yeah I usually avoid using it as a Killer because I know it's a pain for Survivors to deal with.  At the same time, there are games where I kind of wish I did use it because you'll have those sweaty Survivors who get 2-3 gens done by the time you down one Survivor and I might get my full BBQ stacks by the time the doors are up or I might not.
---
Unfortunately Ruin is basically a crutch perk right now because it's easy to get multiple gens up within the first few minutes of a game and it directly affects the Killer's Gatekeeper emblem score.
---
Yeah, which is why i commented that the pumpkin one is better?
---
To english:
---
They are in the lockers, Johnny!  They are in the lockers!
---
did it work for you?
---
Tell me about it.
---
I'm green rank, and I just got Freddy last week. Tried taking him into a match, and got crushed by red ranks, and told to uninstall because I only got 1k
---
A lot of the issues could be mitigated with teachables, link to a few builds below if you like.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/811ey2/your_favoritebest_huntress_build/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Chases and looping will certainly get better with practice. Exactly the same as looping and stunning the killer as survivor.
---
Now, as far as I have been told, queue times get a bit better as you descend the ranks. Annoying to deal with for sure but with the right combo killer games are fun as hell.
---
*Laughs in macros*
---
*Laughs in macro*
---
Entity takes advantage of evil and vulnerable people
---
True. It could take 80 hours or more for some but I do agree. Even terrible players can get into red ranks by playing enough each month.
---
Doin gens, you?
---
I feel like this would nerf her way too bad... sounds good in theory but would give survivors a guaranteed pallet or window in closed areas
---
Except for like, newer killer players and Legions/Wraiths/Clowns, anyone who knows their kit can control a team. When the perks alone let you keep pressure on, your abilities are almost second place to the sheer power your perks have.
---
All i can say its useful is for a scratched mirror myers
---
I can kind of understand that too. Exclusion and isolation are pretty hard to deal with and can lead to a lot of frustration and self loathing that gets vented out at others who have nothing to do with it.
---
It feels like playing Amnesia, where you can't look at the Killer or you go insane. Definitely a useful perk, although anxiety-inducing.
---
#CEASE
---
Descend ? Like going from Rank 20 to 10 ? That would be hard as I am always losing.
---
Playing the killer is and will never be fun to me.
---
Plus I have none of these perks, so thanks.
---
Not anymore. Stealth abilities actually work against it now (thankfully).
---
Just use Mouse Wheel Down SMH
---
Other way around when im playing legion
---
Poor game design? I think you meant survivors that’s don’t understand they aren’t supposed to escape every game.
---
Always respect the pebble.
---
Please be Pyramid Head or Terminator 🤞🏻
---
Mission failed successfully.
---
Just an empty room nothing in it but 5 gens 5 totems, 7 hooks and, not a cellphone just 5 players living in the moment.
---
I honestly don't know. Maybe? If it did it wasn't hugely noticible.
---
The idea is, he's supposed to be good at eberytbing, but great at nothing. He's got decent map control, decent attacks, and decent awareness, but none of it is as extreme as the peeps who specialize.
---
I'm drunk at the moment, maybe I drank too much during struggle phase, or maybe I just went out with my friends. Who knows
---
Because she's one of the most (if not the most) popular Survivor and the stereotypical Claudette player isn't that bright until they're P3.  In which case they're usually cocky.
---
Good thing more challenges are coming before the rift closes...
---
ok
---
What rank killer?
---
This clip is brighter than my future
---
happened the exact same to me
---
Did you get shadowbanned or something? I can click your profile and see the reply but I can't actually see it in this post. Anyways I don't care what you think, you are obviously an idiot.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Just suprising with how many hours I've put in.
---
I mean, it will force them to drop a pallet or use window. 
---
Of course some numbers can be changed, but it the general idea: give survivors a moment to react to her new position. Forgot to mention, the are seeing only her husk, so from survivors perspective, she stops for a few seconds and goes in their (or not) direction at an INSANE speed, covering all distance spirit traveled while in sprit world in a few seconds. Going to add this to original post.
---
bUy pReMiUm
---
Sauce?
---
I've gotten more hate mail in this game than any other, 99% from salty Survivor mains.
---
This is something I have to try lol
---
Why is your clown crying
---
This is how I know none of you play red ranks. I have yet to find any survivor or killer in red rank that disagrees the nerf went way too far. There is way too much forgiveness against Nurse now. She went from a killer you can’t make any mistake against at all to a killer where you can make far too many mistakes and still come out on top.
---
hahahahahahahahah this is so false it's funny
---
Why is this marked NSFW?
---
Actually yes it does. It does a LOT
---
So is the glowing orange stuff magma or some mysterious liquid?
---
no. you got it completely wrong my guy.
---
No Mither just causes you to be Broken as if a Plague has you fully Infected. However being Broken and being Infected are two totally different states. If a Plague wanted to Infect a No Mither survivor and gain any benefits that would bring she'd still need to vomit on them, and if a No Mither cleanses at a Fountain they remain Broken, it doesn't heal them and they simply remove the Infection.
---
No. A killer who is purely dedicated to slugging/being an asshole isn't always going to happen. I am not wasting a perk slot because people want to abuse game mechanics.
---
Not sure.  I have [this keyboard](https://www.ebay.com/p/1724649594?iid=264416500676&amp;chn=ps&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;itemid=264416500676&amp;targetid=537215867968&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9029855&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=6470648147&amp;mkgroupid=74956728902&amp;rlsatarget=pla-537215867968&amp;abcId=1139336&amp;merchantid=113600634&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzIyi-6je5QIVj8VkCh3xhQ_4EAQYASABEgLGN_D_BwE).

Whenever I build a new computer, I keep using the old peripherals.  My three-year-old machine, with an i7 6700k, GTX 1080, and 32GB DDR4-3200, is powering my 1600x900 monitor.
---
It really depends on your teams play style. Don't cleanse, and she one-shot downs you if she finds/catches you. 
---
But, cleanse, and her puke does damage, and gives her range, making it much easier to hit you, even if she does have to do it twice.
---
Badically, if you're good at outrunning/mind gaming/ looping, than don't cleanse. It makes it easier for her to hit you.
---
If you duck at those three things, you should cleanse because you're probably gonna get hit anyways.
---
Whoever downvoted this just hops onto the bandwagon
---
20
---
Tell us then, its so easy to say that and not suggest anything that would fit the games lore, be balanced, be fun to play, be appealing to everyone, actually possible to get into the game ect...
---
They aren't if the killer knows how to turn his camera; with both visual and audio cues before they go off, anyone aside from people brand new to the game can easily avoid it.
---
You have to remember that 4 other people queued for a good 5-10 mins to get into a game just for it to end by people like you. I don't DC because it isn't fair on the other 4 people. Even if I get camped, or tunneled or survivors bring insta heals or bnps I stay so they get something out of that match
---
Google “Autohotkey” and one of the most popular scripts available for it is an autoclicker/autotapper. Don’t need to write it yourself, though you can if so inclined. Bind it to an f key or like O and then you’ll forget to turn it on and feel real dumb when you die.
---
Alternatively: "How the fuck did that not hit them?"
---
I got to actually see myself on some random guy's little stream a week or so ago where I was basically repeatedly failing to make lunges that looked like they should've landed and barely missed at best.  On his end I was apparently lunging from a mile away and never got close to him.
---
Then there's the times where Survivors are able to like, magically snap and change the direction they're running in without warning as if the server only recorded like a fraction of their movements.
---
Then what really makes me salty is when I use Dead Hard, get Exhausted, and yet the server decided that I was hit before I used it.
---
David and shirt off.
---
The game just glitched it means nothing
---
TFW you play spirit and still almost don’t 4K 🥴
---
I would much, much rather have weaker killers buffed. Spirit isn’t highly played because she’s amazing, it’s because in perspective, she’s so much better than half of the roster. A good spirit can still get gen rushed and have 4 escape by a SWF.
---
Gnarly. First time it ever hit me. I had seen speed hacking videos and it looked remarkably similar.
---
I'll be on the lookout for it in the future.
---
People don´t like mending and team mates that heal every time they get hit can screw the rest of the party, kinda like plague cleansing. That´s what the person who sd´d on hook told me though so  🤷
---
Buying tiers is not overpriced you must be new to the whole BP thing. $1 per tier is the norm, some games charge more
