Happy cake day!

---
---
Because I didn't know he was following me till I turned the camera while opening the locker..
---
Reminds me of eustace from courage the cowardly dog in that one episode.
---
As Doc Main I gotta love that Doc looking HUGE, freaking awesome.
---
Gotta love the anime sneer in the last panel
---
I mean, have you ever tried to learn him or just follow the "Freddy Bad" meme?
---
Or they could play both butttt don‚Äôt listen to me tho
---
He is coming in the next patch, we don't have him yet, if he isn't in the next patch for some reason he is in the Freddy rework probably.
---
Claudette only has botany knowledge which I still wouldn‚Äôt run she‚Äôs B
---
If I could have anyone as a survivor I would want Dustin and I want him to say one line zingers like Ash. If their is a hangup because he is a kid and we can't see him hooked then give me Steve with the sailor outfit as an additional cosmetic. It would probably be Hopper or Joyce they went with though. 
---

---
To this day I still don't get people's obsession with Barb she was such a nothing character for me. She was there to advance the story and give us a death that was close to the main group but not one of them. Basically the same reason Bob was added to the mix in season 2 but he at least did more.
---
lol
---
Bubba's my bitch.
---
Its cool, I understand that you may be frustrated with my opinion. Originally, Jake was in the same tier as Tapp, but Calm Spirit is situational and ever so slightly hinders you since it shortens your time on the hook since you don't go through the screaming animation when hooked, and saboteur is kinda mediocre in my opinion. Thus, Jake is C tier in my eyes.
---
Luckily don't have too many worst: when two SWF boxed me in a corner until the killer found us because of all the crows.  
---
Best: when me and another person were able to save a hooked survivor from a camping Leatherface with no Borrowed Time thanks to Kindred, a chainsaw cooldown, and an opened gate with a window in front of it.
---
I hate going against a good nurse or Billy with ruin. It is borderline unfair. I will usually work through ruin with any other killer. They are just too quick. Anyway, I am salty too üëçüèªüòÑ
---
Saw is easily the most lenient of the licensed franchises. Along with Leatherface.
---
Ghostface legit only gets the mask with no survivors and map.
---
Leatherface gets to wear the faces of survivors.
---
Piggy and Tapp get a map and 3 outfits each
---
[Following the 3.0.0 update, many people experienced longer than normal Killer queue times. In short, the longer queue times were caused by an abnormally large number of players playing as Killer, resulting in not enough Survivors to fill their lobbies. While queue times are expected to be longer when a new chapter launches, it seems to be exacerbated when a Killer is not accompanied by a Survivor. Additionally, the Bloodhunt and subsequent Anniversary Celebration appears to have caused more people to switch sides to maximize their bloodpoint earning. We will keep these factors in mind as we move forward.]
---
Plus the main reason you had so many people playing killer across all platforms was the DBP event, then to top it the celebration cakes were spawning 2-4 per blood web on the killer side. Then on the survivor blood webs, I would get 1 every other blood web sometimes or go 3 blood webs with none! So where do you think people were gonna play? Not rocket science... it should have been balanced...
---
Getting tunneled was like 4 bnps in their prime.
---
i like this. Its one of those seemingly small changes that do everything
---
Seriously this. Pls no. Consoles is much better at killer diversity than PC, I'd hate to have nurse takeover like PC.
---
Distortion is kinda situational, and even though 90% of killers run BBQ, you can counter it far easier by going into a locker for a few seconds than using a perk slot, and Breakdown would be good if it weren't for the fact that hooks are so close to each other that even if you break the hook and get downed right there next to it, he will still be able to bring you to a different one in time. Aftercare, while good, does not counter his other two perks to bring up to a higher tier.
---
Let's all be honest Jane really is DBDs ass!
---
There's actually no way a rank 1 hag is that oblivious. She even bumped into you for a long time and thought nothing of it.
---
I mean, this is the first time I can recall seeing his bitties. Lol.
---
Lol stealth killers
---
GG to the cloaked wraith
---
Figured as much.
---
I'm also thinking of Empathy, which is great since it lets you know where injured teammates are and let you know they are most likely being chased, and self care, which I find not to be top tier, but pretty decent.
---
Did they add 2 killer mode
---
I hope you reported them. That kinda shit just pisses me off.
---
Freddy being bad is not a meme lmao. Freddy being GOOD is a meme. And yes, I've played plenty of Freddy. It's not impossible to do well with him, but he is consistently the worst killer. Unless you play at rank 20.
---
Yeah. I feel like the hatch will always be a shitty mechanic.
---
I will. I still have his name in my messages.
---
Stefan was honestly being so amazing when he‚Äôd start to stutter or freeze up. He‚Äôd stare at him and smile and agree with him to try to encourage him a bit. It was honestly so wholesome lol
---
That's isn't lag switching, it's just lag.
---
My main problem is that survivors weren't supposed to be communicating with each other during a match because it was too powerful, but they let it happen anyway.
---
I hope they remember to allow you to mori the husk then, instead of only sacrifice it.
---
Well, I'm a Dwight main, so I'm a little biased. However, In my list, A tier is the survivors that have two perks I would actually use in game, and I love bond and prove thyself, and they always slip into my perk layout for normal games.
---
Your gonna put crow notifications on these "husks" right?
---
Herman is a good teacher.
---
sounds like a lag switch
---
Did you cook ‚Äúsurvivor pudding‚Äù with that?
---
Amazing
---
Yeah, cleansing totems is great but that doesn't make the perk not frustrating to play against. What justifiable reason is there for NOED to not notify survivors that they are exposed when Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice and Rancor all do? Give me one reason how adding a totem counter to Small Game would negatively affect the game instead of giving survivors an optional way of becoming more self reliant and providing another viable alternative to the same survivor perks we see every game. Give me one reason why one of the effects from NOED, one of the post commonly used killer perks in the game, shouldn't instead be moved to a perk that should fulfill a similar niche, but see almost no play at all.
---
I mean if everyone hit skill checks every time there wouldn't be a point in having skill checks. Though missing them on purpose makes you a shitty teammate in my opinion.
---
My hero.
---
I assume hard is hiding in a locker, what's the soft?
---
Yeah if you insidious camp the hook like most of them
---
I'm with you, I consistently do well as him now in purple ranks. I love him as is. I'd be more fine with the rework if the sleeping wasn't automatic
---
? you can just ignore the rank 2
---
So survivor mains are trashy and should play both but killer mains get a free pass? 
---
No wonder you got downvoted
---
Imagine being able to use lockers to connect to the Upside Down, a sort of hellish Freddy-esque nightmare/dreamscape where the Demogorgon gets enhanced movement speed, but can't interact with survivors until it utilizes another locker. Add in some sort of visual/sound cue when the Demogorgon is near and/or using lockers that survivors can see, but suppress the Demogorgon's red stain/terror radius for a short time when exiting/entering lockers, and I think that would be both a fun Killer to play as well as a great Killer to play against.
---
Why does leatherface need to camp? I played hin using a bone splinter offering and i get 4 kills 90% of the time
---
The small indie company excuse doesn‚Äôt work after your game blows up and you‚Äôre talking about that at an anniversary.
---
He's okay up to green ranks
---
Lag-Switch from the sounds of it. That's usually what it's like when someone uses one. You'll be playing the game as usual but you won't be able to interact with anything. Game freezes and abra-cadabra. You're on a hook.
---
Time to save shards
---
Wait, so is everyone who already had his perks still gonna have them?
---
*sad bing bong noises*
---
YEAYGDABHYUWIDA

---
I‚Äôm personally looking forward to my new sleepy time overlord. This rework makes him look like he‚Äôs got a lot more control of the dream world rather than just living there.
---
As a programmer idk how this feature is not "automatically" set. Like, if you just call the scream that the doc's shock produces when you step on a trap then Calm Spirit should work without you even thinking about it.
---
Literally just had this happen. It's a garbage tactic for garbage people.
---
But a totem counter wouldn't have an effect on swf. What would be the point of having a counter telling you how many totems have been cleansed if you can already figure that out through communication with one's team? The only thing a counter would do is give solo survivors access to one of the many advantages that swf has always had, but still doesn't provide any mechanical advantages that Small Game doesn't already. A solo survivor with Small Game with a totem counter shouldn't be any more powerful than a swf survivor running Small Game now.
---
The Pussyface
---
It works against her bevause most Spirits I notice play the mindgame. Survivors that run away from a loop is much better if the Spirit just stands there letting them gain distance.
---
On short obstacle loops if you are running a flashlight then you can flashlight a Spirit if she stands still. Spirit cannot see obviously denying her information but she also cannot enter phase walk. You can also force a Spirit out of phase walk if you throw a cracker or flashlight blind her. When I've done it, it has always been successful because they don't expect it.
---
Running Iron Will and Spine Chill alongside the flashlight allows survivors to chase Spirit for long periods of time if she is playing more passive/mindgames.
---
Attempting to run from a Spirit that plays very aggressive is much more difficult. An aggressive Spirit running Bloody Hair Brooch and Wakizashi Saya will get quick downs unless the survivor can pick up on how the Spirit plays quickly and knows how to abuse scratch marks.
---
New nightmare Freddy fucking wen
---
Isn't Claudette around 20 anyway? She is a college student.
---
Fake EVERYTHING.
---
Fake Pallets.
---
Fake windows.
---
Fake chests.
---
Fake generators.
---
Even fake survivor illusions.
---
You know,  you're asleep and you run to the nearest generator to get someone to heal you and then they just fade away with a freddy laugh.
---
I downvoted you for
---
That
---
I watched gaming grizzly show me how to do it. Anyways you‚Äôll get used to where to move the joystick in order to walk, so it‚Äôs not a problem after a couple levels
---
I can see this going one of two ways:
---
Either have to get some custom content to make them actually match the killers.
---
OR!!!
---
Approach it as more of a conceptual project. If the Killers were Sims/People, how would they look? Kind of similar to Disney Bounding (where people wear clothes that are inspired by Disney characters). So Huntress could have cute bunny clothes on, Wraith could just be dark and gloomy with a hood and barefoot all the time, etc.
---
The day has finally come.  Time to dust off my P3 Freddy.
---
Too bad it doesn't stack with autodidact
---
I would've shit myselfüòÇ
---
He didn't fit the stealth killer theme
---
Does m&amp;a affect the distance at which you can be seen? And does nurses work in conjunction with survivors waking up another
---
They don't know any better, I guess.
---
So what you‚Äôre really saying is OP should make Nea
---
Michael Myers.
---
It‚Äôs so satisfying chasing a healthy survivor, tapping the ability button (after charging it to 99%) and downing them in one hit.
---
scp-096 with a paper bag over its head
---
Yeah of course no one likes Bubba, they all just facecamp  you
---
I'm with you. I wish they just kept both versions or made this rework a new killer.
---
how dare you destroying Amanda's hooks?
---
It only decreases if you start a match with 2-3 survivors. If they DC during the trial, your screwed. You don‚Äôt see the decreased gens as often anymore because they stop the trial from starting if someone DCs during the loading screen
---
Make it. Get that sick 3K karma. Don't let it be an idea.
---
I assume the wraith is standing in front of the survivor with a dumb look on his face and a beer in his hand
---
How do you download it?
---
Same bro! Every two weeks!
---
he is a pretty big boi especially compared to two of the diddyest ones xD
---
It would give even more security to ensuring noed is gone. Small game is fine how it is anyway.
---
When the p3 Claudette keeps dropping pallets on your ass so you say fuck it and reveal your true power.
---
Levelling Claudette for self-care (level 40) is a worthwhile investment.
---
Other worthwhile perks are:
---
Adrenaline (Meg)
---
Sprint Burst (Meg)
---
Borrowed Time (Bill)
---
Lithe (Feng Min)
---
Balanced Landing (Nea)
---
Decisive Strike (Laurie)
---
These are a few pretty good perks that come to mind as worth unlocking. I‚Äôve definitely missed a lot so if anyone would like to add, feel free :)
---
Sometimes I walk to fix a generator as killer because I've forgotten that I swapped roles.
---
They also mentioned they would never add a clown killer.
---
her name is literally lisa sherwood...
---
Don‚Äôt use self care all I can suggest.
---
Yeah what the other guy said if the right conditions are met you can actually glitch past the (goal wall) if you run back into it you'll fully escape
---
Looks really good man
---
Are you using a speed perk? Maybe the perks you are running dont match your play style
---
and doctor because they scream like in madness.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Briliant!
---
Woooosh.
---
Hatch king
---
Bubba is personally one of my favorite killers
---
Get it on your phone it‚Äôs free to play on android and iPhone.
---
I'd like to see doctor and the new Freddy for some crazy fake pallets
---
Louder for the people in the back!
---
You made this? Awesome work!
---
Turning on Vacuum Cleaner
---
I mean, I would imagine so unless they‚Äôre just bookmarking every post in a catalog to point someone out.
---
How come?
---
It‚Äôs all those tutorials you did
---
Distortion.
---
I think I may run dead hard over sprint burst but I‚Äôll try both out
---
+1
---
I like this
---
The 360‚Äôs were fine but the moonwalking was toxic. It‚Äôs ok to be good, it‚Äôs not ok to be a dick.
---
That's fucking awesome
---
did not make it the artist is in the bottom left
---
Still doing the console war thing, what're you 14?
---
Also stopping SWF from playing with the person too is extra nice. I have friends who do that periodically and they‚Äôd always justify it with some bs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not letting them get points‚Äù or some dumb nonsense. Well now not only do you still give the killer points, but you give me points AND I don‚Äôt have to play with you for a bit so you can go calm down! Win, freaking, win.
---
Tapp in b tier is just a sin
---
OP knew this shit wouldn‚Äôt fly and even made an ALT just to beg. It‚Äôs pathetic man, I see posts like these all the time and it pisses me the fuck off. I‚Äôve had to work my ass off for everything that I own. I‚Äôm not giving some random the fruits of my fucking labor. Fuck them.
---
That's what happens when you play shitty killers.
---
I play both, just that in turn makes me extremely mediocre and both.
---
that is true. the only thing I'm worried about is killers forcing survivors to dc lol. but we will have to wait and see
---
I would go with Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, and Borrowed Time
---
How is that being toxic? It‚Äôs not even a dick move?
---
But I oink!!!
---
My question is dead hard and balanced landing are both exhaustion perks wouldn‚Äôt that cancel each other out?
---
This. It's not fair survivors best XP perk does nothing to actually contribute to the entire team. I just want something minor.
---
No, not OP at all. What rank are you?
---
*Freddy then 106's out the ground next to a generator*
---
**MULIPLE EUCLID AND KETER LEVEL CONTAINMENT BREACHES, FULL SITE LOCKDOWN INITIATED**

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Thank You
---
Also walking one way then running the other and running into the killers terror radius.
---
Is this what it looks like when the Entity feels like being generous
---
Yeah, leave noob you cunt
---
Yah, I have seen it on all maps and it doesn‚Äôt matter what the killer is, I know at a certain distance you can‚Äôt see them anymore. But a big problem and ever since the 3.0.2 patch dropped, PS4 btw. Also have had killers message me saying they are just going easy because they can see all of us while playing survivor. But I‚Äôve noticed others find you quick with no aids from specific perks.
---
Also "hag" is given to old women often lol mostly as an unsult
---
Legion is probably the worst killer rn, dont even know if i could consider leatherface worse
---
Doing this ASAP thank you
---
Couch face more like it
---
These people exist?
---
More than you think, there is hope my friend/
---
Awwwwüò≠üò≠üòçüòç

Right?!?!? :D
---
No hope when im on consol :'(
---
Left for Dead
---
oof do not worry citizen, bill is coming
---
Sounds like Lag Switch but without video there is no way too know for sure, since he could of been a little laggy then a big spike happened and then this happened.
---
Good job!    
---
This reminds me I‚Äôve got a Kate halfway designed in sims 4 to go with my custom Feng Min
---
I cant get DbD on steam so this literally couldnt happen to me, but it's honestly so sweet knowing theres still good in this community.
---
Fucking FINALLY
---
Yes true
---
Ahhh I see, I was a kid when I played them so I don‚Äôt remember him, thank you
---
I'm Xbox too dude neither is better ffs grow up
---
It genuinely baffles me that people will defend him this much.
---
Killers whose powers don't affect a chase are already well known to be average or lower at best, then to have one whose power actively hinders chases, and prevents survivors from getting hit for a fairly noticeable portion of the gameplay, is quite obviously going to be F tier.
---
But hey, "I'm a pro freddy main, he's op, now that he is finally getting a rework I can go against everyone to be the cool and epic veteran, who plays the non-meta character".
---
Same shit happened in League, gangplank, mordekaiser, swain, etc, I played them all, and loved them even more after their rework(s), but everyone suddenly mained those characters were getting improved, and of course they didn't like it.
---
oof but yeah it made me feel sooo happy lmao
---
I love this communities use of Joni‚Äôs bizarre adventure, it‚Äôs noice to see something that successfully bridges the gap between survivor and killer
---
Bill is coming to consoles and I'm so damn excited.
---
Meta perk, meta perk, meta perk, and meta perk. Yup, seems like most survivor builds, as usual.
---
This is amazing
---
I just hope he's strong enough.
---
They said if you unlocked any of bill‚Äôs perks you get to keep them, however, when he gets released you‚Äôll have to get them as teachables for the survivors who don‚Äôt have it.
---
The aura reading was extremely unfun to play against and I won‚Äôt miss that tbh, because it meant you can‚Äôt hide from Freddy and stealth was useless
---
Welp now I have to do a Dwight vid with the differences I'm thinking of.
---
Thanks for the tip I never thought of that honestly! And that was good of the killer but sadly I timed out and died :(
---
Get good in.

Meme

Review
---
I am one to mash the spacebar while screaming
---
As a Jake main, I agree with his placement. The only perk he has that's worth a damn is Iron Will. Though a SWF running Sabo can be super fun. Had a killer call my team "toxic cunts" after a game once. Three man swf. Two of us had Sabo. The third guy was clueless and had no clue why we were called toxic. Lmao
---
Dude obviously there were two killers :/
---
I like where they are going, but on paper he isn‚Äôt nearly as powerful as hillbilly which is where he needs to be imo.  We‚Äôll see on the ptb though
---
Username checks out.
---
Idk doctor shouldn‚Äôt be teaching that course, he needs to work on his degree first
---
What about the killers?
---
lol why would anyone leave for death garden?
---
I bet he was 99% done stalking you :(
---
How is being chased fun? It's terrifying! Leave me at peace with my gens any day of the week.
---
That fake survivor illusion sounds pretty fun I ain't gonna lie
---
Why is this the best meme format lately? I love this, thank you.
---
New guy was probably like "Fuck me, I just want to get back to fixing this game and not feed my ego."
---
Yeah fuck that place, they edited out the watermark that is on the gen
---
"Why do I gotta be Mr Pink?"
---
Why...why did they take away my wall hacks! That‚Äôs what made him fun for me!
---
What is your sensitivity?
---
let me jump to the convo a little bit
---
Freddy is the worst killer when played as a basic m1 killer
---
If you think about it, the aura reading and generator slow down gives you a lot of information and stalling abillities
---
When you put multiple survivors asleep, your map awareness and generator pressure increases significantly
---
He's also invisble to non sleepers, making it easy to approach to survivors
---
The dream transition also can get you many free hits.
---
Killers like Leatherface and Wraith lack stalling and chase powers (well, freddy does lack chase abillities too, but his small height can make things easier), making them the actual worst killers
---
Agree i love the movie, he feels stronger when you get altruistic teams and a basement hook haha.
---
Sure, its always been that way. Why should they decrease it mid-game would n't make any sense.
---
BUT I never saw a decreases generator start even though I had DOZENs of games lately where we started with only 3 survivors. I think whatever they changed, most DC's now occur after the loading screen. Before most people did disconnected even before hence the game registered it and counted it.  
---
Now I think they dc right after start and the game doesnt change the gens, therefore you still start with 5 gens to do even you start the game with 3 or 2 survivors!
---
Normally, a killer is at the mercy of competent survivors. While they may be faster on open ground, they aren‚Äôt faster enough enough to not make most obstacles strongly survivor sided, especially considering their much poorer camera. If a surv just camps at a pallet, there‚Äôs nothing you can do but lunge and hope they miss the timing. Every time they end up on the opposite side of a wall or down pallet is a time where any move the killer makes is the wrong one.
---
Nurse flips this script on them. By ignoring map geometry, she takes away what makes survivors powerful: the ability to much more effectively react to what the killer does. Being able to pop up right next to survivor without passing the space between gives no reaction.
---
To demonstrate: 
---
Normal killer vs dropped pallet:The killer breaks it, surv sees that and start running to the next one, with a head start usually large enough to make it. Or Killer tries to go around, they can see that too and just vault over the pallet (most of which are safe enough to not risk them getting hit while doing so). 
---
Against a Nurse or Spirit: the survivor stands watching the killer for a moment when the killer suddenly pop up right next to them without much warning and get a hit. Yes, this is preceded by a couple seconds of standing still, but the survivor has almost no indication as to what is about to happen. Nurse might be blinking to her own feet, and Spirit might be standing still, or the Nurse could be aiming right behind you, and the spirit is haunting over to you.
---
That‚Äôs why those two are considered the most powerful killers: they take the survivors usually perfect ability to predict and control the terms of a chase, and instead swap it for a complicated mind game where they need to make shots in the dark.
---
lol 7 second fedora man bad amirite
---
Honestly though, I do better without corrupt purge.
---
you get stuck at 60fps if its on
---
Well with that, i think you should use dead hard, adrenaline, balanced landing, and Sprint burst.
---
all he needed was base kit class photo üòî
---
Report this guy. Obviously isn‚Äôt his art. He‚Äôs even making profit off of it too. Pathetic. This is punishable by copyright laws.
---
Some players just be like that, leave it to their damaged egos to use any reason/excuse to make their loss look unfair
---
You're in his world bitch
---
This is me. When I tried to be a good teammate and cleanse a pesky hex ruin. Whelp, it was Haunted Grounds. And the next thing I know all my teammates are in the basement üò±
---
Not that great hag was a bot
---
You're one of the good ones .
---
self care wastes too much time. It can be a decent perk in some situations, but it is way too situational
---
Quentin should be the worst.
---
If someone disconnects while loading into a game, the entire match gets cancelled. There should be 0 games starting with less than 4 people in it.
---
it's not a whole lotta work tho, obviously, this is all hope at the moment but once we get good official servers and they fix a lot of the needed to be fixed bugs and glitches this is definitely something I want in the game and won't be a huge amount of work, just some tweaking here and there but the main components are already in the game.
---
Seems fine to me he actually seems even more like Freddy now tbh all we are  missing is a trench coat cosmetic and Robert Euglund voicing him
---
The antics that go into faking out and/or hiding from a killer are hilarious and comical aswell as fun to learn for me. I also get to play with friends and strategize on when and how to do certain objectives and such, which is half of why SWF is so strong. Killer is really fun for me too, just a different kind of antics and more action packed.
---
That's sweet, I wish everyone was this nice
---
Insidious + P3 + Leatherface = Not So Natural Camouflage. 
---
Claudette mains are shook!
---
Don't forget Kobe and Deliverance. I know there's the wasted time argument but as Killer I hardly care.
---
Power: I'm sorry john
---
That was my bad, forreal. Sorry
---
M&amp;A with Red Painted Brush was soooo good for jumpscares
---
yeah so the gens wont get done quickly then  :&lt;
---
If you‚Äôre talking about wiggling while being carried, they‚Äôre adding it as a way to get BPs!
---
I also had this glitch. The name of the map was stuck on the bottom left the whole time so I also couldn‚Äôt see my teammates or whether they were hurt or not. I got no prompts for any actions, no visual skill checks, no perks on the bottom right, no progress bars for repairing or healing, etc. I had to tap to repair gens and self care bc of the lack of skill checks - tried my best to guess and hit them a few times and realized that wasn‚Äôt going to work. Then I got stuck in a tree and my whole game crashed. Super fun.
---
Laughs in Tommy Jarvis
---
I dunno, but Tyde's been playing a ton of it and seeming a lot less frustrated by it than he is by DbD - getting burnt out on Smite was one of the things that got him into this game in the first place, so I'm thinking it's a cyclical cynicism thing
---
Wait, is he really?
---
Rip
---
Sick, thanks !
---
Meg. Dwight. Jeff. Nea. 
---
In that order. Can‚Äôt change my kind assuming you have to use all 3.
---
I mainly play killer but survivor has its moments. It's also far less stressful and can be a chill time.
---
Best thing is that you don't have to play a bs survivor game and can leave and reque quickly. With killer and their ques you're committed.
---
I think these all sound awesome and as a Freddy main I look forward to playing as this new Freddy. But my biggest thoughts are that the micro-sleep will get a fast rework shortly after the rework update. Auto-sleeping after 60secs could be annoying early game. The other thing I see quickly getting reworked (and others in the comments I see mentioning this too) is his teleport power growing weaker as the game progresses and he has fewer generators to teleport to and gates opened.
---
As is though, it can make sense. Freddy has the advantage early game and survivors have it late game. In my opinion, it should be the other way around. Or even whole game, no one side with such distinct advantages over the other.
---
Sorry wasn't clear. It is free. But there is three main free Wi-Fi I use. McDonald's WiFi (The strongest) My Work which is Walmart (very close but a bit slower) and The library (which has the slowish, like can't even download 500 mbs in 20 minutes slow)
---
And that‚Äôs why I run kindred
---
Do people not like it? It looks like they did freddy good. Functioning like a normal killer but much stronger in the dream world instead of his ability just making him allowed to chase survivors
---
The comment on that meme is also amazing (not my work) https://m.imgur.com/mBpECih
---
Replace m&amp;a with ghosts obsession perk, it's amazing. 8m terror radius while in chase.

Ahhh, yes. I had a match with a super toxic nea swf who just spent the whole match pissing the killer off. I found the hatch just as the last one of them was hooked across the map. At first I thought they were going to kill themselves cause they used their three attempts. But then they stayed and struggled. Well killer had BBQ and came right for me and so I'm trying to play ring around the killer shack and I'm just trying to wait it out cause I knew going for her would end up with one of us back on the hook. Finally she gives up but I get downed trying to vault into the shack. Worst part is killer made me crawl to the hatch before using his Cypress Mori on me.
---
This is a literal SCP shitposthow the fuck was this unexpected
---
Hope your next four survivors decisive strike you in the face.
---
This is honestly a fantastic analogy.
---
I actually liked playing as stall Freddy.
---
Have you considered that hill Billy and nurse are the ones who needs changing?
---
yuppers!
---
Yes but if any photo gets out at all, or someone sees him and somehow manages to get out of the facility then he could literally kill thousands
---
right?
---
oh no, its too late!
---
Many of us will mourn, while those who couldn't bother will act like they were Freddy mains all along.
---
Clown should also be in this picture, his traps slow survivors down after all
---
Btw I hope you enjoy playing Ghostie :)
---
edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger!
---
edit 2: thanks for the gold kind stranger!
---
terratorial imperative bubbas rise up.
---
Then that‚Äôs someone purposely leaving the game.
---
Almost dropped my phone
---
Make sure to tell him gg ez
---
Good survivors usually heal in a loop anyways, idk why this sub always talk about crouching to a map corner because doesn't that just catch you with your pants down if the killer finds you before you're finished?
---
Come on I think Susie is better
---
&lt;3
---
 No just no I hate barb add Nancy or even robin lol I‚Äôd main both of them tbh
---
So damn scary every time
---
oh yeah he dope lol
---
Yo wtf
---
He did though.
---
Could be wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure WGLF applies to all the blood points gained in the trial. Basically a bloody party streamers in a perk slot
---
This is the worst one i think ive ever seen
---
Killer is host so this will continue to be a thing until dedicated servers arrive. Could've been a lag switch or just major de-sync.
---
Something along those lines yeah, heavens forbid you accept positive change right? If you enjoyed it, great, but it's not healthy for the game overall.
---
Appreciate it, I'll go see right now
---
Then you‚Äôre one shot, and her chase ends that much more quickly.
---
Jeff should be atleast B tier, if not A.
---
talked to the killer afterwards and he was cool about it, commended the stun and we wished luck to each to find better games. i depipped tho so i have salt.
---
Please upvote this post. Stop. Using. Selfcare.
---
You could've 99% multiple gens instead of watching him. You would get Iridescent Lightbringer by doing this so dying or escaping at that point wouldn't make any difference to your emblems.

"When the killer isnt camping"
---
Good one.(I get its devour hope and all, but everyone camps. No one uses devour hope)
---
Not on android yet, just had the notification this morning it come thru.
---
I was doing them but it was taking a long time. Wasn‚Äôt sure where he was and I passed hatch near gen 3 so I went for it. He was there.
---
What're they doing to him?
---
It is hard. I'm rank one atm and it's tough to even get a safety sometimes.
---
&gt;I think hook removal speed is a little underwhelming (if not detrimental), but I can't help but giggle at the thought of that + resilience + leader.
---
‚Äã
---
&gt;get oFF THE FUCKIN HOOK
---
If you think faster unhooking is underwhelming you clearly haven't performed many saves against hard campers or face campers. 
---
By being able to unhook faster, it leaves the rescuer less exposed for grabs and even gives you more than enough time to run between the killer attack cooldown if he hits you the first time. 
---
Faster unhooking would be perfect for WGLF since is not game breaking but it would be a major buff to use along side Borrowed Time against campers.
---
it was really nice to see, I'd hate to be in a situation like that with no support
---
It's just a dick move to also deny the killer points.
---
Yes there are. Not sure the name.
---
Make Freddy Great Again!
---
Hell Yes bitch
---
So close, so far
---
No its not. It only takes emblem system knowledge. People were getting 4x Iridescent at rank 1 effortlessly when twitch challenge leaderboards launched. 
---
All you have to do is stomp the survivors at first and then prolong the game at will to guarantee Iridescent Chaser and Gatekeeper. Once you kill all 4 with the amount of hook events necessary, you get 4 iridescent.
---
Yeah my name is unknown and my teamates are usually localhost_67483947
---
Science is cool
---
The Bloody Coil does that. It's an ultra rare.
---
Siiiiiick ill have to see what else is planned for this patch
---
Those poor 2 babies...
---
Yes, it's called Bloody Coil.
---
It's much easier to be both. Playing killer can make predictions easier.
---
Honestly, I think he'll launch with all his teachables unlocked, which is fine with me.
---
I bought dbd on pc just to main bill and NOW I CAN DO IT ON XBOX IM SO HAPPY
---
You almost teabagged him in the end though?...
---
Oh sorry what the fuck else are we supposed to run?
---
This comic I drew more than one year ago, it's... surprising for me to see it on this sub again ( but you should post it with my credit next time:) )
---
This is fantastic
---
They just wanted to specify that he doesn't have the aura reading he used to, which was whenever you were outside his terror radius. New Freddy has no aura reading in his base kit from what they've said.
---
I actually like this! Each episode can be a 20-40 minute representation of the killer's backstory!
---
Hope it's Joyce just so you cry then lol.
---
should have brought enduring
---
Really you need iron will to survive??
---
I see, thanks for clearing that up! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Peekaboo!
---
imo, it'd be way better and scarier if freddy could teleport from wardrobe to wardrobe  .just imagine blood gushing out from a wardrobe , only to emerge in an instant a spicy freddy
---
Not on it's own, but in a 4 man swf,  all teabagging while they do it...
---
did u played his new version?
---
That's dope. Try Shirtless Myers next.
---
Chuck Norris
---
I thought it just meant Bill so thank you for this
---
The new one seems pretty good but some people think otherwise
---
Nurse needs to be changed to be at Billy‚Äôs level of power
---
I used to have a really weird bug that a lot of people thought was a lag switch, but when I was on the PTB for the dedicated servers it never happened, so it shouldn't be a problem after they go live.
---
Killer has to find the hatch
---
Where tf is my man Quinten?
---
Joel or Ellie
---
Absolutely
---
I made him and the rest a few months ago, someone was kind enough to link the post above, or you can just go to my profile ‚ò∫
---
[removed]
---
They have also said before that they would never add a clown killer.
---
I wonder how that turned out?
---
Thank you!
---
Together we are the ginyu force
---
Thanks!
---
[she looks like a frog](https://imgur.com/gallery/uCqU9aK)
---
Link?
---
Yep, also they should check at removing some items from bloodweb. Like as a survivor main I have over 100 "lessen fog" bottles, what's the point of using them as survivor, helping the killer? Or luck offerings, luck is absolutely worthless in this game, as it doesn't not affect chests, so it's only for kobes. You get like 7% chance to kobe, instead of 4%, amazing. Bigger skill check zone add ons is also worthless. Same on killer side, a lot of worthless items you will never use.
---
Will do! Haha. Great work on these seriously. My comment was just me being facetious. I hope I didn‚Äôt come across as a jerk!
---
Yeah I noticed it today on PS4, I felt bad after the second time so I'd just scare them from the Gen.
---
Everything's for sale, my friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second.
---
100% I use controller
---
"Psst... Gimme five"
---
Shaggy from Scooby Doo.
---
Idk how, people are just stupid and think anything is toxic these days
---
almost belongs in r/accidentalrenaissance
---
Nah you're good, haha. I'm glad you like them.
---
It's a game where 4 people are hunted and sacrificed by another person. Morals went out the window before launch.
---
 I will happily sacrifice a fellow survivor to escape. Also I'll camp the first swf survivor I catch, and the last. If the mechanics were based off morals this game would be called "Chick-fil-A before close." 
---
The best way to handle noed is leave. Let the killer have their one kill, if you guys haven't cleansed your totems. The best way to deal with BT is not hit the unhooked person. No morals involved. Just logic.
---
This is like something that happens mid-chase in Scooby Doo
---
Yay he‚Äôs still playable
---
Cringe
---
Thank god. He would‚Äôve been unplayable to me if they removed that.
---
Milk and Cookies bby
---
Absolute Unit
---
Huh? No.  2 v 8 is fair. 4 for each killer. Especially since killers could double team on 1 survivor and absolutely demolish them.
---
They could have so many different Freddy skins just by taking what he looks like from different movies. Remake (which is the default), new nightmare, original, part 2, and so on.
---
Anyone else thinking that coin looks like it has a troll face on it?
---
It still makes me jump, even if im the killer.
---
Use your lockers.
---
Bruh if you had Adrenaline. Would be such a spit in that poor guys face
---
Jane and Jeff should be higher, just saying.
---
Those giant, giant knees
---
My best guess would be that the female character‚Äôs mesh is being forced into male survivor proportions
---
Never works
---
Killers wouldnt be able to dominate one person and still be spreading pressure. Even if they both found 2 people each to chase and hook that's still 4 people working. A 2 vs 8 may not be fair for killers tbh. 2 vs 6 may be the fair point. I dunno. I'm just speculating.
---
They could down one survivor in seconds  if they worked together. If someone is being hooked every 15-30 seconds, that makes pressure.
---
Every time I see one of these videos showing this bug, I'm just HOPING that a killer will come by and react if they can see it to.
---
That's rough
---
Balanced landing,  self care prove thyself maybe dead hard so I‚Äôm usually fine
---
Dead by Daylight: Escape is not an escape

Spirit:this time in going to KILL BILL!!
---
not an alt, I don't use Reddit that much.
---
It was added to fortnite? I don‚Äôt want it anymore.
---
Jokes aside I hope that it does get added and I hope the upside down can be turned into a good power. Demogorgon would be such a cool addition.
---
Imagine him eating your face with his face
---
What's your Twitch?
---
LOL
---
I don't like it. I also never asked for it. I quite enjoyed Freddy as he was. Unpopular opinion, I know.
---
Lmfao you right
---
SOME PEOPLE DONT KNOW THAT WHEN FREDDY HITS U, U GO INSTANTLY ASLEEP
---
oh caps sorry
---
Leaving tactical comment for when you finally make these
---
Last guy probably disconnected to give you the hatch.
---
Yeah Freddy‚Äôs gonna be really good
---
Thank god they don't listen to the community otherwise Generators would take 5 minutes each, DS and MoM would have multiple uses, Hag would have 120% mov speed and the list goes on.
---
Most people on reddit are clueless.
---
But he can pull a trapper and snarl the gate. You'll be forced to scream and alert him so he has that going for him
---
If a killer is face camping then they can‚Äôt patrol gens. Either run borrowed time or just gen rush them.
---
‚ÄúThe Cuntress‚Äù
---
People are really complaining about the rework? It seems awesome!
---
^
---
Honestly, I usually find a med-kit in the game. Or just look for other survivors. A better replacement perk is Iron Will.
---
I‚Äôm a teenager also
---
Yup it's gamer time üòéüòéüòé
---
Doesn't he instantly put people sleep with a hit?  They forgot to mention that. 
---
  
---
We're gonna start seeing Freddys at them higher ranks now.  A Tier perhaps?
---
Like he said, an unused perk. Dead by Daylight was trying to trick us with leaks for a new killer based off a teacher, but surprised us with something else. I think, you can check the wiki
---
Doctor only really counters stealth. If you can loop decently you should be fine. He slows down while shocking which should give you enough time to just do another loop even if you get hit with it. 
---
Nurse is much trickier. You basically have to break line of sight and make your pathing unpredictable. Don‚Äôt run into open spaces or you will get hit. Also, don‚Äôt pull the same juke over and over or they will see the pattern and predict your pathing.
---
I hate how the community always interprets that rework = only buffs. Grow up, people.
---
If he/she spent it doing something they enjoyed I wouldn't call it sad.
---
So...
---
If you so sure they have noed, why dont you or someone go hunt for some totems?
---
Stealth doesn't work against the doctors I play against all they do is spam the shock ability everywhere until they find someone and then they puppy guard you when they put you on a hook
---
Are you trying to get mori‚Äôd? Cuz this is how you get mori‚Äôd
---
I accidentally bought someone the Plague/Jane DLC because I clicked on them instead of my intended friend.  does that count lol
---
You're missing several things in this image.
---
You have to add in extra time on generators because the lack of toolbox (IIRC 16\~ seconds with Engineers) or flashlight (less time in chase = someone else off generators) costs time.
---
You have to account for Franklin's Demise, for your team not healing you (a problem at every rank, especially ranks 1 to 5), for the difficulty in finding someone to heal without another perk (Empathy) or finding someone to heal you (if you don't run a medkit, such as Bond) and whether they will let you heal them/heal you.
---
I still don't understand the hate on selfcare given how spending 32 seconds in a corner of the map (which is wise to do anyway due to Nurse's Calling) is better than running around (still using a perk slot on Bond) to find someone who might not heal you, and spending 32 seconds (16 you + 16 them) healing in the middle of a field that you left a bunch of scratchmarks and blood stains in while you're groaning really loudly.
---
And you still don't get a flashlight or toolbox.
---
Finding solutions to those problems is better than hating on SC.
---
Why did you post a empit lobby?
---
I know everyone thinks Legion is bad which I'm not saying he isn't bad but I just have a lot of fun playing him :/ Who do you think is a good killer for new players? And thx for responding
---
That killer's an actual bot. A five-year-old could've bamboozled them.
---
You can run but you can‚Äôt hide, bitch
---
New killer, Jim Pickens AKA The dear leader 
---
Weapon: sacrificial dagger
---
Special ability, the following: Jim can summon a member of his cult to help locate survivors. When activated. It will run to any survivor within a 30 meter radius and show the survivors aura 
---
Perks: the dear leader day: when exits are opened, your speed is increased by 5/10/15 percent
---
Hex: Death day: for every survivor killed, all actions are slowed down by 5/10/15 percent
---
The basement: every survivor hooked in the basement will have there aura revealed to them after a failed skill check for 5/10 seconds
---
Biography: Born to unloving parents, Jim Pickens was taught to harbor slaves by ‚Äúpeople living in the walls.‚Äù After growing up, he started his own cult to worship him. After a hard night of partying, he wandered into the woods to look for more people to kill
---
You don't. You just pray they are potatoes.
---
It really isn‚Äôt.
---
It's still under way. As mentioned with the previous dev update, we're currently focusing on optimizing specific perks and maps. This is still the case, nothing has changed in that regard. Once we're satisfied with the state of perks and maps and decide to move on, we'll be sure to make note of it.
---
Um? As a killer, players spending so much time healing themselves is a good thing. It means they're stationary and gens aren't being touched. What a moron, I swear some people really shouldn't play video games.
---
I'm gonna go ahead and get this out of the way in advance:
---
1) He is absolutely T posing, far more a successful Doctor stance that some cowardly arms crossed pose.
---
2) Yes, this is outfit that I, a gentleman of culture and fine taste, use on my Doctor.
---
So just to expand on this, this killer sent my friend an angry message after a game. He was raging because my friend healed himself during the course of the game. I want to note that my friend and I were queuing together, the other two Claudettes in the lobby were randoms and one of the Claudettes had an insteaheal. This guy was playing the Spirit and running only Rancor. He got one hook the whole game (on one of the Claudettes), the other Claudette unhooked and instahealed her. The entire time this happened, my friend and I were working on gens. No one was even remotely toxic to him, no one was teabagging, flashlight clicking, none of that. Survivors were rank 9, 15, 12, and 16. Killer was rank 13. 
---
He is still currently sending angry messages calling survivors no skill, saying survivors are ruining this game, etc. Have to say, have never experienced someone this unwilling to accept that they just had a bad game before.
---
Too cute‚Äî survivors would run TOWARDS him.
---
You tried I guess, but no.
---
Honestly the most annoying part as Freddy was to put the survivors into dreamworld.
---
Glad that‚Äôs gone,the rework is not strong but better than before.
---
It‚Äôs something at least.
---
I think for it to work they'd also have to increase how many gens are needed to be done or change how long it takes for a gen to be completed before it would be balanced
---
Y E S
---
It's quite the opposite. There are enough people that just want to play killer as is to support the amount of people that just want to play survivor. When bloodpoints are introduced into the mix, things get messy. This is why killer queue times shoot up whenever a double bloodpoint event comes around; people know that killers earn more on average and want to maximize their bloodpoints. Giving people the freedom to play either side keeps queue times steadier.
---
Use the same tactic applied to old Franks Mixtape, disconnect and find another match.
---
Killers getting stronger by the day?
---
Thx for responding and I think I might try out the Huntress, I thought that since I'm a survivor main I would be able to know what they would do but its so unpredictable !! I just wanna have more fun with my games , and moonwalking I think I know how to do? Maybe. Ugh it's just a pain, but thank you for the tips !!
---
**^You ^Doodle**
---
Haha that first one was so inspired I doubt I'll ever make a better meme
---
Have you found a way to link your console/PC account?
---
That (more or less) is how the system is planned to work at the moment: The timer grows exponentially over time. If you do it religiously, you're going to be spending most of your time locked out.
---
Beyond that, the timer only gets shorter if you play without disconnecting, and the time for the decay to take effect resets with each time you disconnect (meaning someone who keeps disconnecting is going to be permanently stuck with a ridiculously long time-out).
---
Tbh it makes it better that he took a picture of his screen
---
First game playing as a killer, I got an easy 4K with hillbilly. Some killers and some survivor perks are ridiculously broken or strong.
---
I fucking hate this community. Toxic morons the whole lot.
---
Fair enough, I usually play Survive with friends so we have communication
---
WHY IS JEFF HOT?! I AM NOT OKAY
---
I can‚Äôt check right now, what does it do? (Iron will)
---
A lot of people
---
But three of those perks are exhaustion perks so I can‚Äôt use them all at once, no?
---
I still don't get why a killer would open the doors. It gives them no advantage whatsoever, only disadvantages. If you camp an open door, they'll just go for the other one. If you leave, they'll just teabag you when you return, and then escape.
---
Probably something like discordance sloppy butcher whispers and whatever 4th perk you want
---
He's not dead, it's a trick! Get an axe!
---
Hey man I‚Äôm low rank I gotta get the best possible perks for me to be able to survive consistently
---
Leroy‚Äôs memorial is broken is some spots with textures it‚Äôs hilarious lol
---
I played as a prayer bead spirit and the survivors were gen tapping??? So that‚Äôs a way I suppose. 
---
You CAN hear her footsteps approaching, that‚Äôs how I usually know she‚Äôs coming but I guess that doesn‚Äôt help bc I have some really good headphones.  It doesn‚Äôt always work especially with an almost finished gen- that‚Äôs where I look to see if grass is moving behind me. (Game/lerys you can hear her much clearer)
---
When you get it to tier 3 you‚Äôre 100% quiet when injured. You can lose the killer so much easier after you get hit, or if you can‚Äôt heal for a while.
---
I'm actually shocked they managed to make it to rank 13.
---
I thought you needed at least a speck of a brain cell to make it that far.
---
Thank you for doing god's work. A+ meme.
---
Basically the Legion rework
---
Since when Hag has nileppez?
---
*jeans*
---
2 ez
---
Oh, then carry on
---
wow, thank you, all the sarcasm in this thread was about to kill me.
---
Discordance, sloppy butcher for sure, thrill of the hunt for some extra BP, spies from.the shadows would be helpful if you use your ability in chase. Otherwise NOED for obvious reasons
---
A+ logic right here lmao. There isn't a damn thing in this game that hasn't been complained about by someone.
---
Ok, that might help. I have some pretty crisp headphones as well so I'll keep an ear out. I have never heard of the gen tapping before either, so I'll keep that in mind as well. Thank you.
---
Thank you for showing me this
---
Why should we trust you?
---
Tru3, Scott Jund, Zubatlel and OhTofu think that, they all said multiple times in their live streams and their videos that they think Spirit &gt; Billy against good survivors.
---
there's no version of dead by daylight on mobile
---
Yes I know right, it‚Äôs definitely odd looking.
---
Oh, I didn't know that.
---
Bruh this happens way to much on console. I love this meme and I will send this to anyone who DCs
---
I think I know what you are referring to, is it when you pick up an item?
---
Use left behind, simple
---
You spend a couple dozen hours crying in torment until you're good enough to be a somewhat threatening killer.
---
Actually he‚Äôd have 50 trapper friends, it says right there, trapper +50
---
"On our next episode of i shouldnt be alive"
---
So sad but true
---
That sounds cool as fuck
---
The grass and ground tiles are definitely the weirdest
---
Ok thanks i will try it
---
 &gt; more hens
---
All games need more hens
---
Why didnt u stab him for the points?
---
That's adorable
---
My autocorrect is bad don‚Äôt worry about it
---
Yeah, you know they're ripe because they turn your teeth emerald green.
---
He does not need to hit survivor 3 times. when he hits a survivor they are injured and put to sleep. Behavior learned their lesson with legion. Hopefully.
---
People get so salty when you say nice things about the devs
---
Thicc knees make big dreams
---
I thought he had his hands on his hips like a proud gentleman, but this is so much better
---
You yourself will need prayer beads to pray that prayer beads in spirit doesn‚Äôt wreck your ass
---
This gets posted 3 times a week
---
not ideally but theirs people who've learned to deal with it,shes much better with mouse and keyboard being able to swing your camera fast really makes a difference
---
Pro gamer moves
---
wait fr?
---
Yes, I saw it a day or two ago again recently. If you sort by new you see it more often
---
he does not slow down or anything when using them meaning he can throw them out mid chase to zone and slow. I think he will play like a stealthy clown with more map pressure.
---
Hide from the nurse, dont hide from the doctor. Fighting nurse is a mindgame. Get a loop between you and do your best to predict and dodge the teleports. For doctor remember that his zap attack stops you from interacting with windows and pallets for a second. Try to figure out what shape his zap is and how to dodge it. (Cone, ring, or line.)
---
He can place traps OR place fake pallets, not both
---
Or, or, hear me out here... 
---
I could run the ones that make me win! What a interesting concept!
---
Just luck of the draw i suppose. Or it could be because our particular region likes/dislikes those perks?i tend to see urban evasion dance with me and dead hard nearly every game but not those two. Who knows
---
1 and 4 are the best for you
---
These post are so dumb now
---
F
---
Hello rank 15 lol
---
3 Instant Heals, OOF. 
---
And you have Spirit Fury without Enduring, that match probably ended up "well" ...
---
I found this funny
---
Wow me too!
---
Now dead hard and balanced landing are exhaustion perks so if I activate one doesn‚Äôt the game not let me activate the other?
---
his ability allows him to pull survivors into dream state, he can only attack survivors in this "state"
---
hes invisible to those outside his dream state, but the lalala is his terror radius 
---
as hes pulling you in his appearance shows on and off similar to seeing something in a drowsy state
---
Pretty much this community likes to cry an awful lot
---
Ngl I kind of want to play it lmao but why does it say you have a lot of cosmetics already ??
---
They do it‚Äôs always complaining
---
I'm not saying Lightburn affects her. Just blinding her kicks her out. A normal killer blind.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that was not an escape since you died lol JK
---
The hooking animation is a merciless, bloody god, and it will have its sacrifice.
---
Pharmacy.
---
So i don't like the rework to me he seems like his going to be another weak killer. Probably above trapper and below clown is this a buff? yes 100% is this what i would like in a rework o god no. This is just another killer i cant play for half of the season and that annoys me. Having said this he isn't out yet so im willing to wait and see but lets be real they will probably nerf him not buff him so rip Freddy
---
Ew what this game is on mobile?
---
Are you talking about adept or just their perks in general? Because I‚Äôd only agree with all of these if we‚Äôre talking about adept
---
Ohhh this explains a lot, how come sometimes when I‚Äôm not in the dream state (I think) hell just be chasing me and disappear?
---
Bug
---
I swear to god I read this *exact* thing in a suggestion on either here or the Steam forums. Looks like they've been listening.
---
I give Behaviour a lot of shit, but they do give us what we want and I have to say they are probably the most transparent dev team out of them all.
---
I'm excited for the future.
---
No hopper should be the survivor
---
Don't let pathetic sacks of shit get you down. Not worth it.
---
Yes. And they did a pretty good job so far.
---
I guess
---
In my short experience, I've noticed that it's mainly Spirit mains who do this. I don't know why but it has destroyed that character for me, as soon as I hear the damn girl I get angry. Sorry for that bad ending bruh
---
It's completely situational. I've had more games recently where I'm full health as the exit gates power on
---
Honestly I would like the hook vacuum to be shrunk
---
I am...
---
Note that some players (myself included) experience the shitbug that is "failed to update rank" error thus we can't get above our current rank no matter how good we play.
---
I think thats the one...
---
Survivor ranks average out to 10. Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.
---
They could just follow Identity V's lead and have the rules a bit different.
---
Nurses Definitely. Until his rework is released people will heal themselves constantly just to wake up.
---
This is hilarious lol
---
If you don't know about it, the game Identity V has a 2v8 mode.
---
Both games have drawn some inspiration and worked together on some aspects, so... Yeah. Have fun.
---
Jeff's perks are just too situational or niche I think. Distortion is meant as a BBQ counter I would honestly guess, but hiding in a locker vs sacrificing a perk slot...
---
Unless you're a dedicated sabo squad breakdown is meh
---
Aftercare is underrated, but the on hook deactivation kills that perk for me
---
I hate hook vacuum. I hope dedicated servers fix that shit, sometimes it's a fucking yard away and you get hooked at 99.
---
Look I know your angry(for some reason lol) but if your going to be a dick you could at least use the correct information.
---
Instead you look like an idiot AND an asshole. Good job!
---
I imagine it's because I can't actually imagine or visualize this stuff yet but I'm not really wowed by this. He's like the hag mixed with the clown now, which is neat I think, but I can't really grasp some of the changes they made. For one: why are there still so many ways to wake up from deep sleep? I think the dresser is actually a really good idea, as it means players who don't run self-care have a better way of getting out of deep sleep (or at least a more consistent way), but I still don't understand why there's still so many. Just remove the healing related ones now that the dresser has been added and make it a risk vs safety choice.
---
I'm also not really sure I understand the changes made to deep sleep in general. Why would I make dream pallets over a dream snare for example? At low ranks I imagine it'll demolish people not used to that kind of stuff, but snares in most every situation are going to be better no?
---
It's also weird that the only way aside from the timer to bring people to sleep is to hit them, but in order to hit them you'll want to use your powers to slow or trick them, but in order to use your powers you need them in deep sleep, but to get them in deep sleep you need to hit them etc etc.
---
Regardless I'm excited to see how it turns out in actual gameplay, as I could just not be getting his kit at the moment.
---
I need you bubba, don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre just a big teddy bear that ultimately wants to make people happy.
---
Except that's not toxic. Like at all.
---
&gt; (anything) is an auto DC for me. 
---
Now THAT shit is toxic
---
Practice
---
[I'm sorry](http://imgur.com/gallery/y12Wk2L)
---
Shhh we gotta make the add ons that are actually good look balanced
---
I'm really excited for this. He sounds awesome. When does it drop?
---
Identity V, a DbD clone for mobile, has a 2v8 mode and it's a ton of fun.
---
I was thinking the same thing, Trickstershadow plays freddy with rancor and never puts anyone to sleep til the end and rancors them, calls it the JAWS game. Its awesome lol
---
Yikes! Hopefully this is just a visual bug. We really don't need Killers running Bond or Empathy again. :s
---
Also cool! I personally really liked the Percy Jackson series; I hope you enjoy them too.
---
Absolutely not interested in the mobile version but i can already tell you that your 4th point won't ever and honestly should never happen.
---
I mean you also don't get everything you own on the PC version on unlocked on the console versions if you own them.
---
Jeff IS Keanu Reeves
---
Sadly shit like this has been around since the beginning.
---
Thankfully while I have seen Speed Hackers in some Youtube Videos, I personally only ran into one of these and i've been playing since a little less than 2 years now.
---
Granted could have just been the only noticable one but still.
---
Why do I get the feeling that those messages are fake?
---
Yours was amazing, but this is how I imagine survivors experience me as a killer lmao.
---
He/she is spectating the person who died.
---
Hoes mad
---
omg i literally did this same thing yesterday lol
---
Yeah he was definitely walling but hopefully it gets fixed!
---
I prefer playing survivor to killer but I play both, survivor is high pressure for me but I like the suspense. with killer I like to make a story, I get way to into playing as if I were the killer in a movie and how good the movie would be but there is a lot less suspense and surprises as killer which is why I lean slightly more toward survivors.
---
Yeah but these are grassy green.
---
Yes, but
---
I mean I do agree that the Free Characters should be the same among all plattforms. 
---
Honestly i kinda expected that would be the case. Sad that it isn't.
---
These seems like exactly what an end game chat would look like
---
Humans can't be this stupid
---
looks like someone is facecamping
---
Me big Jealous
---
I may put them up on the Gallery later, but I have to fix the rest of their outfits/give them personalities, etc. A lot of them are only dressed from the waist up lol.  Also, Kate and Jane in particular have a lot of CC on.
---
Imagine playing on console I feel joy when I get a Nurse üòÇ
---
I actually haven't because I'm trying to get past Rank 4 to rank 3 so I've been avoiding staying near hooked people
---
I mean good for you for not being angered by that, but that doesn‚Äôt change that both actions are only done to anger another player. It‚Äôs intended to be a dick move.
---
I don‚Äôt endorse dc‚Äôing but rank means nothing
---
It‚Äôs even MORE a reason to Waifu them
---
Nice
---
That is what you get for toxically levitating above the hatch with your toxic nea magic. Totally a deserved kill that.
---
Meh I just like to sit in the green/yellow ranks where I can play casually without wanting to end it all
---
r/nicekillers
---
Maybe
---
Tapp is not depressed enough, it looks weird
---
I'd prolly play killer alot more but I just don't want to wait 10 mins for a queue and then another 10 for 4 ppl to ready up, just so I could get a game full of swf bullshittery and teabags.
---
I thought I was toxic, Jesus.
---
wow he's kinda cute
---
Plague and Ghostface for whatever reason I have barely seen. Plague I was burnt out when she released and so only like a month or 2 after I played, in dozens of games I've seen her maybe 2 times. Ghostface more surprisingly I have only seen one time so far though he seems much more fun to play against then most killers.
---
It's a bit confusing for me to outright say, "These are my favorite killers!" Since every killer I have some sort of issues with, but generally I'd say Michael and Huntress are my favorites.
---
What I mean by having issues with every killer is things like add-ons or just what they do. Huntress has 1 shot hatchets, Trapper tends to be easy to survive against but his traps make you play a lot slower which isn't fun to me, Hag is just jump scares and controls fucking, etc. 
---
I think Michael is the only killer that I still have a preference for in how it's played, but don't have outright issues with anything Michael can do. infinite tier 3 and tombstone slows him down a notable amount and takes a lot of set up, but it's incredibly powerful. You can play him more stealthy then others. You can play him normally. Like every way you can play Michael to me feels well balanced enough that there's nothing that's just outright bullshit that makes it unfun like how Huntresses 1 shot hatchets work.
---
welcome to our side of hell
---
I have to disagree on Ghostface, his power doesn‚Äôt get deactivated from staring directly at him 99% of the time...
---
I saw Zoey cosmetics on Meg last year and Francis on Jake, did they take them away?
---
This so much. It‚Äôs really dumb that Survivors can just throw themselves at you and use their DS. I really hate that. 
---
As for the stun, I‚Äôd just decrease it to 3-4 seconds.
---
Good luck. A lot of the killer perks make it so much more bearable. If you really want to get into killer i def suggest getting the essentials. Bbq and chili, nurses, ruin and bamboozle. I use those in a lot of my builds and others ive picked up from other killers bc i need it for a certain game plan.
---
Thanks man!
---
6.25% chance of it happening.
---
Emblem system is tailored for longer games with lots of chases and hooks
---
You are an important part of the ecosystem.
---
The game is already struggling to put you with similar skill level players, and you then want to divide the player base into 2 and think that'll somehow fix being matched against the wrong people.
---
There'd be no restrictions for strong players to not play in the casual queue anyway, and there's very little motivation for ranked, so most likely a ranked mode would be very long queue times without incentives.
---
sometimes I lose count, gotta make sure I completed the ritual of course.
---
The light! The promise of safety!
---
Hook vacuum has nothing to do with p2p or dedicated servers. They could remove it just like they removed pallet vacuum.
---
I want it for ghostface
---
That's cosmetics not a fully designed characters though. I don't know if they will be released for consoles. I hope they will
---
It's pretty dumb you should get the most points for a shorter game
---
This is more generous than giving the hatch to the last survivor, congratz
---
Lmao I agree but it fits with spirit because of the lyrics ‚Äúlet me teach you a lesson about trickery‚Äù ie mindgames lmao
---
You have been sired to become a Killer Main.
---
That‚Äôs because experienced survivors know the ‚Äúusual‚Äù totem locations. So it‚Äôs easier to memorize it. Oftentimes, the game spawns survivors next to the Hex totem too, so you have to take that into consideration too.
---
OP, why did you bother messaging the killer just to say "camp"?
---
If the killer camped, I think they're already aware that "camp"
---
If the killer did not in fact camp, you saying "camp" is moronic.
---
The fanbase is full of far too many people who believe that messaging a killer saying "camp" is a valid form of communication.
---
Also, r/foundthemobileuser
---
Honestly survivors say the killers are op but dude I mean with dead hard and instant healing with decisive strike and adrenaline. They can't be serious...
---
Running them both guarantees you‚Äôll have something to help in the chase just in case you‚Äôre not near anything to proc BL from. My friend runs them both because he‚Äôs usually in a chase for most of the game and his build centers around extending that chase for as long as he can.
---
Curious how experienced are you with the new Freddy?
---
Katelynn Genner
---
Farmer John is a pseudo legion main , he plays him often and even has a decent tips video on him.
---
I am a killer main and my steam profile consists of like 7 or 8 pages of cyrillic or people -repping me and calling me all sorts of names. I play as fair as possible. I love it it feeds me.
---
Never understood people disconnecting on death hook, it takes like an extra 2-3 seconds for you to leave plus you get to keep the points.
---
 This killer counters Spine chill if you catch my drift
---
Toxic or not, thats bullshit
---
R e p o s t
---
I got my BBQ off the shrine
---
If you are new then you should make sure to try playing killer sometime soon. It gives you a ton of perspective on the game. There are things the killer sees very differently than the survivors. Know what it looks like from their perspective, and information they have access to is huge.
---
My problem is that i don't have the blod points but i have the most fun with legion so i waste it on him
---
Only really works well on huntress gor hatchets
---
I just bring that add-on that increases the range by 70%. Makes it so much more easier
---
You forgot the mask
---
That's only because he comes with built in Iron Will
---
I have none. I don't like playing doc and haven't tried legion yet
---
1) You're gonna get torn to shreds on here. This subreddit doesn't much like self promo, especially considering I don't believe you've ever posted to here before.
---
2) Thumbnail needs work.
---
No it's not it's a waste of a perk slot. It's really not good enough to waste a perk slot on.
---
OP literally just flew over my house.
---
if you say so
---
The funny thing is that he wasn‚Äôt even running a perkless build like he claimed, he had Rancor. Ass backwards realm is pretty spot on, haha.
---
:'(
---
The aura reading is good but it only helps you out of chases and for a killer to be good his ability has to actively stop chases much quicker, if you have no way to stop loopers with your ability or end chases quicker than the killer is already F tier. Also most of the time survivors just run to their friends to snap out of it so his power doesn‚Äôt actually slow gens down, plus 1 missed skill check isn‚Äôt a large amount of time. 
---
If you‚Äôre putting multiple survivors asleep you‚Äôre already losing because you‚Äôre sleeping survivors rather than just killing them and winning the game like every other killer also most survivors are gonna get snapped out within like 20 seconds of being out of the chase. 
---
This lullaby terror radius thing is the most recognizable in the game and super easy to tell when he‚Äôs coming plus you know when he‚Äôs pulling you into the dream world so you have like a solid like 7 second lead on him. 
---
Like I said you get notified of the transition so any none brain dead survivor should have a 7 second lead not getting hit by you from the transition. 
---
Wraith doesn‚Äôt lack chase abilities at all, her ability is literally a 100% chase ability as it gives you a movement speed increase, allows you to mind game survivors into just running towards you and getting hit and her terror radius has a hard to hear noise low pitched noise which allows her to get very close before being noticed. Also Leatherface is a pretty terrible killer as well so you aren‚Äôt really saying much but even he has better chase powers than Freddy since he can break pallets with his chainsaw and can just go around the map forcing a survivor to drop tons of pallets and once most pallets are gone in an area of the map he can just 1 shot them rather than being forced to 2 shot them. His ability gets better the more you chase survivors because the less pallets they can use the more you can just 1 hit survivors with your chainsaw instantly ending chases unlike Freddy.
---
No one understands us Quentin‚Äôs
---
Load up your legion, then use the Bloodpoints you get from him in other killers to level 40 (about 1mil and 200k) get their perks then go back to legion. Use as many offerings as possible and get bbq and chili asap. It will solve your bp problems
---
Ah, so he decided to bring the perk that almost guarantees a kill, and still lost.
---
Gee, what an asshole.
---
That would make so much sense, too, since Scream is a parody of the horror movie franchise!!! Ghostface is literally linked to parody and satire (Scary Movie).  So why not? Hahaha
---
&gt;Auto-sleeping after 60secs could be annoying early game.
---
Being asleep doesnt seem to do much now, so its not really a problem.
---
A man's basement is his castle. He has a right to defend it by any and all means.
---
Barb is deadass in the entity
---
You must be a survivor main
---
That's not holding it hostage. Kinda crappy of him, but it fits with the basic principle of being able to close the hatch.
---
Unless the gates spawn super far away, you've already lost if he found hatch.
---
Valve was the kne keeping the L4D stuff away from console.
---
Wonder why they changed their mind...
---
L4D3 coming soon?
---
A old offering to go to autohaven they don't spawn in bloodwebs anymore
---
its an old map offering back when map offerings were brown and yellow
---
I don‚Äôt know why but I LOVE IT
---
Is it just me or do the proportions seem kinda of?
---
Yeah they are rape floss berries
---
Of course I must be. Who else can I be?
---
Do what i do. Only play survivor when you have at least 2 other people. That way you can underestand why your team sucks.
---
Haha nice one
---
The fact that you want an opportunity to slug is pretty shitty imo.
---
Slugging is probably the most bullshit thing a killer can do honestly
---
I almost surprised you don't expect people to be this petty over online
---
Must be children doing that to look cool
---
I mean Idk why it wasn't allowed because valve hasn't made any game since 2009 which was Left 4 Dead 2 and they cancelled Left 4 dead 3.
---
How do u play on mobile
---
James bond
---
You need to hook each person 3 times.
---
You need to keep the match going as long as possible without gens done.
---
Idk the rest
---
Framerate being capped at 62 could simply be the Engine-sided so-called "framerate smoothing". The "FrameRateLimit=" variable overrides that behaviour however, so you should indeed not be stuck at 62 if you entered a different (and non-0) value.
---
VSync reverting to "True" means you should set your GUS.ini to read-only. It didn't use to be necessary for VSync/framerate to do that, but maybe now it is.
---
Tbf SWF are only strong against people who aren't good
---
Just look how Hearthstone or R6 Siege has it. It's not that hard to implement it the same way with ranked and casual! People who need to rank up will play it otherwise they just go casual and it doesnt matter!
---
I'll stop complaining about toxic survivors when I stop getting accused of tunneling after every single fucking game when I'm not even slightly tunneling. If you get unhooked, quite dicking around. It's not my fault you have no self preservation.
---
Yea, I have watched his vids, he has not done much with legion since the legion update sadly.
---
I'm talking about before when the 4 man SWF when they all had flashlights were op now I just shred through them
---
This is like the 100th time I‚Äôve seen this video
---
Actually it would make it better when you have casual you get grouped with whoever is just there! Only ranked would take a bit longer but that's something we ALL already are used to.....
---
And did I ever say I was a hero?
---
Something tells me the perks that survivors have already are plenty good enough for handling even the reworked Freddy.
---
Thats the plan. There is no benefit without downside's! All other competitive games do it also, it surprises me that people here dont get it.
---
Glad you're having a good time. Well done on the trophies and stay safe out in the fog.
---
Have you ever heard of reverse image search?
---
They NEED to remove it.
---
I can't count how many times I SHOULD have gotten off the hook but didn't because of that
---
Joni is my favorite Joni
---
The other two survivors really should get all the credit, and the killer being kind, I'm sure.  You be safe too!
---
Using good perks = toxic
---
One thing to add, don't see it but is note worthy I suppose. Calm Spirit will stop the scream, or is suppose to according to the stream.
---
Pretty much. I was the obsession too and not only am I mediocre at best in chases, I was playing a character I never play for a ritual and had all low level perks. Despite that, he still couldn‚Äôt catch me to use his Rancor on me. I guess it‚Äôs because I was being super toxic and giving myself an unfair advantage by running away from him.
---
Toxicity is when a survivor doesn't want to die.
---
Maybe. But until then I‚Äôd just suggest getting into discord groups when you‚Äôre playing as survivor so it‚Äôs less frustrating.
---
Name a more iconic duo
---
I like it and will most certainly be using it
---
Looping and throwing pallets is truly the only way to properly escape or distract the killer from other survivors from my limited experience in the game so far.  Also when playing the survivor I feel tunneling/camping is a viable strategy for the killer (although kind of dishonorable) but has major drawbacks if the other survivors are getting gens in the meantime.  Just got the game 3 days ago and am having a ton of fun with it so far and feel like most matches have not been too toxic thankfully.
---
Yes there is of OC, I never said this sub was only reposts but the amount of reposts on it is infuriating.
---
At least that ia insanely rare.
---
Though the 10% chance of more then 2 BNPs didn't stop them from getting nerfed...
---
Man if the last Ultra Rare becomes shit like the other 2 I'll probably stop playing
---
Well if you add up their Ranks and divide it by 4, you can see that their combined Ranking is 10. 
---
 
---
Balance in all things my friend.
---
Seriously though i am surprised that their crutches have not yet been exchanged for a wheelchair. Damn.
---
Kate want snu-snu
---
&gt; People who need to rank up
---
Why do they NEED though? There are no bonuses for higher ranks, and I don't remember anything about them being added to the game.
---
Also, Siege has like 3-4x more players, it can afford splitting playerbase into different queues. DbD struggles with a single one (long queue times for killers)
---
you need  be  camped
---
Keep in mind that they did say they are keeping a debuff add-on available to Freddy that affects action speeds. So, you could theoretically have some slowdown. The debuff just won‚Äôt be AS strong,
---
The Rift/Arcive, coming out within the next 3-5 months should give tons of lore
---
And throw away a 4K sorry not happening
---
:0
---
Have you considered accepting Thanataphobia as your lord and savior?
---
Yeah Survivors got nerfed hardcore, which barely affects the 15% of good survivors, but for everyone else...
---
Yeah, since when are we taking this guys advice?
---
It was the fast vault through the fence that did you in.
---
Survivor perks &gt; killer perks
---
I'm fairly new to this game and like playing killer, and am around rank 13 and am now getting 1-2 dcs per match. Usually a David, and im on ps4 so its always on a burner account. I'm trying not to take it so hard but I prefer just playing the damn game rather than having them quit on me.
---
Ok so when a survivor leaves a game its toxic, but when a killer uses a strategy that nobody likes its toxic? If the killer was BMing that would be toxic. And survivors teabagging - Nobody likes that, but that's not toxic and "Just grow up snowflake". Just no
---
I was wondering why Freddy didn‚Äôt have the ability to make you see only other Freddy‚Äôs when you look at teammates when dreaming
---
No it's not! Get back in there, tear!
---
Evil Within 1
---
The doctors trash ass doesnt need to be teaching anything because he is in fact not good
---
No.
---
Dead By Daylight will never be able to become a pro E-Sports level game.
---
As an asymmetrical game, there are inherent balance issues. 
---
Okay, let's say a proper E-Sports tournament occurs. Every player, in EVERY match will play with meta perks, play Claudette and Nurse/Hillbilly, and every match will be made up of 85% looping.
---
No thank you.
---
&gt; I am thinking of running a perk setup of no mither, self care
---
Only if your plan is to meme out of your mind. Hint: self care is useless with no mither, you will always run injured.
---
Also, MoM is kinda useless now, because detection of protection hits is not reliable. Sometimes they won't register as protection
---
Cool art style, keep up the good work!
---
But how did you know that they were rank 2
---
Why tho? You could have just kept running and let them drop the pallet. Gained nothing for this...
---
While you will enjoy old reposts now because you weren‚Äôt here to witness them a year ago, 1 year from now we will see the same thing happening with the current OC posts if we don‚Äôt call them out on it.
---
I petition that we colloquially term these husks "bitchprints," for dcing like a bitch.
---
I don't disagree with you. I just said that they have nothing to do with servers.
---
And I will have a giggle and remember this conversations when that happens. Thank you :)
---
Thank you for that lovely counter argument you provided there, my opinion has changed completely on the matter. DS needs to be buffed.
---
I mean the only decent survivor perks are Adrenaline and BT. Everything else is either decent, situational or sucks.
---
Meanwhile killers have NOED, Remember Me, Discordance (on some killers) Tinkerer (again, some killers) Nurses, Ruin, BBQ &amp; Chili...
---
The list goes on and on.
---
Granted, most killers are bad, so they do need the perks, but alot of survivors are also bad, and we only got 3 or 4
---
black
---
Well I didn't say anything about the servers
---
Can someone summarize the Freddy reworks for me please?
---
not only 1 side but only like 1 character too.. like you paid money to play like 1% of the game.. and you're proud of it.
---
Welcome to the game! Awesome you are having so much fun with it, it's definitely become one of my favorite games. 
---
A lot of trophies will happen naturally, like certain ones where you repair a specific generator in a set spot on a map (bathroom in The Game, for example) but the trophies that take a lot of planning are the Adept (survivor) trophies. Escape with each survivor using just their 3 unique perks. It would probably be easiest to accomplish when you are still nee to the game and playing against killers who are also similarly ranked. 
---
I think they did a great job making Ghostface but he can be a little tricky to play (like Michael Myers actually) so I would recommend getting a bit more experience with the killers you have before you buy any more DLC, but if you really enjoy the game the DLC is all worth it.
---
You need a better strategy then.
---
I've seen survivors at rank 9 who belong in rank 21 before.
---
I am so confused with this system sometimes
---
All these sound great, but as a new player I need clarification - when 'mid seasons' updates happen? When did current season start?
---
Because you are on reddit and when you are right or don't follow the subreddit meta you get downvoted
---
I thought this was the Brady bunch
---
Dead Hard should only be used by people who can actually use it. It can be unweildy
---
Each chapter is every three months. Mid-chapter updates are 1.5 months after each chapter :)
---
Maybe. Hopefully they will add the demogorgon we will see
---
You don't need to have to play it to be able to predict how it's going to go as long as you have enough of the facts.
---
If you've got an iphone like me, you just change your region/country settings in the appstore to one of the 4 countries that have DBD (I used Sweden) 
---
if you've got an android: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgchrKtgApQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgchrKtgApQ) this guide helped my friend get it and hopefully it'll work for you too!
---
Try finding the hatch while one of you has a key .
---
You aren't WRONG per se. Though sometimes both sides can feel impossible
---
Well he was a dwight dressed sharply so yea
---
that's totally fair, also relatable lol
---
Ikr! I fuckin love the leather one, so badass. OINK
---
They will make some bonuses. Its not they have to invent the wheel new!  
---
I think Siege has even more players than just 3-4x!
---
It is the Summer sale, but Ghostface is still 5 euros. The person was really generous! Congrats!
---
That's the problem, too many people see old freddy as trash because they're used to playing every other killer, and nobody takes the time to learn how to use his power because can't play him as a no brain m1 killer. Freddy may have been the worst killer but he was never trash, just watch people who actually main freddy play him
---
Ok thank you
---
I can't believe OP got bitten by a Ghost Face üòû
---
In game they seemed normal to me, but I get what you mean, they do look kinda fishy here
---
You‚Äôve got to be trolling with this question lmao
---
Will try!
---
I'm in the process of making a build that uses Devour ~ass~ Hope. And I'm fairly confident in it.
---
Well it's not in my case! It's more the annoyance that as soon as you hit Rank1 you cant play casual anymore. Every round is a tryhard-fest at some level.
---
That's great advice to wait as I feel like I haven't played as Myers that much and I haven't quite got my monies worth yet.
---
I've committed to the idea I'm probably never going to get any of those Adept trophies but maybe if I can get them leveled up.  I've been letting the dailies sort of dictate who I should be playing with, to get a better sample of everybody. 
---
I'm a big ol nerd, so I made a list of those maps with the generators, I've only been to the Residence once and got killed pretty quickly by the Hag.  Which paid off later when I was the Huntress and saw some survivors trying to fix it.  Then I got distracted chasing someone else and came back and it had been fixed.  So those two got that trophy thanks to me.  Which I never seem to go up against brand new killers as I don't get away with anything.
---
autodidact gang
---
He's great sure, but I think they literally (and I'm not joking) over done themselves. Freddy doesn't need to have so much power actions, know what, I bet every one on the head team of behaviour were spouting ideas of how to fix/rework Freddy, and they just took all the ideas and slammed it together and called it the rework.
---
Shame they removed the easter egg to change your text color
---
You are that kind of survivor I find in my team
---
Doctors whit Iron Maiden are gods.
---
OP is tonight's biggest loser for thinking that this subreddit would applaud his childish response
---
Suddenly, Deja Vu is worth considering.
---
Aww, what a nice person! The fans can be so freakin negative and nasty to each other all the time, I'm glad you found a buddy
---
You don't have any you know what he does , you don't know how his power is affected by add-ons , all the specific perk counters , how he'll do against all the various ranks , changes til he goes live. 
---
Reminds me of a old quote , &gt;No matter how beautiful the strategy you should sometimes look at the results.
---
And also generally you should try things before you judge them.
---
I don‚Äôt think the killer should play by any rules other then not breaking the game ur the killer kill by any means necessary
---
You mean when you spawn into a game you can‚Äôt see where the gens or hooks are right?
---
Since you asked so nicely, sure!
---
Do u play on console? if so which one?
---
Tip 1: stop lying to yourself. There's LITERALLY no way (except for DC) for 2 survivors to die in 20 seconds.
---
*goes to bodyblock*
---
*survivors DCs*
---
*get caught*

I can‚Äôt see where they are all game long.

&gt; They will make some bonuses.

Will they? I haven't read/seen anything on that

Honestly no, I‚Äôm rank 5 and people still don‚Äôt have too many brain cells
---
I feel bad for the both of you
---
Seriously man

Wish I could mail Jane

Devs haven't said anything about splitting the queues, so it's a very big "if"
---
Nice attempt for adept
---
Too bad one set takes up the whole paycheck lmao
---
Me looking for feta cheese at 3AM
---
Yeah, but as a killer, I would want as much time as I can to hunt the survs down. So it cucks me just as much as it cucks them, and now they can just walk out, instead of having to open it first. That's what I don't get.
---
I think you just suck at using wraith/any killer and probably should probably uninstall the game.  or you could just main survivor since the killer role isn't suited for you obviously. #ggrip
---
I'm playing both sides equally. You're not thinking this scenario through - if survivors get the same bp as killers, there's no more incentive to play the more stressful side of the game. It would become even **more** stressful, because survivor mains would have more consistent access to said items. It you don't see how this could easily destroy the game's balance at high ranks, I can't help you and the survivors who downvoted me. But we'll see what Behaviour does. Hopefully *they* are thinking it through.
---
You ain‚Äôt wrong, that was real toxic of that dude
---
Shove ‚Äòem up your ass and they become anal beads!
---
I wish I could nail her
---
hey uh... you leaked your name in top right
---
I went ahead and fixed them up and took off their CC. Keep in mind some of them may look slightly different, mostly Kate's hair and Jane's hair/makeup. Origin ID is nikoab\_cat. :)
---
Ooooh, DBD lore series üòç

It‚Äôs his power but it won‚Äôt be like that for much longer as Freddy‚Äôs rework is coming soon

He did a pretty good job explaining the new feature about waking other people up though.. so far
---
I like to call them hatch cunters but ok
---
So you actually have a point in there somewhere or are you just here to insult people?
---
Also, this isn't Twitter. Using hashtags just makes you look like an ass.
---
I'm kinda excited to see it. I know I'll probably complain about how he's op after he wrecks my team but I do want to see how his new kit works
---
this art is perfect. who did this??
---
I don‚Äôt do this often but let me indulge myself. AWWWWWWWWWW
---
We got a code Brown, I repeat we have a code brown
---
*click*

Yup, I‚Äôm adding that one to my cringe compilation

---
Glad he didn't say "play something else, play civilization or something.."
---
 Welcome to the club, you just started a controversial tread
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard about that, any idea what his rework is gonna look like?
---
**If anyone is interested, I uploaded these sims to the Gallery. My Origin ID is:** ***nikoab\_cat.*** **Keep in mind they do not have the CC I have pictured, so they look slightly different. Mostly Kate's hair, Jane's hair/makeup, and subtle skin details/my default CC skin I keep in game.**
---
My issue is I don't have much of a gaming budget but I'll see if there is a way to access that feature.  I might see of I can get a ten dollar psn card as I sort of was looking forward to trying the Doctor as he was intense and Feng seems to be pretty popular.  I'll probably just wait until there is another DLC sale as that's what got me to commit to playing it this time around. 
---
I also like playing as Laurie, I wish she had a hat option too.
---
OINK intense*
---
You can see the exact moment she goes ‚Äúwait what ?‚Äù
---
No gen rushing means that they go for the gens instantly and do it extremely quick also i go for the objective only and just go forr killing them then they will call me toxic and a fun hater
---
I don‚Äôt like it when survivors teabag at all, it‚Äôs purpose is to infuriate people, and that is just toxic. Using flashlights, perks, and looping isn‚Äôt though. But teabagging is just a rude thing that makes people feel bad when they don‚Äôt do a good enough job :/
---
I mean I‚Äôve walked straight past some P3 Clauds on gens because they animorph into generators sometimes, but this is undefendable
---
Good play OP
---
First Susie, not Laurie, so many traps in this game.
---
Wha it is this a Claudette or just corn?
---
pc
---
Yesss, I love it!!! &amp;, of course, I love Daddy Myers. 
---
You have talent! ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
exactly
---
Still better than Ace. His perks don‚Äôt even remotely affect chases. His whole thing is that he searches chests and is a complete twat. David has Dead Hard so you expect him to be balsy and bully the killer into submission.
---
Is there anywhere a list of these changes?
---
PTB is next week, so release will be two weeks after that, right on schedule.
---
You still got significantly more BP than any of them, I sure hope you aren't complaining about "coordinated survivors bringing OP addons"
---
Ranked mode suggestions are borderline "oversaturated content" (a reason to report posts) here. Several posts each day. If by now devs haven't said anything positive about that, I'd say it's pretty clear they're not interested
---
Yeah wraiths only effective til green ranks though....
---
You need to understand thats the way game is at those ranks. Thats why some "casual" streamers tend to stay into 8-14 rank. Where there is more "fun"  rather than joining a lobby with swf that finish the game in 3 min.
---
I didn't add that because calm spirit should always be blocking screams. Probably still good to say expressly though.
---
Meanwhile i get comments on my steam profile like this "rep-- Camper killed us all"
---
???
---
if a good killer knows the survivor has it, the perk becomes worthless except for extending loops. It's really easy to just time your lunges and still hit through the deadhard
---
Just stop he lost ur point
---
... Do you even hear yourself? Even if he had the best add-ons, which there is no proof of, you're just pulling that out of your ass, he'd be awful for it. No Killer should have to depend on his add-ons to do anything.
---
1. I dunno, maybe he spawns a little further back.
---
2. I can't imagine it would.
---
This is literally a daily occurance for any killer. I had a swf group disconnect on first down after i reloaded my bottles as clown before picking them up. In post game chat they said i was a noob camper and raided my profile. GOOD TIMES!
---
Why did valve allow this?
---
I thought no mither and mettle of man would work perfectly together.
---
Beautiful. Also I heard Bill is finally coming to console. Will he be free or paid?
---

Wow! That‚Äôs awesome. And who says all DBD players are toxic. Lol
---
Get closer to rank 1.
---
He just a dwight that need some sleep
---
Ah so your just pulling false accusations out your ass?
---
Cool, cool.
---
In case anybody is actually gullible enough to believe what this guy is saying, no. I didn't "make up" any equations.
---
All the numbers in the post are either directly from the DBD wiki or are directly derived from those numbers through some very simple calculations.
---
You can check my math if you want, but I wouldn't want you to embarrass yourself.
---
These posts from you are annoying.
---
You want to change things up but want to take away perks at the highest level of play? That literally kills game diversity.
---
Wow insulting me for my opinion. I know he'll have the best add-ons shut up and watch. 
---
Also killers shouldn't depend on there add-ons to do anything , ever.
---
Ok mate I‚Äôll try to stop :)
---
Personally I enjoy killer more but I can easily see why people like survivor more when I play garbage killers like Bubba or Freddy. Running in a circle for 5 minute intervals before getting a slight change in scenery to do the same thing repeat 30 times over isn‚Äôt fun. While I understand looping is an essential part of the game for survivors when you‚Äôre playing low tier killers it just kills the game and makes it unfun, it feels just as shitty as a killer camping a hook because there‚Äôs nothing you can do to counter it or punish the survivor for it.
---
Curious how that‚Äôs the opposite when that‚Äôs exactly what I said.
---
Finally a pretty good meme
---
it‚Äôs hard to explain but the [dev stream vod](https://youtu.be/_ypdDN388Xg) here that showcases it
---
Bad game design that was intended to add to the jumpscare factor, but it just messes up the survivor's controls
---
I'll look it up as soon as I find the space to download the game. Thank you!
---

All right thx man
---
I will name you salty balls
---
Bruh... why are you going to waste time camping hook to lose BPs and have to play more to earn the same amount of blood points. You do know you get more BPs when you hook a survivor multiple times right? I mean if it works for you keep doing you my man, but it‚Äôs going to take you a lot longer to earn those tasty Bloodpoints.
---
It's referring to when your time out is over and you can play again. If you disconnect after that point, you end up back with another big time out.
---
They were designed this way. To disorient you.
---
\#Cringe #Tashhag
---
L4d3 was allegedly nearly fully completed and scrapped
---
Good players try to hide from BBQ, or it can come in handy when like yesterday a survivor tried to hide in a locker near the open exit gate just to BM me but unfortunately I had iron maiden so it was an instadown and right to his last hook
---
Which is exactly why he needs significant buffs.
---
yeah i don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs baffling to him that i was checking a gen and saw scratch marks 
---
and also i cut off his first message he first messaged me for tunneling and getting no kills (bc there was 2 or 3 DSs). it was the first game of the day at rank 9 so i didn‚Äôt do too hot
---
Awww

"Most of the roster is unplayable" isn't a good excuse for leaving a member of the roster unplayable for 3 years.
---
If anything, it should make them light a fire under their asses and get to fixing the roster.
---
Well played dude. And don't worry play whatever killer you like. If the survivor doesn't like it put them on a hook lmao
---
Op:Happy Fourth of July, have a chainsaw murderer
---
Me:thank
---
Op:Your welcome
---
What's that got to do with any of it? Both sides are shafted by the 'farming simulator' rank design.
---
A killer who does his job exceptionally and kills all survivors fast might not rank up because he didn't get chase points.
---
A survivor team who does their job exceptionally and evades the killer all game, never getting hooked once, might not rank up because they didn't farm altruism.
---
It's a stupid game design for sure. But to pull out the 'you must be a survivor main' argument is ridiculous.
---
...
---
The power causes a gap of 6 meters to open.
---
The power can only close gaps of 4 meters or less.
---
Did you not read the post?
---
Oh good Valve got their head out of their ass.
---
Do I sense a light deepfrying?
---
Defensive strike.
---
Dude is upset because he can‚Äôt tunnel better lol. This kid needs to find a new main. #ProblemSolved #HowsMyMathCheckOutBro!
---
You both deserve to be permabanned. Change my mind.
---
I wouldn't use Monitor and Abuse on the Hag. It's a great perk for letting you get close to survivors before the chase begins, but the Hag is one of the only killer that doesn't need to chase survivors. I would personally recommend something like Make Your Choice, Save the Best For Last, Devour Hope, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, Discordance, Surveillance, Haunted Ground or Corrupt Intervention. Since the Hag doesn't need chase perks, and doesn't have to rely on tracking perks, she has very open build options.
---
Can we take a minute to realize there are a couple killers in the background, not killing, but watching intently with every move Bill makes in game?   
---
Like Markiplier or Pewdiepie fans
---
The thing I hate about it is how stupid they make Jason. He's not op, but he becomes impossible to survive at the same time. He can instantly grab you by the neck but can't take a baseball bat to the chest? All of the kill bugs, counselor teaming with jason, stupid countless glitches, roof exploits, the mixed bag of matchmaking (literally get put with level 1s when I'm level 150) and the exploitable design put me off so hard. This game might be fun if your playing with friends, but I swear you must be lying with gritted teeth if you think that Friday the 13th is fun to play.
---
I've programmed multiple games. It's my job lol.
---
By the way, it's kinda pitiful to create an alt just to make it seem like you have a point.
---
Maybe if you didn't talk the same way in both accounts I wouldn't have thought to check the other account and find a 0 day old account with -3 Karma from this thread...
---
Lul.
---
&gt;Survivors will also be rewarded with survival points based on how long they survive in the match.
---
That's especially good because it means Survivors aren't (almost) completely dicked over in the Survival category for failing to escape.  It won't really do anything for Survivors who get tunneled from the start nor games where the Killer just stomps everyone, but usually Killers don't get that many points either if a match goes too fast.
---
Ruin and Pop are dogshit for Hag; Nurse's calling over Pop and work towards getting something over ruin (MYC, STBFL, Sloppy, Corrupt Intervention etc.)
---
Mmm yeah, maybe just like a visual indicator of terror radius, I could see that.
---
Lol says the wraith main crying for a buff.
---
it's an important part of her power, she'd be a lot weaker without it.
---
Doesn't even deny it...
---
Wow that's sad.
---
this photoshop job is done exceptionally well
---
But his new kit is the addon of the hag which no ones uses for good reasons and being able to teleport at generators with part of his kit only working when people are asleep.
---
Except for the 5% movement speed why would anyone pick new Freddy over the Hag?
---
Freddy will get pallet looped without any kind of stall now.
---
Doesn‚Äôt even need a special effect, it‚Äôs so bad even just making tokens easier to get would make it leagues better
---
Same prob but with my gf, hard to watch that type of devour hope
---
Yeah have fun man. Feel free to link mine though.
---
Crows and grass, that's the best you have. Also try to work on the gen from a side she won't expect so she can't grab you. It's not alot, but it's the best we have.
---
This is the best example of what I mean when I say people who disconnect early like this hurts both the other survivors and the killer.
---
Everybody gets less points everybody gets less of an emblem score. There really needs to be a lot more of a punishment for disconnecting
---
Im not saying most of the roster is unplayable. But take what you from it i guess?
---
Game development is about prioritisation and bot everythings gonna come out as good as you think it will. I don't understand why you are getting up in arms about something thats not gonna change until other things are. Every killer has a rank cap.
---
If you're always going down in one hit, why would you want a perk that requires you to get hit? You will most likely die long before you even build up enough stack to trigger MoM. And since No Mither prevents you from healing, self-care becomes literally unusable.
---
Yeah. The types of people who think you're hacking are usually terrible at the game. They can't conceive the reason you keep finding them is because you see them around corners, hear them nearby, whatever it may be. Because they themselves are too stupid to know how to do such things.
---
I get it a lot when I see a dumbass claudette waddling around and then hiding behind a tree. I walk straight to her, straight around the tree and get her.
---
"How did you see me I wasn't making any noise and was fully hidden"
---
Hell, it happened last night on F13 as well. Some girl crouched by a rock waiting for cops, and while shifting I immediately see her bright ass character illuminated by the moonlight, and against the backdrop of a much darker coloured rock. So I shift right in front of her and catch. No "gg" after the game. Instead she immediately starts interrogating me like I'm the prime suspect of a murder case. "How did you see me? I had &lt;x excuse&gt;!"
---
It's all bullshit. I have no patience for those "hackusation" morons. In fact it makes me angrier than people trolling me.
---
As for no kills, bad luck man. Can happen a lot if the survivors know what they're doing, doesn't always have to be SWF. Game has some balancing issues for sure.
---
MFW I noticed Freddy in the back
---
Your accusation about my fake second account is just as believable as your math equation for this thread. Lol what a joke
---
I mean I've gotten shit for nodding at survs so.....
---
thank you random reddit man you have convinced me I will take it off my R1 huntress because time definitely isn't the most important factor in the game
---
exactly why I use it, with the lower reload time addons it can be devastating
---
I love those and I collect them.
---
I wish there was a perk that did this if you teabagged at the exit gates
---
It‚Äôs to disorient the Survivor.
---
There's a reason why Shackles is a bad add-on, the disorientation is extremely important in chase and you have to place your traps in a way that the survs run into walls/corners, she would be soooo much worse at shutting down loops like the Shack or just some BS windows without it because the phantasms dont have collission so the survs can just run over them.
---
I mean huntress is really fun ngl plus she seems easily counterable. Every killer has their weaknesses. Some killers are for beginner players. Not every killer can be like billy, nurse etc. Some killers have to be weaker in order for a new player to learn the basics.
---
You shut the fuck up, Mr Alt.
---
I'm flaming everyone in this forum post, because this entire thing is a waste of everyone's time
---
Some dickhead is out here complaining about 2 meters, which translates to barely 2.5 seconds, but that makes the killer is "literally unplayable". please.
---
Which is to say, spot on?
---
I never thought I'd see the day
---
Rusty shackles plus mint rag op what u talking about
---
the ghost face isn't even on sale right?
---
NOED has two fundamental requirements in order to work: 
---
1) the doors must be powered.
---
2) the dull totem carrying the hex must be standing.
---
It's not too far fetched to assume that the players struggling with NOED are the ones ignoring totems and going for the generators only.
---
Even though it‚Äôs a completely understandable mistake and there‚Äôs nothing you can possibly do about it, we always shit on the one of us who triggered it, when this happens it inspires pure fear
---
They don't stop existing, but survivors stop being bad enough that they're useful.
---
Dont believe that was a **nice** attempt. man got no kills. it was *an* attempt
---
The icing on the cake is you getting points for ‚Äúdestruction‚Äù when you walk out the gate lmao
---
Back in the day you could click on names to change your text color... Devs pls fix.
---
it's a meme, only good for camping.
---
I'm actually a doctor main with over 4K hours that won 3 of the twitch tournaments and what I suggested would make him stronger in the hands of a good player... If you're a braindead doctor user yes you will have trouble. You're just blinded by the idea to have a buff AND a nerf.

I play both survivor and killer and it‚Äôs sad how many time I get kills with NOED - I failed to protect the generators and I get rewarded with free kills lol I don‚Äôt feel good about it but I use it in every build because of how effective it is.
---
Can u actually make a pack of nea karlsson perks or at least give the psd please ?
---
Tbh we can imagine it's Robert since all he does is laughing and moaning, lol. New Nightmare cosmetics would be perfect tho.
---
Okay, you're either trolling or you really don't understand how No Mither works. I'm assuming the former but just in case, No Mither causes you to start the game injured and makes it so you can't become uninjured. You can't heal in any way, and you will always by put into the dying state after getting by the killer's attack.

Ye Ik but I don‚Äôt do that

Honestly, the new Fredwardo looks really interesting. Definitely more like a dream demon now than before.
---
There is no purpose in running Fervent Chase. The perk doesn't do anything. I would at least swap that one for Sloppy Butcher.
---
If you play Dwight you must. I bet you're sitting in a locker right now
---
That was a great watch really convinced me that there is going to be a DBD / stranger things deal made xD
---
I just want balance for both sides and I incur the wrath of both sides :c
---
Could unrelenting 3 do?
---
And don't forget, a healthy and micro-asleep survivor needs to wake you. If your all asleep or on a minute timer to fall asleep then what's the point to even being awake?
---
Why is that just simple Dwight logic üòÇüòÇ

Wow. Good points. Name calling and insults. Still doesn't counter the fact that that is a red rank with the most points in the match. 4 meta perks. A toolbox with sabotage add-ons. And oh yeah... A rank 20 killer with one perk. Just also mentioning that they probably were on comms and all that fun stuff.
---
Rank 20 to rank 16 are for NEW players LEARNING the game (see? I can use capitalization to look intelligent as well.)
---
There is no reason a red rank should be going against a rank 20. That shit discouraged me when I was new and still hasn't been fixed. I regularly see high rank survivors in a survive with friends group with low rank friends so they can fully easier killers and look good on live streams or get easy points.
---
I could at least understand the "lack of players excuse" if there was a green rank or yellow rank going against this killer but rank 4 going against rank 20 is fucking absurd and inexcusable.
---
And yeah I'll admit I've played survive with friends with lower-ranked friends before to show them the ropes. (Back during the moon rise event and winter solstice)
---
 But the difference is I make sure all three of them get out and I left the killer kill me because I feel bad walking all over a newer player or a killer who's not as good. I don't let two of my Noob friends die, bully the low rank killer and Escape. 
---
But oh boy. I'm ready to be downvoted by people who only play survive with friends and have never played more than four or five matches as killer. Or I'm ready to have the toxic side of the community downvote and insult me without raising any points of Their Own. Enjoy taking criticism as a personal insult and attacking those with dissenting opinions.
---
Oh ok I think I understand I won't use no mither because it sounds pretty bad now that I think about sorry if I was annoying
---
It's gonna be Hopper to be sure, Fortnite added two skins, the demogorgon and Chief Hopper. I assume DbD is gonna recieve the same treatment.

That brought a smile to my face. I'm glad you felt the need to share that.
---
It's Sims 4.
---
I‚Äôm lost
---
Yup its on ps4 only atm so I'm tryna stay away from playing tbh
---
*drops pallet at Pig*
---
i ran into one speed hacker. It was kind of funny since he was so fast that you were able to juke him and lost him fairly easily.
---
Glass Bead. Uncommon Map Addon
---
Run thanaphobia (I think thats how you spell it not sure, but if you're confused I'm talking about the Nurse Teachable that starts with T lmao)
---
well why do you guys say that i said something about what you said ?
---
the point is that the 99% last for too long
---
Its funny to see half the people on this comment section complain about how powerful he is now and the other half complains about how shit hes become
---
HAHAH LOUD FUNNY!!
---
Considering the art they created shows the Left 4 Dead outfits alongside Bill i'd say it's safe to assume they will be thrown in too. The only thing i'm not sure about is those black and red L4D shirts.
---
This comment right here proves that this post is more of a crybaby rant then it is about the killer.  the point of this game for surviors is to run away from the killer, work on gens and escape.  if you don't know how to use wraith then don't use him simple as that.  they have perks, add one and reworks for a reason. I would say don't hate the player hate the game, but in this case it's the player that made himself look like the kid who cried wolf. #getgoodoruninstall
---
Aw, the alt thinks he matters. Cute.
---
Gets downed once: DC
---
This.
---
Thanks for convincing me i will never learn how to draw
---
:) That's really nice of them. 
---
Honestly, I haven't bought myself a single thing during the sale, but I've bought like 10 friends games. It feels great to give.
---
I don't care u pathetic cunt. Get over it
---
Thanks but it‚Äôs such a waste to use it tho
---
My one question is why does it actually look like he‚Äôs smiling
---
I guess but I would use some and keep one
---
True but goddamn plus it me amazing to have a hundred lmao
---
Wait what? Doesn‚Äôt fens min come with the game and isn‚Äôt David free??
---
Feng isnt free, but David and Huntress are free on console but you have to download them I believe. I may be wrong, I play PC.
---
I couldn‚Äôt see it working but will instantly buy if it came true
---
You shouldn't compare yourself to other artists especially because everyone grows at different speeds and ways. If been drawing for the past 6 years to get here. You'll grow on your own time if you give yourself patience.
---
Trapper, Hillbilly, Meg, Dwight and Claudette are the only free characters on DbD mobile. Even Jake and Wraith you have to pay for. Every character can be bought with shards though
---
GAMER BILL
---
A lot of the early achievements will happen quickly.
---
No One Left Behind, It Wakes, Getting the Hang of it, Apt Survivor, Risk It All, Skillful, and Vulture should all happen pretty quickly.
---
I personally enjoyed aiming for adept survivor achievements, which involve surviving using only a specific survivors unique perks, but you did say you like David and his is the hardest as "No Mither" is hard mode.
---
Can‚Äôt really be naive about it when the results for me say otherwise.
---
it's almost as if you're wrong, you complete and total dickhead
---
fam I saw the exact play time in the steam overlay
---
It had the seconds too but it was gonna sound too fucking specific.
---
And my Nat type is just fine, thank you
---
I have more then 40 of each pink addon and 40 mories B) But I will probobly only play a little bit since I'm a big fan of stalking.
---
and nobody knows how long ill be stuck in hell for, great
---
Susue &gt;
---
you both hide in there and play Viva Pinata until the match is over
---
Dwight packs you a little party bag with some cake and thanks you for coming, and you both step over your teammates' corpses as you leave the locker and go home
---
Omg that got me! ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Spot the survivor main
---
Thanksssssss
---
DS is personally in a really good spot compared to what it was, there is an even bigger balancing issue removing this perk from usable ones. The perk is designed to stop people from dying within the span of 30 seconds because someone decided to unhook in front of the killer and the killer being a dick aswell immediately punish the hooked player to gain a game advantage, or a killer tunneling off of hook regardless of when saved. Honestly if a survivor is downed they are doing as much there as on the hook and it usually takes another person to bring them up taking another person off generators. You do not have to pick up every person you down. As for the locker play with it, personally it depends on how quick you can find someone else or choose to take the stun because otherwise you get left on the floor to do nothing but crawl because the killer doesn't wanna get stabbed.
---
"Ok I'm just gonna go for the save I'm pretty sure he's gon-""HEEEHURRRHEEURRRRR CUMMIERE CHEECKY BOI" *player has evactuated bowels* *player has disconnected*
---
I liked old Freddy.  I like new Freddy.  I honestly don‚Äôt see why people hate him so much.
---
Who said anything about them being as string as they used to be?
---
A few bnp and good toolboxes and the gens can go fast. If you think these items are weak you‚Äôre terribly misinformed.
---
Agreed. 32 seconds to heal yourself or 16 seconds for somebody else to heal you. 1 survivor per 32 or 2 per 16, still totals 32 seconds of survivor time. However finding the other survivor is rarely instant (and sometimes they take their time to start healing you) so it ends up being more than 32 total survivor seconds. 
---
Not to say self-care is amazing, but it‚Äôs very useful, especially solo queue.
---
Yes, but sleep just doesn't really do a lot.
---
If they DC they didn't lose. 
---
"Checkmate, killer!"
---
Are Dwights also incapable of ending a sentence with a full stop?
---
then it gives you a free sprint burst to get to a gate very quickly :)
---
If I remember correctly it was the lowest ranked survivor
---
Actually, there are some Freddy mains unhappy with the rework.
---
Or every six weeks after a chapter release.
---
Except pig and tapp
---
Yummy
---
Can't please everyone I guess. This is mostly for the ones who are looking forward to the rework.
---
You say that but legion exists
---
The other survivors were Claudette(s) and Nea
---
I down the survivor at the same moment the gen near a door pops,as I‚Äôm picking the survivor I try to see which gen it was.
---
I hook the survivor at the farthest point possible from the doors.
---
After I go on this hill trying to see the doors I‚Äôm staying there for a good 10 seconds and take a gamble going for the left Gate.
---
Since it was endgame she couldn‚Äôt had tried the save,one of them would‚Äôve died since it was too far.
---
And that is where the video starts,I really wished I took a longer video,but for me that moment felt like an eternity and ended in a flash.
---
Maybe check a vod, he did it the other night
---
He's a halfie, I think.  His eyes are light blue.  How many full blooded Asians have blue eyes?
---
This kills the me.
---
In my experience 80% of them do it on purpose. They know that you found the hatch but they want to take revenge because you did not unhook them. They are hoping that the killer finds you.
---
I'm thinking BBQ/Tinkerer/Rancor/M&amp;A or Ruin, ultimate map control.  We'll see if rancor is really needed or could be replaced with something else, but I feel like this could be devastating.
---
I played with him earlier today, pulled full toxicity out when we got beaten by a really decent Nurse, even tried pulling a Ninja calling the dude a stream sniper.
---
I'm ready for shirtless billy
---
As a Killer main that only played survivor for Daily‚Äôs, I‚Äôd like to address my fellow brethren. As a killer main goal for continued play is BETTER THY SELF in order for that to happen ur going to need bloodpoints aka ps, the more the better so here‚Äôs 2 tips that killers and believe it or not SURVIVORS will appreciate. 
---
&gt;NEVER CAMP&lt;.           &gt;NEVER TUNNEL&lt;, as a matter of fact keep track of how many hooks each survivor has try to get 2 in all 4 before going for 3. When I see that the hooks down I ALWAYS look for the UN-hooker if I can‚Äôt find them but see the other 1 limpin around I‚Äôll down him the let them heal him. It‚Äôs the only way Iv figures out how to get a perfect score. 8K in all 4 categories. Got 2 so far and like 15-16 where I‚Äôm shy 300-50 points from perfect. Plus survivors enjoy the game more and will actually message you gg here and there. Ohh bout 4 got. There is actually 1 time campings ok, ok 2, 1 is room full of drunk friends deceived let‚Äôs get Leatherface &amp; screw with people lol. The only acceptable time to camp is end of game exit gates open, even then I‚Äôll give them a little bit of wiggle room. I hate when survivors complain about it. Think about it what else would the killer do just turn and run the opposite direction. Anyway hope this helps a few people of the fog to have longer games &amp; in turn more bps &amp; less SURVIVO-AGRO.
---
Billy had to play all the loops and attempt mindgames, most of the really high tier killers don't have to do that to get downs.
---
Wraith never was fine back then. 
---
Now, he is just a "loopable Spirit". Better than before, but still weak in red ranks.
---
Ofc except for the licensed characters
---
Run Sloppy
---
Call me when you get to 2 hours like me :(
---
This happened to me today. I just happened to come across it and the other hooked person was waaay across the map. I thought they were going to kill themselves cause they attempted escape but they stayed and struggled and after I got a message saying ' you should have gotten me'
---
Idk bout that.  For me bottom three are trapper, wraith and Freddy.  Not necessarily in that order
---
LOL as clown I literally will hook someone and go across the map and STILL get called a "noob camper \*bleep bleep bleep bleep\*"  
---
Doesn't matter how you play, how close the game was, how generous, how mean, doesn't matter. If someone gets killed there's a good chance they will be salty. I've literally only seen survivors say "gg" when they win excluding a few rare people. Almost makes you WANT to play kind of toxic, but nope I don't and I still say gg after every game.
---
Although the people who spam flicker light and teabag while looping me for 1 minute+... those people are definitely getting "tunneled", not facecamped but if I see someone unhook you I am going after you, not the person who unhooked. Even when it wouldn't benefit me. Always going for the flicky flick person.
---
Like no shit I am going to go back to the person on hook right before their time is up
---
I guess you have to be playing both sides to see our point!
---
I think this game has the most Reoccurring pattern of ‚Äúnot everyone‚Äôs pleased‚Äù
---
Would I be able to play the game on mobile with a iPhone 6?
---
It goes both ways though. As survivor I had a decent game against hag last night and actually a managed to loop and escape a few times, rare, I say gg and they leave. Happens almost every time I have a decent game against a killer.
---
I'm a shitty noob killer and always say gg even when I get demolished by swf that somehow spin away from all my hits. I don't know how they do that. It's not a 360 but kind of a curving loop and one guy avoided like 4 of my hits, never seen anything like it.
---
Anyway, I still say gg and then there's the abuse from that too.
---
This game attracts nice people but dicks too, a fair proportion of dicks.
---
I have a question. The mid season patch is in ... like a month? Why does everybody already freaking out and doesn't postpone freaking out to when the patch actually goes live?
---
That can be said about a lot of online games as well. Star Wars Battlefront 2 for another example the developers are constantly changing and reworking the game because people ask for it, but there's always people who get really mad about the change.
---
alright
---
Might be a lil unpopular to say, but I would LOVE to see Billy as survivor. He isn't a main, and he would fit really well into the universe for a couple reasons (that I won't share b/c spoilers). 
---
Give me Billy Hargrove as a survivor.
---
I meet a nice spirit killer once, decimated my team b4 1 generator was done I was runnin Wild he cought me. Took me right to a generator, The the rest of them. Let me open crates, drop a few pallets even carried me to the gate as I opened it I thought ok this guy deserves the last kill but no. He uh said nope. I stood there for at least 45 seconds with him staring right at me saying dude DO IT lol kill me. It doesn‚Äôt seem fair escaping. I mean not only did you let me repair every. Generator you had to go enter ‚ÄúMother Theresa‚Äù kindness by carrying me to each one. My shoes are clean as FU#^ bro. But I slowly walked away.... I miss her... lol
---
Would I be able to play it on a iPhone 6
---
is that a.... Golden adrenaline?! :O
---
Is it at least easier to get shards on mobile
---
We need one of those movie montages.
---
Just need the right perks and you can consistently hit 4k shit at EWI i get at least two hooks before EWII.
---
You let the person that did the least in the game leave? This is why I don't let people escape cause I feel bad, in a lot of the cases they are the survivor who are less experienced, they tend to not help teammates cause they are affair and just hide in a corner all game.
---
Nah, its the same. You get them by leveling up like in normal DbD. Though the grind for leveling up your own character is less. You almost always level up after 1 game unless you died early.
---
this is photoshop! we all know that matchmaking is never perfect &gt;:(
---
I‚Äôd think so! Using my iPhone 7 and it runs flawless for the most part, after 4 or 5 games it starts to stutter so I let it rest for a few and it‚Äôs good again
---
Obvi it drains battery lol
---
It's almost as I'm not wrong, go ask anyone that has some clue how to play the game and you'll see that iron maiden is one of the most useless perks you can get, even on Huntress
---
But i still laughed at OP's meme cause big true.
---
why is troll face one of offerings
---
Patience and logic? In my DbD community? Too OP, pls nerf.
---
oh god oh fuck.  [**XK Class** End of the World **Scenario**](http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-762332/xk-class-end-of-the-world-scenario)
---
we mean **L I T E R A L L Y** stole her heart
---
Lmao especially when you run that aura reading add on!
---
I am a killer main and I agree, Hook Vaccum needs to go
---
Get Monitor &amp; Abuse (Doctor teachable perk) it will let you get closer to survivors before they know you‚Äôre there and the reduced distance can be the difference between taking advantage of EW3 or not.
---
I find BBQ pretty useless on the hag except for bloodpoint farming. The hag usually doesn't have the speed to benefit from the aura tracking.
---
All your other stuff is cool imo
---
Some alternatives you might consider:
---
Make your choice: 
---
You often can get back to the hook quick enough to down the unhooker
---
A Nurse's Calling:
---
Esp. With monitor and abuse essentially survivors healing is revealed before they hear your terror radius so nice for surprising them
---
Save the Best For Last:
---
If you are like me and usually try swing as soon as you teleport, this doesn't punish you as badly if you miss.
---
I‚Äôm not sure on their live stream They said only for iPhone 6s or higher So I‚Äôm not sure if i can play it
---
The killer doesn't dare come near. That's a power looper stance.
---
The only issue I think would be that rights for stranger things would probably cost a looooot... fortnite has hella money, much more than DBD does so they have a slightly easier time getting accommodations like stranger things
---
DON'T TELL ME THAT "THAT" BUG IS BACK
---
*BREATHS IN MYERS.*
---
Nea always looking for the floor door.
---
You know that doesn't mean anything? Nobody noticed any downsides from using range addons
---
Sluggy slugaroo. I approve.
---
Yeah, just got destroyed with that setup, so I will put that on,
---
Steam sale is on but the Ghostface is not on sale so?
---
That person is wrong, why attempt escape if you want to be rescued ?
---
Sure a 5%-4% of self unhook could happen,but I‚Äôm not a believer.
---
Just got done with a game, 4 am here so guess who is online! A 4 man group of sweaty weebs, all have feng ming skins, all but 1 had purple flashlights, all weeb pfps, they hit every pallet, just really good players. I can respect that but why teabag and flicker the flashlights? Very frustrating   
---
I get what you are saying but it's just not fair to treat every killer like that just cause you have had bad experiences before. Like I said above, I have those toxic shitty matches ALL the time, yet I still go into every match playing like normal and just try to have a fun game.  
---
The worst part is survivors are able to act toxic like that and still easily win against people who aren't as good (like me, I am only killer rank 10 ATM been trying clown out, but they were all 3,3,5 and 8)... meanwhile a killer could be toxic and facecamp anyone, but in the end he gets punished for it and depips. So by default it's usually the survivors being the douchbags because there is literally no reason for them not to be toxic, not to mention the game is already in their favor... it's just a shitty situation all around, the game definitely attracts some of the worst people.  
---
TL:DR- Being a toxic survivor has no drawbacks and only benefits them (ex getting killer heated so he plays worse), 
---
while being a toxic killer can be a drawback (if he facecamps 1 person in theory the other 3 survivors should get all gens done, and then killer de-pips anyways)
---
They may not lose, but the killer sure does win
---
Boolin on the generator
---
I get downed all the time; I figure I may as well struggle and stay on the hook as long as possible so that my team has a little bit more time to finish gens. Just stay on the hook and get your blood points mates.
---
Yeah if they tea bag me like that I focus them, not because I'm mad but I like to punish their cockiness. The last one quit. It sucks when they get away with it which they do against me as I'm pretty crap.
---
See I am running M&amp;A on the Wraith. Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing so much better.
---
I'm really interested to see how he plays out.  I enjoy playing him but he's a liability once you start sniffing red ranks.  He's actually really strong right now in low ranks.
---
I hope so, I love that Zoey sweater
---
Currently rank 12 and oh boy, the SWFs are swarming in. Good luck mate!
---
U dc what a bitch
---
Yep exactly the same situation man
---
When I play survivor my team mates are always the urban evasion/spine chill fuckers
---
As soon as I switch to killer everyones running round having fun, like where tf were you guys 5 minutes ago?
---
Yikes ebony moris for all!I have one for you,and you,everyone gets a mori.imma basement trapper and people are potatoes when it comes to the basement.
---
It happens way too often
---
That‚Äôs interesting. I‚Äôm by no means a skilled player (I think I‚Äôm about rank 12) but I would have thought M&amp;A wasn‚Äôt necessary on Wraith with his cloaking, but if it works for you then fair enough lol.
---
Im guilty of that. But only if the person is a complete cunt the entire game.
---
I mean game just kicked me out of lobby that doesn't make me a bitch wtf lol, i wanted to ask him tho
---
It would be good to have it. But this fella here is broke AF
---
Big sad
---
Where am I suppose to spend my blood points?  With Ghostface, Freddy Rework, other characters I'm trying to prestige/unlock perks...I don't know what to do.  Now you're telling me Bill is here?  
---
I use to blendette because most of the survivors were boring.  Between Ash, Thicc girl, Shirtless David and now Bill we're finally getting some character.
---
We need another bloodpoint event!!!
---
BT doesn't need a rework, and i say that as a killer main - you should always attack and re-down the unhooked survivor.
---
The other one only gets hit if they get in the way, thus negating the perk and punishing them for unhooking while nearby.
---
And even if it DID, NOED does *not* need a rework. Literally don't ignore a game mechanic.
---
Oh shit you‚Äôre right, I just checked the AppStore and it says it doesn‚Äôt support iPhone 6. Sorry :(
---
lol noob killer fking tunneler -rep
---
S**he's** br**ok**en because s**he** **D**is**c**onntecte**d**
---
I‚Äôm hoping this would be a cosmetic
---
Enduring doesnt even affect DS anymore so there's no real counter.
---
The Devs are doing such a great job.  Who would have thought we'd have such an enjoyable horror game to play that includes old favorites like Ash, Freddy, Leatherface, Bill, Pig, Ghostface, ect?
---
I'm so glad the devs bought the rights and have fully committed to its future.
---
Same. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
---
*Chainsaw revs in distance*

it wasnt a fast vault .... it was just his add ons

If you're memeing with nurse, you need to try teleporting outside of a closed exit gate and sit there the whole match waiting with insidious and NOED.
---
Lol
---
Extra context: Laurie farmed me for deliverance and she dead harded out as soon as she unhooked.
---
I'd also call that a tunnle and a bad killer

if you don't you are exposed for 3 minutes.

S**he's** br**ok**en because s**he** **D**is**c**ontine**d** Chilli.

It's not the killer's fault that he gets a free kill for survivors stupidity/toxicity.
---
No problem mate it is not your fault Hoping They Will support iPhone 6 over a few months
---
Alert is used more for info around the map, but if the killer comes at you and kiks the gen that you are working on, i guess lightweight is a good perk to come along because you have a chance to hide and he will focus on gen and you make Alert better. What do you think? U should try
---
You're not wrong but he could of done the nice thing and just slugged her
---
Is there a freddy discord or something?
---

---
I like using bigger skillcheck add ons on insta-heal medkits, lol.
---
I asked him to facecamp the Laurie after I died, and facecamp he did. Tunneling is sometimes just a logical tactic, you can't blame a killer for doing something which falls under common sense.
---
Or you could try that Adam perk with a pebble, so if the killers kiks the gen and stays around, u trow the pebble in a different direction, cause you see his aura
---
The reflection in the sunglasses is a great touch
---
Let me guess, you also T-bag as Claudette?
---
Yeah the other guy said literally too? I know what it means, still adorable.
---
I've had a decent bit of ranking fuckery, and with 0 coordination. SWF isnt as common as everyone thinks. And also, all you're getting is the ability to communicate via voice. If you stay patrolling gens, most survivors, SWF or no can be found and taken out. Like I said, ranking is broken. I get matched up with rank 20 killers all day in solo queue. 
---
Also, I'm going to add I'm a killer main.
---
At least you got revenge on the Laurie but with how early in the game it was still a bit of a dick thing to do I'd understand if maybe 2 or 3 gens where done but 1 come on
---
It fits... perfect.
---
*better watch out sucka now I got you where I want ya*
---
Bashing the entirety of reddit because someone voiced their opinion that another variation of the art would be cool seems pretty set off to me
---
Both are ugly as frick
---
all the more reason, I practically died because of her and the Ash within a minute of the first hook when only one gen was done, I even got depipped for it (which idrc about), you get the point.
---
I saw people doing it for the "fair deranking", like if they play the whole match and DC at the end, then it's not scummy.
---
Please don‚Äôt
---
He killed the guy who did the least. The rank 20 did more than the rank 16.
---
Thank you
---
I mean at the end of the day it's just a game and the Laurie got what she deserves so
---
BBQ for Hag is pointless, she's too slow and you will just get distracted by auras ;) unless you really want points
---
This shit with Thanataphobia is hilarious.
---
yeah, I guess you're right
---
Sadly personal server choices can end up with ping abusers in other games, hopefully nobody sees any benefit to it in this game
---
please dont expose me :(
---
the killer is kind of a dick too, with 4 gens left he decided to tunnel you instead of going after the other 2 assholes + that's why you should always bring DS instead of Small Game
---
Yeah he's basically just Waterlogged Shoe Hag, her worst add-on, with a teleport every 45 seconds. I can't see him being great tbh.
---
Steve the fucking boss man.
---
Community doesn‚Äôt seem to hate it yet, but im sure someone will
---
I died right on hook, DS wouldn't have done mich good + small game is too good for Ruin/Devour hope/Noed...
---
Dedicated servers should be out with the next chapter.
---
What, because the killer should just let you get away and heal? Fuck out of here.
---
Why are they dogshit? Ruin gives her time to set traps and Pop lets her regress gens
---
That actually looks pretty scary and cool.
---
Shackles are great now that they're not broken and don't give terror radius.
---
Oh wow, I'm so scared. How about you bring up any kind of valid point instead?
---
Because Hag doesn't play like that. Ruin is best for killers who need to get something going early, Hag doesn't. The first 1-3 gens are completely irrelevant since as Hag you're laying your web and can usually end the game in about 2 minutes after getting your 10 traps on the ground, Hag by nature doesn't care to regress gens and CI is superior to Ruin if you actually care about the early gens as it funnels the survivors towards your web. 
---
Hag's power is in how fast she can spiral the game, anything that happens before your snowball starts is irrelevant and kicking gens is a waste of time when you could be downing survs instead.
---
It works with Hex: The Third Seal as well, this he‚Äôs causes blindness, you can get everyone really quickly with it, though it‚Äôs a niche perk but it‚Äôs interesting and works well with Legion.
---
You can start by doing the same!
---
Now i want Jim Pickens in DbD, thanks.
---
Rank 13 and run Meyers/Ghostyboi, Spies from the shadows helps quite a bit, also running iron grasp and not sure what else
---
There is a reason of why you only see spirit nurse and billy on red ranks this game is Balanced around green ranks try 2 derank
---
Look out guys we got a professional "balancer" here.
---
Pig op please nerf lol
---
Blindly supporting the developers when they don't give a single shit about anyone in the community..
---
Even if the cosmetics were cheap, I'd not buy them to "support" the devs.
---
I'd probably drop BBQ for Nurse's Calling, and two Range add-ons is unnecessary for the vast majority of situations, but otherwise it's good. I'm not a fan of Ruin but I don't think it's a bad choice necessarily.
---
Hag main here, drop bbq, as Hag the first thing you should be doing is laying a trap, not hooking, turning around looking for auras then laying a trap, wastes to much time, she‚Äôs also to slow they‚Äôll be gone by the time you get to them across map.
---
Freddy was the most annoying killer to play against imo. There was nothing fun fighting his kit, but this rework, I am excited for. Now I should only hate Doc.
---
OK. I will. 
---
7 Second sleep time is now completely scrapped. Thank fucking GOD.  
---
Freddy is now more of a somewhat stealth killer revealing himself in a meter range giving his Monitor and Abuse build a bit more strength  
---
Freddy NOW has the ability to TELEPORT TO FUCKING GENS saving him SO MUCH TIME  
---
Freddy can now combat loops by placing down things called Dream Tears and not only that, can even reveal the survivor if they run over it.  
---
He will have an addon that replaces dream tears with dream pallets similar to that of the Doctor which is such a nice fake out addon.  
---
I don't know what you were expecting mate but by the looks of it, you're gonna get fucking DRAGGED! ;)
---
And your comment adds something constructive in what way? Lame troll attempt!
---
That‚Äôs true. I am not sure either. I‚Äôll have to test it out.
---
I see a cat, I upvote. I'm a simple human being.
---
Well the game is free so they have to lock more things than usual
---
Use the skills you've learned. Exploit loops, Moonwalk. As a Former survivor main turned killer main i believe in you. 
---
I still play survivor to keep up dem skills doe.
---
&gt;zubat
---
ohh going against the grain here. Careful, you might break the echo chamber.
---
It‚Äôs required against good survivors, it can be used to pulls people away from loops/pallets.
---
It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt call anything toxic I think it‚Äôs dumb to do something call it toxic so the other side doesn‚Äôt do it toxic community‚Äôs is why I leave games
---
We got it, girl
---
It hasn‚Äôt come out yet
---
One thing that always gets me is when I'm struggling and the killer is camping, I keep struggling because I want to give the other survivors killer-free time to get shit done, but I also feel bad since I don't want them thinking I'm expecting them to rescue me.
---
I just report them then move on. Nothing you can really do.
---
I don't like CI on Hag. If you push survivors towards your web, they will see you putting traps and survivors will disable them when you are unable to teleport or destroy them with flashlights. Also, CI can help survivors to not 3 gen themselves and 3 gen strats are very strong with Hag. They are not needed, but you shouldn't help survivors to not doing them.
---
Why not
---
Big if true.
---
It's usually two or three. Those two partnered with a rank 17 friend so that means they would get matched with someone your rank.
---
I've seen 2 red ranks and a rank 20 going against a rank 20 killer. And of course they trashed talked afterwards.
---
 Unbelievable the developers haven't done anything about this. Survive with friends should match with the highest ranked player on the team.
---
Bruh ive been getting salt ive been told I tunnel even tho I go after unhooked 1 guy escapes I get shit talked about I'm trash from a ded survivor.is only game why you have to be mad?
---
Endgame confuses me tho. So adrenaline wakes you up. And it takes 60 seconds to passively fall asleep. So endgame he‚Äôs fucked and has to wait a minute to hit them? Or am I totally off
---
Has agreed
---
Hag makes me wanna die
---
It could've been him lagswitching, your own connection, dead hard, or you just simply missed every time.
---
Those are the only reasons I can think of
---
I had a dumb af nea do exactly this yesterday.. Refused the we'll make it heal and proceeded to self-care with no medkit...
---
Luuuuuuuul
---
Never happened to me before but ive seen it happen to a baby bill in my team. Poor guy, he was so innocent
---
Makes you see all survivors within a 32 meter radius
---
That's even more awesome. I'm feeling really happy now. :)
---
I wish console had more people like this. Not just on DBD but on any game. I only know two people who have ever been kind enough to give random shit to people. One of them has spent a few thousand USD on his friends, including me, in the past few months alone and he works far too hard for really bad pay. I have so much respect for him, and as soon as I have a job I'm gonna do the same for my friends, him included, just to make peoples' days like he does. God knows some people need their days fixed.
---
This is actually pretty good. A bit cringe but the writing is really good.
---
I don‚Äôt quite agree with you there because then the newest player will most likely die and have a poor experience. I would say they should try to put it in the middle ground but then that you just cause both problems.
---
Nice! Really helpful for me since I suck at flashlights saves
---
All the survivors are the exact same and it's not crazy to imagine people liking 1 killer more than the rest
---
Would be a cool looking killer ngl, always wished a more monster-like killer in dbd
---
yeah this just feels like in game ads to me. i wouldnt want to see that everytime lol, plus whenever they do add content to the store they put in the content news so we see it anyway, just not everytime we load in.
---
Yeah that is pretty much happened to me. I was so confused because I was rank 8 and i was like how is this nurse thats not blinking able to like find me and not get lost?
---
Nurses calling or im all ears?
---
I love Feng, but I honestly think the head piece is the only good part of this cosmetic.
---
Yikes, insulting a teenager based on her looks.
---
People just bitch to bitch. Just ignore him !
---
Happens all the time!
---
Aiight.
---
Most of the time, any player that plays DbD frequently knows about new characters far before they are released. While yes the News tab comes up after the character was JUST released, this idea is ment for very casual or new players who are probably out-of-the-loop.
---
New or very casual or players may not know about what characters were released a month ago and they definitely aren't guaranteed to scroll through **all** the past news or even bother visiting the store. 
---
*If a new or casual player have no intention of buying anything, they will not go to the store. The concept above not only guaranteed to informs* ***all*** *players about the latest characters, chapters, etc. But it also entices players that usually wouldn't even bother visiting the store to go look at the new characters and outfits.*
---
I‚Äôve been maining spirit recently with DH and Thrill.  This one person must have had the thrill at 99%. Because the moment I slapped them off of it.  They DC‚Äôd
---
You type like Trump.
---
Shhh you‚Äôre blowing the secret
---
A trade up system would be fucking great. 5 browns for a yellow? I'm fucking down. 5 is a lot but definitely worth it, I have wayyyy to many items/offerings I will NEVER use.
---
5 common &gt; 5 unc &gt; 5 rare &gt; 5 v rare &gt; for 1 ultra
---
While technically not worth it, atleast give us the option. 5 Rares for a purple? I'd do that any day.
---
At the current rate I'd have to play over 100 matches just to use up all this junk, while in the meantime 1 match is enough to buy ~5 more matches worth of stuff.... just doesn't make sense
---
lol you have to be braindead to get downed by bubba's chainsaw.... plus many survivors fake the pallet throw when you rev the chainsaw in a loop to get another extra loop. 
---
Freddy isnt a chase killer my guy, his power is supposed to stall the game. If no generators are being done, Freddy will win eventually. As freddy there are many factors that you have to keep in mind, like you need to know when to drop a chase, when you should put more survivors asleep, etc
---
You will find a lot of those TRASHY people, just play as you want to learn. If you play on console you can block the PM's, and if you play on PC you may should put your steam account on private, also you can disable the in-game chat by clicking on the "arrow" button it has
---
You completely missed out what I said about seeing the DLCs in game.
---
Unless it can be toggled on or off, the concept is going to irritate players.
---
Cool!
---
the best part of this is meg going down the background 
---
why did she not just run out lol you were blocking the huntress from getting her
---
It depends for me.  If I‚Äôm on my first hook and not being camped.   And they‚Äôre just camping the hatch.  you‚Äôre damn right imma let the killer go find them and the hatch rather than let them get away. Yesterday I came across a Quentin with only Kindred just crawling around the outside of the map the entire game. I purposefully stayed and spectated in hopes that they would get killed.
---
I just got "catch 3 survivors in bear traps"
---
Literally have never played trapper. Here we go
---
Nooo, clear screen is way better, I hate when stuff like that gets onto my screen
---
What did they even say?
---
Like I said, I'm only asking for the option of a FoV slider. Many games have it so it's not out of the question or a strange request. The extreme is thinking that by having the option to increase your FoV *(On option already shown threw a not very popular Killer perk)* would be game breaking. It's could be a possibility that if not tested, it could be game breaking, but it isn't logical to assume that the option existing what ultimately be game-breaking.
---
I can understand your first two points and I agree to your third to a point. I believe that rank doesn‚Äôt equate to skill rather experience and recent play time. And therefore it would make sense that purple ranks would have better perks than gray but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible for killer. I‚Äôve had countless games where I‚Äôve killed purple and red survivors. Everyone in the end is still human and we all make the same mistakes every now and then.  While I think Gray vs Purple and Red is indeed outrageous as these are still players learning the game they would probably have the best time matching these groups with green killers.
---
I am pretty sure that corrupt purge chase lasts much shorter then normal one hit chase
---
In the scenario you described i generally would also escape UNLESS:
---
* The hooked person is in my SWF
---
* I believe that i badly need more points to pip
---
The text the is coming out of the side would olny appear when giving over the icon. This way it wouldn't fill up the screen. Trust me, I would hate  the clutter too. :)
---
He‚Äôs just upset and salty no one comeback for him. 
---
But in the endgame sometimes it‚Äôs best to leave a teammate if your not confident with your skills to dodge the killer or he has Noed. 
---
You did nothing wrong at all. He just lost and probably didn‚Äôt pip. 
---
Yes it‚Äôs nice when people save in the endgame but you don‚Äôt have to. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to leave. Also depending on where the person got hooked. 
---
Guessing your rank I would say either 1 or both of you guys would‚Äôve died if you yourself went for the save. Don‚Äôt worry about that guy he‚Äôs just salty.
---
Wut
---
Is this and the other in the gallery? I'd love to use it!
---
What did he say lmao
---
Idea: give habitual dcers a tall ass dunce hat.
---
After writing this comment I realize toxic people will purposely dc to get this item and use it as extra taunt when looping killers while rank smurfing. NVM
---
I guess I have a lot to learn about Hag yet :D I mean, I was doing pretty decent with her but recently I fck everything up and get genrushed
---
No one said that
---
What? Punishing survivors from ruining other players game experience will kill the game?
---
Oh... sorry..  
---
I MEAN RANGE ADDONS ARE SO BAD AND INACCURATE WHO USES THAT SH\*T
---
*P Y R O C Y N I C A L  J O K E  D E T E C T E D*
---
Ill do better next time. No idea why you are being downvoted. I got the sarcasm lol.
---
It wasnt any of my friends. And can I ask what is pip?
---
I hope this helps find games faster as a killer waiting 10 mins is a turn off lol
---
The rework wouldve been good if it wasnt possible to wake up by failing a skillcheck
---
You could make the same argument for an game. Yes they may eventually see a DLC play out in-game, but it's much smarter on the game makers side, to not leave that up to chance. Not to mention that by having those tables there in the first place, it gives to view to played that something is always happening their the game.
---
Hmm so you lose offerings when you get hooked/die? Maybe that's why he was upset. üòî
---
Don't you have to accept a friend invite to be raided?
---
Maybe.. üòñüòÇ
---
Probably.
---
I know right? Smh too useless of an addon
---
I play on the playstation, yes. And after I tried to explain, and he was still ranting, I did block him.
---
You can gen tap so as not to get gengrabbed
---
I thought the same thing, I had to run so far to save him. And I know I would have died in order to try and save him that's for sure! And what is pip?
---
To be fair.. Rank 20 vs rank 8
---
Point in Progress
---
I can't imagine how that will work but right on
---
Ahw ok!
---
Forget the axe! GET A DOOR!

---
I don't understand. Is that a pc thing? I get killer matches in 2 seconds on ps4. I have trouble getting survivor matches.
---
Rank doesn't equal skill, so it doesn't really matter.
---
I only play survivor with other people now really.   Became a killer main during double bloodpoints when I realised how amazing BBQ is.
---
I'd say all three of those are the lower end of mid-tier, but definitely better than Doc, Pig and Legion.
---
Said that BHVR should add a KKK killer.
---
This is a really good Change, however now I‚Äôll be forced to deal with a killer that‚Äôs stealing their connection from the neighbors local dumpster.  It‚Äôs really the only time I justified disconnecting, when you can‚Äôt walk 5 feet to the gen in front of you from your spawn point. Lol
---
I..... I was under the impression there already was dedicated servers since a few months ago... my whole life is a lie. 
---
Is that why right before I was to hook some guy my Internet just cut out for like 2 minutes??? This has happened multiple times but my Internet is very stable.... what the fuck I've been booted from so many games then
---
Of course the fucking leatherface is basement camping
---
Holt shit that intro, thats horrible and as soon as I heard your bored voice I gave up
---
Someone came to my profile and wrote " Commit ropetide. " Don't know what that means, but hey, I'll take it.
---
Little do they know, they just spark my lust.
---
Exactly! They are full of shit and know that killer side is better for gaining BP during a DBP event then to top it put more of those gruesome gratues on the killers bloodweb for spawning more and where do you think the people will go? 
---
If you lined one side of the road for a mile with silver and the side with gold, which side do you think the people would flock to?
---
That's how it is now. My only complaint as a Freddy main is the balance between game start and end game with the auto 60sec sleep and the not able to teleport to completed gens.
---
Love the animorphs reference
---
True, but I also didn‚Äôt know what survivors were doing in total, I usually let the last one take the hatch.
---
I see what you did there!
---
I like territorial imperative Billy. It puts not stress on me to not run into a wall... Yet again.
---
Np mate.
---
Oml. Well then Tap and claud would be the only survivor to die
---
Not gonna lie, i‚Äôm gonna miss the old freddy. Sure he was underpowered and required good addons to be good, but ill always have a soft spot in my heart for him.
---
Thank you for the in-depth explanation, nice comment!\^\^
---
Although a lot of people heal against me for some reason in rank 6, (idk why) I tried out the spirit fury enduring build and I kinda like it, so thanks :D
---
Also I'm grinding bloodpoints to get Monitor&amp;Abuse as a teachable, and I saw some people use it on Legion, maybe that's worth a try?
---
So we're gonna have only Nurses, Spirits and Billies in red ranks, which is super boring to play. I love Spirit but having to play her all the time so as not to stress out and get teabagged in the gates is frustrating. I bought every single killer from this game and I want to play them in high ranks as well.
---
It wouldn't be smart, because as you can tell from the reactions to this concept, people would find it irritating.
---
I don;t think Hag drops off the list in rank 1
---
Waking each other up stacks 2 seconds each time, meaning survivors have to rely on themselves to wake themselves up. And like the Stefan said in the stream, the clock that you have to use to wake up will ALWAYS be the furthest away from you.   
---
Teleporting to survivors via gens is such a useful ability. It saves so much time rather than walking over to them. The cooldown is needed to prevent a case of Mint Rag Hag. You're not supposed to rely on the gen teleporting either. His power is like one massive kit, each providing bonuses in certain areas.  
---
If you think 15% slower speed is a bad thing, then damn, you have NOT been against a good Clown. The speed reduction REALLY shows and Sprint Burst is not the be all and end all strat to combat this. You're wasting a Sprit burst on ONE Dream Tear. That is such a stupid thing to do  
---
And finally, the fake pallets are a very nice touch as an addon. Similar to Tombstone Myers, Stealth M1 Doc and Crouching Pig. It offers a different style of play for a trade off.   
---
And in case you didn't figure it out yet, IT IS ONLY IN THE PTB STAGE. NOT ALL OF THIS IS FINAL DECISION. THEY WILL MAKE NEEDED CHANGES IF IT REQURED!  
---
I will reiterate. I don't know what you were expecting
---
Shit I thought it was pip just because it looked like an orange pip...
---
Increasing totem cleansing bps can't get here soon enough.  I've been the "Small Game" guy here lately just to freshen the game up for me and play a bit differently but you take an obvious sack to your bps for doing so.
---
I‚Äôm a rank one survivor. My boyfriend was new to the game a few months ago and is still a low rank because he doesn‚Äôt play much. Am I not allowed to play with him because the game can‚Äôt balance properly? Just coz they escaped doesn‚Äôt mean they bullied him. They could‚Äôve just been playing normally, considering they probably weren‚Äôt SWF they were bringing a build for a typical high rank game and then found this. Or even if they were SWF still bringing a normal build coz you expect there to be balance. You‚Äôre just mad at the game being broken and someone trying to play the game to then find out they were against a noob. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Now I know if I get a sabotage daily I can‚Äôt bring a sabo toolbox IN CASE I go against a low rank player, or that I can never SWF with my low rank friends again coz the game is broken.
---
What about kate
---
I love how the devs said: We want to create fun killers, not viable killers.  
---
How is unviable killer fun? How is knowing that "I'm playing Wraith so I;m gonna loose whatever my skills are if survivors are any goon" fun? I completely don't get it.
---
 I'm on xbox sometimes late at night I get like 2-3 mins but morning is horrible and anytime around 3-6 pm is horrible most of the time
---
I'm All Ears: 'am I a joke to you?'
---
What the actual guck no wonder when my group plays with just 1 new person all the killers are around rank 20...
---
Anytime someone fails a healing skill check while healing me, I jokingly say "thanks I appreciate that"
---
A fellow survivor was on last hook and got hit, I pull a pro gamer move and stop what I'm doing to intercept the killer. I end up accidentally sandbagi the survivor instead and she dies..
---
So at the end of the game you see a bar with red lines going through basically telling you how good you did. 
---
If you get to a Red line in the bar you piped. 
---
Black Line means safety Pip. 
---
Anything under Black Line can ruin your Progress in ranking. 
---
If you go to your rank you will see Rank (whatever number you are) with 3 dash marks. If you lose you lose a dashmark if you pip you get a dash of you safety pip you don‚Äôt lose or gain anything.
---
You HAVE to let the last person escape through the hatch!!! Camper! Tunneler!
---
The devs think unviable killers are fun to play as :)
---
Idk why but that looks like a giant piece of pizza to me and keeps making me chuckle
---
People will find any new concept that doesn't necessarily benifit **them** stupid. It ultimately would be **good** for BHVR so that's why I spent **hours** in a dumb phone Photo Shop making this. I hate when lobby screens are cluttered with random stuff too but again, this isn't cluttering and in my experience with this community, if BHVR actually added a feature like this, they couldn't care.
---
What does the big lebowski have to do with anything lmao
---
Just run in a straight line parallel to the killer, waste DH and fail the pallet drop 4Head
---
Yeah none of that would've happened if Laurie didn't DH as you could BT her outta there. Teammates are super cool sometimes.
---
Who tunnels as Freddy? No wonder people think he's the worst killer, they don't know what split pressure is.
---
Holy shit is it 1990 again?
---
Excellent write-up!
---
yea too. That tattoo so cool
---
That's not Jeff if he's not a thicc metalhead lol
---
they would never do thhat, they only know how to nurf survivors and buff killers since launchh
---
Have you SEEN Nea's default outfits???
---
Urban Evasion and Streetwise are both garbage, why is Nea so high? Only Balanced Landing is strong. Why is Tapp higher than Jeff, Jane, Laurie or even Kate? His perks are completley useless...
---
I get lots of gifts from survivors in the form of comments on my profile calling me the N word and telling me to kms c:
---
Honestly we need more of that person
---
We need all of that person
---
Survivors can wake up with any failed skill check. Easy as Pie.
---
Teleporting might be useful for travel, but not much else.
---
15% slower is in this case pretty bad, since the traps are obvious and unreliable. You don't get to choose if the survivor is affected by them, like with the clown, you have to play them beforehand and hope you can goad a survivor into it. And anyway, they have to be asleep to b affected, meaning unless that did nothing for 60 seconds you have to win a chase with them in the first place, without traps, simply being a M1 killer.
---
Fake pallets would be useful if they were base power, much more so than the snares. So of course it's an add-on. Bad.
---
At this point they'll only make numerical changes anymore. Nothing that will fix whats wrong with him.
---
It's cute how you think you said anything.
---
I think we all know the teacher would've been Baldi from Baldi's Basics

Brah.
---
I wasn't aware it was photoshopped
---
Or you know ... it‚Äôs probably too soon for spoilers so ... you know. 
---
Gaddarnit, why did I benchwatch stranger things in 1 day.
---
You don't have to uncloak to break pallets or generators.
---
They CAN physically see you while cloaked, so try to approach without LoS if possible - you'll force them to pick a direction and run as you uncloak, instead of knowing which way to run - they may run INTO you.
---
Patrol patrol patrol. Don't chase needlessly, make sure you hit gens for regression - if they see you as you uncloak and you know you're not gunna get them, cancel the uncloak and damage the gen, then re-assess. A regressing generator is a win for you.
---
Whenever i play as Pig, if 2 survivors stuck together to the endgame, and I down one, the other dips to escape, I just drag and drop the poor abandoned fellow at the escape. No trap ofc. Damned cowards. NGLB!
---
Ah, I think I see why you're defending this so vehemently.
---
Let's agree to disagree then.
---
Taunting/bullying is annoying. High rank players thrown in with low rank is always upsetting, but not always SWF
---
Probably because he's in the light
---
Trying to be positive and looking forward to seeing some new blood effects/powers, but honestly, Freddy is not nearly as bad as everyone claims unless you are a crazy high rank, which is not the majority of players, however it is the majority of people on this sub, and that‚Äôs where the disconnect is. Seriously. He just needed some tweaking to balance him. There is nothing wrong with his current powers. Hope they‚Äôre not ruining my guy.
---
How do you become a fun killer? Just out of curiosity because I‚Äôve had some pretty quick games.
---
Ahw thank you so much for explaining!
---
And hope they choose that gate
---
Waited 10 minutes, nothing happened. Had to leave and lost 2 pips from what could of been a double pip. Feels bad
---
Too bad you weren‚Äôt playing Nea, she gains the ability to mori after anyone else on her gen misses a skillcheck.
---
Or Borrowed Time, to ensure WGLF stacks.
---
I'm just defending this because I believe in the idea. I defend all of my dumb and good concepts, I still just don't understand why this would be a bad idea. I definitely wouldn't clutter the screen like some people think it would and it would show the newest characters to **all** players booting up the game. I'm not suggesting adding pop ups all over the main lobby, but a couple that show the latest characters.
---
Ha, get fucked survivors. Thats what you get.
---
wasn't trying to run a straight line, I saw Laurie and Ash go separate directions as you could see in the clip, so I decided not to be a dickhead and also go a separate way as going the same way would only result in all of use not being productive because we're together and the killer is present, I drew the short straw and went into a palletless zone and so I was there looking for pallet/vaults in the forest on my last hook and the killer on my back.
---
Watch me create a fake gift message for karma
---
As a Doctor main, I can tell it's pretty accurate.
---
Only to balance out against blatantly more powerful survivors.
---
Would the perks do anything?
---
As long as the same happens for killers then we have no issues here.
---
So I'm guessing pop goes the weasel would be a great perk or surveillance. I know about the basics of him, although some of the add-ons seem to make him worse, especially the brown ones. And I'm never camping lol, I prefer jump-scaring them. Thank you for the tips though.
---
Yeah and it should otherwise that's dumb.
---
So you would rather a 4k than a 3k, your smart.
---
What a comeback
---
lol is this meta, you are seriously being the baby fish thing in the meme rn
---
You take the moon.
---
No but no one got chainsawed and meat hooked either lol
---
She is probably running a chest build cause of Open Handed and Up The Ante, and I don't see the problem,almost just got on the hook, so she might as well search the chest since you are not dying in a while.
---
I'm just glad shes got frosty eyes. So I know that isnt me . . . .
---
The clapper for non-directional bell (makes it global) combined with the one that removes your radius and stain makes for a great combination. 
---
They'll know you're cloaking or uncloaking, but they won't know WHERE - and if you uncloak, they might assume you're NOT nearby, when you are. 
---
Basically the more you can fuck with them, the better.
---
How did they change him?
---
He's the baaaaaad guy.
---
*Duh*
---
Yeah they would. You could use sprint burst for 12 consectutive seconds, and the killer could see all survivors within bond's range.
---
The way you put it, we could say the same of adrenaline, wich is used as a end game crutch
---
Free to play
---
There's a brown one that removes terror radius for 6 seconds that is great when combined with the silent bell
---
I think Steve or Nancy would be the best choice.
---
PC: Beyond
---
Only have like 20ish hours in game so any SWF wpuld be awesome!
---
You lose offerings when you complete a match. If he had an offering for extra bloodpoints, it would‚Äôve been wasted since he got hooked.
---
Good God, you're an idiot. Look. I'd have faith. Right now this is all still work in progress and considering NONE of us have even tested what its like at the moment, I would watch your tone and be patient with what this rework will bring.
---
It‚Äôs mam!
---
It's really, really not toxic.
---
The game encourages bodyblocking with WGLF and to a lesser extent, MoM.
---
Maybe bring Mad Grit if it's pissing you off that much.
---
He blamed me in chat for running noed lol xD
---
Learn to read kid.
---
Dude I play killer mostly, and if they can‚Äôt tea bag you at every pallet and loop you for days you get called the worst stuff no matter how you play. I hit rank 5 doe the first tile this month and it‚Äôs gets worse the higher you go.
---
If you pull your internet cable before you are hooked on your death hook you keep your item + you don't de-rank and get your bloodpoints of the match, just fyi if you see ppl doing it.
---
About. Fucking. Time.
---
Amen.
---
No. It's coming out pretty soon. And I don't need to test it to know what it's like, since all of his powers are weaker versions of other killers. I can just use experience with the game.
---
I‚Äôll report him too. I‚Äôll even call the salt police to hunt him down. But I agree the community does suck some times man. I main survivor and recently leveled up some killers but whatever side I‚Äôm in I play against some toxic ass people. Especially in purple to red ranks.
---
Fuck, I remember this bug. Survivors with SB and Lightweight x3. Killers with bond/empathy.  Only time I used the bug was Trapper with Agitation x4 for a laugh.
---
But real talk, that‚Äôs a Nurse using Unrelenting, that‚Äôs truly horrifying.
---
More likely just beig salty

Btw, offerings are always lost when used, the only thing you can keep as a survivor is an item if you escape (you can go into a match grab some item from the box or someones else item, escape, and keep the item). If you die tough, you lose the item.
---
I'd say all three of those are the lower end of mid-tier, but definitely better than Myers, Nurse and Plague.
---
nah ellis dwight isn't a member of the team he just ellis diwght
---
Is this one of zombies formats or is this your own?
---
Don't worry lol, you dont have to do anything. Steam just rejects my debit card. I contacted them about it like 2 months ago and didnt get any replies. But thank you for the offer :)
---
Now I can fail at flashlight saves while still keeping my flashlight ! üòå
---
Like you must look at all this and think "Well at least its heading in the right direction and Freddy isn't as bad as he was". You can't genuinely think that all that has been said is final word. Tests will be done. A PTB will be released and if needed changes need to be made, they will be made. You can't just instantly jump the gun and think all that they've shown is final. You're only giving the rest of us that added bit of evidence that people like yourself are the toxic dick heads that you think you're not. You're jumping the gun. Stop it. Don't play cocky, don't play smug, don't act like you're right. You're not. I can assure you, you're only coming off as a dick. Stop it.
---
We got a stream of the devs explaining how he will work. That's why people freak out now.
---
Next tuesday we can try him on the PTB, then people will freak out even more.
---
Doctor and Hag DLCs are free on console.
---
Amanda can't be bought with shards
---
Well thats stupid, since you got downed straight away it doesnt count as a safe hook so she wouldnt have deliverence anyway
---
huntress' halloween eyes says otherwise
---
For salty survivors, playing as a killer is enough to be considered camping
---
Yeah, it is
---
Depends if M&amp;A will work with his new humming (my guess, it won't) so it might not be very useful on new freddy
---
I also don‚Äôt get DCing when you‚Äôre on your last hook. Like do you really wanna lose all those blood points and have wasted your time?
---
I figured they were stretching so they wouldn't strain a tear duct when it really came out.
---
MAXIMUM FARMING
---
Yeah I used that one last game and it seemed pretty good.
---
Ngl I didn't know that was ash, but other than him great job they all look good, especially Kate and Jeff
---
If you wanted to finish the gen..... Why did you hide in a locker across the map till my struggle phase?
---
Just want to give back to the community, one of my favorite games and I want everyone to experience it &lt;3
---
I think in lower ranks if they hear it once they might just run anyway ahha. It's funny to hide behind a tree where it's completely obvious and they're still on a gen, and then uncloak and launch at them.
---
I like that they are not just mindlessly banning ppl for it like some other people wanted but instead is implementing a cool down and the more you do the longer it will be and same for reverse that is more healthy than just banning ppl
---
Ahhh another thing learned now, tysm!
---
I completely understand, I'd just feel guilty if I couldn't repay it back :)
---
It's unnecessary. Wraith's cloak suppresses his terror radius and so all M&amp;A will do is give you a tiny FOV boost and increase your terror radius when you chase someone.
---
Trap the shack's window. They always fall for that.
---
That means that someone needs Bubba, He's very necessary for many killers, he shouldn't be crying at the end :)
---
Yep, but the graphics look like the original play station. But most importantly the frames are usually at 30fps at all times and I don‚Äôt lag or freeze. So if you don‚Äôt mind bad graphics I would definently recommend getting it
---
Removed we ask you take part in this sub Reddit before advertising your videos. Thank you
---
Meg was the first Survivor I ever played, and Kate is just incredibly beautiful &amp; I love her tattoos.
---
Other than that idk much for wraith as I usually play survivor (because when killer I usually feel bad for the survivors)
---
Lol could you imagine how op that would be?
---
If they get tunneled and do this i don‚Äôt blame them
---
Removed as we ask you take part in this sub Reddit before advertising your channel thank you for understanding
---
Feng and Claudette because Feng and Claudette.
---
You know why killer is in first person right?
---
So survivors can be more stelth, and have better chance at hiding, while survivor is in third person so they can spot the killer more easly and while doing something. I think theres a video that explain this, and show that the original idea was the oposite
---
Anyway, if we could change FoV at will, killers will see more, and almost no survivor will even have a chance to try to hide.
---
And thinking that people will use this to have a advantage wouldnt be the extreme. People have abused of bugs to have advantage since forever, so imagine something that isn't a bug.
---
Did you pick them based off of perks?
---
I agree with the guy above. If you‚Äôre new honestly you should just run out the door immediately after it‚Äôs opened. With you being new, you need the blood points more than that guy does. And chances are if you unhooked him he would have left you to die if you got caught or the killer would end up getting both of you.
---
Feel bad for saying it but claudette. Im by no means a toxic player, but she was my first to prestige cause she camos real well. Plus her perks are good.
---
I understand, have a nice weekend! &lt;3
---
Thats when you enter [Tier 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9ela6/tier_4_evil_within/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
The higher the rank you play the more you realize how easy and stress free playing survivor is at least compared to playing killer at high ranks
---
You too!
---
I do like kate too. Also meg was the first character i played. While everyone were playing different survivors i was going for that p3 baby
---
Facts. I think it will make people get better as well cause they won't just pussy our everytime there is a killer they don't like.
---
I think its stupid how a character is considered toxic tbh. But ye, she does camo really well. I cant remember who, but im pretty sure some survivors are quieter too?
---
This is art
---
Claud. That frohawk she has is ridiculous and i love it.

The PTB comes out on the 9th. Players will have about 1-2 weeks to play it (I think I don't play PTB's all that often) to test it and see what works and what doesn't. I can assure you, Freddy will be a hell of a lot better than what he is now. He may not be S tier, but he will at least be a little more fun to play as and against.
---
Nea. 
---
Bc I'm a killer main
---
Great play. I‚Äôve been struggling with legion since the change to his power but the body blocking is a great idea
---
THIS...is God.
---
Haha, i respect that!
---
Well the person making no play for the unhook would rather a 3k than a 2k, so at that point fuck it.
---
I tbag or click mostly when killer tunnels or camps and I want their attention. But when I actually get their attention, I'm like, not surprised
---
Pretty good.  I always use the Dried Cicada as well, but I also use the Turtle Egg instead of the Dragonfly Wings.  I also use Corrupt Intervention, because I can't always trust Ruin to slow the game down while I place traps.  Lastly, I stopped using BBQ and Chili.  Everybody always goes in lockers now.  I replaced it with Make your Choice or Save the Best for Last
---
I'm rank 1 for like a year so I know :D
---
I‚Äôm so, f*cking grateful for my hex.
---
God damn you were lucky to escape that
---
That can't be right. They would not possibly make such a stupid design decision. Would they?
---
good job. love jeff
---
Ace. *fingerguns*
---
It increases your terror radius in chase state and can therefore potentially reveal survivors further away from you, with Legion's "killer instinct", but once you are out of chase (which happens all the time in Frenzy), it will decrease its range. Coupled with the fact that you regularly won't be able to reach survivors at the edge even of your usual 32m terror radius, let alone M&amp;A's 40m (not without Frenzy duration add-ons, anyway), it's not that great. Sneaking up on survivors is obviously especially nice if they are already injured, but Legion will still have a 24m terror radius. The 8m closer proximity before survivors are alerted to your presence by the heartbeat is definitely not bad, but it's not a specifically well-suited perk for Legion.
---
If you do want to try some more flavorful tech choices, The Third Seal is really cool on Legion, seeing as how you can quickly apply to it to multiple if not all survivors. Then using it to slug.
---
That's so hot
---
...and Billie has nice hair I guess.
---
I‚Äôve never had that issue.  The only problem I‚Äôve run into is having all the totems cleansed.  Still probably gave them a jump scare.

I have this thing:
---
https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GE62-6QF-Apache-Pro/Specification
---
Not top, but usually I can get stable 60 FPS with some nice graphics.
---
Also I got cooling pad for it, and playing on Low, so my skillcheck is more or less like what I have on PS4.
---
But how do you unlock it?
---
I really should have just checked before going to bed if I had the Doctor already but it was after midnight and if I turned on the game, I would want to play another round too.  I also want to see if David King had a full outfit that included the black baseball cap or is it a single item as I might as well pay a tad more and get more.  I'll definitely want the whole killer pack and not just the individual person, going forward. 
---
I just checked and I do have the Doctor and Feng!  So I'm definitely going to some rounds as him.  She doesn't come with a hat at all but her latest outfit comes with a pink bow, which is very cute.  That outfit is 1080 cells, which is a whole mess of real dollars. 
---
King's black cap outfit is 270 cells, 170 more than with just the cap, but his Protector outfit looks pretty cool, so I can see myself getting that eventually and soon.
---
For Honor, the only other multiplayer game, had a single player campaign, so I was able to get a slew of trophies that way and they also have a few low hanging trophies.  I sort of need to earn at least one trophy or I start losing a sense of accomplishment.  Now that I broke through that once, I can start just relaxing.
---
Implying killers don't DC as well? I've had plenty of killers DC on me for juking them too long.
---
Ikr what sorcery is this
---
Idk I like getting moried, looks cool and you even get a better look on Davids abs sometimes so it's win/win
---
Mains will stay, that's true. But those who play like 60/40 (and thus aren't as good as they could be)? Not sure.
---
If my base BP gains (without BBQ) were similar for both roles, I'd play killer less, because survivor is less stressful for me.
---
How non-toxic! I love it.
---
Play the game more and get better then.
---
I‚Äôm definitely down for a demogorgon killer but honestly I‚Äôm more excited about the survivor. I‚Äôm keeping my fingers crossed for Barb! And after the backlash for her character dying so early I‚Äôd not be surprised if they go that way at all...
---
Yeah I trapped gens and dual trapped a couple hooks. They were S A L T Y when they realized 1 was hooked and 2 trapped right in front
---
I love wraith and Myers, but Myers performs better for me
---
I think it‚Äôs because the insta down saves so much time and he is more stealthy than the wraith. With monitor and dead rabbit you can sneak up on people even in EW2
---
Whereas with the wraith you make that loud ass bell ding that gives survivors about 4 seconds to run
---
It does feel like he‚Äôs slow though in these giant maps so hex Ruin is almost mandatory to slow the fame down. I also use barbecue cause blood points, nurse‚Äôs calling is great too and they‚Äôll never hear your heartbeat approach
---
This is even more terrifying than I imagined.
---
What the other guy said, and the bubba made a mistake, he handled directional input so poorly he fucked up an easy down.
---
Pfft I'm a survivor main and every time I'm really toxic during a game (tbagging, looping for freaking ages) and get tunneled I'm just like "that's fair" and say gg
---
I never got why people get angry
---
Survivor is so fun I used to main it I just started killer . Just don't worry about bad team mates you always have them XD when you solo que anyways.
---
"yesssss, yesssssss!"

And you take the sun

Took me a while to think about how they managed to get a screenshot like this before I noticed Claudette...
---
two words: ballerina feng
---
I don‚Äôt DC, I just kobe first hook and not struggle. But that‚Äôs if my team isn‚Äôt doing shit. If a gen hasn‚Äôt been done in a certain amount of time since game start I assume my team are a bunch of morons and instantly don‚Äôt care about winning or BP anymore, just getting to a new game
---
I'm hoping to become good enough where the adept trophies don't seem Impossible to me.  I'll write those ones down and have a fun goal(s) to reach for, thanks!
---
Jane, she‚Äôs fun to play as and I already have many teachables
---
Usually it's a legit strat if...
---
A. The Surviviors have 3 genned themselves. 
---
B. They're very altruistic.  
---
C. Gates are powered and you wanna preserve a kill
---
I love how no one's commenting about ebony mori 3-blink nurse at rank 17 like that's just what you should expect now.
---
But it hurts you more than the killer. You lose all your points, lose a pip or two, and the killer doesn't get hurt as much by it (and they'll get even less effective when Dedicated servers come out, and husks with it). Just to spite someone? Oh, wow you sure showed that guy that was either tryharding enough to not give a shit, or outright trolling you.
---
The killers only cost $5.
---
I mean it's a free game. I'll probably play this while i'm at the airport or something.
---
I had a game where there was 4 Party Streamers on the line, we found the killer's Ruin early, we did a gen pretty quickly too, one of the guys is the first to go down and he disconnected instantly. I was fucking baffled.
---
But then your teammates keep going down one after another
---
and yet still no fix on killers leaving the last survivor slugged either to spend a few minutes looking for the hatch, or just for the sake of being toxic?
---
and the survivor is punished for disconnecting? how about you fix your fucking game first.
---
Agreed. Even I sometimes wanna leave if I hate the killer ha it‚Äôs mostly doc and man the devs made him even more annoying with that new stupid sound effect lol
---
Imagine the horror of somebody expressing their opinion
---
That's better for the community. Now you can play your preference without worrying about BPs. Win win imo.
---
The format is Zombie's.

Then you doing it wrong tsk tsk

---
Just ask yourself this simple question to ensure you are not camping: *Am I on the map?*
---
If the answer is yes, you're a filthy camper, git gud bby kllor.
---
Seriously though, the amount of shit people throw at each other is insane. The devs have already stated it's part of the game and they won't even look at tickets submitted that contain the phrases camping or tunneling, let it rest.
---
Its like Freddy vs. Jason
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not strong enough‚Äù

‚ÄúWelcome to my world, Bitch‚Äù

Lol I wouldn't want 7 people body blocking hooks XD
---
Me neither. I'm in it for the BP, and hopefully if they do make survivors BP gain manageable it will make it all more worth while. If I need points I play killer, if i want to play with my bf it survivor and I always seem to have a target on my back. Is Laurie a hated survivor or something? I either reeeeeallly suck recently or every killer I face hates laurie. I don't even run DS because I cant hit the check and OOO is a death sentence for me, I just like playing her because HalloweenüòÉ
---
You try to hit as many ppl as you can as you have the ability to slow the game down a lot even more so if you add the right perks and also addons. It takes more skill and management to use this killer now then it was back when he was first released. So it‚Äôs all about slowing the game down
---
Meh, you'll see. He'll just be another mid-to-low tier killer who has to hope to the Entity that survivors make mistakes to have any success.
---
Killer Perk Idea
---
reverse borrowed time + Make your choice  "go on unhook em fucker i dare you" 
---
unsafe saves result in the survivor doing the save are given broken status  or exposed for 30 seconds with their aura shown for 15 seconds
---
Survivors DC much more often and unlike Killers without any penalty.
---
S√º-z &gt;
---
I accept my death and 4k BP for the match so I dont get this either. It sucks yea but it's something at least and survivor que is short af right now
---
Honestly it builds up tension, before the EGC you could fuck around or have all the time to rescue your teammates but now I'll get the exits and leave someone behind (I feel bad after tho)
---
This wouldn‚Äôt be fair for the killer and would create a worse problem. The problem is the communication, so if very random had voice chat the game would be way too unbalanced.
---
Like it really rough guy?
---
Very nice. Helpful guide for new players üëç
---
Same here. That's the only thing I'll report for is DC. I dont care if the killer facecamps me I have kindred for that exact reason so if I choose to wait out the timer just get yourselves out!
---
David! Only because every time he screams, I don‚Äôt feel like my ears are bleeding
---
Horrible Idea.
---
Cleanse it anyways. Might be noed
---
Spooky Freddy is almost as fun as spooky Myers. I‚Äôm gonna miss that build
---
Have to make like 8 gens tho
---
But the again it does lol. Its night and day between red ranks and purple ranks. Even bigger red and Green. Yes their is bad red ranks aswell but they still red so they must be doing Something right. Ur ranks matter skillwise.
---
Meg and Claudette, running girl and invisible girl
---
Far from it
---
Whew, the amount of bugs it'll bring
---
Claudette, she‚Äôs breathtaking. People sometimes call me toxic when I don‚Äôt teabag, or emote and it‚Äôs hilarious. To some killers, if a Claudette moves they are toxic.
---
This is where we think differently. I think losing non-mains would hurt the game.
---
But again - increasing survivors BP gains is the right thing to do. They just need to find the right balance. But BHVR and balance... How often do you see these two words used in non-negative way?
---
you keep your item but you still derank, sure you may still see you have all your pips and rank but after the next map the server will update your rank
---
*it‚Äôs
---
I kobed off a hook infront of a NOED doc he hit me it didnt down me and I ran to the gate and dead harded out.
---
I unhooked myself yesterday. Its worth it in specific situations. 
---
One partner was *off the hook* being chased by the killer in his crippling state while me and 2 others were struggling on their *last hang* so i decided i would test my luck and pulled the hook out of the huge cavity left in my shoulder just as our last hope had been struck down and hung up on the front fence. I raced to my other partners abd gave them a *hand.* we never survived the match but it was  good while it lasted.
---
Kate, Feng &amp; Jane.
---
Too much work for a mode that is rarely used. Won't happen.
---
I Dead Harded into the combine on Coldwind once because I was watching the killer for the best time to use it. 
---
I dodged his first attack. The second one, not so much.
---
This is why good wraiths use their speed while cloacked to block while uncloaking
---
I feel like it's when that kid holding up their hands saying "I'm not touching youuuu" gets popped in the mouth. Refusing to see how annoying they might have been while exaggerating how much getting popped hurts.
---
Some people can play rough and cheeky and have no problem getting played back. It's part of the game even. Just some people want to be jerks and have everyone tell them how funny and great they are. Being a jerk back makes you a villain because "I'm joking when I do it but you we're serious". It's just childishness.
---
PS4 bryccllns95 mostly looking for one or two survivors to join our little group. Me and the bf and we aren't great but it's fun to be able to actually communicate when someones camping or I am almost done with a gen. He gets more frustrated than I do, but we have fun regardless lol
---
Freaking MVP right here
---
And i get camped
---
The idea is that you chain attacks and waste time with mends. In reality with higher rank possibility of that becomes lower and lower as good players dont group especially against Legion.
---
Does not mean people won't run it on him :/
---
I wont, because it rarely comes in handy. I am probably going to be running BBQ, PGTW, TT, Surv/CI/Discordance
---
I remember when Panda said something like: shock survivors 4 times as the Doctor...? They could have just written "play the Doctor" and this is so accurate, rituals are so bad lol
---
Very helpful for killers and survivors digram. 
---
As killer eliminate the most vulnerable survivor to complete objectives quickly Time is important waste survivors time and prevent them from completing their objectives. 
---
As survivors don‚Äôt let the survivors sees you be immersive as much as possible and complete your objectives ASAP.
---
We dont want too many stuns, especially those that can be triggered without conditions.
---
I had an idea for this as part of a chapter concept, my version (thus far) was meant to be a risk/reward sort of thing. 
---
*Foolish Martyrdom*: 1/1/2 times per match, being struck by the killer while they are carrying another survivor will cause them to be stunned, and the survivor to be freed. However, your efforts will leave you in a highly damaged state, if struck while healthy, you will have the deep wound status applied with a reduced timer. If you use this ability a second time, or are struck while injured, you will be sent immediately into the dying state.
---
Yikes 
---
I want to do a mix of killer but I always get stressed cause I want to have fun with the survivors. I always worry if I'm gonna get salt for doing one thing or another lol
---
Right? Thats why i hate when someone dc for no reason after getting hit
---
Legion get destoyed on big maps (so almost every Man) and also if people don t stay near each other  so yeah he is shit on high ranks they overnerfed it
---
Honestly dude deserves to die at that point. Hes being selfish in a team game.
---
And where is the point when the servers starting?
---
[https://youtu.be/VCX8aWAh9QA](https://youtu.be/VCX8aWAh9QA)
---
They scream with iron will, because IW interacts with the moans/grunts of pain. Calm Spirit makes you not scream
---
Font forget M1 and using the power as killer is the most toxic shit ever
---
But on the livestream They said only for iPhone 6s or higher
---
This is why I specifically mentioned tunneling. You lose those pips anyway and the few thousand bloodpoints aren‚Äôt worth staying for.
---
No need to be sorry, more people running after killer and more people to bait hits from.
---
Dwight
---
First person in the game, and I liked his leader before they changed it
---
I pray he becomes so good that survivors fear him.
---
Dwight. I love the whole meme surrounding Dwight and the fact that his delivery boy skins makes him easy to see actually makes the game more enjoyable for me.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be asleep for him to hit you any more. In fact, hitting you puts you to sleep.
---
Sure being able to consistently rank up in any game is proven that you have some sort of skill, but the ranking system in DBD is almost entirely luck based at least for survivors. A killer can drag out games to get better emblems. All four survivors are playing as a team to survive, but when it comes to emblems they are against each other, also a bad killer will result in a stomp by the survivors leading to worse emblems in a lot of cases.
---
I was watching my friend stream one time and he was playing a speed hacker who was absolute ass at the game and as michael he basically baited him into getting insta downed twice
---
Did you watch the freddy rework thing. That programmer was straight terrified for 90% of it. That fear of your community is ridiculous. You guys have a niche and your competition is barely existent imo. You should be innovating and trying new shit and working to make an overall better product. Instead they are scared to make any sort of big changes that haven't been screamed out of the community for months and they ignore certain bugs and glitches for literal years.
---
Glad to see you 4 are happy
---
Yes.
---
Jane. If I‚Äôm feeling spicy, Claudette.
---
Wholesome!
---
What's their to be displeased about? He's better in almost ev
---
Because people seem to think the win or lose condition is did I survive or did I 4k. They dont realize that it's all about the points. Which is shit tbh cus as a killer if i stomp the survivors or they decide to kill themselves on first hook I'm fucked out of points. Same as survivor when your teammates decide to leave you for dead.
---
David and Jake.
---
well as someone who was on the receiving end, _i_ was insulted. he was basically saying that while the technical skill of what i made was good, my idea was bad and that i should do it his way instead. 
---
i wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúset off,‚Äù i was given a rude comment that initially made me think that my point of view of a character wasn‚Äôt welcome here. my comments are back in the positives so i‚Äôm thinking otherwise, again.
---
They like the old Freddy and they just wanted hos base kit to be buffed, not to get a rework.
---
This is probably the best thing I've ever seen
---
Speed hacking as Michael is just overall horrifying to think about
---
That they are
---
I love this game. That being said, I personally haven‚Äôt been able to play without getting frustrated from dumb stuff like this for the past month or so. Being a survivor main, the 3 year event wasn‚Äôt even that big of a draw because I know if I don‚Äôt play killer or run WGLF constantly, my BP rewards are a joke.
---
I cannot WAIT for them to implement the stuff from the recent dev diary. Disconnect fixes, BP fixes, I feel like I‚Äôll actually be able to play for fun again :D
---
I'm not saying he's better or worse, and I love my opinion getting downvoted to hell.
---
I'm saying I wish I could play as the Freddy I've played as for a year. That's going away and I wish it weren't.
---
DCing is just shit all around especially early on in the game. You're fucking your team and the killer out of BP. Doing it at the end of the game just fucks yourself out of BP lmao. Like you arent even hurting anyone but yourself. As a killer It is a mark of pride if i can get someone to DC cus i dont play like a scumbag so when they do DC its cus they are little snowflakes that cant stand losing.
---
Ace because he has 2 pink cosmetics and i'm on a mission to spite P3 Claudettes
---
I can understand letting go if the killer is camping or your team is overly altruistic. I had a match where legit all 3 teammates would sprint straight at me while I was being carried to a hook so it was just no gens done until the killer finally chased someone else.
---
Like I said, I didn't specify how the FoV slider would work because it would need to be tested. I'm not arguing about it because I clearly didn't say anything besides, there should be one.
---
If you wanna nit pick, than pit pick my perk ideas.
---
Inb4 salty survivors accuse thisflow chart of promoting tunneling.
---
No sorry there was a survivor speedhacking who was clearly new so he baited him into being instadowned
---
Why?
---
Or it‚Äôs because there were two other survivors right in front of him yet he still goes for OP who was just farmed lol smh
---
Doctor should take a class actually
---
I had a daily for healing yesterday so I ran well make it and literally EVERY SURVIVOR I unhooked proceeded to runnoff to the corner of the map to self care, and wouldn‚Äôt let me heal them. It was maddening.
---
How is this not a shitpost
---
That sounds very balanced yes.
---
Good players don;t do it
---
I dont buy cosmetics so purely off the idea of the character and my love of the movies its ash. The idea thats hes just really bored in there as this is just another day is quite fun.
---
I think it looks alright for a mobile game
---
If you press the attack button while charging your chainsaw it'll cancel it without starting his frenzy
---
That just makes it so much better.
---
What we killers call "common sense" has been redefined by survivors as "tunneling". This is the unfortunate reality.
---
If you seriously think that comment was rude I'm very curious how you go through daily life without constant break downs.
---
Ace is quieter when injured than other survivors.
---
Honestly, forgot about that
---
it's not that what happens. People are blinded with the fedora man bad circlejerk and cant adapt to new playstyles
---
I once played an overly altruistic team as Wraith. I had all seeing and could see they weren‚Äôt even trying to get gens done. After my 4K they all messaged me accusing me of camping and tunneling. All I could do was laugh in their face.
---
I would. I love running Mad Grit.
---
No, with spirit it is best to use headphones and learn how to see movement in the grass. She‚Äôs pretty difficult to use, but once you figure her out, she‚Äôs one of the best killers in the game, especially on console. Also, iron will is a huge counter to spirit
---
As someone who started the game and usually plays Michael, I relate to this on a spiritual level.
---
STOP CHECKING YOUR KNIFE AFTER STABBING, JUST GO AFTER THEM, DAMMIT!
---
i mean, i don‚Äôt see a problem with it. they just don‚Äôt have enough games of loosing a lot of potential bloodpoints yet to know how goddamn infuriating that is.
---
I must jump in lava then i guess
---
Tier 2 myers is normal speed
---
is he normally just able to get looped like that though
---
Finally an ally yeah I have to restart the game after every survivor match
---
Same as any other 115 killer, the survivor might just have been better at looping
---
How would a FoV slider work if not changing the FoV?
---
And the perk ideas are not the main focus, so yeah
---
As a Wraith main, this is how all of my matches go. Sometimes I laugh but more often than not I drown in those salty tears
---
Half the maps are reskins, and I'm sure they make a killing off just the characters alone.
---
I had that happen once when a survivor was injured. His dumbass didn‚Äôt know the plague could use corrupted fountains and he just DC‚Äôd when he realized he didn‚Äôt have the time to crawl away
---
I just started playing plague on console. I'm loving her and how I can track generators with puke. So there's at least 1 plague running around.
---
You‚Äôre*
---
then i must be very lucky since im red ranks in both suvivor and killer.... but the higher rank people are, the more they know what to do, they know their rolls. In red ranks people knows what they should be doing, likewise good killers knows what to pressure and what not to fall into. which you dont expect in lower ranks because they have less knowledge about the game or simply dosent play as much. skill = rating like any other game. its a shitty system yes and sometimes maybe abit RNG but its not RNG based because then i would be lucky AF. its unrewarding aswell yes but not entirely luck based.
---
Nice to know they're finally looking over Survivor BPs and realizing that survivor DCs affect other survivors negatively too.
---
i have adhd so rejection sensitivity is something i actually struggle with. but i just thought that comment was rude? i‚Äôm not allowed to perceive things as rude if i believe it was rude? ok king
---
Just joined a lobby with a flashlight 1m before this was posted.. heck.
---
M&amp;A and BBQ won't help you in chases. M&amp;A is for stealth, BBQ is for info (and points, of course)
---
Don't worry, this photo is a week old
---
Well if you have a recording of the guy holding the game hostage for you. Then you could probably get him banned.
---
Record for about 10 minutes, report him in-game and send the footage to support.
---
Well. You are naive but we all were when we were new.
---
Thanks man I will
---
Are you the last guy alive? Has the end game timer started? What platform are you on?
---
this would promote tunneling. no thanks.
---
This was really interesting! I‚Äôd love to see a video on less common loops, like map specific ones such as Thompson house or Haddonfield house, etc.  Good stuff!
---
Last guy. End game has ended. PS4
---
basically it‚Äôs to piss off a killer who‚Äôs been having a bad game all match. you know, gens getting completed left and right, being pallet looped/stunned to oblivion, flashlighted, knowing your gonna get like 15K BP at the end of the match. Tbagging is basically twisting the knife.
---
Whew chile. The ghetto! The ghettoooo. The ghetto!
---
How To Destroy SWF 101
---
Shouldnt you be dead then?
---
I just don't understand how it was rude. He didn't insult you, he didn't kill your family, he even said it was a nice piece of work (which it is)
---
It just looks like to me you're looking for something to be offended by.
---
I guess il never find out since I am rank 1 as killer but never got to rank 10 as survivor.
---
Dropped me next to a wall so the entity can‚Äôt kill me
---
He's slower at tier 1, but tier 2 &amp; 3 is normal killer speed - 115%
---
David. I play very aggressively, try and take aggro off of other survivors and keep the killer focused on me, and a hardened rugby lad seems appropriate for that
---
This Is so satisfying since She was also teabagging
---
It should still kill you reguadless. Can you post a pic related to the situation?
---
Potion of Fire Resist incoming
---
Yeah, can I attach it to this or should I just post again I‚Äôve not done this before
---
The perk ideas ARE the main focus LOL. A FoV slider would definitely change the FoV. How much it would change the FoV would need to be seen, but It's not like we can test it here. I can write out a thought out perk idea above which we can argue about that if you wish.
---
Can you attach? Not sure how it works lol.
---
Thank God. Just had a survivor DC on his first down, because like an idiot him and the other survivor stayed in the basement after the unhook and I was still nearby damaging a gen. Bubba's chainsaw dont discriminate
---
I‚Äôll just post again lol
---
Gotta be my man Jeff
---
He disconnected HAHA YES
---
How about, unhooking a survivor within the killers terror radius gives the person doing the save the penalty broken/exposed. encouraging killers to go after them instead of the wounded survivor
---
Boom I win
---
Behvr: As all things should be
---
It's not a circlejerk. There's only so many ways you can play a certain killer, and Freddy's essentially just an m1 killer with aura reading abilities. With that said, you can't even see their aura inside the terror radius, and by the time you get to them, they're likely to have woken up, and then you have to wait another 7 seconds. So, here's my question: What new, innovative playstyle do you recommend?
---
bruh i‚Äôm not looking for anything to be offended by? i just said that rejection sensitivity is something i struggle with and i found that he believed my vision was incorrect? like i don‚Äôt know how to get through to you? you going to accuse me of being a radfem next?
---
Some people do it when a killer is steamrolling because they want to deny a killer the double pip too - I've definitely seen as much admitted by at least one player. It happened once when I was running against what we assumed to be someone going for Adept Spirit. We know that's what the guy did because, after he 'DCed' (it was on PS4, so it was as simple as closing the application), he messaged us asking us to do the same so the killer for sure couldn't get a trophy
---
Nine times out of ten, I'm willing to bet it's blind spite with zero forethought, and the other one time it's blind rage with zero forethought
---
Please tell me you didn‚Äôt kill her
---
Survivors DC ruins the game for everyone. If you‚Äôre slugged and the killer just wants to have you die to the Entity/hatch deny, you‚Äôre not being held hostage cause the end is coming so just go afk for 2 mins. Not like they can stop the collapse from happening.
---
Yeah this is pretty much accurate.
---
a strategic playstyle instead of an agressive playstyle. Keeping people asleep gives you so much information you can play with and that's why class photo is his best addon
---
thank you
---
Nothing in the notes.
---
Yes...but what if it's a smart Dwight with calm spirit?
---
This conversation is pointless.
---
Good luck in life guy
---
It depends on if you‚Äôve been good in Santa‚Äôs eyes this year.
---
It‚Äôs 15 seconds man
---
Coincidentally the killer had Franklin's, so I was genuinely concerned
---
True I thought that exact same thing. He wanted me to save him but I bet he would have left me to die. üòíü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Just wait till they see the porn
---
Ash is my main. "Look who's shittin in the tall grass" feels like an attack on Claudette and it's funny.
---
Same here, in PS4. Taking forever at rank 6.
---
At any rate, you should've bled out and died.
---
Just want to point one thing out, ''Tobfatone'' IS rank 17. He is our friend. And not at all experienced  
---
And usually when we q with a  low ranked survivor the killer tend to be equal to our rank.  
---
Don't assume everything
---
You missed this part: "And then balance the game around SWF"
---
Right now its balanced around no communication, so when killers face SWF its totally unfair.
---
Wait how do you get it on mobile???
---
xD Would love to try that
---
But if someone's getting tunneled, then sticking it out actually helps your team and hurts the killer *more*, because it means you can know for certain you're enabling your entire team to be able to work objectives consequence-free for as long as humanly possible. If you mean you're getting tunneled and frequently insta-downed straight off the hook that's a different story, but if you're ending up dead on hook so early that the other survivors can't get gens done, it's not 100% the killer's fault. Could be any combination of a tunneling killer, poor form on the survivor's part, poor teammates, or just plain bad luck, but tunneling someone to death so soon that they can't even safety pip isn't exactly something that a killer is guaranteed evey match
---
I once tried to play nurse and wasn't great at it. People accused me of boosting... -_-
---
Or r/okbuddyretard
---
on ios it‚Äôs available in Denmark, so you can switch your account region, download it, then switch it back, or you can make a new apple id in Denmark
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll try it with thanataphobia as well
---
Nope just someone that is very good with Freddy that enjoys him as is and was one of the few that never asked for a rework.
---
I'm pretty sure there were leaks of mobile quests that give you shards and auric cells, might be in the full version
---
I always thought it was the 2010 version since Quentin is in the game tbh
---
You have no idea how many times people have told me I'm lying about playing both roles equally just because I disagreed with them on something, lol
---
Feng Min best girl since 2018
---
I love to run object of obsession cause i become his/her main object but sometime being ignore cause few perk. If i get ignored, i am going to body block the heck of you!
---
Having cat mouse game is fun! And fuck legion! Seriously.
---
is it not out yet on certain mibile devices or sum shit? i cant find it
---
Wait, I'm confused. It takes 240 seconds to die from bleeding out when you're in dying state. There's no way that could be more than 4 minutes let alone 20.
---
It‚Äôs like it *wants* to be found
---
that ace is great though
---
Underwater dbd map where everyone has diving suits on?
---
Hags use Devour Hope a lot
---
Free hit to begin every chase, look around if someone's close go for them and apply deep wounds.  Look again if someone else is close repeat.  If noone else is close than yes simply stay on their ass, cancel ability down and hook.  He isn't nearly as bad as you're suggesting you just got to get used to his new ability setup and be patient and disciplined with your swings so you don't miss and take yourself out of ability.
---
It‚Äôs 11.5% for 3 chances, which is quite good.
---
Dont post anything abt legion ppl are mad and they will down vote you.
---
Lol ahhhhhh the killer you're never making a hook against my swf again perk.  Why you keep stunning yourself, why you keep stunning yourself?  Balanced.
---
ngl i don‚Äôt remember in the slightest what happened after this
---
Hmm. Some of us were just born to play the roll.
---
Feng and Nea. Nea because she has the best cosmetics &amp; Feng because she is adorable (and ballerina Feng is the best thing in the whole game).
---
No the timer didn‚Äôt go down
---
Well, perhaps if they charged slightly more per DLC character or even monetizing the free DLC. 
---
But charging for the original characters? That's fucked.
---
Nah that's a selfish play.  It's the basement and you never know when the killer will return.  You need to ghost out of there quick as soon as you have the opportunity.  She should have got the chest later.
---
It's just not fair..
---
Dwight main, not a locker main ;)
---
He's coming to you...
---
....there is no difference in penalty for killer DCing vs survivors DCing.
---
In both cases, the survivors who didn't DC get fucked over while at least 2 survivors have to DC to truly fuck over the killer.
---
Without any penalty.  Both sides lose the same pips and bloodpoints when they babyrage.  Not sure what point you're attempting to make there.
---
Blood warden
---
[quote]We're still in hell of a need being able to sell our garbage items/add ons/offerings for bloodpoints. Give us maybe 50-80% back or lower the costs for bloodwebs again. (No worries I've seen the bloodwebs from back in the days, playing since day 1 on PC.)[/quote]
---
I agree with this part.
---
You can do without those perks you mentioned but it makes life a little easier if you had perks like Monitor&amp; Abuse, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle to name a few.Just get better at looping and mind gaming survivors and you should be ok.Also, don't pop Evil Within 3 until you know for sure you will get a hit.
---
Well I mean... Based off of your username. I can already guarantee I know what play style you have. You're the type of person that a killer will bring an ivory Mori for.
---
And based off of the points that Survivor scored. They had a lot of chases that match and most likely didn't even go down once. Believe it or not I've tested this shit out and made a Smurf account just to test the matchmaking. I wasn't going to kill anyone and let everyone Escape but still do chases and see how the match goes. Basically act like a noob. Most of the time I would get equal rank players. Sometimes I would get much higher rank players and I check Survivor profiles before I play with them so I know whether I should Dodge or not. Almost every red or purple rank was friends with the survivors on their team and playing survive with friends. A lot of them had TTV in their name and they would always play very toxic. Whether it be teabagging at every pallet or trash-talking in the post game chat.
---
I could understand the game matchmaking being fucked up and putting a yellow rank or green rank against a rank 20. Not a red rank or a purple rank. That's absurd and game-breaking. It eliminates the entire purpose of rank. And no I don't have a problem with you playing with lower-ranked friends. I think it shouldn't put you against gray ranked killers but instead average it out properly or put you against a killer of your own rank if it can't do that. It shouldn't put you against new Killers so you can ruin their fun and waste their offerings or add-ons.
---
I remember when I was first starting out. My first time playing killer and I was having a great time. Until I had my first match against a toxic survive with friends group. I was rank 17. They used a Haddonfield offering when I was playing Huntress and broke every hook before I could carry a person to it. They would tea bag at every pallet or window. Three of them ended up being right two and one was a rank 20. The right 20 was an account that was created the night before and an obvious smurf account They were all friends with each other and they all made sure to talk shit post game.
---
That put me off of killer for about a month. I started looking into it and after having multiple matches like that I just called it quits and played Survivor for a while. And no I can happily say I stomp red ranked survive with friends groups and have fun playing killer again.
---
Heh
---
There really needs to be an option to let you deny survivor unhooks
---
The condition is it costs a health state
---
Lol the Halloween 2018 music was a nice touch, lovely piece of soundtrack!
---
It's really funny, isn't it? I main Claudette and Meg and apparently I'm toxic when I just open a gate and get out.
---
Did you have something of value to say?
---
Of course not. If you did, you'd have said it by now. Come back some other time - and by that i mean never.
---
I mostly like clips of people falling through the map, flying in the air or sliding all over the ground. Looks so funny to me
---
Of you havent contributed to the community in any other way, noone gives a shit about your self promos
---
Man, it's almost as if each killer plays differently
---
Self promos arent treated well here pal.
---
Shirtless David king with those tight red pants. At least if I‚Äôm dying I have something nice to look at.
---
Leatherface is more than worth it in my opinion. It is like pudding in every match. If I only get half the survivors I am credited as if I got them all so I don't play so thirsty. Plus seeing where the others are while I hook one is a nice bonus.
---
This. 
---
I don't support pushing paid content to anywhere but the store or news page. It does not feel good to have to look at.
---
But butt my spirit waifu cook me dinner to night...
---
Thanks man
---
From my understanding the beta is only out in Scandinavia atm. Though I've heard people say that changed their play store region to a Scandinvian country (Denmark, Sweden etc) and then they could find it
---
I started off with Claudette, but as soon as I got BT and WGLF on David, I switched to him. I wouldn‚Äôt have started running him until I got BT just so I‚Äôm not accused of being a farmer. I never want to do that unless I feel salty.
---
I would say if a group has a red rank in it. No matter the ranks of the other survivors. They should be matched with a red or purple killer. Maybe the highest green rank possible like 9. But all it takes is one or two to carry the team. Most of the time when it's a noob killer. They don't know when they give up chases. They don't know how to properly Patrol generators. They don't have hex ruin. They don't have barbecue and chili. They don't have any sort of meta perks that they can use. Most of the time the high rank player will lead them on a chase while the team does generators. I've seen some of these matches and for generators will be done in under 5 minutes and that's very disheartening to a new player. Especially at a rank where blood points, offerings, and add ons are much more rare. I've also noticed a lot of those High ranks playing against lower rank Killers tend to shit talk. 
---
Are the most likely to insult you in the post game chat. And a lot of them have TTV in their name. Like the lovely individual attacking me in the comments with an anecdotal story end trying to say survive with friends as balanced and it's just people trying to have fun and prioritizing their fun over someone else.
---
Thankfully you seem much more reasonable and have a good head on your shoulders. Thankfully I've had enough time put in the game and tended to stomp these groups because they are overly altruistic or overly cocky. If they play scummy I'll play scummy. I don't play dead by daylight as much as I used to but I love being a green or purple Rank and stomping one of these super coordinated survive with friends groups and seeing the excuses they make post game. Or the amount of shit they talk because I beat them.
---
The chances are if they have to play against lower rank Killers to look good on a mediocre live stream, they're not that good when they go against an actual decent killer.
---
Isn‚Äôt it better to just continue playing and get a few points before dying? I‚Äôm curious as to why people do it so often whether killer or survivor.
---
Can she absorb other killers perks after their defeat
---
.......
---
*flips table and sprints out door*
---
This is fking amazing! GJ!
---
So far
---
5 minutes and remake the lobby. 
---
You really should have gotten the hint by 10 minutes tbh
---
Thank you so much! I was a bit shy to post it at first.
---
Oof k could have just ignored it my dud people self promo all the time get over it
---
this is a fever dream of a meme...
---
I mean... Rainbow Six Siege has that, CSGO has it, and those games are fine playerbase wise. I think DBD'll be fine and this is very much needed
---
lol, took me a second.
---
So, basically make your choice inside terror radius
---
Having this would encourage actual facecamping, not only to punish a bad save
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it. I love killers who camp because so much can get done in the time they‚Äôre ‚Äúcamping‚Äù. I just run in with borrowed time and it turns out fine. Play how you think is fun.
---
You'd think calling you the wrong survivor would have been enough to tip people off through the tone deaf text medium lol.
---
Would you say leatherface is good to play or just level for the perk ?
---
You will have haters in all aspects of life in this civilization we live in. Ignore it if you want nothing to do with it. If on Ps4 prevent messages from anyone not on your friends list. While killer I would turn off friend requests also so they can't get that message in with the friend request.
---
Anybody can do anything to make themselves feel better, if they choose to pick on you remember, everyone has haters. Let them hate or kill them with kindness.
---
Thanks, i hate it
---
It is
---
That is not a condition, that is a cost. You can still use it anytime basically.
---
He still chose to use farming toxic survivors to tunnel down a kill instead of punishing those toxic pricks who he had injured state and allowed to get away.  Just because the survivors were in the wrong doesn't mean the killer couldn't display some form of sportsmanship.  They're all assholes if you ask me.  I'd never do that in my killer games.  I consider myself pretty good.  I don't need teamates to get me my kills.
---
she comes free on console but is paid dlc on pc
---
Yeah i meant those games where you end up dying early on. I wouldn‚Äôt stay in those unless it‚Äôs with a SWF
---
What you are talking about is basically latency driven. I've had the bar get to 100% and stop, then get hooked. Killer is host, and host is always right. If his computer said you didn't wiggle off, then you didn't. Cases of this happening will be diminished once dedicated servers are in place. Keep in mind, if they get in range on the side of the hook, they will still be able to hook you.
---
As if she wasn‚Äôt already not letting survivors win.
---
Yeah all 50 of them for that 1 good skill check they hit lol.  Selfish self caring potatoes.  Gotta love em.
---
so cool having a dozen worthless flashlight add ons clogging the bloodweb now
---
As a survivor main I feel like noed is fine how it is, just map awareness is key if you don‚Äôt want to destroy totems atleast try and remember where they were and most of the time the killer will get one kill off noed
---
yeah they kept leaving and joining the party so it was kinda hard to get a good convo going but we got a few good insults in there
---
Ah i see your point, 
---
this could be abused similar to what ds used to be and what head on is currently at 
---
a work around would be a req being the perk can only be active when a certain number of tokens are gained 
---
like M.O.M taking hits or being within the killers TR for a amount of time
---
I mean... I barely see Killers disconnect. Usually it if it's a crap map they will bail. Meanwhile whenever I play killer I can't go more than one match without a disconnect on the Survivor side. Makes me feel bad for the teammates they ditched so carelessly. I usually give hatch to the last one.
---
But yes. Anyone quitting multiple times in Rapid succession will have a timer that stops them from queuing for another match. This effects everyone. Thankfully
---
Ghost Face is everywhere, and in all things. Always leaning, always stalking, always watching...
---
He is fun to play as. If you want to play serious he is able to apply pressure at a moments notice. And if you want to have fun role playing you can play Basement Bubba. Insidious in the basement and protect momma's treasure chest by only attacking and hooking survivors that try taking from momma. "You pass the test if you don't touch momma's chest" for end game chat is always fun too.
---
I did that a couple days ago and the dude was running towards the exit gate after being unhooked but I cut him off and downed him. Instantly dc'ed lmao
---
I could see that but honestly *I'd* really like to see Steve. He's #1 Best Mom
---
End game chat for me is getting salty playstation messages but thanks for the advice. Think ill pick him up
---
If you‚Äôre carrying a survivor when the egc ends there‚Äôs a chance you‚Äôll drop them and they won‚Äôt bleed out
---
Running a Myers through a full T3 proc is one of the most gratifying things to do in this game.
---
Jane because, I actually don‚Äôt know. She was the first DLC to come out since I started playing so maybe that?
---
If anyone is curious, look up for foward on Identity V
---
I think maybe instead of stuning the hunter and freeing the survivor, it could push the hunter if possible, and increase the wiggle of the carried survivor, getting exhaustion.
---
maybe the need to be healthy so it dont over lap dead hard, and can be used only in the general direction of the hunter
---
There's only three circumstances when I quit a match on this game.
---
1. Lag
---
2. Purposfully scummy/toxic tactics like exploits or using BM to annoy other players. (I don't count camping or tunneling because those are valid strategies and part of the game. If I'm getting camped or tunneled... That means I'm buying my team time.) 
---
3. Grim Pantry.
---
Also yes. Doctor is the least fun killer in my opinion. But then again I play Nurse spirit and Huntress so people would probably call that annoying since they're more effective than the doctor.
---
BuT tHaTs TuNnElInG
---
Im just saying what almost everyone in this community is thinking. Also noone cares about anyone's self promos unless they have actually contributed like i said before.
---
You honestly wouldn't believe one of the arguments I had on this one post comments. A bunch of survivors were downvoting me and insulting me because the commenter was defending quitting or suiciding if you go down first saying it's no fun and that the match is over. People were legit saying it's fine to quit whenever you're losing or could lose. Couldn't believe people were defending that and suiciding on your first hook.
---
Turn messages off from strangers. Also you can appear offline so survivors don't know who their killer is. If I get in a campy killer's room then I dodge the room but if they appear offline then I have no choice but to take my chances staying.
---
I dont remember that being part of the documentation lol. Ed Gein was a cannibal that killed and ate victims and built stuff out of their bones and skin, as far as i know. Is that a lie? Otherwise i wouldnt know why TCM isnt based on a real story
---
That's my issue with the rework.  I created a playstyle and loadout built around his aura reading ability and even use it to get my downs in chases.  I play him spoopy as shit and I've trained myself to do it without needing addons.  I basically have to start from scratch and play him completely different now.  He was my favorite killer to play as of late.  I really hope I don't hate the new kit.  I've got almost every perk on him.
---
*laughs in fragrant lock of hair*
---
farming is basically not playing the game the way it was meant to so you can get as many bloodpoints as possible.
---
They literally have an entire store for this kind of stuff. Why push it in everyones face as soon as they enter the game every time? Also it ruins the background.
---
Refusing the we'll make it heal is just silly. The only time I refuse heals is when I can do it faster myself.
---
is the timer not slowing down a bug or patch?
---
You gotta admire your work my guy
---
yeah but it still gives you a 16m TR against awake survivors - that coupled with the non-directional lullaby against sleeping survivors, which is really strong if you've played against new huntress, makes him an all around stealthier killer. Not sure if it's worth a perk slot, but we'll see.
---
If you're still in the same match as survivors and one of them happens to die. You're automatically a camper. At least if it's swf. Solo players tend to just say GG and move on most of the time.
---
Can you not crawl away from the wall?
---
Welcome to the fog. A lot of survivors will blame everyone but themselves when they die. My response to the message you got would have been ‚Äúif you didn‚Äôt want to die don‚Äôt get caught‚Äù then you drop the block hammer on them and move on. I had a person say I didn‚Äôt do anything and I asked if that was the case why did I have more points than the others combined. Really just do you and have fun learn to embrace the salt and take it as a badge of honor.
---
I‚Äôve had my fair share of salty players before, both playing as survivor and killer. 
---
When I was still new, I was on the Red Forest map against Leatherface. After he hooked a Laurie, I waited a bit before going in to save him but the killer came back and downed Laurie again. This was before I knew anything about Borrowed Time or learning how to Body Block. The dude sent me angry messages after he died, about how I should be running BT if I‚Äôm going to be running risky saves like that.
---
Lesson learned the hard way. Just ignore people like that unless they‚Äôre giving advice in the angriest way possible.
---
No, I meant he lost the main point of your idea that it was just a suggestion thats it.
---
No lol I wasn‚Äôt saying Ed Gein wasn‚Äôt real or that‚Äôs not what the movie was inspired by, but the creators of Texas chainsaw tried to make it seem like the events in the movie were more factual than what it was, so that people would be more inclined to go see it
---
meg cause i like her deathgarden mask
---
Thanks mr piper
---
I‚Äôve always wanted a Headbutting perk in this game. Or at least one that lets you punch the killer, point blank üòÇ
---
Nea cuz her cosmetics are rad. Plus she was the first person I could use Balanced Landing on
---
I'm a casual console player, so i see people rushing for saves inside the TR all the time without Borrowed Time
---
but i can see your point, thanks for the input
---
What is toxic about running backwards circle in the exit gate? They are literally giving the killer free points and if the huntress decides to not "scare them out" for good she embraces it and farms the free points she can get by hitting some hatches.  There is absolutely nothing toxic about this clip. All these baby killers should just stop being such huge crybabies holy shit
---
So let me guess. You were being carried by metal of man and now that it's been changed you're dying because you were boosted.
---
Those people are braindead. You ruin 4 people games for being selfish like that. I've been tunneled for 2 hooks and ended up escaping before. People just don't want to get better at the game.
---
For survivors who hace this happen to them; just run back into the map. Usually when you cross the line that makes you leave from the other side when you're outside of the map you get your escape.
---
For killers stop being such giant cry babies there is absolutely nothing toxic in this clip holy shit
---
How would it promote tunneling? It's purposefully giving you the incentive to go after the unhooker instead of the person who just got unhooked
---
I noticed the game made a bling sound when i push a button on the keyboard if i played mouse/keyboard when i have a controller plugged in.  I have to unplug the controller to make it stop.
---
michael tiering up 
---
oh you like what you see you cum faced twat 
---
oi i got something for you "Bam" 
---
"gets tunneled the entire game" but it was worth it
---
I feel like the cannibal is the least fun but he's gotten better in my opinion. I love doctor he can be such a cunt if you play him right. I don't disconnect but the family residence makes me not want to play killer ever again.
---
Oh ok, my bad! Yeah, he did!
---
I had started playing again recently after a year break and had gotten to rank 15 and things had been getting harder and I was getting raged at for tunnelling, I don‚Äôt even know what that is, and for camping but that‚Äôs because the survivors where literally trying to unhook as I was just next to them
---
Why karma? What is toxic about running circles and LITERALLY giving the killer free points?
---
Excellent question
---
Facts it's been 3 years. I know this isn't as competitive a game but still. This shit is annoying.
---
I mean, if the cosmetics come to console as well, you can play as Francis on Jake.
---
The good old days
---
Don't stress, almost the same exact situation happened to me and my friend (except we're not new), and we escaped with messages popping up on our PS4 about how we were being reported:)
---
Lol facts. Literally it's not tunnelling if you're being an idiot and obvious.
---
This summer probably.
---
He doesn't necessarily need to any more than any other m1 killer needs to camp. He just happens to be very good at it, since his kit is really only better than billy's kit when he's camping
---
What's the new sound effect? Haven't played him for a bit.
---
Decisive is absolutely fine now man.  I never get d striked by survivors anymore because I constantly switch targets after hooking.  It doesn't have to be adjusted.  It primarily affects babykillers who camp and tunnel.  Let's not do anything that makes it easier for these players to work around it.
---
You got any bubble gum? I am fresh out.
---
That's how I look at it. I'd rather 10k points for 5 minutes instead of zero and waiting in a queue.
---
All David mains gravitate towards this perk because it is him üòÇ
---
Collegehumour kweens
---
It‚Äôs an overlooked perk, and while arguably there are better ones... it has saved my life more times than I can count. I really do enjoy using it.
---
Hands down he is the best mom. However then they‚Äôd have to create a convincing story for him to be stuck in the realm of the entity and I can‚Äôt take him away from his children üòÇ
---
I mean, if i find the person that just got unhooked and is on their last hook, i‚Äôll down them but not hook them. Its more points for all of us, unhooking points, chase points, gen points, and it avoids ruining the game for the survivor.
---
*Unless they t bag at pallets, then they can get fucked.*
---
survivors hear a lout type of shock anytime they get shocked super annoying and unneeded
---
Damn that's rough. It just takes 15 min for survivor matches for me and 2 seconds for killer.
---
Saaaame
---
Tru tru
---
Oh that's wack. I feel bad cause I was looking forward to playing doctor tonight but I don't want to do that to someone.
---
Now imagine it times 4 with everyone running medkits/self care.... I'll pass on this perk idea
---
Michael has his own perks that can increase movement speed as you gain tokens. Maybe you should try those on him.
---
This is the best way to stop toxic survivors, buy them a hard to play killer so the play the other side for once, get bullied, and have an epiphany on what it's like.
---
honestly, I have no idea why they added that to a killer ppl already get annoyed by lol. I do hope they remove that then again they added a lot of weird shit with sound in the ghost face patch lol
---
Leatherface is good for his teachables and honestly he's pretty fun to play as. There are some great builds you can use with him such as play with your food. Plus unlocking the Survivor skin masks for him is a good objective and adds  replay value. He's also cheaper then other DLC by $3 since it's just him. Then I would recommend Pig for her teachables and because she is a viable killer.
---
Totally wait on Freddy until the rework though.
---
Suddenly i need a roddy piper survivor
---
Am I terrible for laughing when they get salty sometimes? I had a guy berate me in postgame chat when I didn't unhook him before I escaped. He kept saying that we could have both gotten away, but the killer agreed with me (he was kinda camping but I think he was smart to secure the kill honestly). The other survivor just kept saying "nuh uh, we could have both gotten out" until I just gg'd the killer and left the chat.

Why you tryna start shit?

Im only planning on buying one rn man as i already bought a few i need to level so i think it‚Äôs leatherface

Welcome. Glad to see another killer working their way up in the world. Best I can say is don't let postgame shit talking discourage you. As long as you're in the same match as a Survivor who died, you will be accused of everything possible to explain them losing. Don't let it get under your skin and you're golden.
---
Hopefully see you at Red rank for Survivor or killer one day. Until then keep on going, congrats.
---
My BF would run things that encouraged him to stay injured (resilience, for instance, and iron will)  but for several games he played with no mither. It‚Äôs a harder perk to play with, but it can be pretty rewarding if you‚Äôre trying to get that trophy (especially paired with iron will, since you won‚Äôt make sound and don‚Äôt bleed)

Can‚Äôt move dude

I'm sure his wife would be okay with that. She knows his fans miss him.

I have healed more than 50 health states total with No Mither equipped.  It does not seem to be popping for me.

Lol fake? Okay man whatever you say.
---
There‚Äôs a bug on PS4 (unsure of other platforms) where, if the killer picks you up at the very last second of EGC, it will cancel the sacrifice. The survivor will be registered as dead (can‚Äôt move or do anything) but the game itself doesn‚Äôt register it. The killer can still move around. If you sit and wait for it to fix itself, it takes an incredibly long time if it does it at all. The main way you can stop it is by disconnecting, but then you can be punished for that.  I‚Äôve had a shitty killer purposefully hold me hostage like this trying to force me to DC. Not very fun.
---
I completely agree with Survival. Very, VERY few things give survival and are often killer dependent (Snapping Out Of It vs Doc, which actually stops giving survival points after you get enough etc.) or are rare/a pain to do like completely wiggling out of killer grasp, etc.
---
Like 99% of all survival points obtained across  the DBD community are probably struggling on hook, and escaping the trial.
---
It's a bit of a self-fullfilling prophecy.
---
They assume Freddy is awful so tunneling is the only way to get kills with him, so they tunnel and don't pressure the map at all. In the process, the gens get done fast and they lose.
---
The killer can intentionally break EGC by picking the survivor up at the very last second, which will cancel the sacrifice and break the survivor (survivor registers as dead, so they can‚Äôt move at all).
---
BHVR is a strange beast ain‚Äôt it
---
Some things to keep in mind as a survivor:
---
1. 4.6m/s killers run at 115% speed (4.4/s is 110%). Survivor running speed is 100%.
---
2. When a chase/loop is getting longer, try to force the killer to break the pallet so they lose bloodlust.
---
3. Get an exhaustion perk. I like dead hard because I can use it any time. See what works for your play style.
---
4. Try hugging the walls when looping but be sure full not to hit an object. 
---
5. Turn your camera around to see the killer.
---
6. Self care is a life saver, try getting it.
---
7. When looping the killer, try not to go through every pallet. Imagine a straight line from left to right when numbers 1 to 10, each number representing a pallet. Don‚Äôt go through the pallets in increments of 1 (pallet 1, pallet 2, pallet 3, etc. try skipping some pallets to leave some for the others. If a certain area has 0 pallets left, the killer will have a huge advantage, especially if the gems haven‚Äôt been done in that area.
---
8. Don‚Äôt unhook your teammate in front of the killer (unless you have borrowed time).
---
9. If you‚Äôre thinking of vaulting a pallet/window, and the killer is about to catch up and hit you, try to fake that you‚Äôre going to vault and move away.
---
10. It‚Äôs harder to play with randoms than SWF.
---
Ok let's be honest they don't do it to give the killer extra points.
---
They do it as an ego stroker.
---
Well I still retain the belief you should play however you want to play as long as it's not bannable or exploiting. 
---
It does not mean that you shouldn't be called out if you're behaving in a toxic manner. 
---
The extra points were just a result of their toxicity it was not the reason they chose to do it.
---
The honestly going to the defend the toxicity by saying it gives the killer points so it's not toxic then you are literally part of the problem.
---
As I said in my post above this bug is an issue and it shouldn't be happening however change the fact that it's satisfying to see it happened to someone who is being actively toxic.
---
A while back there was a clip of a Myers was posted to this subreddit being super toxic just because the survivor he was being toxic to got extra points does not mean that what he did wasn't toxic and in return the survivor escaped because of the toxicity which was well deserved.
---
Same idk I think if u restart the game it shortens it could just be coinsedenc idk
---
Naw Laughing at salty people is fun. It‚Äôs always fun seeing a dipshit trying to find excuses to say and throwing insults to boost there massive ego. Lol
---
There is a bug on PS4, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs on any other platforms, where the killer can intentionally break EGC by picking the last survivor up at the very last second. This breaks the EGC, cancels the sacrifice, and also registers the survivor as being dead without actually counting them as dead. They‚Äôre still ‚Äúalive‚Äù but they won‚Äôt bleed out and they can‚Äôt move. The game has a hard time fixing itself, so the only way to really get out of it is by disconnecting.
---
It's every single game. Not only DBD. Don't worry.
---
I would say try using nea, she has balance landing and other good perks, but I use nea so that's why. I don't use David. You'll improve as a survivor anyway though as you get better.
---
That isn‚Äôt how that works, each attempt is 4%
---
Diversion would be good if it was less than 45 seconds. Sometimes the game will be half over before you get the pebble.
---
I think a cool down timer like a quick and quiet or exhaustion perks would be much better. Like a minute in between usage
---
My bad. Mis-read what you wrote.
---
I personally use Stake Out to counter Ruin when I get tired of going against it most games
---
Hmm, maybe it doesn‚Äôt work with no mither then? I would say just trying to run a build with perks that encourage staying injured. Also, I haven‚Äôt gotten the trophy myself, my BF has, but I would check to see if syringes/styptics count for it. I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt, but the game has weird limiters on everything.
---
Can I get a link to the freddy rework?
---
I've never seen/heard of this. That's crazy.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me and my friends multiple times. Like I said, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a platform limited bug, but we play on PS4, so I know for sure it occurs there, but I don‚Äôt play PC or Xbox to know for sure.
---
I've legit been arguing with people all night saying survive with friends is balanced and rank means nothing. I mean most of the time it's true because people who have to play against lower-ranked killers on comms with overpowered shit like this, tend to not be very good at the game and overly altruistic.
---
Playing the game normally is not being a dick.
---
NOED is not being a dick. Punishing people for unhooking is not being a dick.
---
Play to your objective - if you're a killer, kill them. It doesn't really matter how. Camp them, tunnel them, slug them, bait them, whatever you need to do. Just don't intentionally exploit.
---
If you're a survivor, survive. Do totems, use pallets, fix gens, escape. Don't complain if a killer has NOED, it's your fault for not doing totems. Don't exploit.
---
There's no reason to "feel bad". It's just a game. Play the game. If endgame salt is a problem just leave and don't engage, or minimize the chat. They're just words from people you'll never meet.
---
True this, you always encounter some major bullshit that just makes you want to play the other side for a couple of rounds
---
One day you will get good and be able to do exactly the opposite of what the chart says and still get a 4K.
---
I live for thw post game salt if I see a tbag imma tunnel that bitch
---
Adrenaline doesn't heal you if you're broken.
---
They're probably masochists
---
Rip that 3rd guy lol
---
So will it only count if you dc before dying all the way or will it count if you dc even after dying whike others are still alive in the trial?  Do you have to sit there until they all die or escape?
---
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt make sense that you have to charge the ability... to throw a rock.
---
I think 90/75/60 cooldown wouldn‚Äôt be bad.
---
I once actually equipped it as a meme perk but it became very helpful against a perma-tier 3 camping Meyers. Got him to walk away enough times to save on the hook 2x, although post game he‚Äôll say he knew it was the pebble, he clearly wasn‚Äôt sure enough to go check on it. He then proceeded to explain to me the word pebble and it‚Äôs association with Diversion as if I wasn‚Äôt aware, it was so wack at the end of that game haha (he killed us all). Diversion now makes a rotation in my perk load out after this game bc you never know :)
---
The name triggers Me so bad mannnn üòÇ
---
Yeah. I get matches like this all the time. Anytime I complain about it I get downloaded to hell and insulted by people who probably haven't even touched killer Beyond rank 15. Big props to this killer for outscoring all of them
---
I play on Xbox and havent seen this before.
---
Looking to protect yourself? Or deal some DAMAGE?
---
dead hard has potential to be strong when it actually works, but it‚Äôs broken. Sometimes it will activate but you still get downed anyways OR you will use the ability and it won‚Äôt register at all, and the other times people don‚Äôt even use it for that they just use it to get to a pallet or window because they know it probably won‚Äôt work. Like many things, it‚Äôs very inconsistent, but when it works it‚Äôs strong but not OP. If you know they have it, just get close to them and bait it out. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to counter.
---
Exactly. A red rank Survivor is almost always going to stomp a rank 20 killer for example. Which is why they aren't matched together. If rank doesn't matter it wouldn't exist.
---
Purple ranks and red ranks are a night and day difference. Just like you said.
---
Maybe killer is more stressful to to you, but for me, it is easier than it has ever been since all the survivor nerfs. Nothing more stressful than playing solo survivor and not knowing if you will get camped or your teammates will refuse to do anything. The bp will be a nice incentive and perhaps people will feel more inclined to play both sides as they should. If there are less people playing killer, I doubt it would over bp considering they will still take in more with bbq. How about you think it through more.
---
Although I'm incredibly unlucky as Survivor. I could be purple Rank and still get matched with rank 20 noobs who don't know what they are doing and immediately suicide on hook or disconnect. I find it very very difficult and time-consuming to rank up my survivors because teammates are so infuriating.
---
Freddy right now is, I know it's unpopular, OK. His rework completely deletes old Freddy though and seems very unoriginal, weak, and boring- that's why I don't like it.
---
Get face camped by Bubba Dc
---
Cant play for 5 minutes
---
Just go outside
---
*Exposed*
---
Right lol
---
Yeah. That makes much more sense. He has a trench coat with pockets that could be full of Pebbles. Why do you have to stand in The Killers Terror radius for nearly a minute without being chased to pick up and throw a pebble? With that amount of time you can grab a hatchet from a locker and fight the Killer lmao.
---
that was like a wheres waldo
---
Oh yeah. Teabaggers get tunneled or get a Mori. I love when someone purposefully being toxic doesn't get their way and calls me toxic. Post-game salt is amazing
---
Damn dude... Sounds about trash. Honestly bro, you need practice at the game and get good. You can't win every game. If you lose don't post complains on Reddit about you getting prison raped.. man up, accept the "GGEZ" and move forward. If it's still hard, choose a different survivor. No one cares about your math tbh, just learn how to use wraith more efficiently or choose another killer. #ggez
---
Leatherface has the better teachables. Surveillance is good but barbecue and chili is so much better. It's worth it for the point bonus alone. Double points on all of your Killers without an offering.
---
Red is where im at as killer and purple as survivor. Idk which is worse lol.
---
So just like the game then.
---
Wait... a mobile game???
---
My q times are actually 1m to 5m now.  Cant complain.
---
I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt include micro sleep in the first place (since they used the rework Freddy lore, it was a stupid idea to tether his powers to original Freddy with sleepwalking head bobbers) as for his new powers‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre gonna be annoying‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm hoping the gen teleportation is locked to only himself and can‚Äôt be learned for others (I so don‚Äôt want the huntress to teleport and shove a hatchet in my back)
---
I‚Äôm really hoping they would do a super hero and villain collection one day.
---
I‚Äôve always just thought of it as process of elimination. Chasing a survivor off a hook could be seen as tunneling, but if you find four survivors and one is on death hook, your damn right I‚Äôm gonna take them out of the game
---
Yikes. Just don‚Äôt complain when you get hit with a 4 man swf with borrowed times, adrenalines, and d strikes then.

Why are there no instructions for how to do a flashlight save correctly?
---
In my experience at red ranks, wraiths do pretty well. A red rank wraith knows how to play wraith and can completely slaughter. I don‚Äôt think that the small gap is enough to make him unplayable. A good wraith can be difficult to play against, and with certain addons and perks, he can be so fast when he‚Äôs cloaked that you can‚Äôt get to a safe zone because he‚Äôs just faster than you and can block you completely. I think you might be underestimating him based on a small detail. I agree that in some people‚Äôs hands he can be pretty bad, but a player who puts in the time to learn and practice him can be completely unbeatable. The same goes for every killer, no matter how bad the community says they are.
---
dcing from.a game is -2 pips guranteed.
---
I've been in situations where I've attempted and got out. But if I enter struggle and know the person's about to get chased I usually just kill myself. I've actually helped at least 3 people get out this way, theyre usually very grateful and apologize for not coming to get me. I've met one of my usual swf that way
---
"Why would you even want death to be an escape, when juking is such a comfortable way out?" -Ace Visconti

Get killed first every game

You gotta get wglf if you are starting out though. Also balanced landing is Nea‚Äôs only good perk.
---
When they ran all the way to the corner just to self heal‚Ä¶ and here I am running behind (I could have been done with you long before that god damn it Baby Dwight!)
---
No it works with no mither that's how I managed to get the achievement
---
Once happened to me because I'm a super nervous player and I was trying to save a hooked David from the basement but I went slowly as our killer was the hag. He continued doing his gymnastics not even close to struggling and I got SO stressed out because of it I activated like five of the traps in front of him. I also was the only one who was able to escape (hatch) and didn't dare to write "GG" afterwards. I was feeling super guilty.
---
Some of the text is hard to read on the fire, other than that, decent flowchart for noobs.
---
Some text fixes:
---
*Are any of them hurt
---
You can also say "are they hurt" instead of "is he/she hurt", which is slightly easier to read.
---
That was so nice of you, I hope they're having lots of fun using him
---
See, I thought so. I personally haven‚Äôt tried getting that trophy, but I know my BF ran that for a good chunk of his attempts and he recently got the trophy.
---
LMAO
---
Family Residence is literally just bamboo the map. Good luck playing that without going against overly cocky survivors or something to help with aura. Plus it seems like each new map forgets about the huntress and ends up being massive with a ton of clutter. Meaning she is too slow to Traverse it and there's too much in the way to use her range. Good Luck winning with Huntress on Temple or Family Residence. I think they should make her 115%
---
These are all pretty good tips, but personally I would say self care isn‚Äôt really that good. You‚Äôre better off getting bond imo. Also, even if you have BT, don‚Äôt farm you‚Äôre teammates just because of that, only use it if killer is camping, or gates are open.
---
Lucky then
---
It's bugged right now; but some people rarely still get it.  Since it's the last one I need for 100% I really really want to know what anyone who's gotten it in June/July has done to get it.
---
Gives freddy the power to teleport faster, and with addons the repair speed changes
---
I told them that. They legit waste the other players items add-ons and offerings. They screw over their team and fuck the killer out of points as well. They were legit defending it saying that they can quit if they want or if the match isn't fun for them. They said getting hooked isn't Fun and that they don't want to stay in a match where they are hooked.
---
That would be like ditching your football team and leaving the stadium the moment the other team scores first.
---
Her power is to teleport to traps, that's just a cheap trick to screw with survivors and force a mistake
---
Some of us are pretty good with her on console
---
If a characters power is to fuck up ur controls that dumb af
---
In my opinion, so far, he doesn't look OP. He seems good, but not *that* good.
---
Problem is, experienced survivors will hear the blink at the start of the match, and after not seeing you all game will cleanse all totems.
---
My boyfriend just got it last week I think. Like I said, he would typically stay injured (using perks that rewarded that play style like iron will and resilience), and would make sure he was the first to get the unhook. He used we‚Äôll make it to encourage survivors to stay with him to let them heal, and he often had empathy to find injured people. For some of the games he would use no mither so he wouldn‚Äôt have to go out of his way to get injured first, but that is a more risky way of playing. We play on PS4, so I‚Äôm not sure that it‚Äôs bugged there since he got it.
---
Ruin, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Make your Choice and Devour Hope is a good build.
---
Gee, it‚Äôs almost like those exact things exist for every killer
---
Quentin and Jake
---
Lmao I literally used the same outfit b4 I got P3
---
I started running Small Game just to help me find Ruin and get accustomed to totem placements. So far it's only been helping me find 4 dull totems every game while the fifth with Hex: Ruin continues to exist in what I assume is a parallel dimension invisible to all our senses.
---
Noted for the upcoming parts
---
Technically you are not being forced to play survivor.... just saying
---
That's interesting.
---
I guess I'll just keep trying until it pops then.
---
Side question: Does your boyfriend play killer at all?
---
Slowing the game down is still slowing the game down. That survivor HAS to run around the map trying to get that trap off or they die. That's time spent not working on a generator or healing/ saving teammates.
---
Some Doc players don't even use shocks for some odd reason.
---
They said if the killer DC's, then survivors pip as if they escaped and all their items/add ons/offerings are refunded as far as I know.
---
Then you say they're wrong and explain it to them
---
I played a game a few days ago where I got the thing where I couldn't leave through the exit and the killer had closed the hatch. I went to the other door to open it, they pulled me off and killed me. I was beyond pissed
---
Same.
---
Yep, we both play killer pretty regularly, though his choices of killer are more controversial lol he really enjoys playing freddy.
---
why she look like she bput to give her blood to the warden of a pocket dimension
---
Freddy main, that‚Äôs sad
---
Literally happened to me the other way 'round. I was sitting in the locker and a team mate was trying to hide from the killer. Unfortunately this was the only locker in that area :'D
---
Yeah, unfortunately there are people out there like that,  I mean, you beat the killer and the game was broken and wouldn‚Äôt end, the killer should‚Äôve let you go through the other exit gate
---
This man gets it
---
a good trick is to start searching for a killer match before you're ready to start playing, especially if theres anything else u can do in the meantime as u wait, like whatever keeps u busy
---
It took them 3 years but they finally did it.
---
it's not that the devs are scared of backlash, they're just extremely slow. Frankly, they've already mentioned how they had to bent the mechanics of the old unity engine to make things work, and upgrading the game engine brought a million problems with it.
---
Ohhh you have just a 6 I assumed you had a 6s and up.
---
If you pull the plug instead of hitting the button, you keep your BP and get your escape points alongside any pips you would've gotten if you finished the match.
---
How exactly is it sad?
---
Well, you do live up to your name
---
Dont try to mind game
---
Yeah. It's basically a free Escape where you do whatever you can to get bloodpoints before leaving. Usually that involves the killer hitting or hooking and letting you get those unhooks or heels. Doing generators. Pallet stunning and totems.
---
You try to maximize points before leaving. Not the way the game was meant to be played but if that's what people want to do with their time then go ahead.
---
Nice, a fellow killer that appreciates classiness
---
I can‚Äôt beat the shit out of you without getting closer
---
I asked how to farm.
---
You are crazy if u think that a perk like that would be balanced. With this perk you better prepare your ass for all the slug builds in the planet. This kind of things are why BHVR shouldnt give a fuck about what the community says and just take a team of rank 1 hardcore players for balancing.
---
Running back does not work anymore
---
It's worse when you're on 1st hook, with adrenaline, 1 gen left, and you see auras stop gens and come running to you...I mean I love the altruism, but I'd so much rather they pop that gen.
---
I think the increases BP gains should swing some of the survivors back. I know plenty of survivor mains that farm killer for bps on their rank 30 "I guess I have to" killer lol
---
Not sure if it matters if he had three kills or not, so long as he wasn't a toxic killer.
---
You also mentioned michael with a chainsaw, what's going on there?
---
Do you have a version of this without text?
---
I never trust the huntress when they leave the area (had one too many encounters where I get saved just for a flying hatchet to just down me 2 seconds later out of nowhere)
---
Wait you can switch back to your original country? I‚Äôve been playing with my phone set to denmark this entire time!
---
When it comes right down to it, this is almost no different from a group of survivors intentionally taking hits for one another. Biggest difference is they'd essentially be forcing you to hit them and take the cooldown (stun).
---
Also, when you have four survivors stacking the same perk, it generally is a worst-case scenario. Not too different from 4x Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, or any other fairly powerful perk.
---
Calm spirit is bugged you die gassed on second hook sense you don‚Äôt scream
---
I know i know, I'm just tired and disheartened by it over the years
---
"Entity's Ire"
---
Survivors that stay in the area of the exit gate for 60/45/30 seconds attract the ire of the entity. Survivors with this effect can no longer exit through a gate. The hatch will still be usable as normal once all other survivors have left.
---
This perk not only slaps them for being rude, but also slaps everyone if more than one person decides to camp the exit.
---
Holy moly. I didn‚Äôt know that. Is this recent?
---
We need answers
---
‚ÄúShe either looks like Golem or the most beautiful woman you‚Äôve ever seen‚Äù
---
-Farmer John
---
The fact that you censor'd the only actual letter in the killers name makes me upvote this.
---
I think if you unhooked faster it would be decent. This way you can counter the "being pulled off a hook save" times partially.
---
step 1. put on play with your food
---
step 2. put on high stimulus electrode
---
step 3. stay in treatment mode
---
maximum shonk
---
No, good survivors will be well prepare for you since your lullaby radius doesn't  change.
---
It can be helpful on her yes. But it messes with her fov and totally throws her am off as well. She throws high with Monitor and abuse and unfortunately there's not much to do but practice.
---
The downswing? That's... unfortunate. Especially weird, since I thought I've gotten a hit with it before.
---
Infinite sprint burst
---
As far as I'm aware it's just been a bug that's always kind of flown under the radar but it's definitely more noticeable now
---
First build is a good counter to the spirit.
---
Drop them near the hatch let them crawl near it then place them on a hook
---
Technician is useless
---
now this does put a smile on my face
---
That ain‚Äôt nice
---
Legion mains are just sitting in a corner crying they're eyes out just think about this I should know... I am one.üò≠
---
Because they are? There's a reason why you rarely see brand new parts in games, in their current state it's much easier to just ignore they even exist as a survivor. Instaheals are a different story, though.
---
I only got salty ones :(
---
&gt;!He was the only one who actually disappeared in thin air!&lt;
---
If someone is on a hook near the gate you open, and it's the first gate opened, survivors will be forced to make dumber plays than they would've. They don't have infinite time to wait for the killer to get bored, and so have to run in whether it's a good idea or not. Either that, or they wise up and exit. This is especially useful on characters with instadowns, since you can force a hook trade this way.
---
Ow, Swf will love Fight or Flight.
---
Me too! It‚Äôs my favorite theme.
---
It should just be a flat CD rather than a TR based one. It turns an ok perk into a borderline useless perk against a few killers.
---
They are character specific perks.
---
Like ruin belongs to the hag. If you level her to 35 (IIRC) you can unlock the perk for all other killers.
---
Do you have the teachables for those perks unlocked?
---
Yeah. Good luck getting this perk on any high-mobility killer or any stealth killer. Pebble needs to be a cool down timer like quick and quiet
---
When the gens are finished, but the EGC hasn't started, the killer can now interact with the switch to force the gate open, starting EGC right then.
---
There was also a tweet relating to Netflix partnering up with Behavior, with a reply from Mathieu Cote himself saying oh hi to the netfix account. So this is even more evidence.
---
I just hook the closest person I know of, unless there are two people left, then I down both first
---
Oh no I get it now are they only available in the shrine
---
Ah right thx
---
Yeah, adept refers to their adept achievements where you are supposed to escape with only running their three perks. If this wasn‚Äôt adept David should be higher, but no mither sucks and we‚Äôre going to live forever doesn‚Äôt help you escape. I‚Äôd agree with his placement since adept
---
Nah you can get the perks from other killers bloodwebs. The Hag has Hex: Ruin that you can get by leveling her up to level 35, and from there on you can have it on any other killer
---
When the killer thinks you‚Äôre trapped in there with him, but really he‚Äôs trapped in there with you.
---
I'm just surprised that they let it last this long. There's no feasible way to EVER hit 8k survival in a normal game. You'd have to force yourself into one of the 7 killers' powers like a dozen times, self-care yourself every chance you get, AND escape to max the category out, maybe throw in a kobe if you're lucky.
---
Claudette.
---
She camos well + I like her perks.
---
Yes
---
No, because it still changes with distance, not direction, and Monitor only effects her terror radius, not her lullaby.
---
I've heard that silent doctor is a build but I've never actually encountered one in-game.
---
I've been told that some do it until the 5th gen is finished and only then go into treatment to get screams from any survivors hiding near the gates till the doctor checks and leaves
---
Not much point having autodidact with perks that speed up your healing because the quicker you heal the fewer skill checks you'll get.
---
Finally. 3 years later they finally give a shit, yay.
---
To be fair though, Calm Spirit was never that good and makes less than 5 seconds difference.
---
Bro, I‚Äôd love to see Hopper as the survivor. Either that or Billy
---
This is probably what‚Äôs gonna happen if anyone needs a rework (they‚Äôll just take whatever ability is good/not too out of place in another‚Äôs kit, and just slap it into the reworked killer)
---
We don't need no stinking '???' step, we've got our profits perfectly figured out here in the shonk market
---
If only
---
True. It's only good against doctor and spirit. Very very situational.
---
good
---
I understand that entering a locker inflicts blindness on *you* but I didn't know it also does it to the killer. Is this a new patch?
---
Now that's something I'd pay money for. Holy hell, no shit, upvote the shit out of this. Devs have to take note.
---
Instead of technician, quick and quiet
---
They sound super similar agreed
---
I will teabag pallets once my swf partner has already been hooked for exactly this reason
---
I don't actually play as doctor much, but I absolutely love stylin on the survivors in that outfit
---
Bro I better get shirtless Myers and bikini huntress
---
No biggy, but let's just agree to disagree here. I actually hope you're right, I just don't see it happening. I also don't wanna see franklin's become the meta, because it definitely would be picked way more often (unavoidably).
---
Standard game. Loops, got 1 kill. Eventually, when there was 1 gen left, I found a Kate. I knocked her down, and, she had boil over. I didn't see the hook that was literally 5 meters away from me, and tried to take her to the basement, and by the Freezer place (The Game Map). I eventually found a hook in the blue barrel room, and forgot I had Blood Wareden, hooked her (whilst feeling like a moron). But the last gen popped during all of this. So when I saw the aura of one of the Clauds, I knew I could silk up another kill. But she kept running for the other game, she was fast as fuck boiii. But, Blood Warden was still active. And during the Dream Transition, the timer went out, and they both died. This is so sad, Alexa, play Despacito.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm glad people liked it. :)
---
Well it did for me just yesterday lol
---
bro this is honestly epic style. Good work
---
No worries, happens to everyone and no harm has been done :D
---
My name is Meg Allen and i‚Äôm the fastest survivor alive.
---
Actually why the fuck are people dcing? Being hooked once early on is fine, Also you still get your blood points when you die buy not when you dc.
---
And yes, they wanted to teabag me at the exit gates. That's what the title is aiming at.
---
Seems like it is not compatible with razer phone 2 according to play store.. I downloaded the apk anyways and it just keeps crashing as I'm being rescued off the hook in the tutorial! Anyone else getting this exact crash or is it my phone? Is anyone actually using razer phone at all? Already reported it to bhvr...!

The best advice i can give you is learn from your killer games.
---
Remember the survivors that loop you around, and remember the way the run. Next time you are survivor on that map try to mimic them and follow their routes. With time you will learn with how much you can get away, like 'can i run another round or do i need to drop the pallet'
---
Or 'is the distance the killer has on me enough to vault that  window, or should i fake the window to provoke a missing lunge'
---
Also choose an exhaustion perk and play around it. Like balanced landing, you want to be aware of places you can run to and drop down if the killer is onto you, or dead hard, with that you want to be near pallet loops to use it to get close to a pallet, or window, while making the killer miss you to get enough time to make it to safety.
---
just hit the skillchecks
---
I ship this
---
I was playing killer and I could see a silhouette of survivors blocking the aura of the generator. So basically if they were standing between me and the generator I would know where they were because the aura of the generator had a survivor shaped cutout in it
---
Umm.. wouldn't that would initiate EGC?
---
*Type of Bug:* Ingame - Escape is not an escape
---
*Description:* Once exit gates are open and you cross the "escape line" it often does not trigger an "escape". You are left in the area behind the map. Sometimes it drops you back into the map or back behind the exit. Running to the other exit also doesnt work. Hatch sometimes allows an escape. EGC kills when you should have escaped.

I am a Freddy main, I have always been ever since I bought him in late 2018. I have gotten Prestige 5 basically (P3 on PS4 and P2 on PC). He's fun, the salt is the best part. But the Freddy rework? I don't want him to be another Hag. I like the imaginary pallets, but I think that it should be a free thing, not an add on. The first power to have 2 changable sides. Like, click on the power in the inventory screen to change it. The traps feel like they're gonna be underpowered. The imaginary pallets are better, but still, bad. Or at least make it possible to switch between the old and new Freddy. I'll still play as him, but I'm not happy with the rework. He isn't going to go any lower in terms of tier, probably around the pig? Also, new players. The problem with the first (current) Freddy, is that newer players have a hard time against him, but, isn't this Freddy more complicated?. He's probably going to get heavily nerfed within like a weak, they're gonna regret it, and now we're going to have to wait for a second rework. These devs are amazing. I just really feel like he should've gotten a propper buff, not a rework. For example, 5 second fall asleep, constant pill bottle (change the add on), and have a ranged aura reading to compensate. If we we're to compare to the Nurse, of course, Freddy would still be weaker. But he'll get to land first hits easier. Maybe show glimpses if multiple survivors are falling asleep at the same time? I think that at the end of the day, it was needed. But I also feel like all Freddy mains can agree with the fact that the older Freddy (current) was a better Freddy and that he should've gotten a buff, not a rework.
---
Trapper is decent since he can ‚Äúinstadown‚Äù and cut off loops
---
Look, do you understand why we hate players like yourself? The kinds where you just instantly judge that a new killer is going to be bad before its even out? Do you understand why we lose our patience for people who only slightly jump the gun? It happens. Every. Damn. Time. And quite frankly, we're sick of it. Make up your own decisions. But I at least have faith that the devs will do Freddy right. You on the other hand can continue acting like this. Just don't bring it into the Reddit.
---
Get rid of We'll Make It for Spine Chill, or anything else really. The 1st counts against Autodidact and Spine Chill is one of the few that synergize with it. That Jane perk that heals you while you are healing others might be a better niche than Botany as well. You want as many skill checks as possible.
---
deliverance is definitely good paired with decisive
---
Tapp is the best soundwise, and Ace is pretty good too
---
Accidentally clicks decline.
---
Bill, Love L4D and hes got some good perks. Also:
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
---
Oh no I‚Äôm rarted
---
The traps are clearly meant to help him against pallet loops though
---
stake out is honestly good if you have shit hearing aka me
---
Laughs in built in iron will

No she only let's them starve to death :')

Can I just give a thank-you to the team for this? Paired with the anti-DC lockout, I really hope this'll cut off a good number of the reasons that people DC out of spite.
---
i‚Äôd run it on every killer
---
Brb playing Claudette with pink cosmetics to spite on P3 aces

On console, Nurse is the one unusable, so that might happen again with Billy on mobile ...

Yea, but at least her power works on console

Yeah! Beta got released yesterday for Scandinavia
---
Repost
---
This came after I went against a 4 stack of torches containing 2 rank 6s
---
I'm pretty interested in seeing the balance of survivors remaining asleep in action. Having the gen teleport cool down greatly reduced will be nice for Freddy but nice enough to convince survivors to repeatedly make the effort to wake up?
---
TFW you don't own Doctor, but want to main him just to dick around
---
adept doctor sucks. m&amp;a hurts him and overwhelming isn‚Äôt very good
---
Then theirs always the randoms that look for ruin the whole match, die, you end up finding it while going to another gen.
---
I think billy may just be fucking horrible on Mobile anyways because you can‚Äôt really turn well with a phone anyways.
---
When I want a match for survivor I gotta wait so long, many times. But when I play a killer, I got matches instantly. üòë
---
I will bring it into the reddit as I please. Your disapproval or hate doesn't concern me. I know the devs will not do him right, as they have failed so often before.
---
I am absolutely thrilled about this, been wanting that for a long time. I foresee future issues with hostage situations where the killer keeps you trapped for a very long time lest you disconnect but I suppose those can be handled through the report system.
---
Yeah, they *definitely* arent currently active.  Honestly if this is how the dedicated servers played Id probably quit.  I still have to wait like 10-15 minutes for a killer queue it's rough.  
---
Gameplay is a lot worse as survivor currently, so both sides should benefit  :D
---
Only when survivors agree to only finish gens after getting all of them to 50%
---
Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
---
Billie Eillish confirmed as the next killer!
---
I dig this, but there could be this one and then two other variants with leggings and the skirt with color variants
---
Thanks man :)
---
Thanks üòÉ
---
In my opinion, I think that the new 'buff' is really a debuff.
---
Even though I'm not a Freddy main
---
Can I have the green ranks you face? I'm green rank with survivor, and my teammates go down to goddamn Freddy before even a single gen is done, Myers tend to snowball pretty well too against them.
---
I can't give you much advice, but mapping turn left and right on Q and E makes it a bit easier.
---
But i want to say i tried learning billy as well and still suck with him, but i picked up nurse very quickly and got pretty good with her quickly. Some people are just not made for billy i guess.
---
Just to clarify, does the lock-out affect both roles each time? Say you DC as survivor, do you also get a lock-out when you try to play killer? Or are you just locked on a per-role basis?
---
that sucks going against survivors who are higher rank than you, hopefully the new matchmaking fixes can help solve the issue, youre also not the only, this happens to everyone.
---
Did-did you just put suprised pikachu face... On the doctor?
---
Not to me
---
You could say. I did draw this last year in, like, March or April though lol
---
They just didn't deal with adrenaline much then.
---
At least the new Freddy can just catch up and hit again, without having to close a huge gap*just to tag them* and then wait 3-7 seconds.
---
How is this not an incredibly op idea? Why do survivors need MORE tools to dictate the flow of the game?
---
Yea, but surprisingly it's not as bad for me but I can't speak for other people
---
Why on earth would it be exclusive on Xbox?
---
One day you will get matched with rank 20s trying the game on a free weekend and be able to do exactly the opposite of what the chart says and still get a 4K. 
---
Unless you are playing Nurse.
---
There. Fixed it for you.
---
Pretty good build, pgtw is mainly a perk filler slot imo, so that could be changed out for whatever but yeah really solid build
---
remember to always use overcharge
---
Cool I'll just try to Kobe 3 times and let go instead. I guess I can't deny you your BBQ stacks anymore tho, grats.
---
Oh shit! I was a Francis main and Bill on L4D and then Ellis or Coach in L4D2... Depending on which of my friends I was playing with lol
---
It's not, the matchmaking is known to be quite wonky at times, and if people group up with different ranks it throws all logic out the window.
---
Take the experience from a (supposedly) good survivor and use it to grow as a killer.
---
As long as they have a way of detecting real disconnects from intentional ones, i have no problems with this.
---
You wanna be toxic and DC then you get to take a break from the game for a bit.
---
Nah no downvotes necessary mate, that's pretty smart. T bags aren't inherently toxic, context is important.
---
Really wholesome, you know I wish people were more like that. In the words of Ghandi, "be the change you'd want to see in the world." 
---
Sadly, I'm too broke to be this change. It's great to see others be so kind
---
I'm on console. I'm not putting myself through learning nurse lol
---
I make sure to slap it on the moment I spot a key &gt;:D
---
Getting hit while vaulting windows isn't broken, but pallet hits are. Killers can (rightly) swing through the window and hit a small area on the other side. The hitboxes are shit because it's uniform for all killer weapons and all survivors. So every killer is swinging a long baseball bat disguised as any various weapon, and every survivor has a hit box big enough for the large male survivors.
---
Hey already confirmed that another company is developing the mobile game
---
I disagree.  People bitch a lot about how models don't match hitboxes.  
---
As far as after a vault goes, killers can reach through windows if you're close enough.  This makes sense, since you could do that Irl.  
---
As far as the pallet stun goes, that'd be you throwing the pallet too late.  If the hit lands right after they get stunned, well, the hit landed.  That makes sense to me.  
---
Both of these things can get annoying as survivor ~~Lithe makes me upset when I get hit~~ but I don't think either is unfair.  If they couldn't swing through the pallet or a window, looping would be even more broken.
---
Ok, that's fair. 
---
But my point was if you just cannot get the hang of billy there's alternatives. Like spirit, or even huntress.
---
I play both sides equally, and when I happen to be playing survivor and one of my SWF teammates complains about getting tunneled I just say ‚Äútunneling? You mean ‚Äòefficient killing?‚Äô‚Äù
---
Like old Freddy
---
You what!
---
M and A is God tier on hag, imho, if you are using a camo dark skin anyway. The amount of gen grabs or free hits I've gotten from that combo, even at middle ranks, is ridiculous
---
Which Dance Gavin Dance album is this?
---
I've seen lots of killer swing at people and just end up hitting an invisible solid object...
---
I saw a Dwight get hit straight in the back, but the killer's weapon just bounced off.
---
MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP

Slap some door opening reduction on that bad boy and it will be good to go, also fits thematically.

Description: survivors obscure auras. This means if a survivor stands between me and a trap or generator, their silhouette will obscure the aura and I will know exactly where they are
---
And an absolute unit
---
I heard this meme as if I was playing on that map
---
The boosts you propose are way too high.
---
Or just get good at running, looping and mind gaming. For both sides.
---
This way it will great when a players disconnects
---
Its not even the image but I heard the sound.
---
I downed someone stupid enough to let me feed off them while they were at the exit gate and started to t bag me and I downed them üòÇ it was great. I love downing survivors who try to do that stuff and then get killed.
---
I agree. The increase should only be about 5% per survivor dead or 10%. 25% is to much
---
Streetwise is literally useless and UE is only useful for blendettes that hide all game and don‚Äôt do anything for the team.
---
You got 6,000 auric cells for free and had to wait to get them? Outrageous!
---
Is there a danger to doing that? What if I get reported?
---
That's exactly why these posts are needed! I've found a lot of nice people through dbd though, made some new friends. I absolutely love this game
---
Like I said I was thankful and all I‚Äôm just a little tilted I didn‚Äôt get em sooner when the sale was goin on
---
I am gonna miss old Freddy. With just over 250 hours clocked in to that bad boy of a killer, I can‚Äôt help but cry a little. Goodbye old friend.
---

All around me are familiar faces, worn off places

---
I found a cool survivor who moonwalked on console today, and i helped him set up his reddit so he could post his stuff here! I love seeing people getting more involved in this community :)
---
I mean nothing can happen now but you won‚Äôt be a very good teammate...
---
Tell me about it. I was playing SWF with a dude earlier and I was on the ground and the killer was looking for him and he said ‚Äúalright, found the hatch, disconnect quick.‚Äù It pissed me off that he would even consider me the kind of person to do that. So I messaged the killer and told him where he was.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not my thing to do suggestions but I agree, even if it is level three
---
Sorry, I just can‚Äôt take you seriously.
---
Love that gen
---
True, I don‚Äôt want to screw my teammates. Maybe I‚Äôll just try and evade the killer and be the first to die.
---
Well technically that‚Äôs wake up
---
I mean if you play the game like normal it will set you back if you do poorly, I would honestly just say play but if it‚Äôs too hard just try for a bit then die
---
Wow what a character, I don't envy anyone who has to deal with you on a daily basis
---
Claudette and Kate :)
---
It doesn‚Äôt work. Because SOMEBODY finished that gen.. so you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúNobody:.‚Äù
---
Wow! Close call! I almost thought you were going to hit a trap on the other side of that pallet ngl
---
Gosh, that would be so amazing. I‚Äôm gonna put that the doctor doll in my bed, even definitely I‚Äôm gonna have a nightmare.
---
I‚Äôm still only 3 days into the game so I‚Äôm still learning the basics.... that‚Äôs why I feel like I could move at my pace better if I wasn‚Äôt going with people who already know how to play.
---
Trust me when I say a lot of rank 10‚Äôa can be absolute potato‚Äôs lmao but ya, do what‚Äôs best for you dude and just have fun
---
I remember playing the force unleashed when i was little. This is a very accurate representation lol
---
You are opening admitting that you will bring toxicity to the subreddit? Ugh... Fine. Go for it my guy. But downvotes and being shunned to high hell will come suit.
---
Or wait for your team to save you? Wtf?

It's called follow suit. Mind your language. And I'm not bringing toxicity, but rather concerns.
---
Is that Jack next to you?
---
Yeah that's actually delusional lol. Imagine dying in a game about dying.

But you remember that your running NOED on a killer that has an exposed status power and your completely fine, dbd in a nutshell
---
Pretty much what you said sadly. More often then not against Freddy, the Freddy will just chase 1 person non-stop the entire match until they're dead. In reality as with any killer if you play him well you can get a couple of kills nearly guaranteed.
---
Nah i meant keep the other stuff and the getting stronger with people dead, and then add some door reduction, with last person alive at least matching wake up (if not more).
---
Wake up should also be buffed though.
---
So do i. If they are gonna fuck her out of her hatchets, at least let her have a better chance in chases.
---
Yes but the killer should still be punished as well.
---
If your going to be a God/Ghostface main, these are usually the perks you want to run:
---
Shadowborn, BBQ n' Chilli, Hex: Ruin, and a perk of choice, I run Enduring, but Save The Best For Last works amazing aswell
---
Shadowborn allows you to stalk from a wider angel, BBQ to find survivors to stalk asap, Ruin, because, Ghostface needs it, to slow the game down, just a lil' bot and Enduring for looping, or Save The Best For Last to machinegun some bois. 
---
For your current build, switch our Furtive Chase for Sloppy when you get it. It's kinda the Elegy for GTA Online, it's decent for newer players, and free, but there's better alternatives. Same thing here, Nurses is basically a better Sloppy. Switch out I'm all ears out for NOED. It's a scummy perk, but, you the killer does what you have to. It eleavites the fear of the end game. If you get Freddy to level 40, you can get Bloodwarden, to punish survivors trying to teabag you. Thrilling Tremors, is about as good as BBQ. Yes, no extra BP, and you can't see surviors aura specifically, and it can only trigger once every 80 seconds? And only when you pick someone up. But it can punish survivors getting of the gen to not get found, as it is a 16 second activation time. Those who stay, you can go to and stalk, and one shot. Amazing perk replacement for BBQ. And Deerstalker. Just no. Don't run it. Get a better perk, like Ruin. I can tell your on console, so your Hag is free. Level her up to level 35, get Ruin, done. It's hella worth it. Good luck.
---
Then just kill yourself on hook, get your points, and dip. I know it's stupid in that sense but something has to be done about these dumbasses who disconnect when they are too dumb to get into a locker when the killer isn't looking.
---
Staying in the same loop after activating lithe is pretty much a waste of the perk the speedboost is meaned to help you getting away
---
You know what they say, ‚Äúthe enemy of my teammate is a friend.‚Äù
---
Don't use ruin - you want to get destroyed with Billy to learn him. He has enough map control for it to not be a necessity.  
---
As for the chainsaw, you need to practice. Learn how to curve well, how to chainsaw bait, and don't respect pallets so you can get free chainsaws if the survivor doesn't drop the pallet.  
---
You also don't want to use charge/cooldown add-ons; you're better off using no add-ons or bumper/silent add-ons, as they don't mess with your timing or make you very powerful.
---
This would break the game further.  Just look at F13 where Jason gets surrounded and chain stunned with baseball bats, firecrackers, gets shot with guns, the campers can even straight up kill him with the right circumstances.  Killer bullying is already easy enough to do as it is.
---
and here is the killer that i have prestige 3:                 
---
. nice job man
---
Yeah, If a killer can use the good stuff, survivors should be able to use the good stuff, but I see more complaining about killer perks than survivor perks when survivors have like 10 meta perks and killers have 5.
---
I can't run it yet sadly. I have a relatively fast phone (Samsung A8 2018). idk if they'll change that. And no, progress will not carry over. Sad life, and realtively bad devs.
---
But, I know I'm not supposed to give my opinon, but that Left Behind, is looking spicy. But it's a hella bad perk. Lightweight, is also bad. But it's better.
---
Oooh ok just affects his traps and whatnot. K cool
---
No. If you stun the killer you should be on the other side in safety. If the killer breaks the pallet run to something else that can get your lithe off. If he runs around the pallet then you can vault and get to another loop, with the option of coming back if the pallet is safe enough.
---
I too enjoy the game when the killer walks past an injured survivor to chase me, the uninjured already-hooked person.
---
Only when trying to give belly rubs
---
Tunneling is not always common sense. You‚Äôre not going to mindlessly focus on that survivor that looped you for 2-3 gens. If you tunnel a survivor that just got unhooked you‚Äôre leaving 3 healthy people to do gens. 
---
If by chance you find the guy that got unhooked, hook him. Go for it. Wanting to get rid of the weakest links quickly can be effective but at high ranks tunneling is often not that great of a strategy to use. 
---
Also survivors usually complain about ‚Äúhard tunneling‚Äù the most. That‚Äôs when the killer just ignores everyone else even though they are literally offering him free hits just to hook that guy again. 
---
You see a guy farming his teammate? Go for the farmer. Yeah you can hit the unhooked. But he might have BT. Tunneling can be a good strat as killer though it‚Äôs unfun for survivors. But not always
---
It works for 6s doesn‚Äôt it?
---
That only happens when you first start playing Myers.
---
Now when you get to Shirtless Myers status, that popping of tier 3 fucks them up every time... it‚Äôs all about knowing when to surprise them with it
---
Same, tbh the game is good but hitboxes are even worse on the mobile version
---
Myers just became sans there for a second.
---
I was playing legion and slaughtered this guy's teammates. He was the only one that I actually lost in chases and he was smart until he did an oopsie and vaulted into me. I was gonna hook him but hatch spawned right next to him so I let him have it.
---
Ha! But for real. We can get a killer with that name. There is a urban legend about an old woman with a half cat face from china. Now if only devs will take a look at it..
---
Over-simplifying it: each time you DC the timeout between games will be longer. Each time you play without DC the timeout between games will be shorter.
---
The chase is the best part.
---
Before dying. If it's the other way then that's retarded.
---
I still don't know where it is from...
---
I feel the same way, the fake pallets and gen teleporting will be fun tho
---
Well canonically he only has one eye he can see out of.
---
He's the Bubb guy *throws chainsaw tantrum*
---
THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM!
---
They should add: exhaustion perks are disabled until the speed boost for being hit is complete.
---
Me and my lithe would be happy.
---
sams undertale :)
---
You had 1 rank 4 and the rest were 16 or higher. So clearly it‚Äôs a swf. That‚Äôs not too bad
---
You're ignoring what I'm saying. There is a WOUNDED survivor, ripe to be hooked, that the killer literally walks around, in order to get to me, the uninjured survivor 100 feet away, just because I've already been hooked a single time. That's stupid decisionmaking and inarguably is tunneling.
---
Getting the perks on any character requires unlocking the teachable version of that perk. You must level the character who starts with the desired perk in order to gain access to the teachable version, which will appear as an option in their bloodweb at levels 30, 35, or 40 (as there are three teachables per character). After the teachable is aquired on that character, the perk will begin to appear in newly generated bloodwebs for other characters as well. It works the same way for survivors and killers.  
---
I would only recommend purchasing perks from the shrine if they are for a DLC character that cannot be unlocked using the iridescent shard currency, which can be earned in game. If you decide get a character, you can gain access to their teachables fairly quickly anyways.
---
Ash because he should be the only survivor anyone chooses.
---
Did they try to save the Kate
---
Dwellis
---
1) It really doesn't matter what it is. Follow suit or come suit. Po-Tay-To, Po-Tar-To  
---
2) You are in fact bringing toxicity by calling it garbage WHEN YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED IT OUT YET.   
---
What is it with this subreddit thinking something is good or bad when they haven't even gotten their hands on it yet.
---
Same, I don't mind tbagging during the match and what not and I generally only respond with giving slaps or shaking my head but some people just explode when you do that.
---
Which is a shame. Hell I even had a survivor snap at me because I pretended to go hook them before turning around dumping them on hatch. I was just playing around and they acted like I was an asshole.
---
An explanation on why it works: if you wait too long, then the killer will hit you "right" before the pallet hits them, allowing both things to happen, think of it visually, while the pallet is falling, the hand or weapon can still be where the pallet isn't yet and hit someone, then get stunned. The other thing to consider is that killers are hosting the match, so things happen to them faster than you. On your end you might see yourself being safe and tossing the pallet before they're too close, but since you have ping, you won't see that the killer is actually closer.
---
Did it release for App Sptre and Google Play?
---
If the killer is dumb enough to chase me, an uninjured survivor who loves being chased, and ignore the guy who he could easily down and get on a hook, thus slowing down generator repairs, then let him make the stupid choice. I didn‚Äôt miss what you said. I just pointed out that if it were me, I‚Äôd be thrilled. Because I love being chased and that‚Äôs 3 people that can be doing our objective while I am.
---
Still in beta and still only for Scandinavia. I've heard people say if you change your Play Stores region to a Scandinavian country then you can get it.
---
It's too bad they don't put as much effort into solving the reasons why people DC. Reworking Badham over the shit map that is Haddonfield is a joke. Or "Oh the killer is just going to slug every single person and never hook anyone so you spend 30 minutes between attempting to do a gen and lying on the ground having the most enjoyable experience". Or maybe take a look at some of the addons you guys thought would be good ideas.
---
Sure there are a lot of times people DC on the first down for no real good reason, but there are also some times were you do it just so you don't have to waste 40 minutes of your life being miserable.
---
I am speed
---
Well you don‚Äôt use the chainsaw to break pallets if the survivors do that then, eventually the survivor will use all the pallets in the general area and that generator becomes unsafe for survivors as you can just 1 shot anyone in that region of the map because they have no cover. Freddy doesn‚Äôt stall gens because you lose like 2% by missing a skill check, if you‚Äôre taking 7 seconds at minimum to take 2% off gen progress or whatever the percentage is than you‚Äôre completely wasting your time not to mention that survivors can just ignore missing a skill check can just work on gens regardless if you can see their aura or not or if they just snap each other out of it.  His power stalls the game for like 10 seconds in turn for like 2 minutes of effort rather than just killing and hooking a survivors which wastes far more time for the survivors to come unhook the survivor and then at minimum there‚Äôs 2 survivors not working on a gen. There are perks that do better at stalling the game than Freddy‚Äôs power.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me a couple of times.  Not sure what causes it but it need to be fixed ASAP.
---
That was more of an ass cheeks tightening moment
---
Yeah I forgot about her low height, its been a while since I played Hag but she was my first main
---
That scared the shit outta me ngl
---
I think if a perk like this was added it should be less effective the more people who bring it. (Kind of like an idea i had for DC. The more people who had DC the less the stun time would be regardless of it's rank.) Just a thought.
---
Agreed. (I should make a note here though, the highest rank I have played on is rank 8 (Please dont hurt me)) Honestly my comment there was mainly to piss of toxic suvivors, secondarily to make an argument. You certinly made a lot better explanation than I provided. 
---
Even though I am aware of the facts you provided, sometimes I find myself just mindlessly chasing someone, fueled by my frustration, longer it takes to hit him, less focused I become.
---
Those senarios mostly end with 5 gens popping out of nowgere while I got buttdanced all over the map.
---
Why did you go into so much trouble to make a whole flowchart when your whole message is just:
---
"Kill whoever dies the fastest"
---
Yeah and to top it off, tons of trees added to Macmillan estate too. Blocking her shots.
---
This shit again?
---
This really is a bruh moment.
---
Instead I think that the total time the boosts last are stacked and lithe doesn‚Äôt go longer by default
---
Didnt have anything better to do.
---
Honestly we just need new objectives. Something besides m1+spacebar for 80 seconds 5 times each
---
Because you don't have to try it out to make an educated guess on how it is going to be. What is it with this subreddit thinking they aren't smart enough to judge something accurately just with the information provided to them.
---
Iron Will btw
---
Plus it sounds to me like entitled survivors need to make up their mind. Is tunneling a killer going after an uninjured survivor who has already been hooked, or a killer going after whichever survivor is injured? Because now when I‚Äôm playing killer it sounds like I have to sit and plan everything out before I chase someone. ‚ÄúOkay that guy is injured but he hasn‚Äôt been hooked, so I should go for him. But that might be tunneling.. the other guy on the gen was just on the hook. I can‚Äôt go for him. But he‚Äôs only been on hook once. That guys dead on hook I certainly can‚Äôt go for him.. wait where‚Äôd they go? Damn I wasted too much time trying to be fair. Hey, there‚Äôs someone!‚Äù *sprint bursts away*

Her skirt will be called:

Ready to run when the slightest decibel of a heartbeat is present

did you know that there's a 50% action speed slow down in the dream world..... you cant just ignore that
---
A game where you're supposed to die more than escape. 
---
**Quits on the first hook because its not fun being hooked**
---
Oh okay, I getcha
---
I'd honestly pay good money for more art like this. Seeing both the killers and survivors just chilling between trials within their respective areas.
---
For a sec I read it as caulifla and was like wtf would the killers even do haha
---
Alright. Fuck it. I'm done. We have reached peak stupidity.
---
Oh no, you had managed that a few replies ago.
---
Hey, at least they give a shit. They could easily not give this to us *at all*. Be grateful that they did this, man.
---
Or, or, hear me out here....
---
You don't depend on perks to win.
---
Don‚Äôt think you know how these type of memes work
---
I‚Äôm stealing Pain in the Ass
---
This flowchart doesn‚Äôt mention anything about map pressure. 
---
Is the person you‚Äôre chasing in a strong setup where you won‚Äôt even get a single pallet down in 20 seconds? Leave
---
Are there unfinished gens in the area they‚Äôre running towards? Leave
---
Have you chased the same survivor and gotten a few pallets out of them? Change targets to someone who isn‚Äôt aware if what‚Äôs still left for them to utilize
---
And SO MUCH MORE
---
If you‚Äôre into streams I highly suggest checking out Fungoose. He‚Äôs **very** informative
---
It's gonna suck to wait 10 mins to requeue if say, an uncontrollable disconnect were to happen. Intentional dcs are what should be punished but I understand there's no way to mechanically tell the differences between the two in a system.
---
You are not strong enough for my loot. My loot is too strong for you.
---
This man also gets it AND his username checks out!
---
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, What a mad wittle mod
---
There a post on front page about it. Sort by new.
---
Same with noed. It‚Äôs satisfying to see them teabagging at the gate and you down them and sacrifice or kill them.
---
At least two other people besides myself would disagree with you.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured since he lacks personality lol
---
Autodidactic does suck and I love playing Adam, SpineChill or Leader/Bond might make more sense for healing.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ, don't even act like I'm all wrong in this one mate...
---
Well damn, that's exactly the one thing I won't do - gens. I guess this wasn't meant to be.
---
*clauddete passes the corner of the basement*
---
This, is a test. Wouldn‚Äôt you agree, Bubba sawyer?
---
Endgame
---
i really think they just need to give a significant exit gate boost and a small perma haste status like NOED gives. Then left behind becomes effective again.  
---
if devs wanted to go wild they could also show you the killers aura for 2/3/4 seconds once you are the last one but that seems unlikely.
---
I most certinly will. Though I should say; this is only Part 1, the points you mentioned and much more (If I find enough time) will be present in the following parts. (Is Part 2-Bleeding Boogaloo a good name?)
---
Do you also complain about tbagging
---
I think it should be kept closer to its original design. ‚ÄúWhen you are the last survivor you get a 5% speed boost to opening the exit gate for each unpowered generator.‚Äù This way it makes it a niche alternative for wake up, as it gives a 35% boost to speed for the games no gens are done and a 10% boost to speed in games you finish all the gens.
---
WAIT FOR THE PTB TO BE REALISED. THEN YOU CAN RAVE ABOUT HOW BAD FREDDY IS. Until then, let the devs do their job and be patient.
---
Electric Hookaloo imo
---
One guy sent me hate mail afterwards saying ue was disappointed that someone my level camps a hook. All game long the guy who sent hate mail was being toxic. T bagging me every time he saw me, constant looping and just being annoying.
---
The main complaint is with noed because it truly no longer has a survivor counterpart. It used to be decisive strike, in the sense that both rewarded losing and gave both parties a good chance of getting a win from what should be a loss. Ever since the d strike nerf, there is no longer a survivor perk that is as much of a crutch as noed. The devs say that they think adrenaline is the equivalent, but the key difference is adrenaline rewards winning, while noed rewards losing. None of the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù survivor perks are as strong as noed.
---
I don't need to act that way, reality is quite convincing enough in that regard.
---
That will be Part 3! I really like it.
---
That is how it works. Each attempt is 4% success rate, meaning 96% base fail rate. To completely fail at unhooking yourself you need to fail three times in a row. The probability for that is 96% x 96% x 96% = 88.5%. There's a 88.5% chance that you fail all three hooks, which means there's a 11.5% chance of you successfully unhooking yourself in those three attempts.
---
Sorry for the dummy question; does this proc with chainsaw? Does sloppy butcher?
---
4x urban evasion was lit 400x movement speed while crouched (sprinting speed) while being tiny and leaving no scratch marks
---
Unless you kick and scream about how unfair it is that after intentionally trying to piss off the killer the killer gets pissed off and focuses you I think most people don't care.
---
It's absolutely a fair tactic and a horror movie trope.
---
No canonically he probably can‚Äôt see at all
---
We found a match for sound 3. Now to see if we can find a match for sounds 1,2,4,5.
---
Did you eat the orange teachable perk on the bloodweb?
---
It took me 3 minutes but, Heh
---
I'm a Michael Myers main, feels bad man
---
people with sub 30 fps have basically no chance to hit great skillchecks consistently tho
---
I‚Äôm a month new too. But I cba to learn every single thing in the game, especially regarding survivors so that‚Äôs why I only play killer. So I don‚Äôt get bitching survivor who complains because they wanted me to loop the killer, or I should take more advantage of a certain offering. I cba. Survivors will always complain, whether at the killer or their teammates, it‚Äôs very toxic. I‚Äôd advise either keep playing and improving, mute messages, maybe play killer if u want, or just laugh off the messages. U play how u want to, your teammates aren‚Äôt entitled to make u play a certain way. I once got messages from a stupid survivor because I didn‚Äôt take enough advantage of gateaus (limited high BP offerings) and Because I killed all the survivors too quickly, like that‚Äôs not the point of a killer, I didn‚Äôt play well. You‚Äôll play with and against some apparently entitled idiots at time. U play how u want to, until unless ur being a massive asshole have fun.
---
Again though missing a gen skill check doesn‚Äôt largely affect gen progress or anything and most times you run towards your teammates to work on the same gen as them anyways so there‚Äôs not even a lose. It seems like 99% of the time Freddy will take more time pulling people into the dream world than it will take for them to just snap out of it, also Freddy still has to kill people eventually he can‚Äôt just pull people into the dream world and he has 0 tools to kill people so he has to essentially target and focus down one survivor for 2-3 minutes just to get a single hook
---
Brat.
---
Yeah but only one appeared. I haven‚Äôt seen any since before I prestiged.
---
I said I was thankful, I‚Äôm still glad I can finally play all the killers now ;w;
---
Lol thank you xD didnt think anyone would even care about the names. Had to censor names so I removed the letter and let the boxes be.
---
Isn't the center gen on Lery's louder?
---
Personally i prefer the nice Honk Honk over the random assortment of Noises from the Lery's one.
---
bruh you can create pallet dead zones and you are doing something wrong if you chase the same survivor for 2-3 minutes... and this applies to all killers not only fedora man
---
That‚Äôs just unlucky I guess.
---
That may be true but the gas cloud will slow them down on the other side. I have had so many games where one survivor is trying to get away and drops nearly every pallet on the map but can't quite lose me because of the gas. It's easy pickings from then on - I think this is where the clown really excels. I fucking love the clown ü§°
---
Good content, helpful for new killers and creates a good discussion, IN MY REDDIT???
---
I don‚Äôt have silver or gold to give, but I send you irl  appreciation :D
---
You should be happy red ranks suck ass
---
Sad day
---
Thank you kind stranger, I really appreciate your appriciation!
---
I can assure you, the way you are acting is not reality. What you are acting is stuck up, entitled and quite frankly, toxic. How the fuck can you sit at your computer, and think you know everything. Hell, if Freddy DOES turn out garbage, I'll eat my words. LITERALLY. I'll write it on a piece of paper, and literally eat my words. But until then, I don't think you, or me or anyone who streams on Twitch has any real word of how Freddy will turn out UNTIL WE GET OUR HANDS ON IT. Please... Lets just wait. No more arguing. No more bullshit. If we want Freddy to be any better, we will play the PTB, test it all out and see if he is any good. But like I said. Until that day. We can't say for certain how he will turn out.
---
Pig didn‚Äôt hit you she just dabbed on you. Dabbing has unlimited range so you collapsed from shame
---
To be fair Ash and Laurie aren't dead either, in fact if we go with the current Halloween canon Laurie must escape the entity at some point in order for her inclusion to make sense.
---
I, AM THE GLORIOUS #18!
---
And then they lose it in the middle of the corn field.
---
Once had a claudette jump into a locker while I revved my saw, and just stood there holding m2 because I was unaware of the fact that it could be cancelled.
---
~~Console mains, let's unite!~~
---
Perhaps a baby doll killer..?
---
&gt; I think he'll be dogshit on the PTB and everyone will complain. Then they might buff him by a big amount and he then might be mid-tier.
---
Wasn't that what happened with Spirit (Although she went from decent but a bit underwhelming to one of the strongest killers in the game), Clown, and Ghostface? (Especially Ghostface, although IIRC he was also bugged in the first PTB.)
---
And for those early ones where you have to buy everything give me a "buy all" button.
---
Having prestiges a lot and leveled new character recently i felt like i need this.
---
More people writing actually helpful posts on reddit. I... I don‚Äôt understand... this warm and fuzzy feeling of learning and enjoyment of playing a video game.
---
Nice write up man, now i need learn to aim the damn thing...
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but I would throw away both builds. The second one is ok, but really bond is the only perk I would use. Prove thyself isn‚Äôt worth a perk slot because you get the same gen speed as if the survivors were on separate gens. Vigil is horrible unless you‚Äôre going for a ‚Äòrecharge exhaustion at pallets/windows‚Äô build, which is difficult to get right. Kindred is good at low ranks, but when you climb a bit higher, survivors start to know what they should be doing without you being on hook. Also ideally you‚Äôre trying to survive so having the perk is like setting yourself up for failure. I would use Bond, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, and an exhaustion perk of your choice.
---
The Demodogs are definitely more alien like, with the Mindflayer being like a sentient queen xeno
---
The hag in the background with the survivors though.
---
I never said I'm certain. Though I did act that way. It's the best way to get information across. All I've ever did, however, was arguing using the information available. We will see.
---
Hag? No no, that's the new survivor, Lisa Shirwood
---
15% movement speed decrease and survivors can see the traps.
---
Bear traps mean a free grab and are much harder to see.
---
I doubt that a trap that only works on sleeping survivors , slows them for only 15% and is obvious to see will help much.
---
You made me spray from my mouth.
---
Possibly.  
---
But even though the spirit is strong I wouldn't call her OP. She's exactly where every killer should be.  
---
Having the potential to fight off 4 skilled survivors, where most of the other killers just get looped and have to rely on the survivors making a mistake first.
---
Ghostface was good but then got nerfed (or how some would say: 'fixed') making him not really viable at higher ranks.  
---
Clown I don't remember to be honest.
---
I didn‚Äôt know genuine feddy mains existed
---
Dead Hard in place of Breakdown
---
Anything over Autodidact
---
I mean he‚Äôs still mediocre. A 2 year rework and he ends up barley meh tier.
---
when your survivor/killer does what?
---
It might be better ways to play depending your playstyle, but also the killer and perks you are using.
---
But this is a cool guide for beginners imo
---
I don't know whether I should scream or laugh. I feel so conflicted right now.
---
I found 5 dull totems last game all around the map.... FIVE.
---
When I run Ruin it spawns right next to the first generator they do.

She was dead on hook, so no.

Scraugh.

I once did something similar to a Jake, but I ended up releasing it while pressing up against the locker and it managed to hit him in the locker so he was knocked into dying state and teleported to the top of the locker
---
But theirs only 5 totems a match
---
Only with weak killers though. With broken killers they nerf them into the ground and don‚Äôt bother to make add-ons that work with them. And there‚Äôs no hope of them ever fixing those add-ons AKA legion.
---
Thanks pal, I tried to make this as general as possible while touching on important decisions. Killer you are playing as, perks and add ons you are using, items the survivors are using and much more can affect your decisions like you said.
---
Sure but you can‚Äôt 1 hit survivors in dead pallet zones with all killers which is my whole point and as Freddy you have to chase survivors for 2-3 minutes if there‚Äôs a few windows and pallets in an area as they can loop you on a few windows/ pallets for 1 minute easy and then get hit and move to the next area while you‚Äôre slowed and they have a speed boost and do the same thing.
---
Then I must've found at least 4 lmao.. I cleanse totems for points and to remove possible NOED.
---
DS is really really annoying to go against so probably because of that lol
---
S ame

It'll never happen but a classic Freddy cosmetic would make me the happiest boy on Elm Street

It's an extra speed buff. That's all I can think of

The problem is killer DCing doesn't hurt anyone. One DCing survivor screws up his team.
---
Looters quiver before him!
---
Idk why you're comparing it to trappers traps..
---
You can doubt it, but that's clearly the intended purpose of Freddy's traps. And just because it's obvious doesn't mean it can't be useful. Planting them at loops will force a survivor to either run through it and be slowed or go around it letting you gain on them. And yes it only works on sleeping survivors, but Freddy hitting a survivor makes them fully fall asleep, and even when they're looping before being hit they'll fall asleep inside of 60 seconds.
---
I do this too, but it often causes them to DC which just ruins it for everyone
---
searching for a match when playing killer is the core of the game
---
That gray haired guy all the way in the front, right?
---
Yeah... that‚Äôs deplorable
---
You‚Äôre are
---
Are you sure you didn‚Äôt buy them without realizing? Or haven‚Äôt somehow gotten them from the shrine? They always pop up at 30, 35, 40. If you‚Äôre on pc, you can press f1 with Laurie selected to see if you have them unlocked.
---
I guess Ruin, POP goes the weasel, sloppy butcher, and coulorophobia just don‚Äôt exist üôÑ
---
Vacuum sounds perfectly describe it. I always called them scratching noises but it was never quite right
---
Tier 3 doesn't give you a speed buff. The only benefits over tier two other than instadowning m1 are a slightly longer lunge and bonus vaulting speed
---
Thanks my butt cheeks kept alerting the killer before I saw this clip
---
You‚Äôre aren‚Äôt (epic backflip)
---
Srsly there are people who think he's gonna be OP? He sounds like at most mid tier m1 killer...
---
That‚Äôs your number one wish? 
---
But my answer is Nope
---
100% haven‚Äôt bought them from the shrine and I definitely haven‚Äôt gotten them from the bloodweb
---
The problem is I usually overdo the mind games and end up mind gaming myself. And then I just stand there like an idiot and the killer knows I screwed up too.
---
Detective Tapp's perk is actually useful if you miss the Hex skill checks from ruin
---
Man I really wish the people that complain about NOED played a year and a half ago. NOED wasn‚Äôt a hex. Shit was just active till the end of the game.
---
Why would someone purposefully make the worst play just to make the other side feel better?
---
&gt;touches hex totem
---
&gt;Spirit with thrill : *distance vacuum sounds*
---
Leam
---
There‚Äôs some high level Huntresses that use Monitor on her. Even though it doesn‚Äôt change her lullaby, a lot of survivors won‚Äôt get off gens until they actually hear the terror radius. If they‚Äôre immersed at and run to the corner of the map every time they hear the lullaby then the perk won‚Äôt do anything, but against some ballsy survivors it‚Äôs a pretty good perk on her.
---
You made a typo. 12 years. Not trying to be a dick don‚Äôt know if you noticed so I‚Äôm pointing it out.
---
Yeah I agree with you. I'm gonna to assume that the DC penalty applies to killers as well.
---
I really hate that. It's the dumbest unintended work around to the killer making the risky choice to slug. Hopefully the husk mentioned in the dev update will reduce this.
---
It is the purpose but it is almost like the waterlogged shoe of the hag.
---
That is not used a lot since slowing the survivors a bit is not as useful.
---
We can also compare it to the clown but since both slow the survivor.
---
The big difference being that clown can throw it where survivors will be and Freddy can not.
---
I do not see why you would use the new Freddy over other killers with the current power.
---
Not on the bbq?
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this is irony or not
---
#YOU‚ÄôRE
---
Ah damn I have a Samsung J7, so I don't think I'll be able to either :/ although if my progress doesn't carry over I'm probably not gonna bother because I've progressed a ton and bought a handful of things over the years. Thanks for sharing that info thou, helps a bit :)
---
Illumination is the only one I could see working in a balanced manner.
---
Right. 5k points is a refund on almost any offering and survivors don't lose a pip. It just waste time.
---
Aurally I was playing a game and I was looking in a random spot through a window while doing a gen. It happens that Gosthface decides to make that window his and when I start to break him out of the stalking I get scared by the sound bc I didn't notice him so my teammate gets exposed before I'm able to break Gosthface out
---
FUCKING GENIUS, stealing this idea
---
Idk, I guess that's on you and if you never come to like the Freddy rework it's unfortunate that it's impossible to make everyone happy.
---
Personally I'm looking forward to playing around with the new Freddy and find the current version to be a drag to play
---
Get rid of technician, and I‚Äôve personally never been a fan of calm spirit since it only works well against a few killers (most of which you don‚Äôt see a lot of in red ranks). Vigil is also pretty low tier.
---
Did I do something dumb. If so I‚Äôm too dumb to realize
---
Amazing job
---
Yeah that shit's crazy. I've heard since then he can't be stunned in rage mode, at all. Or maybe only by machete. So you can't bully Jason anymore. But that shit was toxic. I'm glad I only have to endure pallets for stuns. You can just eat some, but in F13 when I saw three campers running at me with wrenches, I wished I could just die right there.
---
The 12 years wasn‚Äôt a typo. It was intentional
---
True, but the perk is definitely not just to stop "tunneling off a hook". I don't ever purposely tunnel but sometimes I'll hook someone and go hook another person, during that time the other person gets rescued and I find them again and a minute hasn't gone by so I eat a D'S. Not a big deal but it can punish killers who are just doing really well even if they aren't tunneling. Its not exclusive to tunneling is what im getting at. But you are right slugging is a good counter too
---
Alright then sorry
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more of a white fac- hair.
---
Its good
---
I doubt it. In the past year I don‚Äôt think the developers have ‚Äúfixed‚Äù anything. And if they have, they‚Äôve also created more issues in the process.
---
Also I do agree with the message of the post.
---
Cool
---
Its the same with jojo, you can literally use every scene and make a meme out of it
---

---
Thank me later.
---
Your‚Äôe welcome (dabs)
---
It makes no sense, you have to wiggle to 100% to wiggle out, why would anybody change it to 99%? Then you can say "can we do it so you wiggle out at 98%?". I don't get it, rly
---
feelsbad... to anyone that doesnt know to do this... 99 ur tier 3, then complete it when ur right on their back.
---
Yes it is. And they said offerings will be refunded and survivors won;t loose pips. So it's just a waste of time indeed.
---
Come play with me üòÅ
---
That's True, I never say never but who knows? Either way I hope it's something a little juicier than Stranger Things, like Ash Williams was a perfect addition and imo Stranger Things would feel a little more forced, just my opinion thou
---
A toxic and sweaty gamer gets banned for unsportsmanlike conduct then post here saying he's always a nice guy . . . 
---
Yeah, that checks out.
---
If we get demagorgon I‚Äôll cream my jeans.
---
There was a point where I've been frusterated and annoyed with DBD, but I've lately been less active and taking breaks. After one match i get banned for the first time ever, and for an entire week. This is ridiculous, and i was given no real reason. 
---
Saddens me getting punished after fully returning to a game I've put so much time, effort and money into. This is very disheartening :(
---
I believe this tbh
---
Replace bond with self care and you have the classic Immersed Claudette build
---
Is it only me that when I complete this gen I also go ‚ÄûDOOOOOOOOOO‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm rank 1 &amp; stopped using self care  a long time ago
---
Any backstory? What exactly happened in the match that would cause this? What did you do? Because I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll ban without reason.
---
Your name is toxic sweaty gamer, you don't sound believable at all :P
---
The big sad :(
---
I always make sure to do that gen 
---
I have to hear the blessed honk honk^^Hoooonk
---
? You know it means %10 off if you buy the full set instead of buying pieces right? I'm kinda confused on the title so I'm commenting as best I can.
---
3 Kind of sounds like something from The Thing soundtrack to me
---
It's just a couple extra tabs of the latest DLC's that when clicked, go to the store. I wouldn't say it's "pushing it in everyone's face" since it's just a couple small images on the far right of the screen, and only when you hover over them, it tells you what they are. Also the tabs are small on the far left so they aren't interfering with the background. If they actually in-game did infer, them they could be made even small or transparent. This is only a concept.
---
Well yeah, I would hope you aren‚Äôt playing immersed in red ranks.
---
The Mobile version is in beta testing, that‚Äôs why it isn‚Äôt released everywhere. Things like that will happen.
---
Wouldn't 'nobody:  ' actually be 'somebody:  completes the boat gen'?  These 'nobody' memes really only work when the reaction happens regardless, such as a vegan telling you how meat is murder even without prompting.
---
Claudette. She was the first survivor I leveled up because everyone said self care was the best perk in the game so I just stuck with her. She‚Äôs my only P3 survivor and she has all survivor teachables that I‚Äôve unlocked at tier 3.
---
Tbh I can't even find a survivor lobby because for some reason game decides to send me to 200 ping killers and I have to search for ages for a lobby with good ping
---
Currently, is there anyway to link your pc, xbox, or ps4 account to mobile or will we have to re-grind?
---
There‚Äôs kinda a reason why there isn‚Äôt a FoV slider.
---
Ming gaming yourself is too relatable üò≠
---
Also the blood traps prevent fast vaults for a short time as well, this is a small but significant effect to help shut down looping if used effectively.
---
What‚Äôs immersed mean?
---
This flowchart isn‚Äôt complete, it entirely ignores survivor perks &amp; items.

I play both sides. Easy as hell where I live. Survivors aren‚Äôt scary and neither are killers. I thought killers took a tiny bit more skill then survivors but I think they take a lot more after my trip. Went to a new house, not my set up, different mouse speed different keyboard, meaner survivors. The community of survivors made me realize how frustrating playing killer is. Not denying the skill required for survivors side. But I‚Äôve always played relaxed on both sides until playing on a new setup.
---
Just play the game. If you're not good enough you will derank naturally getting some BP in the process
---
Jeff and Ace mains are so nice (I'm totally not being boas because I'm a Ace main and  or anything) good to see nice players though that are caring
---
Better address tunneling or half of your playerbase will either be banned or choose to not play the game.
---
Did the same. Played legion, slaughtered their team. Last survivor slipped up so I carried them to the gate and let them go to escape.
---
That's on you I think because I can join a game and have to wait 1-2 minutes.
---
Left behind should be changed entirely. In L4D Bill sacrifices himself to complete the generator so the other 3 can escape, which is what left behind is clearly a reference too. Yet in-game it gives benefits to Bill after the other 3 have been sacrificed instead. The perk works backwards of what it's in reference to. It'd be more fitting if the perk gave some sort of benefit to the other survivors once bill is sacrificed or something.
---
Because those were the color shirts/dresses in the movie IIRC. 
---
The bigger issue was how the yellow rarity dress addon (Green Dress) "Consideribly" decreased skill check chances while asleep (At the cost of an extra half second for the dream transition) while the green rarity dress addon (Blue Dress) only moderately decreased skill check chance.
---
I think the idea was the rarer one didn't have a penalty at the cost of being less effective, but an extra half second is completely meaningless. 
---
Given if you're using those addons to try and keep people asleep, you're going to be playing a "Hit N' Run" or "Sleep Tag" playstyle where you're going to try and keep as many survivors asleep as possible allowing you to stall for time (I.E. switching targets as much as possible, breaking chase to re-sleep people who wake up, etc.) which made the "Drawback" of an extra half second completely pointless.
---
Of course it is not! This is only Part 1
---
Be grateful for what you can buy with shards. They have to make money somehow. It's not being greedy.
---
The demogorgon as a killer and Steve as the survivor with the starcourt mall being the map PLEASE DEVS
---
The horn is louder I think. In lerys the sound is the scraping of the panels above so it sounds loud only if you're in the room
---
This is a Test... wouldn't you agree John Pierre Bubba?
---
It's literally just a myers with a chainsaw. He has billy's power instead of evil within.
---
If I become irritated with my previous games I either switch roles or I switch the games. There's no point in switching my playstyle, because it would be detrimental for me in the first place
---
So an objectively better devour hope
---
Probably didn't want to risk missing it
---
That's why I added that I hope it gets fixed by the final release, and I'm sure that they will fix it soon
---
Think of the people that hide the second they hear a heartbeat (regardless of killer chasing another survivor or not) and refuse to run anywhere out of fear of the killer seeing their scratch marks.
---
or you walk by it and the killer tunnels you for the entire round, then camps you
---
I got a 4k on haddenfield with 5 gens, after 24 hours without playing, said gg and hit **upgrade** got banned.
---
Some context: This Legion player was fairly inexperienced and struggled to get a kill, which he tunneled to get. I'm okay with tunneling/camping. Killers don't have to obey made-up rules and can play whatever way they find the most enjoyable, even if it's detrimental to the killer (Like farming). Doesn't mean I like or enjoy those things, but to each their own. The Feng who ran them around for most of the game got a toxic in post game chat since they died, and the killer started using slurs, which I would (optimistically) chalk up to them being a younger player. I also happen to be play both sides in this game, though I lean towards killer. So I decided to leave that comment for them.
---
Your art posts are so underrated, well done!
---
The devs promised that 80% of things would be buyable with shards, is what they‚Äôre referring to

They said that 80% of cosmetics can be bought with shards

Lool thats true ?? i cannot imagine haha

They're talking about NOED's speed buff I think.
---
Lol it's ironic. Sarcasm i guess, i don't know what i could have done..i dont even use add ons or offerings lol
---
Also gender neutral. Yay.
---
Hiding in a corner, not doing gens or looping the killer is far from playing smart.

even though it remains the same it‚Äôll never change the mental ‚ÄúGODDAMNIT‚Äù i let out whenever i find out we‚Äôre playing there

type of bug - ingame
---
description - When a fellow survivor is downed and hooked, I cant see their aura (on the ground or on a hook) to indicate where they are on the map. The aura reading perk Dark Sense is also not working to locate the killer after a generator is complete.
---
Finally got BBQ today. So happy
---
Its an ironic name. I dont trash talk, teabag, bm, exploit or even use add-ons lol.

I played one game vs a 4 man on Haddonfield and eon, then got banned

I know, what a travesty.

Sounds about right

Almost r/bonehurtingjuice

This is a community we need, but dont deserve

You basically got 60 dollars for free and you are still crying? Sorry but you sound like a spoiled brat

Yea I realized that after the fact and technically they are correct if you include reskins

#YES

Why I hate playing with Neas, they almost always throw you under the bus, or leave you to die. - a Nea main
---
I prefer the classic gen rushing Jane.
---
Old DS was obnoxious due to how worked
---
Reworked DS is totally fine, if you get hit by it now you probably deserve it
---
Holy shit. Things just got spicy. 
---
The Demogorgon will look so awesome if it‚Äôs in. The mori better be it eating the survivor.
---
Me when I use black splinter for the first time
---
Yeah i just play whatever to complete daily missions. The match above was sake of trying out the new killer for the fun of it. It's like, the only way i could have actually killed one of them would be to camp the bodies after hooking. At least during that particular match without understanding this killer fully. But i hate doing that, and would have been flamed worse if i had done that. Just a real damned if you do damned if you don't scenario
---
I‚Äôm not crying about it, I‚Äôm thankful that I can at least finally play all the killers. I‚Äôm just a little mad that i couldn‚Äôt buy anything during the sale.
---
Hitboxes being garbage is a valid complaint.
---
Also, hitting through windows shouldn't be a thing imo. Hitting me mid vault or before the vault is perfectly fine, but afterwards? Nah. The killer had their chance to get a hit. Realism, shouldn't be something the devs prioritise... This is a game, if they wanna focus on realism then they'd have to tweak and fix a lot of shit.
---
I just want hitboxes that make sense.
---
True. Idk.
---
That's not bad hitboxes, that's the killer playing at mcdonald's.
---
YEE-OR
---
Stake out is a v. good perk, I personally like having it to check when I think I hear the heartbeat at a distance but I'm not sure.
---
What i can‚Äôt stand about that map is how trippy terror radius is. you‚Äôll end up thinking ‚Äúoh i‚Äôm on the brim of the radius‚Äù and then being spooked when you find out they just jumped down
---
Louder than the exit gates
---
When I look for a match as a killer I find one in 1-2 min lel
---
My best guess would be sitting on a gen spot but not doing it so the other survivors can‚Äôt do it, but idk.
---
Oh if that‚Äôs what immersed means I‚Äôm definitely not that
---
If it‚Äôs that I def didn‚Äôt do that lmao
---
It's worth a shot:

If you need help let me know

Ok this made me laugh way more than it should have.
---
What is tbagged lol.. ü§î
---
They probably did that on purpose and that is completly reasonable, you got 60 dollars worth of in game money and you are still mad.
---
Maybe you were doing a gen while there were more important things to do? Like there were 2 survivors down and 1 on the hook, killer picked one up, but you were not trying to unhook and sat on a gen?
---
Saying you‚Äôre thankful is a little different from actually being thankful. Unfortunate you had to wait, but you must realize it was free; nothing in life is free.
---
TL DR SWF is important and not necessarily op because friends tend to sacrifice themselves for others. Moris are OP, Nurse and Spirit are the only consistently strong killers for 4ks. Survivors running multiple crutch perks should notify the killer (I kinda like the idea of at least hinting at what you're up against). Don't let troll Killers or Survivors bother you because their mom beats them anyways while they lotion her feet.
---
^yor
---
I remember the first time I played that map.
---
Jesus fucking. Christ.
---
That was about initial release, not the long term figures
---
Well I only used ruin because I didn't think any other perks I had would help. Make bitter murmur since I'm new at playing him and unrelenting for the cool down on missed attacks but why run that if I wanna learn the chainsaw and get chainsaw hits. Can you suggest what perks to run on billy. I though bbq, enduring and spirit fury was good and to not respect pallets. Are thos a good choice? Any perk build would be helpful. Thank you for your help.
---
I‚Äôm a child man, I have no money to pay for DLC on my own and my parents would never buy me it lmao, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a little mad. I‚Äôm over it now anyways, it was just a feeling in the moment.
---
&gt; promised 
---
They didn't
---
If the pallet is mid drop then it should prioritise the stun. I have 100% started the drop pallet animation before they start the attack animation and still got downed or hit... Usually because the killer taps attack instead of lunging. 
---
I've also played as killer and sometimes when I down people I just think "Well that was bullshit, but still... Got a down". 
---
I get what you are saying, and dedicated servers should solve some issues, but the devs know hitboxes are shit. Yet all they do is tweak animations, and these animation changes haven't made any of these scenarios look any less bullshit.
---
Im rank 6 and my teammates were rank 12 and up. It was a nonstop body blocking hookfest.
---
I understand, I was just angry for nothing tbh. At least I can play all the killers now c:
---
Yes but playing ONLY one killer would be boring af
---
It‚Äôs to fool you that he doesn‚Äôt have NOED
---
Yeah. I spirit I may try. Huntress I dont think I would be very good at. I've just started billy so I'm not going to be good for awhile without practice. I was just hoping there were some billy mains that could help someone out who wants to play both sides and I like billy. A good billy is the only killer that makes me sweat.
---
Face camping: face camping 
---
Camping: staying within 25 meters consistently 
---
Unique camping: 
---
Staying invisible near the hook to uncloak when survivors come near (wraith is completely invisible when holding still)
---
Holding a full blink in order to blink to the hooked survivor before unhooked or after unhooked 
---
Holding a hatchet at the hooked survivor from a distance (usually at an angle that will hit the unhooked survivor, but can be countered by a healthy un-hooker standing where the hatchet is aimed)
---
Standing behind a wall with scratched mirror Myers 
---
Watching from a distance and waiting to go back immediately with spirits power. 
---
All of these are camping of the killer intends to hit the hooked survivor. It‚Äôs okay if they go after the unhooker. That‚Äôs strategy, albeit one that probably doesn‚Äôt pay off too well. 
---
Not camping: camping the survivor because the gates are open. The killer doesn‚Äôt have many options
---
They could have atleast made the "Green Dress" green rarity for matching colors.
---
I hook everyone twice before killing anyone. Makes the game more fun and more points for everyone.
---
The bitch scared me
---
What is going on with the colors?
---
Yeah. Spirit I may try. Huntress I dont think I would be very good at. I've just started billy so I'm not going to be good for awhile without practice. I was just hoping there were some billy mains that could help someone out who wants to play both sides and I like billy. A good billy is the only killer that makes me sweat.

4 of the character outfits here come from licensed  characters.
---
Of the remaining 5, only 2 require auric cells.
---
I'm not saying you definitely don't have a point, but this screenshot doesn't really act as great proof.
---
I actually quite like the ‚ÄúGet This Done‚Äù build, though I‚Äôd switch Vigil for Open-Handed. OH with Kindred is really nice for tracking the killer.
---
Why do I get 4.16%? Halp.
---
Doesn't reward killer for doing bad, it punishes the survivors for doing bad. That's like saying dead hard rewards the survivor for doing bad in a chase, it doesn't it punishes the killer for not playing around it.
---
Ikr
---
I knew this would happen. You don't see it from a killer's perspective. Old DS you could counter by dribbling or lunging before the skillcheck AND other survivors using it had to wiggle to use it. Sure it was annoying to play against but manageable. The new DS I can't do anything to counter it other than wait plus all survivors can use instantly. Inb4 don't tunnel lol, it's not that simple. Sometimes the person who unhooks the survivor infront of me isn't injured and I can't get there quick enough to hit the unhooker or the unhooked is the only one I find after coming back to the hook. Why would I start a new chase while I can down the injured survivor and secure a kill or get one more hook to put more pressure? Sometimes I tunnel because I don't want to. You know how many times after the exit gates are opened survivors bum rush the hook, unhook the survivor and if I catch him he has DS and escapes? I know because it happens way too often and I hate it. It's gotten to a point where if I down a survivor who was recently unhooked I pray to God he doesn't have DS. Also inb4 the timer is only one minute, in game time that minute is huge. A gen takes less than a minute to get done.
---
[This](https://pics.me.me/absolutely-no-one-not-even-ricardo-milos-minecraft-physics-59070820.png) is the most painful i have seen. Enjoy it.
---
Survivor isn't much better.
---
Wait 5 mins to get into a game, killer leaves the lobby, rinse and repeat
---
Stake out is actually really good at countering ruin.
---
The survivor wasted two pallets and on the second pallet, the Billy with Enduring just walked around the shorter side and hit the Ash.
---
Left out the Mori being activated by certain perks.

Client (?) bug  
---
Description:  On 2 separate occasions, I began a match equipped with ultra rare addons/items (once a skeleton key, another time a brand new part) without any protective addons/wards, and did not recieve the achievement "Risk it all"
---
Yo P E B B L E, YEET
---
Legion eh? I see your a man of tastes
---
Since I'm not a console player, I can't tell you how useful unrelenting is because you have more control over your character on PC.  
---
SF + Enduring is one of the best perk combinations overall. Even more so on Billy, as he can use the chainsaw to charge-tech and completely down someone straight after.  
---
BBQ is a great perk for any killer for the tracking and double bloodpoints - it really helps Billy, as he can traverse the map very quickly.  
---
As for what perks I'd recommend on Billy, Whispers, Nurse's, Agitation, Brutal Strength, even Shadowborn or M&amp;A are good perks for him. Billy can use any perk you like using as a fourth perk; any perk that can help you in a chase(Brutal Strength, for example) is useful. So are other tracking perks like Whispers or Nurse's.  
---
I mainly use Whispers and Agitation because I like them, but you can use almost any perk as long as it doesn't hinder your gameplay.
---
Thx man one more question is purple the highest rarity you can get like does for example does descicive strike go any higher than 3
---
At least 21 people would disagree with you
---
You sure she isn't meg Thawne? Professor zoom?
---
What frustrates me is when they all have full meta perks. Adrenaline, Exhaustion Perk, BT vs me trying out a new killer. In fact, I uninstalled the game after playing Ghostface once on the pts. Had a twitch streamer claudette in a swf using a flashlight, Object of Obsession, BT, Adrenaline, Exhaustion Perk. I'm just trying to actually use my power a SINGLE time, and I can't, because the claudette just stares at me from the nearest pallet. Then I ask them why they feel the need to be such an ass and they say I should just be better at killer. Of course, the twitch chat circle jerks with him until the next game.
---
Of course I'm not playing optimally. I have no perks, and I'm not even trying to down people. I'm just trying to actually USE the power, and I have someone following me to hard counter me.
---
I still haven't reinstalled and never plan to.
---
Are you in America?
---
Fair enough. But that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll stand my ground. If somebody had to do something to trigger an event, then you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúNobody:.‚Äù It‚Äôs common sense. At least 21 people lack that.

Eh just work through it. Takes less time than finding the totem anyways. Just remember to hop off the gen wile its sparking since you cant make progress but can still get skillchecks
---
No? You can just leave thousands of comments over and over again
---
My parents don‚Äôt allow me to work lmao
---
I figured, it's either that I hide like shit lmao.

In Lery's: OMG i can't find a fucking rock in this floor.

This is athetigirl! With her trusty sidekick anxious PizzaWhat-boy *points to dwight hiding behind meg*

name in progress
---
I‚Äôve been finding games in under a minute all day
---
What? The Gen is his power not a perk, we never been able to learn power from other killers. ( Except from glitches. EW1 Myers with a chainsaw.)
---
That's a real bruh moment
---
I would be very surprised if you couldn't.
---
Old DS was basically. Chase me all match. Finally catch me then we do it all again. 
---
New DS is situational and requires someone to lose a hook. It's in a better place since it in essence prevents/deters tunneling.
---
Now I only play legion and pig, BUT I'm not toxic like some of the other pig and legion mains, I don't camp, I don't use exploits like the infinite mending, and nothing toxic, and I always gg because of I'm a good sport
---
I almost choked on a piece of cheese when I saw this meme
---
For Pain in the Ass take off Breakdown and add Dead Hard
---
This sounds right.
---
I had a match a while back where the Leatherface facecamped anyone he hooked, so I worked on gens (which nobody else was doing) instead of trying to mount a failed rescue. First guy to die complained I was "afk" the whole match.
---
sandbag your friends for ez genrushing
---
I don‚Äôt even watch stranger things and I would be excited for this
---
Platform: Xbox

Type of Bug: Ingame
---
If a survivor is crouched and then begins to run and if they have sprint burst, it will not activate sprint burst. The survivor can then release the sprint button and press it again to activate the SB. This effectively makes it an inchase activatable Sprint Burst
---
I'd switch vigil for streetwise
---
from that angle it looks dirty
---
the crows on that map always help me find a survivor
---
Interesting concept, I don't have a whole lot to add, but one idea that popped into my head while reading is possibly using the field of view as a balance tool for a drawback, the lore of it could be the wolf's predatory sight is more narrowed, so you lose a degree of your fov when jumping.
---
It bothers me that he can't teleport to already done gens. On the stream they said that not much happens in the area where a generator is completed and i was thinking "do you guys play the game?"
---
Needs more red arrows and circles can‚Äôt figure out where I should be looking
---
The "don't be so greedy" part. Yuk. I mean you prob bought the game on sale. Grabbed some dlc when it was half off and are fast on your way to putting X amount of hundred hours into the game.
---
Yeah I know but when your playing with randoms ruin is an automatic loss usually since everybody looks for the totem
---
How would it be battle royal it‚Äôs two killers against 6 survivors
---
You could maybe include that the Sports Flashlight has a build in Slightly reduces battery consumption
---
So your parents don't allow you to do something productive with your free time what results into you getting payed so they don't have to use their money on stuff you want to buy? 
---
Yeah right, there are strict parents out there but working is not something parents don't want their kids to do.
---
This kinda stuff makes me want to take my profile off of private
---
I‚Äôm only here to say no to the title Ring. 
---
If Samara from the ring ever gets added she deserves that title!
---
This image ear assaulted me lol
---
Ik it sounds stupid I tell them all the time that I want to get a job but they want me to strictly focus on school and sports
---
Ye but it‚Äôs like killers who camp. There just is no need to get rush. It makes the game boring and uninteresting. I honestly don‚Äôt understand how people can find it fun.
---
Franklin‚Äôs does not proc with any secondary weapon hits such as chainsaws and hatchets. It used to when it was first released but then was nerfed to only proc on basic attacks. Sloppy butcher, however, does work on secondary weapon hits.
---
Sometimes, luckily i managed to get alot of teamates who will power through it after i get that initial gene done. Its almost like they dont believe its possible to do genes until you prove it to them
---
Makes sense
---
Are you joking?
---
The only thing not humanoid is the head
---
By door powered I mean the last Gen is done... Doors opening or closing has no effect.  Basically, traps go on, but they only activate when the next Gen pops after it goes on, so if all gens are done already, no more traps will start running. They just become nifty party hats at that point.
---
There was no way for me to escape; I‚Äôd have to go around the Bubba, and he would‚Äôve clearly seen me, and downed me, and facecamped me to death.
---
No I see it as freddy is already too OP, "I play dwight by the way" and everytime  I come up against freddy's nobody survives on my team due to the fact they always have barbecue and chille and other perks that keep you in the sleeping realm. I like the upgrades and think it'll make the character more fun but at the same time I don't think survivors are fully equipped to outrun all these killers upgrades. Downvote if you want, my point still stands.
---
**"I had someone tell me this would kill the game"**
---
This is actually such a stupid thing to say, how does punishing people that disconnect kill the game? They say like disconnecting is an important part of the game or something wtf
---
Run that with haunted grounds and devour hope is absolutely amazing. I almost prefer it over meta builds.
---
That‚Äôs Gambler‚Äôs Fallacy, it‚Äôs a great way to keep people spending because they fall into this idea that enough tries will yield the wanted results. When in actuality, each attempt is just 4%, so you always just have 4%.
---
( the guy above deleted his comment but I‚Äôll still ad it here, this is not a reply to the guy above, just a general disscusion for a guy that deleted his post earlier)
---
Ok I hate to say it, because I main killer and play a little bit survivor ( I‚Äôm pretty bad at it) : why the fuck is it tunneling when I give the injured survivor a chance and go for the uninjured? Of course you can argue that the killer goes after you every time he sees you instead for other survivors around, that is tunneling. But don‚Äôt forget the most important thing: As long as the killer is good, he makes the rules, he decides what to do and doesn‚Äôt have to care what is ‚Äúfair‚Äù for the survivors. I mean he is a KILLER, it‚Äôs his job to kill everyone as efficiently as possible. It actually doesn‚Äôt matter if the survivors have fun, I don‚Äôt like that point myself but that is how it is. Period. I myself try to play as a fair killer as long as 1. I‚Äôm getting gen rushed, no salt here, the survivors are efficient in their objective, BUT now I‚Äôm gonna be efficient as well. 2. teabagging ( I return the favour with ghostface) You want my aggro? You can get it buddy. So no complains about it in the end chat, you asked for it. 3. If there is a extremely good survivor that doesn‚Äôt waste pallets and loops like a god, depending on how many gens are left, I decide wheter to go after them or instead look for easier pray while also defending gens. Also, if I see somebody that just got unhooked and they are in reach of my weapon, I down them and go after the guy that rescued him. That creates pressure. BUT if nobody picked him up while I already hooked two other people, I‚Äôll hook him too when I find him. I will definitely be not the super friendly killer that carries his ass all the way to the exit gates. Another thing: I don‚Äôt understand how survivors or killer can be sweaty, I mean, they are just doing their job. And if people cry at the end when I closed the hatch in front of their nose: I just didn‚Äôt find them worthy. If you did a good job looping me around without going on my nerves ( teabagging ) or you were a good teamplayer, doing gens and helping teammates, alright, you deserve it. But the rule is: whoever gets to the hatch first, decides what to do, so no complains here. Next thing is slugging: It‚Äôs a strat, to either build pressure or to get the 4k, so I don‚Äôt get why people complain. Last thing: If I see you gen tapping, then you lost every right to complain about anything, because you just commited to survive with everything you can use, I admit that it‚Äôs smart to avoid ruin, but if you pull that cheeky move to survive, I will pull every move I have in order to kill: I‚Äôll slug, camp hooks if other survivors are around (not face camp that is stupid, even though I have seen killers getting 4k because the survivors all tried to rescue that guy on the hook instead of doing gens to use the time the killer is bound to that one spot) I‚Äôll pull the 3 gen strat as doctor, no more mr. nice killer. If you survive, then good job! you deserve it, just as I deserve every kill I made in that round, even if I played unfair as hell.  And one last thing: Survivors complaining about their teammates should instead give them tips how to do a better job next time, it helps everyone to be positive.
---
Also most of the leaked sounds weren‚Äôt used with Ghostface soooooooo
---
Jeff's tend to be nice.
---
Oh yeah that's a pretty good idea! I like that alot actually :D
---
Yeah, it would give you less time to bully the killer
---
woah hold up. You could M&amp;A EW1 Myers with a chainsaw?
---
&gt; But when I'm being flashlight spammed (survivor literally got me trapped in a spot and just kept blinding me, couldn't even turn to get away from it, it felt like)
---
Look up
---
Bro Claudette at it again with the cloaking mechanism
---
Yeah, and use survivors perks like bound.
---
You're right. Maybe they'll change it before the patch goes live.
---
Very true
---
Jeff mains- Nice
---
Blackmetal Jeff mains- Wish for a day when everyone can just kick back chill and listen to Blackmetal. Or even create a Blackmetal band. 
---
Obviously Dwight‚Äôs the nervous Drummer. 
---
Jeff is Vocals 
---
Nea is Lead guitarist
---
David King is Bass
---
Feng min is Rhythm.
---
I believe the last time one of these posts came up, someone figured out that in the current store, about 74% of cosmetics can be bought with shards. 
---
That's pretty fair, and on top of that, despite you thinking they are greedy, they make all of their in-house original killers and survivors buyable with shards.
---
Intellectuals can find Waldo in the first one EZ

Here's a link to the dev stream: https://youtu.be/_ypdDN388Xg

That looks cool ngl.
---
Nothing would make me happier than console crossplay for DbD. Sony doesn't like playing with the other kids though :(
---
i bought some dude the pig dlc on xbox one dbd
---
I didnt even think about that. I was so irritated by the time that happened I left. I even had a claudette sneak up on me to blind me near the beginning. All I've taken away from this, is I get why killers can be so toxic sometimes. Hell, I avoid doing all the "toxic" things I see on here, and still get bitched at as killer
---
seems in chracter honestly considering this rendition of him
---
Yes definitely needed
---
If people who think this will kill the game leave, I'm sure we're not losing anybody that would be fun to play with anyway.
---
Hold up where do u live in what country
---
Why are your mobile arrows shaped like that and mine are regular upvotes? I thought it was a PC only thing
---
Can‚Äôt touch this!!!
---
I had this happen to me a bunch of times. I'm not sure if this is the fix but replacing me ethernet chord fixed this problem for me.
---
"Is any of them hurt?"
---
I wish I was..
---
I was in a KYF lobby and was using my spacebar macro key and when I clicked pause trying to turn it off it froze the game and did the same thing. I sent a bug report and I believe it got patched as when GF came out it would freeze then resume the game
---
How did you get it?
---
NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I WANTED SOMETHING SO BAD. 
---
An episode for each killer (killers for Legion) WOULD MAKE MY HEART ‚ù§Ô∏è DIE
---
Yeah i've had this a couple of times today. Restarting my game works for a little bit but it keeps occurring. Worst of all is playing against a doctor and not being able to snap out of it &gt;.&lt;
---
Is that why Freddy is on the low side of the tier list?
---
I have friends who play this game who have potato computers that barely can get 30 FPS on survivor. They tell me theyd love to play killer if it wasn't such a slideshow for them
---
First time I did that gen I was so pissed off ...
---
There are only four colors. There are only four survivors. If the previous survivor chose the correct color then the next survivor will automatically know that the color cannot be theirs. First person has a 25% chance to get it right. Second person 33% chance, third person 50% chance, and  fourth person 100%. This is assuming that the previous survivors get's it right.
---
Since the goal is to have all correct colors once a survivor gets theirs wrong then there's no reason to take into account outcomes that include previously incorrect colors.
---
So there are Seven possible outcomes.
---
Outcome 1: First, second, third, and fourth survivor gets theirs right.
---
Outcome 2: First and second survivor gets theirs right, but not the third.
---
Outcome 3 &amp; 4: First survivor gets theirs right, but the second survivor chose **two** out of the three colors that are incorrect.
---
Outcome 5, 6, &amp; 7: First survivor gets theirs wrong by selecting **three** out of the four colors that are incorrect.  
---
Only one out of these seven possible outcomes is correct. 1/7=14.285%
---
That‚Äôs unplayable right there
---
Legions already op tho ^^/s
---
I love overly altruistic survivors because I *adore* being able to ignore 2/3s of the map at no cost.
---
I also threw more than a few game as survivor being dumb about saves while other people were close by, so its been a learning experience both ways.
---
In my humble opinion, you should spend more time playing and getting footage to find something truly worth uploading and less time reviewing and editing existing footage attempting to find humour where there really isn't any.
---
You'd have to run a sabo toolbox with the last one tho
---
Replacing we'll make it with borrowed time would be better
---
Won't stop people from killing themselves on the first hook
---
Not sure... I thought they were like that on any browser?
---
You aren't using the meme right
---
What rank are you? I get instant survivor games
---
Because Sony has never had L4D on a PS console, so Valve might say no.
---
I've platinumed the game and I STILL haven't successfully blinded a killer.
---
Was just about to comment on how gens werent popping lmfao. And even after distracting the killer for that long you're going to get feck all BP because you werent healing/saving/doing gens while being chased... smh... they need to fix survivor BPs asap...
---
I'm on ps4 and ever since the event started I cannot get a killer match in less than 20mins
---
Next on rework scedule:legion.
---
(Plz behaviour do it)
---
Ghost face is the new guy everyone hates everytime it‚Äôs a new killer the community hates anyone who plays them
---
Killer on PS4 is taking a lot longer than it used to, but survivor is short af right now. Not sure what happened but that's just my case
---
Love playing against legion now. Pallet stun or 360 his swing when he's in frenzy and he's just a regular m1 killer.
---
Yeah so for context
---
We were against a pig that got led on like a five minute chase at the start of the match. So about 3 gens got done right away. After they finally downed someone, they put a RBT on them, and then hooked them. I saw my teammates run towards the hook so I continued working on my gen. Once it got close to finished, I stopped working on it because I didn‚Äôt want to activate the RBT. The other survivor still hadn‚Äôt been unhooked so I ran to them only to find out that it‚Äôs because the Pig had been camping them. So I went back and finished my gen and went to find the next one. At some point all three of us survivors tried to lead the pig away for long enough but it didn‚Äôt work so we just gave up. She then called me out specifically for AFKing gens
---
screenshot from localhost, so its a dev build presumably.
---
Just go on Youtube and look for a tutorial. That's how i got it.
---
This. People use the hit box card when it‚Äôs literally just connectivity issues. On the killer‚Äôs screen it was a clean hit.
---
Run save the best for last or a 1 hit down killer. Sadly the only games I can win at high rank is with hillbilly or occasionally plague.
---
Also seen this on PS4. It makes killer stupidly easy.
---
I like this. though i hope it means intentional disconnects and not when the game disconnects you, which happens rarely to me but it would be annoying to get punished for not doing anything wrong
---
Thank you. I wasn't aware it was out.
---
  Pall, I think I can say something in behalf of the killer mains all around the globe, we feel you. 
---
  This game can sometimes fell unfair as hell, toxic and salty. Somthing as simple as pushing your crouch button repeadately can get to a lot of peoples nerves (Including me) and endgame chat is just 10 times more unnerving.
---
  I am in no position to give anybody REAL advice but I will try my best: just try to remind yourself that behind those disrespectfull moves and words, there is a person that wants to play a nice game and have a good time just like you. Even if they have "diffrent" ways of doing that.
---
  Just try to ignore what bothers you and focus on what gives you enjoyment.
---
(I am having anger managment issues every time I am playing this game but somehow still want to comeback for more. What a game.)
---
For me this was fixed after a restart. Could have been that easy cheat was still active; look under dbd or steam threads in process explorer.
---
The only way for an unsafe hook to even trigger is if the person unhooked goes down right?
---
I'm running Bubba, which is probably why I had so much bs in one game. Chainsaw wasnt hitting anything. I feel bad for Bubba mains sometimes now that I've seen how bad it can get
---
Did u make the outfit too?
---
How did they trap you in a spot? Everytime I play bubba survivors scatter when I rev the chainsaw.
---
True it's not that we haven't got the footage worth uploading. This is my fault I have a full time job and two kids so I'm doing this in my spare time so because I find it funny I think others will. also I need to budget my time a little more and find those gem moments I guess Haha thanks for the feed back :)
---
Pal if you are trying to say there is a typo (I am guessing that "is" should have been an "are") just say it.
---
English is not my primary language so I might make some stupid mistakes here and there.
---
True, I must agree with that because the matchmaking can be extremely wonky sometimes
---
It‚Äôs only in Sweden and Denmark right now idk why
---
I'm new to the game, but from what I know is the reason he is getting these buffs is because he doesnt own any perks of his own that can be considered useful or fun, the sleeping realm ability is pretty much the only thing he can do so the Killer relies on other perks to get him through the day. But from what I met freddy mains have understood that, and been sweaty about their gameplay and perk selection usually going for the revealing perks when they hook somebody, or they use the combo hex ruin and then thrill of the hunt which makes gameplay even more stressful when you can't repair a single gen and are constantly running due to freddy always finding you. This is why I made the suggestion they can add some new stuff for survivors because we are pretty much getting forgotten with all these new killer updates. I like what they're doing with freddy and hope it changes things but for right now, I only wait so see.
---
It‚Äôs in beta also how did you get it?
---
Happens. If you kill everybody you get hate because you didn't play nice. If you don't kill everyone you get GGEZ baby killer. Just don't be part of the problem.

Licensing. They need to renegotiate the licenses since the original licenses were for PC and console, not mobile. They already did this for Pig and Tapp, which is why they're on mobile and we're also getting cosmetics for them. Ash is up there, too. The strange part is that Ghost Face is missing.
---
Yeah he tunneled me down off hook and I ended with 5.9k
---
A bug, it happens when there‚Äôs a 1/4 left.

When you choose a customization it resets the cosmetics to the basic ones and lags a little bit

My only guess is full SWF lobby. The one time I managed to hook someone, all 3 were there. I got trapped on temple, there was a little area where 2 pallets spawned and there was a 3rd way out. I got stuck almost in the middle, couldn't get out from the flashlight. After the 2nd gen got finished while i was stuck i DC'd

Rank 4, PS4
---
It‚Äôs all I play unless I have a daily.

If you can play dbd on pc why would you come back to filthy console, it‚Äôs the worst here

I guess do skill checks and just heal yourself

Everybody has those games man. If you want some payback I'd recommend hillbilly with quick charge add ons or spirit with prayer beads.
---
Same here
---
almost every player heard the sound because of this meme
---
I like to play huntress because she's a nice middle ground.
---
Go with no add-ons and run Sbutcher, huntress Lullaby and overcharge and make it challenging but not impossible.
---
Or irrides heads and army belt with NOED, chilli, ruin and nurses calling and be sweaty.
---
Maybe because not all my friends have dbd on pc?
---
I cant wait to play dress up with a fictional character that tortured people for smoking! I love piggy :)
---
Oh no. You told the truth on reddit. RIP your karma.
---
I'm rank 8 killer just played a game with 3 rank 3s and a rank 16. Lobbies should be balanced on the lower rank not the higher.
---
I didn‚Äôt say there wasn‚Äôt a counter dumb bitch, I was implying that they were killer perks that dictated the flow of the game.
---
Oh that‚Äôs a good point but man console sucks. I wish I could get a pc so bad dude but I‚Äôm broke

Snitch.

I'm going to try out Billy eventually, I just wanted to grind Bubba for BBQ. Normally I play GF or Meyers

You do realise some parents genuinely don‚Äôt want their children to work, right? Just because it didn‚Äôt happen to you, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening.

5"12' vs 6"

No wonder why the person next to me for half the game kept tbagging
---
Glad I could help inform!
---
Claudette. I love her cosmetics. So many good choices there and so many people just want to run around in p3 clothes. Makes me sad
---
Legion. Fight me.
---
It is a nice counter to the Spirit's Infectious Fright perk, and it is a godsend against slugging Nurses with that perk. It will also be nice against the reworked Nightmare when dealing with his snares as they cause the victim to scream. I can't vouch for this, but I think it also works against the Afterpiece Tonic's coughing (can someone confirm this?).  
---
The ability to not disturb crows is very situational, but can be useful.
---
Alright thanks I‚Äôm on iOS I‚Äôll look into it
---
It‚Äôs expected value.  Obviously each chance is a separate instance, but if it‚Äôs 4% that means out of 100 unhook attempts 4 should be successful.  That obviously won‚Äôt always happen, but planning around that isn‚Äôt unreasonable.
---
But how about only 1 ebony per week?
---
LOL. I really loved this. Amazing edit bro
---
Jeff.
---
They literally just added Jesus to the game.
---
Not really.
---
If you're good, you can stop vaults/pallet drops and get a free hit on a survivor.
---
I mean I got the game free on ps plus and I've only bought two killers I don't rly see greed just I don't like there priorities
---
Now all of China knows you're here!
---
THAAAANK YOU, I was Leatherface (NOT CAMPING) and had an asshole d/c on my shoulder. Apparently she stole my chainsaw when she left because it no longer existed. Worse then that my running speed was equal to survivor running speed. &amp; just to make ya say DONE bloodlust was MIA. I was going to dc but I just stood there.... pissed, next round Spirit= no 1 walked away but the greater-tweaking spirit. My baby 68-0

I mean, if *you* are also having fun doing that then hell ya. Personally, however, have had too many experiences of trying to ‚Äúspread the love‚Äù ending with my getting looped to hell and back from that one missing BBQ stack while potato and company eventually get the last three gens done.

Now a days, if I notice the  survivors are pretty much jumping into my arms, theeeeen I‚Äôll hook er‚Äôbody and goof off with Bubba dancing competitions.

With plague is great wdum it kinda forces them to cleanse
---
What's taptap joy.. is there a link?
---
What the hell is this
---
Don't underestimate barley tier dude.
---
I think a casual mode would help ease a lot of the toxicity. The only mode this game has is 'ranked'. I'm sure a lot of the salt you received was from people who deranked. Casual could keep people around the same skill/rank level in matches together, but win or lose wouldn't make you pip up or down, but you'd secure bloodpoints regardless.
---
The add ons were *slightly* increase evil gained when stalking and smaller terror radius on Evil Within 2. Yet, he skipped Evil Within 2 and would only need to stalk someone for a couple seconds to fill it.
---
Pop goes may not have a counter but it super fucking easy to just do a gen after a kill kicks it
---
looks great
---
So it‚Äôs impossible that he was just saving it up right before the tick of tier 3 and used it then? Because a lot of people do that
---
It's supposed to disorient you. I honestly wish there was a perk that allowed me to randomize a survivor's movement controls on hit, with a cooldown. Be glad Third Ssal isn't actual blindness if you're this triggered by hag traps.
---
Great work on this cosplay!
---
I would‚Äôve thought that was the case if he didn‚Äôt do it right from the start. Within 10 seconds of the game starting, he was in Evil Within 3.
---
I‚Äôm having a good laugh out of that one, you are so right üòÇ.
---
I can totally see a Spirit doing that.
---
Same

Probs because Killers see the medkit and wanna run Plague

That's the point. That's like saying that the damage from trappers traps is a cheap trick just to make you vulnerable if you escape.

Fine. So not ruin. But BBQ and NOED are.

Type of bug: audio

When someone enters or leaves the lobby, the appropriate sound does not play. Not a big deal really but it bothers me.

Is it bad that I use stake out unironically?
---
I think that's a super cool concept! What about stridor for louder injured surv noises?
---
I have no clue then, but it‚Äôs just not possible to hack on any game for console. Probably an exploit or something then I guess
---
I think OP is going for more sound-based builds. Discordance is more visually based because you get a visual notification.

Save the Best for Last only effects landed attacks, not misses.

do you only work one hour? lmao

Ye but u can maybe sneak up on the survivors (very rarely but u can) like in the film The Quiet Place

Not sure tho

I think that's why he'd run surveillance but I like your logic.

Probably tbh

God, the entitlement. I would have loved a free 60 dollars. Sounds like you need a reality check.

It is safer to search then save, at least for the person searching the chest. Another scenario might be a survivor is on the hook and there is a totem right next tot he hook, if the survivor isn't near struggle it is probably better to cleanse then rescue, cause if you do it the other way around the killer might get back before you finish cleansing.
---
Head on is trash

We're definitely getting a Stranger Things chapter. Netflix announced a partnership with Behaviour, Fortnite and Roblox. And both Fortnite and Roblox have a event relating to Stranger Things right now.
---
All I really want is his classic robes, hopefully sooner than later.
---
Jesus you sound entitled. "I got my after 60 dollars too late to take advantage of the sale! Wah!"
---
I don't know if you expected sympathy or what, but you wont get that here. Since. You know. None of us won. You need a reality check.
---
*Psst, it's a hyperbole for how overpriced the cosmetic sets are*
---
I'm not saying rank is 100% luck and if I did I misspoke, all I'm saying is that ranking up is very easy and it doesn't take that long for a new player to reach red ranks. OFC there are people who are good at the game and can get to the red ranks, but to say that rank in DBD equals skill is just wrong.
---
~~That‚Äôs kind of the point~~
---
They stated Small Game (Generic survivor perk, not a teachable) will be able to alert you to the traps and fake pallets, similar to how it alerts you of totems, trapper traps, and hag traps.
---
I'm with you on a Hex totem logic but dude we are talking about a chest...noone needs to search them period lol.  They're a luxury that don't really help your team.  Make the play than go shopping at Target after you've made the play.  You could always go down there later when a teamates life isn't in danger.
---
I‚Äôve honestly heard it so many times I thought it was true- that‚Äôs on me for not checking!
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Audio - The Legion 
---
Description: Susie and Julie both use the male (Frank/Joey) Legion voice until they get stunned by a pallet. I first thought that the used mask might be behind it (I use one of Joeys masks on Julies body) but that wasn't the case as even Julies standard outfit has this problem. 
---
(I'm not sure if this has been fixed already. Wasn't able to play today.)
---
That isn't even close to the same thing. Being injured is not the same thing as having your controls taken from you, even if it is just a short time
---
mby it's a bug running those two specific add-ons?
---
Ok, thanks
---
Good cosplay, wrong shoulder.
---
So you are saying my bbq, SF, and enduring steak good? I know ruin isnt very helpful in high ranks, but since I never play killer I'm rank 19-20. I thought ruin was very effective in those ranks. I thought about brutal strength, but i didnt think I low ranks it would help much since the survivors keep running and by the time I'm done breaking the pallet at normal speed I could still see scratch marks since in low ranks survivors dont typically mind game and keep running.
---
I would only be olay with two things. Having WGLF boost unhooking or combining it with We'll Make It. I hate the comparison to BBQ that people love to make. Folks do realize that the killer is the power role, right? WGLF is not equal to BBQ and it never should be.
---
Also I dont have brutal strength on hillbilly since I dont have trappers teachables yet. I thought bitter murmur may help. I dont want to use noed since i have a one shot down killer even though i cant get chainsaw downs without addons
---
Yeah. Not disturbing crows only works against the most keen-eyed Killers with like 4,000 hours. I know Tru3 always watches birds and somehow sees them from across the map.
---
You're better off with Wraith and sloppy butcher. Mend doesn't "slow the game down" as much as people say.
---
i dis think about this but i was kind of hoping for perks that relied on the survivors making noise
---
their leatherface song is also really good
---
I had to use my fap arm side otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to carry her :(
---
this is a great suggestion idk why i didnt think of it thanks!
---
Bluuurrrrrrrrrbbbbbb
---
DOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Ye
---
No. Unhooking in The Killers Terror radius is an unsafe unhook. Because that gives the killer the option to either tunnel or pursue you. Doesn't allow for hook heals.
---
If you unhook someone in The Killers Terror radius you deserve to be hooked for farming your team-mates. Unsafe unhooks, are more of a community title. You lose emblem points for doing it though. As long as your teammate makes it like 10 seconds without being hit it counts as a safe unhook officially.
---
except that its not and can be a real cancer when playing with friends
---
How?
---
killer pretending he wouldnt have morid her if she hadnt been toxic
---
Still, the person on the hook isn't dying any time soon, and as long as the killer isn't heading back I don't see the issue.
---
This. If I catch you just after hooking you, I will not rehook you but I will down you, at least until I down and hook another teammate of yours. If you DC on down that is your own fault, and then generally I turn it into a farming game, but I don't indicate to the survivors until I got all my BBQ stacks/Quest done.
---
As much as I hate the baseline killer FOV, this is not the answer.
---
Not many people think of stridor when thonking about the game meta. It's really easy to overlook.
---
To be fair BBQ is a meta perk. Nothing "Sweaty" about running it. So is Hex Ruin. Thrill is a bit weird because I never bother protecting totems as they get cleansed super fast anyway (And Freddy can't defend for shit given he has to wait 7 seconds by default to hit you)
---
I only see "Sweaty" as something like Iri Head + Infantry Belt Huntress with an Ebony Mori. Or old MoM + Dead Hard + Adrenaline/DS + Deliverance with an InstaHeal. 
---
If Ruin is a big deal (It is for me. I swear when I'm Killer my totem's gone before I can get to it, yet as Survivor it usually lasts the whole game lol) try gen tapping. You click your mouse instead of holding. It takes longer but no skill checks. I am not sure if it is faster compared to just powering through ruin though. You can also use Stake Out (Tapp perk) so you can effectively ignore ruin as long as you have tokens.
---
If BBQ is a big deal you can run Distortion (Jeff perk) which blocks your aura from being read a few times.
---
The only thing is that if they cant dc theyre just going to kill themselves. Its super useful against dcing killers though.
---
That is the cutest way to spell that word I've ever seen.
---
You don't know that the killer won't be heading back.  We've all played killers that routinely revisit even going all the way down there to physically check for altruism countless times.  It's a bad play man.  I just think a player that pulls that has very bad priorities.
---
Meg is high school basketball player if what Im told about her bio is true.
---
The rescuer was probably still going to take the chest, so for them it is safer.
---
Lmao ‚Äúbe grateful‚Äù you cannot be serious
---
Looks good
---
Can someone link me the apk
---
First one, iron will to lightweight will get you really far. Or premonition so you don‚Äôt vault into the enemy
---
Dont combo fast heal and autodidact, it‚Äôs a poor combo cuz it‚Äôs hard to get all charges
---
Who said I was just talking about Killer? And why wouldn't this be an easy solution?
---
I thought of Discordance considering how good it is on old-freddy to kick-start your match and sleep 2+ dudes. 
---
Sadly I read A: You can't teleport to blocked gens so you can't use Thrilling Tremors (But you can still teleport to unblocked ones AKA ones being actively worked on) B: They said it'll probably start the match on cooldown so you can't teleport to the survivors as soon as the round starts so discordance might not be as good.
---
Gotta get that spicy lunge range, bro!
---
This is amazing.
---
I can definitely see your intentions to "hook" her, nice cosplay
---
I'm honestly kind of in disbelief that I have to tell anyone that plays this game that making a save in the basement when you have an opportunity to safely do so should take precedence over looting a brown medkit.  But to each their own.  Let's just agree to disagree because we are destined to go in circles on this one.
---
I didn't know it can be block, I looked around dbd thread and never heard of blocking it before, I'll look into that. And the reason I say those hex's can be sweaty because I shit you not, everytime I have came across killers using those hexs they protect that shit like a mad dog, they stay near the area of the hex and it takes at least few hooked survivors to destroy it but by then almost everyone is near death and there is like 5 to 4 gens remaining.
---
i like your art style, looks real good
---
I was playing ghostface on Haddonfield where I hooked a tea-bagging Nea thrice, never camped once.
---
I might need further explanation for that please.
---
Survivor lol, actually ur right it‚Äôs more of a man that would be amazing. Might as well wish for a decent killer. PINHEAD
---
PS4 - POST UPDATE 3.0.2
---
SURVIVORS:
---
‚Ä¢ Survivors tend to block generator auras.
---
‚Ä¢ The sickness affect on the sides of a Survivors screen tends to bug with the smoke effect when hooked in the first phase of sacrifice.
---
‚Ä¢ The SFX that plays when a selecting a Survivor in the lobby is missing.
---
KILLERS:
---
‚Ä¢ When getting suffering ANY stun while in Feral Frenzy or picking up a Survivor, the Feral Frenzy VFX doesn't go away until Feral Frenzy is activated again.
---
‚Ä¢ Very often Susie *(Potentially Julie too)* will sound like Frank and her clothing makes the leathery sounds Franks base outfit does. This happens very often, sometimes fixing itself mid-trial.
---
‚Ä¢ The Spirts katana tends to disappear from her hand on occasion. This could be caused by spamming the attack interaction or being stunned by a pallet mid swing. Otherwise I am unsure how to recreate this.
---
‚Ä¢ The Wailing Bell disappears sooner than intended during the bell stowing animation. It's very noticeable when spamming the cloak interaction.
---
Thank you! I appreciate it
---
inb4 they said something like "80% of cosmetics will be purchasable with Shards at the launch of the store"
---
(I don't know what they actually said way back then but I wouldn't be surprised if I was close)
---
ass grab
---
The gambler's fallacy is that an increased or decreased occurrence of event will respectively cause a decrease or increase in the frequency to average out the probability. That's not what I'm explaining here this is just probabilities. If you flip a coin three times in a row you have a 12.5% chance of getting three heads and if you attempt to unhook all three times on your first hook you have an overall 11.5% chance of achieving an unhook across all three attempts of 4% each.

Truth is game was rigged from the start.

for people who dont have the killer and want a chance to test them before they buy.as to why they still appear after you get the killer, i have no idea

A very bad week!!!

I dropped in rank twice this week, its brutal
---
not only is he salty, he also has no idea what he's talking about!
---
Good marketing strategy. Other than that, I dont see a point other than an expensive wasted spot on the blood web
---
omae wa mou
---
I have a guilty pleasure of looking for jump scares and recording the reaction.....
---
god i wish that were me
---
You should do fan art for dnd characters or something, this is great!
---
As a Huntress main I approve of this very much
---
Nah. I used to use it a lot. I just don't have it on my Ace yet so I haven't been for a bit
---
i mean it looks cool to have a bunch of ultra rare offerings too
---
I'm not a fan of Bitter Murmur, but I don't see a reason not to use it if you don't have anything else.  
---
NOED is a bad choice in my opinion because it counts on you getting to the end game.  
---
Chainsaw downs are all about practice. I'd imagine back-revs are more difficult on console, so if you think add-ons will help, use Vegetable Oil - it's not *that* strong and still helps.
---
They are apparently calling you out on your bad sportsmanship. Tunneling down one survivor to make it a 3v1 for you is easier, yes. But by doing so you have ruined one persons game entirely. If you proceed to do it then youre ruining the next, etc. On top of this you are preventing the other survivors from getting heal/safe unhook points and penalizing the entire teams points.
---
I know its a "valid strat" but they are criticizing your bad-sportsmanship. If you truly played for "fun" as you claim then it shouldnt matter if you get easy kills or not. I can 4k or 1k and my enjoyment of the game is not reliant on this.
---
Note - I do not believe it is acceptable for people so send harassing messages of any kind.
---
It is a glitch.
---
Either put on the perks Lightborn or Franklin's Demise. When you pick up survivors, look up at the sky, or if you are at a wall, face it.Or you can fake picking up a survivor and go after the survivors with flashlight and give them a smack
---
it's a bug, and it's not just gens. killers can see "shadows" of survivors through literally any aura rn.
---
Then they have to address the fact survivors have too many safety nets, loops, 2nd chance perks, and methods to prevent a kill from doing too much. Higher rank you almost have to focus one player down to have a chance in the game otherwise the survivors have brains and can Gen Rush through a ruin.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Small_Game
---
It's a "Generic" perk. You mentioned your new and play Dwight. You know how Dwight has Leader, (Boosts teammate action speed if you're near them for almost everything but gens) Prove Thyself (Boosts you and your teammates gen speed when working on the same gen, basically to help counteract the slight inefficiency you get if multiple survivors work on the same gen) and Bond? (Shows your teammates auras if they're near you)
---
Small Game can be found on any survivor and doesn't require you to level up a certain character to enable it to be found for other survivors.
---
Small Game basically plays a noise (Although I'm more focused on the icon doing the cooldown animation) when your camera is looking in the direction of a killer's totem (Could be an actual lit hex totem or a dull totem) or trap (Hag traps, trapper traps) within a certain range. When I use it I'm often swinging my camera around trying to find totems.
---
Devs have stated Small Game will play the warning noise when you're looking in the direction of a Freddy Snare (Which might not be that useful because the snare itself is pretty noticeable compared to Trapper's bear traps and Hag's phantasm traps) or a Dream Pallet. One dev on the stream even mentioned being unsure which pallet was the fake (Since it's a 12 meter long detection cone at perk level 3) at a loop, and both turned out to be fake.
---
NANI!?
---
The devs could always pull a Minecraft and have crossplay between PC/Xbox/Switch/Mobile but exclude PlayStation.
---
Sure it‚Äôd cause bad PR for Behaviour... but mostly for Sony. Who knows maybe that‚Äôs what needed for complete crossplay (and cross-saves)?
---
People complaining and PR fiascos are why Sony implemented their current crossplay beta. It‚Äôs why Fortnite and Rocket League got crossplay/cross-saves. It‚Äôs why the new COD will have crossplay. It‚Äôs how Destiny is getting cross-saves.
---
Well that I can agree on. Also no I‚Äôm not a survivor main but it‚Äôs typical for you to actually say that when someone disagrees with you. I play both roles thank you.
---
Hellpriest (pinhead) would absolutely be amazing hes among one of my favorite Slasher. Well if he is a Slasher. I actually don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs a Slasher.
---
Glow = not good sneaks
---
The only problem with a casual mode is that if it give Bloodpoints then why would anyone play ranked? You'd have rank 1 survivors against rank 20 killers and visa-versa which wouldnt be fair...
---
Just wait for dedicated servers
---
I liked Prove Thyself so I mained Dwight to P3...now I dont even use that perk in purple ranks
---
Thank you! It's not as complex as my previous edits, but it was a fun one to make.
---
Man that shit in Lery‚Äôs is annoying as hell
---
I'm too rarted
---
Really bad comparison, once a survivor Dead Hards you know for the rest of the game they have it and can play around it. I have no way of knowing how many totems my team has busted even if I run Small Game.  What survivor perk punishes a killer after he's killed 3 survivors?  Why has every survivor perk equated to NOED gotten the nerf hammer while NOED is untouched?
---
As a Freddy main, this rework makes me sad.  I'm going to miss the best stall in the game, the transition mindgames, the aura reading, all of it, and frankly nu-Freddy looks to be a lot more boring to play as.
---
I'll still give him a go (mostly 'cause I like the Elm Street movies and the new Freddy feels a bit more like Classic ANOES), but he's going from hardcore main, to potential side character if not dropped.
---
Dont work for me. I have to tap a gen or a Totem than its works. Not rly abusable but fix this pls. Its not very good when the killer is here and u cant use SB

Just a Toxic Nea who totally got off
---
They could decrease the amount of bloodpoints that casual gives in comparison to ranked. They could also do rituals that can only be completed in ranked that could give more than the casual ones.
---
Boat gen best gen
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Doesn't each event still have a different probability of occurring though?
---
For example, event one (all survivors pick right) is far less likely to happen than events five, six, and seven (first survivor picks wrong). Event one requires *three* specific outcomes to all occur at once, while the latter three events each only require *one* outcome. As I understand it, each individual outcome has its own probability of occurring within each event.
---
Shouldn't it just be the product of the probability of each outcome (i.e. **1/4** x **1/3** x **1/2** = **1/24**)?
---
^(Also, I might be completely butchering this terminology, lol).
---
My name is Meg Allen and I'm the fastest survivor alive
---
...are you Italian?
---
It's Speculation, not trying to be that guy you just took me by surprise and now I'm curious, I don't see Italian thrown about willy nilly these days lmao
---
Neat
---
Track runner*
---
are.....are you serious?
---
Now that I'm thinking about it couldn't we just roll off the killers shoulder when he picks us up...
---
That will actually come in handy not against freddy but a lot of other killers abilities, holy shit that's gonna be game changer.
---
Could have been salty teammates, honestly I didn't even know they banned people :P
---
Yep
---
Entity strength
---
As a survivor, the only time I do it is when there's 2 people left and the killer is slugging me for the 4k. I'm not gonna enjoy sitting there for 4 minutes doing absolutely nothing, so I just want to move on to the next game and actually have fun playing.
---
Because it's a massive generalization that just isn't true.
---
You're playing the 2 strongest killers on console.  There is abolsutely no need to tunnel man.  I play a lot of killer on console too and receive next to no salt.  That's because I don't camp or tunnel.  I play fun competitive games for both sides.  In my experience killers that receive constant regular salt post game play in a manner that kind of encourages people to get pissed off at you.
---
Today I had a game where I finished the last gen right next to the gate. I just barely opened it in time and was about to escape but the doctor had noed and stopped me right before I got there. It was really frustrating because my teammates hadn‚Äôt been so good and getting to that point had been a challenge.
---
Felt that one. Only this meme is missing three teammates who've done nothing but look for the totem after their first skill check
---
I tried setting my phone to Sweden then clicked the download link someone posted. Didn‚Äôt work
---
Sounds nice! I love when people are nice to each other no matter how the game goes :D
---
I got a compliment from someone I killed recently, that it was a nice, long game since I didn't tunnel or camp
---
Did you get them with cells and not by buying the DLC?
---
You have a great build for Legion!
---
Very nice &lt;3
---
#BWOOOOM
---
I had to guild this, this is comedy fucking gold your cosplay is amazing and so are you lmao
---
I'm not sure about that - a slow/fake pallet (we'll have to see how effective both are) + a global teleport, which you can strategically use to end/start a chase or protect a gen doesn't sound like meh tier to me. Coupled with the fact that he will still have a smaller TR and non-directional lullaby, this could become confusing even against survivors with a brain. We'll have to see what his new addons will do as well.
---
Please don't be a Survivor only release when there's so many cool monsters
---
A lot of killers bring in mori‚Äôs and only use them on toxic players, most know mores take balance and fire it out of a cannon
---
Yeah, not fun for either side. Unfair for survivors, and makes wins as killer feel cheap
---
I think it‚Äôs unfair to call that un-sportsmanship. As you said it is a viable strategy for a killer and can also happen accidentally due to a poor survivors actions where they hide etc. So someone playing a game in the manner they deem not fun makes it ok to verbally abuse someone. 
---
And what about people who solely die but the rest of their team wins? Or when they run amok a killer - is it fair for survivors to say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trash!‚Äù 
---
I don‚Äôt go out to tunnel but sometimes this happens naturally. 
---
Do I moan when a team is 360 me, t-bagging the gate or instant healing - no.
---
Ps4.
---
Game feels extremely choppy after 3.0. Before this patch, was it 2.7 which improved performance and resolution game played very smoothly, now it's back to feeling like you teleporting. Sometimes it feels like you can't even run you fighting your character to make him do to what you want him to do. Skill checks are also lagging. Maybe others can confirm it, or is game feels a lot worse just for me?
---
Tried to reinstall the game, didn't help.
---
I love that
---
I still dont see that as being a solution. As it stands you have players on both sides de-ranking to bully new players. They need a reason to rank up. In a rankless casual mode you would still have skilled vs new players...
---
Awesome
---
Coppin a feel
---
I mean, he might have had pharmacy and Ace in the Hole and then he would have gotten a decent med/kit and maybe some good add-ons. Then it would have been a good play.
---
Yeah basically just rushing gens with no regard to what else is happening in the game, however sometimes working on a gen is the smartest thing to do and people dont always realize that
---
In healing others change autodidact and put self care or solidarity
---
He lost weight.
---
I know it's /s, but you'd be surprised how many Claudettes are out where who don't touch the gen entire game. Not because they are being chased whole game, they just want the hatch.
---
I believe she played multiple sports iirc
---
Lol I was busting balls with the brown medkit.  Dude coulda found a golden flashlight that grants wishes, it was still a selfish bad play.  Again agree to disagree man.  Let's break the Circle.
---
Yep. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
---
Did you even play the game?
---
X-files music starts playing
---
Great editing! This video reminded me of a game I had about a week ago. I was playing hag with devour hope, thrill of the hunt + mint rag and rusty shackles. Got 5 stacks and mori'd everyone. Hag was full that day
---
/laughs in iron maiden/
---
No, I bought their DLC's. Didnt even know I could buy them with cells until after, had a pro potato moment
---
Idk how, but i managed to replicate the sound in my head perfectly
---
yeah...im gonna go ahead and call that either a lie or straight misinformation. ive never once seen a killer with a mori not use it, regardless of how the survivors are acting
---
For Real! I Play on a 6s Plus and Im always at 30fps and I don‚Äôt lag or jitter everywhere
---
&gt;What‚Äôs wrong with me focusing on a survivor to make it 3vs1 and better odds for me?
---
and
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt go out to tunnel but sometimes this happens naturally. 
---
These sentences dont seem to go well together...
---
To be honest I dont see what they said to you as verbally abusive.
---
&gt; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trash‚Äù, ‚ÄúUninstall‚Äù, ‚Äúyou tunnel‚Äù, ‚Äúyou camp‚Äù, ‚Äúyou zone‚Äù, ‚Äúworst player ever‚Äù, ‚Äúnot fun to play against‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet Wrecked‚Äù 
---
The "you're trash" seems to be the worst that they have said (everything else seems to be comments on your playstyle which you have also agreed with). And even the trash comment seems to be a comment on your playstyle which I cannot comment on without having seen it myself...
---
Only behavior can send out who gets the mobile pass as of right now
---
Dont gen rush then
---
For shhh, change technician for quick and quiet
---
Im just saying if we get Steve ‚ÄúThe Hair‚Äù Harrington as a survivor I will never play another survivor again in my life.
---
uh, you either look for it or you dont. if youre like "k brb guys imma find ruin" then spend 20 minutes looking and decide to give up youve just wasted  20 minutes(and also probably lost by that point too) so if youre gonna look for totems commit to it and dont stop til all 5 are gone
---
I do it to Claudettes if where is two of us left, and I'm doing the gen and see her with bond sitting in a corner waiting for me to die, I point the killer to her, don't care if I die, I'm just super happy she's not getting to escape.
---
"The dead hard out the gate avoiding being downed at the last second got you off?"
---
"That was the climax really. It was amazing, mostly sexual"
---
Getting to rank 4 wasn‚Äôt easy for me and I believe you cannot tunnel or camp to get to this level. If I kill all 4 killers how am I camping(?) or does that mean I‚Äôm playing against really stupid survivors who just come to me?! üòÇ
---
Stake Out is actually a really solid perk. I stopped using it a while ago because everyone was playing Ghostface and you don't really get the benefits with him, but it was viable soon after.
---
Nope. Her bio says track only
---
*myers
---
Like, I would trust a console Nurse. Clearly you lose a lot. /s
---
But I only asked because people on here complain about Ruin and NOED as if they can't just devote time to finding totems, so I'm just trying to get a feel for how some players decide how much time to commit to totems.
---
Technician comboes well with the new jane perk to let you not leave scratches after finishing the gen. You could combine it with stake out and sprint burst for a build to finish under the killers nose and get away fast and scratch free. Lightweight is another good option for stealth builds.
---
What‚Äôs your ea id?
---
My number one wish is that they would stop making new content untill they fix what they have. How long it took for the Freddy rework to come out is a testament to this. On top of all the bugs and glitches
---
You kinda said the same what I did :)
---
I think devoting all your time to finding ruin is a bit pointless, look for it while going for gens and just be patient with gens and when more gens are done start prepping for noed
---
Oh man, I live for games like that. Sounds like a lot of fun and craziness. :)
---
"Y'know, I could have escaped the killer, but nooo, you said hang in there, I'll help you get off, I'll help you get off Meg, I'll show you how to do it, and then you leave me all on my own to get off aaaall by myself-"
---
*Meg gets sacrificed*
---
"I DID EVERYTHING I COULD, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU COULDN'T GET OFF, IT'S NOT MY FAULT, SOME SURVIVORS JUST DON'T KNOW HOW!"
---
What are you talking about? A killer that DCs can result in Surviviors depipping and Surviviors depip from leaving
---
It was! Definitely recommend you try out that build if you can :)
---
It's
---
¬´¬†a lot of killers¬†¬ª
---
reality: 2 killers
---
No on mobile everyones name is either unknown or localhost as of now they will probably add in player names in the future
---
With a power that let's it go into and through walls.
---
I kinda feel bad for her.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs available in the America‚Äôs yet but god damn am I excited.
---
It‚Äôs not in the Apple store, so no. How is it? I have a IOS controller and I hope they support controllers on the mobile version.
---
Adam just cus I don‚Äôt see too many of them and his clothes look really obviously bloody
---
Run bond instead of empathy, it's a lot more versatile perk. Bond is enough to find injured survivors. Instead of autodidact bring pharmacy and give survivors medkits.
---
Jeff mains unite!
---
So does the power of those Hex perks come from how they slow down players? I see it said on here that a lot of NOED's power come from just the chance a killer could run it?
---
Or is it more of the RNG of the maps combined with the killer's skill that makes the perks strong?
---
yea something like the nurse except in walls and the lights (maybe a new map or two to play it on) flicker
---
PC:
---
Type of Bug: In game
---
Description: Trapper traps bug out when hitting someone that's trapped and they don't fall out of it. Survivors cannot free themselves, and trapper cannot use the trap once picked up unless the survivor who had been trapped is killed.
---
Screenshot / Video: Forgot to provide.
---
Steps to reproduce: Trap someone. Hit them. Pick them up. Drop them down. Pick up trap. Try and fail to place trap. Without bags, this bug will literally break your power. It might be a unique interaction with Franklin's, though I'd need to test to make sure.
---
Expected result: Survivor gets hit, you get a stack on Save the Best for Last, or they get on hit effects, etc., and they fall out of the trap allowing you to pick them up.
---
Actual result: The survivor gets stuck in the trap, and not even their allies are able to free them.
---
Reproduction rate: Around 50% of the time this happens.
---
Ah ok, either way semantics aren't important here, only that she was a high school student :)
---
and then the mori can be like in the upside down idk
---
i like it when people think nurse is bad on console, makes it a lot more satisfying when they're all crawling around on the ground
---
1. Pretty good, but you can also just run Poised and communicate gen progression. Kinda overkill.
---
2. Autodidact just isn't very good. You're better off running Bond than Empathy, even here.
---
3. Take off Breakdown. Replace it with either Sprint Burst (to zoom off the hook) or Dead Hard (so you can dodge the second hit while unhooking somebody, forcing it to hit the unhooked survivor during I-frames).
---
&gt; Maybe the killer has a survivor body-blocked in a corner with 5 gens left?
---
Report them and move on
---
&gt; Maybe some survivors are fucking around with a brand new player playing nurse?
---
Grow some balls
---
&gt; Or RL calls and they gotta leave?
---
10 times in a row? If you gotta leave, then a short timeout won't hurt you (I'd guess first DC won't get you out of the game for more than 5 minutes)
---
&gt; I think a concede option might have been a better fix
---
It's in the game right now. It's "Leave" button. And it's not the solution for all things you described.
---
&gt; Or maybe reward players for playing a X amount of games without DC'ing?
---
Yeah, let's give people prizes for playing the game as intended.
---
Man and I thought I was generous by letting the last survivor get the hatch
---
Make it so that killers can also mori DC'd survivors' husks (and have it count as a kill), and I'll be fine with this change the devs proposed.
---
I usually check the spots around me real quick then hop on a gen. Then I‚Äôll look for it while on the way to another gen. Usually I‚Äôll find it or a teammate finds it around this time. If it‚Äôs been like 5+ mins and Ruin is still up I‚Äôll usually go look for it unless my team seems to be good enough to hit Ruin skillchecks. I played a game the other day with a bunch of randoms where we never destroyed Ruin but we still got the gens done in like 5-6 mins. At that point might as well just fly through the gens.
---
Posted cringe you have. Going to loose subscriber you are
---
Yeah, it takes for ages for me. I'm more of a survivor myself, but if I want to do a daily ritual I'm spending more time in a loading screen than in the match
---
Noed to me is a hail mary that will get you like a guaranteed kill at least if you have 4 alive but can save matches sometimes, ruin is for slowing down the game but in terms of survivors the counter really is just patience. And if you run it you have the high chance of it getting destroyed and having 3 perks for a match
---
It‚Äôs not actually out yet you have to switch to a scandinavian region such as Sweden or Norway
---
If I'm bringing a Green Mori it's either for a Dying Light obsession, a daily, (In which case sure, I'm going to use it the first chance I get) or because of a specific survivor. (Full Legacy Jake with a toolbox and .TV in his name. Quentin back when Wake up was bugged, etc.)
---
I do kind of wish if you never use it, you keep it. Theoretically you could run a green mori every game and just save it for someone who managed to piss you off.
---
Thanks, that makes sense of it.
---
Jane is that you?
---
I have never seen a survivor do anything but run away the second you question them about their perspective on tunneling. Its like they think you designed this game. 
---
Yes, even your survivor brain is aware that the killer's objective is to kill one as soon as possible. Its the game's base design.
---
It would be cool to have a shapeshifter as a killer
---
Your survivor what?
---
Your killer what?
---
Ok dbd Rorschach
---
Except it won't work in multiplayer game
---
If you‚Äôre going to steal someone‚Äôs art work at least credit them.
---
I did it one time, but it was entirely pointless as they downed me 15s later and they weren't even carrying someone
---
You're right. That perk is totally useless now. No idea what they should do though
---
It needs a rework now but it wasn‚Äôt even worth running before the end game mechanics came out. Better off running literally anything else
---
Not even necessarily a waste if you died at the very end around when the gates were opened.  It's very possible to die and still earn more points than some who escape, though that extra 5k survival is always nice.
---
i think that they should take a chapter and devote it to making all the shitty perks(there's way too many) better so it's not just the same fucking perks game after game
---
Wait, I've been playing this shit for maybe 500 hours and it's the first time I see add on order matters.
---
I don't use flashlights, but what about toolboxes and medkits? In which order should you put add ons?
---
Tbh I just want the non leather coat and go to the OG fabric looking cloak. I'd buy that skin in a sec
---
*cries in canada*
---
I 100% agree with you but i wants more then Adrenaline dead hard Urban evasion and lightweight every game I play killer at rank 7 to 10 and it‚Äôs all i see
---
I like the way you play bro. Not just in terms of traps but the way you give the unhooked survivor a chance to escape and keep the game going. I like to play the same way as killer.
---
Demovoregon.
---
Pro move, good choice of strategy
---
Tunneling is unfortunately the easiest way to rank and secure kills. Its easy to get to rank 4 by doing so. Especially on high mobility killers (and you main 2 of the 3)...
---
I gotta actually play people other than gf, and Freddy lmaooo
---
Lmao when I first heard it I thought it was some kind of glitch! It was so loud
---
Totally agreed, DC punishment should be only for the people who turn off their connections to DC aka duplicating items.  
---
Leaving the match through the menu shouldn't be punish, you only lost your time doing this.
---
For all who aren't agreed with this, hope you don't get stuck or bugged all the match :)
---
I have four DbD players in my household and we've been trying to map out every, well, map in our heads in private matches just to improve ourselves. And almost every time, we're the same way. If we don't have every totem active, all four of us scour the map and frequently find ourselves  wondering where this inter-dimensional totem is.
---
Damn nematodes
---
Lol poor Bubba
---
Talking smack about my poor Freddy boi? Give him some goddamn love #SupportFreddyDBD
---
He camped my friends tho
---
Now I‚Äôm imagining the yee dinosaur if he was fused with eeyore
---
I feel like Bob Newby would be a better choice if survivor (I haven‚Äôt watched Stranger Things 3 yet so there could be a better choice)
---
I wonder if this was a joke? Ya know, the funny things that arent meant to be taken literally?
---
I mean steve is pretty damn heroic throughout the seasons, think itd be out of hop steve and bob
---
The Meta is the meta though. It has been Balanced/DeadHard/ , Adrenaline, Decisively, and your personal choice of a 4th (Self Care, WGLF, Mettle, Plunders, Iron Will) for awhile now. Sucks it‚Äôs that way but just gotta deal with it for now
---
I don‚Äôt who would want to buy the dlc, cosmetics, and teachables again. I expect very few mobile players.
---
hi
---
Maybe it's because I'm new to doctor and still getting used to his power but it feels like there is a short delay between the shock and the interaction blocker. Like sometimes I'll shock someone and the still perform an action like dropping a pallet or vaulting one.
---
The hatchet that struck pallet instead of u sliding over it was perhaps very unfair.
---
Apart from that he had a very bad strategy.
---
He was just trying to make some survivor soup :(
---
Hi! I luv u &lt;3
---
*cries in iPhone 5s*
---
Pretty no new mobile releases are playable on it anymore and Apple are dropping support soon.
---
Hehe
---
Shift key could be stuck if it happens in other games like something constantly being pressed without doing such a thing just look at the manual for your keyboard
---
Does technician make fixing generators louder? I had a friend tell me it does this due to a bug but I want to be sure
---
sorry, i just like you as a friend
---
Whats the message? That they should DC too because theyre at an automatic disadvantage?  
---
I think what most killers fail to get is that a survivor DCing screws over the rest of the survivors a lot more than the killer...
---
Offerings are expended at the beginning of the match. You always get the benefits from them through the entirety of the match, no matter what.
---
That player was just being rude. You're not required to save someone, especially if you know it would be a bad play. Feel free to ditch people whenever you like, since you're never beholden to them.
---
Jeff. He looks like Jesus and he sounds funny, I love him
---
Rebuilding the Dreadnought division. First put together a bunch of in house models to get a chance to have some prep-warrior battles
---
After not touching the game for 24 hours. I play against a 4-man survive with friends group who use a Haddonfield offering. I get all of them before they do a single generator and get banned immediately after.
---
I'm guessing I maybe got a bunch of reports from salty survivors or perhaps salty killers. I don't know why. I've never even teabagged in a hostile way or insulted people postgame. Never exploited the game. Never used cheats or hacks. I mean I haven't even ever used decisive strike or mettle of man.
---
**"Do you see any Survivors?"**
---
- No -----&gt; Find One.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I'm not disputing that as I'm a rank 1 survivor and killer. And you making this a killer vs survivor argument is deflecting from the point...
---
What I am stating is that the majority of DC's I come across are from killers tunneling off of hook. I'm not saying these are justified DC's as they ruin the game...
---
What I am saying is quite simple...if tunneling isnt addressed, these punishments for DC's will not deter survivors from doing it. They will either be banned or play another game.
---
I'm like 90% sure this was brought up in the stream.
---
Yes. Very much yes. I would buy this cosmetic
---
Is it because I'm ugly?
---
try the ps4 community, there's usually 
---
40+ parties and if you make a party you will probably fill up within 5 minutes
---
Yeah make him even more visible than he already is
---
I can‚Äôt find the ps4 community, I don‚Äôt even know how to use this app
---
Yeah I'm on console but it's fine with other games and it doesn't feel like sticky or anything
---
DCing is just a loss of bloodpoints and learning.  I understand OP wants to " learn at his own pace" but playing normally will at least net him some rewards that can further improve his characters.
---
idk, are you ugly?
---
The only time you do that is when that Survivor was annoying
---
I love Bill but really want Ellis
---
Lol what word
---
How the fuck you got DbD on mobile
---
It was not, it was however confirmed shortly after on the forums.
---
i dont make any claim that this is an intelligent method. he just asked how to derank, and i told him the easiest and most direct method
---
Oh you yeah I cba putting the the y and u. I mean who needs it right
---
So is it possible or not?
---
At least he‚Äôll have enough for 3 bowls :)
---
Kinda yea :C
---
That would be nice, of course than you‚Äôd need to adjust other offerings too
---
I tbagged and camped a nea who tbagged me as ghostface. Am I a bad person?
---
Even if it was Robert, I don't think we would get more since no killer really talks. I mean, maybe The Plague, but I doubt even devs know wtf she's murmuring, lol.
---
But dayingz "Bitch" after every hit would be perfect as a rework feature, lol.
---
gimme a sec to get home and ill give you instructions on how to get to it
---
Good build! Try nurse's calling and sloppy butcher, they work well for hag and see what you like
---
Imagine a mall map with like escalators to run up
---
Call it what you want, maybe you‚Äôve had bad luck in the past, but ask people who main killer and they honestly rarely use mori‚Äôs. When they do, daily or expecting toxic shenanigans

I doubt anyone played so many games with splinters to say for sure. But this achievement doesn't require any specific perks and/or add-ons, so I'd say it's doable
---
Fair enough.  I just hate the idea of other people getting fucked over because he's scared to play the game normally.
---
then yes, it's because youre kinda ugly yea :c
---
blight skins \*cough cough\*
---
As long as I get shit for brain teammates, I will throw games. Not DC, but intentionally kobe and/or not struggle on hooks, it is the way it is
---
I give up üòÖ Seem to be focusing in on tunnelling and who I main rather than how people think it‚Äôs ok to be so negative given it‚Äôs just a game. So if I was playing a lower tier character it wouldn‚Äôt be ok to be so toxic. And when I lose it‚Äôs ok to trash talk someone. 
---
I think DBD is a great game. Just people need to stop and think before they send a message...is this necessary. 
---
Pot kettle black regarding the bad sportsmanship - don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs bad sportsmanship being so toxic.
---
Seems I'm not the only one who got the scream bug
---
The killers who got blight skins don‚Äôt need to be stealthy. The literal stealth killer, however, does.
---
i mean i get unseen with all red so
---
Against what rank survivors
---
Fair enough then, my apologies.
---
Can I ask why you say 11.5 and not 12?
---
I don't get It, it couldn't have been that game because the ban would have to be reviewed, also most things as killer aren't bannable offenses, like tunneling and camping aren't bannable which is why insidious, borrowed time and D'S exist. Bad sportsmanship would be either nasty messages, or things like screwing over teammates as a Survivor, like boddyblocking a window or helping a killer. This is speculation thou, honestly I haven't seen a person get banned. I've also only been reported once by a rank 2 Survivor, and I'm a rank 15 survivor but that's because I suicided on hook because they brought a rank 20 with them and we were both hooked by a cannibal in the basemen5 so I said fuck it, but that's not even bannable. Things like witch hunting and harassing are thou. Maybe it was an honest mistake. If you care, and if you are certain you did nothing wrong you can dispute it with a ticket :) either way good luck!

What in de hot cwispy kentucky fwied fack is vommy yeshhmy? uwu

All the time in the world if you want, because you will be a pro to find them at some point with a lot of practice and memory
---
BWAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Give me 3 good reasons why.
---
Franklins works with legion‚Äôs frenzy
---
I knew it you shallow cunt.
---
I'm so excited! Left for dead was a favorite of mine :) also this makes me wanna run unbreakable more! Good job so far!
---
Yeah if there‚Äôs still 3-4 gens and the last survivor isn‚Äôt playing like a dbag I‚Äôll actively seek out the hatch and lead them to it
---
Surprise it‚Äôs another solo killer or survivor pepega
---
they said that 20 patches ago before he was fixed
---
So in the summer vacation you can't wogk either? It's not like you have to focus on rn.
---
This happened to me recently as Freddy, luckily they were almost done with gens and got out so I didn‚Äôt have to dc.
---
I'd rather not die immediately after getting unhooked
---
Didn‚Äôt you still 4K them ???
---
thanks bro! yea im playing that "fair" way, i find it more fun for both survivors and killers
---
You expecting people to be original or something?
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not even camping or anything
---
but
---
&gt;Obvi if you‚Äôve been on a hook before I‚Äôm gonna weaken your teammate and then kill you like why would I put some one on a hook who hasn‚Äôt been on one yet vs someone who already has been on one???
---
oh honey...
---
Well, I hope this helps but I don't run noed and I'm in red ranks
---
I've had that happen to me a couple times.  Sometimes can't use self care, wiggle, recover, or use a med kit.  I usually have to restart my game in order to fix it.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, this is what makes them better. Once they realize that this isn‚Äôt a good strategy they will get better
---
Legion will probably be the worst killer after the freddy rework
---
Should be called 'A guide to tunneling' just sayin
---
Lori Strode. Mainly because of the Halloween nostalgia but I have fun playing chase with OoO with her high waist jeans
---
Fake, we all know the Entity dislikes daylight
---
David king.
---
With the beard he looks like Johnathan read
---
OoO WoO, what's dis? uwu  
---
4's to 3's
---
Yeah, this has always bothered me; the power they thought of for him is amazing. Honestly, fucking great job. The addition of the theme and the special chase music- again, well done devs. But the mask... why does it look so off? It‚Äôs the one thing that I dislike about him. I know they need to ask permission, but they need to remake it like yours.
---
I'd prefer that you had dont
---
**SPOILERS FOR STRANGER THINGS 3**
---
There's also a [scene](https://imgur.com/a/Xf9lpQo) where Billy is carrying Eleven exactly like the Killer carries a survivor
---
I know it may not be much, but since those sounds are exacly the same basically, maybe this is some evidence, too.
---
Why is this being downvoted
---
i changed my mind, now it's bc you called me a cunt &gt;:(
---
The first time I heard it I jumped
---
Really hope this makes it to the game
---
Thing is... even if Freddy ain‚Äôt good at release, I still have faith they‚Äôll fix him. Not only did they fix Ghostface within a week of him being out, but they revoked most of the Piggy EGC changes and, over time, Spirit. I have faith it‚Äôll be a pretty good rework at release anyway, but if it isn‚Äôt- I think they‚Äôll do the right modifications.
---
i have heard this proposition before, i don't mind it. Plus it might a killer who is trying for a mori ritual.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a rights issue.
---
You sound even more cynical then I do.
---
But i guess thinking in absolutes might bring about some decent change. /s
---
She can‚Äôt hide the totem for the time it takes to get up to 5 stacks
---
It‚Äôs basically saying ‚ÄúNanana boo boo. You cant get us‚Äù
---
Either a giant middle finger to killers, or a big welcome sign that invites the killers to explore your ass with weapons
---
r/imsorryjon
---
Regrind
---
In Vault and Vanish change Iron Will for the most underrated perk in the game: Lightweight.
---
No u!!!!!! NO U!!! U R BAD MAN!
---
BBQ is easily countered by hiding in nearby lockers or using Distortion or simply being confident at looping and anticipating the killer. 
---
NOED is easily countered by finding and cleansing all dull totems plus, running Small Game helps too. 
---
I don‚Äôt think BBQ and NOED are broken or strong. They‚Äôre just annoying. And yes, I‚Äôm a survivor main.
---
&gt;Leaving the match through the menu shouldn't be punish, you only lost your time doing this.
---
Except by doing that survivors are not only screwing the rest of the survivors over, they're denying the killer a kill and/or remove themselves from the game so someone else can get hatch, which is uncounterable for the killer. DC-ing as a survivor affects a hell of a lot more than just you.
---
It's the opposite on Xbox. Almost immediate connection for survivor, 5 to 10 minutes to play as killer
---
Just habit. The actual chance is 11.53...% and I like seeing three digits on these kinds of calculation.
---
Dude sounds 12.
---
but cant you see
---
i am you
---
Wait...really?!
---
Man it sucks when survivors dc cause they make potato plays
---
It would he cool, but I dont think it fits the game. All the killers are people, monstrous people, but still humans.
---
Is she still the fairest of them all underneath the mask?
---
Ash looks just a little bit too young, but apart from that- pretty good job!
---
Yep. 90% of the time someone finds my totem before I even get to 3.
---
It's a multiplayer PvP game. You have to be cynical to play it for more than a couple of rounds.
---
Is this from a movie?
---
This is so cool!
---
I do that gen just for that sound. Most of the time I die on those maps anyway.
---
Nope. Source is above. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgCSnXqdFCg

(100-4)%\*(100-4)%\*(100-4)%= 88,4736%; 100 -  88,4736 =  11,5264%. Why am I getting downvoted?
---
So a hatch camper? That‚Äôs usually what they‚Äôre called.
---
Out of 100 attempts to kobe once, you can get far more and far less than 4.  
---
Out of 100 attempts to kobe three times, you can get far more and far less than 11.5.  
---
The overall chance still stays the same no matter what actual results are.
---
nah get bamboozled idiot LMAO
---
Also you can‚Äôt emote or struggle
---
I love the silence from them after that question was asked.
---
Michaels costume is clearly the best
---
Fuck
---
I think its symbolic of the metamorphosis the Entity hopes to provoke in the Survivors. 
---
I wonder whose it was? Nurse's? Wraith's?
---
Sick play man
---
Legion has had counterplay for quite some time now.
---
Feng Min only comes with the game on consoles, fyi. Still BS, though.
---
Two questions, how do you already have that many shards, and what‚Äôs going on with Feng‚Äôs hair lol
---
I think the same applies to Huntress Hatchets. 
---
I kind of wish Exposed would remain hidden until it's completely "Confirmed" you have it. I.E. if you puke on someone to break them and THEN M1 them, or M1 a No Mither user, etc. Exposed wouldn't show up. Heck even Billy Chainsaw reveals exposed. (And actually benefits from Exposed if you run speed limiter.)
---
I miss the old Devour Hope. Devour Hope 1 only had the Mori at 5 stacks and nothing else. I'd gladly trade the exposed effect just for the surprise Mori.
---
FUCK!
---
True but I guess because  we had to wait longer for the game
---
I have, but I'm a boomer so I've never played a mobile game and can barely control it. Trying to loop while controlling the camera seems an impossibility, at least for me. I'm considering getting one of those suction cup joysticks for the screen lel
---
Lvl 30 sooo yea i played it xD
---
Killer: tunnels for dying light
---
Adept Bill: You activated my trap card!
---
Do I really look like a guy with a plan
---
It would honestly make more sense if they changed the broken shell to a crows wing or something
---
I can hear the crows too, something is wrong with me
---
Who are they?
---
I have an idea for a wake up buff- what if it worked on gens too? /s
---
Tombstoned
---
I wonder, have Bill's perks EVER been on the shrine before? Did they get replaced with other perks for console users? (Since Bill's perks were generic survivor perks on console)
---
Doesn‚Äôt a fast jump into a locker alert the killer
---
You bet your sweet ass it does
---
Franklin's + Coldwind is the new meta
---
Quick question: how do you inspect perks / add-ons etc to learn about what they do
---
Only ever heard that in reference to killers before the end game update.
---
I feel so sassy while using it. Like &lt;&lt;Let's get that toolbox out of your hands before you hurt yourself darling&gt;&gt; kind of sassy. Feels dope
---
PS4 - Karambwanji looking for SWF. I've followed the game since release, but only started playing last week, I'm rank 11 killer and I think rank 15 survivor. I'm decent at the game, but not amazing.
---
Is that Feng? Also I only ship Doctor X Nurse for obvious reasons
---
They released a beta for Scandinavian countries
---
Thanks for the info :)  
---
I would make excuses with my friends like "bvhr are just trying out different dedicated hosts I guess, I believe they said they don't want to buy from companies like amazon, so that is why the servers aren't too good right now. **But hey atleast the killer doesn't have an advantage and will be just as laggy**"
---
No, it‚Äôs an OC. That‚Äôs why it says OC in the title. Also, I don‚Äôt ship that.
---
I'm the Iron Trapper, the rest are my mates.
---
Doctor too he is a funny boy
---
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
---
I've tried that particular build as well and found the same issue. Autodidact simply didn't get enough skill-checks to become relevant. I found that the "healing others" build works well with Pharmacy in place of Autodidact. Pharmacy allows greater healing speed for other survivors, as well as some healing for yourself. Can't be the healing hero if you're dead.
---
Not really. You can set your region to Sweden and it works as of now.
---
Survivors cant have nice things
---
Right!! Man I started playing again after a long break, I used to be a rank 6ish Freddy main.   
---
Now that my rank reset to 20 I decided to try out new killers (clown) and I swear to god SWF's purposely try to queue against rank 20 killers, and ontop of that the moment anyone gets downed THEY FUCKING DC. Atleast 1 or 2 a game usually...  
---
I see why it can be hard to rank up for killers now lol
---
Barb as a survivor please!
---
After doing the tutorial you get a bunch and then from playing matches. And yeah her hair makes her look like edna mode
---
if someone has We'll make it it makes even stacking sloppy/thanta/coulrophobia a complete joke
---
Damn, moonwalking on console. That is amazing, I wish I could do that
---
 *Platform:* PS4, but I'm sure it could potentially appear on other systems
---
*Type of Bug:* Visual/Ingame
---
*Description:* Made a thread on it a bit ago, it had two variants but was basically the same thing. One made it so I couldn't see one side of my screen leading to me dying pretty quick cause the killer would be obscured on one side of the screen. Other caused the map intro to never go away, making it so I couldn't see anything I would need to (more importantly the skillchecks)
---
*Screenshot / Video:* Apologies for the crap quality [https://imgur.com/a/lXWNg7t](https://imgur.com/a/lXWNg7t)
---
I have yet to have it happen again, but those pictures were taken literally a day apart, so I'm hoping it won't pop up.
---
Idk, I get downs all the time thanks to MaA. First hit is free because your TR is tiny, and then they panic and run straight into a trap, which leads to an easy down.
---
LOL flashbacks to giving last guy hatch or even letting them open exit gates and escape while you watch closely - and thinking "man this was a good game!" only to be met with all 4 of them cursing you out, telling you they hope your family dies of cancer... jesus.
---
I'd main Barb so quickly though.
---
Lol get your hands away from the lady's ass young man.
---
I dont run it myself, but it sure is a nice surprise when a teammate is. I think this might be a pretty underrated perk
---
I miss when that meme format was popular.  Some great ones came from it.
---
Implying red rank survivors aren‚Äôt potatoes, too
---
This. This is what ive waited been waiting for. Nothing tilts me as hard as people dc'ing.
---
That's reasonable I suppose but in my experience once I finally DO put that feng ming in a dying state she insta DC's so I end up getting very little bloodpoints, no tokens, + they keep their precious little maxed out purple flashlight. Such BS
---
It's pretty easy to tell difference when a survivor just wants you to focus them and when a survivor is trying their hardest to tilt you over the edge haha
---
Old things lol that literally happened to me on PC I was Micheal and I chased someone down and I got stuck inside the pallet and this happened within the first 2 mins of the match
---
Or elbow him in the back of the head.
---
The _C H I L I_
---
I don't use Franklin's if I use Lightborn. I want them to attempt to flashlight blind me at a pallet for it to fail and then I get a free hit down. Can't do it if they don't have an item.
---
I think the reason it looks goofy in game and also in the films sequels could have something to do with the fact that the mask is technically William Shatner‚Äôs likeness
---
If survivors are good they won't let you do it
---
It doesn't, because it barely does anything. The effect doesn't change too much.
---
Killer: Ah shit here we go again
---
Yes, my origin id is nikoab_cat. Keep in mind they have cc on in this post so they will look slightly different.
---
It's moments lile these where I'm happy I play Huntress
---
Just use an ebony mori or something like that
---
Oh god we're going to get punished for disconnecting against Killers that don't end the game when they could, aren't we
---
A Legion main? I never thought I‚Äôd find one of my own on this subreddit
---
Shouldn‚Äôt this be marked with spoiler or something
---
I thought it was more of a ‚ÄúWRAAAAAAA‚Äù
---
Why do you hate me I‚Äôm right!
---
&gt; You don't see it from a killer's perspective.
---
Kind of obnoxious to assume that, I was writing from a killers perspective as I play killer more than I do survivor. Infact I've never used it on surv outside of KYF shenanigans.
---
I know the situations you outlined above and thats why I only replied *probably,* but I still stand by what I said that new DS is tonnes better than old DS
---
Can‚Äôt wait to play this on my Motorola Razr
---
Ooo id love that mask!
---
whats the 1st fastest killer
---
We are everywhere. We are many. We are legion.
---
This is considered a dick move in Trapper culture.
---
(But actually well played!)
---
Yesss! What‚Äôs your go to cosmetic combo? Mine is the weird bloody mask that comes with Frank‚Äôs yellow outfit, green susie hoodie, and the neon blue karambit.
---
Lmao
---
Console Nurse? I tried on PS4. Got about 30 cakes plus about 10 BPS and escape cakes during double bp. I can't kill anyone above rank 10. She is so hard to use. Any tips? I'm good with every other killer I use. Usually Michael and Spirit but can use everyone but Nurse.
---
Why? They were plenty of announcements and pictures about it, it‚Äôs nothing special
---
That would be awesome, but I've always wanted a necromancer style killer, maybe some inspiration from lotr
---
Probably not since she‚Äôs been like this for a very long time. IMO she would have be nerfed pretty damn hard to make her not OP. Maybe a huge hit to her charge time and maybe if they made her 100% speed but added a cooldown to her ability would work
---
I wish I got messages from Jeff's like this, the only message form one I ever got was one who called me a "garbage ass kid" for trying to crawl to A Claudette who was waiting for me to die so I could get the hatch, which ended up with the killer following my corpse and finding the Claudette. The thing is: I knew where a key was, so If she picked me up, We could have both escaped.
---
I cant stop coming back here to watch those moves. I blame all of you for this
---
Snow White and the four Dwights
---
Any luck
---
You know, behaviour worked on the ps3 and xbox360 ports for shadow of mordor
---
Yeesh I have many. My go to combo is college bully jacket Frank, p3 mask and p1 knife but I also like the bloody smile mask that comes with the aforementioned bully jacket Frank, Joey's black hoodie, both bandanas and both karambits which I use interchangeably. Don't have any Susie cosmetics but if I buy any they will be for meme builds because nothing is more funny than getting killed by an art ho.
---
I find Stake Out so useful! Makes checks against ruins way easier (and all actions with skill checks easier/faster overall), warns you that the Killer is close before really hearing the heartbeat. It's one of my favorite perks. I got better at doing skill checks a bit so I don't really get much use out of it nowadays and it doesn't get a lot of use against more stealthy Killers, but I still like it.
---
The devs said that they are going to look at her with high priority in the near future meaby they are going to remove the add on that give her more blink
---
I'm rank 1/2 but okay.
---
Literally not a single soul:
---
We need more Robbie Rotten memes on this sub
---
I prefer that he didnt dont
---
Forgot to ask what build do you run? I go for BBQ, Discordance, Franklin's and Thrilling tremors. I love Franklin's on legion it's so fun.
---
Yeah I agree
---
Dwight, because I really liked his brown cosmetics, His brown ones are the only brown ones I consider worth the purchase.
---
And this is why so many languages spell animal noises completely different
---
I am NOT a killer main by any means. In fact I only have 2 teachables: Mad Grit and Discordance. So i usually run basic bitch builds like discordance sloppy mad grit and idk deerstalker
---
I have no idea if mask likeness rights are a thing in this case but if it is they aren‚Äôt allowed to make it look exactly like the actor and the mask the actor wore.
---
Dedicated servers
---
Iron grASSp.
---
Lol true also I‚Äôm pretty sure the plague is just chanting so Babylonian prayers or something
---
The only perk I benefit from is Discordance to prevent TOXIC genrushers. I just rely on addons and skill tbh
---
Huntress and Female Legion: *throws tantrum*
---
Gangbang me
---
When I use devour hope then NOED as a back up.
---
This will not destroy SWF. Just don't DC and you will be fine.
---
0/10 meme
---
HAHA
---
Ok so what‚Äôs your point here? You‚Äôre mad coz you think this guy was purposefully going against a noob killer by queueing with lower rank players but you‚Äôre still fine with people queueing with lower rank players?
---
Also me being a former twitch streamer doesn‚Äôt mean people knew I was a streamer and also doesn‚Äôt mean I have a certain play style. Now you‚Äôre just trying to come up with an excuse to say I‚Äôm toxic because I disagree with you. I don‚Äôt even have that in my in game name. God forbid I just play the game normally and talk to viewers without trying to be an Ochido wannabe.
---
Seen ppl getting called a camper even though they where running MYC and BBQ on Spirit, lol.
---
Discordance is a very underappreciated and very powerful perk. Let's you stop that filthy gen rushing quickly and prioritize targets. I use it on almost all of my killers probably except certain ones like doctor. As for like mad grit it's ok. It's one of those perks that works either with certain builds or with certain playlists like for example against bodyblocking swf but other than it's not that good. As for add ons sketchbook and iridescent button and I go to town üëå
---
I know right, just leave billy boi alone..
---
True- but I feel there were ways for them to make a decent Myers mask without the Shatner likeness, no matter how stripped down it is.
---
Yeah that's in part why I included it in the meme. When I first started playing the game I used it so often for the same reasons you said but eventually dropped it to get better at skill checks and knowing where the killer is on my own. I still really enjoy it though and want to get it on my Ace
---
Context: Amanda tried to pull a sneaky one on me. Little did she know. Or maybe she just wanted to die. I don‚Äôt know. I thought it was funny how she thought that window would lead to the roof. :D
---
It‚Äôs just a bug until they add names
---
I need those sweet, sweet struggle points.
---
How do you get video from ps4 to reddit
---
I think 10 survivors disconnect in my matches to every 1 killer. Probably more.
---
I love that it's in order
---
All wrong, too predictable, you'll just end up chasing the same person until gates are open.
---
I didn‚Äôt even notice that, that‚Äôs so cute!
---
Download an app called ShareFactory from the PSN store. Edit / trim videos with that app. Plug in a USB to your PS4 and transfer the edited video from your Capture Gallery to your USB and then to your PC/Laptop/MacBook.
---
Getting sick of waiting for these to come out honestly.
---
The nea was likely trying to help you ; this bug has been around sinch launch so usually someone in your lobby will know about it, and you can get out by grabbing a survivor that's sliding on the pallet(So grabbing, not hitting like you did). It sucks, but if it ever happens again at least now you know
---
How can I get BBQ and chili?
---
I need Myers number yesterday.
---
You need to learn words before you use them.
---
Gambler‚Äôs Fallacy would be saying the chance is higher every time you fail the unhook, because come on, no WAY I fail to unhook 10 times in a row!
---
Wish it made the same sound when I cleanse ruin
---
The whole lights thing is a really, really cool idea. Probably better adapted for a different killer, but I like it.
---
For all the shit the current Freddy gets, at least, his daily is the easiest to accomplish. Just M2 at Survivors four times.
---
This image jumpscared me.
---
I just imagined Billy Myers Doctor and Hag surrounding and continuously beating a poor default Dwight
---
Facts
---
Even if he did use a rare offering, he‚Äôs still a dickhead.
---
Time for Myers and Trapper to hit the weights.
---
I thought he was carrying the pole that looked like a cross! Lol crucifixions should be a thing in this game.
---
You're not supposed to get them when you own a killer, this is just an unfortunate bug for you.. I haven't seen one after I bought all killers
---
As soon as Xbox live detects an altered file, it kicks you offline, you can‚Äôt hack on Xbox, it must of been an exploit,
---
Did you record the gameplay of this ?
---
Different Manufacturer and different parts. 
---
I think Billy‚Äôs saw might have a longer bar then Leatherfaces.
---
That makes sensei, but I really hate flashlights.
---
Bubba can take out multiple people at once, that‚Äôs the main difference
---
That timer don't phase me.
---
Actually most nurse mains dont even know what a pallet is
---
Billy‚Äôs chainsaw can be used to travel around the map in a short amount of time, but it can only down one survivor at a time.
---
Bubba‚Äôs chainsaw can only hit targets directly in front of him, but he can down multiple survivors at a time.
---
To be fair, the increased lunge, window vault speed, and movement speed makes him unstoppable. I don't like using NOED, but I did use that with Fire Up and Bamboozle/Brutal Strength, and you can become a late game *monster*. If any pallets are left, you shred through them. If there aren't, windows won't save them. You gain on them so quickly and can really move far with that lunge and 119% movement speed.
---
ok so on the main menu of your ps4 hover over the game and go down. there's a communities option. there's a bunch of them where you can find parties to join or post your own party
---
Lol try playing without ruin jk I‚Äôm messing with you ( I hate that perk and I‚Äôm a killer main I can‚Äôt stand it)
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they warn you before you can prestige
---
The look behind button seems like it would help during chases. The controls seem pretty intuitive. From watching gameplay it seems pretty natural how the gameplay functions with a touch screen.
---
300 IQ thinking camping is bannable
---
This has happened twice back to back and now I'm down 50,000 blood points

learn how survivors run and learn the blink. there's a ton of youtube videos man, just look it up

Me too tbh

---
I'm not saying it's useless, there are just perks she can make use of.
---
Would this be the same for killers then who DC when they start losing?
---
Level up "The Cannibal", better known as "Bubba" to level 35. Once you have purchased the teachable from the bloodweb with bloodpoints on Bubba, everyone can learn it. 
---
BBQ and Chilli makes it so that all survivors outside of 40 meters, will have their aura shown for 4 seconds, whenever someone is hooked. You also gain a stackable bonus of bloodpoints for every unique survivor hooked. Each stackable bonus is a 25% increase to all scoring events, and stacks with offerings. Level 1 of the perk gives you a maximum of 50% extra bloodpoints, then 75, and level 3 is 100%. So, the effects of the perk in a game, doesn't change at all if you level the perk up, but, leveling it up gives you a bigger bloodpoint count at the end of the game, when the game ends.
---
Hope this helps.
---
All perks are crutches, except No Mither :P no Mither is a handicap...
---
I don‚Äôt own him
---
Funny how you're saying all this like you've actually even played him
---
If the timer exceeds 10 minutes, just ban the wankers for 24 hours. Not like they're playing the game anyways.
---
Nice play.  Why did you take the long way out of curiosity?
---
Lol maybe 30 min
---
And then it gets cleansed before you can mori :(
---
Honestly I've been trying to not use it because it gets cleansed right away most games, and even if it doesn't survivors tap gens anyway, but as soon as I take it off, the game ends in a couple minutes :/
---
It makes more sense. He both ‚Äî makes people see stuff (hinders outside the radius); controls the dream zone and can warp reality (slows, Vision, tps etc). And people fall asleep naturally too (every 60 seconds), rather than only while being chased by Freddy. 
---
So, overall, I think he is much better both lore-wise and power-wise. But to each their own I guess....
---
I think the term ‚Äúcrutch perk‚Äù is thrown around too often. I also wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs for horrible killers either.
---
It adds pressure for survivors once the gens are done since killers lose a lot of pressure once the gens are done.
---
I will say it‚Äôs not very enjoyable to just be smacked and downed without any real warning.
---
I think just letting the survivors know that they are exposed once it‚Äôs active would be much more enjoyable.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I guess I‚Äôm not allowed to have predictions on how well the buff will turn out. Silly me, I forgot I have to have first hand experience with everything before having an opinion on it.
---
He as a killer, sucks. But, for 5‚Ç¨, you get 3 perks that'll help you immensely. He's the only killer who, with specified perks and killers, only has good perks. He's worth it, get him ASAP. But, finish your Hag first, it'll help you more.

I see killers disconnect all the time. Whether its because im in the higher ranks or whatever the reason, i have a lot of wasted games thanks to it being half way through and them just pulling the plug. Half the time even though i shouldn't depip from it, i find it still does. Your offerings are still wasted if the killer dcs after the loading screen. If they dc during the loading screen you get them back.
---
Yes survivors dc'ing is a problem and should be addressed (cause there are a lot of them) but a lot of killers dc too just wasting our time and offerings.
---
your video is still not allowed have a nice day
---
"OP" = Actually viable in most ranks to the point where Survivor mains would rather nerf the shit out of them instead of learn how to counter them/knows how to counter but still wants them to be nerfed anyways because bias.
---
Oh damn, son... the dream, while I'd say I'm pretty satisfied on how Michael looks in game, but I'd take your version in a heartbeat. Very nicely done!
---
Bcuz if i went the other way i wouldve risked him catching up to me and hitting me before i got to the hatch and i also thought the hatch was closer to the pallet
---
wow this is terrifying
---
The Y3 event was bollocks with how many flashlights I endured. It came to the point where I just mori'd anyone who brought one in.
---
Your gonna get a VAC? I want a VAC!
---
Hard pass.  Too many moving variables like power outages and internet drops.
---
That's being a bit generous. You expect behavior to improve after 10 minutes.
---
Yes! I just love his little giggles when he gets stunned, it's like he enjoys it lol.
---
i know but ghostface since he doesn‚Äôt have a mobility ability i use it so i can at least find someone before 2 gens are gone ya know lol
---
People are already rewarded for playing as intended, what could possibly be wrong with that?
---
Also, "grow some balls", what? What kind of sexist remark is this supposed to help with anything?
---
The only gen in the whole game that I didn‚Äôt care about the killer knowing I was on! Will pop that one every time!
---
There should always be a way to counter certain perks or certain playstyles, so that's why I think you are just not seeing the point if it
---
The accuracy of this is amazing.
---
I quite enjoyed that actually. Not as bad as I thought it might be.
---
I don't play gf, but i would instabuy that skin and start playing him
---
No mither is a counter to noed
---
Very true! Now if I‚Äôm knocking gens out, that means your leading point and running the killer around to where I can do that and then have the gate opened for you at the end of the match? If so I‚Äôm your Jockey!
---
:/
---
Nah, gotta go for that Phoenix shirt on feng

I downvoted you for your last sentence. I agree with the rest.

Yeah that is true

Big Booty Jane Mains unite!!!

Not bad. They could have a cosplay or Halloween outfit pack. Need more maps too.
---
Lesson learned as killer, never ask permission to farm, survivors will usually not understand. Unless it's double blood point event, in that case make an attempt, but don't waste your time.

Fuck that! Staby Stab!

Everyone makes mistakes
---
Same. I just think we should have a chainsaw-hand cosmetic for Ash so this would have been even better. :D
---
(this would be a simple cosmetic without any gameplay mechanic associated with it ofc, like the puppet hand and the wooden/mechanical hand.
---
Quick question how do you inspect add-ons and perks I wish to learn more about them I tried pressing my finger on them and it does nothing
---
So basically making Legion a powerless M1 killer against SWFs and anyone with a brain? Nah fam
---
My point was a joke, of which survivors dc. Especially swf.
---
Claudettes' dream
---
Wow what an out of the box thought. Bravo dude
---
Potato, potahto
---
This isnt a good idea. Please try again.
---
Puppet makes no sense anyways after watching the show. But they should make a chainsaw for his hand that Pablo forgets to fill up.
---
I would rather not turn him into a disguise killer
---
I want old man Myers mask as a purchasable cosmetic add on!
---
This is just a basic idea tho. I would like to hear some improvements if you have any, Maybe trying to avoid him being a M1 killer
---
Right but thats basically how it is for every other game. Most of the casual game modes in other games mix and match players.
---
Not too new.  You‚Äôre using pre-~~nerf~~ rework Legion.
---
Yeah! Fuck you for playing the game!
---
Instant heals are addons rare/ultra rare addons so they aren't meant to be strictly balanced. Like you wouldn't complain about ultra rare killer addons being op so I don't see why it doesn't go the other way. 
---
Dead hard and decisive strike are easily predicted and countered, and adrenaline is extremely situational and inactive until the very end of the game. I play both sides around rank 8 each and rarely have issues with them.
---
i'm fuckin' done
---
it wouldn't be possible mainly because "The Haunting of Hill House" doesn't have a specific killer to go by.
---
Squadette
---
Netflix also has a show called Slasher. I've only really watched one episode but I'm sure it'd have some content that could be used since the show is all about serial killer/slashers.
---
Trapper can hook me anytime I won‚Äôt resist.
---
well yes they do i was just adding feedback lol
---
I've had games where I'm chasing someone, and some David with a medkit just runs in front of me, obviously wanting me to chase him. I get accussed of hard tunneling when I don't go for him. A lot of people think hard tunneling is not doing everything in your power to find a different target.
---
Legion doesn't need a rework again, he isn't unfun to play against, just because you have to mend yourself instead of holding that M1 on generators. He is easily beatable, not a top tier killer at all. He does actually require a lot of skill to play. He doesn't have an anti-loop tool once he gets the  free hit on you.
---
Saying he requires little skill is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. The character is designed to get an easy first hit on you and to be able to actually down you, he has to chase you and outsmart you when you are running around the same obstacle 20 times and then throwing down the pallet and then going to the next one, more known as looping :).
---
If Legion makes 1 mistake, his power gets fully depleted, and actually it really isn't hard to not get hit by his frenzy attack. Just loop the same window 4 times during his frenzy and he won't catch up to you, don't switch loops during his frenzy because when he's in his power, he's **VERY SLIGHTLY** faster than you. You gain that speed back by vaulting, because survivors vault windows faster than Legion during his power.
---
Legion is actually way harder than any anti-looping killer, because he actually has to go through the looping stuff without being able to blink through walls or phasewalk or anything. If you are good at looping, you won't have a problem with Legion.
---
And please stop saying Legion is unfun because you have to mend. Everyone knows survivors only say that because they only want to brainlessly hold M1 on gens all game, its stupid.
---
No worries lol and you do keep teachable skills for other characters as well
---
It‚Äôs only a spoiler if you have completely avoided any of the countless posts and updates about it
---
Time to back out.
---
Anyone remember how calm spirit was supposed to prevent the crows from squawking when you go on the boat? One of the most niche possible uses for a perk and it doesn't even work lmao.

The ingame mask still looks better than some of the masks in the sequels. Your version is far superior however!

Tbh i never asked for it

Came here to say take dead hard instead of break down wince deliverance will leave you broken but everyone else beat me to it.
---
All I heard when I saw this 
---
BWAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Yes they can.
---
Unbreakable instead of breakdown. Good chance you'll be slugged if you're the obsession.
---
They can it‚Äôs how you can mind game em a little bit 
---
Good survivors will throw a pallet down if they think your uncloaking to slow you down     They hear the bells and see you almost uncloak. Throw it down.    And then I cancel the uncloak

what platform? If you are on steam try to process a refund. I don't think you are allowed to refund DLC but see what options it gives you, maybe a support ticket will open but steam support is REALLY bad.

Question, what happened to Sprint Burst being the premier exhaustion perk? What made that fall out of meta?
---
Forgot to mention. It was on ps4. Sorry
---
The crows work for the entity 
---
The entity doesn‚Äôt exactly have a side.   He obviously favors the killers a little more but he just likes the chaos over all.    Keeps things interesting for him if the crows played both sides
---
People still use it but balanced landing and especially deadhard can be used very situationally while spring burst exhaust you the moment you sprint
---
Oh that's great. I wasnt sure if I was wasting my time just clanging and slowing myself.
---
I can hear it
---
She *is* the bad guy
---
Ah. That's fair. Do people not know about the crouch trick? I learned it a few days ago on here actually

but... rework u gonna see him when ur not asleep tho
---
ok i will
---
try restoring licenses. It's somewhere in your playstation settings, don't remember where exactly.
---
Well I don't know how sony support is but that's probably your best  bet
---
Thank you.
---
You should probably report this to behavior rather than complaining on a sub reddit.
---
Kick them in the face

Vault and vanish: I'd change the iron will for lightweight or poised to make it harder for the killer to find your scratch marks afterwards. (Actually, I'd make it a 2 in 1 build and add head on into the mix) however, the build is pretty solid regardless
---
Healing Others: either make a build around autodidact or switch it out for pharmacy. Autodidact does not go well with perks that increase healing speed
---
Pain In The Ass: not a vey strong build, but it sure as hell will do it's job, no change needed here
---
with perk they are your spies, the entity loaned them too you
---
Best if combined with shadow dance
---
Okay I know this question is probably really dumb, but when actually is the mid chapter update. I‚Äôm trying to get my bill on
---
I do find ruin alot with that outfit.
---
What is the idea?
---
Have you tried cleansing all of the totems before you rush the objectives?
---
This may seem obvious, but are you sure they downloaded?
---
crows only move when killers is near them killer isn't always near them
---
the crows do not always caw, they fly away and only do so when a killer or survivor is near them
---
Destroys the purpose of the build
---
Disconnected by daylight
---
I'd be down for a sabrina chapter too.
---
rip my 0/10 joke
---
Changed it a bit. Should be more understandable now
---
I understand that Behavior that got the rights for Michael Myers, but do you think they also need the rights for Shatner, since the mask is his likeness as well??
---
Ok everyone's talking about the ass, but i love the dedication of picking someone up, i dont think ive seen this in any cosplay here before. Not only that, but the cosplay looks nice, Props to you and cheers!
---
To just wait by the door and the killer to just wait by the hatch?
---
Don't save someone if you don't think you can do it. The dead guy may be angry but at least 1 escapes. 
---
At least this how I think when I'm on the hook.
---
He may also be losing on some blood points and items on his death
---
Yeah
---
If you're going for the healing build, I think empathy is the better choice in this particular instance
---
It doesn't  show the option to download. I have the Halloween DLC as well and it downloaded automatically. There isn't anything currently downloading and I have restarted the game many times.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ca0f7f/gamebreaking_bug_prevents_you_from_escaping/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Don‚Äôt forget the OOF boys
---
Or pharmacy
---
I'm not sure if that's an idea or more so just what everyone's already been doing.
---
Personally I hang by the door for about a min until I just work on gens again. An as a killer I just close it automatically considering I already got 3 kills I don't really *NEED* a 4th.
---
Then do what I do and go get a gen done and break some totems. If you know they are standing off go get some blood points.
---
I mean yeah, you can still have a slight standoff, but theres at least stuff you can do about it. If the killer is just camping hatch, that gives you the opportunity to go do a door. If the survivor is camping a door, killer knows to leave the hatch. Before you legit just sat there staring at eachother until one of you voluntarily took the L
---
Welp, should've offered more luck.
---
It's still not enough to make Doctor good. His chases are just too long because his tools don't allow him to end them quickly. You can loop around same debris tile and finally get the blocking shock but meanwhile all the gens are done
---
True 
---
but it‚Äôs really just a perk that helps you with a certain tracking aspect
---
Like bloodhound makes blood brighter if you have a hard time seeing spies helps those with a harder time hearing the crows
---
Or the nurses perk that makes groaning louder 
---
So some could argue spies is the entity giving you even ground assuming you can‚Äôt hear the crows or have good directional set
---
Pretty good drawing! The Entity on the center is the perfect touch!
---
&gt;Maybe I'm just trash
---
this
---
Would be a nice little edge to drop on a mostly unused perk, i like it.
---
Someone else had an idea that I like and added to but it would probably take a lot of coding that is not worth it. Since The Legion is a gang there will be multiple members are Legion walking around. 1 is the player and the others are AI. The AI will slowly patrol their parts of the map every X amount of time for X amount of time. If they see a player they will alert the player with a sound notification. The AI can not hurt survivors. I'm not sure what else to do to this idea but I really like the concept.
---
No matter how cool it is, they've stated that they only want humanoid killers and stuff like werewolves are off the table
---
They should only punish the first person who disconnects. Its not uncommon to get games where 2 people disconnect, why should I then be expected to stay in a 2 vs 1 game? Why do I have to suffer through a shit tilted game or face consequences?
---
Sure you can say ‚Äújust let the killer kill you‚Äù but then I have to seek them out or get their attention and hope they dont slug me just to get the last guy because many are sweaty enough to do that.
---
Disconnects are an issue but disconnect timeouts work in other games because theres normally no reason to d/c. With dbd there are so many fucking bugs, exploits and trolls in the community that its not surprising the disconnect rate is so high. Getting stuck on a tree, stuck in a locker, farmed by douch survivors working with the killer just to troll, killers bodyblocking the hatch, survivors glitching into areas they shouldnt so that you cant reach them. Thats not even to touch the insane balance issues that make everyone salty.
---
Obviously disconnects need to come down  but the devs have made very little effort to address any of the legitimate reasons why people would disconnect. Thats why people assume its going to hurt the game. The other examples listed dont have anywhere near as many bugs or trolls as dbd does.
---
I can't believe you say that you stopped using self care a long time ago and then go on to suggest using urban evasion
---
They should put that toothless kid as a survivor. I forgot his name.
---
Platform: PS4  
---
Type of Bug: In-game
---
Description: At random sprint burst will fail to work despite the fact that it's charged up, and it's been happening since since the latest patch.
---
That's why I was surprised he didn't find me lol
