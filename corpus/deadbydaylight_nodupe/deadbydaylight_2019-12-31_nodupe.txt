The game has never been more killer sided in history and yet this thread is full of killer mains complaining, go figure
---
[Check here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank)
---

---
The game tries to rank you against survivors of similar rank. You rank up when you perform well.
---
Performing well consists of:
---
1) Denying survivors to finish repairing generators
---
2) Hooking, killing and/or sacraficing survivors.
---
3) Hurting survivors by hitting them and denying them healing.
---
4) Successfully hitting survivors in chase and leaving the hook area, when someone is on the hook.

tier 3 fly forever, become one with the entity

I agree, I would love to see that. I just wish her (mostly talking about the purple ones) addons weren't jokes. I don't want them to be straight buffs, but I wish they weren't such a joke.
---
An example addon for what I mean would be like give her 3 chain blinks instead of 1 main blink and 1 chain blink, then maybe boost her movement speed for a little more mobility. I don't know if that would be a good one, but i'm just trying to think of ones that can change Nurse's playstyle and giving her different fun ways to play without directly buffing her.
---
I guess her current purple add-ons are sort of trying to do that, but it just feels like they are all direct nerfs to her power or don't provide any strenths.
---
No, she's too OP.
---
Just Monika
---
Just.Monika.
---
Also if all of the survivors are on the unblocked gens and you (somehow) don’t manage to find them until all 4 are popped, you still would have about 40 seconds of time to set up around the 3 blocked off gens, which can easily lead to a 3-gen if you have the right map and spawn location.
---
Coming right up!
---
Sorry for the late reply, Reddit didn’t give me a notification, but organized teams show up every now and then for me but I am not Red Ranks yet (tho I do face Red Ranks mostly). 
---
Those matches where everyone is perfect and you can’t do anything always make me question why I even play Killer.
---
As you should
---
I’d give up ten of those damn things for a safe one. If you don’t get a stun, the killer will be able to  go around it and hit you. And with the hitting through pallets situation they’ve had for a while. You can’t do much about it
---
You do get a level if you collect the Epilogue?
---
She’s so cute!
---
I want this so badly but I just know that I would hate every second of every match against him
---
Nope, wasn't me that mentioned that.
---
It probably will weaken/render heartbeat perks useless on Clown, but I do think that Coulrophobia might be an exception and make healing more interesting when Survivors have to choose between suffering the heal penalty or trying to bypass it by being in range of the generator gas but risking getting jumped by the clown (especially if that Clown has Nurse's Calling). Unlikely but could happen, would need to be tested definitely.
---
Also I didn't think about gen tapping actually, probably should adjust it to linger for a second. Nice catch, thanks for the feedback!
---
I didn't say she needed a one-shot, maybe you misread my post. (Sorry it's kinda of a big wall of text it may be hard to understand lol)
---
Za warudo!!!
---
The epilogue yes but I'm meaning every single challenge, some people could just go for the epilogue and not bother with the more grinder quests. We should get atleast a level for doing every single one since some have more than 15 in a tome. From all our awards we should only have to grind about 2/3 tiers, none if we spend our cells.
---
DBD is a big part of the company.  I think they wish it was smaller than it is, as they would like to branch out more and build a more diverse portfolio, but DBD continues to do extremely well.
---
As I said though, and you were stating as well - it's a challenge to not just balance, but even know where to balance.  Years in and you have a hardcore community largely at odds with improving the new player experience, as well  the asymmetrical aspect of it adding another layer of complexity.  I think the one saving grace the game has from this perspective is that they have more freedom with balance than your typical e-sports title.  That does give them a bit more wiggle room to make bigger changes that I feel they probably don't lean enough on (as well as their test realm).   
---
I don't blame them really, if I were in charge of balance I would feel paralyzed by how many changes are requested and at odds with each other, and how some seemingly simple changes are actually massive undertakings, all in a system that was not initially designed to ever be anything close to what it has become.   It does make me wonder why they don't do a simple numbers pass on the less used perks in the game, though.  I feel given how much testing and work it would take vs. more ambitious changes, it would be a no-brainer.
---
The Pig nerf was forever ago and she's still 100x better than Legion. Did they nerf her again or something?
---
Beautiful!!
---
Doctor is easiest one? Almost impossible to not get shocks with add ons throughout an entire game. Green node and game piece and it's 100% guaranteed
---
[removed]
---
I guess running to safe loop #97 and pressing space bar is too hard.
---
Oh shit you’re right. I forgot the Blendette Mantra: Gideon Bad, Yamaoka Good
---
I’m in red ranks, so there’s honestly no excuse for it.
---
Other than iri head they really don’t.
---
Myers has to stack up a ton of evil to the point you most likely exhaust atleast 1 survivor from it.
---
Clown’s exposed is generally just a bad version of huntress iri head. I don’t Think it needs anymore downsides when you have to hit the bottle directly on survivors and they only get exposed from it.
---
Also noone were talking about nurse getting an insta down. Op just pointed out that those addons significantly boost the killers power or change the way they play meanwhile nurse’s are just generally useless.
---
Do I think nurse needs a buff on her addons? No not the slightest.
---
I do think it would be nice to see ultra rares that somehow change the way she plays.
---
Happened to me all the time today, and all of them were Claudettes. But the best thing is, that in like 50% of the matches I died on first hook because they were busy with hiding in the corner of the map
---
Like I said I understand she is really good, and I don't want a buff. I just meant she sort of feels a lot less fun after the nerf and I was just trying to express how I wished she could undergo some kind of change to once again make her satisfying to play without straight up buffing her.
---
This is a clear example on how long can be queue time to play as killer.he's probably sleeping on his keyboard!

Walk in with your eyes closed that wait the killer can’t see you

Get ghost face
---
Legion is fine 99% of the survivors panic when they face them..... It is like screaming fire in a crowded theater. Have you ever seen two players body block a third when all that means is you get to hit all three. Pig is fubared she can 4K but is fubared because her way kills pips. Nurse is 50% players not willing to relearn her when others are so easy and 50% servers killing her power due to lag bounce.
---
I understand what you mean now, and I agree for sure
---
Then it's okay to go for the slug and hook anyways because rank doesn't matter :^)
---
You've got 40-50 max out of almost 200,000.  That's hardly a hive mind.
---
this is a mob mentality I'm seeing here from a minority of the community population.  
---
Rule of mob is often mistaken as history has shown. 
---
And there is no right, or wrong opinion here anyway...in my opinion.
---
his power is still a stronger Hillbilly by far, sure you can't do a 90 degree turn around corners anymore, but he is still able to down survivors quickly.
---
Memematic strength eh?
---
secret hag counter
---
*Larry
---
&gt; Because I'm not nieve enough to believe serial killers, and monsters 
---
Ah yes, I forgot that we merge our consciousness with the game when we play.
---
I'll give a proper response later but I meant Hawkins not Haddonfield, I bamboozled myself and edited lol
---
I was thinking that may be intoxication would stop repairs... Or maybe throwing a bottle at a generator will stop it from repairs for a bit of time.
---
Very dependent on where generators are in relation to windows. Had a round where all the survivors could see me because the gens were in safe spots ;(
---
Rank doesnt, but bloodpoints do
---
The time limit is what really makes it grinds, if it was just an achievement web that you could do at your own pace it wouldn’t be a problem. But it has a time limit, meaning for those who want all the cool sh*t on there are going to have to grind to get it in time.
---
Oh man you mean I didn’t have to run a no mother build? That was painful
---
When I reply, I can only see yours because it doesn't take you to the thread.
---
Thanks! I am pretty sure she made her own pattern.. somehow, but I don’t know much about cross stitching, much more about DBD lol
---
So you're the survivor side of me. Cause I hate red ranks as killer.
---
And i have the feeling every version of preschool is in the random generator. I always get this map.
---
I think it adds depth and forces new playstyles. Basement hooks? Use agitation and iron grasp, not basement LF. It's just people are toxic
---
Awwww whittle Baby wants him's bottles buffy wuffied???
---
I think it’s a good indicator that I’m on the right track, buddy.
---
Is that from the latest one?
---
That doesnt satisfy my addiction though
---
https://youtu.be/aal2N3o55Fg Same energy
---
It's from the video where he donates 500 euros to streamers.
---
Is that why people are doing this? It helped when my challenge was break pallets or gens though haha
---
Is it possible to get a photo *without* all of the heavy photo-editing and Filters? 
---
You look like a Bratz Doll.
---
Stealth is a big aid to them, because survivors can't tell when they're safe or not.
---
Legion announces their presence, so there's always time for survivors to escape. I'm All Ears is pretty powerful on Legion, because it allows them to better mindgame a survivor and to *safely* drop out of Frenzy near them - as opposed to trying to winging it and hoping that you correctly predicted where the survivor is going to go. Unfortunately for Legion, I'm All Ears is on a timer, and relies on the survivor doing a rushed vault, so even with the perk your "cadence" is slower than other killers.
---
Step 1: Make Ruin a non-hex perk
---
Step 2: Give it a 2.5 minute timer
---
Game balance is hard
---
Lmfao
---
I just completed this challenge yesterday as doctor on the game a map where no matter where ya down the survivor unless your in the bathroom gen room that basement is always too damn far without agitation and iron grasp
---
Using pallets doesn’t fuck over anyone lol. Unless your team sucks and they don’t do gens
---
Oh yeah, we really need more maps where the killer can run around a pallet in 1 sec and always get a free hit.
---
Yes, Ghostface is the most underrated survivor.
---
All indoor maps were shown to have quite low survival rates and Haddonfield has already been said to be getting a rework- so I have no clue what this meme even means
---
Maybe don't camp the pallet after it's thrown, and try to get a stun when throwing it?
---
Everybody gangsta til Myers joins the chainsaw gang
---
Gotcha. My bad for jumping the gun on you. I’ve just been bombarded by people for trying to argue for balancing on both sides. They want the changes that favor their side but don’t even want to mention the fact that their are problems on the other. I’d like to have a conversation, but don’t want to participate in some groupthink BS that will never come to fruition. It’s all about balancing, which I truly believe BHVR is trying to give and is heading in the right direction.
---
I agree I deadass did insidious bubba in the basement to get the 4 in the basement and yup I got it 1st try, and I pipped to make it worse lmao, but hey why stress when I can do that.
---
Hows that matching making going devs?! Stopped playing today because I'm tired of playing with level 18's (I'm 6) How's that working devs??
---
Welcome to the club.
---
I would highly recommend getting a DLC character that you can’t get with shards later on. Possibly Laurie for DS.. have a look at everyone’s perks or just choose a character you think you’d like to spend time playing. 🎃
---
Yeah she's the most powerful killer, easily. But she feels frustrating. Why does game feel only matter when it comes survivor game play but killers are expected to deal with clunky bullshit all the time? 
---
Her rework sucked. It is clunky. And feels like shit. Idgaf how strong she is.
---
Ghost face imo. I’m a surv main but I love
---
Playing against him and he’s my killer main
---
God yes that's what he needs. Reduced missed basic attack cooldown, increased speed and he gets the intoxicated screen effect and sways side to side as if a survivor is struggling with him, giving him a kind of Leatherface's chainsaw attack.
---
You can't be taken seriously when we see you guys asking for faming as killer to get your 4 traps challenge done.
---
At this point you're just shit.
---
One game the game started and not even into a few seconds, a DC came. 10 seconds following the first DC came the second one. 1 minute after the second DC, the third one came.
---
1 was the last one left and 5 gens were left. 
---
I was killed.
---
Soon: „Killer have a killrate of 95% in red rank
---
You: „Useless data. Please nerf survivors more.“
---
Legion has been a real rollercoaster.
---
When released he was very ineffective and quite buggy. Best way to down survivors was pretty much locking on them and hitting them while in feral frenzy over and over until they drop.
---
First rework gave them more speed, tried to make feral frenzy more impactful by making it last longer, but in exchange hitting someone with deep wound in feral frenzy would no longer do much anything.
---
Second rework made the feral frenzy attacks not count as basic attacks anymore.
---
Underlying problems were never fixed. The power is extremely weak, but also very boring to play against. Devs work towards Feral Frenzy being big meaningful moment, but actually hitting someone with it has very little impact.
---
It's going to depend on your perks, add-ons, and playstyle. Some Plagues run infecton speed add-ons so that they can instadown after one puke. Other Plagues prefer to get everyone infected before they wipe the whole team in a single activation of Corrupt Purge.
---
Probably best to start by looking at what *you* are having difficulty with. Where are you losing the game?
---
Don't run into a corner of the map to heal, instead to a safe place that's nearby with a loop that you can use if the killer finds you. At least this is how I use it and had success so far. It's kinda like Unbreakable and Deliverance, it allows you to do something that you usually need team mates for on your own. However, if you are near team mates most of the time or like staying injured, it will probably be a wasted perk slot.
---
Huntress, Wraith, and billy. All have there own strengths but i suggest wraith when you first start since he is easy to grasp
---
Unfortunately not, they were actually there for 90% of the game and hard to play against. Not to good to in the chase but sure quite good at applying pressure on the gens. (Know your kidding but kinda wanted to rant about this!)
---
Wait... There other guardians of the chest?
---
Look up TrU3Ta1ent ;)
---
Normally when people mention me on reddit, it has to do with something i said regarding my affinity for foot buggery. Take care of them feets in the fog, survivor sugarplums.
---
Was this a woooosh?
---
I main spirit and Ghost face they're relatively easy to learn
---
Nice bug abuse.
---
Ever roleplay?  Also, why wouldn't you be careful?
---
If you panic when you see the legion you need to get better at the game
---
Survivors flipping when you hit them from the front
---
You won’t be able to complete the challenges. If you don’t mind my asking, when does the rift end?
---
You are right. They still fuck a lot of things up, microtransactions got a lot higher priority this year and they removed the only content which changed a game a little bit(events)
---
Ah ok
---
Oh no it wasn't  hospital, it was coldwind but props to you for being nice
---
+ or - 6 ranks. Completely normal phenomenon.
---
It’s in the comments of this post
---
i’m new and Wraith seems really strong without having the full perk setups high ranking survivors have.
---
Like I genuinely feel when I’m playing him there was nothing the survivor could do to prevent the hits and its like a slow burn to win the match. 
---
When I’m survivor it’s so hard to see his little blurs and him being fast in cloak he can close any gap.
---
I had a match with a scrub that didn't know the killer's position determines the way you flop, *SO* I went between  him and the exit while he was tea bagging and hit him away from the exit. He did not flop out of the match and I hooked him dead.   
---
Really hope I blew his mind.
---
It means Larrys comin for them toes baby. The foot buggering boogey man is on the prowl and gonna suck them cuticles clean while they hang from a hook.
---
Devs can make a game mod for 1 april where the killers have different powers randomly. Imagine a leatherface is uncloaking and ringing a bell next to you.
---
Wouldn't call myself a futa lover but I dont mind it. I swear they only make it on that sub to try to bait negative comments because there is no way they are putting more than a few minutes of work into it
---
With great care my lord
---
What about bubba and freddy huh
---
Nope, nothing. The only real thing it does is match you with people that are closer to your rank (I believe it's by the average number based on what the survivors ranks are).
---
I would love that lol too bad they’re lazy :/
---
Thanks for your advice, I included it into my playstyle as much as possible and my kill rate (at rank 3) is 3.78 survivors/match now with those 3 killers :)
---
tHaTs JuSt WhAt A tOxIc SuRvIvOr WoUlD sAy
---
We got 3 years full of survivor nerfs. What are you doing when there is a nerf which effects every killer and not just one overpowered? Can‘t wait to see the meltdown.
---
Yeah I doubt that as well.
---
Nurse and ghostface/Myers.
---
Yeah I mean I farmed so much
---
Keep playing it cause it the only asymmetrical horror game that has any real support or player base. I hope for the day another much better handled game comes out, until then stuck with dbd being the only real option
---
"Easy mode". 
---
Bitch, please. Wraith sucked before his cube and he sucks now. Miss me with this hipster bullshit. Wraith needs help.
---
They more than often joke with you. The only exception is the perpetually offended people online
---
Also handicapped and disabled are different. One is mental the other is physical, ironic that you got it wrong really. Kinda ignorant ngl
---
Literally the only advantage he has over Billy is not stopping if he runs into something. And guess what billy gets? Zero cooldown on his power, which he can use from the beginning and doesnt have to worry about building or maintaining. Oh and Billy can curve which helps in loops while onis power can only land against a good survivor when you could have hit an m1 anyway.
---
But yeah onis power is totally better than Billy's lol
---
GGWP
---
As someone who mains Ash- he’s been doing very well with cosmetics since release. Myers/Laurie have been out since 2016 and just got stuff, and Quentin, Freddy and Leatherface are yet to have a single thing. Let’s give the other licensed boys a bit of attention, I say.
---
Probably Huntress, though I try to play a bit of everyone.
---
As you said camping happens a lot more often in low ranks because a lot of new killers don’t know any better. I think it kinda also comes down that the in game tutorial treats kills as the most important thing.
---
Lots of new killers simply don’t understand that you get much more out of hooking several survivors several times than camping someone till death.
---
When the game treats kills so importantly rather than the actual hooks then ofc new killers are gonna protect their prey instead.
---
A better tutorial could help this problem slightly
---
Can’t dc either what a world
---
Freddy is super strong right now
---
So what if I have to repair generators?
---
What in hell are you talking about? People farm all the time. I almost always help the last survivor escape. You're not "nieve" enough to believe in a thing that is very common? 
---
Like he said, you pretended to farm for an easy win. It's unsportsmanlike at least, and I'm pretty sure that's all he claimed.
---
what am i looking at?
---
One nerf to a killer affects one killer. One nerf to survivors affect all survivors. Do you want for every killer nerf which affects just one killer a survivor nerf which affects every survivor? Well, take out the wheelchair, boys - 70% killrate isn‘t enough!
---
We’re you in this game?
---
Basement guardian?
---
No
---
it is a bad player. someone who is sitting at rank 17 with ruin is bad
---
Wraith with ruin, Thana , sloppy and nurses . I'm at rank 1 and have never de-pipped with this build . Add-ons either both windstorm or one windstorm and any add-on which changes the  bell
---
Ophidiophobia is a really far fetched thing for them to add, and Trypophobia is TOO negative. Besides that I really like this idea!
---
Because the game is still survivor sided and anyone with a brain can tell you that.
---
If you run a 4 man SWF I see no reason for you to not win *100%* of your matches unless you majorly screw up.
---
You can still do the challenges, but you won’t get rift fragments since the rift will be closed. You’ll just get bp and lore
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUaevkSGKZ0)
---
David would beat the killers ass don’t @ me
---
Think licenses. I don’t think the owners of A Nightmare on Elm Street want Freddy Krueger to to puke all over people and whack people with an incense burner.
---
Source?
---
I’ve had this occur in every other Nurse game as well. Whenever I hook someone I get the same effect and they won’t die.
---
Your askin the wrong person, I didn’t code it. It used to be all quits deranked you but then they tried to make it so can’t derank below 16 so noobs wouldn’t just get steamrolled. I think they messed up somewhere and it only works if you ‘leave game’. Dunno for sure since I’m not staff. 
---
Back when there were automatic bans for DC if you DC any other way then ‘leave game’ it wouldn’t count as a DC so you wouldn’t get auto banned. I’m sure it’s the same problem that causes this. Just one of the many many many bugs this game has.
---
Claudette has a bikini skin?
---
Clown is my personal favorite, he closes chases really well and I use perk builds that show me where the survivors are. I also enjoy playing Freddy because he can play fun mind games on the poor survivors
---
Has everyone seen this video, or is this just a meme in the community in general.
---
You know what I think you’re right. Especially shirtless David cause he be ready🥵

Fiancee: I thought you uninstalled that game?
---
Me: uh huh, I did.
---
Fiancee: so......I don't understand you, dude.
---
Me: it'll probably happen again.
---
Fiancee: hmmm.
---
Me: *if you only knew, babe.*
---
Currently on my third reinstall of Dbd.
---
Thank you for this.
---
I had this happen to me with an Oni, except he hit me through the corner when I 360’d him after he used his power surge through 2 different pallets 😞
---
Like I said before. It's great you have confidence.  Even if you're not that great at evaluating percentages.
---
Nancy has 2 good perks. Inner strength and fixated.
---
What you are describing is a skill.
---
This has nothing to do with camping the pallet? They can just run around. Do you remember all the corner pallets on the demogoron map?
---
If the stun with a pallet is the only way to use these pallet than this ist just another hit in the face for newbies.
---
If you take a godly Clown player and a trash Spirit one and toss them in a red rank match, the Clown will 4k and the Spirit will struggle to go above 0k/1k, regardless of the fact that Clown is at rock bottom when it comes to viability and Spirit is at the top. At the end of the day, the only thing that actually makes a killer viable or not is the skill of the guy playing him.
---
the actual use of his power is better than Hillbilly, the balance of it comes from the parts in between of having to charge it up and it's limited use. Also Oni doesn't become completely fucked by indoor maps like Hillbilly either due to having no bump penalty.
---
so yea, Oni's power is better than Hillbilly. There's argument on which killer is overall better, and I would still honestly say overall Hillbilly is the more reliable choice still, but Oni is still actually a good killer.
---
  Killer perks will always be stronger than survivor perks on a 1 for 1 basis because this isn't a fucking 1 v 1 game. Considering that the game has a built in counter to BBQ, imma need you to stop bitching about this.
---
The worst part is he glitched out early on, he has like maybe 5000 points if he escapes. Meanwhile I have around 30,000. And he refuses to restart his game for 5000 points. I’m getting so sick of this community.
---
Tru3 is good at making a point and then backing it up with TONS of proof but just because he is good with him doesn't mean everyone else will be. Im god awful with Billy but amazing with every other killer and im at red ranks so to each their own yunno?
---
She had corrupt purge, doesn’t infect objects.
---
They both are garbage but Clown is worse. He’s just a worse Freddy.
---
Luckily I got an entitled survivor that refuses to DC because of 5000 points
---
This is why I love playing the hag, she alone doesn’t look scary but you can’t tell me you haven’t shit your pants when you unknowingly ran over a trap
---
*eurobeat intensifies*
---
This opinion is about as unpopular as the ones on /unpopular opinions.
---
Not unpopular.
---
holy hell i smoke too much herb cuz i don't even remember making this post...like at all....trippy
---
“gg piece of shit”
---
I'm pretty new, started playing killer a lot recently and it felt pretty easy at first... then I hit rank 12 and it became a nightmare. I don't have meta perks so games are already tough, but when I actually do well people DC or suicide on first hook. I accept that skilled survivors with meta perks are gonna poot on me most of the time, but it's *extremely* frustrating when they just DC because I actually made a good play early in the game.
---
They're  just losers looking for excuses. Just like survivors who will say you "tunneled" their whole team. No matter the game, losers will always be fucking losers.
---
Oh, I’m looking at the metrics and I’m quite justifiably pleased at which way the data points, tyvm
---
Scum! He said not to tell!
---
Very fair point! I can imagine a lot of people having trouble with S tier killers like nurse because they can't control or mind game so well
---
First might have been a crash if it was that fast.
---
Pretty much every killer in the game needs to rely on a survivor fucking up in some way, and then capitalizing on said fuckup in order to get a hit in. Survivors at low ranks will fuck up often, and as such, Killers aren't gonna have too much trouble landing hits and ending chases. In high ranks, since survivors will make far less mistakes, it's a completely different story.
---
Nobody above rank 20 does that. I'm in purple ranks, have never played Trapper (Though he is leveled) and got the 6 traps in one game on my second try.
---
Tbh I think Legion is worse in my experience. I escape red rank legions 99% of the time. A red rank clown is tough because they know when to slow you down on loops with the bottles. 
---
Like when I see its legion I’m like ‘oh it’s legion😁’ and am happy? Shouldn’t be like that, poor stabby gang 🥴
---
She's still the strongest killer in the game but feels clunky to play. I maimed her for years and had to put her down for good because of it.
---
i've been shown the light, slurs are cool actually. is this the power of being a gamer?
---
Bubba has the survivor faces
---
He is top tier though. If you play the loop game, you lose. Wraith has enough speed and stealth to make hits and patrol gens. I get 3-4 kills with merciless killer nearly all games against all kind of survivors.( top tier swf players as well).
---
Honestly, I agree if you are immersed doing gens while the killer is chasing someone then it's fine. But if you are crouch walking while I'm busting my ass around when you can just sprint to another gen, I'd be a tiny salty.
---
I hope Quentin gets a face rework
---
Spirit 😈everyone will hate you but she is so much fun
---
How do I obtain the locked faces for Cannibal?
---
And they also break the pallets they vault. 
---
Kind of an important to know.
---
I made it all the way to the 4th survivor challenge "complete 4 gens with dark sense in a single trail".  It really made the game extremely unfun so I wont be putting any time into it for a while
---
This is the most accurate comment in the thread. This is the underlying core issue with the game. The only reason it’s possible to win as a non top tier killer in red ranks is because there are plenty of potato survivors mixed with the good ones. If you get 4 survivors who are actually decent and are committed to beating the killer without screwing around, it’s 100% GG in short order.
---
So I’m fairly new to the game and I have a few questions, 
---
1) is the rift worth it at this point? Is it possible to unlock everything in the rift it should I hold out until the next one?
---
2) how do the blood webs work level 10 and up? I’ve seen some game play but I’m not sure how to block the entity and juke it out like they can. It’s on trapper, if that changes anything.
---
Thanks in advance and I’m really happy to finally be a part of this community 😊
---
I always do amazing with hag on it
---
Still shitty that challenges like these force survivors to take themselves out of the match.
---
Google what Oni actually look like in Japanese foklore. His pauldrons are actually in line with that.
---
They better not touch my zappy boi...I dont want to be t bagged by a bunch of claudettes..

I think you have to mori or sacrifice a specific amount (25) of the base characters (Dwight, Meg, Claudette, etc.) to get each face
---
I think you need to to take it easy brother. It's a video game.
---
I played a Spirit game earlier today and I had the speed boost. I was using the green add-on that slightly increases speed while coming out of phase, so it was fairly noticeable.
---
I'm glad you're happy.
---
im a killer main and all my dailies are for killers, so i dunno where youre getting this metric from
---
It’s boring, as has been said, but I’m obviously ok with it when there’s double bp and/or bp offerings of in cases where someone’s really screwed over
---
It’s goood that’s what it is
---
I’ve been doing really well lately.  My mood has been great!
---
I’ve farmed for the 2nd half of challenges. Also every time uses this format, we should just make Ash sit in the chair

In October, Houser stated that the team had been working 100-hour weeks "several times in 2018".[30] Many sources interpreted this statement as "crunch time" for the entire development staff of the game, comparable to similar accusations made by wives of Rockstar San Diego employees in regards to the development of the game's predecessor, with Rockstar Games receiving strong criticism.[139] The following day, Rockstar clarified in a statement that the work duration mentioned by Houser only affected the senior writing staff for Red Dead Redemption 2, which comprised himself, Michael Unsworth, Rupert Humphries and Lazlow Jones, and that the duration had only been the case for three weeks during the entire development.[140] Houser also added that the company would never expect or force any employee to work as long as was stated, and if anyone was staying late at the development studios, it would be due to their passion for the project.[141][142] However, other Rockstar employees argued that Houser's statements did not give an accurate picture of the "crunch-time culture" at the company that many of its employees worked under, which included "mandatory" overtime and years-long periods of crunch. Due to the salary-based nature of employment contracts, many of these employees were not compensated for their overtime work and instead depended on year-end bonus payments that hinged on the sales performance of the game. Nonetheless, a sentiment echoed across many employee statements was the observation that working conditions had somewhat improved since development on the original Red Dead Redemption, which had been so demanding that a number of the developers' spouses had voiced their disapproval to Rockstar.[143][144]

In early November 2018, YouTuber Shirrako posted several videos of his player character murdering a female suffragette NPC, including feeding her to an alligator and dropping her down a mineshaft. The videos were both applauded and criticized by YouTube users. In response, YouTube suspended the channel for violation of their community guidelines, citing its graphic nature for shock purposes and for promoting violence.[145] Audiences, including other channels, protested the decision. Conversely, the channel had also published additional videos of similar actions to other non-playable characters, such as those from the Ku Klux Klan.[146] On November 8, 2018, YouTube restored the channel and designated an age restriction to the suffragette videos, commenting that "the reviewer will be educated on this outcome and on how to avoid repeating this mistake".[147]

Rockstar received a cease and desist notice from Securitas AB, the parent company of the modern-day Pinkerton National Detective Agency. Securitas asserted that Red Dead Redemption 2's use of the Pinkerton name and badge imagery was against their trademark of both marks, and demanded royalties for each copy of the game sold or that they would take legal action. Rockstar instead filed a complaint against Securitas in January 2019, asserting that the Pinkerton name was strongly associated with the Wild West, and their use of the term did not infringe on the Pinkerton trademark. Rockstar was seeking a summary judgment to declare the use of Pinkerton in the game as allowed fair use.[148] By April 2019, Take-Two, Rockstar, and Securitas agreed to an undisclosed settlement, with Securitas subsequently dismissing the lawsuit.[149]

Its a bug. The trap on his foot actually is not there in that spot, its elsewhere and the visual you see part of the animation. The unsprung trap you see is actually there.
---
What happens is you step on a trap, but instead of *that* trap triggering, another nearbye trap triggers, snap shuts, and is reset. Since the trap you are still standing on was not the one that was reset, it is still active, you are not immune to it and it fires again, causing the infinite loop.
---
Downvote because swf
---
Yes but if you make it harder for low ranks then you alienate new players, which is the issue.
---
I don't know why you're a colossal asshole about this but okay
---
^this exactly. I'm gonna go were the easiest to down survivors go. At that point in the game I know ur going for an unhook. It's always interesting when survivors try to "leash" me like a jungle boss and I just turn around and catch their friend who's trying to get a save. I've 4Ked that way a few times. Do they not think killer is another player?
---
Oh it was wretched, I got no points a de-pipped.
---
I suppose they gave him a camera because it made more sense with his lore and add-ons. 
---
Being a journalist it makes sense that he will use a camera for photos as opposed to using a flip phone. 
---
Many of his add-ons are based around modifications to a camera and including 'Philly' - Brown camera add-on - which seems to be the camera in the mori I suppose BHVR decided to make the choice of just changing the phone to a camera.
---
They all wanna hug Susie but nobody gives my boy Joey any love
---
Yeah I do remember it and do you know why huntress mains bitched?
---
Her hatchets literally went through survivors consistently. She was unplayable until the time they reverted it.
---
Look up videos on it and its pretty clear
---
Although if you use it from a bit further away and run at someone, they won't know since there's no change in terror radius. If there's always a terror radius, there's never a terror radius, if you catch my drift.
---
purple rank was the surv party’s leader
---
*Lairy
---
I get do get what you mean but dead by daylight is unique. It's not like other games where it's just a plain old simple game of cat and mouse. The survivor needs to strategise and adapt to their surroundings and the killer needs to adapt to the survivors they are going against. If one side cant di that then the game is won by the opposite side. The perfect example of this is this post.
---
The nurse didnt adapt to the survivors and lost for that reason. And the survivors adapted to block the nurse because that's how they adapted aswell.
---
This like the basement and 4 gens with dark sense if it was allowed over multiple trials than it wouldn't as been as bad hell increase the amount to complete it too just to add a bit of challenge to them instead of being done in four games if lucky
---
Something tells me most were born in the 2000s
---
If it helps you any (and you have a survivor with all perks) I did this challenge by running TINH/Resilience/No Mither/Decisive Strike
---
I got it in one game with this and had fun doing a totally alternate build for a change. Just chunk out gens and you'll hopefully get it before killer even sees you, and you've got D strike in case killer wants to be that asshole who bullies the no mither guy
---
Franks Mixtape drains the survivors deep wound bar by 25% per hit after you inflict deep wound on a survivor. 
---
Basically put if you hit a survivor who is afflicted by deep wound 4 times with Frenzy they will instantly go down. 
---
Useless add-on really but I suppose its better useless than being OP such as it was prior to the Legion rework.
---
Yeah i hated grinding out the archives and finishing all the challenges. 
---
Gross as they were, the killer ones weren’t as bad because killer queues are way faster and you get way more opportunities to complete challenges in a game as killer. 
---
Survivor ones though, they were the worst. Not only were queues like 15 minutes, but almost all the survivors i came across had the same mentality (myself included): throw the game and just focus on some obscure secondary objective. Gens didn’t get done because why do the objective when you have 10 chests to loot? Why bother progressing the game when you can just follow the killer around trying to get flashlight blinds. 
---
Keeping track of my games, at one point i was 1 escape from 15 games. From teammates letting me die on first hook so they can do their challenges to killers doing their own challenge grinds. The game just hasn’t been fun.

Yea, I play killer because my queue times are instant compared to 5 minutes long and I hardly get survivor dailies.

Killer loading times are fast wdym

---
It’s not entirely just a plain bikini
---
Entirely depends on the context tbh
---
Though it's kinda funny how the only ignorant one here is the person virtue signaling like its Twitter lol
---
i wish this were the case, im working on the “get 20 gold emblems or higher” challenge right now and it makes me really wish i could be doing other challenges in game along side it
---
[r/Oinkers\_](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oinkers_/) Sorry wrong format
---
Ok
---
It was a bugged caused by the Devs changing the Spirits post phase speed boost when they nerfed spirit. 
---
It should be resolved relatively soon after the devs return from their holidays.
---
The Spirit post speed boost was nerfed to progressively slow down as opposed to a constant speed boost that stops immediately.
---
One change I was thinking was that you don’t have to select challenges but instead you can multitask so the grind isn’t as tedious.
---
You can exxagerate more, or you can understand how statistics work and take a rational look as to why a few stats without context and many other details might not paint a realistic picture. 
---
Literally even the devs told you to take them with a grain of salt. This is stats 101.
---
try uninstalling then reinstalling it
---
Ok? Or they down rank on purpose. Or have rank reset twice. Either way it creates an incredibly unfair situation and it happened over and over these past two days.
---
The tome 4 survivor challenges are easy. The only one that could cause trouble is the "finish 4 generators with dark sense", that that is easily obtainable with a 4-man where your teammates 99 gens
---
This man is bad with pallet management is NOT afraid to show it.
---
If you plan on doing a healer build yes but otherwise no
---
I enjoy playing as spirit but Ik she’s broken and bullshit at times, so I don’t wanna put people through it lol
---
Nice, this would be cool
---
Of course. It's strange though. I had a Legion daily (P2-1) only running Discordance and the first time I downed a survivor they just DCd. Same happened to the second guy I downed a gen later.
---
Third rework legion was deleted for too much underperformance at red ranks
---
Ohh... I know which one it is.
---
No, it's a Nea main.
---
Replace streetwise and you can only use that one perk

It’s a Freddy add-on, one of the the advantages of the addon is that it caused healthy bleeding.
---
Yeah, I don't even wait that long. I leavs around the last 25%
---
Then start streaming mate. Nobody's stopping you
---
That’s great! I joined to find people to do SWF but it was NOT worth it lol.
---
I think the build is strong, but I don't think Wraith as a whole is a top tier killer. At the very least, I would put Wraith solidly in the mid tier.
---
Yeah, i don't care if survivors are teabagging, but why do it? "Oh no, you hit spacebar on a pallet and i got hit! Dang you really out played me with that basic gameplay device that is the only way to slow down the killer. Darn, you are obviously the best."
---
I never said anything about nerfing survivors. I just think nerfing viable killers just to make the game more accessible to newcomers or because it's "not fun" for survivors isn't the best way to balance the game. Also if the matchmaking system worked better this wouldn't even be an issue but here we are.
---
OMFG
---
Anytime Oni-chan goes bam bam mode I get s-so... excited *blushes*
---
No. This sub just loves it's overuse of shitty memes and over-exaggerations
---
Depends on whether they have add-ons or not.
---
If we are talking no add-ons then the Clown is worse. The slow-down will usually result in survivors throwing pallets early as opposed to being caught off guard. He shortens loops but does not stop them at base. 
---
Legion on the other hand has a power that can atleast injure every survivor meaning if they make any mistake they can be downed instantly for it. Having all survivors injured can also allow the Legion to snowball immensely if he starts slugging.
---
With add-ons however, Legion is worse.
---
Clown using Flask Of bleach and the Ether bottle allows for his slow-down to catch survivors out of loops and allows him to end-chases decently quick if the Clown knows how to throw bottles properly.
---
Legion on the other hand has barely any add-ons worth running and none really change his power meaning he dosent really change at all. The only good add-ons he actually has are the duration extension add-ons, the ultra-rares and his green button add-on.
---
Yeah, I had a match where the entire survivor team was the same rank as me. And to be clear I mean their ranks combined where the same as mine. 4 Rank 2s Vs a Rank 8 Killer.
---
r/cursedimages
---
To add to this: You gain this effect when interacting with a dream snare or dream pallet.
---
how do you think i got through a lot of them?
---
That makes sense, I tend to forget it’s original and not based off of the movies. Thanks for the response.
---
That removes the whole point of putting yourself in danger for other survivors, it’s in a good position as it is right now
---
The only time I’ve seen a streamer dc is when otz did a meme build with monstrous shrine, hooked everyone in the basement, said something like enjoy you’re 15 percent less chance of escaping and the one of them 4%’d
---
8 days i think?
---
Basement should have 2 entrances, it's the 1 way in and out that makes it cancer
---
Thank you
---
I dont understand stand it. Not only is legion a m1 killer but his power can not work in a chase at all. Running literally stops it from working
---
David’s moans and grunts are hot tho
---
I have some ideas:   
---
**Autophobia**: Fear of being alone. When you are not within 8 meters of another survivor, action speed is decreased by 10%.  
---
**Acrophobia**: Fear of heights. While falling from a height, you scream, revealing your location to the killer.  
---
**Hemophobia**: Fear of blood. When injured or dying, your cries are 5% louder. If you are within 8 meters of an injured or dying survivor, you also begin to cry.  
---
**Atychiphobia**: Fear of failure. Skill checks are 15% smaller. Failing a skillcheck causes 3% more regression than normal.
---
**Hypochondria**: Fear of illness. Negative status effects last 25% longer and are 5% more effective against you.  
---
**Noctiphobia**: Fear of the night. Your field of view is 15 degrees thinner than normal.
---
Yes, any stalk down with ghostface is obviously no skill.
---

---
He's actually very bad at providing non anecdotal evidence, then supports his claims with said anecdotal evidence.
---
I’m guessing with Haddonfield being a licensed property it will take longer as they may need approval for the maps and they also want to make sure nothing is out of place. Where the hospital is all original.just a guess though.

I hid in a locker for like 30 seconds until the terror radius just stopped I was so confused

His whole reason for being makes me sad. I suppose I always play the support role in games and you know healers in MMOs and what not get ignored until someone doesn't think you're doing your job properly but it's the DPS and tanks that claim the win when it all goes right.
---
The support classes are the invisible... the ridiculed... the forgotten... that's our dwight... 😥
---
star wars community is the worse
---
I can understand that he is annoying to play against because he gets free first hits, tracking with FF, and drags the game experience down with his only viable builds (Forever Legion). I didn't even have Ruin or Thanat, it should have been an easy game for them.
---
It's also slightly annoying having to either play one shot or heal all the time (Plague?) but nobody complains about Plague.
---
Who is wraith? I only know bing-bong man

DS is not toxic.
---
Well idk, whenever I watch him I see the point he is trying to make very clearly.
---
This has been me all week
---
Couldn’t disagree more, one of my favourite maps for both sides, unless I’m playing billy
---
I feel like the challenges would be way more enjoyable if we didn't have to commit to a single one of them at any time. DBD runs on RNG and adaptability, so introducing a challenges system that locks you into playing in one very hyper specific way is very disjointed from the core gameplay, and would be hugely lessened if you could make simultaneous progress on any branch of all the trees.
---
Glad you liked it

Imagine actually playing video games with your friends
---
I am saying that the character in the game is not a character from any of the films or the TV series, is in no way related to any of the films or TV series, and is legally a completely distinct entity with no relation to anything from the **Scream** franchise.  It is just a guy wearing a similar mask and suit to a popular character, it is legally not said popular character.  It is basically the same as how we originally had "Hillbilly" as a Leatherface stand in because they couldn't get the rights to the real character.  Then they did get the rights and now we have both a "legally not Bubba" and "Bubba".
---
Disagree. They force toxicity and DC's.
---
goose said legion was the worst killer acording to this video  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCl7kmTia6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCl7kmTia6A) 
---
idk if he changed his mind.
---
i dont even have clown, but it looks a little boring to me, also isnt he supposed to shut down loops and end chases quick? yet i have looped clown for ages and im not a good looper at all, so i think clown is worst, its just my personal opinion, but i really love legion so maybe im biased for that.
---
Get serv’d lol jk
---
Get mcote’d.
---
\*taking notes\*
---
legion and spirit, they are both superfun, anyways survivors hate rin and some of them also dont like going against legion so maybe its not what u are lookin for
---
Doin gens you??
---
;( i can do gens
---
Switch to switch! (pun intended) there is no afrer game chat!
---
Oof, that does sound painful.
---
Sloppy butcher, knockout, nurse's calling, and coulraphobia

---
You'll be glad to hear that The Archive is eternal - you'll always have the ability to attempt them to unlock the lore at your own pace. The only time-limited portion is The Rift and therefore the Rift Fragment rewards from The Archive Challenges will also go away, but the BP rewards and Lore is eternal.
---
Still, it does feel like if you want to complete The Rift, you're pigeonholed into grinding out The Archive ASAP or else buy the tiers, which is probably by design.
---
This is actually fucking terrifying
---
Aha, I play PS4 and there’s no after game chat there, either. Instead, people will just directly message you to insult you lol
---
Yeah but those are the times you would hit a great hatchet yet the game registers it as a miss even though it goes through the survivors body because the hatchets were completely dog shit :(
---
Once agian, non of this on the switch
---
It's certainly possible to make him stronger and less annoying. They aren't mutually exclusive.
---
This is the correct fix, imo
---
Ah, that’s good at least
---
Survivor rank 3 killer rank 7. This was recorded around rank 9-12 tho.
---
If you wanna farm go ahead idc, although if i cooperate depends on what i need to do, for instance if i need to do gens for a challenge i assure you, i wont be farming + if i remember correctly if people are farming and not everyone in match agree with that its bannable
---
Yeah but sometimes It hurts.
---
When I look at ur maxed out perks I guess ur not a nooby lol would be nice to see a 4k
---
That's why they picked it. They said the reason they're changing Doc is because he's the most annoying to play against.
---
My point is it's not Ghostface.  It's a guy who kinda looks like it.  It's not a character from any of the films or the TV series, he is in no way related to any of the films or TV series, and he is legally a completely distinct entity with no relation to anything from the **Scream** franchise.  It is just a guy wearing a similar mask and costume and holding a similar weapon to an iconic character, it is legally not said character.  It is basically the same as how we originally had "Hillbilly" as a Leatherface stand in because they couldn't get the rights to the real character.  Then they did get the rights and now we have both a "legally not Bubba" and "Bubba".  The Ghost Face^tm is legally not the Ghostface that we know, it's just a guy who looks like him/her/them.
---
Is that what she looks like bloodied?
---
Irl community is the worst
---
Id feel bad for the survivors on your rank with this build
---
The rift is such a grind and a pain in the ass to level up for anyone who wants to play other games and not just solely dead by daylight.
---
Not to mention the fact that it makes matches less fun as a result. People are throwing matches regularly just to try and get archive challenges done. Most of my matches are now either Farmers, toxic sweaty survivors, or killers that camp and run NoED. The archives are good in theory but the way they are now is just making the game even more frustrating an unplayable. Especially the challenges that must be completed in a single trial, or make you do an oddly specific thing, or running specific perk that is garbage and as a result will cause you to throw the match to get a challenge. I don't want to have to let the survivors do generators so I can kill them with no one escapes death. After the gate is open, if I down one, the other will probably just leave. Why can't I just get a 4K before all the generators are done? Why are these challenges so luck based? I've been struggling to unhook somebody during the end game collapse for a week now. Either a team mate instantly nab's them, or we all get out. And thankfully due to being stuck on this one... I can't get any other challenges done. Since we can't do multiple at a time and have to do them in a certain order. It seems like I always do the hardest ones on accident when I don't have them equipped, and then I will never be able to do them when I'm actually pursuing them.
---
Honestly fuck the archives. They made this game way more toxic than it was
---
if you’re on pc I managed to find a lobby of good samaritans and after asking them nicely they 99’d some gens for me
---
I had 3 done and there was only one left so I’m sweating bullets when all of a sudden Yui comes over gesturing me to come with her
---
I follow her and there’s Claudette pointing at a 99% gen
---
It was beautiful I almost cried
---
Mr long-dong
---
Most players aren't 4 man SWF so it's not really accurate to act like thats how to determine if the game is survivor sided or not
---
Plague, doctor, myers literally able to just kill you out of nowhere
---
Wow, I really love it! Can you make more?
---
wait what killer is this, and how long can you do that. That’s insane one shot map pressure.
---
I did six feet under in a single game no camp no tunnelling the trick is to have very altruistic survivors
---
You have around 20 seconds to end a chase early game other wise 3 gens will pop
---
He doesn't have to be one singular Ghost face from the Scream series. You realize plenty of different people have been Ghostface, right? That's why our Ghostface being someone new makes complete sense. Theres only one Michael Myers, but there's tons of Ghost faces. DBD ghostface is completely true to the character.
---
Danny Johnson: *Patrick Star voice* f o c u s i n g
---
Please stop stalking me with those eyes or you will get to tier 3 like myers
---
The Hillbilly. You can chainsaw sprint till you run into something like that Yui lol. Then you just charge up your chainsaw again and go.
---
Low A have to be good at pallet mindgames but then you can dominate
---
But those are default like why don’t we give him a tuxedo and stuff like in the movies bill i understand cause he only had the one
---
His rework is actually pretty good from what a leaker found
---
Thank god I'm a 93 kid. No other meme hit me like this did. I'm just a claudette main for her survival boosts. I wanna loot chests I cant flashlight!
---
Isnt that what got fixed a little while ago?
---
What about Michael?
---
I hope so. I still wanna zap some people. But I also want it to be balanced.
---
Wait. Your killer queue times are instant? What?!?!? Killer queue times for me take forever
---
Totally agree. I love the rift, and have very few complaints, but I cant play EVERYDAY. Maybe just a teeny adjustment?
---
It’s Freddy’s Z Block add-on. After interacting with a snare or pallet, you’ll receive the Hemorrhage effect for 60 seconds. The bleeding will only stop when the timer runs out, meaning that you can bleed while fully healed.
---
This my only grief with haddonfield now is the damned fences
---
 When I see these little virgins t bagging in game, if the exit gates open I won’t even bother to go over. That annoys them more that they don’t get their 5 seconds of trolling.
---
You will we get a new effect with one of the add ons that causes the skill check counter to go the other way
---
That feelingwhen you are a rank 18 killer andthe game puts you into a lobby in which all people have ranks from 1-11. I got DS on rank 18... I was annoyed by the t baggers...
---
So. Fucking. Satisfying.
---
Then I need to get way fucking better. Ugh.
---
I can press the button, count to 10, and I'll be in a game. I press the survivor button and I can start my laundry, start making food, tidy up a bit, look at some memes, and 9/10 I'm still searching (that's about 4 minutes)
---
I’m a 93 bb Claudie main xoxo 💋
---
Yeah if they dont teabag you at any good occasion and blind you through a fckin wall (it happens many times on red forest maps but you know, devs gotta make more money and skins, most of them used by noone xD) and some may say, its not toxic to flashlight save through a wall and abuse this bug, but expect tunneling lol
---
... ok one of the most balanced killers
---
You have the second person you hooked in the basement dc after hooking her?? If so it was you that got me as the 3rd person hooked in the basement, I just wanted my unhooks
---
Now that's what I call Devour Hope
---
The changes to doctor raise the skill ceiling from B1 level. Idk how you would think it's about survivors, when it's obvious it's about killer players. He is underrepresented because of his poor base kit. 
---
Making his shock a bit bigger so he isn't relying on add ons to use his total power, and adding in new abilities like the Iri Queen bring him in line with other killers. More consistent, and able to bring in new ways to torture people.
---
Oh that sounds nice. Cant wait to see all the generators fail. Or when I'm survivor cant wait to chase a doctor around and let my team do the gens.
---
Seriously? I’m the opposite. Survivors wait times are instant but killer wait times are long
---
Exactamundo! Genuinely think increasing the XP and amount of fragments you receive, or reducing the XP required to gain 1 fragment would be enough of a tweak!
---
That or they just lower the amount of tiers overall. Seeing as the next one won't have putrid serum vials, it's possible. Unlikely but not too crazy a thought...
---
Epic
---
Like you can’t hear the fucking generator? Come on “accidentally”....
---
True, I had forgotten that the vials will be gone. I wonder what they’ll replace them with - if anything
---
I think so too. I get that map a very disproportionate amount.
---
Switch the gas dispensers with the ability to pour a standard tonic into the intake of a generator making the generator exhaust toxic fumes similar to how the plague can infect generators
---
The survivors will have to forcibly intoxicate themselves to repair the generator for 10% progression to stop the fumes.
---
Exactly lol
---
you mean the one that got removed? There are like 2 left, and the "infinite" one is removed (at least I have not seen it spawn anymore)
---
Monto opened up a Vietnamese bar, nice.
---
I remember when i was called a noob after getting a 4k with 3 gens still intact xD, awesome times (no mori)
---
so no cool down, free directional control, infinite speed, one shot. What is the downside this sounds busted on paper. You telling me you just Tokyo Drift on squads and sac em.
---
My name is literally sock sea man .. so when u said jerk off in a sock ... it.. it hit home
---
Nothing wrong here
---
I thought dev stats showed all indoor maps were killer-sided? Could be remembering wrong
---
Who needs balanced landing when you can f l y
---
It's also amazing for Pig, especially if you brought Amanda's Letter. She's borderline OP with that setup on this map. Generally though, i'd say it's pretty killer-sided, since the only killers who will outright suffer on this map are Nurse, Huntress and Billy, while everyone else benefits a lot from all the LOS blockers and randomly generated loops, as well as the relatively few safe pallets.
---
I was like... 0-0 I'm usually the only one who escapes
---
Don’t kink shame ://
---
Where is it on the stream?
---
Likely more charms.
---
Think of the Rift Pass like Christmas Day:
---
Your character cosmetics will be your main presents, Auric Cells will be the money and vouchers, and then the charms will be the 'stocking stuffers' 😂
---
Not against the charms at all, though! I'm a sucker for personalisation, haha!
---
Doin da hopskies over they pallets
---
Cruel limits still isn't worth a slot since it doesn't block pallets
---
You know, if only for instance clown wasnt so shitted in most of the time without mori, + surv typing after match that you are trash then maybe there would be a lot bigger variety of killer
---
Its my sense of accomplishment
---
I think it depends on ranks and where u play
---
Survivor red rank omg Xbox 5-10 min
---
Killer red rank on Xbox 30sec-2min
---
But I’ve heard on pc it’s reversed probably bc it’s a lot harder for killers and harder means less fun
---
Or just learn that flashing lights indicate there's a Gen there.
---
No. Before when you first set a trap if you ran over it within a second or two it triggered, which it shouldnt. I'm guessing that fix broke this.
---
They have the rights to the appearance, easily the most important aspect. The DbD character is wearing *the* Ghost Face mask (which the TV character doesn't btw). In the movies, Ghostface is whoever is wearing the mask. It's an identity rather than a single person. That allows them to make a unique backstory anyway.
---
More charms is fine by me. I wonder which characters will be the focus of the next one?
---
Yeah no, I didn't buy the pass, I might check out next one or not.
---
Holy shit this a good idea
---
Yeah its funny how badly they respect pallets and expect you to stay at them, so even a simple loop around a car become an infinite occasionally xD
---
Cant have everyone doing too much at once then the servers crash lol
---
That's not how it's supposed to work anymore. Unless they changed it back? But bc of long queue times ranks 16-20 can play with any rank.
---
what makes his proof anymore reliable than another?
---
He can post nonstop clips of him winning as Wraith just as much as anyone else can post clips of them destroying a Wraith.
---
The first frenzy rework actually had the speed nerfed actually
---
idk why you’re getting downvoted you’re spitting facts

Hmm. Ive seen where i stepped in one i set and it changes position, but when it gets opened it teleports back and im good
---
30 seconds is going to be pushing it - if you haven't nailed someone with Bloodlust then there's better things you can be doing, considering a gen can be done in 44 seconds.
---
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5uUUAz7m1U) some top-end snare play against the hardest survivors you're likely to see - compare and contrast against how you're using snares.
---
On the other hand, if I’m billy I cry.
---
Mori
---
most of the challenges r good n u jus get them done by playing bt the finish in 1 trial ones suck
---
I hope my boy Jake and Wraith get the spotlight next.
---
But something tells me it'll be either Meg or Dwight, and probably Hillbilly.
---
Still, they put in a decent Jake cosmetic set and that precious Hillbilly shotgun in the current pass so even if my wanted characters don't get the focus, they could still get some sexy cosmetics!
---
Who do you want?
---
Ok that’s cool. Now do the demogorgon :)
---
That's because they are one of the few, if not the only company that does not allow overtime.
---
Yes players get the content a bit delayed but as a video game developper I can say that their way is the way to go. No more burnout and 80 hours weeks during crunch time. This should be the standard, not the Fornite one where employees leaves the room and you never see them again because they have to produce constant content.
---
I agree, now you have to at least understand basic, instead of just spaming those blinks, although its funny when nurse chases me for few minutes and my team does nothing and after match when asked what they were doing i get standard answer; gens, you? XDD sry had to complain somewhere
---
 Can I ask what rank your at? I’m currently 14/15 and I normally go into a game pretty quickly, i.e. usually around 5 mins. I always worry that if you go higher up the ranks it’s harder to find matches

nothing stopping u going from the thread
---
I was expecting “Is that a hentie?”
---
This is literally me
---
Well he live streams the proof too so you see it in action, he played a bunch of games doing really well with wraith too. Goose is on like a 120 4k streak with Plague but a lot of people say Plague is low tier. My point is exactly what I said in my intial comment. I never said his proof was any more reliable or any less than anyone else's.
---
This comment hit me like a sack of bricks
---
On console she garbage
---
I main Billy because while his power is pretty basic, it's very fun to use and it can cover a wide variety of situations.  Billy's power also can change the tide of a game rather quickly.  With his speed he can also make good use of information perks.    
---
To summarize
---
Fun: Check
---
Powerful (When Experienced): Check
---
Utility: Check
---
Do Survivors Hate You: Most don't, but the ones who do probably don't know how to deal with him.  Very counterable.  
---
Just got my Adept Hillbilly today, infact
---
Pretty early on in the qa after the general discussion.
---
like the addon that makes her main feature become shit that will guarantee changing how u play her but after 250 hours on her I am all for deleting this hoe just a broken OP killer
---
Its been awhile for me as well but the infinite one is gone to my knowledge as well
---
I really like the seeing others as the clown part lmao. Imagine 4 Clowns chasing after you in a custom match.
---
I love Ormond more than Haddonfield. Now on Haddonfield if I'm drunk I might try to jump through a closed window, but Ormond you are getting smacked by a pallet even if I'm intoxicated.
---
I’m just wondering if you can still earn rift fragments for the upcoming rift if you don’t complete tome 1 challenges. I heard Tomes don’t end since they are part of the story. So since I’m maxed now I figured I’ll save some for next rift.
---
I show survivors the same amount of mercy as killers show me when I play survivors. In other words I go out of my way to be a dick
---
This is just a shitty promotion
---
The intoxicated meter is relatively similar to a clown rework post I made a few months back. The one thing I would like is that when their intoxication grows they cough more. Reducing some stealth from into the survivors. Not a fan of the traps, as fun as they sound. But otherwise love it. His power does need a complete overhaul, throwing bottles is just too little. If you want projectiles use huntress lol
---
You're late to the party mate Doc rework has already been announced. He has some of the lowest kill rates at high ranks which is why he's being changed.
---
The passive static field is being removed and instead Doc now has a "static blast" that works based on his Terror Radius. It's the same as his static field but it makes everyone in his TR go up a tier of Madness. He also doesn't need to swap forms now and instead left click is to sticc and right click is to zapp, which is honestly how it should've been to begin with.
---
Maneuverability is super limited. You’re stunned if you run into objects or if you don’t hit anyone. It does have a Cooldown as well. It’s pretty easy to dodge tbh.
---
Cower
---
Wraith: can become invisible with a bell blessed by the Entity
---
Billy and Bubba: big ass chainsaw
---
Goose and Otz talked on Goose’s stream and had their conclusions.
---
Wraith is not a top tier killer. I think it was in his response video to Otz, but I believe Tru3 finally stepped back on the whole Wraith being top tier and reworded it to him being viable and that other killers still might have potential, he just needs to see it himself.
---
I can see Wraith as being capable of great matches, in my opinion he has some of the most potent add-ons in the game even, though when you compare him side by side with other killers, there are just so many that can perform better than him. Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly, Freddy, Oni, Huntress, Hag, Myers, and Ghostface can easily outperform him. With several other mid tier killers with the right builds being about as good as Wraith assuming they're all using optimal builds.
---
I'm sure if Tru3 didn't suck when using stalk as ghostface, he would still think he was better than Wraith too.
---
I remember when we were still hot off the heels of the console optimization lies and they announced DBD on switch. That was fun.
---
Otz looks like a sad puppy :((
---
Well, there is a cool down. Once you run into something or hit a survivor you get a cool down for a second or two. It's not that easy to control the chainsaw. I'll link the DBD wiki for the Hillbilly:  [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Max\_Thompson\_Jr.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Max_Thompson_Jr.)
---
That's great! I havent played dead by daylight in a while since it has been Christmas but I'll have to get on and give the new mechanics a try
---
I will say it's probably the bragging. But no, you're right. He's getting downvoted for "playing the game". How silly of me.
---
That’s just The Game
---
So mostly worthless.
---
Knowing there is a gen in the area still means you gotta FIND the gen.   Most maps you just see the tile and know exactly where the gen is on it, done and done.  You may need to spend 10 seconds or more to pinpoint where the Lerys gens are even when you know you're in the right area.
---
The map is basically tall LoS blockers as 90% of the map.  And while gens usually spawn in the outer hallways, sometimes they all end up showing up in rooms, meaning the time searching adds up.  Compared to Hawkins, the other painful indoor map, you basically can instantly find all of Hawkins generators, and can easily see/hear if a gen is in the area from outside of the tile too thanks to the banging doors.
---
It looks like u/IronCross130 has forgotten that several of Freddy's add-ons will slow your repair, healing, and sabotage speeds. This can range between being a minor inconvenience to being enough for him to close out the game without feeling pressured.
---
Being sick is an inconvenience until the sickness makes you Broken, at which point no one can heal you and you'll go down in one hit. You get out of this state by Cleansing, but the problem is that Cleansing gives Plague the chance to switch from infectious vomit to *damaging* vomit, and she can wipe whole teams if one survivor chooses to Cleanse at a bad time or a bad place.
---
Madness will mess up your skill checks, in Tier 3 the Doctor will see the Doctor hallucinations too, meaning you can forget about trying to hide from him. You can Snap Out of It back to Tier 2, and should. His add-ons do a lot of things, the ones to watch out for are the ones that make you Exhausted and the ones that make him see the hallucinations as early as Tier 2.
---
Legion will give you a Deep Wound. The timer will run down whenever you're not moving, so all you need do is outrun the Legion and then Mend.
---
Fungoose does good with nearly every killer, I would honestly take his matches as proof a lot more than Tru3 since he can actually work with a lot more than Tru3. Whereas Tru3 just bitches about the game being unbalanced the second things don't go in his favor.
---
Hell the guy you just replied to before me went on winstreaks as Oni and Speedlimiter Bubba, just taking plain 4ks or double pips as proof that a killer is the best in the game isn't enough. It is very important to look at what the killer is capable of as a whole rather than just I can kill most survivors.
---
did it first try just playing normally. I don't see the problem if i had to do it in 4 or 5 games tho. That's a "challenge"
---
Kill it with daddy myers
---
I’d rather they fix his face first
---
Queuing solo I absolutely have to have Kindred
---
You too?! I am in green ranks being paired with rank 20s with no perks and attempting on hooks, and as killer, I am in yellow ranks facing red rank survivor gods. :(
---
It's a complete shit show.  Constantly get 3-4 man SWFs 5-6 ranks higher than me as killer.  High ranks plus SWFs using comms.  So frustrating and tiresome.  Getting closer and closer to stopping playing.    
---
I have the luxury to put money into the games I play and I just can't justify spending more money on DBD.
---
They just nerfed the spirit and nurse to accommodate more for survivors. As well as buffing solo survivor perks like kindred and the detectives hunch. Yeah only killer sided...
---
Couldn't hear it with the chase music playing. I Also didn't have my earphones plugged in while playing.
---
I'm late but I just want to let you know how amazing this looks. You should be super proud of yourself?
---
Scratched Mirror Myers scares the shit out of me...But I dont want the devs to change anything from him. I find it funny when he fucking yoinks me out of a gen (of course, after jumping my chair and cursing)
---
This is how I play killer when I'm sleep deprived and I'm a red rank killer.
---
I found out that you can stop crows from showing your location by spamming the emote button (1,2). I exploited this and sat on basement all game. None of my teammates died, they got all the gens done, and I escaped trough the exit gate.
---
Ok I think Bill still had an i-frame coming off of the hook, so he took the got no injury.  It might have just been a sound bug where it didn't indicate the hatch hitting him
---
No idea what red rank killer means since I'm new to the scene of desd by daylight.  But cool
---
Haddonfield is not that great now and this is coming from a red survivor. Ormond and coldwind are where the good shit is so maybe people will keep railing on Haddonfield and I can keep taking Ormond offerings.
---
*Murray*. Sorry my bad. *Mori*
---
Here we see The Entity descending to pick up a survivor
---
What are some of the least used Killers? I very rarely ever see anyone use my favourite killer The Trapper. How come he is so seldom used?
---
I think Game needs a serious pallet rework. There are a couple of unsafe pallets and the majority of them are 100% safe and or unmindgameable as a killer.
---
well they loop all game while the other monkeys do gens then die because they aren't saved and die on the first hook
---
they don't need to do gens
---
If you're close enough to trigger chase music yeah.
---
Use any combination of add-ons that give you 3 Blinks.
---
Perks don't change her Blinks. Tinkerer will let you know when a gen is nearly finished, other gen-related information perks are Surveillance, Discordance, and Thrilling Tremors.
---
Bear in mind it doesn't have to be a gen - it's *any* grab. You might consider Remember Me and trying to grab a survivor off the gate.
---
I didn't say he's bad, I love him and he's fun to play, I meant that he's an underrated killer, the only killer I know of who's less used it Clown
---
No idea, but that person is making me ashamed of being my age.
---
I personally really like to use Lithe with most of my builds since I find it really helpful when either in chase or if I need to get somewhere fast.
---
I haven't really tried any other exhaustion perk yet so it's probably a bit one sided but I still think it's a good perk! It definitely needs more recognition tbh
---
You gave him the run of a lifetime
---
im guessing ur talking about the gpu? bc I have no clue what 9400F means
---
How the hell do u guys find the hatch??! Is there locations where is usually is or is it just random and really just luck to find it? I've yet to be able to do a hatch escape or give a survivor the hatch because I can't fucking find it!!
---
Vigil 
---
A lot can happen in the 8/10/12 seconds it shaves off of 40/50/60 seconds of exhaustion
---
when Auto aim doesnt work
---
red rank is the highest rank in the game which u would assume the best of the best are sitting in but eeeeeh
---
Uhhhhhhh... I think you mean ghost face
---
Oh ok
---
The new Tome will feature different characters, so you can expect new challenges based around their perks and powers. Aside from those, it's logical to expect the "generic" challenges to be more-or-less unchanged.
---
When the Rift closes, all of the existing challenges will stop awarading Rift Fragments. Any Rift content you haven't unlocked will *eventually* be available for purchase in the store. You'll still be able to do any incomplete challenges for the Bloodpoints, perhaps something to do between Tome pages.
---
Popular opinion:  You should have just posted this once to the sub tonight.
---
&gt;where the killer can run around a pallet in 1 sec and always get a free hit.
---
Yeah, free hits.  I lopped the killer for 20 secs and now I should get even more time with a completely safe pallet.  Then, when he breaks the pallet and gives me just enough time to make it to the next jungle gym or pallet I should be able to get another 10 to secs.  He should have to chase me for 4 minutes if he wants a single hit.  
---
Who cares that we burned 1 gen before he was able to get his first hook and 2 more before his second hook?  He should have been chasing all 4 survivors simultaneously if he wanted the game slowed down.
---
Honestly only the last two apply.
---
 Both of them actually.
---
I just got it too, first try actually.
---
I used:
---
Bond
---
Prove Thyself
---
Dark Sense
---
Spine Chill
---
Red map
---
She should’ve just respected the kobe
---
DLC's and other things will stay even if you don't own the game so to say. So yes, you can.
---
Definitely am enjoying the game. That is one if the best games I have had yet, I lost the killer so many times, i had about 33,000 Blood Points just from that match.
---
Real men jerk off and leave it on their body, which builds up to cheese for your toast.
---
4 stack of friends who want to bully lol
---
Stop bullying my man Mikey. He gives back massage.
---
I gagged
---
My GamePass expires today...that means I cant play the GP DBD game ??
---
How did you you find this out or what site :)?
---
First try here too, ran commodious with better together and it worked perfect
---
When Reddit told me "response null" I thought it didn't post.
---
Thank god i was born in 97, i now have mutant powers
---
Okay if we’re balancing for realism then, I should be able to mori without a mori. No reason some special offering means I am physically unable to murder a Claudette with my bare hands. Better yet, some killers can break through walls now, Oni is that strong now. David can now overpower you if you’re wearing a Susie legion skin.
---
No you can't, if you don't own the game yourself. Even if you own DLC's
---
Tenacity, I just like to speed away as a slug if the killer turns his back for a moment. It is surprisingly useful at red ranks, as killers often slug for a few moments before picking you up.
---
Her lore specifically focuses that she is a loner and anti social. Does that sound like a person who parties a lot? Its like saying vegans like to attend family barbecues.
---
I dunno why they chat Megs hair color in the first place . She was blond to begin with. Now red headish..
---
Looks nice on you though!
---
Decisive strike is an amazing perk.
---
bruh. your complaint isn't about the perks, but the ranking system. don't confuse the 2. like a deranked high rank killer is going to destroy you no matter what perks he uses
---
Ah yes, Nurse that took more then 3 years to get any sort of substantial nurse. And Spirit? Please, she is still absolutely S+ tier at hunting survivors.
---
Tell me more about all those survivors running kindred and DH you see. I'll wait
---
They're laughing in party chat about "how much of a pussy u are hahaha". Trust me, there's no winning with these guys. How do I know this? Lets just say the DBD community on PS4 can have toxic parties.
---
No, Myers would just rip her to shreds.
---
What an asshole move, lets just make the game harder for literally everyone else in the game.
---
I didn’t confuse anything. It’s the perks. Don’t tell me Ruin, BBQ, NOED, phobia, don’t fundamentally change the game for Rank 17-20 survivors.
---
For question 1, there are only 8 days left of the Rift, so unless you've played a lot over the past 60 days, it's probably not worth it. You can see your progress on the free track of the Rift.
---
To do the entire Rift without doing the challenges, it takes over 900 games. The challenges help a lot, but you probably won't get through them all in the next week or so.
---
So you’re just continuing the cycle, got it
---
they don't when both sides are actually rank 17-20. someone who has played enough to be using those perks together isn't actually rank 17-20
---
9400F Is my cpu
---
Happy to hear it's worked out well for you, nice work!
---
Have you not seen Nurse who ports behind the gate?
---
He took no damage because he just came off hook
---
that's a real horror fan
---
They’re doing small QOL changes and you’re still moaning like an entitled child? Yes spirit is S tier, that’s 1/18 killers. Stop acting like they’re only improving killer gameplay cuz u damn well know that’s not true
---
Nothings more satisfying than unhooking that person and everyone blocking for them so everyone escapes.
---
‘‘tis a shitpost
---
They’ve always been there...
---
Well, there isn’t much you can do to know the ranks of survivors before matches starts. The devs clearly messed up MM so all sorts of ranks are being paired with and against each other.
---
Are you on switch ? These have always been available.
---
They were always there tho
---
The masks represent the 4 original survivors: Dwight, Meg, Claudette, and Jake. Killing 25 of each as Leatherface will give you their mask on him.
---
No I’m on console and I’ve never seen this until now
---
It's pretty much the only one that isn't dead.
---
This might actually be what happened! Bill taking the hit during i frames and not displaying it due to communication error between clients.
---
No its not a strategy, camping 95% of the time makes the killer lose BPS/Pips because you're not being efficient in categories at all. This scenario is the only time its useful.
---
Sacrifice Dwight, Claudette, Jake and Meg 25 times each. Must be via hook. 
---
They have always been there.
---
For bloodwebs, you might want to youtube a video on them. Most of the popular videos will do, but they changed the way bloodwebs work after level 40. This video explains the changes after level 40:
---
https://youtu.be/8yNF-ga_Wa0
---
I agree. It basically just bothers me a bit because the hardest challenges are the ones locking lore.
---
I wanna see all of those survivor and killer cartoony videos on my game BHVR please... not on YouTube like some pleb.
---
Hentie too
---
I don’t like his small head, it looks so weird in his winter skin which would otherwise look fucking sick
---
&gt; ...Teabag at gate &amp; ~~die~~ D.C.
---
I mean you could argue needing the skill to aim the flashlight right or the knowledge when to drop and not drop the pallets isn’t skill, but all this coming from a nurse main? Sorry bud, I’m not buying it
---
Happened to the Entity himself for me once
---
I’ve given up on this, it feels impossible in red ranks.

It’s one of her yellow skins iirc

I did it my second try on the first day lol.

No its uhhhhhhhhh... its actually hag when you run up to a gen that she marked
---
*Barry
---
Your a p3 Freddy with 4 level 4 perks, your fine.
---
Strange that you don't see the Trapper much, since a number of the challenges in the current Archives require players to use him. It may just be that everyone has completed their challenges, and they don't want to use him any more.
---
Weaker killers tend to be used less, along with some DLC killers. You probably won't see many Pigs, Clowns, Demogorgons, Plagues. Nurse recently got nerfed, so you might not see her much either. Stealth killers are very popular right now, so you'll tend to see more of those instead.
---
No problem, friend!
---
Put doctor instead
---
Ok but once I buy and download the game, I will still have all my perks and DLCs right ??
---
That title does not make me think, man I should watch this.
---
I've been playing with a friend and I'm at level 9. Rank 19 and I've only played against the trapper once. We're on Xbox and honestly I don't think I've played against the Nurse once
---
"Just because I am bad guy doesn't mean I am *bad* guy."
---
I did it on the first try
---
if this man owned headphones you would have died so early
---
Yes, they will never go anywhere once you have bought them, even if you don't own the game.
---
Found the person who uses a track pad
---
That's right! Breaking the killers spirit and making him quit the chase is the best because you can walk back to your gen and do it in peace.
---
And that's bcuz the Xbox account right ? It all gets saved on that
---
I second this.
---
Then leave red ranks...
---
When there are people over
---
luck based chores are not challenging.
---
Perhaps it is the match making. All I know is that I created a new account to play with my GF and we ran into countless Rank 17s with those perks and it was unfortunate.
---
Playing all day today I think I’ve convinced her to just push through ruin so maybe it’s just a time thing like others said.
---
From love to hate theres but one step, except that we always go back and forth
---
It won't be, you wanted to play normally so he treated you normally
---
I hope that we get a few more variants of the realm. But thats unlikely considering how much time it would take to finish off an entire realm. And its also pretty hard to think of additional maps for that realm, there isn't much map opportunity mentioned in Doctors lore.
---
There are a number of ways to find it, but I generally just go off experience. The hatch does tend to spawn in a number of locations on each map, and once you learn them, you can look fairly quickly. Also, the hatch makes noise when it is open, so turn up your sound (hopefully you have headphones) and listen instead of spending too much time looking in an area.
---
A map can help you track the hatch if it spawns before everyone else dies.
---
The Bill perk Left Behind will also show you the hatch aura if you're within a certain range of it.
---
When you open the gates you start a timer, if the survivors don’t leave when the timer is up they are immediately sacrificed
---
All perks are active on their own, however some perks need specific conditions to activate: Deliverance allows you to unhook yourself but requires you to have safely unhooked someone and be on your first hook when you do use it)
---
How ? I’m not going to DC,
---
1) Once the gates are open, a timer will start. all survivors have to escape before the countdown ends.
---
2) It depends on the perk, if its something like dead hard than it only activates when you press the active key while injured. it explains the perks if you hover over it. (hope this helps?)
---
No you can escape whenever but if you want to be a team player you can wait for them. Be a team player but look out for yourself still. 
---
Some perks light up when active such as spine chill, some perks can be used but have a recharge like balanced landing and some perks have to be activated like dead hard. There are some good videos on what the best perks to use are depending on how you play.
---
Play bad? Try less hard
---
Clearly, I'm not "fine", as evident by the match's results.
---
Maybe dont go assuming the killer is extremely busted after not even knowing who it was lol
---
Yep, Nurse on console is pretty rare. You see a few people who play her at red ranks, but usually not many at lower ranks.
---
They’ll be salty about it. They live for that t bag at the door lol. 
---
You go into party chats with these kind of people?
---
Wait, I'm doing the moaning? This thread is full of whinging killer players. 
---
But don't worry, I won't remind everyone of the constant killer favoured changes over the years *cough bloodlust, stumblemechanic,windowvaults,exhausti-cough* oh excuse me.
---
That's why killers wait so long in queues.  Everyone is playing the OP killers.  What?  It's survivor queues that are long?    
---
This game is dominated by players looking for an edge whether it's as killer or survivor.  People use most of the same perks and it's not the weak one.  People generally pick the same group of killers and it's not the weak ones (before the nerfs, it was Huntress, Spirit, Billy, and Nurse.  Their presence dropped dramatically after the nerf because their level of OP went down dramatically).  
---
The point is the player base generally goes for OP/easy and based on the queues it seems survivors offer the OP/easier game play experience at this time despite your claims to the contrary.  
---
And it only makes sense that BHVR favor survivors.  At any given time, it's 80% of players in the game.  If you make killer too viable, you will have too many people trying to play killer and too few people playing survivor and thus super long queues.
---
1. You can leave if you feel there’s no other option. Some survivors hang around to see if they can make a last minute save, but it’s not a guaranteed death to the remaining survivors if you leave. They could also possibly get hatch if you leaving means they’re the last survivor in-game.
---
2. Certain perks have to be manually activated (like Dead Hard), while others will activate on their own if the criteria is met (like Spine Chill).
---
I was a rank 18 player but watching simple YouTube videos on how to escape killers and use perks I made it to rank 7 last season
---
Popular opinion Dark sense challenge is the most urksome because I shouldnt have to do 4/5 gens
---
1. No, leaving will not kill them, but if you leave you can no longer help them.
---
2. Some perks will require you to do somethings. Some you do not. I would recommend reading the entire perks as that will inform you on how to use them.
---
Best of luck :)
---
1. No. Anyone can escape whenever they want to after the exit gates are powered. As soon as the exit gates are open though, the end game collapse starts which is the timer on the top of your screen. Once that timer runs out, it instantly sacrifices all the survivors who haven't left.
---
2. You can use any perks you want to as long as your have them in the characters inventory. The way they can be activated depends on the perk and you should read the descriptions to know when they activate. An example is Iron Will which at its highest tier, makes the survivor make no grunts of pain at all. A perk like Iron Will is always active unless the killer is running the perk Stridor to counter it. A perk that needs to be activated in game is like Balanced Landing where the survivor would have to jump off a high area like a hill for a speed boost to be activated for 3 seconds.
---
Don't worry about it. It'll all come to you once you play enough.
---
*Never*
---
3 D.C.'s &amp; the final survivor may get the hatch.  There's no honor in slaying the last survivor, no glory, *no joy*.  I leave that sort of pathetic 4k to "The Legion", that merry band of over caffeinated runts.  I've no understanding why The Entity tolerates their presence in the Fog, and my lamentations stay between me &amp; the basement hooks.
---
The abandoned may leave the arena... it gives them *hope*, so I feed The Glorious Entity.
---
-E. MacMillan
---
😔😔😔
---
They haven't reworked him yet. Like I said it's been *announced*, and like the announcement said it's coming out sometime in 2020.
---
Remember its really important to make sure new players get matched as fast as possible! Even if that means they have a miserable time playing against a rank 10+ killer! Remember when we could save everyone in the game that experience by dodging low ranks as a solo survivor? Too fucking bad!!
---
I prefer legion, legion is just more interactive and fun. While clown i just feel like im playing a cavemans huntress.
---
Also clown is very annoying to go against
---
show me what that neck do
---
Okay
---
Noed one if you run blood warden it works out didnt have to camp for it
---
On god
---
Dw, red ranks will be the ONLY ranks in a few months.
---
Devs make rank reset worthless and now everyone is going to be red ranks, no matter how dogshit you are.
---
this change is going to get reverted in a few months, watch.
---
I am! I’m excited for it
---
For reference, nobody was camped or tunneled. They had a Nea who was AFK in a locker for at least 3 minutes.
---
I wish it was try hard, you just have to take part on the match as survivor to pip....
---
It's slightly better than the Overwatch community but still one of the worst.
---
You where above 16 once you have been able to afford p3 Freddy.
---
Thought U was on r/okbuddydaylight
---
I'm also born in 96 with the name Colton... think I found my evil twin because yikes
---
&gt; Idk how you would think it's about survivors
---
Probably because one of the developers said on a livestream the rework is about making it so survivors aren't as annoyed to play against him. If he gets buffed it would be a side effect but the fact they're dodging calling it a buff makes me a little skeptical. 
---
And if you asked me if I'd rather have Exhaustion causing Add-ons or gimicky backwards skill checks I'd take the Exhaustiok every time. After about a month most experienced players won't care about backwards skill checks, much like how people can still easily power through Ruin.
---
I'm more impressed by the guy swinging himself off the hook
---
Thank you so much! I’m still getting adjusted and aquatinted with the game so this really helps a lot

My favorite thing about dedicated servers is closing the chat window and leaving right after and imagining them bursting a vein yelling at no one to make themselves feel better.
---
its been like this for a while now.
---
Clown is easier huntress and now just a shitty freddy as well
---
Spirit is babys first nurse
---
Oni was easier billy in some ways (i didnt have an issue with this one since he was p unique and i love billy) 
---
GF is easier myers, ect.
---
They really need to find a way to make more killers on the same lvl of balance as billy, instead of making more forgettable or aggravating characters
---
Worth is subjective, and we don't yet know how much the items will cost when they come to the store after the "Rift exclusivity period" ends.
---
It is *possible* to unlock everything in the Rift by just buying all the Tiers - 1000 AC for the Rift, 100 AC for each Tier left in it. 
---
We're getting to the point where you'd literally need to spend every waking hour in-game in order to earn enough XP to complete the Rift, so you should probably sit down and work out which items you want, and how many games you'll need to play to get them.
---
&gt; *how do the blood webs work level 10 and up?*
---
The character you're using is irrelevant. After you've made 5 picks, or after you've selected a perk, the Entity will start making picks. It tends to start on a perk, and if it can't find one then it'll often go for rarity instead. It will then follow the Bloodweb inwards until it hits the centre or hits a spot you've already taken - in the latter case it'll simply pick another outlying node and repeat the process. I'm not sure what you mean by "juke" but generally you want to go for the stuff you want most, and prevent the Entity from taking a junction that leads to things you want. If the Entity is following a "low value" route, you leave it be. If there's nothing in the Bloodweb you need (because maybe you just need perks, not add-ons) then you want to find the cheapest routes to the edge and pick those while the Entity takes out big chunks of the Bloodweb by taking the junctions nearer the centre.
---
I didn’t. I said it sounded busted on paper. I also asked the downside cause obviously there has to be one.
---
the day legion doesnt need any changes is the day i die. I just want to see DBDs problem child go to rehab... again
---
/r/chargetheyphone
---
It is tough, because having actual variety in maps is fun and makes certain killers more viable than they usually are. Lery's is fantastic for stealth killers because there are no sight lines and it is not too large, so the stealth killers with no movement abilities can get around quickly.
---
However, this map is an absolute NIGHTMARE for someone like huntress. There are no open areas where you can use hatchets, and so much junk strewn around that will prevent any loops from being endangered by her hatchets. I'm cool with maps being diversified to benefit certain killers, but no one likes the feeling of spawning in with a certain killer to a certain map and going "oh. GG I guess. I'm at about a quarter of my strength on this map."
---
Oh the how turns table have
---
The published stats indicate that the Trapper is the most popular killer across all ranks - chosen around 14% of the time.
---
Chances are that you're in Red ranks, where Trapper is only picked around 7% of the time.
---
I think the more someone mix’s the tonic, it would activate the different effects.
---
Pf, 94 here and I suck at looping &amp; flashlight, I do gens, save and hide my ass in the grass. Never tbag.

---
Aww she's so cuute
---
I mean maybe ur just bad ?😂
---
i mean TBF she was incredibly frustrating to go against since its literally just waiting in a lobby for like 5+ mins just to stand literally 0 chance against a god roaming around the map
---
I mean, at least Oni has super strength to swing that giant club, hillbilly just runs with a chainsaw... I feel like it would be more likely to hurt him than anyone else.
---
Nurse isn't a free killer. :P
---
*Monto has entered the chat*

You’re right, I need a better gaming chair.

Edit: misspelled  the title, but you guys understood it.
---
Iron maiden or Mad grit
---
She can't do that! Nerf her or something!
---
The hatch makes a noise when it's open, it's quite distinctive.
---
As for hatch spawns, the location appears to be a chosen from a list - for example, on Freddy's maps it has a pretty high chance of appearing in the preschool's "basement" (not to be confused with *the* Basement) in the little dead-end corner next to one of the staircases, while sometimes it'll be in a house or on the "main road".
---
I'm not sure anyone has *publicly* collated all the locations.
---
Make it so you can’t use addons with it that give you extra hatchets.
---
The hatch.
---
That's what the game calls the Hatch.
---
SWFs using comms get approximately 12 free perks.  Those free perks are in many cases much better than the actual perks themselves.  
---
McLean stated in a recent stream that they try addressing game balance with solos versus SWFs and so we get perks like Bond.  But that perk is a perfect example of the fix not actually addressing the problem.  
---
A solo using Bond just had to trade off a better perk (Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, or Decisive Strike, or Inner Strength for example) for a reduced level of situational awareness that comes free with SWFs using comms .    
---
So not only did they make it that solos have to lose a perk slot to get a shitty version of what SWFs have free, they're doing nothing to address the 12 or so free perks SWFs get that completely imbalance the game for the killer.
---
Thanks
---
make it only instant down from a certain decently far distance.
---
Ik people are going to argue if IRI heads are balanced or not (fucking crazy, but i have actually had a lot of people trying to tell me they are)
---
You cant hide, aura perks exist, you cant just "not get hit", The one downside is almost completely negated by infantry belt (dont lie, you almost never run into a iri head huntress not running infantry as well), and DC'ing against them isnt toxic.
---
Understood, thx!
---
Thx!
---
-2 to Maximum hatchets. 
---
Addons which provide bonus starting hatches are fine, However you cannot replenish them until you are below the current amount which would be 0 and 1. 
---
It isn't rocket science, I think this was the intended restraint but they didn't follow through with it
---
Thanks!
---
Perfect thx
---
Hope that helps
---
Very good Nerf Idea, I can't come up with my own so i was looking to find some.
---
It took me a while to sort out the perks
---
Is she hot?
---
Why did this post blow up lol
---
Sounds like a good idea but could be too big of a Nerf, I'm not too sure if it'll be completely balanced.
---
Oof
---
What kind of logic is this???
---
Why she lookin like a Thot?
---
Remove it
---
We dont care
---
It should cause deep wound instead.
---
Srsly. I hate that shit. And it's stupid AF on the killers part too- like, it's for ALL players bro
---
Make it so that it no longer stacks with any add-ons that give you extra hatchets or extra starting hatchets. One hit down, one hatchet.
---
only basement lockers give iri head
---
ni because I also got pulled off the hook twice with no recourse
---
No because they farmed me off the hook against my will
---
I like Dwight’s lmao
---
I mean 1 Hit hatchets are insanely strong, Some people chuck them at gens, others position their self in a way to stall unhooking attempts in addition to allowing them to insta down the unhooking player and effectively pursue the rescued player. Maybe some of her addons can show the arc in addition to their normal effects
---
Yea, and ? 
---
that happens in normal games all the time, sounds normal to me
---
a lot of people are loners, antisocial, etc and go out every now and then. even if she went out just to walk around the town or some shit. she could just like looking nice. some girls like to dress up for themselves. i dont think its that cut and dry where she never dolls up because shes antisocial.
---
Don't kink shame - Bunny slut feng

message the killer in the lobby. I did this on Xbox and told him what I was trying to do. And he said ok but you need to step in my bear trap 6 times for my challenge. So we said deal. And he hunted down everyone else but me. I felt bad for the other survs but fuck it. desperate times.
---
Honestly, Freddy is the killer I could most likely see doing this in-character.
---
What the fuck I was literally browsing r/chargetheyphone just a minute ago
---
First try! Worked 3 gens through Hex: Ruin and used brand new part for 4th gen

I just wanna run Botany Knowledge and not feel hated y’know?

---
Np! GL;HF!

I think if you're bad at either side and want to get better, you should take precautions to get better. Watch video tutorials, read tips, exercise with friends, find ppl that play how u play. Learn from mistakes.
---
Yeah, I do. Not sure if you play on PS4, but in the community you post on the community "wall" looking for players to play with. Complete strangers, you don't know if they're toxic or if they're nice.
---
I am literally dodging 3-4 man SWFs on average 6-7 lobbies in a row.  And yes, I know the definition of literally.  
---
Luckily killer queues are near instant.  So I dodge and let them go back to another 10-minute queue.  
---
" Is it every game like that? "  
---
Many more than you claim, at least at higher ranks.  Add to that the GGEZ, you suck, git gud, t-bagging, etc. when I have four red ranks facing me as a purple rank killer.  Fun times all around.  
---
I'm not claiming that all SWFs are well coordinated and toxic but they are frequent and I'd argue ruining the game thus fewer people playing killers and longer wait times (too long) in survivor queues.
---
Jesus christ  lol XD
---
A nervous twitch.
---
No problem! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!

Get 3 friends, have them call you when a gen is almost complete, go complete it with them.

So after 2 min (or 3 if they find HG), and since they will most likely find ruin in the meantime you have sacrificed 3 perk slots to get one instadown. Doesn't sound like a lot of value to me at high ranks to play 3/4 of the game with one perk since most good survivors will just power through ruin and will know better than to show themselves while exposed.
---
I like it. 
---
For Atychiphobia I think skill checks should also be quieter because of how easy they get when you get good.
---
Name checks out, at least the last word.
---
So now you change your story? Go back and read the lore and read the outfit descriptions.
---
What’s the difference between the 5 Badhams?
---
I had tuis problem a couple days ago
---
Doesn't the Entity punish the killers if they don't kill and let them go?
---
nAmE cHeCkS oUt get over ur self bro. I've had killers message me from the lobby asking me to please let them hook me in basement. it's the challenges
---
They never look above
---
You should be able to activate 3 challenges at a time change my mind.
---
I had the same happen against a Billy, and this was with me looping him for most of that last minute where there was one guy on hook and one left up, the guy who was up ran right past him so the Billy saw his scratch marks and downed him before he even got to the hook to save. The hookee and other surv who were left DCed and i managed to luckily find hatch after looping the Billy through half the map
---
Toxic pallet loops, why don’t survivors just let me kill them immediately smh
---
I killed two people let two get to the last gen down one before they finish open the exist gate and hook them
---
I think you play smart but sitting around the hook when you know a survivor is close would be the case almost every time. Ideally if you see someone go down, 2 people would stay on gens and the 3rd would go for save and if they get in a chase the 2nd would go for the save. I always run bbq and chilli and most of the time I’ll see one or two survivors and just go for them even though I know a survivor is close. If they unhook while I’m in distance I’ll run back and down whichever comes first. It’s definitely camping but each to their own.
---
Groovy.
---
Yup, kinda made me go from this is damn good funny commentry to just, oh well that's unpleasant
---
As a survivor main i don’t blame you if you know someone’s there but at the same time it’s still camping regardless of reasons why. But it’s just a game. People get offended to easily
---
there idiot
---
Yup, and that’s a dick move. People suddenly play this game for the challenges, messing everyone else’s game. Working with the killer/survivor is a bannable offence and as said, major dick move. ”It’s the challenges” who cares, do the challenges while playing normally. I finished this challenge first try without any foul play, wouldn’t care if I didn’t, I would try it next time.
---
Red ranks are full of crybabies
---
Bad matchmaking is not *my* mistake.
---
Little virgins acting out online to troll. Just ignore them.
---
I gotta let last peep live especially bc I get points if they DC (I mean now so do survivors yay) bc it's not fair to them. Like I've been on that end and its hella shitty so if I can make someone's game fun and enjoyable by god imma do it
---
Reported. Man in picture, too god damn sexy
---
Im saying if u got better( not trying to be a dik) . The matchmaking would be right. Im just saying u can get so good u can guess survivors perks and objectives.  And stump them
---
Someone's butthurt. Lol
---
This is gonna sound really stupid, but I have issues when everyone starts cleansing and it starts getting overwhelming. As well as what I should do in the beginning of the game.
---
And all it would take is a simple change to the phrasing (do this "while ___ perk is equipped"). I hope so too! Thanks again ^.^
---
I teabag to thank teammates for healing me.
---
Hatch spawns are quite predictable once you get to know the layouts of the map. They’re usually placed near exit gates, hills, major buildings (killer shack or centerpieces), and in worse case the center of the map. For Gideons, all hatches will he found in the lower level of the map.  When near the hatch, it’ll make a slightly resonating noise that gets louder as you approach it. From there, if you have a map add-on, you can highlight the area for survivors to see it. If you have a key, there’s an add-on that’ll help you locate it within a certain distance. Someone has also mentioned Bill’s perk “Left Behind” that is also a good if you have a key with you.
---
You didn't answer why you do it.
---
Ormond has the giant building in the middle a usable with balanced landing, almost all safe pallets, jungle gyms, long walls, and basically the whole map connects everything as a giant loop.  To top it all off scratch marks are hard to see and the map is massive.
---
Haddonfield has nothing on ormond, I don't think you know what you're talking about.
---
Me when I play killer lmaooo but I love t bagging a toxic killer
---
I don’t
---
For some reason I thought this was already part of the game, but maybe instead nerf Infantry Belt / Leather Loop so that they also increase hatchet windup time by a lot, or some other drawback. I'd be fine with Iri head if it meant only one hatchet.
---
That Yui was nope I’m getting the fuck outta here.
---
See I don't have my Laurie up enough to have DS on other people, but I do have no mither and an idea I'll try. I didn't realize my Claude had No Mither, so all I can do is pray that I stay out of sight long enough to get my skill checks. Still, thanks for the build!
---
To say hello and thank you to my teammates
---
Get premonition, much better than spine chill it my opinion.
---
Neither is it my fault that half of them were immersed as fuck. Red ranks, I guess.
---
thats not really a nerf though, the huntress could just waste 1 or 2 hatchets before reloading
---
im guessing Ryzen?
---
I don't think it woulf really fix his problem and will be like Doc instead, where his power has potential but switching between what bottle will fuck you over. I think his power is fine, remove the slowdown and lower the survivor's speed a little when hit (20% slow increased to 25% on direct hit?) so its better than a freddy trap but needs to be reloaded. Or just remove the slowdown and put the yellow reload addon as base. It would help him a lot
---
Why is this guy being downvoted, he’s right?
---
BHVR: it’s the entity
---
Fuck off with this shit we don't care about adverting like this and begging for follows fucking stupid
---
&gt;The nurse didnt adapt to the survivors and lost for that reason.
---
I know the point you're trying to make, but in this situation and others like it, no. There was nothing the Nurse could do there. If they swatted the survivors there's no way they'd have made it to the hook in time. Without taking Mad Grit there is nothing to do in a situation like this.
---
make her not be able to use any buff with it so ur stuck with 1 base hatchet that can insta down
---
Its not all that bad trust me . It gets better
---
Still working. Meg is totally done, but I've fcked up somewhere with Jane's skeleton again. I think, I won't fix it, because I'm lazy, so I have already started working with Nea and Kate
---
this is why we don't go to subreddits of dbd
---
proof?
---
I mean for the whole game. The nurse had so much time to realise the survivors play style
---
Upvoted because feng gang
---
Meh, pink mori his ass. Streamer privilege/s
---
That was me, sorry. I was feeling gassy.
---
The very first time I played DBD I thought it did. I didn’t even know that was a special killer place. I just wandered in there and thought it was a good hiding place
---
Probably because it's free with the Xbox/windows gamepass
---
Awesome drawing, props to your friend they are very talented
---
I would like to see it reworked to where instead of insta-downs, it would make her hatchet throws completely silent. No windup/holstering sounds, no sounds as it is flying through the air, just completely silent. I think it would make for some interesting mind games around corners and jungle gyms
---
as Freddy=use ruin, bbq, pop goes the weasel. Then get the add one that replaces snares with fake pallets. At this point all you need to do is find one survivor and hook them at which point just teleport to the next survivor using bbq and you should be good. I rarely give up on chases, it's time wasted unless you're completely getting stomped and you can switch to another survivor. Remember it's all about the weakest link, get them out first and it gets significantly easier. GL
---
I farm bc fuck it I got nothing better to do. I basically keep a low rank killer account to help teach baby survivors how to play. At the same time I get to play killers I don't know how to, i learned ghostface simply letting ppl farm. Same with oni and spirit. They get experience and so do I. Plus it helps with rituals. I get it can be boring but it's a refresher from purple/red ranks. I like a challenge but sometimes having a fun farming match is great too lol
---
He needs to be able to Ninja vanish, by throwing a bottle straight down at his feet, then someone come up with what happens next:
---
Teleport to a location?
---
Become invisible, and be able to Sprint using shift?
---
Something map pressure?
---
Holy shit it looks real
---
And tbagging you. Fuck that Adam
---
Not from what I've been doing
---
“Boops the snoot”
---
or you can just get good, idk - theres only a few killer picks that need stuff like ruin/CI, but here I am playing against mouthbreathers who use pop goes the braincell/ruin combo every game (and sometimes with thanat), on top tier killers, bc they're terrible at the game lol
---
Crabs
---
*eats your liver*
---
No marge!
---
Rank 9 killer, probably means I'm not the best at killer. Does that mean I can have fun going against less than optimal survivors? Nope. Non stop red rank swf groups. Totally makes the game fun.
---
The same thing can happen to survivors. Its unfortunate, but it happens. 
---
 
---
 Also, you matchmaker within  +/-6 of your rank, so that 3 is a actually within your matchmaking.
---
God damnit this format is making me feel old
---
I feel you, I’m actually at rank 8.
---
So I know exactly what it’s like. But it seems the same for survivor too tbh. At my rank I either get a god team or no one does anything. You just gotta deal with it and keep playing.
---
It’s incredible. It looks exactly like the oni, if not better.
---
nut
---
It IS a strategy it’s the reason perks like insidious exist.
---
**While not moving press the power button to throw a bottle at your feet, covering you in smoke.**
---
**After that maurice will spawn on your feet, increasing your speed by 300%.**
---
**Stepping over a survivor will apply them the dead status effect.**
---
***You cannot recover from dead***
---
*HEE-HEE*
---
He also needs acrylic nails. Periodt
---
No not at all. Nope. Nuh huh. Not 60 seconds of being safe. Never. Not another second chance for survivors. Not at all
---
It’s really good
---
Am I the only one who doesn’t like to dance with death, I’ll wait to see if anyone gets hurt or hung, but if I see the killer (especially one with a chainsaw or one shot) my ass is sufficiently hauled.
---
Someone is really butthurt about DS lol
---
So 1 of the 4 swf is within 6 of my rank. Cool that makes it totally ok. It happens would be acceptable if it was rare. I ONLY GO AGAINST TEAMS LIKE THIS! Fuck it this game is simply not fun as killer being placed against rank 2 swf teams back to back to back. This isn't rare. This is every fucking game I play lol. Meh I'll just quit playing killer like everyone else.
---
You've been playing this game for how long? Killers are never allowed to have fun.
---
A solution could be adding a 5th perk and make it ruin
---
Lost my game because some guy with DS got on the other guy and made me grab him. Got stunned. He unhooked the other dude and the guy downed had unbreakable. I got outplayed amirite :')
---
Not me, but the subreddit seems to endorse it when the other side has done something considered equally bad/worse- a video showing a facecamping killer getting teabagged at the exit gates would probably get upvoted here.
---
become a better killer then. When a killer sees me (bloody laurie) they will down next when I'm taken off the hook but they know WAY better that to grab me. so they go off after someone else and come back for me later.
---
I'm not bragging, I'm literally making fun of how I play at 3am.
---
I guess you didn't actually care that much about who got screwed then.
---
rip dbd : 2016 - Early 2018
---
Since the day it released on console lol. It's always been a challenge as killer but being put up against top tier swf non stop makes it unplayable for me. Most of the time I simply don't find it fun to play super sweaty hence the green rank. Putting a rank 9 killer against a rank 2 swf is completely fucked tho. Meh I haven t been playing much lately anyways I'll just stick to bullying killers like the majority of players.
---
Not saying that what they said in postgame was justified, but I'd be salty too if me and (presumably) my friend ran BPS and I only got 4689 points.
---
Only if the killer tried to camp/tunnel someone for no good reason.
---
I think the entire power should be redone, clowns aren't known for their perfume products. I would incorporate laughing gas and maybe toy traps. The bottles could be given to an alchemist killer instead
---
I didn't mean to grab her she went on the guy I meant to grab. I knew she had DS and they were in a SWF. Can't become a better killer when I CLEARLY should of won but got dsd because apparently I tunneled
---
LET THE MAN LEARN
---
What OP perks?
---
What’s up with the new hook exploit survivors are doing were they hide behind the hooked survivor and can’t get hit? I had a survivor do this to me and just gave me an excuse to camp.
---
If you’d bother to check the sub in the last few days you’d quickly see everyone complaining about this 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Doesn't bother me as survivor. I'm rank 3 survivor and I can usually pip even with a garbage team. As killer tho playing against top tier teams every single game just completely ruins the entire experience. Even when I win I lose lol. I guess I don't find tryharding and literally sweating every game as fun.
---
/u/not_queen_bhvr
---
if you "clearly" should have won, then you would have won. It's no different than when I'm halfway out the exit gates and get downed with NOED. Or using a Mori. Survivors have no protection against a mori or NOED if they are last out. So DS is pretty balanced when you look at those two.
---
Are we all gonna ignore that spine chill is the biggest spirit counter? Yes? Ok then
---
With how many gen skills there are I dont think it's that fast anymore.
---
Back when you had no bloodlust or w.e its called, and the infinites were still around that shit was stupid. 
---
However, now you have hexes, doctors thing, legions notification if gen rushing, ghost faces blocking of gens, etc.
---
I think gens are very fair now. If you dont bring any gen perk, then you better be prepared for it. Just like not bringing an exhaustion perk and getting mad killers are too fast.
---
Atleast thats my opinion and I play both roles
---
PM then.
---
Imagine your main not having a shirtless cosmetic

I only go for three juicy leaks don’t give a shit about the community there.
---
This is absolutely outstanding work, I hope everyone remembers to upvote
---
Nearly gives me a heart attack because I think she’ll start chasing.
---
I’m only purple rank survivor so I don’t know how red ranks work.
---
This is amazing what, artist goals 😭
---
Iri head is fine. It’s strong but it is an ultra rare. Its Iri head and infantry belt that becomes a bitch.
---
She has 5 hatches and infantry belt gives an extra 2. That’s like an extra 40%
---
With iri heads and infantrybelt she ends up with 3 more hatchets than she is meant to have.
---
Infantry belt should be X percentage rounded up, not just 2 extra hatchets.
---
This would mean iri head and infantry belt would then give her only 2 hatchets. Would that be ok? Who knows but it’s a lot fucking better than 3 iri heads.
---
Another solution I read on here was to have them cause deep wounds instead.
---
I know the feeling don't worry xP
---
Maybe Borrowed or Dead Hard. Can’t hook rescue when you’re already dead, can’t dash if it’s an insta down
---
It's basically the same. My point is usually even playing solo on a shitty team you can pip and rank up as survivor. Do gens, get saves and heals and get in a chase and your good. As killer you get severely punished if you play well all game but don't secure at least 3 kills. I'm just pissed lol but I'm seriously done playing killer because it just isn't fun and I don't play games to piss myself off haha.
---
Yeah its ass on PC  I wait in the searching for a lobby screen for a minimum of 15 minutes with killer. Survivor takes 2 minutes tops.
---
I did it! Yay!
---
But then realised I forgot to equip it
---
FUUUUUUUU-
---
Being the killer isn’t an excuse to be a dick. 
---
You don’t have to let them go. Just hook them and move on.
---
Nah sorry wasn't me lol i guess alot if people are doing insidious basement bubba
---
Yikes I would have hated to be your teammate this game
---
I guess take it as a learning opportunity until (if) it's fixed.
---
Yeah apparently so haha
---
I'll just blame it on console auto aim XD
---
I hated myself more than what my teammates would have hated me
---
The texture on his face really gets me. You can tell how weathered his demonic skin is.
---
I did all 4 in basement as Wraith. Had silent bell and see auras when cloaked 12 meters away, also ran agitation and iron grasp. Didn't camp, just kept going to basement. Had some wiggle off but I got it
---
That looks way scarier than the actual killer in game lol.
---
Rank 16 killer here, just went against 3 red ranks and 1 purple rank in the same team a few hours ago.
---
You 😫😫😫
---
I've been rank 1 killer before, I'm red rank survivor now. I don't want to learn, I want to go against people my own rank. I don't want to sweat and only play the best killers with the best perks and add ons. I want to have fun. Apparently even at green ranks you aren't safe from death squads. I'm just going to not play killer lol. Supposed to be fun, not fun. Playing killer is legit more frightening then playing survivor at this point.
---
Do totems for NOED, moris play safe and don't get downed. Don't go for greedy plays. Not fun but whatever, it exists. DS is a 5 seconds stun that gives you immunity for 60 seconds. 60 seconds is ~80% of a gen. Its disgustingly strong especially when its supposed to be an anti tunnel perk but is used as safety. These guys lost, they were 3, one gen was left and one was on the hook with 30 seconds left. I downed both and picked up the claudette by accident because she got priority over the other one and stunned me. She went for the unhook, I downed her and got the last guy that she unhooked. Hooked claudette and went to pick up the first one (scared of unbreakable) but they were already up and got the last gen done, double adrenaline proc. Got the injured one and the last one escaped. I should of meant 4kd instead of won since I pipped but there was no way I could know she had DS and it was still up after all that. This was dumb as fuck since I didn't tunnel her, I was finishing the game up. I'd say the new DS is even stronger than old one tbh.
---
Dude tell me about it, you will never hear me scream louder then when I run up to a gen and her ugly face pops up out of nowhere
---
It’s okay, all perks are appreciated here... except monstrous shrine and buckle up.
---
The bug a while back, where the flip was the only animation they did when you downed them. Lmao
---
So are a lot of good perks hidden behind a paywall essentially? Hex ruin belongs to The Hag right? If i don’t own her how do I get these set ups that people recommend? 
---
Same for Pop goes the weasel which is my kinda perk :)
---
Forgot the pjamas and the black hair lol
---
k. get over it. Next game.
---
what story am i changing? im not about to have an argument over video game lore or get accused of shit. i just wanted to point out almosy every human being ever has dressed up to go out and do stuff.
---
well the ranking system is meh but the matchmaking is broken
---
I completed every Tome (100% all challenges, not just reached the end) and still only ended up at Level 45.  The grind is real, and having to wait 15 minutes for a lobby every time just makes it worse.
---
Sounds good, hopefully it gets done soon!

Yeah I did, I said gg and moved on. It still pissed me off a bit as I had no way of knowing. Its annoying that there are so many second chance perks
---
You telling me that having a survivor(s) doing nothing for two whole minutes is bad?
---
Nice shots.
---
Remember when Friday the 13th was gonna kill DBD
---
Remember when Last Year was gonna kill DBD
---
WELL THEY ALL FAILED BC NOBODY CAN STAND UP TO OUR BOIS AND GALS
---
Ya can buy killers and survivors with in game currency if you play enough, licensed killers need to be bought with real money, same goes for survivors
---
If my teammates all DC I'll generally try to at least finish one gen if I can/find totems/chests to salvage some BP, and try to slam some pallets for the killer to break and just let them have the kill if they don't wanna farm. 
---
Don't play often as killer but the DCs suck so I feel for them.
---
I like the idea! Especially the Stronger together perm
---
Bitch u deserve it! Being an ass potato like that shake my damn head
---
I got dbd but no dlcs, not to mention a gaming laptop, very grateful for that, be even more grateful for those dlcs
---
Reworks aren’t usually that drastic, most likely just a change to the amount and strength of the loops.
---
So if a glitch happens you ruin the game for someone else?

Be bisexual

Yea but neither are even close to OP

Don’t forget the changes to her reverse bear traps and the end game collapse. Those were big changes.

bc BHVR doesnt balance this game around good players so DS can be abused like u thought it was an anti-tunnel perk HA it is an anti suck it perk.

I just play and stop giving a shit sometimes I try hard but usually I just make fart noises and swing swong hard
---
congrats now imagine all that bp
---
Most (all?) meta survivor perks are available from free characters with the notable exception of Decisive Strike, but yeah, there are a lot of good killer perks behind a paywall.
---
Yea I had this exact same thing happen earlier in a game and they won because of it 
---
Really pissed me off.
---
The en titty after I get 4 kills
---
Yes, as long as you keep the Crouch button down while you are doing an action you won't trigger the trap, EXCEPT for when using a flashlight! Using a flashlight will make you stand back up and trigger any traps in your range :) But you can hold Crouch during unhooking (whether you are hooked or unhooking) and repairing to ensure no traps are triggered. Good luck out there! And don't tell too many of your friends, lots of folks don't know to crouch against Hag and I get to eat them because of it ;)
---
Lie
---
Honestly people need to suck it up. Let people play how they want.  You cant control the other side of the game, just deal with it and do what you're gonna do.  Lol it isnt hard.
---
And of course, have fun.
---
No the game wasn't made for SWF. The SWF was added 2 weeks after the launch and was kinda shit. Same reason you don't have ingame comms. Game just wasn't made for it
---
Alright, so the trick with cleansing is to know when you want to get Corrupt going.
---
Plague *generally* looks for the 3-gen strat, so if the pool isn't near your 3-gen, don't worry about it. If the furthest pools have been used then the survivors will *have* to get close to you if they want to cleanse. All you need do is ensure that there's no way for them to use *all* the pools, because at that point the pools will *all* be refreshed and you'll have a bad time.
---
When they cleanse near you then it's a chance to use Corrupt to hose the survivors down. If you down one, hook them within your patrol area. The other three can now either try to get the unhook while you're using Corrupt (good luck), they can wait it out, or they can try and bait you away from your 3-gen (don't take the bait). Just repeat the process until they're all dead, or until they get the hatch.
---
The early game was covered in my other post - you need to decide on your perks and add-ons, whether you're going to try to rushdown survivors with instavomit or whether you're going to work towards a 3-gen endgame.
---
Bro the survivor side maps are like the double of the killer side maps
---
or they pick u up instead lmao. Just run iron grasp and agitation every game lmao
---
are you saying he didn't? did you see the video? he hooked and camped each time. I'm not complaining about it, just pointing it out. In case you just commented with out viewing the video, i made it out.
---
Dude they are like rank 16.
---
Head on SWF that try to head on you mid hit is fine and fun too. Always laugh my ass off at that. A serial killer getting fucking body slammed by some guy in a locker running at them mid swing of their weapon lol
---
Nop, i love that map hawkins have  very good loops if you arent a potato
---
"how to use *insert 3 of the most basic, easy to use perks in the game*
---
Rough estimate, not counting daily bonuses and such: 
---
250 games that last 10 minutes each, you're looking at more than 40 hours of actual gameplay at minimum.  Every minute past 10 is wasted in terms of XP gain, so your actual play time will be more because the game doesn't magically end at 10 minutes.  
---
Now add your queue times on top of that.
---
Or pay $25 to get the rest of the rewards, which is what I believe BHVR is banking on.
---
GET BACK TO THE FIRE YOU SLUT KILLER
---
Whoosh
---
Well, technically you aren’t wrong... i don’t really understand what your argument is here. that kind of came out of nowhere though tbh
---
The safe pallets are bs with requires zero skill
---
My favorite part of this meme is how many killers complain about how broken survivors are but fact of the matter, much like in this image, those "op" things don't account for shit. Killers kill yo.
---
Ok but when are we getting shirtless frank
---
The question was rhetorical, but don't worry about. I know the feeling. I'm always at rank one. Feels like I'm only allowed to use the same meta perks and killers every game. Get punished if I want to switch things up. Dead hard 90% of the time extends chases for a minute+. Ruin locations that are out in the open. Ruin either gets destroyed immediately or they rush gens through it. The game is fundamentally bad for killers. The sad reality is if you want to have fun you have to play survivor with friends. I've developed the mindset that I have to go into every game thinking I'm about to get bullied and harassed by survivors just to lessen the blow. It's demoralizing, stressful, and simply not fun.
---
Dw though, in this situation BHVR is going to punish you for their shitty game design!
---
It's probably from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ8ntmZ8WtQ) video.
---
As a survivor I've found some use in it, but more often than not the killer's going to land a hit on me anyway because I positioned wrong, or camp (probably the best decision). I was surprised by how many times the killer didn't see me, though.
---
My current build is based off my failure to successfully hook tech, and I've been having more fun with that.
---
The archive challenge are complete trash in every way and the reward for completing them is abysmal.
---
It's cross play from steam and Microsoft so that's not even a valid reason. Yeah idk why. Steam is far superior. Lol
---
I agreed with removing omega blinks, the power change was unnecessary and honestly more annoying than anything and fucked up my muscle memory. Its a bit better now I guess but its still fucking me up a lot when I hit someone and I can't follow up and make me lose LOS of them because fatigue + speed burst + walls everywhere
---
DS isn't toxic at all lol. We have our meta perks while you have yours such as Ruin, BBQ ETC.
---
&gt;I don't get to choose what side I loop or how I loop it, the Killer decides and I have to react and loop the tile as best I can
---
That's the same for killers too. If a survivor runs to a god loop, your only choice is to run the loop or leave.
---
Yup! It timed me out and took all my points :D
---
The layout and spawns.
---
The denial here is strong
---
How does one do the generator in the Thompson house as safely as possible? I feel like if the killer finds me while I'm up there it's an easy down because they get a free hit. Should you be doing this gen ASAP or later in the game?
---
Two story lerys, pls no.
---
A lot of people in red ranks have a huge ego and think that they’re the best player ever, so when they win they feel the need to rub it in their opponents face. When they lose, they can’t accept they played poorly so they try to find an excuse to make themselves feel better.
---
and he has bond

Last year is back though, and on steam now
---
absolutely sick. i'd get tattoed this rn if i could 🥺
---
&gt; He was being a dick
---
Or maybe he is just a newbie default Dwight who got a little too excited/nervous. Not everyone is a dick :P
---
Literally an innocent suggestion. Idgaf otherwise.
---
I played freddy before he became popular.
---
Yea cos Discord was a mistake and it certainly wont kill DBD with such a fucked start
---
For sure
---
Whether more buildings spawn on the left/front/right of the school. They're fairly similar. The most notable difference is which side of the school the house basement generators spawn.
---
The game is fun though, and either its gonna pull a deathgarden or be actually played. We'll see I guess
---
New balanced landing buff
---
That’s not the problem I have a friend who is so damn funny immersed they will sit in the corner of the map behind a tree for 10 minutes
---
Cool.
---
Did you just ask him to prove his imagination?
---
Dude, noice. I was so stressed out watching this 😂👍
---
Ruin gets cleansed within 0.01 seconds of the match starting anyway
---
How do I reduce lag when I'm playing a killer game?  I'm legit teleporting everywhere and I don't know what to do.  Standard settings, ultra graphics if that helps.  Thanks.
---
Yep, it’s pretty sad they get that pissed at a game just because I sacrificed them. I either get called a tunneler or a camper. One or the other. Next I’ll just reply “lol”
---
Is that screenshot from a Monto video 😂😂😂?
---
We are leaving racism behind in 2019!
---
probably shouldn’t have camped the pallet but yeah that was bullshit
---
It is a pretty toxic perk just as NOED is. It’s just a fact lol.
---
You and me both I was just yelling at my brother crawl to the door 😂
---
Guys stop downvoting him it’s obviously sarcasm, what the fuck?
---
the first farming game I played was hilarious I wasn’t sure what was happening at first
---
I'm not going to open the thread to see if you already got an answer.
---
A good team running all of that would escape before he even makes it to T3 lol
---
Yeah yeah I know, I usually don’t. c:
---
Die
---
To be fair, I also thought the people in this forum would know better since I'm going with the assumption they actually played the game enough that repeated Light burn was bonkers. Even I never got this kind of response in either the Steam or Official DBD forums.
---
Lesson learned I guess.
---
[NO](/intensifies)
---
&gt; Which is why it's pointless to do what they want because they would never give you the same courtesy.
---
\+1000
---
Wow, that game was crazy. 2 Kobe's and you all managed to escape! Nice job
---
I might run a killer around for a long time or get "clutch" plays such as a flashlight save or get flashlight saved for an escape but I will absolutely never go out of my way to shit on a killer by teabagging or playing arrogantly. I play pretty much 50/50 killer, survivors so I understand that at least how I feel simply them getting way like that is annoying but them acting like pieces of shit along the way really does not feel good.
---
dead by daylight used to be a VERY broken game
---
there used to be infinites and insta-blinds
---
I was rank 17 (hiatus off killer for a while) and I had to deal with a rank 4 SWF. (Still bodied them) But it's rough.
---
Lol that was priceless.
---
When it's not really about salt, and more about the meme, it's ok in my books. 👌
---
That was awesome! Serves him right for camping with noed
---
I like the 3 gen endgame idea, what perks should I have for that?
---
4 stealth killers. Michael (he's a stealthy stalky boi), Ghostface, Pig and Wraith. No need for addons unless you want to do scratched mirror
---
How did you get severely punished. You placed third out of everyone
---
Farm iridescent shards.  The best way to do so is to hop into a lobby, then tab out.  The amount of xp you get all depends on how long you've spent in game.  If you can, play trapper, throw on unnerving presence and distressing for even more stall potential while not playing.
---
For various reasons. To goof off with teammates, to thank them for healing me or unhooking me, greet them at the start of a match.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and the highest rank i get is 11, i BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
lol congrats! i have all killers, dlc included, at p3 50 and i have every female survivor but claudette and jane (the fat one?) at p3 50
---
Also if you want to hook more people don't Mori the guy
---
[Mikey was a good boy this year](https://i.imgur.com/P118uoc.jpg)
---
Remember when brand new parts just finished gens instantly?
---
Its obviously good tho lmao
---
3 mins for cruel limits is insane. Maybe a 1m/1m30 at most tbh
---
Just because perks exist doesn't make it a valid stratergy, survivors can build around wiggling but it isn't a valid strategy at all.
---
If you like getting a low amount of blood points, depipping and staring at a screen then it could be valid I guess.
---
i like it to learn ahead of time for example that the next challenges begin on jan 7 (i hope thats true)
---
Artist: *makes something literally perfect*
---
Artist: Man, this is bad
---
hooks are gone for what 2 min barely? it is quite shit tbh even if all of them bring sabo and not no mither then slugging is easy win
---
Wtf happened I think I lost it too
---
That's great
---
good to know, doesnt change my opinion tho, gotta see that vod later, they are for sure the most smart killer players out there, must be a good info
---
LOL My birthday is in a few days, Jan fourth and I was born in 93 so I guess I do gens which I actually do haha and I'm a Claudette main.
---
Family and friends even though I only get to see some of my family during the holidays and some of my friends can get annoying sometimes its still fun hanging with them even when its on a hook. And the none toxic survivors and killers who are willing to give someone the hatch even when you potatoed all match.
---
Nooooo my boi
---
The archives are shit, but let's be real, that's not the only way to do it. You can complete the challenge without fucking the game for people who are also trying to do challenges.
---
Woah woah woah, don’t be calling my ghosty boy a scumbag. That’s clown’s job
---
Just saving space. Meta perks is more accurate
---
1. Once the doors are open you anyone can escape at any time. Many survivors however choose to wait until they're sure everyone else will get out before leaving themselves. Of course you don't have to do that, play as selfishly or altruistically as you wish.
---
2. When you have perks equipped, most will function automatically though many require certain conditions to be met to activate and some are more obviously activated than others.
---
For example: the perk Spine Chill let's you know if the killer is looking in your direction within a certain distance. It activates by "lighting up": the icon for the perk on your screen will appear faded or darkened initially but the colors will become more vibrant when activated.
---
Other perks have a cooldown preventing them from triggering again for a time. This will usually be indicated by the perk icon displaying a clock-like wipe effect (you'll know it when you see it) until it's ready to be used again.
---
The only perks I can think of that require you to press a button to activate are Dead Hard (dash while injured) and Diversion (throw a pebble to distract the killer)
---
You ever have any other questions, feel free to ask, many on this sube will be eager to help you. Also, every Tuesday the sub has a "no stupid questions" thread which always has useful information in the comments.
---
Good luck in the Fog!
---
Settle down noob3
---
yeah, but slugging isnt fun and if everybody starts slugging then survivors will counter with unbreakabill and perhaps even no mither, and hangmans turns it from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, plus with several hooks every ,atch being sabod it can make a MASSIVE difference
---
*eats your intestinal tract*
---
Congrats!
---
Jane is not fat lol
---
She's #THICC
---
I play a lot of Nurse/Spirit/Doc (Doc is getting reworked soon so I'm kinda hyped too!), though I started picking up Ghostface and he's fun! If you want a challenging killer to learn, go Nurse imo. More laid back I'd say Doc/Ghostface and a little more focus I'd say Spirit
---
unbreakable is what I like to call the least chance to save a team compared to all other perks survivors can use and it is meta so I expect it and slugging isnt fun sure but counterplaying situations isnt always fun. Also id rather use my current build and just have fun with STBFL and watch them suffer instead of running hangmans trick at least that is my opinion IF it is sabo related
---
I got it a while ago, I don't really remember.
---
is survivors doing the behind the hooked person count as an exploit?
---
I wanna play against Spirit :( I can't seem to find any lol. Same for Nurse. Only Michaels, Wraiths, Clowns and Plagues with the occasional Legions. Feelsbadman
---
I agree with out it we can only juke and sometimes it’s not enough
---
They don’t understand 😂 it’s whatever
---
Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
People saying F13 would kill DBD are eating their words. Hard. DBD has like 4x the playerbase than it did at launch and F13 is dead.
---
I don't blame either of them. It was a good game with no toxicity. Yui had just found a flashlight and saved her teammate from death! So she just flashlight clicked out of excitement.
---
Same goes for Claudette, she thought she was dead and probably freaked out when she was saved. But, she was arrogant and that caused her demise
---
Yeah, Reddit is fucking weird.
---
you use your chainsaw to down spacific survivors 25 times each, claudett, jake, dwight, and meg. I believe you can only get 1 chainsaw down on each survivor in that match to count, but that could be completely wrong.
---
No, its not mori's
---
I mean. That ones latency. Hitboxes/hurtboxes don’t typically randomly enlarge and he was hit through a pallet that was halfway down so the hitbox should’ve contacted the pallet. Where the game thinks the killer is vs where the survivor is is what the problem is. And it got a lot worse when dedicated servers initially dropped.
---
for realizing that material things arent important at all and started living way better
---
You obviously just got outplayed.
---
Yeah which is the only reason I usually don’t. If I’m close to a 4k during a normal game I’ll usually give hatch but if 3 people dc early on giving the last surv the hatch means I depip so I don’t.
---
you will get the boost but not the heal
---
ik but it is just funny when I heard it like F13 was shit
---
no that's Feng Min looking down on racism cuz that shit's wack
---
That's a really pretty Nurse. Not smart but good cosmetics taste.
---
lmao, i like going against all killers, spirit is really scary to face, may be a bit overwhelming if played right but that just makes it more fun
---
I ABSOLUTELY misread this as "shirtless myers, quentin, and freddy cosmetics" and was baffled
---
*Cums*
---
Said the same thing! The head is the White Rose Gauze skin and the dress Lady Lunatic. I was immediately impressed lmao
---
I dunno, maybe I just get idiot survivors, but I personally haven't had near as many problems on Ormond has I have on Haddon. I was speaking from experience.
---
Yea i just hit rank 15 on ps4 and im doing worse and worse every match lol
---
It’s true but still don’t I don’t  do it because I know how unfun going against it is
---
There were screenshots of Kyle Gallner and Mat talking about it but we haven’t heard anything else since…
---
This for DBD,BL3,And,R6S For me
---
Ik :(
---
before i get into this i dont play freddy often, so i will be saying just basic killer stuff here.
---
pallets that are REALLY good you want thrown down and destroyed ASAP as these can cause problems when not dealt with
---
if the survivor is noticing you being safe on a pallet just go through and dont be safe and you will likley get a hit, switch it up
---
if you think another survivor will flashlight save or pallet save go up to the downed survivor, look down, then look up and if somebody tried to save you can chase them
---
if survivors are saving REALLY fast then stick around a hooked survivor for a short bit, so if they do try and save fast you get a new chase reallly fast, however dont stay too long cause they could be doing gens still
---
again very basic, you probably know all these but this is here just in case
---
That’s the build I use. I need to get better at teleporting. I fake teleport way too much trying to draw them out.  
---
  
---
Thanks for the help.
---
That's awesome - what button would you press to activate a perk which needs activation?
---
That's an intentional change by the devs, per their explanation [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/523225267), 1hr1m20s.
---
I watched that whole thing. Great video. Thanks for sharing and for the advice.
---
love how every time someone posts about farming 7  people insist it's boring and hate it.
---
**B** **I** **G**
---
It’s a perk to challenge tunneling killers, it’s not toxic or a crutch. It’s not the same as NOED at all.
---
I main ghost face and I have an extra small pp so checkmate.
---
You’re kibda right!
---
Recommending a pacifist approach to playing killer shows that not only are you likely a survivor main but also a sadist. Your just in it for the torture and bp. But let me ask you this if the objective of the game is kill the survivors and you intentionally ignore it what's the point? I agree ranks are garbage but getting bp is to get stronger - what's the point if your not trying?
---
Also by not killing your allowing trash survivors to ascend ranks and then get stepped on. I guess what you get is a feeling your actually good because your games are always low ranked . . . idk.
---
1v1 on rust old school style
---
Too busy making broken killers. No money in reworks
---
Leaning from the climbable Rock behind the carriage in crotus prenn
---
There's really no "generic" gen regression perks, but there's plenty of perks that punish healing - and there's always No One Escapes Death to help out at endgame.
---
Rancid abboitore, the main building with the busted ass loop that can be considered an infinite

What cursed image have you brought to this land?
---
The gen speed is def not too fast lmao,you prob only have like 200 hours
---
Wait people actually think keys are OP? I don’t understand am I missing something?
---
Ok.
---
The piping system is getting overhauled what isn’t is the fact that it’s not bannable
---
jesus christ man
---
I never said it’s a good strategy because it isn’t, for both survivors and killer, the survivors could get so many gens done while the killer only gets a single kill.
---
Wait so he’s allowed to belittle that salty survivor? But when I posted something about someone threatening to DDOc me and I posted the messages it gets reported as shaming?
---
One thing about being a killer. show no mercy because survivors won't do the same for you
---
Spoke with a survivor when I was playing rework nurse after not playing her for months. I was able to down him after the gates were open so I camped him as it was a free kill. He got salty and said that "I could have tried and go after somebody else" so yes they want a free unhook and a easy win
---
I can't because I agree. It encourages toxic gameplay too :/
---
Maybe that wouldn't happen if he/she didn't camp the damn pallet
---
Can I see?
---
You connection was probably horrible as fuck and they could barely walk much less do anything else.
---
Sometimes, when the stress of trials get to me, I throw Insidious on Bubba. Now, I know what you're thinking, "oh wow another basement face camping Bubba," but let me tell you, I dont roll that way. Instead, I sit behind one of the walls and wait. Whichever wall is closest to the chest. I've figured out the perfect angle to see the stairs from both walls, and keep as much of my body hidden as possible.
---
And then I wait.
---
Sometimes 2 gens pop. Sometimes all of them. But every time, without fail, someone enters the basement. And that's when I spring into action. Sometimes it's a hasty Feng, confident in her safety as she sprints down the stairs towards her loot. Then she sees me. And you know what I do? I shake my head slightly.
---
Sometimes they run off in fear. Other times they seemingly drop their controller. And even fewer are brave enough to approach me. And the bravest of the few? They have the pure courage to do the unthinkable.
---
They poke the Tum.
---
I like those games.
---
~~But if you so much as touch that chest I will chainsaw you down in a heartbeat and hook you.~~
---
There's no special perks involved, you'd just run your standard Plague build and be sure not to let them work on your 3-gen.
---
What perks are you normally running, and which killers do you have access to?
---
Sorry he was face camping
---
A good killer is going to find survivors. And if he’s only finding a few they will die first. And then he will eventually find these immersed players that probably can’t loop the killer. These immersed survivors probably will get more points due to the fact they hide and unhook taking no chases which just means sandbagging teammates. They will also probably get more pips and ultimately a better rank all for being an urban evading bot.
---
So please repost him
---
*devours your sweet delicious seed*
---
BHR: looks perfectly fine to me
---
I might be making save the best for last my main stay perk, I enjoy how fast the recovery is on swings, it just kinda looke cooler on how fast it is on Michael.
---
What happened in the end game chat? did he just dc or was he salty?
---
I say oni
---
This outplay is so sad, can we nerf legion again?
---
I play with my SOs cousins and they do this. But they’re the sweetest kids I swear. Their rationale is that it’s funny and the killer and them get more bloodpoints by being near each other. I’ve told them to stop doing it so we will see if they pick up on the fact that I don’t do it.
---
There are some little shits online for sure. But don’t assume all of them are. Like I said my cousins are teenage boys that are like incredibly nice. You wouldn’t even believe me how nice and well behaved they are. They just think it’s hilarious but not in a mean way. I’m not sure you’ll even be open to hearing me out or care. But I tried at least.
---
We can’t speak to each other on the switch.  Sometimes I wish we could.  But then sometimes I think it’s a blessing that we can’t after seeing some of the things I’ve seen.  I’m generally a very lighthearted player, I’d hate for someone to verbally jump me.  From what I’ve watched on YouTube videos, I don’t think at all like survivors presume the killer is thinking.  When someone gets a flashlight save off of me or stuns me with a pallet, I’m like “oh good job! I suck at that as a survivor!”  I also think the whole disconnecting thing is absolutely ridiculous. The first game I played on the switch and the one I played the most has a disconnect penalty. I also don’t think people disconnect on the switch as much as they do on other platforms. I like coming here and being able to learn the etiquette. I was doing several things wrong.
---
It was an intentional change by the devs, as they explained in [the Q&amp;A](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/523225267) (around the 1hr9m20s mark).
---
Yeah if you have patience, spirit is loads better. But if you want a fun lesser version of Hillbilly then Oni is the way to go.
---
both are great, id say spirit is more fun
---
Pallets are a high commodity on certain maps. Don’t throw them aimlessly
---
Some will. Most, of course, won’t. But, like I said, that Meg was meme’ing and let me hit her a bit. It was just a fun game. I’m glad not everyone is toxic
---
Its just as bad survivor solo queue.
---
Without checking a locker/sound notifications, how can a killer know if a survivor is hiding inside?
---
DS is still very strong, because it punishes Killers for _not_ tunneling in cases. I literally had a situation where someone farmed in my face, and I chased, downed, and hooked the unhooker. Came across a healthy survivor, chased and downed. I picked them up and BOOM, DS. I was blown away. Recorded the match, went and checked, 56 seconds had passed in that case. The simple fix for DS is remove it once you're healed. Because if someone has, say, We'll Make It, you can get healed near instantly and still have tons of time.
---
Face camping is not reportable or ban worthy. Also you aren’t allowed to post gamer tags so this will most definitely be removed.
---
literally the 3rd rule in this sub says you cant post this.
---
I’ll never understand how an entire community can get so triggered over someone pressing their control key over and over again. Our bar for what’s actually toxic has sunk really low.
---
Not to mention these immersed players will probably be working on a safe gen on the outside of the map. That mentality is trash. It’s just like I’m the end game...let’s say 1v1 and killer finds hatch. You find the nearest door and open it half way until you hear him coming. Do you think they will just leave since they can’t find you? That’s just like every other trash survivor. I’ve seen a hand full fake one door and run to the other.
---
I have access to all killers and the current build I'm running now is corrupt intervention, infectious fright, devour hope, and Thanataphobia.
---
I don’t know how but this took a long time to make
---
twerk
---
Spirit, she has three good perks and good add ons that make her great in any rank.
---
99% of the time I get sacrificed it's because of another survivor running right into the last gen that's an inch away from popping.  The other 1% is survivors body blocking me on loops, and next to palletes.
---
As killer I always get cocky toxic swf groups that send me hate mail when I 4k, or send me toxic crap when I don't.  I hate survivors from both sides.  They are the worst.
---
getting people sick is VERY important, it makes them 1 hit, loud, and infect everything and everybody else. if you are at a rank where people clense often run addons that shorten the time it takes to use pool of devotion so you cn do it mid chase if passing by. you can hit multiple survivors with it however you cant hit 1 survivor twice with a single use so its best to use short charges as to not have to wait for the full thing to go out. Also cooldown addons are very usefull as it shortens the time you are slowed after throwing up. i would recomend staying away from the charge addons as if they dont clense you wont be puking often and if they do clense you dont want to charge longer then needed. try and only puke when you know you will get a hit with corrupt cause you can waste a lot of time with bad timing. apple addons help so you can have corrupt even of they dont clense. if they are not fully infected puke on things they use or looping you around to increase it. fully sick survivors can also give you info on where they are by infected gens, lockers, windows, and pallets. you can puke on gens at the start of the match and you will know when a survivor touches one of the infected gens, works great with intervention. You can use how loud they are during chases and just finding them normaly. relize corrupt purge is EXTREMLY POWERFUL ive won several games from a single use of it. Oh and if you damage a gen almost done while noboy in infected you can puke on it and know exactly when it is biend done again, and if they dont touch it, it will lose progress
---
perk i would recomend are ruin/intervention, brutal strength (pallets are a pain), now the last two perks are wierd, if you are a high enough rank where people dont clense, running thanataphobia and/or blood echo is can be really good, but things like enduring+spirit fury could work, bbq could be a 3rd as it is for most people, but a last perk could be enduring, bamboozle, or anything to help with chases
---
Dude that’s what I mean. And they don’t understand that. Sometimes we just don’t wanna deal with toxic, teabagging survivors. Not all of us have the patience for it
---
Is the rework next week or just the chase music?
---
I thrive for the satisfaction of sacrificing the toxic survivor. Whatever it takes!!
---
Holy crap that is awesome! He did an amazing job!
---
How old are you
---
Tapp or Franklin go first because of...well...ahem...you know...
---
dont cleanse, her ability is worthless if no one does it, you just have to be injured all game

Oink oink boah

---
Try to go without cleansing for as long as possible. When you're running from her, make sure you're never just going straight. Make a lot of Bob's and weaves to make her purging harder.
---
He actually was a good sport. He was afk for two gens and I guess just went for the meme win. I asked if he was doing his noed challenges and he was like nope just trying to "max the last of my rift"
---
Fuck yeah! I got it on my 3rd try tonight and it was a huge relief! GG and GL to everyone out there who hasn’t gotten it yet. Persevere and keep going for it ❤️
---
No I watched those whole thing. You tried to flashlight the back of his head XD. I see why he got a 3k.
---
Isn’t it a doc perk?
---
Or trapper
---
I’m sure they’re lovely and mean no harm. They will just be having fun like you said. 
---
They’re the exception though, the majority and nearly all players doing this are trolling. One of the reasons why dc was such a problem is killers had enough of trolls t bagging at pallets and exit gates.
---
Damn, son
---
I played Nurse twice and never even picked anyone up. I don’t know if it’s just on the switch but she’s really hard to control.
---
I got farmed by a Kate because the killer was doing a mission.....at least message me first before I decide to waste my items and an offering. I came across the same player the next day and proceeded to hook her in basement and face camp the bitch. Needless to say she was about as happy as I was after she farmed me.
---
Trapper, yes
---
You can leave the game early if enough people are dead. Also if killer finds the last-man-alive hatch and closes it so that they can patrol exit gates, a key comes in SUPER clutch in the end game collapse. Don't underestimate how useful a key is.
---
People keep talking about how Quintin need a redesign on his face but does no one under stand that he can't go to sleep in his lore? He goes to sleep and Freddy will kill him so he is constantly running on caffeine and pills and shit.
---
Hi! I'm fairly new to playing dbd routinely and I'm really enjoying it. But there were instances like today. I had 3 back to back matches with all of the killers basically camping. One would hook and guard the survivor until sacrificed; one would down a survivor, bring them to the basement, hook them, and stand in the proximity of the shack to guard them; and the last would hide in the balcony of the theater waiting for survivors to unhook another survivor and jump down to down them. I guess my question is, is it worth saving them? I suck, but do my best to help the team out. Is it even worth it when the killers are camping like that?
---
The title
---
Then he goes to a game and sleep immediately
---
*Starts with an ass ppl*
---
Leaning from behind himself.
---
Fair enough. And I’m not disagreeing. Only wanted to share that it’s not everyone because I don’t want someone to get so mad at them they say something really bad in chat after. ahhh shit... I’m gonna have to heed my own advice aren’t I.
---
I will ensure they don’t do it next time we are all playing together though. Kids need to be taught sportsmanlike conduct. Something I feel is missing lately.
---
13 was swf host
---
Cleanse
---
The first time this happened to me I immediately texted my daughter and yelled “what is this!?” She just simply answered “yeah, she can do that” I got out but I was playing in the middle of the night when I was alone and it almost made me drop my switch.
---
I don't play on PC, but a lot of people say the game runs much smoother on lower graphical settings.
---
oh, this wasnt what i was talking about, im fine with hooked survivors taking a hit, im talking about when you hook a survivor and another survivorm, if they are already there, can get behind them making it nearly impossible for the killer to hit the one not on the hook
---
I’m not exactly sure about when they spoke, but otz played like 10 legion games today to prepare for their challenge.
---
As killer I love blood warden, I've even waited to pickup and hook a survivor till they open the gates so I can just walk up to them as they teabag and then realize theres nowhere to go.
---
As a survivor I love sprint burst. If times right I can take off and be on the other side of the map in seconds leaving the killer in the dust. Usually I'll have speed burst activated and I'll get hit and itll just let me take off fast as fuck.
---
I love the two completely opposite comments. Yours and the person above you.
---
Lean around a doorway in the doctors map just to see clown and oni sumo wrestling ass naked

Yes.
---
Didn’t deathgarden come back?
---
One super dumb thing about Hawkins is the big room in the middle can spawn 2 gens. I played a game of trapper with 4 traps for the memes and 5-genned the survivors. They couldn't get into that room with a trap at all entrances and I could protect the other gens safely myself.
---
Kinda, they rebooted the game, everyone came back for a month and now its shutting down - for good
---
Blood Warden is so iconic, I love it. Also 10/10 username.
---
Finally someone noticed xD
---
Why not just hook her and be done with it? No need to be this toxic.
---
Looks radical, all good artists are overly critical of their work. Hope they can at least take the compliments well! Keep up the amazing work.
---
F13 had it, why not?
---
That was the first one that I’ve seen
---
Hahaha yes I’m so good because I looped on a 0 counter play pallet
---

damn lmao
---
kinda miss it
---
Literally me playing pig on Thompson House today. Loops were torture but good job by the survivors. Many oinks were squeaked.
---
Had a game where 3 of them were teabagging at the gate. Downed the 4th and hooked him...the sheer panic when they were still teabagging and tried to run out but I had bloodwarden...best dbd moment ever. Turned a no kill game into a 4K.
---
I thought the archive would make it cooler with all these challenges but now I'm just playing through frustrating challenges instead of playing for fun like before.
---
Uhmm.. Idc about that insta hatchets if she feels like she needs it to play good it's fine. It's just about the fact that she missed even though I didn't move.
---
On top of that there are perks that are powerful in SWF that don't work in solo queue nearly as well (Prove Thyself) or at all (Object).
---
Oh god i hope pigs chase theme is a version of Hello Zepp
---
Did they change it back to that? I didnt see anything about it going back.
---
Are you sure that's not hentie?
---
That’s hilarious, yeah they should do something about  that. Some maps *cough*azarovs *cough* it’s just so damn easy to defend gens, which I don’t nessesarily mind if I’m on comms, but in solo queue. A killer who is 3 genning and won’t commit to a chase makes me want to leave the game. Because what reason does he have to leave? It’s not his fault 3 gens are 5 feet away from eachother
---
It's a photo of a screen.. what's not wrong with this
---
Camping is a technique that (usually lesser skilled) killers use because it works. They know that someone will come and try to unhook the survivor, and they'll get an easy hit or easy down. You tend to see fewer killers like this at more advanced ranks, but that doesn't help someone who plays casually, or is just trying to work their way up.
---
I'm someone who feels bad for the player if they're being camped by the killer. I'll almost always try to make the save, even though the smart thing to do in a lot of instances is to do gens instead. The term we use around here is "punish the killer for camping". Killers get fewer points from facecamping, but also get fewer kills if the team decides to just finish gens.
---
If a team is coordinated enough, it's possible to get the unhooks and keep the game going for everyone, but there are so many situations where that just isn't possible. Insta-down killers are especially tough to deal with.
---
If anyone gets upset if you don't unhook someone when the killer is camping, just ignore it. It's a personal choice, and no one should fault you if you don't want to set yourself up to be killed.
---
You're not gonna passively get a challenge done that requires the use of a specific perk if you don't use that perk, or finish some of the harder master challenges passively. As opposed to stuff like "break X pallets," which gets done without the player having to alter anything about their playstyle. For rewards, there's also cosmetics through the rift. Also bloodpoints. And I'm pretty sure not everyone stresses out or gets angry over the challenges.
---
that left the usernames, but cropped out the score. WE WANT THE SCORES DAMMIT.
---
It's from ps4 and I just wanted to post this bullcrap
---
Pray that your teammates don’t cleanse.
---
It takes decently skilled survivors to fully leverage Ormond against the killer, faced some good teams on it and it's very crappy feeling.
---
Because you're tilted.
---
Hey I saw that one on r/dbdgonewild
---
O_o I obviously don't play Trapper enough. But still HOPE is a generic perk and I have gotten several survivors up from nothing to 50 and still haven't seen it spawn.
---
Avoid cleansing if no one else is. If people are cleansing, and you feel you need to, then aim to do so in locations away from unfinished gens or hooked survivors.
---
If she gets her corrupt purge and people are rapidly cleansing, stealth is absolutely your safest option. Corrupt Purge lasts for 60 seconds. There's not a good chance you can evade it, but if you can make sure she never finds you when she has it, it'll be for nothing.
---
Watch otz he’ll help you
---
we know the next rift already
---
new players will be sad. there will be character specific ones that require you to, for example, own doctor
---
Delet this
---
Thank you! I don't like to see my teammates hooked and especially being camped against. I'm only a level 16 and rank 17 so I'm still new. But it was absolutely annoying to see. I don't wanna sound like a cry baby, but it isn't fun to play when killers do it. But I still rely my best to save as much as I can. I guess I can just use this as a means of learning to joke killers better and outsmart them. I appreciate you commenting back !! ☺
---
Holy shit bro that’s so awesome
---
It’s situations like this as killer where I like to have mad grit. No one expects it.
---
Depends if you're facing a good play.
---
I'm an excellent M1 killer but a terrible plague. Everytime survivors don't cleanse it's an easy win. Everytime they do, I have to run all the way to get my power, then go back to the survivors, by the time I'm here it's halfway consumed and sometimes I can't even down someone because I suck with it
---
Yo don’t be talking about my boi like that, least my mans can mix a drink. Meanwhile she has the worst case of fatigue I’ve ever seen
---
I dream of space
---
personally, i'd go with spirit; her power feels really rewarding when used correctly and overall she's a cool killer with good perks
---
How so ?
---
RUDE :(
---
*flexes on your corpse because argonians are the superior race*
---
I hate these challenges so much. You are competing against other survivors or killers to do your archives, and you have to depend on luck that matchmaking doesn't screw you, or that no one disconnects. :( Still stuck on tome 3, no way I am getting 4th archive done.
---
He has some good trapper tutorials and if you pay attention to how he plays it’s a big help
---
Not sure how a streamer will help me get Hope on my bloodweb.
---
These are literally my last two challenges.
---
Competing against each other is really bad too. Saving 15 people from unhooks took me 10 games because people keep on instantly saving before I can even get there.
---
Yeah but you can play trapper and get it
---
Didn't take long for them to put the DLC in there, did it?
---
Oh yeah! Definetly!
---
&gt; dead by daylight used to be a VERY broken game
---
It still is but it used to be, too.
---
Can't get hope with the trapper, friend. Not sure what you are thinking.
---
Maaaaaaaybe if she smacked claude first, she could have still picked up dwight. Then with only two to body block perhaps she could have gotten to a hook.
---
Diude idk lmao
---
DS is more powerful than any single killer perk.
---
if you think the game is broken now, be glad you weren't in the fandom in the early days
---
Yes, because everyone on this game is clearly a toxic asshole and you are not encouraging the same behavior for new and experienced players alike.
---
Badham has a lot of safe pallets
---
Kill or let live, dont slug unless you think they have ds, but dont slug just to slug
---
That's a good gaming chair

Ahh I see. So just coincidence then.

---
Placement in a game doesn't matter. I didn't rank up. You obviously think putting a rank 9 killer against a 4 man rank 2 swf is ok so your opinion means dogshit to me.
---
Thana isn't the greatest on Plague - the penalty to gens is negligible, and survivors really won't be healing against you. Consider dropping it for Pop Goes the Weasel, for the long game, or Discordance if you're hoping to get some pressure earlier in the game.
---
Devour Hope is fun, but if you find it's being cleansed too early then you could always trade it out for the other one from the above pair.
---
The other perks are great - Corrupt Intervention means survivors have a smaller play area if they want to do gens, which means you're more likely to find two at a time, and Infectious Fright plays into this too.
---
I don't like it either, *I love it!*
---
Just gimmie that sweet sweet scratched mirror instead.

Is there anyone else out there that’s having problems getting chewed pens for ghostface I’ve gone through 6 level 50 bloodwebs and not a single chewed pen ?

---
WORKING WITH THE KILLER REPORTED.
---
I think the skill gap is freaking humongous for survivors. I play a lot of killer and the difference between a bad/average survivor and a really good one is actually insane.
---
Like I played against someone like zubat and it was extremely frustrating trying to down him. Average survivors are mostly whatever.

---
IKR,when I first saw it I got a little sacred ngl
---
I agree that it isn't fun to play against killers like that. And you're right - by putting yourself in the situation more, you'll get better at getting the difficult saves. Good luck!
---
I got this one on my first try. I got Lery’s and immediately felt discouraged. But I brought Prove Thyself with Bond and just stuck with at least one other teammate and finished exactly 4 gens. I got very lucky.
---
Alright thanks
---
Thank u
---
Fair fair. Thanks for the insight!
---
It says “slug and make them suffer”, implying they slug them and let them bleed out instead of immediately hooking them. That’s a dick move.
---
Same thing has happened in a game before. Was playing plague and I wasn't paying attention to the timer, I felt so bad for that meg.
---
Several things can tip them off. If the Survivor is injured, they make very audible moans that, while muffled, are still noticable. If it was recently, the blood will pool outside the locker for about 5-10 seconds. If healthy, the Survivor still breathes, albeit very quietly. It's often situational awareness and process of elimination. If Hillbilly hooked someone with BBQ and Chili and saw the aura of someone at the shack and chainsawed over there within 5 seconds, but saw no scratch marks and circled the shack already, chances are they hid in a locker.
---
Sure, but like the other guy said, it’s a pretty powerful perk, and a crutch perk as much as NOED. There’s no denying it.
---
Yeah, but but you were veuge enogh to where i wasnt sure, but i agree

Sure it’s a powerful perk but not as much as NOED at all, there really is denying it. NOED rewards you for doing bad while D strike gives you another chance when the killer is being a dick
---
I don't mind flashlights at all, but I have, in the last few days been blinded from behind or the side when facing a wall or obstacle that is taking up 100% of my FOV and then when it ends I'm facing 180 degrees away and it fucking drives me inside. Downing someone in the corner of the map and facing the corner to get blinded from behind some fucking how.

---
Like I said, there's a difference between stealthing and being an urban evading gamer. Of course a good killer will find survivors, but good survivors can hide well enough to A either avoid the killer through prediction or B waste the killer's time. Add that on top to looping skill and maybe stealthing isn't such a bad idea.
---
Love me some big ol tree
---
I thank you
---
That kind of thing is negated by Borrowed Time and either Deliverance or Decisive Strike.
---
Borrowed Time means that, if you unhook a survivor while in the killer's Terror Radius, the survivor can take a "free" hit without actually taking damage.
---
Deliverance gives you a guaranteed self-unhook if you're hooked after unhooking a survivor. Decisive Strike gives you a 60s period after escaping the hook where, if you're downed, you can pass a skill check to stun the killer when they pick you up or grab you.
---
If a killer camps a hook then sometimes it's just best to use the 2 minutes to work on gens - if you're doing the optimal spread (2 sharing a gen, 1 working alone) then in 2 minutes you'll have 4 gens done.
---
Camping killers rely on survivors being altruistic, *especially* survivors that no experience in unhooking and no perks to help them do it.
---
Note that "camping killers" are different from killers that are forced to stay around the hook *because other survivors are running around it*. There's no incentive for them to leave the hook. Spamming crouch from a "safe" distance won't fool them either - if you think you're safe then *they* think you're *very safe*.
---
4k?

Or just balance gens. Let make them take extra few seconds.

---
How was the postgame?
---
I see, I need to save up to get discordance as a teachable. Before you replied to this I managed to get 2 4ks! They constantly cleansed so I had a constant corrupt purge going. And they kept grabbing sick survivors so it was just a constant loop.
---
Artist: draws something good 
---
Also artist: this is shit
---
I'm a rank 14 killer, so not really much of a difference in terms of skill or understanding of the game.
---
That wouldn't fix Ruin
---
By "behind them" do you mean between the hook and the hanging survivor? Can they even unhook from that position?
---
Yeah it’s cool if EVERYONE is cool with it. Every other game I get 4 survivors who wants to farm and stands in front of me to let them farm but I want a regular game so I get no enjoyment out of it. And usually they don’t take the hint after killing them and hooking them.
---
Basement kills are dead zones. You get put in the basement, the killer usually can make it back to the basement before you can make it up the stairs. So yeah. If I notice a killer is only going for basement hooks, I'm staying as far away from the basement as possible.
---
The post is meant to point out the hypocrisy in some peoples mentality, nothing more.
---
Same. It's visually interesting and unique, very different from other maps, and I enjoy the loops.
---
The only thing I'm not a fan of is the increasing impaired vision idea. Not because I think it's a bad idea but because I get really motion sick already from playing against the clown and this would make it worse for people like me lol.
---
Yep, if survivors pick a bad time to cleanse then Plague will have it *very* easy. Hopefully this is you on the upward curve now!
---
Nah, they were just salty for some reason.
---
Thanks.
---
Slim chances but was this on PS4 earlier and you were down while he walked over you for 100feet?

---
She really is
---
fair but people went into a corner and just stood there &amp; teabagged, not doing the objective, sorry if that wasn’t clear in the post obviously you don’t want to get basement hooked lol
---
When they go for an unhook it vacuum's you to the tge left or right but if played correctly the killer cannot hit the survivor behind the hooked one
---
Wait wtf did I just watch??
---
I was honestly confused as hell when I played Jake for the first time with Calm Spirit and he didn't scream.
---
Wtf did I just watch omfg...
---
If everyone wants to farm then sure. If some people want to play the video game that they invested money into for an experience, then no.
---
Slug em and leave em. You don't get the challenge, but you deny them struggle points. And if someone goes for the save, slug them too.
---
Oh SHIT
---
Both perks give you second chances, don’t pretend DS requires skill because it doesn’t, a noob can use DS and win. I’m glad it got nerfed.

This is where the real game begins.

Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.

Sure I throw down every pallet I see even if I’m not in a chase, but does that really make me a bad survivor?

I just had a tame like that. One of the guys was confused because he couldnt get me off the hook when in my screen he was floating in the air by a genny. Next thing he knew he was on the ground without even getting hit, then floated away to a hook and straight to heaven, no struggle no nothing.
---
In the hot fix basment crap. It rolled that back
---
Blame the archives, a lot of the killer challenges are annoying to do normally, but stupidly easy to do when farming. I wish survivors could see my name so i can let them know that I just want 2 basement hooks for a challenge
---
Killer that enjoys farming here, I will never kill a person for not farming, it's a MAJOR dick move. I'll just farm with the guys that want to farm and let the other guy do gens

I think Adam started bagging because he was trying to figure out how to help the trapper out of the trap but then trapper smacked him and he got his feelings hurt. I’m sure trapper was just trying to see if he could interrupt the cycle himself but you know.. the roles are immersive and these things get lost in translation.
---
Yeah, but that's kind of a dick move when people are going for challenges.
---
Practice, and pizza is the only way to learn.
---
What Killer do you play as? The meta varies WILDY between different Killers, with some able to perform well with just general perks
---
And survivors had a challenge to not go down once in a match. Did that make the killers knocking them down dicks? No, it meant the killer was playing the game. And me staying away from the basement because I know where the killer is more likely to be means I'm also playing the game.
---
The survivors in my game were visibly active and could tell what was happening. The Nancy was a pro at teabagging pallets. 
---
The inconsistencies in the game can be pretty rough sometimes though. Personally I experience random frame rate drops more than any other issue. Can really make or break a chase.
---
Man they still go through survivors just as much
---
TBF NOED wouldn't have made any difference to a Bubba

Hahaha I know right.
---
So, just wanted to update. Had a game as survivor where I had a teammate d/c and another afk on first hook (hmmm sound familiar) and the killer was running ruin and we could not find it. 
---
They ended up showing me the ruin. 
---
Let me finish 4 gens
---
And escape
---
Karma? Maybe. Lol
---
What if I like to play all survivors?
---
Yeah slug is a dick move, but I don't give hatch for DC's because I already lost tons of emblem score and BP from the DC's. 
---
It'd be nice if when 3 surv's DC, the last one and the killer got an automatic safety pip, then I'd be fine giving hatch.
---
5 story Lery's, go big or go home

Sweaty P3 ruin/pop spirits in green ranks be wondering why the level 12 megheads are disconcerting

That’s why when I am killer I contact the people in Prematch lobby and ask if they are all cool with it when they go yeah they are cool then yeah we have a fun farm match
---
If it really bothers you just moonwalk then 180 hit them out of the gates
---
Thought this was r/gatekeeping for a moment and was confused to see dbd on in it
---
No, I mean just do a different level that is a different floor of the building.
---
yeah thats the right way to do it instead of just expecting the killer to go with it
---
Killers have no way of knowing you're going for that. But if you play against a killer who  only goes for basements it's pretty obvious what they're doing. I'm not saying let them hook you, but just running to the corner of the map ruins the game for everyone.

I like tru3 but you're kinda right. 
---
Also how do you stalk with GF *effectively?* The only time I can mark survivors who aren't oblivious to their surroundings is by t-bagging, and stalking so they can't break me out. But at that point might as well m1.
---
I never said I run to a corner mate. I said I stay as far away from the basement as possible. I still do gens. 
---
 Just because you're going for a challenge doesn't entitle you to complete the challenge. If I know your challenge is basement hooks, then I know you're patrolling near the basement. Strategy requires I play around that to evade the killer and survive the game.
---
Was expecting phat cocks and ass cheeks but I'm still pleased with the outcome XD

I want voice lines in this game

i made a tier list on how many peoples low effort boring post get removed. You are S tier

People love to blow this whole survive with friends dealio right out of proportion. In reality a killer will probably face an actual sweaty 4 man in 1 out of 20/30 games. Coming from a killer main btw.

But it would maybe fix the game. Ruin is fine, it only bad vs a smaller part of players who know the game, everyone under them struggles.
---
I think it's a problem with the grind. I was faced with ~8 levels to go on my season pass with only a few challenges left that I didn't particularly want to do, but the alternative of playing 10-12 games to gain a single level wasn't exactly appealing. So I did those last few challenges.. and I farmed pretty much every single one of them. Now I'm half as many levels away from reaching level 70, but I played half a dozen illegitimate games in the process. It's an easy choice to make and you're right it's ruining the game, if only temporarily.

2 in a swf were in it, but instead they both wore the shirt, dweard, and baggy pants. After I both basement hooked them they kept trying to escape but not all the way so it was full of grunting. 10/10 game

Who do you main? I’m playing Ghostface. I like him. I’ve yoinked people off the gens which is always funny. Then I can’t figure out how I did it and fuck up every other chance I get lol

Tenacity is slowly becoming my go to slugging perk. I just feel in the span of 10 seconds or so, Unbreakable is just not helpful. Tier 3 takes a little less than 20 seconds to pick yourself up, and with that time you can be 2/3ds of the way and safely crawl to a teammate with Tenacity instead.

I might do the same for killer perks if this idea is popular :)

I think that at the very minimum Clown's power should work like Doctor's madness. Creating asthma attacks which make survivors reveal their location. That way the Clown's power can work both as tracking and in a chase. I've absolutely no idea why this wasn't base from the very beginning. It's such a simple concept.

I mean, being critical is a very important trait to have to meaningfully improve as an artist

It’s nowhere near similar to NOED. It’s a perk to aid survivors if a killer wants to go after them again. It can be countered easily by slugging / having a timer.

You’re P3 Freddy with teachables from multiple different characters. Clearly you’re just bad at killer don’t blame match making.
---
Lately when I get a DC I just go for my BBQ stacks with two hooks and then find the highest vantage I can and just chuck hatchets for long distance hits. Seems like the survivors usually have fun enough running in circles while I practice my aim and leading shots. Had a good few people tell me they were able to get challenges done from it too which is nice I guess. It just really sucks when someone DCs going down at 5 gens. A 3v1 game at 5 gens is no fun, and I don't want everyone to leave with 11k Bloodpoints is we can all have a decent time and leave with mid 20ks.
---
“Stop camping trash killer. Nice tunnel newbie.”
---
And here I am like, “you’re 7 ranks higher than me... why were we matched together?”
---
*Spams Shirtless Button*
---
i don't know if i'd call this being cocky. if all you do is gens and escape, you aren't gonna get much out of it. going for the save is going to get you more altruism and boldness points and its a lot more fun.
---
I find this funny cause I main claudette and am always doing gens and sometimes I'll be the only one when my teammates are too altruistic
---
Oh please. I can 4k just fine with green ranks. It's clearly unbalanced matchmaking like this that's an issue that needs to be fixed. Or are you saying that a rank 20 going against a rank 1 is fair and balanced? Me being a P3 character with perks from different characters has shit to do with it.
---
So I spawned with other two survivors and we start working on a gen, when we all hear the terror radius and spread out like scared cats only to come back to the gen when we don't hear it anymore

I only just recently got into DBD, and whilst this is prolly kind of off-topic, but this is exactly how I feel about my "guilty pleasure" game called fucking league of legends. I hate it, but love it at the same time, and just keep playing over and over even though I question my sanity every second after each game.
---
I haven't had the pleasure of meeting THAT many toxic people in this game just yet, BUT, the ones that are were really just that. I think even ran into a 4stack survivor team the other day when it was my 2nd killer game. And I ended up just running around 1 dude whilst the other finished 2 gens and quickly a third. I managed to hook her, and they did some kind of crouching in front of the hooks so I couldn't hook, also bodyblocking so I couldn't get to hooks etc. I had never seen this before, neither in m y first game as killer OR subsequent ones (or when I was playing surv for that matter) but they must've felt really prooud of themselves cus the post game lobby chat was....well....lets just say they didn't really make me feel welcomed :P
---
I just answered every trash talking stab at me with kind words and telling them that yeah, I played it bad, and I prolly shouldn't have just followed that one dude, and that I sucked etc. But also cus it was my second killer game and I recently started playing. I can't remember all the slurs and shit they threw my way, but damn was it "fun" Haven't touched the game nor killer after that :P
---
I don’t think it’s bad but if I’m playing killer and I’m not in the mood to farm I’m not going to. Same with survivor, I usually show no mercy.
---
I think as a whole 3genning is fine, killers need some way to defend against the dummy fast speeds of games nowadays, it's just when they spawn in such a way that the killer can just sit there all game and garuntee the win.
---
Hawkins is kinda hard to 3gen when they're in different rooms, but 2 gens in 1 room that only has 3 exits is not okay lmao
---

I like where your head is at, mostly. I would argue though that giving stronger odds for unhooks is a feels bad move. Survivors already have deliverance and borrowed time making unhooks fairly easy. It can be hard work at higher ranks to hook a survivor. Kobe’s should remain a last ditch effort. The other change is to Deja Vu. The whole point of that perk is to show you gens far away so you can avoid “3 gen”-ing yourself. You can tell thats kinda the idea when you read the flavor text. So that perk showing the three furthest from you and your eyes seeing the close ones is kinda how that perk works.
---
Fr tho nice clip
---
pah thank you v much
---
Tried to do Myers achievement, last guy kept running into lockers until endgame. Couldn’t do anything about it.
---
Also the only way to fix vigil is just to delete it. Lol Make it go away. Or just completely rework it. Like “the killers aura is visible to you for two seconds every ten seconds that the killer is in a chase with another survivor” so you can like “keep a vigil over them”. I dunno your the master reworker. Lol
---
If they could see through walls and reveal auras. They definitely shouldn't be faster than the survivors. It would do away with surprising survivors and most killers would just use the power to find a survivor and then just do a normal chase. 
---
 That said, because the killer would either have to match speed or be slower, they would need an instant down move. Otherwise they would never catch a survivor.
---

I didn’t mean to say I thought the 3 gen strat should be removed. 3 gen is a completely valid strat. I love going against it with my friends, a 20-30 minute game of hit and runs, for both sides, on and off gens. Patience and persistence is the main determining factor on the outcome, it can be fun. Unless it’s a doctor. Fuck that. There’s a strat where you can literally take the game hostage and indefinitely prevent 3 gens from getting progressed
---
To much paint, not enough Frank! (Yes I hate myself)
---
I think it is a bit overcomplicated, but Clown definitely needs a little bit of love. The gas dispenser is definitely a good idea, but I imagine the devs wouldn't likely have a '4 different types of bottle' thing in game. I feel like it'd end up based on addons.
---
And they say xbox is more toxic. I've never gotten death threats. That's shitty. Happy birthday.
---
If all they added was the blink cooldown, 5 blink nurse would have been dead anyways.
---
Waiting to recharge 5 blinks could have been weaker than no addons.
---
The T bag otherwise known as BM is a way survivor's can show their dominance at the end of long match. Their bm can lead to their untimely demise is caught by the killer other than that they are unstoppable and run rampant across dead by daylight servers.
---
 great work &lt;3
---
Agree with most of these changes, pretty great stuff here. I’ll just cover my more sincere thoughts.
---
Babysitter change doesn’t fix what’s wrong with the perk. Tanking a protection hit for a exhaustion reduction sounds good, but it doesn’t actually work when the whole point is for the other guy to get away. It could see some use, but I’d prefer an entire rework.
---
DH change is terrible, it’s a great utility perk as is, and helps prevent 3 gens and hard counters NOED, DH and rewards you if you power through Ruin. Doesn’t need any change atm.
---
Diversion change is fun, but doesn’t address the main problem: like Stake Out, it’s impossible to get stacks with no TR, so ya useless against a good amount of killers. I’d much prefer an alternative way to get stacks than a flat buff.
---
Pharmacy is great. Any alternative BP perks are always welcome.
---
Second Wind should just be half a heal. I don’t like your change, because if you get BT saved, hit, and run away, the faster proccing screws you over and the heal is wasted on removing the deep wound state, so you’ll still be injured.
---
Streetwise would be crazy with a toolbox. But for other items it’s a nice utility buff.
---
Vigil is just in need of a rework. It’s too awkward and outdated, no proposed change will fix how situational it is.
---

If they all have sabo, they all know to bring unbreakable and/or no mither.

If I'm queuing to play it's because I want to play the game. When people farm it just means I have to queue again to find a game. It's really annoying...
---
Well the idea of a sonar tracking killer is cool the idea of it being based around scratched mirror is very bad imo. The reason no one really uses the scratched mirror build in actual games is bc it isnt that great and its only playable on like three maps. Its a fun build u can definitely win with but its a meme at the end of the day. That plus the fact that 70% of the maps are so huge it takes a normal movement speed killer like twenty seconds to go across them would make the killer ur suggesting one of the worst in the game due to the fact time is not on the killers side. Killers like hag,spirit,huntress and nurse make up for their slow movement by having powers that pressure the whole map at a distance. (Hag can teleport, nurse can blink, huntress can do cross map hachets, spirit can phase) if you tried playing a slow killer with no active map pressure on say a red forest map it would be a automatic loss for the killer.

Meanwhile they hiding how bad their system is by removing the visible ranks in the lobby so we won't try a different one when the divide is too great. That's what we call Horseshit.

---

Cant 1 hit kill all 4 survivors in 2 minutes then they must be trash...good ol killer mains. Want their only goal gifted to em. All 4 survivors should stand in a circle spinning so you can kill em then the game would be great right smh
---
nope. The detectives hunch is like another fat nerf to the trapper lmao. Survivors already have 2 perks to counter him and the toolbox to sabotage. Another perk will ruin him more more than he already is
---
As an artist, I relate. Your work ALWAYS looks like shit to you.
---
Nope - Everyone should just blast through gens with ease then. The hook player needs to take one for the team. 3 survive.

Freddy can literally become any killer and it would make sense
---
Toxicity is toxicity. A game like league has a lot more players and therefore the chance of encountering a toxic players goes up, but they don't act any worse than a toxic person in a game with a smaller base of players. The toxicity is the same, you just see more or less of them.
---
Spine chill has no cool down, plus it gives you a 6% boost on anything you're doing, including vaulting, so it's extremely useful. 
---
Premonition has the same range as spine chill and has a cool down of 45 seconds at lvl 3 I believe. The power is useful as you can plan ahead of the killer, but unless they increase the range and/or shorten the cool down I can't justify using it.

---

---
You might not agree with saying its unfair and bla bla bla but this is intended matchmaking. 
---
If they make things stricter than 6 ranks, it will increase queue time and people also complain about those.
---
We don't speak of such things...
---

They said that indoor maps feature higher kill rates, but in the same November post they indicated that the average survival rate (ranks 1 and 2 combined) for survivors is actually 70% (it goes up to 80% for survivors who stay at red ranks, they say rank 2 is lower at 60% because of rank 1 survivors depipping, but the point is that the survivors who remain at rank 1 and pip still push it up more than depips account for).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But they also say that all killers average over 50% kill rate - how is that possible? Their own numbers indicate rank 2 survivors **despite depips from rank 1** have a 60% survival rate in the very same post as "all indoor maps are deadly" and "all killers are over 50%" from November 2019 and that it skyrockets up to 80% at rank 1.
---
BHVR doesn't balance for the skill ceiling, they balance for the skill floor - and while the current state of dedicated servers has made windows more unreliable, Lery's spawning 2 or 3 per room guaranteed now means you've basically got an infinite jungle gym if you're skilled enough to adapt to the layouts on the fly.
---
The skill ceiling for survivors completely and mechanically trounces most killers, Freddy being one of the rare exceptions (Freddy's kill rate actually equals the rank 1 survival rate, 80% each) due to having both a teleport and snares to map pressure and anti-loop at the same time.
---
According to the November 29th stats, Pig is stronger than Nurse by nearly 6%, and in fact everyone but Demogorgon and Clown are better than Nurse, with Leatherface as strong as Myers and Hag within 1% of Pig and 3% of Leatherface.
---
Would you really believe that Hag and Leatherface are within an acceptable variable of each other, and are statistically pretty much equal in strength and both equally good at killing survivors? 'Cause they are - according to stats that I question.
---
I meant I'm breathing heavy because I'm a survivor main and that's a hell of a run lol. I too play both sides, a lot more survivor lately tho
---
BFG Division would be better since no lyrics :)
---
The difference is that no one really likes Lery's (whether killer or survivor) except for Myers with specific addons (and even then he can use them on other indoor maps), even Nurse has trouble there because of all the ridiculous amounts of clutter and walls unless you're even better at Nurse than your average already scarily good Nurse.
---
But survivors love Haddonfield/Ormond, so you have more complaints overall for Lery's.
---
Which would completely ruin the game and be an instant win against Trapper, Hag, and Freddy, and do nothing against any other killer.
---
Why in the world would that be a good thing to add?
---
His right arm could use some work but this is already amazing
---
Thats what happens when someone in the 6 gap brings a low rank swf in
---
&gt;Totally no rank 20 in that match
---
This is how SWF works now. Rank 20 was probably with someone else in the match unless you were in SWF with the other 2.
---
It’s frustrating to see but rank is a huge mess in general.
---
Half of the red rank survivors don’t belong in red ranks and a lot of purple, green, and yellow ranks have been red rank at some point and probably would be if they played enough. 
---
At this point matchmaking for ranks 1-15 essentially acts as an unranked mode.
---
I actually have to mind game the killer, except that one loop around the Study (Office, Library). All around I have always found it a very balanced map.
---
Doctor and Feng are a full priced chapter on pc. Spark of Madness $7-$8
---
Use the map
---
First off, having 3 dispensers is a lot as you can easily cover 2 gens with a size that big, even then it'd still be easy to set up a three gen with 3 dispensers, one at each gen. 
---
Second off, clown isn't a weak killer, he's just really boring to play. Having all the bottles to cycle through may help that but it's still basically the same effects. 
---
The dispenser doesn't sound that fun to deal with as survivors, but also doesn't seem that strong unless you're in a 3-gen situation, which isn't that fun to do as killer or survivor.
---
It would be pink and killer have mori so it is fair
---
He shot me down
---
Thanks for the comment!
---
I’m down to clown... or trapper... or...
---
How do you know they’re swf? Cos they load in at the same time? Devs changed so solo survivors load in at the same time to discourage lobby dodging.
---
I don't like cooperating with killers because it's awkward and boring. They won't kill me and I won't disconnect so I do it to get my points and go. I've had killers do what you did and it's shitty because the killer already ruined my experience and now we don't even get the escape. It's unsportsmanlike.
---
Map cant see traps
---
You can use the perk Small Game to do this.
---
I’m just a Claudette main because killers somehow always manage to walk past her and she’s a female so I can actually see the game instead of having 60% of the screen takin up by a chunky man.
---
His portals feel too clunky and slow for me though...
---
Uslesse
---
ok
---
Sounds disgusting mate, sry for you if you get such "teammates". Why dont you look for Groups in Discord ? There are plenty of people playing on PS4 and even Switch. You can at least have a short look at people and maybe talk for a minute
---
Just offering that survivor wall hack for all traps
---
Thank you. This game makes me question my sanity some days.
---
My biggest fear is they are changing it to have more safe loops like Macmillan Estate. Since so far BHVR has been proving to favor Survivors, especially SWF at that.
---
Doctor and Lery's are both a balanced killer and map. 
---
Imo maps like Hawkins and Lery's should be used as an example to balancing the other maps in the game.
---
Thanks, I guess?
---
Because people who don't are missing out on some quality art.
---
Oh and a lot of awkwardly forced futa. But occasionally quality art.
---
He didn't need nerfed. The killers are supposed to be broken. He still does his job though even after the fact. If all 4 escape every game its not fun for any of the player base. If all 4 die every game its not fun for 80% of its player base. They have to tread the fine line of broken to make the game worth a shit.
---
Haha you’re so bad at mind games because you didn’t even try them when the wall between us was only a foot high and I could see you the whole time
---
It depends.
---
Are you playing a killer who needs to set up around those three generators in order to snowball later, like Trapper? Having all 4 survivors doing nothing for 2 minutes is amazing for you.
---
Are you a killer like Plague who has to find, infect, break, and hook survivors to get her snowball going? Having all 4 survivors doing nothing for 2 minutes does nothing for you.
---
4 survivors immersing through Corrupt Intervention is basically just delaying the start of the game by 2 minutes - once those 2 minutes are up, it's like you never had the perk, but you got no benefit from it outside of scouting some pallets and checking out the loops (which the survivors have also done, probably while looking for totems to prevent NOED, searching chests, checking to see if you have Ruin, keeping an eye out for other hexes in general).
---
What does Myers get if he runs CI and spends two minutes without finding a survivor because they're immersing through it? He's stuck at EW1 without any stalk, without knowing where they are or knowing which generators they want (aside from one of the three blocked ones as their third or fourth to prevent the 3-gen) and he got no benefit from it, no injuries/hooks/down/stalk/pallet drops/etc.
---
It's because you're a dwight lol
---
What people fail to realize is green ranks barely exist anymore. Green ranks were always red ranks who DC and derank.
---
Nah sorry mate. Your friend is just bad at drawing. tell him to find a new hobby.

Got to boop the snoot for the first time today. It does feel as good as it's made out to be.
---
lmao "and killer have mori so it's fair" shut the fuck up
---
Lmao, ngl, as a rank 8 killer I get rank 15 and 16 survivors
---
Giving dbdgonewild some ideas are we?
---
Yeah, and killers could get one that always shows the location of survivors. It would be a pink offering, so it'd be fair. 
---
 The whole point of traps is to surprise survivors and stop loops before they happen. If survivors could just see the traps they could disarm them before ever needing to be in a chase, stopping the killers ability completely.
---
Ah I see, survivor is more fun but queue times on console suck once you reach red ranks
---
Killer, why did you turn for that flashlight save? Made a sick vid tho
---
I'd rather see 4 flashlights than 4 toolboxes, Prove Thyself and a Shroud of Binding.
---
Nothing says SWF like taking 10 steps and hearing that KERCHUNK before you can do a damn thing about it.
---
They encourage farming purely by virtue of giving you a specific objective. Any kind of objective other than simply playing the game is going to "encourage farming". So the question is, which is worse- to encourage farming, or to never give you anything else to strive for?
---
...why would he not like it
---
Lucky for you! I'm a rank 8 killer I keep getting rank 2 survivors 😂 safe to say the shit on me everytime!  the odd time I'll get rank 8s or lower!
---
The amount of people who think looping is more impressive than hitting hex ruin skill checks is laughable. Supply and demand people.
---
Consider that Myers moves slower than a running survivor when stalking them, this means it is possible to use a small map prop (like one of the taller hay bales, or some of the small pieces in the very center of Lery's) to loop Myers forever without him stalking you (he needs a clear view of you, I can't stalk over thrown pallets even if the survivor is too close to it).
---
This is even more true because Tombstone slows Myers down tremendously, Tombstone+Tuft only works against inexperienced survivors (and obsessions who don't immerse to stop him from getting PWYF tokens from them).
---
You can try it in a custom, if you commit to the stalk instead of M1ing them, they will forever stay out of your LOS except for split seconds (and Tombstone+Tuft needs four EW3 worth of stalk) that don't meaningfully give you any progression towards EW3, particularly since you're slower than they are with Tombstone when in EW1 even when you're not stalking.
---
Survivor addons are more consistently helpful since you can blind the killer when they're locked in animations/use safe pallets to get use from syringes/etc; Myers Tombstone just means you have to force a hit instead of give stalk.
---
I too kick gens that have purple wigs on their side.
---
Well if the rest of the survivors DC I let the last one go no doubt, give hatch or farm the hell out of the match until the doors are powered. Bonus points if I'm Ghostface to peek-a-boo the hell out of that lonely bastard.
---
Why do you feel the need to bm though?
---
Um, no shit? Lol that's kind of what the character is all about. Some psycho/sociopath wants fame and/or revenge, so they go on killing sprees wearing the infamous ghost mask.
---
Like most maps this sub is heavily survivor sided.
---
Now to get all perks. Then you get to start all over again on another character.
---
At least it's easy to get BP in 2019
---
meme dc's are a-ok B)
---
Damn, I'm kinda jealous that you get higher ranked survivors, I'm that kinda person where I like playing against people better than me, which is why I dont play survivor anymore. Until the 13th that is
---
Bro shirtless freddy would be lit
---
It's just lighting dude. She looks fine.
---
Yes they can with add-ons
---
Imo thats what you get for pallet camping. I've said what I've said, I'll take the downvotes and hate the comments now.
---
Can I interest you in the Hillbilly?
---
Karma whore
---
Shhhhhhh. 
---
Don’t say his name. BHVR might pay attention to him
---
If only we could know if it was a 4 man swf, even a red rank 4 man swf.
---
Usually when I chainsaw someone this quickly, they DC
---
Tenacity is always part of my build. 
---
Countless times I survived because of it and not just at the end, but during the match at low ranks (red, purple) killers tend to let you down and run after others, which comes to my advantage as I recover and crawl away towards a teammate and they help me up.
---
Add on to this, it takes an incredibly potato team to not pop 3 generators - a single M1 hit gives the survivor 26 seconds of distance to close before loops, and with 3 hooks each you'll usually see 3 pop against even Freddy/Nurse/Hillbilly unless the survivors are beyond bad, since they do have all the advantages at the start (4 alive, unhooked, and not even found yet, 7 generators on a large map with all the pallets up).
---
Meaning that after that, 2 can immerse with a key and wait for the other 2 to die.
---
You can't expect a killer to snowball against good (or even just decent) survivors to the point that 3 gens don't pop, they're not supposed to do that, or designed to do that - they're designed to snowball off the first kill or two and pressure the last 3 or 4 generators for their 4k.
---
Keys basically cause the game to end after 80 seconds - sure the killer gets to dick around a little longer killing two people, but the actual point that the hatch escape was guaranteed for the first two survivors happens in 80 seconds.
---
This is even different than a mori, since if you want to say a down = a hook (it usually does, after all) they still have to down you twice (since the second down really DOES count as your second hook 99% of the time) and only one person at a time. Sure an ebony mori on a top-tier killer is pretty bullshit, but it's not the same kind of bullshit as two people escaping through the hatch because you successfully defended the last 2 gens from popping.
---
Keys reward basically doing nothing, you only have to do 1 generator each in order to 3-man hatch.
---
The trap
---
Where did you hear this?
---
Awesome video! So adorable and fun. :) I’d love to see that if I was the killer.
---
I can't really see why they would lie about that. And still if there are more SWF, most of the time they are not the "Toxic-genrushing-squad".
---
What does that have to do with this. You acting like he can’t be proud of something he learned to do?? You probs the type to play 24hrs a day and still not progress like chill out homie
---
Looks fantastic 👌
---
Ignore the rude comments. Some of these people need to pick up the Quick &amp; Quiet teachable IRL.
---
Why are you running Ace in the Hole without Plunderer's?
---
Well, 'facts'. It's my opinion and how I see things. Everyone is free to disagree.
---
Id suggest its even more classic to come into a specific thread and bitch about how reddit doesnt suit what youd prefer, even when theres a filter. Like, your comments are the grade A clown act I love to see.
---
They type of person to say “god dammit, I only got an A-“
---
missed opportunity to make it meg griffin but beter is always funny

What exactly are the downsides to being asleep? I never seem to notice much difference between Freddy's dream world and the normal world.

Charge dey phone
---
I thought they'd removed hostage doc. Yeah 3 gens shouldn't be removed, they've been a core part of the game for ages and only the most salty of survivors don't like that they exist.
---
This is true but as a corollary using lightborn doesn't make you a toxic killer.
---

I saw one with the Hag and all I could think was "if she was kidnapped by cannibals, that horse cock would be one of the first things to go." It was as long as she was tall!
---
Why would teabagging ever be considered better than permanent A-posing? Half of the characters can crouch but where else have you seen a dude just standing there almost motionless just staring at you and the next thing you know is a creepy piano tune starts playing and there’s a knife in your ass
---
I play this game since 2016, I played every killer, every survivor on every rank. Not playing so much atm, but I'm still purple with killer and red with survivor. Sure, I can only speak about my experience.
---
I have terrible days with killer sometimes. Losing every fuckin' round, getting' mad at basically nothing. And I have good rounds (I wouldn't rank up if there weren't some). Currently, Archive challenges are fucking up the behaviour on both sides and I hope they think about other challenges that promote a healthier gamestyle. 
---
I'm not impressed by any "ggez" and stuff like that anymore. Sometimes, I close the chat and just.. well, play. Try it out. You don't need the chat.
---
I would also like to know.
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

Not sure what the issue is, but I would try reinstalling video codecs. Possibly GPU and sound drivers as well?

The most painful thing in the world
---
Mori time
---
Try nurse
---
Or remove it once you start repairing a generator? Like it comes across as ridiculous that even your low-tier toolboxes (brown w/ yellow addon or yellow w/ brown addon) repair a generator in 64 seconds just like a purple would (and if they have a purple with speed addons, it's even fucking faster).
---
Like you find this generator at 75% with an injured survivor on it that was hooked, and you have to slug them. You don't get Pop, you don't get BBQ&amp;C, you don't even get other potential slowing/tracking perks like Thrilling Tremors.
---
You have to leave them there to recover on their own (happens pretty quickly) and get picked up, and unless you're hard-proxying them, the two can repair that generator from 75% to 100% in 11 seconds (A 0% to 100% 2-man is 44.44 seconds, so 25% of that is 11.11 seconds).
---
It's an incredibly safe perk, the distance it gives you (20 meters) also takes a regular M1 killer an entire age (33.3 seconds) to catch back up to you even if you can't loop, if they have to grab you instead.
---
This gets even more ridiculous with Borrowed Time and Adrenaline in play - like are you going to tell me that a survivor with 3 hook stages, on a team with two second chance perks, actually struggles to complete 5 generators to the point that they earn Adrenaline?
---
Adrenaline is practically handed out on a silver platter, not a challenge or an accomplishment.
---
Billy to dwight: "YO YOU SEEING THIS SHIT DUDE ?!?!"
---
He pointed at the pallet as u can see
---
I just hate the fact that survivors can do all this bm toxic bs but as soon as the killer runs something like a mori or camps a survivor that was being a dickhead all game they get flamed and called bad but when survivors are toxic it’s fine.
---
1. What is farming?
---
2. What is tunneling? 
---
3. Is there any way killers that camp get punished? I’ve played a few games like that, where killers didn’t leave the hook once &amp; I was left to die. Is this ok or is it generally frowned upon?
---
4. If you find a key, can you leave in the hatch at any time during the game?
---
5. Any links or tips to read more about killers &amp; their special skills? From gameplay I see Demogorgon can teleport &amp; one guy can go invisible with his gong. 
---
I’m a level 19 Meg, but I only started playing this month. I’ve been watching gameplay videos &amp; have gotten a better idea of how to play effectively. I’m trying to understand better :)
---
Thank you in advance
---
What, you egg?
---
I wish his add-ons were less garbage. Deer Lung needs to be his base portal movement speed, Rat Tail needs to be the default setting speed. His status effect add-ons need to proc off Shred, not cleansing a portal. Half the time people don't even bother with clearing portals because they can just Sprint Burst away from the gen as soon as they see you pop up. 
---
I basically use his portals like League wards and immediately activate then so I can start getting info when someone is near critical objectives (Ruin or my 3 gen spread). I keep a backup nearby in case, and slap one down after I hook someone to get to the 3 gen and Pop any that have progress.

---
It can also mean when you vault a something like a T wall right away, even if it isn’t safe ( if the killer doubles back or mind games it )

Spirit is the most popular killer but she wants to date people who play them all?
---
Well The ClaudeWind Farm is his map so it makes sense. You could use the toxic double addons for moving extremely easly aroud the map so you can take  turns at about 90 degrees without much pain in the ass... i personally have the same problem on huntress, but i play without addons so im not toxic(i hit my shots) but there are times when i cant hit because my lil sniper is too slow.
---
In conclusion, be a toxic nea and it will all be okay.
---
Eat hot chip
---
Feel free to send me your info as well. Im usually on around this time if not at work.
---
I bet that Steve messaged you saying “camping exit gates makes you a trash player”
---
People complain about M1 killers running NOED because if they do the incredibly hard feat of holding M1 on generators for two minutes (total, divided among all four survivors) to pop all 5 generators against a killer with no map pressure and get their "totally hard to earn such a reward had to sweat and sacrifice for this" Adrenaline proc while running Borrowed Time + Decisive Strike.
---
They want their free escape, Wraith moves 115% outside of cloak, this means if he hits someone it takes 26.6 seconds for him to close the distance (barely worth cloaking for without the very rarest of addons due to decloaking on the other side) - the same is true for killers like Pig - in a straight line.
---
Fun fact: it takes 20 seconds to open a gate.
---
Fun fact: this means an M1 killer without NOED literally cannot complete a chase, the survivor you M1 will escape.
---
Fun fact: even Spirit averages less than 115% move speed including the full duration of her phase + its cooldown over 26.6 seconds; Spirit is strong because she's literally invisible while phasing and can catch you walking away from a generator, track you while injured without you knowing which side she's coming from, and mindgame the pallet.
---
Does Wraith do any of that? Not without 14,000 bloodpoints worth of addons, and even then honestly not as good as Spirit does.
---
He's an M1 killer who moves glacial slow with NOED (119%) compared to Hillbilly's monstrous 230% without NOED, who would ever give shit about NOED on Wraith? x:
---
You aight?
---
Joke's on you, I run both of those on Meg, with No Mither and Territorial Imperative. ;)
---
You do know ash is missing too.
---
Killers suffer too mang, when theres a double bp event and you set up the farmin perks and them streamers ye saved up and get gen rushed with everyone getting less than 12k bp at the end of the match because they played them loops perfectly like their lives were at stake.
---
I really don’t understand why they don’t make it equal? I’m pretty sure huntress and the hag aren’t free on pc either? I wonder why it’s like this.
---
*[he stabs him]*
---
Alerts saved me so many times, the perk may as well be a cheat
---
?
---
Just like the spirit, he phases to somewhere, but without a husk, then gets a legion like fatigue (with a laugh, of course)
---
Don't diss Jane! She's not fat, she's thiccccccc. Lol
---
You're a beautiful person, happy birthday, make sure to perform a mori on them. &gt;:P
---
How did you drop a pallet on the killer 4 times? Any tips for it? I've been trying it for awhile now and the killer usually avoids the stun.
---
I know I was killer during double bp and there were bp offerings and everyone gen rushed and was like damn....but this meme came to me when I was running wall hacking Myers (scratched mirror+jewelry box) on Leary using my glasses and after the match started everyone dc and I lost the addons and offerings
---
Ace in the Hole is not what gives you a good item, friend.
---
The Entity watching me getting teabagged at the exit gate for wanting to try out a new killer: "😕"
---
1). Farming is where the killer and survivors act friendly towards eachother to get the maximum amount of blood points possible in a match. IE pallet drops, killer hits and survivors heal, hooks and unhooks. This often involves perks or offerings that give more blood points. 2). When a killer solely targets one survivor till they are dead. Even if it isn't wise. 3). Nerfing is when the development team changes some aspect of the game to make it weaker. Examples include how they changed Oni a week in so his special skill wasen't as strong, or how they added window entity blocking to prevent loops. 4). Perks like borrowed time really help against camping, or your teammates rushing gens. Borrowed time allows a survivor to take an extra hit for 15 seconds after they've been unhooked in the killer radius. Killers camping the hook is frowned upon for sure, and ruins the gameplay for both sides. 5). Yes, you can use the key on the hatch whenever it is spawned in. 5). There are a ton of informative guides on YouTube, but DBD wiki is also good for basic knowledge. Sorry for the brick paragraph, I am on mobile. Message me if you need more help!
---
Freddy's abilities are active in the dream world, such as the blood pools that impair movement, or the fake pallets. Also you know, the disoriented world with weird sounds.
---
☹️
---
I agree. I bought the game 2 days ago, and no matter how good or bad i do as the killer, theres shit talk. Genuinely an awful community in this game.
---
It’s overall ridiculously good, the only issue is his sword arm is kind of a gimp arm.
---
Hey no one wants to remove playing with your friends.
---
They just want people who don't break the balance of the game.
---
Did you see the killer's hex while being chased? Don't tell anyone that you saw it, don't tell your friends where it was.
---
Did you see the hatch? Don't tell anyone where it was.
---
Did you see the killer? Don't tell anyone who it was.
---
Did you throw down shack pallet? Does the killer have Bamboozle? Did you 99 the gate? Did you get chased off a 99% generator? Don't tell anyone.
---
Etc. etc. etc.
---
Talk about your favorite movie or something else while playing with your friends.
---
If the killer is hard camping, it is better to just sacrifice one person and get two or three gens done. Its happened to us all, but this is the best result. You can try and go for the save with borrowed time and DS, but the fact is its gonna be extremely rough. Esp vs trapper, bubba, etc.
---
not acurate
---
NOED can be countered by cleansing totems, it’s not like it’s not counterable, both can be countered, both can give second chances, I honestly don’t even know why we’re fighting about this. seems like NOED and DS triggers the fuck out of this sub for some odd reason. Might as well just remove both perks to ease the tension of both killers and survivors bitching about them. But then again baby killers/survivors can’t live without them and would probably cry if both were removed.
---
BHVR said it somewhere, i don't remember where, but they said.
---
Little outdated
---
i’ve seen a lot of awful ideas, but congratulations, this is the worst one by far
---
Let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
It's also the best map for jumpscare addon builds.  Whether it be Pig, Doctor, Myers, or Ghostface.
---
How come the only ads I see for that god damn game are just Youtubers being paid to promote this game that no one's otherwise heard of... I assume its microtransaction riddled bullshit?
---
I just call those trolls
---
I'm assuming since he was actually outside of the basement to down someone else and carry them back, that he was engaging in an actual proper chase (admittedly perhaps one stupidly around the basement itself? Lots of survivors will loop the basement because the pallet is up, even when someone is down there) instead of camping/making use of Insidious.
---
Even if he was proxying a bit, you're never gonna get all four kills inside if you don't 3-gen them near the basement, so you're not exactly gonna run across the map.
---
Maybe a dumb question but what does this mean exactly? 50.000 players online most of the time or 50.000 people who play this game on the regular?
---
Yes, unfortunately. If you are a PC player, the steam sale is the best time to get this stuff on the cheap though. However, do remember that the weekly shrines have perks such as hex ruin once in a blue moon, so free chance to get it.
---
What I miss?
---
It was in some update on the website about a few weeks ago I think
---
Learn to feather the chainsaw, when you let off the power button the bar regresses slowly and you can just tap it over and over to keep it close to full, you can walk around with the chainsaw revved until you have your shot and if they're just walking you around a small loop, just let it regress fully and smack them. With enough practice, the only god awful map is Lerys and I've still been 4k'd there plenty of times in green ranks, you just need to work on figuring out the pathing you need to use for each map for the best mobility and you'll be golden
---
It's beautiful! I wish I could draw half as good as that.
---
Funny build is Bone clapper + blink addon. I spam the bell almost the entire match, and everyone gets to hear it globally!
---
I ran empathy, urban, light weight, and alert. Plus a flashlight. I would snipe the killer, essentially I would see him hit someone with empathy and then intercept the chase nearby knowing what has been broken already with alert. I would then urban evade to hide just around the pallet and wait for the survivor to run through and not drop the pallet, then step in and hit the killer with it a second later when they chase through. After that blind and they will pursue, usually angrily. So use that and hit them again while taking a hit if you have to. Get hooked and unhooked, healed, and repeat process. Got it in three attempts. Tbh though I got it against the oni so a little luck helps.
---
It’s very obviously a filter if you look at her eyes/lips. Nobody has porcelain-skin like that. You can see where it blurs around her lips.
---
A lot of girls on Facebook use that specific filter and it always makes the person look fake.
---
Didn’t they say one hour = one level in the rift? So about 60 hours to get to max? I’ve played quite a bit but not extremely much because of my studies and I’m only like level 27...
---
Yeah, sadly most of them are toxic parties and shit talk after every game. I cant imagine taking this game that seriously, id love to see them play a game thats actually difficult lol.
---
Polish up, sounds good. 
---
 Tranquilize.... is very underpowered. Even if those percentages are rounded up to a full second, all three tiers are still only an extra second. 
---
 Afterparty would be great for basement hooks, but that's about it.
---
I'm not sure what to think about this, I mean I run Sprint Burst and I'll run to the furthest corner from the basement if you catch me on a generator.
---
Not to be toxic, just because I want to be saved, not proxied in the basement until I'm dead; you'd better bring a one-hit down or use your traps appropriately, because I'm booking it to the other side of the map ASAP (not teabagging though).
---
On the other hand I feel like survivors who are beyond being saved (everyone else dead or hooked or slugged) even if they wiggle free (they'll get downed again) should just accept the basement hook anyway, since they're dead either way; running to the corner is for when you're not dead yet.
---
1. There are basically two types of farming. The first (positive type) is when people do certain actions solely for the purpose of getting bloodpoints. Say you have a Killer that's friendly and tries to do specific things (scare people as doc, breaking pallets, etc). That person is just farming for bloodpoints, or for their challenge. Survivors can do this too.
---
The second type is probably the most common use of the term, but it's when someone unhooks another survivor in front of the Killer. It's just a dick move. Don't do it unless you have Borrowed Time or have a good reason for it. Usually when people mention farming they mean this.
---
2. Tunneling is when the Killer focuses solely on one specific survivor during the match, and is usually frowned upon. Unfortunately, most people that cry about tunneling are just whining that they're being chased by the Killer. That's not always the case, but I personally haven't been tunneled more than once in my couple hundred matches.
---
3. Nerfing is a common term in multiplayer games, but it means that the developers are making something weaker. "Nerf Ruin", for example, means that someone wants the Hex: Ruin perk to be weaker. Buffing is the opposite of Nerfing, at least in gaming lingo.
---
4. Face camping is unfortunate but it really hurts the Killer more than the survivors. In the time spent camping someone on the hook, the remaining survivors can complete at least 3 generators each on their own. It's a surefire way to lose a match as Killer. Also, yes, this is frowned upon. It's like double parking in a handicapped spot.
---
5. If you have a key, you're able to leave through the hatch IF the hatch has appeared. The hatch has a certain criteria that needs to be met to appear first.
---
6. Otzdarva is a fantastic source for learning about killers. The dude is a Killer main and he's really helpful if you want to learn more about the game. Another good source is the DBD Gamepedia wiki, I've learned many things on that site.
---
Welcome to the game, I actually got back into it recently and it's been a good time!
---
With Tranquilize I was affraid people would think it was op if I raised the percentage any further
---
I hope everyone doesn't upvote since this smells like a classic karma whoring and/or attention whoring "my friend" my ass.
---
Actually if the killer is running a basement build, you're looking at a 3-gen near the basement.
---
You need to pop one of those 3 gens first to deny it, ideally by tag-teaming the generator (one of the few times it's alright to 3-stack on a gen, in fact) to crank it out.
---
Yeah, unfortunately too many killers have proxy guarded basement hooks, or just flat out face camped in the basement, for me to believe I can be saved if I'm close enough to be taken to one. Better to run from the basement as fast and far as possible when chased.
---
That's true. My thing is just that if I k ow where a killer is gonna be, then I'm not gonna be there, l ok l
---
Huntress is free on pc.
---
Console versions get more because their base game is $10 more than pc. Console gets hag/ace, feng and doctor.
---
Sau- I mean that's fun fun
---
Why is this getting downvoted. That hook bug makes you straight up unhittable.
---
Red ranks is rarely toxic. Most red ranks are respectful. Purple and green is where all the toxic MadcuzBad survivors are and will rage no matter what. 
---
Also pallet looping and body blocking is toxic? Really? I understand tbagging but cmon now.
---
I get up and go make a drink.
---
I’m by no means an expert, but have you played killer before? It gives you a better grasp on scratch marks and stuff like that. If you’re doing a gen, and the killer is approaching, crouch away and hide somewhere that’s not a locker most of the time. It doesn’t leave scratch marks and the killer has no idea where you’ve gone. 
---
Try not to run by walls. 
---
It also depends on the map as well. Scratch marks are better hidden on maps like Coldwind Farm because of the corn and the Yamaoko Residence. 
---
Make sure you’re looking back sometimes to see what way they’re going.
---
Stun is what, 3 to 5 seconds? Even at highest stun of 5, 15% is still only .75 of a second added on. No way in hell would I give up a perk slot for something as underpowered and negligible as that.
---
 You're gonna get complaints either way mate. Either the perk will be completely useless, or some salty player is going to scream overpowered.
---
New pennywise looking good
---
I teabag only to say ,,gg" in case killer don't use posr match chat
---
I wasnt even aware this game had a skill gap.
---
So raise the percentage a bit?
---
Watch streamers/youtubers if you’re a visual learner. Pain Reliever on youtube is really fuckin informative
---
Wow! Thanks for all the info!!! I'll definitely try that! I really appreciate it!
---
I always know when someone is rank 18-20 when they open the gate when someone is downed or hooked and then leave immediately.
---
If you don't, then the perk is rather useless. But I'm a survivor main, so a killer main will need to weigh in on an appropriate amount of stub time added that isn't too big.
---
Stupid thing is Finished all archive challenges and I have still one whole set of Rift to unlock..., that encourages farming and is just poor design...
---
I like it and I feel if they added voices for more characters it would add a funny aspect to the game
---
I remember i crashed and then got toxic messages, god I love the ps4 dbd community
---
did you just wake up from cryostasis?
---
Red ranks are rarely toxic? Man what game are you playing because the messages I get are hundreds. Pallet looping is fine but body blocking is pretty much an annoyance. Free hits though. Lots of triggered red rank survivors ITT.
---
Lowkey making me want to actually spend the time to get good at Huntress lmao
---
Ah, so what if a character talked directly towards you. Like acknowledging you are there kind of like a shop clerk in other games
---
I wish they added more lines for each character just for flavour
---
Well, enduring decreases stuns by 50% at tier 3, so maybe increasing by 20%?
---
Try to only throw down pallets and vault windows when absolutely necessary when fighting a huntress. Vaulting is what the killer wants you to do. Try to just run straight through a pallet then immediately take cover to avoid a possible hatchet.
---
For nurse, try to lose line of sight on the nurse as soon as you are in the chase. The nurse needs a good idea of where you are going, to blink well. Mixing up your running strat (running unpredictably) will often confuse a nurse.
---
Hope it helps!!
---
that reminds me of a bubba me and my buddies ran into awhile go. he just stayed in basement the whole game and we only knew he was down there bc i aaa him with dark sense 
---
decide to go down there and poke him and he instadowned and hooked my gf and the rest of us booked it 
---
enter postgame and see that his name is “basement is closed”
---
I do aswell, I'd like to hear the voices of the survivors besides just grunts of pain
---
I like it its easier for characters to have a personality if they actually speak. Its not 100% necessary though i put it on the same level as killer chase music it just adds more to the characters.
---
I would find that hilarious
---
I think its because the oni's sword arm is baby width compared to the other.
---
Otherwise, tell your friend the reddit loves his work.
---
Ds only works if you tunnel. Stop hooking the same person over and over and pretending its skill.
---
Facts! 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Man that’s terrible!
---
Awesome! I meant awesome!
---
Ahh, so what if there was a character that openly acknowledged your character. Sort of Like a shop clerk or something in other games where they are a npc but they're quite chatty. Would you feel that works here?
---
Honestly, i do too
---
I hate not knowing who is who and picking up the unhooker only to realize it was the person who was on hook and they have DS.
---
I mean don’t people still do even against 4 solos 🤔
---
I had a wraith today who left me on the ground and closed hatch and I had to sit there for 5 min and bleed out because it was my first down, he just stood above me and bing bonged.
---
Im pretty sure I've never played against a single clown. How bad is the clown because I definitely dunno
---
I made an artistic rendition of this moment in commemoration.

about a weekish ago there was q&amp;a/stream where they said doctor would get his own music with his addons update and that after that others would gradually get their own music too
---
He found a dictionary boys! And lucked out with an old archaic word Congrats!
---
Along with these, you are also afflicted by Oblivious, so Borrowed Time and other perks that rely on being in the TR won't activate.
---
Freddy also has certain add-ons that reduce action speeds while asleep.
---
idk, I play on console as well. Btw you mean the pallets were completely invisible? Thats really weird and were they just invisible for you or could the survivors see them as well?
---
If a survivor decides to stay in the trial after their teammates abandon them, you best believe I’m gonna let them farm &amp; survive. Earns me more bloodpoints as the killer as long as the survivor reciprocates.
---
That any communication improves your odds of winning despite your bad luck in what killers you run against. If they destroy your SEt group they will destroy you solo.
---
I played Freddy before he was in the game.
---
yes only so my biker girls (yui/kate) can flirt

Thank you, friend. This is truly a work of art.

So much salt in that chat box I could dry cook my pork with it.

Dude if I drew that I would be so proud of myself but your friend is really talented the only thing I can draw is stickman characters

Except you have to be there.
---
There is no possible way you can escape the trial if the killer is 3-genning without getting the hatch (key or last alive).
---
Also the killer is likely to dodge lobbies with keys since so much of their perk build is dedicated to the basement and slowing the game down around it.
---
This means you have to go by those 3-gens, it's better to do this ASAP, early, for it to be the first generator you work on - if you get hooked and someone else pops it, it was worth getting hooked for. There are still 3 survivors up and he can't camp you too hard if he still wants to 4k inside the basement, people will gen rush him out.
---
Some things really ARE worth getting hit/found/chased/hooked for, breaking a 3-gen early is one of them. It's survivors that don't want to be first hooked/eat a hook stage in general to break the 3-gen that make the 3-gen work.
---
I'll even take aggro while on death hook to break a 3-gen if absolutely necessary, unless they're playing "avoid the killer because I know where he is" - in which case I'll just immerse while chatting in Discord and wait for hatch, you gotta help break the 3-gen or the people actually trying to do so will leave you to die on first hook because you're not helping.
---
Not even doing the other 4 gens by yourself because the killer is 3-genning is helping, helping is pretty binary when it comes to the gates (your contribution only matters if they're powered because of it).
---
Thank you, i really appreciate it. The best survivor map I’ve gotten so far has been yamaoko for sure, it’s the only one I’ve actually survived XD. And yes I’ve played killer before, I’m mainly having issues with keeping the killer off me and also being enough of a distraction so that my teammates can get objectives done or escape. My juke skills are absolutely shite at the moment, so that’s fun. But I didn’t realize I could look back at them, so thank you for that bit of info. Cheers :)
---
Was this a hag match with her addon that makes her phantasm traps solid? That's the only time this has happened to me. I got launched clear the fuck out of lerys memorial one day because of that addon. I wasn't sure I was ever going to fall back into the map.
---
Like the merchant in RE4? An NPC that talks to you but you don't talk to it?
---
I don't see why it wouldn't work just depends on the situation/context. Especially if it was just characters on the map. Say we got a prison map they could have prisoners that yell things at you/reveal you as you walk by like crows. Would be a fun new game mechanic as well.
---
Can't wait for DC penalties
---
Claudette after remembering she can be toxic:
---
Nea BRING THE FLASHLIGHT AND D-STRIKE
---
I'm sorry, he DOESN'T like it!?
---
What is there to NOT like about this!?
---
Thank you!!
---
Thanks, I’ll give them a watch.
---
I was thinking something similar to archives except instead of lore it's similar to what they have on mobile. The blood market. Except with a nifty new face to sell goods.
---
By the way that prison idea with prisoners is amazing
---
I can do everything though :( and I only die sometimes! So pls no booly
---
Lmao. Body-blocked into oblivion!
---
Lery's is always an infinite, the entire map - because each room was changed to guarantee windows and vault points, and there are pallets next to counters that are good enough barriers to create distance, and uber-safe ones like near the office considering it's basically a hallway.
---
Of course you have to be very good at seat-of-your-pants jungle gyms and correcting on the fly to make use of the infinite, it has a very high skill ceiling.
---
Pair that with it negatively impacting killer powers and being hard to navigate as a survivor, you have a map that only benefits the very best survivors (like best of the best, top 0.01% or some shit), but everyone else dislikes, and is a toxic experience for everyone except Scratched Mirror Myers.
---
The survivor is untouchable for 60 seconds, if I break that rule I’m a tunneler, gotcha.
---
So make swf gens take longer.

Yeah, of course! Definitely look back to see where they’re going. Use their red stain to see where they’re going to. 
---
Get a few perks that help with speed.
---
Look out for T and L walls and jungle gyms. Killer shack is also a good place to loop.
---
Gotta love those Beauty-App filters
---
Like when you use the come here emoticon your character would whisper like “over here!”
---
Not for those of us that liked the old Freddy.  Especially how RPB worked to create a jump scare killer.  He was like playing 42land.dec, Stax, or Dredge.  People who played old Freddy did so because they liked playing a different game within DBD.  Which is why I went to Doctor when they deleted old Freddy.  Unfortunately yet another purchase is being ripped from me.  All I know is it both of these reworks have cemented the fact I will never put a single cent into another BHVR game.
---
As a doctor fan I'm hoping he gets some edgy slightly annoying electronic music of some sort.
---
It's honestly just common sense. If you keep going after the same person they will die quickly. You know it's the same person. If you happen to run into them again within 60 seconds you dont have to ignore them but shit, no one wants to wait 10 minutes queuing up for you to have them killed in 2 minutes. Go play survivor and get tunneled and pretend it doesn't get on your nerves.
---
I hope she DM’s you back bro
---
That'd be funny just to hear a tiny over hear
---
They’re
---
&gt; If anyone gets upset if you don't unhook someone when the killer is camping, just ignore it. It's a personal choice, and no one should fault you if you don't want to set yourself up to be killed. 
---
This is very true and it's important to to remember you're a survivor, not a savior. You shouldn't work with the killer (pointing at occupied lockers, fast vaulting near gens being worked on etc.) for an advantage, but sometimes a save is just too risky.
---
Clown also sounds like he has lung cancer too lol
---
Iron Maiden is another option, but rarely used
---
Click on their name and you can check their steam friends list. You see they are all friends.
---
It's really not hard.
---
I never said NOED wasn’t counterable, just that it isn’t similar to DS.
---
I want the option to step into a Locker, take a deep sniff from a chloroform rag, and ‘wake up’ in a new locker of my choosing.
---
The clowns only weakness is map pressure, just give him some kind of movement ability and he’d be a lot better.
---
My opinion on campimg/tunneling, it is kind of a dick move  like its really annoying but its truly a way to get a 4k against toxic survivors its a tactic but a cheap one
---
Currently? He is a joke
---
If we're talking about Vore, let me remind you... You can literally watch Hag eat Claudette out.
---
Ghostface is chad because unique chasing animations and unique animations in general
---
Ok, thank you again! Happy new year!!
---
Play for like 20 hours or so and Watch Pain Reliever on youtube for a beginners guide in both side. It’ll come to you rapidly. Just try playing the game first
---
Look up otzdarva, he has a video dedicated to what killers and survivors you should use, especially when you are starting out. Vid is 6 months old at this point, but the google sheet in the descriptions of the two videos that he keeps up to date. If you want, I can find a link to the specific videos
---
Watch Pain Reliever on youtube and play the game a lot longer. A lot of the game is based on feel and experience bc of map rng.
---
Demogorgan should have some 80's, retro type music to match Stranger Things
---
Rank 1's are downvoting you too don't worry
---
Buy ghost face
---
He already has his own chase music, doubt they'll change it
---
That’s the main issue. Nobody wants to stay in a game where you got caught because the Game lagged and you got hit through a window 10ft away. 
---
D/C’ing sucks, but I can understand why some people do it, especially if something happened that was out of your control, like being downed or hooked because of the games BS.
---
Yeah it would help like too.  being able to track which direction they were in.
---
the original furry meme stays a classic
---
I mean would they get less if they just said "I did this"? I don't think so.
---
I’ve done this before. I was working on a generator by a window, left because the killer found me, looped back around to find my teammates doing the gen. The chase music was so loud I couldn’t hear them working on it, not even the gen itself.
---
by god man! your work is golden! truly brings a tear to the eye.
---
On PS4 I haven't had any weirdness going on with Lightburn, nor does anybody play Wraith in red ranks. Only Billy, Spirit and the odd Ghost Face, so you can't assume anything, really
---
Thanks, Social Media. Another “I’m dumb but pretty so donate to my OnlyFans and make me popular please” girl.
---
Completely invisible, even when they were slammed down on my face. Survivors could see them just fine. I believe it was Grim pantry, the swamp map with big main building with the OP window. I was constantly getting caught out on the invis pallets in the main building. I remember it happening to Scott Jund on PC on twitch too.
---
100% disagree. Word of mouth CAN work at a point, but you can't solely rely on it, especially if you're newer to streaming. You must advertise. Even if you're great/knowledgeable, that's not enough. It means very little if people don't know that you stream. You must advertise. 
---
Putting TTV in your name literally does that. Will some people come into the chat to shit talk or be toxic? Of course. But lots of people will come in just to say hi, watch back their game, and maybe start a conversation. Those are the ones that may even leave a follow, come back later, and become a friend. It is possible because I have seen it happen MANY times. 
---
But if you go around assuming every TTV is a toxic loser, that negative attitude is YOUR fault, not theirs. Try being a good person and not judging people from 3 letters in their screen name.
---
If you listened to the video audio, you couldn’t hear the gen until you were standing right next to it.
---
For real. Problem is this hoe is ugly as a mf.
---
You are become killer
---
Will try it out!
---
&gt;Ever roleplay?
---
*Oh Trapper Daddy, save me from this deadly trap with your big burly arms*
---
&gt;Also, why wouldn't you be careful?
---
Why would you pretend to farm, act like a decent person, then be shocked when people are upset when you were just pretending all along? How dare they be bothered by recognizing a person behind the keyboard was the actual douchebag?
---
FEE FI FO FENG

It's been featured on the DBD 2019 year review on their website! Didn't see any credit. Did you get some?
---
If they do add voice lines and stuff, I really hope they leave Myer's silent. It's so much more intimidating than if he talked. For Legion he/she could be taunting and leering. Demogorgan and Hillbilly will probably do some unintelligent screaming. It'd be interesting.
---
I give it a year before she’s on national TV and releasing a rap album and clothing line
---
They said they were trying to have fun. While I do kill sometimes, my whole goal is fun and I play a similar style to them.
---
Couldn’t agree more
---
Oh that's nasty
---
Nah i play on pc
---
I feel like it's a given that he'd remain silent. If any licenced killer were to receive voice limes it'd probably be ghostface. Though it makes sense, bubba just squeals, micheal is silent, and pig is all about silently ambushing even if amanda isnt all that quiet. The only licenced killer who actively talks is Freddy but i doubt he'll get any
---
I mean the title of the post kinda encourages you to upvote to prove their friend wrong.
---
Let me know if you have any criticisms! Reposted with some changes.
---
Treatment theater's one of my favorites. I love the indoor maps cause they make playing survivor very stressful and worrying. Especially with stealth killers
---
“That’s on a period!”
---
Fucking christ white people really manage to make anything sound same and homogenized
---
For Survivors level up Feng Min, Meg Thomas and Bill Overbeck first, they have very beginner friendly perks.
---
Like what other people said... p3 Freddy with a solid build. You're not a new player, and I'm not buying it that you're so bad that 16 is where you feel you belong. You probably de-ranked and you're just complaining that you didnt get to beat up on actual new players. Quit whining and get over it.
---
One time against the Spirit, 2 of my teammates DCed within 1 minute of the game, and the third one let themselves die on the first hook. She sent me a message and asked if I wanted to move onto the next game or do the gens. I replied “Only if you feel like sitting through 5 gens.” We proceeded to slam and break all the pallets together and farm on gens. When I finished, she let me escape in the hatch
---
Self Care is apparently toxic now.
---
‘The survivors tremble before him!’
---
I remember a Cello player at a home gathering
---
"Play us something!"
---
"No way, I did not touch the cello for two weeks. I would play horribly"
---
"We don't have the music culture to realise it"
---
"But I do."
---
I was also thinking about the same. I play dota2 and there heros says something to each other if they are related within lore/apperance/race/class. Having dialogue when saved/saving/healing/dying and meeting for first time in a trial with other survivor will   be nice. Orignal 4 survivor metting each other should say something related to it. Meeting your identical survivor should say something like "you are me" or "am I dreaming it another me" depending on their personality. Killer also saying somethig to a survivor when hooking/sacrificed like Billy saying to Meg when dowining her "You cant run faster than me" and Nurse to Claudette "Heal! You are dead".
---
Did you draw this? My friend is usually code
---
Well considering the emblems are directly tied to your rankings, it would be quite simply impossible to implement this change in a fair way
---
By order, Jane, Ash, Steve, Nancy and Yui all don’t exist.
---
Don't you love it when the survivor juke/loop/mindgame themselves ? Because I sure do !
---
This was my entire night. In my last game I got sandbagged at the shack pallet by another survivor, then tunneled off hook and mori’d.
---
360 are incredibly unreliable and there’s no real way to master them. Move your character one way and your camera in the other is the simple premise, but autoaim and sentient killers usually won’t be juked.
---
They mentioned in the last live stream that giving old killers new chase themes is something they hope to accomplish but can't 100% promise. They said that killers they touch up or rework like Doctor for example, will hopefully be accompanied by new chase music. One thing they did confirm however, is that they will continue the trend of giving new killers chase music since they have received universal positive feedback about Demogorgon and Oni's chase music.
---
I had one like this except he "led me" to the hatch. After like 2 minutes of crawling he just grabs me and throws me somewhere random where I simply bleed out
---
Exposed is a debuff survivors can get that makes us able to be 1 hit downed. Killers like ghost face, myers can do it and perks like iron maiden, haunted grounds, and NOED can do it as well. It
---
Plays a loud sound when you get the debuff and you basically have to keep moving till it wears off
---
That's amazing! I understand that feeling though.
---
It worked a lot better before the Prayer Beads nerf.
---
This is way too much self promotion dude, you linked the vid on almost every comment thread
---
No, he's asking about the Plague. This tip is for how to counter the Doctor
---
If we're talking just objectively best killer in the game, Nurse. If we're talking which killer has the best perks, I would say a tie between Leatherface and Hag.
---
As for survivors they are all in the end essentially skins and have no gameplay differences between them. The only thing that matters is perks for them. Best survivor perks I would say is Meg and Laurie.
---
For players who are just starting out the game and looking for a good killer to play who is simple to pick up and play while still being good would be Michael. His power is simple to use and understand but is very powerful and a force to be reckoned with.

Are you sure she's not looking down from a hook at that crouching Nea doing nothing while the other two survivors are doing gens on the other side of the map?
---
His blood pools don't work in the overworld? Had no clue, thanks.
---
"and die" killed me xD
---
Isn't different teams?
---
Alright, Imma put on my neckbeard for this one. Avid horror fan here. Lets say Amanda somehow gets the trap on his head. She has to activate the trap and wait 60 seconds. That gives Meyers all the time in the world to choke and stab. Lets say the trap goes off immediately.. Michaels back in the next movie, ready to choke and stab while Amanda’s eating her candied bacon in the morning. Michael=Zombie Jason Lite
---
My idea on how to fix the gen speed problem would be to make the gen speed killer rank dependant; something like 40s at white ranks, 60s at yellow ranks, 80s at green ranks, 100s at purple ranks and 120s at red ranks. It should make the game more enjoyable for high rank killers and low rank survivors, without making it an ez win for them or ruining the fun for the opponent side.
---
Make it activate post-game like party streamers and since everyone can get them its automatically fair. Bringing a offering costs you BP and sometimes doesn't help anyone but yourself. This would function the same way. If you bring a ward you get to keep your item, if I bring a emblem boost it makea it more likely I'll keep my rank. Its choices and since everybody has the same ones it just comes down to what you choose.
---
Arachnophobia sounds like the weakest one. I could see that being used by someone not planning to get hooked.
---
Thats great and the shading is good. Keep it up
---
to another surf, for any reason whatsoever.
---
to killer only when trying to get his attention so he does not hard tunnel.
---
Noice :D
---
You cant just tell the survivors to gen rush to end game. You cant warn them why you're DCing.
---
"I have no mouth, but I must scream"
---
I love Hens with Ties
---
Thanks for the feedback :)
---
A legion prestige. Noice
---
Yea, and people will say "it's just a button" without thinking about what the people are saying when they do it. Just because you can't hear them doesn't mean you can't guess what they are saying.
---
Yes might do Susie next if I have time
---
Hillbilly, Ghostface, Michael, and Freddy are probably the best starting killers in DBD. They are all decent killers, and really fun and easy to use (even Freddy). If you want more of a challenge starting out, Demogorgon and Spirit are both fun killers, they just have to be learned
---
Level up Leatherface ASAP, and get BBQ and Chili ASAP. Not only does it greatly boost your bp levels, but it makes sure you always know where survs are. Ruin is good too, but BBQ is always reliable. 
---
Survivors are just skins, so anyone you want is fine. However, you should always run self care, dead hard, borrowed time, decisive strike or spine chill (just one of those is fine, more are suggested). Spine chill is probably the easiest to get, and most useful. With the other perks, I’d suggest leveling up the specific survivor that has them, since you’ll never be sure when it will be in the shop. Decisive strike is probably the next one you want to get, and the rest is up to you. 
---
Remember, always level up to unlock teachable before you level up characters you like. Nothing sucks worse than getting level one BBQ and chili on a level 40 Hillbilly.
---
Chunky Jesus

I wish I could vs rank 20 survivors as well sad days

Well sure that is a sound argument it still doesnt address the actual issue of rewarding you with free emblems for doing nothing, the emblems are supposed to be perfomance based, doing anything outside of actually doing well in the match would be completely unfair
---
Hold up, it didnt affect chests? I always thought it does
---
Yeah straight out disgusting
---
Wait until you get cocky assholes who think they're gods and teabag, point and flashlight click. It'll change you. For real.
---
did you even watch the clip if you're saying the current hook exploit is intentional?
---
Map design in DBD is truly awful. In cases like Hillbilly where if you get Léry's, Hawkins, or The Game is total bullshit since you pretty much lose your entire ability apart from chainsaw humping which Leatherface does better. 
---
Then you throw in the fact that the maps are randomly generated and bad RNG can turn a good survivor map into a bad one and vice versa.
---
She 👏 was 👏 ready 👏
---
Its going to be epic.
---
Okeyy sure lol
---
The devs could work a luck mechanic into a few different aspects of the game - mainly RNG stuff. Maybe with luck perks and offerings you wiggle slightly faster, or you’re more likely to escape Pig traps. It could even affect hatch spawn to an extent. 
---
Nothing game breaking - just enough to warrant a perk slot.
---
Nope, only thing that affects the quality of chest items is Plunders
---
The Shape makes sense since that’s what he was credited as for the first two movies, but I like The Boogeyman now that I’ve heard it!
---
I like all of that except for the Pig one. It could however be easily circumvented by simply making her less RNG then she is right now. If that change was added in right now with her current state it would make the pure bullshit that is her traps even more annoying to play with.
---
Yes officer, this comment right here^
---
Like those don’t derank to bully newbie killers
---
Also I think there should be a refund on streamers/cakes if the killer uses a mori. It brings the mood down a lot.
---
I don't find the killers archives difficult at all, i struggle with the survivors way more
---
This is why I no longer greed for pallets stuns or extra loops after Bloodlust 1 (15 seconds). Depending on how long the chase had been going before this video that killer could be at BL2 or 3 is basically flirting with disaster.
---
Everyone is being downvoted for yelling at OP for camping the pallet but they are correct. When you camp a pallet you basically give a killer another tier of Bloodlust for free which means they're more likely than not going to be able to just swing through and hit you with the extra range coupled with dedicated desync. A trash loop like this one wouldn't be good for more than 5 seconds anyways so better to just throw the pallet and force a break to reset BL.
---
Because if they pretend SWF isnt an issue then they dont need to make adjustments. A simple UI thing that says if someone is in a lobby would be more than enough
---
I see it as more of a way to guarantee that you won’t have to hit all five boxes to get your special hat off. If you’re running a luck perk, you’re more likely to get it on your first, second, or third try. It would be similar to how it affects the likelihood of escaping a bear trap.
---
I play survivor and killer 50/50 but killer moreso, I won’t be mad at the killer if I run into them again within seconds, i blame it on my poor perception of view that got myself killed and not being more careful with my surroundings. However if the killer is intentionally ignoring other survivors behind me just to kill me then yeah that is pretty fucking annoying. I’ve met plenty of tunneling bubbas that way.
---
I would hate to lose my legacy
---
Tea bagging has been an insult in video games even before these toxic Gen Z kids were even born
---
Yeah see nobody sees hag and thinks "ah that's hot". The rest I can get but hag? With a over sized futa dick as well? That's gonna be a major no for me
---
If I get flashlight blinded it's my own fault for not paying attention and looking around the downed surv.
---
Someone give this man a medal
---
Um, no shit? Lol that’s kind of what I was talking about.
---
No wonder if you play that stoned 🐸
---
Bill would probably smell like a walking ashtray since he has a cigarette that is always lit and never burning short.
---
Have u seen my gingerbread nea that someone made a face for and it was amazing if u havent check it out if u want
---
Lmao this is too funny
---
literally, I bet.
---
I had a game as Ghost Face last night where I was at killer shack carrying a Claudette to hook near pallet and Yui comes over to stun me but completely messed up the timing. So we had a moment where I could literally see the embarrassment and so from that point I decided to be cool uncle ghost face and let them farm points. These are the type of games that are relaxing and a nice change of pace. Post game lobby she asked why did you turn nice and when I mentioned the pallet she spammed fhsishfidienfla out of embarrassment and it made my night.
---
Correct. If OP hadn't run out in front of the pallet to try and bait the stun he probably would have been fine, but since he did the server registered his position as being on the other side of the pallet even while it was in the process of being thrown. If we had 2017 vacuum pallets he'd have been perfectly safe there but we don't and coupled with dedicated desync trying to bait a swing with a bloodlusted killer is asking to get smacked.
---
My friend and I were messing around as Blendettes and we got Yamaoka and an Oni found me in a corner. Definitely a hacker. No question. Nobody finds a Blendette. Maybe I just suck at Blendetting. Not my style...
---
Depends on map and player skill level. If it's a huge ass map like Rotten Fields or Temple of Purgation try cleansing near the outside of the map or near completed generators forcing her to release pressure off of survivors and gens. If it's a map with lots of LOS blockers like Lérys or The Game you could also try since it'll be easier to dodge her puke. Some maps though you should never cleanse on though like Blood Lodge due to its complete lack of walls. 
---
Get used to being permanently injured and no way to hide as well. The only way to face Plague is to loop her, hiding is useless.
---
Wow thats super irritating and basically ruined the game for you. I hope this gets patched soon
---
I don't remember the last time I've seen someone use a locker as survivor. Maybe I'm lucky.
---
What happens in this picture?
---
Immersion is a lot smarter now that dedicated servers are a thing. All these people posting videos of getting hit through windows and pallets are still trying to play the game in 2017 where you can just greed for stuns and vaults all day because the game gives you vacuums and fast vaults for free.
---
Rework it so that Nurse is the only killer who can win, since she's the worst killer and needs the buffs.
---
This is proof Nea isn't the entity.
---
It could affect how often you get skill checks?
---
I feel this on a personal level. Had a game where I was 8, everyone else was 18.
---
Look at those pearly whites
---
I don't really count DS as toxic. It's a crutch perk to help give you a 2nd chance or to fight back against tunnelers. It's in the same vein as NOED, a crutch perk to help make up for bad early game mistakes or to fight back against gen rushers.
---
I just play mine craft
---
There's being totally immersed and then there's using stealth as a time wasting tool for the killer. Those who do the former deserve the ire and those who do the latter are fine.
---
The biggest problem with immersion gamers is they usually don't know how to run killers and they don't know how to take a hook state for the team when needed. If you watch someone like Painrelievers or even Usyllis at times you'll see how to blend (no pun intended) both stealth and good looping to benefit the team as well as knowing when to trade hook states to allow your team to recover.
---
I thought they already pushed those? Did they not?
---
Yeah
---
if there are 3 bloody disconnects in a match my man is getting the  hatch
---
Yeah but I'd rather take stats into account than a Killer main saying "the game is survivor sided".
---
this
---
Well said, 👍🏼
---
That's a mentality that a lot of experts have about their craft. On the surface to everyone else it's a masterpiece. But to the Craftsman it's a long list of mistakes or places where they could have improved. It's actually a really good mentality to have however, since it makes sure you don't grow complicit and lazy in your work and that you're always improving.
---
That's called being a good team player. Knowing when to force a chase with a killer to relieve pressure on your team is part of actually being a top tier survivor in this game. You see people doing it all the time in good SWFs, where the guy working on gens all game while you ran after their teammates suddenly pops up in your face, sometimes midchase to bait a hit and cancel your bloodlust.
---
That's why Chaser emblem is a thing in this game.
---
It's impossible to do 4 gens in one game, even at rank 20, while you're doing the 2nd one, they'll finish 2 or more and there goes the challenge.
---
Give Legion a try. It's almost impossible to depip with them and they are very fun to play.
---
They are not rank 20, they range from 4-12. As a killer you often get qued with high ranks because they don’t have enough killers queuing.
---
All of them needed a nerf and they're still very good. Maybe Oni took the shit end of the stick but he's still ok, not even bad. Calling a bug a nerf is pretty unfair.
---
I’d be really curious to see more of the Huntress’ backstory, and I guess David makes sense to pair with her
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
I’m only rank 18 killer. I doubt they’ll be that toxic at such a low rank, but I do have tea baggers. I play Ghostface so I dance with them. Lol
---
Lack of communication tools. When all you have is 2 gestures and a crouch to convey what you're trying to say it can be confusing what you mean. Sometimes it's a sign of respect and appreciation. Other times it's a sign of toxicity and rudeness.
---
LMAO! That’s why the community is so good! Diverse 🤣
---
Ooh oh I member
---
They were nerfed right? I remember when they first came out, everyone hated playing against them, but I’ll give them a try! Any tips?
---
SAME omg, I was scared but really happy hahaha
---
Can’t forget about taking the whole game to open a chest or cleanse a dull totem
---
I'm not joking when I say; I really hate people who draw something extraordinary and they be like "awww mate, what is this crap" NO YOU DID GOOD STFU, STOP COMPLAINING FOR NO GODDAMN REASON
---
No love for Henry travis alex or Murphy for shame for shame
---
Excuse me wtf is this
---
Is it even possible for hooks to spawn with 20 meters of eachother?
---
Yes lol
---
Oh no, they buffed kindred and detective hunch, Killers are doomed. 
---
Geez;
---
Why do I hear boss music?
---
But can it turn?
---
EPIC
---
"Step-bro no"
---
Hawking is a god awful map for survivors and is also a really boring map chase wise. Tons of pallets but none of them are useful so the killer just walks around them. I hate playing it as either side coz it's boring as hell.
---
Lery's isn't a good map either, as survivor you pray to RNG that a random room you're running to has something you can use and everything is rng based.
---
Switch version has clown and legion from what I know
---
Sir my SWF is garbage so I'd realistically get more out of solo queuing than playing in a SWF, but i still find it more fun than playing solo
---
I went up against one the other night. I'd lose her during the chase when she was right next to me. It was extremely difficult to do. It was super annoying hearing the chase music the entire time and never seeing anything.
---
Another Switch player! What’s your Switch code and we can play Survive With Friends (SWF) if you’d like? :-)
---
Added Jake Vigo's Marauder, Jane &amp; Jane Photoshoot Ready
---
Exactly. It's less about the right time and more about when you're in the right position given your perk setup. Positioning in this game is so damn important and it's the number one thing I see people failing at.
---
Obserd...
---
Yea I played against kitty and her friends who derank before every stream so they can bully low rank killers and when I killed her in the basement her 3 friends DCd because they “didn’t want to play without kitty.” Then I went to her stream to ask why and they DCd her mods banned me and her whole chat started acting like dicks towards me.
---
This is sick
---
Elaborate please?
---
This is spot on.Now that I look back, I think he was trying to help me. If you look carefully at the first time that he gets close, he starts going into the animation to disarm the traps but I hit him trying to break the cycle. It also explains why he didn't keep his distance when teabagging like the others. Now I feel bad about hooking him
---
I actually really enjoyed doing them.  
---
Obviously there are some that are pretty hard, but changing up my playstyle just for these was fun.  
---
Only one I struggled with was the 4 basement hooks, but I just did every other challenge and played killer normally until I got a chance to complete it.  
---
Around 20 matches later I had an overly altruistic team who bumrushed the basement, resulting in a basement 4K for me.
---
Unfortunately no, the David managed to escape
---
Survivors can’t keep any iridescent add-ons, even if they escape. Not if they use them, anyway. Why should a Killer be able to keep their OP add-ons if I can’t re-use the same BNP every game?
---
The way I see it: He's low tier because buffs would just make him more frustrating to play against. If they rework him so that he's less frustrating overall, they can buff him while still keeping him fun to play against. Both sides get to benefit.
---
I think I got a 2K but it probably happened more than a year ago. I haven't heard about it since. This thing with missing textures on pallets and cosmetics seems common though, at least on PC.
---
Everyone on console needs help with Huntress and Nurse. It's much harder to aim their powers on console and you're likely to get some framerate drops here and there. I'd you practise enough you'll get it, but they can be very frustrating at times.
---
Spirit and Oni both have fun perks (even though Spirits are a little bit more practical)
---
Spirit’s is defiantly a better survivor, and while Oni is wayyyy easier to use, Oni is just a shittier version of Hillbilly with a cooldown, while Spirit is her own thang. Plus, Spirit has boobies and booty, so I mean 
---
I’d go with Spirit
---
Only for short time.
---
He's not even in this conversation, those are just copies from the wikipedia article.
---
I mean the current Lery's is the problem they want to fix in the rework, just like they wanted to with Badham. 
---
For some reason they kept the original Badham 1 and it's easily the worst version of that map. I solemly hope they will not keep the original Lery's.
---
Guy: it’s a bird 
---
Me: No it’s a pleane
---
maybe like a vent or hole that had the entities gross ass tentacles covering it, and survivors can try to get it off but it makes noise and isnt instant, yet once its off they can use it to get out and climb to an area in the map thats randomly generated
---
I just realized you also make all that amazing art! Thank you for your contribution to this subs quality content &lt;3
---
How do you know they are swf with comms? Did you ask them?
---
Absurd*
---
Hacking should equal a death penalty
---
This is really really good!
---
literal teenager? no Danny Johnson is probably like late 20s maybe early 30s
---
remember this is a different Ghostface than the ones in the films
---
when you run OoO and play against wraith if he's cloaked and you look at him does he see you? 
---
The perk lights up, so Im curious.
---
I couldn’t help but read this in Peters voice, anyone else have that?
---
The *Ass Slinging Splasher*
---
&gt; Disconnect penalties need to not be a joke.
---
Penalties don't do anything but punish people who crash/get infinite loading screen. Those people who are the problem just die on hook. It will not make things better. 
---
The game isn't stable/bug free enough to have that kind of a penalty built in, you will have more innocent people getting hit.
---
&gt;Losing all events still seems like a bad move.
---
The events are just differently colored generators/hooks and cosmetics. I don't think we're losing that much. The rift at least makes people play differently, tho some of the challenges are questionable.
---
Lol What goes through the "hackers" head? What does he achieve by that?
---
everytime i entered a locker she growed
---
Imagine how boring it would be to hack on this game.
---
5 stacks of Hope lets you instadown Mori, which is better for slowing down gens since it can't be countered by gen tapping
---
I don't enjoy farming.  
---
So if you don't hook me after pointing at a hook, so I can leave the match, bet I'm gonna dc.
---
It's all-time peak. The way steam presents is kinda misleading.
---
Ring of Elysium, for example, has had ~10k players more or less on average in last few months.
---
Dont forget the fucking bloodweb! Its an amplifier to the problem you mentioned! Its beyond disgusting that it takes well over 10 hours of play to equipt one single character with meta perks (even longer to grind them out on the various characters). There are freemiums with less grind. It makes the rank difference even worse, its bad enough skill wise but if all you can bring is rank 1 self care against a red rank full meta drift king billy, or rank 1 discord against a ds, bt, adrenaline ,dead hard 4 man death squad its just pathetic. In addition to this once you started you are best off dedicating all your resources on one side, or its going to take twice as long before you can become effective at the game as you spread out your meager bp on the perk roulette on both sides, and grind out the other side with the one you choose first, creating a whole bunch of people who only ever played one side, and not by choice.
---
The fucking ulcer that is the blood web perk roulette needs to be excised from the game.
---
All the one's that sit against the external wall of the map are completely useless for Survivors, unless they stun the Killer.
---
The basement is outdated. Back in the sabo meta it was reasonable to have it be so strong since it was the only place that was safe to hook people at.
---
Now it just leads to very boring matches where if certain killers are camping it you just have to give up on saving the teammate and hold m1 on gens with NOBODY having any real fun.
---
And the game failed on steam as well because of trash developers.
---
It has on average 500 players a day.
---
Good, fuck them.
---
Is it me or are most Claudette's fucking trash at chases? Most of them just rely on stealth and once that barrier is breached they have absolutely no clue what to do lol.
---
Could've just said that lol, thank u
---
Why does meg look extra thicc
---
PC red rank killers get instant queues. New rank reset makes it so more people stick around red/purple ranks, so queues are faster in the higher ranks while green/yellow get nothing.
---
90% of DCs are rage quits or people who don't want to play against X perk/Killer/map/item.
---
Besides, the initial DC penalty is less than a minute, so its not the end of the world. If your internet is so bad that you are accruing worse penalties, why are you trying to play multiplayer games in the first place?
---
Woman, but I appreciate the sentiment!
---
And the fact that all Players do the same challenges at the start of a Tome greatly disrupts the game and people dc alot more once they realize they cant do the challenge in that game...
---
Fortnite has a deaf mode where you get visual indicators for gun sounds. The closer you are to the sound, the more opaque and wider the indicators are. As drawback, the sound is turned off in this mode so no abusing that *and* the hearing aspect. DBD could do the same.
---
Left behind, urban evasion, Spine chill, Sprint burst blendette with a key on Macmillan Estate.
---
Living the dream tbh.
---
More like: stressful and cause burnout.
---
Yeah they've been heavily nerfed but still fun to play. Dont be afraid to use your ability just to catch up to people and what I like to do is activate feral frenzy, then hit a survivor and try to follow them so you can body block them and then deactivate feral frenzy.
---
You just have finish it, you don’t have to do the entire thing. Just coordinate with a friend or in the pregame lobby and run bond with Nancy’s perk that shows others what gen you’re on. I got it first try with my friend leaving his gens 99% for me to come finish.
---
"A chance to talk to teammates and/or killer"

If I can’t boop that adorable snoot... just kill me now...
---
How would it be bannable? You aren’t working with the killer unless you’re impeding other survivors
---
And it's pretty safe to say they don't play their own game. Hence the horrific balance, map design and tons of redundant or useless stuff in the game. The only thing that works in DBD is the most basic idea behind the game, which is chasing and playing hide go seek.
---
Back when he was leaked on PC, his name was "The Ghost". His DLC description even refers to him as that name.
---
Man I tried, forgot to turn on my hacks
---
This piece of ART here is fucking amazing. I mean it's so detailed. Like the detail is amazing. It's something I would stare at for a couple minutes just so I could appreciate all the detail and hard work put into it because it's so perfect.
---
Well, you clearly didn't try hard enough, did ya?
---
Self care and sprint burst? Maybe in rank 20.
---
No, ranking up shouldn't be tied to how many bloodpoints you spent.
---
Well it's console so no wonder you lived
---
I was the Detective Tapp in this game, and I saw someone floating in the air; I just assumed a glitch on my end.
---
After seeing them get attacked and then heal instantly, I knew they were hacking.
---
Tried getting you to attack me /u/Contamijin so you could atleast get some points for the abysmal game.
---
I do it only if the killer tunnels or camps. If you’re going to play like an ass I can reciprocate.
---
Not sure what's worse, the fact they were hacking or the fact they wasted god pallet
---
It's not that he's good, it's that Deep Wounds is a stupid mechanic that's boring as fuck.
---
You bought a boring killer?
---
If you are rank 20 it could take some time to get a match since the system trys to give you people with similar rank. Once you're rank 15 it should be faster. Also, for me, playing in the afternoon i get instant survivor queues and at evening i get instant killer queues.
---
2) Literally every killer is fine butni suggest getting Leatherface tongrt the BBQ perk (it gives you double bloodpoints). Then play whatever you like
---
Oh snap sorry man, yeah I can't understand why this fuck wit decided it would be a good idea to hack
---
I’ve never had a farm game as far as I know. Either the killer straight heads for all of us or the survivors all gen rush hard. 
---
I wouldn’t mind seeing a farming game at least once. :( especially as I’m new and don’t exactly have a lot of bps.
---
I like the second one but the other two are way too situational, that’s a problem with lots of survivor perks the devs make, don’t get me wrong there is isnaely good survivor perks (before I get any hate) but I’d prefer more perks that are way less situational, that’s one of the reasons why I enjoy killers so much cause the perks you use at 95% always in use in the match, this is my opinion, lmk if you think different :)
---
Real talk, if other studio decide to make their version of DBD, with skills, builds, monsters/killers/hunters/psychos and it's essentially hide-go-seek with a lot of chasing, I'm dropping DBD in a heartbeat.
---
All they have to do is have a better map design, or even allow the community to create their own maps with an editor, and we are good to go.
---
I hate people that stand in the gates against Myers. Especially the ones that feed him stalk so they can teabag and there are still some people left not at a gate yet.
---
If it's a 110 killer then you have actual infinite loops
---
Thanks for sharing?
---
Someone literally camped my friend who they had in the basement, then said it was okay because they were the killer. I just can’t respect that play style, and I’ve noticed it’s more frequent now.
---
Couldn't agree more, he hacks and takes away the best pallet, D I S R E S P E C C
---
1. Rank 15-20 killer queues take a while. Green ranks have the fastest queue times for me.
---
2. I'd say Trapper or Billy (assuming all you have is the killers that come with the base game).

* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
He has no map pressure and any non oblivious survivor can see him coming. He’s not terrible but he’s definitely nowhere near top 3 or even top 5.
---
People don’t play clown cause a lot of people (myself included) find him really boring
---
Pog
---
That's what I don't like about the tomes. They encourage shitty playstyles or farming
---
amazing!!! id put that on my wall.
---
Wish I could have tried some of the old bugs.. Now the bugs are all just missing sounds, perks not working and killer abilities not working correctly.
---
IDK how players, in a sea of Freddy, Legion, Spirit and even Ghostface and Plague, still find Doctor annoying to play against. I groan when I play against doc only cause I know it's about to be an almost braindead easy match.
---
The problem is they never acknowledged that there were problems with his strength. Leading me to believe that the devs don't think he needs buffs. This is his REWORK. This is the time to change the frustrating parts AND buff his power. And from what they've shown they aren't really doing that.
---
I'll wait until I see the rest of the doc changes, but from what I've seen so far doc there's one buff (the no mode switching)  and multiple nerfs (no exhaustion, no static field, 60 SECOND cooldown on the static blast). They way BHVR adjusts killers, whatever state Doc is in come next mid-chapter is the state he'll be in for the next year at the least.
---
problem?.jpg
---
Imahine that bug but with current Kindred as well
---
Yet it punishes good killers who don’t actually tunnel and know their shit.
---
I find this too. It's 11am here so right now I know I'll get survivor queues straight away and killer queues will be 5-15 mins but when it hits like 6pm they switch around and it's the killer queues that are fast
---
I feel like they internationally make more Survivor perks situational because there could be multiple people running the same perk so odds are if all 4 Survivors are running say: Unbreakable only one of them is probably gonna get it off.
---
You don't want the chat. Trust me
---
https://youtu.be/-5bHxDL8pTQ
---
Nea has done this before!
---
Yea that makes a lot of sense
---
I’d rather have more killers than the base game improve.
---
Money talks.
---
Maybe. I’m eastern time zone in the US so it probably is different
---
run spine chill and a good exhaustion perk. it's all about line of sight and situational awarness. huntress and nurse  are  the slowest killers in the game. use your camera to look behind you in chases. it's easy to dodge huntress then and juke the nurse.
---
Yeah, the servers are spazzing out. I had something similar happen yesterday on The Game. I started healing on the top of the open silo, where you can vault and fall down, suddenly mid heal I got downed and the nurse picked me in a completely different spot on the map.
---
A better question would be, why is the game allowed to continue when someone DC's this early? 5 or 4 gens with 3 people is complete waste of everyone's time.
---
i can understand him. topless oni would be perfect. 
---
looks really good
---
Look, Ash is pretty much the only nice thing about long queues, okay?
---
"Are we gonna be here *all* day?"
---
That's the real challenge. *To be allowed* to hook someone in the basement, without them DCing during carrying..
---
Noed sure is a treat in solo queue
---
Agreed, instead of having fun, I'm trying these challenges that feel tedious and tilt me every time I get close to getting it, then of course fail because most survivors aren't completely vrain dead.
---
And even if you finally manage to get one if those hard challenges, you don't feel like you achieved something, you only feel relief that it is finally over.
---
If the next tome is as badly designed as this one, I'll just no bother with it anymore. 
---
I play a game to have fun, not to rage and be tilted for half the day after failing the same challenge god knows how many times
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
call me a masochist but I enjoyed old freddy more than new freddy (love them both though)
---
my goodness this. I'm addicted to demo for some reason
---
If they go friendly on me because of shitty teammates I give them shit.  Refuse the hatch, start walking slowly and sabo'ing hooks til they take the hint that they should just get it over with.
---
And still players think they're punishing the killer instead of the other survivors.
---
Demo feels more balanced. Pig needs some tweaks.
---
Remember how easy it was? Just a shitty .jpg template you probably downloaded from 9Gag, and some white text.
---
Now there’s just a “flavour of the week” meme that gets stale in 4 days thanks to everyone and their grandma on social media/dork culture.
---
I'd rather get the sacrifice bonus instead of mori.
---
This nurse picked me in the same spot I died, I'm afraid it's a symptom of lag switching? She was just fine until someone dropped a pallet on her while she was carrying a survivor. I'm not sure if this is still a thing since dedicated servers came out but it seems so, at least for me.
---
I have just reached 670h in DBD and can say I really do love this game, but I have no idea what is going to happen in the future in its current state. I feel like it's getting worse and they just don't care.
---
Who in the history of DbD has ever said this????
---
Too difficult for Easy AntiCheat to find

---
This was hilarious. Thank you for making the community a better place.
---
Wow remember survivors have keys to escape when they haven’t even finished their objectives....
---
They can move of they arent dumb
---
Yeah, and that is why they need to look over her.
---
Exactly. Is the Pig easy to loop?

And what is satisfying?
---
You can't lag switch with on a dedicated server. When it's p2p and you host, you say where's you location hence why speed hacking and lag switching is easy. When there's a server between you and the other players you are told where your location is, and you can't really temper with that.
---
Instant heal needed a nerf and bl was to stop an exploit in haddonfield. Maybe, this was also because survivors had a higher survive rate, and killers needed more attention. That doesn’t mean they’re favoured, otherwise top tier killers would be getting buffed all the time
---
That's what the game originally was, and guess what? People stopped fearing the killer. They learnt to abuse anything and everything amd they became quite literally invincible.
---
My hag flailing around in panic :P. Thanks to the survivors for not DC-ing. I couldn't pm you as game got dropped after
---
It’s pretty easy to spot when a killer has BBQ tho. If they immediately hook someone then go for someone hiding, boom ya know. Then you just gotta pay attention and hide in a locker whenever someone is about to be hooked.
---
Thanks my dude, I guess I'll try to get through the ranks to unlock decent matchmaking lmao
---
I gave up half way through level 3. It's like you said it's just tedious. There were some I liked, like escape using hope or whatever but I hate the ones that's like "fully deplete 4 keys" because it amounted to nothing. Just take a green key, load it with aura addons, hold right click at the start of the match until it runs out and repeat for 4 games. Pointless and dull.
---
I use Whispers to prevent boring ass games where two are dead and the last 2 just hide for 10 minutes.
---
Well if a survivor is abusing the glitch ya they deserve to be tunneled.  That likes saying if the killer used the infinite mend glitch on you you have to stay in the match or ruin the game for the killer and the other 3 survivors
---
Stake Out, Kindred, Detectives Hunch
---
Cheers, I read wraith was a good starter but I guess those were old posts and he's been nerfed since then? But yea I have only the base chars and I'm not buying currency, and as far as I'm aware you can buy every killer that's not licenced with the currency?
---
stake out gang rep
---
Morality is a thin line when bloodpoints are involved.
---
afaik there is none.
---
Very few artists like what they create. All we do is see the flaws in it and where we could improve it. I'm pretty hard on myself all the time.
---
But this, to me, is perfect. Excellent work, and the bloody/rusty color adds a whole next level to it.
---
There are like 7 ways to counter bbq, 8 if you count not being a bitch and taking that your aura is read.
---
Don't know what you mean by this? You don't manually join servers in DBD, the matchmaking system automatically does all that for you.
---
On even purple ranks and using only audio/visual clues will net you all gens done and 4 survs tbagging at the gates.
---
You could’ve probably looped it like 10 times before dropping the pallet. He was looping so wide.
---
Hes right this sucks
---
np salty redditor
---
I faced against a hacker Doctor yesterday. He had the fucking railgun build and wallhacks, noclip and teleportation. He would constantly zap me feom across the map until I went into max madness and once I snapped out he'd immediatly zap me back again while killing my teammates (though he did play regularly during chase) this went on until 1 guy was dead and the 2 others were slugged. At that point I just gave up and stood there looking at him as he revealed that he could fly. Then he downed me and flew us out the exit gate.
---
Why, detectives hunch does not show traps?
---
Nerfs, you mean new cosmetics, would follow legions example.
---
They won't do it unless a chapter gets boycotted which also won't happen
---
Spine chill, kindred, and probably more perks to counter
---
OP is suggesting DH shows traps, chests and totems instead of gennies, chests, and totems. He’s also suggested a 20 second increase in duration. His suggestion is basically directly countering trapper. Being able to see the aura of all traps within that range after completing a genny will allow the survivor to disarm most of the traps using a combination of the small game and saboteur perks. Basically making trapper extra useless
---
I would have left that Dwight and escaped, I don't want to risk getting hit.
---
she was trying to get away from bubba, thats why i love the perk that lets you crawl faster and recover at the same time, would have been even more clutch in this situation
---
If you do well as killer, you tunneled and camped. If you don't do well, you are garbage, gg ez, shit killer and so on.
---
And it doesn't get better with the higher ranks. I made the mistake of buying another DLC and played The Plague against rank 2 and 1 survivors. I managed to get 2 kills, for a first game with 3 perks is not the worst outcome. This didn't stop the survivor crew from flaming, so a bit of an advice here just move on asap.
---
yup I'll do 3 gens run then around for three minutes  cleanse Totems  find a purple flashlight and then... NOED...
---
its so clear he hit before u drop
---
very smart of Meg to open the chest, without the medkit wouldnt be able to recover nea fast enough
---

I'm pretty sure they mean the dedicated servers and where they are located. Unfortunately for them I don't think BHVR have told us where they are

Saw a nea tried to heal me off hook with Michael clearly coming, this was auto haven so she clearly saw him. Next she saves me on second hook while a Claudette is a few seconds from death the next hook down. Oh and here was the kicker I looped the killer few minutes no gens pop, just me and her killer leaves I kid you not 5 seconds later she gets grabbed from a locker.
---
I sure love solo queuing and get a RANK 8 nea who is worse than my mate whose rank 17
---
I love it. If I'm playing solo I have it all the time. I can see what the team is doing if someone else is hooked now and know if I need to leave to save. Or just keep doing gens.
---
Your friend is a really nice artist! Does he draw other stuff?
---
山=mountain 岡=hill
---
Yeah because you see so many survivors escaping with keys lol. Go play the other side instead of whining.
---
My question is where the hell do you get the time to play and finish them for both PS4 and PC? And why even play both to begin with when you have a PC?
---
It's not perfect tho, it looks nice but when you inspect it with a critical eye it's not surprising the see the artist disliking it.
---
Why meg..?
---
Okay but you dont have to link it everywhere
---
Is Legion boring for you? Why?
---
Blast through gens and sacrifice if people don't have the exhaustion perks and perks to initiate a safe save. But even then if the killer is a camper they will most likely tunnel the person you just freed so best to gen rush and escape.
---
Yea I used that I used one of their hotel zip code and address

M1 killer with the power to make someone self care twice. Not exactly engaging gameplay for either sides. I’m rank 3 on both killer and survivor and most people either dc when I play it or dc when we play against it.
---
''Unfun'' Well if Survs would care about Killers fun they wouldn't be toxic to you. If survs are toxic you can bet people will camp and slug them. Toxic breeds toxic. That's the first rule of universe.
---
If you didnt even know what killer this is, i dont think you should be calling stuff OP without proper knowledge
---
I'm still waiting for a ban for farming the 4 grabs challenge. I was promised one.

They sure do

You can save shards to get nonlicensed killers but that takes a while.l
---
Wraith just isn't good because his power doesn't help him at all unless the survivors you play against are blind.
---
A lot of perks feel like cheating when you use them against newer survivors who don't know how to counter them. BBQ's aura reading is *very* easy to counter once the survivors know you have it.
---
Nancy before the enchantment
---
Sprint Burst is life. Gotta go fast. I love my wife 😌
---
Well, you could have done totems
---
Yeah, there are plenty of ways to counter it.
---
The fact that adrenalin ignores exhaustion and gets stored if you're on the hook is absolutely ridiculous
---
? I’m describing the person who doesn’t take chase. I understand what makes good teammates in dbd. ?
---
outstanding

Pizza dwight cant complete with dwelf, its just too cute.

This looks like the person I ran into today, same character, look and med kit. This was on pc correct?
---
Double bloodpoints at 4 stacks.
---
'Nuff said.
---
I rarely ever rely on the information it gives you. And besides, if Bbq is cheating, so is literally every perk that gives you infornation. Thrilling Tremors, Whispers, Nurse's. Discordance. Rancor, Infectious Fright. They're all cheating then, because why focus on sounds and tracking when you can just rely on the auras, notifications and noises?
---
That was tense af. Gj!
---
For the 4k basement challenge i just 3 hooked everyone and on their 3rd carried them to the basement.
---
About 5 games however had survivors DC then flame me in chst for being a scumbag. Should have just camped.
---
If you think BBQ and Chilli is cheating then I can't wait to hear your thoughts on Whispers, Thrilling Tremors and Infectious Fright.
---
I love how ppl think "im the killer" is an excusr to be a dick. If survs were called team A and killer team B it would be the same. Its just a name. If you slug last person you are a toxic cunt
---
I did 5 basement hooks with trapper by trapping the shit out of it.
---
Took few tries still and f that 4 sacrifices one, I don't even bother.
---
Yes it was on pc
---
This would resolve the issue of the basement being used as the ultimate camping ground that can descend a whole match into hell. Between, stealth killers, Insidious perk, and any powers or perks that create the Exposed status or traps the basement can be used as a cheap way camp, lure in everyone else, and down or trap everyone. It really does need to exits, not one. It's also awful when the Killer is territory camping outside the basement, you get unhooked down there whether that be intentional farming or not, and then the Killer is blocking the only way out and naturally goes for you since you're injured and freshly unhooked and cannot escape unless there's Borrowed Time or DS and Borrowed Time becomes unless when you've got a wild Bubba chainsawing since it ends up counting as two hits.
---
get better internet
---
How long did it take you to do the rift on both of and ps4?
---
Yeah, I had them tonight it ruined my challenge. They were on a gen, I couldn't attack them or the gen, I slugged someone when to hit her and she tanked it started healing someone so I couldn't pick them up. It was really annoying, a teammate called them out at the end.
---
I don't play killer a lot because Im usually a nice killer. If you escape then I'm happy for you and I hope you had fun. If you die then I'm sorry, but I hope you had fun or learned something about the killer I played. However I'm always bullied so I've stopped playing killer, Im tired of a flashlight being clicked at me the whole match and I'm tired of being teabagged by the whole team at the exit gates. So I just play survivor and only play how I am treated. If the killer is toxic to me when I've done nothing to them then I mimic their behavior. Regardless though if 2 people dc before a gen is done then I farm because at the end of the day the remaining survivors are being good sports and they just want to have fun. Its not their fault that they got stuck with assholes...
---
Good job. As Ghostie Main, you put a smile on my face, thx a lot.

For the "Obsessive" challenge on the level 3 challenge page do you need to more the obsession or can you sacrifice them?

A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one

It's a good drawing but i realize why your friend wouldn't like it due to the Oni's Body Portions, the 2 arms look different in size and his upper body is a little disportionate. Your friend probably realized his flaws and didn't like it so try to push him to fix it and he'll love it
---
BHVR: *Shrugging tom*
---
They will get salty, but the problem is if you do like they say you get lesser results. I'm not even sure if those who complain actually play the killer side.

Not that I remember but I completed the PS4 a week ago and the PC this week.  That's all I can remember.  I already reached level 70 on PS4 and still only level 60 despite already completing the Rift.

In case you're confused it doesn't say sacrifice so you just have to hook people 5 times in the basement in a trial

You probably only play survivor. If you watch any content from people who played over 5k hours, they do say the gen speed is too fast and they play the survivor side aswell. What are you gonna say about them? I assure you that they're also better then you and I.

They did mention that they intended you to reach the top tier with the original difficulty of the tomes. When they toned down the difficulty, they warned us that we shouldn't expect to reach top tier upon finishing the tome anymore, since easier challenges meant less games to complete.

If you do nothing for two minutes as well, then yes.

I enjoy playing Amanda but I know for a fact I'm not the best piggy around so my opinions are probably garbage ;-;.
---
Her ambush is pretty good on loops if the survivor is a potato (Ambush one way to fake a survivor that you are committing to that direction but 180 instead during the ambush) or small ones that are already mostly unsafe. Also if you try to use ambush at loops some survivors just keep running so I take a mental note of those ones and use ambush to scare them from the pallet.
---
Unfortunately some of the loops on Thompson's house are unable to be mind gamed (talking about those pallets near the long fences close to the house.) For those you have to bite the bullet and be looped to get rid of them quickly since mind games are almost impossible there. 
---
There are some piggy mains out there to watch but I can't think of their names off the too of my head :(.
---
Big negative experience?
---
Punishment for cheating and or constant toxic behavior.

it is about damn time a survivor main admitted it...shit

Sarcasm? Never. This drawing is simply detestable.
---
and it's useless if you know the winning rules...
---
Tell me then, after hooking the survivor at end game collapse, what can you do that will net you another hook before the guy you decide to chase instead reaches the 99% gate, meanwhile the other two unhooks the survivor and escape through the othee gate?
---
If you don't trust my "inexperience" as a killer, then I can at least say for sure that I'm almost 98% of the time able to unhook the survivor with or without getting hit and everyone survives just because he left his hook.
---
Likewise, spirit and nurse were needed nerfs.
---
If games were survivors sided like u implying they wouldnt have nerfs for the last 3 years with DS nerf, MoM nerf, med vault and shits like that.
---
&gt; Getting a 1k is a lot better then nothing
---
no. not anymore.
---
You can act sarcastic all you want, but if you consistently lose as survivor on The Game, which you are leading me to believe, then the simple fact is you're bad with pallet management.  
---
That map is pretty much full of safe pallets, and a good survivor can run pretty much any M1 killer for a very long time.  
---
So, yes, you are in fact a bad survivor.
---
I wouldn't say it's cheating, BBQ is just one of those low effort max gains perks that everyone seems to be running on pretty much every rank.
---
Sometimes I wish people would be brave enough to dare changing their perk loadouts, but I'ts not going to happen.
---
The survivors are worse than the killers when it comes to this though. They'll be super quick to judge the killer on his playstyle or performance but god forbid if they're ever forced to play solo with less than optimal perks.
---
Imagine playing this game on the red ranks all day with your SWF team and have everyone run Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike etc... guess going for the EZ wins is fun for some people.
---
Rank 1 Noed spicy.
---
Sorry, I didn't see this earlier.  I'm currently on a 7 week forced holiday as I'm a casual so I have plenty of time to play.  I also started out on PS4 and like its instant recording ability (it records the last 30 mins of your game).  I think I can do that too on PC but I haven't figured out how to extend it from the last 30secs to last 30mins.  And also, I feel my PS4 set up is more in-sync, sound/controller wise.
---

I swear you always get this at rank 2 trying to hike it to rank 1 and somehow get paired with a rank 10 Billy ebony Mori nodding like a maniac after he downs you once, and on the hook you see all 3 teammates crouched near you but no one actually coming to get you.
---
 killer mains could press the "cry harder" button and all the dumb shit they tell themselves firmly established itself as fact in their handicapped brains then all survivors just explode. Counts as a quad mori and the killer ranks up to 1 instantly like they always wet dreamed about.
---
I would normally work on gens but I would see teammates not trying to go for the save. So I feel bad and wanna save them. Sometimes no, it isn't worth it. Most would disconnect after one hook if a killer is camping. I appreciate it. Gotta make the most of every match.
---
You can try to get as many hit as possible on other survivors. if a survivor rescue his teamate during that time you get an other chance to down him again and get one more hook.
---
Anyway you won't win anything from assuring ONE kill by camping at the end.
---
That is so good pleade get him to make more
---
I was thinking that. But there are always survivors who try to help and end up being screwed right along with the hooked survivor. It's not impossible to do gens by myself, but I try to save at least one so I have help.
---
He sees you but you can't see him, cause of undetectable status.
---
Except they didn't take into account terrible queue times, DC's, terrible teammates, super sweaty killers and scumbag survivors. Long queue times have been the biggest hindrance in getting tiers reasonably fast personally.
---
Poor Feng :(
---
At this point BHVR should just embrace the meme and give Claudette a skin-tight black bodysuit cosmetic.
---
This.  People who cheat on computer games cheat on relationships, jobs, and any other opportunities to take from others when they think they won’t get caught or the penalties are too minor to discourage.  They should be hunted down and exterminated like the cancer to society they are.
---
1) matchmaking is currently bad. They said they're gonna fix it in january, but i wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
2) wraith is the best killer for a newbie, in my opinion. You can get a good grasp of the game with him, understand how to track survivors and how to catch them. He can find survivors and start chasing them pretty easily thanks to his invisibility, but after that it will be up to you.
---
you don't lose speed, the issue is at that point they aren't in the saws hitbox. Bubba's saw only hits directly in front of him in a fairly narrow box shaped hit box.
---
plus the other major issue is it doesn't matter. even if you play the good old tree looping perfectly, taking the turns with laser like precision, it still isn't going to eat the Survivor unless the tree is thinner than a toothpick. Bubba's saw is THAT bad.
---
I equipped Bond during my last game as solo survivor… never again
---
unless if they use that add-on which infinite blinds you, did happen to me today
---
It's called the hook tech. All you have to do to counter it is to just camp both survivors and don't try to hot the guy behind the hook because you can't. This way you are keeping 2 survivors from doing gens while one is dying on hook.
---
But the safest is to camp and get hook #1, #2 and death hook points. Perhaps you can get another hook or hits on over-altruistic survivors and that can net you a lot more than loosing your hook and perhaps hitting a survivor or two. There is a strategic means to camping at end game collapse. You might not like it but it is the way it is
---
It's all fun and games until the Huntress lands a cross map hatchet on your friend's ass.
---
I like the aesthetics but hate the gameplay. The RNG is annoying too, either you get rooms with one door and like 3 windows out or you get completely useless windows with a door next to them...or no windows.
---
Entire map has like 7 pallets too which turns almost every chase into Bloodlust 9000 Simulator. Also terribly boring with Billy, Huntress or Oni.
---
Yeah same. It sucks cus realistically that’s his best addon. I’ll get a few every other bloodweb but that’s about it
---
Yes she is.
---
Hope she has balanced landing
---
I like dota2 pseudo-random distribution(PRD). Heres an exapmple:" On melee heroes, Skull Basher's Bash has a 25% chance to stun the target. On the first attack, however, it only has an ~8.5% probability to bash. Each subsequent attack without a bash increases the probability by ~8.5%. So on the second attack, the chance is ~17%, on the third it is ~25.5%, etc. After a bash occurs, the probability resets to ~8.5% for the next attack. These probabilities average out so that, over a moderate period of time, Bash effect procs nearly 25% of the time."
---

---
Getting a flashlight save actually does take a degree of skill because you have to time it perfectly, flashlighting the killer at every single pallet during the breaking animation is just excessive and annoying though.
---
I've been using the blood web to get borrowed time or DS, but I have yet to come across them. I am only a level 16 and just started playing about 5 days ago, so I may need to get more blood points to spend before I come across them. 
---
You are right. I do my best to knock out gens as much as possible, but it could be other survivors who make it easier for the killer to stay in one place. I'll be sure to keep that in mind. At this rate, it seems as though I have to go with my gut feelings until I get better perks and better at the game. It's just a game, I don't take it seriously. But it's more fun when killers are actually playing strategically.
---
Put on the right addon. Throw in a Bloody Party Streamer. Signal to the survivors that you are friendly and want to farm. Pray they play ball. Grab them while they are doing gens or unhooking.
---
No he wasn’t? It was completely relevant to the post and hilariously easy to follow.
---
Assuming “veuge” is supposed to be “vague”
---
Worst painting I have ever seen dawg
---
Can you explain why a 1k is not better then nothing? I don’t see how that’s really fact.
---
I really recommend finding a SWF discord and playing with team mates that show 'tegrity, even if they're not the greatest at the game. First off it's much more fun this way, secondly you won't be as frustrated when you know that your team has your back or you can tell them that there's an Insidious camper Leatherface waiting for them to go to the basement for the unhook.
---
He's easily the worst concieved killer in the game. You pretty much nailed it.
---
However I still like playing as Legion even though I rarely get a 4k match at rank 4. He's just weak and poorly designed from a power perspective imo.
---
If it's one person, I learn they just disconnect with camping/tunneling killers anyway. I just don't like when two are hooked and one has disconnected. Leaving me to fend for the gens myself. Makes it a lot more difficult at times. I am lower leveled, but I try to save one so I can have the help on gens if possible.
---
Ye faced a similair cheater and he also made these weird little turns as I was about to hit. I reported him on the website and he got banned next day.
---
Bro I use the same kate outfit but with black hair for stealth

Yeah it was supposed to be vague, but i couldnt tell he was talking spacifically about this, alsp why did so many people downvote
---
it won't make you get an emblem in Devout and it will hurt your chaser emblem point as well.
---
Devs definitely need to add a tutorial section for pipping in this game...
---
How can He think this is bad??? Like honestly
---
Ah, I see. You have a swell day then. You haven’t obviously thought about the situation very much
---
I was full health anyway lol

My vote is shirtless bill... he’s a sexy mofo
---
Wallhack Mikey is so fun on that map. Boo! I'm a spooky William Shatner!
---
Also those gens in the hallways are basically in huge dead zones if they aren't nearby one of the 2 story rooms. Unless your team goes full coordinated ora-ora-ora on one of those things with Prove Thyself and some toolboxes, they will end up being part of a guaranteed 3 gen where you can keep smacking survivors for free hits until everyone is slugged or hooked.
---
This really isn't hard though?
---
Ohh...you always want to down survivors after 20 seconds because it isn't already easy enough to down survivors and get easy 4k's?
---
Everyone starts somewhere, you know? You just have to keep practicing. It's the same with the progress you made as survivor between now and when you first started playing. And playing from the killer's perspective will really help you open your eyes to a lot of things. I've definitely became a better survivor by playing killer, and visa versa.
---
I generally show no mercy unless there is a baby Dwight in my game that doesn't know how to look behind him during a chase. This is because I like my blood points, and I play for myself. Plus giving them freebies doesn't help them grow - it just makes them feel more entitled and dependant. This is why you see these memes about survivors complaining that the killer didn't give them hatch even though they weren't struggling. But you do you. Let me or anyone else tell you how to play.
---
Lmao if this is hard for u have fun killing all in the basement
---
I actually like Ormond as a map: yes the center building has strong loops for survivors, but outside is not that easy to navigate without being seen, gen placement is Ok, basement in the central building is really strong.
---
As a killer, there are lots of maps that make me go "urgh" (Haddonfield, Badham, Leery's, Coldwind, Red forest), but Ormond is never one of those
---
You chose the worst map for this too
---
Thanks, guessing same applies for ghostface.
---
Weird thing is that whenever they see me they don't come to me and that's happening on purple/green.
---
That’s one monster he can’t slay
---
Way to go guys. You all fell for it. It's a fake plea for upvotes and coin or whatever it is. Even if an artist is most critical of their own stuff, there is no way that they are truly upset with this. This is like that self anointed for from HS that clearly knows she is beautiful, but whines all the time that she isn't because she loves to hear people tell her she is.
---
I mean maybe I'm just a natural at playing killer but I never played killer until these challenges (rank 1 surv for years now btw) and completed them all pretty much on the first try.

---
I like Ormond as killer too, but I might be the exception.
---
It seems well balanced with pros and cons for both sides
---
There's a few ways to drop pallets on killers consistently. First way is to loop a pallet, and on the last repetitive, take a step or 2 past the pallet to make them think you are starting another rep, then 180 turn and drop the pallet on them. Another way is to take a hit and drop the pallet, lose them, self care, repeat.
---
It helps for you to seek out the killer first because if he chases anyone else, they will use pallets that you could have used. You can run Object of Obsession to ensure you are chased first.
---
You no longer get insanity generation for free now but the base MS being 115 at all times coupled with no stance switching will make him a lot more lethal at loops. 
---
He'll also get a new add-on called the Iridescent Queen that allows you to basically put chain shock bombs on survivors that will shock anyone they come close to. Going to make for some really fun anti-SWF builds. 😎
---
There's a new ptb?
---
Calm down.
---
Yeah, I calmed down writing this.
---
I just don't understand what's the point of killing the fun for others.
---
Agree, I play most killers except nurse and huntress and for the most part its a fine map
---
Ormond might just need a little tweeking of the main building if good survivors can really abuse it that hard, but so far being a purple rank killer, it is one of my favoyrite maps
---
It is not as strong. 
---
Minor improvements? Map design is arguably the worst aspect of the game. Map design is H O R R I D. Haddonfield, Lab, Disturbed Ward, Blood Lodge, Sanctum of Wrath, Ironworks, etc. Too many maps are huge, have broken loops, or can have rng give them strong tiles back to back to back. Map design is just really ... So incredibly bad in my opinion, and it is the sole thing, more than individual killer balance, that prevents this game from being competitive.
---
Found the real virgin.
---
not even gonna say anything...
---
My mindbreaker would be just full gen exhaustion and 5/8/10 sec after leaving stay exhausted.
---
Like the variety ideas for Cruel Limits.
---
Good for you lmao
---
It has so many strong loops though and a frustrating amount of walls with no doors, passage.
---
It might be killer sided, but I don't really enjoy it as killer
---
Not sure why the downvotes. Haddonfield still has problems (infinity fences and House of Pain basement window loop) but it's nowhere near the level of bullshit that you can get on Ormond or Thompson House.
---
Want to see how bad Thompson House is with a good RNG spawn? [Watch this.](https://youtu.be/dhmUwiZ1RGw)
---
Income the ‘ItS eAsY i DiD iT fIrSt TrY’ comments
---
What's the point of Serpent - Soot on Wraith?
---
Also, any general advice? He seems to be the killer I do the best with by far. Only have the base five and not able to buy any of the remainder any time soon.
---
Which killers were released? Ghosty, Demogorgon, Oni, and...? 
---
GF is very strong, easily A tier. 
---
Oni and Demo are solid B. But if Oni gets nerfed more will be C. 
---
I think you're being too generous. There are still plenty of stupid bugs and glitches. No d/c penalty, lying about dedicated servers on console, lack of events, lack of double BP, continuously bad map design, still losing items randomly when the killer DC's or you finish a game normally...
---
Even at red ranks. 90% of games.
---
hook, not sacrifice
---
Yeah got it now lol, bad wording
---
My brother is one of the best artists I’ve ever met, if not the best, and he hated his work, he literally makes perfect drawings and gets rid of them or refuses to enter them in competitions because he thinks they are bad, it’s an actual reaction some people have to just hate what they make even if others think it’s amazing
---
Please stop with your logic. It’s easier for people to tell that they have 500 employees so the game shouldn’t have any issues.
---
Thank god you stopped playing that’s one more whiny player gone.
---
relax brother
---
I was VERY puzzled for a bit there. Just sittin here like "but that's what it says right?" and then I finally got it.
---
In fairness, she does have one of the more interesting backstories of the killers. My personal favourites are Hag's, Wraith's, and the Spirit's so I'll be very happy when they're in the spotlight 👍
---
Iron grasp really don’t see a lot of people use it but I love it
---
Oml yes my exact strat
---
please don't give them ideas
---
windows have to be broken, been happening to me the last few days
---
When the killer picks up a Survivor shine the light in the killers eyes
---
That was me. Sorry.
---
I'm chill as a cucumber, brother.
---
Obviously outplayed.
---
Use a pallet slam/Wait for the killer to break the pallet and use the flashlight on him then
---
:D
---
Hmm?
---
The killer stats on indoor maps are so good, because gens are hard to find for novice and not so experienced survivors and that's about it.
---
I have over 200 hours (although more on killer than survivor) and I still can't find half the gens on Leery's, the Game and Hawkins)
---
this is art
---
I will never feel sorry for a blendette.
---
I didnt have a game yesterday, where i got queued with my rank. Not once. I got always queued with and against yellow ranks and thats it. Its driviing me insane playing with ppl, who crouch at every heartbeat. Its so annoying. Yeah might be new players and stuff,but I'm rank 6. Can i please play smth decent
---
My favorite detail is the ropes. Like i cant explain it but the ropes just look really really good on this piece
---
The issue is that while I disagree with being toxic to killers there’s a difference between being a bit cocky at pallets and stuff and then outright preventing someone from playing the game by keeping them on the hook. Also, if plenty of killers camp and tunnel unprovoked anyway.
---
Unfortunately for me, seeing as tombstone + tuft is probably my favourite way to play Myers.
---
This is interesting... I thought baby Megs were extinct. We must protect this Meg at all costs.
---
Being serious now, If I'm playing as survivor and I see another survivor blatantly hacking like this, you better be sure I'll do my best to ruin his match. I'll sandbag the shit out of him.
---
The problem is that it's super frequent to only play one side and complain. If it was a rare occurence then it would be fine but all of this toxicity stems from not playing both sides and thus not understanding them.
---
This person was trying to give her the door and let her escape lmao
---
RIP
---
.... I guess im missing your point. Im not denying i missed, why would i, i posted a video clearly showing me missing repeatedly. I never once claimed i was good. I even said i was lucky.... I get whats going on here, you are clearly a killer and have received grief over tunnelling and camping and that's all fine and dandy because i believe those to be valid tactics in the game. The words "tunnel vision" and "camping" where descriptors (and not in any way a critique) to my video that triggered your child like attempt to mock me like a child would. Go a head, please focus on players and stare at them after a hook, it gives me time to find a way out.
---
hmm… would be more useful for you to see your lack of neurons to maybe get some on Amazon.
---
This is a very common method to improve in any game. If you think a fighting game or MOBA character is OP because you keep losing to it, play it and learn it's limits. More likely than not, you'll come out losing, but at least you would have gained some experience.
---
Unfortunately, people are stubborn or just not interested in playing things outside of their comfort zone. I have friends that complain all the time because they keep losing, so I tell them to play killer to learn, but they aren't interested at all. I think another reason why is because they feel overwhelmed with all the perks they have to work towards getting when they are already struggling getting the survivor perks. So they would just rather main a single side so they don't have to split bloodpoints.
---
If you're a true survivor. You hold on... you know they can't save you so you waste the killers time.
---
If you disconnect you're a bitch and if you're doing it regularly the ban hammer should come down for 24 hours and then a week.
---
They really need to be harsh on the disconnects and show no mercy. "I paid for the game, how dare you ban me!!" - "you spent most of the time disconnecting... we assumed you didnt wanna play"
---
Hate disconnects and hate the people that defend it as a strategy on both killer and survivor side.
---
Stay strong... stay... strong.
---
Sorry I didn't mean to cause offense. I do think that matchmaking should be like this as it is preferable for lobby wait times. I understand it can be frustrating not winning (popping) but it is important to recognize you did well you outplayed two red rank survivors
---
Give up on everything if this is the best they can do...(sarcasm)
---
I got it on accident and almost lost it for the whole team by not finding the hatch. I heard it, couldn’t find it. I eventually did, and the killer wasn’t around either so.
---
Thats another reason, but freddy isnt really much more interesting but still he is played a lot with good results too
---
No it hasn't been in it for at least a month.
---
Yeah I own both perks but hey I'm down with getting Bloodpoints for them :)
---
Let's not forget, of course, that killer is WAY more perk reliant than survivor. For survivors, perks are mostly just helpful, but for killer at a certain point slowdown perks (ruin, pop, and etc) become practically a necessity.
---
I'm leveling up on Switch and I fucking need Ruin desperately. I don't play killers with great map control and the gens are just impossible to control on bigger maps.
---
What i mean is taking survs off hooks immediately so you and killer can get free points and thats how it works most of the time, so if you would record that game, i guess they might be banned, + congratz to all those farmers that gave me a downvote xD, especially for you i wont ever farm
---
Yes this one or PWYF
---
Haha “your friend”?
---
I bet OP is the artist. 
---
Still a good drawing though.
---
I'd rather see this instead of those legitimately shit pencil drawings that just get upvoted out of pity
---
tf does that even mean
---
You say it's better but you dont explain why. The only advantage you stated is the same one I stated, easier mobility (no bump penalty) while hillbilly has the advantage in every other way
---
How do you get a timer like that? Seems usefull for dodging ds.
---
You have this on github or anything by chance?
---
+20 &amp; -20... Perfectly balanced... as all things should be
---
Look at Me, I'm the captain now.
---
Anyone else confused?
---
Hmm that sucks sounds like you are with low rank team mates. You can get a guaranteed pallet stun if you are willing to get hit. You literally stand under the pallet and wait for them to lunge. You can even wait until the hit goes off and they are wiping the blade to drop the pallet.
---
If they absolutely refuse to swing u stand there the whole game whole team does gens.
---
if I were you that would have scared the FUCK out of me
---
Agitation and Iron Grasp meant I did it in 2 tries
---
What is it
---
it is amazing uwu
---
Delete it
---
I agree its really annoying, but that helps survivors to break the chase or win some extra time and that's completely fair, it's their objective after all so...
---
I get this pretty often when I start up the game. I usually turn off the PlayStation and network router for a minute and try again. I don’t know why it works but usually seems to fix the issue.
---
dude… you won't get far by playing the victim.  once again get some neurons, try to understand basic logic thanks to that and don't waste people time by not helping the discussion
---
^^hlep
---
Thanks for the tips! Also, can you not level up in private matches? Me and my friends got it to play with eachother but we cant level up. Do i have to play public games?
---
The problem I have, is that so many maps can be described this way. Even notorious maps like Ormond can be pretty shit for either side if you get a bad configuration, Lery's isn't even the worst in this regard.
---
Thanks for the tips everyone!
---
But if you complete the rift you won't have to spend any more CASH to buy the next one.
---
So let's not be naive here, it is working as intended
---
You dont seriously think that add on combo is op do you?  Literally the worst "op" thing in the game
---
How is DS toxic? Maybe before the rework, but now is really balanced 🤔
---
Stake Out is my guilty Survivor pleasure because then I can sail through Ruin with my brain turned off and it fucks Terror Radius Doc over.
---
Shadowborn is my Killer guilty pleasure as I've been spoiled by higher PC FPS in recent years and the higher FOV feels too comfy.
---
Ormond is really survivor sided. The entire map is a circle where all save pallets are connected to eachother. Also a garunteed to spawn extra god pallet upstairs of the main building.
---
As a killer main, I say this is ludicrous.
---
If I win because I can run my very best build, than get rewarded by running it again, I'll never need to use to bloodweb ever again.
---
Here's to pink and violet addons every game 🐶
---
These are awesome!!!
---
Nah, it's just a minor program but I can share the code if you want me to.
---
An Ebony Mori is far more powerful than any key. It's not even a question.  Keys are unfair to a normal killer, because you could be winning all game, but if they get enough gens done, it doesn't matter how quickly you down them, if enough gens get done, 2 or 3 can escape and you can't do anything about it, except for constantly have someone downed or on hook, and the remaining survivors could still duck out.
---
But an Ebony Mori is way worse. Especially if a killer decides to tunnel or camp, then they don't have to worry about an extra chase. And even if they don't, skipping 1 hook state is an insane advantage, and the second 1 survivor is dead, the game is thrown way into the killers favor.
---
I just leveled up Hag to 40 for it she has some good perks.
---
Rank 3 both sides POGGIES
---
Survivors disconnecting is one of the dumbest things ever. I’m a killer main and usually every two games at least one persons dcs. It’s so aggravating because you could try to do a challenge and one of them disconnects and then you have to start over on that challenge. They should make something to where there was either three strikes and you are banned for a day and then the punishment gets worst from there or something that identity v has like surrendering where if all the the survivors are down, they can surrender.’, and you would still get the points for like a sacrificed survivor. But that would take the fun out of trying to slug them and let them bleed out, but I don’t really care about what bhvr does with disconnecting, as long as the people who do it all the time and on purpose gets punished, that’s fine by me
---
I'm doing that, but it's slow and I kinda need to put some of BP earnings into restocking my addons since I'm playing Trapper mianly and I need Bags and Setting Tools ideally.
---
It is cool when a challenge compliments your olay style, but for me shlepping everyone to the basement is very unfun
---
Objectively one of the most metal things I've seen today.
---
I have the most success when getting an early down and getting the headgear on before the first gen.  Pop is almost necessary to counter then 99% gems.  I almost never chase the people with traps on their heads as they usually don’t focus on gens and allows me to chase the other 3 to get even more hooks.
---
We're playing DBD while this man's playing COD
---
Do bones with detective's hunch or small game. I'm solo and I never see NOED.
---
Well good for you I guess ...
---
I wasn't born yesterday, so of course I use those too
---
Pig requires more skill to play effectively than most killers and her add-oms are, henerally speaking, pretty weak. My best advice would be to watch some How to Play Pig videos on youtube, those typically provide good tips with demonstrations.
---
 I don’t think this is yours I remember earlier that someone posted this without the blood and writing saying it wasn’t finished I just did a quick glance through your post history and it isn’t there pretty sure this is plagiarism
---
I honestly can never relate to these as a rank 1 killer I get matches in 2 seconds and as survivor that actually takes anywhere around 3-5 minutes
---
What kind of general advice are you looking for?
---
Is it really supposed to be Oni? Looks more like Hag idk
---
-Forgot about losing items and offerings if killer DCs. that is a problem :(
---
-I personally think Oni and Demo and Ghostface are probably around the same level. Plague is mid-tier to me, but I am not in red ranks, so that makes sense considering all you have to do is not cleanse and loop.
---
-And the bugs and glitches, there were too many I didn't know what to include, like the exit gate bug that unfairly cost the life of some survivors.
---
-I am on PC, Idk what is on console or xbox, and dedicated servers just feels worse here
---
-DC penalty is needed. I did mention that I was disappointed at the events. 
---
-Map design is alright to me besides Haddonfield. Which they nerf Balanced Landing and focused on Lery's Memorial instead.
---
As a blendette, that would be great. 
---
You know, since i cant loop for shit
---
At Red Rank, GF is high A, Demo is mid or high B, Oni is mid or high B. Demo is probably a little stronger, due to his more consistent map pressure. Plague is really bad against good survivors who know what they're doing. I'd say C tier.
---
I mean, off the top of my head, I can list multiple broken maps/loops. The central structure in Disturbed Ward, that one fucking window in Rancid Abattoir, Thompson House and Rotten Fields in their entirety, Badham in its entirety(multiple super strong loops and structures), etc . Give me a list of the maps, I can find a problem with 85% of them. A legit problem, too, not just bullshit.
---
Yeah this is kinda supposed to be a kind of role reversal with 4 small black women and 1 huge white man. looking back it's kinda farfetched
---
"my friend drew the Oni but he doesn't like it" 
---
Here we go again another one of those, trying to make us feel pity so some people will come and say "oh don't say that it's wonderful" 
---
Self pity to get upvotes. 
---
You know people like me don't care if he loves his drawing or not if it's trash it's trash no one can say otherwise. This drawing is good but gets a down vote just for the self pity. I don't care if I get downvoted I just hate with a burning passion people using pity to get likes.
---
Looks like a fun project to make.
---
Fun fact: If you want to know what the exact percentage is to unhook yourself is, binomial probability says it's 11.5364% with 3 attempts assuming the chances of success is 4%. With Slippery Meat and 6 attempts, it's 21.72422103%. The percentages increase with luck offerings and Up The Ante.
---
Yeah. I know. We all know that. I was in the chase with the killer for a while and he probably had Bloodlust 2/3. I knew I wasn’t getting another loop out of it. I think we can all agree that from *my* perspective I tried to drop the pallet early. It wasn’t some last second drop that results in getting hit 90% of the time. From *my* perspective I should’ve at least gotten a stun. I don’t know how else I’m supposed to “play around the reality of the game we currently have” if the game itself is lying to me about where I actually am.
---
When you finish creating something and notice your mistakes they add up quick. Taking stock of your work and bring critical also helps you get better. You can't correct mistakes if you don't acknowledge making them in the first place.
---
His right arm is smaller, the perspective is distorted (looking right, leaning in from the right, but shading suggests he's leading with his left side), etc. 
---
Still a great drawing but accepting the flaws leaves room for imorovement.
---
God is dead and you've replaced him
---
sbeve
---
Well, that's one way to concede, I guess.
---
*in a lobby waiting for people to join*
---
**_GROOVY_**
---
I see, thanks for letting me know, some maps really are a bit strong for the windows, but it isn't easy to keep a strong loop for survivors vs killers. 
---
So how is Ghostface better than Demo and Oni if they have mobility? Is it the Trut3lent sneak thing?
---
Was playing with my friend when we encountered his friend who was killer. The guy switched to survivor and was the biggest whining bitch ever.
---
He used the NAT to disconnect three times. I was like see ya you little bitch who can't play the game. Told my friend never wanted to play with that guy again. So toxic but he saw it as a tactic and disconnecting via NAT apparently no punishments if they do implement sanctions on disconnecters.
---
It fucks over the killer and it fucks over the survivors... it's shitty and should carry severe punishment whether it be depips, banning, removal of shards etc or exclusion from archives unless they pay for the privilege.... hurt the fuckers. 
---
Or just poop all the habitual disconnects together so they never get to have a proper game..
---
The question is should it be? 
---
6 ranks is close to a third of the whole ladder.
---
Apply this to any other ranked game you know (for me it's CS:GO, LoL) and you see how absolutely absurd that kind of matchmaking is
---
I just bought the game.a few days ago so i'm a rank 19 killer on PC and queue times can easily exceed 10 minutes
---
90% sure we can spit out numbers like they hold any data but DBD is a game that crashes for no reason tell those people to just suck it up or the ones that got fucked bc there are no dedicated servers close to them so their connection is fucked tell those people how fair that is
---
u would rather bring No Miter for infinite pick ups
---
Everyone knows the more points you have the better you did!
---
you get picked up while healing someone, similar to vaulting or working on a generator. I haven't tested the pointing one but its common sense that you can't pick up a survivor while they are emoting. Healing involves skill checks so it can be interrupted.
---
Okay that is indeed the truth
---
this is clearly photoshopped.
---
As a Claudette I do both fairly well but sometimes i do really fuck up, especially if i can't find a pallet or window
---
Being good at looping is great but you can't do it forever so being able to hide is a good advantage
---
Wholeheartedly agree ! I plan on console and I see people DC after just getting injured or down (which is frequently). And I mainly see challenges involving using a killer, so I can see exactly why it's frustrating. It's just as frustrating on both sides. I just hope that those individuals get reprimanded. It's straight toxic. We're all just trying to play and have fun.
---
I see that as an interesting concept, but I also feel as though it would take the fun out of the game. What good is getting the credit even though they disconnected? All you wanna do is finish your challenges, get that W or L, and keep it moving.
---
Rank means nothing just bc ur at rank 20 doesnt mean u cant have good perks and be p3 just as P3 means nothing in lvl of skill unless it is p3 legacy in which case be scared
---
Have you unlocked the DS teachable perk from Laurie or BT from Bill (BT is also in the shrine which may give you a head start!)
---
I hate that tile as killer. I love that tile as survivor.
---
What? You mean grabbing someone? You couldve never interrupt and grab someone from a healing action.
---
But with ds and unbreakable it makes a great combo
---
Again, I’m mean I don’t disagree with you. But there literally might as well be two pallets. If the killer doesn’t mess up, he gets a hit on you. It’s not based on your ability to loop.
---
like self unhook attempts? cos it is just 4% base
---
hehe touch it 
---
*hides the second glowy totem*
---
The problem is they need to give out heftier punishments for DCing. We shouldn't give players bonuses for someone DCing, we should stop people from DCing by putting them in longer queues, giving out less BP to those who DC or just ban them for a few days then permanently if they continue.
---
As an artist, this is so true. People tell me my stuff is good but when you’ve spent hours on a piece all you can see at the end is it’s flaws if it doesn’t look EXACTLY how it was in your head.
---
well usually my games take 5 to 7 min if it is rly good ones
---
Bruh all I did was ask a simple question and 5 people downvote for no good reason 😂
---
&gt; When camping this player and with everyone on zero hooks. Makes an environment in which survivors might play to save the hooked player, more so in SWF. This does not mean its guaranteed.
---
&gt; After this happens. this gives you the chance not to only get more blood points in different categories. But this also gives you a chance to catch another survivor and start a loop of them saving a hooked survivor, one getting down, they get hooked, camped, repeat.
---
i already mentioned that. As i said, it's based on survivor accepting to give you those points by trading. It's not a "strategy" it's you begging for help from survivors. It's not viable when you think about it in an optimal way of playing. 
---
All you're doing is trying to prove to yourself that you still ca, get one guy dead. Which does not serve any purpose regarding the game last pipping rules. What can you allow to at least get your black pip and maybe more, is to take the risk, at that point, to do as much chases as possible and maybe, get one more hook in the process, but mainly 3 or 4 more hit.
---
at least on red ranks ppl actually do gens through ruin sometimes.
---
If it makes you feel better if you keep playing killer once you hit the high ranks you'll get games instantly and can stress yourself out with tryharding survivors to your heart's content
---
Look on the bright side, ranks dont mean jack shit in dbd
---
Really? People can also get picked off while unhooking someone I’m like 80% sure you can interrupt a heal by picking the healer up. It’s just so incredibly rare because you’re looking for the killer while you are healing so you aren’t going to keep going while he is approaching you. If this isn’t the case and u do have proof, then  it could have been an old feature which was changed after 2016. I took a long break from the game so I don’t know this exact info

If you want to learn how to flashlight save though... Wait until the biceps are completely horizontal before turning on the light. If you do it too early, you can stop for a split second to adjust and continue again. I personally aim for the forehead since it will also give you better angles in case of obstruction like rubble or pallets.
---
Well yeah it would be better since it is just a buff. The problem with the buff is that with the add-on yous till only have 1 trap so the buff isn't really that impactful
---
Like I said, I decline them. My notifications are still full of request with nasty messages attached to them. Great advice though
---
Love this game but it needs some SERIOUS work in the next year.  
---
Only game I've played where there's no incentive to rank up because everything gets worse.
---
Finish 3 daylies as a challenge
---
I agree and only participate because I like the little eye charm things, looks super cool, though I try not to grind through games to complete the challenges as that ruins the fun.
---
I replied to another comment with the same thing, but when you’ve spent hours on a piece you see all it’s flaws when it doesn’t look like what was in your head. Other people don’t know what you were originally picturing, so they see it as perfect.
---
Lets make killers insidious basement camp that wont make survivors angry!
---
You could bring the Last Will add-on that gives you an extra trap, or bring the purple Sketch to add another box, or the Tampered Timer to reduce the death timer further. If you really want to make that one trap hurt, you can take another RBT related add-on, or the Video Tape to further strengthen your dash.

No one:

Not a single soul:

Not even god himself:

Literally fucking everyone: r/uselessnobody

 I mean...it’s a subreddit for leaks about the game. Unless the question is about something like data mining or exporting models and etc, people are gonna treat you like an idiot because the main sub is a better place to ask. As for Niito stealing posts, I’ve never seen that happen or heard anyone else complain about it so would you mind going into a little more detail? (I do agree that the owner watermarking stuff is kinda ridiculous)
---
Yeah and I agree that it sucks. You walked out for a fraction of a second to try and bait the stun then slammed down the pallet but to the killers client and therefore the server, you were still on the other side when he swung at you and therefore he got the hit because with Bloodlust he had the extra speed to land it on his side before the server found triangulate you being on the other side of a dropped pallet.
---
Trust me I know. Rank 1 survivor here every season. I hate playing around dedicated servers and dropping pallets that I could have gotten another loop out of on an actual peer to peer connection but at the end of the day, it's what we have to deal with. Drop the pallet early and go to the next loop after it's been kicked. Boring, yes, but also safe.
---
I guess that's what happens when you reach Prestige 4
---
Lery's isn't an unbalanced map but it's a difficult map. There's a difference, I would say.
---
I think this fits the theme of this game. I hope the devs do something like this. But what about killers?
---
Bags are great but outside of honing stone or ultra rares the tar bottle is the second best add on for trapper imo
---
That’s cause he’s a lot more viable cause he has insane map control
---
Internet such a good source for new words daily.
---
What even was the original pig nerf? I started playing this game after it happened.
---
Even then it’s not complete proof, newer players do that stuff all the time so it wouldn’t be bannable
---
Those aren't advantages you ignore. Oni has much more mobility, one use of his Dash can get you to a lot more places than one use of the Chainsaw Sprint. While limited, it also hits multiple survivors. Not to mention his actual Demon attack has a huge lunge range. He also has built-in tracking with blood orbs whether or not without his UR add-on. He forces survivors to heal unless they want to always give him his power.
---
Yo dude dont do jack shit for anyone play how you want. You're the killer. Youre job is to kill all 4 survivors.  Jf you wanna camp, do it.  If you wanna do patrols, do it.  I know I'm not leaving the area of I hear or see someone near a survivor I just hooked. There arent rules for you to play by.  
---
I wish people could get this in their head and sto complaining about how killers play. Play how you want to.
---
Ye just keep the +’s
---
Downvoted for the truth.
---
Unless they're all running matching names or all use OoO there's no way to really tell if they're in a SWF.
---
Most reddit don't like emoji, i guess it can be the reason.
---
I dunno, this one felt to me like the easiest one to complete, I just grabbed a toolbox and prove thyself w/ my normal build and had altruistic teammates the whole game XDD
---
I’d be happy to help. My PSN is DegeneratePleb and I’m currently rank 2 for survivor. If you don’t mind a red rank then just send me a friend request :)
---
I'm pretty sure that Huntress sometimes swears something in russian when stunned, but sadly I have no recollection of where I've read it. Nor the language knowledge to check it myself after getting stunned 10 times.
---
Still much better than what it is now. Rule Set No.2 being base kit could make room for a new unique ultra rare that meshes well with this buffed version of Amanda’s Letter. Who knows. I think she just needs a small tweak to her base kit stealth/dash and a go-over of all her add-ons and she’d be golden.
---
Nah TBH this be looking like Claudette clearly 😒😒😒😒
---
Now this...this is purfuct
---
Pretty much. GF has the best stealth in the game. He moves at full speed with no caveats like Wraith (uncloak) or Pig(slow), and he has far less visibility than Myers. His stalking mechanic is also stronger in general. GF's ability is also very helpful mid chase to confuse survivors. Playing him aggro with no stalking is quite strong, and I would say he is stronger than Billy if played well.
---
Yikes sweaty, you must be fun at parties!
---
I've seen a killer slug someone, let him crawl right next to the exit, then pick him up and drop him far enough away that he couldn't get out before the timer ended
---
Gg that is amazing you should be proud of yourself
---
They are called challenges for a reason. You'll get more done by getting better at killer and earning it rather than complaining on Reddit. You'll get that feeling of satisfaction of accomplishing a difficult task as well.
---
The thing I like about these challenges is that it's forcing people to come out of their comfort zone and actually play the other side of they want to finish the archives, and that in itself is completely optional. And it's refreshing to break away from the norm every now again to do these challenges. And, yes, I understand that some challenges force you to play less optimal, or screw your team over, or be straight up counter productive to the main objective. But overall, it's been a meet positive experience for me.
---
Yeah, I had to play multiple games of insidious bubba to get the challenge done. I really hate to play that way, but I really had no choice.
---
I'd believe that if I didn't get people chewing me out for being P3 Freddy with all maxed perks even though I'm a rank 16 killer who went against 3 red ranks and 1 purple rank.
---
YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE
---
You're part of the problem.
---
I'm all for it as long as they get good... voice... actors... this... time.
---
Seriously though, if the character I'm playing as talks it's much easier to get attached to them. We don't need like, RDR2 or RDR level character dialogue; but if Susie hummed to herself a bit while searching for Survivors, if Doctor yelled "I WILL BREAK THEIR IMPURE BODIES!" when multiple people enter Madness, or if Freddy made some jokes, I don't see how that would be bad for DBD.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
This would get exploited to all hell. Swfs would just designate a sacrificial lamb every match at the right moment.
---
There is no reason to hate on the other side.
---
I prefer playing killer too, but I play like 1/4 games on survivor give or take.
---
What gets me mad is badly designed maps, tome challenges and especially fact that matchmaking sucks absolute ass.
---
There is nothing toxic about looping me for 5 minutes, but what is toxic and ENTIRELY down to the devs is the fact that I should not have been matched with someone that skilled when I'm on the verge of green/purple as killer and they have between 4x and 10x the amount of hours I have and a rank that CLEARLY identifies them as a way better player as me (for comparison I am at survivor rank 13 right now and I don't even have the rank 10 achievement, so this person in red ranks is infinitely better then me as survivor and clearly better than me as killer too since I can barely keep my purple rabk by playing my strongest killers/builds)
---
Sadly this is true. Yesterday the killer wanted us to farm and I asked my friend, "where is the dwight?" as we farming hook saves and he tells me, "I saw him go in the locker" and no lie, I went and checked the locker and he was fucking in there. lmao.
---
More like if you start searching at 12 AM today.
---
Yeah, you should be able to select one killer one and one survivor one. Always a pain to swap sides and forget to change your challenge accordingly.
---
Put up BPS tell them to farm, and then once they are maxed on everything come to the basement. Spent 11 games playing 'normally'  getting 2 or 3 basement sacrifices, changed to this tactic and 3 games later I had the challenge completed. Not toxic at all.
---
Survivors feel compelled to save other survivors.
---
1) It’s part of the game and something other than holding M1
---
2) Its empathy for the person on the hook who is unable to play
---
3) You need to for points. Unhooks are worth a lot of points. Leaving someone on the hook actually gives you a hefty penalty for not saving.
---
So yeah survivors are going to try and save no matter what. Also for some once they travel across the map to get there, they feel “fuck it I’ve come all this way” at least that’s my theory.  There are some situations like basement leatherface where I’d just run back and do gens at that point.
---
Although I had one game the other day. Had all gens done and doors powered. Tried to a last min save vs a basement leatherface. All of us swarming about. No swf so no voice comms.
---
I had 2 choices
---
1) walk out the door and game was over.
---
2) Try to pull off an epic endgame rescue vs the final boss of camping
---
Needless to say it didn’t go so well due to no co-ordination but it was fun to try.
---
The killer got salty post game. Not sure why. He got 3 kills as opposed to 1 if we all just left. Sometimes its more fun to try?
---
I detest camping as it makes the games boring but the epic endgame rescues are always the most fun parts of the game. I think they should remove the camping penalty AFTER the gens are done as why else would the killer leave? And they should remove the farm penalty for survivors, because as it stands now if you dont have borrowed time you cant unhook because if the killer lands a hit on the survivor because they run away when you try to tank the hit then you get a MASSIVE penalty for a safe unhook. The game tells you its better to just leave them on the hook to die than try to rescue them which I think goes against horror movie tropes where everyone tries to rescue each other no matter what the cost
---
I'm was saddened by the delay but was happy to see they wanted to put more time into it, and I love how you'll be able to have up to 8 friends houses in your island at a time.
---
Thanks to the Blank Splinter, it gave me a tutorial on how to play Michael Myers. Using Splinter Offerings allow you to play as licensed killers if you want them or not
---
Because it's funny to see slaty survivors
---
/u/repostsleuthbot
---
Oh screw the other side, there are some survivor challenges in tome II I yet have to do.
---
I do play killer and I ak at rank 8-10 atm facing exclusively higher ranked opposition and changing my playstyle just results in me getting wrecked
---
Nice repost
---
Of course it is.  Just continue playing well
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far...
---
survivor yes, killer no
---
This is brilliant. You had me laughing for the entire video lol
---
It's toxic if you try to live, apparently. Not even a survivor main, but holy shit lmao if I'm allowed to tunnel, they're allowed to bring DS to prevent it. If I pick them up so soon afterwards, that's on me.
---
As a killer main. Well former. Now I play 50/50. But camping in general is shit for both sides. For survivor side it can fuck over the other survivors who want to go for save and it just completely ruins the game for the bloke being camped (this applies to tunnels straight off hook. If you stab someone before they even get a chance to run away, fuck you) and if you're a killer camping is not only boring but a waste of time. Ever since the kindred buff more and more survivors are running it which tells them if you're camping, they see a camping killer they're gonna do gens and get out and you'll be left with 1k
---
Moral of the story: don't be a cunt, don't camp and tunnel. Not only does it make you look like ass wipe you ruin the game for someone who just wants to play
---
I stopped running NOED and all other hex perks mainly Noed
---
Bro, I know exactly the issue...
---
The Nurse...
---
Has a better gaming chair!
---
Wow you didn’t cleanse all the dull totems while the killer was chasing you? This was clearly deserved on your part. Just do bones next time 4Head
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA. Camping huntress??? That's new, nothing other then beast of prey will silence the humming I'm pretty sure. People hear that humming and slow increase of heart beat, they're gonna fuck right off instantly
---
B o n e s
---
This is the way
---
noice
---
Bro I will eat your friend tell him to shut up and show this to him personally
---
It's nice to see that sarcasm isn't your strong point as well...  
---
\- It's cute thought hat you wanna hop back in after 9 days with no recollection about what the topic you yourself made was about and then fail the comeback so amazingly that I almost fell out of my chair laughing!
---
It's Thrill of The Hunt, don't bother
---
Yep.
---
holy shit
---
This hits hard as I'm rank 4 survivor and have been waiting for a lobby for 35 mins so far...
---
3 disconnects into a hatch escape into killer depip is one of the dumbest things this game has to offer.
---
Fall asleep for just a second and you might wake up with a reverse bear trap on your face.
---
*I wanna play a game, bitch*
---
I'm a creative type and I just don't get this. Sure, my work is in audio, but when I listen back to an edit I've spent hours on, I don't think "well that sucked". Yeah, I recognize flaws. I pick up on mistakes I made while editing. I'm critical of the way I run my sessions and what it means for the finished product. But beyond fishing for compliments, I don't tell people it sucks, because I just don't believe that.
---
several years into this game, I still don't understand why we can't just *KICK THE DAMN THING OVER.*
---
The guy in the title or in the picture?
---
Why feed into the karma whoring?
---
Hey! They can‘t see us if we don‘t move
---
Myers is definetely a solid killer choice, loved that clip.
---
Glad you enjoyed him :)
---
Adding to my previous comment, most of these challenges aren't in fact challenging, but rather extremely situational. Here are two examples:
---
- it took me 7 or 8 games to get the "kick the same gen 4 times" challenge. Because it is hard? No, because you need survivors that keep restarting a gen they are no able to finish and me running back to it.
---
Skill level needed: level 20 killer
---
- i got the "complete 3 gens with Dark Sense" (haven't try the one with 4, it seems absurdly situational as solo survivor) on the very first try. Because I was moving around the map with keen awareness? Hardly, it was my team that were colossal idiots and I just 100% the 3 only gens that got done the entire game.
---
So I do agree with you that som challenges are actually fun and challenging (like the catch people in traps, I had a lot of fun playing trapper, a killer I ignored completely up to that point), but so many of them are absurdly situational, so getting them does not feel like you played to the best of your abilities to get them, but rather that a set of random events finally put me into a position to do them
---
Okay, but the changes in player names alone would be worth it
---
Bro that's the new Wraith buff.
---
Adam has great skins for blending as well :P
---
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
---
And if they weren't so busy porting to Switch and Mobile, a good portion of those teams could be working on improving the core game experience.
---
Is unbreakable too op?
---
you’ll.. eat him?
---
I must massage the air above it till it explodes
---
Here’s your first problem Claudettes don’t do gens.
---
In a good way don’t worry
---
Could honestly just be a challenge
---
Fake Teleport comes in handy for gens where they can't have clear lines of sight on you, but yeah, it's often better to just complete the teleport on a worked gen and smake it with PGTW
---
My friend draws fancy Christmas cards every year. This year she asked what I wanted, I was on the spot so I blurted out "I don't know Dead by Daylight."
---
1. Finding a game can take some time sometimes, but it should be quicker when you rank up a little bit more (I have &lt;10 second queues as red rank killer on PC)
---
2. I’d say, for a new player, play Hilbilly. He’s one of the best killers in the game and easy to play for a new player. He’s easy to learn but a little difficult to master (Faking chainsaws to force a pallet drop, curving etc is for more advanced players). His chainsaw allows you to sprint across the map at 230% speed (Normally you run at 115%) and it instadowns survivors when it hits. Just make sure you don’t use your chainsaw in a chase if there’s a pallet or window nearby, they’ll use those before you charge your chainsaw fully.
---
This made me commit a haha
---
People get so heated when killers PLAY THE GAME LIKE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO AND KILL THEM 💀
---
How about Sympathies. Like things they admire and don’t want to kill for.
---
Is that a made with memeatic crop out? 🤔
---
Thanks for the tips man, funny to see someone else from FH here. Looking forward to learning this game. Seems like the reward for grinding is good mm Qs lol
---
y e s
---
&gt; Leading me to believe that the devs don't think he needs buffs.
---
The devs have said that they do NOT want him buffed. They just want to change him.
---
He may benefit from this rework, but that's not their goal with it.
---
Just played 6 games in a row at rank one without ever letting more then 3 gens get repaired vs full teams of red rank survivors..... gens are not secondary objectives they the the only thing that mater. Learn to hit and run back to gens. Keep them injured and healing so they don't have a change to work on gens. Control the game and catch them out away from pallets. Remember if you loop you lose.
---
I think it would be better for a husk to stay for a survivor that dcs and the survivors should get more xp so they don't depip. Also if someone DCs while the match is loading everyone should get something for their time being wasted.
---

Ruin will spawn directly in front of a survivor when I’m killer , but when I’m playing survivor it’s like trying to find Waldo...on the moon...in another reality....with no light...or sound.
---
Exactly. Sometimes we just can’t be bothered with the toxicity because of how much fun it takes out of the game.
---
It’s Otz, he’s a very famous streamer who mostly plays killer. He’s known for mind games and amazing builds on killers
---
*Baby Feng opening Exir Gate injured thinking she's safe
---
All due respect, I never said it wasn't working as intended. I just suggested it could use a tweak here and there for those who don't have the time to complete it. Nothing crazy. Just a little less XP or one extra fragment per level up. A double fragment event could be fun!
---
Yes, it is good you can get the Auric Cells back that you paid for initially. The problem is I haven't had the time to actually claim them all back by completing the pass. It's only 100 cells but say I do that 5 more times. That's 500 cells I missed out on, my dude.
---
I did not respond instantly because I have a life unlike you it seems, and the topic is me being hit through a window I was clearly past if you don't like my video then don't watch it I'm not forcing you or anyone too. The point of this video was to laugh about it but you somehow take it as me being a toxic survivor main and decided that you want to write a comment about it. Again I can see you act like a child. If you can't laugh at a video why even watch it if you want to think everyone is a toxic survivor lmao. Anyway have fun with what ever you want to post a negative comment next. Get a sense of humor and we can talk and laugh about this in the future or don't cause no matter what you are just some random person on the internet that I do not care about in the slightest and the only reason I continue to comment is because it's funny to read. PS, GG
---
I play the killer like a total noob, but I dunno the first person viewpoint of hitting is a total pain in the ass when you play with survivors that wanna meme a little bit because even with FOV increase perks, I'll still lose sight of them if they're right in my face so I back up a bit and with the Doctor, give 'em some shock therapy for the screaming animation so I can either back up or close in and take a hefty swing.
---
Doctor is easiest for me to use, especially with some of the perk sets I have set up but I'm like in no way an expert, I'm just trying to have a good time.
---
The fact they don't want to buff him is the problem. Nerfing spirit without buffing her made sense. She was too strong and rely unfun to play against.
---
Doctor, however, is one of the worst killers in the game. Why the hell do a rework if your not going to buff them AND try to make them more fun to play against at the same time.
---
The more I read about it, the more I'm starting to realize that this is the most pointless rework they have ever done. I would like to be wrong, but I don't feel like I will be.
---
That wouldn’t necessarily make sense and isn’t how all network code works.
---
Why do you shake your head your head?
---
I fucking love how demo is on top of the tree
---
WaLl HaX u ShItTy KiLlEr
---
One of the best I've seen so far
---
He was moonwalking nothing
---
Congratulations! You're part of the problem!
---
Who would you recommend to watch if someone is new to the game and looking to learn it? Both for the killer and survivor sides.
---
Wouldn’t really call sole survivor a counter to BBQ since it only helps if two people are already dead and you’re between the small space of 40-48 meters away from the hook
---
But what if you are actually bad, like myself?
---
Aww thx
---
The other survivors looked pretty fucked, a save didn't seem likely. Her best bet was to make distance and hope for hatch, I'd say.
---
Erm
---
As a PS4 player myself, I can agree. Totally sucks.
---
I swear I just had an argument in this sub a few weeks ago over whether or not dedicated servers had been introduced yet.
---
Also, this seems to be an issue with the network allowing the out of sync “client” to catch up instead of forcing it to fall behind. In this case it would mean the killer was seeing that they were on you the whole time but wasn’t send their location quick enough to you. DBD should have thrown the killer backwards in time when it resynced not caught it up to present time, which is why you were hit.
---
Its fine ik some people if not most dont like it
---
Such a stupid fucking perk lol
---
Amazing work
---
I draw myself and not even as good as this yet when im done with a drawing I always start seeing that it's not as good as I wanted it to, how it looked in my head etc etc.
---
And yet every match people are DCing with no way to regain those emblem points. Its screwed up.
---
I kinda would love that as a sticker to put on my
---
Computer
---
I guess I don't understand how to really level up as the survivor.  I am fairly good at this game, I help others, do generators and totems.  I don't just hide in the locker until the match is over and I play the game as fairly as possible.  I am a level 16 yellow and it's like I just cannot get past it.  
---
I do seem to get tunneled A LOT and yes I have teammates that don't help me when I get hung.  Any tips?
---
or from spanish "detestable" that means hateable.
---
You're right, this is definitely one of the easiest challenges
---
Just blood points for the killer, and counting it as hook states for emblems is enough. They certainly can't have it buff the killer. If someone DCs, they killer basically wins for free anyways. Unless someone does it on thier last hook. Buffing survivors would just make it so killers wouldn't waste time doing it, or would wait till there is just 1 or 2 survivors left, then they would do it.
---
Over here if you play in the night you get a match in a few seconds, but get paired with the hardcore gamers that end gens in 5 minutes.
---
That's lit!
---
Dead easy
---
Its so bad it needs a double shake.
---
Haha thx
---
“My friend drew the Oni and knows it’s fantastic but wants to act like he hates it for upvotes.”
---
Ah another DBD Mobile player I see.
---
The Virgin Toned David and the Chat Beer-Bellied Jeff
---
I mean, if the semi-global shock ability that they want to give him had a short cooldown then it'd be really bad to play against if the Doc is doing a 3 gen strat, which they all usually do.
---
This one could have more to do with the recent lagging than it does Freddy. Although from the looks of it, it could be both combined.
---
This is the way.
---
Thats rust tbh
---
I really don’t think farming is a bannable offence. People keep saying that it is but why? It’s not preventing anyone from playing the game or having fun. It’s just that someone wants to speed up the tedious fringing process. I have more than 200 hours in DbD and I’m still nowhere near having half of the teachables for the survivors let alone any killer teachables. 
---
If you don’t want to farm then just don’t. You can do gens and leave. Nobody is really going to stop you.
---
&gt;still find Doctor annoying to play against.
---
Constant noise and visual static + more complicated skillchecks and Doctors usually doing 3 gen strats with unnerving distressing and overcharge. It's not about being hard to play vs, it's just boring.
---
When I learned about BBQ, I jumped into lockers as soon as someone was picked up. But I always forget about it with rank reset
---
I agree. It’s helped me loop a lot better. And yeah, I only do ‘nice’ things when people dc or kill themselves first hook because having only three survivors on your team is hard. 
---
Except, I notice a lot of my peeps dc first hook. Not sure if they just don’t enjoy playing against Ghostface since I sneak up on them a lot. 
---
Even if I do, once I’m in a chase, I lose them so easily because I suck at reading scratch marks lol so if they’d stick it out, they’d see I’m total trash. Either way, I just wanna have fun playing !
---
Ah. Dont watch streamers so I didnt know. Does he play survivor?
---
Oh wow. I didn’t even think to do this with my family. Bring OoO and tell them where the killer is at all times. Hum...
---
Press Activity Button to become Exhausted for 60/50/40 seconds
---
Thank you bc I was thinking of going no perks with killer but was worried I’d just get merked and deranked
---
No it could be any hex perk you may not want to deal with spirit one hitting you, watch out.
---
Honestly, if I was on PC I’m sure I’d already have a lot of memes floating around because I hit the air like 9/10 times. I also accidentally move my camera up when I strike, so I literally hit the sky. Oops. 
---
But yeah, first person is hard. If they 180 or 360 me, they basically lost me
---
Ran into a full team of shirtless davids with no-mither, the other day. It was a pretty short match.
---
This doesn't make clown more effective, just gives more options.
---
Def. killer sided, there are hardly any pallets and it's hard to find totems and even generators on it.
---
If you aren't playing sneaky as survivor you're at a significant disadvantage as you don't have that much stuff to use if you don't get really good rng.
---
Yeah bc with survivor I been feeling bad lately that the killer is a baby still like they really need to fix the ranking matchmaking
---
&gt;anything slower
---
I mean if you choose to bloodlust the loop instead of blinking as Nurse, then yes.
---
Yeah baby, a lot of moris lately, i guess soloq eats the anger caused by swf
---
Yes. This happens to my GF all the time when she solo’s. It does happen when just her and I play but it’s impossible for them to know it’s her and I. We don’t notice a difference when solo or together. Rank 17s always brining Mori’s with Tier 3 Ruin, BBQ, Phobia, NOED
---
I honestly dont get how people play this game and just hide for literally the eintire game. Go play something else if thats literally all your going to do
---
I am shaking with extreme fear of death
---
Semi-global seems a but disingenuous co soldering it's only tied to his heartbeat. Not saying you're wrong, but this supports my point of how this "rework" is looking to be incredibly dull. No real thought of making the killer good or fun to play. Just less annoying and very mildly at that.
---
Even in that case a 45 second cooldown would still be better than 60.
---
Those stats were not released at the same time and were several patches apart. The survivor escape rate stats were months earlier and between the two stat released were a few critical balance patches.
---
Now I want to do this but playing as Santa Clown
---
Nothing bothers more than DC's either as a survivor or killer. I returned recently to the game after a long time and I find it amazing that people can ruin games left and right without repercussions. 
---
People complain about people being annoying using game mechanics but the DC's are the real plague of the game and the newer or returning players. 
---
I sometimes catch myself thinking what is the fucking point of trying to play killer or the game with somany people that DC.
---
Do you spam z with your pinky?
---
Exactly the response I was looking for! Cheers!
---
I'd recommend three things here:
---
First, find streamers that aren't exceptional at the game but have mote experience than you. They'll be a bit easier to follow along with.
---
Second, check out youtube for educational content. Looping tutorials, map tutorials, etc will all be there. You can find specific info very quickly on youtube vs on a streaming service.
---
Third, educational streamers are probably the best to watch of the more popular ones. They're still going to go a bit fast for a newer player, but they tend to explain things as they go. For killer, Otzdarva and Fungoose are good ones to watch. Fungoose also plays survivor. Both have great content on youtube as well.
---
Hey man, 1.5k is 1.5k.
---
You drew this and you know it’s good.
---
Congrats on tricking a forum full of genuine idiots, though
---
I always run deerstalker alot
---
Oh no, I created a monster 😄
---
But seriously though, expect to be tunneled a lot with Object
---
I’ve barely seen him play survivor. He’s currently trying to master every single killer a think
---
I am a survivor main and I was repairing a generator the other day and I kept hearing all these birds so I looked and saw 3 birds on top of a locker.  So I opened it and sure enough a Dwight was standing in there and had been the whole game.  I was like okkkk thanks for all your help.
---
or when they crouch in front of you and get in your way so you can't run and then drop a pallet on you so you for sure get hit and not them.
---
It is when the game has been borderline unplayable on PS4 for over six months.
---
Yeah exactly, that’s why I can’t be bothered to do it
---
Jesus Freddy has some go go gadget arms to hit that lunge around a corner on u too
---
Skill check doctors are gimmick builds that barely work and survivors have decent control over whether or not the gens are close together. Yes there are shit maps for Survs against doc like the game, but doc needs survivor mistakes, a whole lot of luck, and a good map to do anything. 
---
3 gens can be boring as hell, but Survs have a say on how the gens get done. I'm not arguing he's fine in his current state. It's just this rework isn't going to make him less annoying and it is being done with the wrong mindset.
---
It's hard to even be excited about not switching modes cause dedicated servers cause so much latency on the shock.
---
Honestly, being tunneled wouldn’t be a change for us. Almost every killer tunneled us last night. But perhaps it’ll be even worse if we get Object. I’m not even sure any of us have it.
---
We aren’t really that good at the game so I don’t feel like we bully the killers. Yet.
---
&gt;Semi-global seems a but disingenuous
---
As long as it covers the area of the 3 gens it might as well be global.
---
&gt;this "rework" is looking to be incredibly dull
---
I'd say we wait till we get some actual details, so far we only got a rough outline.
---
You know what could be better? This scene with tombstone. Happened to me and it was so good to see the fear in their eyes while im moriing their friend right at the doors.
---
Still pip’ed. Worth.
---
He's being sarcastic.
---
I'll just get rid of the object, after that I play normally.
---
The usual situation is one very skilled looper babysitting his lower rank friends with OoO. After he's gone, the others are usually pretty lost and easy to get
---
That bug really needs to get fixed. It straight up ruins games and you can't do anything about it like some of the other game breaking bugs.
---
Even if you think that the comment is fake it still deserves an upvote for the amazing drawing
---
Yeaaaa that’s pretty shit logic, tydetyme is one of the greats (Tyde, true and not otzdarva) so if tydetyme says something is good it’s good, youre just jealous that tyde is better than you.
---
Go to the “store” (the box with claws coming out) and then look for a tab to go to shrine of secrets. You should be able to buy BT with some shards I believe
---
fun game!!!
---
I’ll probably start worrying about that after I convince them to stop unhooking me in front of the killer. 
---
My cousins are pretty good at looping and 360’ing (still) but they are teenagers and get over confident and cocky. So they all try to rush the killer and unhook me at once. You can guess what happens after that.
---
The karma whoring made me downvote it. Idc how good it is, if they’re a karma whore than they get a downvote
---
Hide If you can, run If you must
---
No it doesn’t
---
We got a bit more than an outline. We got the details of how his base power is going to be changed and the devs themselves said they just  wanna make him less annoying and not actually good. The only positive is no modes. Which, if it's anything like it is now, is gonna get screwed by the latency anyways.
---
There is very little to be excited for here.
---
Like I've said several times in this thread. I hope to be wrong and I hope they pull out some last second crazy power change but I'm not holding my breath.
---
Maybe you should do gens instead of run around???
---
Just tell them to bring Borrowed Time then
---
Oh hey.  You're still talking?  Nice comeback.
---
I was about to leave a generator with my chainsaw when I suddenly got stuck in some bushes for half a second. I turned towards the bushes and a p3 claudette appeared from them and tried to run away while I freaked out and almost miss the chainsaw
---
This guys are like spider coming out of nowhere I swear
---
Lower ranks have more of the lower rank problems such as tunneling and camping.
---
I'd advice you to think what you are saying. You are low rank, you don't really know how ranks work, you feel you are good in the game, you feel like you are running against bad killers and your team mates are bad.
---
If you are low rank, it means that you don't play much or you don't play well. This goes against you claiming to be good.
---
If you feel like you are playing against tunnelers all the time, you should have easy time doing generators and gaining ranks when the killer spends the game chasing someone else.
---
If you really want to rank up, you have to either play the game to rank up or play a lot. I'm rank 1 and also quite garbage in the game, but I get to be rank 1 because I play a lot. If you want to play the game to rank up, you have to make choices that help you rank up. Analyze the killer, analyze your teammates and make better choices for yourself.
---
yeah lol some of these killers have 2m arms.
---
Why answer me two times?
---
they will put in much better skins next time, just like all the free 2 play games do, first pass has shit rewards, the next one ups it.
---
It was the same for me as killer on PC, and on the Switch it was even worse. But on both platforms, once you crest past rank 17 or so, queues get MUCH better. It seems there's lots of people new to killer, or just wanting to try it out: But not many make it very far.
---
Keep on your quest friend. Do some dishes while you wait or something, or watch YouTube if nothing else. I promise it gets a ton better
---
I mean he was probably afk but i mean i would spectate people or while im om the hook i can see peoples auras and fucking claudettes just stand there not doing anything...its always fucking claudettes too which sucks cause shes my main and i promise you i never do that shit
---
is there any way to dodge the entity in the bloodweb? how do you increase prestige? I reached level 50 and i thought it would just increase each time i completed the bloodweb after that but apparently thats not how it works
---
My WiFi is shit. That’s why
---
Because my wifi is shit
---
Fair enough
---
Unless you want to be mean enough to even bother.
---
It might be haunted grounds or devour hope, make sure to go back there if things get messy
---
Yes, we can consider she got nerfed again.
---
\*Patch 3.4.0: Deep Wound timer no longer went down when Sprinting or while Mending. Deep Wound was no longer connected with the Killers terror radius.
---
This wasn't just a nerf to Legion, this also meant that Pig (and Ghostface, and Wraith) could no longer bypass the endurance effect by continuing the chase while crouched, which was a strategy that lots of Pig mains used. Again, Legion got something in return, she didn't.
---
I usually fake like I’m going to spin one way and then quick spin the other way. You can practice in the tutorial if you need to. It just takes muscle memory
---
Lol...
---
If it glows..
---
If they blind you when you vault, break a pallet or get pallet stunned that makes you a toxic asshole
---
make Claudette a red-bone :)
---
Look up some strategies to get pips. It’s actually a little more formulaic than you think, and at least should help get you out of yellow if you can pull it off.
---
Some general ideas: Try and do a generator, get an unhook, a totem and a chase in a game and you should at least get your safety and not -1.
---
&gt; Ppl keep complaining about blendettes but have you ever went up against a Tapp with that forest green detectives coat?
---
I don't think Tapp has a skin like that?
---
When I killer finds you and chased you, you can't just do gens. That's the fastest way to get grabbed.
---
I remember it from playing Halo. I just don’t remember people losing their shit over it.
---
If you want a more friendly reason I can think of 2
---
A: the entity puts a sort of protective force field around the totem and the hand movement and grunting help dispell the force field causing it to fall apart
---
B: same reason the survivors can't just straight up punch the shit out of legion: their minds cannot phantom performing such actions (it was worded more elegantly when I read/heard that part, but i have no idea if they mentioned it in a dev stream or if it was just a random lore tidbit about why the survivors dont fight back)
---
Wait, I'm stupid it's a Adam skin, I'm always getting him and tapp mixed up because I be never seen the saw films.
---
Will fix
---
Friend: *Draws amazing Oni picture
---
Me: *Draws a bad stick figure with a stick
---
Friend: "You draw so welllll!"
---
Me: "B, please. Get'cho ass an Oscar already and stop lyin'."
---
To your question "how do they balance new players vs returning, fully kitted players?"
---
They don't.
---
I am willing to bet their new player retention is abyssmal.
---
I got a lot of friends to try the game, none stuck with it. Might me a small n for a sample, but I don't imagine they do much better as a whole
---
Bring empathy if you havent been itnwill let you know if someone is being chased so you can run to them and prepare the save
---
\*laughs in huntress*
---
What's this, an indoor map? have fun being an m1 killer with 110% speed and a lullaby at 40 meters so you can't ever find anyone.
---
There are four people with 3 attempts each. There is a decent chance one of them will unhook themselves.
---
Prestige is for skins (their default skins get bloody) but you have to start your bloodweb over. If you ever see someone covered in a bloody mess, that’s why. You can prestige up to P3 and you get one piece per prestige.
---
If you don’t prestige, you can still do bloodwebs normally (you just don’t go over level 50)
---
There are some tips for securing branches away from the entity on this thread (sorry can’t find this second).
---
its [canon](https://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/freddy2.jpg)
---
Because Halo was a fairly balanced game and teabagging was not adding insult to injury, but rather a taunt after playing well
---
Exactly what I thought of lol
---
Fair enough. I don’t do it because i see the reaction people have. It just seems like if people didn’t get so upset over it, all it’s power would be lost. But many things in life work that way.
---
I found the most effective way to set myself up for these challenges was just go full slug build. Knock out, Sloppy Butcher, Deerstalker or Nurse's calling and of course Agitation. Can be used on most killers to good effect.
---
It's still vulnerable to people D/Cing but if you just ignore trying to win the actual game and go for the challenge you'll find a surprisingly amount of success.
---
I mean, this guy could have just faced rank 1 toxic survivors gen rushing and teabagging and bullying him.
---
It gloweth it goeth.
---
I'd probably go way overboard with the single trap. Tremendously reduces bear trap death timer, reverse bear trap activates immediately instead of on next generator completion, tremendously increases time it takes to put reverse bear trap on survivor.
---
Had a game last night where I did basically everything. 3.5 gens by myself, saved everyone off hook (I had kindred and saw teammates crouched off in the corner of the map). Even cleansed some totems too. 
---
Didn’t do enough totems obviously because when I completed the last gen the killer NOED’d me and put me on my first hook. Teammates noped out immediately and I died. 
---
Had more points dead than anyone else that escaped and almost beat the killer. 
---
Solo queue is definitely...”fun”. For some definitions of fun.
---
And a Baywatch swimsuit for Kate.
---
There will always be a taunt that gets to people.
---
I don't mind the teabagging, but flashlight clicking makes me furious
---
*Comment about how perk is better than you think*
---
Jokes aside I agree with on everything except for I'm All Ears. I find it to incredibly useful for mindgames and on Nurse especially. It's also got only a 40 second cool down which isn't too bad.
---
its soldier tf2
---
Me too! I can’t wait to play co-op. It’s gonna be awesome 😄
---
I am definitely thinking about what I am saying - but I just feel like asking people is easier because I have looked it up before but it doesn't make much sense.
---
Like I said my issue is I FEEL like I AM playing well.  I play all the time - I help people off hooks, I help heal others but then if someone is camping against that person on the hook is about the only time I don't help as much as I normally do.
---
When I said I play against tunnelers all the time I mean I am the one being tunneled. Which sucks because it makes the game 0 fun for me.  I get hooked and have no chance after that and that sucks IMO as a survivor main. I'd say 98% of the time - whether I use the start as far away from the killer perk or not - I am the FIRST one found it seems like.
---
I play the game every single day - literally - and I do make choices to help myself if I know that I can or cannot help my teammates.  but just like now I'm playing - I got saved and they came right back to get me.  It's like that's just how it goes for some reason.
---
"I know perks. I have the best perks."
---
Great drawing, horrible attention seeking.
---
10/10 would look at the drawing again.
---
I used to do this all the time with Hag. If I see a brightly colored character with a flashlight I play Hag with Franklin's and trap the dropped item. They ALWAYS go back for their item.
---
Wouldn't mind Dead Hard. I don't play survivor enough to want to level David King but that perk would be helpful.
---
Me too. Regular Huntress mask looks too plain now.
---
I don't have Knock out yet, but I like the idea
---
Yeah that's what I have noticed is it's very formulaic and I guess I need to research it to figure out what I am doing wrong when I feel like I am doing things right LOL.  Thanks!
---
Looks flawless my friend
---
It’s way more than 5 or 10 seconds. Lemme find something.
---
If you are the only one being tunneled in all your games you must have some wildly inappropriate name. Nothing else would make sense.
---
Lol it’s not hard to pip as Solo Queue Survivor. I would mostly recommend Spine Chill and Kindred.
---
Spine Chill to f**k over every stealth killer and remove the last bit of horror from this game and Kindred cause its great. 
---
You just need to fill out all the checkmarks like, Gens, At least 2 Safe Hook Rescues, A considerable (or tremendously) long chase or multiple moderately Long Chases and the Unbroken Emblem really isn’t that important.
---
The only perk I want to appear in the damn shrine is Inner Strength. I run Dead Hard, Head On and Quick &amp; Quiet, but Inner Strength would perfectly complete my build, especially since I always do bones in fear of NOED and for points. My friend P3‘d Nancy and everytime he uses Inner Strength I‘m dying a little inside.
---
Couldn't agree more!
---
Yes. For Rank 1 all you have to do is get a safety pip. There's no pressure to rank up anymore all you have to do is do decent. For survivor this is pretty easy. For killers a bit more difficult. 
---
For survivor I can consistently maintain Rank 1 with my build of: Autodidact, WGLF, Borrowed Time, and DS. 
---
For killer it is definitely more difficult as you have a lot more pressure on your shoulders. But I maintain Rank 1 with my main Leatherface with my build: Shadowborn, Ruin, Agitation, and BBQ &amp; Chili. A weird build for sure but decent enough to safety pip more often than not.
---
AFAIK this is the whole list of Pig changes.
---
\*Patch 2.5.0
---
*Nerf: Increased Terror Radius from 28 meters to 32 meters.*
---
*Buff: Decreased the base crouch and uncrouch duration from 2 seconds to 1.3 seconds and changed the Terror Radius fade time for when crouching/uncrouching to fade out/in \~4 seconds, down from 6.6 seconds.*
---
The biggest problem with the increased terror radius was that she could no longer get close to survivors using Whispers and continue undetected, so she now needed Monitor and Abuse occupying a perk slot for it. This change was done for consistency between Killer speed and terror radius. But she got a buff to her crouch, so whatever, fair enough.
---
\*Patch 2.7.0
---
*Nerf: RBTs only became active whenever a generator is completed. Inactive RBTs no longer triggered when attempting to leave via an exit gate.*
---
Whether we agree this was necessary or not due to the addition of the endgame collapse, this completely removed her endgame pressure capacity. This was a major nerf that greatly crippled her and was not followed by a counterbalancing nerf.
---
\*Patch 3.1.0
---
*Nerf: The Pig's Ambush Attack was no longer considered a basic attack.*
---
This meant that the ambush attack didn't work with Sloppy Butcher, Make Your Choice, NOED, Franklin's Demise etc. anymore, so this was another major nerf that removed another range of strong strategies from her kit. Later we saw this also done to other killers (e.g. we just saw it for Legion), but they got counterbalancing buffs, she didn't.
---
\*Patch 3.3.1
---
*Buff: Updated The Pig while in crouch mode with the Undetectable status effect.*
---
This was actually the side effect of a buff to Ghostface against Object of Obsession. This was done for all stealth killers. And this didn't have much impact because when crouched Pig is the slowest killer, so unlike Ghostface trying to stay undetected as Pig to bypass OoO completely removes map presence and pressure.
---
\*Patch 3.4.0
---
*Nerf: Deep Wound timer no longer went down when Sprinting or while Mending. Deep Wound was no longer connected with the Killers terror radius.*
---
This wasn't just a nerf to Legion, this also meant that Pig (and Ghostface, and Wraith) could no longer bypass the endurance effect by continuing the chase while crouched, which was a strategy that lots of Pig mains used. Again, Legion got something in return, she didn't. So we can consider she just got another nerf.
---
In summary Pig was strongly nerfed and didn't receive any buffs that would balance those large losses out. She was a mid tier killer that really didn't need any nerfs and just got weaker and weaker over time and now she has one of the lowest pick rates. Lots of people now consider her one of the weakest killers (e.g. Fungoose thinks of her as the second worst killer, between Doctor and Legion). Buffing Pig is extremely necessary.
---
LOL I wish I did because that would be funny but I definitely don't.
---
Bait and hide. Like you're high rank, should be easy. If rank is such a big deal. Excuses
---
I get that, but even when you see imperfections in your drawings, you can still see that it is a very good drawing without the need to be an attention whore.
---
OMG you are so right it IS always Claudettes!!!
---
Yea I see this a lot also. I'll loop the killer for what should be 3-4 gens with a decent team, but with some teams I have people who just follow me and the killer... That's not helpful. Nor is it when the killer has downed me, picks me up and and Dwight decides to backpeddle in front of him with a flashlight... That's not how flashlights work, please go do gens...
---
Legion got a pretty great buff, Doctor is getting a massive buff soon. Certain playstyles might be nerfed, but the killers overall are getting massively improved. Nurse and Spirit (only very slightly) got nerfed sure, but they were definitely in a place they could have been knocked down a bit. Oni's nerf wasn't meant to be so severe as mentioned by the devs and will be corrected likely with the midpatch.
---
mindgamed
---
I love when I have a survivor chasing me to get a flashlight save, like I can't hear their footsteps. I know full well they are doing 0 to help the game progress. I can only imagine that shit is annoying too.
---
I main Myers and like to switch up my builds low terror radius some games other builds massive terror radius on a tiny map so my rank shifts between 1-5 with killer
---
I find camping of any form scummy even when necessary. I've been in the situation in the End Game Collapse where I have to facecamp somebody since it'll be my only kill but I still feel bad since I'm ruining some dudes experience. He came here to have fun, not sit on a hook immobile for 2 minutes while some fat, coughing Clown stares at your crotch.
---
no just a godawful meme
---
I don’t understand why people don’t run I’m All Ears. Probably one of the best perks in the game that help you in a chase.
---
&gt;fairly good
---
&gt;rank 16
---
I can feel that claudette's pain. Literally all of her teammates got down in seconds and you could clearly tell she had no idea how to solve the situation
---
This is my issue with their design philosophy. They seem more concerned with reducing survivor annoyance than making killers fun or efficient to play. All this makes me want to do is be a survivor main.
---
Lol sometimes.
---
Inner strength. Self care takes too long and I never pull off any adrenaline clutches because I’m either already dead or healed when it pops.
---
He doesn't have ruin and I know, that it's probably haunted ground, but I am a baby meg. So I have to cleanse it!
---
Thinking BBQ is overpowered in any way is a bit ludicrous. It's also a good way to make sure that someone doesn't get camped. If you let yourself be seen, the killer will go for you, and you can ensure a teammate can be saved.
---
What do you guys think of this then? 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEFNF6UfURE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEFNF6UfURE)
---
Why is there only 2 survivors? Was this staged between your friends?
---
Until they add rewards for ranking up I've just given up on caring about my rank. I find high ranks to be fun but at the same time frustrating. Survivors are sometimes too good for me and manage their time effectively getting gens done in 6 or less minutes while in that time I'm just barely getting my first hook. Sometimes I just want to wind down and relax by pub-stomping some poor dudes in 2 minutes but when you're in red ranks those games are rare.
---
Rank 20s did gens? Don’t lie.
---
The DCing is bullshit but edge of the map is fair, if you’re likely to down me then making the basement hook unviable could cause you to abandon the chase and switch targets, if you’ve already got the other 3 I’d just give you it unless you had facecamped then or something though.
---
I just recently made a post about this, I believe it is. The entry before this one teases the next survivor as well, I think!
---
Are they not added to console because i swear to god i still get lag switchers and garbage connections
---
Except for all the Rank 1s that do it.
---
You’d be surprised to see
---
I would absolutely buy this!
---
Freddy is pretty small but he has the same hitbox as all the other killers so while it looks like he dosent reach too far with his claw, he actually reaches just as far as any other killers weapon which is why most BS looking hits are from him.
---
Assuming the statics are 100 attempts , 5 successes : that makes it something like 1 success per 20 attempts and if all of them attempt to escape 3 times there will be 12 attempts and still you need to be lucky to unhook yourself.. (FYI Itried 99 attempts few more times and the result of all of them was kinda similar to this one)
---
I'm curious about what "Terra Dark" is. A different world or Galaxy perhaps? Maybe a different dimension. We know the Entity pulls from worlds all across the multiverse meaning there is no limits on what he can pull in. There is probably trials going on somewhere with aliens as the victims.
---
Keys are consumed to open the hatch, unless they have an add on preventing that.
---
Nemesis+PWYF hasn’t had as much time to be used and properly compared to SF+Enduring, the conditional bloodlust it applies has already been shown to make certain killers much more threatening than being able to nullifying every third pallet. The main counter to it seems to be dropping pallets a bit earlier, same as SF+E. When you look at it as “out-of-chase bloodlust on every stun” vs. “cancel out every third pallet”, Nemesis+PWYF has significantly more potential. So far I’ve used and seen this combo used with great success on Plague, Bubba, Clown, and even hillbilly (though billy definitely benefits more from SF+E). Once it has some time to see use and experimentation, I imagine it’ll be seen as much more effective than SF+E. Overall it’s more killer and user dependent than anything, as efficient use requires knowledge of both how to utilize 5% move speed in general as well as on whichever killer one is playing.
---
If you looked at the scoreboard, there were 4 survivors. I was playing Solo with all the random people I've had.
---
Well in that case only possible reason seems to be victim complex, I'm sorry.
---
Try to have some fun out there, mate.
---
Aaaannd it's gone
---
Hope so 😮
---
I think you already offended your first Premonition Urban Gamer.
---
They could think your toxic, or it could be a game glitch
---
Your wording is confusing but if what you're trying to ask is if you keep the items you have on you when you escape, which is yes.
---
Any of Ash’s, Quentin’s or Tapp’s perks. I already have pharmacy, detectives hunch and MoM, idc if they’re good or not I just want all the perks in the game without having to buy and level the licensed characters (I did by the stranger things chapter tho because I like stranger things lol)
---
&gt;B: same reason the survivors can't just straight up punch the shit out of legion: their minds cannot phantom performing such actions (it was worded more elegantly when I read/heard that part, but i have no idea if they mentioned it in a dev stream or if it was just a random lore tidbit about why the survivors dont fight back)
---
Well they are constantly retconning what the entity feeds on, as of the archives it feeds on ignorance so you're pretty much spot on, it essentially calls "our world" clueless and the survivors are idiots.
---
You were clearly dreaming that he hit you
---
Billy, Oni, and Nurse would like a word. Its only "killer sided" if you're playing a killer that doesn't need good sight lines. I. E., killers that don't suffer on really any map.
---
I wasent going for the challenge initially just a map to play with unlimited T3 but the opportunities arose when everyone was in the basement
---
Thx i'll try that out.
---
Im pretty sure my original theory was wrong to begin anyways.
---
Really weird problem. For how long and how many times has it happened? Could just be coincidence or it could be the killer leaving thinking you're gonna be toxic. 
---
Does the same problem occur with her other cosmetics or with other characters?
---
Wow
---
Some people just like taking out the trash.
---
Yeah, but can Amanda take selfies of her victims?
---
Don’t slug unless it’s tactically efficient to do so.
---
2019 has passed and the game is still in a pretty bad shape. Killers are mostly bad, maps are extremely bad and all needs to be reworked and 75% of the perk are useless.  
---
2020 might be your last year, so don't mess.
---
Without LOS blinking is a gamble. Especially with the cool downs. Nurse sucks on Lery's.
---
Laughs in calm spirit
---
It could be about life in his native country before moving to America and beginning work for azarov, maybe he had family issues at home, was a criminal fleeing the country or maybe he just wanted a fresh start. His current Lore says nothing about his life before coming to America so there's lots of storytelling potential there.
---
LOL ok - thanks for being so kind.
---
No thanks.
---
Honestly I felt horrible doing the NOED challenge. I let those two survivors do the last gen and then we got to the exit gate... God them pointing at me to open it made me feel horrible after I hooked them but opened it in time
---
😂😂😂
---
Ahhh I see ! I'm 880 shards short 😅 but it's okay. Thank you for telling me about it. I'll keep my eye out for it when I'm able to play more matches!
---
Likely to be either this or the alchemist. Then again, Oni’s info in the game files looked like they were meant for an alchemist-type killer so who knows.
---
I also agree with this statement
---
Lel people in the comments actually complaining about noed
---
Game crashes when you use a certain map offering aswell. I don't want to say which because this community IS that petty.
---
Why should people keep their emblem points if they DC, you should be punishing people who DC not rewarding them.
---
There’s another theory being over looked. As with my cousins they think they can unhook you and then 360 their way out of being hit. It never seems to work as much as they’re confidence in it working.
---
Yea shes still the best but it was a nerf, her chases are now longer than the old nurse classifying it as a nerf. The add on changes was also a nerf but it was justified as they were busted.
---
If its glowing its going
---
Sorry what? Wow wtf lel.
---
Playing both sides is great for getting better at the side you prefer. Outplaying a killer as survivor will help you avoid being outplayed in the same way when you play killer and vice versa.
---
Maybe missing textures? Odd problem but i had the same thing in a different game.
---
Michael is such a fun and versatile killer to play and go against. He has so many different builds add-ons and play styles that each time you face him it's a different experience.
---
You're wrong about that.  But that's ok.  It just means you haven't seen enough pyramid head.
---
Yeah something like this. The hexes are essentially spells right? Cleansing is like despelling, it isn't a case of just breaking a totem. And if it were in any way, there would be a force stopping that from being possible. 
---
Now I don't have an answer for how rubbing and grunting achieves that anymore than how giving a back rub heals a hatchet to the face. But surely we can let that slide..
---
I assume that's the name of "our world" in DbD lore. We assume the playable survivors and killers are from our world "Terra" and the Entity lore calls it a "dark world" because we are ignorant and don't know about the Fog.
---
&gt;Skill check doctors are gimmick builds
---
Gimmick or not they aren't a thing that people like to play against.
---
&gt;survivors have decent control over whether or not the gens are close together.
---
That's not how a 3 gen doc works. He finds his 3 gen at the start of the match by just looking at their auras and he sits there. Those gens are the only ones he gives a shit about. The map working well for him is just a bonus.
---
You dont chase, down and hook people. You get them to tier 3 by either shocking them or passively via aura in treatment mode with Calm and Order (which increases the rate of the passive madness gain).
---
Your objective is keeping the survivors in the match for as long as possible. There is a reason hostage doc is bannable, it's probably the only way currently for the killer to keep the game semi-hostage.
---
I attempted this yesterday with a friend who saved 99% generators, and distracted approaching killer so I can finish the gen. I miraculously completed 4 generators, all four survivors made it out of the trial. I got out to the post-game screen, feeling incredible. 
---
Didn't have Dark Sense equipped.

Custom Game 2 Killer Glitch. Ghostface Mori's survivors and Amanda photobombs
---
I don’t know what calm spirit has to do with Claudette.
---
oh yeah, my bad. Good stuff!
---
wait until you get to the one where you have to sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement in a single trial
---
Exactly this. The better a killer is the more likely they are to know when slugging is their win condition. And one person with Unbreakable can save the day. Awesome play!
---
I think this was the most entitled response I've ever received. Macmillan is the most broken map i've experienced next to Mother's and Purgation. Not counting its infinite loop with the ironworks, too many safe zones that you can literally 1v1 the killer easily camping at each pallet - boring for survivors who've olayed it before, and even more boring for killers because you then have 0 power as the supposed power role.
---
In Lery's and Hawkins you have to plan ahead, as I move through the map as survivor I make mental note of where the pallets and windows are and will sometimes loop the killer around two or three pallets at once, until they realize they have to break them. The inclusion of windows makes that even eaiser. As killer - I do the same seeing where the loops can be done and then try to mind game survivors away from them or push to waste them. I can really appreciate the survivors who can actually plan ahead an utilize the maps makes it more fun and more un predictable unlike Macmillian where its the same copy and paste game every time.
---
I am not entirely sure why you are playing an asymmetrical game if you expect every single game to be the exact same as the last. Have you considered mortal kombat, you would enjoy the combo based 1v1 fighting.
---
It's alright :)
---
What skin is it you're using? I haven't played in a couple weeks and haven't been keeping up with the new skins
---
Rin Yamaoka?
---
It only seems to happen constantly when I’m playing Yui and in that cosmetic and it’s been happening for the past week. Yesterday I got disconnected from the killers lobby 8 times in a row.
---
Wait. You’re saying different killers succeed on different maps?  omg the revelation
---
Have you not played SH2?
---
Please inform me.. when have you EVER seen Pyramind Head run in ANY form of media? 
---
Have you see him swing his sword ever?

I know that you keep items you find in a trial as the next trial I played I found a purple med kit and didn’t consume it and that was placed in my inventory, however the skeleton key in the trial prior was not consumed and I didn’t use it to open the hatch because I opened an exit gate, but it was not placed in my inventory after the trial finished.

Empathy and Overcharge 100%
---
Dark Earth or something. With what the lore has been saying, the Entity pulls people from different Earth's Flashpoint style
---
So you're saying empathy is trash? I think its one of the best solo perks.
---
If you can get it I would highly reccomend doing so. The mental effect of not being able to see slug auras map wide is surprisingly strong. Unless bond/empathy/aftercare/etc are in effect people have to get off generators and go slug hunting. Once you get 2 people down it will generally snowball from there as people run around trying to pick each other up.
---
In tome 4 both paths have a tough road block. Yes they are doable, however I think either way you go its gonna be equally as difficult.
---
Toxic because of the cosmetic?
---
Here's what you can do about it. Before you activate your ability, get close to the survivor and force the spring burst, get close again and activate your ability. The perk just somewhat counters Legion but it's what it is.
---
I know, however I didn’t use it to open the hatch as I opened an exit gate and didn’t consume any of it as it has to have an add on for it to do anything other than open the hatch but it was not placed in my inventory, I was wondering whether the skeleton key had its own set of ‘rules’ regarding keeping it after surviving a trial with it.
---
Inconclusive
---
Dude I swear I'm still in low ranks cuz my team mates are shiiiiiit
---
Ok it's also my fault if I do something but still.
---
Most likely a bug then
---
dead hard is now just getting exhausted and laying down
---
Balanced landing was 150 also, and sprint burst only lasts a few seconds, if you stick on them you will catch them with feral frenzy, unless you were at the end of its duration. But, if that was the case, balanced countered him as well
---
I wanted to know what servers they've added to the game so I can use VPN and play in a different region than the one I'm playing on
---
Haha I play Jake lol
---
Next week, it's my turn to post this meme
---
Man, reach level 10 at least. In that ranks (20-10) as a killer, you will have to wait around 10 minutes more or less. 
---
My tip: get your best killer and play the games as if they were going to be the last (try to achieve 4 red emblems to reach 10 rank asap). Then your effort will be rewarded: 1 game in less than a minute :). I know its hard (and more without ruin -fuck rush gen-) but is what all of us do.
---
Sorry for my english, and goos luck ;)
---
Tag, you’re it
---
Well yeah. The downside is your stunned for like a second or two. Can increase or decrease with add-ons
---
[deleted]
---
Give it a month or two. With the new rank reset it will soon dilute rank 1 games with much more mediocre survivors and killers.
---
Please continue with these they're adorable
---
Oh ok that makes more sense I guess
---
Lmao, what?💀
---
I main survivor but even I know that's pointing at the killer. Toxic survivors gonna be toxic though 🤷‍♂️
---
Exaclty
---
What are you arguing against here? I agreed that I didn't think he was great In his current state. I just don't agree he's even close to being g that annoying. In my 4000 (4500 if you count my time on consle) hours if this game I have seen a doc play like that ONCE. I should also add it's not effective. At all. Some players are assholes, but most people want to win in some capacity. If people want to be annn
---
Lying and still do somewhat well they will play Legion,freddy, Spirit. So on an so forth.
---
We are arguing in circles at this point. The doc rework looks like shit. Doc isn't that annoying to play against. The devs are approaching reworking a low tier killer with the wrong attitude.
---
I sure will
---
I prefer a specific order of charms on different people because they all place differently and I like the botony knowledge books on claudette, and the mini claudette
---
aaah, no please😰
---
I'm about rank 10 now because I didn't play the game for a while (I was rank 1 multiple times). Right now it takes about 5 minutes for me to get the lobby which is ultra sonic 5g fast for Dbd in my opinion :P.
---
Yeah they’re just as bad as the flashlight heroes. Do nothing all game just following the person being chased around trying to get a flashlight save.
---
I bought the same outfit last week for Yui on PS4 Pro, Never got disconnected.
---
Probably Haunted Grounds tbh
---
Every killer gets "dumpstered" in high ranks because of 4man SWF, the only games your not is when its 2 duos or 2 or more Solos. Then when you are in rank 8 to 1 - the majority of games you find are SWF.
---
Also bot my fault if you can't use the killer right or know how to mind game. Doctor can make enitire safe loops un usuable, and has a better version of fake pallets. He is actually fun to go against unlike other m1 killers where you just camp safe pallets till they leave you alone and then immediately jump back on a gen.
---
If you think Hawkins in killer favored your not playing it right. Plan ahead. It's not the better players fault that there are so many survivors who are boosted for relying on weak m1 killers and safe loops alone. As Survivor I win most of the time on lery's and hawkins.
---
I agree, fire the ones that made maps like Macmillan estate, and other maps soaked in safe loops - then pay more to the ones that are making maps that actually take skill and planning ahead like Hawkins and Lery's (minus the office - change that loop).
---
I didn't say he could run.  His in game power would have to be something unrelated to the basic chase mechanic which almost guarantees we'll never see him in game.
---
And yes, I've played all the silent hills.  I've seen pyramid head swing his sword very fast.
---
In this fight he's very fast with his sword swings.  https://youtu.be/ujVuhm1-_AI
---
Once my game lagged and boom I was on the hook
---
Yeah it seems far more often I get one hit on them as they approach and my cooldown is gone in time to down them even if they succeed at the hook. And thats when I am running from across the map. I cant imagine what fool thinks they can do it while the killer is camping
---
Yep, cirtain cosmetics get permanently labled toxic by the community.

Example:nea with short pink hair

I honestly just feel proud that my meme

Are *you* the original artist of this masterpiece? The Salvador Dali of DBD shitposts?
---
Farming when someone leaves is fine because otherwise no one really gets any bloodpoints
---
Wow, what a disrespectful shithead. You said nothing about flashlight clicking while being chased. 
---
I'm actually a killer main, and am nowhere near good enough at survivor to ever get the killer's attention on purpose, ever. I don't even use flashlights. You don't know me, judgmental prick. Just gonna block you.
---
I dont know if it helps, but I don't tunnel. It's more fun for me if I divide my attention among survivors 😋
---
Clown is his disguise. Devs didn’t want him to use clown themed weapons or traps. Too cliche
---
Your... logic... is based on one single scene in a movie he didn’t belong in over all of the other lore of the game and the character... I just... wow. And in fact even in that very small closer quarter combat scene he was still very slow in comparison to his opponent. 
---
His sword is literally so heavy he has to drag it. Tell me again how fast one can pick up and swing a sword they can barely carry.
---
You can use the key without addons ma dude, the addons only apply extra effects to it like aura reading.
---
The killer could had franklins and that knocks it off your hand
---
This is so cute!
---
Where’s my boy Oni though?
---
Ghostface, Spirit, Nurse, Billy, good Huntress and good Hag, and good Wraith can beat a 4man swf reliably. Doctor is not strong. His shock also has a delay, so you can still make many loops. To top it off, his map pressure is almost as bad as Clowns. If you want to live in a fantasy world where Doc is an amazing killer that's on you, but you're certainly in the minority. The majority of red rank killers don't share your opinion. 
---
Everybody thinks Hawkins is killer favored. Narrow halls, hard to lose survs, confusing layout, over 90% unsafe pallets, etc. Hawkins is absolutely a killer favored map. Your survivor experience is not indicative of most of the population, considering the 70% kill rate there. I always get a 3 or 4k there, even on garbage killers like Clown.
---
I finished that one yesterday too,now I gotta slap the killers face with pallets 😂😂😂
---
A player is only as good as the tool they use, a tool which suits the task at hand. It's telling that, instead of his own trapper which he is far more comfortable with, he takes Freddy. 
---
Fungoose agrees, and Tofu has said that Freddy can easily hold his own vs highly skilled players. 
---
https://youtu.be/cb_qDdN0qHk?t=859

r/stabbygang approves
---
What do you mean this is difficult? I did this first try!
---
This. Killer messaged me in lobby told me to farm and bring cake/streamers and once I maxed out to come to basement. Exactly how I did it. I wasn't even mad.
---
Yeah, I got bitched at in the post game chat because I didn’t let one of the survivors live in a game I was about to get a 0K on. Wasn’t even the one that died that was complaining. 
---
Didn’t face camp, didn’t tunnel, was just told to fuck myself because “killers let survivors go”
---
Cool?
---
No, mom said it's my turn to repost.
---
I thought the skeleton key had to have add ons? I know the dull key can be used alone. My character still had it in their hand on the end of trial screen whilst running but there was no ‘item obtained’ slide and I didn’t get hit at all by the hag that trial so there was no way of me dropping it because I was not hit once
---
This is cursed
---
i cleanse even if i KNOW it’s haunted ground because if it’s devour we’ll all be pissed we didn’t cleanse. no totem escapes me😤

Y’all are taking this way too serious...geez I didn’t know pointing was like committing murder on this community  😂

Some of the art is spectacular, and titties aside I've seen some really good cosplay there. Bunny Mama has a badass huntress costume
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday! Had a Michael that hit me through every pallet and had a lunge range of his tier 3 lunge at all times, the rest of the game was not laggy at all other than those hits and the killers movement every once in a while
---
Hmph.. Fine. Cant argue that!
---
11 pm**
---
The green key needs addons because its shit, literally no usage what so ever, but the pink and purple key can open hatch without anything
---
After getting screwed the first time that's what I started doing... to moderate success. Legion works best when you can go on a stabbing spree and injure 2-3 survivors at a time (hence why he has discordance, to find grouped survivors) and slow down the game. However, with sprint burst (there were 3 in my last game ;_;) the survivors just scatter and you just become a shitty M1 killer with a long cooldown after his first hit. Waiting 3 seconds for sprint burst to fuck off means you can't reasonably stab more than 1 survivor at a time. I actually stopped using Feral Frenzy altogether except at the blood lodge to get a hit on the window vault.
---
Damn , I seem to be stayin about the same level , been red 3/4 consistently for last 3 resets on survivor and I hate the matchmaking times, but 35 mins ? Fuck that dude , I'm usually waitin about 5 mins for a lobby and then praying the dedicated servers don't kick me out within 5 secs as a could not join host msg!
---
And I think that is an excessive wait time, you must have some levels of patience!
---
I'll double down on that shit. Screw gens, I'm a certified bone hunter :\^)
---
I dont understand dead hard. Usually in the games where I'm killer they'll either. 1 use it early or 2 use it and avoid my hit but get downed anyways. What's the appeal for surviving ten more seconds?
---
it goes
---
I don't see the difference
---
Thanks. And why is it toxic to wear it? It's just an outfit, no?
---
New trap addon: Mouse Trap - attracts all the botany/self-care blendettes in a radius of 32/40/48 meters
---
No lmao. You're not obligated to leave, especially if survivors are right there waiting to save. They're just mad that you don't play by their made up rules.
---
Sadly they’re only on pc and switch :,(
---
opening the game is camping what are you new? lol
---
Yeah I know the pink and purple can open the hatch without addons but you can’t use the pink key to read auras without addons and I opened an exit gate at the end of the trial and escaped through that, I didn’t consume the key at all but I’m confused as to why it wasn’t placed in my inventory if I kept it the whole trial and escaped with it still equipped
---
love when ruin spawns in slightly occluded locations. had a match as hag where it spawns in a cubby hole next to a generator. trapped both. they got the gen but left the ruin lmao
---
Ok well at least i know for sure now lol
---
Inb4 it’s actually haunted grounds
---
Every face camper i face gets added to my screenshot collection on steam xD

---
The piper perri meme
---
This may shock you... but such reports and penalties take awhile for the punishment to be handed out.  It has near nothing to do with the game before, or likely the prior week.
---
Honestly, the only buff I want is maybe to let Sabo see hooks within 32 meters.
---
I mean, it's been forgotten for too long- And I feel like It'd help pre-saboing hooks, while also still ensuring that you still to be in the right position to drop hooks before survivors are hooked.  
---
Edit: I know it's not up there, I just wanted to say it.
---
I can read it actually but thanks  nonetheless😊
---
Doing a gen turns on an elevator.
---
Ah, my bad I didn't know that, damn, I would uninstall but I think that's slugging ain't it?
---
IDK, Maybe it will, most likely not and it a patch problem.
---
It's been a bug since dedicated servers dropped, it's a pretty bad one too. Hopefully they'll fix it when they fix his and spirit's post uncloaking/phase speed :/
---
Don't you know that if a killer remains on the map after he hooks a survivor he's camping??
---
damn they deleted fast
---
See that's what I thought, if I was just sitting there then yeah, I agree I was camping but I wasn't, I go to move and bump into fuckers hiding behind corners all the time
---
My frustration is I've finished the challenges and am at tier 53, so I need to grind up to 70.
---
You still wouldn't bloodlust it with her?
---
The other 3 survivors then took 10 hours to look for ruin. And some even gen tapped 😔
---
i didnt want to run SB bc it was the best and i didnt want to use the best exhaust perk.
---
But now that BL is gone there is almost no other option, but SB is fun so
---
I’m not even gonna bother!
---
With each legion nerf, borrowed time rise up. Im interested in how they would handle him(hopefully).
---
I was pointing out the wording lmao
---
I solo alot at rank 1. I usually equip at least 2-3 perks to feed information and protect my team. (BT, Kindred/Aftercare, etc) If you feel comfortable at looping, have the killer find you first or try to take aggro from other survivors. 
---
But still; you win some, you lose some.
---
It's not. I've been with horrible communities. DbD is salty at worst, everything else is a meme.
---
This is gold 😂
---
I’m rank 1 on console and it usually takes less than 3 minutes for killer lobbies lol.
---
One doesn't usually have super human strength like pyramid head.  He drags it 1 because it's awesome, and 2 he doesn't drag it because he can't carry it normally.  He drags it because holding it normally all day would no doubt wear his arm out.  Not to mention bhvr Usually uses the latest movie version of a killer.
---
The decapitation swing was lightning fast; including a few swings in the middle of the fight.  You can't win that argument.  
---
And no.  My logic is not based on one single scene in a movie.  You asked me to show you one single instance I've seen him swinging his sword fast in media.  Wow indeed.    
---
Calm down.  It's ok to be wrong.
---
If at any point you have intentionally killed yourself on the hook.. you are the cancer plaguing this game.
---
Ive wanted a perk to allow the punting of at least one totem in a game
---
Hostage Doc players have been banned in the past because the entire point of the build is to literally hold the game hostage so it never ends. When the Doc player avoids their objective in actually killing the survivors in favor of prolonging the game, they will get banned when they're reported. 
---
It's not about whether it's an effective build for killing the survivors, the build exists to grief other players and will hopefully be changed in the Doc update.
---
Complaining really works i think xD last night i was doing some matches with the gf each 20+min que but everytime she said "long ass que takes forever" we instantly got in a lobby, some without killer tho but hey improvement xD
---
good call
---
i would 100% buy some as well. if you ever sell please let me know
---
If it glows it goes
---
Some of the windows on Torment Creek/Rancid Abattoir are absolutely busted, and against some killers you can maintain distance enough that chase will never initiate so the window won't even get blocked. It is definitely something that needs fixing, but map design is probably the biggest flaw int he game right now anyway.
---
PC or console? I mean that is a possibility but I didn't get to 1500 hours recently :P I've been playing a while and never have had the luck of getting into a lobby within a reasonable time.
---
&gt; devs want to make Doctor less annoying to play against
---
&gt; one of the add-on changes buffs the skillcheck build
---
What did they mean by this?
---
It’s not about being careful 
---
I mean, facing walls should just be a habit
---
But going out of your way to make sure a survivor was able to hit that save?
---
Unnecessary
---
This is the best thing I've seen this decade

&gt; Freddy is reworked to A tier

PM us and we can see what we can do for you! :)
---
The Spirit would like to know your location.
---
Aww... It's a gaggle of Dweets.
---
Well as that person playing solo who doesn’t want to farm and thus always just gets farmed/killed by the other players... you’re the exception and not the rule.
---
On the vast majority of maps a good hillbilly can get from point A to point B in almost the same exact time as an oni. The only exception being inside maps, but those are killer sides anyway and generally small so Billy can still do fine. In addition billy can always use his mobility since he always has his power, so throughout the course of a match Billy will almost always be more mobile than an oni, as far as his ability to reliably defend gens far apart. So does oni have "much more mobility" than Billy as you claim? I would have to disagree for any outside map.
---
Next point, hitting multiple survivors. Ok? So what? Unless the survivors are literal potatoes or you camp/tunnel off hook and try to hit the unhooker and unhooked you will never ever actually hit more than one person with the attack.  That's like saying bubba Is better than Billy becuase he can hit multiple targets. That's literally only ever useful for camping.
---
I'll give you the tracking, but at the same time it's not the best tracking tool since you have no way of knowing how fresh the blood is. Still this is a actual advantage he has over billy.
---
But then you get to the "forcing survivors to heal or he keeps his power up" but guess what? Billy always has his power up. So if they dont heal, you're Billy that has to walk around to charge his power, and if they do heal you are a Billy who has to get smacks to get his power. How is this an advantage for him again?
---
And as far as the 1 hit kill attack while in demon mode, literally any time an oni can land that a good Billy could have landed a back rev chainsaw. That is not an advantage over Billy at all
---
Not necessarily. During the pickup animation I can look for nearby hooks and plan my route to be as efficient as possible.
---
This is especially important if survivors decide to body block. Every second counts, so I don't wanna waste a couple seconds looking for the best hook while they're wiggling
---
It's a really good combo. Any standard killer's Terror Radius will drop from 32-24, and with Nurse's you'll see them healing before they hear you coming.
---
I don’t agree with detective Huntch, since it will only be useful against trapper and Fixated doesn’t need a change. Other than those two I pretty much agree with all of them.
---
Is this your first meme? These colors..

Oh boy that fishnet bodysuit...
---
I hate playing against Huntress in game but for her I'll make an exception.
---
“Knife play”
---
Of course the guy who stalks other people is a kinky bastard
---
And then survivors DC so you have to do it all over again. Then they complain about everybody running basement builds.
---
Idk about best. Dead hard's invincibility frames save my ass more than a 3 second head start in chase.
---
Haha ruin lasts longer than 30 seconds in your games? Fuck, it's always broken when I find my first survivor 😭
---
Criticizing the self healing is wrong on your part.  Gotta be healed at some point, as that speed boost from being hit can make chases immensely longer.
---
I recently got to Rank 3 Survivor (console pleb) and noticed that Killers are camping and tunneling a lot more in the higher ranks regardless of what Killer they play. It is my understanding that the higher you climb the ranks as Killer the more skilled Survivors you'll face (I never get those skilled survivors as a solo surv). Could that be why they are tunneling or am I just having a bad stretch of Killers the past week?
---
This is seriously cool as fuck!
---
Forgot the killer had BBQ like an idiot but got bailed out by RNG
---
&gt;I think this was the most entitled response I've ever received
---
What does that even mean? I think one realm is better than the other, that makes me entitled?
---
&gt;In Lery's and Hawkins you have to plan ahead
---
You can't plan ahead because every room is completely random and you are praying to RNG to get you something useful. On open maps you CAN plan ahead since you can realistically see what you have to work with ahead of time.
---
&gt;and will sometimes loop the killer around two or three pallets at once
---
You aren't looping anything. You throwing down the pallet and running forward because it's so unsafe you know the killer will just walk around it isn't looping. You cannot loop anything outside of 2 pallets on the whole map because they are ridiculously unsafe.
---
&gt;until they realize they have to break them
---
They don't have to break them. The pallets are unsafe. Make them vault one and get a free hit. If you are breaking pallets during chase on Hawkings then you're making a mistake.
---
&gt;then try to mind game survivors away from them
---
Literally walk back and forth after they throw the pallet down and you get a free hit. The pallets might as well not exist.
---
&gt;I am not entirely sure why you are playing an asymmetrical game if you expect every single game to be the exact same as the last.
---
You realize that both macmillan and lery's get rng, right? The difference between them is that on macmillan you get to see ahead what you have to work with. Lery's is an indoor map, so you have no idea what's in the room till you get in. 
---
&gt;Killers are quitting by the dozens because survivor keeps getting favored into the power role and there isn't any work being done to balance the game
---
Survivors have been getting nerfs after nerfs for the last few months? Add ons (instaheals, blind speed, BNPs), perks (DS, Mettle, BL) maps (less pallets overall, unsafe loops on Badham, hawkings and yamaoka) and vaults (more difficult to get fast vaults). If you think survivors haven't been getting worked on then you aren't really paying attention. The recent change to kindred has been an attempt to bring swf and solo closer together. This isn't a competetive game, stop thinking about it as such, we're not playing CS:GO.
---
&gt;so soon you won't get into a game for 1-2 hours simply because there are no killers left
---
Right. As a killer main I don't see myself quitting anytime soon, and I'd much rather see Macmillan or Autohaven than Lery's or Hawkings.
---
When people dead hard early it's often to get to a safe loop/pallet. That can often make a chase last longer than just waiting for them to swing and try to evade it, especially since good killers will bait out the dead hard and just get them right after.
---
Too blurry to read
---
So its the current one then. I also different charms on survivors but on killers i jus want the same and i own killers except hag and pig and it become like a pain
---
yes Hillbilly is good to. Wtf are you arguing? I never said Hillbilly sucked, in fact if you paid attention I still said Hillbilly is overall more reliable and that Oni's actual Demon Dash is a lot more versatile and mobile than Hillbilly's Chainsaw Sprint. They are both still good killers. I'm just pointing out that you can get more out of an Oni Demon Dash than a Hillbilly's chainsaw sprint, with the obvious drawback being that you don't always have it available.
---
As for the forcing survivors to heal up, that goes in line with the tracking along the insta down. A survivor constantly leaving blood orbs everywhere isn't hard to find is just the secondary benefit of almost always having access to your Blood Rage. I mean do you refuse to use the hillbilly chainsaw if everyone is injured? No, you don't as you can still use it for mobility.
---
Could you imagine if the several fireworks item could be used to destroy totems!?
---
Don't forget the God Tier aggro passing teammates leading the Killer straight to your Gen!
---
still
---
You should have edited the Dark Souls “You Died” text. 
---
Also that timing was perfect.
---
I use BBQ to teabag the killer from across the map.
---
You’re right, it is okay to be wrong. I am always happy to admit when I’m wrong. Problem is....
---
I’m not. So... shrug. 
---
I asked you to show me when you’ve ever seen him run. You decided to show me a non-canon fight scene instead.
---
One. I doubt a character like pyramid head is thinking “yeah it’s so cool to drag my big hunk of metal sword”
---
Two. “He can’t just comfortably carry it around all day. That’s silly” bruh. These are monsters that APPEAR in Silent Hill. They’re not all walking around, hanging out, drinking tea and killing time.again, using your movie logic. You literally watch him appear behind someone as the world turns to the hell world.
---
Every swing took at least half a second to a full second (I’m estimating). The only swings that appeared “faster” were ones when the camera moved to him and he was already mid swing, meaning you’re pretending the prep time for the swing and the beginning of the swing doesn’t exist. 
---
Press the attack button in DbD, how fast does that swing go off? If killers took a full second to swing their weapons from button press to damaged hit box, killers would be losing their shit. Plus, as a killer, you don’t have to stop moving to swing, pyramid Head does, know why? Cause he’s swinging a giant hunk of metal. He might be able to take a step or two, max.
---
Just think about it logistically and you’ll see what I mean.
---
The fact that you can’t even use the non-canon lore to support your side of this debate is clear he doesn’t below in DbD
---
Btw decapitation swing took about 3-4  full seconds. Would be a cool mori. Still far to slow for DbD
---
Don’t you fucking dare insult David, you must respect both David and Jeff equally
---

Dude a good old nurse could just end chases immediately

Never better brah.

Could just have an alternative button when applying the charm to appky to all killers or something

 Can't wait for all the new customization items for you and the town, truly my favorite title to just lay back and chill with.
---
I don't think those lips will fit
---
My point is that he has little to no advantages over hillbilly and many disadvantages, making him significantly worse than Billy. My point is that the flick was what made oni unique and good and now hes just Billy with more steps. If someone is actually trying to be as effective as possible, why would they ever choose oni over Billy? That's what I'm getting at.
---
Was about to say, you got out of that locker too quick haha but luck was on your side  :)
---
Ideally yes you’d make a different queue for swf that was a bit longer, but then you’d split the player base and make wait times even longer.
---
Salt detected.
---
no, it is the best. if you know how to use it, it isnt just "3 second head start in chase"
---
it can be used like lithe, it can be used like DH, it can be used like BL, and it can save you from dead zones
---
I was in a game and it had an afk survivor, a DC, and someone who did nothing but teabag I felt bad when the last survivor gave up and came to me to kill them so I literally forced them to do gens and escape. They would follow me and I'd wack the gens so they'd start working on them then I led them to the exit gate
---
Legion and hag gang
---
Everyone except new players already unlocked all of claudette's teachables. Let's not fool ourselves.
---
As a killer main I think that if the recover bar fills up then survivors should be allowed to stand up because that's just b/s that someone can down you guys and leave you there
---
if it's an effectiveness issue, why would you choose either? Just play Nurse. If you aren't good at Nurse, just play Spirit.
---
I think your times are waaaaaaay too low, but I like the concept. Imagine a 40 second gen that had 2 or 3 people on it, or if any of them had toolboxes. It would turn in to a 10 second gen. And also it would be weird for matchmaking and swf. What if I’m a green rank killer but I’m going up against a swf that are in purple, or have someone in red ranks? They get all the benefits of being experienced but have a much easier gen.
---
As a killer main, Unbreakable is and will be the most powerful perk all because it can save you're an entire team (played right) from a pretty common slugging tactic.
---
alright hear me out entitled survivor mains
---
decisive strike prevents tunnelling, and it does that pretty well
---
but it's designed in a way so that survivors can use it as a 60 second invulnerability field, even if the killer doesn't tunnel
---
this allows them to just do gens with absolutely no risk
---
and before you say "oooh just slug them you stupid killer ma-" *have I told you about* ***L O C K E R S***
---
thank you for coming to my ted talk
---
I‘m an avid user of it and I can say locker saving someone is not a common occurrence. In a SWF yeah, it‘s pretty reliable for that since you can callout that you are in a locker with Head On, so they can be downed in front of it, but with randoms it‘s rare that the stars align and you happen to be in a locker to save someone. And even then it will work once. The Killer will be careful next time when picking someone up.
---
That‘s not really it‘s purpose. Like any other exhaustion perk it‘s purpose is to buy time and make distance and in terms of making distance I‘d say it‘s the best one since running away from a completely immobilized Killer who doesn‘t know which direction you ran in buys more time than simply zooming away with 130% movement speed.
---
It‘s range is surprisingly far. I‘d say you can stun a Killer that‘s about 1 or 2 feet away from the locker. I think when your hitbox collides with the Killer he‘s stunned and since you dash out a little forward it goes pretty far.
---
If you really want to save someone I‘d suggest running it alongside Dead Hard. That way the Killer won‘t expect you having another exhaustion perk. It‘s all about surprising the Killer.
---

Looking forward to bloodhunt on Jan 2nd

They plan to nerf Doctor not buff him. Why are you even arguing if you didn't watch the developer livestream?
---
"There is no limit to what the entity can pull in it's world" except the fact that they all must have humanoid skeletons.
---
And yet I've learned so much by doing them. For example: I got my first flashlight blind and then 5 more. I got better at the timing needed to pallet stun killers. And I discovered that spine chill is actually viable. All because I was trying to complete challenges.
---
I hate this game with a passion but I still play it with a passion.
---
Yeah I know, weird
---
&gt;The Emblem system kicked off the year by shaking up the way players earn pips
---
Not only was the Emblem system around before 2019, but it always was and still is a bad ranking system. Everybody ranks up with time, Emblems don't measure success or let alone skill. This leads to tons of subpar players piling up at the upper ranks, creating a huge skill/experience disparity and in turn awful gameplay experiences, for both sides. This is even more true now than ever before, with the new rank reset logic that makes it so more and more and worse and worse players gather in red ranks, because they never leave them again. With the old system you at least had a couple of days after every reset where red ranks actually saw players with a higher average proficiency, before the mass of mediocre-at-best players swarmed back in.
---
On top of that, it is soon 2020 and there are still no rank rewards of any sort. Without that and with the ranking system failing utterly at the only thing it is supposed to do (match roughly equally-skilled players), why don't they simply get rid of the ranking system altogether already? Create 1 pool of players consisting of those that have up to around 100 hours in the game, and another pool consisting of everyone else. ...Or actually make the ranking system matter.
---
&gt;The End Game Collapse raised the stakes at the end of a match, removing hatch standoffs
---
The Collapse was a good Quality-of-Life improvement for the game overall, but it's not perfect. Hatch standoffs still exist, in a way: if the killer finds the hatch first, they can stand on it waiting until they spot the survivor, to secure that the survivor won't be able to open a gate. The survivor in turn, if they figure this out, won't show themselves but stick around a gate waiting for the killer to grow tired of waiting and close the hatch. Stand-off.
---
There are also other problems with it, such as gate spawns for survivors and the difficulty of tracking scratchmarks for killers.
---
&gt;Then came the new Party Management system, which allowed you and your friends to stay grouped up after each match, making it easier than ever to play together.
---
The new party system has its share of issues that sometimes even make me think we were better off with the old system. The system bugging out and dissolving a lobby after games due to a variety of "errors" is a regular occurrence, again needing to recreate the lobby like we had to in the past. A less regular but also not rare occurrence are weird bugs in which players on their own screen are in the lobby and ready, whereas for other players, they either aren't in the lobby or aren't ready. These desyncs between clients often force at least one of the players to restart their game, if they want to continue playing as a party.
---
Then I also suspect the new queue system has increased the queue times for survivors, where due to a lobby not dissolving and being taken out of the queue when a killer dodges, it takes other survivors longer to get into a lobby to begin with. It's probably worse to get dodged and having to requeue multiple times, but the time-until-in-match is likely similar, if not worse with the new system. This could be reverted while keeping the new party management system in place, however.
---
&gt;Bringing servers to Dead by Daylight has been a huge task
---
But they're not officially released yet, still in a vague, months-long "testing phase" on PC, and not on any other platform besides the Switch. The first release date set around Summer was missed. As was the Autumn release. What's the holdup?
---
&gt;and we are pleased to see how much they’ve improved this year
---
I do wonder how many people at BHVR exactly are actively working on server implementation. Even in general it is my suspicion that there are only a handful or two of actual coders working on the game, and thus their time is awfully spread-out and spread-thin between things to implement into the game and fixing the never-ending and ever-growing (and ever-recurring) amount of bugs, and awfully little actual gameplay-relevant things get done. I can't otherwise explain how hundreds of people could possibly get so little stuff done, taking months and months to do much of anything, taking years to do things that should have always been there, and never getting other things done that likewise should. With dedicated gameplay servers however, they are as far as I know using a tailored service provided by Amazon. What actual work then is being done in-house to "improve" servers? Apart from the unplayably awful early PTB iteration of the servers, they have mostly been the same for months now, and the actual fundamental problem that people thought servers were supposed to remedy (hit registry) has not been improved upon whatsoever. Servers have not rid us of the killer latency advantage (they've actually made it even worse), and I don't see any work being done to that end either. Early on there was still talk of wanting to look at handling hit authority differently, but not anymore.
---
If you aren't confident moving hit detection away from the killer client, why not at least implement lag compensation on the servers to validate those hits? It's a core function of any serious timing-sensitive online multiplayer game, and games that are a lot more timing-sensitive than DbD employ lag compensation. You even hired people (or one person) with network expertise, or did you not? I remember the call for applications. What are they doing if not that, and why aren't they? Can you at least go on record and state that we will just have to deal with ridiculous hits due to the killer's latency advantage?
---
&gt;some of the benefits make their way into the game, such as the recently tested disconnect penalties
---
Disconnect penalties that should have been in the game for years already, that were supposed to be live with servers already, and that have already been taken out of the game after a few days of testing. On hold for another few weeks, or months. Why do things like this take so long to implement?
---
What other benefits for players are there, with the servers? Apart from a potentially more consistent and stable connection to the server and I guess the ability for you to do a few more things back-end, I don't see any benefits. And that more consistent client-to-server connection does not even matter for what's most important, which is hit registry - servers have increased total client-to-client latency and still have the killer as the sole authority on hits. Some regions have only suffered under servers, such as Russia, a pretty huge pool of players many of which have serious problems with the servers, either connection issues that prevent them from playing at all, or the issue that the servers are so far away that the latency renders the game unenjoyable. If you can't provide servers for a big portion of your playerbase, due to not wanting to pay so much money or due to Amazon not providing service in those regions (and you not being able to build your own server infrastructure), at least actually do what you said you wanted to, and put those regions back on peer-to-peer.
---
&gt;The Oni
---
Flick back when. Another thing I can't believe takes weeks and weeks to remedy.
---
&gt;a grand total of 27 new perks
---
Of which only a handful had any impact on the meta, and arguably none that had real impact on the survivor meta. Deliverance, Head On and Inner Strength are the only survivor perks among these releases that see much of any use, and even they are not meta-changers by much of any stretch.
---
&gt;we’ve made quality of life improvements to Decisive Strike, Kindred, and countless other perks
---
"Countless" is being a little generous, to put it generously. And if we're talking perk changes that actually mattered to the meta, DS and Kindred are among the only ones. There's the Balanced Landing change that did nothing but remove it from the meta. What else? Remember Me was never meta, but now is just awful. Pop Goes The Weasel was improved to be a proper meta perk. That's really it though.
---
&gt;We aim to improve how players experience the game and strengthen the foundations we’ve built so far.  
---
In the same way you had aimed to work on game health and "give back to the community" this year, where you went all but silent on optimization, implemented servers that exacerbate ridiculous hits, did not implement disconnect penalties, showcased the same inability to prevent serious bugs from entering (and re-entering) the game with every update even after PTBs, came out with a paid battlepass with challenges that often take away from gameplay, sometimes ruining it, had a ton of licensed money-only content and did not do anything for Christmas?
---
Well, there was the free sweater for Bill, something Valve probably suggested. And the formerly-exclusive cosmetics have been made available to everyone for free, though I suspect that was in large part done to get players that already owned these cosmetics to lose interest in them and buy other cosmetics.
---
Happy New Year!
---
Not to be a complete Negative-Nancy, there's also things I like about the game's progress, or I wouldn't be here anymore, writing a lengthy post on New Year's Eve...
---
Becuase the mechanics of those killers are completely different. Maybe they dont appeal to everyone. But oni and Billy are undeniably similar. If you like oni, you will probably like Billy. Since hes basically just a better oni. My point is I find it pretty lame that they basically nerfed oni to be a worse Billy. There isnt really a worse version or spirit or nurse, but if there was, I would ask the same question. Why choose the worse version instead of nurse or spirit?
---
New to the game and I just don't understand why killers don't try to win. They drop you off at the hatch, just go AFK and sometimes watch you or follow you around and let you complete generators? What is up with this? Makes the game super dull and boring.
---
My experience with  DBD tells me only one thing. 
---
This game was either super fun.

Or the Mikey committed suicide

I almost feel bad everytime I see these posts. I have only ever had to wait more then a minute or two for a match during bloodhunt and the only time my survivor ques are more than a few minutes are in a 4 man. That being said I decided to take off my try hard pants for one game yesterday to play a nice relaxing game of trapper (who I suck at) and got paired against a solid rank 1 swf. They stepped in one trap the entire game and disarmed every single other trap I put down no matter how random. No map, no OoO, no small game. I have no idea how they did that. Ruined my night ha
---
I dont even use the charms lol
---
Side note: you can stop saying “calm down” I was under the impression we were having a healthy debate. If you’re feeling personally attacked I’m sorry you took our conversation the wrong way. I’ll do my best not to make you feel insulted or attacked.

God, Finn Wolfhard looks like such a lesbian.

The day BBQ is nerfed is the day I become a survivor main.

WAIT SHOULD I STOP CLEANSING OR NOT??
---
Wraith cube ? What am i missing out on ?
---
It's actually a solid strategy if the survivors are being overly cocky and altruistic. They like "hey fam, we can totally save you, we're a TEAM!" And ignore gens and just impale themselves on your M1.
---
Does anyone else think ruin is OP ?
---
DONT STOP IT MIGHT BE RUIN ACTUALLY
---
Jesus, what's wrong with her mouth?

I love baiting their frenzy with SB at the start of a match acting like I don’t know they are behind me. Really wastes their time 😂
---
We weren't even discussing that? 
---
I already know that, and it just proves that the devs don't even play their own goddamn game. Doc needs a buff, not a nerf.
---
Alchemist for survivor maybe? I mean in his animated short he look like he was fighting against the entity?
---
Survivor addon’s are not that impactful as killer’s
---
Main protagonist of JoJo Golden Wind named Giorno Giovanna got power named Gold Experience Requiem in the end of the story. This power allows him to nullify any action or result, which allowed him to lock his mortal enemy in never ending cycle, where he experiences his different deaths. Forever. 
---
Just like in DbD survivors die for (almost) eternity in different situations
---
Ghostface is countered by looking at him, spirit is countered by thinking ahead, nurse is countered by running at her when she charges tele and far away when shes stunned, billy is countered by looping (why would yoh even say billy he is weak af), huntress is countered by high walls (anything that isn't farm, swamp, wrecker's), wraith is countered by looking behind you, Hag is countered by looking where your going and sneaking. I'm arguing Doctor is a balanced killer, and fun to play against because he doesn't follow the same mold as other killers. You can't just simply safe loop him for 5 gens like you can to other killers. The only killers who can't be sage looped are teleport killers and even then their counters are simple. For Doctor takes timing, and is played agaisnt differently. Thats why BHVR is going to NERF him because he doesn't follow that same mold. I am speaking from a red rank perspective, don't turn this into "my rank is higher than your rank so i'm right". Literally the stuff I am talking about is seen in streams with the top dvd players.
---
It's not my fault that the majority of **boosted survivors** can't play a map differently than Macmillan Estate. I'm tired of repeating myself. I play on it fine because I learned the map, which it also spawns the same 90% of the time so - no its not a "confusing layout". Also this is about Lery's not Hawkins if you forget I was using Hawkins as an example.
---
You have talked yourself into a rut.
---
First time?
---
OH MY GOD!!!!
---
if it glows it goes
---
I’m gonna come to wherever you’re from and punt it because if it *glows it goes*
---
This is actually super dope though, nice work!
---
That's what I have been saying.
---
 You're just a toxic fanboy that needs to smear your shit all over a perfectly good comment hyping about a  dbd killer that could work.
---
Teleportation, invisibility, a silent hill world like freddy's dream world. Pyramid head materializing out of nowhere is a lot for the dev's to work with.  He can swing his sword just as fast as any other killer. 
---
 Did you even see the scene, or play anything other than silent hill 2?  
---
And his reach compensates for any slow movements.  It's also obvious getting hit by the sword would be a one shot with a cool down (stopping when swinging).
---
This whole thing started when you said he doesn't swing his sword fast.  Well he does.  That's the end of that.  He swings his sword fast in some of the games also.  Unimaginative toxic People like you are the reason we can't have nice things.
---
Chuckled at the great storytelling, 10/10 would read again.
---
Huh, that’s where my ruin went, thought it got destroyed in the first 5 seconds as usual
---
I, a survivor main, learned the error of my ways and have seen the light, the truth. Survivors are way more toxic than killers
---
Thats sick.  I wanted to build a totem for a Halloween decoration.
---
its also based on the time of day, the later it is the longer survivor queues get, but the shorter killer queues get
---
Warming your hands up over the candles its cold in the Trials.
---
i’ll beat you up meet me behind the school
---
I’m sorry your not that good at the game. I prefer to have to use skill and actually learn how to play to succeed. To each their own I guess. Good luck with ur games.
---
i mean not really, they can escape the matches
---
Because Oni does still have advantages, there's no denying it. You can accomplish stuff with his Demon Dash that you physically cannot do with Hillbilly no matter what you use on him.
---
When they buffed wraith it was called the wraith cube.
---
Problem is I'm never going to learn from my noobiness because I keep getting away with it somehow lol
---
Well I have never met Spirit the likes of you ever. It has gotten so worse that once I get found against spirit, I just give up.
---
It is near impossible to lose a spirit who is barely efficient because of her power set and the way they tunnel I stand no chance because I do not use DS.
---
The first time I played Myers was also due to the splinter and I'm half convinced that I was playing against bots in that match to encourage me to buy the Halloween DLC. I've never seen so many ridiculous plays from survivors in any match. Easiest 4k and Merciless of my life lol.
---
Well yes, but this doesn't mean they aren't going to die next time. For them escaping means nothing, they still end up near the campfire, only to wake up in the next trial and so on.
---
Blurred the name as requested by my friendo
---
personally i agree, i really dislike any aura reading abilities on either side, like you said it takes all the fun out of tracking and finding, and as a survivor it takes all the fun out of "wheres the killer" jump scares usually
---
Had someone tell me to uninstall before the match was over. How can you die before me, and still be salty at me those people are seriously cancer.
---
No, I haven't, your criticisms are dumb. Doctor is countered by looping too, because he can't reliably stop loops always. His power is kinda bad tbh. 
---
GF can be countered by looking at him is a fantastically stupid argument. It isn't that simple, especially when he is sneaking around the map and you're doing a gen near a wall. He is easily the best stealth killer, and the fact that you say that means you don't know how the killer works.
---
You don't counter a good Nurse. You just die. You can't reliably juke a good Nurse. 
---
Yes, Billy can be looped which is why he isn't S tier. But you're dead if he catches you in the open, and has very high mobility. He is much, much better than Doctor.
---
Huntress is A tier. She has bad maps. Still better than Doc. Same with Hag. She has tremendous map control, but is 110 and is countered by flashlights. But she also shuts down loops easily and more reliably than Doc.
---
Wraith is same as GF but not as strong. He has high mobility and can catch you out of position. You're not always checking every angle, and especially with good add-ons, Wraith is quite solid. Still better than Doc, who has shit map pressure and whose power is off limited use in chases.
---
Doc's issue is that because his map pressure is ass, and his power is inconsistent, you can throw pallets early and he can't catch a good looper. He is objectively weaker than any of the killers I listed above. I know they will nerf him, which is bad, because he needs a bit of a buff.
---
I'm red rank too. R1, literally no high lvl streamer (Otz , true, Scott Jund, Umbra, Tofu, etc) will say Doc is better than GF, or Billy, or Spirit. 0. Donut. You are wrong, and you're confident in your wrongness.
---
If you count it up, that’s 9 survivors who were sandbagged.
---
9.
---
Not a single one of them survived as a direct result of my focus on that rift challenge.
---
Thank you kind sir, they've improved vastly over the years!
---
Lol *tries to get up using a pallet* "Help! I've fallen and I can't get up!" Cue commercial for Life Alert.

My bad, I dont use reddit and dont know how notifications work? I just wanted to give people a chance to see how the dwelfs were reacting to everything.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ei6o2g/dead_by_daylight_connection_issues_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I play both survivor and killer and I do agree that farming is very dull and boring, farming being letting you do generators smacking the killer with pallets, I normally just point at a hook until the killer kills me. When I choose to drop someone on hatch, I consider three things, were they toxic? Did they have bad/throwing teammates? Were they good? If no, yes, yes, I’ll probably give them hatch. 
---
I think a main contributor to farming is the Archive challenges, every time I’ve had a farming killer recently it’s been a trapper who wanted us to step in his traps more than anything else, probably trying to complete the hungry jaws mission.

People are actually just afk sometimes, queue times on killer are tremendously long, some people might go grab some food and drinks or do something quick while they wait for a lobby. Not much to do there, finish the gens and get out of there.

Interesting idea, I had thought discord was PC players only. Thanks for the advice.
---
I genuinely loled at this response. Thank you.
---
Don't worry, I understand. As a survivor I hate going against spirit. But I also get tunneled by ghost face a lot, and I don't like bubbas and trappers 😂 my husband asked me if there was any killer I LIKED going up against. 
---
The answer for me is no, just ones I tolerate 😂😂
---
But going against spirits are tricky. Urban evasion is good tho, no scratch marks and you can stay low 😊
---
My mistake. Just so used to hearing whining. Sry. Have good killings :D
---
What's wrong with her entire face, yikes she works worse than me

Welp, so much for the healthy debate. Looks like someone’s got some super salt over a discussion of differing opinions.

Save up blood points before prestiging, as your character will be prestige 1 lvl 1, they will have nothing except that characters reachable perks, you will get a bloody cosmetic, and a slightly higher chance of getting higher value items in your blood web. 
---
To prestige click and hold on the centre point of your blood web, after you hold it for a second a little confirmation window will pop up and you can choose yes or no.

What about as the second to last person on hook so the other person has a chance to get hatch?
---
PainReliever is a phenomenal YouTube channel, with critiques on gameplay submitted from fans, tutorials on how to run loops as killer, how to loop as survivor, etc. So much stuff, great quality videos, no click bait or any other shenanigans.
---
It's the most benign form of shit talking one could do in a video game. If someone chooses to interpret it at such an unnecessary level of frustration that's on them.  
---
If they shit talk in chat afterwards, that frustrates me. But implying that survivors should get each other killed if one of them teabags is just crazy. 
---
And yeah, there's a team of 4. It's an asymmetrical game, so that speaks nothing to balance. It's pretty easy to get 4ks, so idk why your comment is making it sound like you're playing the most unfair game in the world.
---
How do I get better at chases? Any tips? (Console)
---
I try to look behind me but run into trees and stuff. I can’t seem to last very long without a lot of luck (good pallets, killer makes mistakes, etc)
---
They patched it out, well at least I think, it was never a hard tech to do and now it is all of a sudden.
---
I am a trapper main and I never ever tunnel even if I am close to the hook unless its obvious unsafe unhook by cocky SWF.
---
I play and like to go against Ghostfaces, one odd cases in ten or dozen aside they are mostly there having fun. 
---
And tbh half of my games against spirit go like I spawn near her, she luckily phases to my hiding location. I get down in next 30 seconds. Next 2 minutes or less are spend on hooks multiple times and then dying. 
---
Even if my teammates try to block, she will wade through to hit me. I am seriously done with how poor sportsman spirit these spirit mains have, and no offence but spirit needs least amount of skill to play and that is why most bullish players pick her.
---
Because of her the game has a "play at your own risk" at the start of every match when you play her
---
Nice trailer!
---
When did the clown get tats?
---
but diavolo dies every time, he dies relatively quickly each time. DBD is more of a groundhog day then GER
---
These memes are cringe
---
No, it's not.
---
I mainly use it just to get laughs out of the killer looking for me when I already crawled halfway across the map
---
I'm a survivor main, but I will occasionally play killer for things like the tome or to do my dailies, I have been called a tunneler and camper for the dumbest things.  
---
* Example 1: Hook a survivor, go and hunt down a different survivor and hook them during which time the first survivor was unhooked.  I saw the original survivor again shortly after and hooked him again - apparently I was tunneling. 
---
* Example 2: Hook a survivor, go about my business, that survivor was unhooked and as I'm making my way back I see him jump in a locker in front of me.  Apparently I was camping.
---
But as it is, camping is fine - proxy camping, face camping, whatever. If you're camping then the other survivors are free to do whatever else - destroy totems, do gens, etc.
---
Is it one of the blind duration addons? I use the green one to increase the time i have to crouch away from a pallet when i blind the killer, hope i'm not using a bugged addon.
---
what? I’m new too and my killer queues are about 1-2 minutes. NA how bout you?
---
Lol! 
---
Meg: I am a god you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by---

---
Nah
---
Or killer mains, I got self care and empathy and haven't leveled Claudette. Although that was back when shards were a "use it or lose it" currency before the cosmetic update so people are probably less likely to "waste" the shards now, but it is still like a million bp to unlock teachables from level one.
---
Let's level tbe playing field,  shall we?  Since you seem to be leaving out a few things. Infinite loops, 8 second self care, BT for both rescuer and hooked, old gen times, old BNP, old gen regression, exhaustion recovering while running, old DS, double window killer shack, wake up bug, instant heals, and old heal times. 
---
But yeah. Poor survivors. So many killer sided changes. Its not like survivors were literally the power role of the game and controlled the pace of every match they were in. I hate when newer people swoop in and try to act like survivor nerfs weren't warranted. Fuck off.
---
windows store and steam only (i believe that includes xbox game pass users but not positive)
---
Thanks for the response! So I was thinking if it activates in 3 seconds, wouldn't you be able to head to a locker near a hook as the killer is picking someone up? If you know the basement is close he probably will take them there
---
Not what I'm saying, I'm saying if someone DCs early its impossible to get adept killer. If your a survivor and your teammate DCs its harder to win. In not saying keep points on DC I'm talking about a boost for people who stay until the end.

How to not run into stuff all the time on the new map?
---
Personally I'm against face camping, I like to give survivors a chance of escape (unless what I've mentioned happens) and I hate it when it happens to me, especially on first hook, but hell, if my team do gens and cleanse lit totems in the meantime I don't mind, it usually aids survivors more than harm them if they're competent.
---
NA on PC
---
Are you illiterate? I never said they did.
---
Without the ranking system wouldn't you be more likely to run into players that are too hard for you to go up against? The whole point of this system is so that Survivors and Killers are of similar skills when put together to avoid people who are less skilled going up against people who know exactly what they're doing. Without a ranking system it'd be a complete mess with would-be red ranks mixed in with new players and green Killers. The ranking system is seriously flawed right now but at least half of the time it results in fair matchmaking. What's your Survivor rank? If you're going up against Killers on or edging on rank 1 a lot either you're roughly rank 1 - 6 or just a victim of the matchmaking flaws. I went up against a rank 20 Killer earlier today... as a rank 4 solo Survivor. SWF didn't put me against a rank 20 Killer but I felt bad for them.
---
If you have Quick &amp; Quiet and he doesn‘t see you it could work, but I‘ve rarely seen a Killer carrying someone going by a locker close enough to be Head On stunned. As I‘ve said your best bet is having the Killer pick up a Survivor in front of a locker.
---
Just stay in the locker till the hook aura goes away  :)
---
It will gather enough willpower to bring itself into existence. Use the currency now, or we'll all be covered in Entity splooge.

Thanks, I actually didn't even know that's how it worked lol

That could literally pass off as a killer lol

thanks OP
---
No offense taken. I am sorry you face such douchebag spirits. And for the record, trappers are the most fascinating and annoying killers bc if used correctly, they can be such efficient killers. It's a love hate on my end, but mostly in awe by their simplicity 😋
---
Yeah same for me.
---
pretty job so far
---
Never said nerfed, they should be reworked. Doc is outdated and Lery's is a bad map.
---
I find your criticism flawed, that's why I'm responding to it. But if you don't feel like talking about it anymore that's fine, we can have different opinions.
---
No but I could get behind a perk that slightly increased your odds to KOBE if all of your teammates are like 32 meters or more away from you. It would have to be low though so like 1% chance to unhook yourself for each teammate further then 40/32/24 meters from you.
---
Have to be low because of Slippery Meat, luck offerings and Ace perk. 
---
Wouldnt use it myself but that's like 80% of the perks anyway.
---
I'd run if I were you
---
I can see some of the meme you made in it, but I could just crop it if I use it.
---
It goes.

Lol same here, I thought I was just doing a grab wrong. Feels like i'm just giving the survivors a loving drive-by massage so they don't get too stressed.
---
Respect the 4% 😭😭😭
---
1. What other killer perks besides Moris will not show up in the preloading screen? And sometimes the survivor perks don't show up. Which I believe is when it's canceled out by another. What's an example of that?
---
2. Play on Switch. Camera sensitivity. Does 100% mean the camera will spin as fast as possible, and the opposite if at 0%? Can anyone recommend a good setting?

Thats pretty awesome but dont they have 3 skulls?

* Your submission only consists of a URL. This impairs our ablity to enforce blacklists and is better suited as a link submission.
---
You are absolutely spot on about trappers. This is why I like to play Evan, because it makes DBD a chess like game where you are hunting with strategy.
---
Evan has its shortcomings for being outdate and need certain overhauls but even with current status, he can be really lethal. And also, see how much spirits and trappers' power differ. 
---
On one hand you have to guess if she is phasing or just simply standing, waiting for you to give up on the impasse you created. And on the other trapper can be spotted laying traps so easily with a safe vantage point.
---
After each match, check out the emblems page (the one with the medals and the pips). Hover over each one and see what your progress looks like, and try to associate it with what you did that match. If you have a red emblem, try to keep doing what you did. If you have a silver or bronze, look for ways to get better in that specific area.
---
For me, I'm a gen-jockey and I love being chased, so I often get my points in those areas very easily. I don't do as well in altruism, because I usually stay on a gen instead of going for the unhook or healing someone.
---
At your level, if you're doing a couple gens, getting a couple unhooks, a heal or two, and getting chased by the killer for a bit, you should slowly start to level up. It's difficult if you get camped, but if you're rank 16, the game won't let you lose pips (derank).
---
If you find you're getting tunneled a lot, your best bet is to try not to be found for a while. I was often the first one found when I started playing the game, and even my friends noticed that I was always getting caught right away.
---
Try not working on a gen right away, go look for a totem instead. Cleansing it will get you boldness points and help you level up. It'll also give you a chance to look around for the killer to see who it is.
---
Walk at the start of the game, don't run. Killers will be looking for any sign of survivors at the start of the game. Don't give them a reason to come after you.
---
Don't work on a gen with another teammate. If you are by yourself, the killer is less likely to want to come after you. It's more important for them to find two or three survivors on a gen, because it takes them all off the objective.
---
Consider running perks like Spine Chill or Kindred. Both perks are free and can be unlocked in every survivor's bloodweb. Spine Chill will give you a heads up when a killer is looking in your direction. It gives you the time to sneak away, or a head start if you need to run. Kindred will help both you and your teammates with getting unhooks, and it will give you a better idea of where the killer is. Hopefully it'll also help you get off the hook.
---
A perk like Bond (Dwight) will help you see where the killer is as well, because you'll see if a teammate is being chased. Aura reading perks can be extremely helpful at all skill levels.
---
As you level up, you'll find fewer and fewer campers, because that strategy doesn't work as well as the survivors get better.
---
Hopefully some of this stuff has been helpful. If you have any questions, just ask!
---
It does thankfully.
---
a true hex destroyer
---
Rank 1 so without a ranking system like 99% of the time i would be better than the killer
---
I'm not a fan of it either, and only the most toxic of survivors are ever the recipient of face camping (e.g. The kind that click their flashlight and get mad when you DON'T stop everything to chase them - you wanted my attention, you have it), I'm not even a fan of proxy camping, but if I hook someone and whispers says there's someone near by I'm looking. 
---
That's why I like killers like Freddy so I can bounce around

Born in 1881 in Norway, immigrated to the U.S., widowed twice. Seduced men into the proposition of an arranged marriage to her home where she killed, dismembered, and fed them to her pigs. Went missing in 1908 after burning down her house, killing her four children, while planting the headless body of an unknown woman with them to throw investigators off her trail
---
I love head on. Basement locker saves are hit and miss due to distance, but it’s fairly reliable. Especially against a Trapper who puts a trap at bottom of stairs, that’s a free save. Mainly you just need to learn when to jump out because most of the time the killer is within range for only a second. 
---
I’m a solo player and in lobby I always let them know I got head on and if they see me go into a locker near them while downed to crawl to it. It’s amazing how many times head on saves ass. 
---
The distance is about twice as far as the doors reach, and also works if killer is to the side, like if they are checking the locker next to yours. It used to work behind the locker too but I dunno if they removed that or not, I can’t seem to get saves that way anymore. 
---
Last night in the basement I managed to locker save a dude and while killer was stunned I unhooked another dude who was already hooked, took a hit for him and all 3 of us escaped. It was so beautiful. The killer even congratulated us on that crazy escape. Head on makes for some of the best games ever lol. I love it! (I’m still excited about that save if you can’t tell haha)
---
The only snoot that deserves a boop is The Pig's. That said Ghostface's teabagging is awesome. It's funny when you see your teammates and a Ghostface having a teabag standoff against each other. It doesn't look obnoxious when both sides are doing it to each other.
---
It is a good meme. Just next time use colours that aren't pain to read.

Bruh, move on. You clearly can’t have a health conversation without as you would say. “being a toxic fanboy” over DbD.  I do recall you were the first person to claim they’ve ‘seen more Pyramid Head’ than me’. Again, you were also the one name calling and getting clearly very emotional over the subject.
---
It’s fine to be a fanboy, but maybe stop with the shitty attitude and the toxicity. There’s a lot of negative in the world, You don’t need to stress yourself out more. You’re wrong, Move on with you’re life.
---
Maybe, yet it is still very similar in concept. Both Diavolo and survivors aren't going to die completely
---
I usually play Trapper so I'll place traps near where I'd sneak if I was a survivor and sometimes they works, lately I've rediscovered my love for Legion and I usually just dash off and see someone panic in the meantime
---
So the new meta becomes to hide for 10 minutes and then pop the gates?
---
So people don' just play the game? That's so weird. If you get some shitty teammates, which happens often becasue I am one since I just started playing, its part of it. Finish the game as it is meant to be played and move on.
---
Maybe they need to add a report option to the game to report the "toxic" people you speak of?
---
I'd rather just disable being able to wiggle off completely, except if you have Deliverance active. Keep arm flailing for signaling and rework Luck/Slippery Meat.
---
It's more work but it would be healthier for the game
---
Guilty as charged. Why do we excessively moan while destroying a totem?

I fixed some white spots when zoomed in and cropped it

---
Thank you so much this is VERY helpful!! and makes a lot of sense!! 
---
Some of the stuff you don't really think about can hurt you in the game so this is awesome!! THANK YOU!!
---
I always upvote and congratulate a great killer.
---
4Gamers where u at
---
Plague especially.
---
That's an entirely internal issue that can be fixed by the dev's behind the scenes, the offering change would be supplemental at best and would still pose an unfair mechanic
---
Toss a hatchet to your survivor
---
I am mostly a survivor who plays a couple killers games for dailies or Archive challenges. I don't actually have the desire to kill anyone. I will try to get two hooks on everyone and chase them around so they feel like they're going to die, but I'm probably not going to give anyone a 3rd hook unless they BMed me.
---
I try to make the game as fun as possible, cause I'm not a big fan of farming either.
---
It’s actually trapper mainly probably because he’s the icon of the game
---
If you use it like lithe, you waste time in the vault animation, you can't use it like dead hard bc you're already in a chase, thus you already wasted it, you waste time on the stagger trying to force it to be BL. It's a great perk for beginners but any patient killer will still get you, whereas dead hard literally gets you a free hit.
---
Fuck you for doing this
---
No worries mate.
---
Good luck in the future  :)
---
I could be wrong, so please point it out if I am, but I don't think that is related in any way to the post.
---
Was there even more than 10 seconds of mori spam?
---
Literally every killer knows a survivor doing that has sprint burst, you wasted your own time not the killer's bc you couldve been long gone
---
Sure sure... Tunneling killers get 4ks all the time. Preventing one by rage quitting isn't viable.
---
You started this, not me.  You started with the shitty attitude, and toxicity.  You've been the negative naysayer shitting on something with false information just for the sake of shitting on it.  
---
You're comments clearly show this.
---
And you still can't admit you're wrong.
---
Claudette on that on the Yamoka Estate is the lovechild of The Wraith clocked and Ghostface. God help you if you're up against four of them and they're using any combination of Urban Evasion, Iron Will, and Sprint Burst.
---
Yes but it was very awkward and not well timed so I didn't include it. Btw I love your stuff &lt;3
---
Hey don’t u compare my Kate to this clown
---
I would just buff luck
---
1. When equipping an offering in your loadout, whether survivor or killer, if one of the bulletpoints under the description says secret, then it will not be shown in the losing screen
---
2. I’d probably recommend a sensitivity of 70% that way your able to quickly look behind you while still keeping control of your camera
---
Hehe
---
Nice that sounds epic!
---
Thank you! I'd trim this more if you don't want to literally have evidence of mori spam someone could send to BHVR, shit's bannable.
---
Tbh flashlights even in a premade are not worth bringing a mori, they can blind you but you can bait them, 2+ toolboxes or keys on a premade though..
---
Technically speaking, matchmaking shouldn't be putting a rank 13 with a rank 8, and then in addition it should be so easy for Survivor to rank to 8, and still not be able to beat a rank 13 killer.
---
Yea but not every killer expects using sprint burst mid chase. I do run in advance and not as soon as they get there
---
It’s absolutely mind boggling how someone can have such a strong cognitive dissonance to their own behavior that they claim the other completely calm person is the crazy one...
---
You replied to me, dude. Not the other way around. The only one freaking out here is you. 
---
Take a deep breath. 
---
And walk away.
---
Isn't it bannable if you do it for an extended period of time cause it is considered taking the game hostage? I did it for like 20s max for footage so I believe I should be fine.
---
I'm not sure about the treshold of it being bannable or not, just know mori spam is a thing that can be actually reported.
---
thats haunted dont cleanse it
---
It was super fun! :)
---
That’s pretty sick ngl

When we were loading up, I said it would be so perfect if we had a santa clown killer
---
Right?? we wanted to get one so badly. Maybe we will one day. We will keep trying :)
---
But isn't that the reason it's considered toxic in the first place?
---
My gf played DBD for the first time last night as a Kiler. She thought the survivors were eating the totem...it make me laugh so hard bc it kinda looks like that haha.

I'm sorry you have to put up with that. As a survivor, I accept my fate of the basement.
---
I rank up for the sole purpose of being paired with people who know how to play properly.

I don't want to play with brand new players.
---
Ruin is better.
---
Try to adjust your camera sensitivity to something a bit higher so you have more freedom in switching from look in front of you and behind you quickly
---
Indeed it is
---
You replied to me dude.  You replied to me originally. Wow. 
---
 I'm not freaking out, I'm calling your bullshit.  You're not crazy.  You're a shit starter.  
---
And you still can't admit you're wrong.  I'm not angry.  I'm just not going to let you get away with your lies.  
---
That's it.  He swings his sword lightning fast in silent hill 2 cut scene, and the movie.  Get over it.
---
The secret survivor offerings either allow you to start with another survivor (or survivors), or as far away from the killer as possible.
---
The only killer offerings aside from moris that are hidden are the ones that separate all survivors at the start of the match, or the ones that allow you to play one game as a licensed killer (Myers, Pig, Freddy, Leatherface), but I'm not sure they are included in the Switch version.

You’re right I replied to you, I was trying to reply to the thread as a whole and apparently clicked the wrong place. This is me admitting I made a mistake. But you’re still the one freaking out lol

actually its devour hope, hurry up and cleanse it because they already have 4 tokens

Damit oofmyass, not again!

*Runs the killer around for the whole duration* You're lucky I was injured and had the vault speed build on!
---
And shake on the floor like you have withdrawal
---
Its covered in gorilla glue and it hurts to pull your fingers off
---
Or perhaps there is something ritualistic that must be done while cleansing and simply kicking it would send bones and candles everywhere but the hex would still be persistent. Maybe survivors have figured this out and know they need to commit to actually cleansing it the way the entity desires -- just like survivors don't really "repair" generators, just fiddle with them in a way that satisfies the entity.
---
Either way, we are all clearly putting a lot more thought into this than the devs ever did.
---
i really want Deliverance i have most perks on my meg i just need some teachable perks but i really dont care about killer perks
---
Thank you you too!!

It wasn't intentionally introduced as a feature. It was removed because it was a bug.

By contrast at green/purple ranks I have SWF groups popping off three gens with Ruin still up while I'm in the first chase.
---
Wait I'm confused. I keep hearing about long wait times for killers and survivors.
---
Is it due to rank? Platform? Time? Region?
---
The entity can’t resist thiccness 
---
New Perk: Dummy thicc booty
---
Your dummy thicc bootah arouses the entity, literally arouse ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Gain a haste status effect every time the killer or survivor looks at the thing your mama gave you.
---
I’ve played very immersed before, what I ran was spine chill, watch this: https://youtu.be/bNO4gPJ8WuY underrated perk better than promotion as they is no cool down, used to use premonition tried spine chill and realized it was way better. Lightweight, your scratch marks disappear three seconds quicker at tier 3, doesn’t sound like much, but when a killer is trying to track you this makes it much more difficult to do. Urban evasion is really good for not being detected while also being really close to the killer, up to you if you run it though, sometimes I didnt sometimes I didn’t. Iron Will: phenomenal perk, you make no extra noise when injured, higher rank killers will use audio to find you, with iron will it is much tougher. Quick and quiet is good while being chased, combines with iron will and light weight pretty well. Bond: Being able to see your fellow survivors might not seem to help you be stealthy, but it sure can help you make better decisions, when you are running the killer around, you can make sure you don’t run into a gen your teammates are doing, you can see where someone is going when being chased all sorts of useful stuff.
---
If you really wanna get that immersed stealth build, watch a lot of PainReliever on YouTube. He’s also the one who made the spine hill vid I linked above, he’s got videos about some of these other perks too.
---
Don’t be sorry ;)
---
So really you're just complaining that you're going up against killers that are around your skill level? Seriously?
---
Can't really blink either. Lery's was always unpleasant for Nurse and now its a lose lose. Do you bloodlust and waste time or panic blink and lose them entirely?
---
These are awesome. I would def buy some

Same here. Obviously you want me to chase you for a reason.
---
This is hilarious 😂
---
Playing killer sometimes feels like your trying to babysit 4 obnoxious kids 😂
---
Pig mains can't help themselves I guess.
---
Of course it isn't viable. My point wasn't that they **don't** get 4ks, my point was they don't **deserve** to get 4ks. You act surprised, like I quit out of anger rather than letting the Meg escape. If I quit out of anger, why would I waste my time making this post and arguing with numerous people? 
---
There's no point.
---
That’s fucked up. DCing is one thing, but messaging you? Geez
---
Imagine making tunneling an offense when Object of Obsession exists.
---
Are you guys ever going to implement a prestige of some sort after the third? Or will there only ever be three prestige’s to a survivor/killer? (Please note I’m not talking about legacy, but simply something past the prestige three bloody clothing)
---
Sure thanks for the tip !
---
That is because all the rank 20 survivors are playing againts red ranks
---
I use Lucidsound's LS35X. They are really nice. :)
---
Main reason I hate the perk. 60 seconds of "does she got DS or not".
---
You mean Oikers...
---
Whatever that is
---
No problem
---
Because you're rank 19 killer.
---
Once you hit yellows your queue time should drop immensely, except for the dead hours.
---
Have a great day.
---
Rank
---
2 killers
---
8 survivors
---
A lot of hooks
---
For teams,two killer and two survivor. ( One killer team has to go for their four survivors)
---
Blue goes for blue, red goes for red.
---
The way to tell between blue v.s. red would be their clothes or their aura.
---
10 gens, 4 red, 4 blue, two neutral (whoever works on the gen for the longest gets it) 
---
Expanded map.
---
Killer win conditions: The killer with more kills,hits and stuff like that wins
---
Survivor team win conditions: Pallets, Gens, stuff like that wins.
---
There would be one killer team that one and one survivor team that one, and a grand winner. The grand winner would depend on if people died or escaped.
---
Thats my idea
---
Idk man it seems like I get urban evasion clauds who are afraid of a heartbeat, and crouch around the map look long for Ruin.
---
He is legally Ghost Face but only because the mask which devs got license to(because mask license and movie license are different) is named Ghost Face
---
Yeah I finished my last couple challenges last night and was three rift shards from 70. RIP
---
Use Scroll down wheel
---
Yeah, the problem is Pyramid is too slow in large open space games like DbD. He’s dangerous in the SH  games because you’re stuck in a small space and he has a big ass sword but you’d have to make far too many changes to the character to make him fit in a game like DbD and at that point you might as well just make a new monster with a big sword because it’ll have been changed too much to really be a “pyramid head” character. It would be super rad if his mori decapitated you or cut you in half. But I just don’t see how you can logically but a canonically slow monster in  such a big open space and expect him to be able to keep up with the survivors runnin around.
---
Didn't 12 AM today pass already?

"Being an utterly obnoxious crack head".

---
Use a macro. You'll thank me now.
---
You shouldn't have to select them at all. Other battle pass systems don't have this clunky shit. They give you a lost of challenges that you can complete at your leisure. This just has extra steps.
---
I;m thinking about thos Bones
---
no the killer is capitalism
---
you mean capitalism?
---
Amazing quality!
---
You are clearly in violation of Survivor's Rule Book, section 187, subsection 12, case B.
---
When hooking survivor you are expected to immideatly depart towards the corner that is furthest from the hook used, situate yourself facing it and count to 100 before resuming the game. In case if hook is located in the middle of map and multiple corner choices are available, choice of corner is behind the killer, with exception of the corners that might have survivors enroute from that general direction.
---
Yeah I ran no mither, against fucking Oni. He found me in 2 seconds thanks to the blood and just kept finding me every time. It was ridiculous. I did get the challenge done at least, and my friends escaped but it was rough.
---
Where’s the image of when you miss it and your SWF laughs at you
---
Hey fellow console player! I'm still pretty new but something that helped me extend my chases was reading what the killer does at pallets ( for example does he swing through pallets aka respecting pallets or did he stop and pause and wait for it to drop). I quickly started mind gaming them based on what they would do like if he swings through pallets I kept running the loop and sometimes he'd miss cause he swung to early hoping to hit me through the pallet. Another thing I do is play red light green light with him if he stopped anticipating the dropped pallet so i would pause and act like I was gonna drop it (super risky) and keep going with the loop. Sorry Im not great at explaining but this is something that helped me alot along with watching well known survivors like noob3 or monto. (not sure if they are the best or not)
---
*queue Seinfeld bass theme*
---
according to a poster above you only need to have the perk, you don't need to be injured. I can't test this cause I've already done it, I did no mither myself. Just pray you don't get Oni.
---
can we tell this to the freddy that tunneled me for blinding him at shack window
---
We don’t talk about that
---
There we go!
---
Speak for yourself. I think Freddy is fun as heck. Part of that comes from how strong he is, but the teleport ability is extremely enjoyable. Using it to fake out survivors who then come running into your arms when you cancel the port is a delight.
---
It’s so strange. On console, at least Xbox, it’s reversed. I can take 5-7 minutes for a Survivor game, but Killer is less than 30 seconds
---
Her butt claps are alerting the nations
---
Eh, it's no Reverse chainsaw into Quentin hiding in a corner
---
There’s a subreddit for this
---
But you can't hear spine chill, most of the time I don't even know when it goes off. Premonition gives you an auditory warning.
---
If somebody clearly farms me off the hook I just teabag toward them. A lot of times I get rehooked and killed, which would happen anyhow, but once in a while the killer takes the cue, downs the other survivor, let's me farm them to death, and continue with the game as normal -- totally fucking worth it every time.
---
I personally consider that a cheap tactic, so I'll pass.
---
This is too good xD
---
I get so tired of hearing this 😂😂😂
---
Can we get more of these for the rest of the killers? They’re hilarious!
---
Yeah I use true's build
---
As a killer main, SWFs in Discord is what puts a lot of us into the mood to pull that shit in the first place.
---
This is the sound I make when I get stunned by my third pallet in a row
---
This is hilarious! I'm gonna try it! LOL!
---
Honestly same
---
Fun Fact: they can still pick it up
---
Watch the short again. He doesn't win the fight.
---
I used to main survivor and doing that has helped me at killer , thanks man

Bake him away toys

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ei7smm/the_haunting_of_ghost_meg_floating_carried_person/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Of course nea stays behind to tbag
---
It’s because survivors and killers see different things due to Desync.  For killer, it seems like we can’t even hit you even though you just started the vault, but as survivor, you get hit more than 3 steps away from the window.
---
In reality, both times were probably very close calls, but neither player sees what the server is actually seeing.

ever heard of the good old 99% exhaustion?

Great job, OP!

Kylee! thats a face i have not seen in a while

Huh? How? I'm on XBOX as well, and you can't even see who the killer is until **after** you die or escape.

I honestly hate doctor because of his dumb laugh

Still a newbie, so, yes
---
Same, I just combo'd Dark Sense and Bond. Easy peasy.
---
That does help but speed boost isn't invincibility
---
Ha ha yup
---
Oni also does... Lol
---
Obviously no, this is Survivor's rulebook after all. It is not meant to be available for killers.
---
Where is the logic? There is never any logic, as once said to me "Fuck you for being a killer main"
---
When you tunnel all 4 survivors at the same time
---
&gt;it is making playing killer (which was obnoxious already) even worse than it was before
---
Why do people keep playing killer if they find it to be obnoxious? Just stop lmao, there are other games. Either you are stupid to voluntarily continue doing something you do not enjoy, or you are dishonest about whether you actually enjoy it.
---
As for grabs, what you are experiencing is that as opposed to hits, for grabs latency is not purely in the killer's favour any longer on dedicated servers. If the survivor on their screen let go of the interaction before you grabbed them, you will not get the grab even though on your screen you may have. This is because on your screen as the killer the survivor is actually in the past, by however much latency there is between you and them. When you hit a survivor, you benefit from a latency advantage and register a hit on them in the past, even though their actual position on their screen (and on the server) at that time would not allow for you to land that hit. The killer is the sole authority on hits, and this creates a lot of ridiculous scenarios for survivors. The killer is however not the authority on grabs anymore. In the past where the killer was the authority on everything, there were ridiculous grabs as well, where the survivor had long let go of the interaction but still ended up on the killer's shoulder; now whether the killer gets the grab depends on the survivor player's reaction time and the latency of both clients to the server, the client with less latency being favoured, since the server rules on whether a grab happens.
---
So if you don't get the grab, the survivor reacted in time and you do not deserve the grab, and/or they have a lower-latency connection to the server than you and that's just the unfortunate reality of online multiplayer gaming and you drew the shorter (or in this case: longer) stick.
---
Nope. Press home button. Go to friends. Go to Recently Played. And you'll see the there are 4 people that say "last played with 1 minutes ago" or something like that. Then just match up the names to people in lobby and the one that doesn't match up is ur killer ;)
---
More like an anti-cramp tactic, but okay. You keep with them impressive button mashing pro-gamer skills!

Hmmm.

I appreciate your hard work yet all I want to do is dismantle that bad boy.
---
Yeah I had many people DC just so I don’t get the challenge and I played fair. After 9 games I gave up and it’s the only challenge left. When I see killers going for the 4 basement hook challenge and they play fair I just let them have it. But if you’re an insidious leather face and who tricks survivor into believing you’re friendly then I’ll run to the edge and make sure you don’t get it.
---
EVERYONE but me abandoned after this LOL.  I was like welp, where's the hatch!

Shit, even if it's not glowing. Less to worry about if he has noed

Literally no where in my post did I comment on the frequency of this scenario.  Simply broke down the inherent balancing issue with the concept.
---
Nice!!!!!!!!!!!
---
HAHA!
---
it will
---
I actually tend to agree... Making it a list style where progress could be gained across multiple challenges at a time over a span of multiple games would make the progress more fluid and make the games more natural than in its current state where someone is trying for stuns and wastes all the pallets while another wastes time searching or fighting over chests.
---
The face is super creepy. My wife saw it and said "really? You have a face for a hilt?" I loled
---
Your in the middle of the map aren’t you, that’s the only place hex ruin totems spawn.
---
Yes. Give the survivors Halloween costumes!
---
I concur. The introduction of the rift challenges has brought a whole new level of farming to dbd.
---
WHERES THE DEAD HARD SAUUUUUCE
---
Weird I thought they'd go in order of release where it's trapper first then wraith and Billy.
---
Lmao sounds like a Saw ploy
---
Oh fuck off. You cant force people to play.
---
I just had a game where I suicided. Im the only one close to finishing a gen through Ruin. I have Bond so I see all 3 being chased at points getting Myers up to 99%
---
One leads him to me as my gen is 99%. They run right to where i am, use the pallet so I now have no defense, he taps tier 3 and gets me down just as I reach the next pallet. 
---
He hooks me then fucks off. Im left on the hook until almost second stage. One guy being chased, the other raiding a chest, the other taking out a dull totem. So I attempt to break free since I’m running out of time to try, it fails, I dont even bother struggling on second stage because why should I?
---
Fucking shit noob team. I’d rather take the loss and move on and hopefully get put with more useful players
---
10 Tier x 15 games per Tier x 10 min game for max xp : 1500 min + 50 % as que times = 2250 min= ~ 37.5 Hours you will need.
---
I mean, if you haven’t leveled doctor you don’t have add-ons, and likely not ideal perks.  For someone just doing the daily who doesn’t play doc/killer at all, it’s likely they’re gonna get horrifically genrushed, might have trouble finding survivors, and if they’re not used to the speed of switching stances/charging the ability/its full range, against a survivor who knows how to read the killer, it’s entirely possible they won’t.
---
YES

---
True that, i need my lightbringer emblem

They are around my skill level from playing thousands of hours. I'm just a casual player who wants to play against other casual players but i get punished because im not trash.
---
Then say it to disconnection penalties
---
That's not gonna stop me from booping Ghostie
---
Is there evidence of it being about 4 characters and specifically those ones?
---
Yup. 9 or more minutes between lobbies seems to be standard
---
Bold of you to assume it wasn't intended haha
---
What sucks about the ranking system is that it's challenging to find a game at the very lowest levels and at the very highest levels, but at the lower levels you'll be able to climb out as you progress through the game.
---
Okay im near a locker. Safe to cleanse
---
These titles mentioning hitboxes are extremely annoying and misleading to people that aren't familiar with how latency / ping works.
---
Yes, **hit registration** was slightly better than what we have on servers and their current state, specially regarding window vaults.
---
Dont split the playerbase at all. Dont make separate queues. Just make the game detect survivors are SWF. Maybe give a notification to the killer and slow down the generators.
---
You cheated not only the game, but yourself.
---
You didn't grow.
---
You didn't improve.
---
You took a shortcut and gained nothing.
---
You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained.
---
It's sad you don't know the difference.
---
It'll be me, rank 6, with three rank 15 or lower survivors and a rank 17 killer, guaranteed.
---
Pretty sure this was done before
---
Sounds fair enough.
---
I wouldn't run Corrupt Intervention with Hex: Ruin becaues CI makes all survivors move around at the start making Ruin much more vulnerable. Maybe go with BBQ or Pop Goes the Weasel instead.
---
You are correct
---
Or you aren't bad at Nurse and know how to blink properly? It's really not that impossible of a blink.
---
Imagine needing to walk around the map to save your speed boost.
---
This post was made by Lithe gang.
---
Nice work! It looks good.
---
The hitboxes are fine, the problem is the lag from dedicated servers.
---
Its not cheating, you can use a controller because steam allows you to use a ps4 controller from the settings and the game is compatible with a controller
---
😂
---
They’ve never mentioned going past a third prestige
---
I prefer dedicated servers to killer servers any day.
---
Dear lithe gang, 
---
Windows.
---
Sincerely, 
---
Sprint burst gang
---
At high ranks it’s 5-10 minutes on PS4. And that’s not including time wasted when the killer dodges, or when you have to dodge because of bad ping.
---
The survivor bias is strong with this one.  
---
First off, I have very low latency.  In case you didn’t notice, dedicated servers are just shit even if you only have 60ms.  Secondly, I actually get punished;  what would have been an easy hit if not a grab ends up giving me nothing.
---
Second off, the reason killer is obnoxious to play as is because there are so many factors working against you; you can’t be carried by teammates, the game generally favors the survivor and gives them plenty of second chances, and despite all of that people still act salty and toxic.  I used to main survivor but play a lot more killer because of the BP, and once you’ve gotten both roles to red ranks, you really realize how much easier survivor is.  Incredibly safe pallet loops on most maps, double L walls everywhere, etc...

Dead hard promotes bold Plays. I love it. Love using IT love fighting IT.
---
Been playing for about a week and have a couple questions regarding Legion changes that appear to have gone into affect this month. It looks like on hit effects no longer apply. 
---
With that in mind it looks like some of the perks that would have been useful are now no longer.  
---
- Does sloppy butcher no longer proc on frenzy hits?  (The wiki still seems to indicate it does, but maybe not updated?)
---
- Does hitting a survivor who has deep wounds do any damage at all or is it basically the same as a missed hit at this point?  
---
- I don't have any teachable killer perks, but was curious if the following would be any good for Legion with the changes above in mind:   
---
BBQ and Chilli -for BP to unlock other teachables and tracking
---
Discordance - slows the game down a bit, and when procc'ed pretty much means I should be able to get two hits on feral
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse - increased terror radius after activating chase with feral allows for a wider range for the tracking aspect of the power  
---
Thanaphobia - Slows the game down 
---
It will probably take me a really long time to get all those unlocked, so I've been starting with BBQ and chilli for now.
---
Coldwind/Yamaoka\* . I always feel too bad to mori people though :(
---
I hope those two are never nerfed then ^^
---
I hate those stupid fucking mist bottles. They should just take them out....no need to replace them with anything else.
---
You don't get the meme.
---
Rank: yes Queue: no
---
Why, thank you :&gt;
---
Oh ahaha
---
Does madness and unerving Effect DS?
---
Dwight is one of the free ones and he looks scared as shit.
---
I agree 100%
---
Claudette could be a witch, because of her tinctures or "evil potions"
---
Jake could be a scarecrow, ironic considering his affinity for wild animals 
---
I'd make Nea a ninja but that seems P2W 
---
Dwight could just wear a massive bedsheet with holes cut out for eyes. But if that breaks the game maybe a toilet paper mummy with his signature glasses on
---
Id like to see Ace be a vampire with a sick suit
---
David could be Frankensteins monster. I don't think they'd really need a license for that. 
---
Feng I could see be some fairy princess
---
Meg could just wear one of those cheesy "sexy cheetah" print costumes with cat face makeup. 
---
Laurie could wear Michael's clothes
---
Everything in my post is neutral and objective.
---
If you have low latency to the server, the survivor reacted in time and/or has even lower latency than you. Servers make latency for grabs fair (or rather: equally unfair). This is just the reality of online gaming, and again, the killer still has the completely unfair latency advantage for hits. Servers have simply shown that much of the time, players react fast enough for grabs to just be hard to get. That the killer is then briefly locked into the grab animation however is indeed BS that should be remedied.
---
What they could and should do is implement lag-compensated event (hits, grabs, etc.) validation on the servers. That would help to make the players' latency not matter nearly as much in whether a grab (or hit, etc.) actually happens, and a killer wouldn't get robbed of a grab due to their latency being greater than that of the survivor (and vice-versa).
---
I don't go into balance talk or much of any role talk anymore, certainly not on this subreddit, but my question remains: why play killer, then? If it's only for the Bloodpoints, then I have to wonder: what do you need the Bloodpoints for? To level killers that you don't enjoy playing in the first place? Or to level survivors that you don't play?
---
this is amazing, keep up the great work! platinum for you :)
---
You killed him so I'd consider it a win.
---
*Hueheheheheheheh*

welcome to the cult brother

Thanks a lot! I can try ;)
---
Fair And Balanced As All Things Should Be.
---
Yep.  Guy on unhooks me while the killer is right there, I get downed, killer chases guy .... I crawl away, get loses the killer, comes back and just teabags over me to get the killer's attention.
---
Killer comes back, hits and chases idiot, killer leaves me alone, I get healed and flee.  Killer downs and hooks idiot, who then tries 3 times to escape the hook, then stops struggling after about 5 seconds.  Tons and tons of salt for me in the chat, for no reason.
---
Obviously, their main goal was to be toxic and get other survivors killed.  So stupid.
---
i also get disconnected especially when i get downed immediately....thats so annoying
---
I never like going against a Leatherface because pretty much every time I do, they insidious camp, face camp or tunnel
---
The only killer that would be balanced for is Legion and it would make sense lore wise.
---
Ur so right. Revert balanced landing ASAP!
---
Dear Sprint Burst gang,
---
Walk.
---
Sincerely, Balanced Landing gang
---
Now I'm imagining Claudette as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz with Dwight, Jake and David as the scarecrow, tin man and lion
---
Claudette would be Wraith in his cloaked mode. Then she’ll really be invisible.
---
I dont think dc penalties should be in the game either. I mean maybe when its fixed yeah but right now its a fucking shambles and bug ridden
---
You are correct!
---
Almost every game now when you’re close to winning they disconnect.
---
Past few months killers have been disconnecting more than survivors from my experience. Wonder what changed.
---
Either I have Alzheimer's or you posted this 3 times.
---
...to level survivors that I do play.  I play both, like I said, but I intend to go back to survivors when I have all the perks I want teachable for my p3 Ace.  Also, obviously the latency is NOT in the killer’s favor, because it would have given me the fucking grab if it were.  The survivors can have worse latency and it will still favor them when grabbing, even though it may not seem like it at windows.
---
You should write a useless “Survivors rulebook for survivors” so I can ignore it and play however the fuck I want to play.
---
Maybe not 1 down, since you could just down their rescuer and then tunnel them freely, but at LEAST after hooking two other Survivors. Like how am I still tunneling you at that point?
---
Also the perk is garbage against ACTUAL tunneling because you can just wait out the timer and then murder them.
---
The perk should activate after getting unhooked and remain active until someone else is hooked. Then it would actually be an anti-tunnelling perk.
---
I'm glad we're all on the same page keep upvoting and maybe the dev's will take notice.
---
I actually got it first try. Not saying it’s gonna be easy, but if you have leatherface, play him and use agitation and iron grasp so you can get to the basement from longer distances. Other perks to use alongside are mad grit and territorial imperative. Try to three gen around the basement if possible to force the survivors near it.

i wanna know on killers side how it looks like...its the same with the window hit boxes...i get hit meters away and still the killers have to walk to get me....do they like...wonder whats goin on or they just pick up the meat amd hook it!

Honestly every match i habe played today has been a doctor/hag/huntress camping right in front of me. Im done playing survivor for a while
---
"Guys! It bugged! I hit the skill check! I swear! PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR, RIGHT? RIGHT!?" *starts sweating profoundly*
---
 Thank you very much for the platinum award. I really appreciate you and your kindness. Also I wish you a happy new year, good luck in life, health to you and your family.
---
&gt;The perk should activate after getting unhooked and remain active until someone else is hooked. Then it would actually be an anti-tunnelling perk.
---
I would add if they do anything else in the game to progress. Such as fixing a generator. If you can work on a generator you can be hooked, imo.
---
I member transitioning from hiding for all heartbeats to just pushing the gen. Unless you know for sure they are coming. Whether from clear hearbeat escalation or actually seeing them.
---
r/ShapePalletStun
---
I can't agree with this.  The nobody adds a little flavor or body to the comedy.
---
I thinks its kinda obvious it isnt hitboxes. Its just have became such a meme around the game. Smile
---
It's doggo speak in a trenchcoat
---
Meanwhile some people still pushing for that dc penalty to be in the game already...
---
This is good advice but fyi, you got respecting pallets backwards. Respecting pallets is stopping at them and not swinging through.
---
ur second time? i read people struggling with that  for days...i simply ignore that shit for a challenge....
---
No Mither challenges here we come!
---
I wanna see a video of someone punting this
---
Killer nerfs
---
Had a very similar experience. Eye opening for sure.
---
no its haunted
---
Then I hope you will soon have all perks on your Ace to play survivor instead, saving you from your frustrations with playing killer.
---
I pointed out that latency for grabs is in the favour of the player with less latency. For hits, latency is always completely in the killer's favour, due to hit detection being done solely on the killer's client and the server accepting their hits unconditionally.
---
If a survivor notices you, they may have a few hundred milliseconds or up to even a second to react to let go of the interaction before you are physically able to grab them. Latency plays into this because it can be in the realm of 100-200ms total, but even in a LAN environment grabs would just be difficult to get because you basically have to get right behind the survivor and initiate the grab before the survivor even notices you. Letting go of the interaction is a reaction that can happen very fast.
---
That grabs are still entirely possible and not unfairly affected by latency in a biased way for either side is obvious at hooks, where grabs are still a regular occurence.
---
yes and it makes it actually impossible to hit
---
So Doctor is even more cancerous and obnoxious to play against then I imagined even more so with the rework coming.
---
Some people just act like babbies when they lose... mommy and daddy couldn’t win it for them :(
---
Instead of reduced cooldown, remove the cooldown. Remove lunge. Let him swing his heart out like he has mad grit
---
I do try that why I love this subreddit so I can rant
---
Thanks !
---
But dead hard is just better. If you are going to use sprint burst. Use lithe. You dont need to walk the entire game with those perks. Sprint burst kinda ew.
---
They didn't  do the graphics what I'm say is since they are the publisher they control what and what not happens the devs have dilated ideas about the game like how killers who aren't  viable are fine to play
---
I got it my first try with trapper on The Game. Everyone just stepped on my traps near the basement and no one DCed. I was really lucky
---
Yet demo is still the hottest
---
I must be incredibly lucky. In my 100 hours of playtime the only time I’ve been camped was an insidious bubba in the basement. Most likely just trying to get the challenge too.
---
Ha ha not if your shit at the game like me my rank of 12 on killer makes lobby’s take 5 mins to find hahaha *sniff* I’m so shit
---
People getting angry at a perk for giving an advantage
---
What are you? Im a 16 and cant stop getting camped
---
injury.

*Post by the 'no exhaustion perks' gang*

Then they tunnel you from across the map with terminator vision

Such as?
---
Instaheals got nerfed. Balanced got nerfed.
---
Why would spirit getting a tweak be an excuse for random myers, wraiths, leatherfaces etc etc to disconnect?
---
Instead of "snap out of it" survivors can "puke your guts out" to lower it.
---
Did someone make a typo on it?

You're missing

Xbox player nah the hitboxes are a little bit broken

Rank 10 on PC. Not sure if it’s different in console

Second panel: While you are healing Kate, Michael Myers, equipped with Nurse's Calling, gets to Tier 3.
---
 I can't believe that's a thing
---
No lies detected
---
The news also says it's the 2nd
---
Michael is the best killer for me
---
Nah, dead hard can be really fucking good if being used by a good survivor, it can make you reach a window/pallet that you wouldn't otherwise and extend the chase by a lot
---
We are gonna need a video of that. It sounds awesome.
---
I wish my life was as rich of experience as yours to make this completely out of left field and potentially very accurate association , OP

I'm not exactly mashing my scroll wheel, though, am I?

What time does the double blood points event start and end?
---
Starbreeze being gone gave the devs much more freedom. It's why the game has improved. Starbreeze still had nothing to do with graphics. Yes, they were the publishers, but they did influence everything. Get your head out of your ass.
---
I’m so fucking tired of farming killers, I join the match to play the game and die a horrible death. Not sit there while killer is attacking at his traps or a gen and nodding at me the whole game. Or getting sandbagged so survivors can unhook/heal/etc. so frustrating. I report every farming and sandbagging asshole, including the survivors who enable it by stepping in traps over and over. Working with the killer. not that it will do anything tho...
---
That's pretty lame. Why spread them out across DLC's, and 4 characters?
---
I get it, Zappy-Boi's getting a rework but why not something like Doctor x Feng Min or Plague x Jane etc.
---
Also tome 3 has a fucking unlock the hatch with key trial. These are the challenges I thought we wanted to get away from.
---
Just cleanse totems
---
cleansing totems doesn't require skill either.
---
Have they said when the Doctor rework is coming? It would be silly to have Doctor challenges before it.
---
The game has improved "we did a pretty  good job so far" btw xbox and ps4 still hasn't been optimised for two years last year they promised to do so but not significant change and the battle pass that's fun. So before you insult me do a check up with the health of the game
---
I congratulate good survivors too.

Just here looking for the S A U C E.

Should be in the mid chapter patch

Now that's what I like to see.
---
Again how does that explain every other killer in the game disconnecting?
---
Man, after hooking all of the survivors and 3 of them letting go, I would have given that Claudette the hatch. feelsbadman, but ez 4k
---
I was playing while my cousin was watching and I dropped a pallet on Myers, we both looked at each other and immediately knew
---
I'd suggest swapping out spies and putting bitter murmur in its place, since bitter is overall a better tracking perk. And unless you plan on slugging in your matches or using the addon that downs people released from your traps, I'd say swap out deerstalker for either agitation or distressing. I prefer distressing to keep gen pressure while placing traps
---
It's called Dying Light because the obsession is the light of hope and the light is dying, that is why they have the buff. They are the hope

Took this screen yesterday.

Inspired by  [u/iCryo](https://www.reddit.com/user/iCryo/) to leave that screenshot here
---
I wouldnt worry too much. All red rank teams ive been put with today (as survivor) have been garbage.
---
They get barely any points, the gens dont move, they all end up slugged at the same time. Its ridiculous.
---
I remember when red ranks used to be legit red ranks.
---
The way this is
---
just mindgame 4head

whats the point then?

Don't compare my Clown to this... Entity!

Detectives Hunch 3 &gt; Small game

This is a repost.
---
The thing about deerstalker is if i down someone i like to run and down the other guy too then its much easier to hook them both. But ill make sure to try out agitation.
---
Console has been ongoingly optimized. So before you insult me fo a check up of what's actually been done to the game. And, I'll say it again, Starbreeze has *NOTHING* to do with any of this.

Ib prestige you get way better things and it resets the bloodweb and thats pretty important if you only got shity perks for a charachter then better prestigr him if you want to play him often
---
I'll delete it and repost it later, my bad
---
Try thrilling tremors instead of surveillance. After picking up and hooking someone you know what gens people are definitely on and can pop. Surge will let you start regressing things nearby and you can pop what's important. If you're tunneling the surged gen you can get 33% regression on it.
---
Technically the whole game is un-optimized on PS4, from the un-locked framerate screens that make your PS4 almost take flight to the shitty 10FPS when  2 or more survivors are in your screen at the same time...
---
You DC'ed but ok
---
Thank you. Finally! The whole thing is fucking ridiculous. They should just auto complete when we somehow do it in the game. Instead we have people throwingn the game so they can do the stupid challange.
---
Nurse really didn’t get nerfed and spirit didn’t either. Spirit now requires SOME skill instead of blind luck and just hoping you’ll collide with a survivor. I’m not sure what happened to Oni but he hasn’t seemed much different from the PTB at least when I’ve been playing with/against him.
---
Alas, a perk that doesn't do anything except the last 3 minutes of the game and punishes players who do the objective. Run rancor instead ;)
---
It's like survivors have electric shoulder pads, you grab them and then your arm has a stroke and whacks them instead.
---
I'm quite sure it will launch with the doctor rework
---
"Those people who are the problem just die on hook."
---
Bullshit, lots DC after being downed first or before first hook.
---
So which one of you is the Claudette main?
---
But seriously these look fantastic, and a great size to show a ton of detail without being too busy.
---
They have their resons or don't look in you're direction
---
I use my phones hotspot to play and I've never had this happen.
---
It works really well with Plague and Legion due to their ability to apply the broken status effect.
---
imagine a survivor perk that made killer 3% faster movement speed wise or just any buff in general it makes no sense
---
Because they need to feel that they have that power role even though they are toothless in game and IRL. Unless they resort to scummy tactics. Pathetic.
---
Why did you DC?
---
Whispers is the best tracking perk once you learn how to use it. It is difficult to learn tho
---
It’s mostly a low rank thing and really sucks for new players. Hey be been playing on Switch today and I’ll my team mates have been camped and tunneled. Red ranks on PC for years so was shocked to see how bad it is in low ranks. I feel bad for these guys.
---
Why?
---
&gt;I still be getting
---
That is so hard to read
---
I totally get the DC. It's so annoying facing a super amazing SWF or all R1 survs.
---
You repair gens way  slower jurt search an yt video where they compare it so left side awake reparing gen and right side asleep reparing gen and you don't her freddys terror radius
---
"Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I got here."
---
Jeez dude, chill out. He's just trying to make the game better. Doesn't give you the right to shit on his idea
---
You can compare it a little to huntress hatchets, the hitbox is a little wonky in my experience but generally it's only good for saves or as a backup plan when you are actually trying to hide. The 3 second wait makes it difficult to use in a chase.
---
Bt will activate cause in the description of the affect stand just that you can't hear it but still are in it or did I miss something
---
You shouldn't be walking everywhere with SB anyway.
---
look deep within me? the hell u on about? let me give u a better similé. Lets say in a game of basketball for whatever reason it was decided that going under the basket is not allowed because its shitty boring and promotes a slow game. its not a great strategy and often ends up with you getting to lose the ball but yea. and lets say the official existing rules of the game do not get changed to change that rule. and you constantly play with random people and whenever some1 enters under the basket the entire team just starts yelling at the guy who ran under the basket like he is the worst human trash on earth. if they'd just let the guy go under the basket 5 times he'll realise his strategy is not only sub optimal but also boring. wouldnt it be a better learning experience to just let the guy attempt this, fail, and stop doing it? do we have to break his bones verbally for even attempting it? im not the type of player that cares a lot about either side's rules. all is fair play so long as bhvr deems it to be. and i dont camp and i often dont tunnel. believe it or not i genuinely feel bad tunneling even though i dont give a shit about the survivors rules not because i am being policed but because im a human being. people can do that how fascinating right? let people do what tehy want to do its a fucking game dont make it more dramatic than it has to be
---
Maybe they're trying to derank? Alternatively they're just so arrogant at rank 1 that they think they can get away with being lazy with their objectives. More than a few times when I've faced red rank Survivors as a Killer they get up in my face since they know they're good at escaping anyway, or their SWF teammates will be waiting around the corner with flashlights. I've been followed by red ranks a lot as well and some of them would DC the moment their cockiness got them downed.
---
The thing you can do is try to listen for downed survivors because they make a fairly audible sound on the ground. That way if you listen for them deerstalker becomes useless
---
Nea must’ve done something very wrong. Maybe she cleansed the ruin totem and Myers saw?
---
After the bloodweb only resets you only get shit so better prestige him and leveling the resseting bloodweb cost 70.000-100.000bp per reset
---
That's so valid. I've literally never thought of that. Holy shit.
---
Neat, I can't wait for Jane's backstory to be alaborated on. Doctor's too but I don't know how they can make it all that interesting.
---
They don't make sounds in locker and the blood comes again when injured
---
This isn't a standard facecamp. I know it might seem toxic, but in scenarios like this, the last survivor is usually hiding nearby for the unhook, so running off blindly to find them is just giving up a free kill. I don't know the full context to this clip, and proxy camping would be way more effective here, but you get the idea.
---
Remember kids: run kindred.
---
Amazing team i went against. Gens got popped in 6 minutes. And to put the icing on the cake they brought a skeleton key. I dc out of rage and anger, but props to them that was one of the best teams ive ever played

*Oh Jimmy...* you haven't broken Ruin yet? Its Haddonfield place is tiny, get a move on it!

Ouch.  Not a single person on this sub hasn't been there lol

I love you. Thank you for playing things other than the stale meta.
---
SMH my team be trippen
---
Looks like the LF is just finished with the match and is content with letting the last person get the hatch.
---
And they talked about the what you mean and its impossible not nearly even with bubba chainsaw I needed to kearn that the hard way
---
No he did the same thing to the other 2 guya that died. Hes very much face camping
---
Now *this* is shitposting!
---
Teleporting everywhere sounds more like bad wifi
---
He did the same thing to the second and first guys he caught
---
I'd love to see a headphone wearing feng as one of those
---
If I already tunneled you, camped you, tunneld you again what makes you believe I wouldn't slug you until the D-strike wears of? Just saying...
---
I’ve noticed this too
---
See when people first start out, it seems common to choose Dwight, giving them the baby Dwight stereotype. However you can graduate from this classification by proving yourself a good player and looping the killer for an extended period of time and not focusing only on gens. This will earn you the title of a dwoot therefore bypassing the baby Dwight stereotype
---
The community is toxic as it is, I don't want to add to it lol. I also don't teabag at the exit gate. People are crappy

If you have trouble finding downed survivors, turn up your volume and/or get the perk Stridor from nurse.

Our Bubba, who art in heaven, sweaty be thy game

I like sprint burst on occasion. I run it with vigil and then lose the killer only to have it again when they find me. I probably use DH the most atm, my favorite used to be balanced landing but I find myself using lithe more than it atm. Head on is just a meme but it can be fun to build around sometimes. All in all I enjoy using them all at different times. Sometimes I use none though. Really depends how I feel and I like to change my build up alot.

You're better than most then

Solo Q has just 0 appeal to me and many others. Why suffering with boosted and selfishpotatoe team mates and broken matchmaking when you can just get some friends and Q SWF and ACTUALLY have fun playing the survivor role?
---
Oh thank the lord, I'm a claudette main born before 1993 so I'm good
---
I just had a game where the Killer got no hooks at all, and then as we're trying to open the gate, all 3 of my teammates go down without noed, then I get chased and fuck up so I go down too. That was at the end of an awful streak.
---
Before that, I went against a Billy with Infectious, BBQ, Enduring, and Spirit Fury, who actually knew how to curve. He killed us all in 2 minutes so I checked his rank and it said 15. I called bullshit so I went to his profile and his background photo was a screenshot of him at rank 1. I figured as much. I'm in green ranks btw.

Yeah for sure, thing is i dont play with headphones when my wife and daughter are awake, hence why i dont play with murmur... but do you thinj without headphones its worth it still? I could try it out

Thats awesome 👏🏻

Wow, and only 4 gens got done?

I haven't run Dead Hard in months lmao it never works. My brother swore by it and even he recently stopped using it because it just doesn't ever work.

Who said anything about throwing down pallets instanly? I guess you have to write a paragraph breaking down everything lol

it is the best subreddit

I'm excited to hear The Clown's...

I’m surprised you’ve made it this far into the game without headphones. As someone who’s played it very frequently I can tell you that audio is a big part of this game in all aspects. Unless you have good directional speakers, I would recommend headphones. The headphones themselves don’t have to be noise cancelling, which allows you to hear your wife or daughter but they will also all for directionality. I will tell you this will make gameplay so much better for you if you just use headphones.

Yes!! I get angry messages sometimes of tunneling ... but I didn’t know it was you I hooked :p

Damn that looks so cool!
---
hitboxes aren’t broken, just the lunge ranges are the same for every killer so the ones with shorter weapons look like they should miss
---
I have some experienced on the game because i played 1 year and a half on PC a couple years ago.. then i stopped and i have recently started again on PS4. But i came here for advice because of my rank its slowly getting harder.. 
---
Thanks for the tips tho, i might play more of dead by daylight at night when they go to bed so i can take my headphones
---
A wasted swing can do more for you than going little faster for a little bit.
---
Oof that sucks. Have an up vote for your troubles. I am sorry, for it is all that I can give.
---
Bad connection most likely, consoles are P2P so both your internet and the killer’s internet matter; in my experience, this has gotten much worse since BHVR started focusing on dedicated servers for PC. Both the killer and survivors can have decent internet and green-yellow ping in the pregame lobby, yet the match ends up being a laggy shit show.

OP implied throwing pallets early when he said "dropping every pallet I see". He didn't have to write a paragraph for the majority of us to understand, but maybe he needed to for you.

I find this hilarious. It’s a silly stereotype but... yesterday I played on a smurf account to help a new player because I didn’t want him getting red rank killers (DONT come for me, I let the rank 20 killers kill me and wasn’t a bully. Wasn’t for me, was for my friend) 
---
But a new Dwight was being chased and hopped in the locker loud as fuck... I was there and I tried getting the killer on me... This fucking Dwight stayed in the locker til he had crows, and I went back for him and waved for him to come out. It was the cutest thing but jesus where is the Dwight rulebook?
---
Had a gaggle of rock-throwing Adams show me this in a killer game. Tried to chainsaw sprint onto the horse to no avail.
---
Will dedicated servers ever coming to console? Days like this the game is damn near unplayable.
---
The past two mice I've had, both scroll wheels started to break down. This was before I even started playing DBD. I think I'll save my scroll wheel the abuse.

Lol, survivors missuse an obvious buggy system BHVR is to lazy to fix.  
---
\- BHVR: "*Who gives a shit..."*
---
Killers actually use 2 add-ons BHVR is to lazy to fix:  
---
\- BHVR: "*Player misusing the bug can be banned..."*
---
This reminder was brought to you by the Legion Squad!
---
I can hear the blood splash sound the Error makes.
---
then maybe you are wasting too much time on that chase?
---
no one tell him
---
Yesterday survivor messaged me accusing me of tunneling. I said I don't remember who was who because I was hooking so many people and honestly wasn't really paying close attention. He said I need to get good so I can remember who is who so I know who I'm allowed to hook. I guess I forgot about the survivor rulebook. Need to get back to studying.
---
Unfortunately, dedicated servers aren’t a holy grail that will magically fix the in-game spaghetti. Doubly unfortunate is that BHVR tends to shaft console when it comes to this sort of thing. Lots of bugs, no optimization patch despite being announced over a year ago, etc., I guess the fact that they hosted their AMA on r/pcgaming says something.
---
ofc, not every time, but 1 in 3 matches ruin is not found before 4 gen is done.
---
I had the same problem of getting tunneled for a while. It wasnt just me getting tunneled, it was usually whoever was hooked first the killer would constantly focus. That's why I started running decisive, spine chill. Spine chill helps me know when the killer is heading towards me/has lost me in a chase. And Decisive is like a slap in the face to a tunneling killer. I've had many games where the exit gates are open and I'm sitting on the hook with the killer close by. Someone finally manages to unhook me and bam he instantly downs me again. However I slap his ass with that ds and pull off on him. I hate to see it when I play killer, but as a survivor it's so satisfying lol.
---
I need thanataphobia for legion
---
Desicated servers aren't going to help with this, I'm afraid. Instead of a direct connection between you and the killer, you're adding a third party in between. Both you and the killer have to send your inputs to that third party before they are relayed to the other party. This increases the overall time between when they did something and when you see it. Peer to Peer is usually ideal for less latency.
---
The thing with removing a ranking system is that you would also be paired up with shit survivors. This can pose a risk to you because let’s say the killer does down your after you run them for five gens, if you’re paired with beginners, they most likely won’t save you from the hook. You would end up dying either way, you might as well die with dignity after getting three hooked by the killer instead of dying because your teammates are idiots
---
Can’t wait for my putrid serum to
---
I’m glad I could help in any way possible
---
Fungoose.
---
Just black
---
I know right I’m so excited for when it finally will
---
Yes kindred would be a must for that
---
Will it though?
---
i did it first try on my account, and then like, 3rd on my friends. ig people are just really unlucky but i think its p easy
---
yea I use it on them but I wish it had more use like I'm fine with obsession not being affected but to give them 33% heal speed and unhook speed seems a bit odd
---
"Daddy Myers" 😂😂😂😂
---
The most optimal way to do it is debatable. I agree with OP's approach though. For every minute of being chased on average I'll throw 2-3 pallets (honestly just a rough guess). That means to get 12 pallets thrown you'd have to be chased for 4-6 minutes. That's a long ass time and likely not gonna happen, because either I'll get downed or the killer will just go to someone else. More efficient option is to throw pallets immediately then go to the next pallet. Rinse and repeat. You could throw 6 pallets in a minute that way.

Oh I never use decisive ! I wasn’t sure what it was or how to use it I’ll have to check it out. I can’t remember what all I have been using with Nancy off hand but I know it isn’t either of those. Thank you!!
---
OF course
---
But you don’t have to do the challenge in 1 game. You should get it naturally in 3-4 games no big deal
---
Thanks you! I have been watching a lot of month and a bit of noob3 (he is harder to watch.) I’ve definitely gotten better, but it’s so frustrating trying to look while playing console lol
---
Thank you also to the user recommending I change sensitivity l, this has helped quite a bit (playing now)
---
Iron Grasp isn't very useful if you're not running a basement build, so I would swap it out. 
---
Brutal Strength is good.
---
Spies is a decent tracking perk, don't let reddit tell you otherwise. 
---
Deerstalker is a crutch. Swap it out, turn up your volume and listen for dying survivors.
---
*Recommendations:*
---
Sloppy Butcher is great perk to slow down generator progress.
---
NOED is good for M1 killers like trapper, but prepare to be called an asshole.
---
Bitter Murmur is amazing in combination with Spies for tracking.
---
Whispers lets you know if survivors can see you setting traps.
---
&gt;If I was a predatory alien (which I am not) 
---
Why does this part really make me think you're a predatory alien?
---
Well it’s not even that they don’t know that no one’s saving. It would be because they are scared of the killer coming after them after they rescue or because they are too much of a dumbass to realize that they can save. Speaking from personal experience
---
At tier 3 when the killer downs you within 60 seconds after you have just been unhooked then a skill check pops up as he picks you up. If you hit the skill check you will jump off his shoulder and  stun him for 5 seconds. But it only works 1 time, and if you miss it then its useless.
---
*cleanses*
---
Nemisis is an awesome perk when used with obsession abilities. 
---
PWYF and freddys Ultra rare addon to name 2
---
Thank you for the answer. Glad to know now.
---
God I wish we could have seen the look on his face at that moment.
---
It's not impossible, it's just harder. After the DS rework the skill check area got significantly bigger so its actually not that hard anymore. I remember trying to hit them before the rework and the skill check area was literally a line. That was freaking hard to hit but felt so good when you would hit it.
---
I didn't know that. This guy's just being being an asshole then, but when it's obvious killer is facecamping, let them die on hook and put full focus on gens.
---
I wonder how much the entity spends on candles. Probably alot.
---
I think his addons that effect his bell are some of his best ones. The one that makes it silent, and the one that makes it where you cant tell how far away he is. It helps you get the jump on them. Other than that you can use ones that increase his speed etc.
---
It’s bugged then. If you had pictures of you with the key exiting the trial with the key and then a picture of the following slides or maybe a video of both, then I’m sure behavior would be able to give one to you if you report it on the forums
---
Considering how many people utilise hex totems imo it's foolish to leave one standing. I played about 10 games yesterday and every single one had either ruin or noed. It's become a staple for basic builds, which gets annoying but whatev, play the game how you see fit

---
I guess cabbage head really likes shirtless Davids
---
Tons of other challenges to get to, why waste your time. Maybe works for you but not for others.
---
That’s called sandbagging and it’s a dick thing to do
---
that would just make camping much easier too though. Especially against stealth killers, Freddy, and Bubba. Killers who can easily counter BT and down survivors easily around the hook
---
I still think DS is fine, if it really needed to be  changed, I think just reducing it back to a 3 second stun is enough.
---
Damn this looks lovely, good work
---
Not on xbox
---
Oh I didn’t know it had a name but I 100% agree. It makes me so effing mad !
---
Well that’s awesome!
---
Dead hard is broken from dedicated servers ATM

I myself use noed because im bad and need a second chance but im changing that when i get my teachables

Still waiting for the lobby wait
---
If you die then RIP in peace.
---
When is the next big update? Comparable to the Archives update.
---
That reaction is WHY people blame the community overall instead of the toxic few.
---
By itself I don’t think it’s a good perk tbh
---
Fr honestly I just hit the moving blobs I sit too far back from my tv to see who they are
---
My life has Ruin so yeah cleanse that for me please.
---
Ah, a Man of Culture.
---
Can't agree more. Killers might be whining the most but in the end they're right. Playing Killer is stressful and most of the time straight up unfun. Why is playing Killer stressful when it should be the other way? Why are Survivors able to bully the Killer in so many ways?   
---
I play both sides equally, I'm not a main of anything, and I can safely affirm that yes, the Survivors are the power role. I used to love this game but after reaching red ranks on both sides I got tired of the constant bullshit and stopped playing.  
---
I'll keep an eye on the development of the game and come back every now and then but that's about it.
---
Dont do this...
---
This entire thing is based on both rank and location. At rank 10 you’d Gould be getting pretty fast lobbies, but maybe your download region is getting in the way of this. A fix for this would be changing your download region in steam, but the trade off would be worse ping in all of your multiplayer games
---
I guess it will.
---
Pretty sure this is against the rules man no self promotion
---
Hitting a survivor in Frenzy while they're deep wounded does nothing (unless you have Frank's Mix Tape, which I don't recommend). It counts as a won chase for Chaser and it makes the survivor run faster again.
---
I used to run Monitor, and while the stealth aspect of it is alright, the increased terror radius gives you a false perspective of whether you can reasonably reach survivors with your Frenzy or not.

---
I hate how the Dying Light change actually made Evil Incarnate harder.
---
One of the biggest troubles you face attempting this (Besides people DCing or hiding in lockers) is time. Myers is slowed with Tombstone (Meaning you need PYWF) and reaching Tier 3 with tombstone and tuft takes forever. The original Dying Light allowed you to tombstone your PYWF obsession for a 25% slow which was a decent way to get some more time since 95% of Tombstone Myers games have Myers never hitting and only stalking survivors trying to reach EW3 as fast as possible before all the gens pop.

"People getting angry at a second chance perk that gives you borderline immunity"

nea in a black cat outfit, come on that one is easy

I'd run Sloppy, Whispers, Agitation, and Iron Grasp. Agitation and Iron Grasp makes you able to ensure basement hooks. Sloppy is good for slowdown. And Whispers is good for knowing when you can place traps. And when you're near someone. If you're not fussed about basement hooking people you can just run NoEd.
---
hook 1 person. dont see them for 10 minutes. hook them again. leave the hook. others escape out the door.

Hi Rank 2 Killer here ((console))
---
You run into an extravagant amount of SWF teams up here, killers just get whittled down until we just decide to basically say "fuck it" and do whatever we want. Basically red ranks suck to be at and I'd try to keep around purple/green to have "fun."
---
DCing is a waste. Get whatever points you can. You might also learn something facing that good of a team.
---
Just use Bond, it's way more versatile and the info you get is all you need. Did you ever walk across the entire map to heal someone?
---
For a build bbq, ruin, iron maiden and whispers is pretty good. For advice, if someone is about to throw down a pallet wind up a hatchet and you will get a free hit. This won't work as well at high ranks but low ranks it works probably 90% of the time.
---
They should have started the blood hunt a week ago and let it run thru till the new year since we didn’t even get a winter event and everyone is off for the holidays. 
---
But no, let’s start it back when everyone is back to work and fixing to get back to school and only run It for 4 days like normal because BhVR is a dumbass company filled with tar tar’s. 
---
None of those cosmetic drops missed their due dates and keep on coming, while we still have a broke ass game, filled with bugs.
---
Finish up your bill. He has two of the perks you want. He has borrowed time and unbreakable

I get the same error on Xbox. But luckily since GP I find matches very quickly. As killer though I have sat for a few minutes searching. That sucks.

It's pretty embarassing. For the first time in weeks, I missed my DS at the worst moment possible. My last 2 teammates were slugged and for some reason, the Ghostface was teabagging my corpse and I missed my DS. Man, that stung.
---
This happened allot to me last night, I feel your pain.
---
I hope you brought a mori
---
Really? I haven't heard of this change.

get outta my comment section

I was able to pull of the window tech before the hotfix and now it just won’t work

*LAUGHS IN TOXIC SURVIVOR*
---
Mmm, that doesn't sound legit
---
If you’re so casual wouldn’t rank reset put you back closer to where you want to be anyway? Maybe suck it up and throw a couple games to depip? I agree that it just seems like you’re complaining about not being able to just breeze through matches. There’s supposed to be a challenge.
---
I would go for Iron Will first, it’s amazing and helps you stay stealthy + postpone healing.
---
Go for Meg next if you’re more of a genrush type (Adrenaline + SB for faster gens)
---
Or go for Bill if you’re more confrontational and like getting chased + saving teammates (BT and Unbreakable)
---
I agree but let’s keep the 4 gens in one game so the level 17 megheads do the objective
---
60% of the worthless teammates I get playing solo queue are Dwights, and I’m a rank 7. Hiding in lockers for no reason, throwing pallets way too early, blowing up gens, hiding near hook but never unhooking... they’re always the worst. Then it’s 20% Meg sandbagging and 20% David hook farming.
---
Selfcare isnt really needed anymore but its useful .
---
Yeah, I experienced those road blocks and I struggled with them and then cleared them both in back to back sessions.  One success was due to a friendly killer who forgot to equip a perk for his own challenge and going easy on us/memeing.
---
The other was being set against an easier set of survivors (even ranked, non-SWF) as opposed to the typical SWFs that outrank me 5-8 ranks.  For that challenge I had struggled for two days.
---
I haven't even bothered to go after the 4 in the basement challenge.  I'm sure, given enough time, I could get it done but I'm not willing to risk the high chance of a legitimate 4K, basement kill on poor sport survivors DCing.
---
That said, I was paranoid with the last tome and it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.  There are some good strats if you Google them.  For example, for the four pallet stun, you can literally stop in a pallet if you're full health and let the killer swing on you.  You'll get injured but as he's wiping his weapon, you can slam the pallet and actually guarantee a stun.
---
Had a similar idea to rework clown though my version would havr h carry 4 bottles that had completely different Effects likw one would reveale survivor auras and another that he would drink tk guve him a speed boost.
---
Yours is pretty cool as well.
---
No Wraith and Billy lore? Disappointing :((
---
I definitely had more fun around green to purple ranks and noticed it getting progressively more toxic at Rank 4-6
---
That's exactly what you'd expect a blendette to be doing. Cleansing all game.
---
Lemme stabs
---
Yeah because rn there is no penalty so it's faster. With the penalty it will be better time wise to kill yourself on hook.
---
Tho a lot of people will not even care about that and just DC and tab out to watch youtube during the queue.
---
I suggest you levelp up Davind King because of Dead Hard and We're gonna live forever which basically gives you x2 BPs. Then level up Meg since she has Sprint Burst and Adrenaline which are now two meta perks (yes SB is a meta perk again since DH is inconsistent).
---
I no what your getting at but you need to stay still mid chase to use you 99'd Sprint burst, free hit oppurtunity for the killer. Also 99ing sprint burst means you're running around doing nothing all game.
---
I really wanted to but I didn’t have one unfortunately
---
Sorry bro, had the same thing happen to me as well and on Christmas Day I let a kid get his 4th basement kill on me and he got his achievement. It will happen just keep plugging away at it and BhVR made some of these challenges just out right toxic
---
Maybe we’ll finally get some good David cosmetics
---
I need ya'll to stop arguing asap as possible.
---
If you really think about it it isn't. It actually gives the least distance out of any exhaustion perk besides head on.
---
Self care has been out for a while. I took a 6 month break myself a came back no problem. You’ll be fine!
---
Don't compare the entity to this..... Pig!
---
Tapp with the Investigation Suit + Tactical Trousers is at Claud’s level of stealth, it’s insane. Plus he’s naturally quiet without Iron Will.
---
I’m also up . My psn is kraiinv
---
Yeah bbq is still popular. Me and my friends are always playing red rank killer and I'd say 8/10 scenarios the killer is running both bbq or ruin. I still run self-care on half of my characters but it's annoying because you realize it takes so long to heal especially with sloppy butcher or healing add ons the killer brings. There's also more options for quicker healing like Inner Strength which is more practical in a sense as well. Lately what else I've been noticing is that people are running play with your food and that new Oni perk that makes a person that stuns the killer the new obsession. So they just take a stun and break the pallet and they have a speed boost.
---
When the current rift ends in about a weeks' time, how long will it be before the next one starts?
---
I've always had the same build on huntress and never changed. I use BBQ and chili, ruin, whispers and discordance. If you really want you can swap discordance for bitter murmur. I use discordance since it's useful for sniping people working on a gen
---
You should be afraid of the typo they make every single update lol
---
Prestiged Tapp is anything but stealthy.
---
Like I said, if you plan on slugging (even for a short time to down someone nearby) keep deerstalker. I personally try to avoid slugging so I run distressing for the map pressure, I mentioned agitation because its just a nice perk to have. Never know when a survivor will drag you far away from any and all hooks lol
---
Bill because he has 2 of the perks you want
---
Giving the killer a notification would guaranteed make them just quit.
---
Nah it's DEERSTALKER
---
This is amazing!! What a great idea
---
I mean most killers on steam can check if there are friends in the lobby, and will just leave if its more than a duo. It won't change much.
---
I can relate, Every fucking time lol It's worse because it's my friend. No one has been hooked, No hex being applied to gens and yet, You destroy a fucking HG totem. Once it got 3 people down in less than 30 seconds because of the spirit + Some idiot spawned everyone together
---
Dude this literally happened to me last game
---
Did you do the achievement a while ago? Was there a David in that game or one of your previous games that escaped?
---
IT GLOWS
---
Nope, never played him.
---
I was concerned about not completing the Lore or Rift before the end.  I've settled on not completing the Lore (1 item) because it's not worth the frustration to go for the 4 basement kills.  
---
I thought a lot of the challenges in the 4th tome would be beyond my skill as I consider myself merely a decent survivor/killer (not necessarily good and definitely not great) but it turns out my fears were mostly unwarranted.
---
Luckily, I put a lower priority on Lore than I do the Rift rewards and I'm not sorely disappointed with that decision and I also think it's fair for there to be challenges not everyone is able to complete under the premise they are still able to earn enough Auric rewards to pay for the premium Rift given that it was a selling point for this new approach to the game.
---
Self Care is dead.
---
The majority of builds at red ranks are DS, Adren, BT and DH/BL
---
Some switch out BT for other perks though.
---
SC is not meta anymore
---
Easy 4Ks...LMAO!!
---
3 DC's, I give the last survivor the hatch.
---
For a survivor's "personal" perks to appear as teachables, you need to unlock the teachable on that survivor (they appear at levels 30, 35, and 40) and then they have a chance of appearing in the Bloodweb of other survivors.
---
The other method is to buy the teachable unlock in the Shrine, as explained previously, although this is often considered a waste of Shards if the teachable belongs to a "free" character (because you could just grind the teachables out in a fairly short timeframe).
---
i had this one game where i was injured and ghost face was chasing me then i found the hatch right when i saw the red stain on my back
---
I missed it twice at the gate off the same hook.
---
As a David main I can back this up, also loud as hell
---
I'm super here for it, gimme the whole damn hospital
---
If I peace on piss it will cancel out
---
I agree with you. Also to all the killers camping their one hook in the basement for challenge, fuck you!
---
I only hook farm when I have borrowed time have mercy on me lmao
---
I run pop goes the weasel, dying light, play with your food, and save the best for last(sometimes rancor). Blitz early on then you've got an unstoppable snowball effect going. Especially with the jumprope and red paint brush as addons
---
In my house we love futa, but yeah there is not a lot of good futa on dbd gonewild
---
Not sure havent done a speed check in a while but I can tell you the download speed is absolute shite.
---
But the upload speed is decent enough to play games like gtao and bf5
---
Lol the japanese was so different from the text it was distracting
---
Tbh it should automatically deactivate if someone else gets hooked. You clearly aren’t being tunneled if other people are getting hooked
---
I think the Oni is definitely one of the most terrifying killers, when he screams and like charges up, it echoes throughout the entire map.
---
How dare you...
---
Pretty often. I run it on my hag sometimes but majority of the time I use it, I can reach 3 tokens. Its hard to get to 5 tokens before survivors realize what's going on. But it does slow the game down as they actively search for it, and forces them to play safer. Just dont expect the perk to carry you in game. That's where you start to get salty when they cleanse it.
---
We know what we are
---
I don’t know why this hasn’t reached hit yet because it’s so f*cking true. If only more people would realize this and try to play both sides of the game. I personally think it would be an amazing way to remove some toxicity and make this community a whole lot friendlier
---
No don't, you can just double tap shift lmao
---
Yeah somebody else mentionned agitation with iron grasp for basement control.
---
Its a great idea if i can plan out my trap at good spots  around it. It sounds like a good pressure for the survivors as soon as i grab someone. I will definatly try later.
---
I heard there is some hard achievements  about hooking in basements aswell. It could help
---
Someone’s not a hex destroyer.
---
Leatherface needs a rework tbh. This is literally the only way to effectively use his chainsaw. He's too weak to do anything else effctively.
---
Yes, the other commenter was correct. It is more so being greedy than cocky. But sometimes survivors assume I'm a baby killer so they all pile onto the hook and die
---
I love that once you’ve slammed the Hatch down, he almost kind of takes a second to process what just happened, almost makes a run for it, *hesitates*, and then finally commits
---
I havent played against an oni yet that sound scary though.
---
My biggest thing with Myers and ghost face is thier small terror raidus they just sneaky snakes.
---
They've been able to act much quicker and improve the game much better than when they were under Starbreeze. Faster content releases too.
---
XD it be like that sometimes
---
If you use M3 often it starts to break easier I think.I use it all the time and all my mice had their scroll wheel broken at some point.
---
Sophie Anderson, the next killer. Weapon: Her massive breasts
---
Very true. I don't mind putting in the work. Plus, it's just for fun. Doesn't bother me if the perk takes a minute to get.
---
Believing you are better than others because you use a different plastic box than them. Ew
---
So thats what my team is doing.
---
Kate is the clown and that’s on circus
---
Pls halp
---
Yes i do just want to casually play the game and have fun. having hard games isnt fun
---
*Whistle intensifies*
---
Demogorgon is very intimidating, I think also Myers and spirit can be scary if they're using the quiet addons (scratched mirror Myers and Prayer beads spirit)
---
But I think Kazan (The Oni) is the scariest in chase IMO
---
You know those morning hosts laughed there asses off during commercial break.  Kudos to them for staying professional on the air.  I would of lost it 100%.
---
It’s funny because the game wasn’t supposed to be a Looping Simulator. Even the loading screen tips tell you shit like “Flip pallets away from the Killer as a noise distraction!”
---
The Meta was set by the community and surprisingly it fit pretty well
---
Hey He prolly taught that skill to the spirit, he was using his ancient anime swordsmen tactics
---
I flashclicked once when Bubba was camping, I was trying to get him off the hooked survivor
---
Yeah, but who's going to waste a pallet to "distract" a killer?
---
The more you play this game the more you realize rank just means the amount of time people put into the game and not skill
---
Ps4 purple and red is super rough :( sucks
---
I hate that shit as killer, only because the sound is annoying haha
---
Why the fuck do you people complain so much?  JC! I’ve never seen such a bigger bunch of entitled whiners.  If anything farm the shit out of the trails. I’ve had so much fun and met a bunch of killers/survivors while doing the rift challenges that now I play with some of these guys (Swf).  Seriously.  Play another game and stop acting like a bunch of sissies.
---
Also if you can’t find a locker in time just stop moving and when the hook animation disappears find the nearest hiding spot. Or you can keep moving but once the hook animation disappears change directions and go the opposite way.
---
Doesn’t always work if the killer is fast or just good at tracking but it could save you.
---
I've played against Myers a few times havent had the chance for the others u mentioned 
---
Usually people play trapper doc and billy boi  when I play.
---
My point exactly. You can tell in the early stages of the game you were meant to do a LOT of off-Meta things, but the community helped shaped the game honestly.
---
As killer its completely different story, I once waited 3 hours to play against gen rushers
---
You said you were new to dbd right?, Those are like really popular among the starting players
---
The mcoy creek farm map..  when i wanna fast vault, i vacuum to the chest and start opening it, close it go to the window and vacuum back to the box and die
---
Good idea
---
Kinda figured most new players probably dont have to many killers right off the bat right? 
---
I got the special edition so I started with 6 killers.
---
get good?
---
Idk - he's the easiest to get 8k devious score using shred ability IMO.
---
Must be region because I’m on Xbox and I swear I’ve never waited more then a few minutes as Killer. My Wife killer mains and she’s matched up match after match. Survivor I swear damn near the press of the button some times and I’m matched up. 
---
We’re also not that great either. Only once I’ve gotten to purple ranks.
---
Of course the skin head is calling them blendos
---
This is so cute mg 😂
---
Gorgon ramsay?
---
Nice, Plus, since some of the killers that I stated are very underwhelming it's rare to find them, people usually play killers that are easy to learn and can seriously damage teams like Spirit and her OP power and Myers with his ability to put survivors in a bad situation
---
For me...
---
1) Hillbilly. I just know half my team will end up slugged at some point. Also theres no cooldown period with him. He hooks one then hes on top of another 5 seconds later due to his speed.
---
2) Ghostface. I just know if I get hooked its game over for me. Hes just gonna camp the hook. Likewise if someone else is hooked its a race to rush gens before someone is camped/tunneled out of the game
---
You mean the item or the map you play on. If it is the item go to load out and change the item. And if it is the map you play on there isn't a default map you play on
---
I ran into a guy hiding while I was getting chased, had no idea he was there. He threw a hussy fit. If I'm being chased, why aren't you on a gen?
---
Lol every time a David run towards me and they’ve got the killer behind them I think “this fucker better have borrowed time”... either they do and I feel bad because I bail before I notice the symbol and don’t take a free hit for em or they don’t and I rage and spectate hoping they’ll die too
---
With people like Tru3 that can hear a survivor breathe a mile away I dont think stealth was ever gonna be viable
---
Im sure that made him stand his ground even harder.
---
That works too
---
We kind of need context. If you were being toxic this is completely understandable.
---
Oh yeah I love playin the hillbilly just because he has an Instadown that's fast as fuck.
---
that looks amazing 👍🏼
---
No he literally did the same thing to every survivor. I wasnt toxic at all.
---
*gasp*
---
Nah look on youtube i didn't knew that too befor e I watched a yt video
---
They're are literally survivors who move faster than others. I'm not saying it's character specific. But there are games I catch up to survivors at normal speed. Sometimes there is a survivor I can't catch up to with out BL. Even though they run in straight line. Go ahead, the party line is they all have same speed yada yada. But it's happened to this 1000+ hour killer to know I'm not crazy. It happens. I'm on ps4 so I don't think it's hacking. Sometimes it's a meg, sometimes a nea or claud. Anyone else experience it? All this is with killers with base speed. I'm aware some killers are slower so it's not that either.
---
So like one of the first killers I tried was nurse 
---
And the first match I just ate shit and kept missing her blink. The second match i played i dominated with her it was crazy. Havent played against her yet though.
---
Yeah it's ridiculous. I never DC but j do report people who do
---
# N O
---
Yeah, You can dominate with anyone but sadly it depends on the survivors you go against
---
repost
---
You can play a custom game with me and choke me as Michael, this is even better for me
---
We have like 9 killers that are basically regular people, why we acting like Legion is the only 1.
---
Self Care is dead, but besides that nothing has changed.
---
It’s still the most used survivor perk in 2019, so either people like the convenience, or are complete morons. 
---
Iron Will is better, post pone healing and wait for the Adrenaline heal.
---
If you make to say Level 65 on Day 7, you can pay 100 auric cells to advance to the next level. So you could pay 500 auric cells ($5) to get to level 70 if you really want the rest of the rewards.
---
So how do you do an objective while holding onto sprint burst? You don't
---
If it's the item, you need to find better ones, you can also use add ons on it to give you more mappy thing, sorry not sure about this, i don't play much survivor.
---
If it's the stage, sometimes you get the same map on consecutive games, sometimes it's one you hate. Anyway if you want to play on certain map, burn an offering, it increases your chanses.
---
What killer do you like to use the most?
---
[r/missedopportunitytofallforitfool](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/)
---
Ghostface, He can be devastating if used correctly
---
I found the nurse the scariest, both by her power and her looks.
---
The hillbilly also, I don't know, he looks so massive when playing as a survivor.
---
Oh I see. Yeah that sucks.

Yes but we don’t have to wait 10+ seconds to stalk someone to attack them
---
lol ok you might need to find a new game to play then brother
---
Just for clarity, is this different from the Ayrun hook technique? I ask because that one requires the killer to actually swing, and ideally for the unhooked survivor to take the Borrowed Time hit - if they don't swing then all you end up with is effectively two survivors in the one place until ether the one on the hook dies, the one hiding in the gap gets bored/cocky, or a third survivor comes in to try and break the deadlock.
---
Nice, currently going for it and still have no luck with the Michael 4k achievement. DC's everytime.
---
Love how I'm getting downvoted just for confirming both, lmfao.
---
Brave really need to fix totem locations, but to busy nerfing pig.. nice job btw.
---
It's not just demogorgon. A lot of killers have been camping more often since the stupid rift challenges came out.
---
I could care less about karma didn’t know it was already on Reddit
---
Oh my god I haven’t seen the bucket meme in years
---
you have no idea
---
I've played against ghostface once......
---
Needless to say I died in the first 3m........ Sadly i do not have him yet. 
---
Also I'm pretty intrested in legion
---
Calm down people I didn’t know it was already posted
---
Not everyone chases an OoO player. If they're Undetectable then there's a sporting chance they don't really care, since Undetectable makes it very difficult for you to call out information (and OoO players calling out information is the expected behaviour).
---
No it hasn’t been confirmed to be happening. Only speculation. Devs have said that they want to make it happen though.
---
1. The crashed, too, are relatively rare. From what I heard, whereas rage quitting is a constant issue. The needs of the many and all that.
---
2. If you there are no servers in your region, you will play P2P and won't have DC penalties.
---
i don't have michael unfortunately but what platform do you play on? i can let you boop piggy :(
---
Nice job on that! I was looking at the background wondering wtf map that was and why don’t I recognize it. Haha.
---
The format isn't exactly correct for this joke either. Tuxedo Winnie is not discount Drakeposting. Tuxedo Winnie is about using different words to describe virtually the same scenario, action, emotion, etc. What you've done is full on Drakeposting.  
---
But that's alright, every shitposter starts out somewhere.
---
Those 40 seconds are only in white ranks, they are noobs, they don't know how to do gens well. 60 would work too.
---
SWF matchmaking has been changed some time ago, they will now be matched based on the highest ranked survivor. So if they're rank 1, 20, 12, 17, they will play against a red rank killer, meaning they'll have the slowest times (Might sound unfair to the rank 20 and 17 survivors in that group, but they still got the huge SWF advantage).
---
HuuuuWAAAAAAAAAH
---
🗿
---
I see... I might copy you and just focus on getting the easier challenges to get as many rift rewards as possible. And luckily. You can still do the challenges for lore after the rift
---
Yeah, it's hard to find a way around the massive maps without making the 0 terror radius impossible to counter at the same time...it's a shame, cause I'd like to think it was a cool idea. Maybe keep the idea of a sonar but add the terror radius and better speed? Knowledge is never a bad thing especially as killer.
---
I use dc players corpses to scratch my balls.
---
Yeah, I would probably DC if that happened. It's unfun playing a game with that bad of connection.
---
That's why I said 100% max, but as someone earlier said this would make them impossible on large maps and unfortunately there's no way to fix that without making his 0 terror radius impossible to counter.
---
I couldn't care less about healing someone most of the time as I'm usually a gen jockey but if they get hit then it shows me where the killer is if they are being chased and shows where they are dropping pallets.
---
Frequently I do.  I think sometimes it's a just very reasonable conclusion.    
---
For example, using Surveillance and Discordance coupled with BBQ gives me some pretty decent situational awareness at times.  I've been in matches where the survivors were always working on opposite sides of the match the entire game.  That could be chance.  But when you throw in Monitor and Abuse and each time you ping pong across the map the guy is off the gen and nowhere near it before you get there, it's obvious someone is calling out, "the killer is headed your way."  
---
Other times, it involves a streamer.  You can hear them doing call outs to other players, I think it's fair to conclude they're SWFs with comms.    
---
What's funny is the number of people who feel obliged to claim they are not a SWF (comms or no comms) when you already checked in the lobby and saw that they were.  Given that behavior, when I see what appears to be very tight coordination (extremely coordinated actions) in gameplay and couple that with the number of denials of SWF when you know they are SWF, I don't put a lot of stock in denials of comms.  
---
Any casual observer of this game will notice the majority of the player base gravitates to OP.  If a killer is OP, more people play that killer.  If a perk is powerful, or combinations of perks are powerful, people play those perks at a much higher rate than "fun" or "crappy" perks.  When there is a nerf to those things (powerful perks/killers), you see decreased use of them in game.  
---
The same goes for SWF with comms.  They essentially get 12 or so perks for free meaning they are going against the killer with \~16 perks each (assuming they're decent at the game and making some use of call outs).  Given that most of the player base takes the OP approach to the game, why would your SWF not use comms?  And even on a more basic level, why would you queue with friends if you weren't going to talk with them?    
---
I can see being in a SWF with comms for the intent of just bullshitting.  I've seen it in streams.  Even in those instances, there are still call outs even if it's just reflexive or not intended to gain any advantage.  E.g.  A SWF using comms and not trying to get an advantage could slip, "Damn I'm a potato.  I just wasted the God pallet" or, "Shit, I was so sure I'd finish that gen...sonuvabitch...got me at 99.9%."  Would you honestly think that isn't an information advantage for the others on comms over a solo queue and that it couldn't be used against the killer?  
---
If I heard a gen was 99 and the one I'm working on is only 10, I'm racing over and finishing that gen before it regresses back to 50% or less.  That's a huge advantage.  Or if I was getting chased near the shack with the God pallet gone and I see a jungle gym with a pallet in place, which would I go to?  The one with the pallet.  But I only knew that because my friend "potatoed" and called out that he wasted the God pallet.  Without comms, I would have gone for shack only to find out the God pallet had already been used and I would go down much sooner.
---
Legion, in their current state are very boring, it's just stab stab stab stab then chase, rinse and repeat. Theres not much to them
---
Here's my advice:
---
Play the Plague. She's an *objectively* better version of the Huntress.
---
It just will. Let it happen.
---
Borrowed Time is in the Shrine of Secrets.
---
Right on, I guess people hate the truth. Hell even the cow shed can sometimes have two broken windows. On Ormond I can get three stuns in 1 and a half tiles worth of space sometimes.
---
I don't want Doctor changed AT ALL and I became a Doctor main when they removed old Freddy.  I'd rather zero changes than any rework that changes his mechanics.
---
Oh that's disappointment alot of post make him seem like the worst killer ever.
---
Now that's a celebration.
---
Or you could just select it. Your dumbass mistake (mine too, done it twice). Ppl are dumb enough already, don’t need more autonomy.
---
As all things should be
---
I work (kinda) in retail. This joke has been beaten worse than a Nea under an Oni mori.
---
Also, yeah I know I was in that game with Zubat lol.
---
Make that a third time now....
---
I saw a streamer once hook the rest of the team and then when he went back to hook the first survivor, they still had DS. How bad is your team that all of them got hooked in under 60 seconds? Also, it should deactivate after someone gets hooked because that was ridiculous.
---
Jokes on you I run DS and Unbreakable. We're gonna go around AGAIN.

They haven't given us a definite date yet, from what I can tell. All they said is that it would go live with the mid-chapter patch, which we do expect in January.
---
I have so many questions. Why was that the only thing in chat? If yes why did he just randomly point out that he's trying to save people? Is this person a human irl? Is the picture fake?
---
Yeah, I am one of those faithful people that believe that one day they will be reworked and they'd have a good power
---
M&amp;A as well as iron will
---
They Nerfed Nurse again. Now she has one blink with the speed of 100% when blinking, and 80% when chasing survivor. She can't Lunge anymore.
---
She's still OP tho
---
lol get clapped
---
That’s so silly, just finish it and see what you can learn from it. It’s just a game
---
The mid-chapter patch is supposed to go live at the same time as the Archives next tome. As for an actual date, nothing has been confirmed yet, as far as I can tell.

Should have run with your arms flailing behind you for extra speed. You could have completely dodged that attack with that, and a belief in fighting for youe friends or something...
---
Lol love the body block. It’s like the ultimate revenge after survivors body block u at endgame all those times :)
---
Clearly you dont lean as ghost face, at least we can one shot survivors and move at normal speed while having no terror radius
---
Boil over?
---
It’s to make it look like you’re indecisive and less predictable
---
It probably wont knowing bhvr
---
Man nothing is toxic. It’s language used by people who lost a game. Don’t let a video game bother you. I mean if you’re getting upset or offended by anyone on a game just turn off your Xbox. OP you’re good you didn’t do anything
---
It's not that legion is the only human, more about their backstory. A lot of the other human killer backstories are much more disturbing. You can't exactly compare the story of like the Doctor, who tortured people for years, to 4 edgy teens
---
now never play again, or when you're about to win/lose D/C so you can keep the balance intact
---
With Serpent, you don't ring the Bell while uncloaking - and if you're combining it with Shadow Dance and Brutal Strength then it can be a bit of a shock to some survivors because you'll just chew through pallets as fast as they can throw them.
---
The most popular way to play Wraith is with any Windstorm and either Clapper add-on. Windstorm makes it easy to apply pressure across a wide area, and the Clappers make it difficult for survivors to know if they're about to be attacked or not - the Bone Clapper means *everyone* hears the bing bong, while the Coxcombed Clapper means *no one does*.
---
For perks it's Ruin, Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, and A Nurse's Calling. Ruin buys time for the first chase/hook, Thana and Sloppy make healing take *forever*, and A Nurse's Calling means you can see anyone trying to actually heal.
---
Other players prefer lethality perks and will take things like Haunted Ground and Make Your Choice over anything to do with healing. Some even just take the meta pallet option of Enduring and Spirit Fury. Your mileage may vary.
---
We can't do anything about it. He will, and we won't prevent it
---
Pick em up, get shanked, keep coming. Show those virgins who the real chad is.
---
Tip dont turn it of by throwing it out the window
---
Does a teachable perk HAVE to show up in someone else’s bloodweb eventually? Or is it just luck?
---
Great tip.
---
That's... a nice point, actually. I mean, it still doesn't help you if someone's healthy and I personally prefer Bond because it's pretty much a *very* budget Kindred+Empathy combo but now I honestly see why someone would like to use Empathy.
---
When all players are Nea, how you supposed to tel who’s who?
---
Wacky
---
someone posted a concept of her before that is well balanced. So she can be feasible.
---
It will, yes. You just can't know when. It can be the very last perk you get.
---
We got 5 killers really. Freddy’s rework is massive enough that I think he counts as a new killer. That and we got 5/6 survivors (Jane, Ash, Steve, Nancy, Yui, Bill on console) this year, not 4. Four maps from Freddy rework, 1 from plague, 1 from demogorgon, 1 from Oni. That’s six maps we got in 2019. 
---
What about this seems slow to you?
---
Yeah but you don’t have to walk around and can get an extra loop or possibly get to another loop. I’m not saying what’s the best for everyone. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
---
Were you the Bill that kept running it down? :P
---
I would say Bill after David for Borrower Time (Unbreakable too) rather than Meg. It’s too good of a perk. Adrenaline from Meg is a solid teachable, but it’s not mandatory having not is SB.
---
The Survivors always dc on me. I just gave up, don't want to get burned out cause of that tomes.
---
Clown buff ain't no joke
---
I mean, most of what constitutes "good futa" for me involves draenei so yeah. 
---
(Did I just admit that on Reddit? Fuck it, new decade new me)
---
yeah you're right - better wait til next year just in case
---
For me, the positive matches as killer vs the negative is at a ratio of about 1 in 10.  That ratio goes up to about 3 in 5 if I actively dodge SWFs.    
---
The two major factors determining positive/negative games are rank mismatches (I know ranking is far from perfect but it's also far from useless) and SWFs.  Both are factors that really shit on game balance.  RNG can be another serious factor (e.g. Yamaoka map last week literally had 5 safe pallets essentially in series perfectly spaced) but RNG being RNG, it's not as consistently an issue as rank mismatch and SWF misbalance.
---
Definitely
---
This is so sad.
---
F
---
Hey man I was suspicious of 60 seconds too, but gene you consider his restraint addon that reveals the auras of survivors upon tier-up it seems fairer. Imagine calm+restraint. You now have an inverse BBQ&amp;C with a 24m TR much of the time.
---
If that shit was any lower than 40 it’d be bonkers.

---
If the intention s to be toxic then yes, if you are using just to have fun with the killer, IE he is also playing in an entertaining way then no, it is not toxic.
---
Yes, which is why its good to make sure you're taking a perk in every bloodweb, no matter how much it sucks, just so you can't get it again and increase the odds of getting the one you actually want.

Well it's text and people don't really bother long paragraphs. Same tho, many of them are very eye opening.

[Yep.](https://imgflip.com/i/3d7are)

Idk man, I see a lot of interesting things when I play killer. I think most survivor mains are actually government programmed bots to mess with my brain
---
*super sayin cosplay*

Yeet out grasp for sloppy crows for whispers and deerstalker for noed (Run at your own risk you be hated)

On the 6th

It’s not that they don’t want to buff/nerf, it’s that they don’t want buff/nerf to be the frame in mind when making changes. If something is weak or strong doesn’t matter to them as long as it feels fair for players involved. That said, making things fairer means buff/nerf, but it’s possible to buff/nerf in unfair ways and that’s the point.
---
Also frustrating to be chasing a survivor and they are skipping all over the damn place.

[Controller Pig against mouse and keyboard survivors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz-Tixx-aDc), note that any issues affecting controllers are *universal* - if you can't flick on PC with a *base* controller, you can't do it on console either.
---
[Dash being used to destroy survivors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOA4xO2WCfU).
---
Granted, Scorpionz is likely the best Pig player in the game, but if they're regularly getting a 4k without a sniff of a regression perk then there's really no reason why a lesser skilled player can't be doing the same with more "meta" perks.
---
Yup, that first battle pass is the last I buy if things don't change, hell I play a lot less because people aren't trying to win, but finish their challenges, fuck this.
---
Oh yeah, I mean this as a whole, both killer and survivor side is fucked 75% of the time.
---
It will eventually appear. Simplest answer.
---
Lucky you. I get sandbagged by a SWF, the Killer clearly sees it, and proceeds to take advantage of it anyway.
---
Nah I was Dwight, name says zerodopamine. I got the gens done and was bored so started running behind that leatherface to get some points.  Killer went after me first then gave up then went after Zubat.
---
Don't they have literally one confirmed kill? Which wasn't even premeditated? Are they even trying?
---
I never break a totem without grunting and wailing as though I was shoving it up my ass.
---
Zubat is so good though, when he is killer he just fucks me up.
---
I always imagine they're dripping candle wax on themselves because _it hurts so good_
---
You have been banned from Dead By Daylight sorry 😐
---
Now we need shirtless Julie.
---
Bold of you to assume anyone on my team can get a gen done to activate it.
---
I usually die inside when I see them stand still. I can smell the dc coming.
---
Amanda doesn't look even half as badass as Ghostface though

The Twitch streamer Otzdarva, also known as "not Otzdarva" on YouTube. Easy to understand, lots of commentary on their videos, they did a bunch of guides, and unlike certain other educational streamers they're more than happy to "show their work" for any claims they make ingame (i.e. if Otz says he can predict which locker a survivor is hiding in while using Doctor, he'll have footage showing you how).
---
OhTofu is another good educational streamer, with a lot of videos covering looping, structures, and all kinds of essential information.
---
Be very wary about educational streamers when starting out - some are quite happy to bullshit or clickbait and will make absolutely no attempt to correct any errors when they're pointed out to them. Doesn't matter if they're always getting a 4k - if they're lying through their teeth then you're going to struggle to replicate their "success".
---
Spirit has zero. And the legion didn't become an actual gang until after crossing into the entity's realm.
---
You’re just telling the killer “hey there’s 2 more people here going for the unhook”. That’s literally when camping is the right move lol
---
Go Go Gadget Arm!
---
A pro gamer move is to use devour hope plis no one escapes death, ad a red mori for extra salt
---
Don't you dare compare this horror to the booped snoop !
---
This game doesn't have one definition of winning. There is a supposed balance point around getting a 2k, but even that is highly suspect and doesn't accurately reflect what the pip system ends up doing. There are a lot of people who play this game with the understanding that it's really easy to ruin someone's day in this game, and try to do nice things occasionally to limit that. I agree that farming is definitely dull and boring, but for some people it ends up being a needed respite to enjoy the game again.

I got in on my second try while EGC was on, I was like no joke, 6 seconds away from the entity taking the last Survivor, I was happy afterwards
---
Spirit and Plague have 0
---
Thank tou
---
So it will??? 
---
Good to know.
---
My personal opinion is that Jane has better perks, but it’s all down to your playstyle. Everyone goes crazy over ‘Any Means Necessary’, and while it is cool, it’s situational and quite overrated.
---
Happened in one of my games last night.  Luckily I was playing survivor.  
---
We spawned.  I walked 10 feet to a gen and before my first skill check, \*boom\*.    
---
Given how often it happens to me (happened actually -- I've traded ruin for corrupt intervention), I was WAY overdue for benefiting from a fast Ruin pop.  
---
Just another RNG aspect of the game that sucks and my RNG luck gives me about a 1 minute Ruin average lifespan as killer but 6 minute average lifespan as survivor.  The only benefit I've gotten from Ruin as survivor is it's slowly improving my ability to hit great skill checks.  
---
DBD design - "Hey Killer, you better use Ruin or you're likely gonna lose the match."  \*equips Ruin, match loads, 30 secs later !!BOOM!!\* "Congrats you lose anyways."
---
So is this a viable strategy? I feel like triggering the killer would create space or escape time for teammates? Or is this like a no-no?
---
Game theory: What if Spirit is actually her dad?  
---
Then I'd be right and Legion would take yet another L, meaning this is canon, of course.
---
Pop/ Whisper’s / Enduring / Thrilling Tremors (very good tracking with a bit of slow down)
---
STBFL / PWYF / Enduring / I’ll All Ears (extremely good to end chases very quick, lacks tracking unfortunately)
---
Distressing / Hex: Third Seal/ M&amp;A / Infectious (Sweaty maximum slugging, can snowball hard if the cards are played right)
---
Pretty much anything really works for him imo. I also have Enduring for most builds since it’s my “crutch” perk lmao
---
Neither of them have particularly great perks, but I’d go with Jane over Yui.
---
Depends if you want to stare at a huge ass or someone with freakishly long nails for a motorbike rider.
---
I had such a bad game as trapper that I literally punched a hole in the wall and now my parents are pissed and I have to fix it with my own money...next time I’m just going to turn off dead by daylight and do something else...
---
God damnit I wont be able to unhear it now. Thanks
---
Yeah, I agree, head on rules dude. So... Satisfying, I literally can't take it out of my build, never before got in a locker until I got it. Not going back. Every game with a head on stunned killer is a good game.
---
that shit is hilarious
---
I can't either, it's only fair
---
they do have a unique story to them though. A lot of the killer stories are rather disturbing. We have evil incarnate, abandoned and neglected children, destructive families, people who genuinely just enjoy killing, twisted minds, etc.
---
Legion shares similar traits to most other killers, with their unique feature being that he(Frank) was able to convince others to follow him in this dark path. Also noting that Legion is collectively the  youngest killer(s) we have in DBD.
