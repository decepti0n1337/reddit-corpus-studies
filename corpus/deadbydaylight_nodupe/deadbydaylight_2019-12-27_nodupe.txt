Happy cake day. If you mori with clown you get a birthday treat as well ;)

I can feel your anger. It makes you powerful, gives you focus.
---
billy does too
---
It’s a bad thing because the survivors are punished hard for having a bad teammate
---
I only spare either Life of the party Jakes, cowboy Jakes, or survs that had 2 very early DCs on their team.
---
They were overly altruistic and just saved the instant I hooked someone instead of doing gens. It gave me alot of pressure that way and little to no gen repair since they kept swarming hooks. And the 2 DC's were during their death hook animation.
---
Well it would be a good thing if survivors weren't crippled by the suicide. It's fine that the killer gets those bonuses but it's bullshit that the survivors get nothing *and* are weakened
---
I've seen so many posts about people disconnecting while the killer is doing this challenge, I only thank God for being so lucky, I did it first try without any DC except one, but the dude was already hooked for the third time and was too slow and I still managed to get it
---
Thanks for the info! I think I may go with Oni then and just buy the 10usd auric pack for Yui and Nancy lol. Those two seem fun to play.

this took me way too long to get

After several attempts on this challenge as LF I finally managed to hook all of them in the basement but guess what? The rank 19 claudette only having self care disconnected in the last second and I didn't get it. This challenge seems to be the most difficult and frustrating one. I guess I'll have to ask them if they can help me
---
It’s fun. Killer is good for solo play and survivor can be a blast if you have friends. Unlocking everything can be an insane grind though. But all around I’d definitely recommend it.
---
Huntress left a hatchet to save her spot.

I'd watch it

I want to laugh but this actually happens
---
Im buying it. You basically convert your $10 to cells so you can get the next one. But i love grinding in games so much. And pushing myself through obvious BS challenges for some reason. I only do it for the challenges. The lore is cool but i dont need it and the skins are fine but i dont do it for them. I know it sounds dumb but some of these challenges (not all of them though, some are complete shit) have the perfect amount of difficulty for me. I know i can get them done but theyre too hard to get instantly. Also the majority of the difficult ones are because of trapper, so i feel like whoever the killer is next tome will be easier. 
---
TL:DR yes i am. Challenges are fun.
---
Or the ultimate way of showing apology or pity
---
No hard, only dead.
---
No...
---
...Downing the entire enemy team because they decided to dive the basement - even as Billy who has to charge his saw then do the recovery animation - and then continued to basically run right into your face after the first down, and then after the second down, for you to actually get 3 chainsaws despite losing collision on each chainsaw in the stairs without a single one unhooking the first guy with BT/DS...
---
...Is not skillful.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That could literally never happen if the survivors were paying the slightest bit of attention to their screen or just turned around and ran out, you could certain never recreate it with the survivors literally being afk - because that's pretty much the equivalent of what they were above.
---
I'm not saying it isn't hilarious, I'm saying that 3 survivors sitting right in your face (practically afk) in the basement to get chainsawed one after another without getting a single save despite that you can't grab one while chainsawing the other or stop them from getting the unhook since you can only chainsaw one at a time and the recovery takes too long.
---
Does not require skill whatsoever, it requires potato survivors, or anti-skill.
---
I tend to just respond with “lol”.
---
It seems to get them even more enraged and gets me into a mood where I’ll just genuinely start laughing at their toxicity.
---

If you're on the fourth gen then nobody can pop the last gen because theres still the one you're on and the last one you need to do.

Ok
---
yeah but in this hell called red ranks killers can and will bubba facecamp and use a dumb excuse for that calling the survivors "ToXiC" for crouching to avoid LoS with the killer. not even t-bagging, just crouching
---
You've just committed a crime equal to treason. Do you have anything to say before your execution?
---
it would be ~cool~ to have emma roberts in the game, but out of allll the different licensed characters, people, and killers, emma roberts doesnt really make the cut imo
---
"gg ez"
---
Some of us are cool but some of us are just as bad. You never know on this sub if people will be cool or if you'll get shit on. If this sub is an example of the community being good I never want to see the fb community.
---
Try playing killer, you'll see their vastly reduced field of vision. He def did not see you, and was also a beginner killer who couldn't figure out were you were based on lack of scratch marks.
---

They wouldn't even have to 360, the camera does that when you spawn.

If it’s new perks, months maybe because Mettle of man just a few weeks back was in the shrine and Ash has been out for a while and that’s even if it’s the perk you want.

---
As a killer, there is no mercy. You can stand there and bounce up and down all day, the second you get in range, I'm swinging. Sorry, but it's literally my job to kill all of you. You can fool around and die, more blood points for me.
---
It's not a bad thing for the killer to not be punished by a shitty survivor DCing
---
I disagree on several points. First, the entire team did not dive into the basement. Let me reset the scenario because maybe I misinterpret what happened. The game starts, I chainsaw across the map (near the killer shack w/ basement), I found a survivor, downed him in less than 30 seconds of the initial chase because he was out in the open and the nearest pallet was an unsafe pallet. I hook that survivor and chilly notifies me that only one person is across the map so I immediately assume that the other two survivors are near the basement so then I chainsaw a bit further away from the shack, but not completely and as I go away the two start to go for the hook save. One of them hesitated so when I went to chainsaw back, the got caught at the top of the stairs (high IQ play), the other unhooked the survivor and I managed to M1 the recently unhooked survivor. The survivor that went for the save, went upstairs and tried to loop me around the shack in a cocky manner. I chainsawed him before he could use the god pallet. I hook all 3 and the rest you already know. Oh and this was at red ranks btw. I think the reason why you thought it wasn't skillfull is because you thought I sat at the stairs just chainsawing the survivors as they came up and that isn't the case. Hopefully this opens your eyes a little bit.

Pre-Patch Decisive Strike
---
We can compromise and have any missed ambushed that hit an obstacle be a cute oink.
---
This happened to me once by a semi(?)-popular streamer and her friends. When I called them out on it they decided to call me a virgin multiple times. As though that’s an insult or something
---
Ah, I see you are also a doctor of culture.
---
This was mostly your fault. First, why hide around the bush when you could've just kept running to a safer spot? Second, why run to the hooked survivor while being chased? If you went the other way Dwight could've gotten safe unhook, now the hooked guy isnt safe anymore.
---
Survivors can be crippled by so many forms of other survivor play. There's only so much that can be done to restrict how survivors go about playing, but it's still better than no punishment for the survivor DCing imo.
---

---
* If I blow up the generator, I say fuck it, and keep working on it
---
* Even if the killer is walking up to me, I'll keep working on a gen/opening the door if it's really close to completion
---
* I would rather kill myself than DC
---
I know these aren't the silliest rules, but I'm listing them anyways
---
Generally, yes. But if you're example of having fun is downing you're first survivor then basement/face camping, I dont understand what you're getting out of this game. I dont think you need to worry about upseting survivors but you need to respect the other side camping when you're not even losing yet shows you have no respect for survivors or their expirence. I don't care about noes or slugging but camping draws the line. I dont care if campers have fun, it's just rude.
---
wait how do you cancel the animation :0
---
I'd 100% become an Emma Roberts main.
---
I can do a *great* muscle man impersonation. Just saying that shit is dead on
---
Yes,this is a known big that can occasionally occur, they are still trying to pinpoint what causes it.
---
Ok millennial
---
Since Yui’s release I’ve been using Breakout, Dead hard, Flip Flop and Tenacity with 1 other friend running the same build. Usually try to 99 all hooks on 1 side of the map and once the killer is on that side we start dropping the hooks. 
---
Had 1 failed game against an Iron grasp / Agitation bubba and 1 Trapper with frankie’s.
---
Had 4 really good games where the killer kept dropping us or slugging knowing he had no hooks and eventually all gens got done and 3-4 of us got out the hatch.
---
Breakout is possibly the best sabo perk we’ve ever used.

Why is looping the killer and being camped clownery?
---
This is how I feel about Hooks.
---
Then your friend doesn't play very much. Overwatch definitely will penalize you for consistently leaving matches. Endorsement levels take a hit, and if you do it as often as people do it in DBD, you get hit with a pretty decent XP reduction for a set number of matches. It increases the more you disconnect, as well.
---
whats one next to demo portal

Trust me the fb community are like wild animals. You could say ‘I don’t like Nancy’s sweater’ and you’ll get replies like ‘you’re clearly a fucking idiot who never should have been born. Go to hell you piece of shit’. Honestly it’s horrible lmao! It made me appreciate the Reddit community so much more 😭

Why is this bhvr official
---
Killer is better for bloodpoint and try to do challenges while you play bring perks that increase you BP gain but I don’t suggest the on that increases terror radius and bring bp offerings
---
I don’t teabag or point at killer under any circumstance.
---
Sadly no
---
how
---
I'll keep buying it just because I'm still doing the challenges for bloodpoints. I'm already doing it, I might as well get free stuff while I'm at it. But the moment I p3 lvl 50 all my characters, I'm done.
---
Because survivors have only really earned the hatch if they got it themselves, not counting instances where a teammate (who wasn't slugged) DCed for it. (Slugs DCing for friends is fine imo).
---
Giving free hatch should be punishable by god tier survivors looping you for the rest of your days.
---
Should of not next to these loosers.... Oh baby. That's 🔥. Sexy killer.
---
Also wondering.
---
no
---
Otz would be proud!
---
How To Kill Your Father is a good one. Ending kinda sucked tho.
---
Makes her look even cuter, I can’t handle it ;-;
---
Mans off the perc 30
---
The load screen you painted even progesses at the same rate the original does
---
Honestly probably killer because your game can’t get cut short by being sacrificed or the other survivors dying. But really depends on which you’re best at so play a bit of both a find what works best for you. Also use perks that increase bp
---
I'm a friendly killer. I only sacrifice for dailys or rift purposes. Other than that I just chase them.  If they run I chase until they figure out I'm not gunna hit them but if they don't run, I just look at them, shake my head and carry on.
---
F
---
Survivor's rule book is a terrible forced meme at this point. it was funny when the animation came out, but at this point it's just another way for salty 200 hour killer mains to call survivors toxic/ entitled.
---
I have a question about this, is there a specific reason you do that after kicking a gen ? Because all i could think of was how any survivor with alert perk wouldnt set a foot near you.
---
Even more so on your cake day
---
Otzdarva is honestly a saint. He gets shafted for showing mercy so much, and yet he still shows mercy in nearly every game
---
Everyone learns differently, I learned by playing killer because I could walk around as much as I wanted and wasn’t pressured to have to run from someone, plus chasing people I learned where the hardest parts to catch up to someone/get looped around were at. 
---
You could do kill your friends and have everyone learn the map with you. I did this a lot too to learn where totems/chests spawn, etc
---
1) Play, play, play some more!
---
2) Watch content creators on YT and Twitch.
---
It’s pretty much as simple as doing those things, or just the first if watching others isn’t your thing. I wouldn’t sweat learning the maps too much; just engage with the game as much as possible and you’ll learn.
---
Opposite but equal energies.
---
as a red rank killer main since the game released... no... haunted punishes cleansing and thrill makes it infinitely harder. If the killer is slow and cant use thrill, use haunted, if not thrill is usually the way to go. Or, let it do its job, check it out when the round first starts and then let it play, it almost always gets its job done and gets a few hooks. Someone else said it should transfer to another totem, thats insane, totems shouldnt last the entire fucking game. If they were meant to be invincible they would be regular perks.
---
Billy slows down when he does his though Wraith can spam Bing Bing and not change in speed.
---
It's all just build up. No one is the damn clown until the final panel lmao. I dont see how this is so hard to understand.....
---
Aww, she looks so happy
---
Damnit now I want Ricardo in the game
---
I've been watching a lot of monto and started watching noob3 today and thanks I've played for about 5 hours today aswell
---
Just need some patience and a bit of luck. I did it yesterday with better together, prove thyself, stake out, and resilience.
---
doesn’t help that the hook animation glitches half the time so it’s not even going through you lol
---
the one thing that annoys me about this picture is the hatchet on the stool. Usually when a hatchet is lodged in an object like a log, the killer would have to be in the position of where the handle is pointing. Since the handle is facing the wall, the killer must have placed the hatchet on the stool, turned it 180 degrees, and left - which would be quite awkward to do.
---
That was boss!
---
Its in custom. Setup the killer you want etc then switch to spectate. Wait for the survivor(s); (please note you need at least one survivor for this to work) t ready up. And then do a countdown with the killer. When they ready up immediately switch from spectator to killer. 
---
Please note that this is on xbox one and im not sure if this works on other systems.
---
It also looks like you're slapping them.
---
Lol i got it because a really nice french swf let me do it
---
I love you. Thanks
---
THERE REALLY SHOULD BE A BETTER PRECEDENT ON HOW FAR YOU HAVE TO BE NOT TO GET HIT.  SOMETIMES I MISS AS KILLER WHEN THEYVE BARELY WALKED THROUGH OR ARE STILL IN THE ANIMATION, WHILE AS SURVIVOR I WILL GET HIT AFTER 3 WHOLE STEPS
---
If they're obviously a coordinated four-man in name/attire/character choice, or I think it's weird that 4 dudes with flashlights loaded in at the same time, I tend to just dip.
---
Even just casual coordination really impairs M1 or stealth killers and hex totems and makes saves and heals super-efficient, which also fucks up M1 killers, and makes them keep track of the important pallets like shack with each other.
---
If you want to 4-man you should have to go against red rank Nurses or Hillbillies or some shit every single game.
---
The dude that fell for it was completely shocked lmao
---
Bold of you to assume Survivor D/Cs actually give a shit about the Killer's experience.
---
Enjoy 😋
---
I'm guessing ruin overrules this
---
Thank you!
---
Because both sides circle jerk here and cant accept that some perks arent as good as they think.
---
That's so validating!
---
I don't play her as my main, but I usually run that hair on her when I do, and I don't have any different experience than when I play my mains (Kate and Yui).
---
I think some killers might be on the look out for you to see if you behave in a "toxic" way, but if you aren't being an ass then I don't think you'll have any problems.
---
Twitch.tv/triviumrs
---
They were on hook and their friend was waiting for GF to leave to unhook them. Goddamn, they didn't give any information and y'all are still doing backflips trying to justify toxic behavior.
---
FUCK GETTIND DAILYS FOR KILLERS YOU HAVE NO LEVELS IN. I'M IN PURPLE RANKS WITH MY KILLERS ALL MY GAMES ARE AGAINST RED RANKS HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO FINISH A LEAN AND STALK DAILY AS GHOSTFACE WITH NO ADDONS AGAINST RED RANK SURVIVORS. FUCK ME I GET BULLIED SO HARD WHEN I TRY TO PLAY A KILLER I'M NOT GOOD AT. CAN WE PLEACE GET SEPARATE RANKING FOR EACH KILLER? PLEASE BEHAVIOUR I'LL SUCK YOUR DICK IF I CAN PRACTICE ALL KILLERS EQUALLY...
---
How about we just don't tell people what to do.  Period.
---
Mine is definitely Plague, but I might be biased since she's my favorite killer to play in general
---
You should have had a killer in there reading a book called "how to kill 101: for dummies"
---
And one reading "Sun-Tzu: The art of - war- killing"
---
DBDGonewild would like to know spirits location
---
I think they thought this was a killer post
---
Has this actually happened to anyone 😂
---
i'm main nea and i can tell you this is absolutely true in my case. when i was a meg main i wasn't tunneled that much or even chased in the whole trial but since i main nea with her pink hair and cool cosmetics things have changed for me drastically. i think it's because they think you will be toxic or something like that... not sure tho, that's my theory.
---
Never underestimate Pizza Dwight cult.
---
Don't listen to them (they are the Gremlins of the community)
---
Hahaha nice one 😂!
---
No you cannot sadly, also Freddy doesn’t even exist on switch not sure how he would work as PC has him.
---
Split the effect over multiple totems (3 mabye) and with each cleansed the effect is weakened
---
Alrighty, thanks!
---
How? They are still giving up on the game. The only person it helps is the killer by getting blood points. I don't want to waste my time trying to save someone who doesn't want to continue in that particular match.
---
Right now there's only one tome with 4 levels
---
Holy shit you gave me a reason to play doc again!
---
My little brother bought be DBD socks from their website. I love the idea, and I love socks like that. But I went to put them on and I’m a big guy -260lbs and 6’1”- and they just stretched so much, and were so tight that when I took them off they were permanently messed up. He pretty much bought himself a gift as he’s smaller, and doesn’t have size 14 feet 😂
---
Some people would gladly pay 50k bps to downrank on purpose.
---
..skrEEEEEEEE
---
Hell. I still have a Cannibal Splinter on the Cannibal.
---
Think of it as the other side of the coin for killer who STILL tunnel/ camp survivors at 4 gens left when they know that they have rift challanges
---
Toolbox addon, you can fix a pallet (new ultra rare, one use like an insta on a medkit)
---
Wow cool bro! My favorite part is you telling them all they blow!!!1! (especially when only one of them was trash talking)
---
Seriously don't bother posting this trash, the mods are pretty good at keeping up with it.
---
I've seen pts get entity displeased with 4ks.
---
Would you be fine with an increase in DC rewards for the players who stick it out? DC penalties seem to only really benefit the killer. The survivors who would normally DC will now just suicide on hook.
---
I hit the person pointing, because snitches her stitches.
---
After I got 2 stuns I started to take hits at pallets so that I can stun them during the recovery. Remember it doesn't actually need to stun them, as long as you get the stun score event it'll count
---
I was hoping they released a survivor challenge that you couldn't do if even one player disconnected at any point within the match.
---
Like "Get 6 safe unhooks in one trial" or something.
---
Because Six Feet Under. x:
---
That makes sense, thank you for your answer!
---
I gotta ask, is this for sale?
---
Sounds like you've been pointed at while immersed too.
---
Tunneling is fine there is nothing wrong with it. Let people play how they want as long as its not cheating/rule breaking.
---
Perk 1: can we fix it
---
Perk: we get the job done
---
You gotta put "/s" on this sub or people that literally think that will pile on lol
---
Yeah that’s what I’m scared of! I main Steve and Nancy now, they’re pretty harmless characters but yeah Nea has a reputation (wrong if you ask me, I genuinely barely see any toxic Neas). Thanks for letting me know!
---
“When you have to slug to win”
---
Well ya sometimes you do.....and? Lol
---
Ghostface just because he's my favorite killer lol.
---
But survivors are pretty toxic. I have never seen a toxic killer yet I’ve seen so many survivors who have a fit and call the killer literal slurs over them having a little inconvenience during the match
---
It does a spirit
---
What was Michael reading? Or was he just sitting there
---
I main huntress and I feel so scared to actually try and kill people because I’m afraid I’ll get bullied and yelled at afterwards 😔
---
Licensing issues.
---
You're welcome!
---
&gt;hit someone fairly 
---
They do. Their weapon hitbox is just the same size as the average killer hitbox, so it doesn't visually match. People don't expect it because they're smaller.
---
Huntress. She's so complex as a Killer with the lullaby, the feral animal hunting instinct and the brute strength. There are so many dimensions to her that truly make her memorable and unique (and without relying on sexualization)
---
For me killer queues was super long until I hit about rank 13ish. I think low rank has an abundance of killers.
---
If you want faster queues as a low rank killer I'd recommend queuing late at night, that's how I managed to avoid the 30 min queues to rank up my killer. At least in EU
---
Plague
---
Yeah blame the community for not policing itself instead of the game mechanics. You started the revolution lol
---
Just be toxic so the killer will hate you to increase the odds of face camping
---
&gt;Here's  the bottom line, even if people end up suiciding on hook instead of just hitting the leave game button, that means in a worst case scenario, the same number of games are going to be ruined.
---
Then why put a DC penalty in. The match is still ruined, maybe giving the players a more generous amount of blood points for DCing players would be a better solution. I think having a "ranked" and "casual ranked" lobby might a good solution too. But, it might be difficult figuring out some more benefits than "You get a DC penalty" for the ranked lobby.
---
Honestly after play more games after this doing what survivors want and having them still say you camped because you kill them, Im like screw that. Im going to play to win just like them. When I play survivor I will play to win as well.  Camping , and Tunneling are all part of the game the point of being a killer is to kill the damn survivors. The point of being a survivor is to hide, run, and do objectives. All these dumb rules people have made up are just that dumb. Let's tell the Lakers they cant just keep passing the ball to Lebron, or tell A NFL quarterback he cant keep throwing to the side that has the weak corner. Grow some people.  Stop complaining!
---
Exactly. If I go to a hook where someone was unhooked and the same person is healing under the hook. Am I just supposed to turn a blind eye? Also i run into so many players who go for the unhook right in front of me mid chase without perks like borrowed time. I end up downing the savior, and (obviously if im trying to win) I also down the one that was unhooked.
---
I love how your team is getting fucking massacred in the background lol
---
Indeed
---
Thank you
---
I have a bit of a love hate relationship. Fun at times and annoying at others. Still reccomend
---
I'm sad that there's no Clown reading Chemistry 101 or Legion all grouped up huddled over The Anarchist Cookbook but it's still very pretty.
---
tbh i was scared at first too hahahaha but you get used to it, and it helps you to improve in mindgames cuz you have the killer behind your ass the majority of the trial 😅 and same here, i don't really see toxic neas (well i play in console) but they can get too annoying with lanterns... other than that i think they're harmless. and np!
---
You cant be telling the truth.
---
The people of dbd reddit assured me there’s never a good reason to disconnect! They wouldn’t lie to me!!
---
Chucky would be a good killer tho it’ll be very different compared to the other killers
---
Joke's on you.  Yui simply took the toxic place of Nea
---
Feng is still bae
---
I agree
---
And Feng fucking dab.
---
Legit had someone run away from the hatch after I let them wiggle out of my arms on top of it. I was so tempted to just not take them back to the hatch when I downed them again
---
Doesn't matter to me, if 85% of my games doesn't have some little bitch ass rage quitting. I move on to the next game, I love forgotten the last time someone quit in my game. I don't care
---
We got cells back for doing this one so the next one is free to me. I'll just keep doing every one due to that.
---
Idk why anyone would just stop you're heavily rewarded for chaining the grind season to season.
---
twitch.tv/triviumrs
---
Hopefully if I just never bring flashlights I should be okay😂 I play console too! God I hope they don’t tunnel me. I’m okay at running the killer but I prefer not to have too much killer agro, I prefer playing stealthy 😁
---
that's what i wanted to say but i didn't find the words in that moment ;_;  thanks for confirming it!
---
We don’t want a 2’5 doll running around
---
No perk is necessary.
---
Its a good perk that buys you extra time if it stays up. That's it it's not a must run you win a lot with most killers at any rank without it.
---
r u sure
---
I'm not proud of it, but bond helped me lead the killer to the survivor and take over their gen to finish the challenge.
---
it's better to prevent 😂 i truly hope they won't tunnel you, as long as you play normal you should be okay... like i said i noticed it even playing the same way you do but once you're used to it you won't have problems with that. it's not exaggerated 😊

When I needed my four pallets in one game I didn't think any Killer would be silly enough to walk into four pallets and by 2 or 3 they would absolutely figure out not to follow the Dwight through a pallet. So I was trying to get killers to farm it by motioning come here, they didn't wanna play ball so I got it the old fashioned way on a spirit of all things.

happened to me once. i got a gen completed, then looped the killer for 4 gens and the killer finally downed and hooked me after the last gen popped. i had kindred so all my teammates knew the killer wasn't camping the hook or anything and they all just left me to die. i was so salty in the end game chat. i black pip'd cuz of it when imo i did all the hard work or keeping the killer occupied
---
I'm disappointed Michael
---
Of course not. You are doing right. There's something some "extra official" forms of "communication" in game, like a survivor blinking the flashlight just to annoy the killer, or crouching repeatedly near the exist, for the same purpose.
---
I'm also new, started a couple weeks ago. If you want someone to play/talk about the game, PM me.
---
Ruin can be incredibly useful for deterring survivors from repairing, since most survivors don’t want to deal with Ruin and will search for it rather than work on generators. 
---
Of course, due to your high rank, survivors will have more experience against common perks and will likely be in SWF groups, so feel free to mix up your perk choices.
---
Now that really is a nerf
---
Yeah, I was gonna lead into that.
---
I gave up on the challenges quite a while ago. I don't want them to tell me how to play.
---
Yes. Please tell me more.
---
Why post this 3 times though. It's spam.
---
That’s solo for you
---
I half-agree. As someone who plays both sides equally I know the pain of both sides. If I can let the other side have fun without compromising my own fun then why not?
---
If no gens are done and a survivor goes into struggle on the first I’m gonna slug them the next time I down them.
---
Luckily I got the challenge done early before people realized how much disconnecting fucked me over.
---
I won’t be because i really hate the grind in here. Haven’t even finished tome 2, it feels way too tedious
---
How Halloween should have ended
---
Even satan frowns on swf death squadrons
---
Huntress, fewer letters she doesn't know :)
---
Nope, I assume all killers run it so I run an anti-totem build and break ruin within a couple of mins.

There isn't a rule book. It is an unwritten rule. If you Kobe from a 4% chance it should be respected because the chance is so slim. Otherwise there is no point in struggling at all and the Kobe should be scrapped unless a perk is used. I have been playing DBD since early 2017 I respect the 4% unless it isn't a 4% (was a luck offering used or deliverance used?) If the entity likes you enough to give you the RNG I am not going to immediately smack you, and if you are the last one left you are getting the hatch.
---
Play however you want that is just how I play it. I don't know when it came about just like I don't know when hook gymnastics became a thing but most people know what "respecting the 4%" means. I am not saying you have to I was just saying that he wouldn't have.
---
Have you heard of the new flashlight addon?
---
Its called DC it forever blinds the killer
---
Oh don’t worry, today I got a 4K as nurse and got 1 DC and they messaged me “reported for hacking enjoy the van, we all reported you”
---
Now, this is perfect sourcing.
---
This is fine.
---
I used fixated solely for the faster walking speed. Easier to lose/hide from killers this way, and to me, its a better version of Urban Evasion.
---
Well played sir
---
Let's not forget Lery's, which is large enough that even "adjacent walls" is practically across the map for purposes of gate opening, and most of the time it's opposite walls.
---
I need to pay attention to that more 😅
---
I don't really understand with this community plus I think some dbd streamers are slightly worse
---
I don't get the joke, can someone explain?
---
Based on when the game fucking works. Otherwise Myers in his current state is a C tier due to his stalk not working 90% of the time it needs too
---
I think Tru3Talent and Scott can be babies at times but I still keep NDA like both of them
---
I want a point down emote for killers just so I can be toxic like in Dark Souls
---
wtf is this UI
---
It's purely based on region and platform. In eastern US on ps4 for example my killer que times are quite literally instant. Survivor on the other hand is 5min+
---
This is some ascendent sh*t right there
---
I'm posting this to get some feedback as to what I should be running on/building Doctor for. I know Distressing is good for him, and STBFL is my favorite perk, but I'm not sure what to run in the other two slots. Plus, are those add-ons good together? I try to get survivors up into madness as quickly as possible, but my shocks seem to take forever in getting them there. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
---
There is no joke
---
Ps4?
---
If you DC on the hook in the basement it absolutely should count. I'd argue it should count if you DC on the basement steps but let's be honest, there's no way these devs implement that in a clean way.
---
 [http://www.dbdbuilder.net/](http://www.dbdbuilder.net/)
---
so what have u been smoking?
---
I can't really say about them since I never watched them
---
I just wanted to echo what has been mentioned here and add a bit of my 2 cents. Play the killers that you enjoy playing. Yeah you technically won’t win as much, but it will force you to get a better fundamental understanding of the game by playing those more “basic” killers. I also don’t find nurse, billy, spirit to be that fun so I don’t play them. 
---
One last thing. You’re still very new to the game compared to almost everyone you will go against. So don’t sweat it. This game is a constant learning process. I have probably around 600 hours on killer and I’m still improving. Once you get some powerful perk builds on your favorite killers you’ll notice a pretty solid difference as well.
---
No problem! Always glad to clear that up.
---
The best is the activation notice as you bleed on the ground.
---
FunGoose is the best content creator in the community, he is BY A LONG SHOT the best killer in the entire game and also I feel like he is one of the best survivors too
---
The issue is that some aspects of the game are tied to the framerate, I remember a while ago Deliverance didn't work if you had uncapped frames for example. Best to keep it at 60.
---
uhhh... ok man. lol
---
Gotta love the French
---
Survivors
---
Yeah! I really wanna get the perks but it’s annoying that I have to put blood points into killers I don’t ever play just to get them! But thank you! This was really nice advice! 
---
*hugs*
---
understandable claud is smart when it comes to bushes
---
I never heard of him before?
---
How didn't she see him standing there (right at the end)? Lmao
---
It's not camping if you're farming your teammate, dumbo. &gt;:(
---
What else am I gonna do? Let you both get away?
---
Okay but imagine him having the highest terror radius out of all the killers with such a tiny body
---
And Nord_VPN of course
---
Most people haven’t he’s not too big but he is by a long shot the best killer in the world, he is almost flawless and he mainly plays plague he has 4k’d 120 times in a row as plague without add-ons. He also plays a nasty bubba
---
Helping the killer by not robbing them of their triggers is a pretty straightforward answer
---
The legion finally living up to their name
---
Would you mind elaborating as to how the issues with not having disconnect penalties far out weigh the issues with a penalty? I think a better solution would be to grant more BP to the players who stay in game. Someone who wants to DC will end up killing themselves on hook which renders them just as useless as if they DC'ed. Another example of where I believe the DC penalty would make the game worse is when you encounter a glitch that renders the match unplayable. I've ran into these before and I'd hate to have a time based penalty (I assume this is what the people who want a DC penalty would like) because I didn't want to wait 10-20 min for the end game collapse.
---
Personally in NA servers on Xbox, i’ve had 0 issues finding games since after the Ghost Face release bloodhunt.
---
That sounds really amazing
---
I'd rather have them get punished for the DC than not.
---
https://youtu.be/V2DXOvsjrXM if you want to check him out
---
I don't get how the website is 20 years older than the game lol. Just design your build in the KYF lobby.
---
Thx you my dude
---
why the fuck did u post this like 3 times
---
honestly i’ve had 0 issues with killer que times since the Ghost Face release bloodhunt. Those times were *very bad* 45min-1hr waits that weekend.
---
Fine.
---
If the killer is chasing you, your job is to lead them away from the hooks or away from the gens. In this case being selfish (wanting the unhook) screwed the person on the hook, screwed your team and got you downed.
---
I wouldn't compensate for alert either you might see that perk once every millennia if you're lucky
---
regular matchmaking bc BHVR can't make a consistent one
---
Yeah not overall great but it CAN be good on its own. It’s just way too situational on what map it is, where and when you vault.
---
Would you mind explaining what you mean by "robbing them of their triggers?" 
---
Would more blood points for the players who don't quit be a better option? 
---
What would like to see in a DC penalty? Time based and how much time?
---
He has a twitch too in case you watch that too
---
There are no slowdown perks with this. Given that you have SF/End combo, you should have to trouble catching survivors. STBFL is best when used with a killer that can injure without reducing stacks (pig/demo). Personally I would trade out STBFL for ruin or corrupt intervention as doctor has a bad early game. Distressing can be good but is best when used with overwhelming presence but can be a solid choice alone to get solid madness procs.
---
The wild survivor is a very in-eloquent beast
---
Playing against a dude way better than you in a game like League is also very unfun. They still penalize you for DCing. 
---
It's crazy to me how hard this community acts like being salty is a reason to DC.
---
I would imagine the middle finger emoji about sums up what he said haha
---
So Reddit was saying I didn't post it so I just gave up after I pressed the same button 5 times
---
for my trapper it is 100% needed even if it lasted for 15 seconds in rank 5 bc at least in 15 seconds I can place maybe 2 traps if some good loops are abled to be trapped
---
Apparently it posted multiple times
---
Honestly i feel like the killer got completly fucked there and didn't deserve a 0k here, but great escape none the less.
---
well about 70% are shitty parents maybe 80% with Wraith and Hag being the 20% these numbers dont need to add up
---
I tried to get into trapper but the set up period just destroys me . I always spend to long trapping
---
Sorry Reddit was acting like I wasn't posting it the first time so I did it three more times and is still wasn't showing it posted and once I checked back it posted all the times I tried
---
Streamers are 90% salt, especially when they're survivors. I don't stream snipe, but I do go back and watch VODs to listen to how much shit they talk, especially if they were salty in the post game lobby. If they were a good sport on the other hand, I usually toss them a follow.
---
Plague🖤
---
*gay men everywhere agree*
---
&gt; I legit just got this challenge and finished it on the first try because  when I hooked one survivor, two other survivors came in for the hook  rush save. Unfortunately for them, I managed to down them quickly before  the save because I was billy. When I hooked all 3 in the basement, the  last survivor gave up and crouched in front of me. It was almost a  christmas miracle that none of then dc'd and I managed to do it on the  first try. Hell, the gens were barely touched. 
---
This what you said.
---
&gt;two other survivors came in for the hook  rush save.
---
Well this isn't possible unless the second survivor goes afk and refuses to do anything, Billy's recovery animation after the first chainsaw is **too long to deny the second survivor either unhooking or running away** even if you're running the instant-saw addons, but especially if you're having to charge the chainsaw up fully.
---
Then you said:
---
&gt;  the last survivor gave up and crouched in front of me 
---
This isn't functionally different than setting a rock on your CTRL key and going afk.
---
So basically you have one successful chase resulting in a hooked survivor (which while decent, is generally pretty inevitable due to Hillbilly's movement speed and instant-down), one survivor who runs straight into your chainsaw before you leave, and two survivors who refuse to dodge/unhook and just stand around waiting for it.
---
That's what you indicated happened.
---
Good morning, sluts
---
I have 4k'd and dropped before so the meme has some truth to it
---
DAMNNN.
---
Pretty nice, but I'd swap distressing out for something that will slow the game down
---
Right?!
---
I'm posting this (again...) to get some advice as to how to play/build Doctor. Is this build any good? I'm not sure what to put in the last two slots, since I heard Distressing is good on him and STBFL is my favorite perk. Plus, I'm not sure if the add-ons I chose are any good. Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated.
---
His stain will be bigger than the lil fella
---
TOOOT
---
sometimes tunneling is completely needed to regain control over the game as a killer what is "okay" is blatantly subjective and no u can't bring up camping or face camping bc 1. camping is fucked nobody can decide what is actual camping anymore 2. face camping is a complete waste of time so that is not even up for discussion 
---
Moral of the story is it fun to be tunneled no is it fun to lose bc u had to play "nice" no is it fun to just play ur best yes at least for me
---
Had this on Michael,then got No one escapes death at level 5 with sloppy at level 9,safe to say this build is filthy even tho I'm only rank 18(new player but watched dbd for about 1-2 years now)
---
Yeah, I think most people have until they learn the mechanics, but it's not a common problem.
---
Thought this was finna be a pun lmao
---
Theres legion mains, then there's degenerates. The ones obsessed with susie are degenerates.
---
u have to spend like a whole gen to trapping just to gain a chance at winning. The games where I haven't had time to set up I have lost so u either have to try and win in mid game or end game or get lucky and win early game
---
That's just your personal experience, not only can killers be complete toxic waste dumps in the end game chat, but they actually have the pwoer to completely ruin the experience for any player they choose by camping/ tunneling them. 
---
And just to be clear, camping/ tunneling survivors where there are still &gt;3 gens left IS toxic. There's no argument there. Maybe if there's 1 gen left and you're getting bullied, but otherwise there is no excuse other than to be toxic.
---
I had a really intense hag game on one of the big corn maps. My ruin got cleansed after a minute or so and gens started flying but I still managed a 4k after all gens were powered.
---
As the game finished I was prepared to see a nice little shoutout from the entity on how well I did getting a 4k even with gens flying so fast, but all I could see before me was a simple Brutal Killer.
---
I don't care too much about the ranks in this game but that was an intense game that I played pretty well got close to 30k points but apparently that wasn't enough for lord entity. To be honest I got a bit miffed.
---
go back and read my full length story, you missed it.
---
Guess Bubba's ability to apply gen pressure is shit, (and no I haven't got ruin on him yet)
---
That we are legion ability could just be like the spirit by faking it
---
Sometimes u just have to tunnel to get a player out of the game to have more control
---
Cheers for the advice
---
Someone uses distressing and coulrophobia while playing against mess doctor and it was aidddds.
---
Maybe try adding that perk in somewhere if you have it unlocked?
---
There are no "unwritten rules". A killers job is to kill, a survivors job is to survive.
---
Uhm, excuse me
---
But r/ what now?
---
Exhaustion perks are pretty worthless at this point, but they have to stay that was because coordinated SWF groups abuse them to the max.
---
Perhaps, pm me.
---
I'm suddenly very attracted to Doctor.
---
I get Nurse dailies a lot. It's horrible as I'm on the Xbox version but I can play her to some degree. 
---
P.S. she can't blink through the statues on Sanctum of Wrath
---
How can you tell that person is on death hook?
---
Doctor practically has no power. I mean, his power is there but it's just a mild slowdown (even worse than pig's). The vault interrupt is too inconsistent to rely on. My point is, you need slowdown. All the slowdown you can possibly get. And you will NEED to 3-gen, so pack for that.
---
Which brings me to the build: Pop, Ruin, Sloppy, and Brutal Strength. If you need BBQ for points, drop Sloppy or Brutal.
---
my feelings I hate it I hate thinking he will technically be the biggest DBD creator if he continues *I think don't quote me on that but I imagine he is pretty fucking big* my thoughts are okay fine more players ig but how many of them are gonna be toxic 12yrolds making survivor in low ranks fucking more impossible bc u can't tell people NOT TO FUCKING MAKE IT A 3 GEN EVERY FUCKING GAME STOOOOOP
---
as someone who's used legion... just don't, his ability is high risk low reward and makes games take forever
---
Well then
---
don't thank me thank Otzdrava the best trapper I know
---
Micheal was breathing heavily while John carpenter tuned his instruments feeding Michael cheese cubes
---
Look at that one member who loads faster than anyone else
---
a mori at the first level, you’re lucky
---
How?
---
I see you are a man of class as well , otz is the goat
---
legion is fun to run fast stab faster but he is weak Sussie is cute don't expect a easy win expect a hard time and to feel powerless plus the best advice I can give is stab everyone as much as u can and never get tunneled visioned bc remember legions power does fuck all for chasing
---
A pun you ask for. Go to r/dadbydaylight and you'll find plenty of them
---
Oh christ yes. He's one of the worst killers right now, hands down. But, take a look at the Emblem system:
---
[https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Killer\_Emblems](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Killer_Emblems) 
---
generally speaking, you just need to make sure you hook everyone as close to 3 times each as possible, and prevent the gens from going too fast.
---
There is only 6 killers realistically who can be used for the challenges. It would most likely continue to be free killers because it wouldnt make sense to buy the rift pass and have a challenge for a killer you dont own.
---
Broken bullshit is what that is.  You lost, but there's so many second chance perks the killer has to watch you at all times or you'll escape when you have absolutely no business escaping.
---
Ok. Thanks! I look to make them more unique.
---
Legion is a bad killer sadly. They have the best cosmetics imo and I hope they get a rework soon. He got a slight nerf with stbfl recently and it's sad to see them go down the drain. That being said I still have some fun games with legion. He can slow down the game and apply a good amount of map pressure. He lacks in lethality tho. Whenever you first encounter a survivor use your ability and try to stab all the survivors with your one power then try to make your way back to the first person or stay on the last one. You can use your power again to catch up to a healthy survivor and stay on them after that. You really need to learn to mind game with legion as they are a m1 killer. As for builds. Running a anti healing build is probably the most popular. It has perks like thana,coulrophobia,dying light,etc. There is also a build using the new oni perks. Have fun😁
---
This would probably be 100x better if the template had all those makeup edited out until the last frame, and he's just putting on nothing.
---
I have plans on getting calling already(and probably ruin)it's just I'm trying to focus on getting a stable build on Myers before getting perks from other killers as even getting to level 15 on Myers took ages. However I will take this into consideration,as I didn't think of monitor or brutal strength.
---
When survivors are playing against the doctor, they will start hallucinating and seeing illusions of the doctor standing still in random places. OP stood still like one of the illusions (and also had a perk that made his terror radius/red stain go away after standing still for a bit) so the survivor thought OP was an illusion.
---
Had a moment yesterday where I spawned on the totem, messaged the killer (I'm on console) saying "I feel bad but I need the escape..." And broke the totem. Then haunted grounds procced...and he proceeded to kill everyone else on my team except me (not on purpose...I hid like a little bitch :3)
---
I don’t know what’s with survivors today. Earlier I played a match and the obsession got downed in the first minute on the opposite side of the map. I started to head for him until I realized it’s was the Oni soft camping him. 
---
So he gets to struggle stage before anyone gets him. Shortly after I get hooked and he gets downed and death hooked.
---
Proceeds to send messages berating is because he’s unlucky AND bad. I could help by laugh at him in messages
---
I saw the nemesis pwyf build but I don't see a reason why it's better than enduring spirit fury
---
Should be more along the lines of when the skill check doesn't pop up red
---
Oh we love inconsistency
---
Absolute gamer moment. a pink key too.
---
And I’m the pig that gave up, only to give you the hatch and let you boop me.
---
Tried to introduce 3 new people to the game thanks to game pass. At lower ranks tunnelling was the name of the game for killers which I get... but those 3 players are never coming back as they never got to truly experience the game or get to grips with characters and perks.
---
\*loud tiger roar\*
---
Fuck survivors

I loved tree world as a kid, and I never knew that behavior made it until about 5 seconds ago.

I wish I was that lucky
---
Even the grunting? Or is that just me?
---
I would say for the first one maybe if a injured survivor is working on a gen the gen is highlighted for something/something/something I am not good with numbers but that would be a bit more unique
---
Pretty sure in this instance it's higher ranks which is fine.

OP appears to be talking about the 16 to 20 range when it comes to ranks.

Scream queens is coming back though. It's been confirmed. 👍
---
Xbox is so 50/50. I’m a pretty level headed guy, and usually I message a killer that I had fun against, and put up a fight “GG”. As a killer if a survivor is just being a good sport, looping me well, and not being toxic I’ll also hit em w a “GG”
---
Dude gave trapper some cake god damn
---
doesn't matter if a person understands the situation then any choice the killer makes is fine if ppl didn't take this game so seriously I would agree tunneling is not okay but there are no rules here. 
---
I am guilty of being in the tryhard squad sometimes but I love this game and making smart choices and good mindgames and such is what makes me wanna play which is why I disagree with this post.
---
I don't think u can argue that a new player won't understand bc if he/she understands many players bad then they understand why tunneling can be a good choice and plus in low ranks nobody knows wtf they are doing I haven't seen a single salty or toxic survivor or killer in low ranks and I am a low rank survivor usually killer main at rank 3 and not a single time from my play time have I seen a rank 15+ act like a cunt bc he didnt have fun.
---
maybe just me tho
---
Yes they work together but surge and overcharge doesn't
---
No ruin
---
E N T I T Y  D I S P L E A S E D
---
pretty sure there are 66 killer perks or something like that as for a spreadsheet u could make one DBD wiki has all perks for killers for u to just copy and paste
---
Your hatred can be a weapon if you can control it...
---
Thank you much!

Huntress’s parents weren’t bad whatsoever. In fact the absence of the huntress’s mother is what drove her insane and made her a killer
---
I know right? I loved that shit on my first phone. Who knew I'd be playing a horror game made by the same company
---
This is hilarious
---
Shroud of separation hitting hard
---
OH I misunderstood it, I thought it meant "please release me from the hook" but it actually means "please don't release me from the hook. My bad.
---
Dwight ain't at fault here.
---
A) there were better places to hide around there or you shoulda kept running.
---
B) you lead the killer to the hook at a crucial point in the game leaving a survivor hanging.
---
C) You prevented Dwight from rescuing said survivor when you lead the killer to the hook instead of leading them away.
---
D) Dwight had no need to honour the right of way since you were the one that potentially screwed over two other players.

---
It sounds mean but yeah... ladies first don't count when the name of the game is not to get slaughtered and the lady in question is making 3 or 4 rookie mistakes within 40 seconds and then blaming others for their demise.
---
ruin, thanato, discordance, bbq,
---
try to keep everybody injured so u get the most out of thana, discordance can help u find some survivors to stab early, and also prevent gettin genrushed, bbq just for the points, u can change it if u dont like it, dont expect a 4k every game, cause u wont, u will keep them injured/healing, so you can down them in one hit or gain some time while they heal, its not a really complex killer actually, u gonna learn better by just playing
---
I think bc the game is heavily unbalanced from maps to perks to killers so ppl take it upon themselves and set some guidelines how to not piss someone off usually I follow them but when u get to high ranks ppl don't give a shit. 
---
But bc the game being this unbalanced it makes sense for us to go "okay guys lets not facecamp it is rly unfun and some killers make it impossible to counter if they time their attacks and wait X amount of time to counter our perks" *I am not getting into the grit about how to counter facecamping this was just a example chill*
---
I mean where was her dad shame on that daddy
---
1) I've seen him get real salty
---
2) He's used to other people not liking him.
---
they "made totems not able to spawn in sightlines of survivors" the air quotes are important here
---
I wasn't paying a huge amount of attention (just threw 1 mill bloodpoints into him) but I definitely got Pop, Ruin and some other good ones before 15!
---
What was strange hower... is I never got Legion's main powers to appear in his own web. Literally I unlocked some of them before they appeared in his bloodweb (or it seems that way as they're all level 1 except for mad grit at level 2, at Web 39).
---
Honestly, going by this subreddit I’ve seen waaaay more salty killers trying to impose rules on survivors rather than the other way round.
---
Might make one and just drop it here if anyone else wants to possible keep track of where they stand. I know it could be useful as sometimes that one perk you want just won't show up.
---
I love it that people think their opinion means the world and they tell u you’re undeserving . I legit basement hooked all but one and she was running far away from basement and I kept trying to take her and she would wiggle off and eventually I gave up and killed her. She said she wasn’t going to let me do cause I didn’t deserve it after I played good match without ruin and won
---
I figured 😂
---
"tIer lIst baSeD oN hOw mAny kIlleRs kIll pEoplE"
---
no, they butchered his turning radius in demon dash or any attack it is stupid any 90-degree angle could just be a fucking wall bc it is already hard to fucking see the damn survivors but wtf I can't get around a 90-degree wall idk why the devs did this bc he was fine on PC they should just have made his turning better for console instead of fucking it for PC
---
Ah, touche.
---
Sprint Burst can be really useful and I feel is a lot more consistent than dead hard. I can use it to do generators in sketchy areas and still make it to a pallet with the boost. You just have to be smart about when you run though because you don't want to walk everywhere, just sometimes.
---
I wish I could get those perks but so far I'm trying to get a stable build on Myers before even having the idea of leveling others past 1.
---
Enduring and spirit fury are completely different. They are used to get stunned by pallets and recover and then eventually ignore every 3rd pallet. nemesis makes it so everytime you get stunned the person you are chasing becomes  oblivious. Some backstory, the old legion made the mend timer go down with every stab so you could keep stabbing one person while in ff and they would eventually go down because their timer would go down. New legion cant do this because the timer will not go down while in terror radius. So... if there is no longer a terror radius because of oblivious, then, you can keep stabbing while in ff and the timer will go down
---
Idk why would you want enduring on myers but there are apps on the phone with everything in the game as well as websites
---
As a Trapper fan girl, I concur. 😏
---
At least that's how it was in ptb idk if it is still like that. Here is it bring explained https://youtu.be/OgSkP4bZy9o
---
OP? not even u can easily work through a hex ruin and yes good players do use it personally I use it as a distraction play for my trapper and a general slowdown for every other killer trust me in high ranks this perk gets broken like 10 seconds into a game and if u combine it with TOTH then ur choosing to waste time for a okay gen slow down perk that doesn't do that much if survivors can hit greats
---
Shaggy should be a killer
---
LOL, they don't work like this any more, and I primarily used them to scare streamers with face cams lol
---
Isn't in unbalanced for both sides depending on perks and maps though.  From what I've saw some maps are killer sided, others are survivors and some are mxied depending on the killer also?
---
Even spwans of doors are random, sometimes they spawn opposite sides of the map (oh no a surv sided spawn), other times they spawn super close (wait..so killers get a good spawn too?!?!?) and others it's a good middle ground.
---
There's a lot of RNG that goes both ways in this game and some which are clearly tilted towards the others but the game IS still fun.  
---
Like I hate Ruin but that's because I haven't sunk enuogh hours into the game yet to Great Skill check everytime or at least 90% of the time do I think it's unbalanced?  No?  If you are good you can play around it.  there's even a perk that helps you deal with it.  (Wow a counter perk almost like there's quite a few of these)
---
Not directing any of this at you just making examples.
---
go for it personally I know pretty much every perk in the game at this point
---
dc penalty pls.
---
Hag 2: electric boogaloo
---
I had an easy time with that challenge. It doesn't have to be a gen, you can interrupt any action (Totem cleanse, unhook, injured vaulting)
---
Had this earlier.... bond was on. In one match no one came they just sat on the edge of map.
---
The other time, all three came running for me... I was so frustrated I stopped the struggle as all three of them arrived together... they want to be sitting ducks.... I'll allow it.
---
Spirit mains would like to have a chat with you
---
The point of a rank system is to quickly and efficiently sort players by their skill to ensure fair matchmaking.
---
If the way you're meant to rank up is by running down a checklist, that doesn't accomplish the goal of the system. 
---
If a killer plays for rank, they can just run down the checklist and reliably hit red ranks, even if they're mediocre, even if they're averaging 2-3 kills a match. The result is that once they *do* hit red ranks, they aren't good enough to cut it up there and will bumble along with Brutal Killer matches until reset on the 13th.
---
If a killer plays for kills, disregarding emblems, they'll probably just end up around purple ranks before such a playstyle ends up resulting in safety pips in most matches. Kill too fast? Not enough Chaser/Malicious, Brutal. Kill too slow? A few gens get done, Brutal.
---
Any hook related perk triggers, when a survivor DCs and it prevents the killer from getting that trigger. Saying 'he was robbed' is just me using a colloquial saying I think is the term. 
---
I'd like to see BHVRs planned DC penalties go into effect and after a season or two see how that's panning out.
---
I mean when a team is spending at least 2 minutes trying to find a totem, that’s almost a guaranteed win
---
Maybe doable with NOED but I actually prefer Rancor over yellow Mori to save those 4k BP
---
This should be an ultra rare add on.
---
I still think that hex locations should be increased and randomised so that they're not always in the expected positions. 
---
Sometimes though finding the hex can be a real nightmare!!! I've seen quite a few games go incredibly wrong for survivors hell bent on finding that ruin.
---
How long do you think ruin lasts now?
---
Wat a good okay, upvote!
---
Yeah 😅
---
I don't get what your point is. Teams that dance around in the basement or AFK give a guaranteed win, too. Throwing the game makes the killer win, yeah.
---
The real question is why would you bring a Mori with DH?
---
Depends on the killer, but most don't. Obviously not because it's \*too powerful\*, but because it's not powerful enough.
---
I saw a killer using some shitty tactics to get this done but after he got all 3 on there I dropped him a message to let him know I was on my way and walked down those stairs to sacrifice myself for his archive. The killer was very grateful 👍
---
I made a spreadsheet detailing how many times each perk has been on the shrine. You can take a look at it if you want.
---
Some maps are heavily killer sided and some maps are fucking impossible if the survivor knows how to exploit it against a slower killer especially Haddonfield that map is a pain in the ass even with BL getting nerfed. There is one house that has pretty much a infinite loop for 110% speed killers it is stupid.
---
Other maps have just retardly strong windows that u can't mind game along with safe loops that there is no true counter too almost every map needs a rework look at the snow one I forget the name it takes fucking 40 seconds to go from side to side that is so fucking long when it takes 80 seconds to do a gen.
---
stuff like DS, Adren, Unbreakable and BT are perks that can be stupid bc they offer a second chance from either a fuck up or the killer being better then the survivors. Taking especially DS into consideration it is meant as a Anti Tunnel perk but it fails in this for 2 reasons 1. it is 60 seconds a killer can wait this out and still tunnel and there isn't much a survivor can do about this nor the team sure a coordinated team can do something but it doesn't stop tunneling the second point it fails in is the 60 seconds of pure immunity when a killer is smart and doesn't tunnel bc DS the person with DS can basically bait the killer into grabbing them forcing the punish when they didn't even get tunneled this can kinda fall in with BT bc that is like 20 seconds of immunity again that u can body block the killer.
---
for killers it is more that the power of other killers are just stupidly better than others like Nurse nobody can top her along with Spirit and Billy the other killers get kinda left in the dirt anyone from Legion to Trapper.
---
To add some perks are fucking useless like seriously meta never really shifts look at autodidact it is so fucking bad it would be a amazing supportive perk but idk what to fix to make it better.
---
to add there is a lot of crutches for killers well maybe 1 or 2 one thing I think is a crutch is Bloodlust bc DBD isnt balanced around top tier players this hurts low tier gamers if they balanced maps they could remove Bloodlust and that would make survivors that can loop better actually be a good part of the team rather then a more than likely canon shield that will die bc the killer was just waiting for Bloodlust 3 which is stupid even as a killer main I think it is dumb sometimes. Another thing is NOED this is subjective ofc I think for low tier players it teaches them the wrong things NOED is only good if ur loosing or ur going for a end game win but new players wont rly get that and just use it as a safety net which new survivors wont understand how to counter bc they dont even get gen priority.
---
point is the game is unbalanced what side is more unbalanced is subjective but BHVR has changed this before and can possibly do it again if they fuck it up
---
when I play trapper it doesn't last over 10 seconds
---
Boy, you sure sound like a fan. XD
---
Abuse? You mean use them correctly lol
---
Pallet Stun into getting hit is my favorite combo
---
Big brain energy
---
Oof. I had to check to see if this was real. I'm honestly not against. I never really liked ninja(too "wacky") but I think this will just bring new players to dbd. I would love to see this community grow even more. Sure maybe it'll be some 12 year olds but maybe there will be alot more non 12 year olds playing. I watched his lates dbd gameplay and he still has alot of room for improvement but he is decent? Ig? Hopefully he bring more attention to our favorite game
---
IF maybe but that is RNG for me when I play trapper my ruin lasts 10 seconds in rank 5 and I will never run TOTH just to protect a ruin that I know the survivors won't care about and just work through
---
Well yeah, but how rare is it for someone to not get unhooked if the killer isn’t camping them?
---
Sure but ok this game the killer can recognize him in the pre game lobby and bring in a mori and iridescent addons. He’d pretty much get witch hunted until he gives up, which I’m ok with
---
Its helluva boss,it's currently only a pilot but if you like demons not giving a fuck and invader zim you'll live it
---
Red rank Doctor main with 1,000+ hours here. I personally run Ruin, Distressing, Unnerving presence, and Pop goes the weasel. 
---
If I know I'm going to be playing on a smaller map (A.K.A the game, etc) I'll swap Pop goes the weasel with Coulrophobia. Also, for add-ons, always use an electrode add-on with whatever class add-on you prefer (restraint, order, calm, discipline, etc). His base shock range without electrodes is piss poor, and you won't be shocking anyone without them at high ranks. Also, moldy electrode is ass so try to avoid it unless you're saving up to buy the other two types.
---
There is never only one generator left.
---
Fair
---
If a killer plays for BP, they're not going to red. If a killer plays for memes, they're not going to red. I don't get what your point is. Play the game as intended and do it well and you're going to red, as intended. You'll be playing against only reds by the time you hit purple, but that's its own problem.
---
.... it's the ones that message you after to let you know you're shit because you don't have as many bloodpoints so you obvs did nothing...
---
Happened to me once... was super angry. 😡😡😡😡😡
---
It only bans if u change pak files. Fear nothing mate.
---
It's because they're pussies.
---
Lol no my dear friend
---
Have they said when they will be?
---
But Come Gaming just donated 100k bits!
---
I did this first try I just put on leader and prove thy self and I never did a gen by my self And worked with people (found them with bond)
---
Nah, more indifferent.
---
Sure that could be a good start. 🙂
---
I can 100% agree. I play survivor about 30% of the time (I find killer much more engaging and fun) but even games where I actively think "wow I got fucking obliterated that game" I still single pip when the emblems come up and it's like
---
How??
---
That can happen to literally any steamer. Don't know why y'all hate home so much, just another steamer from what I've seen.
---
r/StabbyGang
---
So basically what I am getting from this post, correct me if I am wrong.  Depending on map, perks used (on both sides) and some bad balancing by BHVR both killers and survivors are unbalanced.  Each are just siuational.
---
I just want it because I wanna sometimes wanna run a destroyer build with Myers brutal , spirit fury, enduring and any fourth perk.
---
Yea kinda ig but right now it is mainly maps being unbalanced and too rng based
---
Just follow me on the Reddit, I usually post pictures every my DBD art here.
---
Main doesn't mean never plays anything else it just means you spend a majority of your time on that side. You're thinking of a 'one trick'
---
Gotcha. I sometimes forget that some perks are even in the game at times honestly lol
---
Old but gold.
---
This game is ruined for console lol
---
it was a longer post then I expected point is some perks fail in what they are made for and others are completely useless
---
That bar ain't right, son.
---
It’s more the fan base that he’ll drag in.
---
Edited my post after you replied so my bad should've just waited for you to reply.  
---
Also RNG can be a good thing in my opinion sometimes it's more fun when it feels like the game is challenging you, sometimes it's nice when it gives you a break.
---
When I'm playing with Friends, i don't risk my ass for randoms, unless they were just total badasses. Souly because of how fucking brain dead randos can be.
---
It's not like the current fan base can get any worse, honestly. I've seen some ultra toxicity and flat out bullshit within this community.

#New Survivor: Killer
---
well sometimes but when RNG can spawn 3 pallets right next to each other or spawn a rly OP loop that u have to commit to or just give up whenever a survivor goes to it that is not fun RNG
---
Never underestimate the hide behind gen solution XD
---
lol she seems superficial. where did u get that doctor? looks like a statuette?
---
Big brain
---
Yikes
---
Literally just thought of Team America when he's like "DO THE SOGNAL!!!"
---
True there is some perks I see that I am like "This would be better if" but for the most part I feel like there's a counter to most things especially for what's meta.  Be it counter perks or mechanics/playstyles that counter stuff.
---
granted it is rank 4 so survivors are probably gonna know spawn locations
---
This wouldn't be a problem IF WE GOT MORE EMOTES
---
 New legion buff lookin pretty good
---
well think about this waiting 60 seconds isn't a nice waste of time for a killer it is like looping a killer without effort it takes 80 seconds to do a gen ALONE. So if a killer is stubborn and is waiting out that 60 seconds he is wasting like 75% of a gen and guess what it didn't stop the killer from tunneling he is still gonna hook u and that is where it fails
---
bug idk but u down a survivor next to some gens that where touched boom free kicks and free tracking on them and a downed survivor it is good value
---
Because it's what we needed all along.
---
it usually is and that is the question if that RNG of gen spawns should be okay
---
Thw wraith is like what the fuck does it says here?
---
fair enough
---
Problem i see with surge is the gen that explode not being worked on
---
I love how you stay calm and wait for the recover until hes gone. I just wonder why you dont look back when opening the exit gate, spine chill even lightened up?
---
Monitor and abuse is myers number 1 perk. A must have imo unless you run the teir 1 add ons. Monitor, ruin, nurses and bbq for the extra bloodpoints is my go to build. You can swap bbq for pop, sloppy, corrupt, stbfl anything really but the other 3 are staples imo. Best add ons are the green considerably increase stalk power and the yellow decreased terror radius in teir 2.
---
Would spine chill proc against insidious?
---
DISS APPOINTMENT
---
The kiler CAN leave and harass other survivors though.  If they peel off to heal then there is 1 (potentially more since SoloQ can be unorganised) if they go for the heal.  
---
Depending on the killer you can even play around that even better imo
---
You just told people to not tell people what to do
---
it is just some free value not the best combo but a okay one tbh
---
buff*
---
Found the salty killer main guys
---
you beautiful son of a bitch!
---
Ruin with PGtW could be good tho ruin for early and pgtw for rest of the match.
---
Im not sure, I dont want to spread false informations, but I dont think so.
---
Omg if she had literally any outfit based on her Ahs appearances I’d instantly buy
---
PGTW is great on freddy u hook and just TP to a gen
---
True.
---
Judging by other posts on this sub about the same topic, different platforms can't add each other, and thus can't invite each other to a lobby.
---
dude tbh we could sit here and talk about DS all day and people already do the fact of the matter is it doesn't stop tunneling completely. 
---
But when it comes to unbalancedness it is usually the maps that are at fault first
---
Where's the 4th one😨?
---
Go fuck yourself
---
It's called lag switching. The killers will start to DL multiple stuff on their networks to cause it to lag to the people connected to his match
---
Hey, I own this guy. I kinda wish mine had the eyes like this, though.
---
man, it’s the exact opposite for me. i’m a rank 10 killer, but always fight red ranks
---
I don't agree with this. If it was a mori, players are going to play extra passively and safely. Not knowing if it's a mori or just separation means that it keeps survivors guessing, as it should
---
Probably yeah, I am just trying to be open minded about things here.  I feel like most things have a counter measure to it but because some players are too stubborn to change their playstyle they set "rules".  I try to be as flexible as possible when I play stuff.  For example my biggest ahte rn is Ruin trappers with the injure perk etc.  I have like 1 or 2 perks I use to counter that and then add other perks I feel that are good for example.
---
He is absolutely dreadful. Every perk in the game is a cheat, every play is bullshit. He'll bring even more toxic children in. *Hopefully* when he gets bored and moves on his fans will start to follow actually respectable/talented players like Otz and learn to appreciate the game, but I doubt that.
---
Honestly that’s never going to change and with playing this game, especially playing Killer you have to build up a resistance to the horrid comments from a lot of the community because the truth is there are some really shitty people who can’t just let you play the game that you purchased. And that’s what you’ve always gotta remember, you purchased the game and it’s your fucking property so you play it however you want as long as you enjoy it.💗💗💗💗
---
“Should’ve brought enduring”
---
This is the perfect chance to Try and Kobe and pray you fail.
---
He doesn’t look fine.
---
I mean, it works but thats different in this case. Not really a mindgame. Just hiding with no terror radius until someone runs into the basement. Useless strategy if kindred is playing.
---
It makes it go away.
---
Insidious got buffed with the undetectable status recently so you get no red stain and no terror radius now
---
I thought the same thing, that maybe they all queued with the lv5 but even then why am I getting rank 5s?
---
I'm pretty sure the game goes up to 6 ranks above or below your rank if noone in your rank is available
---
If we have the exit door open, I will wait for everyone to get out and block people from getting hit even if it meant I died (which pisses off my father extremely). It's who I am :^)
---
True idk sometimes I just wanna run a meme build and not go all out it's funny when they stun you right as it hits and the pallet breaks immediately and they freak out.
---
Yes, it still would
---
It's in the name.
---
Killer.
---
They’re not very similar in reality. I main ghostface and Myers and as ghostface I almost never stalk people. I mostly just use him for his stealth aspect. As Myers you’re a lot less mobile but you have a lot more snowball potential, but against object of obsession you’re screwed. I personally prefer ghostface
---
yea, its a pretty fun build :)

---
trust me u don't
---
Scared of something different? Don’t think it could work? Complacent with the norm? People like you are the reason we will never get a killer that’s not a 5-6 ft human with nothing special about them other than some dirt on the face or some “scary eyes”.
---
what a shit dad

Sometimes some files get corrupted during an update. Verify your game files and your good to go!

I had a similar situation where I was carrying a survivor and the wiggled out but fell through the floor, part of them was sticking through but I couldn't get them, they were the last person so all I had to do was begin endgame collapse
---
I woudn't waste your time with trying to be reasonable with people on Reddit.  It rarely happens, if you don't agree with the reddit hive you MUST be against them in every way possible.  I just tend to state my point and as soon as they get childish about it call them out and leave the conversation.  Saves you a lot of sanity.
---
Ghost face can t-bag. Case closed
---
Calling number 192! Will number 192 please come to the service desk, your survivors are ready to be slaughtered!
---
My main issue is that there's no incentive to stay in a match when a teammate disconnects or kills themself instantly. 600 points is nothing compared to the rage inducing and lopsided Matt she will most likely experience in a 3v1. Unless the Killer is brain dead, my item and offerings were just wasted because of one teammate. It's usually followed up by teammates who give up or don't know what they're doing being wiped.
---
Survivors and killers should get a better bonus for quitters. At least 1,000 points for the survivors and the points for a full sacrifice for the Killer.
---
As somebody who has thousands of hours across both sides. This game is very rage-inducing. Bad matches seem to happen in clusters and aren't evenly distributed with good matches. If you're having a bad day on dead by daylight, you're not going to get a single good match. It's just going to be one frustrating thing after another ruining any desire to play the game.
---
Again. I still get teammate to hook suicide practically every match if they go down first, I still get people who disconnect when I'm killer and they don't like that killer. Which is something I'm guilty of. I refuse to play against Ghostface until he is fixed. I'm tired of seeing him one out of every three matches because he's broken as fuck. Broken meaning glitchy and inconsistent, and I just do not enjoy playing against him. I mean I fucking enjoyed playing against old spirit and that says something about my patience.
---
But if my teammates are throwing a match. Dropping like flies before anything gets done, quitting from the match, suiciding unhook, my desire to stay in that match gets lower and lower. In my mind I could be off to another match where I'm actually earning more points and having more fun which is the most important aspect of the game to me. Instead of wasting my time on a match that has already ended.
---
Yeah, true. I have too much free time on my hands.
---
I don't really understand people's entitlement to *free* cosmetics. The devs literally add dozens of semi-unique challenges that reward bloodpoints, currency for free blighted cosmetics, and currency for various cosmetics/new trinkets, which people LOVE.
---
And they offer a large amount of these things, which are extra work for them, ENTIRELY free to anyone who plays the base game.
---
THEN, the vast majority (or at least, majority of vocal players) DEMAND that they be able to coast through these challenges easily and get an even LARGER amount of cosmetics and trinkets for FREE. Even if you get less than half of the paid for part of the battle pass, you're getting multiple skins and other exclusive cosmetics for a real bargain in auric cells. I just don't understand.
---
*All that said:* the game itself is in a bit of an annoying state. Gens pop in minutes, and killers are forced to play in ways that seriously brutalize uncoordinated solo survivors just to barely survive when going against coordinated teams. I play a lot more survivor than killer, though I enjoy killer more\*. A lot of the changes suggested by both sides are really just bandaids on pet issues. The core problem is the overall structure of the game, which, played optimally by rational actors, heavily favors survivors, but, when played by irrational actors, heavily favors killers. Fixing this requires more structure changes to the overall game, like the end-game collapse. The EGC is probably the most positive change to the game in the entire span of time i've been playing it, and we need more like it. Not heavy nerfs to existing mechanics, but new mechanics and game structures.

\*i just find survivor so much less stressful and easy to jump in to game after game of
---
Correctamundo.
---
Going up or down 6 ranks is fine but there is zero reason for that group to have to go against a red rank killer just because their friend is a 5.  It's such a shitty system.
---
Trapper has no business being that thicc god damn
---
"gg piece of shit"
---
Never forget...
---
Julie is just that awesome
---
Ik, it ruins the game
---
Honestly it is, however if I played survivor on PC I would probably have a controller plugged in
---
i mean i know what all the perks and killers do. the “op” and “trash” methods , etc. saying “almost everything” doesn’t mean “i know everything”. so obviously there’s a few things i’m un aware off but i know most
---
Clown is an absolute Blast to play as and against, change my mind.
---
Honestly, just watching him walk away after hooking you is enough to make me consider playing him even more than i already do. Bonus points if they headbang whilst reloading
---
Play without your shirt next time! Thanks.
---
Before it was red rank survivors teaming up with a brown rank to get a brown rank killer, this is an improvement but..You know, THAT happened
---
r/madlads
---
We are David king and kavid ding and we wear the defaults for David+mullet
---
almost to me is knowing most perks I can assure u that u don't know even close to most even with 500+ hours I know maybe a good amount but not even close to everything
---
I have tried suiciding and get cursed with a Kobe before
---
oh boy, killin' time!!
---
This is an oddity with the system of Emblems and to a degree it makes sense. If you're too "efficient" you won't pip and thus will make the "entity displeased". Tunnelling the same survivors, camping hooks/the same area, downing potato survivors (ones who can't loop/escape) are indicators of a poor entity result.
---
Get into the habit of getting multiple hooks on survivors (hooking them and letting them get away), it earns you significantly more BP, is more fun for the survivors (less likely to DC) and will improve your skill (learning to pressure everyone instead of tunnelling).
---
It's over Anakin. I have the high ground
---
Spirit main plays doctor
---
sorry we have different meaning of know everything. i was meaning i know the game mechanics, what perks are good and bad, etc. not fully memorizing every perk by the tag
---
Lmao that made my night
---
OH THAT SURE ISNT EVEN CLOSE TO HALF OF IT WHEN IT COMES TO GAME MECHANICS now u opened a whole different can of worms buddy
---
I took this screenshot!
---
What's the difference
---
Certainly.
---
I use a hard line for my internet. But could also be the killer lag switching on purpose
---
1st off your toxic, 2nd off knowing most of how the game works does not mean memorizing that ahaha, i just said we have different meaning so calm down buddy. just trying to find new people to play with... see how i put POSITIVE in the comment. cause people like you ruin the game and new incoming players for the community. you ruined this post now no one will respond. all you had to do if your such veteran and “god” then you could’ve kindly explained your confusion or pointed me out on my wrong. carry on with your night sir, and happy holidays.
---
Heeeyyyyyy 😂😂😂
---
Just wait till you get to red ranks. I see the Rank 1 killers on YT 4K a team and still not even get black pip. It appears to get incredibly difficult to even black pip later.
---
u take this as being toxic oh boi u havent seen the surface of DBD then lmao but u truly dont know the half of it
---
The issue is that I’m sure they felt the same way. And have encountered basement campers over and over. I also run to the other side.
---
“Cry baby survivor.” Well. I believe you just answered everyone’s question as to why they do it.
---
I'm guessing you had insidious on? Otherwise I'm wondering how the terror radius didn't tip them off
---
When you’re so use to waiting for the Doctor that you don’t recognize him when he shows up. 👨‍⚕️

Oh damn thank you sir
---
Maybe she did indeed throw the hatchet from the direction the handle would’ve been pointing, but turned the stool around? I don’t know WHY she’d do that, but... it’s the best I’ve got.
---
Its ok it happens. I approved the one with the most upvotes and removed the others
---
I had it happen so many times, just got it today when someone DCed as they died on hook and I was livid but it still counted. Thank the entity for that.

---
Good players arent positive people in this game.
---
Nor do they have fun because the amount of work a killer player has to do to win in this game against the best survivors is ludacris.
---
Survivor players are either good and put forth some effort and take the win that's almost handed to them in most dbd matches.
---
But other survivors who arent very good think every chase is a tunnel, no matter what.... and being able to see the killer from the hook is camping.
---
And complain about pop, ruin, every attack that hits them is BS, every trap they step in is hacked.
---
And every pallet that they get hit through is LAGGY.
---
I figure it's a desire to take control of the outcome of their game in some small way. Doesn't make sense from a gameplay perspective, but emotionally maybe it helps them deal with a bad match? Sort of an "on your own terms" thing.
---
If they also have a poor understanding of how Killers get bloodpoints, maybe they even feel they're actively punishing the killer.
---
They really should look at tweaking the gatekeeper emblem or just removing it completely and replacing it with like an anti-tunnel/camp emblem.
---
That is an incredibly weird take on this. They’re under no obligation to help the killer. If they want to DC they can DC. It’s not toxic. Don’t make that word mean even less than it already does.
---
I’ve helped numerous killers complete their challenges but the basement one is particularly awful. And honestly, the only way for behavior to fix this shit is to not allow people to finish it to demonstrate just how bad it is.

I HAD TO BRIBE EVERYONE WITH A BPS AND MESSAGE THEM AHEAD OF TIME TO PLEASE JUST NOT DC, I'M DOING THE NEW SHIT CHALLENGE.
---
LAST PERSON D/CD ANYHOW BUT IT WORKED THE SECOND TIME. 
---
THAT WAS MY 6TH TRY FOR IT OVER ALL, FIRST 4 HAD D/CS 
---
I ACTUALLY HATE THE REAL LIFE PERSON THAT CAME UP WITH THAT CHALLENGE AND EVERYONE INVOLVED WITH PUTTING IT IN.
---
WHO ELSE IS HAVING THE ARCHIVES NOT REGISTER WHEN THEY COMPLETE SOMETHING? IM TRYING TO DO THE 15 IRIDESCENT EMBLEM ONE AND IT WONT REGISTER WHEN I GET THEM. ITS VERY FRUSTRATING AND ALSO DUMB
---
In the most recent Reddit AMA MCote himself was down with the idea but said Chuky "wasn't on their short list." I do think we will get him one day. He's too big of a character to ignore.
---
You must not player killer very often or at red/high purple ranks if you think survivors use these perks just to counter "scummy" killers. I can not even count the number of times a survivors have tried to bait me into hitting them with BT even though I'm chasing someone else. How often survivors with DS will hop in and out of lockers to try to get you to grab them/get the stun. How many games I'm playing a killer I'm not good at and all 4 survivors will be injured, then that 5th gen pops and every dam one of them has adrenaline. 
---
Everyone has a different play style, but honestly when I get to red ranks I back off playing killer because almost every game without fail, the survivors play like assholes. They go out of their way to make sure the game is as unfun and irritating for the killer as possible.
---
Almost every game I’ve seen that has online play published for leaving too much. Even HotS does this.
---
It is literally a competitive game. What exactly do you think that word means?
---
Hell no, GF is much better
---
nope literally bind a killer as he is picking up a survivor works it doesn't need to save that is how I did shit was simple
---
The more I play dbd the more I feel sandbagged from my teammates. Just start sandbagging them. You’ll be to red ranks in no time
---
GF is much better.
---
GF doesnt really need to stalk people, his power lays in the fact he can mask his red stain mid chase, this makes chases SOOO much harder.
---
i dont get it
---
Or that you've been exhausted for .02 seconds and somehow got hit..
---
I HAD A GAME A COUPLE DAYS AGO WITH THREE RANK 5S AND ONE RANK 3
---
THEY ALL DROPPED PALLETS IMMEDIATELY. USUALLY WHEN I WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY BUT EVEN WHEN I WAS SEVERAL.
---
IT GOT SO BAD I STARTED SHAKING MY HEAD "NO!" EVERY TIME THEY DROPPED ONE. I FELT SO BAD. I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST BABES.
---
APPARENTLY THEY WERE 10+ RANKS ABOVE ME.
---
THIS RANKING SYSTEM IS USING SOME FANCY HOLLYWOOD MATH.
---
stop playing DBD then fucking hell
---
If I ever meet a killer that messages me asking for help with this challenge, I will straight up follow them to the hook because getting cucked so often has to suck.
---
one rewards winning, one rewards losing. They aren't equal.
---
I do it all the time as Dwight. But most killers think its bm and will tunnel me.
---
This isn’t the place 🙅🏻‍♀️
---
I will argue that it being unbalanced doesn’t mean it can’t be competitive. It just doesn’t have a Pro scene. It seems like it can be played competitively or casually depending on whether or not you care about your rank.
---
One of the few times I was toxic, the survivors didn't even do anything I just wanted to be a cunt suddenly. Most other times I play pretty chill and let out the cuties
---
bc I saw otz doing it and I wanted to do it too bc I was getting tired of maining Nurse
---
..... Sure. 😂😂😂😂
---
Almost certain it was Kittychipz but... idk!
---
I had a trapper game earlier. He didn't seem to be doing the basement challenge, so I assumed he was doing hungry jaws. I had small game on and decided to help him get those 5 or 6 trapped survivors quota. We all ended up escaping but I hope he got the challenge done at least.
---
What does BBQ and Chili have to do with doing gens? Maybe I misunderstand what it does. But unless you hide in a locker it seems better to be doing a gen when your aura shows up then to not be doing anything at all.
---
No they meant “killer post” as in “man that was an amazing post you killed it.” 
---
I couldn’t resist.
---
That is some heavy dsync
---
Meg looks adorable here
---
Hey suicide is fun
---
with his recent nerf yea he is quite trash thank u BHVR for making Oni unfun
---
I think I’ve become too confident in the hatch rule. 
---
My GF told a killer he didn’t obey the law. She didn’t struggle but he still killed her. His response was great: “Those are survivor laws. Not killer laws. You die.”
---
Last time I did that, I depipped. Never again.
---
Charms are the most unnecessary add on to a game since horse armor. 
---
It basically feels like they needed a smaller reward than cosmetics to give out for the free track so they came up with charms.
---
u/DrFruitLoops like this?
---
Gotta time the blind to when the killer is able to move, any blind before that time won't work
---
I'm guessing he had Overcharge on too, huh?
---
Is standing still in front of the first person you hooked while the rest just do gens and escape since they can't save their fellow survivor even playing?
---
I'm pretty much sure you are trolling but I'll humour you for now incase you aren't.  Maybe my use of face camping was wrong so to clarify I mean literally standing still in front of the person you just hooked, not moving, pretty much AFK, until they are sacrificed.
---
I don't really care
---
What? I’ve watched streamers 4K and not pip. It really confuses me. I just don’t get it.
---
This kind of shit is why Insidious is my favorite perk.
---
I mean, looks like it shoulda went off to me. Never had any problems like this before.
---
I got to tier 70 and it was a shitshow, probably never buying it again
---
That doesn’t make any sense as the survivors entire emblem system is essentially to ensure this doesn’t happen. So it gets harder and harder to do this.
---
Lore
---
too early if u waited just a split more u would have gotten it u can tell it didnt work bc he was moving after u got the blind
---
If you havent yet, check out otzdarva. Hes very good, really funny and is great at going through what hes thinking while playing.
---
I also completed the tome challenge during this match that says blind the killer while carrying a survivor. If you blind the killer while he/she is carrying a survivor, shouldnt that result in a save? The challenge passing and the survivor not being saved dont go together, they dont add up.
---
ah rip, thanks for at least giving it a shot lol, good luck anyways
---
That is so gay lol
---
The only thing I agree with is don't sabo hooks. Please, its awful. Keys are fucking dumb but atleast I can do something about it. The people that come in as a toxic 4 man deranking swf just to fuck with the killer and tilt him is bad too but most of the time they fuck around and die because they get cocky lol
---
Adorableness is off the charts
---
I like Freddy because if I win or lose, I won or lost because of my skills. 
---
The thing that frustrates me the most about killer is that sometimes there’s games you literally can’t win. You’re either hindered by a weak killer, OP survivor items, sweaty swf, or bad map design.
---
Freddy is able to win regardless of map or items the survivors use. Not to say he’s overpowered or anything. Far from it. Freddy is only as good as the player. Something that can’t be said about every killer
---
When you win as Freddy, it’s earned. And when you lose, that means you didn’t play at your best.
---

a bit but if I remember the clown is weird he picks up the survivor faster but still has the same time

https://www.twitch.tv/drfruityloops/clip/CleverAffluentPizzaYee?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time
---
I can give u this clip as a example to compare too from myself like u where off by a hair tbh
---
This is exactly right.
---
The only missing information is the change to SWF that happened months ago. It used to be that 3 ranks 1s and a rank 16 deranker would end up in green/yellow lobbies. Post change red players force their party in to red lobbies. This was good and bad. Yellow killers don't have to face red teams but theres also less green/yellows available to match with. 
---
As killer you want to rank up as quickly as possible foe fast lobbies.
---
As survivor you should derank for fast lobbies.
---
And dying with like 10k points and having no fun.
---
IT INDEED IS.
---
DCing just doesn't make sense to me. In the 160ish hours I've played, I've only intentionally DC'd once. It was swamp and leatherface was camping. Not patrolling, but hooking and then standing two feet away, not moving until you died. I'm not proud of it, but it's soul crushing when you don't feel like you have a chance.
---
Hell, today I played four back to back games that frustrated me, but I played each one through and then closed the game.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
Imagine all that mending. Yumm
---
Exactly what I told people before with my previous Chucky posts and no one will even consider thinking of it lol i just gave up
---
I’d really like a chainsaw hand that made noise only you could hear (different from killer abilities), of course it didn’t have to do anything, but functioned like pig’s dlc weapons
---
I would've just dc'd. Not my fault or problem, fix your shit internet before playing killer ffs.
---
Who cares if he has fun? Lets not be toxic pieces of shit with a new influx of players if it happens like with the Stranger Things DLC. More money for the devs to make new content and potentially fix the game
---
I also play both. 
---
I dont teabag
---
I dont play doctor.
---
We exist.
---
It looks so close together im still upset haha. Thanks for sharing though. Sorry for my pizza recording :(
---
I know you mentioned it just happend to you, but its so much more common for killers to say "If I was on my main Spirit" or whatever, I have never even once heard any toxic survivors say "if I was on my main", they say other toxic shit.
---
But this sub has a hardon for "killers good survivors bad" so maybe ill get crucified for saying that.
---
What's buggy about the app store?
---
Please don’t play DBD, especially if it will trigger you to self-harm... It may be a good idea to take a break.
---
Myers is better.
---
In the game depending on the player, would depend on who is better in my opinion.
---
Now in real life or the movie world Michael would have plunged his knife into him along time ago lol.
---
Oni in PTB: OP
---
Oni after release: S-tier, balanced killer
---
Oni after last nerf: D-tier killer
---
I wonder why? He's really not that good, would take him over a spirit any day.
---
Saw u/LegionDidNoWrong 's post and decided to find the original image and edited it myself. [I got rid of the potatohead underneath.](https://ibb.co/202YBvF)
---
After that, if I were him I would never give the last survivor the hatch ever again,unless it's a baby Dwight
---
From what I've been told in post game chat, it seems to mostly be about "denying" the killer something. This, if they're uninformed, could mean BP. But in that case it usually means denying the killer "a pip".
---
But I would day 7/10 times they claim they are denying "satisfaction" -- seems in line with one the other reply said about "taking control of the situation". Its a mind bender, really. If anything, I'm somewhat satisfied because it's frankly hilarious and pouty. At least, I'm not any less satisfied than if you just died.
---
It's a head game they play with themselves. "I'm dying because I want to, not because you told me to!"
---
I will since I like getting "rare" stuff that won't come back. So the nectar vial for exemple was my end goal and I got it. Depends on what's coming too but I'm most likely to get it
---
So is the Huntress third in queue? There is an hatchet on one of the stools.
---
The Store reckons it doesn't have Dead By Daylight. Yet if you look just below the error message you'll see the game installing.
---
While I prefer stealth killers, as ambushing is my bread and butter, I love the Clown. The cliche of a killer clown still doesn’t bother me, his coughing reminds me of my own, and he’s sorely underestimated. Yeah, you have to know your addons, but there are few things as satisfying to me as corralling survivors or hitting them while they’re gassed. Plus his aesthetics are excellent.
---
This is actually my favorite clip of The Doctor good job my guy
---
Please yes.
---
No, cherish dh while you can.
---
M I N D G A M E S
---
it is fine the differences I could spot in my clip the bubba was doing a tiny scuffle with his feet when I blinded him and the clown for u was completely stationary OR it could be a result of latency but who knows
---
BuT tHaTs ReAlLy ToXiC aNd PuTs YoUr TeAm At A dIsAdVaNtAgE 🤓
---
Alibi players be like
---
For killer it’s all about aesthetic, I mean can I practice nurse and guy gud, yes,
---
Or would I rather play a licensed killer like the pig and run around putting saw traps on everyone feeling super rad
---
The survivor emblem system has a similar problem.
---
Somebody who just plays the objective and saves their own hide at all costs isn't likely to rank up past purple ranks, while somebody who farms their emblems is able to pip fairly often even when they die.
---
Has it not been months since DS were released for PC? Im surprised console has not seen them yet.
---
Too bad the glitched lighting looks about 1000 times better.
---
Listen here stupid, no one wants to always run kindred to serve this purpose, the problem is just killers camping
---
 mAtChMakINg bAD is already [banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules#wiki_8._oversaturated_content), yeah it's everywhere if you sort by new but if you report it, it does seem to get removed.
---
Depends on how it’s implemented, which admittedly is a lot to ask for from BHVR.
---
Lorewise it works because it fills the survivors with more hope. 
---
Gameplay wise, it shows more competence/skill in the chase so it acts as a better gauge for rank.
---
Wow blackface now alright
---
Devs stated in the last stream (not_queen) that they will have a update for us on dedicated servers for console after the new year. 
---
My guess is they will give us a early or late spring date for when they might turn them on, unless they still can’t get their spaghetti coded game to work right for them. 
---
Not holding my breath. I know next year they better really get this game turned around and working more properly.
---
Don’t care for him but more exposure means more players. More players mean shorter queues. Sure some of them will be young but if it gets views, then people off all ages will come. I’m sure I play in lobbies with squeakers all the time and am just unaware. Potatoes come in all ages. Lol But yeah man. Let the game have a second wind. More money for the devs, more resources for the game. I don’t hate it.
---
If they just help the killer complete the challenge then the killer won't have to play any more badement games. Better for killer AND survivor. Isn't that what you'd want?
---
And it absolutely is toxic if the survivor does that to purposely ruin the killer's chance of getting the achievement. Sure you can't read their mind but it's pretty obvious sometimes.
---
I have equal hours on survivor and killer (maybe more for survivor) so can empathize with both sides and also hate toxicity on both sides. I'm super nice as killer/survivor so maybe I'm a little anal admittedly.

I like it as well, looks like the flesh is necrotic and rotting
---
I suppose that’s the thing. Escaping really isn’t the “goal” of the game if you’re interested in ranking up. It took me a few games to go figure that out with my GF. We were splitting duties where she would save and I’d do all the gens and she always got more points then me. Then we looked at the emblems and realized exactly what you’re saying. 
---
Im not sure how else it can be done though. It would be hard if someone didn’t pip unless they escaped or got a 4K
---
Thank you for the good response, i like playing this game but it is very derpy and frustrating to play for more than an hour at a time.
---
I think we're arguing different points lol, I'm saying I like streamers more spread out but the same number of them in total while you're saying more streamers = better.
---
Hey, at least the horse armor had more than 6 pixels!
---
That doesn’t make any sense. That’s not the point of the game. And that is the fundamental reason I do what I do. To protest the people that are trying to turn the game into a “help me complete the challenge” game. It’s not about empathy. You’re asking the “enemy” to work with you to essentially break the fundamental concept of the game. 
---
These challenges go directly against their idea of playing immersive.
---
I frantically wave my arms if there's a camp, swing it a couple of times if no one is coming to me and twitch them if two people are coming.
---
These perk icons look sick! Would you kindly share the link?
---
They could, simply by checking a dying or carried survivor's proximity to a basement hook. 32 meters should work. From a technical standpoint it would actually be very easy.
---
On the other hand, will they? Sure, after their next 50,000 cosmetic packs, hotfixes for hotfixes, and new chapters broken on launch.
---
Whoever that was almost had a fucking heart attack
---
That wasn’t a bs hit at all..
---
Or should you say... cat money.
---
Wheres the funny?
---
I WISH IT WAS SIMPLE STUFF, LIKE HOOKING PEOPLE AND UNHOOKING AND HEALING IS OK BUT 6 TRAPS? LMAO FARMING GAME TIME BECAUSE IM NOT TRYING FOR THAT LEGIT.
---
There was just a video about that very thing happening a couple hours ago. Scroll down a ways in the "new" section.
---
kill enuff of each survivor as cannibal and u get their face for a mask?
---
Nah man that was totally it now that I think about it
---
What confuses you? Are you familiar at all with the emblem system?
---
I bet that she wouldn't want him if he didn't have that perfect smile smh

They should balance the game before looking at penalties. They're seriously jumping the gun here. Look at why people are disconnecting instead of just punishing them for it.

---
are u drunk? in what world does a hit that is 3 meters away from me connect?
---
I think you have to sacrifice 25 of each OG survivor to get them. Never play Cannibal myself but that's what I've heard.
---
Yeah, devs fault for not having basically any kind of tutorial (and even the one they have is optional) and just throwing people in. The ranking system is based on being good at fulfilling the emblems, not just kills. You should be shooting for number of hooks, not just kills, among other things such as preventing gen completion.
---
I love the game to death. I got it for free as a ps4 plus gift and honestly I love it. I know it has flaws and such but honestly this game is my favorite. Also I'd be happy to answer any questions you have ^^

Disconnecting isn't toxic? Lol, WTF. Sure, you can force the killer to hook you. Run to the other side of the map and complete an objective. That's the game. Disconnecting is FUCKIN TOXIC.
---
Yo is that Justin Trudeau?
---
I HAVENT PLAYED AGAINST A PIG IN SO LONG WHEN WILL I GET MY SHOT TO BOOP
---
This is correct
---
LMAO
---
Nope not drunk. You were in swinging range and the hit should’ve hit you... and it did
---
THAT IS TOP TIER
---
No he isnt.
---
Putting 2 people against each other insnt a way to test how good a killer is.  
---
GF has the ability to mask his red stain whenever he wants, he can also stalk people and can insta down people while his terror radius and red stain is gone.
---
Myers is not a stealth killer. He huge, his breathing is loud, he gets punished for trying to be stealthy by making him move slower and have the shortest lunge in the game.
---
also without addons and Monitor as soon as tier one is gone, he isnt stealth anymore. While GF doesnt need monitor since he can make is terror radius 0 whenever
---
??????? she literally backed up and swung get out of here lmao
---
I've never had this happen to me and it makes me sad

ya this sub is so unfunny its crazy. The only thing that gets me to chuckle or smile is the artwork/comics with actual jokes.
---
I also think "pRetTy gOOd jOb sO fAR" post should be banned. they are all the same. Its either a minor bug that has been in the game for years that everyone knows and doesnt care about, or a MAJOR bug that everyone knows and they post it 3 days after the bug was introduced
---
Al jolson?
---
Use Discordance instead
---
I am not, in fact, trolling. Is it wrong for people to find that fun? I've been facecamped by a Freddy for running OoO and a Leatherface for finding Ruin very early into the match. I don't think I did anything toxic in those cases, but at the same time I understand why they'd facecamp me. 
---
Curious if you think facecamping after gates are opened or tunneling is toxic.
---
It might take decades to level up tho...

*HOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK*
---
As a doctor main myself, I don't know how I never thought of this. This is genius and hilarious.
---
i’d love for them to implement something like that!
---
people could still argue that he was still op even after the PTB nerfs.
---
His kill rate was way 2 good, and overall i think he had the issue with spirit where he was just way to damn easy for how powerful he was.
---
But god it fucking sucks how they just ruined him, i thought they would put more care into this update since the other yamamoka/DLC was a shit show.
---
*The betrayal*
---
So, I was duoing and there was this trapper doing this challange, he managed to hook 3 in the basemamt and I was the other side of the map, he closed the hatch and I (who was gate camping) opened It. He just stood there, looking me, I couldn't do it to my man, he let me pallet stun him some times as we run to the shack and then I gave it to him. Nice dude
---
"ggs i was the Claudette"
---
I first started playing on xbox a year or so ago. And boy, let me tell you, I miss it.  I switched to PC for streaming purposes. PC players are ALL either incredibly toxic or out to farm for BP. Killers are hella good. Don't let the people who play PC tell you there are terrible people, my time on xbox has wonderful people. You'll find some. The game is amazing, just gotta find the right crew. 
---
If I wasnt rank 6 on PC id go back to xbox in a heart beat. I put too much time and effort into characters so go back now. 
---
(After typing this, I realized none of this matters or helps you but hey, I like talking)
---
*please say /s*
---
His chainsaw hits multiple times, making him able to down you through bt
---
Jason or Plague?
---
Yeah but you gotta use ruin. It still does its job ig it gwts hit in the first minute. Thats 1 persom that was looking for ruin. You need to snowball real quick
---
Jason? Who’s Jason
---
that would require me to care
---
Jason mama
---
Very funny Laughed a lot
---

I play both, so I fafmed to get my 6 trap rite, but I can never trust anybody who isn't me. :)
---
This is also why I run self care and empathy on my claudette
---
Toss up between Plague and Clown. Clown isn’t very good and Plague is so-so but their perks are good. Is Spirit dlc on there?
---
Yes which is not good
---
Cry
---
ah i feel you, win win situation
---
She is so annoying to play against cause no one knows how to counterplay
---
Blame the rank 20 crybabies, everything must be nerfed
---
She’s probably a bitch to play on/against mobile lol. You said Freddy doesn’t count so that’s about it.
---
except when they face a bad player they’re calling them sh*t when they escape but then they lose and all of a sudden they’re op
---
Yeah Freddy dlc isn’t on mobile but thx for your help
---
I heard that Ussylis is pretty toxic.
---
Yep
---
BETTER HOPE YOU ARENT PLAYING AGAINST TRAPPER YOU WILL LITERALLY NEVER SEE HIS TRAPS EVER
---
I had a guy over showing him Survivor gameplay, and my very first game with him over was a Plague Thanataphobia dying light build on Lery's. My least favourite combo in the freaking world, sad to say i didn't have a good time but atleast he did Lol
---
Never forget
---
Lord forgive me as a west coast boy.  But that chicago pizza lookin mighty fine.
---
Dell G3?
---
I've got a Lenovo Legion, but that's a bit more expensive.
---
When this happens, all I have are the yellow ones... And I hardly use them lol
---
Most instadown killers have this problem even when playing normally since they can’t really chase the survivors, meaning it’s harder to pip with them (oni, hillbilly, plague)
---
“HITBOXES ARENT BROKEN ITS JUST LAG” EAT MY ASS
---
I got it first try on Hawkins of all maps. Was ok the edge of my seat praying “please don’t dc please don’t dc” 
---
I think I got lucky
---
Alright. Thanks for the tips and advice. Got an angry message from the only survivor I killed my first game actually.
---
they aren't designed for the same purpose either, Adrenaline is only active for 5 seconds and NOED is active indefinitely.
---
They share very little similarities aside from both being end game perks, of which there are several, but I don't see you comparing them to Hope, Wake Up, Rancor, NOLB, Remember Me, or Blood Warden.
---
The mechanics of the 2 perks are entirely different and they don't even cancel each other out either, if you want something like that Hope would be a more apt comparison due to that speed boost lasting a lot longer.
---
I MAKE IT A RULE TO NOT TUNNEL OR CAMP. ITS NOT FUN AS A SURVIVOR AND I KNOW THAT. I ACTIVELY AVOID DOING IT. BUT IF YOU BM ME AT EVERY TURN? GUESS WHAT MOTHERFUCKER YOURE GONNA DIE BITCH
---
You know what I mean
---
WHAT IS EVERYBODY YELLING ABOUT
---
I'VE LAGGED AS KILLER FOUR FRICK FRACKING TIMES TODAY AND MY INTERNET ON MY PC AND PS4 STATE THAT MY CONNECTION IS PERFECTLY SUITABLE. IF K RECEIVE ONE MORE MESSAGE FROM SURVIVORS COMPLAINING ABOUT ME BEING UNFAIR I WILL IMPLODE. I'VE NOW BEEN TAKING SCREEN SHOTS OF MY INTERNET SPEED TO TAKE THERE HEAT OFF OF ME.
---
Securing a kill at the end I can see why if they haven't had luck with survivors before hand considering they were playing the game.
---
Tunneling I don't either sometimes you just really want someone out especially if they've shown they ae good and being useful.
---
Again, I don't see how hooking 1 person and standing still for however long it takes for them to bleed out on hook is fun.  Just want to point out I don't mean being near the person you hooked and trying to catch someone going for the rescue, I mean legit face to face not looking elsewhere not moving.
---
You don't actually need to save, just blind while they are carrying someone. I got mine while the killer was about to hook someone.
---
I would keep saving.
---
I wonder if it is as toxic?🤔
---
Is it so difficult to be kind to people? There's no need to treat people like this.
---
BuLshet eScaPe. NoT fair To KilLr. YOu AlL sHoUld hAvE DiEd.
---
I usually main Doc/Trapper and I guess people just find Doc annoying. Going against a good Doctor is rough. If you get the timing down, you can completely shut down loops. Tier 3 also stops people doing any actions or using any items, but it isn’t exactly hard to get out of for the majority of players. People just want to do gens and get out. He’s in the same realm as Legion/Plague (other killers a lot of people DC against) because he forces you to do something other than the objective. On the flip side, lower skill Doctors will usually find a three gen setup and hard patrol it. It’s boring to play and play against.
---
I’m glad he’s playing it, as it potentially brings new players to the base - which means more sales, and more stuff long-term. 
---
But I watched the video just now - and he and his wife are equally obnoxious, wow. Their fan base is like teens and they’re so sexually and crass and vulgar. SMH
---
I'd cleanse there tbh.  Leary's has a crazy amount of los blockers.  The Game and Leary's are the best map to cleanse on because you can actually attempt to dodge and then pallet stun her out of her power.  Be more interesting viewing experience too.
---
i mean he *is* giving us the big booty trapper we deserve
---
is caps being mean?
---
Yeah, I did, but it wasn't that it was hard, it was that it was my least favourite killer to go against on my least favourite map Lol 😭😭😭😭
---
Thank you good sir.
---
Ignore that particular poster. There are a few people around here that aren't very nice to people, but there are a bunch of people that are supportive around here too.
---
Glad you're enjoying the game so far. Welcome to the fog!
---
Why in the living hell would you ever bring a shroud of separation as killer?
---
Dude, honestly who cares...
---
Yep. Played a match earlier against a farming Demogorgon. I refused to farm, ran away, looped them, and when they eventually caught me they repeatedly shook their head and tunnelled me when the other survivors (farming with them) unhooked me. I just DC’d before they death-hooked me. 
---
In my case, I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of killing me. The only time I ever DC is against farmers who try to force you into farming too. I don’t mind during double BP, but otherwise I just want to play a normal game ya know?
---
If immunity from unhooker worked properly it wouldn't be as bad. You should, in theory, have enough time to Dead Hard or Sprint Burst before the Killer can hot you. Which would make this potentially game winning. But actual dynamic fun? Not in MY Bhvr game.
---
... a real life killer wouldn’t just be fair
---
Get a ps4 and play dbd on there?
---
The survivors don't heal and chases only last one hit or you play a one hit down killer well: half chase credits.  
---
The survivors DO heal quickly after every unhook etc. You lose out on brutality (I think, I can never quite remember which is what).  
---
Survivors don't unhook people? No devout emblem, 4k too fast? Again, bad devout emblem.   
---
Don't run ruin and there's some beefy boxes and prove thyself involved? Super bad gatekeeper emblem (I realize even with good pressure and reasonable gen times the emblem can still not turn out terribly hot at red ranks).  
---
Wanna pip as survivor? Stun a killer once in a chase, do a couple gens and unhook someone safely. This might I note requires no sort of grimy playstyle or specific perks out of the survivors.   
---
I'm a survivor main and lemme just say, pipping as survivor is too fuckin' easy and meanwhile it's a fuckin' joke as killer. People wonder why it is that it's all slowdown builds and tunnelers up in red ranks and the source of the problem is obvious: the emblems not only encourage such play but incentivize and reward you for it.
---
Alert is really underrated imo! You can see who the killer is fairly early on, and know to be vigilant if it procs but you don’t see an outline. It’s great during loops as you can tell which way they’re going - handy for jungle gyms and other loops where visibility is limited. It’s also useful towards the end of the game when there is a low amount of survivors/3 gens left because you can see if they’re coming to your generator or going to the other one.
---
I used it specifically to get better at chases.
---
For Wraith you really have to use either the Bone Clapper or the Coxcombed Clapper to make him work properly. You should sneak up on people, hide behind an object near a worked on gen, come out of cloak and get a free injure. He‘s very similar to Ghostface in that regard.
---
As for Nurse if you‘re still learning I‘d suggest using either the Spasmodic Breath addon or the Matchbox. It‘s leaves room for error and makes you learn how to blink without too much pressure. Do not try to predict where a Survivor goes in order to blink to them, only blink towards them if they‘re in your line of sight.
---
That was going to be my question lol. How did they not know you weren’t fake with your terror radius? But I guess Insidious answers my question 😂
---
Always check the feet
---
Your art style is  amazing.
---
Depends. I d/c occasionally and sometimes I'm trying to depip but don't want to hurt my team by d/cing immediately.  (I miss green ranks.... It's so much more fun :c) so I'll play the game normally but d/c right before my last hook. 
---
And sometimes I hate the killer and am petty and want to deny them BBQ.
---
And sometimes I am just Done with facing whichever killer it is and I just wanna be gone and leave the match.
---
The majority of the time I dc is if killer is just slugging people. I especially hate the ones that follow you all the way to the exit gate, and THEN pick u up and hook you. Why??? Idk, but I don't wanna sit around for four minutes so I'm out. I'd rather lose out on bp and just get to a different match asap.
---
i like to run fast and stab lots
---
Pallet stun sound top two for me are pig then huntress
---
OK first of all fuck off with that shit. The other players don't know your perks!
---
Fuck, you ruined it
---
Closing the hatch starts the EGC, so once the timer starts, the killer can no longer open the door. Killer can only open the door once the last generator is completed and the doors are powered. :)
---
I’m playing as killer and I’ve spent a good decent game pressuring them, playing pretty fairly and overall on par with their team of 4 survivors. Not “losing” but playing killer as best as I can and the last gen pops. All 4 injured survivors are not only healed but are given a good sprint burst. It hits you hard, “fuck... that’s not good” You’re places in a bit of a rough spot and now you need to think strategically. 
---
Similarly with survivor you’ve done gens and had some good loops and played well all game taking a hook or two and now you see noed activate. “Well... shit” is the expression that I find myself saying.
---
This is what I’m talking about, no other perks at the end of gens can make you feel this way. And they are equally annoying to go up against. The perks you mentioned are end game sure but they sure as hell don’t make you feel uneasy. Remember me for an example isn’t bad if you’ve got a good team and nolb I never see anyone use soo whatever.
---
Sure rancor can kill a survivor but the rest can escape. Blood warden isn’t on adrenalines level, it’s higher in my view, if you can pull of a EGC hook then gg on that one. So again, in my opinion, these perks are the on the same level, gameplay purpose and emotional level
---
(this is like the third time for me to explain it, can we drop it now)
---
Nuts bro. wp
---
Ranking up isn't supposed to be something you aim for in the midst of a match.
---
It can be a goal, but it shouldn't be a goal that warps the way you play the game.
---
There are a few ways to make a rank system that works.
---
For Killers, there are a couple options
---
System 1
---
* 0-1 kill is a depip.
---
* 2 kills is a black pip.
---
* 3-4 kills is a pip.
---
If you want to keep double pips, you can tie that to something like "4 kills with no gens completed".
---
Alternatively, you could revert to the Victory Cube system. There really wasn't anything wrong with it, and it was still a hell of a lot better than what we have now. The only real reason it changed was because the survivor system needed an update, and they wanted both roles to use the same system.
---
For survivors, it's a similar deal.
---
System 1:
---
* Dying loses you a pip
---
* Die, but get everybody else out alive, and you safety
---
* Get out and pip
---
System 2:
---
* Dying loses you a pip.
---
* Escape through the hatch for a safety.
---
* Escape through gates for a pip.
---
If you want to keep double pips, you can tie that to something like "get everybody out alive".
---
We had a DC early in the game, and this very fine young man (or woman) let us farm
---
They had messages off tho. . .
---
I like bonking survivors on the head with bottles.
---
&gt;r/deadbydaylight's post flairs
---
I actually said this after the match
---
"Claudette, don't just stare at it, eat it."
---
This! I got face camped recently after running the killer for 2 gens, my team did the rest of the gens. One saved me with Borrowed Time, I took the extra hit, got downed, hit with the DS and escaped.
---
Ohhhh. It’s weird being a noob again. The reason I thought that was because a killer was gonna save me the other day but couldn’t open the gates or find the hatch. So I figured to open doors you had to close hatch or someone had to open hatch. Thanks for the help!
---
For the last god DAMN TIME NO!!! Last time you did someone got hurt.
---
What the fuck is a furry Nea and why am I afraid
---
"When you spawn in and see a RED pool of devotion with a closing in Heartbeat"
---
Hello Otz, you're awesome!!
---
Hitting a gassed survivor with 8 stacks of STBFL is so satisfying.
---
*Insidious Doctor Joined the party.*
---
I queued solo so was not coordinated with them.
---
I love Oni just for the way he looks honestly but yeah I don't see why you wouldn't just run Billy if you're going for the win if you're just looking to chill and not rank up Oni is fun though at times still.
---
When you’re on the hook and all three survivors come for the save, in different directions.
---
I feel like most Nancys are gen jockies. And they all seem to rely on stealth.
---
Yui maind act like Nea mains. 
---
I rarely see Ash players who can hold their own in a chase. They  the type who try to hide but they wheez and moan like old man's
---
I like to play Scoops Ahoy Steeve and I dont consider myself toxic, but yeah... Scoops Steves are pains to deal with.
---
Efficiently: it means when repairing gen's you're using "minimal effort" (using less charges)but achieving max productivity. 
---
Speed: self explanatory. It just makes it faster, but maybe at the cost of using up the toolbox faster. (Using more charges)
---
Or i could be completely wrong but whatever i tried haha. Hope it helped sorta..
---
I cant express how enraged I'd be if I went down to that. I'm impressed.

Holy God! This is fucking genius. Now offence, but fuck you! I won't be surprised if I go up against a Doctor who tries this shit on me only for it to work.
---
Damn. Just damn. Shit got harder.
---
Bro it’s a JOKE
---
Nea = always dc’s on first down
---
Now I know not all nea’s are like that, there’s some nice nea mains out there but that’s just my experience with most of them.
---
😂😂😂😂 fantastic
---
Quick way to solve this. Play as a killer for 2 days and then see if you feel this same. I did and i changed my view fast. Maybe you will or won't but. Check it out.
---
Steve’s always seem more competent players while Nancy’s always seem to avoid the chases at all costs.
---
Yui’s love to run killers around.
---
Ash’s are very rare and always bring in the weirdest perks.
---
(P.S. this is coming from a survivor main so I’m biased)
---
Oh shit! Thanks so much!
---
Jane is dummy thicc though.
---
How about Julie
---
no, but ok
---
Alright, thanks. Good to know what addons to use and such. Any perk tips you can give?
---
Well I’m hooked on it. I’ll ask myself out.
---
What about her?
---
As a killer main, I usually let Kobes live.
---
Can we talk about the dedicated servers for a second. Ive noticed way more desyncing issues with being hit after i was well past a window/pallet than ever before.
---
Good to know. As I also said below, any perk recommendations?
---
Can I main her and not be a Degenerate?
---
That was actually awesome good job man!!
---
Had a kid legit do this on Xbox while learning Oni... Because how else do you learn or practice in this game??
---
So he tells me his mains and he's so good and he doesn't play Myers or Ghostface "because they are too easy" etc. 
---
I look at his profile, he's a survivor main, hardly had the game and red rank boosted by playing with his friends who have owned or played the game longer. Hardly any achievement progress... Which is a telltale sign he's either a very shitty killer or doesn't play as he said he does. 
---
So I told him next time be humble, called him out on his BS and left the chat
---
OoO isn’t a toxic perk but who use it to be toxic.
---
Stupid dead bad should of not of died pff
---
Fake news. Team mates never do gens.
---
I'm only attracted to my bf and lady's that look like me
---
Hey man, anytime you know.
---
There's a lot of talk about spirit or whoever being overpowered, but at least I have fun games against them sometimes. I don't think I've *ever* had a fun game against a plague before. A mechanic that makes you constantly at one hit before death unless you want to give the killer a free stream of bullets is just so lame to play against, it feels like there's so little counterplay.
---
(Before someone says 'just dodge the puke/bullets 4head', yeah it's possible to dodge most of it or even an entire volley, but then she just gets a bit closer and does it again, you can only avoid constant streams for so long before *some* of it connects.)
---
fuck off never post on here again
---
fuck you asshole
---
If it’s any comfort, I find it pretty easy to pick back up again (been starting and stopping in cycles for the last year or so cause of work). Makes it more fun when I do find time to get back into it
---
The game is over anyways, how is it going against the core concept of the game? So I take it you would never ever give someone hatch at the end of the game or let them go? Or let the killer get one last hit on you at the exit gates so they get a little more bloodpoints? Those are literally the same principles.
---
killer mains use that as a fucking excuse too.  "survs are assholes so i can be an asshole"  Fuck right off.  Thats such a shitty excuse.  I dont do the shitty things survs do because im trying to be the change i want to see.  You should think the same
---
they can.  Just like humans can live how they want to.  You punch a baby = you're an asshole.  You tunnel people = you're an asshole.  I'm not saying they can't play that way, I'm saying it shows a lack of empathy and they are shitty for doing so
---
That would have scared the shit out of me
---
you're a piece of shit
---
fuck off
---
can you just shup up with your stupid comments please
---
fuck off, stop posting on my thread you aren't wanted here

you're a fucking terrible person, i blocked your ass because I never want to hear from you again

Ok since people have no chill apparently. This clip is old, like 6 months old. At this point I was probably rank 12 or 13. Right now I’m at 4. I was still learning how to play.
---
I’m a mean killer lmao
---
wot
---
I don’t understand what the problem is. Can you explain it more clearly?
---
Yos.
---
Insidious gives undetectable now,so Kindred doesn't work against it anymore.
---
:)
---
Plague would be OP
---
My anecdotal experience is that killer queues are faster than survivor during that time EST until like 1-3am. Anything outside of that range and survivor is faster.
---
Any time double BP or new killer release though, and survivor queues are soooo much faster.
---
i remember them being super bugged for a while but i dont remember how it actually worked
---
when I kill myself, I hope you realise how much of a cunt you were being for upvotes.  I hope you realise that your mockery and jest towards genuine feelings made a kid shoot themselves in the face.
---
What does DC mean?
---
They ^survivors think they can play however they want without consequences. They use the "it's a game" excuse all the time to justify their rude, cruel and toxic behaviour. They are all awful people.
---
I'm CONFUSED
---
so u want to experience the days of insta blinds, no bloodlust, old ds, vacuum pallets, BNP taking 5 seconds to get a gen done and much much more
---
you have sufficiently convinced me that you're a troll, no sane person would act like you

Boy, she's gorgeous.

There is always an idiot in a 1000000
---
When I see that survivor hop off that hook with, what, a 5% chance of success, I just sorta "Haha, you son-of-a-bitch, you did it."
---
I think it kicks him off of a gen whenever he completes skill check
---
Okay dude, first of all, I'm not doing this for karma. I couldn't care less about a meaningless internet score.
---
Second, if you are seriously considering suicide, I'm sorry if "Ok" pushed you over the edge. In all seriousness, you need to get help.
---
Here's the thing, if that's how you feel, you should be able to sympathize with how I am feeling.  If survivors' toxicity upsets you, then you know the feeling.  I'm sorry you have to feel it because it's awful, but that is the same way I feel about certain killers.  So if we both understand each others pain, why are you being rude?

hey dude, i went and looked at your profile and i saw your other posts, are you alright, man? do you need someone to talk to?

8. Bitch in post game chat or to your stream about it.
---
it was more than "okay".  You fucking made a mock of me being upset.  You belittled my emotions like fucking everybody does.  I get fucking abused and bullied every fuckign day.  Every day my dad reminds me of how fucking worthless I am.  Of how I'm a fucking object to be fuckign used and fuckign be belittled  I can tfucking take it anymore I can t take it.  You fucking are like all the people who want tme ddad i cant take it
---
You just told me to fuck off. I'm agreeing tho it's toxic on both sides. Good thing, I just had a game that no one unhooked anyone minus me and the 1 gen I got that when they all dc/quit the killer got me and dropped me at hatch. So not all is lost.
---
4%, but yes
---
isn't the lowest rank just 20?
---
Yeah
---
100% aggree. I am not very good at survivor at all. Yet I keep pipping.
---
Like do a gen and a half, get a save or two, couple heals, and go down in 20 seconds 3 times. EZ pip
---
Rank 25 didn't  punch him. It was someone he played against. Also, toxic people like to say go back to rank 25 (worst than the worse) if you lose.
---
Borrowed Time is nice, but it’s something you run only for others. There might always be someone else running it.
---
Also, I’m not a big fan of self care. It teaches bad habits

---
yea its suppose to add just a smidge of map pressure and make people a little concerned about fixing a gen too close to a idle legion.  but given the long cooldown (unless they land a frenzy) it means that the legion cant do a mint hag rag or other 3 gen strats without alot of effort.
---
Bad habits such as?
---
ive literally never seen anyone say that
---
r/woosh
---
Ok so, The blob is the "rank 1 killer/survivor", the blob decides to come out of its box and use non-meta perks. But since he is "rank 1", the players they go against would be hella hard to beat with non-meta perks. So as he is out of the box using non-meta perks, he ends up losing and then they get insulted (the punch), when they say go back to rank 25. 
---
The lowest rank is rank 20, rank 20s are usually bad, with that in mind, they are basically saying that the "Rank 1 who is using non-meta perks" is worse than a rank 20 (the lowest rank) because he lost the game as well as using really bad perks. Do you understand, if not, which part and I'll try to explain.
---
I don't really care if he plays but he's just a dick when he streams and he's a sterotypical toxic survivor and yells constantly. And this is the community he's building and moving to this game.
---
Lmfao.
---
This is hilarious, why have I never heard of this idea before.
---
I made a sarcastic comment on the internet and honestly if you can't handle that (weak ass) joke then maybe you are the person who shouldn't be here.
---
I made my comment because you are saying everyone who prefers to be the hunter rather than the hunted is a bad person. This is just plain wrong. Sure there are people who decide to take this power and bully others, but that isn't even most people. The same could be said about survivors. T-bagging and flashlight clicking are example of survivors bullying.
---
It's not just killers.
---
Those who do decide to bully others for fun are bad people, not the guy who decides to face camp you because he's trying to complete a rift challenge.
---
I'm definitely going to do this. I usually end up playing with my food as doc anyway since he's so damn good!
---
Insidious has an activation period. Before that, your aura is shown. If I'm watching Bubba right after a hook and after standing still, he's suddenly gone. I know he's just there with insidious. Undetectable didn't do shit for it tbh
---
But even if they do transfer, which I'm not for or against, that still isnt forever. You can cleanse all 5.
---
So, you have never seen an Ochido fan.
---
he already has.
---
I ended up at 68 after all challenges as well. Just finished 70 a couple hours ago.
---
No one said it would be easy :D
---
if there was an option to explain ur reasoning ppl would abuse it and it would again result in nothing a trust system would not work.
---
I think it should work as simple as this you DC in any form u lose the BP u could have gained simple as that u wanna DC well it will cost u
---
What? Please tell me your joking.😕
---
apparently not
---
I do this for lulz to see of they DC for no reason. It's the only time I use shroud of sep.
---
People already lose the BP from the match and they still DC.
---
Add adult Andy Barclay then 
---
Play With This 
---
“How you’ve grown!” - Chucky
---
After pallet stunning a killer gain the haste status affect for 10/15/20 seconds
---
We’re Friends to the End.
---
“This is the end, friend.” - Andy Barclay 
---
After final generator has been completed the killer will be unable to see you, or teammates auras.
---
Child’s Play 
---
“You’re it, pal!” - Nika 
---
When the killer is within 18 metres of an unhooked survivor, they will gain the haste status affect and will not leave bloodstains or scratch marks until the survivor exits the killers terror-radius. In the event the killer lands a hit on the unhooked survivor the survivor will have to mend. The killer will be blinded momentarily.
---
As someone who plays Doc, thank you for this evil idea I love it!
---
I watch YouTube on my phone, meet a girl, start getting serious, get married, argue about where we're going in life, go through a messy divorce, drown my sorrow in a river of vodka, rob a store, go to jail, receive parole, meet a woman, get my life back on track, get married again, have a child, have a second child, watch them grow, put them in college, grow old with my wife, attend her funeral, return home, then I wait 15 more minutes and get into a game...then immediately all survivors dc
---
2real :(
---
Damn.
---
I actually has another survivor trap me in a room the entire game during a farm match. Killer thought it was funny so left me. Was stuck there until EGC.
---
They found farming boring so decided to trap me in a room. Told me to learn to loop to complete my 4stun challenge.
---
Never before have I ever took time out of my day to record report someone by making a ticket.
---
My problem with farmers is that instead of getting 20-25k in like 8 mins they like to stretch it to 30k over 20+ mins. It's just boring and not even efficient BP gains.
---
Am I the only one that thinks that the Wraith and Spirit look kinda cute with this art style?
---
I don’t think that would be enough of a deterrent. For example, I had someone DC on me because they, “didn’t want to get hooked in the basement,” but stuck around for the end of the game since they were in a SWF. If they’d had a time delay punishment for DCing, they might have thought twice about it, since they couldn’t have immediately hopped into a new game with their friends.
---
I did the same thing, did you get the idea from that one thread on here a few days ago too?
---
Give him the hat
---
H a t
---
No terror radius doc is fun, I like dark devotion on him cuz nobody expects to be jumpscared by a freacking doctor.
---
Yup, that's the one!!
---
The king himself has replied to my post, I am honoured.
---
The first game I tried it I got put against a trapper. I got his attention and got to a pallet and got a stun. Not bad, I think, only three more. I had a flashlight so he didn't break it untill I was like 30 feet away to ensure I didn't blind him. No big deal, didn't even want the blind. I start running to the next loop and this dude straight 180s and walks away. I need to get chased so I figure screw it, I'll chase him down to get his attention. This dude starts placing traps down right in my face so I try to get his attention with a click or two. This dude then sends me a DM over Xbox live telling me to fuck off an calling me toxic, saying he wasn't gonna chase me. I might understand if I had looped this dude for 2 gens or something, but this game JUST started and I stunned him once. I see his ruin like 2 feet away, and say well if you won't chase me I'll pop your ruin. He literally body blocks the ruin and messages me again telling people like me are ruining dbd, and that he's just going to go afk all game. I honestly don't know why this guy was so mad, I even offered to farm traps for him, but he was not having any of it. I just wanted to do my archive challenge :(
---
Never played Feng to begin with, I was Claudette with the Wedding outfit then became an Ash main then Yui
---
She slammed the hatchet into the stool and then gave it a good spin for fun
---
I wish I was this lucky lol.
---
Don't most killers kick gens and break pallets all the time? Which is what triggers the perks, it's just usually not very helpful, since then how are you supposed to use this information? Run away every time?
---
honestly I think the game decided you deserve that 4% since your teammate left you for dead, a definite gg in my books
---
Trust me, you learn to hold m1 and run in circles pretty quickly
---
The killer is really laggy, how is that the console versions fault?
---
I want to give this an award but I can't. :(
---
Exactly
---
Wow people are really upset that it says rank 25 and they don’t understand it. just means ur worse than people at rank 20 there’s literally no more explanation needed it is just a joke no need to be 100% accurate yeez
---
probably the case tbh but i'll take it nonetheless
---
Every time I succeed a skill check it takes me off of what I am on
---
Filthy, I absolutely love it 🤘🏻
---
I hit a skill check good then it takes me off
---
rEsPeCt ThE 4
---
Woah there
---
I hear ya, I have people not like that I won’t “meme with them” but I’m just here to get paid. There have been DLC sales since the summer almost consecutively and I have a ton of teachable to unlock so I just need to put as many of you on hooks as fast as possible and I’m sorry I won’t be joining the horseplay.
---
How dare you not know about our god flamingkitty u mad. You shall suffer the punishment of death.
---
nothing is enough to deterrent DCs unless the whole community changes but u see how well it is going trying to shun campers
---
As a killer main, this happens way too often. I don't usually complain tho
---
Nah I like farming, but that was ridiculous!
---
I enjoy the rift. I found the gameplay a little tedious after a while as I felt there was nothing to work towards. So the tome and rift fix that for me. Plus i think the lore is really cool. However, the "complete in a single trial" ones need to go. They are frustrating and not fun to do. I don't care if the numbers go up for the challenges like "fix 25 generators" or whatever, just don't add single trial challenges.
---
*everywhere I go I see this bullshit
---
The game measures survivor success in black and white, while killers have a sliding scale, so moods based on performance can be soured harder. In-universe, they are the victims, which might make them feel like that after a match, too (although they have more bully tools). They also are more numerous and might feel safety in numbers (even if they're teammates don't participate with them). They also have more opportunities to fuck up but recover, which can inflate the egos of less than humble people. Unlike killers, some survivors can also choose to blame teammates if the match goes poorly.
---
I don't mean to put anyone on blast. I play more survivor than killer, and there are certainly ways to be mean as killer. It's just the experience differs in more ways than just the obvious mechanics. Ultimately, I don't care much for the whole "toxic" label, I just see it as taunting with varying degrees of playfulness or hostility.
---
Agreed. I love grinding and working towards goals. Just no more single trial ones please.
---
I've been playing 3 years I know and I can't it's not on the bloodweb yet for the survivor I'm using and no sometimes it's brutal to the point where you can hardly do crap that's the reality sometimes.
---
I was thinking a voting system between survivors within the first 2 minutes to cancel the match would be a good idea but then this could just ruin the game for the killer giving survivors vote to quit because they don’t like playing against certain killers or something.
---
I know what you mean lol
---
Maybe a "sportsmanship" medal that combines things like tunneling, camping, etc. IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS. This would most likely make the game more fun for survivors and make the medals better for killers.
---
It’s soo boring. I’d rather play a regular match so I can actually do stuff and have fun. The only time I farm is if I’m the last survivor, so I can live. BP is too easy to get to waste time farming.
---
That's it? Sounds like a good day to me (unfortunately).
---
Each side has its toxic Ive had to turn off direct messages and friend requests due to how much i got hate mail no matter which side Im on.
---
Thats not lag, thats a feature /s
---
especially if you could walk around with your killer in some sort of room
---
Honestly after watching rise of skywalker vader would make a good killer.
---
Toxiccccc
---
Exactly. If I have a teammate disconnect, or I get killed because of the glitch. Why should the game punish me for leaving that match?
---
If i see no one with bbq should i just assume that they are near the hook or?
---
Platform xbox one
---
Instead of shunning campers just do gens
---
That survivors gonna be pissed.
---
Works on PS4 too, at least last time I tried.
---
This just reminds me that I'd appreciate DS becoming deactivated if you get grabbed out of a locker. It should be used as an anti-tunneling tool, not "I'm a dumbass who wants a get-out-of-jail-free card" tool.
---
Disconnect
---
yea but that requires ppl to take responsibility and admit their fuck ups which the DBD community rly doesn't do a lot

---
Thank you for letting me know!
---
You should learn to form a proper sentence.
---
usually yes but a survivor can kinda hide behind gen auras and ofc inside lockers but mainly BBQ is just nice bc it is a good passive boost
---
I'm not like most people, so I will be buying the next Rift unlike others. Why? Eh, just because I feel like it and in all honesty, I truthfully had fun doing these Archive Missions. Stressful and challenging sure, but that's the fun in my opinion. Gives me a reason to press on and challenge myself, great feeling of accomplishment at the end really. (Yeah, I have no life)
---
I know right. I thought about the shade thing when I was up against a spirit. Thinking that could be a way to balance her when she is phasing maybe, but realizing it wouldn’t really work.
---
Mkay ty again
---
Yeah or like being iron maiden if they in a locker
---
It's not even hard to read
---
Exactly. Having this perk gives survivors so much wiggle room and allows them to play with mistakes with no penalty.
---
Yeah, if post game chat is any indicator at least. Solid 80% of my games are toxic with my fellow survivors complaining.
---
UNLESS the killer is face camping me in the basement and I see someone on their way to help, which is what the killer wants. They play like a twat and use me as bait to get everyone into the almost impossible to escape dungeon (this killer usually has a one hit down), I’ll be damned if I let that POS take advantage of my teammates altruism. I’ll hang out as long as I possibly can to but time but the second I see my teammate getting ready to head down for me, if I can hear the heartbeat OR see them, I take the L.
---
The DBD community isn't very bright I agree, I can light camp and get 4k 32k BP way more often than I should be able to.
---
if you read a book called "how to not be a grammar cunt and learn that shit doesn't matter on the internet" I think that will tell u everything u need to know
---
If it's a wraith I follow him around bc hes my husband and I love him. 
---
On father campbells we find the horse and poke him till killer finds us 
---
If a killer is nice to us we die for them in end game they deserve it 
---
Always leave a gift to the nice killer if you dont wanna stay behind and die. 
---
Photobomb as many moris as I can before I get mori'd 👈😎👈

who the fuck cares anymore

I just watch memes
---
I could care less about proper grammar, but your original post is so badly worded you cant even tell what the hell you are talking about.
---
Any it's swordbro I remember that guy from the DBD discord that I got banned from bc apparently jokes aren't allowed the man who thinks camping is fun
---
ITS A FEW DAYS LATE BUT PIGS SEEM TO BE THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE. I JUST GOT INTO THIS GAME A FEW DAYS AGO SO IM STILL NEW ANY ADVICE WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL ON HOW TO BE A DECENT SURVIVOR AND HOW TO KITE. 
---
ALSO TIPS ON THE HAG AND PIG CAUSE THEY GET ME REAL GOOD
---
BHVR finally fixed the long killer lobbies!
---
All the people who cry about camping on this forum as well as the people who cry in messages after the game,they care
---
There is a gap with killers where early on its harder to rank because you can't de-rank until you get past rank 15, so it tries to find survivors in your skill range. Next it'll just throw you into whatever match after a certain period of time as a "priority line" type deal. It's easier to queue as killer at higher ranks because less killers are playing since it's much more stressful for some players to play killer at high ranks than it is survivor.
---
Is this an American thing? I did the challenge on first try on Haddonfield. 
---
Side note: I was Billy with Agititation, Iron Grasp, Enduring and Pallet Fury.
---
"I could care less about proper grammar" also u "but your original post is so badly worded" talk about being hypocritical
---
God said you can't have this one today, Danny
---
so? I could cry about something that is unfun what would that change?
---
Absolutely.  When you make shit perks and really good perks and a few mediocre perks, most folks gravitate to the really good ones.  Duh.
---
IMAGINE HAVING TO M1 AS LEATHERFACE LMFAOOO
---
Doesn't change my point about the game's shitty design.  If you ignore how your player base plays, and just throw shit out there, you get what we got.
---
Don't release m1/rb/r1 when the skill check appears
---
Atleast it wasn’t a 4 killer vs 1 survivor
---
Am I the only one the reads OwO as a word and not a face
---
A big reason is that many players rely on stealth to evade the killer, Doctor pretty much negates that.
---
If you can, bring both, otherwise bring tremors if you’re running pgtw
---
This was made by the crapper.
---
heehee face camp funnee
---
I cried laughing. Here I thought it was just gonna be the bloodweb.
---
CURRENTLY USING SPINECHILL AND IN ALL HONESTY IT JUST SPIKES MY ANXIETY. WILL LOOK INTO MORE YOUTUBE VIDEOS FOR HELP AND MAY PLAY KILLER FOR ONCE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM. THANKS FOR THE HELP!!
---
It was an add on I think but idk I don’t play ghost face
---
2 words. Calm spirit - sincirly jake main(if you don't use it, than you are bad survivor. Cuz so many killers run that screaming perk in red ranks. And i saw 0 people using calm spirit)
---
I completely agree. I'm having so much fun with these challenges. I love that it gives me something to work towards. I like grinding in games. I love the lore and I love the value of stuff you get for $10.
---
Did you not hit record after being picked up by the killer so we could review the earlier footage?
---
This is why I like the new kindred so much. Fuck u I see you insidious leatherface and corner lurking trapper. 
---
On the flip side if I'm on the hook we are waiting out the full 120 seconds while I watch those gens pop cause I'm petty like that.
---
I dont
---
I... I did not think that was going to be a real sub.
---
There's no addon that makes survivors exposed before the game even starts.
---
I made sure
---
But muh immersion   /s
---
Maybe you loaded in too late and was probably because of connection! Happens with me when loading in my survivor friends are already moving around
---
When I thought the Doctor couldn't get more terrifying both in and out of universe...
---
Should have just slowly turned towards them and stared until they figured it out. Then take your swing as they try to run away. Either way, hilarious clip!
---
Credit to Scammer on the DBD Discord for the image.
---
He was in the animation which considered it "carrying a survivor". However the killer is immune during the animation. So yes, you did blind him while he was carrying a survivor, but you didn't time it correctly.
---
Yeah I recorded it, just can't to the laptop atm. I'll definitely post it later
---
Overall, Freddy is pretty easy to learn. However, you have to learn to play him properly to make him viable at the red ranks.
---
I would highly recommend you look up Fungoose on youtube and watch him play Freddy. He plays Freddy perfectly and you can learn a lot from watching him since he explains why he does what he does while playing. If you’re interested in watching more of his Freddy videos, you can look him up on Twitch
---
no its still good! i think streamers dont use it bc its not necessarily an entertaining/flashy perk to watch but its still probably the strongest counter to all the stealth killers. i also use it on all survs along with bond so i know what's happening at all times.
---
I don’t personally play on xbox. Are you able to remap the skillcheck button to an alternate? This would see if it is that particular button having an issue. (Could also be your button for the action.. aka gen repair key).
---
Alternatively, do you have a spare controller that you could see if the problem is still there, which would help narrow down the issue to the controller and so you know it’s not an issue with anything inside the game.
---
I play with Doc for a long time, maining him at rank 1.
---
I run BBQ, Pop, Discordance and Overcharge.
---
Addons mostly King+yellow electrode, or double tape.
---
Bond is also under rated
---
Not going to lie, if we got an Oni skin where his Kanabō was replaced with a Cardboard Gift Wrapping Tube that made a *Fwhump* sound when you smacked people I would instantly become an Oni one trick.
---
Alright thanks

Jesus christ what the hell is going on here? 😂

Aw how cute. A face camping blackface bubba

Not the controller I tried it

Oh ok I’ve never played him

killer main trying to trick survivor mains into not using exhaustion perks
---
The first time I saw the pool of devotion, I was trying to figure out what it was. I was then smacked with her weapon and hooked. Still didn't know what the pool was used for until later in the game.

_ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR HORNY ADOLESCENT LITTLE MIND!?_
---
I love Piggie. I hate that her add-ons kinda blow compared to other killers. She's a lot of fun to play with Whispers so you can cover the whole map at full speed and still sneak up on people.

Undetectable refers to being able to have your aura read, red stain, and terror radius. Spine chill and premonition don’t use any of the mentioned to detect a killer and still work against stealth killers.

It’s always the quiet ones that turn on ya. ;) lol! I’ve been against some truly mean ones, but I suppose you could say that about any character.
---
Of course. It’s science.
---
Ughh, i really don't understand how can anyone watch this guy for more than 2 minutes x\_x 
---
This guy is awful and disrespectful towards almost everyone, and of course his community is defending him like : "But he's playing a character and is only toxic on stream to make it more entertaining" like it's a fucking excuse lmao. This guy need some help managing his tantrums.
---
Bruh TBH I think demos chase music is really good. It's unique.
---
oh god yeah blight spirits just want to ruin your day
---
Anything I can find about a similar issue is saying that it could be that your buttons are on the same “axis” 
---
lb = repair
---
rb = skill check 
---
since it’s the same axis, it would cancel it out 
---
but without knowing what buttons you have on what, I can’t say for sure.. I’d say if that’s not the issue to contact support
---
Goodluck on fixing that, it sounds dreadful
---
Colourised
---
The first hook usually costs three gens if there is no Ruin
---
I see through your lies
---
Lmfao that’s what he gets!!!! Cherry on top would be the insta dc once everyone is back in the chat room!
---
I literally use Diversion, Any Means Necessary, Resilience and OoO and I could survive at rank 1 with no perks if it weren't for you dumbass boosted babies getting downed in 20 second chases
---
I only DC now when a killer is actively playing toxicaclly. Like a Clown downed me and kept throwing bottles at my body. I quit. A killer who constantly shakes their head no at me, as if they have skill after hitting me 5 feet away from a window. A tunnelling piece of shit only trying to make someone's life miserable.
---
I don't deal with bullshit anymore
---
spoiler alert: they're reading the survivor rulebook
---
It might not be as bad as it was, but it's ridiculously strong considering it doesn't even rely on any pink add-ons. The killer wasn't good, but the game took so long that even though he was basically oblivious he could eventually find us (plus I refused to let the last survivor bleed out and camp hatch instead of trying for the last gen).
---
And I get that sometimes you're able to use your OP add-ons and run train on survivors, but I don't think I'm good because I got a 4k with Iri Belt Huntress. It's just a lot rarer to be able to run that build than the Freddy one.
---
True
---
Would you like to read other comments? Plus that’s not very holiday spirit is it really?
---
I feel sorry for those who haven’t experienced the power of a ny bacon egg and cheese on a toasted new york bagel :/
---
Imagine a mode with 16 survivors and 4 killers
---
They were so good together.
---
I'm going to be honest, I play PC and the doctor is my most hated killer. It's just so annoying constantly screaming and having skill checks bounce around your screen. And hia disgusting laugh, I HATE it. 
---
I'm against dcing so I never do.. but man, like 50% of my enjoyment of the game is gone as soon as I find out it's a doc.
---
I would love it
---
In case you are wondering, I was chasing a Feng who tried to hide her, I downed her, pick her up, get stuck, let her go instead and I'm still stuck. I tried to get out but to no avail.
---
What ? Did I quit ? Yes. Yes of course I quit, what else was I supposed to do ?
---
Is insidious finally useful?
---
At this point the Legion nerf wouldn’t even be noticeable
---
Really? The pedophile?
---
Everything is your fault and you should feel bad
---
Legion is a bit tricky but once you get the hang of home he is so much fun he’s my main killer behind trapper
---
No, many trustworthy Killer mains will tell you Legion is worst killer in the game. But you can still manage to do well if you yourself are good. If you don’t care about rank, then I would go for it, just expect DCs and getting looped ad Infinitum by good survivors.
---
No one with even 2 brain cells gets down in 20 seconds.

Wait what?

Also fuck nurse

---
Tbagging has always been a disrespectful thing in the gaming community. It just shows your lack of respect for the opponent. And It shows that you think of your self as higher since you have to brag(Tbag).
---
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE HE FELT LIKE FLEXING OR THEY GAMED THE SYSTEM SOMEHOW SO THAT THEY KNEW THEY'D GO AGAINST A LOW RANK KILLER.
---
what’s wrong with hillbilly and ghostface?
---
Because that's dlc
---
That looks like a trick I'll be using, thanks!
---
OchiDo? I've never heard of him before. What he'd do?
---
Shoot I kinda do care about ranked, yet I wanna have fun, idk we'll see. I'm really just focused on getting wraith to Max level and stuff lol.
---
I didn't know that...? But his videos were kinda... funny. Not that I tried to ever be toxic like him.
---
After dumping around 2000 hours of wasted time into Destiny 1/2 and losing all respect for bungie, the very last thing I would ever want to see is Activision making more money they absolutely do not deserve off of dead by daylight.
---
Don’t listen to the negative comments. I play Legion a lot at red ranks and make due quite well (though not all the time).
---
Thanat - MUST. It gives survivors a penalty for not healing. The best way to play Legion is to not heal as a survivor. Thanat forces them to heal or forces them to eat 16% slow down.
---
Stridor - Very good with good headset. I can track very well with this and it can even help at loops.
---
Enduring - The lunge while in frenzy is huge and it might even cause a survivor to panic drop a pallet after getting stabbed. This greatly benefits you as you are right back in the chase. Also don’t be afraid of eating pallets again.
---
Spirit Fury - Eh. I’d run it with his iridescent button add-on along with Enduring. But I wouldn’t run it aside from that.
---
Blood Echo - Could be useful as it negates all exhaustion perks. It’s another penalty for survivors for choosing to not heal. But I wouldn’t say it’s a go to.
---
I’m All Ears - Underrated. Gives you an edge with downing already injured survivors. 
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse - First, allows you to sneak up on survivors and potentially get multiple survivors stabbed by not allowing them time to seperate. Second, will increase your terror radius after hitting someone which allows a larger range to see heartbeats.
---
You can combo Ruin/Pop/Bbq as you like.
---
As for add-ons. Anything that extends your frenzy timer is best. Getting all survivors stabbed early is the best way to get the game going in your favor. And you want to run perks that punished survivors for being injured. And if they heal, just stab em again.
---
Well, they were fine, but he's using the same clips, and audio effects every damn time. Kinda gets boring after a while
---
Bungee is no longer partnered with Activision though, and Bungie owns all the rights to Destiny.
---
Legion is pretty good at lower ranks which im assuming ur at since u just got the game and hes a basic killer making him easy to learn. But he has been nerfed hard recently to the point where id say hes the worst killer in the game atm. That being said though any killer can be good enough to win with if ur good enough with said killer, some killers just need more love to be considered good. If I were to recommend a killer to u it would be spirit she is hella strong,fun to play, and very easy to learn and pick up as long as u use headphones.
---
I mean of course every single online game is going to have some random matchmaking experiences and everything however, DBD gets me really burned out when I consistently get tunneled and camped while my random teammates are urban evading around the map while they are selfcaring with sloppy butcher.
---
Old survivor main youtuber. Posted annoying montaged content that was heavily edited with cartoon sound effects of the same boring shit like a basic 360 on a baby killer, or a killer walking past them as they crouched in a corner. Got permabanned for being so incredibly toxic that he created hordes of toxic survivor mains trying to be like him.
---
Well I mean when versing plague you shouldn’t cleanse so I don’t think it cuz she forces you to do something other than gens more that she practically has no ed the whole game or an ultimate death beam
---
Got to Rank 12 and camping seems to be the meta. I've yet to see BT show up for any character I've played yet so not sure if it's even available.
---
How is it too situational ? As far as i know, there is no other perk that shows the killer’s aura as often as alert does. Killers break and kick all the time. When it is not swf, it is great for map control. 
---
I wouldnt spare a slot for it because there are other ones i favor more, but it sounds like people underrate it a lot here.
---
I have played Oni mostly after nerf and I still think he is really great and viable like Freddy and Nurse without being game breaking as spirit.
---
I dont know really what problem you guys have.
---
I use it so I can hide. big brain :D
---
I end up doing chase when I do tho so...yeah get your point
---
Sry then my opinion is moot, regardless 0Respect for bunjie selling out, cutting content to release as dlc then removing free content to re-add it as dlc. Anything destiny related should stay in it’s on universe (imo)
---
Do like the idea of crossovers though👍
---
They really aren't op, they're the weakest killer and people still bitch that they're op
---
Is ninja really playing dead by Daylight on stream? Yes. I think his wife is super into the game so they play together sometimes. He still plays other things but yeah, he plays this too.
---
Ohhh so salty survivors complaining about a shit killer? Lol
---
Outside of a bad day they've mastered skill checks? 
---
 Lol......really now? 
---
And how come I'm red rank and dont come across these 'Master of Skill-Check Survivors. I played 15 matches today[Only 1 Killer didnt have ruin but he had Dying Light and Thana with Pop which was 1000% more sweaty]  and had at bare minimun 1 d/c per game before even a single gen was completed. 
---
 Hell, over half the survivors I had today couldnt even loop. They just instant drop every pallet they see. And that was just today, the last 2 months have been even worse. 
---
 Farming unhooks, no borrowed time, suiciding on hooks, sand-bagging, Chest Looters, Locker whores, urban evasion Neas doing nothing for 8 minutes, missing skill checks out the ass....You name it. And the main reason these survivors dont do anything productive? Yup, you guessed it: Ruin....
---
 Forget the 'bad day', survivors I get are having a bad year.
---
Well I mean if they’re remotely good killer why would you bother playing the game?
---
I may consider spirit, thank you kindly.
---
I'm ok with recolors of other cosmetics, but having multiple recolors of a charm in the same rift must go.
---
i don’t care if they’re good i care if it’s fun to play against. spirit is not fun to play against. neither is nurse. neither is a freddy, especially since they almost always use dying light, thanatophobia, jump rope and swing chains.
---
I play on steam.
---
When I play Trapper against people with OoO who are just looking at you until you come close, I feel myself super uncomfortable setting traps. One of the rare instances I can straight up camp because I don't want to deal with this.
---
I mean, you said you're high purple rank vsing all red ranks right? How is that bad matchmaking? High purple rank is rank 5. One more rank and you will be red rank also. I dont see a problem here. 
---
Also matchmaking pairs you with people within 6 ranks of you. So in this scenario, it's working as intended. 
---
Honestly just work on improving. Who gives a shit what you're vsing. Its shitty getting stomped hard in a match but just use those games as a learning tool. Your going to lose anyway right? Try and practice something you've been struggling with. Watch how the players you're up against move and loop and try to implement it into how you run things. 
---
It's all good my dude. Just mute chat so you dont get triggered after the match, look at the results and move on. I'll bet you shit on the next few teams you vs so why get so worked up over a single game ya know?
---
Final note, stop with the nonsense "cant balance the game but you can put out more dlc" crap. It's a ridiculous argument.
---
play the game how you want, but theres a sort of body language people acquire after playing the game for a while. especially if you play both sides you'll know when people want to just chill or meme
---
That’s fine man. I’ve become too invested in the franchise to pull out now myself. Hopefully though Bungie wins you back one day with a new game because the improvements they’ve made to Destiny have been pretty good QoL stuff. Nothing really major outside of the expansions and seasons they’ve got going on, but just want you to know Bungie now seems so much better than when Activision was interfering.
---
Bike helmet Dwight.
---
Baby Dweet is a myth.
---
People do this are hella useless but that’s called being a shitty teammate but isn’t sandbagging whatsoever. Sandbagging is intentionally leading the killer to teammates and fucking them over which this doesn’t sound like.
---
posts like this*
---
burn it with fire
---
Okay, but were the issues I stated fixed? Or is it all still in a bad shape? How's FPS? Latency?
---
i think this game needs more emotes
---
I thought he got banned because he called witch hunts on his streams.
---
" Outside of a bad day they've mastered skill checks?"  
---
Played my non-main killer and used Ruin.  It was actually in a great place.  Not only away from gens but surrounded on 3 sides.  Not one alert went off from failed skill check.  
---
"Hell, over half the survivors I had today couldnt even loop. "  
---
I get the same when I play survivor.  I don't get that as killer.  
---
My gripe is simply as killer, I'm getting "pro" (exaggeration) players quite often.
---
Ah, I was mistaken then. Sorry for the misinformation.
---
I'm just asking, maybe to prevent this happening again or dodging the lobby if you can notice it early enough
---
If you want to hold onto Wraith for now to rank up, his Sloppy + Nurses Calling + Catacomb build is easily A tier right now. Very powerful in the right hands, and will teach you more about stopping loops than Legion brain dead 2nd hit. I’d personally stay away and just grab perks for your Wraith, but it’s all up to you.
---
first of all, fuck the nurse u didn't need to add that second of all survivor is fucking stressful I play both sides more than ever and having to deal with shitty teammates is worse then having to deal with some funny survivors trying to be cool
---
Ghostface is better.
---
Myers starts the game moving at 4.2m/s with no lunge, until he stalks enough to reach Evil Within II. This really hurts against good teams, whi can often get a gen or two done while you are stuck in EW1. That said, in EW1, he has no terror radius or red-stain.
---
GF can gain these benefits at will, without the lunge or movement speed penalties.
---
While Myers exposes *everyone* for 60s, and GF only exposes the person he was stalking for 45s, GF can stalk way faster than Myers can. However Myers' stalking has no reliable counter, whereas you can just look at GF to stop him stalking.
---
Ash is really weird looking today
---
It's not tunneling then because you just hooked someone else?
---
I’ve had games where I have perfect ping and it’s working brilliantly and then the next game I play it decides to lag like crazy and disconnect me. When I see the end screen it tells me the killer also disconnected. The issue here is since there’s no post game chat now I can’t ask if the killer disconnected first or if it was me who disconnected. 
---
I had a killer game where I spawned in and my character wouldn’t move. Like my mouse was on screen and moving but my character refused to do anything. After spamming a bunch of buttons I managed to get it working but then a few minutes in a survivor is running into a wall and I’m hitting him repeatedly before it disconnects me. 
---
None of my disconnects are ever intentional and I hope all the forced ones don’t result in a ban
---
He did get one there,but we don't know how he was playing before the end game, whether he was camping, tunneling, etc... in the endgame a lot of killers throw those things out the window to secure the last kills.
---
He is annoying to play against esp with the scream countering shit. That being said I don't dc. It's just frustrating to miss a pallet drop or vault or anything over the scream when it already is buggy and shitty enough. The amount of time I have missed a pallet due to finding a deadzone where I don't get a drop/vault option,or slow vaulting cause I didn't approach it at the exact perfect angle so I got hit 10 feet from the window.
---
On top of all the buggy shit losing over a scream that happens at the most bs moment really rubs shit in your face. The issue lately is DH activating and still getting hit or vaccumed into a wall or the killer for some damn reason.
---
Dance with me is better than fixated ????
---
Nothing will change, if anything we'll get more players who try to emulate him and will get crushed by any killer with a modicum of sense.
---
Thanks for the laugh! Pig one got me.
---
https://youtu.be/7TEavEjQbB4
---
It can glitch out, iirc.
---
If the Survivor doesn't let go of the repair button while the gen is exploding, then the gen will appear white as if it were regressing d3spite the Survivor actively repairing it.
---
you're annoyingit is just getting old at this point
---
Every time I don’t use the same perks I get gen rushed to hell
---
You're a toxic cunt
---
Too early
---
I'm gunna assume you're referring to Ruin. It's certainly good and hard to replace, but in my experience using Corrupt Intervention and Thrilling Tremors does wonders. It completely blocks off gens, and good survivors can power through Ruin anyways.
---
I use tremors and PGW cause I cause I don’t have ruin yet
---
You probably did that too early
---
I see no god up there 
---
O T H E R T H A N M E
---
You see, that's when you make the galaxy-brain play and set a trap directly behind another trap.  It may only work once every thirty games, but when it does work, you'll wonder how you ever managed to achieve orgasm without a double-trap-turbo-play.
---
Thank you very much! It all sounds like quite the progress in the right direction. However, if the performance is still crap then I'll have to skip. I'll keep an eye out if a performance patch drops in the future.
---
&gt;Every time I don’t use the same perks I get gen rushed to hell
---
[X]Doubt.
---
You must be **playing badly** every match to get "gen rushed" every time. Yes **some times** you'll get destroyed by survivors because of bad map RNG or simply because they are better but not every match. 
---
Just like you go against good survivors, you'll get below average ones too.
---
Claudette. Black coat David’s. And Susie legion
---
Toxic is how someone acts, not how he looks like. For me the coloured hair is just the cherry on the cake if someone is already toxic.
---
There are some normal players too and I would play Feng Min with her Mask and blue hair too, but I don't want to be treated like I'm one of the toxic ones even I'm not
---
What if... you just took your hate for that killer and learned to counter it?
---
I hate some killers but I never dc. I've gotten pretty good against some of the killers I hate. Same with maps, the more you hate it the more of a challenge to be bested it is.
---
Devs nerfed the game when complaints over tomb challenges being to hard. Throw ninja in the mix with his tween demographic and i am wondering about more nerfed changes.
---
how do you counter plague?
---
u wont notice it until u load it  I know a YTer that knows how to do the glitch IAMcow
---
Ok it’s pretty much exactly 50/50.
---
Well, i have to hurry in getting rank 1 surv, cuz with teammates such as those i wont be getting there any time soon xD
---
Number says you got less than 2
---
Bar shows the actual progress. You healed ~1.5 stayed
---
Nurse’s Calling and Monitor And Abuse are amazing on Myers
---
**DESTROY THE CHILD**
---
**CORRUPT THEM ALL**
---
And he's just so whiny. Its like listening to an 8 year old being destroyed in a game
---
You don't cleanse for most of the game. You look behind yourself and dodge the puke, using the mapnto your advantage.
---
Maybe at red ranks you can't but at purple/green ranks a plague is playable.
---
he was a pedo,? he
---
he still uploads to this day..
---
Few more: nurse got nerfed, spirit got nerfed, balance landing got nerfed, insta heal medkit removed, kindred got buffed
---
Freddy, kinda op so i dont have to sweat lol
---
I agree that survivor ranking is indeed easier to achieve and I know the same ranks can represent varying levels of skill but I doubt you'd argue that a consistently rank 8/7 killer is anything like a consistently rank 1 killer.  Likewise, a consistently rank 6 survivors is unlikely to be anywhere near in skill as a consistently rank 1 or 2 survivor.    
---
Now take those ranks and add SWF with comms and tell me what you think that does to the calculus.
---
I'd be ranting a lot less (would likely be perfectly content), if there was no SWF.  We all know that SWF with comms gets so much information that an all-solo-queue group does not yet the game is balanced for an all solo-queue group.  
---
I don't like shut out games for me or the survivors.  That's not fun.  I'm not looking to win every game.  A roughly .500 batting record would rock.  I can only get near that if I actively dodge SWFs as best I can and that takes a lot of work.    
---
As I said in another post I literally had to dodge 5 lobbies in a row earlier to avoid 3-4 man SWFs abd even 2 man SWFs can be very unbalancing still.  
---
I suspect that if I bet big money on whether most matches involved SWFs (at least 2-man), I'd win that bet.  If that is true, why the hell aren't the devs doing anything to address it?  
---
i appreciate your take on the subject but it just doesn't match my experience as killer.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eg9d45/hooooooooooonk/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
But it's not about understanding in this instance. If the same tactic is being used on you and you're dying within 3 mins of the game starting everytime with no real way of learning how to counter it because it's always happening... then you don't get to love the game, you log off and never look back.
---
I hated the game when I first started but luckily played as a coward and hugged the wall until the first survivor started getting chased...
---
The tactic turns players off, fast. It also lessens the player pool for killers to hop in with as a result 👍
---
Why don't they just jump the fence ?
---
200 IQ
---
Yeah, waiting times in lobbies is just... horrible.
---
A Wizard did it
---
Bro... no one took it that way. 👍
---
He doesn’t move around in DBD or real life I guess
---
SICK face camp!!!
---
i dont think the devs will let his audience have much influence over the game but then again the louder you cry
---
I have to try this sometime, that's so mean
---
I will be. I still think the best move is just to play how you want and buy the rift just before it closes if you think you've completed enough for it to be worth it.
---
This.
---
As a killer, I don't want to have to learn the difference between a slow vault and a fast vault 20 times
---
A fake illusion, you say?
---
I know this is a meme, but it's not four perks, it's more like 
---
DH/BL/SB/Lithe (Pick 1) + Adren/IW/BT/Self-Care (Pick 2-3) + Kindred/Spine Chill/Unbreakable/We'll Make It/Bond/Empathy (Pick 1, if you're feeling *brave* /s)
---
Killer equivalent would be
---
Hex: Ruin (or Corrupt Intervention for the *brave*), BBQC, and Whispers/NC/PGTOW/SB/STBFL (Pick two, depending on your killer)
---
Good point
---
I agree, I think too that they are lazy and bring just new content because it's much easier to do something new and it brings money
---
Devs have already described this as their exact plan
---
&gt;\- Why dont the killers just... run? Only a few killers seem to be able to do this, and its obvious that they are walking. LIfe would be much easier for them if they all just ran.
---
&gt;
---
The entity enhances the physical powers of killers. Most of them alreaďy move at 115% speed (a normal human running is 100%). Since they already move at their maximum speed running would do nothing but look silly.
---
&gt;\- Why dont killers just... Jump over pallets and vaults like legion? Its obvious its possible.
---
Killers can't jump, they can only fall. Possibly due to their increased body size and mass (again, entity shenanigans)
---
&gt;\-How can a pot-smoking Quinton and an athletic Meg, among others, know how to repair a generator?
---
I aöways imagine the generators as having loose screws, that you have to tighten with your bare hands. Not a difficult task, but a tedious one.
---
&gt;\-Why dont survivors just.. kill the killers? If they sabotaged the hooks and used the hooks as a weapon, four people could easily kill a Legion, Trapper etc, since they are still human.
---
Because death is not an escape, it's basically in the title, there is no killing in the fog, only going back to the campfire, and whatever dark chambers killers go to.
---
I really wasn't being rude at all in my post and you reply with this? Lmao. Clearly you dont know how to have a discussion. I dont know if it's because reddit is just toxic overall so you naturally get defensive and lash out. Or maybe you are just a child. I'm not going to keep replying if your going to act like a fucking bitch the entire time. If my original post was insulting to you then you really need to get off the internet man..whatever I'll give it one more shot. 
---
First point was a misunderstanding. I thought you meant high purple like rank 5. Not low purple  8. Cool. 
---
How exactly is a 6 rank difference shit? If you cant beat someone a few ranks above you then you shouldn't be ranking up. 
---
Your NBA reference isnt very accurate. A high school team vsing pros would be like a literal first time player vs a rank 1. Red to purple would be more like a top playoff seed vs a bottom playoff seed. Which happens in literally every sport. 
---
We all get annoyed by teabagging and flashlight spam. If you cant get over it, that's your problem. 
---
And I stand by my final point. It's a garbage argument and you havent said otherwise so yeah.
---
This man's 9 year old army was able to have an affect on fortnite, a Multi-million dollar game, only God knows what they can do to something as small as DBD
---
I'd have done what I usually do which is get a picture of the in game store but it cuts into her headress because of the ui, which won't look good.
---
Is he relevant enough though? Ever since he moved to mixer each time I've checked he had like a fourth of the viewers he had in twitch after becoming irrelevant in Fortnite. Don't know about his YouTube views or any other stuff, but I assumed he's using mixer as a retirement home.
---
There's a lot more to it now so yes definitely
---
I get that. Again I'm not for this idea. I think hex totems are fine right now. That wasn't my point though lol
---
I play both sides but this is the truth. Even a bad survivor who can't loop can waste your 30-40 seconds on god loops and you don't have any control on the situation.
---
You can have any perk tier 1. As long as you hit the level for it, it will show up as a teachable
---
Some killers can stop god loops quicker than other eg. Trapper, Nurse maybe huntress but most god loops still need to be merged somehow as they are genuinely impossible to run as killer
---
This. With no warning you get instantly hit which has no counter play. And we all know how much people complain about no counter play.
---
He's shit at it. And hopefully loads of his younger audience gets the game so there are more killers to bully on my low rank alt.
---
Wanted to adapt that Buzz Lightyear image into something more relatable.
---
the tactic of playing smart with pallet turns me off bc I will most likely lose wow it works both ways ur argument doesnt work
---
Oh no,  it like this
---
Yea but if I get it to rank 3, will the teachable be rank 3?
---
Lmao great idea, dont mind if i use it
---
Desicive strike got nerfed too.
---
Freddy is actually a really good killer since his rework, would recommend
---
Signed: Freddy main
---
Thanks, I'll definitely do that if I don't get anything.
---
ive had a doctor do this to me but facecamping me
---
i was annoyed he camped me but at the time i was fucking impressed okay
---
20 MINUTE KILLER QUEUE, NO JOKE, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS? I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME
---
I still have no idea why some of those windows still exist to this day, honestly. It doesn’t require to be a genius to see that they are broken.
---
I might be wrong here, but I think he may just have Corrupt Intervention
---
It's easier to hide behind a generator aura when you're not doing it since you and the gen are the same color. If you're on the gen iirc you're a slightly deeper shade or red/you're at an unfavorable angle and can be spotted easier. I crouch behind gens when someone's getting hooked to try and not get spotted on BBQ.
---
I'm on like 600 hours and never seen such a glitch
---
Yep! He is incredibly, but his teachables are pretty bad
---
Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time: Balanced perks.
---
NOED: "Get out of Jail free card crutch perk"
---
And if they all did objectives, killer mains scream about gen-rushing. There's no winning.
---
wait does he play killer or survivor or both
---
Tbh BT and DH aren't that bad. DS and Adrenaline can go sit on a cactus though.
---
Meh. That's where I would disagree. Everyone knows fire up is useless but remember me is pretty strong and can be the difference between everyone getting out or not, and blood warden is quote strong only in certain circumstances which means u won't get to use it every game
---
WARNING KID'S R START PLAYING DBD
---
It makes you a lot better than survivors who don’t even know what a god loop is, and get downed after 5 second chases.
---
Shit killer but still way unfun to play against.
---
Just this comment is enough
---
seems we both have had lucky hawkin escapes against ghostface
---
but urs like is way luckier lol
---
How about just let people use what they want? How does that sound? :)
---
Dude this happened to me too...I finally got the guy after downing him 3 times and managed to carry him to the basement. He hugged the far wall and right as I was about to hook he just dcd
---
Well I feel like blood warden is countered by survivors just 99% the exits, and remember me never was any useful for me, whereas other dlc killers like hag, Michael, clown, plague, even Legion have at least some good teachables
---
It won't do anything.
---
The counter to blood warden is easily stopped now killers can open the gates. Down someone open the gate and then hook them. Ok level 3 that's a whole 60 seconds you have to take out the rest of them and there's a chance the egc will kill whoever is left before the gates are unblocked
---
i fucking hate these ads now
---
i see my screen go off for an ad and im like “Ah ShIt hErE wE gO aGaIn”
---
Or when you DH, get exhausted, hit the ground and proceed to complete the DH while downed, stuttering across the floor like a tweaking Roomba.
---
It’s been around for a long time but has been made public by a youtuber and it is happening quite often now
---
Ah, I rarely used level 3 before, maybe that is the difference. I will definitely try it again
---
this post was made by Apple gang
---
PC? How is he after the nerf?
---
wheres the blood on his face from all the fAKE PALLETS I DROP ON HIM
---
Yeah definitely use level 3 only as it is, quite a lot of the time, longer than etc timer. The 30 / 45 seconds isn't enough really
---
Reported for sporting Blackface.
---
The only Survivors I can see actually being able to kill the killers are the liscensed ones, since y'know they've delt with that shit before. Especially Ash, Bill and Laurie
---
If the killers are supernaturally strong, why can't  they just destroy pallets who aren't dropped?
---
You should see the teammates I get matched with.
---
on not just listening, just actually looking with your eyes
---
even with deliverance ?? lol
---
Gen rushing isnt toxic, thinking ur good when alk u did was hold m1 all game is
---
Damn, that's a spirit play on a doc. Very confusing.
---
Shouldn't you still be able to view a killer even if you don't own the killer?
---
I guess if you mori the guy who never got hooked with devour the green Ivory wont be used as there is no way of it being used
---
You can view her in the store, yes. That cuts off her headdress.
---
Due to popular demand here are the Icons im using:

I made it to rank 1 with flip-flop in my build. Use what ever u fucking want fam
---
Ive sent the link in the comments now
---
Yeah I agree but you understand what I meant.
---
Same!
---
He used to play it forever ago, I remember seeing him in a montage of streamer clips a couple years ago involving the game, so it's not his first time at all.
---
He &amp; the majority of his audience are certainly annoying and toxic but the game is already a cesspool of toxicity. Obviously it may get a bit worse? I guess. But it's already a coin toss whether or not someone's going to be a dildo
---
and here i am trying to get WGLF after 45 levels
---
You should get PWYF stacks for teleporting to your obsession and leaving them alone after that. Once your obsession dies you get more stacks if someone stuns you thanks to Nemesis.
---
You're correct that genrushing is not toxic, but I've literally had back to back 10 second chases with little downtime before and 3 survivors were still able to escape. 
---
Gen speed is a problem, it just doesn't feel like it is because so many survivors are not optimal on gens. Lol
---
She was standing beside the stool. Slammed the hatchet into the stool with her right hand and walked off.
---
You can't select her greyed out model?
---
dont you know
---
its his new ability 
---
ultra fucker pounce
---
That just doesn't seem worth it imo. That's two perk slots for a speed boost that I won't even have half the game.
---
damn i woulda laughed if you were bubba and if you used your chainsaw you would get out and punish the teabag
---
I agree, Diz does need an award
---
There are certain maps well all know that can have these god loops... and nothing is more exciting as killer when you have one of these maps and 4 survivors who all run straight for that loop the second a chase starts. 
---
Its so exciting... /s
---
I like a good chase and don't mind a survivor who can mind game and loops well... I don't even mind a god loops sometimes.
---
Its when their only "skill" is running right to that loop that it sucks.
---
Absolutely, gens go way to fast.I bring pop, ruin and corrupt for slowdown on trapper and they still manage to have 3 gens done before first hook (rank 2 btw)
---
i mean it’ll keep ppl from dcing
---
I was playing against a toxic duo as Freddy and they both dc'd when killed one of them by moonwalking around a corner and then swinging through a pallet. Basically one of them was mad because their reaction time was shit. Lol
---
thing is are they gonna be the right players 
---
ive not watched any videos but ive heard he plays pretty toxic and with a wave of toxic 12 year olds coming into the game, its gnna make shit wack
---
I usually avoid the aggressive play, so i dont think this type of behaviour is too much of an issue, besides, its great being able to heal myself quickly without a team or medkit. Not to metion, locker healing. By the way, is it a good idea to replace empathy (96 meters) with bond(20 meters)?
---
I'm trying to make a full body image and that takes you to the in game store where you see 3/4th's of her and cuts off her headdress, and when I go to outfits the headdress is in the UI where it gets cut off.
---
Doctors LOVE this secret trick to a heart attack
---
I normally play Billy with no slowdown perks or Hag with just pop. (Rank 3 btw)
---
Disconnecting is the most toxic thing in this game.
---
you srsly tellin me to dodge the puke?
---
Its harder to find a key than to kobe, let them have the key, the luck went really nice on them
---
console. He is strong, his early game though is crucial and you cant afford to mess up otherwise the survivors will gain momentum, he is a very momentum based killer and needs to be on the constant pressure imo.
---
Trying to find the right gen in between evading Ghostface, trying to safe your team mate, and not being dead before the 4th gen was a miserable experience to say the least.  
---
At the end of it, I was so tired that when David made that offer I just jumped in despite how shitty it all felt.
---
I got to rank 1 by playing tru3 ghostface build and sweating VERY hard.The moment i try play a fun killer I just get demolished.Kinda sad how some killers are just hopeless at high ranks and sirvivor builds and playstyles directly control killer metas
---
I had one swf group who will run to the god window whenever I chase them. Next match I got the same swf group and the map was hawkins. You should see how quick the chases were.. They Disconnected after  and called it a unbalanced map, but they were okay with a god loop.
---
Or it was made by a small team on a cheap engine and every update since then are just minor changes.
---
You don't need to play with friends. You can learn how to play a lot better if you play alone but if you really want to play with friends you need to tell us which platform you're playing on because crossplay hasn't been implemented yet.
---
The dark sense challenge wasnt that hard to me. Though I let the 3 randos I was in the lobby with know what I had to do and they helped a ton! Shout out to those randoms! One stayed with me and then other 2 ran the killer around tagging out.
---
Fun fact if you are on pc and use the pregame lobby for more than afk reddit/masturbation you can set some shit up with your team! Who knew?!
---
Tbh getting a 32k means it was a long game full 3 hooks on everyone, chases etc...
---
So steamrolling early doesn't do much unless you dominated then dragged it out to get the 32k :p
---
DH is the strongest perk in the game when used correctly
---
Kind of? I still have a decent kill percentage playing Clown. Lol
---
Also, Tru3's Ghostface is good but there are definitely easier and better killers to get to rank reds with imo.
---
I'm on console though.  No comms co-ordination whatsoever.  Will likely do this if I ever have the motivation to complete the PC version.
---
I ended up having to use Bond to figure out where everyone is.  There's no point in doing that one gen when someone else is already starting another close to completion.
---
I mean, I completely agree that camping shouldn't be possible (though I'm not sure how that could be fixed) but I also feel pretty confident in guessing that the majority of killers who do it resort to it because as killer you can't win on your own merit. You win if survivors aren't good enough, which is insanely frustrating.
---
DbD is just horribly designed and maintained. Killers can basically determine how much fun a player is having or how shitty their experience is, while survivors as a unit determine if a killer can even do anything in the first place. It's pretty awfull.
---
That moment when you dead hard through a trap only to realize the Trapper doubled backed and now You're screwed.
---
No
---
I feel like it's less common, but I don't trust shirtless Davids.
---
What the fuck
---
David is also a tough guy he could probably win one or two
---
Detective's Hunch is my favorite non-meta perk. I've been playing that, Fixated, Inner Strength and Sprint Burst and it's a fun little non-meta build.
---
I play on PC. I'm from South-East Asia.
---
Wait, isn't dbd is only game that allows this because this is  the only game, where it's possible?
---
the first time I watched ninja was when he played dbd back in the day. never saw him play killer, only survivor and he made some good plays. didnt seem toxic.  
---
dunno about now
---
When I play survivor I sometimes t-bag when I’m on last hook and I’m about to get caught so the killer can feel better about killing me.
---
Play now, my lord.
---
i mean pallet stun doesn't automatically translate into being safe, you're supposed to know that if you try to drop it when killer is too close you just get hit and waste the pallet
---
No one left behind...Except for them.
---
I think I am getting downvoted because new players have no idea what I am talking about. If they deliverance Kobe it isn't a 4% the same way if a luck offering was played. 
---
I have also noticed that new players do the hook gymnastics the wrong way around.
---
Why'd you buff clown?
---
Well that's the whole point of avoiding looking at a killer - so a killer wouldn't see you in turn. So it makes sense this is rare to see :)
---
I'm not gonna comment on the face camp the whole community is more than outspoken on the matter! But how the fuck does this dude play like this? Laying sideways seems like a fast pass to a crick in your neck
---
Make your steam profile private and hack your happy ass away.
---
I’m a solo queue survivor most of the time and I use adrenaline every game because most of the time my teammates don’t help me.
---
I mean it really helps when they actually do gens, but most of the time it’s an empty perk slot.
---
That would be awesome
---
Remove/Penalize gen-tapping as well, or give gen-kicking much greater amount of regression so that it's worth spending the 3 seconds kicking it. Survivors can easily stop regression and it's kind of wack.
---
Another key difference is that wraith is invisible just saying
---
Nah but this caused me to derank.
---
Oni vs good survivors will get stomped since he is an m1 killer that can be deprived of his ability by softlooping, giving him no chance of a hit
---
You can't protect totems that 30 seconds of walking away if survivor spawns next to them.
---
It doesn't mean spawning a survivor right next to killer is okay, of course.
---
Pretty gud
---
ah yea because this community was full of rainbow and sunshine before ninja started playing
---
“Look who’s shitting in the tall grass”
---
Hell no, not the right killer to be using nemesis play with your food on
---
They just want to waste as much time as possible anyway. Make it look like silly fun, but next thing you know the gens are done or they are hopping in the hatch. 
---
If they have clearly outplayed me, I let them go, but that's rare.
---
\&gt;I got tunelled
---
I get farmed way more often then camped ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ A lot of people think that getting hooked right after unsafe unhook is tunneling, but that's not it.
---
What if they DC because theyre scared to be seperated?
---
Fuckkk
---
Can't make something more toxic when it's already at peak toxicity.
---
All of the above
---
Boy, I remember when everyone was gatekeeping people who wanted Demogorgon 'cause the Killer 'was too bestial/wasn't human enough/"HOW WOULD IT HOOK SURVIVORS"''.
---
Killer mains: "Survivor is not stressful because you're not supposed to escape, you're just supposed to waste the killer's time."
---
Also killer mains: "Killer is so stressful because I didn't get 4k one time out of my ten matches."
---
SURVIVORS ALWAYS COMPLAIN. ALWAYYYYYYYSS. THEY ARE COMPLAINING WHEN YOU ARE USING PINK AND PURPLE ADDONS. THEY ARE COMPLAINING WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING CERTAIN META KILLERS. THEY ARE COMPLAINING WHEN YOU USE MORIS. AND THEY ALSO COMPLAIN WHEN THEY JUST LOSE AND ACCUSE U OF TUNNELING AND CAMPING. F*CK OFF MATE! IM JUST PLAYING THE GAME THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYED. I DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT DS, KEYS, INSTAHEALS AND FLASHLIGHTS BC THEY ARE JUST A PART OF THE GAME!!!
---
Honestly the first killer I bought I bought because of their look, that killer was legion. So  I was a legion main before I bought Pig, Spirit, Oni and Demogorgon and now I play them( I mostly still play legion but a lot of pig too sometimes spirit and oni but I’ve kid of stopped playing demogorgon)
---
yes because you should've expected DS and just downed them without picking them up.
---
it is le smort mans. he wil outsmort u in smort contest
---
Sigh. *unzips*
---
All of the salt, all of the hatemail, oooooo fffffuuuck yessssssss &gt;:^D
---
Gen rush - ignore everything except gen
---
OoO isn’t toxic though.
---
..what?
---
Not much of a CHALLENGE if they let you have it, eh? LoL..
---
Never said anything about being toxic
---
Nobody says that
---
Trapper, Agitation, Iron Grasp, and just spam the fuck out of the house with traps + iridescent stone.  Hope that the 1 little shit who runs to the other side of the map over and over lands in one of them after you make it halfway down the stairs with them.
---
Definitely trying that out tonight!
---
HE WHAT
---
I get a chub with every angry letter I get
---
Oh thats so mean and i love it so much
---
I'd rather have the usual events than the rift. They're grinding already enough money with cosmetics.
---
As A Doctor Main: This Makes me Happy
---
All Ultra-rare charms have animations
---
just letting you know that he plays like a rank 15 survivor
---
There are more problems with challenges, people take them like main goal instead of challenge during game, which makes game sometimes unplayable.
---
I still think that survivors challenges are pretty challenging, but killer challenges makes you play dirty and without fun, i get it, its hard to came up with good killer challenge, but after releasing new chapter, there's no point in play cuz you only find tunneling camper for archives. Its not entirely killers fault, but i hate it. 
---
My opinion guys, please dont make me DbD
---
Why is it in the picture then ?
---
Bruh, you do what you want as long as its not bannable, theres no rule that you have to give the killer their challenges, just ignore their stupid asses when they cry because you escaped
---
Seems like alot of survivors do this
---
I’m looking forward to what else they come up with.
---
People should realise that Freddy's weapon hitbox is the same as other killers so it may not visually connect, but if they were Trapper for example, it would have visually connected
---
I appreciate it
---
It doesn't matter what killer that's just awful hitboxes
---
I'm not talking about the mechanics here, I'm talking about the intended reason for Decisive.
---
I use Auto-Didact, and by the time I get to 4/5 stacks, the game decides "Nah, no more healing skill checks for 90% of the heal now"
---
If they buffed some of the lesser used perks, we'd see more variety.
---
Nah, fortnites dead. His ego just can’t handle not being the best
---
Tunneling is killers version of gen rush. Change my mind.
---
This is cool! Good job :)
---
Exhaustion perks specifically have always been so fucked. I don’t bother running borrowed because it almost never works anymore now either sadly. And the. Add the new oblivious effect and...
---
&lt;3
---
I see people already arguing as to what "tunneling" is, but I think it's pretty safe to assume op meant it in the way when the killer literally ignores every other survivor and gens until they get one particular survivor dead. Call it a strategy, but you're forgetting the survivor is also a person playing the game, and they deserve a fair chance. Maybe they brought a super rare item they wanna try out, maybe they put in the offering for points, and they're gonna end up camped with 5 k total. 
---
We all could use more empathy towards survivors and killers. I play both, and as the killer I know I had to learn to not be angry at survivors. Every game you're gonna get this cheeky bastard who's gonna loop you and teabag you. It's still just a game, and it's your lobby - what you choose to play affects other people. I practice my chases so I can defeat them, but after their second hook I let them go. And they often turn out to be sweet hearts in the post game chat, normal people. Or I kill them, and they still say gg, because I played fair. 
---
It's most probable they were tilted after their last game, when they got treated unfairly, and wanted to take it out on me. If you're not the one to break this cycle of toxicity, it's just gonna continue, and hurt us all. No deep truth there, just a fact.
---
BuT buTt tHey neEd tO MaKE mONey by rEleAsinG moRe dLC anD eXpeNSivE OuTFiTs!
---
Oblivious cancels borrowed time right? I had it happen to me with a freddy game and I just figured it bugged. Do you know if it's unintentional or intentional that oblivious cancels borrowed time?
---
Solo queue survivor is already a pain in the ass so I’ll definetely use meta perks. As killer, I don’t really care but if you really want to win, you have no choice but to use a strong build if the survivors know what they’re doing. I’ll stick to my good load-outs.
---
It’s not that I expect them to be good. It’s that they’re trying out the “toxic survivor” despite not having TV e skill to pull it off. I think the toxic survivor mentality is stupid anyway considering the killer is just trying to play the game but when you join a game and then immediately try and be cocky thats just a bit stupid in my opinion, especially if you’re screwing over your own team mates.
---
I've said it before, but the enjoyment of the game for all 5 players is directly proportionate to how the killer plays. Of course, there's times where you get put against toxic SWFS, and survivors can be scummy too, but if the killer wants to play like a dick, NOBODY will have fun.
---
The killer is the power role, and without them, all the survivors can do is play m1 simulator.
---
Unfortunately, most people see the game as competitive (when it really isn't) so don't take the other player's enjoyment into account , but if both sides see the other 4 players as allies for an enjoyable game, games are MUCH more fun.
---
This goes for survivors being dicks to other survivors, but because they can't really directly impact their teammates whilst still playing for the objective, their dickish behaviour isn't so apparent. That's why the killer is still "in control".
---
Think of Dnd. If there s a player who's a dick, it ruins the game but it can still go on. If the DM is a dick, nobody is going to have fun. Maybe the DM will, but they'll piss off everyone else.
---
Likewise, if all 4 players want to gang up on the DM, the DMs also not going to have a good time.
---
Just, be nice to each other goddammit. It's not hard!
---
Hook tech is toxic now is it? They obiously just saw some yt vid and wanted to try it out, they are new players just let them learn on their own
---
Had a game like this with a face camping bubba. I was in a full SWF team. The first person who got hooked was saved and then instantly downed and re hooked. They didn’t struggle. The second person was about to get saved because bubba actually left the hook but killed them self before I got to them (they still had half of struggle left). I got downed after that because one teammate used all of the pallets on half of the map. He slugged me and tried to get the last person who was too busy sneaking around the map with urban evasion instead of doing gens.
---
One teammate said it wasn’t fun for anyone in endgame chat and killer said it’s not his fault that we were too dumb to do gens. I did 4 gens solo and the person who was too busy using urban evasion as much as possible did nothing all game.
---
Survivor main but damn that's smart af!
---
I am the missing 4th person they Tbagged on the hook and proceeded to do gens.
---
I run spine chill with this is not happening, no mither and bond is good with it too, basically great skillcheck build
---
It's a bit shit that we get punished for over performing... BP wise.
---
If I am dominating so quickly I have to slow down or it's a 15k game lol
---
I don't know why people downvoted me. The problem with god loops is that you have no control on that situation as a killer. You can vault the same window 3 times as a survivor and you can waste killer's time hugely with 0 mindgames. There are no gameplay and skill there. You can be a decent survivor or a very average survivor. They both can run that loop pretty much the same.
---
The Clown is sorta John Wayne Gacy mixed with Dahmer. Hillbilly is a horrifying version of Ed Gein. We sorta have this already.
---
I stopped running spine chill a while back. Its purpose for stealth killer but I would always end up running face first into them and getting clotheslined. Its a great perk when you're newer to the game but once you start getting a natural sixth sense for where and when a killer should be showing up it just becomes a wasted slot. 
---
Then again, I sort of feel the same with Decisive Strike. I've gotten to the point where I'm good enough at looping a killer to where tunneling isn't an issue assuming I'm not getting farmed by a teammate. Tunneling still happens, but like spine chill, I just dont get enough use out of it to justify religiously taking a slot away for it.
---
Then you took away that challenging part Away, i mean like different things, somethink like. "All chases in next trial are shorter then minute" -makes killer try to chase or sneak on you and then move on another survivor oř leave you if you are good at loops. "Change state of a survivor by your power 10times", "Complete trial without any chest be searched", "kill all survivors in less than X minutes" 
---
I dont play killer much, but in my opinion these challenges dont make you camp or tunnel.
---
“small”
---
I like mint rag better because you can literally be anywhere at any time and shackles because they have no idea when they trigger a trap. But there is some real synergy between those addons.
---
If someone farms their teammate I’ll always go for the person who unhooked them.
---
Is this what has caused an influx of clueless players with no sportsmanship or skill attempting to power level right now? Oh lawd.
---
No way you only go up against SWF. Must be a tru3ta1lent viewer
---
It’s definitely both. “Oh Wu” or sometimes as “Ooh Wuu”
---
I took it off mute and instantly regretted it.
---
I dont understand how he killed fortnite though? This isnt me trying to defend ninja btw. I've fucking always hated the way he just thinks loud = funny and just how he can be when someone disagrees with him. But how did he kill fortnite/is a bad influencer?
---
THERE USED TO BE TWO WINDOWS IN THE SHACK??
---
It should be SyLoK, ThE dEfIlEd
---
And the Doc’s rework is on the way too. Someone is gonna make this legit.
---
I made it to rank 1 without perks, it’s just way too easy to rank up. Glad I can go back to SB/IW/Res/BT
---
This is exactly how I think about it too. As killer I'm trying to facilitate a fun game - That's it.
---
Yeah when it involves farming your team mate. They did it once, saw the outcome  and then proceeded to do the same thing again. That in combination with going out of their way to body block pallet so they could stun the killer instead, or perhaps intentionally get me killed, who knows?) I could tell from how they’d been playing up until that point that they likely watched a few Ochido videos and decided they were a God at the game.
---
Imagine Ghostface except it's actually a billy.
---
The Nemesis + PWYF combo works really well on killers who have to chase survivors normally and who tend to get stunned by pallets. It works especially well with killers who have an insta-down ability like Bubba or Plague. 
---
Sadly the Hag has alot against her for the synergy between PWYF/Nemesis;
---
- She is 110% movement speed meaning she gains less of a benefit for using PWYF since she loses out in the extra 5% movement the other killers have.
---
- Hag spends most her time prepping traps and hitting survivors who activate traps as opposed to chasing survivors normally. Time spent chasing survivors is usually small if the player is a good Hag.
---
- The chances of you being stunned by a pallet are reduced since you will be moving through your traps as opposed to chasing survivors normally. 
---
-  You will usually not need the extra movement speed as most of the damage you will be doing will be through hitting survivors who have set your Hag traps off. 
---
- Since Hag does not have a insta-down ability, you will likely lose tokens faster than you will ever gain them with Hag meaning PWYF will barely ever come into use.
---
- Survivors tend to heal against Hag to provide some protection against the traps. This means that you will tend to lose 2 tokens for every survivor you down since they will usually be in the healthy state.
---
You're just not the target audience, those streamers are funny as hell to the 14 and under crowd.
---
For me that stupid thing is yo take a hit/down myself for saving one of SWF  because they never return the favor
---
“pig” video and didn’t like what I “saw”
---
I see what you did there
---
Those have always been there. Surely we're not trying to pretend DBD was ever not toxic?
---
This
---
smol*
---
ochido was already a pain in the ass for us to ban (and only on pc). But it looks like he was only the beginning
---
I've been cucked 18 times. I've started writing down survivors names who do this so I can facecamp/mori them in future games.
---
Ninja as surv inc...
---
Even b4 times, I have been robbed of dailies just because of dcs.
---
They should drop the whole "select challenge" thing and make them passive so that you don't have to farm for specific one and they would just complete as you go.
---
This community is a conflicted lot
---
😂
---
Patch Notes: Also changed the name of BBQ &amp; Chili to BBQ and FUCK YOU.
---
So i should just not run them and go down instead?
---
Fortnite isn't dead, and let's not sit here and pretend DBD isn't already one of the most toxic games on the market. This community can't possibly get worse, Ninja or no Ninja
---
The higher up you go in rank, the less flexible your builds can become. There's a little bit of wiggle room on both sides when you're at high ranks, but 'experimentation' only exists at higher ranks if you want to be a liability for your teammates or love to watch Survivors teabag at the exit gates after genrushing you into the dirt. Most perks are just completely worthless, and everything that isn't meta is too niche/situational and if you run them, you only run them for the memes. If this bothers you, talk to BHVR about it. They're the guys too scared to buff perks that're notably weak/unused/underutilized.
---
Damn, i remember when i hd a list of people i was gonna mori, i threw the list away when they made name changing a thing on ps4
---
They need to redo the entire emblem system for killers. Gatekeeper needs to not be a thing and Malicious needs to be reworked to accommodate killers who one shot with M1 and M2, and killers like Legion and Plague need to get a bonus over time for how long survivors stay injured/broken. Devout also need to count how many hook stages are passed too because raw hook events lets survivors just hook suicide.
---
You did it too early. It’s all about getting the right timing
---
Spasmodic + Ataxic makes Nurse my favorite killer.
---
Let them learn the game for themselves, nothing else you can do as new players will always be trash, also perhaps try running ds if youre gonna be playing with low ranks
---
Or an oni... I’m already scared lol 🤣
---
500 IQ
---
Yes, wait 4 minutes so you bleed out, is this a serious question?
---
I mean it’s not like survivor mains and killer mains weren’t already emulating the behaviors of other popular streamers who are well known for their less than sportsmanlike behavior. 
---
Also you are capable of ignoring someone.
---
Idk why people are downvoting you, you're right. 😂
---
You can pick up and drop survivors repeatedly, stopping the bleedout.
---
I tried doing that but I get the worst groups of survivors. They tell me to just get good or play the game normally. I get it farming can be boring but
---
 Sometimes people just need help.
---
I'm at the exact same spot.  Completed all my challenges and hit level 50.  I'm now at 52, but it feels like it's gonna be a grind.  I really don't want to buy more levels or play 18 games a day, so I may call it quits.
---
Bleedout? Not much else you can do. You could record and report it but im doubtful it will do anything
---
vibe check
---
Have you ever played dbd? You get off the killer shoulder when he drops you for the 4th time, lr if he has you on his shoulder for too long
---
Bro this game is +18. Not too much 10 yrs old here. Go play something else
---
It wont sincr making someone bleed out OBVIOUSLY isnt bannable
---
We have monto
---
What a very small world, your welcome.
---
NOED is the same as DS, its annoying to play against sometimes. But more often than not, you can play around it
---
If he actually did that and asked BHVR to fix the Ghostface’s buggy stalking I would riot
---
\*Hums in sadness\*
---
Its 2 perks ike spirit fury/enduring. Assuming like any high rank killer they run bbq and ruin on top of that its there whole build. As such dont stun the killer i guess like enduring/spirit fury
---
Other survivors are irrelevant and frankly if your solo queue i wouldnt expect to escape most games anyway.
---
I fucking love American Psycho. One of my favorite movies of all time
---
Ah Bubba got the N-word pass as I see
---
Id honestly forget this challenge its way to circumstantial
---
NO! NO! NO! i refuse to belive this works!! NO!
---
You two must be friends yeah? Pug just commented too. Oceania I guess is a very small place after all.
---
SUICIDE IS BADASS
---
If they are constantly picking you up and dropping you they are kinda holding the game hostage, they are dragging the game out massivly. Though i agree it wouldnt do anything probably
---
Isn't it lovely how RNG can do so much for a survivor?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/egayjz/does_anyone_know_whether_bhvr_is_going_to_do_a/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
True, I got lucky the first group sent me a party chat, I helped them with there stuff and then they let me get it
---
It's technically not holding the game hostage by the devs standards as the game will still end eventually, it just will take obnoxiously long.
---
Sucks when you sacrifice everyone in the basement but the challenge was not selected.
---
It doesnt drag out shit, you get of the killers back and run away and loop them
---
I HATE THAT I MISSED THIS ON WEDNESDAY!!!
---
ALSO I REALLY HATE IT WHEN YOUR A CASUAL GAMER AND PLAY WHEN YOU CAN BUT LOOOVVVVEE THIS GAME AND YOU GET HATE MAIL BECAUSE YOU DON’T KNOW EVERYTHING!!!! STFU!! IM TRYING TO LEARN EVERYTHING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!!!! FUCK!!!!!! 
---
That is all.

I didn't say anything like you shouldn't use it. All I said was abusing god loops doesn't make you a good survivor because it's a broken thing and killer has pretty much nothing to do about it.( of course nurse or traps doesn't included because we are talking about a situation which %90 of the killers has no options).
---
Grey ranks dont even know what they are doing, also if your solo queue run DS. Just be grateful you even get saved in solo queue
---
He's talking about reporting someone for holding a game hostage which is a bannable offense.
---
Great I got to this challenges last night lol wish me luck
---
Shes 110, shes not meant to chase at all
---
oh man, that's brutal.
---
It'd such a welcoming suprise if they added a game mode besides the default that crammed and shit tone of survivors and killers into a map 4x times the size and just let people go crazy. I wouldn't care if it's unbalanced either. The chaos would be rewarding enough.
---
It's good for the player count to have big influencers playing. Unfortunately the sort of people ninja will bring will be mostly annoying kids
---
Yes, crush those children.
---
The sad part is is that he is the biggest content creator in the world right now even though hes a piece of human garbage she doesn't deserve it he has more influence than anybody and that's the kind of power  That game developers especially the ones on the level of behavior will bend the knee too  Just to keep those people playing and their influence in the game...
---
I've been pewdiepie because he kind of started that craze...
---
This is wholesome, also why do you have 30 unspent vials?
---
And of course its on console , seems they are all brainless
---
What’s wrong with fixing a bug
---
He’s running (clockwise from top)
---
 kindred (lets survivors see each other while on hook and killer if he’s under 16m of you)
---
 Unbreakable (recover faster and lets you fully recover once in a game)
---
 spine chill (actions going a tidbit faster when killer looking at you from 32m or less)
---
 Left behind (shows hatch when it’s under 32m of you iirc)
---
There would be no point in running unbreakable if this existed, also it would break the game as killers are a lot of the times forced to slug in certain situations if they want to win. The nerf existence of the new No Mither would mean that you basically cannot slug at all no matter if the survivor actually has No Mither or not. I actually think No Mither is exactly where it needs to be. The only change I would make was give it Iron Will's where the sounds of grunts is reduced by %100.
---
He’s running Unbreakable, Spine Chill, Kindred and left behind. Do you want me to explain then?
---
They’re most likely trying to farm. The best you can do is farm with them as once they complete their objective, they’ll either end the game or allow you to farm them for points
---
I have been saying it since he 1st started getting big since fortnight's 1st took off he is a piece of human garbage he doesn't deserve his fame and if he died tomorrow I would clap and cheer.  In fact if I could get away with it I would Mori him myself
---
Yeah pug and I swf. I was browsing the subreddit while waiting for the next game and saw the post. :)
---
Now there's only a handful of killers that play for fun, which is sad really.
---
Just think of the ones that camp/tunnel have small pp and move on, not much can be done about it.
---
However there are also red ranks where you get the worst of the worst from both sides, so if you want to have fun it's better to avoid em.
---
It’s at a weird level of popularity. It’s pretty well known among horror fans but outside of that pretty much nobody knows it.
---
The sad part is a massive influence are like him with a massive following game devs like behavior bend the knee to them just because of the attention they bring to the game so I fully expect dead by daylight to get ruined if he continues to play it
---
Why not send the same message to survivors?
---
Pretty big nerf to Dwight, damn...
---
Off topic but once my dog consumed my wallet and keys.
---
I dont know how you managed to jump through that window without being hit, whenever I'm being chased by the killer and jump through a window my hitbox becomes  the size of a blue whale and I get hit like 5 ft from the other side of the window
---
Tbh, I do not understand the devs decision of showing the other side that you are using a "secret" offering.
---
I destroyed it. Im sorry
---
Atleast my Devour is sti- ***BOOM***
---
No mither already lets you recover from dying state man...
---
I cannot even see it.
---
Did you get them back?
---
Insidious meta on doctor confirmed
---
People run alert?
---
This actually bothers people? 
---
If I'm getting stomped as a survivor and the killer is letting people back up for a second chance, hey more BP even if I don't survive! I'll take a safety pip for a few more minutes thanks
---
I don’t think being dead matters because Amanda, Lisa, Adam, and Rin all died.
---
If he hooks you after downing you and then caring yo exit gate and letting you open it then it probably was me
---
I approve that part where you start healthy, that helps you a lot. Hiding status effect is not okay, i mean its such a big advantage.
---
r/TwoRedditorsOneCup/
---
Believe me I was so confused because I really should have with the game works these days.
---
Some killers are massive or just too tall to jump. Like imagine Plague spreading her legs and try to jump over pallets. Ass a high priestess, showing your genitals to people is not acceptable.
---
Now by 'he' do you mean Bill as a character or me as the player? Cause I'm a lassie, haha.
---
Force of habit didn’t mean much by it sorry :p
---
It's not because hes a famous influencer, its because it's fucking ninja a piece of human garbage and egotistical man child who cries he gets stream sniped over time to get played on children's game because hes not even actually good at himself.  This is a man who quite literally threatened to have someone band live on stream when they outplayed him accusing them of stream sniping him and then when they didn't leave the game at his request proceeded to take up his phone and get ready to make the phone call then at the last 2nd realized that his camera was on and put it back down pretending that he was answering a text continuing to make the threats.  The very next day when the controversy started the guy that used playing against who was also live streaming the game prove that he wasn't stream sniping and you know what ninja did he doubled down the only reason it didn't cause a bigger stores because epic games did the smart thing and just let it fester and burn itself out they didn't listen to ninja they didn't stand up to ninja they just ignored the situation.
---
 Ninja is a piece of human garbage he doesn't deserve his fame he didn't on his fame he got it my playing one garbage excuse of a game that is loved by kids he jumped on the bandwagon early enough and it made him rich and famous now he has his head stuck so far up his ass that he thinks just because hes an influencer he should be allowed to cheat *See faze Jarvis controversy*.  All he does is scream and cry like a 10 year old.  Nobody wants him involved in this game because he will only make the worst of this community even worse than they already are
---
No he isn’t.
---
Yah his a sweet boy. The keys were in his mouth and were fucked so had to get new ones but luckily I made him throw up the wallet and only The wallet itself was damaged, nothing inside.
---
Survivor will almost always complain unless you let all of them escape. 
---
tUnNelEr: yes, I tunneled one of you. You are a 4 men team, what do you want me to do? Ignore him so I get genrushed and the match lasts 2 minutes? Nope. 
---
CaMpER: no, chasing you around the hook because 3 of you came to save your friend is not camping. What am I supposed to do? Pretending I didn't see you and go away?
---
Unfortunately despite the losses hes accumulated he is still the largest streamer on the face of the Earth right now...  A lot of people are actually moving to next or not because of him but because twitch has just become a cesspool of E thots controlled by "just chatting".
---
I honestly don't want the fast window vault sound to be changed. It's just so satisfying.

This is genius. Imagine basement camping with this
---
The difference is that ninja is significantly bigger than him has a lot more influence and companies love to bend the me to egotistical man children like him so it's likely he will do the exact same things and get away with it
---
''Hybrid-fortnite demons'' 
---
The best ne for some fortnite playerd
---
Respectfully disagree on next to impossible comment. But tweeks happened afterwards. Just hoping that won't happen with ninja and his wife in the mix.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much ninja doesn't even have any skill with the one game that made him famous I highly doubt he would be able to handle a much more advanced game
---
Just spent them on the Clown outfit, I completely forgot, thank you!
---
It seems they listen a lot to the big dead by daylight youtubers and this subreddit
---
Bamboozle
---
Steam charts say nothing about any surge of players yet
---
No need to freak out yet
---
And who cares of who he is and he does? To me, he only generates entertainment for his audience, he isnt more than a number. He won't change anything about the community.
---
That's nice, but I bet the things inside the wallet smelled bad after lmao
---
I know right? I'm rank 3 survivor and I suck.
---
Fucking hell lmao
---
Oh no don't be daft! That makes sense! Especially cause I am playing as Bill.
---
Most of my post game chat is silence. 80% of my games no one says anything after it ends.
---
Maybe because I'm a new player and lower ranks are full of new people?
---
I have the opposite situation because i mainly play kate as a lad XD
---
Yep. 9 years old will get instantly bored of the wait times between rank 20 and rank 13. There's no way kids used to Fortnite would want to wait 15 minutes for every match till rank 13.
---
So they'll play a few matches as survivors and when they'll get slaughtered every single file match they'll give up.
---
Nah, lets let him join.  When we Stream Snipe him and he'll want to report us, the Devs will be like, "WHO GIVES A FUCK!!"
---
That's fine I mean some of the they changed I didn't even think needed changes some of them they even changed after I already had them done.  But there is a few that were so tedious and ridiculously hard that you basically had to get the other people to help.  There's more than a few  Challenges I will openly admit I only got done because the killer let me do it or the survivors helped me do it as a farming match.
---
 Unfortunately I fully expected to because ninja is a massive influence or as much as he is a no talent prick who isn't even good at the one game he plays he has a massive following and game devs especially of the Double-A variety like behavior bend the knee to people like that and often make the mistake of forsaking their own game and already established community for the outside influence of someone who has no idea what they're talking about just because of their size and influence over others
---
Have YOU ever been to high ranks or are you naieve? There are killers at red ranks that will do anything for the 4k, including prolonging the game for many minutes.
---
First they slug the last survivor. If they still haven't found the other survivor they pick the slugged survivor up and either keep carrying them around and downing them when they wiggle off, or set off to hook the other survivor whilst keeping a close eye on what the other survivor is doing.
---
My friend was in a game for an extra 20ish mins yesterday because the spirit just HAD to get the 4k and wouldn't settle for anything less.
---
Sure, just in this scenerio it was what it is.
---
I had the same reaction when Billy was going to kill me, but I made the baby dweet eyes and he let me farm the pallets
---
Detectives hunch is low key amazing tho
---
Well he’s not getting that many views from the looks of it. His videos have dropped from his usual millions to 400k-3k. So hopefully he’s not giving it that much attention
---
Nah the fanbase is already toxic as it is so he isn't gonna change that
---
As much as I agree that a 4k should be a "win", I do get the 'entity displeased' when a game ends too quickly.
---
From a lore perspective, the entity feeds off emotions, hope in particular. The longer a survivor is tortured and the trial goes on, the more food the entity receives. Therefore a game ending in 5 minutes is a disappointment to the entity.
---
Well that's my thought 😊
---
Fucking hell yes. 
---
 I have watched him play he is and even half decent at fortnight a kids game that just about anyone can pick up and be good act I could pick it up note now for the 1st time since it released and within a few hours be just as good if not better than him it's not a hard game to play I have played it.
---
 He is an egotistical manchild who doesn't deserve his fame and that is an absolute fact
---
And then he chases you and downs you again. I've had this happen before as the last survivor, it's an absolutely miserable experience. It went on for at least as long as the actual trial itself.
---
Things are bad enough as it is.Can u imagine.how bad it will be.Itll be like 2016 all over again
---
When are they gonna add a survivor who can kick away people trying to unhook them?
---
Buy laurie, she starts with ds, also what the fuck do you expect this post to accomplish? To somehow make all the rank 20s stop trying to learn stuff they see on youtube?
---
Hah, it was actually more the lobby after the game. But I can see how that can be scary :X
---
Yeah everyone is over here crying that a bunch of toxic 12 year old crybabys are joining the game and I'm like, so I get to crush "toxic 4mans" who think I'm a hacker cuz i have bbq? Why would i be worried? What are they gonna teabag me after dropping that pallet they camped? It wont last very long lol
---
I wish I could agree with you but that's simply not the case.  As much as he should be a nobody he is unfortunately due to pure blind luck alone the most influential content greater on the face of the Earth when he says jump most developers will ask how high especially a Double-A developer like behavior this game's community isn't small by any means but it's not so massive that they can afford to ignore him and they will most likely bend the new to him and his fan base just to get the numbers up.
---
Good.  Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll continue to play it anyway and then he'll drop off the face of the Earth and become the obscure nobody he should have remained before he got lucky and fortnight made him famous.
---
Heres to hoping.
---
 Shirtless david is always cocky and toxic but will dc immediately when they can't rely on their crutch dead hard because they got hit with an exhaustion hatchet and go down in 10 seconds.
---
Lol nah it’s thick so it was all good.
---
Let’s pray to the entity
---
Ninja needs to do so much more to even come close to *that* disease.
---
You will get fucked up if you play anything but meta at ranks above 12. Content creators are anecdotal evidence you never know how many games they went through to show off that funny head on build.
---
Yeah, many 11-years old little kids who act toxic because he does. No thanks
---
You guy are fucking nuts. We should be happy someone as Ninja is playing DBD, it means the game is popular and will not die anytime soon. Also, more money = awsome licenced killers and ppl working
---
AND its a part of the game, i dont mind killer slugging me, its only 4 minutes, if they drop me i get hatch,  if they drop me 4 times i get off their back for free and go find hatch, if they have alresdy closed hatch i just wait those 4 minutes for endgame to kill me, you really have NO idea what you are talking about as its super obvious  youre a new player thats BARELY IF AT ALL touched killer, jesus h christ youre ignorant
---
\*cries in Dead Hard that I have completely stopped using for months\*
---
Better let's all burn an ebony Mori and just go get the job done.  I doubt the entity ven wants to eat that piece of garbage probably get sick with how much toxic chemicals are in his hair
---
Its okay.
---
By seeing where the killer has broken pallets, you know where not to run as a survivor so that you can run the killer longer.
---
Additionally you will see what killer it is at the start of the match should they chase someone else to start
---
By seeing where the killer kicks gens you see a bit into their patrolling habits which helps you make plays especially in 3 gen scenarios
---
I play on Xbox so doubt I’ll be seeing him any time soon and usually stay at ranks 9-6. But god the day I counter one of his fans
---
What the actuall hell are you on about? Just wiggle off his back, go get in hatch or if the hatch is closed theres this thing called looping i know its a hard concent to grasp but just run around a pallet for 2 minutes and you will die to endgame , even if he downs you just crawl for hatch it only takes 4 minutes to bleed out
---
Rip. Just completed a 5 gen without this challenge or the perk.
---
Absolute meta perk
---
I get 2 type of survivors while playing killer.
---
1. The guy that runs me for 4 gens and complains about getting tunnelled and won't stop swearing at me.
---
2. The guy who has less than 300 hourd ingame and does the objective while thr other guys do... dunno...something... I still dunno how they can lose so much time looking for my NOED
---
Bonus (the ones I encounter VERY rare)
---
3. The noob
---
4. The friendly guys that want to farm bloodpoints (killers and survivors too)
---
ngl I kinda want someone just to kind of bully him in a game. Just idk play ghostface, teabag the fuck outta him, tunnel him, nod at him, etc.
---
cant wait to see his 360 montages /s
---
To be fair..... is it?
---
Can you really love dead by daylight without hating it? It is my favourite game, but god I hate it
---
Except they do concentrate on fixing the bugs. That is why they didn't do a winter event this year so they could concentrate on fixing the game.
---
I’m not naive, I’m talking about when I’ve stunned the killer, fully dropped the pallet and still get hit.
---
I'm in it for the 4 charms/idols "things" you get hy completing each tier, but getting 3 different botanist charms that only differentiate on color is admittedly disappointing.
---
Ochido i assume?
---
Counterpoint
---
1) consumables are not really heavily required by survivors. Occasional med kit/toolbox/keys...all of which can be used again and again unlike killer add-ons. Therefore killer getting more BP is necessary for killer to even compete.
---
Also as a survivor I gain 20k ish BP. Sure it's not 32k + BBQ, but it's more than enough as I don't really need add-on/offering as a survivor
---
2) you are right pips don't matter. But nonetheless there is a significantly higher chance that you are better at red rank compared to green. This kind of matchmaking shouldn't be happening at all.
---
One rank difference is one thing but rank 11? That's a borderline yellow. Needless to say, this guy even tried proxy camping with Myers. It didn't go well for him
---
I’m sure his wife’s an alright person but fuck her for getting him into the game.

He is just bad honestly.
---
I was playing with my friend and 2 randoms the other day and one of the other survivors created a text message group with me and the killer. It was a Laurie and she asked if she could get the 4 gen Dark Sense challenge done and the killer just said "Do It". The killer had even brought in a pink mori with some decent wraith addons and allowed her to finish. 
---
Before the last gen was done I asked if I could get a end game save and he let me do that as well. We both let him kill us at the end. Just keep trying to ask, you will get somebody to help I'm sure!
---
Insidious makes you completely silent, no terror radius when standing still
---
More through then i would have put it. Here is to hoping it wont happen. What to do if it does? Plots plans anyone? Lol
---
I have been in all situation as ive played since ps4 release, there is no problem with killers slugging to drag the game out
---
January 7th.
---
Do not speak it's name
---
No, seriously it seems you're naieve. 1) I'm talking about a situation where there's 2 survivors left in the trial. 2) EGC is not activated in this situation. 3) Hatch is not open. 4) You can't JUST wait 4 mins to die as I explained in my previous comment. 
---
Btw I have over 3k hours and got rank 1 killer and survivor in 2016, seeing as though we're talking about who's 'new'. When did you start playing?
---
Im new to dbd whats black incents
---
EXCUSE YOU LITTLE MISTER GHOSTFACE THIS IS A GODDAMN FAMILY PHOTO AND WE WILL ALL BE IN IT AND SMILE! Those who fight it go first though. Those who participate willingly go last. Thems how I do.
---
Same
---
Judgeing from gameplays ive seen, i would rather not play in 25 fps
---
*whomst has summoned the almighty one*
---
Make one yourself with better music then? EZ
---
Yea man times ticking. I’m at like lvl 43-44 and my dumbass bought the pass waaaay to late so i’m stuck trying my hardest every game lmfao. I finished all my survivor tome challenges but now i have the killer ones left to do :(
---
I had a game on elementary where a survivor kept trying to loop me through the school. I chased it because I wanted to see how long it would take. I can’t remember if I killed anyone that match but after the game that survivor kept calling himself a god at looping. When I laughed he told me to go watch his VOD. I just laughed more.
---
It says right on the tome "ends in X days"
---
I'm aware of how the game runs, but my question is if there's an active player base.
---
NOOOO! Quick, software ban the foul demon!
---
This is why we always stay till they reach second stage
---
It’s once upon a THICC Jane
---
Killing Fortnite?  He was a major factor in Fortnites early success.  
---
Anyone thinking Ninja brining viewers to DBD is bad, is clueless.  DBDs community has been a toxic cesspool since it’s inception.
---
I second this. Can barely stand two or three games of it before quitting. I've gone back to playing Friday the 13th since it has single player and Last Year for multiplayer since i love its characters and maps way more
---
Oh, that i cannot answer i am afraid
---
I'd also like to add oversexualization of the characters or perversion in general. It's not funny...it's cringy and stupid
---
I play dbd very on and off but legion has always been my favourite go-to killer even after the nerfs. And I'm doing pretty well at around rank 8 at the moment. Running thanatophobia and discordance feels extremely effective at slowing gen progression.
---
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.
---
You run to escape that okay my lad. It those who DC when I'm carrying them down that are fucking CUNTS.
---
Where's Aang?
---
I mean you want my attention you got it buddy, if you can’t hang during a chase then get better. Sorry you ran your mouth more than you could run lol.
---
If I was currently on the game, I wouldn't be asking this question. 
---
[Here's a gift for you!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENdG0NcCWdg)
---
What if I want to be a big angry guy who makes global horny dog noises.
---
Thanks!
---
Give it time, trust me
---
Then the other survivor just 99% gens while those 4 mins pass, snd if they get enough gens 99 they start popping them, its a pretty awesome solution, ps i started on console release, no idea about playtime but id say on average 3 hours everyday maybe? :)
---
Stridor is actually really annoying for killer at least in my opinion. On spirit it makes them sound way closer so you misjudge where they are
---
Not me, but my friends love it. Then again they are not red ranks. You see the killer a lot and i mean a lot with alert, so they dont feel like they have to be on “ alert “ all the time. I find it pretty reasonable. 
---
There are many say it is too situational, but then i see a perk like adrenaline favored by many, which i believe is one of the most situational perks around :)
---
You clearly lack the stomach for this level of puns
---
No problem!
---
Yeah i guess it’s not a bad perk but there are many that are better
---
Why would you get banned for that?
---
I've noticed (very very rarely) someone using OoO carefully, I get a flicker of their location and then nothing; sometimes it makes me go over there and chase them off the generator, but *usually* it's when they're moving around the map trying to get somewhere else, so for the most part you just pressure generators like normal (even if they are in a SWF, though SWF tend to be more cocky and blatant about it).
---
Of course if I catch them out and get them on a hook, I am probably more likely to tunnel them - because the perk allows them to avoid me so much better, *their one hook tends to take longer than someone else's three hooks* (unless they're really bad at pallets/loops) so even if you tunnel &amp; slug them, they still got to play a lot of the game.
---
No tunneling is when they go after whoever just stepped off the hook, this person is saying they used bbq and chilli which will only activate and show them the person off the hook if they hook someone else first so technically it's not because they had to go after someone else in order to see that person's aura.
---
Then wait till you are on the game xD, and go watch that video for yourself it seems to fit you 😉😉
---
Because it gives you vertical res
---
I couldn't find a png of him to add when I needed it the most :(
---
Well yeah but at least Nord is more honest and upfront about their business model. “Pay 7.99$ a month for VPN services and greater privacy” is a lot better than “it’s FREEEEEEEEEE*”
---
*core gameplay elements restricted to premium users.
---
Nobody gets banned for anything. Reporting system doesn’t actually work.
---
I do not believe you can get banned for it since you are just changing the resolution as opposed to adding something to the game files.
---
*youtubes in miniladd*
---
Lasts for 8 seconds and some god loops take almost 8 seconds to loop especially if they have a safe pallet in the loop. You only need to chase someone around those loops twice to potentially lose 1-2 generators and a survivor can still get 1 time waste loop even if you use bamboozle.
---
Also taking a single perk for maybe the possibility that you’ll have the bad RNG to go to maps with those loops and that you’ll have the bad RNG that the god windows/structures spawn is basically rolling the dice and praying that you didn’t just waste the perk.
---
So, if someone asks a question, they're stupid?
---
Yeah they would camp somewhere unseen and then immediately come up to the hook while someone was unhooking and go around and completely ignore the unhooker in their face and go straight for the one that was hooked giving them no chance at all :/
---
Thanks for the help guys
---
That'd make up for the base speed a little too much by allowing you to come from two angles and cut off every survivors escape.
---
a lot of new "9yr old" players, making queues shorter, yet being easy to bully, im in
---
You want to kill a man for being half good at a game..?
---
So what?
---
Free weekends are kind of random for this game. The devs might announce a planned free weekend in the offical dbd forums but other than that I do not believe there is a way to predict free weekends.
---
That is what heros do
---
I don't watch him as much as the others, so I wouldn't know. His educational videos are worth learning from if that's all OP wants, though.
---
Apparantly you think im stupid for explaining that its on the game, when i had no way of knowing that youre not home and on your game at this moment so yes
---
Please don't believe that
---
I finally did my pallet stuns challenge thanks to a Huntress who wanted some basement hooks, so after she ate those four pallets I would not even wiggle so she could cross the whole map to basement hook me twice and let us escape (she had Iron Grasp + Agitation lol)
---
No i woudnt try anything but streched res
---
Your control as a killer over god loops is to not engage in this. God loops are definitely bad for the game, but what do you expect from survivors who were found nearby to it, especially if there's nothing else to loop around, just ignore it? Your task as survivor in a chase is to stall the killer as long as possible. If killer just runs after you over the god loop, you are doing your team a favor as a survivor by abusing the shit out of it, even if it doesn't have much relation to you being a skilled survivor.
---
Again, I'm not saying god loops are good - I'm saying these are bad for the game. But they are good for survivors team if killer wastes too much time on those.
---
Outplayed
---
You're not listening and just arguing for the sake of arguing. Still talking about a 4 mins timer and hat doesn't apply in the situation. There's no point trying to get you to understand. Maybe you'll get to high the ranks someday and the situation may arise. Bye.
---
you can still buy some tiers, I bought some tiers so now there are only 9 to go since I missed a whole two weeks of play!
---
It's both their fault. They shouldn't farm and killer's shouldn't tunnel to death.
---
What does that have to do anything with FOV? You gain nothing from it other than stretched image. Same amount of pixels in wider resolution
---
Its not exploitation, he was just carrying you around, you had full access to hatch, absolutely nothing to report about, in fact maybe you should be banned for false reporting
---
sbeve
---
sounds great, i had the same idea a couple days ago in a thread here, it sucks when u are NM and get found first by a wraith for example, its a free down for him
---
Bamboozle only blocks the window behind, these large building loops like Ironworks, some of the Autohaven buildings, Ormond (varies based on RNG) have two windows and traditionally, like Ironworks/Autohaven/Cowshed have 3 or more pallets nestled up against the building (or right at the tileset boundary) that extend the loop for a million years, break bloodlust, the survivor can run through but you have to go around or break.
---
Because of the multiple windows, Bamboozle doesn't help - you vault the first window and block it, then the survivor vaults the second window.
---
If you follow through them through the second window, Bamboozle unblocks the first window automatically.
---
If you don't, you have to double back, go the long way outside the building, dropping the chase and losing bloodlust (but usually you've already lost it anyway due to how the building loop works) and reset entirely, which causes you to lose even more distance.
---
These kinds of loops are 100% mechanics, they are ran a specific way every single time, and how you run them never changes - the Killer can only chase you through it because it's too long and the alternate path like 30 seconds to move around, enough to lose the survivor completely.
---
You literally just memorize it, run it on autopilot, you're like someone handed a maze that they've memorized the path through 1000 times and could probably solve it in your sleep, not demonstrating any other skill except from your memory.
---
You remind me of the one nea that always carrys the team, they always get out at the end bc i was trying to do a challenge
---
Maybe youll stop being a dick one day? Have a bad day bye
---
Perfect tactics and perks set! Well done, I love to watch games like this!
---
I for one welcome our twitch streaming overlords.
---
More players = more money = more dev power = more thicc schoolgirl spirit skins and also maybe  better gameplay updates
---
Lol glad I got under your skin! Merry Christmas!
---
The playerbase already is massively comprised of toxic 9 year olds. The only person who needs to fear Ninja coming to DbD is Noob3 cause he built his following on those edgy kids and especially now that he's way more chilled they might flock to Ninja.
---
Not OP but Oni, Ghostface and Legion.
---
The more difficult challenges would be fine if you could have both a master and a regular challenge active at the same time. Like, “sacrifice 20 survivors” and “sacrifice all 4 survivors in the basement in a single game” gives you plenty of time to not have a player DC/actually get a 4k, which not everyone has an easy time doing.
---
*wasting God Pallet intensifies*
---
AHAAHAHAHAAHA you wish son
---
"This is going to take everything I have to get this done.  Can I get some F's in chat for my fun dying to try and do this tough challenge?"
---
Did this man kick your dog?
---
He was a pro Halo player and was maintaining 10k viewers in H1 and PUBG.  He was a true grinder and earned the attention he got.  He’s on the late show, masked singer, cover of ESPN and has a shoe deal.  
---
I don’t even enjoy watching him, but you people are delusional.
---
*juking the killer intensifies*
---
People are playing it, but the fps and lag makes it not worth it
---
New rework for Legion allows him to flashlight survivors and use keys to lock the hatch
---
I just wish it wasn't so fake. It's good money and I don't blame them from taking it, but people become this superficial fake person for 2 minutes while they preach about a game I bet they've never even actually played. It feels a little patronizing.
---
FOR
---
FUCKING
---
REAL
---
Yeah, I was about comment this.  
---
Of course he wasn't as super popular as he is now.
---
I mean you failed to get them all to the basement, why would they give you the 4k basement when you didn't get it? Should of slugged near the shack/middle building so you could make it.
---
I watched a five hour stream of his and posted how he acted on here. 
---
He was definitely a toxic survivor.
---
its pretty fun, but i would definitely play it on the console or computer if you have the option. the fps isnt the best and the graphics are kinda sad, but if you want to play it on the go or its your only option, its still fun.
---
Lmfao no offense but those suggestions are very clearly from someone who doesn’t play killer much
---
It's an ultra rare add-on that let's Plague see survivors' aura when they vomit while they're sick
---
"This Survivor ran away from me,Toxic,Report this b*tch!!!"
---
Farm all the killer challenges.  Play around and make it clear you just want to farm and get them over with.  Especially the trapper-specific challenges.
---
LOL considering "good loops" = INFINITE loops, which are NOT supposed to exist save for a classic M-Scrote fuckup...they're actually a CRUTCH for survivors too dumb to juke or mind game.
---
And then no one wants to break your Haunted Grounds
---
"It's high rank and they don't have DS... They must be good or cocky, better not take chances and use the freebies."
---
Sir this is a Wendy’s
---
I'm sorry to hear that. :( and they still keep their items even if the killer dcs
---
The devs said that if you alter the gamefiles in any way you can get banned by their anticheat, if i was on pc i personally wouldnt risk it
---
1/4 his viewers after he took a massive hit on Twitch and dropped to like 20k, so around 5k now. That's big, bigger than almost any dbd streamer if I'm not mistaken, but not that huge.
---
It's a very risky tactic and that's why I don't use it often. While it's actually the easiest way to survive in my opinion, I would indeed also expect the killer to tunnel me if they catch me because it's obvious I'm also running Sole Survivor. And also you don't get much points playing this way, because you don't engage in chases obviously and not getting points for it while also rarely being altruistic because it is very risky too.
---
I dropped adrenaline when I realized I couldnt trust my teammates consistently enough to get to the endgame.
---
Survivor.
---
You can break it guys I promise it's third seal :(
---
I'd give her some sorts of ammo system, that way she could stack pools of devotion and actually get punished for missing while making her less of a pain in the arse overall
---
Well think logically; why would I go through the effort of booting up my console, when I could ask the question online and get an answer within a minute?
---
You’re patronising them. They’re new players not idiots or children, you seem to think that just because they’re new they lack common sense. If the killer is right there and you leave the unhooked person open and even hesitate for the killer to come over of course that person is going to immediately go back down.
---
The devs have said that they dont want to change no mither, they said they see it aw a hardmode perk
---
Is there a killer based off ninjutsu coming?
---
The way multiple killers spawn in so cleanly really makes you think that they might've considered the concept at one point
---
There are a lot of streamers bigger than current Ninja. I'm talking only viewers on stream because, as I said, I have no idea how many people actually follow him on YouTube or other places. Of course it wouldn't surprise me if it suddenly changed because, as you mentioned, Twitch is becoming pretty distasteful.
---
I'm not into fortnite and I don't know much about that streamer. How exactly did he kill fortnite?
---
Lol OoO ties it all in
---
Some people like getting the attention of the hate mail, others are selfish people who dont care about others feelings, some are just trash players who cant win without camping and tunneling
---
You’re an absolute idiot if you think Fortnite is dead and Ninja killed it
---
I'm so used to people's 360s as a Killer I even finish with 360 after a down while recovering from an attack. Now zig-zag BS still gets me sometimes, this stupid auto-aim trick annoys me.
---
You don’t alter files to change res...
---
I agree that it is a harmode perk, and if that is the purpose of the perk i would remove the recover aspect and change it so that you would gain extra Bloopoints or something as a reward.
---
Think about it logicaly, why would you need to know it JUST THIS MINUTE if youre not even that stressed about playing?
---
Well thats sad i dont watch him
---
Why would you get reported post game for stretched res, you ree
---
I am disgusted that you use the legion flair yet say that spirit is thicc school girl, are you forgetting best girl Susie?
---
I really gotta start using a controller on survivor, cannot get into 360ing with a keyboard/mouse
---
I wouldnt know, im not on pc as i said, will remove previous comment :)
---
It was but his army of gremlins most certainly won't improve it
---
First of all I let them go when they run to the god loop but think about it, there is a safe area where killer can't touch or afford to chase you. This is a problem even if I don't engage in the first place. I didn't say survivors should avoid god loops, of course they will use it. If you look at the perspective of survivors, wasting killer's time makes you a good survivor. I agree with that. But god loops doesn't give killer a chance to outplay or mindgame the survivors. So, that survivor is basically vaulting the same window with zero skills. I don't how can you separate the good survivor or average survivor when it comes to god loops.
---
When survivors stop DCing on my fucking 4 in the basemen challenge we can talk about farming.
---
To be fair the community is already bad but Ninja's army of gremlins is just going to make it worse
---
of course is worth it, u should get it, legion gonna help u understand the basics of being killer, they will give u a lot of blood points and emblems too, and most important, u will have a lot of fun
---
Just tell them to gift it to each other on steam, as then the gifted can refund it even if they’ve played like 10 hours
---
Yeah just the first person you find sit under a pallet and smack it. Most survs will get that assuming they are not too scared heh
---
It's pretty late in the night where I live and I would prefer to watch YouTube instead of loading up the game to answer a question I could get answered through other means.
---
Brown ranks might not even understand the consept of a hook state, so they might farm not knowing it hurts the team, maybe they think every second a survivor is off the hook they are further away from dying, thats how i would think if i had no ides at all what dbd was
---
90% of my games end with people say Gg Gl. And giving the killer tips and everyone general being nice to each other. Even the toxic ones apologize for being so toxic. I think my people are generally nice people 😂😂 even the killer's that lose are good sports about it. You guys are just getting the rough end of the stick aren't you 😂
---
Nice job my dude. This is the first time I've ever seen left behind be useful.
---
Yeah, but they wont change it like they said, unless they change their mind i guess
---
Survivor queues are instant at low ranks.
---
Killer queues are 15+ minutes. 
---
Source- just started this game a month ago
---
That is so evil i love it
---
Likely the other way round, we will get rid of his fan base. You just wanna find a reason to hate him
---
Yes I do
---
Then just look it up tomorrow when playing, why tf would you need to see it just this moment??? Theres no reason,  there is also reason to argue with me about this shit as it is pointless
---
Lol I wish. I usually die because I tried to save everyone.
---
"doing gens, you?"
---
killers hate my meg mask, i just wanna look badass like if meg was part of the legion but instead i get tunneled in like 3 minutes "gg ez meg" in post game chat, why u hate maskd meg?
---
Hmm, more specifically, you're afraid of him playing as Pig and being toxic or him bullying Pig players?
---
Maybe I wasn't being clear: He was dragging me around just to waste time. He wasn't looking for hooks, he had no reason to do what he was doing other than griefing and waste one player's time. It was not normal gameplay. If that's not holding the game hostage, I don't know what is. 
---
 
---
But judging by your other replies, you're distracted by the bad mood you're in right now so I don't blame you the complete lack of logic you're displaying right now.
---
Then only problem is DBD destroys those analog stick really fast. Especially with the wiggle out.
---
With campers, if they see a survivor near the hook, by all means run around the hook and protect your prize. But if you literally hook someone, and stand there, staring directly at them the entire game, that's no fun for anyone. Those are the campers I don't like. I will gladly defend any killer who stays near the hook because they actually see another survivor waiting to get them off.
---
except nobody guesses and everybody assumes mori.
---
Punish the unhooking bastard, not the innocent one.
---
So youre saying carrying survivors around aimlessly should be bannable? What a genious idea man!
---
This community is already overrun with toxic losers. Every game survivors telling you to kill yourself or suck their balls.  Unoriginal and boring.
---
This community is more toxic than fortnite so Ninja and some edgy kids are not going to make it worse.
---
susie is already a thicc schoolgirl i don't know how you can double down on that
---
Because I was curious. Why are you criminalising me for asking a question? I've been playing other games and wanted to know how long I had left to finish the tome.
---
Fair enough, but it's enough to stir the toxicity pot unfortunately.
---
Great we get ninja blue dart frog toxic ass in are game a least hes not to connect to the devs unlike fortnite
---
If he stream DBD he will bring thousands of new players. It will be a good change of pace from the mainly seasoned players that make up most of the player base.
---
I don’t exactly see how Ninja is a piece of human garbage, he’s not even a bad person. The worst that he really does is put hot takes on Twitter which are his opinions. I think if we give him time to adapt to the game and guide him rather than pulling a classic DbD move or pushing him away along with what could be a massive amount of new players could see the game actually start to be properly balanced and more fun. The devs don’t bend the knee to just one streamer since the tome challenges were pretty hard for most people. Check the subreddit about memes for the sacrifice 4 people in the basement. All I see is new players and more content and so long as we don’t get another OchiDo I’ll be fine with welcoming new streamers
---
TBH, wouldn't this buff him? If they don't have deep wounds couldn't he hurt injured people?
---
I said im not gonna argue anymore, have a good day dude ❤
---
Same with killers.
---
If you press control once, they're dishing out hard R's like there's an emblem for it.
---
Hol up
---
If you’ve had 18 dcs, you need to re-evaluate your strategy
---
I for one didn't mind the challenges getting nerfed. If they get too difficult, people don't care about the game going well/being fair/being fun, they'll do anything to get the stupid challenge done. Not so much an issue for killers, but I've had many survivors screw over our entire team because of this. Even got any angry comment on my steam profile from a dude who got upset I "stole" his totems, right after he killed himself on first hook.
---
You dont understand, if killer know he cant let you slug, because he knows you will get up...
---
Also no mither counters lots of perks and powers, like exposed effect, Legion - you dont need to heal, with other perks you can easily get throught ruin. Its big risk big reward perk, downside is you need a lot of others perks...
---
Nope. I've bought all killers through Steam.
---
Pwyf still works. So 3
---
I already addressed everything you are saying in my previous post.
---
&gt;... but think about it, there is a safe area where killer can't touch or afford to chase you. This is a problem even if I don't engage in the first place. I didn't say survivors should avoid god loops, of course they will use it. 
---
I completely agree that god loops are the issue of DbD that needs to be fixed.
---
&gt;I don't how can you separate the good survivor or average survivor when it comes to god loops. 
---
Why should you tho? Indeed you can't evaluate a survivor this way and indeed running around the god loops is not a big indicator of skills, it mostly tells you that this survivor is at least average.
---
Why are you trying to judge survivors by this criteria then? You are basically contradicting yourself.
---
If anything, it's mostly a criteria to determine how good the killer is with their time management rather than survivor.
---
You don't want to continue arguing because you know your point is stupid. See it as it is and stop making excuses. But if you wish to stop arguing, I'm not one to stop you from doing that. Have a good day.
---
I did the same thing last night with some ransoms, except they didn't understand the killer wanted to farm hooks and "reported" him after the match ended, then me after I thanked the killer lol
---
BBQ AND CHILLI IS THE EQUIVALENT TO WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER, YET ITS THE STRONGEST PERK IN THE GAME NEXT TO HEX RUIN AND WE'RE GOING TO LIVE FOREVER HAS NO ADDED BENEFITS TO GAINING MORE BLOODPOINTS. THAT'S LIKE IF SELFCARE OR DEADHARD WERE COMBINED WITH WE'LL MAKE IT BUT SURVIVORS ARE THE PROBLEM? HOW ABOUT HEX RUIN AND THE 10 FPS SKILLCHECK ANIMATIONS?? WHY AREN'T SOME PERKS OFF LIMITS FOR CERTAIN KILLERS THAN CAN EXPLOIT THEM? WHY IS THERE NOT ENOUGH EFFECTIVE CRITERIA IN MATCHMAKING TO HAVE A EFFECTIVE RANKING SYSTEM? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU EVEN SUPPOSED TO DO AS A SURVIVOR IN RED RANKS IF YOU GET HIT MULTIPLE STEPS OUTSIDE A CAREFULLY PLANNED WINDOW VAULT OR PALLET STUN? FUCK THIS GAME AND FUCK BE. PROXY CAMPING BBQ TELEPORT CHAINSAW HEX RUIN WALLHACK CAN'T HEAL FUCK YOU BE!
---
I will absolutely double down on wanting an Ahegao sweater Susie (devs pls).
---
To be honest i dont even get salty about it anymore because im so used to my random tm ditching me while the killer is 2 kilometers away or bumrush my ass when hes right in fucking front of me and to be honest they usually dont tunnel me but if they see me theyll hit me
---
This post and everyone who agreesbwirh it is idiotic. You're doing the "gaming circlejerk" just because a guy who played Fortnite wants to do another game. You act like it's the end of the world for him to play
---
This. Just let me do "heal ten health states" and "heal three health states in one game". Maybe in a future rift that will be possible, if BHVR design the challenges with this feature in mind.
---
Two different worlds... Same struggle
---
Yea, i dont play killer much and made these suggestions where made, that you need to achieve somethink as killer and dont need to camp or tunnel to get them done.
---
"camper" - "THE FUCK YOU SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT?"
---
&gt;xD porn sweater
---
id literally uninstall
---
Goodbye Kahpark
---
Understandable
---
There was no point in replying to my comment. You've already stated you wanted this argument to end; so let it.
---
Why not add Las Vegas shooter, that’s be great for kids to play. Give fame to murderers
---
well, technically you have all the time in the world to finish the missions, when a new tome is released you can still do the old tome missions (as far as the devs have told) and that the only thing you need to worry about finishing is the rift
---
I’m pretty sure if they know how to hook tech they know you only get two hooks.
---
Not every day a killer brings a Haddonfield and a survivor brings a Lery's...
---
Dead by daylight is a bit like cs:go if we talk about the community
---
What perk let's u see hatch
---
What are you on about? Leave me alone
---
Absolutely agree. I really really wish he would leave dbd alone. He ruined fortnite and he’ll ruin this. He’ll want fucking competitive stuff added in, make it a big esports thing like he does with every game.
---
You dont know that, maybe they saw it on an "epic juke compilation duud" xD
---
as a survivor, how can you tell the plague has that addon?
---
You can dead hard through two traps
---
With 1 gen left I'm not sure how you managed to depip. With how low your chase points are in the video you must have been avoiding doing gens to depip.
---
And now you're playing victim. I know it's difficult, but if you would like this argument to end, stop replying. I have no problem continuing this argument as is, but it's your choice if you would like to end it.
---
That guy apparently has a hateboner against Ninja, just check the other comments he has posted in this thread.
---
The combo is a bit overrated similar to Enduring + Spirit Fury.
---
In my opinion its only good on killers with insta-downs such as Bubba or Plague. Otherwise its medicore since M1 killers lose PWYF tokens really quickly.  
---
To counter play it just throw pallets early. It is harder to counter play that Spirit + Enduring since the killer tends to move faster meaning a pallet stun can occur even if you do not intend it to since the killer can catch up quickly. 
---
For the combo to work, the killer needs to be stunned so you become the obsession then they need to lose you in order to gain a token off of PWYF. Killers may do this through moonwalking to avoid looking at you or by simply walking away from you then coming back to chase after you. 
---
You can help delay the killer from getting tokens by treating it as a Myers where you block LOS to delay the chase activation as this is a prerequisite for tokens. 
---
Throwing pallets down early to prevent stunning the killer destroys the combo as it only works if the killer is stunned. You still force them to waste time kicking a pallet and it prevents you from becoming the obsession.
---
I aim for 12 hooks rather than just a 4K when I play killer. Gives me the best potential points as well as the survivors a chance at having a fun game
---
Honestly, f*ck off
---
Nyat.
---
Lots of new stuff with dlc chapter, new perk combination and cosmetics you might like to try out, Archeive challenges to get some good blood points, But I will warn you DBD has “dedicated servers” now but their not the greatest, sure a killer can’t lag switch but the general connection lag will still let killers get unfair hits off survivor. Hope that helps you decide.
---
Prove Thyself, Better Together, Dark Sense and something to escape like Sprint burst or Dead hard got it done for me. 
---
Meanwhile I got the basement kills challenge done yesterday but Nancy fucking DC'd in my arms as I was walking back to the basement. Eat a dick nancy.
---
No, I don't think I will. But remember, if you would like me to stop responding, there's a button for it.
---
Yes but kids are stupid and easy to kill so let’s hope that‘s true in game as well.
---
You vomit and they immediately charge your ass
---
I played fortnite pre ninja popularity and post, he RUINED the game. Literally ruined it. No one plays fortnite for fun anymore, everyone just wants to go to competitions and make a load of money. Which is fine, but I’d hate dbd to become that.
---
A lot of people are also "silently" doing extremely toxic shit, then acting like they don't know where the reaction is coming from.
---
I play BBQ Billy mostly which is incredibly lethal but most would consider very "fair" gameplay because pretty much every time someones hooked they can be immediately unhooked and full healed. I've only gotten heat a handful of times, and it was people calling me a try hard (and they were right. Legacy Billy with meta perks and best add-ons at rank 13 is pretty fucking tryhard).
---
Sometimes as other killers though I'll get disgruntled by some survivor who has my number and thinks they're being clever, so I tunnel and camp that guy. Predictably, I get salt in post game chat, but I made it personal and made it a mission to remove that guy from the game even if it meant losing. I can't sit here and be like "where is this coming from?!?" When I specifically went out of my way to make that guy's experience worse.
---
Its the same for the other side, too.
---
I've only gotten extreme toxicity from killers when we were being "mean". A quick and efficient gen rush, even if it makes them lose, still doesn't inspire toxicity.
---
The giveaway is all the people who are proud to "farm" post game salt and brag about how the game was made worse for someone else.
---
Speed doesn't increase charge usage, other than that this is on the dot
---
We can try................. bitch
---
It looks like you're the manchild in this situation.
---
EXACTLT the same goes for you, kindergartener
---
*would*
---
why do people find OoO?
---
I always get really excited if I’m killer and I see someone brought it, it’s always an easy kill
---
What's the point in challenges if you just farm them? Isn't the entire point that they're supposed to be extra objectives in the game to keep it more interesting? Doesn't it defeat the purpose of them if they don't occur naturally?
---
It’s kind of sad to see people get so worked up over streamers and YouTubers
---
Then they just DC while your carrying them.
---
&gt;if you don't use it, than you are bad survivor
---
Imagine caring about whether the killer knows where you are or not
---
If it’s not common why don’t you disconnect?
---
Why does there need to be this big outcry, song and dance to try get everyone banned. 
---
I’ve had it happen to me then the killer dc and you don’t get progress. Yeah it’s annoying but you know for next time.
---
I mean it’s always been there but there’s much more than there was before like people knew what the exposed status effect meant before but I get called a hacker for running devour hope sometimes because I get yellows at red ranks and since Ninja doesn’t know what exposed is they probably don’t either
---
I don't care if you continue replying. You've already said multiple times that you wanted this argument to end. We've said our goodbyes but it's evident you want last word. Prove me wrong.
---
'BIG BOOT' - activatable perk. You can kick away survivors who are trying to unhook you, without borrowed time, directly in front of the killer. Press the *active ability* button to kick that Nea directly in her fucking face mask, stunning them briefly.

---
It sounds like you're camping every game, so as expected, people are going to be disgruntled in post game.
---
I 4k the vast majority of games with very lethal killers (Billy and huntress) and it's pretty rare for me to get complaints in post game chat. Survivors complaining about eachother is way more common in my experience.
---
Wrong. As a killer, you play against a team, not against separate survivors. How are you supposed to know that it wasn't made on purpose? "He'll think that I'm a bad guy, or you have DS, and let you go!" right? No, you smack the guy and THEN chase after unhooker.
---
What the hell is "innocent" survivor anyway? They're all need to be killed.
---
To the entity that's like a porn video with 20 minutes of worldbiilding and then the guy just cums in his pants.
---
Is this why I seem to be going against killers I can actually loop for days instead of being awful at it like I usually am?
---
Youre doing the EXACT same thing
---
His viewer base is a fraction of what it once was and fortnite is free to play. People are being way too over dramatic. Nothing will change
---
Like I said. The DC ones are a legitimate issue. But I see whining about "they just keep running to a corner and I can't win" like, not their job to help you- its petty to do just to prevent the challenge, but not outside the game basics
---
He had a luck offering so it wasn't a 4% anyways.
---
I only watch Tru3 because he's hot. I want him to pee on me.
---
So it is the other survivors fault and not the killer's?
---
Well, no, not really. I'm doing it to rile you up. It's more clear you want the last word through all evidence I provided above. Also, please don't edit another comment on me, including when I already replied to it.
---
God this subreddit always has a massive simultaneous orgasm when someone walks in like “HEY GUYS KILLER HERE BUT I DONT ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME TELL ME HOW GOOD I AM HAHA KILLERMANBAD”
---
Is it really that toxic? I’m at rank 10 in surv and killer with about 100 hours and I haven’t seen anything too bad. Maybe a salty person in 1 in 10 games.
---
Wrong. Iron Will is by far. You can run jungle gyms in twice as many paths as before, hide, quietly heal, flashlight save etc. it makes the biggest weakness of being injured null. Blood is also a thing but unless it’s an indoor map most killers struggle tracking with blood and rely on sound + scratch marks. With sound gone, who knows which unique way you decided to run the jungle gym and now you extend the chase without using any pallets
---
Saying that pig is op
---
I think OP was trying to do the spine chill archive challenge.
---
Sigh
---
Because this forum is massively biased toward survivor mains and he wouldn’t get epic internet points for that
---
Running in to the corner is just a way to give themselves enough time to DC. Anyone who bothers to run in to the corner will also bother to DC. Even if they don't its the same idea. The Survivor is using meta knowledge of the killers challenge to ruin to game and play differently. They wouldn't do that if they didn't know the killer had this challenge. It doesn't matter how well the killer plays when his meta goal can be discerned and countered without any input from him. It's bad challenge design, AND it's toxic survivor behavior.
---
I've said this elsewhere in this thread, but I think a lot of people complaining about constant post game toxicity are way more toxic and vindictive in game than they let off.
---
I'm not doing anything shitty like Insidious Camping in the basement. I've tried hooking everyone in the basement for all 3 hooks, only hooking people on their last hook in the basement, etc. Every time it's the same shit. *DC* LMAO BABY KILLER NO CHALLENGE 4 U XD.
---
Frankly I've put all these people on my shitlist so they can enjoy the "joys" of Dr. Worldwide with a Jigsaw Piece or Iri Head Huntress in later matches with me.
---
Because you play dead by daylight?
---
BBQ and chili
---
The thing about Oni is there’s really no reason to play him over billy. Oni has to work for his power and billy doesn’t, he has it off the bat and can use it whenever. The thing that made Oni better than billy was his flick that could let him hit survivors that rounded corners and was pretty OP in the PTB, they changed it at release so he wasn’t op anymore but he was still a very good killer whereas now he’s a shittier version of billy. Giving him his flick back would give you a reason to play him other than how sick he looks and he would be different from billy.
---
Yeah its easy to get up there ❤
---
Yes because hiding in a locker with ds is toxic(sarcasm)
---
Yuck
---
Yup
---
High ranks don't have much better gameplay so don't worry too much about depipping
---
I dont think you can get banned, but its unfair for the killer you Are facing
---
Eh, I wish fortnite was dead.
---
Why play with shitty perks when you can use what gives you the best chance to win?
---
I dont like him either but a streamer as big as him might actually inspire the devs to fix the game. Hes already called for certain changes like being able to access the store while in queue. Saying he'd probably spend a couple grand in the store if he could access it during queue. If the devs were smart they'd make this happen yesterday
---
Left behind :)
---
Only works if you're the last survivor 
---
Let's you see the hatch if you're in a certain distance from it
---
And I don’t want to have to use Ruin, but this is the reality we live in
---
PLAYED AGAINST A TOXIC BILL, GOT HIM HOOKED DURING EGC AND ALL HIS BUDDIES CAME TO SAVE HIM. HE GOT OUT BUT I GOT TWO SACRIFICES OUT OF HIS FRIENDS SO WORKED OUT I GUESS?
---
I THANKED HIM FOR THE LOOPING LESSONS AND KILLS IN END GAME CHAT
---
I like the shading on this picture. Is this from the game?

God damnit, this shit is going to be tangible, I guarantee it.
---
I remember when Grimmz was the premier killer main. His motto was "fuck everyone else, my fun is the only thing that matters" which is a fair way to play honestly, but putting a name on it and bragging about it really inspired people to be toxic. It started this common breed of killer main who would hard facecamp every hook then try and bait salt in the post game chat. There were comments on this sub getting tons of upvotes and gilded because these people would brag to eachother and laugh about how facecamping tends to ruin people's days.
---
People still say Angrypug is the survivor version of this, but I stopped watching because he's a mean and frequent drunk.
---
I have no doubt a negative influencer will make a noticeable change in this community.
---
yeah, but survivors also whine about bbq cause "u GoT wAll HaX u tRaSh kIlLEr"
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Yes at this time there is still an active community. Haven’t spent any longer waiting for games on the switch than I have on the Xbox.
---
I had a survivor whine about mad grit before. Use whatever fucking perks you want.
---
Watch otz play bubba with his build. With PYF he has a lot of potential. He’s a killer that can be dangerous to buff because just a little more in the wrong way can make him super oppressive. I definitely want them to show bubba some love but I don’t think his current state is as bad as people say it is. He’s just a tricky killer to play efficiently.
---
Hard challenges are great but challenges that encourage killers tunnel and camp are stupid.
---
I don’t know many asymmetrical games where the power role can single out a single player from the minor role and absolutely ruin their experience with nothing they can do about it (ex.facecamping basement Bubba) but I welcome you to tell me some
---
I find it funny. you have to be skin to be a part of the gang. yet there is no special about them. only edgy teens with knife with the same power. no wonder bhvr fucked it up with concept and the power :)))).
---
My ruin didn't spawn in one of my games lol
---
Kobe'd that shit
---
killing isn't the point of the game anymore. (it was back then, before leatherface release)
---
Now it's about making the game as long as you can as the Killer.
---
So no, you weren't efficient at all by killing everyone that fast.
---
Because that’s why Ghostface is fun! Also, stay mad @ those who downvoted me lol
---
At least he’s making more kids play it
---
SERIOUSLY HAD TWO DC TRYING TO DO THE BASEMENT KILLS CHALLENGE AND THE LAST SURVIVOR GOT MAD AT ME. OK BUDDY
---
You can adapt to it.
---
What kind of sick fuck burns a Lerys
---
You’re crying because a grey rank did something stupid. Are you actually having a laugh 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I don't understand this console war effect this sub has. Tbh it's kinda sad. We all play what we are comfortable with and i welcome challenges bringing that diversity of people playing both sides. You're gonna learn how to play the game better in both sides.
---
That's what they were saying.  Kids won't wait 15+ minutes for a killer queue, so they'll try survivor instead.  Then they'll get slaughtered over and over, then quit.
---
DBD is in a terrible spot right now.  They have so many outstanding issues.
---
I agree the counter in the sense of DC should be fixed, and the idea that meta knowledge can affect play, but that's part of the challenge- no worse than someone with a flashlight challenge- killer goes "oh. You have a flashlight and your chasing me around, not going to break anymore pallets and will face a wall for every pick up animation" Or "all 4 of you are running flashlights, lobby dodge/ 2 from the chests? DC" - they wouldn't do that in a normal game but whining about the killers doing it doesn't change that it's a tactic to both avoid the challenge and do their objective or bad behavior.
---
It's toxic in that its behavior ONLY to deny a challenge, but many people in a normal game would flee as far as possible if the killer headed for the basement even in a normal game pre-challenge so it's not 100% new
---
I've been reading comments here saying they "want to Mori him themselves", and "him and his wife are trash".
---
God damn. What has this man ever done or said to warrant fucking death threats? Meanwhile, PewDiePie is screaming racial slurs and gamers worship him. I'm too old for this generation of gaming.

Please do one for survivors next lmao, that was great!
---
Cause it's usually some [Twitch.TV](https://Twitch.TV) jackass that either thinks they are the n00b3 or some other pleasant player that sits in the corner of the maps.  Sigh.
---
I think you fundamentally misunderstand what efficient means lol
---
Maybe it isnt the "best" way or the way the game wants you to play, but it is most certainly efficient.
---
I hate that you can't change usernames in the ps4, I would do this 24/7 if it was possible
---
I don't think you understood the concept of this message.
---
Trust me homie this games gonna be better off without ya
---
Tell you what dude, keep preaching about DC penalties while overlooking the massive problems of the game which makes it unfun, and watch the playerbase decline until the only people playing are like you, 'pure of heart'. I'm sure that will make the game super fun.
---
Pretty sure he’s already rank 10. But he plays with SWF so im not surprised if he reaches red ranks soon but it’s obvious without SWF he’d suck. And his fans probably think the way he plays is optimal so doubt it
---
Ok who ?
---
What killer burns a Haddonfield
---
Imo it can't get any worse than it already is.
---
If hes going out that fast then he is definitely being boosted I mean it's not hard to rank up in this game but hes not even good at the game he plays it made him famous let alone this one which takes more.
---
 Hes definitely not going to survive as soon as he plays so well hes going to died instantly
---
Wanna get accused of hacking all you have to do is face them with scratched mirror Myers on the game with noed, ruin, pwyf, and light born. Little toxic assholes won't know what hit them literally
---
Thats how he got glowing herpes from Wraith.
---
To be real here. If a killer really wants to tunnel you, DS isn't gonna stop that.
---
Honey, I’m not defending anyone. Your hate boner for this streamer is something else. The fact that he started playing this game, will be better for everyone in the community, even though you don’t want to accept it. He’ll bring on a new player base, which will bring more money , which will most probably help improve the game. Don’t be such a hater and grow up. Time to realise that maybe he will be good for our community, even though he acts how he acts. Have a good day!
---
I get flame as a Billy main for using BBQ Billy too. Problem is, I end up 3 hooking everyone, even as people counter play my BBQ
---
Oof. Condolences. And I'm sorry they are jerks with the DCs, some people just can't handle losing is what that boils down to
---

---
BAM BAM
---
Wanna take a guess how the resources are divided?  I'll give you a hint;  the team that earns them $$$ gets the most resources. BHVR has proven they've chosen greed over integrity time and time again. The expansive production of skins compared with dubious balance decisions at best show that.   Dedicated servers are still shit, DC bans are questionable, balance is fucked, matchmaking queues are hell, but you'll be able to prance around as an elf for only $10.
---
Yes, you can get there
---
Cats and dogs living together, it’s mass hysteria!
---
Yeah and the new ranking system half of the community will be at red ranks. And I doubt he plays killer and he has a lot of complaints about each and everyone. How oni is a joke(op), Freddy’s too fast, and how it’s bugged he couldn’t get a RBT off first try
---
To be fair, I don't even know any asymmetrical games that has "leaving survivors to be saved" an important part of playing a killer. In others killing survivors isn't a main objective or they just die. BTW second one still leaves a room for tunneling.
---
He was a pro halo player.  Then he was dropping 30 bombs in H1.  He’s top 10 in wins and kills in Fortnite.
---
We have different definitions for good.  
---
If you believe Ninjas success was by chance, you’re either uninformed or blinded by your hate.
---
Pretty much, I probably just need to find the survs on steam, hope for a SWF and offer BPS and their challenges for mine LOL
---
*glare*
---
His power can stop you from taking actions like vaulting and make you scream instead
---
For killers that I run Corrupt Intervention I usually have Ruin on as well.
---
For example, I use corrupt intervention on Tombstone Myers because I need enough time to find people and build up Evil Within and then also put Ruin on to slow down the game once my Corrupt Intervention ends. 
---
I am not a nurse main (and personally hate playing her), but Corrupt intervention is best used when giving additional time to yourself at the start of the match makes a huge difference (i.e Trapper with traps, Hag with Phantasms, Michael with Evil Within); because of this, the best use for it in respect to Nurse is getting a few quick downs at the start of the match before they can work on all Generators.
---
Never hurts to try! Dark Sense challenge for death lol
---
If you think that Ghostface is broken then I've got news for you...
---
Lmao no, I hate the dude. 
---
But have u even read ur own post? Totally r/iamverybadass material
---
Hag for Ruin
---
Leatherface for BBQ
---
Clown for Pop Goes The Weasel
---
First things that comes to my mind
---
Nonsense. Half of the time such scenario occurs because the killer is proxy camping to the point that there will never be a good time to unhook the victim safely, 
---
The fact is survivors are limited by time where they can save the hooked person before it reaches the second stage and many scumbag killers use this fact to score easy down.
---
What?! Ninja on DBD is a good thing!
---
I'm trash at fortnite, like literal garbage at it. And I've been playing since whenever the super hero season was. I'll defend that it's not that easy. there are clearly people on different skill levels in it. I think you need to calm down because honestly you're coming off as the whiny manchild now dude.
---
And that's called a quick assumption without any evidence to think im a ninja fan just for asking why you want to kill a man. Infested is a strong term its just people who like watching a guy nothing wrong with that. Let people enjoy what they want to enjoy and if the dbd playerbase is increased its good for everyone imo.
---
Buy licensed killer first because you can buy the rest with shards
---
Obvious troll is obvious.  Do not feed.
---
It sounds like you are the kind of survivor that gets angry if I see him 2 meters away of the hook waiting to instantly save his friend. So what am I supposed to do in that situation? I should pretend I didn't see anything and go away?
---
*cue Huntress pallet stun growl*
---
Which bleedout doesn't qualify, despite you crying like a bitch in post game chat.
---
Yep, that's what I meant.
---
You don't know anything about playing killer, so keep your challenge ideas to yourself. All you know how to do is say "camp and tunnel".
---
Devs are like:
---
Dev 1: the killer is in first person, should we put corn everywhere?
---
Dev 2: yes
---
Dev 1: and what about a closed map full of unsafe pallets that the killer doesn't even need to destroy to down the survivor in the first 10 seconds?
---
Dev 2: of course
---
But my point is that it's problematic when something that already severely screws over survivors lets killers keep their rewards which fuck up survivors even more. It's not even that they are screwed out of much (if the ranking system would just straight up count each DC as a medal tier for ranking, so one DC would guarantee all bronze at least, 2 would be silver, 3 would be gold and 4 would be Iridescent)
---
focus on licensed dlcs, u can buy the rest just playing, id get pig, cause i like her, but freddy, myers and ghostface are good too
---
r/EmojiPolice you are being put under arrest, any emojis used can and will be put against you in the courtroom. (under breath) normies.

Exactly the first 3 I went for! (btw, OP in case you didn’t know you can just get the perks from the shrine if they ever show up)
---
Drink from thousands fountains
---
This is how most DBD cosplayers look like.
---
But then no one would run Iron Will.
---
&gt; what do you want me to do? Ignore him so I get genrushed
---
You do realize that is an excellent way of getting "genrushed". No pressure on 3 survivors and if the one you're targeting can loop you're just throwing the game.
---
Doesn't running both just result in them using that time to find ruin?
---
This would mean a lot more if this 'Sky is falling' mentality didn't crop up every time a significant change was made.
---
&gt;" BHVR is removing genuine infinite loops?! This game is dead, there's no way people will want to play after they get rid of them!"
---
&gt; "BHVR is nerfing healing? Enjoy your dead game, no one is going to want to play after this!"
---
&gt; "Removing Pallet Vacuum?! Jesus, it's like BHVR just wants survivors to line up at the hook and give killers a free win. Dead game incoming!"
---
&gt; "Exhaustion nerfs? Once again BHVR has killed their game, I can't even imagine how much more dead this game can get!"
---
The only people who would leave this game over D/C penalties are people who are likely to run into the 1 hour /6 hour /24 hour temp ban levels of the system on a constant basis. And at that point, it's hard to feel bad for someone who apparently spends more time disconnecting from the game than actually playing it. So good riddance, I'm sure the rest of the playerbase won't miss people who regularly ruin the game for the other 4 people because some facet of the match didn't meet their personal approval level of 'fun'.
---
add me?
---
#DISS WHAT?

"BuT iF tHeY cHaNgE it ThEy WoNt bE ChALlEnGeS."

I'm sick of people white-knighting for BVHR. Most of these challenges were not well thought out and clearly shows that they don't play their own game. Downvote me if you want, idgaf. Bending over and accepting everything that BVHR puts out is why they are complacent now.
---
See, at first I thought extra bloodpoints would a good thing for it. It's supposed to be a hard mode, why not add a reward for it? But, do we really want to encourage more people to be a detriment to the team just for some extra bloodpoints? Solo queue can be frustrating enough as it is, I can only imagine the headache of having even more No Mithers in the game. ~~That said, as a killer bring it on.~~
---
Not even that just step over the window and walk left and you're just on it, that spot only makes it so you can't get hit from one direction
---
Piggy it's a little cutie :D
---
Wow rude. It cheered me up on a really bad day. MY BAD.
---
And it shouldn't. There is that wall that makes me think it shouldn't. The killer loses a lot of time trying to reach that place and survivors can just jump with balanced landing.
---
Devs removed the hay for a reason
---
I, Giorno Giovanna, will murder these children.

Bruh i'm laughing at this more then i should be, i just imagine plague with the nani eyes when you vomit
---
ikr? it gets even worse, things like "u won bc of bbq", "have fun with ur training wheel perk", "play fair, learn to play without bbq", "bbq is op but devs wont change it cause bby killers would stop playing"
---
I hate when talentless hacks try to put their immature bullshit under the guise of stage persona. And people just eat it up, too - look at how inexplicably popular CinemaSins is. 
---
It's especially appalling when the """performer""" targets children and adolescents as his audience - because then he essentially teaches them that saying dumb, hurtful shit is okay because you can back out of it when you get called out.
---
I always check my ruin at least once when the match starts; it’s certainly possible but they usually go look for a generator first before looking for ruin. 
---
It’s also worth noting a few other perks that slow generator progress, such as Pop goes the Weasel (which appears to be a great perk for nurse considering her ability to get downs quickly).
---
Don’t trust no one,not even illusions
---
Wait they are making it even easier to rank up this game already has the most forgiving ranking system I've ever seen.
---
OMG That was perfect!
---
listen to this guy and buy any killer calls your attention
---
Nah we here still
---
Doc is just about the only killer I use insidious on. It's like it was made for him.
---
I have more of a problem with pgtw personally. I dont think it needs changes but it is annoying to have a gen 80% just to come back and it is dead...or to have it kicked work on it till it's 80% again just to have the killer come and pop it again.
---
From what i’ve heard, yeah they are. You can probably ask most people or look it up.
---
I have played fortnight in the past and I can honestly tell you that the difference in skill level between someone who is actually good at it is noticeable but ninja is your average player at best.
---
 No one should be defending him or that game I don't care if I come off as a whiny manchild I am still infinitely better than him in every conceivable way because I'm not a whiny man child even if the 11 year olds that call themselves his fans don't like the fact that he is a piece of human shit
---
Entity has like, thousands of other trials to watch at the same time tho, isn't that a bit too much?

Fuckin hell. I hate the guy, but murder? I think that's a little far.

#YOU KILLED MY BOY!!!! D:
---
Fuck.  I mean if they make it a little harder to rank I won't have any complaints with a 3rd going to make it easier that I'm not going to enjoy I know what my peak is and I know that I don't see myself improving very much and I'm OK with that. I'm in purple and I'm happy there
---
No u
---
That would require them to think about the health of the game. They're too busy getting drunk off of that sweet skin revenue.
---
This happens to me so often and my swf group don’t know why I keep laughing/screaming
---
I'm not a fan on Ninja but do care to explain how he "killed" Fortnite because if I remember correctly he was part of the main reason it blew up so HUGE after it's initial burst of growth.
---
DBD community is toxic like pretty much EVERY game is right now.  Ninja playing DBD will bring in more people, toxic or not, just like the game had anyway I welcome him and his players because smaller queue times and the game gets more attention.
---
Also I don't know where this fake view point of "all his fans are toxic 12 year olds" wow he played fortnite a game that that like 78 million concurrent players it had people from all ages.  Honestly I'd take anyone from his community and Ninja himself than you and the type of people that agree with you who are just hateful to an entire community with pretty much no reason other than "It's popular to hate ninja and his community"
---
You know what else is obnoxious?
---
Mocking other people and writing in FULL CAPITALS in an attempt to come off as witty and funny.
---
It's a wholesome post. Would you rather post number 4841 about 'muh broken dedicated servers' or 'survivor/killer bad plz nerf'?
---
It's called a joke that's why I said mori.
---
 But I will admit it if I saw him face to 1st I would beat  his little sissy ass
---
Well yeah. So I really wont be surprised if a lot of people get to red ranks soon or start joining SWFs and I cant blame them
---
I usually let them unhook. I don’t punish hooked survivors. It’s easy to get the first hit while they unhook in front of you and then a quick chase. If it’s an annoying person I might hit them back down but I won’t hook them. That’s just how I play killer. It allows me to get multiple hooks in.
---
So like the normal consoomer, you take things at base value instead of actually knowing what the fuck you're talking about. Skins are made ahead of time, normally before each chapter and then their production is made from midchapter to next chapter. Leaving 1.5 extra months for bug fixes which, if you read the patch notes, would be numerous. And resources are actually split even. I would know, i'm getting a job there this summer.
---
Honestly. It’s like that guy never solo q’s. Doesn’t matter the rank, most people are shit, just like most people are shit at videogames in general
---
I don't really play survivor lol.
---
keep camping and pretending like you don't know why people complain. It doesn't matter to me.
---
yeah i personally dont complain about perks or builds, i mean, i can try them or use them too, its true pgtw may be a bit annoying as u see ur progress on the gen litterally flushed in a single kick lmao
---
Haven't played in months. What is this? Can son update me?
---
Billy is even more powerful than him and arguable easier since backrevs exist. The fact remains that survivors don't like getting punished when their positioning is shit, and they think they should always have a way to correct that. Strong killers are a thing of the past. Survivors have gotten too used to just running to a god loop to beat every killer.
---
I think my post may be a bit confusing, but i'm not playing nurse atm lol. I'm specifically trying to learn how to play non-nurse killers
---
Not if the survivors repair gens while injured
---
oh god I have footage of this happening to me w/ the hag
---
This lump of salt posted like 5 of these long ass rants about Ninja in this post already. I think he's upset about his station in life, and very jealous of someone he doesn't feel like deserves more than what he's got.
---
It's a meme you fucking dip
---
Y’all are really unlucky
---
And also, everyone wants to complain about long wait times but once we get an influx of new players (Ninjas children, the Stranger Things chapter etc.) its nothing but "new players make game bad".
---
This community needs to shut the fuck up and really analyze just how shitty we are.
---
This dude got the fattest lump of coal in his stocking and he is NOT happy about it lol
---
who's trying to be witty or funny? this is simply true. oof at that projection. did you have a joke go over like a rock recently, maybe?
---
you can kinda just walk up there. Theres no need for any tricks or balanced landing.
---
What are you talking about? Wraith does slow slightly when he bing bongs
---
Same could be said to you, fucking cold-blooded reptilian ass motherfucker
---
Lol I thought it was obvious I knew that in my last message 😂
---
I know why they complain though. They aren't happy I don't let them win.
---
Music to my ears. To bad you have to force people to not be douchy.

This is an issue, but at least for me I like to run Devour Hope a lot, especially if I haven’t played for a while and I’m back to double digit ranks where it’s more effective. I hook a survivor, then run to the other side of the map so I can get the stack when they’re unhooked, yet there’s still that one Survivor who’ll be literally right behind me while I’m hooking their teammate and unhook them as soon as the button prompt is available. I don’t know what is going through their heads, but some Survivors are literally playing on the Killers team.
---
Lullaby needs hooks before it has a use, survivor can break it before the first hook. Also it's not that strong against skilled survivors. Use Pop and Thana or Dying Light
---
You know it's sad every time and I've made about him being a piece of human ship which is factually correct has been down voted into oblivion so his fans appear to have already taken over the sub reddit it looks like this place and the game itself are about to be the next I completely abandon...
---
Let’s hope they stay away from the forums at least
---
i played 3 games last night.   first one as spirit to get my daily's done.   i hooked one, found one in the locker, he dc'd.  long story short 3 out of the 4 dc'd within minutes and the last one died on hook.  
---
i was lvl 14 killer.  they were all around 10-13.  ok whatever. 
---
next round i pick ghosty to do his daily, get smoked.   rank 8, 9, 9 and 11.   
---
next one i picked spirit again (didnt get a chance to finish her 4 hit daily).   same ordeal.  they were all around rank 9 or 10.  
---
i dont mind a challenge, but why is it EVERY game i'm getting matched with better survivors?   ive been wanting to get back to using nurse and learn huntress.  sure i can still do it and just de pip for 5 or 6 games but i hate losing rank because i'm learning someone new.
---
Don't listen to some angry prick about it. Honestly it's not bannable and it's probably because it's hard to determine what they're doing sometimes. Like they could be giving you the hatch but in your case it was just them wasting time. What happened to you falls into general toxic behavior I'd say. Also holding the game hostage is making it so that the game can't end unless someone leaves, like blocking the last survivor in a room and going afk or survivors hiding too well and never touching a gen no matter what for the sake of being jerks. but on behalf of the STABBY GANG I apologise.
---
Well it's pretty clear they don't otherwise I wouldn't have negative a 100 down votes already.
---
 Unfortunately they probably came here looking for anyone who says anything brought about him so that they can jump to his defense because that's what they like to do
---
Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t notice the “non”....oops!
---
Some killers do just naturally struggle at times with generator defense and rely heavily on perks (like Wraith) to save them, which can sometimes be a real issue. However, most killers do have a perk dedicated to generators that suits them extremely well (i.e Doctor with Overcharge, non-tombstone Myers with dying light, Hag with Ruin).
---
Just noticed all the examples I just listed above are perks from the actual killers that I put them with; this is not always the case (Clown with Ruin or Overcharge for example).
---
I half agree with this. The way some survivors want to have fun actually does compromise my own fun. I don't camp, and I don't tunnel. They can't expect me to go any further out of my way for them.
---
Not sure why you’re even trying to talk to this dude, he clearly has survivor main mentality.
---
You have a weird unhealthy hatred for ninja lol you're all over this thread riled up. Take a chill pill
---
In my opinion I’m really enjoying spirit because my main is an M1 killer (Legion), and spirit has such a different play style! So it feels refreshing switching them up. 
---
If you are a nurse main, then get an M1 killer (Myers), and vise versa. Try not to get a killer that plays the same as your main.
---
All killers are unique, but here are ones that have some basic gameplay in common-
---
Take it with a grain of salt:
---
Trapper = Hag (traps)
---
Nurse = Spirit  (teleportation) 
---
Billy = Oni (Running 1 hit) 
---
Ghostface = Shape + Pig (stealth)
---
Huntress = Plague (long range) 
---
Clown = Doctor (Movement restriction)
---
Freddy = Demogorgon (portals)
---
Wraith = Legion (this one is weird but as someone who mains both I can say they play out the same... a speed boosting ability + M1,  guaranteed first hit)
---
At first I thought it would be interesting to watch him play it, but they’re so clueless about the game it’s hard to watch. To be fair tho I feel the same about Ohm’s old videos and he’s my fave DBD YouTuber.
---
Eh. If he gives up on this game considering he will look for every little thing ti complain about they might too. Just wait till he goes against his first killer with an ebony
---
honestly at this point, removing deep wounds from legion would be a buff, every time something went wrong with legion it was because of deep wounds being shit, with it being removed it opens up a world of opportunities for legion to become semi decent
---
Ninja can’t take the toxicity that is dead by daylight.
---
It's not weird it's not unhealthy but it is assured to find hatred for human trash with an ego problem if he was in a piece of human garbage I wouldn't care what he is hes a no one who don't earn his fame he just got lucky.  Then he has the nerve to go around acting like hes God literal flocking God that I don't like I don't like people who do that in fact.  Where I come from people like that usually and up in the emergency Room missing some teeth and then I never do it again
---
I ship Pig and Plague now
---
Even if it does attract a certain type of fanbase for a minute, it won't last. Most will leave when they get into a few matches against a strong looper, or come against a good Spirit, Freddy, or any other top killer. I say let them come, let them experience and then decide for themselves, I mean I personally wouldn't mind more players. Dead by Daylight is way different than Fortnite and I highly doubt that a majority of people will stray from what they've come to know and love. As far as toxicity, it's not like it's anything new and it can be ignored. I know personally i've grown incredibly numb to it and every little message I get intending to be toxic I just roll my eyes at and move on from it.
---
Here's to hoping unfortunately all he does is complain even the game that makes him famous he hates at all he does is complain about it so I doubt hes openly admitted that he only does it for the money
---
The only good builds that lullaby is good in right now is impossible skill check doc, and maybe a full hook base build. Devour hope is just so much better than lullaby. And running 2 hexes can be very dangerous if not using a hex build.
---
How did he ruin fortnite? That game is extremely popular and has maintained a high player base. I don't understand why most people are so hell bent against him. He's just another streamer to me. I mean in this community we have ass hat "influencers" already that are worse than him. Plus the whole "his community will ruin this game" is absurd because this community is already toxic as all fuck. It's almost as bad as League of Legends. I feel like this is 1 of those cases where it's popular to hate on someone/something so people just hop on to it. I personally want more popular streamers to come in because maybe that would give BHVR more incentive to fix this busted ass game finally.
---
Asserting her dominance
---
But it's Dwights' natural habitat!
---
*More lockers.*
---
Watch a tutorial on chases as killer in certain tiles, since you can’t teleport anymore and if you’ve only played nurse, I can understand how you got lost there. Also work on paying attention to the little details, if you look back you can see the meg running to the left and you went straight ahead.  Unless you run bamboozle there’s usually no real reason to vault  the killer shack as killer. Those are just some things I noticed.
---
Well he’ll probably starts trying to collab with other popular DBD players like Noob, Monto, Otz, Aaron, Ussylis, and maybe even Tru3
---
People like AngryPug and Jendanise have already ruined the game.
---
Only if they are selling drugs.
---
A Childs Play/Chucky chapter is definitely possible with some creativity :).
---
Seems like there have been 2 threads explaining the exact same situation and you've called both stupid with your own personal flair yet you don't seem to be understanding the scenario presented to you more than once... 🧐🤔
---
I really hope he doesn't do that the last thing he needs is more coverage from skilled players unfortunately they will probably jump at the opportunity because hes so famous
---
WHOLESOME AS FUCK!!!!!!!
---
&gt; And resources are actually split even. I would know, i'm getting a job there this summer.
---
Proof required.  Dubious claim at best, especially based on your post history.  If you gonna lie, at least make it believable.
---
And your post just solidifies the money over quality argument even further.   Skins are easily produced for a rolling deployment for maximizing profit, and the more they make, the more gets poured back into making even MORE skins, as even the leaks show.   You can be sure that if the devs promise a feature OVER a year away, it will be delayed and released broken to hell, but dear god have they NEVER missed a skin release date.  Because that would affect profits.
---
Yet some more /r/iamverybadass material. The only person here with an ego problem is you pretending to be the voice of reason trying convince everyone in this thread to jump on your personal vendetta bandwagon because you dont like a streamer. You're pathetic.
---
Im not defending him at all because I don't know enough about him to say anything. But there's nothing wrong with the game or the people who play it, it's irrelevant if he got famous for being average and if you hate that fact then you're just being miserable over nothing. If he's toxic sure hate him. And dude you're right, you're not a manchild at this point you're human waste because if you're willing to get so tilted over some guy with a big crowd of kids to the point you'd clap at his death then yeah you have problems.
---
Considering his views I doubt they’ll be the ones asking
---
The archive says we gotta stun them 4 times in one game. 👍
---
No Hex Ruin? Do you want all killers to quit the game? They should double the hex ruin totems!
---
It’s just a killer hook cosmetic, killers can customise there hooks these days.
---
mettle of man its probably the worst perk in the game with slippery meat, suicide squad perks
---
Since I use this pack my life got better, thank you for creating this masterpiece.
---
Same here! It'd be so cool!
---
Go fuck yourself cunt
---
 You can post that meme thread as much as you want it doesn't make the fact of the matter any different the only pathetic one is ninja and anyone who defends him including you.
---
Pathetic you are pathetic
---
How.. Fabulous..? 😅
---
Blame the poor and outdated map designs, not the players.
---
I just played a game as Pig, in the Storehouse, against a swf.
---
In the postgame chat I said "have fun abusing infinites"
---
And they "SALTYYYY" after vaulting that window everytime a chase started. Ok.
---
1/10, this is low grade shit.
---
My friend is ok with everyone except Susie. She calls Susie a degenerate
---
Possible powers or perks
---
Mori = gun
---
Normal Weapon = drill
---
- Power: Can throw a chainsaw and instantly down someone on a gen but has to stare for x amount of time.
---
- Foresite: When chasing player x amount of time he can see player aura through walls for x time.
---
- Fitness: Can sprint for x amount of time at x speed
---
- Threes company: If he spikes a female character he can see where another female is located on the map for x amount of time.
---
Map: Empty Apartments
---
I've read only running leaves scratch marks, this means walking and slow vaulting doesn't leave scratch marks right?
---
You should go to level 5 and butt dance.
---
That’s not a very good thing. I don’t want a bunch of 10 year olds playing dbd. After all it is technically an M rated game
---
Those slippery eyelids are damn fabulous.
---
PewDiePie is liked because his n-word slip was an honest mistake. Around the time it happened, popular YouTubers like idubbbz were kinda nullifying the word by overusing it to take its power away so I didn’t think it was a massive deal at the time.
---
I’m guessing PewDiePie let loose a bit of a real one, and pretty much immediately apologized for it. He’s also highly respected because the dude built himself to the point where most YouTubers stop and transition to bigger things but he stayed true to the platform and never stopped his upload schedule, no matter how huge he got.
---
While I’m glad Ninja is gonna bring more people to DbD, I still don’t like him. The messages he tries to teach kids like “blindly support a game, no matter how bad it gets” and “report kids for cheating that fairly killed you” is pretty lame. He just has terrible sportsmanship.
---
"There's nothing wrong with the game or the people who play it".  That is the single dumbest statement I have ever heard in my life if you can't say anything intelligent stop your dumb ass mouth.
---
  Let me give you some advice kid don't insult your superiors you little cunt
---
when i bought the game, there was no dlc characters.   only the original cast and huntress as a free dlc.   
---
i really liked doc/trapper/hag/wraith for different reasons.  
---
as dlc started to drop, i really liked freddy.   Mainly because of being a fan of the movies.  Of course freddy v 1.0 sucked major balls.   His rework has been amazing and his power just fits him perfectly.   to me, nothing more satisfying than mind games.  So when they're asleep i'll fake a teleport.  as i'm moving towards it, they will come to me.  but they have their camera turned around as they're frantically search for me. WHACK right in the mouth.  
---
i started to use nurse because shes is so fucking hard to get good with and i wanted a challenge.  I also love her look.  
---
pig was also someone i used extensively after she dropped.  loved the idea of RBT and killing people when they try to leave.  the ability to hide your terror radius/red stain is huge too.  for some reason im not crazy about leatherface tho.  
---
right now i'm trying to get good with the huntress.  everything about her i love i'm just awful with her.  I played 2 games a few nights ago and was able to get a 4k in one and 1 kill in the other one but i hit a ton of hatchets.  so thats mynext project.  
---
i really really want to like oni but i'm just awful with his power.  if i can run up on someone and surprise them with the dash, i'll hit the smash no problem.  but if they're looping me, i may as well not even have the power at that point.
---
To be honest... if a killer has managed to get 3 in the basement... bite the bullet and give them the win, that's not an easy challenge...
---
The two challenges mentioned are hard for survivors buuuuuuut you can find a killer who is willing to help in another match. 🤷‍♂️
---
Here's to hoping
---
The only killer i have found to properly use nemesis-pwyf is myers with judiths journal. Eat a pallet or not and you get heaps of free stalk.
---
Hahah I guess I should start playing again!
---
otz/tru3 had that back and forth Wraith discussion recently, and that kind of video/response is a great insight for BHVR into the minds of players that spend the majority of their waking hours playing the game, and have been playing the game for years.
---
 They would be ludicrously stupid to listen to Ninja who's proved himself to be an immature whiner. But hey it's BHVR they've made plenty of questionable decisions and statements
---
I feel like the have to be. I've had extremely toxic chats maybe one it of every 300 games.  Otherwise it's just "ggs" "damn how'd that hatchet through the window even hit" "oof the hatch spawned right under me". Almost every time something is negative in a chat it is directed at servers or game mechanics and not players. I find it hard to believe so many people get the chats with every other game.
---
 After the challenge it will be useless, even then,  not that many ppl are doing the stun challenge since itss old
---
I prefer "Oh whoa" because every time I hear "Ok wuu" I want to nut punt the person saying it. Ot scream edgy teenager who can't let people enjoy things.
---
Let's just welcome them the dbd way.
---
Yelling racial slurs in not "an honest mistake". Asking people to hold signs that say "kill the Jews" is not a mistake. Wearing an iron cross while taking back money from the ADL is not a mistake.
---
PewDiePie is a racist. He asks bigots onto his show, he has bigot friends on Twitter.
---
Ninja getting hate and death threats because he plays Fortnite while PDP gets people like your kind coming to his defense makes me fucking sick.
---
Me dosnt like like this bullshit.
---
fuck this, fuck that.
---
I love my creative builds, but especially as Killer, it usually means letting myself concede the win to the high ranked survivors in favor of getting those few perk situations to work. It's worth it to me to play creatively but it does mean the trade-off of losing competitively
---
It's not an issue and you don't *have* to lunge to get up there, it just makes it easier
---
no they aren't on the same level. you are losing as killer if all 4 survivors are alive at end game, sure you still have a chance, but literally you are currently losing the match. You aren't losing as survivor to feel like NOED is going to destroy your whole team, if it end up does  doing it it is usually the survivors fault at that point. If anything NOED is only there to give the losing killer a pity kill for sucking the whole match.
---
He's no worse then a good smattering of current 'Content Creators' for this game. 
---
He at least is a semi-household name and has earned the right to his ego. Meanwhile you have Streamers who maybe pull 500-1k viewers at a time and act like they're infallible gods.
---
He's not human garbage, but he is emotional and prone to raging, which is what kids enjoy watching
---
Pig made me laugh and Plague really made me laugh.
---
The "funny guys" --- Scoops Ahoy Steve and Ash
---
Hopefully some of them play killer and shorten up these queues :P
---
Don’t try to 1 up me on my own meme
---
Emotional and prone to raging isn't something that causes you to threaten to have another player banned just because they outplayed you and then when they don't leave the game at your request proceed to pick up your phone and start making the call only to then put it back down when you remember the cameras are on.
---
 That's what human trash does hes human trash
---
Plague does not need bonus points for keeping survivors injured. Plague needs a rework because being a perma stage 3 Myers with a lunge is fucking OP.
---
This is true. As killer I can tell the difference between survivors who are actually toxic versus survivors who just want to dress bright and cool :)
---
But now, even more toxic kids will camp the hooks as Myers and hide in the locker as Dwight the entire game.
---
No thanks. We've already had films glorifying serial killers recently and the comments and backlash can harm those releasing the content. 👍
---
9 years old won't make it past rank 18 lol
---
Seriously! Xbox needs more players if the game is going to survive, so at least there's a possible upside here.
---
You’ll earn the 1000 back as you progress in the rift. 
---
By tier 68, you’ll have earned the full 1000 AC back
---
yea theres a reason why i have all those add ons.   i dont like using the purple ropes or the irri add ons.  He is already a strong killer, especially with the meta perks i put on him.  i dont need any more help.
---
i'm running pop, bbq, ruin and myc.   MYC on freddy is so much fun.  hook em, go away for a min.  hopefully there's a gen nearby.  Start to teleport right around the time you think they'r getting unhooked.  as they get unhooked you're in the middle of your teleport.  
---
boom, now follow the unhooker and down his ass and start that process all over.
---
I don't think it's saying OoO is annoying/toxic, but that you can't take OoO and then complain about tunneling (like the hypothetical survivor in the post).  If you take object of obsession, a good killer is going to know exactly where you are just as often as you know where they are.  That's not tunneling, that's just how the perk works.
---
You’re one sadistic motherfucker
---
No he fucking isn't. That title goes to PewDiePie, he has more subs on YT than all of that streamers platforms combined.
---
What did the survivors say
---
In all seriousness both them posts were jokes
---
Because the hypothetical survivor was complaining about tunneling.  Easily finding and chasing the OoO isn't tunneling, its how the perk works.
---
Are you saying there's never ("HAS NEVER") been a post on this subreddit of survivors being nice to killers?
---
Aaaaah thank you very much!!! I thought you get them immediately and was about to buy it, get my  auric cells and buy the hallowed blight Jake skin.
---
If you've already gotten up ranks in the rift and then buy the rift pass you'll get all the rift rewards up to that point
---
you're a monster and an artist
---
Quick! Hide the post before BHVR thinks it’s their patch notes they accidentally leaked
---
I use Borrowed Time, We'll make it, Dead Hard and an aura perk like bond or empathy
---
I'm guessing he's on PC? 
---
Guess I'm going to get t he game on PC, not like I'm going to hunt him or anything *cough*
---
No. There have been posts where survivors were nice in the chat.
---
there has NEVER been a post where the OP was like "hey guys I really enjoy being a nice survivor and letting the killer win" and there are lots of posts like that from ""killers""
---
They both are.
---
oh no that's so cute
---
Hahaha😂 thanks man
---
This game already has the most toxic community I've ever seen. If ninja actually influences this game's community, it won't just be toxic. It'll be nuclear goddamn fallout. The apocalypse is nigh!
---
I've actually had this idea and am currently damning myself for not doing it and posting it here before..
---
Or just have everyone play myers until they figure it out. They won’t understand why Mikey has no radius or why they’re getting seen. Jumps are myers will instantly make them quit
---
Same with balanced landing lately
---
If you get to 46 in the rift you don't have to buy the jake skin for money and you can just get 2 sets for free
---
His channel pretty much died when he started just making compilation videos.
---
Susie (me ) was the host and I actually found it very satisfying that Frank Spawns in front lol
---
Adrenaline is rated higher than both of them and you can easily play without bt or dh. Ds is usually used even tho I don’t personally. The “meta” build is adrenaline, bt, ds and dh.
---
I dont see how more players is a bad thing.
---
Am I the only one that doesn’t team for challenges? Not making fun of op and I understand why he did what he did but I like the grind more. Plus if I fail that match I still get the xp for the battle pass
---
I personally didn't have much problems doing any of the challenges. But I've been playing this game for a while. The Dark Sense one too a bit, but I got it eventually.
---
I'm usually pretty nice to the trapper if he shows that he is friendly. I'll just farm it out with him and get him his challenge while I get BP. But if I know they are trying for basement kills, I just metagame and stay far away from the basement.
---
So? It’s a video game. Making it seem that I smacked your mother. I will T bag all I want and all you can do it cry basically.
---
*Posted in r/Blursedimages*
---
It's a fucking joke.
---
So you've never got pissed off and said something you shouldn't have?
---
The kill the jews thing, he was on Fiverr and was wondering how far they would go for money, so he paid and said to hold a sign saying kill the jews and subscribe to keemstar, not thinking they would do it, and they actually did.
---
I don't like PewDiePie anymore, but calling him a fucking racist and shit is total bullshit.
---
Why would they heal if you're only going after one guy?
---
That's weird, I'm sure there's *never* been a post of a group of survivors doing a "Killer's Appreciation Night" or anything.
---
Lithe has the same issue tbh, hop through the window take 2 steps and get downed 2 body lengths from the window.. Noice.. happens every time.
---
Nah, fuck you you racist apologist. Racism is not a joke.
---
I don’t think you can really do anything in this situation sadly... to get out either you dc or the survivor dc’s :(
---
I've been rank 1 for years and never had to use DS. I think you gotta get better at hiding
---
Nice
---
Literally 1 comment mentions it.
---
I love playing against the hag.  I always have urban evasion on so crouching isn’t a hinderance.   Plus she’s the only killer that gives me a proper jump scare now days. Easy to lose in cornfields
---
Examples of a god loop?
---
People do this all the time when I play killer
---
Lol yeah all the campers, cheaters, exploiters and just general toxic people with toxic builds like make your choice hags will make him cry.
---
The community is already toxic as fucccc idc about ninja but if he is gonna bring more players to the game cool
---
But what made you think of this?
---
so specific.
---
People say he’s toxic and yet all this thread is calling him a cocksucker, hoping he dies, etc, when he’s gonna be the most attention the game will ever get; yet they’re hating on this person they’ll never meet.
---
I use spine chill, lithe, adrenaline and kindred
---
Honestly I kinda want Pamela Voorhees since Jason already has his game
---
Oh, okay. Thank you, that's extremely helpful
---
Imo they could balance the addon by having some kinda visual associated with it so you know they have it. Like make the puke by the survivors look like corrupt.
---
Man, you’re literally crying like a 10 year old with this comment. Grow up.
---
I can’t really think of any reason other than specifically for DS that they’d have to add this animation/coding.
---
I would like to but I can't get out of red ranks is to easy to safety pip and now the rank reset is trash imo and I can't dc anymore
---
To be fair, they're not wrong. Ghostface is broken.  Not OP, but broken. His reveal mechanic is stupidly inconsistent.
---
I don’t rate adrenaline, it’s probably useful once every 5 games. I don’t use DS because I think it just makes you a target for the killer to tunnel.
---
is it? so a survivor doesn't want to die and plays keep away. But is it not the killers job to kill survivors? again this doesnt work
---
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe but this... does put a smile on my face.
---
Wait did he kill fortnite? Man i thought epic did now i know who to blame
---
I want a legitimately scary killer who will make you jump no matter what, wraith does that really well with the coxcombed add on and the hunter add on, the trapper's traps make me jump more than him, same thing goes for the hag... Her traps are my nightmare... I can't count how many times the traps made me jump literally
---
Iron will must have.
---
Bonds or spine chill to have some info about situation.
---
Sprint burst ot dead hard as exhaustion perks
---
Desicive to prevent tunneling or unbreakable to prevent slugginflg
---
You just loop her and don't cleanse. She is the height of Shaquille O' Neal and effectively has no power at that point.
---
I like kindred kind of feel like it’s useful in every game. Might try it out.
---
I love it
---
If one of my teammates burned lerrys I'd pallet stun them
---
No I'm sorry, that's just something I can't do. I must slay, all day. I used to play survivor and meet some of the cruelest bastards. I'm not nearly as toxic but my job is to kill. I need my points and challenges too.
---
Well, buddy, u got about 4 minutes to live shame she had to say it like this
---
her power makes you a one hit for the entire game. pallets run out. windows get blocked. you are going to get hit.
---
nah ghostface is pretty busted. not like overpowered or anything but in a mechanical sense he's pretty broken
---
It’s useful almost every game where the killers decent being able to be on a gen instead of healing is a game saver and the sprint burst is a nice bonus
---
Ah good ol' Nurse, how I miss facing her. 
---
Honestly for me the killers are the least fun to play against are:
---
Trapper: Agitation basement trappers, one after another because of the damn rift. Just no, I'm sick of them.
---
Huntress: Basically everything you said.
---
Clown: Same thing. I'm just hopeless when I'm blinded by that damn pink smoke.
---
Plague and Legion: Both punishing super hard because my teammates cleanse over and over, feeding her power just to see them all go down in less than 2min while I'm trying to do gens.
---
Then those that waste time heal each others to healthy state to get injured 1 second later while I'm looping the Legion to buy them time which serves for nothing bc I end up being tunneled to death while they're too scared to do anything while injured.
---
Wraith: Yeah.. no I'm just tired of being camped by all these Blight skin Wraiths.
---
This is art in its purest form...
---
That's probably not true. I don't let them win, and don't get complaints.
---
I saw this and I was like
---
Oh no. Oh NNOOOO DONT YOU *DARE* 
---
He used to be alright and he can be funny sometimes but I dunno, he’s always kinda been a bit of an ass and I really hope he doesn’t bring that over into our community
---
This is actually a really good video. Hope it reaches top of the page.
---
You could try Friday the 13th but the survivors there are actually more powerful than Jason.
---
At least in DBD I can still get jumpscared by ghost face just watching me get a heal off in close proximity to him.
---
Some of y’all are forgetting Chucky was a whole ass dude at some point. He could be Charles Lee Ray and then have the ability to transfer into a doll to move around the map faster or something like that
---
as soon as I saw the addons I knew where this was going , good job !
---
This is why i run bamboozle. No more god loops on macmillian maps
---
It was a mixture of "wtf was that" and surprisingly laughing/memeing, sometimes players also blamed each other like: "why did you guys fall for it". I cant really recall anything negative.
---
I feel like such an idiot because I thought she could do that anyway without an add on :(
---
And I would be the one survivor defending you and calling the other ones newb bitches. 😂😂 If you're trying to save someone, don't get seen by the killer. Sneak your way over. I mean. Unless you have BT and a flashlight and you want to be a toxic fuck of course 😂😂
---
Reading comments here make me wanna troll in some matches tonight
---
Dude, i'm respecting the shit out of you right now.
---
Well, one of the things in the bag is not like the others...
---
Ah yes, bullying 7-year old Nurse
---
Oh god don't tell me made more...
---
boop boop the snoot snoot
---
never once ran into this, i think it’s only on pc
---
This excites me.
---
Сука блять, hi am from Russia! Sadly, I can confirm this, Russian DBD community is really toxic, you can ask me about this.
---
I wouldn't even be mad
---
Smoke Signals is great imo
---
Some of the voice of the people giving advice in the beginning were Scott Jund and PainReliever, and they actually have some nice guides if anyone is interested.
---
Did he actually cause he needs to back off or he will just make the game more competitive then it already is.
---
I could be wrong, but there's at least 2 or 3 up now where he's played multiple matches each. His second video is called "baiting Freddy Krueger" where his "baiting" is literally just waiting for freddy to see him at the hatch and then jumping into it
---
“YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKIN DESERVE” Hahahaha fucking killed me great video!
---
De as d by Daylight is just proving what I've been saying the whole time: Ninja is NOT a good person. Desd by Daylight exposes us for who we truly are.
---
Dead hard is unreliable. Sprint boost or lilith.
---
Yeah well maybe they shouldn’t stay in the exact same fucking area of the gen they just fucked up.
---
I got a 4K and I was annoyed the entire fucking time.
---
My build consists of Adrenaline, ds, Borrowed time and then Iron will/Dead hard, depends on what playstyle I want
---
The names are very creative, I especially like Smoke Signal. Dream Catcher sounds cool, but its effect is a lot like Kindered.
---
I dunno, you seem pretty defensive towards his comment. I swear, you just make a habit of being bitter and aggressive to people for trivial things. Half the time I see you post you're shitting on people either when they had a bad day or when something nice like this happens.
---
You're as toxic as the players in DBD that harass killers and survivors alike over anything that happens in game. You're no different from them. Don't like the posts on this sub? Then get off the computer, take a break and do something more productive than shitting in someone's cereal.
---
I recently got to red ranks and it’s sooo much worse than green ranks. I kinda wanna go back.
---
Bond, DS, Unbreakable, Spine Chill.
---
Well am I gonna chase after the full health meg who just sprint bursted or am I gonna chase after the injured survivor who is healing nearby?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/search?q=killer%27s+appreciation+night&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on
---
well
---
uh
---
there isn't
---
Maybe there's some positives to him bringing attention to the game, I went and checked out some of his videos and he's pretty bad but some of his fans who were already playing made it seem like it's not going to be all toxicity
---
Fortnite's dead? Really? Did you find this out while you were replacing your headlight fluid?
---
Oh no. Oh nononono...
---
she should have ran when she saw there was more than one
---
Very creative though &lt;3
---
Ngl he do be kina glitchin doe 😳
---
Yeah, I can understand camping in the basement if you’re trying to get the 4K basement challenge done.
---
I honestly wouldn’t mind because then we would have more people and not have 10 minute wait times
---
That's *weird*: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ae73u0/mr_steal_yo_killer/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
as long as one hook moris and camping arent encouraged im fine with sweating for more points
---
Because the alternative is just letting you die on your first hook?
---
You're a fucking mad lad and I adore you.
---
I dont like what shes leaving behind and what's shes bringing.
---
I’ll relish murdering those children.
---
When you see a cleansing pool and you have flashbacks of EU losing to rats
---
Sounds like you don't like a challenge. I'd rather have survivors that are better than me over survivors that suck.
---
My main at the moment is legion, but I quite enjoy myers, first he has no terror radius, but is a bit slow and has not a very big lunge. At tier 2, he is 115% and like a normal m1 killer, but has only a 16m terror radius. With tier 3, you have a normal terror radius and a one-shot ability for 1 minute or more (depends on addons)
---
You sneaky son of a bitch, that's amazing! :D
---
**REV UP THOSE FRYERS**
---
NO MORE LICENSED KILLERS!
---
Give me some originality please.
---
Submit this to the Oscars because that was compelling
---
Most powerful perks are the ones that can be useful during all the game. Crutch perks have a counterplay, and there can be a situation when u didn't use nor BT nor DS nor Unbreakable nor we'll make it nor adrenaline
---
Emoji police? This comment right there
---
Entity Displeased
---
Spoken like a true psychopath
---
Ah yes I see you are very perceptive
---
I’m crying his groan sounds like the pufferfish eating the carrot
---
Hmmm I don’t understand why spine chill is so popular... for the notification or the speed?
---
Well yeah I too would love to be in a game where the survivors cannot mori the killer
---
that steve at about 3:48 or something got what was coming,
---
Wait wait wait, he is playing WHAT?
---
If you're nothing without them, you're nothing with them too.
---
The fucking Joker clip lmfao
---
*Accurate*
---
lol oh boy one post look at you epic d00d
---
i can dig up hundreds with way more upvotes than 180
---
MOST other asymmetrical games honestly did a better job at rewarding both sides and also encouraging them to at least "play around" with each other to offer my points. The current example we have right now is Last Year which draws more inspiration from L4D, where both the Fiend and Classmates are rewarded for performing in several different categories, both side has unlimited lifes, and the classmates themselves are rewarded/punished as a whole for how many live/die.
---
F13 was a decent example surprisingly as well, especially considering Jason had the power to instantly kill anyone. Counselors were able to fight back, rewarded for it, and can easily punish Jason. With the added effect that 2 NEEDED to die to spawn Tommy eventually which allowed for another win condition along with Tommy in general being the best stat wise.
---
While there aren't a lot of them, and frankly 90% of any other asymmetrical games had a short lifespan or were Dead on Arrival, they didn't really encourage the power role to instantly eliminate a person and make it common for 1-2 people virtually never get to play at all, especially with it being largely out of their own control and not due to their mistakes.
---
Personally I think that is the root of a lot of salt or toxicity, since nobody wants to wait 10 minutes for a match only to play for like a total of 1 minute then get camped and mori'd, so they would in turn try their hardest to avoid it even using the "OP" stuff on their side.
---
Everyone snipe him
---
10/10 would smash
---
They probably seen no hooks nearby before she'd wiggle free, so they dropped her thinking she wouldn't escape from there.
---
I think if they do a IRL Killer it should be Jack the Ripper and he should be a stealth Killer.
---
Its just that most people use it because it's her best addon.
---
LeatherFace if you don't already have him strictly for BBQ (Franklin's Demise isn't bad either)
---
Definitely Hag for Ruin
---
Those would be my top two targets.
---
But I thought you said there has *never* been any posts about survivors doing things for killers outside of being nice in chat?
---
thanks for the tip nerd
---
Wait, people use lag to their advantage? Shiit my lag makes me freeze in place for 30 seconds and lose chases 😔
---
I only saw potatoes, how could they not hear the piano ticking when you entered Tier II?
---
Honestly, it is just DCing that the killers hate for the 4 basement sacrifice challenge. I am not on that Tome yet so when people DC (on purpose), I think it is great. I am a potato most of the time as killer. Anyways, I try to make my tome challenges fair game play for both sides. If I need to chase survivors for 90 second in one match, I would divide the time between each of them so they don't feel as tunneled so I avoid people having a bad time.
---
When did this happen?
---
we already have Camaradery
---
Now I want a skin for Oni where his club is a foam noodle you use in the pool
---
He didnt, people just dont like the game so they say it's dead at every chance. Maybe they mean his viewer base is down since he moved to Mixer? (I dont think this is even true but I dont watch him so I have no reference on his viewers)
---
[hands you chestnuts] You're welcome! And Happy New Year ^^
---
My dream is to see 4 SWF Fortnite Kids against Forever Freddy or Impossible Skill-Checks Doc
---
Bubba is now a melanin king 🤴🏿
---
Survivors get cocky against people they beat easily. So do killers. I play around with my perks but if I get crushed and everyone dances around teabagging me I go back to my bully Billy build and get 4ks until I feel better. If you get a Billy game I'm going to run the meanest most effective build I can. If you get a doctor or a wraith I'm usually running silly stuff.
---
Because people with OoO are usually extremely good in chases (at red ranks at least), meaning that downing them with most killers will be very difficult but you pretty much have to, otherwise they can tell their SWF teammates everything you do
---
The two first look nice ! The last one sucks balls.
---
This is amazing. Get it to the front page now.
---
Not dead hard while you have other 3 exhaustion perks
---
Fking love Forever Freddy's. Not using them, but playing against them. It's basically a practice round because I don't have to be stressed about dying, I already know I will, so I get to just practice looping and mind games.
---
Thank god no one does that now.............oh wait.
---
I really can't help you on that man. I'm sorry you feel that sceptical about the state of the game. I play red ranks too as I've played since launch. Legacy player here. What I've learnt from this game is that if it's taking a toll on you is to maybe look at playing another game in the meantime. But I genuinely meant what I said and all I can say right now is, just find something else.
---
Both, but the notification its amazing if you play solo, i can't play without it
---
Wait, hes playing DbD?
---
I replace Dead Hard with Dark Sense, and usually go with Detective’s Hunch, and then a perk from the character I’m playing.
---
For Ace, I have Ace in the Hole
---
For Claudette, I have Empathy.
---
For Bill, I have Unbreakable
---
For Tapp, I have Stake Out
---
For Yui, I have Breakout.
---
I fear no man. But that *thing*.....it scares me
---
So like uh, Oni dick
---
This is fucking gold lol. I just started using Michael and would love any tips
---
Cultural Exchange. Run No Mither, literally infect other people with it.
---
You need to be toxic to be entertaining, literally just watch an Otz video
---
If it lights up, you know the killer is looking at you, and if it stays for more than a few seconds, then you know that they’ll be going to you, and it gives you time to hide.
---
Or, if you want to be brave, the increased action speed while it’s active can help you finish a generator seconds before a killer starts a chase with you.
---
Even before Ochido, we had AngryPug inspiring toxicity. Before there were a million cosmetics in the game, you knew it was going to be a bad match when a Meg in an AngryPug jersey joined your lobby.
---
This is nice
---
tobi is a bad boy and always has been
---
I guess you have to tell her "I wolf you"
---
nothing is taking a toll on me. it's just *obnoxious* content 
---
lol it's like you can't help but degrade yourself into this bad faith psychoanalyzing
---
How has ninja been a bad influencer? I’m confused
---
I don’t mind that much, I’ll just save them for last
---
If they have OoO odds are good they’re the obsession anyway, so I can avoid losing stbfl stacks and just wait to catch them out of position or when I have an insta down ready for them
---
Simply amazing
---
Dude you're probably being downvoted because you're irrationally upset at a streamer playing a video game you like.
---
I dont watch ninja anymore, hate fortnite its a pretty shit game, but I was a fan when he was a "nobody" and a professional halo player. He grinded his ass off for years to get where he was although fortnite helped him. But the man does a lot of good. Him and his wife pick an animal every month and pay their vet bills, he donates to charity, made sure he doesnt curse on his streams that most kids watch, hes genuinely a good dude. Yeah he gets salty at games its the competitor in him.  Im sure whatever changes he was trying to make for fortnite was more about competitive balance than anything. Im not going to tell you all his new fans aren't little annoying kids,  but the man isnt some huge piece of shit.
---
Look back at the comments you've made over the last couple hours. Seems like more toxic/ more of a piece of shit than I've ever seen Ninja act.
---
Yea don't bother with it, its a waste of a perk slot
---
Sorry sir. No more emojis apparently? Imagine having nothing better to do than critiquing emoji usage lmao. Couldn’t be me
---
Ninja that fucking piece of shit
---
Hey made a video that goes over your game-play. Figured there were quite a few things to go over.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-\_-snF84vhk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-snF84vhk)
---
other things I forgot in video 
---
You never used Pop goes the Weasel.
---
Try to break pallets when the survivor is on the side of the pallet with the least options (Their back is facing the outer map wall, instead of inside the map, etc)
---
No I'm pretty sure it's because this sub has already been taken over by fortnight kids there's nothing irrational at all about it it's just 100% cold fact and if you don't like that that's your problem.
---
  What's funny is on acting just like him intentionally.  This is exactly how he acts every single day.  And everyone who defends him including you is retarded
---
This sucks. Weird the survivor is prone though in Dying. I've actually seen footage and screenshots of the "God Survivor" bug happening, but usually the survivor is stuck in a crouched state in a "being healed" animation and even endgame collapse won't kill 'em.
---
Sadly there's nothing you can do. In this state it's literally a stand-off for who will DC first. Back before dedicated servers were a thing I'd actually suggest forcing the survivor to DC by pulling the cord so you keep your BP but that's no longer a thing with dedicated servers. 
---
Also, you mentioned you can "move" her by trying to pick her up? What happens when you try? 
---
Let me know how it ended.
---
Great that i am not alone
---
I thought the same thing I thought maybe it hides  it when you use insidious
---
I'm not complaining. Of course they'll try to not let me win and do the gens as fast as possible lol, it's what they are supposed to do. That's why taking one out as soon as possible helps a lot.
---
It's weird how killers on Reddit are constantly getting genrushed by survivors who rush the hook.
---
Cultural exchange: 
---
*brings no perks*
---
Everything is a joke if it's funny, get that stick out of your ass, then never make this subreddit political again. Thanks.
---
Try dstrike it's great for anti tunneling
---
Survivors are the killer tbh especially the swfs
---
So nice you posted it thrice
---
You beautiful soul. Thank you for posting this. As someone who has just begun to play killer more, this brings me great joy.
---
I need more of this
---
I dont play forever freddy but I've slowly began to be a freddy main... and I love hin
---
Easy meat
---
I'm playing Yui but she hasn't had it come up on the web yet :/
---
The true jumpscare myers build.
---
I see this dumbass post a lot lately. Only a self important hipster dick would think there's anything wring with this game becoming more mainstream.
---
1. Larger population means faster queue times for both sides.
---
2. More people thinking about perks means more analysis and more data but also more lateral thinking. Builds will become more refined but new builds will also rise and fall to replace them.
---
3. More money for the devs when more people buy the game and dlc means they can hire more staff, spend more on improving server quality, get more cash reports to help them find and fix bugs and errors.
---
4. The community is already full of toxic people on both sides (exhibit a: you thinking this game would be better if you kept it all for yourself) so I hardly think the fortnite community is going to move the dual one way or the other.
---
These are just a few reasons off the top of my head.
---
Tldr: every single new player adds to the community. Ninja and his 10 million+ followers adding to the community would be a huge boost. you clearly didn't think about this before you posted it.
---
That makes no sense to what I said I was just explaining what tunneling was..
---
I main Jeff bc i love the black metal outfit. and I main Spirit bc i really like her noises and every once in awhile she make a “neh eh ehh” noise and i laugh everytime.
---
Cultural exchange sounds interesting.
---
I hope his first game is against an Insidious Camping Leatherface XD
---
No one said anything about that..
---
Or as one of the recommendations from bricky is for it to come back after destruction.
---
I will not spoil anything, but the finale had me cackling. She needs a gore-stained wedding dress.
---
My fav Is pussyslayer69. He is a fucking beast he fucks all the girls and his real name is chad shadder. His main ability is putting his hands behind his head, extending his crotch and pulling all females (less than a 9 in rating) into his groin area. He can then use his stun and whip out his cock for 3 secs, or he can use his ult and summon two virgin losers to sacrifice to the killer. By far my favorite.
---
I really only find it necessary to use whenever they break sounds.....which is like half the patches that they put out lol.
---
honestly depends on what cosmetics will be available.  i didnt get it this time and i grinded a little bit.  but i'm way behind other people i'm sure.   i just want the 30 serums so i can get the outfit for spirit or huntress.
---
Jake and Jane have only one different letter, you do the math.
---
You absolute madlad
---
No, racism is not a joke. Get the fuck out of this sub and stop turning it into Gamers Rise Up. Or you can keep defending racism and get banned?  :D
---
In 75% of my matches my ruin gets akbar’d within the first two minutes. My red-ranked son thinks it’s still worth it. I don’t get it.
---
I hope he comes by console. Just so i can stream snipe him and hopefully mori him. Personally, when you stream and are being toxic, you deserve a swift mori.
---
How would the last one work with full build outs. Would it be a 5th perk or would it replace one at random. I could see this is a very powerful or troll perk.
---
Dead by Daylight already has one the most poisonous communities I’ve ever experienced in my 25 years of gaming. 
---
I don’t know what it is about horror games because Friday the 13th also had an unbearable community as well.
---
"Bad influencer and killing Fortnite"
---
Lul good one such much true. And here I thought Ninja Envy was dead
---
Many of them did hear it and ran away, but after a while they all came back, because i kept standing still. Maybe   they thought it'a a bug or something
---
legion cuz stab simulator, spirit cuz she is cute and spooky at the same time, also love the sounds she make and stuff.
---
survivors im using only jane, nancy and steve rn. with like "tematic" builds so i dont get bored using the same everytime
---
"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil." - Doctor Loomis. Year 1987
---
I like playing Meg because she's pretty. :) I like playing Ghostface because he's also pretty.
---
I just want him to not....be toxic...but that's impossible
---
okay this is epic
---
Yeah, if somebody is trying to farm their teammates, I say just slug the unhooked survivor and chase the farmer. It's even good gameplay because that's two people not doing gens and one of them needs extended help from a teammate to get back in the game. I find survivor teams actually like this, because people hate getting farmed, so they're happy you chased the farmer.
---
Doesn’t kindred work for the whole team now no matter who got hooked
---
Since the buff, it's really good
---
It isn’t hitboxes. It’s latency. Hitboxes typically don’t grow and shrink at random times. However; changes in the connection can cause the game to misread where it actually is.
---
Remember when dedicated servers came out and people were getting hit 5 feet away from them because the servers were horrible? Yea.
---
they are referring to a streamer called ninja. he recently(?) started playing dbd
---
As survivor I main Nea because I had been watching noob3's vids long before I bought the game and naturally she was the survivor that felt most appealing to me. I just recently bought the neon striped outfit with the pink/purple hair that has the mask and I love it so much. And Balanced Landing is still my go-to exhaustion perk even after the nerf, it's just so much fun to use and is still the best perk to have on certain maps in my opinion.
---
As killer I love the Huntress the most, not being limited to melee range is so liberating as a killer, I actually played League for 7 years and I rarely ever played a melee character in that game either. Sometimes I do get Huntress burnout tho, in that case I like playing Spirit because she is really easy for how strong she is, and is the least "stressful" killer to play as imo.
---
Friday the 13th
---
This is how aquarium fish feel.
---
And that something stupid is usually opening the exit gate when you left at 99% cause one of the bois is still on a hook
---
Idk. How stupid do you have to be to marry a man child like Ninja? Unless she married him for his money.
---
You're just handing the game to the survivors if they're good. There's other ways to hand out pressure than lazy tactics like tunneling but you do you :P
---
I normally run balanced, ds, borrowed and a surprise perk e.g. Kindred or deliverance. But that setup is kinda boring and I feel like perks on survivors are more optional than essential so I like to use ace in the hole + plunderers and other fun combos.
---
if he plays on pc im doing it for u
---
I’d say it’s balanced enough because if you see her do a 360 and bum rush your ass then you know that she sees you
---
Survivor: Dwight 
---
Killer: Billy/Trapper
---
Looks like you don't play killer enough to be familiar with the hitboxes and the occasional visual disconnect on pallets.
---
Exactly my thoughts as well.   Hopefully a ton of people get the game and start playing.  Wait times are unbearable atm.
---
But Plague doesn’t enjoy the same benefits as T3 Myers. While the whole “one shot” comparison is there, that’s where it stops. Myers still gets faster vaulting, longer lunges, and most importantly he can do this to healthy people. Plague still has to play around perks like Dead Hard, Endurance effects and still has more of a tough time at loops because she is more visible because of her height. 
---
I don’t know why you’re comparing her to T3 Myers when all they have in common is downing potential. Plus survivors can always cleanse vs plague in unfavorable positions for her, making her waste the time to go out and collect corruption AND you can pallet stun her Corrupt Purge. You don’t cleanse T3 Myers.
---
Sounds very OP but fun.
---
Great everyone get ready for DBD to turn into sweat fest when all the subs and other streamers try to steal the spot light. 
---
Is this real?
---
I’ll legit stop playing if I start seeing “TTV’s”.
---
Lol what? Camping is allowed in pretty much every game, its only community servers that may have rules on it, you're also allowed to focus on one person if you'd like, is DbD the only game you've ever played or something?
---
Also why should killers give survivors a fair game in the first place? Do you think a survivor concerns themselves with whether they're being fair to the killer or not? Its a PvP game lol
---
Am I the only one that don't do that?
---
Omg edit your post. I can't take this seriously when you sounds like a 4 year old by calling them gems.
---
no, it only works for yourself unless you're hooked
---
Small player base but pretty widely known.
---
In my experience: yes
---
Otz doesn't use Third Seal therefore it's bad I rest my case
---
My rulebook for survivors: do whatever you want, I like to watch you struggle :)
---
Well we have a youtube channel  [https://www.youtube.com/dbdthings](https://www.youtube.com/dbdthings) (shameless plug). Will try to make more videos, though we're slow at it!
---
Those fake pallets are a gift
---
I for one am excited for him to bring his massive audience to the game.
---
Now, I don’t particularly like him. I used to watch tidbits of him when he played Pubg and H1Z1 before going to fortnite.
---
But think of all the good a bigger playerbase could bring! It’d give the developers more of an incentive to fix their game and maybe get better hosting servers. 
---
Or y’know. Turn them greedy asf and monetize the crap out of everything they reasonably can.
---
dude's a fuckin millionaire five times over by now - perhaps he should just stop?  🤷‍♂️
---
That happened to me on the "fix 4 gens w/Dark Sense" challenge. I was livid! 🤣

He 100% sure plays on pc
---
I still need to get Jeff/Legion but any time I see Black Metal Jeff I try and save them for last. 
---
I played Spirit for a few hours for the one tome to grab a survivor off a gen. It was hard to do but had a great time playing as her!
---
I'm red rank on survivor and I had a 20 Clown last night, we could tell he was bad but didn't know he was an actual baby until end game. 😭 I don't know why matchmaking has been so borked.
---
I like his snares more... slow chases far more.
---
I agree with both statements.
---
Oooohhhhh you're reading of the rulebook made by coward killers. You can ignore that one. Just like I ignore the rulebook made by shit survivors with the rule that says "don't kill us".
---
Yeah my apologies I have my comments as “live comments” so I got my thread all over the place so I was a bit to late when I noticed it was the same person
---
Tohru confirmed in next chapter?
---
I had some really nice matches on the 24th and 25th. No one was trying too hard, and the matches were fun and casual. Everyone got at least 24k not counting the party streamers I brought and any offerings they might have had. Those were some of my most fun killer matches, and everyone was happy at the end. I burned through so many Streamers and Survivor Puddings lol.
---
You should link your YT video for more views instead of uploading direct to reddit for this post.
---
Two OG characters, I see. Why is that?
---
Even if pewdiepie wasn’t racist, he is still annoying as fuck.
---
This is one of the best dbd video i've seen in a long time. The survivors must have screamed their lungs out when you suddenly move and tombstone them.
---
Depending on which killer you're playing, that other perk better help you deal with long chases, because if you're an M1 killer you're going to eat every pallet on the map and won't get a chance to profit from the other perks. If you're running Doctor, this will be especially painful.
---
I was not expecting something so amazing.
---
Smoke signals, dream catchers... I can’t with these stereotypes. I hope that BHVR would be respectful and do some actual research if they were to create an Indigenous survivor.
---
looks really cool man, love the texture u gave to the blood, its expressive af
---
Survivor: Kate. I really appreciate her backstory. She uses her talents to reach people, end wants to see people happy. I have that same thoughts with my own personal life. I'm starting a Youtube channel, and I may not be great, but if I can reach people anywhere in the world and if I can brighten even just one person's day, then that's what I want to do.
---
Killer: I really love Ghost Face and Spirit at the moment. Ghostface for the ambush jumpscare tactics, plus his costume does that cool wooshing thing. Spirit because it's satisfying to land a hit coming out of a phase with the new changes. Plus she has a close resemblance to the Grudge, so she has a spooky factor. I just wish she didn't sound like a duck  lol
---
Wowowowow you dodged your first killer pounce and put him on blast. Much impress. Welcome to toxic survivors in dbd ladies and gentlemen.
---
Hey my posts keep getting removed so I have to ask here while the mods look into the glitch, but do PC and console have different starting killers?  I started with Trapper, Billy, Wraith, Doctor, Hag, and Nurse.  My friend started with Trapper, Billy, Wraith, Huntress, and Nurse.
---
first step, vroom to assert dominance, if u are bubba also vroom to confuse them into think u are billy
---
I haven’t watched any noob3’s videos yet but I watch Monto for meme builds and OhTofu for streams and learning perks/characters. BL is a very strong perk for veterans of the game and after I P3-Level 50 Jake I’ll switch over to Nea to try it out more. 
---
Ranged characters &gt; Melee characters in my opinion. At times I mess around with Melee character when I get burnt out as well.
---
I'm sure this community can scare him off easily
---
That's very cool so here's silver :D
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
One of my recent games I was using stridor and a  survivor was right next to me but I couldn't hear him. Pretty good job so fa....
---
Pretty sure the sounds only worked the day the game was released, and never again
---
Yes, you will get that when you prestige her. Such an underrated movie
---
Did you mean to say you don't need to be toxic? Otz is the least toxic player out there
---
If the attention gets the devs to get their shit together I wouldn’t mind. Unfortunately it’ll probably go down like this: he’ll get mori’d every other game, complain about it, moris get removed. Gens take too long to fix, devs make it easier for survivors to win. You get the idea. Plus he can command an army of idiots to raid steam profiles at will. Not sure how I feel about this thing....hopefully it’s just a fad.
---
I REALLY appreciate that tip video! I definitely feel like I got some good things out of it to apply on my next games.
---
Some people will always flame you for beating them. There is no exception to this rule across all games and forms of competition in human history. Play what you think is fun and let your salty opponent cry himself to sleep like the baby he is... But also remember that the other team is human players just like you and we're all trying to have fun. As you get better you'll learn what people don't like and you can decide if you need those strategies to win, or if you can win without them, or if you don't give a shit what the other team thinks. The choice is yours sugar bear.
---
Thank you! :)
---
The pass is way too Grindy. I finished every tome and played almost everyday and I’m still on tier 66. I have like 2 hours max everyday of playtime and I have more games to play than DBD
---
Oops I forgot to add a don’t thanks for telling me I fixed it now
---
« I get 2 types »
---
Tbh, I’d frame it on my wall
---
The one game I don't bring small game there's ruin
---
Dude please tell me you have a patreon
---
i hate it. i would be fine with it if i didn’t know that his 7 year-old fortnite fan base will invade and ruin the game
---
omg its so nice
---
Hilarious
---
A bug is not supposed to be in the game
---
I’ve edited simple 30sec clips before and those took a while. Holy shit the amount of hours it must’ve taken you for this is crazy. Good job I enjoyed it
---
What are all of the perks you use?
---
Two steps ahead of you, already hung it up on my wall lol
---
I think they should give all licensed killers with no cosmetics some, like a dinner dressed Leatherface, or a Robert Englund Freddy outfit
---
no problem, if you want to send more in the future feel free. I play just about anyone but Nurse to varying degrees.
---
You can be a toxic survivor and a good guy killer at the same time and as you said yourself, you are definitely both. You've got control issues.
---
So it is true
---
Do people really fucking watch live-streams of other people play videos games? Fucking WHY?!
---
BIG BOOT - You can kick a shitty survivor from the game and get a bot so you actually have a chance.
---
Lets be honest, its a toxic cesspool lmao.
---
We must stop ninja
---
You can just subscribe to my youtube, i would really appreciate it! I posted the link under one of the comments.
---
And just like anyone else who speaks a whole lot of truth about the shitty people here, you got downvoted to hell. Lol. I upvoted you and 100% agree with what you're saying
---
I watched a few vids on YT, he's such a baby survivor right now lol.
---
Wish i could give 10 awards... this is why i play dbd man lolll the community is fire 🔥
---
honestly, i did it thanks to a farming killer, i have like 500 hours in the game and never could get a flashlight save, too hard for me, maybe u can try with a killer that wants to farm, wish u luck
---
Why not both?!
---
For me it's Nea and Myers. I was reading Girl with the Dragon Tattoo when I started playing, so ... Scandinavian-ish goth-ish chick, check.
---
I main Myers. He's straightforward. You can stab. Or stab harder. Stab harder forever. You can stab the heart. Or stab the heart forever. Chases (esp. with Enduring and Spirit Fury) are nice. Stealthy, simple, fun.
---
The best part is watching someone on a gen, not knowing you're there. Then the Tier II music plays and they _still_ just sit there. &lt;heavy breathing&gt;
---
10/10 good points and great reasoning skills
---
hahaha yeah grabbing is difficult for me as well, i wish i could take advantage of her power but i mostly just play her for fun and just smack everyone a bunch.
---
When you see someone get injured, try to position yourself nearby, but stay hidden. Sprint burst or Urban Evasion may help with your positioning. When/if they go down, as the killer is picking the downed person up, blind em!
---
And you're idiotic. You clearly didn't see what happened with ninja and one of the modern warfare developers on twitter. The devs made a tweet saying that their players are being disrespectful to them, and the ninja tweets that they should delete the game. And after that? They still sucked his dick. They won't listen to their own players, but listen to a guy that barely plays the game? I suggest you look up someone named "birdman", the video he made about it was named something along the lines of "if any of us said this to the modern warfare devs.."
---
That always happens with Unbreakable for me, I never get slugged using it but when I unequip I get slugged every game
---
No but two survivors can. One distracts the other by staying sorta close while taunting him, the other unhooks and everyone skedaddles. Sure, someone might end up getting hooked again but this is often your best bet. Just try to get that pallet stun or juke if you get chased, like any other chase. Or if you cant, loop for your life
---
What are you suggesting
---
"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?"
---
that's dedicated servers. this is probably the only thing that running this game right now LATENCY.
---
I don't really main someone, but as survivor I play Yui the most. First I'm interested in Japans culture, I like the 90's &amp; 00's Japanese Sports Cars (yeah.. she drives a motorbike), I love neon colours and she is a cool woman. I'm sad about her cosmetics and hope she get some more "normal" looking ones, but I own the pink hair outfit and I will buy maybe the ponytail in the future. I really like Feng Min too, but my girlfriend is already a Min Main which is pretty cool.
---
As Killer I don't have someone I play the most and I switch very often. But I was once a Wraith main because he has a good soul and I like to play stealthy or sometimes the opposite (Billy)
---
You’re right about the first point. I haven’t explained myself correctly and did this meme too fast. He hasn’t killed fortnite but made it seem stupid and made a cliche out of it, turned it into a meme more than anything serious
---
And even if he has a lot of fans, I have problems assuming that most of them are grown men tbh
---
Those are actual parts of native American culture tho? How is it a stereotype when it's actually their culture? You can argue the smoke signals aren't because the Chinese first used them, but the native Americans were also known to use them, along with a lot of other cultures
---
Take it easy guys, you're going to make me Dead Hard.
---
I agree that's your best chance, but that is also unhooking in front of the killer, just while one person runs around.
---
A true masterpiece
---
Easiest way is to use pallets, A pallet stun (without enduring?) Grants a flashlight stun, A pallet break grants a FLS and while he picks up a survivor you have enough time to stun him
---
I understand killer players feel attacked by this and dislike it, but as a killer I agree. This happens all the time, and it doesn't help to take your anger out on random survivors. As a killer you get bullied, yes, but solo queue survivors get bullied both by the killer, and their team. Think about that.
---
Don’t run Self Care. Awful perk and people will laugh in your face when they see you take 20 minutes to heal across the map

That window in the main structure on ironworks of misery

Etc etc etc
---
Control issues?
---
While I do agree it would be less of a hassle that way, it comes with a cost for those who want to do the rift.
---
The way things are now, you do a lot of games to get the challenges done, which gives you a bit of progress to the rift each time. With the challenges all done passively, you do less matches, and this means that you’re left with very little progress on the Rift in comparison to how you’d be as it is now. And there’s no real desire to grind so many matches when you’re not working towards something else that’s achievable sooner, like a challenge. Nothing is more tedious than having to grind a bunch of matches for the Rift and have absolutely nothing else to progress on.
---
That’s just how I feel on the matter. I feel the only passive ones should be the emblems and the bloodpoints.
---
feel like that would be way too on the nose and disrespectful towards the victims/families of victims. there's plenty of ways to come up with killers without profiting off irl atrocities.
---
Thanks. I'll never use the flashlight again after this damn challenge.
---
This is beautyfull
---
That's why I am banned from all local bakeries.
---
I actually really like the creativity here without making something that would break the game. I like this a lot. Well done!
---
Yeah what about it
---
Oh uh nothing, umm, yeah
---
i feel like the "cultural exchange" name is kinda iffy considering the history of Indian American people, the others are fin and works well
---
Back in the upside down with you.
---
But that’s what I call them. I know it’s gens but I like gems.
---
I'm sorry, can you explain? Is this a common topic or something? That wouldn't surprise me I suppose.
---
Yeah I wish I could say I feel the pain, but this was a super easy challenge for me.  Trapper with agitation and iron grasp is guaranteed to make it happen.
---
Beautiful
---
Point it at their face while they are breaking a pallet
---
The DbD community is doing a fantastic job of maintaining the toxic status quo without Nina's help already
---
We can see the names btw.
---
I take it there's a ranking sweet spot between new players and hardened veterans? Or would you say it just gets worse the higher you go.
---
Some people see younger players and new gameplay as a scary thing. The dude just plays the game and will bring more people to the servers. I’d say at least you’ll get more players and maybe all the new people in your community will allow devs to make more free/new content and effect the game in a positive light. Ninja basically made Fortnite big. If he plays DBD, he’ll likely help the game get more popularity and attention.
---
Ah, mkay. Sorry! I don’t use flashlights. I use meds and toolboxes. Only said what I’ve seen my friends do.

You know (at least on Xbox) if you rotate the analog stick instead of smashing it back and forth (left to right) it works a lot better
---
Pretty sure they offered a spot to the creators of the ‘Friday the 13th’ series it’s just at the time DbD released they where releasing ‘Friday the 13th The Game’. So being that they had already sunk money into their own game they didn’t really want to immediately give him away to this game and ruin the chances of their own game. Even though it’s slowly and painfully dying...
---
The Spirit because I've always loved the uncanny surrealism of The Grudge: the whispy flowing kimono, the sound of glass and bone crackling, the hollow apparition that appears and disappears in the distance. It's got a very chilling tone and I want to bring that eerie and strange fantasy to life for my survivors
---
Dwight because he's truly a lovable nervous nelly who has a heart of gold, and I think it's cool that his hero's journey within the realm of DbD is *becoming* that courageous, selfless leader despite his nerves, because exactly what bravery is
---
I also love Nea because she's real, and even though people think she's ugly, I actually appreciate that the original women of DbD look all sorts of ways like real people do and not just "hot girl." I really like this persona that Nea has of someone who looks after herself, gets to where she needs to be and moves around on her own terms. She's someone who's fiercely independent and that catlike motif is really cool
---
Thanks, yeah we don’t need him fucking up the game for us - it’s fine the way it is...
---
Love it that when you killed that Adam the pals working on the gen behind him were shocked af and even  missed a skillcheck…god this makes me want to play as daddy Myres but im survivor main and already got trapper daddy and vommy mommy for killer playtime,my BP cant afford another killer…

Tip: Don't give advice if you're not certain of it
---
When in a chase drop a pallet on the killer and when he goes to break it blind him by shining it in the face
---
That’s what I’m saying
---
unlucky, there must be a friendly susie out there waiting to give u a save
---
I had the least amount of hours (180) in the lobby, and the killer had 10% of that. Inexcusable.
---
3 people ragequitted when i downed them and this guy just escaped from the Hatch and talk some shit and idk if that was irony or not lol
---
[deleted]
---
I fundamentally disagree with your point. And I think BHVR does as well because they plan to change it so that DCing leaves a survivor husk that can still be hooked.
---
A survivor DCing or going afk or running to the killer looking to die all suck, I'm not denying that. But making it less unfair against the killer is better than leaving it how it is. And I'm talking solely about the game play of a match, I couldn't care less about things like BP reward compensation or medal tiers. I play a match to have fun, imo both on the killer side and survivor side, DCing is the worst thing to destroy the fun of a game.
---
This is amazing

Imagine thinking hours matter POG

Fortnite got all it's hate pretty much from it's graphics.  It had a fun, colourful and cartoon type graphics with high mechanical gameplay.  So if you just looked at the game you'd be like "Wow this looks like a kids BR game" when in reality comparing it to others in terms of mechanical play alone it's probably one of the hardest BRs.  Other BRs emphasize on aiming and well thought out strategies more, where as Fortnite was mechanical play and aiming.  People that couldn't build would give it hate calling it a kids game because how it looks and saying that building was stupid.  The difference is that Fortnite blew the fuck up and became extremely popular with kids as well, with Halloween costumes, meme dances etc.  
---
I've played pretty much every BR under the sun I used to love Fortnite until like season 3?  I played the PVE then played the BR on release.  Now I don't even play any BR games anymore.  It wasn't for everyone.
---
I'm also not going to pretend that a lot of his fanbase are not kids, with how he blew up with a game that blew up for kids too it was bound to happen.  I was a fan of his when Fortnite was still sort of new and hadn't completely blown up.  I was like 20 then, maybe 21?  I still know adults that watch his content to this day.  I understand not liking someone, I don't understand shaming his entire community based on assumptions.  If anything it makes US as a community look worse than what we make his out to be.
---
Based on how unimpressed you are with the Nurses you face you a fellow console player?  Find it hard to believe you haven't ran into better ones at your rank on PC.
---
Also I agree with you on Billy.  I love counter playing that dude but Iri heads aside Huntress for me is so much higher on the list. I love playing against her.  There's so many mind games against the hatchets that get added to your standard pallet loop that make chases with her particularly fresh and interesting for me.
---
he's just standing there... MENACINGLY
---
Tip: You asked for help. I tried to give it to you. My friends always blinded the killer by pointing directly into their eyes. Don’t patronize people trying to help.
---
I absolutely love this. Myers is my fave killer to play as &amp; go against. I like how they were punished at the exit gate 🤣🤣🤣
---
Hi everyone and happiest of holidays!
---
 A few weeks ago we made a post here looking for chill people to swf and play customs with. The feedback was so pleasantly unexpectedly positive that we ended up making a humble discord community 🥳
---
We'd love to grow! Anyone is welcome -- we don't care about winning so much as to just having fun and hanging out with cool people. We chat about DbD and share cat pictures, not necessarily in that order. Shoot me a message if you're interested 😊
---
DBD is far from a small game, but I'm calling it small in comparison to fortnite
---
Now *this* is pod racing
---
There is nothing greater to see than killers and survivors coming together to defeat the evil that is rift challenges
---
Beautiful, even if the enTITTY found it disgraceful.
---
\*its     
---
Just trying to help.
---
Hell is paved with good intentions. I know you tried to help, but you might have given me a bad advice. And it's just bothering me because I have a ton of opinions and advice, and all of them are different.
---
To be fair, I enjoy CinemaSins (for the most part) because they're cunts. I don't care if it's an act or not. 
---
I just wish they'd pick between legitimate critiques of the film and stupid "32 seconds of logos" shit.
---
it depends on your playstyle, i can't tell you much unless i know you. but spirit is op.
---
That was some of the dirtiest dirt I have ever seen... I loved it
---
Pop goes the weseal is such a nice perk for ruin goes down, allowing some gen control
---
I usually go “invisible” when I’m close to generators, then go straight to the generator if I hear people working on them. Spirit is great once you get used to the controls, I almost always sacrifice everyone when I use her.
---
I keep getting Glass Splinters but I already own Pg lol
---
“Fuck you”-passive perk. If a survivor saves you while within 20 meters of the killer, that survivor suffers the exposed status, you gain the endurance status for 20 seconds, and the killer can Mori the survivor who saved you. 
---
“Farm this, asshole”
---
I hate flashlight, the aim sucks
---
Weird, I used her like an idiot but because it's so strong everyone would panic, I would phase to a blindspot and survivors would be there to avoid me, Standing still works and will end most loops. She's an annoyingly strong killer
---
I was so tempted to put that scene in at the start, but it didnt fit the pacing &gt;.&lt;
---
&gt;become the obscure nobody he should have remained before he got lucky and fortnight made him famous.
---
Now isn't that the truth.
---
Cool! Thanks
---
I just reported you to the Department of Homeland Security!!!!
---
Yeah I record with OBS so I have a bit more control over the feed. Sometimes AMD Relive is weird too.
---
With most killers, you want to point at their necks/upper chest. Exceptations being I think hag and the spirit where you want to point at their eyes. Also don’t try blinding Hag or Spirit when they’re breaking a pallet because their hands block their faces.
---
You puke, and then she practically telaports behind you in 0.0005 seconds
---
Wow someone with a brain u like the rest if this thread
---
There is no “Native American” culture. There are hundreds of different tribes and nations with their own distinct traditions, beliefs and practices. Smoke signals and dream catchers are two of the most overused stereotypes that people rely on to depict a “pan-Indigenous” monolithic culture. I am Native American and neither of these are relevant to my nation.
---
A more accurate and respectful depiction would be if OP had done some research into a specific group. Identified the tribe or nation that the survivor is from, and had the perks reference that nation’s specific beliefs and practices.
---
I have never watched ninja, but from the few things I know about him, I don't think he's a bad guy.
---
The thing is that I think the notion of hostility reaching the player behind the Killer is kind of ridiculous. Nobody should get angry at being “humiliated“ in a video game. Also I should‘ve specified that I don‘t really get upset at the Killer or something. It might seem like it with my statement of calling out camping/tunneling, but what I meant by that is like putting salt into the wound after the Killer does it and we still get out. I feel in the position of power as the Survivor more than as Killer.
---
I guess the problem is if I don’t stun the killer I go down faster. Which still give the build merit. Because the purpose is speed. And the absence of something that still increases survivor sacrifice still has down its job. I avoid stuns but there are points where it’s not possible to avoid unless you are going to take the down.
---
Thanks. I never thought that a flashlight could give me a depression, but here I am.
---
The legends are true. Insidious Doctor is effective
---
Only problem with hiding the broken status effect is when Legion is running Legion pin, you can’t tell if they’re still broken from it or if it wore off.
---
Not a nurse player, but blinking twice is most definitely faster. I'll just insert an old post of mine:
---
	
---
&gt;Isn't it more efficient to double blink each time? Here's some admittedly hard to follow maths (values for her speed at various points in use of her power here https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement_Speeds) :
---
​
---
&gt;1 blink at a time: 2s charging for 5.78m, travels 20m in 1.5s blinking and then 1.5s chain window before fatigue starts for 2.31m. 2s of fatigue for 1.92m, and then 1s walking while waiting for recharge for 3.85m travelled. After this point the cycle can repeat. This gives us a total of 33.86m over 8s, for an average of 4.2m/s (your video seems to indicate this is a little off, but I think this is due to you not waiting for the second blink to recharge after the first blink of the video)
---
&gt;2 blinks at a time: 2s charging for 5.78m, travels 20m in 1.5s blinking, 1.2 s chain blink charging for 1.392m, then in 0.9s another 12m travelled while blinking, and 1.5s lunge window before fatigue starts for 2.31m. 2.5s fatigue for 2.4m, and then 3.5s walking while waiting for recharge for another 13.5m travelled. After this point the cycle can repeat. This gives us a total of 57.38m over 11.9s, for an average of 4.8m/s
---
If you can't be bothered with that, the basic idea is that single-blinking has a higher fatigue proportional to distance travelled, which cuts your average speed more than the extra time spent recharging blinks when double blinking.
---
I don’t. I actually hate using them. But with these type of builds you are screwed if you don’t.
---
Its still basically a shitter spirit fury/enduring, dropping pallets a little earlier isnt that bad.
---
1. Wtf is PGC, don’t you mean EGC?
---
2. Tru3 is a crybaby
---
3. “Momen”
---
I play Fortnite irregularly and I genuinely do not understand how Ninja got popular. I'm sure he's a decent enough guy off camera but he's such an asshole on camera.
---
He thinks streamers deserve preferential treatment compared to regular players, he's stopped his stream before to get a dude banned because he thought he was stream sniping, he cuts his "friends" off and berates them if they have opposing opinions and he's overall just not entertaining.
---
Screaming and crying and all that shit just isn't fun to watch.
---
The advice that guy is giving is not great. Don’t run ruin and corrupt, if you want an extra gen slow down run pop, and if you use pop you should run bbq. 
---
Pop, bbq, corrupt is a perfectly good combo, with the 4th perk being your choice, maybe nurses, stbfl, sloppy. 
---
Checking on your ruin early game is also a usually a bad idea. If they already found it, you might be able to delay survivors getting it for 30 seconds but a lot of survivors will follow killers to see if they led them to ruin, I do. I always check the first place the killer checks.
---
I'd hope so, but some people are jerks.
---
Said this in another reply....
---
I guess the problem is if I don’t stun the killer I go down faster. Which still give the build merit. Because the purpose is speed. And the absence of something that still increases survivor sacrifice still has done its job. I avoid stuns but there are points where it’s not possible to avoid unless you are going to take the down.
---
This is nasty and i LOVE IT
---
Here's the direct video link for those on mobile: https://youtu.be/vXFRGes8WAw
---
That‘s a good explanation. Being a toxic Killer is boring and almost always leads to nothing, but being a toxic survivor is way more enjoyable.
---
There aren't many sub 17 survivors/killers. Seems to mess with matchmaking.
---
He's worse off camera actually. Thetes plenty of videos of him when he thinks no ones watching
---
MAYBE it's related to me having shadowplay write to my NAS instead of a local drive? Maybe the \~112mpbs over the network write cap makes it so shadowplays buffer caps out? That would seem pretty crappy, considering you shouldn't NEED super high write speed to use shadowplay at high res if you've got enough memory for its buffer, but who knows.
---
he didnt, people just dislike him bc how relevant he is in the gaming world. he has changed gaming for the better tbh, he may be cringey on stream. But he has changes the gaming world in a positive way and made himself into a brand. i mean the dude has his own adidas shoes(although not my style and would never wear). people tend to dislike people who succeed, i dont understand it.
---
get some nice headset, turn the volume up, as survivors get "invisible" to u, the only way to find them is by scratchmarks, blood pools, and sound (stridor perk from nurse can help u with that) u have to use ur game knowledge to make a guess, for example, when u phase survivors are most likely to camp a pallet or go to a jungle gym or something, think "what would i do if i were this jake?" thats really important too. also remember dont get crazy with how long u phase, its better to save a little cooldown to use it again, especially if u are still learning how to use it right.
---
Everyone snipe the fuck outta ninja, cause I don't want little ass kids playing this game, need to stay with Fortnite where you started
---
So can't buy even in the store?
---
Snipe him to the point he gives up on DBD
---
h o w ?
---
post game chat
---
Well there goes my benefit of doubt. He's just the worst through and through then.
---
stick to fortnite
---
The "master skywalker" part got me lmao
---
Lmao oh ok
---
When I encounter a really sincere Killer that struggles with catching me, but still doesn‘t tunnel or camp, I really respect that. Or if I‘m having genuine fun in a game and had fun chases I let the Killer know and give them a gg wp at the end. I just don‘t like being chased down by bad Killers who get an undeserved 4k.
---
Legion not inflicting Deep Wound would actually be a buff since the weird ass rules of Feral Frenzy would be gone
---
i know most of yall are actually just vibing ive just been tbagged too many times 😭
---
Oh god I just watched one of his vids... That was horrible. I know we all started somewhere but with as much as the dudes hypes himself up I expected more. He let everyone die so he could tbag at the hatch, couldn't loop, didn't understand basic game mechanics, and the worst part was the music he played over everything. Also not to look for tits on an ant or anything but why are little kids watching him with how much he manages to cuss? Like every other word was either "ass" or "bitch"...
---
*Share the load*
---
Ah so the video was staged an not actual gameplay.   shocking
---
this is awesome 🥺
---
Was this a good movie? Yet to see it. But I'm always up for more survivors/killers.
---
Thank you :)
---
You posted this twice
---
Good job guys! Video is quite fun to watch
---
Daddy Myers in his truest form.
---
That is actually amazing, I would honestly laugh if I was on the recieving end of that 😂👏👏 just wondering though wouldn't they of heard you tier up from level one to two?
---
this deserves an emmy holy shit
---
His unearned fame went right to his head
---
How to Alienate New Players 101.. guest teacher BHVR.
---
That‘s also the case for me, but even if I get a Survivor that I chased all game and tbags me at pallets. I still end up letting them escape and tell them they were a great looper in post-game.
---
nothing here indicates staged gameplay. what makes you say that?
---
But a beautiful one
---
I have never been harder
---
Self care is super annoying to see people use. Just run Bond or Kindred and find someone to heal you that way you can get multiple uses out of a single perk.
---
Should I use terror radius reducing perks then?
---
Ahaha I did this as a surv. Trapper needed another basement hook so I ran from the gate to the basement entrance for him. It’s nice to help other people in the community out.
---
I run the hindered add-on with increased effect time. You can see how frustrated they are when they’re slowed.
---
i don’t think they’re going to add bill, all of his perks show up for me, i guess people on mobile think lightweight and premonition are s tier
---
cannibal and hag will be helpfull as rin says, if u are more intrested in the killers over them perks, u should try any licensed dlcs, myers/ghostface/freddy/pig they are really good, and u can only buy them with real money so id get them now that they are on sale
---
I have the headset, and can track scratches but the part that throws me off is when I hear them it sounds like they're close so I pop out and they're still really far ahead or have gone another direction.
---
Aren't the tome challenges permanent though and the rift is the only thing that cycles...? I get that people wanna get the missions done but personally I dislike the number of players I'm encountering now game after game who don't even wanna play the game because they just wanna get the easy way out for their challenge instead of doing it normally.
---
It is in my top five movies of the year.
---
Oh absolutely.
---
He's among the streamers who will bitch about everything when they don't like it and demand nonspecific changes (which happen in FN because Epic catered to pros for a long ass time) but then will praise the shit out of the Devs when they listen to him and the other screaming and crying "pros".
---
He just can't play a game like a normal person and enjoy it. His ego and fame get the better of him and it's actually the worst. At the very least, bless him for giving gamers a good image on Ellen's show by being patient and ignoring how much money he makes but I can't remember any other good qualities. He is ***so*** egotistical.
---
No problem
---
Console player here.  I just block all communications.   The community is becoming overwhelming toxic.  It’s a shame because I really enjoy the game.
---
To add to what others said - when a plague brings a black ward she usually has that add on
---
I suppose. Just irritating that the devs sometimes don’t think about all the other perks and how they effect each other.
---
I know that Claudette has skidmarks in his underwear now.
---
I always build perks around a central theme, so my clown is all about hook and kick. Dying light, pop goes the weasel, huntresses lullaby and overcharge mean that if you start losing, you keep losing.
---
When has we’re gonna live for ever been considered meta
---
I fully expect him to start demanding changes to the game and it will ruin the game because he doesn't know what hes doing then anyone who doesn't like his changes he will flocking shame them and have his following attack them like he does everything else.  As soon as the deaf stand up to him he'll quit playing and threatened them and do all his normal baby man bolshie it within when they cater to him he will praise them endlessly
---
Dude.... Teach me.
---
I'd have to see how its implemented before i could agree with an anti tunneling emblem as i just imagine it would(in higher ranks atleast) boil down to survivors permanently trying to bodyblock the killer or just straight up doing gens in his face if they know they were the last one hooked cuz he would have to ignore them or face bronzing a whole emblem.
---
tldr; i like the idea, but I'm afraid of it being implemented in a way where survivors can abuse it to make playing killer even more shit than it is
---
I mean 1 and 3 are fine.
---
4 is kinda wtf, Does tyde even still play this game
---
And you have to be aware of where you face when you phase walk. The "husk" you leave behind is what emits your terror radius. So if you leave it facing a wall or awkward position, it's obvious you're phase walking
---
This is really nice, but sometimes I queue up really wanting a game and to then see the killer just hitting the gen rly annoys me
---
Nemesis literally exsists to synergise with other obsession perks, i dont see the problem with it
---
then u more likely just need more practice, until u get used to track the sounds, theres no easy way to do it other than good headphones that u already have.
---
Snares are better, but pallets are a lot more fun when they work
---
I’ll gladly butt wiggle my Ass off in front of him and ask him what he said to me you little shit
---
Sub rank 15 gets put with anyone because there is no one at these ranks, also can these threads start getting banned/removed.
---
I tried to delete it reddit is being stupid about it.
---
the apple, yeah its great, only one pool, its all u need
---
Fantastic. I'll watch it asap. Many thanks.
---
OHHHHHH that explains a lot, I kept getting dodged as I was starting to phasewalk
---
What else we got? Crunch roll? Express VPN? Skillshare? Squarespace? Wix? Melodics? Curiosity Stream?
---
Your supposed to kill them not masacre an entire race of survivors
---
Ah ok
---
That's true with almost every culture though, they all have their own cultures within the overhang of that one culture. It happens because it's easier for people to learn about those cultures as a general idea before diving into the specifics that go from group to group. There's no American culture because each state has their own but yet there are plenty of common ideas and traditions that are shared with enough of those groups that you can identify them as an American culture for people that aren't part of it
---
Nice! I've got a birthday suit Clown with Distressing, Infectious Fright, Enduring and Make Your Choice. It's all about getting everyone revealed and exposed so nobody can hide
---
As a survivor main, this is amazing.
---
Finally, *Oni dick*. Someone with CULTURE.
---
It's gotten a lot better since 2017. When I play now I'm constantly surprised how I'm not having my steam profile bombarded by sore losers anymore. Lot less flaming in chat and disconnected too.
---
You'll get used to it. The biggest pieces are just predicting where a survivor will be, understanding how much time you have during phasing, and above all else, have good headphones!
---
If by abusing pallets you mean completely waste them then sure
---
True but the cultural exchange thing could be done about any kind of culture since they all have had some form of cultural exchange at some point in time with a differing culture
---
Oh my b, that's what I meant
---
/r/Holup
---
You'd have stopped playing years ago then if that was your trigger to quit
---
I so deeply want to hear their verbal reactions when they realized they were getting baited. 😆
---
I'm either using that or the add on where when you puke it shows your aura. Either way it made time more simple for me.
---
Yeah I get you, that shack pallet throw was just sad. :(
---
I hope he gets targeted and sniped in every game he plays, so much so that he has to stop playing the game so he can't further infect it with his shitty personality and army of gremlins
---
Not sure what makes you think this was staged. This was real gameplay. Took a lot of afking and actually made me lose ranks (went from 8 to 14), also quite a lot of failed attempts, many people just rushed gens and ran away. You can see the player names and everything, maybe some people can even recognize themselves.
---
Best thing I saw in this sub personally so far. 10/10 tier art.

Claudettes have an awful reputation though. Doesn't mean you're bad, but when I see a P3 Claudette I just know she'll DC on first down and honestly? I'm right most of the time.  
---
Kindred and Bond are better than SC. SC is slow and long, it'll always be better to have someone else heal you.
---
Who cares, it's not like the playerbase can get any more toxic lol.
---
How do you heal someone with No Mither tho
---
Well at least your better garbage then me
---
^cos I am sure hungry for one
---
**HELP**
---
You've got to be kidding. DbD is not that complicated of a game. Not to mention you made a whole post saying you made purple rank lol not really that good yourself are ya.
---
Wouldn't they hear the music on tier 2 and know you're not afk tho?
---
Maybe it's a survivor that spent the last 2 years in a coma and doesn't know they closed all the good windows there a year and a half ago.  Lerys used to be insane for survivor.  That map always feels like a pretty free win for me these days as killer.  But back in the day survivors would send you there all the time with offerings.  It really was a pretty cheesy map for a while but the rework shut that shit down real quick.
---
How do you tier up without them realizing your not AFK
---
There are perks to overcome it and good teamwork can get you out of that crap
---
Ruin, Corrupt Intervention and Pop goes the weasel if you really want gen control. People will hate you though
---
I don’t even think CoD/Halo on the Xbox was this toxic.
---
If I play Killer, I’m guaranteed to get one very personal, vulgar and just flat out garbage post-game Chat. 
---
I don’t think I’ve been told to hang myself/kill myself more in any other game.
---
Wow. People love talking crap despite the fact that they only escaped due to pure luck.
---
Not him and I dont think its staged but wouldnt the loud tier up noise from stalking indicate hes not AFK? I'd imagine that's what the other guy means
---
No :p cheers mate
---
The bad survivors will complain about anything
---
We need a killer who is a master of illusions. Watching the person pretend to be a doc hallucination made me imagine a killer who left wondering body doubles to trick surviors.
---
Let me guess...you are a GhostFace main and you got easy wins/downs and you think you're good because of that. Nice try
---
Lol this kid seriously telling you all "I must have the last word".  Kah you're a funny dude man.  Like I see you get petty and nasty with people in comments all the time here but flat out admitting that you require the last word is one of the silliest things I've ever seen on here.  You got some growing up to do man.
---
Survivors and killers agreeing on something for once 🧠
---
I have completed all the tome challenges but I still have more than 10 tiers to go in the actual rift, hoping I will finish in time.
---
I only see mori and bring Mori if I see a key. Fight bullsh*t with bullsh*t.
---
I like the killer challenges that revolve around using a certain perk (except that NOED one, that's stupid but at least it's easy). More challenges like that, promoting using different perks, than hooking x in the basement or catching x survivors in bear traps.
---
This is everything.
---
I don't get it. They do different things entirely
---
It’s not my top pick, but I definitely wouldn’t be against the idea.
---
true
---
How are they similar in any mechanics? Plague and Myers play nothing alike and both have their own different challenges in the early mid and late game. Again, I don’t know where this comparison comes from.
---
This is easily one of the greatest reddit recommendations ever, that joker bit had me dying. Never thought about doing this but now I'm gonna have to.
---
With tunneling, just down the unhooked dude(if you don't have to get into a super long chase to do it), and chase the unhooker. One of other two will have to go pick up the downed guy while you chase the unhooker. So at maximum only one person would be on a gen at that given time, therefore it's just smarter overall not to tunnel because chasing one guy until he's dead allows the other survivors to do gens without any disturbances.
---
Exactly, so there's nothing you can do about it when your team chooses not to help. R6 Siege is the same way. Need a teammate to coordinate something? They definitely won't. You just either accept it or stop playing.
---
I typically main Kate/David/Yui for survivor. David was my first main and always have a special place for me. I love his character and like the idea of being like a guardian to his teammates so I played fairly altruistic with him. Kate has really good cosmetics I find so I played her as something fresh. Then came Yui who is my new fav. I love the biker aesthetic and she has fun perks, she's kinda like David 2.0 for me. 
---
For Killer it's gotta be Wraith, Oni, Spirit, Doctor, Myers and Hillbilly. Blight Doc, Wraith and Billy has some of the best cosmetics imo. I generally love the stealth killer approach but I also love the rush down approach too. I love sneaking up people with Wraith and Myers and giving them a good scare. I also love to ring my bell mid-chase sometimes to bring in a sense of doom to my opponent. Doc gives me that itch to be a crazy bastard at times. Billy  has incredible map pressure when used right and it's so fun to run across the map so fast, similarly to Oni. Oni just screams badass to me and I feel like a warrior playing as him. Spirit gives me that ghost girl itch I love in horror too, but I prefer her in robes than being naked lol And Myers, oh god, my favourite movie killer, I have to play him and he's satisfying honestly.
---
this is so pleasing to watch 😂 as soon as i saw the add ons i knew what the plan was
---
Jesus that was the most tilting but most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
---
Perfection!
---
God damn
---
My bf just started playing and around midday, the match-making actually sets him up with r20s consistently.
---
Every time Plague speaks her Babylonian shit I keep thinking she's talking shit about my mama and I don't take that kind of shit.
---
I appreciate the support man. I guess being a part-time comedian is paying off.
---
I believe the rationale right now is it is considered healing and you only really need like 1 second to pick them up. The little healing counts for low points I guess.
---
That was beautiful.
---
Brought to you by  D E E P D I S H gang gang 🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
Glad it’s not just me. Basically got it the first try......survivor baby dc’s. Next match same thing. Resort to farming........farm whole game survivor runs to exit gate and escapes......no challenge again. Try farming again and get hate messages. I am now a basement Bubba just playing like a total dick and still not any closer to getting the challenge. I have given it up honestly it’s beyond nerve wracking. Ps4 survivor main btw too just trying to finish the whole rift. Dc’s need to be sacrifices now with these new challenges. Hope you get the challenge soon.
---
A little inferencing goes a long way with the Spirit. A lot of the times if you take 1 second to breathe and think in phase, you'll realize the obvious hiding spot and catch the survivor crouched. Understanding the survivor's point of view helps orient yourself a little better than simply looking for a body
---
I’m the same way if someone DCs early or suicides on first hook. Sl chance were going to win so I try to work on loops and different things. Best make the most out of it.
---
I personally love using Spirit and standing still near a gen to make people think I'm phasing, then just knocking them out
---
Oh my....that felt so good to watch
---
you would give them your No Mither. So after wasting time healing them, you basically just make them broken for 16 seconds.
---
While a good concept, I'd imagine a perk like this would cause more trolling than actually being helpful.
---
We have reached perfection.

Otz literally has always liked both perks, but apparently you're only allowed to like 1 perk at a time.

Imagine a killer who makes clones, makes one while in a loop so a clone goes one way and the killer goes the other. Now there should be subtle differences between killer and clone. Another option is leave a few clones who stand there so when a player comes up seeing one just standing there... then it moves toward you.
---
Sounds good man.  Maybe in your off time from the thread you could brush up on your social skills.  You get really petty and abrasive in most of your responses.      Needless and silly.  You can communicate your point without being a dick just because.

Yep, suprised me the first time too. As far as i know a gen always spawns in the main building.

What's your top pick?
---
This is how we counter the incoming Ninja newbies
---
Yeah that was lag. Either your internet sucks or his does. It happens. Move on.
---
when the survivors burn 4 of these and you're Huntress.
---
Ughhh I gave up lol. I think I'm like level ten on the battle pass. I'm not fond of them tbh. Feels like I can't play anything but that game for a month or more on end. I'm fine with grinding just not time limited grinding. Hope everyone can get what they want before the time expires tho. Best of luck.

Yh i know me and my 4 man swf which 2 of them have been playing for a yr plus got suprised
---
Literally me every game. You're not alone
---
Ninjas the most immersed player ever
---
Ok, plague starts the game focusing on infecting survivors while Myers focuses on stalking. Both counterproductive activities until the ability or infection reaches a level to where survivors are one hit from death.  Myers ability goes on cool down and cleansing sickness throws the game at low rank therefore plagues "T3" is never on cool down. Not sure what your point is here. There are varied insignificant stats but excluding that they play the same in that their focus is progressing to eventually one shot survivors.
---
Which is fine, since he didn't get a 0k. 
---
Are you watching a different clip or something?
---
Legion for sure. I think they are just more fun to play as. I have both of them and I am not too great with plague. You get bloodpoints faster with him I think.
---
The background music made this video 10 times more epic
---
that ghostface nerf ain't even a nerf
---
Oh shoot what if ninja plays with No0b3
---
It's free real estate baby!!!!!
---
better yet make it basekit for survivors
---
And then you get maps like The Game lol
---
If you're a fan of any of the licensed chapters I would just get them but to be honest the best killers you can buy are probably Michael, Freddy, and maybe Demogorgon? Spirit also fits into that but she's hard to learn
---
Hag is pretty decent and has Hex:Ruin
---
Plague, Pig, Oni, and Ghostface are fun but not considered that amazing 
---
Clown is bad but has Pop goes the weasel, Doctor is bad but has Monitor and Abuse, Leatherface is bad but has BBQ and Chili
---
Legion kinda just sucks in general but they have Discordance I guess
---
BHVR when are you adding this perk? 
---
Also perk should not become active when you're 5 seconds away from hitting second state/dying on hook and when the rescuer has BT
---
He looks fun
---
Sounds like me. I have wasted soooo many flashlights on the „two blinds in one game“ challenge, when I equipped the last yellow one I was lucky to get a message from the killer „I farm, ok for you?“. I usually leave the lobby then but that time I said ok if I can have my two flashlight blinds. 
---
Now the same crap starts with the Decisive Light challenge. I felt bad because instead of helping the team I just follow the killer around until he downs someone and then I miss the blind anyway, so I stopped for now. The embarrassing thing is, I play Huntress with controller and can aim pretty well, but flashlights nope, a catastrophe. 
---
I have now decided I‘ll look for someone who wants to practice this with me in KYF. I would really like to be able to do a proper flashlight save, just so that I can, even if I probably won’t do it again in future.
---
I just bought mine for 15 BRL (thats around U$3,30).
---
I had it digital media already.
---
He is good once you learn how to control him better.
---
Still expensive tho.
---
Yeah, He hates the game but he still plays for the money. He literally said that in a video once
---
You have a history of consistently playing scummy killer games though Toy I've seen you brag and relish about your killer bm many a comment around here.
---
You sure you weren't playing it like filth during your challenge attempts?  You have a pretty sordid history with that stuff.
---
I would say both are fairly ability heavy, mostly depends on if you want to see a bunch of vomit or not lol.
---
I MUST LET EVERYONE KNOW WHO I AM
---
Or empathy
---
This was filthy lol
---
I'm a filthy Claudette main because I wanted self-care when I started and saw no reason to switch over to someone else (I don't play much survivor). Most fun killer for me is huntress but I SUCK with her. Landing hatchets and predicting survivor's jukes is incredibly satisfying though. I also really like trapper for a similar reason, it's really satisfying when you correctly predict survivor's movement. I'm unfortunately also not good enough with him to contend with red rank survivors though. Freddy is probably my best killer, he's really straightforward to use and doesn't rely on any mechanical skill. Demogorgon gets an honorable mention too, he's just fun. Map mobility and being able to close gaps mid chase always feels good on a killer lol.
---
Fuck the Entity, I'm pleased!
---
Truly a masterpiece of cinema
---
Glorious
---
You should 100% get the Leatherface DLC to get the perk bbq and chili. It gives you 25% bonus points per hook which you will get pretty much every game. So you basically double your progress using it
---
yep, its a rotation of them, like where the basement, the hatch, the exit gates, the boxes, all totem, killer shacks, even generators. they are all on a random rotation for their locations. nothing is ever the same in every match
---
Yeah just give BVHR ideas good job
---
I saw bring all the fans ninja is not very good anyways and them kids can have some of my moris 😊
---
BIGGEST mind game ever. I APLAUD YOU!

Hey, I'd like to practice too! Are you playing on PC or consoles? If PC, then [here is my Steam page.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ieltyn)
---
The Canadian in me yes Legion for sure!
---
The killer main in me says Legion sucks...
---
The survivor is me says plague is annoying.
---
Welcome to The Twilight Zone
---
It’s just a silly joke because Otz loves loves STBFL but recently he’s had a huge love for All Ears, so basically saying his love for STBFL is over and All Ears is his new love. But of course he still highly enjoys both perks
---
You did a really good job! Always loved that icon.
---
Hah, that's awesome. I've never seen that
---
This is one of the best things I have seen here in awhile. That's so evil.
---
Bipolar ?
---
Thank you so much :) this is the first painting I’ve done of dbd so far and plan to do more.
---
That was so good! What was the chat after the match?
---
Both are equally horrid things
---
I'm a survivor main and I absolutely love this!
---
Again, I don't consider it bad that killers get what they are supposed to when someone DCs, but it's dumb that survivors are crippled without anything to assist them and giving the killer information through bbq or a PGtW hit, that just hurts the survivors even more
---
They're both pretty weak. Legion's power is so incredibly underwhelming, you just smack survivors in your frenzy but never down them and get looped the whole game. It's also so easy for survivors to mend themselves and continue working on the generators together. The only good part about him is his first teachable perk, Discordance. Plague's power is also pretty trash, you just vomit on survivors until they're injured, but about 90% of the time they manage to get to a loop before they become injured. It's also not hard and very fast for survivors to cleanse themselves, and sometimes they don't even cleanse and just keep working on the generators which renders Plague's power as mostly useless, like you can literally use No Mither and a gen rushing perk build against her and she basically has no power. There only good part about Plague's power is the corrupt purge so that you can vomit on survivors, injure and down them, and actually become a threat which makes her better than Legion, but again, it only works when survivors cleanse. Her perks however are VERY nice, especially Infectious Fright. So if I were to choose, I'd say go for Plague
---
It will depend on how many of them are using their mom's credit card, tbh. The company will likely listen to whoever are spending the most on micros to keep them around.
---
These are pretty good, though Killer Catcher seems like it'd be pretty useless
---
Listening to the kids while editing this, kill me please. Took a while since I'm using a phone editor, if I was on/had a PC I'd make some transparent faces from the stuff I made track the 5 kids. It was gonna be doctor, ghostface, bubba, spirit and huntress.
---
Yeah I’ve tried and I feel like it’s slower and sometimes pauses randomly. But I’ve just decided to wiggle slowly and accept I’m most likely taking the hook if picked up.
---
Halo community don't want him either
---
A survivor that knows what they're doing will never get interrupted mid-vault by a shock in a decent loop because the charge time, delay on cast and the awful range without addons makes it not very good.
---
So it's fair for people who aren't as good and just want to try to have fun? Brilliant!
---
in that case there's nothing to do about it, that's just latency and dedicated servers being dedicated servers
---
Coming from r.all I've no idea what's happening but you all seem real excited :)
---
Man I need some advice on the dark sense 4 gens one.
---
And because she's basically an M1 Killer without it
---
Well technically Illfonic killed him lol
---
Give me a copy of that :3
---
How do you get people to fall for that?  After they hear Myers tier up the first time shouldn't they be highly aware that he isn't AFK and GTFO?
---
Almost 100 comments and only one person thought to ask this rather important question.
---
I know that ive just never seen this in over 25 days of in game time
---
I feel like this community won’t give him a chance based on his behavior, he is sort of following the footsteps of Ochido, of course he isn’t as bad as him but it is still the same situation where we have a toxic content creator bringing in toxic players who worship them
---
Idk who he is, but ironically saying that gives anyone the right to shit talk. 
---
Dont even get me started on tru3.
---
I understand your pain but ranking system be like that. Killer population is lower as you climb...almost as if balance favours survivors
---
I read it as they just don’t take any point of damage lol
---
Nothing lmao. I'm pretty sure the survivor just accepted that they screwed up.
---

---
Sadistic motherfricker, but cant they hear the lvl 2 music?
---
Happens to me all the time. I'm a higher killer rank, but pretty much every game I play is a stacked group of survivors much higher rank than me.
---
Yui/pig and ghost face
---
Once you’ve played enough killer in general you’ll be good with any killer you use. Mastery of these killers first depends on your ability to mind game pallet loops and develop a sixth sense on where survivors are hiding. Think about when you lose line of sight as a survivor running a loop and moonwalk as a killer when your chase takes a survivor to that spot.  Once you’re more adept at downing survivors quickly, pgtw becomes infinitely more useful than ruin for slowing down the gens.  For stealth killers in general, I like using discordance because you know there’s more than one survivor at the gen. Especially useful for end game knowing which gen is being pushed hard.
---
Claudette is a beautiful person that we all should cherish. Keep it real and don't let the toxic people tarnish her image for you.
---
Smoke signals seems kinda weak tbh, how about it also reveals the auras of the other survivors?
---
*Illuminati confirmed*
---
I’m usually a survivor main and this is incredible. I would love to play against this as it feels like something new and not the same hum drum bullshit this game has become.
---
found the survivor main
---
Is It tho? It shows no cooldown, and it doesn't work only when someone is hooked there, but also if the hook is empty. So I can imagine it being used in the most central hook of the map, of maybe next to one of the last gen or something like that to check when the killer's there
---
&gt; Sub rank 15 gets put with anyone because there is no one at these ranks, also can these threads start getting banned/removed, the spam is insane
---
What is insane is the fact that a completely new player got queued with one of the highest ranks in the game. This is absolutely not normal.
---
If it were the equivalent of the hook distance one I'd say moderately.
---
The doctor is very proud of his iPhone 4
---
Same here. But I've never seen something as extreme as this.
---
Nea: Bad Touch, BAD TOUCH.
---
“Abusing”.. This community is hilarious sometimes.
---
Leatherface and Plague are incredibly strong with this combo. 
---
Having the extra movement speed while constantly having a power that allows you to insta-down survivors makes you a real threat to even the strongest loopers. 
---
With plague it actually works well in pushing survivors to cleanse allowing you to use your power more often. 
---
For Leatherface It pushes him from being low tier to being a solid high-mid tier killer.
---
It’s called breaking off the chase if they know how to use the loop and going after the weak link.
---
I think whoever beholds it will think you’re a psychopath, but other than that it’s great!
---
I guess. Doesn’t make it less annoying. Lol.
---
Hey all! Xbox-1 player here. Looking for SWF (3 or less, or just anyone to play the game with who is like ~13-16 rank). Gamer tag darkxrainx. Feel free to add me as long as your not an asshole 😂
---
It does.
---
Yeah definitely lol. Thank you though I’m very happy with how it turned out
---
That's good to hear, right when I saw you had her at about 99% I was hoping it would go down like that.
---
I just want to clarify some things cuz it's getting hot in the comments  
---
1- You're right, he didn't killed Fortnite, I haven't expressed myself correctly, I meant to say that during his lives he's really toxic and always calling BS on every bad moves he makes making him a bad influence toward other players. If he gets notorious enough on Dbd, we may have to open another OchiDO case.   
---
2- Yeah the game can be considered toxic, but having the toxicity of Xbox live 2012 is not something we're ready to experiment, it's just gonna be report after report because crybabies think they're being tunneled  
---
3-Sure, an influencer plays the game it means more new players, but do we want a wave of 5000 12 years old to raid(shadow legend) our beloved servers?
---
4-If a big streamer gets a lot of views, he can change the game. We all remember the '[stream sniping](https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/11/21/ninja-reports-player-stream-sniping-epic-games-ban/)' event right? Let's say this gets to a mod's ears and he pressure them to change it so it's not possible anymore, do we really want someone with this little jugement as a representent?  
---
5- He is a bad influencer.

Kudos to OP, this is great.
---
If it's an unsafe pallet then yeah you're screwed. But there are enough safe pallets on most maps then it doesn't matter if you throw pallets early.
---
Well, the goal is to just do gens and have no killer interaction so running stealth perks and detection perks will help. You can do Spine Chill, Iron Will, flex, Dark Sense with a toolbox. Ignore totems, chests, and saving teammates. About the killer at all costs so that the killer chases them instead of you so you can get the gen done. You also don't need to 0-100% the gen... Just be working on it when it finishes. SWF can help since they can 99 the gen for you.
---
Stupid, totally luck-based perk that is also 100% necessary to maintain the pace of the game
---
Lmfao this was amazing
---
I have a question; when are the rank resets?
---
Old Freddy. I used to love the mind games during the dream transition and being able to get that first hit 95% of the time for free was awesome. Built in deer stalker and god tier tracking in the dream world. Yes he was end game weak but my matches with him rarely made it that far. Can I have an add on for old Freddy please? ;sadface;
---
That was really satisfying :D
---
13th of every month
---
If they disgrace my main and/or Huntress I'm going to beat them to death and default dance over their dead bodies
---
On tge contrary, most people would rather not be injured the entire game from start to finish.
---
btw this is what my huntress looks in game thus why she has two outfits mixed in this drawing lol
---
Even god pallet isn't safe from Ninja...what has the world come to?
---
Yes I know what No Mither does.
---
I second this.
---
That's reasonable,  but not remotely time efficient. 
---
If they're working on gens, you just don't have time for that.
---
I love her
---
No offence but that pallet drop at the start made me want to kill myself
---
I'd love this
---
What? How? Hes getting downvoted because he makes it personal when a survivor is trying to outplay him, and play the game. It doesnt get more salty then that. Theres NEVER any reason to take something in a game personally.
---
Why?
---
and she loves you!! :3
---
That pose.....im so weak rn.
---
:3
---
That’s such an easy pallet for killers,  it gonna mention how you wasted it though Because it’s on Hawkins
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
It was a huge waste
---
Some people just don't know how to play pallets without bloodlust I guess. Probably the same type of person that complains about genrushing.
---
I like the way your work it, yes diggity .
---
that chainsaw gets me excited.
---
This is why I come here. Well done.
---
Make that 5 people, look around a little.

No that was a pretty good use of an unsafe pallet.
---
Tip: don't be a douche when someone tries to help.
---
I feel like Ninja and OhPedo shoukd just be rank locked together. Constantly pissing each other off.
---
Yeah Ik but I’m just explaining why he would think that
---
Welcome to The Hookers!
---
I think the general consensus is you go for the rescue, if you get seen (because the killer is camping) you run, and if the killer chases you, someone else goes and rescues. Not too hard to coordinate with no voice chat, though with voice chat you also have the option of telling your team to get their ass to the hook
---
Are these the same people that in my experience let me die on first hook, not repairing a gen or running the killer. Just near enough to him they’re spooked. When I’m
---
Not even being camped. 
---
My limited personal experience says take self care as I can’t trust some survivors, but I can trust myself. 
---
Plus honestly dude she’s my first survivor that has reached 40. As I level others I might come to agree with you. But for now I prefer self care.
---
🤡
---
People laugh in my face and are toxic anyways.... so might as well run self care...
---
I had someone tell me I’m an asshole for putting trapper traps in the grass. Yes because let’s not use our power anymore please
---
When matchmaking, you go 4 v 1. The last spot, last two spots or three spots will be filled by random players.
---
As a survivor main who plays a frequent amount of killer, imma go ahead and say god loops are counter-able xD
---
I don’t personally watch him but some of my friends do. Whatever gets them more in to dbd is okay with me.
---
Thank you for your opinion, but it is utterly preposterous.
---
I watched this video with my mouth dropped wide open, my jaw hurts, I am in disbelief
---
Agreed xD
---
Sure, but he also admits its his own fault and he does after all end up losing the game for camping. Sometimes thats the sacrifice that comes with being a survivor, if the killer camps you, you accept that you are just buying time occupying them and the other survivors cut their losses and do gens. 
---
If more survivors would learn that you dont rush a camped survivor and instead use the time they have on the hook to get gens done, killers would mostly stop camping. I play both sides and its the stupidest thing that somehow survivors will still drop everything to run into the killers arms just to feel like they are trying to help. Often times if you just keep doing gens, the killer will think no one is coming to rescue and leave, and then you can get the save.
---
“Nan—“ *vomits violently*
---
You best believe I switch to her if I see a lobby with 3+ medkits though.
---
Slowed M1 killer in exchange for instadowns and making their items all but useless? I'll take it.
---
A Martyr bonus would be nice.
---
Haven’t found randomers reliable enough compared to self care.
---
isn't that changing with the upcoming rework though?
---
Just wanted to get my last stun for the archive challenge, was just to be sure i got it
---
Do we need to talk to the random player?
---
Me either, since they got rid of the rank 20 glitch.
---
"That's the evilest thing I can imagine."
---
You should really take memes less seriously.
---
Relevant flair.

---
Wait... did you ever watch ninja playing h1? Everyone who ever knew about him from his halo or h1 days knew he was terrible lmao.
---
I dont think you want to tell the killer where youre hiding :D
---
Dead by daylight cost money and is mature... I think we don't have to worry about all the 7 year olds.
---
Green/low purple is the peak of dbd in my opinion, for both sides
---
Yellow and brown is just new/not good players
---
And red is god loopers/4 man swf and killers that are incredibly good
---
Green/purple seems to be the best mix of both and gives me my most enjoyable games
---
I didn't know he played h1 honestly. I watched him play a few fortnite games out of curiousity, to see what kind of person he was. I was disgusted.
---
I’m pleased with this video, so I’m better than the entity
---
What is the name of the song in this video?
---
My killer is rank 8 and I only get red ranks.
---
there's a pregame chat but in general communicating is done with gestures in game. the amount of people you have doesn't matter as the matchmaking will fill in any gaps you have. You can't queue with 5 fyi. 4 is max for survivors and killers queue separate.
---
I like to think she's making a yo momma joke whenever she gets bapped by a pallet
---
He changed his screen name sometime between h1 and fortnite if I remember properly, theres plenty clips of him floating around with him screaming at kids.
---
yeah but what if the random player is a survivor and one of my friends is the killer?
---
And then you wake up
---
Someone should do an expose on this blue haired pimple of a human.
---
Good to hear
---
I've found my people xD
---
Totally deserved haha.
---
If you've seen *You're next* it's a more comedic version of that.
---
Both are great movies if you haven't.
---
Leatherface ?😅
---
What about ghostface that man has scared me a shitload of times when he grabs me or I turn around and he's just standing there or peeking to stalk. The amount of times I'm playing with friends and we are working on a gen and the panic in saying it's a ghost face.
---
You have my bow.
---
There definitely have been, people just didnt care. As much as I dont care for the man, I would say that ninja overall has done more good than bad for gaming as a whole. 
---
Hes ability to hit the mainstream have big streamers a lot more options and in the corporate world, breaking the glass was all they really needed. It was something shroud never could because he was too deep into the internet culture... unlike ninja who is super family friendly.
---
The light is a map add-on. It's the one that says it lets you mark things.
---
Honestly I believe discordance is a better perk than Infectious fright. Iron maiden is good to get for huntress too.
---
"WE have a YouTube channel...."
---
I start to understand why people call him ''pure evil''
---
I just don't think we see eye to eye, here.
---
You get what you fucking deserve
---
There is no random matchmaking, if you tag as survivor you will play survivor so don't worry
---
you'd think so, but with enough games played you should be able to get good footage anyway.
---
If you looked through my post history you would see I have said this in the past. If you're gonna lie, at least make it believable
---
Okay. First off, Jacket isn't a  psychopath, he's a sociopath. This fact is often attributed to *Payday 2* with Jacket's perk deck being called Sociopath and the FBI Files say "*All we really know is that he is dangerously psychotic - a sociopath.*" Now, besides that, the *Hotline Miami series* can be considered Horror adjacent. Hell, Dead Meat considers Jurrasic Park horror enough to get Kill Counts on them, so I'm sure HM would fit in that category. And who said that all the Killers had to be slashers? All of the Killers are meant to represent some aspect of the Horror Genre. Jacket is a human Terminator. Borderline Emotionless, Wide variety of weapons, intimidating look even if it's just mundane clothing, etc. I think he'd fit.
---
"Family friendly". There, fixed it. And while I agree with you there, I think the problem with the Ninja expose stuff is that it's hard to find. I didn't know people had already done that. What we really have to ask is: would exposing him as an asshole irl going to damage our rep as gamers?
---
Forever Freddy’s gonna enjoy this influx...
---
So... Exactly the same thing as before right ?
---
I'm impressed you put some much effort into replying to a month old comment that I had completely forgot about. Kudos.
---
I've got like maybe 5 hours played and I dunno what's actually going on but the end was kinda funny I guess.
---
You. I like you.
---
That was an extremely high quality shitpost. I'm goddamn inspired.
---
At least some Babylonian God isn't going to start tearing up the city...
---
Like I said, there was a huge takedown effort against ninja when he passed shroud on twitch... and no one really cared. At this point, hes on mixer, which I think was a terrible move but the money must have been real fucking massive. Anyways, hes not as pervasive in the culture now because of it... hes in a self imposed exile of sorts. Most people dont care that much anymore tbh.
---
Thanks :)
---
why? I'm just standing haha
---
No. It's a standalone game. It might just be inspired
---
Haha, I think he shot his own foot when he refused to play with women. Notice he's since played with some women, and tried a collab with Mark Hamill.
---

---
$40 for base game and 3 dlc isn’t great considering how often it’s all on sale. I got a digital ps4 copy and3 FDIC’s packs for $27 last week.
---
Babysitter is the only plausibly usable perk simply because of the utility of the scratch marks.
---
You’re arguing for the opposite logic. What you’re suggesting is that the killer must give the hatch. You’re saying the other player had an obligation to play a certain way.
---

I'm not making up numbers, at least not what I've encountered. I probably should've clarified that 90% of **my** games are affected, which prevents me from moving anywhere up or down the ladder
---
Thanks. I didn't know there wasn't ingame voice chat... so if we talk in discord is that bad? I read that is unfair for the killer
---
His none chainsaw noises aren't global tho.
---
[Gone, reduced to atoms](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

I should've clarified, 90% of **my** matches end in a rank update error. Maybe I'm just unlucky, but it doesn't change the fact that this is an obnoxious bug that should be looked into
---
When I run a Hex gambler I put NOED, DEVOUR, RUIN, and Haunted. That way, if Devour and Ruin go before the endgame I still have some insurance lmao.

Sure, but camping is the worst thing is this game. Thats why the devs are trying to actively discourage people from doing it, and finding new ways to remove it (and players downvote people who do it). In my opinion, having the mindset that you should just accept that your getting camped is wrong, because it could discourage that player from ever playing again, its just so incredibly frustrating to go against. It may not be fun for killer to do, but its much worse as a survivor to play against.
---
That's a new one.

Do not underestimate. Children become very skilled in their game of choice.

Here's what happened: she clicked with her flashlight towards me, but I ignored her. Caught her a moment later while Haunted Ground was active. She got hooked. When she was unhooked, I teleported back towards the hook and coincidentally appeared right in front of where she was running to. I mori'd her. 
---
It was beautiful.
---
How many levels did you have to grind to start getting Bill perks on a character?
---
Easily the best thing I've seen on this subreddit.

Fully agree! I think cheeky, silly builds or playstyles are just plain fun :)

Focusing weak survivors doesn't make you a good killer.
---
Blood lust 43 later....
---
Killer queues at low ranks take around 5-15 minutes, I would say. Lots of variation (I only play killer for dailys) 
---
As a rank 8 survivor right now, it’s around a 30 second to 5 minute wait time. It really just depends on the time of day I feel like
---
It’s very rare
---
I wish I could sell passes to join the anti-Ninja circlejerk, I’d make a lot of money.
---
They weren't teabagging, they were having a seizure.
---
I LOVE when they're teasing you and they get too close. Totally satisfying when you're able to down them.
---
Wait until she meets the nurse
---
I feel like Camaraderie should pause the hook timer for both hook states while the Killer is within 16 meters. 
---
It'd still be mostly trash since even a camping Killer could see the paused timer and know to just leave (or simply sit outside the 16 meter range), but it'd be infinitely more useful than pausing the struggle timer when a Survivor is near and it would synergize with Kindred nicely.
---
I don't know about Babysitter, but it should be reworked; it's only helpful against tunneling Killers and the aura reveal gives non-tunnelly Killers free information on you. Heck, even tunneling Killers that the denial of scratchmarks might help with can just target you now.
---
Second Wind should trigger from safe unhooks and activate when you recover from the dying state as well as when you are unhooked. Still niche, but much more versatile without, IMO, being broken.
---
No, its fine. I know the perks, I just can't go onto DbD wiki at work. Thank you!

Everytime I've ckmplained about this people told me to run kindred. I've started running it and literally nothing has changed. Oof.
---
Shame as people I’ve played alongside don’t seem to realise that being on hook means “UNHOOK ME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD” and instead they’re not doing a gen, or lead the killer they’re just running around.  Close enough to the killer to hear the heartbeat but far enough away that the killer isn’t behind them.

---
Is that transformers 3 soundtrack?
---
Sure, the problem is most people won’t if they don’t see you. Kindred doesn’t really “replace” self care in that way. It’s a very strong perk to have and I run it on almost all my survivors
---
Out of curiosity how did you make them look like real perks? 
---
Did you photoshop them yourself?

These are really interesting! Cultural Exchange I see the most trouble with depending on what perks get exchanged but it's still very cool, adds an element or risk and RNG i like!

Second wind is a time saving perk that encourages helping others. You get off the hook, you start healing and you can start working on a generator instead of healing. If you need to, you can use Dead Hard to evade the killer long enough to get healed, giving you another hit. If someone has borrowed time equipped, that’s 2 free hits before you either escape or go down. Babysitter can help out with tunneling killers, but first you have to break their line of sight with the other survivor for it to be actually useful
---
If ppl don't DC of course
---
Fair fair
---
That tbagging Adam kill was so satisfying. &lt;3
---
Camraderie can be super clutch one out of a hundred games I guess? 
---
IMO it should also pause hook timers for other people if you're within 16 meters of them, but I guess the walkie-talkies are just one-way lol.
---
it's swf(survive with friends) and it's pretty well accepted at this point. You're fine.
---
Play normally for a few minutes. Once you reach T2, play for a while more (that’s actually important for convincing), and then just stop.
---
They’ll avoid you at first, just be patient, wait and don’t move. It’s most likely that first one person may come, but he’ll be ready to run to the pallet any minute, so don’t actually tier up even while having the chance. Continue waiting unless there are at least three of them running around you. 
---
And only once you see they are calm and not on their guard, do it.
---
I've been messaging survivors post game wishing them merry christmas based on the killer I played, ie: Clown, Merry Coughmas, Myers, Merry Stalkmas, Plague, Merry Pukemas. It normally gets a giggle. I do the same to a killer post game too regardless of whether I won or lost. I like to keep it friendly 🤗 (console)

Hey just an FYI I'd delete Tap and install it through APKPure instead. Tap is really really unsafe.

RIP in copyright hell
---
Because I think both roles can be toxic, I'm a survivor main.
---
Got a game on Gas Heaven with my brown addons Trapper. Of course the Survivors have to teabag and click their flashlights at the gate.
---
The fact you used “we” probably.
---
Me when I hear the saw: "Oh thank the fuck Christ it's not another Ghostface/Freddy..."
---
Idk man. Puppers said we were wholesome for the most part 😤
---
I never said killer must give hatch, but why not sometimes? And as survivor in the same way, why not be nice sometimes if it doesn't change the outcome of your game AT ALL.
---
You really sound like a joy to be around.
---
Sub 17 here, on PC, Pacific timezone evenings I get in lobby:
---
* Survivor: consistent &lt;60 seconds
---
* Killer: 5-7minutes
---
I've been timing it for the last month. Seems like there is an over abundance of Killer in the potato fields.
---
I’ve never played Friday the 13th, maybe I’ll check it out. It’s a shame because I don’t want to be bashing DBD, I like the idea a lot, but I’ve never had a game frustrate me more and feel like I get punished for trying to be helpful and a team player. And I’ve played 2k+ hours of csgo, so I consider my mind pretty trained when it comes to not letting the game get to your head. Something about this game.
---
He's scary too ngl I remember that one reddit post, a Laurie doing a Gen in a triple I and from out of nowhere a Ghostface peeks around the corner exactly left of the spot she's doing the Gen on and it's was on Ormond resort you couldn't even see the mask lmao. I think it was called "I need a new pair of underwear"
---
And Myers is Hella scary in Lery's and Hawkins (jumpscare myers)
---
STONKS!
---
Perk that shows you where the hatch will spawn.
---
glorious
---
Yep. That map used to be amazing when you could abuse Lithe, Quick and Quiet and Dance With Me on certain windows. Nowadays almost every window vaults has an open door behind it so it's Impossible to break LOS for more than like 1 second. :/
---
There are two situations here:
---
You doing something to be nice.
---
You expecting someone else do something to be nice because you are nice.
---
They are not the same. We were talking about the survivor not giving a four hook in the basement right? Or something similar.
---
Look at the perspective you are coming from. You can’t tell someone else they should “be nice.” That is you telling them how to play. Especially since the entire purpose is to not get hooked and die.
---
The shit that people give the devs way too much slack for is why it pisses me off so much. Last year the other game i mentioned has a smaller team than dbd and still did way more for their game before saying "see y'all in 2020, holiday break time."
---
This needs more visibility. It will impact the ability of the game to retain new players if it continues.

On topic:
---
**Perk 1** - Range of aura reading needs to be increased, and as it is it's overly conditional. Might be mildly useful with Inner Strength but even then it's underwhelming and is essentially just a worse version of Detective's Hunch (which is already a bad perk imo.)
---
**Perk 2** - An interesting concept for a detection perk. A more direct way to keep track of points of interest. Thing is that I don't know how much better it is than the likes of Alert.
---
**Perk 3** - Adorable idea. Would be abused to shit. Comments already pointing out how many people would run No Mither + Babysitter + Object of Obsession and just troll their teammates.
---
Its placed down by pressing the secondary action button while the map is being used.  (Fully charged and active. Not just in your hand.) 
---
It will stay where you marked it until you place another.
---
Whick makes the mainly a personal issue and not game wide.  I can't tell if you're just back tracking now you got called out or if it was an honest mistake either way it's not a huge issue and you should probably message support.
---
it's better if you play with other people, but if you like playing solo that's fine too
---
I took this photo at a comic Con in blue lake. The background is on a slope so I had a hard time to turn around. The mask blocking my vision didn't help 😁 thank your for your compliment :)
---
Shame on me for even believing I could have that
---
Thats a smurf huntress.b
---
you're welcome, I'm sure it took a lot of time and effort to make that, don't ever let others discourage you from something that you worked hard on and enjoy doing. fuck em
---
Custom games do not award bloodpoints. They'll still be there, but only as a scoring mechanism, they cant actually be used as upgrade points.
---
I once had a survivor team humping the Matt Walker window on Abbatoir so hard that I eventually caught 3 of them there trying to vault it and downed one off that because they were all clogged up near it.
---
It's a little silly.
---
Doesn't award BP. You could mindlessly farm yourself to P3 50 on everybody.
---
It works well enough, but you usually want the host to be the killer. Otherwise, there are a handful of things that'll mess up for the killer.
---
They've changed the lightning since those screen shots were taken
---
Nancy is my survivor main cause I'm a Stranger Things fan, and my killer main is The Pig. Love that oinkers &lt;333
---
Ninja himself is a good guy, unfortunately for him, his fan-base are children.
---
But the sound is different
---
Finding the clothing took about a week. Putting it together was messy. I had to wear the sweater to get the brown paint in the right places and had help from my mom to make the skirt. I also needed her help to cut the sweater pants, and skirt in certain places. This was actually the first cosplay I worked on and had to make other then my Clementine cosplay.
---
um...
---
^it’s ^not
---
I know there was a lighting glitch before on the Pig’s map, making it almost impossible to see anything at all. Thought it was fixed but I guess not.
---
Nurse and Freddy: Are we a joke to you?
---
Did he actually start playing DBD
---
Babysitter is amazingly helpful if youre the altruistic type. Especially if youre SWF, you can communicate where the killer is and is going. At rank 3, it is still 4 seconds of aura revelation but a whopping 8 seconds for your teammate to not leave scratchmarks. It works really well with "Were gonna live forever" for BP farming.
---
Not really fun for the survivors in this case. Just boring.
---
*skilled huntress*
---
well, I think it's great 😊
---
Gas Heaven isn't too bad with Trapper. I go straight to the station and check the strength of the building, and make sure to get traps set up near potential exits ASAP. Of course you can get a super strong map with no doors in the station and 6 pallets in the center plus God bus but it's not super common.
---
I might get downvoted for this but I'm still subbed to Ninja on YT. My girlfriend and I recently started playinf fortnite again with the coming of Chapter 2. It's a lot of fun for us and it's a good way to spend time together. At night we'll watch YT together, but we saw Ninja posting dead by daylight videos. I've always seen dbd and the concept really intrigued me, it was $7 on steam so I decided to pull the trigger. My first game I escaped at the last second and I've been hooked ever since. I've been looking into alot of other YT'ers for dbd like noob and pain relief. Ninja has some adult fanbase, so hopefully the good ones come and stay!
---
This is one of the best things I have ever watched
---
Wow, these are... actually incredible! You're very creative and resourceful, not to mention you picked parts of Native American culture so perfectly. Nice job!
---
&gt; P3 50
---
What does it mean?
---
Start running Franklin demise. Trust me it feels really good to knock shit out of those peoples hands
---
This. It can be an incredibly strong perk, providing your in a SWF with at least one other. That’ll guarantee your heal state, meaning you get a free heal and don’t have to waste time on SC
---
Most people can't tell the difference.
---
"Noed helps you when you lose the game and adrenaline helps you when you win"
---
That survivor doesnt look like they were about to win.
---
This is fucking beautiful. As a survivor I wouldn’t even be mad
---
Because even that time destroying ruin is 15 seconds wasted, and they reveal their location by doing it.
---
It's not as bad at red ranks and you kinda learn to live with it.
---
The fact that no Laurie’s fell for it is just as unsatisfactory as the Halloween franchise itself not letting Michael kill her yet
---
I would say all the killers are pretty fun to play against and as, except for plague and legion. But otherwise, the killers playstyle is far more important on how fun the match is than the killer they picked.
---
Expected her to say “Bazinga”, anyway not disappointed
---
And I told u if a new player gets many players bad then they get why tunneling is needed sometimes
---
Ur missing the point as much as u want to say I am
---
Hey, I was also a child before!
---
When you get to prestige level three and level 50
---
It's not even worth having for nothing
---
It does, though. If the killer wants to counter it, they will just sit there and wait for you to do something. 2 survivors are already wasting their time (one hooked, one waiting to unhook), so the team is 50% less efficient in getting gens done. Hook tech is very easy to counter.
---
Is it really that bad?
---
Looks like someone caught you doing something you shouldn't.
---
Lmao racism can’t be a joke in any context? What are you, the thought police? Fuck off dude “kEeP dEfEnDiNg rAcIsM aNd GeT bAnNeD”
---
N-NANI
---
I'd say so. It's really clunky, game mechanics aren't that good and it seems like Jason always has the upper hand.
---
If you want a game like this, go for dead by daylight
---
:'(
---
When you get to level 50 on a character (that's the 50 part) you have the opportunity to prestige a character (that's the P part) once, which gets you a special piece of bloody stuff to wear and wipes out all your perks and items on that character, starting you from level 1 again. You're at prestige 1, level 1 (P1 1).
---
Then you pour bloodpoints into the character and get to prestige 1, level 50 (P1 50). You then have the option to prestige again, becoming prestige 2, level 1 (P2 1). Level up to P2 50. Then prestige again, get to level 50 again, and you're at P3 50. This is currently the highest prestige and level we can attain.
---
It gets you some bloody clothing to wear, which is nice on some characters, since it blends in a little better in a lot of maps. But beyond that, there's really no reason to do it unless you're just sitting on a million bloodpoints. Prestiging does wipe out your perks and items, so it has to be used carefully, and you'll need to make sure you've got at least one character left with decent perks.
---
Mostly, it's not worth prestiging until you're almost bored with the game.
---
It kinda does now that you mentioned it 😁
---
Sorry I live under a rock but did he really? I'm too lazy to search it up.
---
That's true, but this has been a thing since before these challenges came about. Survivors had this mentality for a long time now. Also, that's one of, if not the only, challenge they can know that you're trying to do and actively stop you from doing for sure with 1 person disconnecting so it's really not a big deal if you DC overall as most killers aren't trying to do that challenge at any one point. The rest of the challenges can still be done with a DC or 2 later in the game.
---
What perks/addons do you use for the doc build?
---
The killer can’t be in a call with survivors unless it is a custom kill your friends lobby. In that case there are no ransoms and only the people you invite so it could be a three v one. It doesn’t matter though because you don’t rank or get bloodpoint from kill your friends. You can also use any perks and add one even ones you don’t have unlocked in the normal game.
---
Cowabungs it is.
---
Its almost as if hes new to the gams, man imagine it being bad that more people play our game smh my bad forgot fortnite bad
---
I almost put this at the bottom
---
well,in that case you are forcing the killer to facecamp and that's still not very nice imo
---
Playing against personally for me;
---
A - Pig, Nightmare, Oni, Demogorgon, Hillbilly, Huntress, Shape
---
B - Plague, Legion, Ghostface, Leatherface, Wraith, Doctor 
---
C - Clown, Trapper
---
D - Spirit, Nurse, Hag
---
Clown using brutal strength, overcharge, and a Haddonfield offering with no add-ons
---
He's not just the clown he's the entire circus.
---
?
---
Yes so you know how it is
---
Welcome to tryhard unfun land thank u for bringing your hag
---
Go fuck yourself, you racist piece of shit :D
---
more toxic people who think they're good when they're actually god-awful yes
---
To be fair you're really far from that dude's target audience.
---
A smurf with all that unlocked? X doubt
---
Do you main Hag? What perks?
---
You literally don't get it. So let's put it in simple terms.
---
"If people don't enjoy the initial experience... they will fuck off."
---
Less players... longer queues for killers so the tunneling of new players only truly screws over killers in the long run. 👍
---
Yeah I'd be assuming it's a bug. In fact I could swear that used to be a bug but I'm probably misremembering things
---
It's fine as long as you have a stable connection.
---
Just dodge lobbies with higher than 150 ping and the fps will be pretty consistent.
---
Noted. I pretty much installed it just to get DBD and removed it anyways.
---
Does he have any DIY videos lmao
---
I believe that both Calm add-ons
---
Unrevering Presence, Overcharge, Distressing and Hex: Huntress Lullaby.
---
It makes your terror radius big a fuck while in Treatment mode, Overcharge makes that after you break Gen, the skill check will appear anywhere on the screen and Lullaby makes that (when all tokens are gained) no sound notification before skill check. Basically keep them all in Tier III Madness
---
“You disagree with my opinion, therefore you are racist piece of shit.”
---
Anything and everything can be funny, get over yourself. Paying someone to hold up a sign that says “Kill all Jews - Subscribe to keemstar” is fucking hilarious. Just because you don’t understand satire doesn’t make me racist.
---
Muy épico señor
---
I'd get the fuck off that elevator if I was you xD
---
It's a bit of a slog through the lower ranks sometimes, but as you progress, you'll see less and less DC'ing. Sometimes you see it at more advanced ranks, but most of the games I play in purple or red have people who at least stick around through the entire game.
---
mate you are the one missing the point here yall argument that "tunneling is bad and makes new players mad" is dumb bc it is so fucking close sounding the the casual survivor tears that we hear daily.
---
I offer you this play the fucking game and stop bitching about how people play bc you can play just as fucking dirty
---
Chainsaw my exit gates daddy Billy!!
---
If you hate keys so much just bring Franklin's
---
Thanks.
---
I told you to go fuck yourself. Listen to your elder or I'll send you to bed with no supper young man! Don't make me take off my belt.
---
Nah, you’re good. Enjoy your ban tho bud.
---
I feel like she’s cussing you every time you stun her
---
You'd think that after Myers reaches Tier 2, the Survivors would have an idea as to what you're doing.  It's no ones fault but their own for poking the bear
---
My leg!
---
Glad to hear it! This game can be tough to start, I'd definitely watch some videos on who to level first in order to start getting the teachables you want as soon as possible. For more educational type videos I'd definitely recommend people like Ussylis for the survivor side (probably one of, if not the best survivors I've seen), he has a few good tutorials out, and Scott Jund for the killer side, who also some great videos about how to interact in chase as both killer and survivor. In general I'd say just remember that there is always another person behind the name on the screen.
---
It's like in the start of the game where you get 3 gens done and nobody has been hit and never heard a Terror Radius, You'd have an idea on who it is and what they are doing
---
They can just run stealth builds then, or pick it back up. That doesn't fix the problem
---
Side Rant: Its the same problem with Moris, both sides play well, maybe Ruin fell early and gens are going a bit quicker, and then the killer has a Mori, instantly making anything else going to happen in the rest of the match unfun, because if you’ve been hooked once and you get downed again, you’re just dead, maybe you had DS, or their was someone around the corner and they had a flash light, or you were on a pallet, maybe last gen was almost done and you had adrenaline. It doesn’t matter because you’re just dead, and nothing can be done to stop it. It is the most unfun thing to play against as survivor. I would rather be face camped by a leatherface in the basement on Badham.
---
I realize this now. 
---
If it needs to be taken down because of this, then I trust the moderators will do so. But I honestly wasn’t out to shame anyone, and you really gotta work to see them. But I’ll take it down if it does end up offending somebody. 🤷‍♀️
---
It’s not an amount of levels, you can get it at any level. It’s like getting a teachable from another character on pc, you can get it at any time. I just got self care on my Dwight and he’s only level 31, so it depends.
---
If I was that Yui that jogged over to him and got immediately grabbed as he hit T3 I would've pissed myself
---
The addon is fine as is, if anything it should probably be added to her basekit. Would give survivors an actual reason to cleanse and let the plague actually use her main power. And before you say oh thats crazy its an "ultra-rare" they fucking did the exact same thing with demo and his was an ultra-rare too.
---
We really need something where u pip when u keep the killer busy the whole game I only get 0 or -1
---
Well that's a darn shame. The current game looks very bland compared to the screenshots.
---
Of course. I wholeheartedly agree. But because it is a strategy that exists, albeit a shitty one, people will use it, and you have to plan for it. I never said I think camping is okay.
---
Never ever trusting an AFK Myers ever again
---
Hes new to the game, he doesnt understand it like the people who have 1k hours, he didnt do anything bad besides fuck around and you guys act like no ones done that shit. Look at our community already
---
Aw man
---
This is fucking amazing post.
---
squishy
---
“Cultures within the overhang of that one culture” =\= using tired stereotypes like dream catchers and smoke signals. Sure there are tenets that many nations share in terms of beliefs, origin stories, and ceremonies, but that doesn’t make these specific perks less corny and tokenistic in their choice of symbols.
---
I also love that I am getting downvoted for providing an Indigenous perspective on this. Bless.
---
Its ridiculous to have to lose a perk slot to counter something that simply shouldn’t be in the game. Plus a key or any item can always just be picked back up, and then its back to main problem of how broken it is.
---
Derank/ smurf. That's definitely not a rank 18 with all that unlocked
---
doesn't excuse being toxic lol
---
Purposely being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole is toxic, it's as simple as that. I don't "expect" any player to be nice or non-toxic but I'll call them out on it. I don't think toxic players should be banned but I'd still call you toxic if you played like that in a match against me. So it's actually nothing like the lawmakers compelling speech like you mentioned. Freedom of speech does not equal freedom from consequences. Please don't turn this into a political argument though.
---
His gameplay is a new player, yes, but this post mainly refers to just how fucking toxic and horrible his personality is to the killer and his opponents when he still plays horribly. All that does is cause the army of little kids that follow him to start rewarding shit gameplay and toxic behaviour because "NiNjA DiD iT"
---
The thing is do you DC when you get dragged to the basement?
---
You cannot derank past rank 15 unless you haven’t played for several resets (and that got changed so it’s impossible now).
---
&gt; “gG Ez bAbY kIlLeR! uNiNsTaLl sO I cAn HaVE a ChAlLeNgE.”

---
LMFAOOOOO
---
I’d rather have a blenddette in a bush then anyone with a key. I just want keys to be removed or to lose the ability to open trap door.
---
Surviving is not being an asshole. Running to the corner is not being an asshole. The entire point of the game is to prevent the other player from completing their objectives.
---
kill them all
---
It looks fantastic!
---
It's a lot more like Alert, but unfortunately more limited and requires wasting time to set up. Still a cool idea though!
---
If the devs decided it was an issue then there wouldn’t be a hit box on a hooked survivor to begin with. This isn’t new you used to be able to do this previously a long time ago and it was deemed fair. The thing that make it not possible previously is all the issues with collision and prioritization lately. I can be body blocking and taking a hit for someone, only for the killer to swing through my body/hitbox and hit the person I’m protecting. 
---
This isn’t unfair. Just don’t be an idiot and either wait for the grab or wait for the unhook. If the killer falls for it that’s on them. It makes no sense to swing through a hit box in order to hit a different one.
---
hehehe
---
i'm an afk santa clown right now. yes its still christmas. ever hear of 12 days of christmas? :D
---
My favorite part of a game I played last night was opening the game, running back to unhook the last survivor, only for the said survivor to sandbag me and get me hooked while he escaped.
---
No. He’s the Japanese Koolaid Man.
---
Thanks for the tips!! I’ll definitely check out that Survivor guide I’m maining Jake Park right now!
---
Purge of Claudettes achievement,  that made me smile.
---
Its so rare for me to get less then two Claudettes in a match.
---
I don’t get it what happened?
---
Same could be said about Noob3 , kids that follow him will do toxic shit because "no0b3 dId iT" you didnt even watch him play, youre acting more of a 9 year old than his viewers, its sad
---
Na, that was meant as a reply to someone who said to just use Franklin's
---
Game is all about choices, people choose perks, items and add ons that all alter the game in different ways.
---
Keys only work when the hatch spawns and then they need to find it.  If they are looking for the hatch they are not doing gens.  If the hatch has spawned you have already won the game IMO.  I'd rather a key over a tool box, tool boxes help them win.  Keys go un-used most times.  Half the time I could use the key I get out thru the door.
---
Same with Noed, wasted perk until end game...if you lasted that long you won.  Don't be stupid and get out.  Or cleans totems, that's why they are there.
---
Adrenaline, hope....end game perks, yup it sucks as the killer when these go off.  But honestly if they go off you already lost.
---
Everyone can't be happy with everything.  Be happy isn't a good game and a lot of ppl play it.  You don't need to pay much to play and you can unlock almost everything with $$$
---
Stalk then kill
---
He got into Fortnite while it was in its infancy and was able to become the most important influencer of the game at one point, that's why he had an impact. This game already has better stablished streamers like Otz, Paulie, Tru3, Tofu, etc. Also, he doesn't have as much control over the devs as he had in Fortnite where he'd straight up ban people if he pleased. He's not gonna have as much of an impact as in Fortnite, but he'll have some if he picks up the game seriously.
---
Honestly? As someone who played it pretty heavily back at launch, it's a better game than Dead by Daylight, but it's ruined by incompetent devs.
---
Killer played survivor and saved bloodpoints. Pooled all bloodpoints into Killer. Boom. Full set of high tier perks/items
---
This exact thing happened to my friend!!! We were against a Spirit on Yamaoka and he was suddenly unable to move. Everyone, including our killer, was desperately trying to free him but eventually the Spirit just let everyone escape and my friend decided that since the killer was such a good sport during all this that he would be the one to take the loss and DC. A very annoying glitch, but kind of funny. 
---
You can look at my profile for a video of it if you want
---
I like painreliver a lot
---
I did watch him play though? That's how I know what happened in the videos?

If you play then right people will still dc because of how annoying you can be and that is beautiful

I remember getting really cocky one match and doing this. The killer (spirit) appeared out of nowhere and mori'd me. 
---
Never again lmao.

Meanwhile I've been getting tunneled off the hook all night long :')
---
Reminds me of Scream’s Cousin Holler
---
I would love to help you but I can't! He'll never get to red ranks so I'll never get a chance to even see him (but if I depip enough I'll gladly facecamp/sandbag him :3)
---
Mate, sorry but I don’t understand you at all here. Look I’ve had to explain myself almost 4 times now. If my explanations can’t explain my reasoning then it’s obvious you and I have different view points on the perks. It’s better to agree to disagree because I ain’t explaining myself another time. Just understand that not everyone judges a perks tier level on whether you “loose” or “win” but more it’s effectiveness and resourcefulness, even if the perks are activated in the endgame of a trial.

u could probably contact BHVR support and ask them for a refund

Perks: BBQ, Nurses, Ruin, and whispers are always good. Sometimes I run survaliance as well because survivors hide a lot from nurse because it’s a pretty good counter and survailence can help track which gens they are on.   For add ons I say wait to use any blink extension perks so you get used to her power and plaid flannel is always good for beginning nurses

Wow I'ma use this

Do they not clue in that you are not afk after tier 2 music? lol

Ploy number 2 is evil as fuck tho.

Asshole

As someone who basically stays at red ranks, they’re not my problem 😂

Fredster, PC, I'm looking for people to help me practice Doc's shock ability in KYF and maybe even do a few casual matches in KYF. I wouldn't be against going into a SWF after, either, but I'm mostly looking for the first part.
---
I’m so glad to see this comment, because I was getting tired of listening to people bash on the guy for trying out the game. It’s good to see some sensible people here.
---
I will officially use this as motivation to work out from now on...
---
Wow, that was a great movie!
---
Can I have a link to the Discord, please?
---
How did you get so many of those points already...?
---
God I love when people do this. Gives me a justifiable reason to camp half the team at once!
---
*Purge of Claudette*
---
Thank you.
---
Literal rank 20 killer faced with rank 5 and 4 survivors
---
Legion is fun I love them. Go with legion! (Plus you can always get joey and susie too with cells of course cuz even tho they a group you gotta buy the other two.)
---
What is the name of music used?
---
Yeah, I was just pointing it out. Idk if it is against the rules or not.
---
Lmao
---
It's real. He's been posting some dbd videos lately.
---
I love fighting myers. He is scary
---
I have a feeling that Ninja will become the new OchiDO but without any any skill, as OchiDO was a.. decently skilled player, but so toxic that Britney Spears would hide from him ( ';) )
---
Don’t bother stalking, it’s almost never worth it, causes way to much tunnel vision. run A nurses calling and preferably sloppy butcher, it’s one of ghost faces best perk being able to drop his terror radius to 0 on activation,  don’t bother chasing 1 survivor, you will lose the game, hit and run, survivors will have to waste a ton of time healing (which I have a nurses calling) and having 0 terror radius allows for a easy sneak attack and if they spot you, they will likely be out of position and can be an easy down. If they don’t heal, they are vulnerable to 1 shots not having to worry about stalking
---
You can run thanataphobia to add extra slow to repair and healing to make a nurses calling/ruin that much more deadly
---
yeaaaaah nah... 
---
it’s... it’s not that...
---
Ah I see, it was its own comment so I couldn’t tell.
---
First of all the entire point of the game is subjective. Is it to escape or to 4k? Is it to pip? They are not necessarily the same thing. You apparently have an entirely different definition of the point of the game, because in the original post the survivor had the option of allowing the killer to take them to the basement or to somewhere else on the map (or to DC altogether). DC'ing hurts both the killer and survivor in basically every way. Running to the other side of the map doesn't help the survivor because either way the survivor can get hooked. It only hurts the killer who now can't complete their challenge. As far as the "objective of the game" goes, it's irrelevant because the killer can still hook and get a kill and the survivor is dead regardless. Literally the only benefit for the survivor to DC or to run to the other side of the map is to be an asshole since it doesn't benefit their endgame at all.
---
If you really can't understand even after I laid ut out for you like this then I think you're a lost cause. Toxic players be toxic I guess.
---
Actually, I was able to just place it using the secondary action without channeling it first.
---
Might be wrong though, I do remember that I tested it and it worked!
---
This is the reason why the community is perceived as being extremely toxic in the first place. Let him play what he wants. His audience will boost player numbers, breathing life into the game. This is a good thing.
---
So for someone who started playing this game yesterday, but am a avid reddit user so found my way here quite quickly. What am I looking at? The only thing I could understand is that he is baiting the survivors thinking he is afk (prolly has something about him powering up his perks or that particular killer?) And that weird gate which blocked the escape, which seemed...OP in THIS particular instance, but I'm assuming it's trash or considered bad? Or has some other way to circumvent it.
---
Ah but you are forgetting survivors consider they have won when the gens are powered up. Anything after that  doesn’t count.
---
Yeah, my bad
---
If you want to remove keys because they’re a free escape, then remove all Moris because they’re just a free kill.
---
cultural exchange   
---
\-brings nomither
---
I would be lying if I say I won't try this.
---
They’re in the game. They’re good. They are there to be used. Shouldn’t antagonize players for doing so.
---
Gotta hand it to ya, you know your stuff
---
I added another comment here explaining that moris have the exact same problem, and they should both be removed or fixed.
---
Hahaha well played.
---
Add thrill of the hunt to help show you if someone's on your totems plus you get extra points for totems left if the hex is still active. If you have more than one hex chances are ppl will be looking for all of em. Not to be like a toxic killer here but I love noed. If I'm being nice to the survivors and letting them farm I let em know in advance hey I got noed. But i keep it on to punish those who bm me. It's good karma lmao 
---
Also side note iron maiden is great for huntress cuz she opens lockers faster which is needed since she gets her hatchets from there plus if someone's hiding you can find em when they exit the lockers 👌
---
Racism *spank* is not *spank* funny young man! *spank*
---
Now look at you, standing there with a blistered red ass, tears in your eyes, piss down your leg.
---
Pathetic.
---
Do gens. It takes 120 secs for someone to die from their first hook. It takes 80 secs to finish a gen. With 100% efficiency can nearly finish 4 gens just while someone’s on hook. That doesn’t even account for the chase/carry time to get them on the hook.
---
Obviously it’s not reasonable to expect 100% efficiency for a variety of reasons, but you can still reasonably expect the other 3 survivors to escape if you switch to prioritizing gens as soon as you recognize the killer is going to face-camp.
---
exactly. lets just hope they don't end up in the bad side
---
&gt;because he forces you to do something other than the objective
---
All he makes you do different is hunker down for a few seconds. People don't like him because his gsmes just take longerand theyre annoying
---
How's it a "new" tech? Everyone's acting like this guy's 1000000 IQ for discovering you can use the hooked survivor as a meat shield when hooked survivor collision has been in the game SINCE LAUNCH. 
---
When dedicated servers came out yeah the collision box was either removed intentionally but most likely (Since it wasn't part of patch notes and coincide only when dedicated servers were enabled) was bugged. 
---
Recently they re-enabled the hooked survivor collision. The meat shield "tech" has been part of the game almost since launch (Since at launch, you could only unhook directly from the front, and killers could literally up against the survivor's face facecamp to block the unhook) and I don't see anything new about it. Bodyblocking the hook itself has been part of the game since launch as well IIRC.
---
In terms of counterplay the killer can walk around and hit the unhooker if possible. Even when done correctly this "Tech" still is a fucking idiotic move to make since you're literally unhooking right in front of the killer. Yes for this to work you pretty much need borrowed time and the other guy to have DS but BT and new DS were mostly designed to work as anti-camping/tunnel perks.
---
They were never really intended to be "get out of consequences free card" for making a stupid decision like following a killer to the hook and unhooking literally in front of his face right after hooking. Even when the rescuer has BT and farms me off the hook I still get pissy because BT can't really protect you from being "tunneled" if the killer really wants to + it's not even tunneling if the killer decides to target me because you yeeted me off the hook 3 seconds after I was thrown on the hook.
---
TL;DR Hook "Tech" isn't new since it's been possible to do for over a year and possibly two years. It's not even a tech, it's an extremely high risk hook-dive with damage mitigation perks that has potential to end in disaster for the survivor unhooked. If you're doing this to me and I get "tunneled" and immediately rehooked, I blame you and not the killer.
---
Keys are overpowered. That's the point. Survivors have keys and killers have moris. Is it frustrating when survivors escape, especially if its 2 or 3 but it's not the end of the world. It's also highly possibly that if you play well enough nobody will get the chance to use it. Its just a game. So what if a couple survivors escape. Keys are perfectly fine. Some games I'm doing really well but two survivors manage to escape with a key. I pop them  a "gg wp" because its true. If keys are too much for you to handle stop playing killer. You take it way to seriously.
---
I'm doing this challenge with bubba, but not camping.
---
Sadly I had to use Nemesis + PWYF + Enduring + Spirit Fury with ebony mori.
---
I hate it, but I had to tunnel.
---
Using good perks I DONT HAVE ACCESS TO. Doesn’t stop people being toxic.
---
I can already feel my frames dropping

\*Chainsaw Noises\*
---
You definitely didn't read my post. You should go back and read it word for word. I've never been talking about people's actions in game. I could care less how someone acts while the game plays out.
---
We should not be toxic to them, we should educate them to be better than us
---
If you play survivor, almost all the best perks are on free characters (but they're spread around all of them).
---
If you have interest in playing Killer, you'll have a rough time without the perk Hex: Ruin (level 35 on the Hag). There's a perk called Barbecue and Chili, that's very helpful, but not necessary.
---
I left the match. When I tried to pick her up animation went for 0.1s and then it interrupted. I could move her by multiple pressing W and Space buttons.
---
Literally said about trying to introduce people to the game. First hand experience explained... yet apparently I still miss the point? 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh well. Let's hope outside of the game you accept real world facts like the world is not flat and licking plug sockets is not normal. 👍
---
Ninja has always been a pretentous pole smoker. Nothing has changed.
---
That's the point. Both survivors have a rare and overpowered tool. If you think BHVR has any intention to change that you're delusional. It was designed like that. Sorry the way the game was designed doesnt work for you.
---
I'll take 4
---
I know, like I said, the alternative is letting them die on their first hook. You're just adding details to that scenario. This is, in fact, what I do when I'm not running Borrowed Time or we're against Ghostface, but I still hate it because it sucks for that survivor who waited 12 minutes to get into a game just to spend 2 minutes on a hook.
---
It also doesn't work all that well because the other survivors *aren't* going to do this, so it will just be probably one generator done.
---
I always let survivors farm with very early DC.
---
I think is so unfair when someone DC right at match's start.
---
My point is you should play well to win. Using a key is not playing well, neither is using a Mori. Both Keys and Moris should be fixed or removed, because neither are fun to against. You’re right it is just a game, but games are supposed to be Fun, my problem with these, is that these make the game not fun.
---
Wait
---
Wait, real blood?!
---
Hollywood is TREMBLING.
---
I see a lot of pain in the Entitty's future
---
The spirit nerf bit is SO funny cause thats basically what happened omg   
---
"here are a lot of changes that dont in any serious way affect how you play against spirit cause their still isn't anything you can do aside from get lucky!! enjoy!" (now you just can't get unlucky with collision)
---
😏
---
No fake blood. My mistake
---
every good Billy I've gone against does this, if they dont it's usually a newer billy (exception: indoor maps, I'm so sorry mr billiam)
---
Oh
---
Hopefully they stay away from this subreddit.
---
I do it. Like I sit there and killers know how to get up there and they usually catch me anyways lmao it's just a fun little spot most of the time I get the killer standing with me anyways bc it's just a cool spot to stand on now. Me and a legion spent like half the match on that bc it's just a neat spot plus I got to see how they can get up faster than survivors. Plus a doctor showed me that spot before I knew really knew about it. 
---
Also side note you can get stuck there lmao me and a friend got stuck and ended up dying to the end game not that I'm mad or anything it was just great bc the other two had to do 3 gens and got to leave so I mean the killer got two free kills bc we got stuck lmao I'd say that's pretty lucky for em 😂
---
To clarify, some bug made ne blind the whole game since the first time i was blinded.
---
He’s just standing there, menacingly
---
Killers have to start using echolocation
---
I currently have a guy upset I was defending basement chest. Rank 1 btw.
---
BHVR has said they want to change these, you’re delusional to think they wouldn’t want to change these things. There are many things that came to the game in 2016 and 2017 that they have stated they want to change. Because in the games current state, these things just don’t work. Keys, Moris, Bloodlust, map designs, yes they were designed that way originally, that doesn’t mean that they were designed well.
---
That looks good!
---
For sure
---
A. Whenever you pallet stun a killer, as they are in the animation, you can blind them. You can also blind them as they break the pallet, and if you blind them as they break the pallet, wait a moment, and they aim your flashlight again, you can actually blind them twice as they do the pallet break animation, and they can't do anything to combat it. It's extremely easy to get 2 blinds in one game.
---
B. You don't need to flashlight save for the blinding a killer while he is carrying a survivor. Just wait for the killer to down someone, hope they don't face a wall while they pick the person up, sprint burst in front of them and blind them. Also super easy, since all you need is someone to go down in an area with no walls.
---
Ok so its not just me when you think youve broken the killers ankles with a spicy dead hard, only to have taken the hit, and see the exhaustion icon.
---
Wow
---
I thoroughly enjoyed this. The edits, the arrogance of the survivors, the absolute relentlessness of the kills. I watched it three times back to back. Been saving my silver for a worthy post for a long time and this warrants the award. Even if the game says the entity is displeased, it's smiling upon you for your sadistic behavior.
---
I just say let them flood in. Most of the fanbase won't last long once they discover good loopers, or come against top tier killers. I'll be glad for the ones who persist and stay, since it just adds to to the number of available players. Personally i've grown numb to the toxicity so to me it's not like it'll be anything new.
---
Basically, if you do it right, you can get 3 blinds with just one pallet drop, and you can blind the killer when they have a survivor by just blinding them as they pick them up.
---
stbfl on ghosti? :o
---
I agree with you. I don't think it's offensive, but definitely lazy.
---
Really? Thats' not supposed to happen on a new bloodweb.
---
Thank you for the feedback! Can I ask what makes the first two good and the last one bad?
---
Billy main. Can confirm.
---
I used photopea using very rudimentary skills lol. I found a post that had perks on it, and I cropped the image, erased the original text, and then put text over it!
---
Yes games are supposed to be fun but some play to be competitive. Plus fun is completely subjective. Just take your losses like everyone else does and get the hell over it. Keys and moris don't need to be removed since they are UR.
---
Killer:Shape/Wraith
---
Survivor: Nea
---
Ah OK so it's RNG. Guess I'll keep grinding. Killers do love hard patrolling hooks so getting caught right now feels like a death sentence.
---
how does it feel!? lmfao
---
Empathy is best when playing solo lol
---
Good riddance ya big bitch.
---
Holy shit dude
---
Yup, that happens while playing as trapper. People call using the trappers power and setting traps at the shacks enter/exit points "camping" because you return when a trap is disarmed. Nah mate, your job as a killer is not to ignore the location of a survivor who has revealed himself. Imo, that particular reason is why I rank the trapper much higher in the killer rank list than what he is at. Love the trapper.
---
This is why I love Myers. Stuff like this is totally unique to him. No other killer could pull something like this off.
---
Also 10/10 OP. Fantastic work.
---
LOL! It fits well with the quote though: "What's mine is yours..."
---
ty!
---
So you move faster? You get perks and add ons that can down survivors in one go but it's still not enough.
---
Forget that other game, hello kitty may be more ready for your skill set.
---
Cool man? Thanks for letting us know you are swapping to console. Do I chuck this post down to a tantrum?
---
Yeah. “Before they kill their game” that’s going on 4 years now lol
---
Ah yes, homophobic remarks. Quality stuff right here.
---
Tbh, I only bought the pass for the Nurse skin and I just bought it using the auric cells. I dont think many people will buy the next one
---
Some people are good at killers, some people are good at survivors. If you're finding difficulty with one, it just probably wasnt meant to be.
---
Quality*
---
You should probably get some new memes along with that new account.
---
I exported the image off of photopea and closed the page before I could make edits!! :(
---
Thank you for the feedback!! This must be like how the devs feel!!
---
Another term for cocksucker.
---
FUCKNINJA
---
The best way I can describe it is that the main thing you do in Dead by Daylight is fix gens to open the escape doors. The game is built around this concept and it's balanced for this purpose.
---
In F13, the goal is to escape, and they give you a few different ways to do it. Either by fixing the car or boat, calling the police, or even killing Jason. The issue is that the devs aren't the best and as a result you get a buggy and unpolished experience.
---
That being said, in the matches where everything works the way its supposed to work the game really shines.
---
But the survivor loses the item slot for a key which it's not a total guarantee that they're going to make it to the point where the hatch appears let alone find it... 🤷‍♂️
---
you're a bit of a snowflake mate.. come on sunshine - don't be a daft raji :)
---
Spine Chill, Kindred, and borrowed time are all readily available seeing as BT is in the shrine of secrets right now, and all of those are way better than Self Care. All self care does is encourage you to sit in a corner and hold m1 for much longer than just finding a teammate to heal you or bringing a medkit and saving a perk slot and your time
---
Yet you tea-bagged at the gate
---
You act like I’m the first person to complain about keys. If I was the only one complaining then Devs wouldn’t be planning to change them. People have been wanting the change or removal of Keys and Moris since additions of them. This is not a new problem, this is a long lasting problem, and for the first the Devs have said that they’re going to fix them.
---
Ok but like, so many people ignore her biggest counterplay. Flood the damn ponds with corruption, all of them, and then they will all disappear. You can do this with coordination with your team, or on your own by infecting an object, cleansing, touching the object, then finding another object/pool to cleanse. She'll get one purge, but then its all gone until people cleanse again.
---
The block over the exit gate is the perk Bloodwarden which can only be activated by hooking a survivor after the gates have been opened
---
Gotta get rid of the 5rd perk.
---
The ebony mori is even worse than the keys because one hook and you're toast.
---
Steam sale probably more than any streamer
---
I can't be on a gen if I'm in a locker. I see how it sounded though and you're right. BBQ has nothing to do with gens.
---
I named myself "flash save pls :(" and got someone to give me one in one game
---
Huntress can mori me anyday
---
Hello and sorry that was not very respectful of me. I think the randomness of the last and the duration makes it not reliable at all. The first two are pretty original and seems balanced to me :)
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eggyre/blood_lodge_rework_concept/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
yeah the idea of hiding your killer selection doesn't add much value, and not using your mobility for some time can hurt you. I'd rather reveal and immediately rev to the most likely gen to have people on it.
---
if they were equivalent then they would either cancel each other out or reward you for similar prerequisites. A more apt comparison would be Remember Me and Wake Up, the functions they serve mirror each other and  effect the same exact thing in the same way, slowing down and speeding up gate opening.
---
Another would be NOED VS. old DS, in which once the user is put into a losing situation they can use the perk to turn things around.
---
NOED and Adrenaline don't overlap at all. It isn't like the extra health state from Adrenaline stops you from getting insta-downed, nor does the 5 second speed boost stay in affect like the speed boost for NOED.
---
They aren't similar
---
Why are people up at arms over Ninja playing DBD
---
Which honestly, is terrible. The Entity feeds on hope, and this wasn't some hopeless snowball 4k. This should be a 16-point double pip. Imagine how much hope and happiness they had, and how that turned to fear and anger as they were picked off one by one with the exit gates blocked.
---
Probably people doing the escape as Claudette challenge.
---
Ah yes, the strongest perk in the game that can be countered by waiting 2 seconds before hitting. Once you know someone has it, it literally becomes the easiest thing to fake out.
---
He just 360 no scoped you dude
---
Only when he uncloaks.
---
Yes, and about 50% percent of my build changes mainly. I primarily Monitor and Abuse and Save The Best For Last, and the other two are usually a combination of Nurse's Calling, Infectious Fright, Corrupt Intervention.
---
I keep hoping this will eventually happen in a game where I'm killer
---
Boi dat shits SOLID!
---
I'm taking not many Hags are around?
---
Like I said, if used correctly. Great survivors dead hard for distance to make a vault or pallet. Resets the chase entirely when used properly.
---
Was that also an insta-heal after adrenaline?
---
Oof man feels bad
---
The clown running an offering for Haddonfield? Not surprised he’s running NOED lol
---
Best five minutes of my life
---
She's a keeper
---
Yes insta downs we get punished for. And all survivor perks can counter killers yet barely any killer perks counters survivors, so explain that and how that is fair
---
Messaged!
---
Respawn Restricted
---
I was literally watching one of the developers stream and he just had a match where the survivors accused him of camping because he stayed near the hook in the endgame while 2 of the 3 unhooked survivors tried to loop and hide around the hook.
---
I'm surprised it's lasted for aslong as it has with how much they pander to survivors whims.
---
better than the in game image
---
Time to beat the meat
---
Wow smart . What are you twelve? Try having a conversation like an adult.
---
[Zack Hemsey - "Mind Heist"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpR4p41F8G4)
---
Yeah cool man. did you just want a proper send off? why make the post to complain add nothing then leave a game because you find it hard.
---
I love STBFL on most killers. Any killer without a reliable 1 hit down or a non-standard chase mechanic can benefit.
---
Exactly this; I will play like I normally do unless I can recognize that they’re brand new...and even then it can be difficult, because they just might be new to THAT Killer...can’t hardly tell sometimes until the end game happens
---
It's a pretty good                                     
---
Job so far* 
---
FTFY
---
That actually looks legit
---
Reply with "Are you the Nurse? because you take good care of me &lt;3"
---
No one else that has a modicum of ability seems to struggle. I bet you found a survivor team that you couldn't outplay and now are throwing a tantrum, accept you can't win every game instead of complaining that there is nothing you can do.
---
yt link?
---
Nobody cares, Shrek.
---
Im a rank sixteen killer, started a few days ago (as killer anyway). Got 2 reds and 2 purples. I've been tbagged today. Funny thing is I got one and they started arguing in post game chat.
---
*insert magneto perfection meme
---
Everyone's used to the piano in Myers at this point, it just goes in one ear and out the other.
---
No, OoO + swf is the most toxic thing in this game.
---
x)
---
Even though I believe him play DBD is a good thing to boost player count, this guy has no idea what he’s in for with stream snipers and toxic survivors.
---
This... THIS is a pro gamer move.
---
damn i didn't even notice the medkit
---
i gave up after that so at least i can take solace in choosing to believe they used up a syringe for nothing
---
Can someone explain this
---
Watched him stream for a few minutes and I couldn’t decide who was more annoying: him, or his insufferable girlfriend. They’re not funny or entertaining and not even good enough at the game to be worth watching. No idea why he is as popular as he is.
---
No you ain't. You are throwing a tantrum. You are just complaining and threatening to quit. 
---
Calm down. And try again.
---
Thx man
---
This is some really cringe gate keeping shit
---
Since his fans are mostly kids, they'll most likely only care about acting like their idol. It's entirely up to Ninja how they'll behave, so if he goes down the toxicity route then be prepared for a new breed of evil.

A trapper maybe?
---
Where have I not been calm, in any of these posts? Please show me your evidence.
---
Maybe developers can make a player slow vault a known god loop. Or give killers a quicker vault just on that specific loop instead of reconfiguring the map
---
I hope you’ve been stalking up on your Moris... and your flashlights.
---
yep exactly, and if everyones hiding til I make my rounds then that's time they're not doing gens
---
they're still young, they can learn
---
and/or get fed up and leave. i'll take either
---
Killer perks are better than survivor perks. There’s like 5-6 good survivor perks and 10+ good killer perks
---
Wait...AHHHHH!!!
---
Your lack of self awareness is fucking staggering.
---
Honestly not even that, just know the right moment to place it to stop the loop
---
It would be cool if when that generator is completed the car in front of t would have its engine rev and its lights would start blinking
---
Again show me where.

I'm not acting like that at all, because I know other people bitch and moan about them either. I'm just giving you the same information.

I thought about getting this because i saw it in a second hand game store for cheap and watched some streams and just found the game play boring. It was only 5 bucks so I might pick it up for a try still but I don't expect to play it much. I mean when your wiki tries to make a selling point that some random youtube channel said they like the game more doesn't say much about the game
---
Mate we've all been where you are, irate and mad at the world. Hitting out at everyone here telling you that you're objectively wrong isn't doing anything. Go away calm down, relax enjoy time off work or school, this isn't the hill to die on.
---
Actually it becomes the opposite, at this point they would have PTSD for sure and are almost dead inside due to the constant torture.
---
Looks great! Where do I put in an order?
---
Really good job tho. :)
---
Yeah I think killer is hard and can sometimes be impossible to win but I've beat many higher rank swfs with low tier killers, you probably aren't playing as optimally as you could be. And if you get frustrated when you lose just keep in mind that gaining rank literally does nothing. Even by losing you get more blood points than survivors and vs rank 1 survivors might not even guarantee they'll be good. 
---
That being said If you're really itching to win, just get Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, Thanataphobia, Hex:Ruin or any variation of that and go to town as Wraith
---
The only real life killer they'll do is Jack the Ripper. And that's it
---
Hes probably one of those “iF u DoNt TuNnEl yOu DonT WiN” people that pick Freddy or Trapper and tunnel one person to death and NOED the rest.
---
Who would you like to play and what have you been struggling with? It can be hard to play certain Killer/perk combos that aren't super meta. Also I find my Killer performance can really vary depending on what mood I'm in and where my head is. You really have to be able to compete with survivors who are predicting your every move
---
It's not as long as the players are not showed in a negative light. It is polite to sensor names though.
---
and who says you need to play the game to win?
---
The unlimited power and the only way to end DbD is on my hand now.
---
10000 IQ right here
---
I think the more the merrier, and if Ninja pushes the game to be more competitive it might means that it become more balanced.
---
Picture this, the game starts i am playing good old bing bong boy with auditation 3 and iron grasps 1 to complete the 4 sacs in the basement this guy last one left alive figured out i needed that done and kept breaking out and when i finally got him downed at the shack he dc and in chat states "thats what you get for holding the game hostage" as well as "i hope you enjoy the ban for it too"
---
Yeah Friday the 13th is a good example of what happens when the survivor is too OP, and  Deathgarden is a good example of what happens when the killer is too OP, both are dead or dying.
---
Awww your welcome you did amazing on it
---
Oni just watches old samurai movies over actual anime unless they have really big swords
---
Completely agree with you, a more in depth survivor game. Unfortunately, as you mentioned, the games devs are nearly null and void.
---
Thank you random stranger
---
What happened m8?
---
Yeah my Myers build is all about quick snowballing and the ranking system hates it, but I have good fun

What is the context here?

I wish I could sell them, that’d be awesome. Thank you so much :)
---
I got the dark sense one first try because I recently started running spine chill and that helped me a lot surprisingly. That and I mostly focused on gens and unhooking if the person was close enough to me. But yeah, just for one game be super focused on gens with maybe spine chill or something
---
The way he treats killers though is far from competitive and more like a toxic survior. He claimed Pig of all killers was overpowered...
---
Get the first game as survivor and killer every day, that gives you 300 exp, and after the 10 first minutes of a match you will stop gaining exp so try the last around 10 minutes and if you buy the rift you get all the rewards of the premium pass until the level you are
---
Slug them all, let them bleed out and immediately leave the match when they all die
---
Much to the contrary. 
---
If you have a bad map/generation, any survivor with half a brain can loop you for long enough to end the game. 
---
In those situations, you either snowball off of weak links or you lose.
---
Take The Game for example. The props on that map consist of 2 jungle gyms, a couple vault spots, 1 or 2 unsafe pallets, and 15-20 safe pallets.
---
By all rights,  that map should be more or less a free escape, since there's no mindgames to any of those safe pallets, and each pallet will buy you roughly 18 seconds (can't recall if that's for the stun+break or just the break). Somehow,  despite how the map basically plays itself, The Game has the highest kill rate in the game.
---
This is largely because killers realize they're just gonna lose if they focus good players, so they kill the baby Megs and snowball. 
---
Prioritization is a thing.
---
Yh it would
---
hmm then we'd give em surv speed or, slightly slower, maybe remove feral frenzy and give them a new ability, where injured, downed, or hooked (except location, blind perks) survs status are hidden and they take on their appearance
---
Hahaha, really good. as a fan of the F13th I really like the joke.
---
Hag
---
Doctor
---
Trapper
---
The latter 2 aren't the strongest killers but are obnoxious to play against with doctor about to become even more annoying once his rework comes.
---
true, I like stbfl on gf as well. I usually dont stalk too much, rather use the stealth advantage to get an easy first hit with fast recovery.
---
It's one of my main perks on him personally, he's basically an M1 killer so it's pretty good on him
---
It does on mobile
---
-signed Mobile Gang
---
What's your perk skin?
---
And the emblems gives you exp too but i don't know how many
---
Sorry I’m new with huntress. What’s this mean?
---
That is simply not true, since sometimes a killer's base power already counters survivor perks and a mori can, for example, counter DS, Stridor counters Iron Will, BBQ counters any stealth build, Sloppy Butcher counters healing in general as well, especially combined with Nurse's Calling, Hangman's Trick counters Saboteur etc. 
---
I also don't see how killers get punished for instadowns? T3 Myers doesn't suffer any consequences. Neither does Oni when in Rage. The only time Hilbilly gets punished for his instadown is when he misses or bumps into something, but his chainsaw doesn't have a cooldown or charge meter. Noed only punishes the killer when all totems are destroyed or when he gets a 4k before all gens are done, rendering it useless. Huntress only gets one hatched when using iridescent head, but you should never use it without infantry belt anyway. Ghost Face just needs to be sneaky to get his insta down in, but there's no punishment for using it. 
---
Sounds like you just got outplayed.
---
SWF make any deception abilities impractical and making them slower or the same speed as survivors counter them too much in the opposite direction I think, all it'd take is a survivor to get away from the two of you once and you're struggling to re-catch them. PLUS when you hit a survivor they usually jolt forward, right? How do you catch them then? If the answer is "Legion doesn't jolt survivors forward" then I suppose the question then becomes how do you stop Legion 2 tapping someone immediately if you're both in hitting range? All in all multiple killers just don't work, I think, not unless it's 2 killers / 8 survivors or something. But then... you know, more generators.
---
I only has to take one look at your comment history to understand that you really just simply hate fun. I’m done responding, can’t teach common sense and empathy to people like you.
---
It can be rough playing the killer. If you lose, then you suck, and if you win, then you're an asshole. I definitely need a break after a string of bad games, but I always come back for some masochistic reason. If you aren't having fun, then definitely give yourself some space from it.
---
Well it looks like we can’t agree on this viewpoint. I will refer you to my past 5 examples now. Sorry but nothing you’ve said here has changed my mind. They don’t need to overlap, I haven’t been around for the old DS, and equivalencies don’t have to cancel out or have same prerequisites. 
---
Thanks for the discussion mate but it’s time to move on.
---
The game has a tutorial but it doesn't really teach you anything useful
---
Dont be toxic, just be better at the game than ninja and the kids. Eventually the will wise up or be punished on the regular.

Pushing the game to be more competitive is a bad idea. Major of the playerbase are casual, so that would push a lot of players away.
---
Doctor's goddamned iPhone 4, BHVR please make this an addon
---
Hitboxes do not match character models in many instances. Basically draw a circle around the character's feet and then use that to make a cylinder up to their head (actually average surv height but w/e). This is the hitbox, it does not change when you are:
---
Doing gens
---
Healing
---
Injured
---
Vaulting
---
Running
---
ETC
---
It does change when you crouch (just gets shorter). So for example when you are injured and running and leaning forward I can hit behind your back because that's where the cylindrical hitbox is, even though none of your model is there.
---
Ahh i see. Thanks for the in depth reply
---
It’s time to fight back
---
it's a joke you dip
---
You’d have made a better Clown imo
---
Also another fun build if anyone wants to try: Rancor, BBQ, Blood Warden, Agitation.
---
Isn't this witch hunting?
---
That's a feels bad sorry to hear that man. Good luck on getting it.
---
Fun for you is not fun for others, buddy. It's subjective. But have fun in your narrow vision.

How so?

No she’s almost like a myth

---
Been fucking around with MoM/Unbreakable/Tenacity/No Mither on and off for a couple of weeks, still rank 1.
---
Getting MoM to proc with no mither is a lot of fun. Tank hits while survivor gets carried, crawl the fuck away and the killer usually loses you.
---
Meta perks don't do shit.

Better than playing against killers with WiFi McDonald’s who hit you from Jupiter

If you make a post featuring other players in a negative light, censor all usernames. Shaming other players by name encourages harassment, drama, and witch-hunting.

I'm sorry I get tired of a meme that was already posted a couple times in this reddit. What happened to this reddit hating reposts?
---
No one escapes Madgitation
---
You are aware of how hypocritical that is for you to say right?
---
the ole' agree to disagree. Gotta love that lazy term.
---
This is more of the same joke instead of a repost. In my about 5 seconds of searching I did not see the exact same image.   
---
  
---
then again reddit search is complete dogshit.
---
It LITERALLY teaches you exactly what he is saying he didn't realize til now

I’m sorry i didn’t rate your build but i just wanted to say I have that same Yui outfit

That's very incorrect. The killer had 17 hours played. Couldn't have been even remotely close to our levels.
---
Fortnite is the most popular game on twitch. Yet it’s somehow dead? 🤔
---
Dark sense bow buffes, meme outdated
---
Thanks closes i had gotten and of coarse i get a troll
---
Keys are sorta like an alternative to the old BNPs from back when you could instantly complete a gen and shorten the game by a great deal. Major difference is that just one key can skip up to two whole generators AND exit gates. Killers can close the hatch and trigger EG, leave it and risk more escapes, or guard it and waste precious time. Moris are different now but they have the same problem -- completing a major portion of the objective instantly. Instead of chase-hook-chase-hook-chase-hook it's now chase-hook-chase-kill on the spot.
---
Old BNP and old moris were fucking horrendous, but they were watered down because eventually BHVR realized that they're not good at designing something to be powerful and still have counterplay.
---
*helen keller has entered the chat*
---
It’s probably the most popular free game right now. I really don’t get how this dude thinks its dead, because it easily has more players than Dead by Daylight.
---
the joke was definitely already made about Otz liking I'm All Ears specifically over STBFL. I think it was even the same exact format as this even just a different image.
---
It also isn't new that he liked it, he said it's merits like days after Ghostface even came out.
---
it kinda sucks when the thing you like becomes associated with someone you dislike and/or who embodies values you disagree with, but i'm not sure he has the clout anymore to make a significant change to the playerbase.
---
but also is this even news? i feel like there were posts worrying about ninja playing dbd months ago and things just kept trucking on. had he not actually started back then or...?
---
If I can tell that he needs and and I'm last I always give it to them because. Meh it's one game I dont care I'll help someone out.
---
Hold “W” to win.
---
Deff balanced killers get Mori so. You just seem salty
---
I have done it as well, anytime i see him bringing people to the basement im last alive i just walk down to it and start fast vaulting out of the lockers
---
if you’re going to bash someone for something at least make it a legitimate complaint, but just bashing someone for being popular and bad at a video game is pathetic
---
“Master Skywalker what are we gonna do?”
---
You cold man lmaoooo
---
but how many people he brings in will last
---
Well the killers do play to kill, not play fair. Fairness is all but using hacks to play the game, no hacks no problem. Sure survivors will use whatever means, including not playing fair just as a killer camping/tunneling to survive, but being salty or toxic about it don't do no good, sometimes you have to camp, sometimes they nose dive the hook right away, can't stop either side, or punish them, its too common, too natural, we've all done it when first starting out, it happens, those that continue are just being dicky. Other times theres a OoO in a sfw group and you need to tunnel the guy asap to stand a chance, other times theres that perfect team of solos (rare, but it only happens when you're not playing survivor) where all the gens get done before you've gotten your first hook and camping feels like the only way to go about getting a kill. Its not because the killer sucks, some people have a bullheaded mentality and will not stop chasing someone till they catch them, even when all gens are popping around them. Which is why a lot of killers bring up the "gen rush" problem, time kinda stands still during a chase, if 2 gens can pop before a killer finds those cheeki blendettes or if ONE guy can loop an average player long enough to get 3 or even all gens done, then survs need another objective thats not the occasional hex totem.

I wish I tried this "tactic" at least once vs SWF.
---
Damn we need an actual Native American killer in DBD. Sure the Hag is kind of based off a Wendigo, but that’s kind of a reach. Skinwalker would be cool.
---
I think they are trying to tell you something...
---
wow...
---
Thanks for the idea :)
---
I read this in his voice
---
I do agree, but I feel it has also been ruined by people just working together with Jason, telling him where everybody is. As someone who used to play it alone most of the time, it made the game very unfun
---
Sorry I’ve never heard the term forever Freddy. What build is that?
---
Imagine being genuinely upset that people are trying to stream a game more
---
Y'know that's actually interested. Jason has never used a chainsaw ONCE in any of the movies.... You'd think that'd be a no brainier for a kill or two
---
Oh wow. I didn’t realize that works. But it makes sense. It’s similar to what some people do with Legion by trying to stand next to them when they get hit so legion can’t tell the two auras apart.
---
It does work, doesn't mean potatoes don't pay attention to it tho xD Its why insidious bubba will always prevail!
---
Remember when Killer Keemstar complained about killers being OP and there not being enough pallets on the map?
---
Killer usually becomes not fun around mid-purple ranks, where all you hit a red swf.  Fortunately, BHVR has made rank mean fuckall  for the game, so just play meme builds on bad killers. 
---
Once you start playing stupid builds, you end up taking the game much less seriously. Plus, you'll usually derank, helping you to avoid the try hard gangs. Added bonus,  when you do get kills, it is pretty hilarious/aggravating depending on your perspective.
---
I'm glad inception made into your video. Good fucking video mate!
---
What survivor mains wanted for Christmas
---
Wait should it say "Year 1978" for the year of the movies release or am I missing something
---
I'd just rather crybabys that constantly complain about pointless things in the community are better off not influencing 1,000s of newbys in a game.  
---
If he treats this anything like fortnite then Id rather him not be here.  If he matures a bit, so be it. Eitherway, Im not watching him, so he can do whatever.
---
I've been playing the past few days as Killer, I'm rank 8 so borderline purple. I am consistently matched against rank 2's and 3's with maybe a rank 5 thrown in. I will happily admit that I am pretty bad at the game; but I get unfairly stomped every match with how good these people can loop me. 
---
It is super demoralizing to sit on the same pips for countless hours (some up/down ofc) because the vast majority of games are heavily favored to survivor. I understand rank is not the be all and end all; but I cannot even have fun in my games because they are such a stomp. As another comment mentioned this aswell... I don't want 4 kills every match - but I do expect to be able to hook some survivors.
---
Yesterday i was doing the all 4 people dying in the basememt and the nea got out with like 2 sec lrft before dying and she tbagged at the gate, thing is she would have died if i wasnt going to the basement bc she wriggled off
---
Lol I doubt he'll get banned for it.
---
I'd argue neither of you held the game hostage.
---
Personally I just play keep away from the basement, but if the killer manages to hook me I won't DC to prevent it. I certainly won't hand it to them on a silver platter though, no free rides.
---
What is the forever Freddy and skill check doc builds?
---
Had to keep her occupied so I could get my power back
---
This is my tier list for my personal preference on what killer I like playing against: [https://imgur.com/92FGDh6](https://imgur.com/92FGDh6) 
---
 As for killer, I prefer to play: [https://imgur.com/TJxu237](https://imgur.com/TJxu237)
---
I didn't bash him.  Just said he was bad.  Antagonizing me because I said someone was bad at the game and assuming it was because he's popular is pathetic.
---
please please man... I so badly want to be with you on this but "sounds like you just got outplayed", why did you fuck all your hard work with that. On your dam comment as well my god.
---
Oh god no i don't expect that but when i down you near the basement would you insta dc
---
Its settled then, all killers should be made stealth killers for infinite jump scares, and a new objective should be added to give them the time to be extra slow and creepy.
---
I mean he isngoing to bring in people to play this witch u belive needs to happen ots probably going to be his bitchy fortnite players bit maybe its the kind of bitchyness behavior needs in order tovgive us more game modes or other stuff that majorngames have
---
It’s strange but can happen. I have over 1k hours and I saw a gen spawn on Badham right next to the ambulance for the first time recently. It really threw me off.
---
Skill Check Doc:
---
Unrevering Presence/Distressing/Huntress Lullaby/Overcharge with both Calm add-ons.
---
I can't really remember the Forever Freddy, but basically perks and add-ons that makes survivor take a very very long time to do gens and probably healing
---
they can tell the difference the moment bubba starts oinking like a pig
---
# I'VE GOT YOUR DLC RIGHT HERE!
---
ria
---
Exactly, you need no Mither + Iron Will to fully counter a killer running stridor.
---
You wouldn't catch me within a mile of the basement if I know the killer has a basement build lmao, but nah I wouldn't DC over that.
---
I wouldn't be doing this if they weren't salty
---
He didn't tell anyone how to do it only that you can tho
---
No, not really.... I use mostly tracking perks with her (BBQ, Nurse, Whispers, Myc)...I am surely not the best spirit but this build works really well for me
---
The oni puts a stop to this real quick
---
A lagging teammate is better than no teammate.
---
This makes me moist.
---
Youngling hunt, yes!
---
recently i played against a doctor and had no idea pallets that don't exist appear when you are crazy. i had never seen that before that game despite playing against a decent amount of doctors recently. still don't know if it was just an add on or what
---
Good to know, for the record not really a basement build more a long transportation build in my opinion with just the two i had
---
Its when a killer stands around a hooked survivor waiting for them to be pulled off so they can tunnel them out of the game, and the other survivors use this time to do gens.
---
What's sad is your shallow 'whatabout noob3' attempt at defending ninja being toxic
---
did you get any sacs?
---
Ah yes it's an add on. If he breaks a pallet it appears as a illusion pallet to surviors when insane.
---
I'd Tapp that
---
That doesn't change the fact that this is witch hunting

And No0b3
---
Sounds like a game I had a few days ago. They called me toxic for using NOED, (which I don’t even like, I’m using it as a placeholder for Monitor, which I don’t have yet) yet they use insta heals, insta flashlights, and Decisive Strike. Kinda funny looking back that they used my decision to bring NOED as an excuse for them pointing and squatting. They didn’t even reach the end game, and it was level 1 at the time.
---
Shoot me a link my dude! :)
---
It looks even more disturbing to watch...
---
I love it.
---
So many people are hating on ninja all of sudden. They clearly don’t watch him and accuse him of stuff lol
---
I think you need to play the game first....there are no essential dlcs, but there are really good perks on them, and they diversify the fun a lot. Muito first DLC was because of windows of opportunity (I really wanted to be able to be better in chases), and that’s extremely far from what people will recommend you
---
This is beautiful
---
Check out OhTofu’s recent flashlight guide on YT, seriously. I’d been trying for so long to figure it out and that video helped me immensely. I was absolutely dreadful and I can get most blinds these days. But once you get it, it’s extremely gratifying.
---
Your best bet for this challenge is to get into a good chase and hope you get a killer that knows to break pallets. Learn how to position your camera towards the neck/face before you start using the flashlight as adjustments mid-use are trickier. If you see the beam tightening, don’t move. Once you get the score event, run the F away as you’ll only be wasting charges. Getting the blinds here is the easiest way, in my opinion. 
---
If you are on PS4 and want some private match practice, feel free to invite me (Wicked-Hardcorg) for a match or two.
---
If they consistently ban people for being toxic only 10 players would remain on dbd
---
Well he is getting a rework with a major buff where he can shock and smack much easier. With his shocks he can legit break loops hard.
---
Even if it is a bad thing ninja could make dbd more popular.
---
The only thing tjat helped me was playing with others. You can ask on steam if ppl look for a 4th player or something.
---
Shit I wanna do this really badly now
---
That’s just how the game is when the killer disconnects
---
If someone uses DS on me, I'm more likely to want to tunnel them.
---
Oh no she's cute
---
I love mixed outfits like this make the characters feel more personal.
---
такова жизнь на восточном фронте
---
all survivors can hear the phase sounds  like legions red add on which gives it a terror radius in whole map
---
I disagree. Them knowing you're present at all (playing normally) may be a tell to be cautious, whereas a 100% AFK Myers that just tiers up may be a bot or a bug.
---
Though I'd love OP's take on the matter.
---
It was a guaranteed 4k. And we do get moris but if you're a respectful killer like me you won't bring them. Bringing a key is just a dick move.
---
That's your opinion
---
I know I was only kidding ;p
---
makes sense
---
Some survivors forget that you aren't actually invulnerable at god loops
---
0 its hard to play perma blinded
---
It's my Favorite one along with the white one, cool to see a soulmate
---
I know exactly what you are talking about. :)
---
I was the Jake in the video, and I just realized he 4% off the hook but died anyways.
---
how did they not hear the music of you tiering up to tier 2? wouldn't that have given it away?
---
I like the community the way it is, sure he’ll bring in some diversity and stuff but i dont know. He could badmouth the game a bunch, which no one would want. The diversity could bring in a whole new play style maybe, you never know.
---
I always enjoy catching surviors off guard when I come around the corner. Two surviors at the exit gate poweringvit on then all of sudden big old oni smashes both of them. I love him.
---
So the "hitbox" this game is actually a hit circle. The more you know.
---
Its when survivors try to do gens as fast as they can
---
No, it is not, that's the rule
---
Shot!
---
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. You are literally a Native saying this is messed up. These are stereotypes and one of which is “cultural exchange”?  Sigh. Community let me down today.

---
Now this.....this puts a smile on my face
---
That's the evilest thing I've ever seen and as a survivor main I love it!
---
You need to get a life my guy
---
It’s part of the game lol. Survivors have to deal with camping killers and moris so survivors deserve to use keys.
---
But isn’t that the point of the game
---
Oh I know, still super lame when it so consistently happens.
---
How long you been playing? This game does take some time to "Break in". Some perks are unfortunately "Required" for newer killers(By that I man players not the actual character) to be viable.
---
Honestly, the game gets a lot easier once you stop following the imaginary rulebook that people have placed on killers. It's better to not care about what people say in after game chat, although I know that's easier said than done. I feel like in every game there's just gonna be that one role that morons bitch about constantly; in LoL, it's jungle. In Overwatch, healers. In here, killers.
---
Also how rare is it for people to escape with keys i play killer and I’ve deadass havnt had anyone use a key to get out and I’ve been playing since the game came out. I’ve seen mori be used way more then keys
---
You think the 4 man basement and spine chill challenge are fun? What are you a masochist?
---
It's juvenile, but I'm kinda glad. I've really begun to dislike McLean. 
---
I feel he plays both sides of being a player/dev based on what fits his current need. He advertises himself as a dev - getting a decent following on Twitch, but he ignores a lot of criticism/questions about the game. 
---
Most troubling for me, he spreads inaccurate information - supporting his claims with an ethereal database no one outside BHVR has access to. Even though most of the time it is something mundane, discounting hundreds to thousands of hours of game time with datasets you can't produce really leaves a bad taste - especially when it is easily reproduced.
---
Survivors can keep the jolt, the legions will just have to coordinate silently through telepathy to catch em, they can still bloodlust and jazz, blinds are a great counter to swf, unlike survivors, they can't buddy up or que together unfortunately, it will be a random teammate. Also proximity voice chat for survivors would be groovy, then the killer can hear their cheeki plans, won't stop steam/discord parties tho. But I can already hear the toxic bming from comms thinking about it, probably a good thing voice isn't added to this game actually...
---
He's def a fun killer to play and play against. Great chapter in general
---
I've done it against spirit in red ranks on PS4 without any item and used Spine Chill, Bond &amp; Lithe.. was just lucky, but that challenge is nothing special, just more luck
---
How am i shaming?
---
I just saw the episodes of Ash vs Evil Dead that had Samara Weaving in them!
---
Low Quality Bait
---
This, I've been playing for awhile and if anything my experiences have improved since I left (took a break for about 8 months due to burnout) even though I play ps4 I get mostly good messages and even when someone's being toxic on either side it only ever really amounts to "lol you used x tactic git gud" whereas before I pretty much had to block communications due to every other match someone was sending me hate mail. I mean I still get hate mail but once every session or so is a lot better than once every 2-3 games.
---
&gt; If you make a post featuring other players in a negative light, censor all usernames.
---
Posting a picture of 3 people insulting you is featuring them in a negative light
---
How did you get away with the tiering up jingle?
---
"Excuse me, what the fuck?"
---
And I never said that guy shows how to do it BC he doesn't
---
Wait how? I was born in my 20s
---
Agreed. Plague is too weak atm. Legion needs a buff too
---
Sounds like you havent played killer at red ranks. It is definitely harder than survivor especially when survivors have teams on mic.
---
Pig and Myers decided to swap abilities for a day
---
Insta flashlights?
---
why is the post 1:40 mins long? you could easily cut it to 30 important seconds
---
Basically doing the one and only single objective the survivors have too quickly for the killer to get enough hooks in to kill anyone.  Efficiency = toxic.  There are perks to counter this like Ruin and Thanatophobia, and a while back the devs made it so that gens take longer, but killers are still annoyed. 
---
The quickest way of doing this is having every survivor on different generators, and when the killer finds one, hopefully they can run them long enough so that 3 generators are popped almost simultaneously in the first couple minutes of the game. Just make sure you don’t set yourself up with the remaining generators in close proximity because then the killer can basically patrol gens and hook people before anyone can finish it in time.
---
just because they’re both ultra rares doesn’t mean you can add that to her kit and think it’s fair lol
---
it’s the best tracking add on in the game, it’s crazy how much information she gets from it
---
if they made that base kit they’d 100% have to take something away
---
Oh ik, just in case some people thought so i said I'd pre answer it.
---
Myers ambushing with his pipe
---
Those 2 as well as hillbilly are my favorite killers to play so sign me tf up. Fan art when?
---
Not sure if it was a bug or some add ons, but I got blinded instantly without a chance to look away. It was a weird game to say the least
---
This is why I'm not happy about Hunting Grounds, they shit the bed with F13, imagine the damage they'd do to Predator. A once in a blue moon good match isn't great when they fucked so much up. The only good thing F13 did was bring me to the infinitely superior DbD.
---
LMAO this is great!! I feel like Myers is the most fun killer to go against because he can be so goofy (the moonwalking kills me every time)

When the killer hasnt hit anyone and 2 gens have been popped
---
Trapper:
---
The most obvious one: Run DS
---
In my opinion you should also try bringing Vigo's Shroud in the game, as it will theoretically spawn you as far from the killer as possible
---
Even though one is dead.
---
Shitpost?
---
But that's also why we don't get any new players. The community has such bad reputation that no one wants to join in.
---
Solid advise, thanks
---
TIL that a game that struggles to run on PS4/Xbox is available for switch and coming soon to IOS
---
I almost never have this problem as killer it’s kinda crazy
---
Shut up moron if the killer wants to tunnel you to death then you’re gonna die
---
High key thought it was just a zoomed in picture of the actual thing

Remember that timeframe where the "fixed" Huntresses hatchet hitbox and made it accurate to the tiny little hatchet she actually threw and she was literally unplayable for a while.

I used to get upset but I don't care now. If one person DC we can still do it, but it's a challenge for sure. I just use the opportunity to get better than I was the game before. If people leave I can't do anything by getting upset, so I learned to get over it. I don't play many games where survivors DC though, and from my perspective the killer DC more than survivor.
---
There’s a reason r/dbdgonewild exists, it’s so we don’t have to deal with it here

The only valid reasons to disconnect are the one that even a 5 hours penalty wouldn't change nothing.
---
Sweet Jesus I don't want to know what he thinks of the stronger ones
---
DBD is a game that you only keep playing if you have enough heart to get your butt kicked and keep going. When you first start, the only thing keeping you going is the idea that you will get better with time. There’s no way someone like him would be able to stick to the determination it takes to deal with other players as a team and killers also humans you have to outsmart
---
Stalk if you can but, don't rely on it. Use his power for mind games and quick grabs/hits. Maps that give you a high vantage point can also be useful in it gives you a vantage point to stalk survivors easily.
---
The only toxic one I see here is the survivor....
---
Been on the challenge since tome 4 released. I'm about ready to give up. You literally need incompetent teamates and a killer with ruin. And still hope you get lucky.
---
 Just let him play a game damn. I mean like there’s gonna be more kids now but they’ll get the game get destroyed either leave or stay and get better.
---
Yeah the community is toxic as it is already...some people and posts on this sub are proof of that. Ninja isn't gonna magically change an already toxic community or make it worse
---
How? We weren't even a swf and he unreadied to put on franklin's, noed and a mori, and then proceeds to troll me at the end before he would mori me. I just gave him karma
---
How did he troll you at all? You got up and bagged at the exit. That's the only toxic thing I see.
---
You forgot one: the avatar
---
He would legit let his team die just so he can get the hatch.
---
Meanwhile you have me running in, saving a hooked dwight during the endgame collapse since the other two surviors wouldn't go... and sacrificed myself for the dwight so he could live.
---
legion is interesting. A lot of perks don't work with Legions frenzy but there is a good advantage in having people injured all the time. I like perks that reduce terror radius so I can sneak up on people. But this does reduce your detection range. I also find legion is good for farming bloodpoints cos you can just stab people a lot.
---
I’m a survivor main and everyone I see videos of toxic survivors tbagging and flashlight clicking,  just think it’s cringy
---
Y'all act like you're not a bunch of toxic immature children with the stuff you all post on this sub...gtfoh
---
Unfortunately it costs money to get lorrie stride so that’s not an option
---
It's super rare. I think it's only like a 5% chance but I haven't tested it.
---
I’ve only ever managed to pull this off once. Thankfully I had a styptic agent because you’d better believe my ass was getting tunneled after that
---
"I'd fuck myself too."
---
No that sub shouldn't exist either. Just don't be fucking cringy
---
The dead inside survivors get yeeted to the void tho
---
Lol I am a streamer xD
---
I had a match against a No0b3 wannabe who just kept spamming EAZZY after he found the hatch before me, every other survivor had been tombstoned and they just urbaned around with spine chill
---
Hmmmmm
---
Can they add an Anakin skin for this guy?
---
You can get DS from Shrine of Secrets.
---
The only issue is that we don't know when DS will appear in Shrine again.
---
You can try to play more stealthy as well as bringing the Vigo's Shroud.
---
You can also go SWF
---
How is Ruin OP
---
How is Ruin and NOED OP?
---
Voice is a terrible idea, in my opinion, and SWF is kind of proof as to why that is. With voice the game doesn't work very well, especially since the core design philosophy is struggling with 3 other people and no way to properly communicate, with only certain perks helping you even figure out what everyone else is doing. That ambiguous nature, should I do X, will someone else do X? is part of the charm I think.
---
I just meant this as a response to op saying keys should be taken out. I'm well aware these things have been nerfed but if BHVR didnt want each side to have a powerful weapon they would have removed them. I know they struggle with balance but it's also tiring to constantly hear: "too strong, please nerf" at every fun aspect of dbds gameplay. Are keys and moris unbalanced? Totally! Are they fun and should they stay in the game? Yes!
---
What’s swf? And I try to be stealthy but no matter what I do they know
---
Noed is absolutely a crutch perk for bad killers. But ruin is just a slow down perk. Hit your greats
---
NOED has single handedly, due to little to no fault of my own, has made a 0K into a 4K. And ruin is the most OP perk since the machine gun perk combo. Toxic killer much?
---
The survivor side is always full of hypocrisy. I can't deny them survival but they can constantly deny me kills.
---
Survive With Friends
---
You can tell them to run BT so you won't be tunneled so fast
---
Nothing more comes to my mind
---
Ghostface is king
---
I know that, but the reason they take longer is the whole madness thing. I usually get to around purple ranks (queue times are a bitch on xbox) and surprisingly some survivors are still shitty at the skill checks.
---
Huh, that's weird. I thought that only played on Haddonfield. Oh well! Durp durp durp, repair the gens.... don't forget to teabag in front of him!
---
Okay I only have two friends who play and they’re usually playing poker xD
---
You shouldve had a look at her ass. What a missed opportunity.
---
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen
---
Wait you did dark senses with out dark sense?
---
Michael spent 15 years AFK, but tonight, he comes home.
---
I see you don't trust my math.
---
Go look it up: the cumulative chance of unhooking yourself in 6 tries with 8 percent is exactly as I told you
---
It's end*ear*ing to hear that from you, but I think we'll have to *cut* this short and *part* ways. I'm not sure where this is *headed*...
---
Yeah, hex perks aren't OP in any way mate. I run detectives hunch and can get all 5 totems by the third gen. NOED never even comes into play. 
---
 I do agree with how stupid it is that killer mains facecamp for being looped. What is the survivor supposed to do, stand still when they've been seen?
---
Damn thats wierd
---
Bruh imagine saying that ruin is a broken perk.
---
not actually, lets say the game lasts only 6 minutes, first u dont get full xp, u will most likely get little bp, and safety pip maybe, its more used to make the killer depip than anything else, imagine that u have to "entertain" the entity, u have to make the trial interesting, not just a race to the gates

Image being that bad that you think ruin is op. I can't belive people have that bad eye hand coordination
---
Iron will and an exhaustion perk of your liking should at least help you to lose them. DS isn’t always a safe bet imo
---
As the killer you control the match. Who lives, who dies, that's all your choice based on who you Chase and who you ignore and which person gets the hatch. As a survivor you have very little control which leads to doing the only thing that gives you control: acting out. You get the killers attention my being an obnoxious shit and then you play 1v1 against him. You have a lot less control if you just work gens.
---
At least this is my thought whenever I see people clicking flashlights and making noise on purpose.
---
Low key haven’t played this game in a year and I’m not even sure why I still follow this subreddit goodnight y’all
---
What exhaustion perk do you prefer?
---
No, I'm just saying that each chance is only 8%. I get where you're coming from, but if some dumbass survivor reads what you said, they will legitimately believe they have a 40% chance to get off the hook and will try it, not realizing that each subsequent attempt does not add another 8% to them getting off the hook. So each try is still only 8%.
---
I'm not opposed to a nerf but even  suggesting they should remove keys and shit is dumb.
---
Look. I dont mean to be rude. I need to stop bitching at people I dont agree with. I disagree with you. I'm sorry. I'm just a dick and I need to better myself. I'm an example of how shitty people in this community can be
---
Yet both can be disabled by cleansing
---
Should have just left
---
Pretty sure she tried to sandbag the Ace
---
I've always referred to him as that lol
---
I've been playing it today and it is AMAZING
---
I don't mind. They pay my favorite youtubers.
---
If she come in DBD she gonna be one of the survivors that I main for sure
---
Nice blood points. I’m praying we get double bloodpoints so I can get this p3 level 50 trophy
---
I did but I didn't see anything
---
That's good I hope you continue to have a wonderful experience in the fog!!!!!!! \(^^)/
---
I'm red ranks and my queues are almost always 2 minutes or less. I typically play at 10pm CST or later but I've never experienced that long of a queue time....
---
Ok 1st of all, just hit your skillchecks. It's not that hard if you're good at the game. 2nd, detectives hunch is literally made for finding totems like noed and ruin. 3rd, if you're good at looping you'll be able to distract the killer so your team can open the gates, or so they can break the totem.
---
Killers have a steep learning curve compared to survivors. Also, you have to be really reststant against any kind of frustration. If you're not, don't play killer.
---
How was he a bad influencer that killed Fortnite?
---
The extra money will be great for dbd. But I definently don't want a child who entertains other children to have some goofy clickbait dbd content plastered all over YouTube or Reddit. 
---
Too comment is right tho
---
trapper, base killer so everybody got him, agitation its the important thing, if u have mad grit or iron grasp can use it but u dont need it, my build was bbq, ruin, agitation, whispers, trapper sack. first trap the hell around basement, hook someone and let altruism do the rest, trappers basement is really good, an offering for a map with basement in the center may be good too, and try a lot, bc its not a normal thing to sacrifice 4 in basement,u need more luck than anything else
---
I really love hillbilly and huntress
---
Who do you like
---
You shouldn't care what killers or survivors have to say on how you play, if you want to play to win and be efficient just hit them. If you want to make sure everyone is having a good time maybe not do it as it could be considered a "dick move". But I would just hit them, if someone is unhooking in your face without any perk to help them that is not your problem, you're only capitalizing on their mistake.
---
So basically instead of survivors not knowing when you are phasing while they are close to you, they always know?
---
I play hag bc I love her mori lmao but I'm super good with wraith, legion and bubba (cannibal)
---
There's nothing wrong with it. Don't let a survivor tell you how to play
---
Not another ochido 2.0 pls- thx in advance
---
Ok thanks. It’s just that I’ve played five games and gotten seven messages, it’s insane
---
i don’t know what you just said but ok i guess
---
1, you have literally no idea if he specifically unreadied to put those things on. You are just speculating. 
---
 2, he wasn't trolling you at the end, he moved you from the bushes to an open area so he could actually see his mori. 
---
 3, I don't care about the t-bagging, as most killer mains will argue that t-bagging is more toxic to the game than facecamping is, which it isn't. 
---
 So yeah, the killer wasn't being toxic, but you definitely trying to make them out to be one by "claiming" to know they unreadied to put new perks on.
---
I believe we should try to ‘stream snipe’ him: when he plays survivor we join as survivor and lead killer to him, if we are killer we only kill him.
---
Hitboxes in most games are circles. See smash bros as an example.
---
Sorry i am on mobile
---
so if tydetyme say rub ur nipples u will?
---
no she still had the medkit, my guess is she was probably trying to recover while downed, not noticing right away that she got picked up from Adrenaline.
---
&gt;just hit greats
---
Ok, let’s do it this way.
---
“Ffs I got genrushed again, toxic survivors piss me off so much! 4 toolboxes, toolboxes need to be nerfed!!” 
---
Just use Franklin’s lol.
---
Fucking shit logic
---
I like hags traps and if u don't mind how do I get a Mori???
---
They buffed dark sense, now when any gen pops, you see the killer,
---
to be fair, if i dont find the person who unhooks them, but i come in contact with the person whose been hooked, i just smack them and leave them slugged n go off to find someone else. 
---
mainly because i find it to be annoying cuz most people choose to unhook when killers nearby and then run off without taking a hit or getting the killers attention.
---
Legion time.
---
Seems like kind of a Spirit thing, too
---
As hilarious as this would be, pretty sure you'd get EAC banned.
---
See the mistake is that you started the game, survivors want to come in, fix generators in peace and peacefully leave, alive by sunrise was fine before you toxic killers came and ruined it ! ^^^^/s
---
Wow, what a movie...
---
Trust me you will get a lot of comments. I play very competitively so I do "dick moves" all the time and I have gotten a lot of comments on my profile thanks to it.
---
You can just use Franklin's. That's just being smart. Stop complaining and take your losses.
---
Well i don't team on mic. Solo survivor red rank is harder than killer red rank.
---
It’s a tie between lithe and sprint burst!
---
With Jake? 😏
---
The title sounds like a new Tru3 video (not a good thing btw)
---
Imagine taking anything that TydeTyme says seriously
---
Here's the thing mate. If you immediately go for the person unhooked, and let the other person go, it's considered tunneling, and is a dick move. If you swung at both and hit that person, it's just bad luck for them. 
---
 To not be seen as a tunneler, but still cause chaos, knock them down, but don't hook them. Instead start chasing the unhooker. This will immediately take 2 people off gen progression. And because that downed person will now need help up, someone on a gen will need to leave and help. You've now slowed gen progress by 75%. This will help you 4k games without being seen as someone who tunnels.
---
Actually, he's somehow even worse than they are so I would rather worry about the current players
---
BHVR has yet to "bend the knee" to any streamer.  Tru3 has been harassed by a stream sniper for months on end.  Why assume they'll "bend the knee" to Ninja
---
There's nothing wrong with it, but I also feel like you shouldn't complain about salt when you choose to play in a way that you KNOW is frustrating to go against.
---
😖😖💔
---
Speaking from a survivor standpoint; it's just not fun. You want to at least have a fighting chance before your second or third hook. From a killer point of view; it makes sense. I tend to slug if I don't find the rescuer, so they'll have a chance. Getting rid of the survivors too fast also denies quite some chase points
---
What did you do though?
---
“Master Skywalker there’s too many of them”
---
You get them in your blood webs you have 3 different ones:
---
Cypress mori (yellow) which allows you mori the last person left alive 
---
Ivory mori (green) which allows you to mori one person who's been hooked at least once during any time in the game
---
Ebony mori (pink) which allows you to mori all survivors who've been hooked at least once in trial.
---
You can also use devour of hope (hag perk) When a Survivor is rescued from a Hook at least 24 metres away, Devour Hope receives a Token.
---
2 Tokens: Gain a 3/4/5 % Haste Status Effect 10 seconds after hooking a Survivor, for a duration of 10 seconds.
---
3 Tokens: Survivors suffer from the Exposed Status Effect.
---
5 Tokens: Grants the ability to kill Survivors by your own hand.
---
The Hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Totem is standing.
---
Rancor is a spirit perk but it essentially does the same thing as a cypress. You become obsessed with one Survivor.
---
Each time a gen is completed, the obsession sees your aura for 5/4/3 seconds.
---
Each time a Generator is completed, all Survivors' locations are revealed to you for 3 seconds.
---
Once all Generators are completed, the Obsession has the Exposed Status Effect and the Killer can kill the Obsession.
---
You can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time
---
Well it doesn't look like the survivors were exactly losing. Seeing as all 4 are still alive and there are 2 survivors who weren't even hooked yet with all gens already finished.
---
Are you on the xbox version, I've seen that R4's name before
---
Unless your heart is set on Ash, ghost face is probably the better choice. Ash's perks are really nothing special but ghost face is a fun killer.
---
I got kicked from a game last night because it said I lost internet connection, despite still talking to my friends in my playstation party, and I depipped. Not sure what's going on.
---
OhPedo. New one for Tofu, right?
---
Yeah I think it’s only the second time survivors hear the jingle they go “aw shit”. The first jingle is just kind of letting everyone know it’s a Myers.
---
You should want more people playing the game and making it more popular. You sound like a manchild who is threatened by children.
---
Poor Jason. Put under spotlight and performance pressure.
---
Helpful
---
This whole thread is cringe as fuck. Do people not understand that the more popular the game is, the better it is for literally everybody?
---
If I get tilted from playing killer I take a break and play survivor or another game. You play worse when you're in a bad mood.
---
Yeah, I've seen that R4 a few times too
---
Basically people are gonna be like "do what you want bro" and then they're creat rant posts and they're gonna complain and tell people to stop camping and tunneling. Lol.
---
Sae the title, checked for STBFL
---
That's all she wrote
---
That's gonna be a yikes from me dawg.
---
It was only when this happened to me on a rare survivor game that I understood. Now when I play Michael and I see this, I tunnel the player who unhooked into the fucking ground. Play fair, this isn't a single player game!
---
Oh ok cool thank you very much!
---
Oh thats evil, i wanna try it...
---
This meme had potential but I stopped reading at "OP perks" when referring to totems.
---
That's gon be a yikes from me dawg
---
No problem!!!!
---
For what it's worth I play xbox and I always throw at least one player a nice message after a match. Usually someone makes a stand out play, and if not I just tell the killer he was real scary, even if I managed to escape.
---
And yeah, I do get a fair amount of "fuck yous" but whatever, I can't help them be happy so I don't stress too much.
---
This man is too dangerous to be kept alive
---
As if it’s even possible to add to the toxicity this community already thrives on? We have community big names who’s persona is based on being “toxic” and annoying. This one person’s presence will not add anything y’all weren’t doing before. 
---
I don’t even like this guy but this smells like a serious case of “Fortnite guy bad” and that’s right up there with “streamer man bad, Mori and tunnel good”
---
It would also be a terrible system to base it on player level and not rank. Player level is just an indication of how long you've been playing, doesn't necessarily mean you've gotten better in all that time.
---
And if that was the case why even have ranks to begin with?
---
She's interviewing her replacement
---
Happened to me recently. Rank 15 or so killer up against three red ranks and one survivor that was actually also a yellow rank. Really demoralizing to get looped like mad.
---
For wanting one chance to give him a taste of his own medicine?
---
In most games the hitbox(circle) is divided up into a bunch of small pieces like a separate one for each leg and they hug the model closely. Having one static continuous circle is a little different and I wouldn't have expected that.
---
I’m really competitive as killer, I want to get to Rank 10 (currently 12) and it seems possible, but it seems that the survivors disagree with my playstyle
---
In every country people you consider minorities come from people love jokes that you'd consider racist. Yes, even in Israel.
---
"Only" rank 6. Nah man be proud, rank 6 means you're pretty good at killer. If you're rank 6 you've been playing against red rank SWF's for a few ranks now. It's harder to rank up as killer than survivor.
---
Poggers Maybe he will crank some 90s on the killer
---
I have to admit I laughed but I'm fat so it's ok.
---
I don't disagree with that, I felt I was proving your point.
---
Even with the gimicky build, you are less than 50-50 to get off the hook provided you even get your 6 tries
---
did it say 'after dark' anywhere on the screen? past a certain time in the day, Ninja plays different games, swears and drinks since its later and hes more likely to have a more mature audience, with less kids
---
I agree. Moris and keys are not fun to play against but they are fun to play with yourself
---
Casual reminder that Ninja can't slice of bread to save his life.

---
You are pathetic buddy you made a new reddit account to complain on this reddit. You live in your parents basement still?
---
I was agreeing with yours in a way. It is, with each attempt added, a 40% chance of getting off the hook, but newer survivors need to know that each attempt is still only 8%. We know someone will read that math and actually like those odds.
---
If you want to play like a scum don't complain when others end up flaming you for it. 
---
No one likes unfair players.
---
You're right but it might have to do with how good the survivor is.
---
Doesn't mean you're good at the game. If you're the first to die, that probably means something.
---
I used to hate Ruin too, found it super hard until....it wasn't so bad anymore. Pass the checks, pause for a couple of seconds (to avoid a double check) and then carry on. It was pretty satisfying and fun.
---
All his fans are gonna be rank 20s, o could care less since I’d never play with/against them. Only white/brown ranks would care lol
---
The newest killer the tactical marine
---
Reach. Influence. Market. Money.
---
yep, looks like u found the first easter egg
---
Let's intentionally make a streamer's life a living hell because *he's* the toxic one.
---
Wanting to harass Ninja is hypocrisy at it's finest
---
Yeah lol, the moment the survivor quitted he managed to escape to the hatch
---
Didn’t say I was good but it’s not I die first every time I play I’m saying specifically today I have been. Nobody asked you for your negative sir/ma’am/it/Apache attack helicopter with dual cannons
---
Yeah i know, thanks gods i'm not one of them
---
Holy shit, I was a kid once too!
---
But yeah, some kids get hyper-focused into certain games and can be fucking awesome. We're living in a dangerous time, my friend.
---
Yeah but if you are kinda far away you cant hear that shit.
---
You just hear VHRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
He used a motorized weapon once. It was like a buzz saw on a weed whacker.
---
Freddy doesn’t make a noise right away.
---
The killer he is using is called The Shape (aka Michael Meyers). His ability is that he stalks survivors from a distance to feed his power, and his power levels up his tiers. He has 3 tiers of power - tier one he is slower but his terror radius is very small making it easier to stalk survivors. Tier 2 he is regular speed but has a larger terror radius. And when he is in tier 3 all survivors are exposed, meaning he can down them in one hit. 
---
In this particular video, he is using an add-on called tombstone, which allows him to kill any survivor just by grabbing them when he is in tier 3. This is an "ultra rare" add-on so you don't see it often. The perk he is running to block the exit gates is bloodwarden, which the blocks survivors from leaving the exit for a certain period of time after you've hooked a survivor. Its a super situational perk, you only really see it in builds where killers are doing something specific like this video. 
---
Imo Meyers is the best killer in the game. Between tombstone and a different add-on of his called scratched mirror, he has easily the funnest/most interesting builds in the game.
---
&gt; had he not actually started back then or...?
---
Month or months ago he was simply playing DBD because his GF asked him. Didn't look like he was enjoying it as much as her. 
---
Now it looks like he is giving the game a fair try.
---
Quality shitpost tbh.
---
I do enjoy the you added the Entity Displeased shot in there, showcasing that this is not an encouraged way to play to rank up, haha.
---
If he gets moris and keys removed or nerfed I'll become a ninja subscriber for as long as I play the game.
---
I know I say “Aw fuck” when I hear it.
---
Most people do it on Billy because survivors spawn on the other side of the map so you can use Whispers plus your fast as fuck movement speed to zoom to the other side and find someone hella fast.
---
How do u remove the shadows and fog of the map/game ? Your game looks soo clean
---
Survivor: Kate. When she got the Ski outfit last winter, it was the deciding factor to make her my main. The whole climbing axes on her side was awsome.
---
Killer: Will probably get shit for this, but I started with Nurse when I picked this game up. I love Silent Hill, and I thought she was from that franchise when I started playing this game. Now I love showing off my Nurse skills, even after her rework.
---
The 3 medkits in the lobby were the reason she got summoned
---
His point is, noob3 is just as bad as Ninja so the backlash against Ninja makes no sense.  If you want to remove toxic streamers then Noob3 should be treated the same as Ninja.  Except you guys aren't doing that
---
did anyone think it could be completed this way?
---
Wow, fun, interactive perks done with balance in mind and all three share a cool theme. Best survivor concept I've seen since I can remember.
---
Thats why I quit playing dbd but I still keep getting back to it, its like a god damn drug
---
It's the excuse killer main makes when they can't hunt efficiently. 
---
As it turns out, however, this is usually happens because they've been tunnelling one skilled survivor or camping them.
---
I don’t see it as playing like scum if I’m punishing a horrible play. Why unhook when the killer is right in front of you? If they wait 20 seconds I would’ve been gone and they would’ve been Scott free
---
Hey I thought of the same idea did you copy me?
---
Yeah I just find it weird that I’ve never been Gen rushed despite playing against many red rank teams
---
that just means that multiple people contribute to the channel, not that everyone in the video was a ~paid actor~ or whatever the fuck lmao
---
I like Killer Catcher. .
---
Those are all good for the game. Of BHVR """bends the knee""" then the problem lies with BHVR, not Ninja
---
Ah thanks for clarifying. I definitely wouldn't have expected that either
---
Thegame says "Entity Displeased" but I'm willing to believe the Entity was having a heck of a time watching this.
---
cry
---
nah, he only draws 4 timers in the hud and spawns like 10 nightstands in all the map
---
There is a tutorial and it rewards you some BPs.
---
honestly depending on the hours played by these people they might just think dude's a bot with the stalk button pressed, or someone that had to poop who left something on that button. idek how i'd react in this situation tbh.
---
It’s kinda sad that these posts get more views than on your youtube channel! I love your content on youtube, heres a sub from one of your new reddit friends!
---
Head canon, huntress was on her way to a furry con but wound up at a horror con instead.
---
&gt;Clown, nurse, leatherface, and hag teachables. So he just happen to have all them leveled up or got those from the shrine
---
He could easily be a survivor main who rarely touches killer but spends bloodpoints on them.
---
Wait a few rank resets without playing killer and you'll find yourself at rank 16 ~ 20. 
---
Not necessarily a smurf since like the other user said, you can't manually derank below 15 or 16.
---
No idea what you're talking about.
---
Shouldve tbagged again like once or twice after hook
---
Bending the knee to ninja for those things is where the problem is. Ha e you seen him play? He gets carried by red ranks he's spams flash lights and tea bagged. Do you want him deciding the future of the game?
---
I use A1p headphones
---
The Ghost Busters are coming to DBD
---
Are you saying just because they were healed that they wernt hooked?
---
MAYA FAHUR DINGIR BOKUWA

Uh you sure? They are very different

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eeiz56/information_regarding_matchmaking_dev_stream_1218/
---
i just put my setting on low
---
I'd find this too challenging though for survivor. Imagine someone like spirit literally walking up and pulling you off the gen making you have to gen tap. Let alone you never get a heads up and unless your running spine chill. Let's say your working on a double C loop. There's almost no way to spot her. Shit imagine how strong Bubba could be since he can hide the stain and get so close there could no time to counter play his chainsaw. For this game, the terror radius is a must and made so. Unless they do some major workaround.
---
So I have no particular opinion on ninja, but I like that each post I see lowers the age of his audience. Looking forward to warning of ninja and his army of fetuses.
---
Incubus fan?

&gt;Horvath - There are some instances where a lobby will no longer... I'm gonna try to be vague about this, I'm sorry. There are some situations where a lobby will get the incorrect rank for the killer. We are looking into this. But that ends up having a result on the killer you're gonna have. So the killer might be rank 20 playing against rank 1s and there is a bug in our system that just didn't match up correctly. We are looking into this. We are not gonna have it fixed before Christmas. Some time next year... Whenever. We are going to be able to get that done and it should be better. That's an issue with our system at the moment and not an actual desired design.
---
&gt;Horvath - High-ranked killers can also be matched against low-ranked survivors because of how the SWF matchmaking system currently works, which is also something that the design team are looking into and may or may not get changed.
---
The F13 game is dead. 
---
Besides, the copyright holders will want money for the franchise as soon as it’s open, and allowing a F13 dlc as soon as the next movie is ready to go is great publicity.
---
Yeah....I can see why the game turns into toxic mess when the devs themselves using camping to secure a hit. 
---
But once again Karma process that she's one hell of a mean B.
---
Yes I agree they are different. But some people who are still relatively new or people who dont go against both of them a lot can't tell the difference.
---
She has been with him since before the streaming. What an ignorant comment
---
Smoke signals is a great perk imo.
---
I didn’t think she could get any cuter. You just proved me wrong ;-;
---
Apparently the judge on the case will make a tilting next July, on the appeal. Hopefully that will settle it.
---
So he plays like every other Survivor?
---
Hey Whoopi, didn’t let me get my challenge tho did you.
---
The only thing to make it better were if it were spelled out with Serial Killer Magazine lettering
---
“don’t call people out for using lazy stereotypes in their fanmade content, it’s very offensive!” 
---
-reddit, apparently
---
Boy do I want Jason on. He’s the o.g. for me.
---
That can be a legitimate strategy, though. If you‘re confident enough and have the skills to back that up you can get the Killer‘s attention that way and run them around for a gen or two.
---
Also if I‘m being honest I feel way more in control when I‘m playing Survivor, especially in SWF. I only have the feeling of not being in control when I‘m vs‘ing a god-like Spirit or Nurse and even then the Killer earned the 4k. If you chase someone as a Killer there are 3 others that impact the Survivor‘s side and on the other side if you‘re being chased there are 3 more people progressing the game. Control lies inherently in the Survivor team‘s hands hence why people are saying it‘s the power role.
---
I think it has more to do with how I‘m used to Survivors like that as a Killer and they in turn influence my behaviour as a Survivor. I always think it‘s funny as a Killer and don‘t understand why anyone would get upset at Survivors like that. I think it‘s funny that there‘s someone who‘d be angered by me rapidly crouching or spamming m2 with a flashlight.
---
And he’s been like that before streaming. Use your brain.
---
Aha I love doing this especially with totems. If they trap a totem and I disarm the trap and hide, 9/10 times they're drop what they're doing and rush back to defend their totem, can't find anyone and so they retrap it and leave. Wash rinse repeat. Also works with thrill of the hunt. It's heaps fun
---
just legion things tho
---
Literally just me. I used to go to furry cons but now I go to horror cons lmao
---
Ah a fellow legion main.
---
I don't get it.
---
Joke (n.)
---
A thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter.
---
With the fact that I get survivors 8 ranks above me constantly, and that everyone is trying to do these challenges, I started just farming. Its not fun to go against people who are rank 1 when I am still purple, and everyone wants their survivor challenges done.
---
Two birds one stone.
---
Tbh I don't mind if they add Jason, so long as he is scary lol... Maybe if they add the babadook or penny wise perhaps
---
It had other issues too. Like “Died early? Sit thru the whole match or lose 1/2 Xp.” Or waiting for a match takes double what DBD does. And the proximity chat results in more abuse than its worth. 
---
For me, sitting around or losing Xp and getting bullied was the deciding factor.
---
Assuming that guy DC'd while you were carrying them/picking them up? That usually messes up a lot of things for killers, broken animations and buggy powers and whatnot.
---
Everyone else is rank 15 and 14 and I’m rank 9
---
I guess I’m a billy main so I know my saw lol
---
I go to fur cons but want to go to film festivals for horror.
---
I'll try and provide a quick explanation because it is very amusing. It's a multiplayer game where there's one killer and 4 survivors. Killers objective is to kill the 4 survivors. He does this by hitting them twice with his knife and then putting them on a hook, he has to do this three times to kill them usually. The survivors objective is to repair 5 generators to open a door and escape, this was the large area during parts of the video where they were behind the brick pillars. Survivors have no way of fighting back. There are different powers and objects for the Killers you can pick to change the way the game is played. The killer in the video is Michael Myers from the Halloween movies and the way you use him is by holding down a button while looking at the survivors to build up his power. In the video he has an object that allows him to just immediately grab and kill a survivor without having to hook them three times. So this player stood there pretending to be away from his keyboard, in other words not playing, so that the survivors thought he wasn't a threat. He then built his power up and once he realized they had let their guard down all of a sudden started playing and grabbing them and just immediately killing them. This most likely would have led to some very shocked Survivor players.
---
Your average doesn't do that. He's worse he constantly insults and cries stream sniping whenever he loses.
---
I ask again, do you want 1 streamers. 1 toxic piece of filth who has in the past attempted to get players banned for being better than him? This is the guy who on fortnite live on stream got outplayed told the person to leave and he wouldn't get them banned the refused and he did try, by actively calling his lacky in the company right there on camera then realizing AFTER he started dialing the camera was on and pretended he was texting instead. Do you REALLY want HIM controlling the future of the game? Because he is so influential they will likely do anything he wants
---
Stab gang HQ
---
Ohh. Wow. I deserve a wooosh then
---
I got put into a game with people who are much lower ranks than I am
---
that happens when you enter to another ps4 app like gallery for example
---
It's an add-on.
---
Y e s
---
Yo, you're saying *ruin* is a crutch perk? NOED I understand but fuckin *ruin*??? Lmao
---
I agree. Although I hope that they revert his flick.
---
To each their own, not my thing but as long as it isnt shoved down our throats on the main sub its alright
---
Is she speed hacking towards the end?
---
&gt;Everyone else is rank 15 and 14 and I’m rank 9, I don’t know about you but that’s a bit of a difference
---
Up to +6-6 ranks difference is intended by the devs. This is nothing but normal matchmaking, which is why I don't get what is so special about it.
---
It’s the add on “bloody coils” every time a healthy survivor disarms a trap, they are put into the injured state.
---
its a trapper add on, makes you take damage upon disarming a trap
---
How do they not immediately know what's happening when you hit tier 2?
---
bloody coil
---
Farming is extremely boring. You will earn BP anyway from just playing the damn game.
---
To elaborate on u/TheSleepyPanda 's comment, if disarming the trap brings up a red (slower) progress bar that means either 2 things, the trapper is using the addon that slows down the trap disarming time or the trappet is using the red addon, Bloodied Coil (i think its called), that slows the disarming time and injures the survivor that disarms a trap
---
6 ranks apart seems like a bit much
---
I respect your opinion, but personally I enjoy a match where you can mess around with the killer like dancing with them, spinning in circles, all the shebang.
---
The killers you are playing with are not the best.
---
Pewdiepie has apologized for the n-word thing and "kill the jews" which was not meant to be taken serious btw. Are you really gonna hold something he did years ago against him for the rest of his life? That's pretty pitiful my dude. But never mind that, lets adress the "iron cross". Its not an iron cross, but a Georgian Bolnisi Cross with Georgian characters next to it. Stop reading biased clickbait articles and look into stuff yourself. 
---
About the donation to ADL, it was his sponsor Honey that advised him to donate despite that ADL is anti-free speach and has targeted pewdiepie before. His fans reacted to this very negatively and thought of it as ADL blackmailing pewdiepie. That's why he **cancelled** the donation, not taking back money. I cant say much about the "bigoted" people you talk about but I'll take tha statememt with a grain of salt considering all the bullshit you've said. Please, do your own research next time and have a good day.
---
Hag exists to throw off survivor movements in loops with clever trap placement because the survivors camera is snapped towards he trap the teleporting is supposed to be the main use but let’s be honest with ourselves no one uses it for that alone.
---
