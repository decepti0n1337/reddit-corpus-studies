Trust Steve's hair
---
---
---
Oooo yes
---
Yeah I hope they get the flickering lights to work on all maps somehow it'll be awesome Im so excited Idk what to do lol
---
Freddy is better than Spirit? This ain’t it chief
---
Ah, I remember when mettle was actually useful.....
---
Bad luck. Someones internet commited no work. The most important thing though is that you do the bones. Props to you man! Finaly someone else that does the totems too.
---
I think we should have a Killer with possession. Maybe 4 mannequin on the map that can be possessed and set up in certain areas for the killer to surprise the survivors.
---
Basically, run around with one mannequin and if you know a survivor is working on a gen that's close to one of them, you can quickly posses and surprise them with it. Can't think of any good perks, but I think it would be a ton of fun to have a mechanic like that.
---
I could see that being the case
---
Trap me daddy uwu *steps in bear trap and gets slapped for STBFL stacks*
---
Soup is always fun! My power actually went out so I ended up making pasta on the grill ???
---
Most of this list is insane.
---

---
Plague and Trapper are bad, but still have a little potential if Survivors mess up. B tier. 
---
Legion is horrid and deserves to be down there with Leatherface. You’re just playing a violent version of tag. 
---
Pig and Doctor can do a good job at slowing the game down. A tier Killers there.
---
Spirit and Hag can make looping extremely difficult, if not impossible. They need to be SS tier.
---
Billy and Freddy can both be looped easily. Billy should be S tier while Freddy should be A tier. 
---
Wraith and Clown are underrated. Both can quickly end chases even though they struggle with map pressure. I’d put them at the end of A tier.
---
Not trying to catch any hate for this but I haven’t played in over a year.  I was a very good survivor and now I come back and the game feels completely different to me. Which is fine, change and progress are good but it seems to be worse and for me way less enjoyable.. do people tend to like the game more now or in its older states?
---
My ass is ready
---
I mean how could anyone possibly deny it after Netflix tweeted out that they are helping BHVR with a project?
---
Lmao I ain’t disappointed I like Stranger Things, we all knew this was coming. There’s a reason I have this flagged as a shitpost.
---
Mettle really just needed another hit or two to make it balanced. I'll die on the hill that they overnerfed it.
---
Maybe he’s showing what he has so like if you’d want to change something you know exactly which perks he has?
---
I’d say ditch self care for something else imo.  Bond or leader if you can find people.
---
and I wrote the original post before the trailer 
---
??!
---
Everyone saying Xenomorph should be next since there are non-human killers now
---
Meanwhile I'm waiting on a Pumkinhead dlc so we can have a backbreaker mori
---
This is what happens when you use memes the wrong way.
---
I was wrong though, I meant september 10th
---
Nah disappointment like in terms of release never coming, I'm hype as fuck for stranger things
---
My bad then.
---
But, the Dem also very animalistic.. we could see it down on all fours in the trailer. I've been wondering if that's going to be utilized or not.
---
Also added walk like an Egyptian cause why not
---
I don’t understand (maybe because I’m the op)
---
is it funny bc I was wrong? lol
---
Wraith’s speed boost after uncloaking can be helpful during chases.
---
Basically, all of the killers (besides Bubba) look silly hooking people.
---
Can’t wait for dedicated servers
---
im actually hyped as fuck for this, i havent played in a couple months just because i feel the game is a little stale at this point and i have no friends who play, solo really sucks, but this might just bring me back to the game for a little bit
---
I can be animalistic. I could do all the same movements he did in the trailer.
---
That Nancy doesn't look right
---
what’s not funny about it then?
---
I didn’t even use it with the intention of a meme. I just used the Robin picture to get people’s attention.
---
Admittedly, NOT my best gameplay lol by a longshot, but DYING on the SECOND hook? What even is that???
---
Keep pressure in an area. Let the farthest gens go and focus on the ones that you can easily patrol.
---
Imagine needing to make a second account
---
I'm disappointed. I love Natalia Dyer, she's so beautiful in real life, but this model look nothing like her. Well, at least they got Steve right.
---
I could imagine it being like old Freddy, where it pulls survivors into the upside down variant. And from what I saw on r/leaksbydaylight, a new status affect will be produced and the Demogorgon will most likely apply that affect to you while you are in the upside down.
---
But BHVR prefer their staling formulas.
---
IT. Pale Man. Chucky? A/P. Kane.
---
Exactly what does this mirror add on do?
---
Actually it’s just “pizza time”
---
And his entity vanishing would make sense in both of the lores aswell
---
Well Maya Hawke definitely accomplishes that.
---
What build would you guys recommend to get the Evil Incarnate achievement? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I don't play Myers a lot, just trying to get 100% achievements so I'm not sure what would be best.
---
what is that sub mean?
---
They didn’t get a license for Scream, they got they license for the GF costume
---
Still want a pyromaniac killer tho
---
Hag is human? Huh. TIL
---
It'll be a DLC
---
Everyone: NoW XeNoM0rpH is AlloWed!  
---
Me: Ellen Ripley Kreygasm
---
Just PC
---
Lol not surpised Nancy looks terrible. Not sure why its so hard for them to make a girl not look like she has FAS.
---
Why ruin the fun for others? The show is objectively good for having 3 seasons and another on the way. They also said the entity could evolve past what they feel.
---
Me: *makes tier list based on my opinion*
---
This sub: yeah screw your opinion check mine out
---
Sooooo many new victims! lol
---
Why not both? -An Ace, Ash, and Steve main
---
Evil Within let’s you see survivors through walls with the mirror

If you think about it last chapter the survivor’s got no perks and killers got 3. At the same time I think survivors are already loaded for perks so idk
---
Why does Jane have an orgasm every time she's injured?
---
I want to do gens but the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alearting the killer.
---
Lol bug
---
Maybe they will share perks.
---
Oh, okay
---
Bring Chucky
---
tbh this community is so greedy
---
The Entity has became a crutch for BHVR to do questionable things design-wise, such as imo poor map design. Still, I'm fairly hyped for the new chapter.
---
Did Joe and Natalia do the voices?
---
For all we know Nancy and Steve share perks. Just have to wait and see.
---
Well they didn't get three perks last Chapter so it sort of balances out
---
Was confirmed they have separate perks.
---
Well tell it to an op who ended friendship with ace
---
I'm just hoping these survivor perks significantly change survivor meta.
---
How so?
---
chill, dlc just revealed today...
---
&gt;Was confirmed they have separate perks.
---
Do you have a link for this confirmation? I haven't seen it yet.
---
The chapter before that survivors got 3 and killers got none (ash paragraph)
---
New DLC with more content than ever before was just announced, literally today, not even explained, demonstrated, or released, and people are already spamming media with their pet requests for killers/survivors/features they want the devs to do. 1) it's not our choice, 2) license overrides any desire the community or devs have, 3) even if the community did have sway on the decisions the devs make as far as planning for the game, I would hope most people would realize that gameplay and stability fixes as well as balance patches are much more important for the longevity and health of the game than new crossover content updates.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised even though only killer mains got a character last chapter
---
the joke part
---
L. E. G. A. L. Issues. Said a thousand times already.
---
Thats not peanits
---
I'm pretty sure every community will do that,smash does it more than any community,there's nothing wrong with requesting or hoping for certain characters
---
&gt; Pig does that. Not sure they would give a second killer the same ability. 
---
boy do I have news for you
---
F
---
Your point?
---
WHAT?! Literally a few days ago I was thinking yeah it'd be cool if the Demogorgon was in DBD and Steve Harrington as a survivor. Alright now, it'd be cool if I was rich. Well, see you broke losers I'll be rich in a few days.
---
5/10 not enough breasticles /s
---
Humanoids can be animalistic sometimes
---
It’s unlikely, but perhaps the demogorgan would place them in those wired walls in the upside down and plug the slug into their mouth. Like Will near the end of season one.
---
I wonder if the Demogorgon is to scale or if he was shrunk down just for the rendering. I thought it was some giant, tall MOFO but he's not much taller than the survivors. (Although he is hunched)
---
Can a Stranger Things fanatic chime in if the Demogorgon's height is correct?
---
demogorgon is an interdemsional monster
---
[removed]
---
She’s on that detective/journalist vibe in season 3
---
Freddy loves the kids, gimme some sugar!
---
Why are you using self care in 2019, I would replace it with borrowed and a medkit if you really wanna heal.
---
Steve’s hair is definitely season 2-3 though
---
And maybe Netflix will do something Dead by Dqylight
---
Technically Ghostface was still a chapter, which doesn't make any sense. But yeah, the Leatherface DLC was a paragraph.
---
Plz no indoor maps are garbage
---
Not all of them are here but you should find a decent amount of the banners: [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Category:Character\_galleries](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Category:Character_galleries)
---
Amanda will always be my baby. I’m get your to let some tentacle hentai lookin ass killer take that away from me.
---
If I had to take a guess of the next chapter isn’t original it will be Hellraiser
---
Steve's hair
---
Yup pretty much
---
Somebody fuck that mother fucker?
---
just get that bbq and chili for farming, that hex ruin to slow the game down just a little bit and the noed cause it is op and op is fun
---
Pumpkinhead and Ed Harley or bust!
---
That's what I'm thinking but of course the hook wouldn't be bad either.
---
What did this man say?
---
The thing would be absolutely terrifying to see running at you
---
with this chapter having 2 survivors that are already loved i guess Q times will be slightly better . so you won't remember the waiting when you hear it
---
Sure thing! So the premise of the show (at least the first season) is that these portals to another dimension are opening up around town. This dimension is a lot like their own except desolate and dark, so like an evil version. It’s referred to as “The Upside Down”. Within the Upside Down are creatures that want to get into the other/real world. These creatures of horrifying and nearly all out for blood. The Demogorgon is one of them which made its way out of the Upside Down to sort of wreak havoc on the residents. They’re more beasts or monsters than actual intelligent beings but they are smart in the same way a dog or other predatory animal can be smart.
---
add me raven47zero I'm lacking friends :P
---
I'm a killer main anyway so whatever
---
Hate the map offering. Switch it to autohaven or Macmillan and we’re cool.
---
Man they should have gotten cidney from scary movie played by ansa faris
---
Steve is a moron jock turned badass guardian. Nigh unkillable. Nancy is a bookish suburban girl turned badass journalist sharpshooter. Also nigh unkillable.
---
I would be for this but there is already a predator game coming out made by the devs of f13th iirc
---
We literally have a guy that burned alive and was so bad that not even Death wanted him and torments people in their dreams and one extra dimensional boi is too much?
---
He said for people to stop talking about Stranger Things on this sub and to "suck eachother off" and the other subreddits. Idk why he was so mad about it but a few of us kindly reminded him that is was a new DLC, to which he began cussing me out
---
Nancy and Steve are professional juggernauts, Steve physically and Nancy mentally
---
I’m hyped because this is gonna be another really viable map for Scratched Mirror (though I am of the opinion that SM is still viable in certain maps other than Gideon and Lery’s, such as Haddonfield surprisingly).
---
Not me. It’s not what Steve would want.
---
He's effectively been nerfed since hooks regenerate, though being able to leave only basement hooks was OP, so mayhaps it's better to just give him a different perk.
---
Ok hold your horses cowboy. This show is very simple and enjoyable. The other shows go very deep into thematics m, character development and top level drama. Stranger things is good yes. But no where near ok those levels.
---
I think you’re thinking of Birdbox lol
---
Lol sigh
---
Wow, sounds like he wasn’t loved as a child
---
I think that's true. I mainly play killer and the most I rank up the easier I find matches
---
its not the same
---
Me: That's something people want
---
Just watch the show. It’ll take you a week. It’s a good show and you’ll be missing out.
---
Smh no. We need the Creeper, Aww man chapter
---
Yes, they can. I'm not disagreeing with you, my whole point was just thinking about how that feature is going to be utilized or not.
---
You’re comparing apples to oranges. In their respective categories, they are the best or nearly the best at what they do, and ultimately what they do is entertain.
---
Not a chance.
---
F13 did ok up until the complaints about P2P servers and the eventual lawsuit that doomed its future content. I really felt like it was a good competitor to this game and the content that would have come was promising given the awesome reveals in the “Virtual Cabin”. Everything was just right with it, but bugs, glitches, P2P and the lawsuit killed it.
---
Yeah that was our general agreement
---
The trigger test. Get better at those checks.
---
Cuz Sony fucked up their Amazing franchise and wanted that MCU money.
---
Juggernaut in the "getting his ass kicked" category. Maybe he'll finally win another fight.
---
Not unless the owners of the rights didn't already have F13
---
If it was implemented, would the killer be able to hear it?
---
Holy shit you did it you crazy son of a bitch
---
The Clown is not really a Clown. He doesn't do clown shit and not trying to be funny.
---
Her name is Kuchesake Onna. Am I correct?
---
Shoulda worn the brown pants
---
I’m gonna be a Nancy main so I’m sure I’m gonna get mori’d a lot :(
---
as a pig and ghostface main i say 'know your fucking place,
---
 trash'
---
This is a pretty cool idea, but no one can hear you scream would just be an objectively better knockout. So one of those perks would need to be changed.
---
If you don't know, don't talk
---
Oof girl. You haven't even seen the beginning of it yet.
---
They should have just given a backstory for each member of the legion. (Susie, joe, Julie)
---
Just had an idea, what if he affected the lights above the generators?
---
I’m a fan of Nancy Wheeler and really wanted to be able to play as her as some kind of pipe dream since I started playing DBD. I was so sure we would only get Steve because of obvious popular demand but here we are. Why not Nancy? She is part of the main cast and actively fights with the kids. I’m super glad she got picked tbh.
---
Leveling up earns you iridescent shards which can be used to buy most survivors/killers
---
I already imagined the Killers Mori, Where the survivor turn around to look at the Creature and the killer goes On the Survivor and screams at it's Face as the Survivor look terrified when looking at it's Face, The Killer strikes and puts it's mouth into the Survivor Head...As the Survivor Scream, The killer just slowly rips it's head while the Muscles are still attached to the head and the Survivor drops headless and the Creature eats it and it Screams...Oh god that was a Long One
---
Just noticed that hahah
---
Its just not even to tbag for me. Blood warden kills me because I always try to make sure everyone escapes before leaving.
---
I really hope you’re joking
---
Looks like this is a match made in heaven. Back when the game was in it's earliest testing they had a concept for a killer called the Shrieker, and there was an image of it circulating around the internet. It kind of looked like this thing,  although it also could have been what the Hag was originally intended to be.
---
If you move your cursor in the killer select screen you can get a 'bug' where instead of playing with bottles you play with a chainsaw. It's the best way to play clown.
---
Nah it's just salt tbh
---
I really liked this. Cool format! Good job!
---
Basically, yeah. Dead by Daylight kinda owes a lot to Michael Myers- if it wasn’t for him, the game would’ve been dead a long time ago.
---
Black, purple black, deep black, dark purple or blood reddish black.
---
No, actually you shouldn't specify anything. SH2 isn't meant to be a good game. It isn't meant to be comfortable in any way. Quite the contrary, it's very easy to argue that no ending in SH2 is a good ending. In what is usually considered the best one, &gt;!Leave, there's still the issue of James being a literal murderer that will need to spend a couple of years in jail while trying to adopt a child, a big problem because he will have a lot of trouble to convince the judges that he didn't kidnap her in his way to Silent Hill, since she got there with the help of Eddie... who was literally murdered (albeit in self-defense, but good luck proving that) by James himself. It's not a good ending. James fucked up his life long time and no good ending is awaiting for him.!&lt;
---
If anything, a lot of people argue that &gt;!In Water is not a bad ending, more like the true ending, because James will not be able to live a normal life and he came to Silent Hill *especifically* to kill himself that way. His dead wife's body was already in the car, at the back seat. He stopped the car pointing it to the lake. He left the door open. He was planning to come back and drive it towards the lake. It's actually a quite known method of "double" suicide in Japan when someone fucks their life that much and wants to give life a hard reset, but doesn't want to do that without their spouses, so the person drugs them and puts them in the trunk/backseat/passenger seat while driving the car towards a huge body of water. While you may argue that this is not a valid solution for the problems of life, SH2 is not about healthy, heroic morals. It's about real people and the consequences of their life, scars and acts.!&lt;
---
Some can say that &gt;!Maria is the good ending, for example. Yes, he hasn't dealt with his co-dependence, he is still an aggressive person (altho he most probably still is in any ending) and he is still going to deal with everything again, entering the "cycle" of the town again even if he is out of it/won against it. But he has what he wanted, even if he does not have what he needed. He can finally have everything his heart wished for with Maria.!&lt;
---
The other ending is even more flavorful about the cycle and the other two are just silly. But what I want to say is, SH2 isn't about avoiding your problems. That's exactly what SH2 is not about. There is no good or bad way of playing the game, there's just the way you play it and the game is meant to be played that way.
---
The endings are not good, bad, neutral. Even in-game they aren't classified like that. They are not rewards, they are messages.
---
You just get the ending you are meant to get.
---
If you play it properly, ofc.
---
*Cackles in Carter*
---
Did they fix the shitty frame rate on console?
---
Well that answers that, thank you.
---
Haha, jokes aside, 2 killers in one chapter would be awesome
---
Wait until you solo que into a 3 man who all decide to rage quit at the same time lmfaooooo fun times.
---
Bro why is it so hard for this community to not be a piece of shit
---
I really hope you aren't.
---
i went through with every killer and played 2 games with every killer. this is the final list, tell me what you think and tell me your list.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Have you never watched the show?
---
From now until sometime in September, you could easily watch the first season where these two and the upcoming killer are introduced and given a decent amount of time.
---
anime bad haha
---
They’re still a couple, só season 1 definitely
---
And how did you know? Are you able to see the future? What horse should i bet on?
---
I actually just finished this series litterally an hour ago and come to reddit to see this. Yes. God, yes.
---
Leemogoogoon
---
Yeah especially with this new theme coming out it sounds cool and I don't wanna have to play one of the new characters just to hear it
---
Smh. I wanted Peter griffin to be the new killer but mk
---
If only we got Carl and the grocery store
---
The predator isn't a xenomorph
---
Get rekt by the whole dev team :D
---
Oh goodness. Let me prepare myself for the salt. 😩
---
im afraid thats *incorrect*
---
I am aware of this. But it is owned by the same company and LIKELY to appear in that game instead of DBD
---
You CAN buy SOME characters with one of the in game currency's called iridescent shards, but that takes allot of time and not all of the characters are available to buy that way. It's totally possible to enjoy the game with the base characters without buying any dlc at all but if you want a certain character or perk that a character has the best thing to do is buy the dlc that includes both the killer and survivor. Also if you're gonna start playing with no context I'd recommend watching some YouTubers or twitch streams to help you understand the meta.
---
we already have the nurse though? /s
---
papa pyramid head would be fantastic - but i feel like youd need to make James the survivor for it to make any sense... not that modern Konami cares...
---
...still crying over Silent Hills.
---
Gameplay, yes. Lorewise he was a OHKO machine. l personally would be super hyped for an RE dlc, but l get what u/DecutorR was trying to say
---
we all were dude, we all were :(
---
I'll be here when it does.
---
Your top 3 is fine, I'd put Huntress in the top 4 though. You can't mess with a good Huntress, the second she hooks somebody or thrilling tremors activates to tell her where you are the hatchets are coming.  Rest looks honestly reasonable.
---
This is how we could get Chucky. A two-foot doll throwing a full-grown dude onto a three-meter-tall hook makes no sense, but say, dragging a downed survivor to somewhere to perform the Shamballa ritual would make more sense
---
I guess parks and rec is too old for the stranger things crowd 🤣
---
Is no one gonna talk about the dancing Myers
---
Aight guess I’m a Steve main now
---
The early 2000’s called. They want their humour back.
---
no unpopular opinions allowed
---
Barb is the kenny of stranger things...or better yet the krillin. Either or 😂 and I love me some barb
---
So let's say an 8 year old sees that meme all over the comments on some fortnite video and says it or makes his own comment, he is now validating those ideas? Once a meme gets to a certain point no one cares how it got there or even what it means just that they are going to say it because its a meme. I personally don't think that makes them transphobic or that they are validating those ideas.
---
Don't tell that to the fish people trying to summon him in D&amp;D
---
Clair or Leon with Nemesis or Mr X!
---
Ah yes I'm sure all the toxic players are going to be much nicer now that new players are joining
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but I thought if you escaped the hook by yourself it automatically put you on death hook next time you’re hooked
---
-pop- *noice*
---
Survivors Chris, Jill, Claire, and/or Leon? Count me in!
---
But then it’s Hex Haunted Ground
---
🗿
---
Shut up and take my money. ALL of it. 😍😍😍
---
It's possible the game subtracts your "hook timer" even as you successfully Kobe, so if you Kobe right before you hit stage 2 (Either from time ticking down, or maybe even a successful Kobe secretly subtracts your meter) the game acts as if you were on second hook, and the next hook skips to deathhook.
---
Double fuck
---
Finger gun back at ya B)
---
Reddit motto ^
---
That’s... not bad. But it needs more RNG to balance just right
---
“Hold my beer” -Apex, probably
---
It’s not safe at all if you know how to play it.
---
The games like a decade+ old now so I don't think a spoiler is necessary, like how Vader is Luke's dad.
---
And yeah, I got what you meant, and you classified it right: There will never be a Evil Pope as a killer despite how cool it would be.
---
The Demogorgon has telekinetic powers similar to Eleven. It would be awesome if they incorporated that into its perks or the way it hooks survivors. Also...dat bitch is 9 feet tall according to the wiki page for ST
---
I just got one of those. tbag, 360, spam flashlight. until I got him on a fake pallet loop, then he just dc. LMAO those ppl are a joke
---
Look up friendship ended with mudasir
---
*Beats Rank 20 Killer as a Rank 1 Survivor*
---
"gg 2 ez lulz uninstall"
---
I don’t like him personally because there’s nothing intimidating or interesting about him relative to the other killers, and his power is lame. Games against him are almost always boring, watching people play him is boring, and playing him is boring.
---
Ill be back to this post 0_0 i will be back
---
Depends on who's killing her.
---
I was always a bigger fan of the spinoff horror series with Herbert. The way he says, “Would you like a... popsicle?” Sends chills down my spin, truly Mr. McFarlane went above and beyond with his acting talents for that movie.
---
We're discussing how sad your life is. If someone was making up nonsense about my life I'd just dip. But since I'm right, you're upset and can't drop the subject.
---
Huntress should be first in tier A
---
The only thing I dont agree with on this list is Legions placement. He's definitely lower tier than Bubba and Wraith.
---
Thats how I felt about Ash lol
---
Pics or it didnt happen
---
I’m just looking forward to terrifying new players with Myers. And it’s probably for the best- shitting yourself during your first Myers experience is a big part of any survivor’s career.
---
That's fair, how about I make it hooked survivors can you can't see their Aura when you are a certain distance?
---
Ah okay, my mistake. 
---
I didn’t know it was confirmed. 
---
That’s awesome!
---
Oh yea, I’m more of a spooky music type, but it was fun to tackle the joke songs too. Nurse, Ghost Face, Wraith, Spirit ghost gang united under the Canopy.
---
Thank you !
---
I've been following the game since it's release and am subscribed to Ohmwrecker who has a lot of content on DBD so I'm all prepared. 
---
If you have to buy dlcs to get some perks, doesn't that make the game a bit P2W ?
---
Do Jeepers Creepers!!
---
M O N E Y
---
I said I could, never said I did
---
They have already introduced it. Once a survivors dc/actually played out matches tip further into the dc side the temp ban starts at one week, and if it continues it can go up to three weeks and if I remember right from there you get permabanned
---
what? it just said that he was coming back because of it.
---
Then you're wrong. It doesn't matter who is using it or how they're using it, it's still not an appropriate joke.
---
uhhh
---
Yes.
---
That would actually be pretty powerful if it isn't a swf and you get someone in a far corner
---
No one gets caught by Pig's dash unless they're rank 20 though
---
That my friend is called “dead-hard”
---
Ah yes, but don’t forget about the classic trio- Michael, Freddy and Leatherface. They’ve yet to get anything. Though Netflix seem like the kind of company to be more willing to do additional cosmetics- I guess New Line Cinema and Compass International are harder to budge in this regard.
---
Next Tuesday probably
---
i was kinda thinking it would be like the h3h3 dlc over at payday 2
---
Three perks but based on a new mechanic where its like an obsession, but for survivors instead. A close bond mechanic if you will.
---
Dunno how’d it work out though
---
I guess so. Do you have any suggestions?
---
The tutorial needs to show new players these features.
---
Survivors:
---
- how to properly use flashlights for blinds/saves
---
- all survivors are the same, no different stats
---
- how to stun killers
---
- how to cleanse totems
---
- what a hex totem is
---
- what status effects are (mangled, hemorrhage, exposed)
---
Killers:
---
- not to tunnel or face camp
---
I need it!
---
I'm just disappointed that there won't be dedicated Oceania servers for me to play this on
---
Wait, that wasn't Jane?
---
We rarely get an op killer and right now I'd say we have a total of one op killer, so its not a huge worry of mine lol
---
*SLAP*
---
You dropped this \
---
What is it you don't like about it now? I first played for a few months very sparsely back when it was free for ps4 plus members (late 2017 I think) and I stopped playing for a long time until right around when ghost face was released earlier this year. The one thing that I didn't like coming back was the sheer amount of knowledge you need of opponents perks and abilities. To play against every new killer, you have to know their basic abilities plus the add-ons they have that change how they work. Same goes for playing survivors but there aren't many game changing survivor perks, and all being teachable, none are as obscurely know as say an ultra rare legion add on which players seldom face. Having been playing religiously (shoutout plague cult) for a few months, and playing killer and survivor, less often am I surprised and it's no longer overwhelming. Of course if I were playing from day one, this wouldn't have ever be the case.
---
Not really because you can acquire them on the shrine (4 rotational perks that resets every week) but yeah thats rly RNG and we mostly get trash on there anyways lol
---
I’m a fucking ghostface main so watch your corners
---
Much as I love a good bit of sarcasm, she wasn’t injured, my friend.
---
It is a bit overrated I think, but honestly the whole concept of something being overrated is kinda silly.  It’s not that everyone is giving the show 11/10 or something, it’s that most people like it and end up recommending it so it gets a lot more notoriety and this huge reputation builds up.  It is a good show
---
You got it wrong boyo
---
Two factors;
---
1) Disney.
---
2) (The Big One) Sega own the rights to Alien video games and Alien appearances in video games. So, uh... why would they lend the rights to BHVR for DBD?
---
Doesn't matter if it's a Chapter or Paragraph (and even then Ghostface is labeled a Chapter even though it's really just a Paragraph), but that it's three licensed DLC in a row and is similar in release to the first time it happened (Paragraph, Chapter, Chapter) after four original chapters in a row which would've been a good spot to drop a licensed DLC somewhere in the middle to keep a mix of original and licensed instead of having a period of license stuff then a period of original stuff.
---
r/aged like milk
---
And i oop-
---
Okey, thanks.
---
I just noticed how much DLCs there is lmao. I hope they will make some special offer with this new release.
---

---
Sprint burst I frames.  
---
Gotta love balance :)
---
WE NEED CASH! I CAN'T KEEP EATING THIS SHIT!
---
Weeb
---
People were only saying that because that’s what the devs said before. I don’t understand why everyone’s giving people shit for believing what the devs said lol
---
Uh oh
---
i humbly take that back (:
---
As an Ace main myself, I am indeed torn.
---
We do need more original killers, devs have next to no freedom with licensed characters.
---
Never cut with the tip of the chainsaw because this will happen
---
My two broken controllers can agree to this
---
I SWEAR I PARRIED THAT
---
Okay but I’ve been jumpscared more by creepers in Minecraft than anything in dead by daylight
---
Somehow, the cigarette didn’t fall out.
---
Don't worry it'll mostly be your own team 😉
---
I’m sure they’ll get on reddit and read this immediately.
---
Haven’t seen the show but I’m super excited for the Demogorgon. It looks terrifying, design wise it’s definitely my new favorite.
---
To be fair, he isn't in the dream realm, he is in the Entity's realm, so its the Entity's rules.
---
But endermen are friendly unless you provoke them. creepers want to watch the world burn.
---
*GUYS LETS GET THIS TO TOP POST PLS TYVM HAVE A NICE DAY*
---
Alright I'm down.
---
I personally liked Stranger Things, but from a game health state this will be good because it will open the game to a wider audience and hopefully bring fresh players to the game. Even if it isn't a licence you care about more players mean faster and better matchmaking.
---
^it ^^never ^does
---
it the thought that counts.
---
ONCE OPON A TOXIC BILL -Noob3
---
They would have to allow killer to hear it for it to be balanced and immersive but the problem there being that you’d have the 12 year olds blaring there shitty music and other things to bring the killer to the survivor to troll
---
That’s my hope!
---
According to the wiki : Sole Survivor can be used with Object of Obsession so that you can see the Killer, but they potentially can't see you. It is possible to fully conceal yourself if both Perks are at Tier III.
---
I think it would largely depend on the killer, if you have comes with your team though, running those two together could potentially win you the game. Being the obsession obviously comes with its own risks if the killer is using obsession perks though, so get to know which ones are common and which will hurt you the most. Save the Best for Last comes to mind, especially if you are playing solo. If you are successfully avoiding the killer the whole match, that perk becomes really powerful.
---
Yeah, but he would die once he goes anywhere close to survivors
---
The survivors look very cartoony compared to what we have
---
It think it's probably because we didn't get a survivor at all with the Ghostface DLC.
---
Oof. This speaks to me. The sight of all 4 survivors running out the gates, teabagging and pointing at me, it haunts my dreams
---
Nah, her traps have to be set off, unless running mint. I'm saying these mannequins are the killer. You're just able to jump to them when you want. I see what you're saying, but what what's in my head sounds different than hag.
---
No prob no prob, yeah I'm hyped af for this chapter
---
finally, a killer that displays my true feelings and desires. kill the survivor and myself. It’s a win-win.
---
It’s unavoidable at this point, they gotta add it. Right?
---
I’ve kobed even later than that and had a struggle phase tho sooooo
---
Flashbacks of Call Of Duty Infinite Warfare
---
Life hack: keep one of the new characters selected at all times, and when you get into the lobby (when the music goes back to normal anyway), switch to the character you actually want to play.
---
Obvs hoping for various things isn't bad, but the clear surge of players clamoring for new killers every time a new DLC is released for this game gives the impression that many people only get interested in this game when new content comes around or in hopes that something from their favorite movie or show will be added, not for a genuine interest in the game itself.
---
It's not, actually. They can still do movies and cameos, but they won't make new games because they already milked everything they could from the series in the form of main games and spin-offs. To be able to sell another SH title, they would need to go all out to convince the community, like they almost did with SHs, which they won't do because it's too much work and Konami only cares about quick and easy money.
---
They already did when they kicked out Team Silent in the middle of SH5's development.
---
The best we can expect is a mobage.
---
High 80+% survival rate in swf
---
BaLaNcEd
---
If the perks aren't worth it you could just equip all the other unlocked perks you will get in the bloodweb.
---
Negative! If you escape the first phase with or without help you still get a struggle phase
---
that’s why it’s the perfect concept for a killer. A killer that truly encapsulates my true feelings and desires and gives me the opportunity to kill myself to death
---
susie is S++ tier dont @ me
---
Same happened to me playing jag, got the 4K lmao
---
\#justSurvivorthings
---
Next up on a new installment of shitting on other peoples fun because I (someone who is not a Dev nor has any idea what the future of the game holds) just don't believe it will happen. 
---
Y'all already did this about weather or not we would get Demogorgon, y'all also did this about weather or not we would get a clown killer. 
---
Clearly the Devs change their mind about these things.
---
That's why no except you is trying to claim or infer that anything is absolutely set in stone for the future of the game. You have no idea what will happen so let people have fun and just enjoy wondering about what all the weird and wonderful killer suggestions would be like in game.
---
I really don't think bubba is as good as people make him out to be. His chainsaw is so impractical, only good for guarding hooks and basement presence, at least with legion you can keep survivors injured and use killer instinct to give you info on where other survivors are, bubba will mostly be a basic attack killer unless a survivor leads him out into an open field with no vaults or pallets, or if bubba gets lucky with charge addons. Legion does group pressure better than bubba, and his chainsaw seems like it's meant to be dangerous to groups but doesn't do well at that
---
Never happened before tho, that’s why I’m like wtf
---
The real horror is seeing a demogorgan get flashlight blinded. It doesn’t even have any fucking eyes!
---

Thanks for the answer :D

They said that they want to do what they did to Freddy’s map on haddonfield so I’d say it’s comming soon most likely. I think they wanna do the license maps first because it’s the only way around the license agreement so they can technically make more maps/variations of the already existing ones but not make totally new ones with new locations.
---

while i like heather, if we wanted Pyramid head as the killer, he has no ties with her - beign a manifestation of James' from his specific experiences in silent hill - but like i mentioned in my comment, i dont think even Konami cares that much about the lore, as hes been popping up in plenty of silent hill games since 2
---
As another Myers main... how is another indoor map a bad thing? Scratched Mirror my dude.
---
I mean really the ones to be worried are Killer mains. Survivors will be steve and nancy whether their perks suck or not bc their basically just skins. 
---
It seems like they have been working really hard on this chapter though so I wouldnt be worried about it being lackluster at all.
---
You technically couls have left Steve unedited.
---
thank you but I just joke about it to help cope with the feeling of it lol
---
Damn dude have some mercy
---
It's horror adjacent, in the same way predator and Jurassic park are horror.
---
Read, it says “well since they broke the rules of only humans...blah blah blah” at the start or somewhere in the posts. I never said you couldn’t suggest killers, it’s just people don’t see what they actually meant.
---
Nice, now post the NFSW version
---
Why not just PS message em. Also why are you so salty about getting camped? It’s a fucking game that has no significant value in your current life, does it? If you wanna cry about a single match don’t do it here just so you can mock another person.
---
No they didn't and Silent Hills proved that what are you talking about xD
---
Aye.
---
for literally any game.
---
I suppose it is because if they launch it too late on the week they won't have time to patch possible bugs until the weekend. and at mondays they prepare everything for the launch. so tuesday is the perfect day
---
Konami just recently went for a new copyright for Silent Hill back in July— if it’s for a new game or a new pachinko machine we don’t know but I’m prepared for disappointment
---
Thats very true but when legion was released he was op so I'm hoping hes not like that. But who would you say is op at the moment
---
So I've never seen stranger things so can anyone explain what the creature is and what power it might have?
---
Omg i mever noticed omfg oh god im cumming pls help asagahgg
---
check r/dbdgonewild
---
They didn’t do stranger things just because of that, I don’t know the game but so well but the characters seem to fit well into the whole idea of it and you’re saying the Demogorgon doesn’t seem scary?
---
The last 2 seasons are better than the 1st I can tell you that much so maybe try getting into it again. I’m not gonna spoil it in case you do watch it but the ending of the 3rd season is pretty crazy
---
Half the maps in the game already do that.
---
God I was one of those guys. Granted based on the original trailer it made so much sense.
---
Bamboozle is really the only good perk for him. Assuming the Survivor isn't paying attention and gets caught because of the blockage. But if there's a double-L wall then it's half as effective. Caulorophobia isn't good because no one is going to heal within the TR to avoid Nurse's. Pop is only good if you are a high mobility Killer, but only if you don't have Ruin to use.
---
Whats archives?

Dont forget that with Bubba you can use ur Chainsaw and walk the same speed backwards as forward, if its a short loop, you "bait" your chainsaw into them thinking you destroy the pallet so they have a safe vault, while actually running backwards into them. Bubba is definitely not a bad killer, his chainsaw is also great for BT risky swf players
---
Can’t message due to their privacy settings, there’s literally a flair for it. Don’t complain, you had the option to not read it you troglodyte moron.
---
I thought it was coming but without a killer. So glad BHVR is now open to different types of killers.
---
Yeah I know
---
"an ebony Mori that is more fair for the survivors, because they have nothing in their kit that is unfair or gives them free wins"    
---
Oh shit wait
---
That’s good. The best method of suicide prevention is creating short term goals for yourself.
---
Got our pick axe swinging from side to side.
---
Yea, some of the traps are just fucked up and gross to look at.
---
To be fair, this wasn't leaked, just teased very often.
---
Maybe u can find playing as a monster fun! I’ve never seen the saw movies but love the pig
---
Run kindred, anyone with half a brain can use the information that provides to prevent a stupid rescue attempt.
---
alien 1 xenonorph could actually work well, since it was slow and methodical like our killers
---
But we dont even know if Steve will have a scoops ahoy outfit.
---
Considering [the devs are doing a dev stream about ST Chapter info like they did with Demise of the Faithful](https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/stranger-things-announcement), it's likely that we'll be seeing the PTB sometime next week. Tuesday if I'd have to guess.
---
Sadly most people will proceed to bring in the sweatiest meta builds and high tier items/offerings/Moris.
---
They’ve been confirmed to have separar perks
---
Although if they don't want to despise Steve, I recommend they watch it all.
---
It's fine to not add taunts for survivors, just one more gesture would do for them: 'look that way' (point at eye, then point in direction) to differentiate from 'go that way' which we already have. The taunts would be for killer, maybe paywalled. Could end up being a bad idea, idk.
---
Cool thanks for the info, thinking of getting this, do the characters have different stats and skills or are they just skins?
---
Have you seen the gameplay for it? Trust me, It's not sticking around.
---
Ghost face is a better pig, no BS trap rng, just sweet insta downs
---
He even showed up in the half-assed movies as Heather's "guardian"
---
Maybe they’ll have an ability to let them sprint for a short time, allowing them to vault pallets and hitting survivors applies a deep wound effect, refreshing the skill and allowing them to see nearby survivors.
---
oh that sounds delicious!! the soup wasn’t bad in the end, it helped with my cold :D
---
I haven't played the game regularly on a long while. would it be worth it getting back to the grind because getting all characters leveled takes time I can't fully Invest. I still pop on with friends randomly. I think i prefer watching the streamers dedicate that time I can't.
---
But they could easily do two different timelines if silent hill
---
DBD was rough at first too
---
Even though toxic players will be toxic, that just means I gotta be *EXTRA* nice. Ima be so goddamn friendly, giving people toolboxes, telling killers they did good....
---
I am not a fan because I've never seen the show, but honestly if the Killers we get keep being balls and easily defeated by a decently coordinated team, then there's nothing to be excited about. Especially if the perks are bollocks too. I want to enjoy every Killer, but Legion, Plague, and Ghost have been mediocre and hard to enjoy. Power-wise, and perk wise.
---
Survivors are way stronger, and to an unreasonable degree, but the Hunters are ALSO stronger than DbD's Killers. Ripper is the Wraith with his cloak on passive so he can attack out of it and a sword beam.
---
So it's definitely unfair, but I wouldn't say so unfair as to justify camping.
---
I guess this biggest thing would be to play conservatively until SS activates.  I try not to spin the camera towards the killer unless I'm trying to throw him off.  The distance gets me.  After people start dying it's hard to gauge how far is it where I can see him but he cant see me
---
In this update, are they by chance making it so that you don't have to invite people back to a lobby after every game?
---
I’m out of the loop what are you referring to?
---
. You see man making up silly killer suggestions is fun. Wouldnt it suck if some dude pulled an "um actually" making you look stupid and ruined it for everyone else.
---
I meant in theory. DbD sure isn't.
---
IMO it's pretty meh. 
---
I tried to power through it thinking it would get better and it doesn't. If you don't like it at first I suggest not making the same mistake I made.
---
You're way too emotionally involved in what other people like, dude. You don't have to like popular things but it's a waste of time to get that angry that other people like them.
---
This reminds me of the Nightwave in Warframe. It replaced the alerts with a Battle Pass-like system that expands upon the lore of the Warframe Universe. 
---
The Nightwave has Daily, Weekly, and Elite Weekly(basically harder than Weekly) objectives to complete within the week. Tbh, the Archives seems to be exactly what a game DbD needs to have some form of content inbetween it's bigger chapter releases.
---
Yeah but DBD didn't have sony backing it. This game does and it's hot garbage right now. I do have hope that it'll be better once launch day comes though.
---
Me trying to learn Myers.
---
I just get discouraged and go stand in a corner and wait for them to leave :(
---
That’s probably canon with dbd but definitely not with left4dead
---
F.  Also on Pred's viability, he's a trophy hunter but only hunts competent marks.  He's also not supernatural but extraterrestrial.  Alien is as well but I suppose he's more of a silicate lifeform anomaly.  The Engineer and David could be suitable as killers too
---
I use it for killer marking
---
If they were one character then there would only be 3 perks? That's why it matters. The other 3 perks just wouldn't exist.
---
Predator: am i a joke to you
---
Why are survivors so quick to label all lag as lagswitching? Every once in a while the game will get a lag spike and then as soon as it’s over I get bombarded by survivors accusing me of lag switching. Don’t understand it. Do people not realize lag happens on its own and it’s not always purposeful?
---
Steve is a wonderfully fun character to watch, dumb shit happens to him and half the time he deserves it, and yet he's still goofy and funny, he's entertaining. Jonathan had weird almost stalkery vibes in the first season and in s2-3 is just boring (imo ofc)
---
So, you're going to be sorry?
---
kind crused, but still okay 👌
---
Not the game for it, honestly. Maps not big enough, I don't think. I also echo what most are saying, I don't want to hear most of those folks while playing.
---
You're saying a fat man dressed as a clown throwing toxic gas bottles and laughing while he does it isn't scary?
---
\*The entity wants to know your location\*
---
Halloween still superior
---
It's been the opposite for me why because players like to unhook me when the killer is still there. So i immediately get hooked again. Also im usually the first to get caught why because for some reason no one wants to do generators they all go looking for the ruin. Another annoying thing i keep getting are groups of people helping the killer to level up so that they bringing him to me.
---
Hadn’t seen that yet. Thanks for the info 👍🏻
---
I never said you couldn’t, I’m just saying that people are saying that they broke their own rules by making a monster, but they actually said humanOID figure. Look on every forum about making new chapters, killers, and survivors and tell me once where I posted “Um actually”. My username is 8obot1c and I did actually make some concepts myself.
---
Wait so were you a Dev for the game?
---
Np
---
The aesthetic and lore of this low-contrast game with an excuse plot.
---
Because its so easily counter-able. All you have to do is cleanse dull totems. When you have 4 survivors it’s very easy to cleanse them all, especially if even one is running something like small game. I’m a killer main that uses NOED on some killers and it’s pretty much a 50/50 chance that it’ll go off or not.
---
I don’t wanna say zero cause you never know but I very very much doubt it
---
If only slashers were allowed in this game then we wouldn’t have wraith, hillbilly, hag, doctor, pig, clown, spirit, and plague since none of them have masks. And yes I put pig because the role of the pig dosen’t belong to anyone specifically. The role has been given to atleast 5 or 6 people throughout the entire franchise and besides movies who have only one killer and kill that person off in a movie besides copycats there is never a person who is identical to someone else. This game isn’t for slashers only. There’s a like between killer and slasher
---
Bruh
---
I'm holding out for a Skinwalker Shaman or a Twin Peaks chapter
---
I just heard the rumors and went "Yeah I believe that."
---
Vindicated.
---
I swear I’m gonna shit my pants every time I see the in game demogorgon
---
So nothing's different. Noted.
---
When it was released, it was incredibly broken and could win almost every time with ease. Each attempt to fix it gave new advantages, and people grew more and more tired of facing/playing as it. Eventually, they balanced it by nerfing it a ton, and now it’s a slightly below-average killer whose power has little use tactically. Tbf, a majority of the hate towards legion has died down, but there was around a 3 month period where any discussion of DbD was dominated by legionnhate, this sub included.
---
I can't wait to know what power/perks will the Demogorgon have.
---
Twin Peaks had a fucking awesome location and aesthetic but the I cant even remember the rest of the movie, didnt do too much for me personally.
---
We need Predator to counter this
---
That sounds like Guest Grumps to me
---
Uh... "Boy there's no way we'll never get Pyramid Head in Dead by Daylight!"
---
Eh??
---
Muh aesthetic purity.
---
What I don't know is, why you went to cleanse a dull totem, when the killer was obviously looking for you?
---
Everything has an opposite in the upside down. So maybe it is just the opposite of a human?
---
Cursed and *kinky*
---
In fact it does help me, gives me more reason to play because ik it’ll get fixed at some point
---
Well poor hotboxes plague the whole game and I've seen pro Trapper's use Whispers to tell when its save to place a trap
---
Troglodyte moron is literally the funniest thing I’ve heard all day 😂
---
Those scumbag survivors finding Ruin and being able to hit great skill checks the nerve of them
---
You naive creature
---
To think Joey is not at the top of the legion tier list is an idiotic thought that should not be brought up in these holy grounds
---
I'd haggle for "usually isn't a bad thing," since P2W, game-breaking bugs, or violently upsetting the balance in general are all on the table.
---
The balance upset wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't guaranteed to be a perk band-aid fix for whatever happens.
---
Oh, and you lose ALL of your perks on Prestige so the pool for those keeps getting thinner.
---
I feel you on that adept tho 😭
---
I never thought about that lol
---
You need to essentially farm them. Hit them. Slug them. Extend the game artificially. Even if you’re about to win? Stall for a few minutes.
---
You may be confusing kobe'ing later with kobe'ing with a lower struggle bar which I'm sure you haven't. You waited a short time then attempted twice, each attempt knocks your bar down by a large chunk of roughly 20 seconds. The third attempt was successful but during it your bar slipped below 50%. You may have spent more time on a hook before, but the two failed attemtpts screwed you.
---
Side side to side.
---
Please balance your game instead of releasing endless new characters and forcing us to buy perks to slow down the game.
---
imo it's Trapper's Hollow Blight outfit🤤
---
I forgot the game took away the pallet vacuum and replaced it with a chase vacuum so killers can no longer break chases.
---
Woosh
---
Sometimes it's the killer to. You will see alot of dcs against moris, iredessent huntress, etc.
---
I honestly didn't think the new freddy was that bad. Just the story was.
---
If a Predator is in the Fog, it's there to hunt the Entity, not Survivors.
---
See I'm part nurse main so I cant say anything. But yeah she is op but you can't really fix her without making her bad
---
My point is that you don't have to ruin peoples fun just for the sake of being correct, especially when you or anyone else for that matter don't even know what the situation in regards to weather or not a rule has been broken or if said rule is even still recognises by the Devs as a rule. 
---
Also dude, ngl "tell me where i posted 'um actually'" is like the most "um actually" response you could have made without actually saying it.
---
I'll make sure to continue not running Hex: Ruin.
---
I really love Frank and Joey's little idle animation in the lobby. It such a small thing but it's just so cool to me. Such a badass stance.
---
I think Frank is probably a close second for me behin joey, I just wanted to emphasize how much I like Joey though. Lol
---
The game is a Predator game, not an AvP game. No reason why they would put a Xenomorph into it if it isn't called AvP. With how quickly the Xeno became the most requested killer for DBD in a matter of hours, it's very likely that the devs will consider it. You'll see.
---
At least until biker Kate comes out
---
😉shhhhhhh
---
You make a good point!
---
Smash Bros community not too long ago absolutely hounded some poor girl because she beat a pro with a character considered low tier, it was shocking, thankfully the nicer side managed to restore some of her faith but still  [https://www.svg.com/157500/a-15-year-old-girl-defeated-a-pro-smash-player-now-shes-being-bullied-out-of-the-scene/](https://www.svg.com/157500/a-15-year-old-girl-defeated-a-pro-smash-player-now-shes-being-bullied-out-of-the-scene/)
---
There's not really a physical killer in Twin Peaks, anyway. They can give BOB physical form, but he's still just a gross dude who picks on people weaker than him.
---
Idc if people like it. Let them like it.
---
I just don't want it appearing everywhere so I have to constantly see it. It's on every website, every recommended thing, it has games, it has ads, it has so much stupid things that no matter where I look I see it.
---
It is pushed far too hard and I just wish I could shut off seeing it constantly.
---
On every recommended page on Netflix + top banner.
---
Video game plastered on Steam and I think other consoles.
---
Events on kid sites like Roblox.
---
Ads all over TV
---
Emails from Netflix insisting I come watch it.
---
Dead by Daylight subreddit is now Stranger Things Subreddit 2
---
Constant meme formats and constant subreddit take overs by it
---
People constantly nagging me to watch it and when I decline, they call me names and bitch about me not watching it. People that like it couldn't even respect the parent comment asking that we just get more original killers instead of popular ones. He just asked for a basic thing and people got salty over it.
---
I'm just tired of it and I really don't want it all over the place anymore or I want it to be more discrete. I would rather it not be so oversaturated and so overdone. The community is also full of a-holes that can't respect the people that decline watching it.
---
I'm not asking people to stop liking it, but I want to stop seeing it invade everything. It's annoying as hell to constantly hear "Oh My GoD sTrAnGeR tHiNgS"
---
Wouldn’t he be a little too big though? 
---
Also if he were to be added, I’d love for him to have the homecoming look, absolutely horrifying.
---
Yeah but susie's blade isnt as precise as Joey's. He'll leave a clean cut, Susie might not even get the full soul out.
---
toxic tits and milk
---
I'm actually torn. I felt like shit hooking Ash. Hearing him scream was like a betrayal.   
---
The thought of tossing Steve and/or Nancy up there is killing me.
---
Probably not unfair so much as hard to hitbox right.
---
I think you have a misconception. As the game is currently designed, against decent killers escaping mid chase for reasons other than a killer deciding not to commit is just a bad expectation. You can loop a wraith for 5 gens, but at the end of the day he will catch you bar you leaving. 
---
You're better off learning to extend chases, rather than try to avoid them as soon as you get into one. You'd be setting yourself up for dissapointment.
---
Characters are almost entirely just skins. Every character has 3 special perks, but once you level them up to lvls 30-35-40 those perks unlock as 'teachable' and any other character can then unlock those perks.  So really with enough time and leveling up, every character can learn every/any perk.
---
Characters all move and perform actions at the same speed, the only real difference in characters is their breathing noises and body size. Ash Williams (from Evil Dead) is a loud fuckin guy. Jeff (a DBD original character) is very tall and fairly bulky. So they are easier to spot and detect if a killer is being observant than some of the quieter and smaller female characters. But it's not a huge difference, especially since most of the time it's more fun to wear flamboyant outfits that pretty much act as neon signs to the killer anyway (I'll tell you right now if Steve has a scoops ahoy outfit option I'm never taking it off him)
---
I've always found indoor maps as my boy to be pretty damn tough. Players tend not to notice me as much when I'm in grass so it's a lot easier for me to build stalk, but indoors like around Badham and The Game it's a shit lot tougher.
---
I disagree, strongly. On most if not all maps Huntress is still a perfectly strong killer, she has better matchups on certain maps but that's just a bonus to her overall strength, she is still strong on all of them.
---
How is it abuse that me and other survivors have learned to hit those ruin skill checks?
---
I mean the Babylonian faith is a dead religion but go off lol
---
I would like you to explain to me how I’m ruining others fun for them and give me PROOF.
---
Props to BHVR if the DLC is regularly priced.
---
Creator's a pedo tho.
---
We don’t know it’s power but it monch in the show
---
Yeah thats the issue, they fucked up with her ability it just straight up doesn't belong in the game.
---
Right? All REAL fans want LEPRECHAUN.
---
yeet
---
Nice
---
I was making a joke Nancy’s model being a bit horrid, hence being a killer sorry
---
This also works with Blood Warden
---
Shadowborn really helps.
---
Hag. Legion is boring and hated
---
Is the show good? I never bothered watching it but maybe I will now...
---
yeah... that movie was so bad :C
---
Though the first movie was one of the best video game movies made to date imo so thats atleast a cool trade off... aaaand he showed up in that aswell xD
---
Honestly as someone who doesn't particularly like the show my biggest hype comes from being able to kill them.
---
Imagine knowing how to hit space bar at the right time because you've played the game a couple hundred hours.
---
Probably a result of bad experiences, you know. After experiencing lag switching a few times it's difficult not to think all lag is deliberate.
---
However, dedicated servers are coming soon and we'll leave it all behind us.
---
All I know about Stranger Things is that it's like IT. And apparently has a phallus monster.
---
clean cuts dont matter when you're gonna impale them on a hook.
---
If Steve doesn’t get a Scoops-Ahoy cosmetic, we riot!
---
Go hag, ya want that ruin teachable
---
I'd switch trapper and plague.
---
I think so in a technical way they'd have to make a new model for him to move right. Me too I love his later look.
---
We be toxic to discourage new players duh
---
It’s Goliath lol
---
Shame it isn't the mall. It'd be fun. Escalators, hiding in different stores, maybe even a third level parking lot area or something.
---
Damn near impossible
---
Yes totally agree. Maybe generator lights will flicker when it gets close too
---
Welcome to the world. That's what happens when things are popular. You think I like hearing rap and EDM in virtually everything? I hate that shit but why be a dick just because I don't like what's popular right now? We all have things we don't like that we have to see every day.
---
Now you, too, can see all of these characters you know and love shoehorned into everyone else's static playstyle plus one twist and canonically bullied by a spider-ghost.
---
I was honestly convinced it was gonna be billy
---
So Jerry’d have No Mither, Object of Obsession, Mettle of Man?
---
Isn't there only one killer that does it by choice?
---
I'm a survivor main and I don't mind NOED, but it is frustrating. I find all one hit downs to be a little frustrating, but realize they're part of the game.
---
Sometimes I wonder how it'd be if Adrenaline countered NOED.
---
we really have to end this sometime, im getting hungry. how about susie is S at least?
---
Yes
---
It wouldn't just be hook "skins" but more like the actual hooking system is replaced with something else. There might not be a 3-"Hook system" to kill people and perks like Slippery Meat, Monstrous Shrine, Borrowed Time, Deliverance, maybe Decisive Strike, Hangman's Trick, etc. would be useless.
---
I also recall a Hannibal Lecter idea which also was a "No Hook" killer, where Lecter's method of "Sacrificing" involved slugging and brutally mauling survivors, which inflicted debuffs on them like blindness, mangled, action speed debuffs, etc. and you win by having the survivor bleed out on the ground. 
---
It'd be hard to balance but I'd love to see complicated killers which completely change the way the game is played. 
---
Hook "Skins" could be cool though for basement hooks. I.E. Doctor's basement has Clockwork Orange inspired therapy chairs where the survivor is strapped in and subject to electric shock, Pig could have some kind of trap the survivor is placed into, etc.
---
And maximum melanin
---
Glory times as survivor. 
---
Billy times as killer.
---
A very ignorant post
---
Most killers do it by choice, while some are manipulated and other are tortured into doing it.
---
The funniest thing is I don’t particularly know a lot about the show/am not fond of it but I told my mom about this and she was ELATED cuz she knows I play this game! She even offered to buy me some acuric cells so I could try out The Demogorgon or the new survivors &lt;3
---
How long did it take you to save up $10 lmao
---
But, hopper got the last laugh...
---
He also looked bad and had 0 creativity in his kills for someone with control over dreams. Well-acted. Bad enough script that that wasn't really fun, though.
---
If you can bait "a lot" of vaults and pallets, either you're getting extremely lucky with pallet and vault locatiton generation or the survivors are playing subpar. Even with his best addons, you'll be lucky to chainsaw hit a survivor who knows what they're doing. The fact that he's slower than survs when revving the saw and the fact that his sprint starts at a crawl really kills the viability. On top of that, a majority of his addons are useless.
---
Risky and dumb swf are two different things, but you can be any killer and dominate dumb survivors.
---
How far have you made it in the game? Unlike in dbd, ranking up requires skill and experience, and frankly, I hate to be so blunt, but if you haven't reached mammoth, you are in no position to make judgements about camping. 
---
In the numerous tournaments that have happened, in China and outside of it, every hunter camped and tunneled, and many still lost. Why? Because it is insanely easy to rescue someone as long as you are full health, and if the survivor is decent, they will continue to kite the hunter.
---
Yes, hunters are powerful, but the problem many of them face is that they have to earn their abilities, and the game could end before that happens. Survivors can also learn how to adapt to their abilities, and since each map is the same, survivors benefit much more because with enough experience, you can have a route for every hunter on every map.
---
“no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this...six year old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and...the blackest eyes - the devil's eyes”
---
I’ll just leave this quote about Micheal Myers here.
---
I believe they're both 18 or older. I think Steve is 19.
---
But regardless, it wouldn't be the first time for this game anyway. Laurie from Halloween and Quentin from Nightmare on Elm Street are 17, and are both survivors in this game
---
Have people actually been saying this, or is this just a random meme? If so, people are crazy. Licensed or not, it is new content either way. I personally enjoy a lot of the license ones more since Im a huge horror fan.
---
Ah okay that makes sense
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far xd
---
Edit: all killers *used* to be human
---
:P
---
Who the fuck is that guy
---
I usually just wait patiently for my parents to give me money, it takes about 2-3 months like an average for each chapter.
---
It has the best story in horror, continuously telling the story after each film ends and picks up
---
Are you having some kind of stroke?
---
I miss evolve if only 2K didn’t go nuts with monetization the game might still be alive. Still a Goliath killer would be awesome and maybe Abe as a survivor?
---
I hope you can afford those extra few tax cents! We'll make a GoFundMe.
---
Then I'll to move Frank and joey up too
---
Big momma Steve is the only person I’m playing after the release. Sorry Feng.
---
u/archiecobham is talking about how the ST trailer has a lot more likes even though the views are less, meaning a higher percentage of people that watched it liked it, not talking about the views specifically
---
That’s hot
---
Don't know why this is getting downvoted as hard as it is? Matchmaking right now is broken. Any survivor who complains about it is told to get good at the game, but it's not very fair to people who are literally new to Dead by Daylight to go against green ranks who likely have much more experience.
---
Thanks for the info. I would likely have never known.
---
People are shit by default
---
She's strong yeah but against a survivor who knows how to avoid getting hit from far ranges (plenty of trees, rocks, walls, tractors, hay bales etc to make sure you don't hit them) your best bet is to hit them at pallets, which won't happen if they bait you into winding up a hatchet throw, they'll just get one more loop in, until you stop falling for it, which they'll probably just hit you with a pallet.
---
Ghostface is garbage. If you see one year ago tier lists all put doc high tier and now he is low tier. The same will happen with GF
---
I'd really like to know what happened with Scream. With the TWC gone, the rights would have reverted back to Miramax and they are very open to licensing stuff. Including this Character.
---
Just started playing the game a few weeks ago, and I feel like moris and keys are just not fun and feel cheap if you're going up against either. Mori's would be cool for the last survivor getting downed, and there really isn't a place for keys in the game at all... or maybe if two of your fellow survivors DC within the first minute to even the playing field. Something like that, who knows. I'd be fine with the keys taken completely out tbh, I have so many saved and I've never used one.
---
No problem, glad to help :)
---
SLAP
---
Gotcha, thank you!
---
you do not have to buy every dlc to enjoy the game really you can spend a lot of time just with base killers and survivors. you can grind to get every killer and survivor except the licenced killers and survivors
---
No you really don’t, if you’re kidding because I don’t want people giving me money just for a chapter and you could use that money for something else that you might need.
---
I recently started playing on Xbox and any toxicity in game is not apparent like, say, rocket league or Smite.  
---
But come to the subreddit and you'd think the game is on it's last leg.
---
Hehe... "the bat"
---
If I were them, I'd do all the stuff you wanna do with Ghostface first, then negotiate the Scream rights, since it's easier to get one company to agree on something than two.
---
Fetal alcohol syndrome?
---
I know, I just want my dlc :|
---
Dedicated servers are supposed to come sometime in september. No details on the actual date though.
---
Imagine what it’s mori will be like
---
I've been avoiding the hell out of Ranked as Hunter because it's just toxic SWFs rushing everything. They really should let Hunters still move when in hit recovery, if slower like DbD, or move faster in general.
---
But while camping KIND OF secures one kill, it's still the same as DbD where it removes pressure from everything else. Tunnelling makes perfect sense, but I can't see much merit in camping and inevitably failing to hold one person instead of trying to snowball two at the risk of one unlikely kill.
---
you realize that there are people here who are younger than 16 right? Lmao
---
Nobody hurt me lol. That's just how my friends and I like to talk to each other, and I figured this was a rather tame jab so I didn't feel bad posting it. I doubt OP lost sleep over that one.
---
Somebody once told me intensifies*
---
STEVE
---
That whitefaced Kronk is fucking terrifying
---
You've got a very well thought out concept here. Nice job
---
Shrek for next killer?
---
This task a grueling one
---
Awww dang really? I just read somewhere coming this summer so I got excited
---
She died as fuck do
---
When you're evlauating with those kind of reasonings then why is the pig suppsed to be better? Her chases are even worse, she is slower if you're playing her stealthy (whatever you see as "optimal") and she has to break every pallet, her dash is also a joke. The only "good" thing is her wasting of time with Traps, however RNG is nothing you can calculate into an actual Game. And the time you safe with Chainsaws on pallets etc. aswell as mindgames, you can only mindgame loops as pigwhere you cant see the pig crouching/standing. Just watch some1 like Marth / whoever you think of as a good allround killer play LF. You can mindgame A LOT with a simple rev of your chainsaw
---
Sorry Meg, I still love you
---
Why do some nurses quickly raise their hand before blinking?(not upstairs or etc)
---
Which kinda sucks because I wanted Matthew Lillard as Ghostface.
---
Maybe someone, like a mod or member of the dev team, she prewarn that not all of us are toxic. People who are already toxic, aren't going to change but most likely will get worse because those idiots enjoy torturing others.
---
Yes, the game takes Michael in his Rob Zombie interpretation as an embodiment of evil. It doesn’t change the fact that he steal feels emotion. His obsession with Laurie and anything involving her is not a beast-like thing.
---
that’s how licensing be though unfortunately
---
Ah, yes. The “throw them in headfirst” approach.
---
Well there is one survivor your rank so it should be fine-devs on matchmaking
---
High quality shit post. Approved.
---
&gt;I went to public HS
---
whoa dang
---
The special offer thats what I’m hoping for and im sure they might wana do that for the new incoming player base but then again... license n all that stuff OOF.
---
He plays whatever killer he wants to play. He's learning how to play with Nurse and red ranks Nurse on ps4 are also strong, but I guess you never had a red rank experience.
---
Overwatch has more people whining about the amount of salt in the game than actual salty players at this point and it's hilarious.
---
You can get a 30 free trial.
---
I doubt it’s getting anything unfortunately.
---
Rly without a credit card?
---
Totally new hook mechanics would take a TON of effort and, like you just said, not work with existing perks.
---
In theory, Killer diversity like that would be great, but DbD is HEAVILY cemented into what it is, despite the hook system having always been kind of a bad idea, at least once they dropped the kill option Moris replace instead of just nerfing it.
---
In practice, I don't see any problem with just changing hooks for something that suits the killer, though. Chucky's taking the soul for himself with an automatic ritual, Xenomorph is waiting for gestation, and yeah, Doctor's slow-cooking some brains.
---
It could also add a nice touch to the lore where SOME Killers aren't killing because the Entity told them to, while others are, signified by the hook.
---
Yep. I understand the importance of the sovereignty? Of a thing, but big rip. 
---
I don’t think sovereignty is the word, it’s just the closest word I could remember.
---
TIL people younger than 16 have no way to get money
---
I mean, you can add a debit card and cancel before the trial ends.
---
Don't even answer to this guy. This is the type of people that plays shit XD
---
Damn i don’t have one ;((
---
I mean, they can’t legally work, and the kid said their parents give them money lol I don’t know what world you’re living in that you didn’t know this
---
Wait really? Who is the child didler?
---
The word you're looking for is humanoid.
---
I think, honestly, it was a lag spike. You both kinda stuttered and it got really framey.
---
*Laughs in Ash*
---
I'm sorry, did you just say Bubba is definitely not a bad killer? Let's look at this objectively. 
---
His chainsaw is trash anywhere but an open field or if they are in the basement. 
---
His mobility doesn't exist. 
---
He gets looped, hard. 
---
The little mindgame you put there won't work on any survivor that is simply watching you, the second you start to walk backwards they just change direction and you hit nothing. Bubba is an awful killer by every metric other than camping a hook or basement because of how ineffective his chainsaw is with terrain around.
---
Oof
---
chapters have a map a killer and a survivor
---
paragraphs have a killer or survivor only
---
We need stoner ghostface and shirtless myers
---
Scream rights are tied up with the weinstein company, sooo yeah.
---
No, he won't be added to that game. It is solely a Predator game, not an Alien vs Predator one. So a Xenomorph is very possible for DBD.
---
That legend is fucking scary dude, ask her a math question and gtfo
---
Sprint burst definitely causes false hit registers constantly, play some killer.
---
Bro same
---
Wholesome posts
---
I don't think xenomorphs are capable of understanding the concepts like the hooking-sacrifice process, unless the entity gives it inteligence or controls it.
---
Honestly. Just stop being complete asses to eachother over a game everybody.
---
then why do so many games have issues rendering reflections?
---
I play 50/50 killer and survivor. Maybe it’s your connection, but again, you can still hit them through sprint burst. Happens all the time.
---
Still technically summer
---
fair points but still, he looks like he's from the stone age! lol
---
It’s only Julie, why you hev tew be med?
---
Very true.... yet, he is my main. I must defend him
---
Oh ok
---
fair enough lol
---
I played day one on PC, and played for a long time.  So I’m not sure what the first Console build was like but man the gameplay/ Balance feels awful now.  Seems like the nearly took pallets out of the game. Yeah I understand looping sucks but that’s the only way to create space. It was a decent counter to the killers speed.   The few pallets that they do have buy you about 5 seconds because they seem to be in the open. 
---
Decisive Strike which was another counter is nerfed to the ground. Dead hard gets you about a 3 sec gap.   Killers have soooooo much in their favor.  Which I don’t hate completely but now I play killer and I win too easily and play survivor and watch my team get chased down in a few seconds.  Seems weird to me.  For me it’s a lot less fun, I’m curious what other people think. I still love the game and I’m not hating on it but in its current state it’s my least fav
---
I’m not strong enough to kill Steve 😔

Negative,  konami won't allow it. People have been asking for this since 2016.. Won't ever happen.  
---
Besides themes cooler monsters than PH hes too mainstream now
---
And good survivors should be factored in as well. Good survivors can take the control away from the killer, which is why nurse and spirit are so powerful. A survivor knows when you're going to hatchet and knows when you aren't going to, well I shouldn't say "knows", they just make a guess. And if they get it right they can exploit your mistake and will continue to do so till you take the stun at that pallet. Knowing when to hatchet really doesn't matter against good survivors, because they'll know when they could keep running the loops, it'll be hard to get the opportunity to land your shots even if you have amazing aim.  Far range hatchet throws are almost useless unless they're in an open field. Since huntress lacks map pressure with her 110% movement speed and need to stop and refill on hatchets occasionally, If you don't manage to down survivors quick enough you get gen rushed.
---
What behavior are you referring to?
---
Looking at this, makes me impressed with how much this studio was able to get.
---
👀💃
---
I love the idea of more indoor maps, but i'm also a huntress main. I'm so conflicted

the fact is that not a lot of teens experienced halloween like the ones who discovered halloween from its original creator to now, stranger things is "the new thing" so they are hyped by that and will like more something they lived with than something that his/her older siblings must have know
---
Not till we get dedicated servers
---
You’ve ever seen? Play any FPS lol.
---
Yes everyone is toxic, that’s how competitive games work. Both sides are equally at fault. The issue is this sub will tell me to get over myself if a killers shakes his head “No” after downing me while simultaneously creating a support group telling me how bad toxic survivors are if I’m a killer getting t-bagged by a survivor. This post and yours reinforces that. 
---
Want to retract what you said about 99% of killers being toxic as a response to survivors? Or you can show me this study you conducted. Or just prove my point.
---
Aw ok
---
&gt;He gets looped, hard.
---
Like any other non mobility/throwing killer
---
&gt; His mobility doesn't exist. 
---
Like any other...non mobility killer, I'm not saying he is an A rank killer, but he is not bad, and objectively, youre ignoring all the other killers it seems like.
---
&gt; His chainsaw is trash anywhere but an open field or if they are in the basement. 
---
This depends entirely on perk combinations, if youre running bamboozle etc. or if youre running a spirit fury build. His fast charge addons also change that approach, even streamers who use his joke addon of non 1 hit chainsaw do well with him, against good survivors. And mindgames work with any Killer, they're watching you always, which is why its a &gt;mind&lt;game. Also depends on the players pallet playstyle. Without any set examples given you cant judge a killer to full potential. But he is definitely not trash.
---
Unfortunately nothing you described is a reportable offense
---
Could be a Legion thing where you flip-flop between them, but considering they're survivors, I dunno.
---
If they pull a Legion I want someone to save this comment so I can say I called it and collect my 500 Jermabucks.
---
Tunneling isn't bannable.
---
I'll be honest I have no idea.
---
Highly recommend the show, I believe it’s worth the praise it gets.
---
That isn't reportable at all.
---
“Oh stop this”
---
It's not tunnelling if they solo me out and tunnel just me and camp just me and even send me a message to confirm it before the match
---
Exposed would probs be a red add on.
---
Slugging, tunneling and face camping is a dick move (sort of.)
---
But yet he committed on being in the killer mindset and I respect that
---
But isn't soloing someone out reportable?
---
I know the feeling, go outside of my appartment, Harry Potter on a flying bike is waiting there for me to leave my house to kill me over and over with homing missiles.
---
ssssssssslllapppp
---
Never seen anyone complain about instaheals. At least not legitimately and not just salt

It adds a layer of actual frar and insecurity

How does stuff like this even happen 😂

How about we just put more clothes on? *taps big brain*
---
What console you on pc Xbox or ps4 cause of report the steam account and directly report the ps4 and Xbox accounts
---
I'd blur the name. One of the rules.
---
I don’t think that’s a good idea personally
---
I doubt it's bannable.
---
No its where i live i think... debit cards don’t work abroad? Do they because i don’t live in the US or UK and i know that not all banks are supported... idk man oof ill just watch what i can on youtube i guess 😭💔
---
NEVER!
---
The thing with Myers is that he can snowball extremely fast.  Get T2 to 99%, wait until you have more than one survivor around, tap stalk once and just slug ERRYBODY.
---
You couldn't have them without Ripley, and if they added her they certainly won't change the game so she could fight them like she does.
---
Gimmicks exist but BHVR fucked themselves with the gimmick of survivors being able to do little to jack all for anything.
---
Tunneling and camping isnt bannable so nope
---
Jason isn’t a monster 😭 leave him alone
---
Okay ya know what, you're a real tough cookie man, lemme just spell it out. No one enjoys that one guy who has to let them know that they got one tiny detail wrong that is barely even relevant. That exactly what pulling an "um actually" fucking is dude. Your making an ass out of yourself by just going onto other peoples excited posts and correcting them on irrelevant details for the self gratification of being right. No one wants to hear it. No one minds a little "I'm not sure about that lol" but commenting on someones post that they've made because they are really hyped about a new killer and new opportunities that it may present for the game and starting off by just saying "um no" is irritating. You can do it sure but no one finds it helpful, fun, interesting, meaningful or anything else other than purely annoying. Why? Because it screams "I care more about correcting your minor error than engaging in any other discussion about what you've said." Quite understandably that message isn't exactly going to be well received.
---
The fact that you want proof, only proves this more, you care more about proving someone wrong and being the guy who gets everything right than anything else.
---
My proof for why it ruins peoples fun, is that just reading your post made think, oh jeez one of these guys. It fucking radiated an "um actually" aura. I couldn't help but notice that the entire point of that post was basically to tell everyone that they were wrong about something the most condescending way you could get away with."Well actually, that's not sufficient proof" &lt;- you after reading that probably.
---
Now go just think of something interesting to say instead of just correcting people over minor, irrelevant details because I'm done with this lol.
---
Healings are 25% slower
---
I'd estimate I personally produce at least 3-4 pounds of salt every time I face a prayer beads/mother daughter ring spirit.
---
I'm doing my part! 👍
---
All you do is bitch about everything in this sub.. I’ve seen you griping about all sorts of nonsense for months.
---
I wouldn't say her chases are worse. She's smaller, that gives directly gives her an advantage over someone like leatherface and all the other tall killers (not factoring in their powers) because although she is smaller she has the same lunge range, which has the possibility of throwing survivors off and which is why smaller killers like freddy and legion seem to have more "bs hits". 
---
Optimally playing pig doesn't mean crouching 24 7. You crouch to get closer to survivors before uncrouching, that can give you the jump on them, when playing pig, it's important to remember the size of your terror radius so you can lower the amount of time you are crouching (also we are talking about leatherface, someone who is pretty good at handling bt. Crouching as pig can counter bt as well).
---
Yeah she has to break every pallet, but leatherface still has a pretty bad charge to his chainsaw, its only slightly faster to chainsaw a pallet to bits than it is to just break it normally, which really only matters if you have some charge addons which would make the process fast enough to even consider it a significant time saver. Pig's ambush isn't entirely useless either. There are some pallets that are somewhat safe, but you can ambush hit to bait them into vaulting the pallet because the speed of the dash is pretty decent, you can definitely trick more people into getting what you want them to do with the ambush dash than you can with leatherfaces chainsaw (because his chainsaw takes a while to charge and his sprint starts very slowly). 
---
And her traps are more so a second thing to consider imo. They can be strong, but they can put a halt to gen progress enough to give you some room to breathe. They also give survs another objective unless they want to die, which can score you some free hits depending on the box's location.

Leatherface is not good at mind games. You gotta be a real potato to get consistently screwed over by his chainsaw. It's just not fast enough. The sprint, the charge, it's not fast enough to be viable around people who have basic knowledge of map layout
---
it’s gonna be $15, better go rake some leaves

What the hell. That’s messed up. Thanks for info.

Thanks! And I'd say they average about 6 hours each

Don't think I said that you uncooked pancake
---
he operated pretty similarly to OG Jason in the ‘09 remake, just a different personality. 
---
also, Jason is absolutely way more stacked than virgin trapper. Jason is a completely huge chad. trapper has a soft dad bod.
---
Bet 5$ it’s not :), jk but I’m going to wait patiently for money like I always do

Shirtless Myers
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
I was thinking that, since this September has a Friday the 13th, it's the 13th chapter, it would've been fantastic for a Friday chapter, but that damn lawsuit.
---
Inb4 Jason chapter
---
if you even partially blind nurse/spirit they cant blink/phase
---
I appreciate you homie
---
Demogorgon is badass. Can't wait for more monsters.
---
I won't lie, I would like if we got more original content as opposed to licensed content. That doesn't mean licensed content is bad though generally.
---
I feel the only real issue with licensed content is that the characters, mainly killer, have to follow some sort of pattern. Like Freddy pretty much 100% has to be involved with the dream world stuff, Ghostface and Michael both do a lot of stalking in their respective franchises, Leatherface's chainsaw is I feel one of his most identifiable traits and you could carry this trend onto MOST potential licensed characters.
---
It's simply an issue of if balance or design is an issue like how Freddy was, it does restrict what can be done to an extent. Leatherface is considered by many the worst killer, but they can't really do much with his gameplay outside of tweaking numbers since he likely needs that chainsaw to stay as is.
---
Scratched mirror Meyers: :)
---
The husks ought to be Moriable too, even without a Mori equipped or if they weren't hooked yet. Blood On Your Face (4-Mori achievement) is MAINLY hard because survivors will DC and screw you out of the achievement. 
---
Same with Evil Incarnate. Ideally even if the husk simply falls into dying state, you should be able to reset them via repeated pickups an drops into a standing position so you can tombstone them.
---
I like how alot of people are saying shit like "just because you ask for it doesn't mean you're gonna get it" and if you look very closely at the text you can see where it says "more likely" you absolute ball munchers
---
Idk it seemed like he was walking past the hatch, not gonna give it.
---
Since they're licensed they might be auric cell only, but i'm saving mine too. here's to hoping!
---
Sir fellow officer those are not emojis stand down
---
That's a big binge right there
---
ughh, that's part of why i lost interest in the game. The drops and freezes were too annoying and made it a pain to play. Did they announce that they are still working on it?
---
Task failed successfully
---
Imagine crying at a joke
---
And survivors got Ash before that
---
I’m not sure if this is intended or not, but the same happens to me when the killer DCs right away. I do believe the depipping is a visual bug but I could be wrong. I also think you keep your items/offerings. But yeah, it definitely displays the same “game stats” as the previous game when this happens to me on PS4, though I don’t think we’re meant to receive anything. I’d be curious to know too though.
---
I think it’s fine and all I’m just sad because I’ve been saving shards and now I can’t do it because it’s licensed.
---
I spot Ghostface more in indoor maps because there are less places for him to be able to go other than the door or straight hallways....Buuuut I still find him way more terrifying in indoor maps because I know there aren't as many places for me to run away from him. Ofc I just am generally more scared in indoor maps so that's probably why.
---
Healing takes longer
---
And? If u don't like it don't read my posts and keep YOUR griping off MY posts. I don't get on here to please u or anyone else. And technically I'm not griping you dult. I was asking if something was bannable/reportable so STFU and get off my thread or get blocked simple as that
---
Oh, its not like that for me, I wasn’t alive during the 80’s, and I’ve not played D&amp;D.
---
Thank you, I'm glad that you like the concept.
---
They whored it out to mortal kombat so who knows
---
That’s Kate
---
This happens to me as killer I’ll go for a swing then my frames go away.
---
TAKE MY MONEY BHVR. 
---
Sidenote, they could easily make the best Mori in the game with pretty much any death from that movie.
---
He DCed when all the gens where done
---
I agree
---
I mean ik that but soloing someone out should be if I'm not mistaken. Like I did nothing wrong in the match. I did 2 gens and as soon as I got found is when it started. My friend even tried taking aggro but he ignored her.
---
Quality shitpost
---
what laptop is that looks like an msi but i could be wrong
---
Hey loser if you weren't here shit posting about games like a fucking virgin maybe you could do something with your life.
---
Slippery Meat's odds are so low, I wouldn't waste the perk. Look for perks that minus scratch marks- like Light Weight. Look around ALOT. When you're creeping the map, on a generator, look AROUND. Don't immediately book it as soon as a killer is heading your way- sometimes they don't actually see you, and you can creep around nearby cover and just creep around to keep a rock or tree around you. For actual chases, practice looking behind you to try and dodge the killer's lunges. Do fake out runs; leave scratch marks to the left, but creep to the right and hide behind something.
---
The survivors could easily bring flashlights and adrenaline, but they won’t, because of the implication...
---
HELL YEAHHH OMG I NEED IT, I WANT IT !!
---
It most likely will as the reveal stream will be Thursday.
---
i was very loosely following this, as i assumed it would never happen. i saw people freak out over the screenshots of steve and "dead by daylight" appearing word by word and i was like holy shit guys youve really stooped low.
---
im fucking eating my words now aint i
---
I like how the demogorgon was just announced
---
Indeed sir
---
I mean I was kinda thinking of using his ability to mimic speech or screams as kind of a way to drag in and ambush survivors who think they're going to a teammate, since I can't think of anyone with that ability in the game and it'd be pretty cool
---
It’s a skin confirmed
---
But you'd also need to consider that Stranger Things is hugely popular as it's a current trend, Halloween is a horror classic and is over 40 years old and we're still talking about it. To say it isn't the biggest property in a horror game is a bit disrespectful
---
Finally, people who aren't tearing down my opinion.
---
Indoor maps are the best, change my mind.
---
This is a game whose main mechanics are about parkouring around jungle gyms and hiding. Maps should have lots of stuff to jump around with and hide next to, and they should have more verticality. People hate the game, and I sort of understand why, but it is far and away the most interesting map from a gameplay perspective.
---
Well now we’ll know who the real Pig loyalists are
---
Hell yeah bro, definitely my favorite movie of all time, so I just wanted to try to make a chapter out of it.
---
Yeah, if you have a debit card and it’s not working try calling Netflix to see why. Or maybe your financial institution.
---
Yea but imagine a killer that can crawl along walls
---
Joke and funny aren't synonyms moron.
---
Heather as a survivor. all my money
---
This makes me want them to pull licenses from games a bit more now instead of movies/shows simply due to untapped potential since all we got so far is Bill.
---
or just rebirth in general
---
I think the most logical monster killer that would be faithful to the lore would be some sort of offshoot of the entity. Maybe a body part of the entity that became sentient? Or an attempt by the entity to create a human from scratch that went wrong. Or a human that become deformed because of the putrid serum from the hallowed blight event
---
Nah I meant playing as the killer, you couldn’t see and you would have to hear the survivors like the monsters in Quiet Place
---
You feel sorry for them after a while.
---
When I run it, I consider it a time eater for survivors so I don't get genrushed, I hardly defend totems and usually run ruin and by the end game it's rare I have either left. I have been surprised a few times to one hit down because I expect it to have been disabled by eager survivors. Keys can ruin the game, engineer toolboxes can ruin the game, tombstone Meyers, ebony mori, etc. And it's not just to "reward a killer who can't win a chase" if you have everyone injured and the last gen pops while they're all running adrenaline, you telling me it's unfair for a killer to be able to down in one hit?
---
\*2rgames voice\* hype hype hype!
---
I'm probably going to go easy on all Steves and Nancys because there's a good chance they're new. Hopefully this chapter will bring in a lot of new players. New players are always a good thing.
---
Doing God's work
---
20% slower healing. You can expect on many killers where slugging is an option (Nurse, Trapper, Spirit, etc). And it’s a non teachable so even then it’s just really common, killer doesn’t matter.  
---
A 32 second Self Care becomes an almost 40 second Self Care which is half a genny (generator). Another reason to not run Self Care and obligatory fuck you to those that do.
---
Old Laurie old Laurie
---
Really wish this game could've got Jason. It would've been the perfect cherry on top.
---
Slows down the healing process
---
Little does he know...
---
Personally I enjoy games against higher rank survivors for the challenge, even if I don’t manage a 4k. Games after rank reset against baby survivors that run around like headless chickens are so mindlessly boring. It’s even more boring when baby survivors *refuse* to do gens if I have Ruin that they will do 3 laps around the map to find it. By that time, I’ve hooked everyone at least twice. Also I’m usually indifferent to a survivor spamming ctrl at me. At most I’ll respond by shaking my head *no* if I manage to down em.
---
Thanks for the protip though, I’ll try to play more during those times.
---
I got Noed pretty early on with Pig too. She is the best and my mind won’t be changed
---
We. Need. E V E R Y O N E
---
One person can’t keep track of 5 randomly spawning totems.
---
We all make mistakes haha. 
---
Happy cake day!
---
M E G H E A D
---
The main complaint about it is that the devs once said they would never do monsters or monster like killers so some people feel like it's a either a sellout or the devs are changing the feel of the game. Personally, I am intrigued and look forward to seeing where it goes. Also we get Steve so how can people complain?
---
Dang, they said they broke the rules, but then this guy said no that’s not true let me explain. Guess i will just stop imagining and become a mindless person. How does that even make sense? It’s liking saying “I want to make a movie, but this person did and broke rule 1 even though they made the rules so I will also break rule 1” “rule 1 isn’t that, they did something completely fine” “gUeSs IlL sToP mAkInG mOvIeS”. What you think I’m doing is “You can’t do that because they wouldn’t”, but in reality I’m saying “you are saying they did this, but it still goes with what they are doing”. Also, let’s say somebody is making props pig dlc or some shit. They said”They made a monster so we can do this” I’m simply telling them “They actually made it humanoid like they said they would”. I’m not saying “Peppa pig doesn’t fit in” I’m explaining why the company actually went with what they said. Stop talking about what I’m doing when I’m not even doing it.
---
I'll continue to be skeptical since I think he meant it was 2 different characters instead of 1 with different outfits like Legion. While 6 perks definitely isn't out the question since they did it with Jane and Ash, I wouldn't be surprised if there were only 5 since Steve and Nancy were a duo and could easily share a perk.
---
Or about perks.
---
Personally, I hope to see Alien, Friday the 13th, Child's Play and Hellraiser get added as chapters. What about you guys?
---
happens to me as ghosteface too, if i play any other killer hit boxes seem to be fine. but when i play ghost it goes to, well this
---
None of the other 13 comments are showing?
---
You can actually get in trouble for targeting a player across multiple matches but I'd imagine this would be hard to prove. It'd fall under griefing and I'd imagine it'd have to be a "Killer X has it out for me and he continuously dodges lobbies until he finds me, then facecamps me and lets everyone else go and this has been happening for several days." situation. 
---
I do have a Mori-List of shitters I have but I don't go out of my way to dodge lobbies to get queued up with them. It's more of a "Oh hey it's that Ochido wannabe who called me a trash killer who couldn't get a 2K after he DC'd to give his buddy hatch, *MORI TIME!*" case for me where if I recognized them I'll bring a Mori. 
---
That, or I get the same survivor in a row. About a month ago I got the same salty survivor 3 games in a row whining Freddy's fake pallets are OP. He bitched to me after a key escape via hatch Freddy's puddles have zero counterplay, DC'd after I got him next round with fake pallets, and DC'd again as I Mori'd him the game after. 
---
Either way I doubt it's bannable unless it's truly excessive and someone's facecamping you each and every time they get matched up with you and dodging lobbies solely so they can get matched up with you so they can facecamp you.
---
I've seen it more as a "go this way" emote.
---
Bruh moment
---
“COLLEGE KIDS! WE GOT YOUR FRIEND!” 
---
Such a good movie.
---
Do what I do when I get burned out. Take a week or two from playing it at all, and just watch streams of others playing it.
---
Sometimes I get exhausted from playing with bad survivors, or getting stressed as a killer, and nothing I do in the game makes me happy. That's when I step back for a little bit. 
---
I end up binging Panda's streams for a while and eventually I get excited about playing again.
---
It worked for Jane and Ash, and Ghostface didn't even have a survivor.
---
but why though
---
Meme build to break the monotony.
---
I love the “THE Nancy Wheeler” considering she’s been boring for a large portion of the show. Robyn outsold.
---
Don’t invoke his name
---
Not too crazy about Stranger Things but they better be some good perks.
---
Eh we'll see. I'm convinced they can handle it with the new dedicated servers coming alongside the ST DLC
---
Thanks for this, I’ll try giving it a break.
---
I know... but a killer that runs 40 mph *on walls* is unbeatable. Even Nurse can't match the mobility of a Xenomorph. You vault and he's got his little mouth-buddy thing shoved in your eye-socket before you even hit the ground. He's like a space cheetah that wants your meats.
---
There is a legal shit storm over who owns Jason right now. That's why his game is more or less on hiatus and why no movies have been made. It's going to be awhile before they sort it all out.
---
I LOVE playing Legion. Everyone says their boring and it’s always activate frenzy, stab, find someone else, stab, repeat... but I play like this: activate frenzy, stab, deactivate frenzy, down survivor. I have a lot of fun playing Legion. As another comment stated: running fast is fun and vaulting pallets is fun (it also makes survivors look kinda dumb for throwing them down)
---
Hol up,ain't iridescent head a huntress addon? What you doing throwing that in with the doctor?
---
I feel like after the DLC drops I'm gonna be one of the few character loyalists that would still use the old survivors
---
Probably because I won't have the money for the DLC but-
---
I’d have to level up my Myers bloodweb to do that, and I can’t really get bloodpoints if I’m getting gen rushed
---
But non humanoid and monsters are pretty different lol
---
Every killer who runs it: Terrifying 😅
---
If you had adrenaline and you were already healthy when the last gen pops, I might be ok with it taking half the damage of a single noed hit. Adrenaline at work already sucks for killers though imo.
---

Sprint Burst, Boil Over, Resilience and Slippery Meat are worthless. Resilience can have a little use but there are much better options. You need to play more to get more game sense (if you’re always first sacrifice then obviously you aren’t looping as well as you think) and grind more to get better perks. The meta build is Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Adrenaline and Borrowed Time (or Iron Will). Don’t use useless bullshit like Urban Evasion (you will not improve) or Self Care (you should wait until you have more game knowledge to use this otherwise you give the killer free wins).
---
Also, killer wins most of the time in solo q, and if you’re in the low ranks (yellow and green) then he’ll 4K majority of the time. Solo q is already hard enough but put that with new survivors and the killer will have an easy time. You’ll get better as you play more
---
Steve is one of the best characters in the show that's why.
---
Still waiting for a l4d killer, tank or hunter seems most reasonable... BUT IMMA PLAY THE SHIT OUT OF THE DEMOGORGON
---
Alot of people said this about ash and look what happened
---
I'm sure you'll still like the release, demogorgons are pretty creepy hahah plus 2 survivors, ayeeee 😂

How dare you not pop culture like everyone else! Reeeee!!
---
Plot twist: the salt is harvested from the dried sweat of the epic gamer killers and survivors
---
This needs to be a thing as well as more ways to "Telegraph" perks. I.E. enduring could reduce or remove the "Grunt" when being pallet stunned, fire up could make more and more steam fly out of the killer's ears as each gen is completed. (Can't think of anything less silly. Think someone had an idea to make the red stain brighter or orangey with each gen done).
---
Iron Grasp could have the killer hold onto the survivor much tighter and the survivor's wiggling look much weaker to signify the reduced wiggling speed and effects.
---
They could remove the electrical arcing (Not the sparks but the lightning looking stuff) when kicking a generator and only have it show when the killer is running Overcharge, similar to how Pop Goes The Weasel already has unique red sparks and flames when kicking a generator.
---
NOED could give the killer red glow from the eyes. 
---
Monstrous Shrine could make the basement hooks super brutal and grisey looking with hunks of flesh hanging off the hook, etc.
---
Knockout could "Concuss" a survivor downed for a bit, giving him distorted vision and muffled audio for a few seconds.
---
Shadowborn and Lightborn could make the killer's eyes look a bit different maybe. 
---
Most of the "Tells" should be subtle stuff and not all perks should have a tell. Any other ideas?
---
I feel like ash would easily destroy it
---
It's not any more toxic than most other games. League, Overwatch is equally toxic
---
I'd say it makes them. Although there is a decent amount of salt mines in other communities as well. For Honor and PUBG for example are swarming with brigades of douchebags.
---
Enjoy the game for yourself is my best advice. Don't let the loses or victories go to your head. You may do really well one match or get annihilated the next.
---
You didn't say that tho, you were condescending not helpful that's why you are different. What you said is not the problem its the way you said it, I'm only carrying on with this shit because I can tell that you just refuse to understand that. Just word it nicer. It ain't hard to not be a dick about it.
---
This is true for most of the internet.
---
Enjoy it. His prestige looks really good. When I first prestiged him I threw Scream on to celebrate lol
---
Ye
---
Unless you’re they’re like rank 15-20 survivors should know to be looking out for totems. If all 4 survivors just passively look out for them throughout the game, noed is pretty much completely useless. As long as the survivors are competent and have eyes it’s not at all difficult to find all 5.
---
Get a better pc.

---
Many being the keyword, the ones that there are, everyone finds out about pretty quickly cuz they are popular. With the killers you don't share add ons and certain killers are a lot more popular than others so you're not gonna see them. It would be nice if the in game docs showed you everything you can possibly get on the bloodweb along with the description, like an in game wiki.
---
If you wanna play SWF with me and just have fun, I'd love to. I'm usually pretty chill, especially now that I've mellowed out a bit.

---
I’d love to, do you play on Xbox?
---
Ghost faces perks show up pretty regular in high rank console play.
---
Myers (the killer with the mask and kitchen knife) has an addon that makes him slower but allows him to see survivors through walls up to 32m away.  Indoor maps are basically the only maps that are good for this.
---
theres less views on the newer one but more likes
---
Unfortunately no, I play on PC. I didn't even think about that. But I still hope you find some ways to enjoy the game.
---
Going to be honest this was really shitty
---
It started with permanently sabo'd hooks, moonlight offerings, and no Mori conditions.
---
100%.  
---
Ill even be that guy right now. I got the game free on ps4 last year. Havent spent a dime on this game. Im buying this chapter the second it drops lmao ill get out of work early/stay up late, all that jazz. Like a kid on christmas. I dont even think stranger things is on my top 5 shows list but it fits this game so damn well. And this game is in my top 5 so there you have it.
---
He’s a poseur.
---
I’ll try giving it a break, and see how that works out, and thanks for the offer to play with you though.
---
License is bad?  I mean i get it, original concepts rock but if anything, the licensed characters help keep reeling people into the game and get people hyped. It's one of the thing DBD does right in terms of marketing.

I mean... xenomorph is more associated with the 70s and 80s

You are the one that’s being a dick, I’m trying to explain why they say isn’t true and you are in here like “ur so rude and condescending” find something better to do because once people go on this post and read the whole wall of text they are going to think “what is this dude doing” you are literally changing the whole thing up to make it sound like I’m the dick, when in reality you’re the dick.

When the exit gates are open (or powered?) The killer can down you in one hit, regardless if your health state. You don't know it's active until someone is downed with it.
---
Very deadly on a skilled spirit or nurse. 
---
If it's NOED and your playing in the exit gates and someone gets downed half way across the map, you should probably just leave.

Same. Same here. I'm gonna watch it before getting the DLC along with Vomy Mommy.
---
Madlads.
---
I wonder if the actors from the show will voice act them
---
Thanks
---
MYC is one of my favorite perks I never thought of using it on him 🤔
---
daaaang this looks good.
---
This seems way too overpowered, has a PASSIVE that's better than BBQ and a power stronger than the Huntress in every way. I'd take away the passive, at least
---
What was that "no monsters" rule? Sorry I'm a little behind the times
---
Try it
---
Point, crouch, and vigorously nod. A post game thank you message is pretty swell, too!
---
*ah shit, here we go again*
---
If I had to guess 2 or more perks you can get from one Bloodweb.
---
I’d love to hear more ideas on how to nerf him until he seems a little more fair lol :)) thank you for the feedback!
---
You haven't played it yet so you don't know that you like it.  You like the idea of it.
---
I play on PS4

Just message them after the game

Oh boy oh boy yet another one who's not satisfied with how his game went, shall we call support to listen to how badly you were treated or maybe a therapist to help you get over the fact your ego didn't get the satisfaction it felt entitled to?
---
You got to have something to look forward to man. Bit even if we didnt get them, I'm just excited about all we've got so far
---
I would love to see the predator in dbd
---
You can see the killers PSN ID in the stats screen.
---
I'd say Overwatch is far less toxic with the introduction of role queue.
---
You can see their username in the post match screen and send them a message.
---
Time to get watching on Netflix!
---
I don't know who you are arguing with, but it is obviously not me..? Really not sure what you're doing, I've never asserted that it has I-Frames (I explicitly stated it does not in a separate post) but that it causes false hit registers which is exactly what happened in the OP.  You are, for some reason, explaining my argument to me.
---
Anybody have any theories on what the survivor’s new perks are going to be? I’ve been referring to tvtropes and my knowledge of the show to see how they correspond with their perks.
---
Ah yes “incredibly broken” because it helps the survivors
---
I dont give f**k about the show but a new killer and new survivors are always welcome. Legion is fun to play and play against
---
by the end of s3 I believe they're 18-19.
---
So I’m not the only one who’s been watching it over and over, I’ve seen it about 30 or more times.
---
[It's also the top post of all time on this sub!](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/top/)
---
Proof?
---
If you are really good at juking/looping it will be very hard to one shot you on both of them. It depends on the map though.
---
As someone who aspires to be a great TRICKY survivor main, what builds would you recommend to be sly and tricky? It’s not to upset the killer, but I really want to be a good team player and just be helpful and distract the killer without getting caught. Please and thank you!
---
I’ll be honest I didn’t much care for it season 1 was eh but 2 &amp; 3 really made me like the show I’d say go try it but worse case is everyone’s already told you that
---
Look in the game. Add on descriptions were updated. Now look up the addons on the wiki which show the old descriptions.
---
At least his appearances in the first one were badass
---
There was never a "No Monsters" rule, just look at Hag. Just because they were human once doesn't mean they aren't a monster
---
These things are bad enough when you have a 7 foot axe, i can't imagine what it would be like to not be able to fight back at all
---
Am I the only one who was hoping for 11
---
no u
---
I was playing killer when I was invited to party, then I was laughed at kicked and then my internet went down after they got my ip, later the same person booted me again while I was in a separate match  and then the People from my new match they texted me about how I was bad for dc’ing and how I’m garbage
---
That seems like a fair bet.
---
I'm decent at loops, garbage at juking. It is fairly map dependent for me, but yeah I find the chainsaws difficult to dodge for some reason.
---
Did they do something with legion?
---
oh absolutely, i think thats why komoney like him sprinkled wherever they can- because he is THE most famous character in silent hill, everyone loves the guy
---
No this thing is too far away from humanoid. Also lisence content from another game seems lame a fuck.
---
In addition to nodding, you can leave behind any crappy items that you're willing to sacrifice.
---
i dont wanna see a xenomorph get stopped dead in its tracks from a pallet
---
Rubberneck and slowly crouch towards them. If you have an item you don't want, put it down as an extra measure. They will feel the love
---
I don't care, damnit! Its too perfect!
---
that would just confuse everyone, then you wouldn't know if a gen was being worked on or not, but probably they might add Christmas lights everywhere to serve as a terror radius
---
I have it on ps4. No complaints
---
No lol
---
Yeah I have no clue about stranger things either. Killer looks cool though (hopefully it's good)
---
Do you not see how the killer stutters and the frames spot out during the smoke effect from deactivating night shroud? The frame drop is the most likely culprit for this because if this was sprint burst, there would have been no false hit because he came in at an angle, not from directly behind
---
Into the foreat*
---
I’ve not seen anyone complain about the next chapter, I myself don’t like stranger things and I’m still hyped for it, the trailer was awesome!
---
I didn’t knew the effects of drugs.
---
Now I do.
---
Time to bring in the slap chop
---
You’re a dumbass, likely the low skilled kind to camp. It takes no skill to camp, and I didn’t even say it in the post. I literally called his mom a whore, and now so is yours.
---
Yes, "lol".
---
Its not some impossible task, provided you play the gane regularly and keep up with new characters
---
They had a baby demogorgan In season 2 without the Mind Flayer active. Death may only occur if there is a strong link first. Besides, the entity can take the place of the mind flayer as a surrogate.
---
The entity could make the xenomorph think it's the queen.
---
Toxic anyone in this game is sad. It's four other humans in your game that are trying to have fun and enjoy themselves. Anyone that disregards that is being a dick.
---
hello r/all!
---
You can message ppl by clicking their psn names amd their profile comes up on the results page.  Btw what killer was it
---
I concur. I am aware that trailer graphics will always be superior, but still a bit surprised by her face. Usually this renders are better than in game as well.
---
“Broken” -Killer Mains
---
Why don't people run Huntress' Lullaby and Ruin?
---
I feel like I'm the only one doing it.
---
Pretty much all Hex perks are high risk high reward. They’re some of the most powerful killer perks in the game but they’re a gamble because they can be permanently disabled. Imo it’s worth the risk, more times than not survivors will waste a couple minutes looking for them and cleansing them and those few minutes not spent on gens can mean everything.
---
So that’s how the Baby Shark song was created.
---
well apparently he’s the embodiment of cancer for the retards of dbd
---
There aren't infinites anymore but if you want to camp people who loop annoying structures fine
---
Well, I mean, one of them’s fuckin Bruce Campbell and the other one isn’t.
---
There’s a very clear answer here.
---
Well obviously that isn’t the case. Rank doesn’t mean shit when I have bad teammates who still use Urban Evasion in red ranks.
---
“But it’s just the na-“
---
“BrOkEn”
---
So no?
---
Look at the scoreboard and message them lol I play on PS4 too
---
When the knee bends the other way.
---
Survivor main here, do what you gotta do, especially if they're toxic af.
---
They're the same thing, trying to take over the world using two disguises.
---
Maybe it’s because I love Ash and the Evil Dead franchise, but I can’t understand why I’ve seen so many people complaining about his voice lines recently. Like, who doesn’t want Bruce Campbell introducing himself in the lobby?
---
You can change a radio station, you can't just change the channel when it's plastered in one of your favorite games or when it's all over my streaming service. Instead I have to deal with it. I don't have to bear it and stand around like an idiot.
---
i find it petty but do what you have to do
---
*wraith sounds*
---
Haha nice. When someone would rescue you from a hook you'd be like damn, this person is a motherfucking. I remember being like ok I will drop this pallet here, so the killer can't get through this area very quickly. Yea, I still get the blood flowing vs some good killers or but it ain't like it used to be.
---
Aggressive autocorrect
---
It's meant to be derogatory? I always wore the *gen jockey* label with pride.
---
That dingleberry of the wiggle meter pisses me off something serious. I'm always a spit away from wiggling out, but that last second laggy shit disregards it.
---
apparently the bad players hate him and find him horrible to play/play against
---
How do people in 2019 still not realize you can find almost any show online for free?
---
because it is set at a set speed so do not wiggle it like a mad man
---
Huntress Lullaby is amazing, as a survivor it's 1000x worse than Ruin. I can hit great skill checks no problem but when Huntress Lullaby gets past tier 2, it fucks me up beyond belief and throws me into panic mode.
---
I think if there is no Ruin, nobody cares and nobody looks for totems.
---
Wait what, are you sure it's not just a wording change? For example I think the tablet addon for Plague says it "Moderately" decreases time to ingest corruption but it completely removes it. 
---
Is it possible they just changed the phrasing and didn't touch the actual stats?
---
Never underestimate pallets, my guy
---
I know this but I specifically wanted to watch it on my ps4 with netflix
---
Sorry I think you misunderstood, I meant you don't need to be that *skilled* with a key board and mouse to play that game. As far as comparing it to like Rainbow Six Siege or something which will greatly punish you if you can't flick and be precise by the pixel
---
It’s not like what survivor someone plays even makes a difference 99% of the time, and just because you don’t like the show doesn’t mean you have to hate the content.
---
No tunneling is not against the rules it's a stat not a good one but a strat
---
That could be said about all the killers though. The right spirit can be 10x better than the hag. The right meyers can be 10x better than the doc. There's just too many variables when it comes to addons, offerings, personal skill, survivors skill, survivors addons and offerings, the map you play, whether they're in a 4 man swf, etc. Way too many variables my man.
---
You can't see it well but look behind me does that not look like claws? I was thrown off what do you guys think?
---
Yeah ill see about that thanks
---
It is tunneling and camping. Neither are bankable.
---
The frame drop is because of the night shroud ending, which is a result of the swing ending (just watch the video a couple times around the 5s mark) . Can you see the problem with this reasoning?
---
False hits are not exclusive to hits from behind and I don't know why I would put much weight in the word of someone who apparently didn't even know they existed until thirty minutes ago - you were just arguing that it was a latency / player input problem, after all.
---
And predators.
---
  
---
Imagine if they start with a shitty invisibility that malfunctions when they get hit with a pallet, run through tall grasses, or hit a survivor. And after three pallet stuns they lose the cloaking. But their ability is a heat vision that works like Halo 4's Promethean vision, and it recharges after 45 seconds.
---
Their melee would just be their arm weapon.
---
Just don’t run ruin.
---
It's used in a sense as a jumpscare build. Scratched Mirror makes it so you stay in Tier 1, which has a low terror radius, and can see through walls with EW. combine it with Monitor and Abuse and you effectively have no terror radius. pair with any other perks and item you like. most people use it as a fun build, some people like it to be extra toxic, ymmv.
---
I think the Predator would also be incredible
---
It’s always a Claudette for me...
---
Michael Myers? Pfft. Never heard of him. Freddy Krueger? Hah! In your dreams. The Bye Bye Man is more iconic and brilliantly crafted than either of them, and yet they’re in the game and he isn’t. Smh my head these devs...
---
Do you play on console? I play on PC and it usually takes about 10-15 minutes to find a game as killer
---
No, it's jake's cosmetic.
---
You can legit lock onto a survivor mid hit with SB, only for it to miss. That's an I frame
---
Thats a good guess. Being able to go straight to level 3 would be awesome too. Like why should i have to get one two and three? Drives me nuts.
---
...And I LOVE IT!
---
Thank you very much.
---
They could have a different hook system for the xenomorph
---
Yeah I'm on console, killer is so fast because there are so many god damn survive with friends
---
It infuriates me how he's pronouncing that xD
---
Because good survivors dont miss skill checks i think
---
It’s not an I frame. It’s a timing issue, not an I frame. do we need to directly ask the devs? if sprint burst granted I frames it would have been nerfed into oblivion a long time ago
---
We should have predator with arnold schwarzenegger as a survivor and terminator with arnold schwarzenegger as a killer
---
Those aren’t just stonks, those are MEGA STONKS!
---
It's really annoying that it's a set speed. Like, I feel the game should reward my button mashing lol. Then again, this isn't Tekken.
---
Because they wanted to artificially inflate progression.  Some of the level 3 perks aren't even better than the level 1 versions.
---
Hey don't disrespect sleepy boi....even though he looks nothing like the one from the movie
---
REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Good
---
Hahaha.  Okay that was me with tombstone Myers. I was flabbergasted
---
There's a maximum amount you can move your stick to wiggle
---
You could be spinning it at 50mph and the meter will still go up at the same rate
---
Google lithe build
---
I personally like Nancy more, but I completely understand why some people like Steve more.
---
This is freaking badass! I can't wait!
---
Aww, they were like Little Shop of Horror plants running around getting toasted by Claire RIP
---
This fanboying over Stranger Things is already making me nauseous and it's not even out yet. Just smug bragging about BHVR doing a cash grab chapter and adding an alien to a human roster of Killers. Glad we're throwing out the themes for money.
---
It's a cool idea sure, But i'd like to add (I'm just copying from a super long comment I just made to a similar answer).
---
"But wouldn't you agree that it be really weird for an Alien to not kill someone who hurt them physically? Like if you throw down a Pallet on an Alien and the Flashlight stunned it. Do really think the Alien would care to put a Facehugger on you instead of just killing you? Xenomorphs mostly just kill the Movies, They every-now-and-then put them on the Walls or Use Facehuggers (May be different in books and comics idk).
---
And people may have said "Well if the Alien is alone it probably needs more Aliens" which wouldn't work either since in the Movies there is often just 1 Xenomorph taking out everyone instead of a bunch of them.
---
And again, Yes it may not make any sense at all for some killer to put survivors on hooks and then leave them there and then chase them again incase they get freed. But I still think it would make the least sense for an Alien to do so. Even if you change it to the Alien Material, How would survivors free them? (IF I'm right, Which I'm maybe not) Isn't the Alien Material pretty fucken' tough and Hard to get out of?"
---
That’s exactly what tunneling is
---
Fuckin Ochido and his brain dead fans spread the toxicness like a wildfire.
---
Thanks all!
---
Quick&amp;quiet, lithe, dance with me, lightweight
---
Xbox got the memo, just not the game pass players
---
wiggle timer has a set duration. you have to wiggle "at least this fast". if you could do that, people would just set up a macro that would wiggle them off instantly and killers couldn't judge how far they can carry you
---
What's this from?
---
I am more interesting in how broken they’ll be and how much time they r gonna wait to fix them/make them useless.
---
Steve is a dick in season 1 but changes for the better and becomes a single mother of 6 kids and doesn’t need Nancy in his life to make him feel valued. Steve&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nancy
---
Not that it'll change your mind at all, because you are quite biased in one direction, but lets compare. Old mettle of man, was similar in nature to the spirit fury/enduring combination. Except, the spirit fury combo takes 2 perk slots, isnt even really a garunteed hit depending on where it happens, AND can actually just be flat out cancelled, if the survivor opts to drop the pallet slightly sooner, instead of going for slams. Not to mention, 4 killer perks in a game, vs 16 survivor perks. Did they overnerf  it? Yes, because frankly it was poorly designed. I do hope that they rework it into something good for survivors, as someone who plays both sides, but the game is healthier with it dead for now, just as the game was healthier when they garbage canned freddy after release. Its sad, but it happens sometimes.
---
Nancy, I'm so sorry
---
Honestly Jason would be a perfect fit despite there being a Friday the 13th game. Lore wise, The Entity could just mimic Jason's mother and order him to make sacrifices to the entity in the hope of reviving his mommy.
---
Whiteface kronk new killer?
---
Ohh that's satisfying!
---
Rank 17 survivors generally are new to the game, though. You wouldn't have this issue at rank 10.
---
he just wanted to voice his opinion ;\^)
---
I actually think it's just a bait
---
It’s from Torako! Don’t break everything! It’s basically hentai but as a comedy.
---
it's things like macros that make me wish PC gaming never existed.
---
Like, they could easily implement an idea like I had, but can't because it'd negatively effect the "pro" scene.
---
And naturally, we would be Ripley. And maybe Mr Jones the cat as a new woodland creature!?
---
Just need Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, Child's Play, Candyman, Alien and Predator
---
That’s it’s
---
Season 3 steve is best case closed
---
literally nothing happens to your model in any of those, you don't get cut in half, your guts aren't spilled out and as far as I'm concerned Ghostface's isn't much different from many others. The closest thing we have is decapitation of 1 of your fingers by Clown.
---
Have been following the game for months but just recently got to play it, are the optimization updates live, if not, do the devs have somewhere I can keep track of said updates?
---
I heard that dedicated servers were coming too, but seems that they aren't live yet, will those also improve the game's running speed?
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
So many slaps
---
Infinite’s don’t exist. If you’re referring to extremely survivor biased loops like the Ironwork loop and the Abattoir loop, you’ll eventually catch them. Hence why they’re not infinite. They’re time wasters.
---
Steve is the best character in the show in seasons 2 and 3, and Nancy becomes extremely forgettable after season 1.
---
They could play off of Freddy V Jason where Freddy brainwashes him it could totally work
---
Ok so you dont see the limbs detached but theres still shit tons of blood spraying all over the screen in a majority of them

---
Did you forget about on launch MoM  also jane wasn't released with two other survivors. This is gonna be by far the biggest expansion yet and i have some doubts on BHVR's ability to balance all that. But we'll see
---
I'd personally rather see things being consistent. Wiggling off takes exactly 16 seconds. fair and simple. Killer can carry someone 58.9 m in one direction unless someone bodyblocks. Everyone knows everything and no one has to guess
---
 [**/dbdgonewild**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdgonewild/)
---
should be wiggle, but damn
---
Message the killer then
---
They could do a Dart skin
---
Yes. If they did, they could introduce perks that interact with it. And that would be awesome.
---
If you aren't getting progress on a generator because of Ruin, does it count for the coop action time for the 180 seconds of coop daily ritual?
---
Nancy with that red coat with the fur?? Hell yeah
---
Same with Nightmare on Elm Street
---
Click his name after the name on the results screen and shoot him a message
---
I don’t know how you’d work that in though any perks he could have seem like they’re already taken. Really the only trait he had was super strength to my knowledge and maybe some mind manipulation if you count what happened with Eleven, the only perk I could think of for billy would be whenever an item or perk reveals your aura for survivors you reverse uno that shit and get to see them. I can’t think of a single interesting ability he could have other than maybe some infection thing that’s a mix between the Pig’s headlocks and Plague’s vomit
---
I need to hear the xenomorph shriek when you find a survivor, I wanna feel like one of them, finding the invader of their nest. Of they make it happen, the xenomorph must be heard!
---
i don't think it is to be honest. The pants on David where not spiked ones and the lighting followed the claws at it moved. If it was the spikes it wouldn't reflect the light that way. Plus the seem more layered then a pixel tear.
---
what about the entity?
---
Just do a circular motion its more comfortable and you dont wiggle faster cause thats just how the game is
---
it slowed the game down tho
---
just a lil tiny bit
---
*Slap* but I still love ya
---
If it needs something to control it, what says the Entity can't?
---
I didn't watch it either but I'm still excited
---
Camping is bad dont do that you wouldn't like getting one hooked cause the killer is a camper
---
Was hoping for "Wazzzzz uuuuuupp"

Waiting for the next chapter for the purpose of you changing your new main.
---
cute rize (:
---
I think its justifiable if its a killer that camps you after your first hook
---
It'd be cool if he had a longer pause (anticipation phase) before the kick just to make up for the time decrease and make it look like a more powerful kick
---
Over a million views and #1 on trending currently. Just posted a screenshot of it!
---
Because it is pretty risky. RNG ruins hex perks.
---
You lose both totems and now you're playing with 2 perks when you could be running pop, nurse's, enduring, bbq, monitor etc.

Noice
---
Their original vision was human Killers from classic horror movies. Halloween, saw, leather face, everything had the same theme and it did well.
---
I think Stranger Things is grossly overrated and this chapter breaks the theme they had for the sake of money and popularity.
---
This subreddit is infested with smug posts about how people were wrong about it being added and I'm irritated that any time I talk negatively about the series or point out that this chapter is an obvious break from tradition, I get burned with downvotes.
---
I don't want this and I have zero ability to stop it. I would have preferred ***content*** if it meant staying on theme. This frustrates me and the community losing their minds over it further increases my salt.
---
Oh well. Fuckin alien Killers now.
---
Something like Alien from Isolation would work really well. Slow stomping around the map, maybe with a vents mechanic for fast travel. 
---
He even checked lockers in the game!
---
entity: *laughs in superior*
---
I play both sides I had the same realization when I started killer. I find I often think tunneler or camper when I play survivor, and toxic survivor when I play killer.
---
Bring out the VHS porn, it's gonna be a loooooooooooooong night
---
Mind Flayer and The Entity are the same entity
---
The Spirit WAS a human and is now a spectre, therefore not a human
---
I mean... those addon sucked some salty bill mains balls

The scariest shit is watching Ghostface or Myers stalking you from a long hallway
---
Fuck Orochi light spammers too lmao, really hard to react to on controller.
---
It's not face camping, it's admiring you
---
*Tiny face*
---
Please be joking
---
Yeah no matter how fast you wiggle it doesn’t spread or slowdown. That’s why you should just do it in slow circular motions so you don’t break your controller (I have) ... best bet is getting boil over for a harder time, but even that doesn’t work unless you make it into a build (flip flop, unbreakable, tenacity, boil over) on Leary’s while saboing hooks
---
nope. why would it be?
---
NANCYYYYY

N A N C Y Y Y Y Y

I don’t care how many times i die, i’m using my DK to save every baby Steve/Nancy i see

Does prestiging take away surivivor unique perks for that survivor?
---
Doesn't steve have like a great character arc
---
Huh, so either ghost recon, maaaaaybe r6 or for honor?
---
Worthless and p2w are the same because the p2w will be nerfed until useless

Hay ghost face is a iconic figure and I can stab someone then go waaaazzzzzz uuuuupppp and before the game send them “what’s your favourite scary movie” gets the best reactions every time.

And my boy Steve!

Wait but they actually got the rights this time so no knockoffs here.

How about let them stalk through walls, maybe penalize the survivors for looking at him?

No. They don't.

New Killer: The pallet
---
Power: Summons an AI controlled random killer to fool the survivors into believing it's just a normal match. If a survivor uses a pallet, it crushes them and they die.
---
God forbid people enjoy things.
---
Why is this meme me exactly?
---
Billy and Russian dude are too humanoid to be killers and the demodog is too similar to the demogorgon
---
Conversely, Michael is my favorite killer to play against, for those stated reasons.
---
It's more fun to have a jumpscare than it is to hope that the Spirit chooses the wrong direction
---
Funny how we are getting a survivor named Nancy, bet Freddy is really happy about that.
---
I have a feeling that these will be used for when you view the background information these will be the protraits used
---
So how come they can get Steve and Nancy so accurately but we ended up with whatever Quentin is.
---
Or... New to the game... Most babies run S-C because they don't know enough at the beginning to know it's not a very good perk. Being a dick doesn't make you automatically good at the game either.
---
Silent Hill was massively popular so I have zero clue what you mean.  It even became popular in the west, something that wasn't normal, which is why Konami made the fools errand of trying to get a western silent hill to take off more.  It's like saying Metal Gear Solid or Yakuza aren't popular because of their different takes on genres and nonwestern creation.  Silent Hill 2, 3 and I believe 4 were on the Playstation 2 Hit Collection for *years* because of how well they did, getting tons of extra longevity from all these other

I’m just exited for the game to be available to as many people as possible and fans of stranger things can experience the same fun we’ve all been having in our DBD experience.

Great for indoor maps, since there’s plenty of walls to stay out of sight. When playing scratched mirror Myers you also take monitor and abuse to drop your terror radius to zero. However, you move with 105% speed so it’s fucking horrendous on any outdoor maps.
---
Oh yea?
---
True. Nancy is more well known though so I can see why. Still love Nance tho she’s a bit of a whore
---
I am going to be dropping another $20 anyways if there's a scoops ahoy outfit + i need an outfit for nancy since that's my new main

#1 on trending on what site?
---
I'm gonna assume you're one of those IQ 7000 survivors who DC's when they see a Spirit or likes to say shit like 'gg ez still won' in post-match chat even though you got sacrificed.   
---
Nothing says 'shit at the game' like refusing to even try to learn how to play against certain killers.
---
Love watching you dude. Your my son’s role model!
---
By ‘Alien’ I mean the creature from the ‘Alien’ movies. Nobody owns the concept of an actual alien lol
---
It would be nice at least to practice and stuff. They’ll never add it though, as they want everyone playing online. Too many people would play this single player mode after having terrible player encounters, lol.
---
Looks better than Laurie
---
At least they both look better than Laurie and Quentin (sorry quentin i love u and play as u often but ur face is uh....different)
---
Hello there
---
I also agree. I was hopeful it was possible to happen but was expecting the worst. SO happy to see it!
---
B
---
I just want Candyman. Please, just put me out of my misery and add Candyman.
---
I'd drop an addition $50 for it if we're being honest here
---
New pictures for ghosty!
---
It's a 3D render where the only thing that has to be processed is the model itself, as opposed to in-game where it has to render the environments of the map.
---
So no. I don't think the game will ever quite look this good (though the artstyle it already has is fairly unique)
---
Now just fix the god damn party system
---
To clarify, because 'PC' isn't a good explanation: those who play DBD on PC have access to the game files, which means we can download custom perk icons and replace the ones in the game files. Same with the survivor and killer portraits. Anyone with those perks is on PC.
---
Hold up. You let a person flashlight stun you while you were in frenzy? I do believe it’s a thing yes. And it should be. It would be ridiculous if you were suddenly stunned out of your control. That’s not balanced. If you pick ups survivor and get flashlight stunned that’s on you for not getting the other survivor. But if you’re just running straight ahead and get blinded you are taken out of frenzy.
---
Ps. You can turn your camera around to not get stunned...
---
That's a big no from me dog.
---
Same here. Think it's a reddit issue. Thought I was going crazy
---
Scoops Ahoy Cosmetic please!
---
Absolutely me.
---
They won't do new games even if it could sell because Konami wants to westernize their game too hard even though their Japanese creative team was the reason why the games were good and sold so well in the first place.
---
After Origins each game that was being made was made by worse and worse devs to the point where they just started picking up no-names for cheaper development costs at expense of quality, leaving the HD Port of the games to a fucking mostly mobile dev team.
---
Well that’s what I mean, this dlc will just mean a lot of money for both companies, of course that means it’ll also help BHVR
---
I made it ^ ^
---
Haha, yeah, let's ruin the experience for new players so the game dies out.
---
Same thing for me and I can't see a lot of comments as well
---
I did this too but I would just smack whoever got close and go back to ruin. The survivors tried so hard to get the ruin and they message me after the game that it was the most fun they had lol
---
I was running at her and she saw me so she had time to aim it and flashlight me but barely. She kept failing to flashlight me and the one time she did it lead to her death lol. I never knew it was a thing and had to test it with a friend after to confirm it. I wasn't just standing still and I know how to dodge flashlights, no need to try and explain how to. I got cocky against her and it made me learn something I didn't before.
---
No it will not.  I can’t do both since the drill is pretty big and so far I’m not sure how big the motor will be. 
---
Maybe someday I’ll make a hidden blade that can actually be hidden :3
---
Omg, time to save 7$
---
Well there's only one solution to this...
---
* 1 Steve = Go for a 3k
---
* 2 Steves = Go for a 2k
---
* 3 Steves = Go for a 1k
---
* 4 Steves = Try to party with them until they escape...
---
Me too, actually. It shows maybe 2 or 3 comments even though it says there's 20+. And I can't see my own either.
---
About my reaction when Myers swept the floor with my ass first time with this add on
---
all of us
---
Couldn't agree more with this post. When the company is making so many great changes to improve their game with the community in mind, supporting them financially becomes a no brainer.
---
Use better wording next time lawl
---
I've never seen Stranger Things before and yet I'm super hyped for that beautiful beast. Demogorgon, was it?
---
I’ll bitch about what I damn please
---
I wish they did something about tunneling and camping, otherwise all the new players are going to go down the drain.
---
Pfff like this community would even dare to play nice with new players. I will personally but I'll play a little harsh so they learn faster.
---
That Steve Harrington, so hot right now
---
I've not finished watching more than the first season of Stranger Things and just a little bit into the second, but so far (spoilers):
---
&gt;!1: Track the location of targets who are bleeding in the real world even while inside the Upside Down, is referred to inside of one of the episodes as "like a shark". (Too similar to Bloodhound? Too similar to Wraith bell addons to increase the visibility of blood? Too similar to Hemorrhage perks/addons?)!&lt;
---
&gt;!2: Infect individuals with its offspring, supposedly happens AvP style, held captive with a tube down their throat. (Too similar to Plague?)!&lt;
---
&gt;!3: Open, close, and traverse throughout the city through portals to the Upside Down. (Too similar to Freddy teleport?)!&lt;
---
&gt;!4: Pull individuals into the Upside Down. (Too similar to old-Freddy's dreaming?)!&lt;
---
&gt;!5: Violently break out of the surroundings to attack individuals who attract its interest. (Too similar to Hag traps?)!&lt;
---
&gt;!6: Cause individuals to hallucinate (bending and warping walls, breaking wood and concrete in an attempt to push through, with the wall being unharmed afterward) or otherwise experience effects of "seeing" into the Upside Down while still in the real world.!&lt;
---
&gt;!7: Controlled by a hive mind that:!&lt;
---
&gt;!7a: Is aware and can communicate to "impregnated" individuals or individuals who have spent too long inside of the Upside Down. (Currently portrayed as hallucinations and being able to see/feel things, not direct verbal communication, but capable of expressing intentions such as violence/murder).!&lt;
---
&gt;!7b: Controls the Demogorgons directly (as far as I know), allowing multiple to work towards the same goal (probably too complicated to switch which Demogorgon you are controlling, but people have wanted multiple active Killer shells and would love the inactive shells tracking based on blood or infection stages, allowing them to close with survivors even as the Demogorgon chases someone).!&lt;
---
&gt;!7c: Exerts more influence over the real world over time, growing through opens rifts inexorably.!&lt;
---
I honestly don’t care if the demogorgon is a weak as pre rework Freddy I’m gonna main them forever
---
Can't wait for the new killer to be useless and play nurse again!
---
Did somebody say 4 raiders ganking me?
---
Not sure of your age but some Debit cards cannot be used online if you are under 16
---
I’m pretty sure I would be able to do that in the future honestly. As long as it isn’t a blade that is spinning or vibrating. 
---
I do need a new hidden blade either way since I broke mine last con by ambushing a Myers back :{
---
Personally I'm jumping off meg gang for steve gang
---
I haven’t spent anything on dbd either other than buying the base game this is gonna be my first dlc
---
You poopy head I'm going to protect my Micheal myers so I can choke them both to death with my tombstone cause Micheal is now big boy
---
I didn’t really pay attention so where they worked lol. I keep wanting to call it chips ahoy so this is better at least lol.
---
NO SCOOPS NO BUY

You my guy we shall play survivor and if ots a demegorgen being ass we shall teach him how to play or tell him to wacth some streamers and youtubers
---
Yes you do :/
---
Y'all are just horror nerds.
---
Haha.
---
I literally never knew any of this.
---
They said they want only humanoid killers thats a difference
---
I’ll downvote you just for the heck of it. Punk
---
Well said
---
I've been wanting Harry Warden from my bloody valentine so badly ever since I started because I love his design. But yea this game has come far and I didn't even know they had Micheal,Pig,Leatherface Freddy etc when I joined so seeing them was a delight
---
Why hasn’t Jason vorhees been added
---
"Me getting trying"
---
But that's what would have made it more memeable
---
They humanoid not humans it is a difference, because the demegorgon has the shape of a human
---
Yep, you'll have to level him to 35 to get Borrowed Time before it can be found in the bloodwebs of characters who don't have it, or ones that you prestiged.
---
That might make the game R rated, meaning harder to get licensing and possibly profit drops.
---
Would be nice though.
---
So...How would this work on Lerys or the game map?
---
so you condemn people for expressing their hopes. Possibly giving bhvr ideas and not hurting anyone. Have you considered that you are in the minority feeling people only get excited for new things?
---
I bet you would tell someone on their first game how much they suck and to uninstall.
---
Aye smash community shut the hell up about their list those characters take time to master you big bag of dicks I know how it is
---
lmao! Also Wtf why did i get downvoted? lol.this community full of losers 😂 But not u MafiaDoge. Kill them with Michael.

Not to mention that if you're a generator and broken, you can generally by caught or cut off before you reach a safe loop.
---
Infection duration addons let the Plague force survivors off five different generators unless they get infected and lets her know where they are.
---
They either touch an infected generator, or visit one of the two that aren't continuously infected.
---
She breaks everyone and goes to town, you can't hide when injured and infected and sending off waves of fumes and coughing and vomiting and trying to repair a generator.
---
From what I've seen of Plague guides, forcing people to run and getting three infected before your first hook is ideal.
---

Oh shit. Netflix is trying to prepare us for season 4
---
This better be directly written into the game lmao
---
PTB will probably after the dev update this week, so probably next Tuesday. The chapter release is 2 weeks after the PTB launches.
---
maybe next week ? as for the launch maybe 10th of September. I don't know why but i heard people say it
---
youtube US
---
oh shit hag is actually a Wendigo?
---
Animalistic is broken. Survivors would never be able to escape.
---
I'd have Scent of Blood be whenever gaining a stack of bloodlust, for x seconds instead of the whole duration of bloodlust, for similar reasoning to Animalistic.
---
Don't know where you two play, but Overwatch is still a salt mine. Every single game is people throwing out of spite for some silly reason, and comp is just a bunch of assholes yelling over each other if they don't play perfectly.
---
All the killers that tunnel and camp me when I don't teabag makes me want to start but I don't.
---
Aaaaand I'm terrified.
---
I don't get why you make it sound unbelievable that in a world of the supernatural like DBD's, a pocket dimension monster like the entity could function. Like he's basically Freddy in that he has his own world where he can dominate the enviroment.
---
Alexei is just Russian Dwight
---
Fucking yes
---
Just friend them and message them
---
Sorry to hear that, man. If you ever feel like giving  the game another chance, I'd recommend playing Billy or Spirit, and taking some time to practice a bit more. They are both very good, as you've probably heard, and don't require the skill level of Nurse to play well. You'll likely be met with a bit more success with them.
---
However, at the end of the day, you're still going to want to "find the fun," so to speak, and learn to have some fun even when you're not "winning." No matter how good you get, you'll almost certainly eventually rank up to a point where the game becomes very difficult, and if you're not able to have some fun despite that you'll be back in the same boat you're in now.
---
Gl m8
---
That's the definition of tunneling though
---
Like the insta heal addons? Or? Because the others are just passive. But if you mean the insta heal, you literally just click the secondary action button. (Aka the button you click to succeed a skill check) So you just hold down the button to use the med kit and then hit the secondary action button even when there's no skill check and you'll insta heal.
---
*obligatory made with mematic comment*
---
They don't care about the blood points as much as robbing you from the satisfaction of hooking them.
---
It doesn't run bad on ps4 imo. Did you actually test it? But no, probably not cross-progress at all.
---
Please behaviour, this
---
They are punishing you. If they DC you get no bloodpoints in the sacrifice category. They punish themself to ruin your game basically.
---
I must say, this is one of the best thought out ideas for any killer I've ever seen. Everything looks pretty good. The one thing is that the backstory seems a bit too long for a DBD killer. Hood job! Better than I could've done!
---
The game will actually kick off? You do realize that there is a pretty sizeable amount of people playing the game daily right? This probably will attract new people but let's not act like dead by daylight is dead or something
---
Thanks for the red circle OP I really would’ve missed it if not for it.
---
Maybe the sight it's on
---
Thank you! I am thinking about making the story shorter for dbd, but I'm just glad you took the time to read it!
---
My man, its literally just the community.
---
Am I the only one that things they're oddly adorable? Espacially Neomorphs. So cute
---
I think Stranger Things is very much a mash up of a few genres. If you take season 1 you can easily split up the plot into 1/3 Steven Spielberg coming of age story, 1/3 Stephen King Supernatural Thriller, and 1/3 John Carpenter horror, which is where Nancy, and to extent Steve’s characters come in. Later on these obviously shifted and changed a lot but I’d definitely say there’s some roots in horror.
---
maybe beacause you camp, tunnel, lag or abuse other defaults in the mechanics and they are tired of it.
---
I mean it’s not impossible seeing as we have two full on survivors for one dlc (along with the killer and assuming that the two survivors aren’t just one with two different skins like the legion has 4)
---
Haha yes. I’ve tested it. Even simple YouTube clips can show a major difference. 
---
I’m more curious how the mobile version will even be possible.
---
If there are true infinites, you're chasing poorly
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure they are convinced that every or even most killer(s) lag switches, for some reason.
---
We’re in the same boat lmao
---
The joke is that Freddy Krueger is a child diddler.
---
All Legions are equally waifu and I will not take any other answers! &gt;:0

Susie has that scene grrl aesthetic,

Frank’s got his twink ass,

Will proximity chat ever be a thing for survivors? It’s definitely able to be countered by discord but fwiw, it takes extra effort to do and console would change significantly. I’d love to be able to hear other survivors as well in those games. As a killer it would balance survive with friends. There are work around a but atm they are the same as the game is right now anyways.
---
If you don't immediately wander off to the other side of the map (even if there is nothing to do there and no reason to go there), survivors will say you are a camper
---
*dier
---
"Mothers intuition", you move faster when running in the direction of other injured survivors, you move much faster when running towards a hooked survivor (in a certain range)
---
Spitting straight facts
---
This year seems to only be licensed content. Next chapter is probably going to be a killer only, so it makes sense that it is a license.
---
It was Number one on trending for a little bit like thats insane for 15 second trailer for a game add on

Predator Hunting Grounds will die out faster than Last Year The Nightmare.

Yeah dedicated servers can mitigate this issue but you can easily leave any lobbies with high latency by checking the ping indicator...

(Last two are preference based, but my most successful are)

&gt; Enduring + Spirit fury
---
Or
---
&gt;Discordance + Brutal Strength / or whatever you think would be best. I've done whispers, blood warden, thrill of the hunt... You pretty much have to stalk three full people entirely. It's a mix of luck in stupid survivors or big misplays

Please everyone withhold being toxic to them. New players is what this game needs and if everyone hate messages all the noobies they are just gonna uninstall

That’s a face hugger

There is a dead body in the trailer in the hallway the demogorgon is coming from

I feel your pain. I’ve been tunneled 30 seconds into my first match, farmed off hook, and sandbagged at least twice tonight.

As a Canadian I’m stoked this game gaining more traction with people. &lt;3 it
---
If you run through a hole in the ground... chances are you're going to fall. Hope you remember this for future life experiences.
---
&gt;  If anything, survivors should lose most of the time to fit the theme of a slasher simulator
---
it's not a movie. It's a game.
---
Yes! I’d be interested in seeing that!
---
Timing has to be pretty spot on, and you need clear space in front. If your dead hard comes up short their lunge can still hit just as protection ends.
---
I've been waiting for stranger things for over a year, I don't think even Jason could take over now.

Oh ok, yeah that’ll be cool

Eww Jason go away.
---
It's biggest power is its ability to travel between parallel dimensions by creating/exploiting weak spots in the fabric of reality.  It also shares a type of hive-mind, including any people who've been "infected".  
---
Other than that, it can climb walls and ceilings with its claws.
---
That sounds like a shitty night so far. I just don’t get it. We were actually having a decent match before she did that. The worst part is that I healed her when she came up the stairs and then she blocked me in.

Ah thanks. Sounds pretty obvious

Im breaking friendship with Laurie for Nancy

A comment further up said it just a soft ban.

Cooldown+crouch speed addons. Crouching around to sneak up on gens without being seen is something I spend a lot of the match doing, so the extra speed is invaluable. Cooldown for more time in Night Shroud.
---
Surveilence and Discordance are especially good on him, but I've been able to put out the most pressure with my playstyle by running BBQ, Nurse's, MYC, and PGTW. Between GF's power getting people to 99% stalk and surprise injuring them, and MYC, most survivors tend to be one-hit for much of the match. Nurse's gets a lot of downs as well, especially combo'd with MYC. Sneaking back over to a recent unhook often reveals the exposed rescuer healing the injured unhooked surv, both one hit away from death and eazy to sneak up on. PGTW turns the constant downs into additional pressure by regressing gens.
---
I'm not in red though, so take my advice with a grain of salt. I play ranks 6-8 on PC.
---
I think its gonna be awesome to have something new!
---
Sranger Things is awesome.

Same with Bill.
---
Not many people will disagree. They're annoying in the 1 in 15 games you see one, but they're not that big of a deal.
---
It could also make the amount of time it takes to blind a killer shorter
---
And maybe an ebony
---
Xeno December confirmed.
---
Good question 🤔
---
HA, that's wishful thinking.
---
The poor survivior
---
Wait what?
---
Yup. I'm in a lobby right now. Waiting.
---
No Mercy
---
*Laughs with spine chill*
---
I don't really understand why they would limit themselves to "no cool monsters or interesting changes to gameplay outside of a humanoid killer model". Like other than gameplay reasons, which in it self should/could be worked around with proper game design, I feel they should just go for a crawling demogorgon or a super speedy tiny Chucky!
---
why does the trailer have 1.6k dislikes do people just not like stranger things that much
---
When I’m in a mood, I’ll run Lithe and Dance With Me. It’s not amazing because veteran killers will catch on pretty quickly, but in low ranks it really is a fun way to juke.
---
i know Spirit is like very inspired by Sadako and Kayako, but i still believe both of them have pretty good source material for a power
---
Yeah,the top section has basically 0 windows to loop,you gotta stay at the bottom if you want to survive.
---
i’m literally just not going to kill either of them if i face them
---
either that or people hate when leaks are proven true, also that's not an uncommon ratio
---
Other than giving Freddy Hag-like teleport, I pretty much agree with all of this. Normally when I see stuff like this it's super unbalanced, but this is mostly common sense. (Please save my poor boy Legion).
---
Bill
---
jonathan sweetie im so sorry
---
\*Avengers Theme starts playing\*
---
\*rough badass voice saying\*: The greatest Crossover Event in History....!
---
That entirely depends how the contract is written.
---
I think its probably people dont like DBD that much
---
He has his own dbd-style game. Although licensed, they're still being sued.
---
Friday the 13th is it's own game tho, so I doubt Behavior will do it.
---
r/woooosh
---
Where did you read the bios?
---
christ....
---
Well if thats how it works lets ask for kira instead
---
Their faces in the shot look like weird digitized Rami Maleks...
---
Not commenting about what you said, I just recognized your name. I think we just played a game together on Badham against a Michael. You were Dwight I think wearing a yellow cosmetic..? Either case ggs!
---
That was such a good play!
---
Yes, or *was*, which is the thing mentioned by the writers. All killers so far *have been* human. Demogorgon will be the first that has not.
---
No one is saying he is anymore important than anyone else. Hes even saying, "people hat do things like this really suck, it makes the game no fun." You need to relax and not think anything that doesnt conform to your specific ideals, is an attack against you, or your thoughts. His point is on your side. The best way to stop, toxicity- is to. It be toxic. If killers being toxic bothers you, dont stoop to Their level and just "gg" on to the next one. Enough of us get this mentality, it wont be fun to be a dick. At least that's theory, anyways.
---
In the newer Freddy films it's pretty much stated he didn't just kill kids, he also diddled them first.
---
Good idea but the perks a bit strong. take away the chest thing and the faster blind and it'll be A-Okay because instablinds are already a problem. Maybe add a slower flashlight usage rate thing or something like that.
---
I agree with a lot of stuff here, but on the pig: how are we supposed to tell if it's a coin flip or a designated box? Of course the last box is a guarantee. If you go to three boxes and none of them have the key, it's pretty clear the last one is going to have it. How would we be able to tell the difference?
---
Indeed but only the mask really looks like it and the mask isn't even the correct model also Warden wore a black Miners helmet I believe
---
tbh i'm on board with this
---
Imagine judging people for having fun
---
I thought this was normal. Do you mean to say skill checks were 60fps on PS4?
---
Can we all just agree that most PvP multiplayer games are Cesspools
---
Nah Frank's the best. He doesn't need any bells and whistles, he just needs to stab. Besides, Joey's pants are wack.
---
That said, Joey has the best knife, and Susie has the best mask, those are facts.
---
Yes, that was the point of my comment, for the tenth time.
---
Micheals won’t mind doing it
---
Am I the only one that wants pennywise?
---
Most of the time, yes
---
Fuck no. 
---
Movie scared me so bad and I’m 25 and still scared. 
---
This would.... make me never play again haha.  Especially have TVs she can crawl out of NO
---
Did that killers name start with a M?
---
Yeah that was me! GG bro
---
Yeah sure, makes total sense. /s
---
How are Survivors that get camped and tunneled for no good reason worse than the Killer in that instance? The Killer is trash for playing dirty and denying the Survivor a proper game while the only thing the Survivor could have done is loop him endlessly, which let's be honest only the best can do and it's kinda not supposed to be that way anyways.
---
Fuck why'd you have to remind me, this shit makes me irrationally mad at the pinheads at Konami.
---
I think thats gona be the first DLC that im gona buy, how much its gona cost to you think?
---
Weird. Yeah I don't know, I get 60fps gameplay and the skillchecks are always choppy for me.
---
Only blind when his mouth is open I guess
---
Don't feel bad because Navy chose Dick over saving her friend this is just karma. Barb was dragged and killed in a crazy nightmare world, and so will Navy...just...forever.
---
It's because the game isn't actually fullscreen and your mouse is clicking off screen.  There is a fix for it that involves disabling high DPI scaling or something like that in Steam.  Another way is to change your desktop resolution to 100% instead of the 120% it recommends.  This will fix your issue but cause you to lose some FPS and the game will look more zoomed out.
---
god I hope they add a Robin themed skin for another survivor,very slim chance but for Meg maybe? At least she would have something different than S P O R T
---
Around when will we start seeing progress? I've played around 20 hours, but a bit of that has just been playing custom games at LAN Parties
---
My experience has been the opposite, I've had one team of swf who I killed, while the other 2 escaped that both message me "worst killer ever" one of them called me a pussy lol. Besides that all  only good comms. I was in a game getting absolutely played with, like actually getting my wraith diddled by a whole team of 4 swf, two really good with their flashlights, on autowreckers. They got me mad with like 4 outta nowhere flashlight saves so when I got a down at endgame, I hooked him by the exit gate and  facecamped (very close proxy camped really) while bing bonging, noed was active and I caught two more, hooked em, they rescued one and it ended as a 2 k. That was probably the most toxic I've played, it was such a busy match though, with good plays throughout, I felt like sending them all ggs, they were all cool which I wasn't expecting, complimenting my playstyle and all, thought for sure I would get a "face camping scumbag" Of course I'm on PS4 and not in the red ranks, I'm assuming you are high rank on PC. Most toxic players I have come across have been on The Last of Us, some lifers on there who will make you wanna puke. Just a few of them but total trash.
---
No, but I don't think we play any other first person games
---
R.I.P Cashier Carl
---
I will never slap you, as you’ve owned up to your mistake. Good on you. Respect.
---
Buttlust
---
Also with m&amp;a tier one has no terror radius so you can come from around a corner and get a yoink or a feee hit. It’s harder to see him coming on indoor maps.
---
Thank you. I'll find the way to switch it and try that out.
---
Lets be honest, this aint casual game and will never be.
---
This theme is “Until Dawn OST The Shadow Of The Mountain.” I think that unique map themes could reflect the tragedy and horrors that took place there. They would start out loud during the load in phase, and fade out into background music.
---
Spine chill doesn't work on EW1 Myers
---
Thanks for the response, but no. What I'm looking for is, say I add an add-on and it reduces charges but then add another add-on which adds charges. How do they trigger in terms of charges.
---
No shame bro, You gotta save up money for the new Chapter and that sweet Steve-pus
---
AMAZING
---
Why would you not have to level him up to get his teachables?
---
Because she was still in fatique where she is immume for stuns. Fatique goes on a bit longer than the animation.
---
Sad day!
---
I hope they release dedicated servers very soon. I miss the game so much but matchmaking time killed the fun.
---
because he hasn't been on the ps4 version until like not too long ago, and his perks were general perks i explained it
---
Ure a legend dude
---
It's more like he's being held hostage.
---
Dude its a joke xd
---
I can't wait for the demogorgon to be low tier...  
---
It's sad the devs are scared to make high skill cap killers that can be powerful if played well.  
---
I can't wait for the new survivor perks to give even more crutches that can be abused...
---
I mean The Entity is basically a god, capable of pulling people into it's world from ours. You could consider it an afterlife, since no one has escaped and some people actually get there by dying according to their lore (Plague, Pig, Spirit, Hag).
---
It was just a joke
---
At least Jonathan's girlfriend is still alive.
---
wow. That story was SO well thought out, probably the best concept for dbd I've read! I'd really love for that to be featured in the game, you did a really good job on this :)
---
It was a joke
---
Swinging around the food poisoned ciabatta sandwich.
---
Also instead of a heartbeat the lights start flickering rapidly depending on how close the demogorgon in
---
Oh lol. The way you worded sounded like it lol. My apologies
---
When you have baby killers in the community who whine about not getting quad kills every match, the devs keep nerfing survivors not once realizing how negatively it affects every survivors in lower ranks.
---
The game is already unbalanced for new survivors. They start off with just one perk, no items, no addons. They have no idea about obscure killer perks and mechanics, and how to counter them. Every killer is different and has a different playstyle, so obviously survivors need lots of time to learn everything, but the game doesn't allow it at all.
---
Many newbie survivors get hooked twice in less than 3 minutes doing nothing. Some attempt escape on hook and die without struggling. Others are left to hang, or get moried. They leave the game, see they have won like 2k bloodpoints while the killer easily gets at least 10k bloodpoints.
---
What's the use of playing this game they think. And with just 0.6 hours of gameplay time, they write their genuine experience of the game, only to get shut down by toxic killer mains, who undoubtedly have to face off against much more experienced red rank survivors, but fail to see the game from the perspective of the newcomer who is completely helpless and is bullied for being trash at the game.
---
And here I thought it'd be more pertinant to have a Stranger Things DLC be Chapter Eleven
---
&gt;new content is rarely a bad thing
---
But sometimes it's legion.
---
I’m aware, but it should still be obvious.
---
One problem, “Steve Harrington” needs to be his fullname, “Steve ‘The Hair’ Harrington”
---
Nope, you're more likely to sacrifice the survivor than to see the head trap kill the survivor. Usually survivors go straight for the boxes when they unhook, as there's no real penalty besides giving the killer time to find you and other people, and most of the time you'll find the key in the first box anyways.
---
Wheelchair
---
And why not Walter White ?
---
It's literally the video in the post...
---
Michael doesn't know fear, Huntress would see a challenge, Doc would be fascinated, Hag it'd probably be like 2 dogs sniffing each other
---
Enjoy them as much as you like. You can do that without smug (and inaccurate) bashing of things others like.
---
I don't like Stranger Things, but that doesn't mean is not well-welcome into the game. So let's enjoy it
---
It happened with Bill, so there's that. Still pretty unlikely though.
---
Not gonna lie... 15 hell ya’s out of 10
---
F13 is being sued? Why?
---
Things from the Upsidedown are weak to light though, so they would experience Lightburn like the Wraith or Nurse do.
---
Nope, all of them except Tier 1 Michael trigger Spine Chill.
---
No
---
I would love this so much, I've never bothered with any prestige but I'd kill for Steve with his face not just covered in blood but legit black eye, cut up face, busted lip
---
Predator is already getting its own game by the F13 people. And Xenomorph has a long ass tail that would cause clipping problems. Also the Demogorgon is very much humanoid.
---
Well, the name holders of Friday the 13th are being sued. F13 the game is caught in the crossfire.
---
Tv’s at every generator lol
---
Unfunny r/emojipolice comment
---
i unlocked legion and pig recently, only to find that legion basically means i'm okay with only getting one person hooked and not touching anyone else for the rest of the game and i've only played pig once but i hear everyone say she's bad, the saw-trap seems neat and she can hide her heartbeat ? did i spend 10$ on the worst two options ?
---
It's dumb, people acting like thinking it wouldn't be the dema are so stupid for being wrong, when really we had every reason to think it wouldn't be. The demagorgon breaks 2 major precedents, 3 of it's quadrupedal at all. There was very good reason to think it wouldn't be it
---
Ok so standing still and looking at 1 single survivor for 2 minutes doing literally nothing else while the others do gens and get out is fun for you?
---
Maybe a DBD anthology series on Netflix?
---
Good thing it'll be trying to kill survivors and not nurse
---
Seriously tho, the emoji makes it 20 times worse.
---
It's more so humanoid not really alien. I believe they said If it walks on 2 legs it's fine or something like that
---
4 time actually
---
I learned recently that Kate was originally supposed to release with Leatherface apparently, but they ended up putting her off until the clown chapter. That means they don’t have any issues with mixed licensed characters with original ones in one chapter.
---
Nice grab
---
MoM needed a Nerf. A lot of perks do
---
Another indoor map :(
---
Right? Talking like his lazy ass 'meme' took effort to do
---
Susie is at least S+ tier.
---
We have seen nothing but a single trailer, calm down til the spotlight video at least
---
How does a backstory help or hinder this game in the slightest?
---
And can't forget the nerf on release
---
80% of the player base dont play this for the lore lmao
---
That person might've been on point (I think?) if he guessed there would be 2 survivors
---
Well alot of people love the lore of the human killers and the way they do it so just to see a animalistic creature with little to no emotions might hinder the game for them especially since it kinda does open a can of worms with the story
---
I agree.. i hate the New DLC. Freddy was on thing beeing an dream demon but now a fcking alien? / humanoid?  Feel like the dlc was just for the fanboys to finally shut up and stop spamming the devs about this stupid idea adding this mutated fucknut. Hope hes worse than freddy on Day 1.
---
I think the blood will splatter anyways
---
Eh, DBD has no story mode so it isn't that serious.
---
True competitors
---
You remind me one of those obnoxius family friendly youtubers who put on an voice
---
I mean. It does put a different light on Steve’s handshake with Dustin... I’m not looking forward to see the hair being sucked off by the clown
---
I mean I'm still saving shards to buy out the shrine when they come out for that BP boost lol
---
And the largest drop in average player age to date.
---
Gotta hand it to the devs, smart to rope in the twelvies right before a battle pass drop, they've shown they'll fall for that with Fortnite.
---
If anything, the new killers are the ones that will be suffering. It’s harsh out there for baby killers.
---
rape mori\*
---
And they'll all quit within 2 days because servers are coming with the next patch which will be insufferably laggy Pog
---
Community:we need to reel in the toxicity
---
Every streamer and youtuber outside of like 3 of em: LOL WHATS WITH ALL THESE TRASH KILLERS LOLOLOLOL GIT GUD LOL LOL 360 INFINITE BUILDING LOOP NOT OP GG EZ AHAHHA SUBSCRIBE AND COMMENT LOLOL
---
Yeah, a meg DC'ed on me when i downed her with freddy and said I'm the salty one, which makes no sense at all.
---
Not everyone likes Stranger Things and most people don't like indoor-maps which this DLC will have
---
Because "lol your game is actually popular and generates income so sue" probably.
---
You go away
---
steve makes me sbeve
---
***Everyone going on and on about BHVR allowing a non-human killer meanwhile I'm looking at hag like... ***
---
Every one plays differently - they are both good killers that come with good perks. Check out some youtubers for tips on how to play them.  Yes, she does hide her heartbeat - but don't sneak the whole map cause her view isn't great. Traps are great to slow the game down - survivors run around trying to get them off instead of doing gens.  Use legion with perks that benefit from hit stacks. Really easy to get lots of hits.
---
Legion is bad for sacrifices but amazing for farming bloodpoints (easiest killer to max out the brutality, hunting and deviousness categories).
---
I don’t have pig but I used a splinter to play as her once and got a 4k lol.
---
What is this fuckers back story? Hmmmm maybe watch the show??? The back storys for all the licenses are just summeries of what movie/show theyre from..
---
Killer will probably be unplayable for a few months when servers come, also P2P connection allows people who live in a place without a server to still have good connection to each other.
---
Yeah, Blood in the water is the reason I didn't post this ages ago, I couldn't get it exactly right.
---
Isn't ghostface a really powerful skill based killer?
---
So they have chosen... Death.
---
She's not a monster tho she's a skinless woman..
---
It would be very cool considering talking would give locations away to the killer as well.  Works well in F13. Doubt it will come to dbd. Do you really want to hear what the clicky teabaggers have to say?
---
Well guess Claudette is gonna have to take one for the team while I escape
---
Yeah, slow down the part where the killer brings up their foot so it looks like they're winding up the stomp.
---
That ytuber is the epitome of everything wrong with this community
---
Looks like baby dwight is back on the menu boys!
---
They won't appear anymore until you unlock them
---
We need to be nice to the new noobs this time around
---
YOU TAKE THAT BACK
---
No.
---
Me
---
It isnt.
---
Wiggling is a fixed speed, always takes the same amount of time, don't break your controller
---
Hey random person got this notif and then I saw my phone wasnt charging when I checked the notif thank u so much
---
Yeah. If someone runs loops like the Wretched Shop main building they active try to ruin your fun so you're justified in ruining theirs.
---
pig needs perks to be strong, and has some really nasty addons
---
the addons that increase number of jigsaw boxes greatly increase the length of the game by forcing survivors to go through more boxes
---
had alot of trouble with her until i got whispers
---
just dont chase anyone too long if they are good at looping, you can get an easy down later with make your choice or etc
---
devour hope makes her particularly scary if you can protect your totem by always hooking near it and keeping near the area (but having enough distance for make your choice and devour)
---
if you see a jigsaw box notification, you can see the auras of the boxes to guess where they are heading next
---
makes oink noises when pallet stunned btw 10/10
---
How does it ruin the Lore?
---
And it's pretty easy to explain the lore of how Stranger Things intermixed with DbD as the Upside Down is just a mirror realm that lays over/under the normal world/realm.
---
The Entity has the power to reach through time and space to pluck who ever it wants and pulls them into its own realm of games and trials, it's not a long shot at all to say the Entity reach through and touched the Upside Down an picked up the Demagorgon, which is just a part of a hive mind to the Mind Flayer, with Nancy and Steve being so tightly wrapped up in the Demagorgon's storyline at the time of it's demise, they could have been caught up just as easily an plucked up by the Entity.
---
Although, Lore wise, since both Steve and Nancy are seen from again and are in more story after the frame of time they are nabbed by the Entity, it would be save to assume Steve and Nancy are the first ever Survivors to escape the Entity's realm, even if it hasn't happened yet I'm game time, as all the trials run parallel to each other regardless of time lines.
---
It even makes more sense to the Lore to assume that once the Demagorgon was taken into the Entity's realm, the mental connection to the Hive is terminated and the Entity was able to manipulate it's now vacant mind to give it the reasons to hunt for it, like it does to all the Killers.
---
I'm just saying, if you close the door an scream it won't work, then your mind will never let you see it, but If you find the right peices the lore slides right together, plus we don't know everything about the Lore on Stranger Things, the creators haven't really shed too much light on how things came to be, how they are, an more or less just created a set of events that explains why it happened at all.
---
Wow, a dlc with two survivors and a alien, it's beautiful.
---
so im i the only one thats is meh to this chapter? i mean it looks cool but i would rather have a new dead by daylight killer another pay killer is cool but why not pinhead? his perks his gameplay his mori i mean come one it would be so badass or jason ( i know them getting jason is gonna be hard ) but it looks cool gameplay could be cool but still pinhead or a dead by light killer.
---
Toxic = Claud
---
Medic = Nancy

SCP- 096 AS KILLER!
---
My name is Sidney and I was very confused by the title for a moment.
---
People who say it is a cashgrab yeh maybe but these companies need to make money to. And alot of people here probs played fortnite well what is fortnite then?
---
I'm not too well-versed on stranger things and don't personally like the show but even I know that the demogorgon is from Dungeons &amp; Dragons originally. It's not just some alien monster that was never at one point sentient.
---
You were ready and willing to admit you were wrong, and here you are. No slap for you but instead updoot.
---
Sadly the DbD community can be toxic as shit. It doesn't help that some people actively encourage toxicity either. We had one such streamer/content creator a while back, who essentially got banned because even the devs were like "Alright, that's it." because of something. Since then the game's been getting more friendly again. You can't do much though, except to confront a shitty attitude with unwavering optimism and friendliness. I found that in any given game there's just one angry asshole and the rest is passive aggressive or just uninterested. If you stay chill against the angry asshole I've had enough encounters where somebody else would speak out on your behalf like "stop harrassing people".
---
The issue with DbD is inherent. It's a small scale version of the famous Stanford Experiment where they gave one half of a group utter power. The killer is the utterly powerful entity in this game. He may not 4k you, but he can damn well make sure that you as a single person will not survive by tunnelling and camping. Survivors who get too cocky and snide will then feel utterly superior and shit all over the killer. 
---
Personally I've lost all the competitive edge in this game, because ranks mean nothing. Play for fun. Play as a survivor or as a killer, because there's some real fun tension to be had. I usually play the game in lower ranks like a D&amp;D Dungeonmaster when I'm the killer. I give them a run around. I kill some. I let some escape. If possible I dictate the fight, because this is a horror film and some survivor has to be the hero and it is my job to make them feel like they have a fun time. Be prepared to die as a survivor. Be prepared to not kill everyone as a killer. And above all else, stay positive. You play with others after all. Griefing, t-bagging and other asshole activities can frustrate a player. Don't be petty and frustrate others to elevate yourself and likewise don't let yourself get frustrated by some assclown who just wants to get a rise out of you. 
---
The real issues are, imho, that the game greatly incentivises you to kill everyone or to escape. You get the most bloodpoints for it and the game is a grind hell. They desperately need to rework the entire progression system, if they want to get a larger playerbase, because fuck I wouldn't ever want to get started in this game nowadays. You've got practically thousands of hours of grinding if you even want to unlock all the perks for every character. Maybe with a rework to BP acquisition they can also make dying or not killing everyone more enjoyable, taking the pressure out of a 4k/survive and thus lowering the anger and frustration you feel.
---
Note that they did NOT confirm two sets of perks, just that they're two separate characters.
---
For all we know, they share a set of three perks and whoever gets to 30/35/40 first unlocks them for everybody.
---
The gorgon is not a monster its a person with a plant for a head.
---
Its got a human shaped body, 2 legs, 2 arms, a torso and a head.
---
The Spirit and Hag are no less "monsters" than the gorgon. They may LOOK human, but they aren't.
---
Also I didn't know humans have razor sharp pointed teeth (hag)
---
Konami is ridiculous with their copyright but Pyramid Head would be great. I would also really love the Axeman executioner from Resident Evil 5 the. Since we already have two chainsaw killers it wouldn't make sense to add the chainsaw.
---
Monster Killers might not have as much personality but they sure open up a whole list of possibilities.
---
Yea but you have to consider low ranks are horrible especially because you either get demolished or just bad teammates including De-rankers on both sides.
---
Several

Any one have any idea where can i watch the first Halloween movie ever? I think it’s 1978 or something
---
Staby thirst
---
woohoo !
---
Instead of a instant swing he can only charge up attacks before swinging. No lunges, but he takes no pallet stun.
---
I mean it’s not just a cash grab it’s a way to bring a fairly large community into ours there’s a reason the trailer is number one on trending and has like 2m views at this point that’s a lot of people that have never heard of DBD until now that might decide to play and stick around. More people playing = better matchmaking and shorter queue times so I see it as an absolute win for everyone
---
I hope we get Pyramid Head or the Creeper from Jeepers Creepers. Although a flying killer would be game-breaking and probably put the nurse to shame.
---
Still hoping for Pyramid Head

Poor baby trapper I feel for him

Plague is from before Zoroastrian

Imagine gettimg cucked by jonathan byers

Please do Ash
---
What if I don't?
---
I mean it’d be just like Ash no?
---
This new chapter will open doors to a variety of Killers and Survivors. I'd like to see a Headless Horseman, a Scarecrow with a scythe, and Jeepers Creepers Survivors and Killer (The Creeper, Trish, and Darry)
---
What’s a legion thing (new to game and sub)
---
"right off the bat" ruin it later tho, after they buy dlc
---
Huntress mains excited so fucking much
---
Definitely agree with you there it’s unfortunate that so many people are gonna bully the shit out of these new players and scare them away from the game for their own sick amusement saddening really

I’m about to take my exact loadout and put it on Steve, it’s time to heal other survivors and save my friends in STYLE baby
---
Well they give a slight better chance of unhooking yourself or freeing yourself from a bear trap.
---
So if someone starts out human they're human forever right?
---
Man, that means we can get zombies and clickers from LastOfUs, all the half-life headcrab zombies, any and all mutants. After all, if they start human, doesn't matter what they turn into, they are still human right?
---
I watched it was like, this is boring fuck this, but the openings slap
---
Luck is useless. Always burn something else and avoid the pouches in bloodweb whenever possible.
---
Or making them all useless like with Quentin
---
I’m going to commission one with bigger bonkhonagahoogs
---
Now imagine this: instead of hooks, the demogorgon takes you to the Upside Down, which is basically a "hook world" ie like in the show you have to find the exit, and once you're there a Survivor has to help you get out. Thing is, the demogorgon would still have to execute you once you're in its world and I guess there should just be a different requirement to be able to execute a Survivor? Like have them spend a certain amount of time in the Upside Down before being "ripe for the reaping".
---
I think the chance of unhooking can go up to 6% or so with all luck offerings
---
Because Steve is best mom.
---
Creatures from the upside down are sensitive to light cause there isn’t much there. So it won’t blind it but light burns it which works to
---
Returning to this game purely to play Steve. WHO DO YOU WORK FOR!??? ... Scoops Ahoy
---
Yeah we are
---
Wake up and Pharmacy aren’t great but not that bad. They have their place in some builds.
---
This is a “character” from a show with three seasons out already. If you don’t know backstory, it’s because you haven’t looked for it.
---
I watched it. How can you honestly sit through that and not see that?
---
They don’t have the rights to Sidney, plus it’s a different ghostface so Sidney isn’t related in any way to him
---
3&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2
---
Cause it has horror elements that aren’t exactly suitable for children among other things. I’m not say they don’t watch it but the majority of the shows fandom definitely isn’t children
---
I'm no doctor, but I don't think that's how urethras work
---
Flair checks out
---
But the left 4 dead cosmetics don’t either?
---
why does the guy in the yellow shirt look like a girl
---
Ugh. That’s annoying. I’d probably prefer if we just didn’t get Bill lol
---
After two years ive been having a hard time getting back into playing recently so im looking forward to this
---
They could get away with it tbh. All they need to do is ask.
---
Survivors: *are toxic*
---
Survivors: *get a bad name*
---
Survivors: (• o •)
---
... have you ever seen this community? toxicity will never be set aside. otherwise, people would have to grow up and stop harassing people online in their moms basement
---
The Game has an insane amount of pallets though
---
The Runner
---
That would be awesome. 10 second sound byte for each map or realm would be amazing
---
I've seen ST on some Kodi (free app) builds. Or some free streaming sites
---
Man wait until you see Overwatch. Its worse, I promise.
---
Well I mean it's only fair we have to level bill up for his perks (if didn't already p3 a survivor with it or just have it) because PC had to do it also.
---
If you see that the killer is slugging or hesitating to hook the survivor you might as well leave its probably BW
---
But I just P3’d Ash.
---
I can't wait to see all my favourite charactes get killed and eaten this is going to be so much fun
---
They just can’t do expressions, look at meg
---
Awe I really wanted her to have one of her cute dresses from season 3. Hopefully the add it later.

If only players actually gave a shit about anyone but themselves

Could be a possibility, just need to make it less loud and then you're good!
---
Jesus christ, youvr watched "why you wouldn't survive dbd killers" and you watch Dead Meat? Get off my youtube channel
---
Her eyes aren’t as big as the actress but she looks pretty close, even more so than ash I think (ash looks fine too tbh, I think every licensed survivor, except Quentin and Laurie’s hair, look good.)
---
This probably have been asked sorry. Have they announced if the switch version of dbd can crossplay with the ps4 version?
---
Stealth change?
---
But why. That's my only question.  W h y
---
I'm assuming 3.4 godz is 3400 hours or something, but I also have all the achievements with like a third that play time. They aren't very hard if you actually aim for them. The worst part is needing to own every character.
---
memers. hands down, if i see that dwight slowly crouching towards me while looking up and making that little spin like a dog chasing its tail, im gonna make damn sure everyone else in the trial dies a quick death so i can get my pet dwight his vip hatch.
---
So bascially what you're saying is, you want to trap them in a salty hellhole
---
Came here from r/all, didnt know they ve announced it. I ll reinstall the game right now !
---
He doesn’t have no terror radius; he has an 8 meter terror radius, which is still very small.
---
You aren't too far off. He'll definitely be old Freddy atleast that's what everyone else is saying.
---
This meme format has so much great potential. Thank you OP
---
New Nostromo map where instead of turning on generators, you have to stop Ripley from getting the power loader up and running by slowly destroying the Nostromo's power cells that are charging it. When you power off the generators, you space yourself out the airlock of the Map/Ship, because no one wants to go toe to toe with Ripley.
---
Alien Physics is a cool concept but needs a bit of a nerf. Other than that, these are cool.
---
Majority of people being toxic assholes are not people in this reddit.
---
Maybe one day
---
An inter-dimensional predatory humanoid creature isn't exactly an Alien. It also fits in really well with the entity IMO. As long as it is scary and isn't just a chav running round with a knife, then I'm happy.
---
Love OW, HMU with your battle tag bro
---
That guy should receive the DLC for free
---
I am excited extremely so my point is that I don’t understand why other people can’t or won’t be happy with it
---
And you still gained more bp than 3/4 survivors. Bhvr wtf
---
Super excited for the launch, can't wait to stab all the new Steve mains
---
If im not being toxic am i really playing DBD tho??
---
With me it's just that Steve doesn't have a fancy mustache.
---
Think it will be awesome even like a camera room where the killer can see you
---
Nah Dweet for life
---
Theres no crossplay across any platforms and theres no plan for it at the moment
---
Yeah take that, random dev trying to interact positively with the fan base
---
I thought that's because we're all BDSM fans :p
---
You kinda just explained why this would have to be hook skins. The system works as it is. All the perks need to work. All the killers need to be fair and balanced. You can fit any new system you like in, but you would have to be rescue-able, escape-able, and it would have to have the same timers as hooks.
---
It doesn't matter if it cancels out maybe one or two perks - lots of abilities and perks do this already. It also doesn't mean you couldn't add new features in that work around this base system. E.g. Off the top of my head (and I have no idea why or how this would work) they could potential add into it a system or power where people change the hook they are on / get teleported to another. just as an example... This wouldn't interfere with any perks.
---
No i dont but it was the q n a regarding reworked freddy so around that time
---
Hol up
---
I was talking to my friend about this last night with the hype around the fact this is our first official non human monster  
---
I am a huuuuge alien fan as is my buddy.. but I honestly think dbd would be a really bad place for them as I could only see two play styles.  
---
I am a huge horror fan and when I first played dbd I literally played it as a horror type game, and in short time realized its purely a competitive pvp type game. And this is mentioned by a few people out there.  
---
So having a alien isolation type alien couldn't happen cause you'd basically be insta downed, I reasoned with my friend that you could work with a terror mechanic.. basically you "fear" people enough (get the hearts racing enough) that when it goes full they can be one shot.... you have like a super slow movement speed, and when this gets full you basically just motor towards said survivor..  crawling over/through anything  
---
The only thing is you'd just remove the sheer intensity and intelligence they have.. and besides indoor maps you'd lose a lot of "crawl-ability" like cling to a roof and pounce kinda stuff (think avp 2)  
---
The second would be an alien warrior type vibe, I have seen this being mentioned.. but once again a passive would be the ability to climb over practically anything.. so there goes every t-wall, jungle gym, and pallet.  
---
I just think that dbd is the wrong environment for alien, and I am sure someone could big brain some ideas that could make it work, but I feel like it would ruin the alien lore
---
Yeah, same.
---
Anal beads spirit would like to have a word with you
---
Maybe take a break..?
---
Ahoy ladies
---
Also they said the reason was because object of obsession was such a big counter to these killers to the point where playing felt super bad which is why they will make them immune to detection perks.
---
Torako, Anmari Kowashicha Damedayo  
---
it also has another dbd reference, not sure if there's even more than that though.
---
Nerf Wraith and Doctor. That's a first for me, I expected to see a shitpost flair.
---
Never seen Stranger Things, I don't mind the look of the gorgon, but I just know they're going to fuck up and make it either a shit killer, or OP and then nerf it to shittiness before it goes live.
---
I hope it includes the outside too
---
When I first started watching ST I thought that he looked like quentin alot
---
Jealous
---
I'm SO sorry
---
Don't worry, I'll buy the game and the DLC just because it is Stranger Things themed, so I don't think you'll be missed that much
---
Easy, it can't be blinded.
---
They are two of the weakest Killers but ok.
---
Definitely need a small break ^ wraith and doc are the least of survivors concerns tbh... but just re-energize for tomorrow my dude
---
*happiness alien noises*
---
Ppl who own Jason
---
And that's a fact
---
I guess Bby Steve and Bby Nancy will pay a visit to the Doctor (: LOL
---
All jks aside, yeah, lets be kind to one another, PLS GUYS. At least pretend you are a good player.
---
Laurie still doesn't have cosmetics. 
---
But it seems like BHVR are going in full throttle from the get-go with IPs these days. I'm guessing the licences for allowing for added content are more expensive than those without, and they're willing to spend more money now. And actively going back and amending previous agreements like with Saw to allow for it. 
---
Which sucks for Laurie, because she was my survivor main - but I'm sick of her looking exactly the same, and Steve's here, so....bye bye.
---
You need more practice ;)

No spare the baby Dweets

oh fuck
---
So Steve and Nancy are the only adult enough survivors that can get stuck on a hook and not freak everybody out.
---
A child on a meat hook probably looks really bad.
---
Well, I for one is worried that Demogorgon's power is gonna be super underwhelming or handicapped to max.
---
*Disappointed on New killer*
---
*Never watched ST*
---
WELP, I'M GONNA STOP READING FROM THIS MOMENT
---
Anyone ever get bored and run around as killer and suck until someone teabags you then make sure they die and let the rest go?
---
"Oh no, our fans are excited about possible ways to give us more money! Why don't they just stop talking about it?! We don't WANT your money fans!"
---
BHVR absolutely want us to be excited for purchasable skins. Especially skins that would require us to buy the base DLC itself. 
---
People are essentially here saying "I want to buy everything you have just announced, and hope you create more for me to buy too."
---
Yeah I bet they're really pissed off. /s
---
I don’t know enough about the killer to make any judgement about it. However I am excited at the possibility for new players to join the game.  Also I think the killer being some creepy demon monster is pretty cool. I’ve never watched stranger things but my wife has and she is really looking forward to me playing as killer.
---
Hard to tell for sure without seeing gameplay, or knowing how you choose to define "op builds" on a killer.
---
If you're consistently the first sacrifice then it's either sheer bad luck, or you're doing something that draws the killers attention. Are you flubbing your first gen checks? Are you going straight for the nearest gen instead of trying to figure out who the killer is and where they are? u/GoliathTheDespoiler gave you some good advice.
---
Killers will handle loops differently, so you can't rely on the same strategy for all of them. Clown, for instance, can shut down window loops through his bottles alone, while many Myers players are running Brutal Strength so that they can stalk on pallet drop and get right back into the chase.
---
u/KneedHelpQuicc is accurate with the meta perks. While Decisive is a hard counter to a tunnel, it's almost certainly guaranteed to have the killer tunnel you *harder* for using it.
---
Best I can suggest is that you watch Twitch streamers or YouTube clips where the survivors provide commentary on what they're doing and why. Take a few minutes at the start of the game to see what the situation is, and maybe double up with the first survivor you find. Remember, you don't have to run faster than the bear...
---
But that would take away from those of us who have come to take pleasure out of ensuring they die above all else. I know I won't rank up or get more BP but I enjoy it when I get to.
---
3.4 godz is 3.4 hours in polish
---
Makes it a lot harder for a 5 Minute gen rush easy escape, eh? Makes sense survivors hate it
---
2edgy4me
---
Clearly all the adults that enjoy Stranger Things and all the reviewers that have given it positive reviews are idiots. Thank God someone as smart as yourself is here to let us all know the truth.
---
Well shit
---
Personal flair checks out.
---
I only dislike licensed killers because of how limited the team is when creating their power. It has to be true to the source material while also being a functioning game mechanic. Licensed killers also get no outfits, except for the recent case of Pig.
---
 I like to think that original characters offer more freedom in their designs, which is the only reason why I prefer it.
---
Imagine if he leaves traps which are the baloons in places then when you go near them they pop and alert him and also slow you down.. or maybe you have to wipe yourself down to stop the blood trail you are dropping. think that would be cool.
---
There we go boys, toxicity is no more.
---
Fun fact: matchmaking time for killer on PS4 is the same as matchmaking time for survivor on PC (nearly instant). Vice versa, matchmaking time for a solo survivor on PS4 is roughly the same as matchmaking time for killer on PC, i.e. eternity.
---
That's a nice idea. We so need something like that and a spooky mansion that's mostly indoors but with a couple of places outdoors.
---
I was hyped about Ghostface when I've never watched any of his movies. The same goes for Ash, but the ST one just feels forced. I don't think they would make an alien killer at all unless they were paid a lot of money to make one. An alien character has basically no personality lore wise (both original and licensed) and you can't really expand to alien's lore compared to a human character.
---
They really gotta fix this cos it ruins the game
---
Look up the definition of “teabagging”. I am sure it is not something friendly either.
---
Maybe use something of a “squat” instead, for the survivors.
---
Also, crouching movement multiple times in a quick succession can be used unless you in some proximity to the killer. Case solved
---
Yeah? Why not? Remember the pig. Take it
---
I just read till hag so farand im like, do u even know what hag does. I know from self experience that survivors are dumb but let me just tell u this secret... u can just use this beautiful thing called crouch
---
Dead by daylight but death by moonlight
---
Weakest doesnt mean least annoying
---
Regardless of how you feel about the TV show, there’s about to be 6 new survivor perks. Fuck yeah!
---
Actually i feel sad for that trapper :C
---
Its actually No:1 Trending in America atm
---
Which is the objective of the game as a killer?
---
Am a Doc main, can confrim Doc is annoying as fuck but relatively easy to play against.
---
Im not sure if the community is the best way for new players to learn, the ammount of entitled players are way bigger than the ammount of players that actually are willing to help and are good people
---
Does anyone know how and what to convert this to to make it so I can upload to forums?
---
Dead Meat reslly really good channel :))

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qwbJrLkH2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qwbJrLkH2k) \- It's a monster.
---
If there's no toxicity is it REALLY a video game?
---
Wake Up was good when it was bugged
---
Totally does. Welcome back! Don’t get scared off by a few assholes!

To be honest its definitely possible to never get hit every game.
---
'Nothing good is on Netflix besides stranger things'
---
Dude, are we watching a different Netflix?
---
It doesn't belong in DBD at all.
---
Wraith isn't particularly strong and the body blocking is kind of a big part of his kit, getting free hits on people in a corner and body blocking windows and pallets so survivors can't use them.
---
So if you removed collision he would become way worse than he is already.
---
Steam Achievement Manager does that. You can just hack all the achievements.
---
Congrats!
---
Real life killers are kind of distasteful.
---
Ds users: im gpnna do what's called a "pro gamer" move
---
Sometimes Im just feeling nice and ket whoever is the last one get hatch... Sometimes
---
You legit don't know how fucking excited i am for this
---
Have to?
---
Nah... get to.
---
OP could have easily specified that with few words added ("beating you fair and square"). I almost always only see Killers be called trash when they played dirty (and boy do they deserve it here) or by toxic trash/plain stupid players that go talking shit no matter what you do (grow the buttercup up!). There's barely a time I saw a Killer being insulted just becaude a Surv died during normal gameplay.
---
I'm not saying there aren't those times, but at least from my experience most complaints are deserved. And that's coming from someone who just recently got accused of tunneling and camping in a game where I got most of my downs thanks to Make Your Choice.
---
Yeah cause a man shooting electricity at you through walls is realistic lmao
---
I couldn't make it through the first episode but I'm still excited for the fans of the show. Also, if the killer is fun I'll buy the DLC anyways lmao.
---
you posted this already...?
---
Nope. Netflix is pretty bad with their originals they don't even manage to keep good shows on it.
---
Probably won't stop growing but new players will leave sooner and sooner, and complain even more and more, and the reputation of Dead by Daylight is gonna end up in the gutter.
---
Well deserved, says I. They've shown that they don't care for the toxicity and have in some cases even promoted it. Mainly Mathieu and his bullshit.
---
Alexei, Bob, and Benny would've been great choices! Although I would hate to think that Bob would be trapped in the Fog
---
We need them to play killer to make my survivor queues better. If anything, play survivor like a good boy and play killer like a cunt/s
---
Csgo has a system where if you crouch spam too much it takes more time to crouch. (At least I believe that's how it works, haven't played in a while)
---
Inb4 hackers find a way to get the gun every game
---
By this logic, Nancy was a shithead far more recently in Season 2 when she called Steve and their relationship "bullshit"
---
Both are fantastic characters, but Steve has an amazing redemption arc, and is currently one of the nicest characters in the show.
---
Okay but the very first words in this post are that they need to be nerfed
---
I like your logic, that his actually so true that his power could lore survivors into an action.
---
Was kinda looking forward to a original concept killer if I'm honest. 
---
But because I don't really know stranger things, it's not too bad as I don't know what to expect and at least it might get me to watch something new. 
---
Will be interesting to see what it brings to the game if nothing else.
---
Finally someone not cosplaying legion or pig, you look awesome!
---
Strongly recommend watching stranger things. One of the best series to date.
---
Well we are gonna get probably the best menu music I can tell you that much.
---
putting aside all the toxicity, let's congrats the devs for making such a memorable game, good or bad, its survived as a "horror" title for 4 years now and still yet another year to go with lots planned out
---
Statistically, it's not even worth considering the possibility of that ever happening.
---
It's not wrong, im curios how can people film from their phones and play at the same time,never taught it would be a replay
---
At most maybe Jack Torrance as a survivor
---
I can't even find name for my characters in game and people actually can make perks
---
I know, that’s what I’m talking about. Some swf of her like zombiehuggers meme templates look really good.

Is the dedicated servers out?

If there is someone who knows the map well, uses infinites and is trying to waste my time, I simply just don't go after them and keep gen pressure and try and catch someone else. This just sounds like your looking for excuses to camp someone.
---
That can be turned around to why wouldn't the killer just facecamp a survivor since it guarantees kill?
---
That's because it's a game, meant to be fun, if you wanna be an unfun ass go for it but don't think for a second you're allowed to have opinions when you do.
---
What?
---
They occasionally play billiards together. The Mind Flayer lost a bet with The Entity, and had to give him a Demogorgon as a result.
---
Good, stay pure.
---
You okay fam?
---
That's great, I'll check him out!
---
When Nancy broke up with him Jonathan really took a turn to the worse.
---
Most of the people who play the game aren’t on Reddit.
---
Who needs Jason when we have the trapper.
---
Almost like they dropped DLC with a young audience right before a battle pass released. Hmmm.
---
You mean Nancy? Your usage of Navy is confusing
---
game will have a few weeks of growth though. 
---
For new killers:
---
Stage 1: "Oh boy I can't way to play as a Demogorgan!"
---
Stage 2: "Oh boy killing people as the Demogorgan sure is fun!"
---
Stage 3:"WHY THE FUCK CAN'T I KILL ANYONE ANYMORE? FUCKING LOOPS! FUCKING PALLETS! FUCKING FLASHLIGHTS! DEAD HARD AND ADRENLINE AGAIN? FUCKING SWF!"
---
For new survivors:
---
Stage 1: I can't wait to play as steve!
---
Stage 2: What the fuck killers are so op! Leatherface downs me in one hit!  All of them move so fast! Only nurse is easy to beat!
---
Stage 3: either uninstalled by now or git gud baby killer ez
---
Maybe it could be the start of a new concept in dbd. Things change and this could give the game another dynamic and maybe in the future every killer would have their own hooks because lets be honest, they all have the safe effect, but it would just be different animations and designs i guess.
---
I havent watch it, but the demogorgon look great
---
Killers used to have their own hooks! Then came Myers, who pretty much depends on you not knowing that he's around so they changed it.
---
I played 4 matches yesterday after not playing alot, I got 3 games with DCs
---
oh my god the same!!!
---
dead meat and wow such gaming is a blessing
---
When you're so steeped in the lore of the entity the community develops a collective terror radius.
---
yo angelo
---
I'm thinking of some brainwash thing, maybe similar to Freddy's dream world.
---
That's it. That's his power. No flashlight saves.
---
Drag you into the.... "Upside-down". I genuinely thought that name was a joke...
---
PTBs are always on Tuesdays, so it's either today or exactly in a week.
---
Exactly. We listened to what the devs said before and believed them because they’re the ones making the game.
---
People like you discourages new killers from trying to play fair
---
Tbh dead meat is where I go whenever I haven't seen a horror movie because they sum up and show everything.
---
Yup. The game was in a horrible state before Michael. Three blinks 115% speed Nurse nearly killed the game. And before that, the lobby times were fucked up and it was nearly impossible to play.
---
That's honestly a cool cosplay
---
I love that skin
---
Boring ? Lmfao. What about Money Heist and Sex Education ?
---
Opens the door for the Zenomorph now... HOLY FUCK SIGOURNEY RIPLEY COULD BE A SURVIVOR! 
---
If only Joyce was being made a survivor, Winona was in Aliens 4 too.
---
First killer reanimated?
---
I’ll reply to the post when it actually merits a thoughtful response.
---
If everyone in the sub took a stand against people being toxic, and the sub is only half the playerbase, then that'd *still* have enough of an impact so that you'd only see pure unmitigated toxicity once in every 16 games.
---
Probably the reason they are still in low ranks. After you get passed them yellow ranks you should see a dramatic drop in dc's
---
I watch noob3 while I wait
---
Ye for the killer right now i would let the hooks stay apart of the pig probably or the doctor so in some cases you dont know if it is a Myers or not although at this point of the game it doesn’t really matter because as soon as Myers stalks someone into lvl 2 everybody knows so.
---
they already created in-game ticket systems for post-game chat toxicity. another solution is to remove the end game chat but that would give more disadvantages for socializing, however, I don't that really going happen. let's just hope the new update doesn't brake the game more.
---
Give up. I'm a former doc main and a 3-gen doctor is nearly unbeatable if gen placements are close.
---
Imo the ranks in dbd are useless, but I also think they are good, you get all the good of rankeds being playing against better player every time, but you also don't have the pressure to rank up, like in other games you get points for ranking and if you lose you will spend more time to get it, in dbd you only play for fun, since there isn't any actual objective
---
No worries with enough skill every killer is viable and you are sure to get a kill or 2 with decent skills, but you could also play nurse for a while and get 4ks even without add-ons. But the game doesn’t even have a reward for ranking up so having fun matters the most.
---
Because eventually, and I mean a very very long eventually, everyone would get to rank one, anyone can get rank 1 if they play long enough.
---
My best guess is that it exists to give people that care about rank a reason to keep playing because other than that I can't see any good reason.
---
"Why is he just staring at me?" -new survivors
---
Yea it is. Yesterday, I body blocked a Tapp as huntress for the whole EGC when he was the last one left. I got an angry message after
---
Heh very apt , was playin SWF last night and one of our group was havin a right good laugh at the memes on here.

I’m a killer main so yea

Well isn't Ash vs Evil Dead over with now? I haven't followed the show in ages so I was under the assumption it was over, and I totally forgot all about Their being a new Halloween movie, but irregardless, they may still be the first in this specific pairing as they don't age between seasons and, I may be wrong, but 40 sum years go by between Halloween's.
---
Also, the Lore doesn't state what would happen to someone if they did manage to escape, so I assume they would have no recollection of their time there, there's alot up in the air here, but still it's always better to look at how things *will* work and not how they won't.
---
i hope the map wont be another lery's...
---
Imagine if it could separate survivors, 2 could be in the upside down, 2 in the normal world, and they are unable to see each other or interact.
---
I thought that was how baby is made
---
if pyramid head is a monster then so is nurse, hag, and spirit. heck I almost feel nurse is somewhat silent hill inspired. 
---
But tbh I consider those 3 monsters anyway. Cuz clearly they aren't human anymore.
---
I don't know about those. Haven't heard of them at all but money heist sounds good
---
Thanks :3
---
Demogorgan:
---
**I'm about to end this man's whole career**
---
Are these real like the actual models in DBD or fan created?
---
usually it’s to either get them out of the game quicker or for bloodpoints
---
Ty :3
---
That's horrible! You should watch the movie instead and experience horror in it's full form, not through a short commentary...
---
Anyone playing as David and Jake.
---
I assumed he would have a running action (prowl ability) considering if it was on all fours all the time they would need to make a whole new set of animations for his pickups, breaks etc.
---
I think it will be some sort of pig ability but it can leap over stuff maybe? Walks around like a humanoid but then moves quicker in his ability. Just my guess at it
---
DIDNT WANNA LEAVE HIM A CHANCE HUH!?
---
This time we'll have DAD.
---
I don’t like that everything is going back to this false 1980’s in horror.  It’s always an idealized version of 1980’s saturated with nostalgic imagery. Then, instead of creating actual tension and suspense, they play suspenseful music to force suspense when it is not actually earned through quiet dread. 
---
I just hope that it serves to bring new people in to both DBD and actual classic horror like Halloween and John Carpenter’s The Thing.
---
True, but I'm too broke to buy them :D
---
Dbd is pretty up there on Twitch usually. I know it surpasses Mario Maker 2 and some other big games throughout the day. 
---
That being said, I don’t really like any other the Twitch Streamers. They don’t do it for me idk why. They aren’t super charismatic and every time I check it just looks like they are playing spirit and killing lobbies in like 2 minutes.
---
I realise this doesn't directly answer your question, but quite honestly I wouldn't waste the add-ons until the dedicated servers arrive.
---
Right now, the odds are that *someone* will DC as soon as they realise what you're doing. They can do this without penalty, since DCs are currently only punished on PC when you hit a certain limit over time.
---
You're already going to struggle with this one - don't make it harder on yourself.
---
Okay calm down toxic killer
---
Indeed but when has the shrine ever given any good perks? It must’ve been ages ago
---
k
---
I love Stranger Things and I love Dead By Daylight.
---
I want to buy the Stranger Things Chapter NOW!
---
My god its true
---
Wa wa wa
---
ruin so I don't have to level hag
---
it won't, but it's still a great idea!
---
Calling the toxic killer toxic? That's toxic. Reported.
---
Hope he gets bored at some point or disconnect.
---
2 different characters means 6 different perks for survivors? I am excited!
---
Is every Killer viable?
---
When the moon comes, the evil shines through
---
That would make ruin useless on Hannibal which would give space for him to try other perks. Love the idea !
---
Rank 1 killer player can't find game for 30min.
---
Claudette main here waiting for the past half hour/hour for a lobby. Fun times for all.
---
There is already a chainsaw killer, nonetheless we got leatherface.
---
1 surv in game. Uhuh totally not scripted
---
What are u gonna Put all the names and see which ones get the most upvotes
---
Calm Spirit of course
---
That's a weird way to spell God
---
r/thefairfield
---
When you kill one you have less people doing stuff
---
It was named by the kids in the show so a childish name is expected
---
I only play the true game dead before sunrise so no
---
The aliens in ST can teleport through walls and drag you down into a "different world" basically, but idk if that will be used in DBD
---
Personally i just go for the one i spot first at every given time.
---
Ditto. And even if you die you should pip and get a lot of bps
---
As someone who has never seen stranger things I'm feeling so left out on the hype ._.
---
That's interesting. Never seen the show, only heard the name. Thanks for telling me
---
Some fair points. I feel as if then they should maybe not do it as often. Maybe every 2 months instead of every month?
---
Leprechaun?
---
Ahhhh gotta love ridiculous legal disputes that take hostage one of the worlds most beloved franchises
---
I'm really pumped now, as I now wanna play Hannibal. What did you do to me.
---
But these people disconnected to deny my BBQ stacks and called me a tunneler after I downed someone a second time. I wasn't even playing sweaty and was a chill Wraith and the last guy DC'd after I yanked him off the gate switch. If they think that's bad wait until they see me actually trying to play as obnoxiously as possible as a Doc.
---
Ah. Am man of culture.
---
Only solution to this is to run off and find that hatch which really sucks, I have no clue how they haven't fixed this yet... it's been an issue for so long.
---
I know! They really just threw away the ONE kill they had lol
---
The one(s) that have been sandbagged/bullied/revealed by the killer or had their entire team dc
---

imo, fighting toxic with toxic is just gonna make everyone play toxic. Just send a gg and go onto the next one.
---
Truckin’ and fuckin’ bois
---
I honestly hope for something along this. I love Freddy and his power but hate the overload it causes my bad graphics card. Would've love a similar concept without the dream world cons.
---
That would be actually awesome 
---
I wonder how that will turn out
---
Yea it has, I was lucky to get it then, same with DS
---
I feel you man, I have basically the same history if you replace DotA with league, and Genesis has made all the forgotten rage boil up to the surface again. Not declaring misses, some barely balanced heroes, almost infinite CC, this shit feels like Old School League all over again :')
---
Since when is my dad on Reddit
---
Not really. You need them alive to feed stalk from but you should be “harassing” them often to not only stalk and break chase but to also keep their attention. Once you go active, kill them first tbh. They should be the one you’ve stalked the most out of by the time you go off so they should be the first to go.

Man I want the pebble
---
I know rite?
---
Doesn't matter how wholesome I act, I get treated like shit regardless. So I stopped caring.
---
Yeah, now they are at least humanoid
---
Yall who haven't watched it should go watch it. Its like a sci fi version of It. I know the first season has a physical box set.
---
It's arguably the strongest game-slowing perk that isn't tied to any one killer. Or *would* slow the game, if people did totems over gens.
---
The devs have stated numerous times that they wish to improve communication between survivors, so that there's less disparity between SWFs and randoms. **The capacity to communicate the status of totems would instantly and significantly impact the ability of NOED to "save"/"crutch" a killer's game.**
---
This alone would remove NOED's viability as a surprise instadown endgame perk, and instead have it focus on the original issue it was (arguably) created to solve.
---
Yeah but some other people already have that, the hillbilly for example, it just hasn't been done with a survivor yet...
---
I'll just sit here pouting until it gets added
---
Why, because they’re Japanese? Bruh
---
I would think the "upside-down" would just be the realm on dbd
---
That video in up next makes me mad it’s literally impossible to die in the world of dbd when you are hooked the entity feeds on your hope and puts you back
---
Except you can't hear shit with that sound
---
I am a pretty decent player, killer or survivor. But man playing Myers with no ruin has been an eye opening experience in terms of playstyles. It forces me to commit to short stalks and try and get as many hits is as possible.
---
* Anything that works in your favour is skill.

* Anything that works against you is an exploit.

The joys of playing games with other people.

Feelsbad
---
I can relate. Still good news that we're getting a new killer, and a new map.
---
Nancy looks off
---
Kills like this are always so fucking satisfying lol.
---
Why get out at all, why not just assume it's multiverse stuff, Steve and Nancy plucked from one timeline while the show continues in a different one.
---
How so? New player here.
---
Hex: Ruin
---
This has been a thing with nurse, too..... that’s why she’s subject to light burn. There’s already a thing in game to compensate for this lol
---
Lery’s is dependent on the killer and Game is 90% safe pallets. What do you mean?
---
Its pretty useless but it does give you more chances of not triggering a skillcheck so it kinda helps with ruin
---
That isn’t to prevent teabagging though, that’s to stop people abusing head glitches by instantly popping up and down.
---
Sounds good enough.
---
S+ Tier Killer
---
Yes. You are the only person who shares your opinion.
---
It’s very likely that the game couldn’t find another match for you. Depends on the time of day you were playing and how many people were queuing for killer, too.
---
Not me homie. I go full immersion and search up Japanese monster hentai. Going into every match at full mast really gives me the competitive edge.
---
Exactly. After that it resets it and you should be able to walk through.
---
I mean, there is a ping indicator in the lobby (at least on pc, don't know about xbox) so if the survivors see that this game is gonna have 300 ping and still ready up, it's their fault and not yours.
---
Also, survivors tend to blame lag/lagswitching for their death, so pay it no attention. Don't let that discourage you from playing killer.
---
Oh boy.
---
*Laughs in Tier 1 Myers who is immune to all detection perks*
---
This isn’t true. When someone practices any killer enough, that killer can be effective at any rank. Please stop discouraging people.
---
Paulie said they asked and were turned down sadly penny wise isn’t coming
---
First thought i was on warframe forum
---
No Frank is
---
Child's Play chapter, but it's Charles Lee Ray throwing dolls at you. The one problem with Alien specifically is that Sega has the rights for any Alien games so that franchise has an additional hurdle to go through at least that's how it was set up. Now Disney owns FOX and we all know how well they license franchises for games *cough* STAR WARS *cough*
---
This was the thirteen chapter, it was a great opportunity to introduce Jason.
---
I mean Otz is definitely bae, Tru3 I don't know
---
How is that weird?
---
This type of game require dedication and patience. You can either choose to leave the game or stay and suffer for those fun and memorable moments that make it all worth it.
---
Dumbest thing I've read today. Dbd isn't a big game, why the hell would fuckin NETFLIX pay them to get THEIR characters into behaviour's game?
---
I use it mostly to try and help the newer players
---
That's a pretty solid argument against Alien lmao
---
Killing is thirsty work
---
"Psst, they salty cause they just bought the killer and they cant 4k ever match"
---
I’m a rank 8 killer and rank 12 survivor I mainly play killer but always manage to just get a safety pip how do I 1 pip or even 2 pip the majority of my games and what is the better killers and perks to use
---
Poor guy is still caught in the legal crossfire
---
&gt; As a killer it would balance survive with friends.  
---
It honestly wouldn't even effect it in the slightest, if anything it would probably make solo teams worse.
---
Adding a voice chat in game with huge drawbacks... would just keep the same SWF using discord. On xbox it would still be easier to start a party to chat.
---
You're just giving solo players voice coms, with a drawback. Thats all it would do. Likely just making killers life harder lol.
---
Also post rules posted at the top.... 
---
 
---
* No concept / suggestion questions. ('hey wouldn't it be cool if x was in the game?')
---
That's why achievements only matter in Xbox and PS4
---
Hot Take: Jason, while iconic, has no interesting abilities aside from being resistant to pain/damage. Survivors don’t do anything got harm killers so in the game’s rules/confines Jason has no powers aside from being maybe a built in Enduring. 
---
Local man walks at people with a Machete and gore porn’s them to death. Just put on the Trapper mask and equip Enduring/Spirit fury and that’s about how exciting Jason would be.
---
They don't. Luck doesn't affect chests. The devs already confirmed it
---
Ok, Mr. Redditor, next time we will be near silent about new content in the game. Sorry
---
I especially hate it as killer since almost every goddamn pallet is a safe pallet, and as survivor finding the pallets and learning where the strong loops are takes a LOT of practice (for me).
---
my inner English major is suffering right now
---
Honestly now that we're getting an actual monster and not a slasher human killer this time, anything's really on the table from this point forward.
---
Three. Take it or leave it
---
Pharmacy isn't useless
---
Meg Thomas
---
You don’t hide from ghosts, you hide from a killer (though there is a killer called the Spirit and there’s GhostFace.)
---
At three hits you had free protection after your second unhook with no healing.
---
At four you absolutely must be healed between hooks. 
---
At five, healed twice.
---
The healing times required mean you'd be losing gen time for either yourself or another player. Time that is not equal to the amount of time gained in a chase.
---
That's why I believe just tacking on a hit or two would have been plenty of a nerf.
---
why wouldn’t that work? the plague vomit breaks a healthy survivor.
---
I guess no one has half a brain then. I already run kindred.
---
that might be a minority opinion but i never saw marvel movies as crossovers really. more like...visiting the neighbours?
---
throwing is too wonky imo
---
Was that just OoO or was spine chill mentioned specifically?
---
Yeah, but that's micheal myers too! They gave him an insta kill and down, they could do something like that to him except different.
---
Good meme but unfortunately a repost
---
I feel like its to simulate classic movie posters, drawn characters being shocked or screaming
---
Meh, fuck joey. Susie is above all.
---
Link to leaks?  I didn’t see any
---
True Like I underestimate his throwing power almost every game *lightly taps the mouse button * bottle goes into space in Mach 5 speed
---
Battle pass sounds really good - IT will probably be much cheaper then the ammounts of cosmetics we earn through it and will keep me invested in the game much more
---
I meant how would it be useful sorry. Just a bad make your choice
---
You don’t have to change your killer, you but need to manage your efficiency a bit better. Depending on the killer you use the most, there are many different perks and play styles you can adapt to. Who is your main killer?
---
There’s something similar to this in the DBD game on mobile known as identity. It works very well.
---
Oh nvm then
---
SOMEBODY UNDERSTANDS
---
So true.
---
Shit. Well if survivors get balanced then I guess it's not a waste after all.
---
I think the free chase time after a second unhook was a little unbalanced. Throwing it to 4 hits would require healing time that would be something like an investment for the future chase.
---
Basically he runs Overcharge, Unnerving, Distressing, and a 4th perk (I use BBQ for more points and aura reading but you could use something extra cruel like Dying Light or Coulrophobia/Sloppy Butcher) with something like double calm addons for a massive terror radius.
---
7 gens spawn on every map. Survivors have to do 5. So essentially once there's 1 gen left to finish, there'll be 3 generators on the map. 
---
A 3-gen doc uses his build and defends the 3 generators that are the closest together. It'll be nearly impossible to finish the last one from all the hard skillchecks and a doctor playing very defensively. 
---
End result is the match gets dragged on for an obscenely long time and survivors either DC or give up.
---
But it’s not? It doesn’t require the unhook to be out of the terror radius. I feel like you didn’t really look at what it does and just want to put down someone having fun making a concept for a character they like.
---
I'm always excited for new content until I remember the grind.
---
Going to end up leveling both survivors then unlocking their teachables on Nea and be done without probably
---
This is my icon for dis now
---
Relax, dedicated servers are coming soon and survivors see their ping before the match, if they have someone to blame its them
---
Yeahhh, but thats Micheal Myers too! They gave him a universal insta kill and down, they could do something like that to him, but different.
---
(Dead by daylight theme plays)
---
And whos "us"?
---
I personally think the problem are some 3-5% of the players that wont change their behaviour because they dont do it because they are furious, but because they enjoy pushing their ego whenever they have a chance, or feel attacked and have a need to defend themselfes by spitting toxicity without real reason.
---
So the best might be to make sure all of us, even though we arent the toxic ones, are some kind of counterweigh to the unevitable toxicity so that all the new players will remember the nice players or maybe even friends, instead of the toxic guys
---
No I remember seeing a tweet from the devs saying they are separate
---
You misspelled dweet
---
Dead Meat is amazing. I've watched 'The Kill Count' videos of all my favourite horror movies.
---
A lot of people run Ruin. It’s fairly popular. Lullaby on the other hand isn’t run as much because it’s a “win more” perk, you need to get 3-5 hooks for it to start really working and that means at worst, someone is on death hook already and at best someone is already dead, and with 3+ gens still up that’s a huge advantage.
---
that's the F:13 Community XD
---
I’m hyped for more killer perks, players, and a new map for scratched mirror Myers/coxcombed clapper wraith/double calm doc/ghostface to give heart attacks to survivors on.
---
*time to float*
---
Dont hate the poor drug addict boi
---
That is the best thing, I have ever seen, ever.
---
You sound absolutely insufferable
---
That is true, haha. Though I guess Hag can be excused. She's a supernatural teleporting cannibal swamp witch.
---
Amanda or Legion? Weirdos with a sharp knife. :D
---
My theory is that it is because it’s a 4v1, but it feels more like 1v1v1v1v1, so everyone takes the game a lot more personally. A lot of people also don’t seem to realize just how much RNG plays into whether one will win or lose and that it’s not as intensively a skill-based game as some other games. For example, you could be an optimal survivor player, good at loops and completing gens, but RNG determines where pallets and windows will be (and what windows will be blocked), as well as where gens will be, so you ultimately will lose chases no matter how good you are just because RNG said no. I also feel like both sides have real issues identifying when they made a mistake or when they did a bad play, so they want to blame the other side or be toxic instead of taking the chance to learn. Both sides also feel entitled to a win, and when they aren’t given the win, they lash out because they can’t fathom why they didn’t get the win. Unlike other games, there’s not much you can do in game to try and help change the outcome, at least nothing as impactful as other games (for example, in overwatch, if a team comp isn’t working, you can pick a different character to fit with the comp). You also have way less impact on what others will do.
---
No one cares if he tbagged or not. I guess he should be cast to the deepest pits of hell for that.
---
Head on
---
See, that’s where logic and sense steps in. After dropping the money and effort they did to get this partnership and TONS of new eyes on the game, why would they suddenly break their stride of never repeating perks between characters? There is zero logical reason to do that. I would be completely blown away.
---
*Kirby as killer*
---
Y E S   P L E A S E
---
Why didn't we get that hardware store as a map btw?
---
Meh I don't really like the idea but if it opens up to have spider-like killers too I'm down for it
---
But Myers also has a stalking aspect to him. It’s him semi-terrorizing Laurie in the movies and the paranoia she gets being around him. 
---
Jason just gore porn’s people because of a mommy complex. 
---
The only thing he could bring to the table would be different Mori’s depending on the location you’re at.
---
The problem with it is if you CAN tunnel the obsession down, maybe even mori them after their first hook, it's an amazing perk. 
---
With one less survivor, you're already working at approximately 33% less generator speed (if we say the survivors are playing optimally, with 3 on separate gens and 1 being looped), since the number of survs doing gens has gone from 3 to 2. With dying light, that drops a further 25%. (2/3)\*0.75= 0.5  
---
These are only approximations, but generator speed, on average, can be around 50% lower. Simply by removing one survivor quickly.
---
So we All gonna forget that nurse have covered eyes
---
To represent Xenos properly they would need to climb on the ceiling/walls and an acid factor. The climbing thing would make him weak on all maps but The Game and Hawkins
---
As long as it’s steve’s. Daddy Harrington :)
---
I think the issue is the devs said that and then set a precedent based on the design of literally every other killer (being human, not straying far off from a human body). Can you really blame people for believing that after the devs said that and then made only human killers for 3 years?
---
I hate you, but I respect you for making me uncomfortable.
---
Nice bait
---
r/HolUp
---
Speak for yourself please. I only played this game for like 8 hours as survivor and I already knew why this game is losing players.

Doesn't have any place in this community since it is filled with toxic smurfs.

Hey don't disrespect Bugs Bunny lost in time. A grade game right there.
---
I would upvote if you woudnt tbag
---
u/AccelTurn's reply is great for finding that initial survivor or for chasing right from the hook, but if you're losing them during fatigue then Bloodhound will train you in knowing what to look for and where survivors often juke to, while Shadowborn widens your field-of-view *including* during the fatigue period.
---
One or both would be good in the short term, at least to help you know where to look in fatigue, but as you get better at Nurse you're going to drop Bloodhound first and then probably Shadowborn a little later.
---
Remember that the Nurse has insane travel potential - all you need is to buy yourself a little time with slowdown perks and then you can hunt the survivors at your leisure.

i should have kirby legion and isabellehuntress in my posts
---
You got that right! I ran into a hole bunch of toxic pos survivors and killers last night! I’m just like wtf and then the new people are gonna be like fuck this game after a week of being camped, tunneled, sandbagged, bullied on both sides, used, and shit on with no good perks because BhVR has a massive grind fest for its players!
---
I'm hoping it bits their heads off
---
Yeah but you could use the same system to stop teabagging
---
Sounds awesome
---
If it's a consistent thing I'd do the decent thing and just stick with survivor until dedicated servers come out in a month. 
---
If your internet only hiccups every once and awhile then it's fine, it happens

YES finally someone remembers pumpkin head was a thing that existed
---
As long as the terror radius is megalomania I’m happy. *dudududu intensifies*
---
So real question, is it frowned upon to use that perk? Or is it one of those, I can use it just don't tunnel the obsession.
---

And then toxic Nancy teabags you at every pallet while Toxic Steve spams his flashlight
---
Ping indicator doesn't mean much. If they are using WiFi or on a congested network, their ping can appear green during the pre-game only to crap out during the match itself
---
Those walls won't save you from my shock
---
It’s true. There’s a lot of entitled people who take this game way too personally, and it really sucks. It’s not a fun game to play for a long time because people have such bad attitudes and it gets so draining. It’s especially worse because playing survivor, you even have teammates sandbagging and being toxic toward you, on top of killers wanting to be toxic too. Too many matches get toxic, too.
---
The killer is definitely responsibile to have a decent connection. WiFi packet drop or congested networks can ruin a game and can easily show as a green ping in the lobby only to crap out during the game
---
1# trending. Nice. More skins please.
---
this would be amazing, but there's almost no way Konami would allow it unless DbD was a pachinko machine
---
Nah, I agree hag is A tier
---
Half the time I play it feels like this happens
---
Yahh u can change the distance by looking up and down but the power of the throw is controlled by holing or taping the button
---
Not on sale for PC yet :(. I got my copy on sale when Ghostface was released, so I was thinking the base game goes on sale every chapter. Hopefully it will soon!
---
I’d argue that tru3 is extremely chill about his games, too; both streamers can play at a consistently high level under a lot of stress, which is what garners their appeal. Tru3 just complains a lot more.
---
That's why I'm back to playing killer on PS4. That and perks, and 7.1 visual surround
---
Depends. If he was running dying light, then it's for the penalty.
---
Spitting helicopter facts
---
They also had another one that said "big things coming" and tagged behavior lol it was pretty obvious
---
That's exactly it. That's why I like Spirit so much. She's Jumpscare Incarnate, even if you KNOW her. She's still gonna pop up and take you by surprise similar to Myers.
---
Maybe I'm just not competitive by nature, but the amount of fun I've had in this game just goofing off in low ranks and giving everyone a run for their money far outweighs any satisfaction I have felt whenever I just slaughtered all four survivors.
---
I only have a few rules. 
---
Rule 1 is that there WILL be at least one death. Even if I have to camp, because I suck today or I'm going against some super coordinated team. Someone WILL die. That is the entire point of the game. 
---
Rule 2 I will not tunnel, especially if I realize that the other guy is new. Even a semi-okay killer can utterly dominate a new player. The most basic mind games will work and you just down them and it's not fun for either party. I will relent, when you have done an admiral job with looping a few times and you managed to stun me. I'll also ignore you, if you try your best at hiding. If I see that you're doing something really dumb though, like working on a gen right in front of me, or sitting in an obvious spot, I will teach you better. I'll scare you away. I'll just look at you, do the "no, no, no" shake and bonk you, or whatever feels appropriate. You'd be surprised how many people pick up on their mistakes.
---
Rule 3, I won't tolerate shitty behaviour like t-bagging, clicking your lamp, sandbagging or other "hilarious memeworthy" actions. The game is cancerous as it is. I don't want to contribute to that. You do that in my game, I will murder you.
---
Rule 4, I go for drama rather than efficiency. If I can manufacture a "clutch escape" for my survivors, then I'll do that. Guy's about to die on the hook, the door is open and I have a very good estimation as to where the other survivor comes from to unhook in time? I'll allow it and walk the other way, maybe even headnodding into survivor direction. Then I'll chase you. If I manage to catch anyone before they run out, yay me. If not, aww shucks. 
---
I just wished BHVR would incentivise that flavorful playstyle more. It makes progression obviously much more tedious. Luckily I'm in no rush and I don't need meta perks.
---
We used to tryhard as a swf (Hours ranging from 2500 up to 5000) on killers that were blocked on MLGA, and only those, but now I guess we will do it every match now since you want to play *that* game.
---
Can I ask what kind of perks you use?
---
Oh I see, you're a man of culture as well... (Dead meat)
---
That is how it works, you can't see the killer instinct notifications untill you hit someone while in feral frenzy.
---
There would be just as many "ultra altruistic group chatting tryhards" in Casual you know. It literally wouldn't change a thing.
---
I'd love the map if they made the sound work based on height as well.
---
Yes but then you continue to see them through walls until you hit them or your power runs out. I mean you just see I've notification if where they are and then it stops so you actually have to think and find them.
---
Accurate, but huntress in with billy and spirit would be my opinion
---
I agree because seein that guy staring at me through a window is terrifying. Even seeing one afk in a cornfield completely still, no terror radius? Goddamn sooky lol especially once he jumped to t3 right as the exit door got opened and we tried farming him.
---
There's a difference between the real thing and something based off the real thing. And Leatherface is a big dramatization of the real guy.
---
yeah lets give survivors another handicap
---
Fellow low rank player here, I'd make your goal to pip instead of escaping. I'm okay at wasting killer time during chases and otherwise do gens (I notice most players are overly altruistic at our ranks), and I manage to pip most games.
---
I figure as we climb, escapes will be more common.
---
Careful despite your actual really good play, remember this is DBD reddit, people will complain about your tbag like it's the equivalent of you murdering someone.
---
So you want to nerf arguably one of the worst killers in the game. Interesting.
---
Just because you don’t understand why two separate sets of statistics are different doesn’t mean the stats they provide are wrong. You’re a perfect example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. You don’t know how statistics work so you see something that looks wrong and proclaim that that means all of Behaviour’s statistics are untrustworthy, when in reality you just fail to understand what you’re looking at. 
---
And no, I’m not American.
---
There was a casual mode, removed because of lack of players
---
I got it for $5 in the last big Steam Sale and I got at least like 50-60 hours of enjoyment out of it ... it's not too bad
---
yeah lets give survivors a handicap
---

I just main a survivor with all the perks and change some timed

---
No I want to nerf arguably one of the best. Watch good players play him and he is incredibly strong.
---
&gt;nerf wraith and doctor
---
LMAO
---
I hate indoor maps. They're usually a pain to navigate and find generators as survivor, and as killer the survivors have all the time to go hide because you have to play a game of maze to make it over to their generator, and they're long gone once you get there
---
No way they could’ve.
---
I agree with that... and from the list thats the onlh thing actually on point
---
You're not alone my guy...I feel the same way
---
And then play a game and tbag
---
Big Brain
---
The average survivor knows right away when you're using them, and there's going to be no penalty if they cleanse them both.
---
Ruin can be ran alone, because Ruin is Ruin and has 100% effect from the start, but if you're using a hook-based Hex (Lullaby, Devour Hope) then it's definitely strengthened by Haunted Grounds, giving at least a chance of being able to capitalise on the cleanse.
---
Thrill of the Hunt is the budget version of Haunted Grounds - works better for fast killers, since you can quickly abandon a chase in order to defend your totem.
---
There is perhaps an argument for taking Lullaby on Doctor with Distressing, Unnerving, two good add-ons, and the endgame goal of a 3-gen, but that is monumentally niche and more reliant on the 3-gen working than any combination of skillcheck horror.
---
Absolutely you could go for a 3-Hex setup, which most won't expect, but the problem there is that Haunted Grounds only activates once, so your add-ons better be top tier because you could very easily find yourself with only a single perk left after a minute of gameplay.
---
Annoying doesn't justify a nerf
---
But Bubba dances with it!
---
I just wish that I dont get 4man saud ppl with full loadout just to say EZ after getting all the help you can get it on a f up map.
---
This game just made me dodge ppl who wait for the last sec to change loadout. Grown one and come in the lobby with that key, dont be that ...
---
Yeah, the problem is all the complaining. Once you get stressed out, it's a lot easier to complain than it is to just accept defeat. That's what separates the two. One doesn't even seem fazed by the idea of losing, while the other takes it much more to heart. Both are human traits, and I'd say it's more what you find enjoyable
---
The one time I entered his stream, he was complaining for 20 minutes straight about becoming a 'meme', and first impressions matter a lot, so that's why I'm not personally a huge fan of him. I don't hate the guy, of course, he's just not my cup of tea
---
Trapper and hag both place traps yet their powers are very different
---
Spirit and wraith both go invisible yet their powers are very different
---
Michael Myers and ghostface both stalk yet their powers are very different
---
Doctor and plague both deliver a hindering effect that is escalated by using the power yet their powers are very very different
---
Huntress and clown both throw stuff yet their powers are very different
---
Ghostface and pig both crouch yet their powers are very different
---
All dead by daylight killers are very different with a few notable similarities
---
Only a few weeks? Why stop then?
---
It happens every few days for a few minutes, we’ll get a slow/no connection. If dedicated servers are going to be that soon then I may just stick with survivor until then. Thank you!
---

not really just the game, the original creator of the base concept of F13 literally wrote the script for the 1st movie and got paid like a small handful of cash for it and that's it. then all of a sudden it explodes into a franchise with dozens more movies, merchandise, the game, and Jason Vorhees becomes a household name in horror, so now he feels cheated out of something since he helped kickstart the franchise. He is in a legal battle over the current owner of the license and are trying to work out some deal. It isn't so much the game that's the issue.
---
Though the devs of the F13 game are hilariously awful, and if you ever followed all the issues/drama that happened since the launch of the game you'll probably be glad that you're seeing it's being forgotten and that it deserves to die.
---
Nancy mains raise your hands o/

Łącznie in polish means total playtime - so no, he just hacked it

where are the leaks when you need emm lol
---
Devs have confirmed that they would prefer randoms to have the same advantages as SWF, and communication is a part of that.
---
I would argue that prox chat is unlikely without some kind of regional block on servers - in the States it could be presumed that most people are speaking English, but in Europe or Asia voice chat would be worthless.
---
Of course, that doesn't even begin to take into account the nightmare task of *policing* the voice chat...
---
I mean he's good and all, but he regularly goes and plays against rank 15-20 killers, and that's just not cool. It's basically smurfing, which is banned in a LOT of games.
---
Ok, this is epic, can we get this lad to negative karma numbers?
---
Unfortunately never gonna happen.  Konami killed and buried the Silent Hill IP.  Kojima tried to get it from them and they gave a hard no. :(
---
Due in part to your friends boosting you up to that rank. It's a term that's been around before dbd.

I need to know!
---
You are probably one of the fuckers who used it then
---
Hype is great and all, but the spam is a bit unruly
---
I want to hear those horrific Thing screams in game, hype af
---
Yea IDK why you're getting downvoted, bloodlust is a horrible mechanic that can ruin the most fun aspect of the game, chases.
---
New killers means a chance for killers able to compete with billy, nurse and spirit, meaning not only more killers to face, but also the ability to switch between more killers without dramatically affecting your chance to win
---
As I said to the other guy, Noob's being toxic mostly revolves around him being basically a top-tier player and regularly Matching up against low rank/level killers.
---
Why is it a mistake?
---
I hope not
---
You can add burnbearburn, I'm guessing you're EU?
---
because certain killer players need it apparently
---
[Look at me picking on people for attention](https://imgur.com/a/KSDTnPw)
---
Thank you, that explains it better than what I found on Google. I was confused as I what I took from it was that if my connection was rubbish then only my killer would be slow but that makes more sense! Fingers crossed the new servers will fix it!
---
He will smell the AA batteries
---
Saying it’ll never happen. You owner up to it so I respect that.
---
Not my fault you're so easy to catch.
---
Nah courtesy of Monto I found his channel, I don't even know who Pug is. Don't wanna know either. 
---
But all the videos I have seen of him, apart from that 18 minute chase I mostly found him agitating the killer with BM and deliberately doing berating actions in the game. In comparison to polite yet entertaining people like Otz and HybridPanda, he is not a likeable role model. 
---
Also, there is some controversy regarding his community, some of who did something bad in BHVR dev stream that forced devs to censor 'noob3' term in the chat.
---
I haven't heard or seen such toxicity and rumors around any other fog whisperer. All these things point to a hot garbage situation.
---
Who said I have over-confidence?
---
This update is really helpful for dbd, thanks to stranger things' popularity. I'm happy for it
---
At least there's a tutorial now. It's not much, but it gives you the gist and free bloodpoints. When I started there was just walls of text describing the mechanics and it was pretty overwhelming.
---
Yeah take that, developers ignoring massive problems with their game in favor of adding more DLC.
---
oh my god look at the post again
---
I wouldn’t really call this game competitive. Sure, you have ranks, but ranks mean nothing (no rewards for reaching a certain rank like in games like Overwatch, literally nothing that shows off grinding to a certain rank other than the achievement you get for doing it the first time). I used to be a “sweaty try hard”when I played this game but getting back into it I’ve been playing super casually - not really worried about getting the most points or pips or stacks or whatever else. It’s a lot more fun playing this game with the “casual” mindset.
---
So anyway, there’s really no need for a casual mode when you can play as casually as you want and the worst thing that happens is you get slapped with that “gg ez” in the end game chat.
---
Thankyou very much kind sir!
---
Good thing im a low rank killer right now. Gonna destroy all the newbies
---
The survivors come with 3 perks each
---
Monto is pretty good too.
---
That's definitely true but I also think it's unfair to expect him to play the game constantly so that he can get to red ranks after rank reset. He's been burnt out for a while and doesn't play the game unless he's streaming or making a video. It'd be different if he was playing it constantly and deliberately deranks to low ranks.
---
I started the queue and opened Reddit. This was the first post.
---
I have not seen a single person claim the demogorgon will come with 6 perks.
---
It is pretty standard that Nancy and Steve will get 3 each and the demogorgon will get 3.
---
Shadow nerfs happen outside of patch notes/ are never mentioned
---
It’s definitely not getting 6 perks. It’s one character not two. If the devs stick to their routine, it will always be 3 perks per character
---
Yeah but have you read the post?
---
You got me there
---
9 perks total is what I’m assuming. 3 for each survivor, and 3 for the killer.
---
In germany its #16
---
This is where we disagree--Stranger Things is a great show and stands up well to the hype.  No it isn't the best show ever, but it is the best 80's themed sci-fi thriller show ever made.
---
I Don't know Tru3 so I can't really talk for him, but Otz I know really well and you guys are right to an extent. First of all, I Don't think I've ever seen Otz legit rage on a game. I mean even his DS2 no-hit run, when he was on the last DLC boss (can't remember his name for shit) and died, he didn't explode, he didn't start swearing at the screen, he just laid his controller down. I mean at that point the dude spent 3 months or Something getting where he was at, and he just didn't give any more of a fuck because of it. And that attitude just translates really well into basically anything he's playing, he's just Always super lighthearted about everything, even being kinda "smiley" a lot of the time. Idk man, I just love our wholesome boi
---
So it now evens out with the two survivors
---
And if its not that they will jump straight to racist slurs.
---
Yass fresh meat
---
Mood. Stranger Things is overrated IMO. I decided to sit down and watch the first few episodes on Netflix yesterday and it was OK, but nothing that made me feel like I had to binge watch and get caught up like people claim.
---
I mean the base game
---
#smackameg
---
Has it occurred to you that this may be a rewording not a nerf due to the effect it actually has on your game. The slightly/moderately/considerably/tremendously system is stupid and may just be a change in words rather than a nerf
---
And if they do, we'll let them know and they can adjust it before it hits live/soon after to goes live (hopefully)
---
Yeah, I was pointing that out
---
Why not nidus?
---

---
GiVe Me MoRe OrIgInAl KiLlErS
---
Who claimed it comes with 6 perks?? Didnt see anyone saying that
---
I personally don't think it's blowing it out of proportion considering how consistent people get shit talked, DC, act like whiny brats etc and I see so much of it I'm pretty sure the average player is affected by it a pretty decent amount
---
Survivors have been nerfed in some pretty unnecessary ways. Now its either be a great Survivor (10% of Survivors) or be crap (90% of Survivors)
---
Thanks for your valuable input, fellow human.
---
I've seen some people say that it would get 6 perks "to balance the perk number" even though it wouldnt be possible to get the adept achievement and every character in the game has 3 perks, why should Demogorgon be different?
---
Wait, nurse gets light burn, too?
---
Its in game under the game tips section of the help and tutorials
---
Yes, it was on roadmap or something i think.
---
Nurse and Huntress mains on suicicde watch
---
Well I mean technically there will be two more survivors than there are killers. No complaints from me tho as survivors are less impactful and literally just avatars that come with three new perks to the perk pool
---
Not so much on Reddit, but I've seen some people say that
---
Yeah
---
Indoor maps are the worst change my mind.
---
I feel so sorry for steve man
---
Sorry it was late
---
So do you think we're going to get two survivors with separate perks or do you think they'll be like legion where we can just toggle their appearance?
---
Yes and no. I think it depends on the player. There's definitely a learning curve, but it is pretty straight forward if you play the tutorials. I think when I first started I completed the tutorials and it took me about 5 or 6 games before I got my first escape with total randoms, which to me kept making me want to play since it was so difficult. Keep in mind too that with a huge surge of players that means it's more than likely that new players with be matched with new players which works out for the best.
---
Not this community. They literally have tantrums over teabagging.
---
Lots of "PC" Gamers here ;)
---
600.
---
That's a dull totem, not hex.
---
Maybe because we just had Ghostface (and Leatherface)with no survivor and don’t forget that solo survivors can be a thing (think Bill from L4D and Ash) so I think of it like this 
---
there have been 2 solo survivors and 2 solo killers 
---
Demo gets 2 survivors 
---
So to balance it out there would be another killer with no survivor and then it would go back to the regular format
---
It's gotta be something realistic, they obviously aren't gonna add a fucking unicorn killer
---
Can you send me a link that shows these leaks? I'm very interested in bringing this up with my group so that we can discuss.
---
Except for all the quality of life fixes that come out every update and constant communication with the fan base, as well as bug fixing being a different team than content building...
---
A LOT of B grade stuff is fucking awesome! But more than that tends to be just meh, Ok, alright, or simply not that good.
---
DbD just happens to one of those perfect storms. Something not exactly quality, but has a perfect combination of everything in a genre that never really had a perfect storm yet. Natural Selection 2 came close in being a very well made asymmetrical human v monster game, but it went too competitive and driven away the masses.
---
DbD scratches an itch we never knew we had.
---
It's in the help &amp; tutorial menu in game under status effects so you can check there also on leaksbydaylight sub
---
It’s just fucking annoying I can’t get a break from it
---
Wow this guy watches Dead Meat! Kool.
---
Comming 22th at 2 pm EST
---
Shows how powerful the enormity is supposed to be. Taking characters from different dimensions, Ages and even from other higher beings
---
I'd like to apologise for any confusion I caused. It was meant for survivors who call killers trash for beating them fairly, I just never thought to specify it so specifically.
---
I said IF the killer is lag switching, OR has dodgy internet. I’m not suggesting that OP is lag switching, I’m saying that green ping in lobby isn’t always accurate.
---
yea it's not a big deal. DCs are an issue I agree, but that's due to lack of punishment which this game doesn't have hopefully not for long.
---
As someone who has ever played more than 1 MP game ever, the things people do in this game are not toxic at all in comparison. Play Mortal Kombat where there's an achievement to tbag 50 times in a match, go play Halo where tbagging was invented, play TF2 where making someone ragequit is an achievement, go play several other shooters where taunts/emotes are literally created to mock other players. At the end of the day this is still a PvP game and while people can get salty at a lost match, that doesn't make this the "saltiest and most toxic game ever"
---
BMing is always frustrating. Except teabagging that’s always acceptable and never cancer.
---
You havent watched jojo have you?
---
A small price to pay for salvation

---
Somebody didn't do any basic research before posting.
---
Incorrect. The requirements to pip are so fucking low at low ranks, that it's nearly impossible not to rank up if you're stomping with inefficient hooks and such. Once you hit rank 10, then it starts to really make you be efficient.
---
That videos become very classic and they are not enjoyable anymore
---
Could be the same for Ash
---
So you know everyone of them by nicknames. And there's no way some newer players will face your "interesting" builds. Only those "MLGA-exploiting" toxic survivors.

Sure...

Obviously I know that and yea I've seen how other games are pretty damn toxic as MP games are but seriously this game is the most toxic I've experienced by far just because the fact that I'm on console and they literally go out of their way to message me just to insult me.

That's more infection than corrupted.
---
I'd kill for that skin
---
115% is the default movement speed. Didn't get that.
---
I don't see Disney letting DBD use the xeno, unfortunately.
---
In saying that, has Disney let any of their IP in a horror game?
---
Legion is very good at keeping survivors injured, and not just through their own choice (consider Plague, where it's in their best interests not to cleanse). Legion's tracking skills rival Doctor, and they're almost impossible to lose in a chase, so the price they pay is in the last remaining category - hooks.
---
Thankfully you can give Legion a strong hook game by taking Save the Best for Last, or even Make Your Choice - Legion can build 4+ stacks of Save the Best for Last at a time (normal hit, Frenzy hit(s), second Frenzy hit on someone, down them) which means they can very quickly punish multiple people coming in for the save. If you go with Make Your Choice then Legion's mobility means you can be back at the hook in seconds for an easy snowball.
---
Pig comes with an in-built timekiller in the form of her traps (every little helps), and even if they're not activated you can use them to debuff any survivor lucky enough to wear one. She can get a gen grab in the first half-minute, putting her in a very strong position, and Ambush opens up a lot of pallet mindgames.
---
In terms of perks, Legion's Discordance can be very good for efficiency. Pig's Make Your Choice is one of the easier instadowns to activate, and Surveillance can give you a lot of information in the mid-to-late stages of the trial.
---
Are they the strongest killers in the game? No... but just because they're not Nurse doesn't mean they're automatically trash.
---
I'd encourage you to play the game for yourself, rather than have other people play for you. If you like Legion, play Legion. Enjoy Pig? Play Pig. If your only goal is being the "best" then you're wasting your time playing anything other than Nurse. Make your choice?
---
This post is just too long
---
Joseph voice: NIIIIIICE!
---
OH WOW it looks amazing op you did so well
---
Obviously you’d have an option to mute. I feel like that goes with nearly any game.
---
Peanits is a pqrt of the pr/community team, yeah
---
That’s how it should be
---
What would they do with it anyway?
---
More bad movies?
---
Ghostface came with 3 perks for killer and none for survivors
---
Now this chapter we get 6 perks for survs and 3 for killers
---
3+3=0+6=6
---
Waaaaaaaazzzzaaaaaap!
---
Why did i get a nodification of this from reddit?
---
Kinda want deliverance since I got all the killer perks for my haggy
---
Salt
---
Confirmed seperate survivors.
---
The Spencer Mansion, or Winchester Mansion are my dream maps.
---
The host just can't find you
---
Yeah, but the 90% of bad survivors kinda get the short end of the stick
---
Good thing we have hangman noo- oh yeah
---
No need to apologize hon. The only problem is that how you wrote it is too open ended, but it's not like you did any harm :)
---
The only reason they butchered the faces is because they likely didn't get permission to use the actors faces.
---
Newer IPs likely make their actors sign shit so their faces can be used for merch and stuff such as this.
---
Based on your recommended videos, I'm gonna say you're a cool dude.
---
Then they should be learning how to become better, killer should be the power role that’s why it’s a horror game
---
I forgot.
---
The map will exist regardless of DLC, since maps are just added to the base game.
---
I want this to be its chase music, hearing this sped up a bit while being chased by the demogorgon would be terrifying
---
Can people even read? The flair says it’s a shitpost.
---
And we are discussing this particular example not your made up stuff - the OP asked a question and i answered it
---
Its not OP fault that survivors are lagging, its the devs fault they waited with dedicated servers do long 
---
Still it bothers me that you are not even taking into consideration of the fact that survivors can be accountable for their lags in game and will still blame the killer
---
Anyeay I'm gonna have to wait for the Steam sale. Inflation is a thing where I live and it gonna cost me $25 or something of our currency
---
Shes gonna stab I'm now isnt she
---
Thanks!
---
Time to farm blood points. Six new perks 🤩👌
---
get those baby Steve’s
---
The humans only rule is technically a miscomunication on the communities part iirc correctly all that was said was the developers would not be able to non humoid killers would mean something like a dog, or a quadraped killer.
---
This is true but have you seen the YouTube comments?  People can’t wait to be toxic pieces of shit to new people.
---
And really, they cqn change their minds about things. Especially if they get an opportunity like this.
---
Truth. Pretty much all my comments are posted when waiting for a match, lmao.
---
We will see in a week
---
Have you already posted it on r/perkbydaylight?
---
His mori would probably be face to face with the survivors, or claw them. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a power similar to freddy, as in, the dream world, but I don't think they'll to that
---
Astounding
---
I can see some 80s inspired cosmetics being a thing, but not character costumes.
---
No buddy not at all. Two completely different things from using the strongest loops as a survivor to using the strongest killer with strongest add ons. Plus you just said the game is supposed to be about fun yet you suggested face camping? You are more than likely not a very good killer and survivor.
---
His shock now puts people into the Dying stare.
---
Wtf happened to Nancy's face?
---
They wouldn’t have had the first kill anyway. After two missed swings and dropping the first survivor they would’ve broken free if they tried to take them to a hook. Huntress was fucked either way good play by Laurie.
---
From an economic standpoint? It would be horrible
---
Dang, this would be dope
---
I hope he says this every time you change to the Scoops Ahoy cosmetic.
---
I would love for his ability to be for the Demogorgon to go into the upside down, aka completely invisible to survivors vision, and then he can spawn in on trees or T / L walls or building walls. Similar to the show
---
They only have rights to the mask nothing else
---
You're not alone. I watched ST, first 2 seasons are good, last one is meh. I don't see how the Demogorgon fits the Entity's realm, it looks ridiculous because all other residents are/were humans (survivors and killers).
---
But we should keep our mouths shut for a while, otherwise we get downvoted to hell and judged cause we're not hyped for an overrated show brought into the game. I wanted an original killer too :(
---
I do get why BHVR did this and it was a very strategic move to bring new players and make themselves more visible in the gaming industry.
---
I recently started playing killer and finally understand these types of memes.
---
Killers have a unique ower and gameplay, survivors are *mostly* skins, but all characters have 3 perks that only they can use at first (until you hit a certain level with them or unlock the perk in the shrine, then anyone can learn that perk)
---
New killer- The Trashman      
---
Height- Small.      
---
Power- throws trash’s all over the ring, then eats the garbage      
---
         
---
New survivor- Dayman.          
---
Perks- Fighter of the Night Man         
---
           - Champion of the sun          
---
           - Master of karate
---
Have you played it recently? Jason kills every fucking body lol. Survivors have less stamina than an overweight grandma and the controls are ass and never have been fixed.
---
But, for some unknown reason, I find games with parties and solo faster in that game then I do in DBD and there's only ever like 600-900 people online.... Wonder why?????
---
Cause its true
---
Not super related, but is it bad that I don't play survivor cause I'm too spooked?
---
It would of been cool if jason was chapter 13 but they are probably never going to add him
---
yes?? you angry or something??
---
Like, if I had all perks on all survivors I would let each one with a different build and then play the build I feel like.
---
I guess
---
&gt;In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence.
---
My dude, I never stated I knew more or I was more knowledgeable than someone else. I think you might not understand what I said or just acting in bad faith, you choose.
---
I say that 1) I don't trust peanits for past experience with him and dbd "mods" that do more harm than good in the forum and in the community with very few exceptions 2) I don't trust someone who provides data that say two totally different things from a period of time to another without any major change especially when we have no idea about the methodology about it.
---
About the methodology I already stated that I don't know what high ranks means for them, how DC has been managed and so on. My dear, I don't say I know more than anyone so before spitting these kind of assumptions without even acknowledging what a person say, it's rather silly.
---
I don't trust them in regards of data for many reasons, especially after several streams where they show how clueless they are about their game in many instances. Be skeptical about the data they provide doesn't mean I'm under Dunning-Kruger effect, I had to quote it since looks like you have no idea what it is if you think doubting about a company that has several reasons to lie or not be able to give a decent data. Not everyone can do that since it's easy to mess up if you don't have a background on data collection
---
They proved that several times and this instance is one of many. They always said to take these stats with a grain of salt to then further explain several excuses why so. It's obvious I'm gonna be skeptical once again when they provide, yet, another stat especially when contradicts what they said before
---
Before judging someone without having no idea about the thoughts of that person, I won't just throw around terms to sound smart, you might sound the opposite of you use them in a way that's inappropriate.
---
&gt;You don’t know how statistics work so you see something that looks wrong and proclaim that that means all of Behaviour’s statistics are untrustworthy, when in reality you just fail to understand what you’re looking at. 
---
I think I answered about this point well enough. Plus I don't know if all stats of them are untrustworthy but for sure I'll be skeptical about them. It's not like a federation who send datas about the population growth for example, where people studied to do that and analyzing data. They are a small company who can make mistakes, more often than not, and based on previous bad data I won't take them on face value. I prefer have no data than bad data, that's it, since bad data is way more harmful than anything else
---
Have you checked out Hybrid Panda? He seems to have the most charisma if that’s what you’re specifically looking for. I really enjoy watching him not because of his skill, but his personality.
---
Yeah i guess people will buy into the hype anyways
---
I think in the 20s, but you can only get one.
---
Oh God, please no.
---
good troll
---
I know that, just didn’t know when they showed up
---
Your first comment outright stated that lag is the survivors’ fault so your answer was wrong. Since the killer is the host they also bear responsibility for lag at least some of the time. I’m not sure why you’re being so defensive, it’s a P2P connection so both parties can cause lag.
---
shut up nea looks cute :(
---
Man I had fun playing Naughty Dog MPs, I wish I framed all the salty messages I got from players. The reason people are claiming this is such a toxic game is because they label everything survivors or the killer does as such. All the way down to something as Tbags, btw I wasn't labeling all the games I listed as toxic, I was showing how all the shit people complain about in this game is no big deal.
---
Wow how entitled and toxic is the fact that new killer is subjectively not likeable for one person that is me.
---
You sound pretty toxic yourself though.
---
The Queue Time Is Too Damn High!
---
Too similar to freddy
---
leave Claudette alone!
---
I'm pretty sure Billy only exists because they couldn't have leatherface yet. Then they got the license, which is why there so similar.
---
I strictly let the babies go. People that are adorable and make me go "awwwwwwww" I can't kill. Plus I feel like the babies are significantly more stoked when they get an escape vs people that are optimal/have a lot of game time.
---
The Entity doesn't love you, Tenno.
---
Not like Tyr loves the TOOBMEN!
---
So StRoNg, GuEsS mY mEtA pErK bUiLd IsN't EnOuGh To BeAt ThIs M1 KiLlEr
---
I'm a weirdo, so I try to a different build for each character based on their personality traits, like Claudette being the Medic, or Nea being the stealthy one. The only exception is my Quentin, who is my main.
---
Oh i was assuming that its base movement speed would be 110% or so.  Maybe a simdge faster
---
Fair point
---
Could maybe use his mom thing in some way. Maybe she (Possibly the Entity talking through/mimicking her?) gives orders, and if he follows them he becomes stronger.
---
less than a day and already 2Million views
---
Time to bust out Myers and face people who don't understand how he works.
---
Is that you Yaniv
---
You can climb the ranks with any killer because there will always be potato survivors even at rank 1. Every killer isn’t necessary viable against the best survivor players, but plenty of streamers have climbed to rank 1 with stuff like perkless wraith.
---
1v4 multiplayer horror game. 4 survivors, one killer.
---
I honestly really like that idea. They need some way to actually look like their name. I always wished that Feral Frenzy would make the survivor see 4 Legions instead of one. Brilliant mind game capabilities with that
---
I'd love to play a game as legion against you. Would be interesting.
---
Who knows? Disney haven't made an Alien film
---
 yet.
---
Disney might own the rights to say Star Wars and Marvel but as far as I know they only distribute the films, don't actually make them.
---
By content you mean shitty cosmetics and absolutely no bug fixes
---
Yeah I always thought that the upside down would be too similar to the old Freddy’s dream world
---
And for good reason
---
Good idea, I'm going to trap survivors in a corner once the dlc drops. Tbagging the entire time.
---
I’m so sorry for the inconvenience
---
EZ
---
seriously? a DLC is only 7 euros for me
---
They could make it like the Dream Witch from Identity V. There yould be 4 killers, but we can control only one at a time. The other 3 that aren't being controlled could be sleeping and wake up when we start to control them. This would give them a massive map control and would make Legion more viable.
---
Now *THIS* is content
---
How do I delete some else's comment
---
It takes me atleast 10 minutes to find a match as killer watchu mean
---
That auto start when fixing generator. Killer can teleport to said tv if survivor stayed longer than 7 sec.
---
Lmfao the devs don't deserve it. They're literally just hitching a ride off their licensed DLC instead of fixing their shit excuse for a game.
---
Dude. That's such a great concept, but I can't see how he would work if you're playing against a group of SWF. Because that would be cool if you slowly turn into a survivor and you could only kill another survivor if they're by themselves.
---
But what if it likes Cock And Ball Torture?
---
How is a hardware store scream property?
---
I feel this
---
in thursday they will show the full chapter before release, which includes the power, perks and map
---
I wasn't even aware that was a thing, but I will post it there now, thanks.
---
Good point lmao
---
The doctor is only good against noobs.
---
The demogorgon is in its own category For relationships with the entity. He is a good boy who hooks survivors for treats and belly rubs
---
I would actually love this. With a map of underground mines? Hell yea.
---
No problem!
---
Honestly for perk I ain't got a damn clue but for the gorgon I think it'll definitely be Freddy but less waiting around to attack and phase through walls but besides that idk.
---
*Laughs in Legion/Pig*
---
I mean I think it's kind of established that there can be multiple demogorgons. Weren't Demo-dogs essentially baby demogorgons?
---
I guess the people who own the mask said we would just like ghost face no map for him? And I think bhvr was planning stranger things in the ghost face dlc which is why no new map or survivor
---
Spirit with yakuyoke amulet + dirty uwabaki, stridor, haunted grounds, ruin, rancor = ez win
---
Demogorgon. It's Demogorgon.
---
The licensing deal was that they could only use the mask and name
---
The xenomorph is a humanoid and walks on 2 legs in the original movie (AND the Alien Isolation game) it's only non humanoid trait is it's tail and it's only quadrupedal in the AvP movies, just for the sake of giving it movility for action sequences and Alien 3, where he is literally born out of a bull
---
I refuse to believe they won’t eventually add him. Makes no sense not to at some point once the drama settles down.
---
I got jumpscared
---
Probably 8-10
---
Yep, yep lol That "e" on the end makes a HUGE difference lmao =)
---
There's a one clown limit in these parts.
---
Nope just curious
---
Or when you go to get that sweet unhook after 99ing the exit gates to avoid blood warden
---
EXPOSED
---
Nice to hear :)
---
Gamers:
---
What would “The creeper’s” power be?
---
We're worried about similarity now? Freddy's new powers is basically a combination of existing killers, nobody seemed to have a problem with that
---
It takes a lot of commitment from the devs. Look at Warframe, it almost died like five times before Totalbuiscit gave it a shout out, and now it's one of the biggest free to play juggernauts in the industry.
---
I feel like it’ll be like the dream world but rather than pull survivors in he comes out,maybe like the wrath does from cloak? Either that or he’ll be Able to go through walls as a ability which means you’d have to kite him like you would a nurse.
---
Yes, but only if the suicide attempt fails.
---
I think as long as the item doesn’t get picked up and used, and you don’t leave with something else, you should get it back if you warded.
---
It just adds to franklins literally just being bm
---
I wish it was this way in Brazilian servers. If survivors lose it's the Killer's fault. One day I sent a GG and got a "Go suck a big, fat ball, Son of a Whore".
---
So I did not quite well understand what that portal idea was, but the idea of the upside-down world you had is really interesting to me. Like I'd love it was put into game, especially for the no exit gates part. That would make it a bit like dream world BUT with it's own intéresting feature. Though I'd say the upside down world should have another thing about it, otherwise it's only useful for late game. 
---
So maybe imagine this: upside-down world has no exit gates. Exiting the upside down world can only be done by taking one of the 5 permanent portals that are around the map. Also, the Demogorgon can take a permanent portal to go inside the upside-down world. When in it, his terror radius is reduced by 50% for both worlds, his movespeed is increased by 4%, and he can exit it by creating an ephemeral portal that requires a 2 seconds channeling time on any wall.
---
Upside down? Dream world. TP to jungle gyms? TP to gens
---
I mean, didnt she already had her revenge by killing her father and is now bound to the entity?
---
Something involving the Upside-Down makes the most sense, though that might also be a part of the map instead. I've only seen the first season today though, so idk. Maybe a kind of Spirit-Freddy mix where Survivors need to use Lockers to enter or leave the Upside-Down, and the killer swaps with a short channel, and anything in the upside-down cannot be seen, touched etc in the real, or vice-versa. With flickering lights instead of a terror radius if the demogorgon is in the other dimension. Half the generators, totems are in the upside-down but being in there is risky (Negative effects like Hindered, Broken, etc, modified by addons while in there, no action speed messing though), though swapping dimensions could also be a way to evade the killer.
---
toxic cutey
---
Says only you
---
The ptb was announced?
---
Whats that??
---
It’s not being a dick, crouching twice is definitely not bullying
---
Good good
---
Course now I'm getting downvoted on top of it. Looks like I hurt someones feelings
---
Lol, I tear most Legions apart cuz they tunnel.
---
His mori would definitely be ripping someone's skin off!
---
Considering there’s very few scary things in this game probably, especially coupled with the fact that with Spine chill you can completely avoid the killer for the whole match very easily if you want that play style
---
25. 85% sure on this
---
The game is not balanced if it is inescapable. Killers should not be getting 4ks every game just a survivors should not be getting out every game.
---
You are correct, just hit 25
---
Why was this downvoted he’s saying it’s awful
---
Monitor &amp; abuse or pop goes the weasel
---
Gotta work on my butt dancing
---
I think they have seen the feedback from other indoor maps and have decided to make this one less broken
---
They will do a streaming at 2 pm EST. Its in their web.
---
Yes because generators in an underground mine is a wonderful idea
---
Trapper Has a cosmetic like that
---
I’m not saying literally survivors should never be able to escape, I’m just saying that it should feel like that and the survivors should have the odds stacked against them
---
If my team would DC I'd run to the killer so he would get some points sacrificing me

The Shining!!!
---
demogorgons are light-sensitive overall anyway. bet his face starts to burn when you "blind" him.
---
&gt; your first comment was basically "its the killers responsibility"
---
No it wasn’t. Reread my comment and note the word IF. 
---
I rarely get complaints about my connection when I play killer so I can’t relate, but I’m sure it’s frustrating. Maybe there’s an underlying issue with your internet? Maybe not, but it could be worth checking if your sick of people complaining.
---
Sub is full of killer mains who don’t realize bloodlust was added to counter a mechanic that isn’t in the game any more
---
Sure why not
---
Dont spam with your shitty discord links, one is more then enough
---
This does put a hole in my head canon. But who cares, being untamable doesn’t mean your not a good boy
---
Barb cannot return
---
It would break the sense of urgency to find will from when she died in-the upside down
---
leaks or official perk announcements? hope they have that nice video explaining perks just like with the scream guy
---
Pretty spicy
---
their rule was pretty much “if it has more than 2 legs it won’t be added due to animation complications.”
---
i believe this is the same situation with trapper and jason from f13.
---
Sounds fun.
---
Leave Jonathan alone he's a handsome boyo
---
Just ignore him. He loves to argue with people and doesn't take no for an answer. Not worth anyone's time
---
Ok fair enough but how far did u watch tho
---
Maybe if the game grows more (especially with the new chapters) they can ask again in the future and they’ll reconsider.
---
Because he has his own greatly inferior game he is trapped in
---
Not saying DbD isn't popular but I would imagine a lot of those clicks are from people just thinking there's something new to do with the show. They probably don't even know what DbD is.
---
My understanding is that the F13 devs purchased the rights to Jason from the studio but *not* the other IPs used (such as Camp Crystal Lake), which the original writer never sold to the studio in the first place. I may be misinformed but that's what I'd heard.
---
take an upvote to counter those idiots trying to downvote you just cuz you never saw the show...dicks.
---
From what I have observed:
---
Level 1-9: Only one perk, you have to get everything to level up
---
Level 10-24: Either one or two perks, probably random.
---
Level 25+: Two Perks
---
It actually is a pretty good idea because that's where generators are most needed
---
Like 10 eps and then I found it really boring
---
It's more a party game that people treat competitively
---
&gt;I'm amazed just how strong of a game DbD turned out to be.
---
Honestly if someone told me back in 2016, few weeks after the Steam release when I started playing, this game would be that popular and still growing in 2019, having almost all of my favourite horror killers (yes "almost", still hoping for Jason one day) I wouldn't believe them. Getting even Myers back in 2016 was fucking cool but I didn't expect devs would get so wild with having that many licenses.
---
Don't get me wrong, I've always had had tons of fun with this game, but I honestly didn't expect this concept to last for so long and for so many people. I mean DbD never had problem with the number of players even at it's lowest, but what's amazing is that it's still going strong even now. 
---
Seriously, good job devs.
---
They will do a streaming its in their official website
---
exactly, so i am a killer main and i was arguing with someone and they were saying that “since bloodlust exists then exhaustion should go back to how it was” i said “why not just remove bloodlust” and they went “nah they should just give us back the good exhaustion”
---
ive never had such a db argument
---
I’ve never seen two perks before 25
---
Shoot me a request, I'll add you when I get home ;)
---
Indeed.
---
Where can I read about that change?
---
As much as I wish there’d be a perk that makes exhaustion recover at 50% when sprinting, I get it’s op.
---
ok thanks for the info.
---
Bubba is useless with it.
---
I would let baby Dwights go (Ive met only one, sacrificed him along swf, and still feel bad about him). If you're good as survivor, you arent getting mercy. This is my sign of respect to people's skill.
---
&lt;333
---
Hoe can you dictate on what their original vision was? Theres people that keep saying it was only meant to be human killers but none have no evidence or source of that information. The thing was humanoid killers and this new one coming is definitely humanoid. It all comes down to how they could implement the character in their game and humanoids make it easy since animating would be similar to the rest. This chapter doesn't break any theme because it's still an murderous humanoid individual.
---
Either way, you're still gonna play the game so who cares
---
You better finish that final destination kill count
---
This was the gap between seasons one and two
---
T o x i c. You are the reason i dont Show mercy to people in dbd anymore.
---
I loved that feeling when I just started, nowadays most players just laugh at killers.
---
Every once in a while you get that random jumpscare myers who grabs you off a gen and makes you scream like a little girl lol.
---
If I had to choose someone from Aliens it would be Vasquez
---
I need predator
---
The killer is definitely responsibile to have a decent connection. WiFi packet drop or congested networks can ruin a game and can easily show as a green ping in the lobby only to crap out during the game - where is your "if" here??? You implied its only the killers responsibility so stop doublbacking on that
---
And if my internet is powerful enough to download the latest doom in 3 hours and run Twitch in the highest resolution without stopa - then its not my fault and i dont need to check anything
---
Did someone say pallet stun and flashlight click?
---
And will says FINALLY ITS NOT ME
---
The problem is, devs stopped working on it because of the lawsuit. It's not a bad game, worse than DbD but I remember having tons of fun with it.
---
What will its story be lol
---
Give Otzdarva a try, and maybe Fungoose too.
---
Otz is constantly engaging with the viewer, explaining what's happening in the game and why, and nearly every build is non-meta because Otz is playing for enjoyment. Mostly killer (random rotation or viewer vote) but a few survivor matches too.
---
Monto is best known for their meme build YouTube videos, but they stream on Twitch too. If you like the YouTube content then it's more of the same.
---
None of them have the flashiest presentation, it's just someone enjoying playing the game and helping other people to enjoy playing the game too. Your mileage may vary.
---
Michael doesn’t even have eyes 🤷‍♂️
---
Paragraph isn't even an official term but yeah. There were original killers in between the licensed ones. It hasn't just been consecutive licensed killers so I'm not sure why you're upset
---
No, usually only 1 person survives.
---
This about to be the biggest moneymaker for dbd
---
Yeah along with 10 brand new ones
---
Oh cool thz for the info mate
---
Depends on the situation
---

Same, I only watched somewhere around 2 or 3 episodes. I'm just really looking forward to more content.

Nope. Still just the one and only, same old, tired joke.
---
MY stupid question is, can I get the perks of killers/survivors that I havent bought the DLC for? I dont have the game yet but really enjoy watching others play it and started thinking about the killer/survivor and perks I want to use, but my knowledge about this kinda stuff is quite limited.
---
Thanks in advance :)
---
I think you should reread the definition you provided because I’m not sure you understood it. 
---
You’re trying to poke holes in Behaviour’s statistics in a way that might make sense on the surface - 80% and 50% are very different, so there’s a problem or the numbers are wrong. But the reasoning given by Behaviour’s data team explains the difference. There isn’t necessarily a problem with the data, but there was a missing piece of information. Anomalies come up in statistical analysis all the time. Understanding the reason for the anomaly is part of the analysis. This is why they tell you to take things with a grain of salt, because there isn’t always a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship between two data points. The fact that they qualify their statistics with that disclaimer tells me that they understand more than most of the people they’re releasing the stats for. 
---
Behaviour doesn’t need to be a government think tank to release stats. If they have a data team, their data analysts likely studied mathematics and statistics. Many businesses have qualified data analysts, that’s part of how they make business decisions.
---
And I’ll be glad to be wrong if it happens.

1 survivor + 1 killer
---
1 killer (Ghostface)

1 survivor (ash vs evil dead)

2 survivors + 1 killer (stranger things)

Basically this. It’s essentially a Witcher author versus CD Projekt Red bc he wants more money situation again, but this time a game developer is caught in the all-encompassing wrathful lense of this one asshole writer that thinks he’s entitled to more money.
---
I agree with this so much. I purchased this game with my friends and we played together for less than 10 rounds, my friends just gave up after due to the toxicity and unbalanced gameplay.
---
On our second match, we had that guy with mask and red jacket who applies traps to our heads, and he morie my 2 friends while I was already on the hook. That killer was green color rank, while we were all rank 20, with almost no experience. I will never understand the matchmaking of this game.
---
Not just that, the killer also started calling us "noob", "kys", "cry more", and finally "gg :)" after the match. I know killer don't like flashlight item, but none of us had any items so I have no idea why this person was so toxic.
---
I am aware the game is difficult for killers main in higher ranks, but do the devs seriously think this game is balanced for survivors in lower ranks? LOL
---
No wonder the game is losing players, because the devs do nothing about the unbalanced gameplay. They only care about red rank killer who want all kills and expect newcomer survivor to eat the bs or be treated like scum.
---
Wow I dont believe that nea can be so beautiful
---
Mh friend spells it as Demon Avocado for some reason.
---
You are literally bitching and moaning 24/7 lmfao you don't get to cry about toxicity when you are its star purveyor
---
I didn’t post that comment, lmao. You’re quoting an entirely different person.
---
More noobs :p so excited for the player base to grow
---
I would love Play With Your Food since I got Save the Best For Last in the shrine some weeks ago and it seems like a bunch of fun. Pop Goes The Weasel would be nice too. 
---
For survivors, I'm on PS4 so having to grind Bill to get Borrowed Time again to have it on all my survivors is something I would rather avoid. Then maybe Diversion because it seems pretty fun.
---
I wasn't implying that they were killing to regain their humanity. I interpreted this passage, "With each passing death, a little bit of the Survivor's soul is lost. Eventually as all hope evaporates, the Survivor becomes less and less useful to the Entity, slowly devolving into a cold and emotionless shell." As the entity corrupting the survivors and eventually turning them into killers themselves.
---
Not that the killers we have currently are the survivors, but rather the entity creating new killers out of it's former victims. 
---
However, I did miss this bit "Those lost Survivors, whose hope has long since left them, were eventually thrown into a limbo realm known as 'The Void'" 
---
So my interpretation wasn't correct *shrug* 
---
I still think it'd be an interesting concept regardless.
---
how do you Not see the daily noed/camp/tunnel posts. there are both here
---
You must be really fun at parties.
---
When the nurse came out i absolutely despised the idea of playing her and didnt like the concept of her , i only started playing her when she had 2 blinks and plague came out - that's the concept of trying to like something, giving something a chance, you can like something you didnt at the first place 
---
I am mean because you are clearly ignorant, the devs give us do much Hope for the game to be better and the likes of you will always find something to bitch about
---
Would you ever honestly tattoo something NSFW on yourself though? Of either gender?
---
But particularly imagine picking a risque version of a sociopathic serial killer presented as evil incarnate.
---
You can buy them with iridescent shards through the shrine, which has four random perks that changes every seven days.  But you may have to wait several months before finding the perk you want to buy.
---
The problem is money and most of the time you wouldn’t watch all the horror movies bc it would take way too long.
---
I mean I’d be down lol
---
Big streamers in general don't do much for me, might as well watch them on youtube. Ever since I found a super chill smaller streamer who actually has some personality it's a lot more enjoyable.
---
Only through the Shrine of Secrets afaik. Which is extremely limited. Getting other perks requires leveling the survivor with the perk until you unlock the teachable version of that perk.
---
It's very grindy but it isn't as bad as some mobile games, and if you enjoy the game it's not so bad.
---
Ooooohhhh!!!! When????
---
Ptb?

My bad, fuck that guy then

My artist has been trying to get me to tattoo a NSFW for a while now, I keep saying no. He wants to do an old school piece with a sailor girl and her legs spread open. Either way, it was this persons body so I guess it was there choice yaknow? Art is subjective 🤷🏻‍♀️

Is The Stranger Things Chapter Confirmed To Cost More then a regular chapter that includes 1 Killer and Survivor?

Are you insane? Netflix makes BANK, they have a ton of phenomenal shows that have large fan bases.
---
Yeah, honestly can't really call them crossovers when they're within the same universe/brand.
---
Played against some guy called RedPanda something who admits to doing that. He’s a self proclaimed rank 1 huntress who deranks after rank reset to like 20 and then goes back to red ranks. Infuriating.
---
We’re supposed to wait 3 weeks until we’re allowed to do spoilers
---
To be perfectly honest, this game is an awkward one for me.
---
I started playing for the first time right after the Ghost Face update when the game became available on Xbox Game Pass. I played it for a little bit and thought it was neat but felt very difficult for me, as a new player, to really get into.
---
Part of it was the slow progression of leveling and earning perks(although I've been told that they're going to be making some adjustments to that in the near future) but mostly it's just the fact that a lack of skill results in you getting incapacitated very quickly and then having to go through the long, daunting process of waiting to die and another long, daunting process of searching for another match. It's just a very difficult game to sufficiently practice and train in. Keep in mind that I only played survivors when I tried it out because the idea of playing as survivors was more appealing to me and also because I assume that playing as the killer comes with a much longer wait time to find a match.
---
I just installed it again yesterday though because I did in fact have some fun with it when I tried it the first time and I'm willing to give it another shot. I also decided to go ahead and buy Ash Williams to play as because I thought that maybe getting to play as one of my favorite horror movie characters will help keep me invested a little more in wanting to progress and improve.
---
Any advice you have is welcome EXCEPT for suggesting that I find a group to play with. Finding a group is very unlikely to happen for me. I don't personally know people who play this game. I don't personally know people who play many games at all. It's just not very likely that I'll end up finding a group of friends to play this with.
---
I don't but now I will.
---
Never got that vibe from him but he uses profanity quite often when compared to the other big DBD creators and can be loud at times. Which are usually characteristics of a douchebag. Lol.
---
seems unlikely seeing as a new predator game is coming.
---
The xeno can tear apart squads of armed marines, the idea of one getting looped and pallet stunned makes it seem a little goofy
---
Don’t be a dick
---
I can never predict those darned developers
---
I did find a good streamer quite new to twitch but had a funny and charismatic group decent gameplay but was just funny tbf LukeyyMann was the name.
---
I dont know.
---
Ok i see where you're coming from now.
---
The only real issue i have is the Entity still feeds off of the killers emotions. Thrill to kill, hatred, that kind of stuff. An "emotionless shell" even as a killer, wouldn't be able to feed the Entity anything.
---
Though there is potential that "The Void" could change that broken shell... into something terrifying. Even though you interpretation wasn't spot on, there actually is potential there.
---
The baseline idea of a killer that once was a survivor is a solid idea, and unique still. I could see them doing something like it in the future.
---
and THIS is why you never trap INSIDE the pallet, EVER
---
To be fair they are almost never true
---
Freddy a giant version of his hand and glove?
---
If the match is going well for me, someone who got repeatedly farmed off the hook and left for dead, or generally screwed over by their team.
---
Let's say Bill gets sandbagged by Claudette, or Dwight uses Bond to run the Killer to Bill, or Meghead keeps blowing the generator Bill is on. And then here comes Claudette to unhook without Borrowed Time two seconds after I down Bill (yes, before I even reach the hook).
---
My personal preference is for the purely adorable Feng, though it can be any survivor who got seriously trolled, and if I'm playing casually then the last survivor can usually go free unless they were toxic.
---
Otherwise it's a survivor who impressed me, I *do* kill all four of them sometimes (even when the last is a Feng), generally this means they have to pull off some pretty daring rescues and evade me in *smart* ways - if they just held W around Cowshed I'm still gonna kill them.
---
Lastly. I'm pretty biased against Dwights, any rank 20 should be shown compassion, but most Dwights I see (as both Killer and Survivor) are basically assholes who will farm, sandbag, and troll with Bond.
---
I like David players though, most of the ballsiest people I see are playing David.
---
I made a post giving my ideas for his perks
---
I sort by new to upload good content , there are seperate chats, posts to do uploads for discord groups like that 
---
Spamming is not acceptable in that manner
---
public test build
---
AWESOME!!!
---
Tell me about it lol,  the Assg /vg/ is filled with a bunch of them as well. Being nice and friendly in a game about ruthlessly hunting down and murdering people.
---
I never claimed to be on the hype train for anything. I stated that I'm happy to be getting content for a game I enjoy. I could care less who they add because it'll just be more perks for me to play with. I don't see what lobbies being flooded with characters have to do with anything. They are just characters, that's it. I get to play either way, I don't care what characters pop up. The game evolving isn't going to ruin it or anything.  It brings in new players and new players bring more life to the game. It wouldn't make it a mess and it's not losing its identity. The game is still there, and objectives are still there. It's you just assuming that the dev's vision is human/classical killer icons. It's their game, their vision, their decisions. If they want to break away from an original idea then they have every right to. The game will evolve, it will stay populated and will continue to make money whether you like it or not
---
Idk I feel like it’s getting better

ALso people getting triggered at the tbag, he earned the outplay and taunted accordingly.
---
If that killer had gotten a cheeky hit at a jungle gym and nodded, nobody would bat an eye.
---
Teabagging at safe eye level loops is sorta BM, but here it's just letting trapper know he was outplayed lmao
---
By lore, Mikey was brought into the dimension as soon as Halloween I ended. At that time, he was only down one eye from being poked with a coat hanger, but the Entity heals wounds upon entering the realm, so there's also that.
---
I remember when payday 2 had the crossover with dbd before the beta even happened and all there was, was a few short clips of not even game play just atmosphere all I could say was "I don't know what this is but I need to play this." and then it came out and it was such an interesting experience. And then I was also blown away when myers came, it was just such a big deal getting a license like that and they did him so well, it really felt like Michael Myers. BHVR caught lightning in a bottle with this game, nothing will ever experience this kind of success.

This guys is getting Don voted to hell but he's right. One salty person prob down voted then everyone jumped on the bandwagon.
---
I was very happy to see them, then suddenly very sad since DBD lore wise this means they’re doomed
---
I'm fine as mobile Bubba without Insidious in high ranks, so my point stands
---
I’m fairly new to playing killer and I’m trying to get the hag leveled up so I can get everybody Ruin. Are there any methods you guys use to farm BP?
---
I'm personally hoping something like adrenaline for the survivor side and maybe spirit fury or hex haunted ground for killer
---
alright then..... XD
---
Considering they keep nerfing gen speeds, survivors are always in a crunch to rush gens. If you aren't rushing gens currently in the meta, you probably are going to die.
---
I wonder if it could eventually happen if this game keeps getting supported for long enough.
---
I mean, I'm sure they've got to come to terms with the fact that this game isn't competing with the Friday the 13th video game anymore.

Get Leatherface and unlock his ''Barbecue and Chili'' perk. This perk at level gives you double bloodpoints as long as you hook every survivor at least once.
---
Well creatures in the show don’t like light so it works

I'll try it later today.

---
Thank you!
---
I mean we beat a 3 gen doc because three people were focusing on drawing him to two of the open generators while the fourth worked on the one that was out of sight. The doc should have checked the third but the other survivors were distracting enough for him to not think about it 🤷‍♀️
---
Good question. It’s a possibility, but I don’t think so.
---
Well if that ever happens again (I hope not) I'll be sure to follow your tip!
---
Yeah i could see that, i was just thinking with the ability to vault through a wall having a slower killer makes sense. Tho the charge should probs be pretty quick. But cancelling out would have to take a littlebit
---
*wipes tears with blood stained cloth*
---
Leatherface and BBQ have been on my radar for a while now. I was hoping to get BBQ out of the shrine but based on what I’ve heard it looks like I’m just gonna have to bite the bullet and spend the $5.

Cuz killer is harder on controller
---
I mean to be fair four guys are trying to coordinate and strategize to overcome an extremely difficult objective.
---
Then there is one guy running around in literal God mode playing left click simulator.
---
*99% of the time a killer shouldn't feel good about a victory.*
---
 The game is designed to in a way that survivors are supposed to coordinate. Killers don't have to coordinate with anyone. That fact alone puts the odds heavily in the killers favor. 
---
The amount of game knowledge survivors need to maintain to be able to properly deal with certain mechanics (hex: Ruin, BBQ &amp; Chili, dream mechanics, etc) is insane. Killers essentially don't even need specific survivor knowledge to win the game. I mean maybe you want to play around a sprint burst or something but that is in *NO WAY* the same as trying to figure out how to deal with something like dream mechanics on the fly. 
---
Killers should get 50-75% of the blood points they get currently and surviros should have their blood points boosted by at least 50% and perhaps just doubled. 
---
It's insane that the heavily disadvantaged group requiring coordination and precise game play is punished in the form of fewer blood points. 
---
Killers don't need an extra incentive to play them. Just look at queue time for a killer. Obviously there aren't enough surviolvors in the pool. Incentivized survivors by boosting blood point gain.
---
I'm happy to see other people watch dead meat, I know that it's a popular channel now but when he first came out I had nobody to talk to about his videos
---
I don't think it's going to be possible to balance his perk either. Either he breaks every hook for so long that he doesn't have to come back and do it again (even if it's not permanent) at any time during the match, or he doesn't.
---
Doesn't he already break them for 3 minutes anyway? Four survivors on generators pop them in under two minutes, so he *still* disables hooks he sabotages for the entire match (Less than two minutes on generators to pop all five, twenty seconds on exit gate, forty seconds to spare).
---
99ing, while a legitimate strategy, makes that corner of the map hell for Killers and if it could be done reliably would just see it nerfed again.
---
I can relate to this.
---
Still getting it though bcos the demigorgon takes me back to my Amnesia days
---
Kindly give me a example when I've ever insulted anyone and or whine about how survivors are too op or killers too op.
---
Buy it for me.
---
Best survivor perks?
---
Predators would be hard because there is a predator game coming next year, where you hunt as predator
---
Enjoy your death trap, ladies!
---
Not sure what actual playercounts look like, but for me personally it’s more interesting to watch than to play because it gets pretty frustrating after a bit (I have a stroke every time I’m in a chase as survivor, peaked as a rank 14 Hag) and I have way too much shit on my list to play through that promises more gratification in that regard...
---
It’s certainly not the game, just me not being good enough to properly enjoy it for long, and I doubt I’m the only one there.
---
If you’re upset about not getting a ptb, you’re not missing much. Terrible load times, possible game breaking bugs, a complete lack of ranking system (wanna fight a rank 19 and a rank 2 in the same round?) and an overall meh experience. Best off watching videos of it then actually doing it
---
This has become into a meme
---
Well then they aren't a good legion then
---
I imagine it like a big waiting room full of well known horror characters, and every once in a while BHVR will call in a few of them to be put in the game, except Jason is chained down to ground and can't come.

---
It has not been confirmed. However, if it does cost more, it might be on sale during Halloween on Steam. Most of the DLC goes on sale at that time.
---
I think i know its ability
---
Secondary: Climb and faster boi
---
Primary: Create portals between the entitys World and the Upside down. When in the upside down you have no terrorradius, you are basically not even in the entitys realm. You can then move around in the upsidedown to another portal and end up where you placed the other portal, surprising the survivors because you had no terrorradius. I think survivors may use these portals too and you will be notified if they do.

Honestly this is what I needed in my life
---
I would normally tell people to crop out the bottom thumbnails, but upon seeing the kill count, i can therefore deduct that you are a (wo) man of culture
---
yassss mr quigley
---
Lol almost ever killer is shit at the game. It's why they pick killer.
---
Killers want a game where they can left click in God mode with no consequences and win. Then they get mad when they play against anything but a group of 4 people with no comms or experience together.
---
It is exactly what I thought when I saw the trailer « gurl we going mainstream »
---
None, shrine is a waste of shards. Better spend on new characters or save up for cosmetics
---
Wow reading what I said that was super incoherent sorry, I'm on mobile.
---
5 = Tenacity
---
Two perks seem to appear at the levels you unlock another slot while two always appear at level 25
---
Lithe, quick and quiet, lightweight, iron will is a fun houdini build
---
I understood it well enough plus my mind kinda auto corrected it.
---
1-bond
---
Finally someone gets number 5 =D
---
I never noticed the two perks at those levels before 25, I shall look out for them next time I level someone
---
Or I must say 'Tenasscity'. xD
---
Lul
---
5 - Tenacity?
---
They will definitely have The Scoops involved.
---
This may be an unpopular opinion but I never liked Johnathan. I'm glad it's Steve being put in the game with Nancy instead.
---
Mmmm your salt tastes fucking delicious
---
I'm pretty sure its two perks at level 10 to make the point of the entity fighting you in the blood web, then when you pick one the entity claims the other. After that you only get 1 again most of the time until level 25 where you 100% get 2 each time, that's why level 11-25 can be some of the most expensive blood webs because you get full webs but a slow entity.
---
The real question is will dbd go f2p as this launches? No doubt it would bring in a lot more players
---
Fire+coal dust = bad
---
That's why the Steam forums are so salty, you can pull them up while in the game. :)
---
Scoring events [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints).
---
An efficient 4k is low scoring - for the high score you want multiple hooks and a decent amount of chasing.
---
At the end of you next game, look at your emblems - then look at the scoring events to see what you can do to improve. This will better serve you in the long run, at least compared to deliberately playing poorly.
---
I don't understand it at all.
---
If you've never seen stranger things, this chapter is still a new killer, 2 new survivors and a map. Can you imagine if this was not a franchise and people got angry over that?
---
I've only seen season 1 of stranger things and I'm not super invested in it as a show but just having some new stuff is cool IMO. Plus the demogorgon shows that there is now a new model for future killers to look more unique and monstrous.
---
In addition, Netflix working with BHVr is huge! It's a massive surge of popularity and will bring new players in. I also get the feeling that as Netflix has its name on this DLC there will be massive pressure to make it as good as possible - so hopefully the killer and survivors will have at least decent perks and abilities.
---
I'm not sure if it's at every perk slot but there definitely can be two perks available prior to level 25, I just assumed it was every perk slot. Yeah confirming that would be nice
---
Wait; that's illegal!
---
It will for sure be on sale during the Halloween sale on steam :)
---
Lol I'm not salty. I genuinely think it's hilarious that someone can be so bad in God mode that they actually have to camp too.
---
Bullying and ridiculing those killers is always the best. You really make them feel bad about themselves.
---
This is an awesome post.
---
In my opinion rank reset should ONLY happen for the people who actually didn't play for 30 days. If it's the 13th of the month and you haven't played a single killer game, your killer rank should reset. You will be rusty. Same for survivor. But everyone who played during the month should not get smurfed for no reason.
---
New update will bring in so many baby dwights!

Bad luck
---
My idea was that the demigorgon could vault through walls after marking them,  but i do love your interpretation of the upside down. 
---
Like moving around super fast and then making a portal out to attack survivors. Seems fun but maybe a litrle similar to wraith or old Freddy. Yknow having to do something before you can attack Suriviors. But still cool idea man
---
Do all dbd fans know who dead meat is?
---
yeah. I love them both equally but Jonathan/Quentin are quite similar. Steve is a goofball similar to Ash but he still brings something new to the table. and then Nancy is cool because shes like a Nancy Drew-ish characters and we still dont have any meta characters yet
---
If you play killer and walk up to the gate, there's entity blockers (the range where the survs escape if they touch it), the walls of the exit gate area somewhat end there, so don't go pass where the walls end
---
Persevere ! You need to learn how to play the killer around. Learn how to crouch. And don’t get all excited when you hear the heartbeat. Just manage to see where is the killer and hide from him. Don’t run stupidly.
---
It's more like the guy who wrote the script and created the characters wants the 30 years of royalties he's rightfully entitled to since it was his idea in the first place and he was boned out of it by a shady contract.
---
So in other words you want to give Nea a new skin?
---
All I want is to hear a full track of that dbd stranger things mashup.
---
btw the spyware red shell still in the game?
---
She's more directly in the center of this controversy/ law suit than Jason, ironically.
---
They know. They are saying there was never a rule in the first place.
---
Well see that depends on which kind you're talking about. Drones in the series have been notorious for being led around, looped, manipulated, and outsmarted. They're just large insects after all, they're not the smartest. Warriors and Praetorians, they're the ones that fight off colonials, and even then they tend to die in bundles. Plus, it would only be one of them. Xenomorphs are more dangerous when they're in numbers. I see it being totally plausible for one drone to be looped around T-walls, and pallet stunned. Flashlighting them is kinda where immersion breaks, but they're making it work with the demigorgon, so they'd make it work.
---
Join a discord community, it'll be better. Probably. That was my experience with Dark Souls 3 at least.
---
Yup
---
Ohmygosh yes they need to add both alien and predator that would be so cool!
---
btw the spyware red shell still in this game?
---
Bond, Iron Will, Dead Hard, Flip-Flop, Tenacity, Head On, Wake Up, Windows of Opportunity
---
Cahlaflour, boxghost, hybrid panda and no0b3 are pretty charismatic and non toxic but entertaining players tbh. Box and no0b especially are pretty funny.
---
Pretty sure it’s the second row of pillars is the line of the exit
---
But that wouldnt really work if u werent going against the Demogoron
---
Ok then
---
I challenge you to think of perks
---
Yes it is!! :D
---
Cosmetics and bug fixing is handled by different teams, one doesn't mean the other getting ignored. How many times do we need to tell you people this.
---
You do realize OP admits their internet sucks in the original post correct?  Stop trying to turn this into a persecuted witch hunt thing.  He readily admitted his connection sucks which is what caused the survivors to suspect they were cheating with lagswitch which they weren't.
---
Anybody got some information on the perks?
---
&gt;i've been playing this game from day one and in THREE YEARS, I have consistently kept the above opinions
---
3 years of playing, still has trouble going against the Wraith and Doctor. That's impressive.
---
It would allow the killer  to go in to the upside down too then
---
The middle of the pillars on the edge
---
The only aspect of DBD that's scary is the occasional jump scare from like Spirit popping up in your face randomly, or an unexpected hag trap, but that's more of a reflexive response.
---
That isn't correct. He didn't sue for money, he invoked a law (Copyright Act of 1976) that allows the original creator to reclaim their work after 35 years. He isn't going to get money if he wins, he gets control over the original Friday the 13th. Although Horror Inc could have probably resolved this by just paying him fairly.
---
I actually use youtube lol
---
Yeah. Let's compare the Wraith with the Legion:
---
* Both can get first hits easily.
---
* Have a Speed Boost when in power
---
* One is stealth, the other is a Delayer.
---
*Both are M1 killers.
---
*Legion's first hits apply a status effect that delay survivors, but cannot down an injured one. Also reveals close survivors to him*
---
*Wraith's first hits can get an injured survivor off guard and down them.*
---
---------------//-----------------//----------------
---
Now let's compare Legion and Plague:
---
* Both are M1 Killers.
---
* Both powers apply a status effect.
---
* Survivors tend to stay injured with them.
---
*With Plague you get an OP power variation if survivors remove their status effects. With Legion, otherwise, it doesn't happen.*
---
Can we agree the Legion is worse than Plague but better than Wraith? If not, show your points if you want :) or we can just agree to disagree.
---
Yep, the objective look removes the suspense and helps you "acquire the taste", sort of like drinking jack and coke before you learn how to have whiskey neat.
---
Hopefully you can enjoy them now!
---
Its pretty much just a dog that hunts and eats people. It lives in a different dimension but can reach into ours and grab people, but I doubt that will be its power since they made since a point about Freddy 1.0 being unfun for both sides because of that. Its power will probably be agility based.
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap!
---
The pig is one of my favorites! She's very sneaky
---
Didn't they let Neatherrealm use it for Mortal Kombat?
---
Check the roadmap on the dbd website
---
This is gonna get new people to buy the game so probably not since they'd be missing out a tonne of money. Unless you mean a free weekend, which would be a good idea actually.
---
How is 1 not bond?
---
How do I get better at tracking people while using the Spirits ability?
---
Runningman is a great dbd streamer and he does killer requests all the time
---
How about making unranked an entire gamemode.
---
im on xbox and swing chains as well as jump rope both are tremendously and considerably
---
He’s won one fight in the entire show and his face has been a bruised, bloody mess in every season. I love Steve but his track record isn’t great and Dustin knows it.
---
Wait someone doesn’t like strangers things?
---
Stranger Things is chapter 13...rank reset is on the 13th of every month...If stranger things is released on September 13th then it's confirmed.
---
(      Y     )
---
🖐     🖐
---
It's a rarity but it can happen. The issue is the bloodwebs are smaller so there are less nodes for a perk to even appear it. This is just me spitballing but I guess there needs to be a minimum size for 2 perks pre-level 25 or otherwise the bloodweb would just eat itself too quickly.
---
To be honest I thought it was Nathan Fillion at first, but it looks like Chris Evans (Captain America).
---
Whø is thërė
---
* MatchMake based on the SWF's average rank, not based on the SWF's lowest rank.
---
* Have a slight generator repair speed penalty for SWF groups (around 10% for a full group).
---
That's it. Then it will be balanced.
---
Xenomorph: Lonely screeching
---
I hope you have fun with the thicc boi !.I still have fun at rank 8 with nurse so you will defenetly have good games and a lot of fun!
---
Hey there’s no “O” for Hall”O”ween in the second pictu- 
---
Oh.
---
Oh no.
---
The tutorial isn't even correct. The EGC timer is 2 minutes now. Looks like they haven't changed that since the start of the EGC PTB.
---
Pyro always looks like he is full of hate.
---
Well he kinda is lol
---
Thanks man
---
Even Rocky doesn't have a great record, but he is still a badass boxer, so why not Steve it takes huge balls to go fight monsters when your teammate is mostly a 12 year old kid.
---
He's not full of hate, he's full of memes
---
Repossstttt
---
It's good, but the stanger things dbd mashup in the trailer is infinitely better.
---
I don't remember saying that.
---
Then the game would lose the majority of its player base...
---
You're so dumb. Sigh
---
Sure you do.
---
Make meme templates spoilers? Good luck with that, also why have you not watched s3 yet D:
---
5 is tenasscity
---
Doesn’t Disney own the predator? It could be cool but I don’t think Disney would let someone else use it
---
Wait the self admitted camper in left click simulator is calling someone cringe?
---
That's going to be a huge yikes.
---
&gt;and I see them coming towards it
---
Wait you said you were camping waiting for the survivor to show up or to leave. So what is it?
---
Are you lying now to try to justify your shitty game play? Now that is cringe. 
---
At least own up to it if you are going to play like a maladapted mongoloid, how pathetic lol
---
His crotch looks like he has a camel toe and it bothers me more than it should
---
Iron will and DS pls
---
He's not on about that. He's on about the "memes" using photos and videos from season 3. There's tonnes of them on here, each as painfully unfunny as the previous rehashed garbargio.
---
Bites the Dust to reset gens back to 5 if you don’t get s 4K.
---
I’m surprised many other people even remember this still. It makes me happy :^)
---
Or killers could do the same. It’s not hard at all lol it’s just some of you get tunnel vision way too much
---
New canon, light hurts its tongue.
---
You're missing out the fact that windows and pallets mean nothing to legion in his feral frenzy and that even in his power his attacks provide stacks for stbfl. I'd say Plague is strong in her own way but just becomes a slower hitting M1 killer than Legion due to her vomit not stacking stbfl which I think is essential for an m1 killer.
---
Emotes would make the game hilariously more BM, especially for killers.
---
That mall would be a horrible map, almost a gideons 2.0
---
Thank you!! Yes I plan on adding a background but I'm still not sure on what to paint, thank you for the suggestion :)
---
Are there any known plans for new gestures, taunts or emotes coming to the game? This is an untapped money maker that would work for both killers and survivors.
---
Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Iron Will, Bond, Unbreakable (situational), We'll Make It.
---
Notable mentions: Lithe, Sprint Burst, Small Game (situational), Botany Knowledge, Urban Evasion (don't rely on this), Alert.
---
Self Care is a waste of time, use a medkit, Bond, or be comfortable with being injured for long periods of time.
---
Spoilers are never acceptable. Spoilers are the sign of a true diarrhoea drinker.
---
I've been saying this for years and no one thinks that
---
Depends on emote, imo.
---
You can't add something different when perks specifically address hooks. They would need to overhaul the game to cater to those differences and they've passed on that when given the chance. There's a reason league of legends has kept the same foundation despite a decade of updates an advancements. I'm not saying don't change the game, I'm saying don't pander. I get that a stagnant game dies faster than Evolve did, but I don't think it needs said overhaul yet.
---
The face hugger, lore wise, immediately does the egg thing so struggle phases would be.. Weird. Predator just kills shit immediately, but I'll take your word for it. His invisibility and thermal vision might not fit.
---
As far as licenses go, they have impressive ones. All of these are mainstream IPs, not something like Wrong Turn that you'd find premiere on the Sci-fi channel.
---
They're bringing in fanboys because they hopped on a popular series. Yes, some may like the other Killers and be genuinely interested but I promise there will be more than a handful who exclusively come for Stranger Things and exclusively play those characters. Again, I wouldn't care if it fit better.
---
I disagree that this chapter is beneficial to the game as opposed to the company behind it. Ignoring money and player counts, it doesn't make sense to add it from where I'm sitting. It has nothing in common with any other chapters besides 'scary' and I don't see how it builds the game towards something better than it currently is. It seems exclusively designed to pump up sales and player counts and while there's no shame in that on its own, I just disagree with the method imployed.
---
I get it, I'm salty. I don't like the series nor all the posts of people overly hyped like 12 year olds at a beiber concert. I can't stop it, all I can do is complain and hope it goes away quicker than I expect.
---
looks honestly more like Jonathan than Quentin
---
That could work,
---
Or remove the penalty but pair a SWF group against a killer equal to the highest rank of the group? Maybe that would pose a little challenge for them
---
I would love to have a “Point Down” gesture
---
He's not at behaviour anymore?
---
2*
---
Overwatch is probably one of the best arguments against adding in-game voice-comms to DbD.
---
Well now that you say so I can't unsee it sskks i'm gonna erase one of the white lines to correct that
---
Why? You get all the items and perks you could want for free. It would just mean they don't get a boosted rank
---
My god you are just hysterical. Queue up in 10 hours and I'll hopefully get the chance to show you what camping is :)
---
well I can record several games in a row if that somehow helps you. Tho I think there is already enough videos in youtube of decent killers playing LF in higher ranks and making 4K
---
Everyone's brave til Michael increases a tier
---
You know noone forces him to be on this subbreddit its obvious there would be memes on every aspect of stranger things - do you blame crocodile that bit you if you put a hand in its mouth?
---
People are excited and happy - let them be
---
Art.  Upvote granted
---
Maybe I'm wrong but he does NOT deserve 30 years of royalties for a character he did not create. Last time I checked the Jason we all know, you know the masked slasher with a machete, was not created by Miller.
---
I hate this too. My only advice is to leave the gen right after a skill check.
---
The irony. That's how all hex:ruin killers feel. Thanks to all those top tier killers that being overused because of swfs. All comes to the same word.
---
He is but not as a commentator in trailers
---
I am so sorry
---
I cant care in the slightest of the show, the only thing I care about is how dbd will change with the new chapter. And I don't like the precedent of having nonhuman character, whatever the universe is. Right now I would've been against xenomorph as well, despite how much I like the character, because I think its not okay. Of course only time will show if Im right or wrong in my concerns.
---
I will be really exagerrating now, but
---
-hey, lets kill people because they aren't like us!
---
-i think its a bad idea, perhaps we shouldn't
---
-stop bitching, you don't know if you dont try
---
Im afraid this chapter might start moving the game in the wrong direction, and I wouldn't like it since I do care about dbd. There are things you cant undo.
---
Well it would help if you actually looked at him. He was near the top of the screen mostly, you need him to be centered.
---
downvoted just for the tbag
---
Watch them make a one survivor with different sex skins.
---
Well, Alien isn't Predator. While I'm not sure if Disney owns a character who gorily rips skulls and spines from the bodies of their victims, or a character that reproduces in the most brutal form of mouth rape imaginable (actually come to think of it, what doesn't Disney own) I feel like they could potentially buy the rights to the character. Companies have bought the right to use disney characters in their games before.
---
You didnt hit reply so this is a random comment in the wind
---
Oh yeah def. It's one of My favourite horror movies
---
Hey, I'm fine with waiting for the official release. I just want to know what perks they all have, and whether they're good or not.
---
I was just curious seeing how I got mine on ps4 for free months ago. You're right though it will sell a lot of copies
---
BHVR believes a Rank Reset helps with player retention. They're of the mindset that if someone could just get Rank 1 and then stay there forever, they'll be less likely to play. Not that it would be be the sole decision of them playing or not, just a factor.
---
It's a slippery slope.. it would turn into  each, which would ruin the game. Some of the outfits are already quite childish for a horror game.
---
Oh haha sorry, I get those two mixed up a lot despite them being very different. If they could get the rights to either of them I’d be fine with it but not like, hyped about it
---
Removed - Offtopic
---
it still makes me sad Quentin looks like this. I'm not gay (mostly) but the Quentin from the 2010 nightmare on elm street remake honestly looks really attractive and it sucks that he looks like a meth addict here.
---
The apathy people feel towards creators is astounding. If it wasn't for the guy who wrote the first movie, Jason obviously wouldn't exist. That goes for other franchises, creators deserve to be paid well, especially when the concept makes someone else piles of cash.
---
They were 3 completely unrelated screenshots that made no sense, them having the words "Dead" "By" "Daylight" are a big hint, how is that stooping low, it was posted by an official netflix account
---
Apparently that's what the killers are playing in? It seems like he's mad that the killers have more power than the survivors... even though that's the whole game...
---
Removed - Shaming other users &amp; personal drama
---
What does being excited have to do with posting spoilers? You can be excited and post things that don't ruin fun for others. People should be able to visit this sub and not have to worry about having things ruined, it's the dbd sub, not stranger things discussion sub. Be excited, tell people how excited you are, but posting pictures of alexi contributes nothing to the sub.
---
Also I've not seen and quality content that includes spolier clips and photos, just hive mind crap that's painfully unoriginal.
---
Same. I wish he were a better player sometimes. I am not a fan of his hag gameplay, even if I watch each video, and ultimately enjoy the content.
---
Johnathan just looks like a little norman Reedus nothing like Quinton
---
Well, yes, it's a joke of a perk
---
Sound, practice, the bloodhound perk
---
If you can't care in the slightest than dont complain, you are just effortlesly mocking the content and comparing me go a serial killer?
---
 If you care about dbd and complain about new exciting content with a massive influx of new players which corresponds to a massive influx of money for behaviour that will lead to better content for us
---
Then you are just a hipocrite, nothing more, nothing less
---
This made me laugh more than it should have tbh i don't really know how I didn't notice that. But that's it, his camel toe is no more and it's ready to be reposted
---
Yes, but after the survivor is injured, that thing becomes completely useless, and I don't think STBFL is really needed on Plague, with her Corrupt Purge and becoming basically an "instadown" killer with better tracking.
---
I don’t understand why you’re getting so many downvotes for this completely valid opinion.
---
Any good?
---
there is no ranking or matchmaking system in Friday is why it's easier to find matches. Not to mention games can start with under 8 people, unlike DBD where you NEED all 5 players for the game to even start. As well as there being only a single queue, as you can't queue up separately as Jason or as counselor like you can in DBD as killer or survivors.
---
Also Morph, Shift, and Sense have always been in the game, those aren't what made Jason good, in fact he is still largely underpowered and easily bullied to death, like literal death since you can kill him, so he doesn't have "god mode". The semi-recent change of making him invincible to stuns in rage mode is the only broken mechanic about him which is just a band-aid fix to balancing the game that was and still largely is counselor sided, to my knowledge a lot of people aren't a fan of said change but the devs refuse to change it back since they don't know how to properly balance the game.
---
As a fan of puns, take my upvote
---
I've never seen lagswitching! 
---
Playing on internet that gets used by other people and makes the killer lag I suspect is responsible for lag 99x more often than somebody actually using a lag switch.
---
What do you think the ratio of people who share their internet vs people who use a lagswitch are?
---
Not really, since even his own game doesn't have a license for him
---
Big spidery looking thing that watches over everything from the sky and lives in an empty decaying shadow realm? Ya be onto something here.
---
5-Tenacity, op you clever bastard
---
No you don't really need it for plague cos you play them differently and they're both good but there's also the info from the legion finding where people are meaning you can potentially have all of them injured in a matter of seconds.
---
2 days* not a week
---
Many times and it's ok. Just move along :D
---
Puts insidious on bubba*
---
Use your BP boost add-ons every single game. I used to just "not care" but it will add up. Eventually you may want to prestige your first high level killer and you'll still have all these damn add-ons. Trust me, always use them.
---
They added EGC and didn't adjust certain perks so now those perks are useless. I also don't think it's too hard to give new gameplay elements the identify as being a hook. Predator doesn't kill things out right. They've definitely done honorable duels and left people alone. They're in it for the fight. The thermal could be its stalking if wanted or could even be a tracking ability which makes blood easier to see. His invisibility would also fit because, you know.. Wraith.. The facehugger doesnt have to be 100% accurate or they could take their own approach.
---
The Chapter does fit the theme though. The Demogorgon was a killer and just killed and killed. It hunted main characters and was eventually killed. That to me classifies it as a killer.
---
I love you too random redditor, i am a toxic shit for brains so dont give me too much credit
---
I AM SCREAMING! hahahahaha
---
"Bloodpoints aren't an objective"
---
😂😂😂😂

dat pebble doe
---
Entity sound effect number 2
---
Dead by Daylight is actually a demigorgon training montage that occurs before the start of Stranger things. Flowerboi needs to learn how to become a killer by learning from his coworkers.
---
Dont be
---
Exactly, but you cannot DOWN them in a matter of seconds. Looping legion is as easy as looping Wraith, Myers and others. But plague has the corrupt purge as an alternative. Even if survivors don't cleanse that's still an alternative.
---
They would have to have a license to use his name/likeness.
---
Otherwise the game would have been sued and shut down.
---
*boom*
---
I know how you feel man. I said this would happen
---
Sure, PC players will get to see the stuff first, but you’ll have a miserable time doing it lol
---
The bp that it generates can be good, and it is amazing when it does actually activate and survivors trying to mind game you around a walled loop and then just run into you.
---
I've only ever used it on bp generator Legion, but I laughed every time it activated and I got someone with it, but there are definitely better choices.
---
I loved his pronunciation of "death" though (he would always say "debt")
---
Yeah, there's a distinct drop in quality between the Wes Craven and non-Wes films, but Dream Warriors is really Freddy's full potential. There he directly plays people's aspirations and fears against them, even if a couple of times it's just to get in stabbing range.
---
ENDUNRING!!! LOL Nice try tho. 
---
2,3,5,6,7 are correct
---
Yeah, there have been a couple games when I got a pip. I assume that's the thing between the ranks, even though I don't escape. I tend to get about 2 gens done at least, it feels like, though I could be overestimating. Though I really suck at chases, I can't run the killer around, either I get away or I go down. As to the overly altruistic thing, maybe... A lot of our escapes fall apart as we're trying to power up the gates. But if I still have yet to be hooked and there's someone on the hook I figure I can usually try to get them out, but then something stupid usually happens, like Myers gets level 3, or someone has NOED.
---
You're hiding too well. : )
---
Can someone explain the progression system to me? 
---
Not in terms of the blood webs/character levels but rank and player level. What is the purpose of having a higher player level and higher rank? I know you get shards when your player level goes up but that’s all I know about it
---
Why would we have info if they just teased it?
---
PTB next Tuesday probably.
---
it doesnt generate real BP because youre still capped at 8k
---
Hey man, sorry to rain on your parade but if the teaser is out, they're likely in the final stages of finishing him.
---
No idea. But you'll know when you see lagswitching no matter how bad your internet is or how many people you share with. Its thr worst. Though its definetly pretty rare, and 100% rarer than people who share their internet
---
Dischordance
---
All these new players are going to come to this game because of this coming Chapter and it's an indoor map as well. My Myers is going to have a field day. I knew that not playing Killer for 3 months was going to pay off sooner or later
---
The screaming when she gets hit in the face with one indicates otherwise, as rare as that may be
---
I had never heard them so I went looking and I didn’t mind them. He is kind of one note but I enjoy his sumptuous tones.
---
I understand this post is an exaggeration but in what world is Nurse easy to beat?
---
Are you on console?
---
Because Nurse is the almighty GOD on PC. Nurse and Spirit on PC makes pallets useless, loops useless, mindgames useless, etc. They are the only two killers that effectively ignore so many mechanics in the game and make it damn near impossible for survivors to do anything.
---
&gt;I think you should reread the definition you provided because I’m not sure you understood it. 
---
I could say the same.. 
---
&gt;You’re trying to poke holes in Behaviour’s statistics in a way that might make sense on the surface - 80% and 50% are very different, so there’s a problem or the numbers are wrong. But the reasoning given by Behaviour’s data team explains the difference. There isn’t necessarily a problem with the data, but there was a missing piece of information. Anomalies come up in statistical analysis all the time. Understanding the reason for the anomaly is part of the analysis. This is why they tell you to take things with a grain of salt, because there isn’t always a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship between two data points. The fact that they qualify their statistics with that disclaimer tells me that they understand more than most of the people they’re releasing the stats for. 
---
So you think they are a better understanding than people who dedicate their lives on data collection because they say there might be some discrepancy and no one else does that?
---
Y'kno, since you strawman I will do the same
---
&gt;Behaviour doesn’t need to be a government think tank to release stats. If they have a data team, their data analysts likely studied mathematics and statistics. Many businesses have qualified data analysts, that’s part of how they make business decisions.
---
Never said that they need a government kind of thing but at least someone who have a more clear idea about data collection. Plus that's what you say while the level designer was a waiter.. I'm sorry if I don't trust them that much about it, especially based on what they say in stream, which in many cases are wrong or show how little they test their game
---
Look, I love this game and I criticize it so much because of that. I wanna see it grow and improve, something that's happening even if slowly. Still, not trusting their data doesn't mean I think to be better than them, something you think I do even if I never stated that but whatever, not everyone use their brain and prefer defend their bias seeing every criticize as a personal attack if it's about something they like.
---
I rather criticize what I love and challenge it, be skeptical of companies since they exist for one reason alone, and isn't provide a good service if you're in doubt. Just look their reaction over steam review bombing, just that would clarify what I mean.
---
So in conclusion, I don't trust their data period, not for a long time after they showed several times numerous mistakes in this department.
---
You won't convince me by telling me that I have a Dennis Kruger effect when I just don't trust them since, you should read again, I don't think to be superior or that my abilities are far superior with my great superior cognitive ability falling in an illusionary superiority. I never stated anything about having superior shit, I just stated my skepticism towards a company that only goal is to sell, that's it. Especially after an history of mistakes, so I just stopped caring about what they say about stats and more interested about their plan for the future.
---
It's totally fine in my opinion to have these thoughts while you, thinking to be superior to me, wanna convince me how wrong I am for not trusting this company due to.. wait for it.. your cognitive bias of illusionary superiority and comes from people to recognize their lack of ability. Sounds familiar?
---
Good, so instead of telling me how I'm wrong because, reasons, since you don't have facts but feels, you have no idea who works there and how they work or even the methodology they use for their stats, you still tell me I should accept that to face value. No my dear, you have no idea in the first place who they are neither who I am so telling me how little I know without having a clue of what I or they do is a feel based argument. I'm sorry but I don't care what your feels tells you or if they get hurt. I prefer facts and as far as I can see, I haven't read any coming out from you.
---
Tl:Dr: not trusting a company doesn't mean you feel superior than them. I don't trust their data for flaws they had in past datas.
---
Today I played as a slugging ghostface with knock out, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear the survivors say in the post game chat that it was a tense and genuinely scary game for them. Good to see this game can still be scary without jumpscares.
---
I think they mean the Doc goes in planning to let four generators get completed and just defend three when there is one left, making it difficult to complete the last one without coordinator between survivors.
---
Coming from a guy in the MK community, I never got those videos at all, it always seemed weird to me like... some weird fetish stuff.
---
Well it doesnt have eyes now does it.
---
I thought the trapper was supposed to be DBD's version of Jason? Or was that just a theory?
---
We really out here playing horror movie smash bros
---
You are giving a seriusly big urges to mori you in real life.
---
Wait I’m doing this right now
---
Its funny how now when people spam twitch or discord things people who call them out will be downvoted for being dicks. I foresaw all of this.
---
[Know your scoring events](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints).
---
Hag gets points from traps being set, and traps being triggered. She gets points for teleporting to a trap and getting a hit.
---
You can boost this further by using perks, add-ons, and offerings that improve the rate at which you gain score in each category. In Hag's case you probably want a range add-on and a setting speed add-on, as this combo will make it more likely that a trap is triggered (since you can set them faster in loops) *and* that you will get a hit out of it (because you can travel further).
---
You can boost this further still by using the Leatherface/Cannibal perk Barbecue &amp; Chilli, which increases the values postgame.
---
Note that if you don't already have Leatherface then you'll need to factor in his own progression to L35 - if you're lucky then the personal version will come up early in his grind so that he's making BP at a very high rate.
---
Well miners use shafts to get between levels do maybe a teleport mechanic with lockers? 
---
We could also use darkness as a main theme - i would love a sudden change of gameplay that the survivors would have to use a shoulder lights just because they are facing this killer so the map is so dark but the killer has adapted to the darkness (just like the human eyes adapt) but that could be too gamebreaking
---
I also liked the idea of being flashed by the killer just like the other thread said- with the dead hard meta not going away this could be a fun gameplay addition
---
I vore gens all the time and I am not even a demogorgon.
---
A fucking flower.
---
Thats what I just said. infectious fright, while it is an extremely good perk on myers, is only "okay" on other killers.
---
EVERYONE IS HERE!
---
And we have a rank reset just before this goes live. With this matchmaking its actually gonna be the biggest shit fest for solo survivors :)
---
Stop spamming it seriously. Oversaturated content is against this subreddit’s rules.
---
The Alien rights were still over at 20th Century in 2015
---
No but you can get 15k in a 5 minute gen rush with Legion with distressing and beast of prey giving you like 2k points per hit with power.
---
I can see the Mori. Pickexe to the face followed by heart removal and placing it in a little heart shaped box. 
---
Imagine coming across that scene as another survivor lol
---
It’s a joke
---
Really nice but I think the pink is a little brighter than neas wig. Could just be the lighting or me being a big stupid dumb dumb but overall nice cosplay
---
Every time my girlfriend starts watching Netflix, some survivors start lagging. I used to get angry messages about it until I turned off messages lol.
---
Whenever I start lagging as survivor I just realize that residential internet bandwidth simply isn't stable.
---
The weapon will probably be their hand, like with hag. And I am pretty sure we won't get additional cosmetics for the Demogorgon apart from he prestiged items.
---
I've wanted my bloody valentine for awhile now
---
Oh no it's bad. My shameful secret is I still haven't gotten it to proc a single time. But much like flip flop, I'm going to keep trying until I can proc it at least once.
---
i mean they couldn't have made a killer as well designed as Spirit if they didn't have money. so no one is losing here
---
Lol whoah boy.  In red ranks immersed garbage perks like Urban get teamates killed they encourage a scared immersed playstyle that slows the objectives cobsiderably.  Are you a rank 1 survivor and killer because your perk list screams mid ranks this has a high green low purple feel to it.
---
Holding m2 changes the speed, rather than the distance. It’s kinda weird
---
No way dud I’m soo hyped esketit
---
Best licensed killer right...
---
He is not powerful at all. Fanfics do the same thing and they don't require money to do it.
---
Yeah! I legit think it’s a running joke in the show for him to get his ass kicked, and it has looked the same every season.
---
You should've sent this reaction to the guy you got :) that would've been epic
---
I see someone also enjoys a bit of kill count
---
It's already tiring to see this sub turn into a Stranger Things circlejerk.
---
child actors, campy "80's" tropes, cringey plot, lack of character development, I found nothing about the show tolerable, let alone enjoyable.   
---
I'm excited for an influx of player, but not for all of the wrong reasons. low quality subscriber-based television found its way into DbD, and the only reason is money. sad.
---
What are you talking about, Doritos crash course is SSS grade
---
Because of an already established game and the licensing issues... which is why he isn’t in here already which clearly 30+ people don’t realize.
---
He did that in the video.
---
But to get all 3 you would spend 3x 2700 shards, while the character can be bought for 9000. So that only saves you 10%, while not getting the character even
---
That's why 2 survivors, to make up for the lack of cosmetics
---
Nah it is ... I couldn’t find the right color this was the closest I could get :/
---
They are committed to improving communication, which likely means emotes. 
---
No one can say if that means they'll include taunts (could go either way, depending on how they feel about some of the community's thoughs on teabagging) or whether there'll be enough empty space in the emote system for "non-essential" ones.
---
I’m gonna go with no since people have been asking for a finger gun emote for Ace for years and they’ve never obliged.
---
It's not that there is a pocket dimension, just that the Entity is completely invincible and irresistable, with every Hunter just living to serve it now. We'll say every original Killer can be willing to serve it for free, and even that Freddy is willing to make deals and Leatherface is easily dominated, but Michael is either beholden to no force or already has a patron entity, and Amanda supposedly kills for a purpose, despite it being totally meaningless in the fog.
---
There's also just the suggestion that Ash is trapped forever, which doesn't exactly jive with canon, unless they have an event or lore item where characters supposedly DO escape.
---
The first one is predator
---
They said in a recent AMA that they have no plans for another game mode and wanna focus on the main game
---
Way to miss the obvious reference 😑
---
meta-solution, develop your own game so you can have a reddit for it and moderate it yourself
---
you mean the thing that's populated for like 1-2 days of people excited to try out the new characters. Then afterwords it's just people spamming their strongest builds of insta-heals, Mori's, keys, UR and VR add-ons, and people DCing 10x more than normal since nothing matters in the PTB?
---
Nah, I'm happy with watching streamers/youtubers play it, otherwise I know I'm not missing much.
---
You are a genius. I could use this. Thank you
---
DeviB is a really fun streamer.
---
*laughs in wolfman*
---
You need to change in steam game settings, its not available now
---
We already got a lot of knifed killers
---
But based on what you said they didn't hook rush at all
---
He just isn't that good when you get to better ranks facing atleast meh survivors as he doesn't have great pressure with generators only chase.

What in the world would the perks be for these guys?

Idk why but the cutoff scream got a dumbass giggle outta me
---
Remember when Friday the 13th was going to kill Dead by Daylight? Lol
---
Ooooh that need to comment on someone's lack of knowledge of Reddit formatting made me physically cringe
---
That Steve render gives me big ol tell tale vibes same with the others. But yea all everyone's gonna see is Steve hell I think Steves more hyped then the damn killer which I can't blame them honestly.
---
In the PTB does everything revert to how it was before you entered the PTB after it ends? So if you spend bloodpoints on the new characters it reverts after the PTB is over or something like that.
---
What is the difference between the colors of my perks? I have a level 2 perk that has a purple icon and a level 3 one that's still green. In this game it seems to go brown&gt;yellow&gt;green&gt;purple&gt;pink so why is my lower level perk a "worse" color?
---
Quoted bloodpoint?

This is just cute and hilarious xD Sounds like alot of fun
---
Myers with scratched mirror and monitor begs to differ
---
Correct, you’re not, because that’s *exactly* how urethras work
---
Well considering the gorgon we got in the trailer is pale and pinkish I definitely feel that's going to be a alternative outfit maybe for buying the whole chapter? Weapon is probably it's Hand.
---
If both were complete beginners at the game, then yes, I agree. But that’s usually not the case. Noob killers get faced with plenty of experienced survivors who either deranked on purpose or just don’t play that much and deranked naturally. These deranked guys can even team up with their actually high ranked friends and still  somehow end up in a beginner killers lobby. Matchmaking is not perfect in case your delusional ass didn’t notice. 
---
Oh, and I played 100% survivor for a year up until now when I recently switched it up a bit. None of the crap I experienced playing survivor was never as frustrating and demotivating as it is getting bullied by obviously deranked survivors.
---
Rekindled Intensifies
---
You said sorry but I feel like you don’t actually mean that
---
Gotcha. But it's still a possibility that Disney would let BHVR use Alien. At least they're not as stubborn and difficult as Konami (r.i.p my boi Pyramid Head)
---
Mask doesn't quite match up but its close enough,  don't forget the neck thing and the gloves with the black fingernails. Thats jacket shirt combo will be a nightmare to make
---
See, but it's one sided. New players almost always face camp and tunnel. The only way to win is using your skills to loop and mind game then which still means you're going to have to bully them.
---
With Freddy’s new Warp maybe they were testing a way to move around the map as an M 1 killer.
---
I remember getting tombstoned on my third ever game of survivor by a smurf, instead of reporting him or getting salty I just googled if that was possible. There’s so many different things that new players won’t know about simply because they’re rare
---
When the PTB is out:
---
* Right click Dead by Daylight in your Steam library.
---
* Select Properties
---
* Select Betas
---
* Choose the public-test-build option under "Select the beta you would like to opt into".
---
* Wait for it to install.
---
PTBs are Steam only so if you are on console, sorry :(
---
Wouldve been perfect with one or two stray Nancys hidden.
---
Is the new meta gonna be to main Steve so the killer can't kill you?
---
He's literally just thinking of what it could be not saying what it should be..
---
Billy has speed and Bubba hits more than 1 person.
---
It's strategic to do so on a game by game basis and with what information you hold.
---
While yes the game forces you to tunnel in certain situations (Basically you've got like 2-3 gens left, ruin is destroyed and you ideally need a person dead to stand a chance at getting more kills) as well as slug (When there's 2 survivors left and you want neither to escape), survivors pretty much always cause you to camp (Like when you know all survivors are near the hook, you're obviously not gonna leave).
---
They are the general times when you'll do these "Degenerate" strategies. But it's a game by game basis so I can't outline everything.
---
Please know that if you don't Tunnel, Camp or Slug you will never ever get a 4k consistently unless you play Nurse or Spirit. This is survivor rules book BS and you are not obligated to abide by it. Your task is to kill all survivors, how you do so is up to you.
---
While yes I dislike it when I am tunneled or slugged at points, I understand why I am, especially if the Killer plays what the community of survivors feel is "Fair" up to that point. But I'm also good enough to lose Killers so when I am supposedly "Tunneled" I can get away, the problem is when people don't get away is when they complain.
---
I was playing my daily with a level one trapper last night. The whole match I got two hooks and teabagged. While i was chasing someone, they did the last gen. While i hooked, they opened the gate, so I stayed with my hook. All three of them come over to hook save. I end up with a 3k and they send me hate mail. Why send me hate mail because you lemmings want to line up to die?
---
Survivors think that you are obligated to wander off across the map when someone is hooked. If the game is almost over, I'm using my literal bait on a hook to see what I can catch
---
The speculation that most people have been giving is that since the trailer showed both Survivors as separate characters they probably are separate characters.  
---
Legion wasn't shown as "New Killer: Frank Morris" "New Killer: Julie" "New Killer: Susie" "New Killer: Joey" but rather just "New Killer: The Legion."  
---
Likewise they wouldn't show "New Survivor: Nancy Wheeler" "New Survivor: Steve Harrington" and would instead show "New Survivor: Nancy/Steve" if they were the same character.
---
I think if they are the same Survivor Behavior could potentially get in trouble for false advertising, so that leads me to think they're two Survivors.
---
I was going to do that tbh but I forgot. Ah well.
---
Is it someone new?

Slug when you need to slow down the game, dont tunnel and DS isnt a problem, camp if exit gates are open but dont be suprised at red ranks when the bum rush the hook and everyone has borrowed, after hooking someone sure proxy for like 15 to 20 sec and then go gen to gen, and pretty much the rest is self taught.
---
There have been times where that extra second of having to open a 99% gate has gotten me killed, that said, it usually helps more than it screws me over
---
Spookyrice is great youtuber tho but films he sum up well.... he sumed up serbian film and canibal holocoust
---
On consoles the wait is real. It was so bad last night I had to give up and switch to PC. However on PC as a survivor, I can still find matches in NA in a few seconds.
---
Survivors love to rush the hook before you can even walk away and then call you a camper. I'm not a camper. You are just stupid
---
I SeE WhAT You DiD ThERe 😂
---
He's also slower, cannot gain bloodlust and cannot progress past tier 1. Most Michael players combo the Scratched Mirror with Monitor &amp; Abuse that puts his terror radius at 0. 
---
Scratched Mirror only works really well in the indoor maps like Lerys or the Game where there are lots of places to jump out from. Once you get the first hit, you can pretend to lose the chase, stalk them through walls and then pop out from behind a corner to get the second hit. Chasing through the corn or an open map with a perma-tier 1, no bloodlust Myers doesn't work nearly as well as sneaking through corridors.
---
Ghostface made it so that there were 16 Killers and 17 Survivors. The Stranger Things chapter will equal 17 Killers and 19 Survivors.
---
I mean even from Day 1 there were 4 unique Survivors and only 3 Killers...
---
I've been thinking the same thing, otzdarva actually comes up with nice new builds and tries to make all killers viable, but people like umbra outright refuse to play on bad maps and only plays good killers. She's an amazing huntress but it's kinda off-putting when you consider what she does
---
It was his mother's fault, she told him to do his own game.
---
I hope you've never complained about a meal you've eaten unless you're a Chef who owns a 5 star restaurant
---
I hope you've never complained about any movie you've watched unless you're a director with multiple academy awards to your name
---
I hope you've never complained about being in a laggy lobby unless you've also created your own game and can go play it.
---
Because then you'd just be a lazy hypocrite otherwise.
---
Yeah I got the necklace already I was wearing it on my stream last night. I do already have the gauntlets too !! :3
---
Four is Play with your Food
---
&gt; I start looking for survivors I thought I saw somekne nearby so I look around, after some timeI give up and check the newrby hook again to see if anyone is there. The survivor was close to struggle so I just stayed in front of him to guarantee he gets toit. Then a survivor rushes so I hit him then hit him again
---
This is in no way hook rushing. You were wrong about seeing someone, and even after realizing it just sat there and camped and someone came in for a desperate save because sitting on gens just because a killer is camping sucks
---
This is like people who hook someone in the basement and then checks all the lockers downstairs and all the lockers upstairs twice and say "not camping lol looking for survivors"
---
Ah yes ghostface... the costume, registered trademark at Fun World division!
---
Why do you “facts over feels” people always have the least logical and most subjective arguments? You’ve continuously misread my comments, repeatedly tried to insult me before I stooped to your level, and made no attempt whatsoever to give me a reason why the “less than 50% survival rate” statistic is untrustworthy other than because you feel like it is and because their level design guy was a waiter I guess?
---
I don’t think I’m superior to you. I know that I know more about data analysis than you because it’s my full time job and because you’ve repeatedly shown that you don’t understand what you’re taking about. 
---
I’ve already wasted too much of my time on this pointless argument that isn’t going anywhere so I won’t be replying anymore. Enjoy the rest of your day.
---
I wish all the killers got survivors and vice versa
---
Pebble op
---
Word
---
Sweet kinda get a feeling of how demigorgon is gonna work
---
so is piggy and legion.
---
Well to be fair you admitted to camping their hooks.  
---
But if they really did tell you to kill yourself in a message, you can and should report them for the message.  They'll get atleast a 24 hour comms ban, no one should tell someone else to commit suicide because their salty over a video game.
---
Good job!
---
OH MY GOD DID HE JUST CROUCH UP AND DOWN IN A VIDEO GAME.
---
Yup! This september+
---
I think the Demogorgon will teleport using these holes and the survivors will be able to destroy the exits, which sucks cause it seems there will be no "upside down" version of the maps.
---
I’m on pc and I usually just watch Puppers. I’m not into self torture.

Am I missing something about this description that should be getting attention? Seems like a pretty straight forward description.
---
The demogorgon seems shorter then I expected honestly really hope he can just stand straight up making him look absolutely terrifying.
---
IDK about that. We got two chainsaw-wielding nutjobs from down south (the Hillbilly and Leatherface) so two clowns don't seem that much of a stretch, really the only downside to Pennywise being in DBD is how will he work?
---
That wasn't really the point of my post tbh. As a Killer main you should know what i mean. Sometimes even if none of the survivors can loop you around for very long, you still end up losing.
---
Any time I read "I'm gay", it's always in iDubbbz's voice now
---
lmao at #3
---
If I am close by when someone is unhooked and I'm not already in a chase I'm going for the one that's down in one hit and them getting the other, it's just easier to find an injured survivor 9/10 times
---
Yep. My idea is that it slowly fades to extremely background music. My editing skills just weren’t on par to slowly make it fade out.
---
*Demigorgon oofs*
---
Exactly. It happens just learn to play better. I'm telling you this chapter is just gonna bring more campers and potatoes.
---
Looks great, thanks for posting! Where are these screenshots from?
---
Hag traps get me because... no one ever plays hag.
---
I think it's important to remember too that some "toxic" behaviours are only understood as toxic once you immerse yourself into the community. For example, camping killers are toxic but I remember as a newbie to the game, I didn't understand that. In my mind, if my goal is to kill everyone, the best strategy was to camp or be very close to the hooked survivor so I can get two survivors in one hit. It wasn't until I played survivor and got immersed in the community that I realized while camping gets to the goal of killing everyone, it kills the joy of the game.
---
So on top of not being toxic players, let's not be a dick in post-chat if someone doesn't play right either.
---
lol I thought 2 was ‘metal’ of man at first. I got the rest though
---
You can try slugging the second to last survivor and then looking for the last one, and then hooking them both.   
---
Ton of things can go wrong on the way but it can also help you  - sort of like high risk high reward scenario.
---
Been playing since 1 month after pc launch. Rank 1 killer since 2 years ago, rank 6 survivor (as far as I've gotten, don't play much survivor as I play solo and randoms suck). If I were to focus on just playing survivor I think I could reach red ranks but having to rely on 3 randoms isn't fun at all. I don't have that much time to play dbd so I usually just do killer. The perks I mentioned are perks I use often myself when playing and imo they never disappoint.
---
While every seperate killer has their meta perks that work good for them, build variety per killer isn't that great when it comes to red ranks imo. Yes "technically" more killer perks are viable due to each killer having different playstyles but if you were to put 1 singular killer's viable perks vs a survivor's viable perks killer would have less.
---
Spirit Fury isn't OP, you have to combo it with Enduring for it to be powerful and even then that's half your build to ignore every third pallet stun my dude.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel, Monitor and Abuse and Head On would all be nice.
---
Holy shit this looks amazing. Where did you get them from?
---
Piggy Has reverse bear traps and legion... 
---
We dont talk about legion
---
I always have this.. if i use a simple build to play against low ranks in rank reset i get owned by purple to red ranks.
---
But if i use a op build, like tuft of hair myers/mirror myers i get low ranks and feel bad 😢
---
Right but the different survivors are really just skins that come with three perks where killers are fundamentally different
---
Where the stone tiles end and it transitions into mud/grass.
---
&gt;What is the purpose of having a higher player level and higher rank?
---
Very good question, we have been asking these exact questions to the devs for a while now.
---
Hey, 3 of my favorite yt channels, dbd, wow such gaming and Dead meat.
---
It depends on the game 99% a gate can kill a lot of people especially against instadown killers.
---
What perks were you using on your wraith?
---
*Hot
---
They better have the voice actors be the actors like with ash, except don’t make them look like a potato like they did ash
---
This is pretty lit Dab Fam, lit
---
Dear god I have this shit with Ghostface. Every. Damn. Time. Think he ran off? Think again, he’s actually crouching around the corner waiting for your ass, that heartbeat ain’t shit.
---
Yep. They all acted like new players, i let dwight the hatch coz he was addoroble.
---
I meant I *didnt*. Autocorrect

Not any new guns, that’s for sure

---
Always happens to me when I go off the gen to switch my Toolbox repair to normal repair.
---
Ahh, my bad
---
All in the game man, all in the game.
---
Take a deep breath, you can’t win ‘em all.
---
I'm pretty sure they said he'd be nothing like old Freddy which means no pulling people into another realm from my understanding.
---
Only if it’s from shirtless Myers my guy
---

---
I used to watch Fungoose a lot, for his critical thinking and great running commentary, but the more I watched him, the more he comes off as a bit of an arrogant jerk, especially to his girlfriend/fiance. I get the impression that he doesn't like it when people try to point things out to him on stream.
---
I could see it working out like a bunch of interiors for the gas station almost but yeah i think it would be a killer sided map regardless
---
yea id drop everything on predator
---
its a fun build i saw a streamer use. It had the quick purple repear addon, as well as the quick action while cloaked addon. Combined with brutal strenght/enduring. So i could break pallets or vault windows insanely fast.
---
So they’re not supposed to hook rush, but then they’re “greedy” for leaving? Hmm.
---
Just keep practising. The better you get, the less you’ll need to camp and the less salt you’ll get.
---
That’s true

Honestly it kinda looks like Hags Mori considering the angle the gorgon is ag

#About This Game
---
STRANGER THINGS is a brand-new Chapter for Dead by Daylight that features a
---
new Killer and two new Survivors. The Entity descends upon the midwestern town
---
of Hawkins, Indiana as Stranger Things, the critically acclaimed Netflix
---
Original Series, enters the realm of Dead by Daylight.  
---
The Stranger Things Chapter includes a new map, the Underground Complex,
---
located below the Hawkins National Laboratory. A Demogorgon is the new
---
untamable Killer. Against the Demogorgon stands not one, but two new
---
Survivors: Nancy Wheeler, a tough aspiring journalist, and Steve Harrington, a
---
former high school jock with a knack for finding trouble. The Stranger Things
---
Chapter also features two exclusive cosmetic items: Steve’s Scuffed Rolled
---
Sleeves and Nancy’s Torn Sweatshirt.
---
Even if it was dumb luck it’s an amazing start, you’re on your way to the top! Windows of Opportunity is a good perk for beginning when you don’t know the maps very well, good choice. When you feel comfortable enough you should take it off though, the perk slot could be used by something more useful. I’d also recommend an Exhaustion perk, preferably either Balanced Landing or Dead Hard. I prefer Balanced, but Dead Hard is more versatile. Both will help you extend the chase out longer and save your ass. I like Balanced because it can open up opportunities to loop at places with drops that are otherwise unusable.
---
If you’re feeling really, REALLY ballsy you could try out the perk Object of Obsession. It allows you to see where the Killer is, but he can also see you at the same time. Most likely he’ll be following you around all game because he knows where you are whenever you look in his direction, but if you want to get chased that’s a good way to do it.
---
Gosh, I really hope the gates aren't just for teleporting then so we have another Killer who has nothing to help in the chase. Hopefully he has a secondary power at least if that's the case.
---
FUCK no. Survivors already have to hold m1 for 80 seconds to do a gen. They should NOT increase gen times. What they need to do is add other dynamic objectives that survivors need to do in order to escape instead of gens.
---
The summary of this wall of text i wrote isn't "please nerf spirit fury". I am aware its balanced. But i feel like there is a lot of efforts from them to make chases shorter which i think is the wrong direction.
---
Dunno, but im sure the mori is absolutely gorgeous.
---
Them telling you to KYS is extremely rude but don't get mad or be surprised when you camp and they call you out for being a camper
---
"I'mma flower head."
---
"I eats you now."
---
"Nom Nom Nom Nom SCREEEEEEEE"
---
It's really weird. The ones on the women seem to be the most popular. It's definitely fetish.
---
Alright this was pretty good
---
Are these mobile screenshots? Look at the survivors' faces lol. They could've done a better job selecting the screenshots.
---
Thats why the wraith is bottom tier killer. Also I'm a survivor main thanks. There is only 3 OP builds and the belong to only 2 killers. So no.
---
Dead Meat ftw!
---
Oh yea that's a good idea too. Like a second objective in addition to gens.
---
Slap
---
Well the perk is shit. My point still stands.
---
Watch YouTube videos and learn through those. I still get incapacitated quickly with certain killers but knowing how to see them coming works as well. Some perks like spine chill could let you stay in the game a bit longer maybe if you can see the killer coming?
---
Get out while you still can, the rabbit hole runs deep
---
The developers choose the pictures steam didn't "leak" anything.
---
друr
---
i feel really bad when i was doing that to killers at rank 20 because i took a 3 month break
---
Yea I feel he'll be able to make them quickly and maybe he could set them up on walls allowing him for some mindgames still looks good just a little lackluster but this is what I wanted kinda as it seems he'll be able to start chases fast considering the ability to teleport
---
That's not OP at all.   There's no point in combining brutal strength with enduring when the combo is enduring and spirit fury.    
---
Try something like BBQ, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Ruin, or BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, Franklin's Demise / Sloppy butcher.  
---
The action speed add ons while cloak are alright but I prefer Purple All Seeing, and Purple Windstorm.  Use the windstorm add on to get to the window/pallet before the survivor and body block their interaction, use the All seeing add on to see how they react while you block the loop.  You can use this to mind game the speed boost effect when you come out of invisibility to guarantee a hit.
---
I think what I'm most impressed with was that my initial fear, when the Hallowen chapter came out, hasn't come to be.  I was convinced there would be issue with when licenses expire - that we'd have to see a patch update with the skins swapped for something license free eventually - but we've been fortunate.
---
Thanks for letting me know that, it's something I'll be sure to keep an eye out for.
---
That's a good kill count
---
BHVR: uh.. Horror... Yes yes that's us, totally horror... Not a running in circle simulation at all, we promise.
---
You gotta just play more. Learn tendencies and habits. All the top tier players juat have time in so we know what they'll try to do.
---
Well everyone had its methods. Mine is to crouch and stay hidden. Even very close to the killer. Sometimes it doesn’t work hehe. That’s a nice tip: don’t be afraid of losing. It happens many times
---
*laughs in PC*

Maybe then it won't take 15 minutes to get a lobby.

Slugging is a means to give the survivors another objective

I hope that the power of DEMOR is NOT ONLY "Tps" I hope it is more complete with in the series and there is something of the world updown

id put freddy in front of myers too tbh
---
Just killer things am I right?
---
Well they prob used her base skeleton and animations for it since she’s the closest to it
---
i hate you... quality shitpost, take my upvote
---
It's not a fucking leak even. The whole chapter was added to the steam store. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135280/Dead_by_Daylight__STRANGER_THINGS_Chapter/
---
Nice! 👍
---
Don't make me cry D:
---
Yea but I like Moris that are really different in their animations. Either way it looks solid enough but Ghostfaces still holds the top for best Mori until I see the Mori fully instead of 1 picture
---
::bows head solemnly:: 
---
"as the entity wills it"
---
Missed opportunity to say ''we don't want to hex ruin their experience right off the bat.''
---
On the PS4 and around 10:30pm, is the worst time to find matches unless I'm the killer.  In an hour, I'll barely get to do my first survivor and first killer match, and then a third one to try for the third daily.  So I'll try to charge my phone but then while in the lobby, I have to go to where my phone is charging to browse reddit.
---
Or I play my other favorite game of looking at people's trophy lists and being inspired to play those other games they are or have played recently. Especially when I see we have the same number of trophies in a game and then I want to see if they are the same ones or not.  
---
That's what got me playing GTA V, Friday the 13th, Apex Legends, and Warfare.
---
Go look up bricky. He's probably the best doc.
---
There is alot of 8 year olds on console, just sayin if they want to hook dive thats on them
---
It used to take me seconds to get a lobby as killer, then it took 30 seconds, and now it takes over 5 minutes which is absolutely ridiculous and the reason I haven't been playing this game at all lately. I'm not about to wait a long ass time for toxicity.
---
What u mean ?
---
I hope survivors don’t control its power like it is with the plague.  That would really be unfortunate.  But these pics looks really well done.
---
I wonder how long youve terrorized social media with that
---
It's pretty much the guilty pleasure/ secret main energy of this game. It starts as a horror game then turns into balancing being skilled and being the biggest piece of shit you can be
---
The game itself is hard to balance because there's such a huge difference between the casual immersed players who play the game like it's hide and seek (is that a distant heartbeat?  I better go to the corner of the map instead of working the generator) and then the serious players who do the generators as fast as possible.   
---
And making chases shorter is where the game design is headed, look at the rework to exhaustion perks that rolled out around the clown release, look at the new variations of haddonfield.
---
Well, you know what, I think it's time we removed survivors from this game and make it 1v1v1v1v1 killers
---
yeah i play survivor around rank 3 or 4 and any time i see a clown i shit myself cuz i know i'm about to get clapped lol as far as i'm concerned clown is one of the best killers. i'd take a good nurse over a good clown any day if i'm being honest. at least there's ways for me to outplay a nurse. if a clown is chasing me, i just die lol
---
Think they will ever change rank re-set or make it less frequent? My and some buds were slayed by someone who has played 8,000 hours of DBD yesterday and it was horrific.
---
I thought 2 was "drill will" and now I can't stop laughing.
---
Im grateful for it being on game pass, ive gotten several friends in on it now, its always just been me and randoms otherwise
---
I dont have an opinion since this just shows the clip after the last hook. You gotta show more evidence.
---
Aww thanks, I'll give him a watch.  Appreciate it.
---
Would be the dumbest possible killer choice possible, it would require taking some huge creativity liberties to fit in the game that would defeat the point of having the Xenomorph in the game.
---
Without absurd editing the Xenomorph would be the fastest, strongest, deadliest killer in the game.  It would be so ridiculously detached from it's concept the devs would do better just making up their own alien killer.
---
Why should discordance be kept at level 1? Also what about those perks I find in the bloodweb at any level? (The ones i dont need to lvl a specific survivor for)
---
Im sorry, im new and everything is very confusing atm haha
---
Ah piss of mate. You are fucking annoying with your negativity. Play a different game if you don't like DbD
---
He isn't a terrible killer, but BBQ never comes in the shrine
---
I'm not happy about this, this may be the last straw for me gamers, love this community to death though ✊
---
It's not a leak.
---
BHVR decide what pictures go up and when the store page goes up, it's not a leak.
---
You know what, I'm actually gonna give Beast of prey a try and see how it goes.
---
Called it.
---
Gamepass sure puts in work
---
He's mid tier at best. Any half decent team of survivors will simply make his power useless, essentially making him a basic M1 killer.
---
Nice, I don't follow cosplayers in general (I know a dota 2 one) but I'll keep an eye out for the finished product
---
you really are a special kind of dickweed aren't ya?
---
His perk def is worth it. Lucky enough for me that when I got the game a few months ago, it was in the shrine. I'm not sure how long it'll be until it's in there again.
---
I don’t have any criticism for you because you basically crushed those potatoes but I did lol at all the locker shenanigans. I don’t think they realize just how loud the lockers are and how much killers rely on sound.
---
Mid to bottom tier, Anti bum rush ability, instadown, 115 speed and cool mori. Yeah i say he's worth it.
---
This can’t be more true.
---
There’s entire alien games
---
Source ?
---
One of the best in the game. He's a bonafide serial killer so it fits.
---
You can see his finger-keychain on all his cosmetics.
---
i thought number 3 was my hero academia for a sec xD
---
Nah he's onetricking Lucio on Overwatch
---
If you're curious, u/Luvalesc, the logic behind not upgrading Discordance is that the lower the level, the shorter the highlighted period - which means the greater the chance that the people working on it are *still* working on it.
---
At the highest level the generator will remain highlighted for 12 seconds, and unless you're watching it like a hawk then you'll never be certain as to whether they've just started working on it or whether they tapped it and ran.
---
I could ask you the same fucking thing about yours.
---
&gt; devs said they want to implement solo gameplay to be more like swf 
---
Source?
---
I've never once seen them support the idea of SWF. Let alone think that its the more healthy game play. Most of this game is designed around solo play.
---
Thanks I really appreciate it :)
---
It's only popped up twice since they released bubba, and in addition to BBQ you get franklin's demise which is a must have anytime you see more than 2 items in your lobby.
---
Then you get a pass
---
The steam page for the stranger things dlc
---
To be honest, that's what's made me so much better.  I'm slowly managing to isolate sounds and track with sound.  I've found myself weirdly not using sound more than vision haha.
---
At the very least, don’t teabag or bm in anyway. It really ruins the game...
---
?
---
OP said Steam. Go to the DLC for Dead by Daylight and you will see the Stranger Things chapter.
---
You can see his eyes on his in game model if you get close enough
---
First your perks are questionnable. No ruins is playing the game on hard mode for sure. I'd ditch monitor and abuse and get ruins instead. Other perks are ok at low ranks but they will lose value as you move up.
---
I am not a fan of your green addon since it makes charge time too long. I'd with with no range addon or brown one.
---
I also noticed you are missing a lot of shocks. Don't try to shock from far away for no reasons. You usually shock when you predict he wants to use a pallet or a window soon.
---
at 4:30 u found a survivor, injured her, but then instead of breaking pallet u should have chased her. if she choose to go back to pallet just shock her and kill.
---
5:25 amazing shock and u caught them off guard and could easily have gotten free hit, but u choose to kick gen instead and shock the air losing them all.
---
What build you use for myers use for him
---
So the game is bad because you suck? You only played for 8 hours and judge by that experience? The first hours can be stressing because you don't know how to play

Maybe he can hide in the holes and also teleport? Instead of hag where you go straight to the trap. That would be neat because you wouldn't know if he'd pop out or not.
---
Put Jason and Pamela in "Dead By Daylight 2" in 5 years time when the lawsuit is settled and everyone is good!
---
He also looks like a karen and like he didnt leave puberty.
---
(Bad karma here i come)
---
you’re a very pleasant person
---
Always wanted a killer perk that would let you exchange your lunge for a sweeping strike. Very situational but for surprise killers like Micheal or hag I think it would help them out without being busted.
---
Ok thx
---
It should be something associated with the upside down. Maybe while youre in a realm, you can see the auras of survivors in the OPPOSITE realm. And there are portals to go between both worlds. And his chase ability could be that he moves faster for each survivor thats injured? Idk that sounds op but I cant think of a lore-friendly chase ability.
---
Yay more players across all platforms that the game is on or coming to. hopefully :)
---
Mah baby boi
---
They own the xeno too and Disney doesn’t really do that, especially a game like this. Oh but it was in MKX well Disney didn’t own it in 2015
---
My great great grandmother side of the family was a Wheeler.
---
Monitor and Abuse is anti synergy with the impossible skill check doctor build you're using.  Couldn't tell whatr add ons you have because of the stream quality, but you want the one that makes your shock AURA (not treatment) build madness faster, and then a range extender for cancelling vaults and pallets.  
---
I's replace M and A for clorophobia, sloppy butcher, or ruin.  Pop goes the Weasel would also be fun.
---
I see your a dead meat fan as well
---
I dont get it but I'm still upvoting
---
I'm just straight up gonna let them live. I can't stand seeing poor Nancy or hair master Steve die.
---
Emphasis on finally. Such a niche perk. Too many hooks for it to ever be useful.
---
Obvious reference with "air quotes" doesnt make it more obvious. EXPLAIN! EXPLAAAAAIN! (Very obvious reference also)
---
wow no need to insult the op
---
He wants to be toxic. That’s all there is to it. Why do survivors tea bag? Maybe that’s why he’s all butt hurt.
---
I wonder what would be his power. It's not obvious.
---
I don’t understand this. Still upvoted
---
They already have an Italian survivor, Ace.....
---
Some people don't care about the character though. I know I got pretty much all the survivors I want and there's like 5 or so I could buy. Plus, not everyone is against dropping $5 for a character, especially a killer. So saving shards really isn't a big deal.
---
Unless, maybe if you're vet and you're always stacked on shards for the next DLC, then sure.
---
OH THESE ARE SO PRETTY
---
Not even wrong
---
I will make it legal
---
I dunno, I see plenty of 'IT'S JUST CTRL BRO' and 'camping is a legit strategy' on this sub...
---
(For the record, I do know camping can be a strategy, but that doesn't make it not douchey if the gates aren't powered. I won't fault you if it works, but I'm also not gonna console you if it doesn't)
---
Definitely a great killer concept &amp; level concept. I would to see Harry Warden chasing me around, in 3-D?
---
Yes. This question has been answered a million times. No one wants to buy Bubba just for BBQ, but either bite the bullet or have the slowest grind without BBQ.
---
&gt; He's a bonafide serial killer so it fits.
---
As is the Trapper, Myers, Doctor, Huntress, Freddy, Pig and Ghostface.
---
Not exactly exclusive to the Clown.
---
A lot of people consider the clown to be useless apparently.
---
"He is not viable at hight ranks" "He is basically an M1 killer" and such.
---
People are goint to try and break you vision of it jsut because it isnt a high tier killer like Billy.
---
4, we have gotten 4, 2 killers and 2 survivors is that a fuck ton of characters
---
&gt; in the current state of the game the Killer will get destroyed if a chase last any ammount of time
---
If a chase is taking too long to finish, you should break off and go back to checking gens. The survivor will still be available to hook later, but only if you can keep the gates from opening. Plus, if you got a hit in before the chase, they will probably choose to spend time healing when you aren't chasing them, which is someone who isnt working on gens
---
Hag traps are mostly annoying how i have to hold my breath when normally walking so that i won't bother her
---
The ground thing is triggering my phobia, I think this is where I get off the dbd train gamers
---
Should probably mark this as "spoiler" for those who do not want to see this
---
Bro this man just threw a tantrum because of toxic survivors and then pinned it on game balance. Grow the fuck up.
---
I saw a post of one of the developers saying it's nothing like Freddy's so I don't think it will involve the upside down however that post could be fake but it seems legit
---
The reason he looks wack is because they couldn't use the actual actor's likeness, to make him look good they'd need to make like a new survivor and just slap Quentin's name on it
---
Best idea: Set aside all toxicity, period. Life is a lot better when you're not trying to ruin it for others.
---
Thanks I don't have ruin yet on doc.  I just got it as a teachable yesterday though.  
---
Yeah I tend to get very shock happy I'm trying to stop that as I end up sacrificing potential hits.
---
Thanks for all the tips I'll certainly take them on board.
---
Just so you know the trending page is picked by staff and algorithms so because of it being stranger things it got put on trending
---
I'm aware. But between all the legal issues with the license and the game itself.. I just don't ever see Jason coming to DBD.
---
No worries, but you gotta promise to do the maggot infested clown santa one day alright :D
---
I would also like to see the Tall Man from phantasm.
---
And they have more than one American survivor
---
Rek Sai
---
U are a victim for bringing a flashlight.
---
That's how u get targetted by killers.
---
I feel sketchy bringing items- more reason to tunnel/camp me.
---
This guy stonks
---
Looks awesome to me! I'm imaging that gate on the ground is like a gopher hole for the Demogorgon haha
---
I'm using what I can as I don't have a lot of high level killers I've just made ruin a teachable which I'm super happy about.  Yeah I'll ditch M&amp;A maybe go for pop as I just got clown and love that perk so much it feels great to use.
---
I don't play mike so i don't know what does it do
---
But nidus's story is not as scary as harrow, still would be cool
---
Oh god! And Hag's Mori when she eats all their intestines!! :o
---
Only watched part of a dead meat video!!?!? You heathen!!!!
---
Now that game is fucking dead
---
My boi noob the new main (laughs at noob3 continuously saying the “c” word)
---
Yet the statement of him being the best killer gets upvotes and if they made a tier list to reflect that opinion it gets downvoted. This community....
---
A small price to pay for Steve Harrington
---
Yup! bbq and franklins are essential in the killer perk toolbox
---
I mean fair enough if you see a lobby with 4 p3 claudettes with torches but we're all just solo players, I asked him what about that game he found fun in the post game chat and he just said ':) ez'
---
Here's my thoughts on how the demigorgon will work (as someone who has never seen stranger things) their power will be twofold
---
1. They will be able to teleport/transport between these holes in the ground
---
2. They will have some sort of in-the-chase power like what we can assume from a more feral looking killer, especially during the trailer. Now while I have at least an inkling that the demigorgon isn't fully feral, it's still more feral than a group of teenagers who's power is feral frenzy.
---
Now at very minimum one perk I'm going to assume they have is either flashlight or gen related. Either this perk will drain a flashlight faster or make it less effective, or this perk will slow down or have something special to do with gens (a la discordance and surveillance)
---
I see, I guess running franklins isn’t really toxic, it’s just annoying for survivors.
---
But his hair...
---
What about Monto and HybridPanda?
---
I found it in a chest. I just wanted to have some fun with a looter build
---
*What is that* ***MELODY?!***
---
Hmm ... I don’t know how but I will try xD
---
Why don't you contact the actor and the people holding the license for Quentin, pay the hundreds of thousands they would demand and then we can talk about it.
---
I always thought it would be cool to have a perk that allowed you to break pallets before they are dropped. Only a few (like 1/2/3 or something) so that survs still have something to defend themselves with, but you could go and get rid of the 'god' pallets on a map that you just know are going to give you problems.
---
It comes in the shrine that's how I got it but it's just rare
---
LISTEN LISTEN I WATCHED IT!!
---
Is it just me or as soon as I see a tier 1 Myers behind me a skill check shows up at the exact moment?
---
Oh thanks a lot for silver dude L:) Hope it helps.
---
D&amp;D Demogorgon &gt; DBD Demogorgon.
---
Don't @ Me.
---
Just to make people upset.
---
i'm just skeptical, sorry
---
Is it possible for Jason to ever join the game?
---
Haha. Yeah:)
---
Not if he has BM's
---
a survivor main thinks there’s only THREE op builds. 
---
Interesting.
---
Echolocation
---
To be fair you did face camp that first person like everyone said. The more you play killer the better you will get. Honestly it doesn’t really matter if they get to second phase or not. That strategy won’t help you against better survivors they will just do all the generators and leave that person to die or they will have perks that make it so they can do a safe unhook then loop you etc. You’re better off just leaving them on the hook, going and patrolling gens and kicking them, letting that person get unhooked while you go after some other survivors you haven’t hit yet. Your goal as the killer is to keep the survivors from their objective so you can ultimately kill them. Keep in mind it takes quite a while in your part to accomplish that. Playing the killer is a slow burn. The longer you drag out the game the more likely it is to turn in your favor. Face camping won’t help you in the long run.
---
Facts
---
But what about kingdom hearts?
---
cool, Imma just stab him then
---
It does.  Like it's hard to find flaws in my own gameplay haha.  You deserve it.  You even gave me specific times to Look at and stuff.  Top tier advice.
---
If the survivors done more then 2 gens - that means the hatch has spawned already and it can be found in tiles or specific places on the map like the house on farm, slug the 3rd survivor look for the hatch, find it and then hang someone and stand on the hatch to close it so they can't jump on
---
If they didnt - you can either chill so they do 3 gens or finish quicker and Hope to be lucky to find the hatch first 
---
Its sometimes better to just Play another game then to waste time on HATCH WARS (all rights reserved)
---
Sincerely
---
A killer main
---
i did not watch stranger things, any idea what that pit does
---
Like a cleave?
---
Good headphones as a number 1, and search the common hatch spots. Using the game as an example the hatch can only spawn on the bottom floor, so searching for it above while potentially easier is risker. Another example is lery's, you'll want to search the library and treatment wards first because the hatch will spawn in or nearby these places in the hallway.
---
The reason I said to snag headphones is aside from the destinctive "HWOOOOOOOOOO" sounds there is also a feint, more quite version when you're close.
---
Unless they got noed
---
Free 4 all I'm leaving
---
Pop goes the weasel is super strong, and it has good synergy with overcharge.  There's a doc add on that makes your terror radius bigger in treatment mode and smaller in punishment mode, that could be an alright way for you to be able to swap out distressing for a little more freedom in your perk selection.  
---
Also, with impossible skill check doc it's going to get harder to be successful the higher you climb up the ranks without ruin, that build is strongest on lery's memorial and on the game.  So buy up those puzzle piece and broken glasses add ons.
---
Thought six was white power
---
Yeah it’s hard to criticize a game where you get all 4 kills and they only completed 2 gens. So a few random things I noticed: 
---
- you can’t hit survivors with your shock if they are on the hill. 
---
- you took a few wide turns during some loops. It didn’t make a difference in that game but at higher ranks, you wanna make sure to hug the walls as much as possible. Also hiding your red stain when going around high walls can get you some surprise hits. 
---
- try to time your shock to hit survivors before they vault or throw pallet so it blocks their ability and you can get a hit. 
---
- sometimes you kicked gens when it wasn’t really necessary. It is usually more efficient to go for chases, but you do have overcharge so I understand why you did it. Overcharge is a pretty strong perk at low ranks.
---
I swear I thought 6 was Bald Power until I read the comments 😄
---
calm down
---
Steve Harrington
---
Really trying not to judge when I ask - but isnt playing a game full of horror characters supposed to trigger a phobia or two?
---
Can I ask what phobia you have?
---
I would personally replace Windows of Oppurtunity with Lithe or Borrowed Time (Borrowed Time is especially handy if you play with friends). Lithe goes well together with Dance with Me and it's always good to put some more distance between you and the killer. And for some general tips: I don't know if you ever play killer but for me it helped a lot to try out some killers, even if it was just for one match. You see how their playstyle works and you see how chases work from the killers point of view.  And overall, try to be unpredictable. For example, if you see the killer run towards you, go right, break line of sight and go left instead. Or if you are running away from the killer, break line of sight and crouch around until you get behind the killer and run in the opposite direction. I hope some of these general tips will help you :)
---
I did not know this, so thank you
---
THIS. I'm at about rank 15 with both killer and survivor right now. Every time I've played survivor recently I've had teammates that DC on their first hook or repeatedly unhook survivors right in front of the killer and there's just nothing we can do.
---
Then I will get sick of that, play killer and get matched up against 3 green ranks and a grey rank and get smashed. Or a SWF. Basically, survivors that know how to loop and don't do stupid shit like unhooking their teammates right in front of a bubba who is already revving his chainsaw.
---
Quite frankly, every time I've played this game in this past week I've just ended up frustrated and started playing something else. Maybe it's not for me but I really want to like it.
---
While we're at it, can we ask why Lightburn is even a mechanic anymore? All it really does is punish the Wraith, when he's already pretty weak. I'm trash at the Nurse, so I don't play her, but I doubt people actually get Lightburns off on her very often. I could be wrong about that, but I've never seen anyone say "Just bring a flashlight" to counter the Nurse.
---
Also people who talk like that and are toxic jerks are immature turd people. The worst part about the internet is that crap. Saying that to someone in real life gets you laid out. Inexcusable.
---
What was the original comment, they deleted it?
---
Ok..umm.. pretty much chase stoping perks. Like enduring to eat pallets, spirit fury to help enduring, pop goes the weasel, and bamboozle. Just things to end chases and stop loops. You can add ruin instead of pop or corrupt intervention.
---
Seems I can't.
---
when you put it that way, it feels like the Killer is trapped with the survivors and not the other way around.
---
While I kinda agree with what youre saying, you are going to lose a lot of cred by using bing bong as an example. Pretty well every one knows hes a bottom tier killer, so unless you are in the brown/yellow ranks you are going to have a rough game with him regardless. I dont think gens need to take longer, I think there needs to be more to keep survs off of gens when they arent being chased; like an extra objective or making them harder to find or something.
---
Who are the new survivors?
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Thank you robot friend
---
Game simply needs more to do for both sides. Now that egc has been implemented I feel like it wont change anytime soon. Also, what is this op wraith build?
---
Your ears are a massive tool as the killer. Sound gives away a ton and once you have heard the hatch sound before you will be able to find it easily just by listening from then on. Very rarely does someone find the hatch before me now. I use this as a survivor also to escape on the regular.
---
This post is toxic
---
/s
---
You mean Alive by Nightfall
---
Imagine how he’s gonna lose his shit when he gets his P3
---
It probably is a generational gap. Now it's considered just being a dick. People do it and always will, but it's way more called out now
---
Bruh there's no way your moronic ass gets this many upvotes, not even in this subreddit, do you have a karmafarming program or something?
---
Imo camping isn’t inherently douchey.
---
If you camp someone because you are singling them out specifically (i.e camping someone with .tv in their name) it can be douchey.
---
Otherwise, it’s just not a good strategy. Gens will be powered while you waste time staring at someone. If you’re against a team who will all stop doing gens to save someone, camping is the right strategy to counter them.
---
If you're a god, yes.
---
God damn you got the song stuck in my head now. Its so catchy and good!
---
Actually good point
---
Do you mean the perk caps at 8K or the categories in general cap at 8K?
---
You're not a real serial killer unless you suck on someones finger.
---
The sad thing that this actually happens to me so often.. I hook someone, then two survivors run up to me trying to bait me, while I know that the third player is also around..
---
It feels like survivors just want you to run to the corner of the map after you hook someone, otherwise you're a worthless face checking tunneler
---
Myers: You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders
---
Guess not then
---
Lmao can someone tell me what song this is? It sounds like it could be animal crossing but I’m not sure what it is.
---
Daaaaamn. That's fucking scary, I dont know but I imagine him walking with like a swagger
---
Honestly one of the best tanks already
---
Nanci and Steve from Stranger Things
---
It's been more than a month...
---
U blind?
---
spirit with prayer beads and yakuyoke amulet are an insanely powerful add-on combination on the spirit, and the ebony mori makes the match completely unforgiving.
---
I remember this game back when we had only the absolute unit in front of you, Evan Macmillan. It was a very different time, and never when I imagined how many killers would be added and what they would look like, but never did I think we'd get crazy things like Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Saw, and now even Stranger Things. It has been a wild ride BHVR, and its been a pleasure to stick with you through these years.
---
They could update his face they just won’t because they are focused on other things, stranger
---
Yeah wall hugging is something I've never done.  So I'll try that in loops.  I had no idea about the hill thing.  Yeah I kind of use overcharge as a budget ruin because I don't have ruin on doc yet. 
---
Thanks for all the tips.  Really appreciate it all.
---
Alien and Predator please
---
Must be my camoflague not-obvious-unless-I-turn-around blazer... 
---
I knew a year of being obsessed with being a true Blendette (minus the toxicity of locker hopping and sandbagging) would help me prevail against the killers!
---
Now I've completely changed. Oh, yes. Now all I want to do is buy Auric cells so I can be pink neon Nea and run around being obvious.
---
Why do you think she didn't know you were coming? Everyone who runs SB does it so they can hold out until the last possible second
---
Don't kink shame him. It's not his fault he thinks horrifically deformed killers are cute.
---
I mean...
---
That last part, really made me laugh
---
Unironically believing these starts must be legit, big yikes. Normal people would see this and go "hmm that doesn't seem right". but not dumbass killermain #17888 "OMG I KNEW THE SURVIVAL RATE WAS 80% NERF SURVIVORS MORE THIS IS WHY I SUCK AT THIS GAME NOT BECAUSE IM BAD BUT BALANCE". You're a joke.
---
I stopped playing when the plague was added,this summer I tried to find a match at rank 20 and it took me 2 hours and literally *no one* even joined the lobby.
---
Maybe I'll give it another shot when servers get added,hopefully I can get a match
---
Demorgon has to be scary, he must have his invisibility, he must walk the upside down world and have the notification of when he is near .. lights flashing as in TRAILER. Hopefully his power is unique ... and not a mixture.
---
That’s a very cartoony fighting game with no gore and a slightly dark undertone, not about the character hunting and killing survivors. Disney owns companies that make rates R and gorey entertainment but they themselves generally don’t, but also if it’s still owned by 20th century and Disney owns them so it isn’t they’re license per say then I wouldn’t say it’s impossible but it’s very unlikely
---
Imagine being an inter dimensional gestalt intelligence only to job to a bunch of children **TWICE** before some goofy spider monster takes your favorite toy and uses it to kill those kids with ease.
---
Looks like the survivors are going to be able to remove the gorgons power, already looking like a shit tier killer.
---
i just started playing siege and i know for sure ima be playing it more than dbd
---
If the demogorgan is humanoid then anything that stands on 2 legs is humanoid to BHVR
---
I legit started laughing my ass off, though I don't get the meme at all.
---
096
---
Killers have weapons, survivors have disrespect. You can Slash me, but a simple buttrub will heal me, but you can't heal yourself from your ptsd after 4 survivors keep Head On'ing your forehead
---
It's supposed to be a horror game tho, isn't that the point?
---
If not, then everyone in the US would have stopped playing when Clown got released
---
What perks are you using?
---
could you please link the stream?
---
My guess is that the demogorgon can go into the upside down and back by digging these holes, and they can be sabotaged by survivors or maybe the survivors can use the portals, ooh what if half the generators are in the upside down forcing you to travel back and forth.
---
i read that as “meth hooks”
---
No nerfs spirit nurse and ruin are fine how they are k agree with a. Dynamic objective but killers are to be powerful I would  rather stealth be more of an option and be rewarded for it more than just like points in evader
---
People complain about licensed dlc, but I think it's the dlc I get most excited for. I love crossovers in games, and I can't wait to see what they license next.
---
I am trying so hard not to burst out laughing at work lmao
---
why is there a bulge on my dbd subreddit. not that im complaining too much but
---
Spirit is stronger and has good perks - i suggest you put your money on her
---
noed
---
Thank you! ^ ^
---
&gt; If a chase is taking too long to finish, you should break off and go back to checking gens.
---
As explained in my post, sometimes none of your chase last long at all and still lose to gen rush. This is especially true at red ranks if many of them have toolboxes.
---
Imo I don't really like the aspect of Myers when he can just 99 his EW on somebody else and then instastab you during the chase. But at the same time he's quite balanced overall.
---
Maybe generators are in the upside down so survivors gotta enter through the portals and the Demogorgon somehow know
---
They probably can be there just for a set period of time cuz the air there is poisonous or whatever
---
I'm running quiet saw and they were running into my saw all game. They were extremely bad. But also, that shouldn't have happened. It literally promotes lazy play.
---
Had a game where we successfully got all gens but Billy had an ebony and proceeded to Mori everyone after first hooks, didn't hook anyone twice. GG free win, much skill, so fun.
---
My guess is teleport around the map by getting into a hole and climb out somewhere else, which survivors can temporarily close, thereby reducing the killer's overall power. But the killer can reopen it as well.
---
It's from Yoshi's island
---
Repost
---
Actually if the Spirit does poorly and I'm her obsession (or any killer does poorly and there's clearly a mori in play) I'll tend to go meet them down in the basement so they don't feel left out of the game.
---
spirit can become invisible and move super fast....but you can't see survivors(she is the second best killer RN)
---
GhostyBOI is kinda inverted Myers, he stalks survs. and applies exposed individuality
---
&gt; While I kinda agree with what youre saying, you are going to lose a lot of cred by using bing bong as an example. 
---
Yep seems like you are right. Every comments is hard focusing on this irrevelant example.
---
&gt;  I dont think gens need to take longer, I think there needs to be more to keep survs off of gens when they arent being chased
---
Yea top upvoted comment is right. A second objective in addition to gens is a good idea.
---
He's very strong right now but still not as strong as a good nurse, Sweaty Mountainous William or an intelligent spirit.  
---
He's probably the best of the M1 killers, but survivors (including yourself) will inevitably get used to playing against him and around his add ons.  
---
His only weakness is ironically endgame, because he loses his map mobility (warping to generators).
---
I mean killers can still force open the door and then hook for bloodwarden just saying
---
Leatherface is really fun imo to play but he's not a very good killer since he's essentially a weaker hillbilly at least that's how I see it. But, either or BBQ and Franklin's are great perks you'd be getting plus he's got a cool Mori.
---
Oh I know. He'll probably have a black eye, puffy face
---
And a fucking battlepass that probably won't be included in the year pass. Greedy cunts. sMaLl iNdIe cOmPaNy bTw
---
I expect the devs to give us all 1 mil bp and increase the cap to 2 mil because of the broken servers. I have multiple screenshots of killers hitting me from 20 feet away or just facing a different direction from me. Been dealing with this for years. Not even the connection, just the broken hitboxes
---
I've tried camping 3 or 4 times out of thousands of games, to try and understand why it's so appealing. And I have no idea. It is the most boring shit ever for both sides.

Laughs in "Unnerving Presence and Doctor giggles."
---
&gt; The game itself is hard to balance because there's such a huge difference between the casual immersed players who play the game like it's hide and seek (is that a distant heartbeat? I better go to the corner of the map instead of working the generator) and then the serious players who do the generators as fast as possible.
---
But at the same time, there is also a big difference between a baby Killer and red ranks Killers. Ranks are there for a reason.
---
&gt; And making chases shorter is where the game design is headed, look at the rework to exhaustion perks that rolled out around the clown release, look at the new variations of Badham.
---
I am totally aware of that, and i am saying its a bad design choice. Imo game is more fun with longer chases, but gens are done way too fast for that.
---
shit man thats pretty neat
---
A perk for survivors that puts the great skill check section on the opposite side
---
because r/leaksbydaylight/ ?
---
Probably a dumb question, but with these bloodweb changes, is there a risk of my blood points being reset once this chapter is released? I’m trying to horde as many as I can :p
---
I would assume so, just like how Billy was the DBD version of leather face, until they actually got leather face.
---
cut screams make me happy
---
That would be really cool line to say in the lobby
---
Yeah I don't play killer much but if the survivors are too potato I walk them the fuck out. I'm here to hunt, not harvest.
---
The music in the trailer was awesome, waiting to hear the whole song
---
Yeah, I didn't realize that either but it makes perfect sense.
---
Happy Cake day! Wish you healthy laughs!
---
Huntress would work better as the Fighter ngl
---
Speaking of Wendigos, when are we gonna get the Winchester Brothers as survivors?
---
bruh
---
Tbh if im the only one whos clueless, goddamn im stupid.
---
They said that they look too similar to spirit so they won’t be in the game lol
---
I’m just too damn SEXY
---
fuck, so he's literally a worse hillbilly ?
---
They don't have anything on leaked perks atm. They might be revealed this Tuesday.
---
I would love that TBH.
---
guys I'm fairly new to the game, I only have 300 hours ish - I've never touched a PTB; can someone please tell me how it works? how to access it and such / PC Steam
---
which survivor which killer?
---
That guy is criminally underrated.
---
I watch him to test how long my sanity can last.
---
I have DbD on PC and I'm gonna wait till it roll out completely, not interested in betas
---
Maybe like the plagues sickness where if they stay there eventually they'll get injured and can't heal unless they leave
---
Dude ive made up this thing called the infinite loop. Rank 15-17 is the worst for experienced players like me. We get trash teammates and killers with noed. Took weeks for me to get out of there
---
&gt;Right? Talking like his lazy ass 'meme' took effort to do
---
&gt;When did I state a opinion?
---
Your troll game is fucking weak. I've met 13 year old Fortnite players who can talk shit better than your bitch ass can
---
Its a joke in this subreddit. Spelling it like meyers
---
Are you planning on doing the backpack, too?
---
Dont think I've ever gotten stuck at 15/16... try pushing from 4 to 1 and then let me know if you still feel the same lol
---
Yes that would be the last thing I do tho
---
This is sad to look at
---
PogChamp
---
Yea I had noed active but as you see in the vid she was already hurt and noed had nothing to do with the vid. The point of the vid was to show she almost had the hatch but I stopped her mid jump. Thanks for the comment though? Lol
---
You might be on to something since his rework is coming anyways
---
I've never gotten stuck at those ranks.
---
The dedicated servers which have been officially announced for Summer 2019 ought to fix that, but yea....still patiently waiting for the dedicated servers, I would donate a hundo if it would help them arrive quicker.
---
Nope. Close to 50 other people got emotional instead of using their heads. You’re not alone. The Crapper will see you out.
---
So how do you design a game to be accessible to both the casual players that don't understand the game or its pacing and the people who have it down to a science?
---
They want to get rid of more of the god pallets in favor of mind games and shorter loops.  Is it really as fun automatically losing the chase in Wretched Shop because the survivor understands they can go through the window to the other window to a L wall window loop before bringing you back to the main building without even using a single pallet yet?
---
And rewatching vid noed actually wasnt even active yet because they had one gen left to pop, so your comment doesnt make sense here
---
1.) Rank reset happening so often is trash.
---
2.) Matchmaking is a joke.
---
1.) Rank reset is trash, because someone like me, who plays tons of other games and likes to grind those games, goes from rank 8 surv/rank 12 killer. Then comes back and is Rank 20 on both and just conpletely destroys with my level 50 character vs a low level character.
---
2.) Just look at the pic lmao. I’ve seen worse than this time and time again, between here and playing myself. I’ve played rank 1 survs as a rank 15 killer...mind you i really loved that game because it was hard, but still, not everyone would enjoy that. And vise versa, rank 5 killers vs rank 10+ survs. And yes, higher ranks face camp. Lmao.
---
Looks like the demigorgan can plant these holes throughout the map and ‘teleport’ using them, and survivors can get rid of them somehow as well.
---
That's a pretty big assumption there, bud. Really all you can say from that *one screenshot* is that survivors will be able to interact with the demogorgon's power somehow (which could mean anything).
---
That's a chad mom chief. You are lucky
---
I have trypophobia, Its not like that, it's a serious disgust, I can't bare to look at it
---
Anybody has some tips for playing as The Plague? Like perks, strategies, etc
---
It's nice to see that you just followed my info, take care
---
_Do it._
---
Most maps still have 20-ish pallets on them. I dont think breaking 2 or 3 of them early on would be broken.
---
I'd play him even if he were the worst for that backstory alone.
---
Baby. Baby Boy.
---
Also keep in mind that you don’t need to get a 4K every single game. You can have a fun game and get a ton of bloodpoints even if you only get one kill. People seem to have this idea that a “win” can only be achieved by getting a 4K but that’s simply not true. A win is whatever you want it to be. I win at killer by getting my BBQ stacks and then having a fun game after, regardless of how many kills I get. It’s all about perspective.
---
Ik I agree I just made this as a joke tbh
---
This isn’t oc
---
They put 2 posts in a row when i saw the post, probably deleted the second one
---
Best not strongest. His design is the best.
---
Yikes
---
Ah, a fellow dead meat watcher
---
When I learned about DbD... that was the last day I played F13.
---
&gt;  so I just stayed in front of him to guarantee he gets toit 
---
Technically this is camping. Those survs were toxic af though. Remember there is nothing against the rules about camping, its not a reportable offence; so if thats how you wanna play you go right ahead and do it. Survs make up all kinds of unwritten rules. The REAL reason why you shouldnt camp though is because it doesnt work. You are sacrificing your chances at hooking the other 3 survs to ensure one dies; it's just not productive to camp unless the survs are also bad and dont do gens.
---
HAHA look everyone a noob
---
How is his design the best?
---
Maybe. Does that count as an official diagnosis?
---
I find endgame toxicity to be mostly started by killers lately.
---
I've always liked the sneaky, tactical approach to games and Ghost Face is the sneakiest. I get that NOED is somewhat looked down upon by some, but I don't have any other killers than the default ones which means I don't have that many effective perks to choose from ;)
---
nope, only original killers
---
The survivors will be asked if they want the killer to have power before the match.
---
Almost certainly not. They're licensed characters.
---
The maps are never included the DLC packet, it's just labelled as the same chapter.
---
Nice recommend
---
Cmon you know everyone will pay 19.99 just to main that Hair. BHVR knows they’ve got us on this one.
---
Besides they have to pay license cost on top. Given ST popularity I’m sure it’s not cheap.
---
They talk!
---
Preach
---
I hate how this world is so obsessed over babies 🙄 and pregnancy
---
*C- can you hear that music?*
---
#2 on trending is awesome. 
---
Just for the advertisers they couldn’t let a horror video game with naughty killings be first.
---
I agree. I hope teleportation is not the only thing it does because it is too much like rework Freddy and it doesn't seem like it will help in a chase. Hoping it has a secondary ability.
---
fuck off
---
If it was me, I wouldve shit my pants
---
Grows up to be a Demogorgan or Demogorgan main?
---
Is that everyone?
---
I don’t know the maps well enough yet to know all the spawn spots but listening has been a big help for me. :)
---
He is the scariest killer that actually inspires Horror in a game that usually loses any scary element after playing long enough. His power can widely vary depending on the add-ons you use Karma and he is not considered unfun to play against by the majority of the community.
---
I just bring borrowed time and deliverance and you're good to rescue.
---
Yeaaaaah. The beyond ridiculous grind is the elephant in the room. They have an opportunity to see reason and change it, but it's been 3 years...
---
worst = david, best = maybe claudette?
---
Myers agrees... or was he looking at something else?
---
he complains about everything . he complains abt loops but then abuses them? like the ironworks loop? lmao
---
FORGIVE ME JESUS FOR I HAVE LAUGHED LOOOOOOOOOOL
---
I mean yeah
---
Dead HARD =D
---
Still number one for me in Canada! the baby vid is 200k views behind the trailer!
---
You are confusing, but I'll give you a run down...
---
&gt;!A kid goes missing, snatched by something and put somewhere that you later find out is another dimension called "the upside down" by a creature called a Demogorgan. The first season is trying to find him, eventually a group of like-minded people form including the two survivors (Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler), they fight off the Demogorgan (Steve famously with a nailed baseball bat) and some of the other group find and bring the missing kid back.!&lt;
---
That's just season 1 and I've not included a lot of things that aren't really relevant to this chapter but there's sci-fi/fantasy themes, someone has psionic powers and there's romance and character developments all around, some EXCELLENT acting, too (and some mediocre acting).
---
This is why solo que survivors especially need to run Borrowed time. Worrying about “well is this gonna farm him?” When he’s going into struggle is not ideal. I’d rather be entirely farmed without Borrowed time before death or before struggle.
---
The song sounds amazing
---
Yeah, take 5 cocaines before bed and you'll be right as rain tomorrow.
---
I guess thats fine for new players. I dont see any of that but to each their own.
---
Right click "Dead by Daylight" in your steam library and click "properties." And under the "betas" tab there is a drop down menu and when the developers open up the beta branch of the game you can select it in that menu and Steam will update the game to be the beta version separate from the live version. But you can only have one at a time and you can go through the same process to opt out of the beta and update the game back to the live version.
---
They take a snapshot everyone's live save file at some point the week before the ptb goes up but while the ptb will track during the test period it will not affect your live save.
---
And everyone will have access to the content that needs to be tested while on the ptb such as the new killer and survivors.
---
Other than all that it works like the normal game where you level up just as normal so most people save up blood points for a ptb to level up the characters from the start.
---
Console players when we don't care at all cause we are still gonna get it in the end
---
Honestly I think Googling it or using the Reddit search function within the dead by daylight subreddit will be able to better describe it to you.
---
Self care and a medpack?
---
By the time he grows up, he'll be a chucky main.
---
Considering it'll be years before chucky drops....
---
I didn't. I played killer when it was bugged.
---
I think that the smoker or the hunter would be more interesting
---
It is good, especially since no one uses it, it's just not anywhere close to the top tiers
---
Yes it’s better with a keyboard I believe. I play on controller personally but you it definitely works on pc.
---
I'm mainly joking but you'll see as you rank up, you're games will become more frustrating and sweaty, but by then it's too late cause you're already hooked lol
---
I wonder what we'll get in the future...
---
Chucky plz.
---
sad waluigi noises
---
They should with the large amount of people probably going to play the game.
---
one of the devs made a statement saying that the demogorgan will be nothing like freddy.
---
Reddit community. Let's go watch that trailer again! In sure we can get it back to 1.
---
The same loops would be broken every single time. Maybe not a broken perk but def strong.
---
https://media1.tenor.com/images/02b659d3e6d8ebf1d3e76e9676b8eff0/tenor.gif?itemid=11796572
---
Like almost all game lol
---
Well ignoring the nurse...
---
 Spirit or hag the best. Billi also has good ones. I think definitely spirit.
---
 The worst Myers and doc. Freddy has bad perks too but he is strong at base. Mayers is strong at base but shitty perks. Doc the worst I think, also wraith or trapper.
---
Distressing, beast of prey, and prove thyself give increased bp gains during the match which caps at 8k.
---
BBQ and We're gonna live forever give you bonus bloodpoints after the match based on your score and token count which results in you getting more than the 32k total cap.
---
Jason is the Waluigi of DBD
---
That will not happen
---
Don't you ever say her name!
---
I Sure Agreed. That's a nice crow.
---
There isn't some magical fix to queue times. Especially since the issue is the opposite for console players
---
It’s supposed to frighten you, not make you disgusted.
---
if they are a good killer people being chased need that door open or if they are on hook they are a lost cause and if you try to help them you will just end up giving the killer 2 killis instead of just 1. if bad killer then yeah 99 that mf
---
10/10 victim blaming 👌
---
You could be communication banned for swearing in those messages if he chooses to report them
---
okay this is definitively a Kira Yoshikage moment
---
Pinhead: Am I a joke to you?
---
I mean, how long are things usually number one anyway? The fact a DbD trailer made it there at all is an amazing accomplishment.
---
Okay great. So im not the only one clueless of what the fuck you are referencing or why you dont tell us where the reference is from.
---
people who’ve never made it to get from 4 to 1 now that ranking is redone :/ i depipped from an escape because the killer was an afk wraith
---
Mauahahhaha
---
Ah nice. I'll keep that in mind then. But i feel like I should only use her at ranks 15+ cause ATM I suck with her lol
---
I Cas Sense it Aswell... And it Stinks.
---
Probably within the last 6-8 weeks I think
---
5 was very clever, took me a bit to get that one figured out
---
How am I dogshit if I'm doing a generator, the generators almost done there for really loud and I can't hear The Wraith, and he body blocks me in a corner? Then I'm not allowed to move?
---
The biggest reason I was upset last night about the whole body blocking with The Wraith is because I had been playing and some dude body blocks me in a corner for 5 minutes, wouldn't leave even though generators were getting done, and the only way I was able to get out was by disconnecting, which made me lose pips.
---
As for what pissed me off so much about the doctor last night, he tunneled me relentlessly. Dude was running Insidious and prox camping on the hook, and because I wasn't in a survive with friends group, I couldn't tell anybody.
---
Honestly surprised I even managed to pip against him, considering he left me alone for a whole two minutes before he was on me again.
---
I love potato survs
---
They won't.
---
*coughs in salty survivor*
---
I’ve dropped so many references that if I say anymore Nea is gonna kill me.
---
Steve looks super cool, might be the first male I will actually play as. Need to hear the voice first though. Anyone know if they got the original voices?
---
Sorry I think I'll pass on watching the convoluted entire saw franchise. I watched the first and the rest on Dead Meat
---
Also, how am I just supposed to know what killer I'm going against and add perks accordingly? Your argument is invalid unless there's a new mechanic in the game that I don't know about that lets you see who the Killer is :^)
---
Get outplayed nerd
---
Lol I can't do that while I babysit xD
---
1m is stretched thin with just 2 characters. With 3, will that even be enough to reach level 15 on all 3?
---
I play him too, and the whole reason I was so angry last night was because I had a game with a doctor that was running Insidious, prox camping, and talk. Because I wasn't in a survive with friends group I couldn't tell the other survivors not to unhook me with him camping, and he only left me alone for about 2 minutes because I have this uncanny ability to always spawn right next to doctors
---
In what way would any of that be like the 1.0 freddy
---
Unless they’re trying to get ruin teachable.
---
And how will you get better if you dont use her against good players? ;)
---
About the 2 worlds power
---
Maybe I do, it's never bad to need to be better at a game that you're enjoying playing and would like to continue playing :)
---
Well. It was a private match with kyf. Otherwise the game wouldn't have started with 1 survivor (2gens/hatch open).
---
~~That and watch Monto/Panda/N0ob3/tru~~
---
Heck, just use the up and down arrows to vote!
---
What do you mean? He has a bachelor of arts and once took game design for non majors. You really should respect his knowledge.
---
Yeah, the last 3 killers have given way too much control of the killers power to survivors.
---
I'm sorry if I gave you the impression that I'm talking about your rank 15 spirit, you're good to go my dude.
---
Welcome to YouTube. 
---
Where automated copy and paste Elsa and Spider-Man pregnant animations make millionaires while actual content creators get demonetized.
---
I wanna get better not die from stress lol xD
---
He’s actually ass
---
The Wraith perks are pretty good, honestly.
---
The footprint one is cheap af
---
They may be two of the weakest, but they sure are damn annoying. Especially because most of the people who play them are extremely toxic. As the title and the last bit of the post said, I had a really bad day for games with those two characters, and that's why I was so upset. Of course, I would like to see some minor tweaks to them (as with other characters), but the shit that I said in this post was just being angry and saying what came to mind
---
Prediction: They'll somewhat recycle aspects of old Freddy. There will be portals to the upside-down which will be similar to the dream world (instead of the killer pulling into the dream world). The Demogorgan will have an extreme mobility boost in the upside-down. They slowly gain mobility boosts in the normal realm until it matches the same mobility they'd have in the upside-down. This is counteracted if survivors enter the upside-down and perform successful skill checks while in the upside-down. The Demogorgan can see the auras of survivors in the upside-down while in there itself, but would otherwise see a killer's instinct if the survivor is in the terror radius and in the opposite world (so if the survivor is in the upside-down while the killer is in the normal world, or vice versa). The Demogorgan will be able to burrow into the other world (long cooldown ability).
---
Spirit needs some addons to be nerfed and nurse needs a definite nerf, ruin if fine. If they add more objectives, killers will have much more time to take care of loops, it'll just make them way more powerful, specifically nurse who doesn't need addons to dominate
---
HENDERSON!
---
I'm gonna do the demogorgon first. I usually level killers first and then the survivors.
---
What rank are you?
---
Like the title and last part of the post say, I was just annoyed and saying what was coming to mind to get it off my chest. I had had five or six particularly toxic Killers playing those two characters in a row, and I was really upset
---
Yeah, but if you tap m2 you kinda lob it slower. If you hold it then you make it go faster
---
Thanks and yes my first comment made no fucking sense.
---
Hope you enjoyed your summer vacation!
---
Rank up some. I promise in purple and red rank he won't feel OP to you.
---
you are not the clown you are the entire circus
---
But the execution is different. The two worlds would appear different from one another and the effects of going into the upside down would be different than going into the dream world and getting to the upside down would be different than getting put to sleep. In no way is that similar.
---
I only used it a few games just to make my teammates think I'd do something but then I just UE'd around the map. I think only the killer liked me those few games. I only got 150 objective points most of those games. Whenever I could've escaped I found the killer and had him kill me too.
---
Oh shit thank didn’t know that
---
EXACTLY. Have they ever done a crossover then
---
Oh for sure 👐 I take breaks from the game regularly, I just had some really bad games last night with Killers who were really toxic and I was really upset. For example, I had a wraith body block me in a corner for five minutes while generators were getting done and literally the only way I was able to get out of it was by disconnecting, which caused me to lose pips.
---
Oh so hes just a hacker lol alright
---
Just 3 more likes and it’ll be at 420
---
But twice as many people will want to play survivor
---
Ohhhh boy do I have some news for you
---
See this is the good shit, I like it when the community isn't toxic and is open to other people's opinions
---
Basically it's when a killer (or just any game that allows players to host their games) fucks with the connection between the survivors and them and since the killer is the host they can move freely while the survivors can't fucking do anything. I wouldn't really worry about it unless it happens like all the time, lag just happens randomly sometimes so survivors will have to accept that till dedicated servers come along.
---
When’s this chapter suppose to come out? Ik they haven’t released a date but any guesses?
---
I thought you would have added hoper instead of Nancy and steve.
---
I love Myers and he's a huge reason I bought they game because they really embraced Halloween, but unfortunately he's not the best (unless you're on console). Although I always hate going up against him because I feel like I'll always die.
---
Try throwing up on people as much as you can, you want to keep them fully infected and broken as much as you can. From there, basically just M1 them all to death, or get Corrupt Purge if they cleanse themselves for some reason.
---
As far as perks go, you'll want to bring some slowdown perks (since they wont be healing, so you lose out on that to slow the game down) and anti-loop perks. Things like Ruin, Brutal, Enduring, Spirit Fury, etc.
---
Spill the tea sis
---
🐟
---
Bait
---
Leave them, not everyone runs those perks.
---
A good pair of headphones
---
yeah, not really. Licensed killers are lazy and a fucking snore fest but giving that BE really just cares about low hanging fruit and not really making an effort to make money. I can see why they're leaning on licensed killers instead of doing anything original or interesting.
---
A real nerf would include reducing his belly size and that is the one thing I wouldn't be able to handle.
---
Welllll. I have a nobody left behind policy and I don't camp hatch.
---
Imo playing Trapper well kind of requires galaxy brain gameplay analysis, since you have to mindgame so much and waste so much time.
---
I think i'm going to stockpile green envelopes and party streamers, to help newbies out with the bp grind. The sooner they get those perks unlocked the more fun they'll be having.
---
i played hag really early on. if you feel like they escape really fast you can run ruin with the hag. also getting her to level 40 will make it so all the other killers can learn ruin. place traps by windows and pallets so that in a chase its harder to escape from you. if you need more tips i always watch monto or noob3.
---
Oh sweet thanks
---
What's OP about him?
---
ItS jUsT wEeD dAd lol
---
Hopefully the Demogorgon is a good tier killer. Sadly most Licensed Killers aren't the best in terms of game wise (Myers is a grey area) Though survivors have gotten amazing perks like borrowed time, Metal of man pre nerf and decisive strike. (I think it just prevents tunneling which is better and not a perk that gives survivors a second chance like before which was bull shit for killers).
---
All of the God tier/Top tiers were all original (Nurse, spirit, huntress) DLCS so hopefully the Demogorgon can change that!
---
I am the same way. Watch a lot of YouTube vids one of my favorites is when ohmwrecker does DBD
---
Bubba is very easy to pickup and highly effective until sirvivors learn to loop properly.
---
With bubba you can also teach survivors to not unhook in your face, even if they have borrowed time. 
---
He's also one of the killers that earns BP easier.
---
Drop the five dollars on leatherface.  He is the best killer to level up first because of his teachable BBQ and chili, which is the most important perk for any aspiring killer main to have.  
---
When you hook a survivor, BBQ and chili shows you the locations of all survivors more than 40 meters away from the hook, and it gives you 25% more bloodpoints for the match for each survivor you hook for the first time.  So you end up with 100% extra BP every time you hook each survivor once in a match.
---
When the game was actually night time and had a spooky atmosphere.
---
We all miss it.
---
lol im talking about the movie parody of scream.  Scary Movie.
---
lol shaggy could have perks related to substance abuse, like where he just doesn't care, causing a loss to not impact your rank as much
---
10 of them
---
4p quality here
---
Either that or hook one person in the killer shack basement and place 5 traps around it lol
---
Vag tag?
---
It's okay I still love you
---
SCP-096 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT
---
Just break the totems if you can't handle NOED.  You get lightbringer emblem points and 1k BP for each dull totem you break in a match.
---
I still want uber Jason
---
I would love to see Pennywise in the game I think he would be a really cool new aspect.
---
I would main Nancy but her render is kinda trash. Steve mains unite
---
You can try doing slow 360s without mouse movement first to get a feel for it. Although most killers are good enough to yeet their mouse across the room when you spin.
---
Tenasscity
---
Mind blown
---
True, but good survivors at that point will probably just leave them
---
They are?
---
Yeah this sucks you should turn back
---
It was a dope game,  I played the shit outta both. Really disappointed that lawsuits that have nothing to do with the game itself is strangling it dead. Literally one of the worst ways for a game to die.
---
That's so complete it seems real
---
Unfortunately for you it looks like the survivors are definitely interacting with it in the second screenshot
---
Yes everyone escaped 😂
---
Nah dude I like that O R A N G E aesthetic.
---
Then maybe you deserve the rank you're in my friend.  Sometimes you have to make those big boy choices and leave the baby dwight on the hook.  
---
I'm not saying every game, but you shouldn't break your back to save someone who has contributed nothing.  Especially in a scenario where you're just going to trade places on the hook with them.
---
Same, brother. Played since day 1, but switched to Dead By Daylight in December.
---
Absolutely agree
---
Why does every dbd player immediately spew out this response? Do you seriously believe that people are not allowed to even form opinions based on their experience? Who cares if I have 1 hour or 1000? I speak with my own experience, at least I am not being delusional or ignorant.
---
&gt;don't know how to play
---
If only the game allowed beginners to learn, which it does not. I played against plenty of killer who had hundreds of hours played in this game for no reason. It's the matchmaking that's broken. But you people are downvoting me for saying the truth.
---
No wonder this game is losing players. Eventually, it will be consist of toxic no-life bullies like you playing this dead game.
---
IM TRIGGERED
---
IT DOESNT EVEN LOOK LIKE NIGHT TIME IN THE ENTITYS REALM ANYMORE
---
Yeah, that is how balancing works in a multiplayer PvP game. You balance the game around the top level players, where the skill ceiling is.
---
I'm not saying I'm an expert I'm just saying that Game Design isn't a completely foreign subject to me. My point is that Dead by Daylight could and should be far better than it is. The optimisation is poor and games with lower budgets have been far better developed. If you seriously disagree then clearly *you* don't know what you're talking about.
---
I really enjoyed the game mechanics too which is the worst part :/ . Maybe I'll just study the ways of dbd and farm toxic players so I can finally be at rank 1. And then deal with the toxic rank 1 players lol.
---
Yaaay no more long queues
---
Leave both as is IMO. They're both perks that give no value throughout the game for a *chance* at a disproportionately strong reward at the end to make up for it. If anything more perks need to be buffed up to having strong niche uses like Head On and PGTW have been recently.
---
Scooby for killer?
---
Is your brain so small that you couldn't connect the dots and see that I returned due to the news of a new licensed DLC?
---
i need scooby and shaggy run animations in dbd
---
Not nearly as much as a lot of other big players of this game.
---
Lmao yea I guess
---
And the survivor? Georgie? XD
---
We’re you his first hook? No excuse to do this but I’m pretty sure he’s really frustrated and is like “Fuck this, I’m getting my kill” as some kind of justification for playing poorly
---
As a killer main, killers who camp deserve what's coming to them
---
Probably, but still nothing wrong in asking
---
At least this is a different spin of "You must be fun at parties" so I'll give you bonus points for that
---
Tfw 1mil+ blood points
---
Run dying light tunnel and give them hell!
---
It's just this guy using any dbd news as an excuse to advertise his leaks subreddit
---
Any of the losers would be great!  Either kid or adult versions!
---
every main in a nutshell we some times stray from them but they will always be our favorite. remembering my first games as pig.
---
I miss this
---
The game isn't that toxic. There would be equal toxicity on both sides if it was 4 killers versus 4 survivors.  It just comes off as just survivors are toxic because there's less killers than survivors.
---
Because people who sink too much time into this game like to feel superior.
---
If he or mr. X gets added I am quiting. I had enough nightmares.
---
Any of the losers would be my choice either kid version or adult!
---
That's the issue, since I just started I don't have access to any of the good perks/add-ons but everyone I'm getting matched against is running top tier survivor perks.
---
T I T L E  C A R R R R R R R D D

plz bb?

except for stupid fucking morons who message you for 0 reason after a game when the got hatch like”oMg iM bEtTeR tHen YoU I DiD 0 gEnZ AnD lET eVeRyOnE dIE tO gEt hAtCh iM rAnK 4!
---
Yeh some people just don’t know when to leave chases.
---
Well smurf is a pretty shitty thing to do anyway imo
---
Did you get a shit ton of iridescent shards with that lol.
---
Yeah I had a wraith literally follow me while cloaked and I could see his every movement, he should be a little harder to see because there's no add on to make his shimmer less visible.
---
He's good only when a survivor isn't paying attention and is distracted
---
I actually don't think may of the new people will run into that as much. And if they're willing to buy a whole new game just because of Stranger Things content, they're probably used to communities that can be toxic. Also, most of the toxicity is in end game chat (which you can toggle off) or reddit (which is avoidable altogether).
---
Nancy is best girl tho 😭
---
I don't get why not either. She's probably in my pool of main 5 I play, and I think I do better on her than any. her skill floor is fairly low, with a high skill ceiling with some of her addons giving some really interesting mind games and mix ups to playstyle. Her chase is very weak, but that's why you setup traps on the loops before initiating a chase...
---
Note: NEVER farm if it is Myers
---
I feel like he would be stepping on Clown's toes, then again they added Leatherface despite Hillbilly existing.
---
Get leatherface so you can unlock BBQ on other killers. 
---
After unlocking that, I'd strongly suggest going for a killer / build that helps you find people. 
---
Doctor is an amazing first character, and his lower terror radius perk makes finding survivors way easier in any killer. Hag gets you Hex: Ruin and her traps are also great at getting you to survivors once you get good at knowing where they go.
---
True That!
---
Secretly sell me one
---
WE DID IT REDDIT HYPERS
---
Real helpful to just say it didn’t happen like that and not explain what actually happened
---
I would unironically love that.
---
Shaggy would be a great survivor, and for the killer it'd have to be one of the classic villains like The Creeper or something.
---
Thank god for that or I wouldn't have Nurse's Calling... I tried playing Nurse ONCE and a survivor literally ran around me in a circle spam clicking their flashlight.
---
I used to main survivor, but taking up killer really breathed new life into the game for me and helped me understand some things a bit better. These days I play about 50/50, but playing killer really helps understand how to go against a killer as a survivor, while playing survivor helped me know common strategies to try and counter. I'm only rank 15ish for both, but I have a lot of fun with the game this way
---
It used to be only 500k
---
Oooohhhhhh......neat!
---
Jesus I nearly forgot it was like this
---
$59 price tag, no way that game could've possibly threaten DBD
---
That's so cute :3
---
It's freely available to anyone that cares. I'm not your mom.
---
kind of disappointed none of the screenshots are with the new map
---
Honestly, you should probably just ignore it. After all, they only do it to push their fragile ego, so its best to write gg, not care about them and move on. 
---
I cant play just yet but did watch some streams and especially a friend playing it, the game itself is fantastic and created by devs who seem to have the best for the game in mind, but one tends to meet quite a few toxic people. Its a drawback, but shouldnt keep you away from the game, toxicity will be found everywhere after all.
---
I wish you best of luck and which killers did you try? Would love to hear your opinion of them as a new player
---
I was honestly expecting him to say Bruh
---
Then just don’t reply to him if you’re not going to explain dude
---
Of all things I'm kind of upset that the survivor isn't will. I understand why, he's a kid so him getting hooked would cause a lot of issues and also being so small you'd never see him. I decided to start watching the show when this chapter was announced and it's pretty good only on episode 5 though
---
Maybe I'll have to try out killer after all then. I suppose it also couldn't hurt to see what exactly the killer goes through so I can get a better idea of what their limitations are for when I'm playing survivor.
---
Something REALLY fun but deemed too powerful after the PTB that will be nerfed just enough to make him a B-/C+  M1 killer once officially released.
---
Indeed
---
DWIGHT TIL I DIE!!!!
---
If you could get shirtless Myers but had to cancel this Stranger Things chapter from happening, would you do it?
---
That’s why you get a disproportionate amount of killer stuff on here. It takes 4 times as long to find a match as killer, therefore 4 times as much Reddit time!
---
Ahoy ladies,
---
Care to take a voyage with me on this ocean of flavor?
---
we already saw screenshots of it creating, and moving through holes to the upsidedown, we dont know what it does specifically, but likely a travel related power.
---
IT or The Shining is my guess
---
He can make portals on the ground, maybe som kind of stealth+teleport killer (wich Ive been suggesting for a while)
---
I mean the target audience isn't the same, a 30+ years old movie that's by far older than most players versus a current show.
---
More then 1 third of the game's killers will be shitty outsourced IP and thats ignoring the fact the trapper and hillbilly are literally just their version of leatherface and jason
---
Ok thanks!
---
yeah one time someone asked on a random dbd post if since he came back to the game if he likes it he himself responded he does
---
I want one, she's so cute!
---
Mmmhhmmm likely story!
---
Lel
---
Or I could just tell him that he's wrong if he's wrong and if he's curious enough to ask I'll spend time telling him about it? Tell me, where are these magical internet rules that you seem to want me to follow, so that I can tell you where to shove them?
---
Where are bioshock fans when I need them?
---
In the show he has telekenetic powers. He also is from another dimension called "the upside down" and he can break through to the real world through walls, creating a portal between dimensions.
---
i want one tooooo T\_T
---
People lump them together because they change the expected outcome at the last leg of the game. They are massively swingy perks. It isn't just because of some perceived fairness level. They have similar impacts and both literally affect health and speed.
---
Overcharge
---
We have the Trapper. He has traps! 
---
But really, Id think they would give Jason a bow&amp;arrow. Fits the camp theme, we could use another ranged Killer, and is literally the only kill I remember from the 2009 reboot.
---
The fuck are you talking about? All I’m saying is to just explain it in your initial comment so no one has to ask and wait for a response
---
That's... really annoying for OCD reasons... but alright, at least it's clarified. Thank you very much
---
My feelings exactly. I'm never pipping again.
---
Bro this epic!
---
Clam slam
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
I'd like to but I play on console so I can't :(
---
It's a different thing. Trypophobia doesn't just make you feel icky. It makes you have a panicky disgust that you will have a picture memory of days.
---
The game has issues for sure but fucking hell is it amazing when it works.
---
Getting everyone out the gates after a long match? Hard to beat those tense moments. Especially when you *Actually* sacrifice yourself for the escape of the others.
---
What other games let you play as Michael Myers, Amanda, Ghostface, Leatherface, Crazy Chainsaw guy, Crazy bear trap guy, deranged ghost and soon the demogorfan from stranger things? Playing as these guys and killing others players is amazing.
---
How can you be tunneled 30 secs into the match
---
Licensed killers got me into the game and I love it now. Can’t fathom people complaining about new content, especially content that brings in new players.
---
Jokes aside, having someone from scooby doo as a killer/survivor would be awesome, childhood nostalgia combined with a darker horror theme
---
Yeeees!
---
See, normally when people want to know something they inquire politely. If you'd done that, I would have responded appropriately. Instead, now you get a nice "fuck off you lazy bum. Go find out yourself."
---
As much as I hate Sodapoppin, this made me laugh.
---
I just kinda think it's funny how that pushes you over the edge but gore doesn't
---
Leave both as is and add a totem counter/noise notification when all totems are cleansed. My main problem with NOED is the surprise factor. If we knew when all totems were gone it would be  lot easier to handle
---
No known date confirmed at the moment. Most likely sometime next week.
---
But I’m not the one who’s curious about it, I’m saying it’d be great for people who ARE curious to have an immediate explanation without having to ask.
---
Basically, yes.
---
sounds way too Freddy-like to me tbh
---
False. Player model changes in clown mori.
---
So far I've played Wraith and Myers. I like wraith's mechanics and he seems to farm at lower elos, but I get the feeling he wouldn't be good at higher elos from being easier to outplay. I like Myers, but I'm struggling with getting my stalking meter to evil within 3 as I'm not really sure when to stalk and when not to. I can see why myers is a top tier killer. I'd like to try some of the higher skilled killers but I don't have extra money haha.
---
Earlier I dc'd for the first time in my life because I tried learning Nurse and a bunch of what I can only assume were smurfing assholes ran me around taunting me and just popping gens in under a minute, however the fuck that worked. Wasted a Pudding on that shit too. I just honestly didn't want to deal with that anymore.
---
I never dc, I always give a gg, but this was just the most toxic shit I've ever experienced.
---
Dude imagine the legion mori on one of those kids?
---
Puppers is good as well, and pretty positive all around to watch. Pretty sure my mediocre looping skills have improved some by watching puppers
---
Yeah. Because anything is possible with a pen and paper.
---
That harness hope from survivors is realistically just survivors dicking around while Killers enjoy being called Daddy.
---
If anyone is powerful, it is the players and this entity is getting the biggest dick of all time straight from them lmao
---
Well that’s obvious. Algorithms based on view count over a short period of time. How else would you make a trending list of videos?
---
Candyman
---
Time to camp steve til he gives us a free sample.
---
Steve and Dwight for the ultimate ice cream and pizza party combo!
---
What happend to bender
---
I don't see how it's overrated? Just because it's popular? You can dislike it all you want but the show is popular for a reason. It's well made, even if it doesn't appeal to you personally. Also, we had several original chapters in a row and we will be getting them again. They'll be back.
---
Maybe try spell check?
---
Yes it is common. I see it every 5 games give or take.
---
💙
---
Check out Ohmwrecker hes awesome!
---
💙 Thanks!
---
Thanks! :3
---
👀
---
Wow. It bit them. Original.
---
Very interesting find.
---
Fuck didn't think of her, now that u mentioned it
---
They never said that? Not sure where you got that information from.
---
&gt;Clown mori against Navi
---
galaxy_brain.jpg
---
Staged probably but gold. i love when killers are like this
---
Eh. He’s ok. I think his cockiness and overall abrasive nature kills it for me.
---
That’s just two it’s not spamming
---
Time to face camp that pretty face.
---
Oh I thought you were meaning that infectious fright was *worse* on Myers because of his limited terror radius, my apologies.
---
If your talking about it being a game yea its just a spectator and we are just a player having fun. LORE wise it is one of the most powerful beings, ripping time and space to capture victims and killers (and now monsters). Giving each side a some what fair chance so that survivors can hope to escape without getting one to many hooks in there shoulder and every time one gets sacrificed the entity eats there hope, saves the survivor, and the cycle continues.
---
I  used to have this as my cover photo! He'd fit well in the game.
---
The toxic ones are the ones who don't play both sides every time they get on the game. You really can't understand the game whatsoever if you play 5% Survivor and 95% Killer or the other way around.
---
Dude. Yes. Thank you so much for doing this for me cause I have no idea how to
---
WE gonna get run over by soy filled stranger cringest thing fans, because the devs are incompetent and will make the killer useless, as always and they gonna bitch about it !
---
You're lucky you got to 12...I'm still stuck on 16 *feelsbadman*
---
They have a survivor and killer tutorial mode where you play the game by yourself. You can play that as much as you want to get used to the movement. If you have a friend, you can do a private game (called Kill Your Friends) and you can run through all the maps for as long as you want.
---
Yes officer, this is the post that violated me
---
Got to work out a few small changes. If these perks became teachables and put on the right killer or survivor  in a combination of other perks who know what madness may unfold
---
Too much for dlc imo. The greed has been normalized with this attitude.
---
Thank you very much!!!
---
It's objectively a good show, but at this point might be over hyped.
---
Thanks for the feedback, the lodge does have 3 floors including the basement. And I agree that the lodge could be a really cool map. Now that I think about it, it would probably be more unique than the sanitorium too.
---
Like 11 usd

---
Yes it’s enough u need around 300k to 15 any char.
---
False, in the ptb you could see the finger bend so that it clips inside the hand and becomes invisible. They made it so you don't see it but it still happens.
---
Fair enough, atleast surv q times are pretty much instant on PC
---
Sorry you had to face toxic players, I play both killer and survivor but sfw only because survivor is too boring for me otherwise, not all survivors/killers are toxic, but in this game some survivors always have to be toxic no matter the outcome of the game because they think the game only revolves around them, don't worry about them or their made up rules for killers, just don't camp and don't tunnel and that's all you need to do to be a fair killer player imo, if they still complain that means there was no way to please them from the start anyway, of course if the survivors are toxic you can deal with them however you want I say.
---
are they going to fix the bug that prevents you from wiggling out, healing and leaving the exits?
---
It's been confirmed
---
You're not wrong sadly
---
i play on the normal ps4 and started playing again recently and it seems a lot better imo, comparing how it was a year ago its great now
---
A lot of multi-player games have a population drop-off after release and experience mini "booms" then drop-off when new content arrives. IMHO the skill required to enjoy dbd is WAY lower that shooting games/MOBAs/fighting games
---
I try to be respectful, so even if I'm against a toxic swf team I won't camp or tunnel anyone after hooks but that seems to make them angrier lol
---
There's one on feng.
---
wow your brain must be small if you can't understand what you're reading cause I clearly stated that I knew it was unreasonable, anger from bad games I had :^)
---
I don't need to adapt to something I'm already able to play against. However, educate me on how I'm supposed to adopt to erase a literally camping me and keeping me body blocked in a corner while all the generators and the exit gates get powered, making it so that the only way I would be able to get out of the game is by disconnecting and losing a pip. THATS what I was pissed about, you fuckim troglodyte.
---
Search ryona. Mk is popular among those guys/serial killers.
---
But one is agile and the other is shit.
---
When you see it's a SWF group, aka all loading in together.. just leave and ReQ.. i never understood whats so hard about this. You are in a new lobby in like 5 min. tops. Screw them.
---
OwO *notices your scratch marks while shifting*
---
He has very weak map pressure and once you begin playing against people who are aware of this you can be pretty hilariously abused. I say this as a survivor main.
---
Don’t worry comrade I’m charging my phone right now lol
---
Literally my friends
---
I love Puppers and Panda is really great as well
---
Its in kyf with only the two of them so prob would never happen
---
But for real i seen the most toxic cunts ever in dbd AND IM FUCKING COD PLAYER
---
Season 4 might reveal that demogorgan and other monsters in the underside used to be human though. What if they're just really decayed, gross human zombies that have been under the mind flayer's control for a long time? It's possible.
---
I would love to see the soltice killer from the show slasher
---
False. The ptb is not the game.
---
Yeah I really need to watch some videos. A few people here have made suggests so I’ll prolly do that
---
Just watch its gonna be blood warden, wake up, beast of prey and technician.
---
Only in DBD can I get the themed xpac I desire the most but get the two characters I hate just as much.
---
Yeah, gen rushing can be a bitch and is boring for everyone except the cunts that actively try to gen rush. It's a game, yeah, you want to win, but there's not much fun to be had playing only meta perks and making the game as short as possible. This game was meant to be a horror game.
---
Real talk, thought 3 was Mettle of Man
---
I thought this perk would also work really well for new people because a ton of newbies are going to flock to dbd for stranger things
---
Is there kiler role book for survivor?XD
---
If they’re arrogant enemies to get mad that they’re wrong, they’ll still get mad at you just implying they’re wrong. Might as well just help the people who are curious quickly, and just ignore the dicks
---
As a killer main. Killers who camp can enjoy low ranks
---
Literally every post I’ve made has been a hint besides this one. If you can’t figure it out at this point you’re on your own. I don’t believe in spoon feeding what should be competent people.
---
Yeah, but that lore really never comes into play in this game experience-wise, which is what matters. You can write down any lore you want, but if the audience doesn't actually experience it, then it is not very substantial.
---
Lore is still nice, but without a singleplayer experience of campaign to really cement and invest me into it, at the end of the day the real meat of the game is the multiplayer presence. And what is the multiplayer? A bunch of people memeing and fucking around for shits and giggles, which is great, mind you. But it also detracts from the over arching lore they are trying to establish. It is a complete polarization.
---
I have never felt immersed in the DBD lore, never felt any semblance of significance from it, etc. in the context of the entity. I have surprisingly felt immersed in the lore of the killers though.
---
At the end of the day, the entity is just a cosmic bitch lmao
---
Honestly, you could rip the entity out of the game, lore and all, and just explain everything that happens as random cosmic events and it wouldn't change much of a thing aside from the Hook sacrifices and EOG being out of place. I would rather the lore center more around the killers anyway and not some cosmic shoepaste pulling the strings.
---
Nooo
---
Survivors created the loop/cheese meta.. Nurse and spirit are simply the result of the situation. TBH it feels really good to hard counter some of the typical survivor cheesy BS w/ a mere right click.
---
Can't say i feel bad in the least.
---
Damn bruh. I think its gonna be territorial imperitive, saboteur, left behind and unnerving pressence
---
Idk, might be worth to get Devour Hope as well as ruin
---
Oh, that's interesting, so maybe there is hope for a more gruesome mori then, thanks for clearing that up
---
Not letting 99 on you means preventing him seeing you at all, I don't think it's really possible unless you are doing nothing lol
---
Better not have immunity to kindred
---
If short memory is the problem just run urban evasion
---
It won’t be unfortunately because it’s season 1 Steve
---
Nah I get it, if only BHVR actually surfed this subreddit.
---
The nonsense that's happening in games right now is mind blowing. Goal posts are getting moved further every day. Rock star has made a mother fucking casino for kids and no one has been arrested yet. I wanna support the devs. Steve in a sailor outfit is going to be hilarious but as an older dude I see how this next generation is getting fucked. $6 for digital haircut fucked. Shit mobile game monetization fucked.
---
I'm just saying that we saw what happened in the ptb, and even though you don't see it anymore doesn't mean it's not what happens. Besides the devs already said that they can't change the character model for things like gore and noris because they didn't design the game like that originally.
---
ew
---
Why did you believe DLCs were finished? lol.
---
If I get tbagged I take it as a form of disrespect. Just don't get upset when I nod at you on the hook.
---
Oh i know. Im just fucking with you. All but that first one. I got no clue what you are referencing with that one
---
They did, just wait and see lol.
---
You just gotta use him as an off tank not a main tank.
---
Wraith should be able to grab people off gens when cloaked. Spirit is allowed to do it while phase-walking and Michael can do it while in stalk. Only seems fair.
---
Dude, Bubba Sawyer exists
---
I happen to come across his stream and he’s positive and sweet. Not toxic, jaded, etc
---
For myers, a streamer I like to watch mostly stalks when the survivor sidnt notice you or is out of reach (through a window etc) until the meter is almost full and then activates it when he is about to hit ghe survivor. Maybe thats what you already do, but it seems really efficient and I dont know much about myers
---
Same here with the money, I want to play ghostface, but.....
---
Given what you just said I’m partially inclined not to believe you.
---
Im fluctuating between 12/13 on both Survivor and Killer!
---
I *really* don't think you know how game design works at all. And there a independent studio not Activation and this is there like only big game there budget isn't as big as you think.
---
Is this
---
It should use the music of the killer who is on the main menu like how it already does that in the pre lobby.
---
Yeah it happens...
---
I disagree, the game mechanics made by the devs created the loop/cheese meta because there is no other reliable or creative way to extend chases and not be instadowned.
---
Yeah. I'm only in my 20s and I see it too. Not even that long ago, the game was a complete game at release, no dlc needed. Unfortunately, with all the new multiplayer online games, they think it's hard to keep people interested without adding more and more content to the game, which costs money for the devs, and so they charge more and more for add-ons and dlc
---
you can
---
You would also be correct. Im not fucking with you. That was a lie. You been deceived.
---
Amanda isn't invincible in the movies, nor does she have powers.
---
I want that stalking sound back so badly.
---
Mostly just messing with you.
---
Well played.
---
Pennywise has almost limitless power but his thing is scaring people to make them tastier so maybe something like that.... somehow
---
Hah, yeah. I quite enjoyed watching Cr1ken, Bedbananas and Tomato doing dumb shit in that game
---
Not bad at all 👍
---
Myers still scares me.
---
Especially mid chase when I become exposed. That ghostface exposed noise gets me everytime. I'll scream like his every time
---
Nice ideas, can't see good ole SK signing off on these though.
---
Lot of survivors are sadly like that. They play the game like it's a bully simulator and the meta/devs let them. Main thing you just got to learn is when to quit a chase if it's not  going anywhere and pick the fights that you can win. Oh, and level HillBilly to 35 so the anti-flashlight perk starts showing in other killers bloodwebs. It's a good perk that sometimes just straight-up castrates a clicker who thinks hes better than he actually is.
---
What do you mean ew this couple is more beutifull than you or I will ever be
---
Been posted on here a lot already
---
Hopefully r/dbdgonewild doesn't find this.
---
When chapter 13 comes but your in an lawsuit
---
Personally, t-bagging doesn't bother me that much, but most of the time survivors do it with the intent of insulting the killer, which is why it's looked down upon, saying that being upset by it is pointless since it's just an animation is like saying it's pointless to be upset by someone showing you their middle finger since it's just that, someone showing you their middle finger, it's not the gesture itself that's upsetting, it's the meaning behind it, but I do see your point, it's a game, people insult others online all the time so we should't take it to heart
---
Gotta have something to do during the decade long queues
---
I follow Panda and he is energetic. Not the best player tho and kind of gets heated sometimes because of poor gameplay. He’s cool to me
---
There’s a sneak peak of the Mori for Demogorgon

Pharmacy. The last out of the 3 perks I don’t own that isn’t F tier and I think I would actually use a bit
---
i would DIE for this
---
Bender?this is the microwave robot from adventure time
---
I would be.
---
That is really shitty man, I’m sorry. I play about 5-10 matches a night and that’s never happened to me!
---
At the very least.. the nurse/spirit take skill to pull off. 
---
On the other hand, any 9 year old i pull out of Fortnite atm can easily run around in a circle for 4-5 min while his friends teabag.
---
More people should play Nurse..
---
But it doesn’t have balls. Only the facehuggers have balls...
---
I think they will do a mori inspired from bob’s death
---
Yesterday, FJ received many bits and subs (most gifted) and came across as a humble dude. He’s funny to me and I try to catch his stream as often as I can.
---
Looks great can't wait to see the finished version :)
---
And then Nurse can finally be nerfed, good plan. I like how you think Johnson.
---
It doesn't have to be your friends. On Xbox there is a looking for group option and you will find people of all types there. I have made a few friends just from there. You should try it
---
We don’t talk about fortnite
---
If it wasn't st people wouldnt play the game
---
It’s too late!
---
I'm pretty sure the whole community would do whatever it takes to get this skin tbh. I would.
---
Indeed fellow killer main can you wait until the demigorgon?
---
This doesn't even spoil anything?
---
It's any season Steve. They can give him whatever clothes they want. Why would they limit themselves to a season 1 version of a character? Lol
---
Good god that pallet stun was total horseshit. The killer was literally behind Jake
---
It’s juvenile and stupid but there’s not much to be done about it.
---
says the guy who uses emojis
---
btw nice troll account
---
i think a good compromise might be make him harder to see when he first enters stealth, and then his shimmer gets gradually easier to see over time to where it is at now to kind of encourage him to pop out every now and again to get the harder to see shimmer.
---
*sees the first autoplay video*
---
It's because of NOED

Steve's hair forces all attacks to have a 90% chance to not work.
---
[Here you go](https://imgur.com/gallery/FhXZyH3)
---
The demogorgon has chicken legs. Like Elites from Halo, or every Decepticon but Megatron  in the Bayformer movies.
---
Thats not the mori, that is just Steve downed
---
And I *really* don't think you know how to speak English correctly. Considering the number of licensed DLC they're buying, plus the price of the store cosmetics and DLCs in general, there is no chance they are on a tight budget. The game has pretty much turned into a cash grab and this community isn't making it any better.
---
I just had that happen to me. Had to restart. It happens every now and again where some game interaction just stops working. Couldn’t use medkit on myself, dead hard or wiggle.
---
I was the first hook, I'm never toxic, took him for a good chase but didn't even manage to stun him. Think he was just trash to be honest.
---
Really? My killer lobbies are instant and survivor lobbies are long. But also I play PS4 likely in a different area than you, so there are two there reasons why there us no magical fix
---
No problem, I think this one is way funnier anyway
---

---
Thanks :3 I’ll hopefully have it done by next month
---
I'd rather have them improve the main objective.
---
Instead of just holding M1 on a gen some gens need spare parts that spawn on the opposite side of the map, and they reduce your movement speed while carried (of course you could let go off them should the killer find you).
---
Other generators could require a code to repair, that's written on the walls of the basement (make that an interactable object, not a real code, as to not buff SWF)
---
Some gens might be just out if fuel, so you'd have to find empty jerry cans and fill them at a gas station that spawns at a couple different locations per map.
---
he looks so tall
---
It does sound like a neat idea, but it would suck for colourblind people, as it would probably highlight stuff in red.
---
Maybe Thursday. If you eat your vegetables.
---
I’m not sure but he’s paired with Nancy who I think he was dating in season 1 and the demogorgon was the main antagonist and they’re both wearing there clothes in season 1 so that’s just a guess
---
When does the ptb start??
---
Pulling people into the upside wouldn't be like freddy, its not a mental state. The survivors physically wouldn't be there anymore.
---
Um I will have enjoy killing them
---
Idk. But someone posted the power on a discord I'm in
---
I’ve won solo against bad Spirits. But I’m talking Spirits who make repeated, major fuck ups that would lose any killer the game. If it’s even just a decent Spirit you basically just hope for a hatch escape.
---
I recommend spirit she is 2nd best killer rn but it will take awhile to learn her playstyle so dont be expecting 4ks all of sudden,ghostface is a w+m1 killer and is good in lower ranks but will start to crumble during higher ranks due to no gen pressure which most w+m1 killers suffer from spirit is best choice for now
---
Tell them to stop please
---
Yes. Winter theme lovers RISE UP.
---
Not quite sweetie. It's not really my fault there are people like you who believe BHVR is doing a good job with their game.
---
Who is this
---
Just a swarm of mullets running through the cornfield
---
I know. They will never do it though sadly. They prefer B tier average not hard to play, not hard to escape killers now to appeal to new/not rank 1 survivors
---
I paired them just for the physical appearance resemblance, but good point haha
---
It’s better imo at least more fun
---
don't forget decisive
---
Epik
---
Having an a.i mimic you is a decent idea.
---
This meme always cracks me up, it’s so innocent but so truthful at the same time lmao
---
I'll be shocked if that isn't his default outfit tbh
---
Halloween and Winter theme!
---
I mean, you can just mute it and play whatever you want. Menu music is separated from in-game music
---
Good spirits are tough to beat for sure. You have to think like her, sounds cliche but its true.
---
Are you genuinely okay? None of these killers were free.
---
I don’t like it as much as you don’t like getting camped 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
Set max lockers and have everyone play dwight with head on and dance with me
---
I can't believe it! Genius collaboration! Love unexpected cross overs! 🤙🏻
---
If I'm not mistaken the dev team did say some time ago that there will be no children in the game, period.
---
I believe this has to do with a lot of stranger things
---
And they have a multitude of monsters to have as killers
---
I meant Velma of course!
---
I literally dont know how to be any nicer to some of these new killers though man, all I simply do is try to survive as best I can, I dont BM, and they rage quit. It's not my fault I looped you for 3 minutes straight just leave me alone smh.
---
we seem to have different ideas of what "hype" is
---
Lol why did this randomly get downvoted so badly
---
His meme was so time sensitive he couldn't wait for spell check.  THE PEOPLE HAD TO KNOW NOW
---
That doesn't fix the problem.
---
If you don't trigger the traps, *they stay there until somebody does*.
---
Nope. The monster rule was only there because a monster shape is not humanoid and would require a different skeleton. Xenomorph breaks all those rules with his posture and ginormous head. So unfortunately not.
---
Myres
---
Oh I am so down to have the scooby doo characters in dbd.
---
I like certain youtubers like noob3 but I only go on twitch when there was a streamer in my lobby and I want to go back and watch myself play from another angle.
---
We really need shrek as a killer
---
No it wasn't. That pallet 100 percent should not have hit the killer. How in god's name does a killer get stunned when the survivor is between the killer and the pallet?
---
There’s also two screenshots of an upside down portal on the steam dlc page, one with Steve and Nancy looking inside and one with the demagorgon emerging from it
---
Huntress and nurse are already super strong they can cry me a river
---
Scoops Ahoy cosmetic for hatchet mommy when
---
That’s what I’m referring to
---
PS4 only? count me out!
---
Been playing a while and on my main I usually have premonition, Urban evasion, empathy, and either self care, we'll make it, or Lithe/balanced depending on what I ~~think~~ hope the map will be.
---
Some people in this sub will get butthurt and downvote the stupidest things. Someone can make an innocuous joke and it’ll drop down to like -20, it’s kind of sad. Downvotes should be saved for truly useless posts and comments, not things people don’t like.

This is why I usually run kindred, even when they have insidious the other survivors will know they are camping and won’t come down there. 
---
It’s funny to see it as well, they camp and you can fully see their aura lol and you’re just like “well that’s not gonna work this time”
---
I deff think it’s the start of a mori!!
---
the new guy in town
---
Where did you find that out?
---
I'll pretend it happened. Thank you \^w\^
---
The wraith I find fun to go against because he's just easy to see, has anyone brought up the topic of him being too easy to see? Though I guess people don't wanna mention it because they don't want him being difficult to spot while cloaked
---
at release didn't he used to hit the bell 3 times when he spawned?
---
Why?
---
I love it
---
That’s way too much fucking money have they lost their damn minds
---
Pumpkinhead
---
Just wanted to specify since some people may not realize that
---
I think James really makes the show. The idea is great and everything but there's something about him that makes it really easy to listen to him for 20-30 minutes per video.
---
Ahh I see. I think there are a ton of things they could improve and tweak with this mode. Could even finally give us the prophesied 2v8 mode
---
Damn you're an impulsive buyer
---
Me too, beloved childhood show about a group of teen detectives that turns into a horror game where the teens are ones getting caught, yes please
---
I’m in the exact situation. It brings back memories of last year
---
Yoo shhh it’s Santa
---
Just search her name on Twitter and you’ll see all the screenshots of her saying black people should be lynched among other things. If you check Boxchi’s twitter, she “apologized” for it saying it was a really long time ago and that it was a harmless joke when time stamps show that this was happening in like January.
---
When does shrine come out?
---
Van they invest some money into restructuring the poor man's face?
---
Personally I wouldn't go into treatment at the start of the match, chances are you were going to bump into those survivors anyway and those screams can be really helpful later in the match
---
The scariest thing I can imagine is a good console nurse one day picking up a mouse and keyboard.
---
That's a real horror game.
---
It's gonna get wild when they start making out.
---
Naturally and artificially flavored
---
at release didn't he used to hit the bell 5 times when he spawned?
---
https://youtu.be/qRgw5jSHhz4?t=5
---
They are game breaking by ignoring basically all game mechanics.
---
Nurse is unbeatable at high levels but at low levels she's laughably easy to beat. People learning nurse are constantly blinking into trees or overshooting their target by a county mile.
---
From where do you have these ?
---
I didn’t see Neat tbag only David who managed to escape. Would suck if he got her killed because he was in the way
---
I mean to counter him just bring it every game
---
&gt;NaW
---
The only thing I could think of is maybe making him a stealth character and make him do jump scares and each time the survivors get jump scared they become more paranoid and less successful when doing skill checks.
---
Thats a too obviously choice to be discussed
---
I’m so happy console doesn’t have the ptb, hot take. If I wanted to play a survivor with no perks or a killer with no addons, having extremely clogged queues, people DC almost instantly and have none of my progress count for anything at the end, wasting all the BP I earn and use......
---
I’d just play on console.
---
Ouch poor demigorgon it’s gonna be like “reeeeeee”
---
What will the demogorgon do??? Be slow but walk through anything? And why 2 survivors, thats just 2 new (probably) op perk sets
---
Atleast, that's what a good friend would say.
---
TheEntityLeftHand. I think you'll either love it or hate it. It's something... different.  
---
He has his own persona and rules to play by. Mostly the only DBD streamer I watch.
---
The best way to learn to play DBD, other than practice, is to watch youtubers do it. There's a lot of really great, entertaining content on youtube that also helped me the learn game.
---
If your team did gens that means you got points for doing gens as well as chase. So why did u dc
---
Steam store, atleast in the Finnish version
---
Thats great and i respect your opinion, but i personally dont like it
---
Perk experiment *HYPE*
---
I feel bad for the people I usually test with, they'll probably be seeing more Doctor with Demogorgon's perks than the Demogorgon itself lol
---
Not gonna lie, nobody cares
---
Oh thanks, I'm new
---
That’s a good start. I’m looking for more of a 4th wall breaking style of killer that actively tries to scare the survivor players
---
His name is evan
---
I'm not going to equip Calm Spirit for a small chance I'll be playing against a doctor.
---
I just thought of something, you know how in one of the scooby doo movies they meet a band of 3 girls called the hex girls? what if the killer is that band and you can change between them like you do with the legion (granted they weren't monsters in the game but still) and all of their perks are hexes and each hex is named after one of them?
---
I will have enjoy looping as Steve
---
I feel as though natural selection went in a completely different direction though. Comparing the two is like comparing an apple to celery.
---
1st killer game: gets a rank 1 survivor eitht their rank 18 friend
---
1st survivor game: gets a rank 5 killer who just threw their rank to 20-13 because "its more fun" for them
---
Have you watched the series ?
---
Guess what? its happening, so deal with it.
---
Plenty of thigns it can do. And why would you complain about more characters to play? Most perks arent even good
---
Probably snapped from the endless loops and survivor toxicity. Playing Killer gets to you man.
---
you never seen billy bob thornton?
---
anyone know the price yet?  It’s usually 7.99 for 1 survivor and 1 killer. I’m assuming they will jack up the price for 2 survivors.
---
In addition to other commenters suggesting perks, you could also simply be way less hidden and out of sight than you think you are.
---
As killer you will find many survivors crouched thinking they are so hidden, but portions of the survivor model are actually peaking out, or I saw them run there before crouching, or whatever.
---
No, i havent, thats exactly why i dont like it ill probably watch it now because of dbd so yay for good marketing
---
Stranger things is probably gonna boost their user base.
---
Likes sneaky gameplay but stands on top of a hill and uses an ability to find a survivor that they likely wouldn’t have seen normally.
---
Haven't bought the game yet, but the fact they haven't added Pyramid Head or IT yet is astounding to me.
---
Either that or maybe it kills them like Barb and creates a pustule and drags them, screaming into it.
---
I think it’s great.. gonna bring a lot of new players who would’ve never even heard of the game.. and it’s gonna bring in a lot of money to help the devs
---
Think about me while watching it. You will love it!
---
No your on point i blocked him from popping up in my recommends i keep trying to watch his videos but they just annoyed me
---
If demogordon is possible then so is scooby survivor
---
Jason is stuck in Licensing hell unfortunately.
---
Damn. I actually liked watching this. Upvote earned, motherfucker.
---
We got some pretty sassy comments here from what assume are Stranger Things fans. I personally prefer when BHVR makes their own original killers/survivors.
---
how bout if it teleports using closets that would be cool
---
Did they update or patch it? I remember it being literally unplayable as some of the targets would get away at the beginning and soft lock you from finishing levels.
---
It seems like you don’t like reddit karma with a post like this lol jkjk 
---
To each their own I guess. I’m pretty pump, of course I’ve watched the series though.
---
Maybe, I'll be honest I am not all that familiar with Pennywise since I never saw the films or read the book. The only thing I know is that it is a shapeshifter that takes on whatever people are afraid of.
---
That is awesome
---
Ah yes it’s a dumb idea to do a great business deal that will bring loads of new players into a game lmao
---
Try running Iron Will, Quick and Quiet, and Dance With Me.  Also throw down pallets early to limit her advantage while she is in spirit mode, she will have a 50% chance to guess which side you are on when she phases.  Or you could just slowly walk away from the pallet when she phases too.  Usually she will unphase and strike at one side of the pallet and you'll be sneaking off in another direction.  Forcing her to guess where you are is pretty key to surviving against her.  Oh yeah, and watch for grass to move to avoid being gen grabbed.
---
The other screenshot in this promo has him on all fours
---
I’ve already thought the whole thing out except for his perks and abilities. He’ll walk around like he does when he’s sneaking around the people charging into his swamp. His terror radius will be All Star instead of the heartbeat, whenever he finds a survivor in a locker he’ll yell “what are you doing in my swamp?!?”
---
He can be similar to the clown except he’ll throw earwax bombs. 
---
His package will include donkey as a survivor, he’ll have a slower gen repair time but much quicker movement and sneaking because he’s on 4 legs.
---
I think I’m alone on this one, but I think a crossover with Silence of the Lambs would be really cool.
---
Plus more players from the hype
---
Yeah I get that I probably play more killer than survivor but I never just take it out on another game. I always try to play for a 12 hook game
---
Demogorgon is sad and his friends don’t wanna hang out with him
---
Wait what? Have not played myers in a long time. What stalking sound are you talking about?
---
You can't. Its why a lot of people don't even play Haddonfield.
---
He screm
---
might start doin that
---
It's crazy, they consider it a war crime, let me find you a couple examples that I ran into that were terrible. One was everyone calling a girl streamer a whore and that the only reason people watch her is cause she's a chick, all because she tbagged for a second in a clip. The other was freaking out at a survivor tbagging *when the killer wasn't even in line of sight*
---
This sub has problems
---
You’re just being pessimistic. Plus nothing in terms of perks or abilities have been released besides the photos on steam pertaining the demogorgon. And anyways, this was a smart move economically.
---
Both of them beat the shit out of monsters in the show so I wouldn't be surprised if there is at least one DS 2.0 perk or at least a meta perk.
---
I angy
---
Ohhh I meant the sound they removed when Myers was about to tier up. It would play a faint tune. It’s on the DBD Wiki page.
---
One day... one day
---
3 other survivors and you choose to get looped for 5 gens I'm dead
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/77444/swf-is-cheating
---
Dev comment in this thread from the website. They also said they want randoms to have the ability to play like swf in the future. They support voice chat. 
---
Why would they have swf if they don’t support it? Your argument makes no sense.
---
It's about the skeleton of the model, and how they would have to create new animations for an animal, if they did a creature that isn't easily animated as a human doing human things.
---
not when three out of the four survivors have it and are running the building :/
---
How?
---
You are actually an idiot and you should feel bad.
---
Except Bill.
---
Wow, I'm really hurt right now. Im calling the police.
---
You're one fucked up individual.... I like it
---
I never said we needed leatherface
---
Right? Dude just hasn't seen the show 
---
So he's probably one of those people that just hate on anything that's popular even though it greatly benefits the game
---
plug walk
---
Ever since I bought this game years ago, I always thought about how he'd work. Only thing I can think of is he has to tie them down or something? See, I'm still stumped.
---
There were better choices for leatherface
---
I've been playing for about a month, and have to say the community is pretty toxic, but the game is so fun. I'm trying to balance some of the toxicity out by letting survivors escape. I get my points maxed then just chase for fun without trying to kill. I try to make it super obvious that I'm going to let them live, but I still get tons of teabagging and people trying to troll the end of the match. Last night is the perfect example: I had hooked all 4 survivors twice before they ever finished a generator, and then I just watched them finish generator after generator. I gave a couple weak chases to them and injured all of them a few more times so they could get more altruism points, but made sure to never kill any of them. I even carried one of them to the exit gate and put them down. Got a message after it was over calling me a garbage killer. No you idiot, I'm not a garbage killer, I'm just trying to farm Bloodpoints so I can level up faster. Why can't I be a benevolent killer?
---
i wouldn't say trash but they could've made her better.
---
Trust me you are not the first one posting this. It's been spammed for hours now
---
+respect for dead meat
---
The way to fix it is by waiting for the map reworks to hit haddonfield.
---
I've had enough of this Quentin discrimination.
---
Us Quentin mains need to rise up.
---
Nah not at all. I love trapper for example and all he does is walk. But he is capable of being a threat in places he is not and can do so consistently throughout the entire map.
---
Just existing as trapper on a map can slow the game down as cautious survivors will proceed slower while in transit to the next objective for fear of turning their ankles into spaghetti.
---
Complaining and ranting are different, I thought that was common sense. Apparently not.
---
Pretty good job so far....🙄
---
Nice b8
---
Yea I understand that and most wouldn't, but there are people who snap and just ruin the next group after getting pooped on.
---
WELCOME TO THE KILL COUT WHERE WE TALLY UP THE VICTIMS IN ALL OUR FAVORITE HORROR FILMS
---
The Demogordon
---
Bill was like a month after
---
New Deathgarden Hunter too
---
Shortly after the trailer came out, so did the second episode of “Here comes the Trapper.” I think we all have a place in our hearts for Evan Mac
---
It’s the demogorgon
---
That and the Ashy Slashy's hardware store outfit originated from Season 3. Point is BHVR would be silly to ignore extra potential income for season continuity's sake.
---
I want my Scoops
---
I don't play it (ps4), but sounds fun!

Schmuser is everywhere

I feel that

Not there yet. Currently binge watching. Im on 3/3

What? Two survivors and a killer? For 11 dollars? That’s like, $3.67 for each character that is only optional to buy!
---
Demogorgon: you can't blind me
---
Survivor: blinds his nipples instead

Demogorgon: *insert surprised pikachu face*

---
Yo do you care to share a link to the icon pack you're using in this screenshot? I'd appreciate it!
---
Oh same here, and we're almost certainly getting it. BHVR didn't come this far nabbing this license just to ignore the best and most obvious cosmetic idea out there.
---
~~the universe~~ Michael is SINGING to ME!
---
They have to pay more for base game to get those
---
Imagine getting mori-ed by scooby
---
Bond is good even if you want to be a runner so you don't carry the killer to gens in work. It also helps a lot in not spending full time in the game. Even in party games I still get a lot from bond.
---
I have nothing to do, because Killerlobbies take 30 mins
---
Yay! 😊💙
---
Ruh Roh
---
It looks out of place anyways it doesn't fit with the game at all. Here you see claudette and nea and then here comes the cast of Stranger things, stupid
---
Thats a great sbubby
---
i also prefer original content but getting stranger things is seriously rad
---
Secretly sell me one for free via spirit world
---
Report the killer for camping &gt;:(
---
The 4 Percent you loose is still really annoying especially if you were super close so your friend can just sneak on over and finish it.
---
By the time the baby grows up dead by daylight will be dead and literally unplayable (servers shut down) because you fools pushes for dedicated survivors
---
Bad killer. I'm sure he will learn to close the hatch first next time before picking up another survivor.
---
Holy shizam. I didn’t know that. Thanks for telling me
---
This, because I really like the Stranger Things X Dead By Daylight theme.
---
Why not both?
---
It gets worse.
---
Three survivors (on separate generators for the first three, then joining up to repair the last two together) with Engineer Toolboxes and *no perks at all* still only spend two minutes (well, two minutes and 66/100th of a second) repairing.
---
People act like you can chase someone for 30-40 seconds and realize you're not making headway and break off to try and find another survivor, *but you really can't*; the Killer has to chase someone and abandoning one chase in hopes of another still leaves three survivors on generators, but if you find another survivor to chase it's going to be when those three generators pop and they only have two left, and those other survivors will have exhaustion perks and tons of pallets left
---
Spirit and Nurse both counter pretty easily, Trapper and Hag can as well.
---
I'd love that too, but he's not very well known. It would be awesome to see BHVR start adding some lesser known killers as well though
---
Yeah that's why the console is called "Special Edition". It includes a decent amount of DLC.
---
Would be cool, but it wouldn’t make character selection nearly as special.
---
Spirit doesn't ignore game mechanics. She can't phase through walls, windows nor pallets. Nurse however...
---
Sadly, the toxicity ramps up when new players come in, because they are not trying to get a spot on the DBD MLG eSports team, and therefore will be bullied by the veterans.
---
DAMN IT was just about to post something like this
---
This is my bet, I think it will make holes in between two places and can have maybe 4 holes open at a time

I played killer for about 3 weeks before I started playing killer. Chose Legion as my main killer, and absolutely love playing them.
---
Last time I played against her, they had placed traps in a bunch of narrow paths so when I went to escape I couldn’t get past her replicas. It was great. I learned exactly how she’s supposed to be played. I’ll be messing around with her later.
---
 U are 100 percent correct if u say tunneling is trash downvoted if u say tunneling is a strat downvote. It all depends on what time u post if the survivor mains on don’t post anything about survivor _______ op same goes with killers..  u can’t have an opinion on this sub at the wrong time
---
I would say that is what this trapper cosmetic references.
---
Real DBD/Siege homies on PC: hmu
---
I wanna listen to the 3 year theme again
---
Why is everyone so obsessed with Steve? He’s.. ok?
---
That's also time for the killer to find and one shot you. And to one shot more of your teammates. Cut your losses and get out. If someone is being chased, EGC lets them know that a gate is OPEN and to run that way for a good chance at escaping. If the gate is CLOSED then there's the windup animation to actually power the gate the rest of the way, and the animation of the gate opening, all of which add up to a guaranteed death. Thanks, I could have escaped but now I'm on the hook. You have no idea how many times I have to scream at my friends to just... open... the... fucking... gate.
---
If someone is hooked or on the ground, the timer slows to a crawl anyway and you'll have plenty of time to look for NOED if you need to unhook someone. If you can't find NOED in that generously slowed down time, your friend likely died on the hook anyway and you just wasted 2 minutes.
---
It doesn't but if you but a chapter in whole its 8 usd, 3 characters so it should be 12 usd but they will most likely make it even cheaper at 11 usd
---
Yeah you asked how I would do it. And the algorithms I was talking about in my previous comment are ones that put out relevant topics on trending.
---
Yeah. As a killer, it's only really fun to play against noobs as more seasoned players tend not to play this as a horror game as they do a strategy game, and as a survivor, you have to hope that both your allies and the killer aren't going to just play like assholes.
---
To be fair, the time he spends stalking, he could just spend running you down and get an M1 and you're one-shottable anyways. You can also throw down pallets early to constantly keep too much distance to prevent him from ever getting his EW3 on
---
r/nukedmemes
---
sit on my face, bubba 🤤
---
Why not?
---
I'm not I'm making a educated guess
---
The alien in the first film is a slow methodical killer who wasnt that fast sure it was quick when in the vents but that could play into its power having it be a slower killer that could break into a quick crawl and teleport around using vents.
---
What makes him have weak map pressure in your opinion then? Cuz tbh everyone runs bbq so often now with pgtw and ruin that anyone can have map pressure.
---
Q&amp;Q and Iron will.
---
Perks aren't explained in tutorial and by default the characters don't have them equiped
---
They probably Just pressed "play as survivor" "find lobby" and boom
---
Nah bro that’s Jacob from Trailer Park Boys
---
It was #1 yesterday
---
Fair enough.
---
I wish for some app or featire that lets us listen to all stages of chase music with some kind of slider (killer is close, killer is far, chasing) damn id pay for it
---
So that's the nerf they were talking about
---
Yeah you're probably right. Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one that actually checks out everything before going into the game lol
---
Good one bro
---
Can you secretly make me a Dwight version for a secret sum of money
---
Have an upvote!
---
Can you possibly send me the template or show me where to get it, I don't wanna just recreate it too tedious lol

PS4 player, too. Most painful part is having to wait and watch PC players play BOTH early. Smh. Luckily I don’t have enough friends to play siege with so I aint that worried.
---
Aka 5 usd
---
He does! I love his dbd videos!
---
Awww man
---
Aww man what a shame. I do remeber it now, thanks for the info!
---
but that was coming out of a hole maybe it was an animation
---
that is on steam
---
There screenshots on Steam :)
---
The Demogorgon is facing down and the camera angle is down, plus in the last photo there’s a running animation of Demogorgon that’s similar to gag
---
Its not b8, its my opinion lol
---
I would try to get really good at the mind games with spirit. Like the one where you can stand still and make them think you went in to the mode but then smack them.
---
So how long on average does it take to save enough shards for a new character?
---
This is with a daily free time of around 5 hours.
---
Dude your karma got fingerblasted
---
Not even joking, I think this could conceivably work.
---
Not sure about Scooby himself but maybe Shaggy and Daphne/Velma.
---
this meme is annoying at this point. everyone laugh at his funny joke!
---
Plug walk
---
Lol 🍕
---
I watched some videos and saw that a lot, i'm definitly gonna try that put, thanks for the tip!
---
That's awesome! Very well done
---
Yes. I really want some Stranher Things music to stick around after the Chapter
---
Dude just give up the killers dont have to be human
---
Thanks so much!
---
Yes, maybe you could have the whole gang as a single survivor and you can change between them like the legion
---
Is it at least a relative discount? How much more is the console version?
---
Okay thank you for letting me know! 😁
---
With those perks they should be a lot lower rank could just be trying to de pip or yeah dodging Freddy
---
Please “don’t” sell me one
---
I'd seriously buy one
---
I thought so
---
I just realized there's about to be a whole lot of memes for a show I've never seen before on here.

I’m running decent perks
---
“VHS Porn” is OP. Don’t fucking @ me.

No the survivors

Same, I was going to say goodbye to Kate and main Nancy, well, not anymore. It's almost like they intentionally made her look different from Natalia Dyer.

Well the trailer did have slicing and screaming. We thought the guy was cutting the girls mouth.
---
Same. Shout out to Otzdarva also

True. Gorefield isn't a Killer; he's a rival Entity.
---
Ahoy!
---
Picks the stranger things monster instead of the way cooler Xenomorph from alien. Ok I guess :/
---
Yes hello I will take 50 of these spirit children??
---
Break lockers?
---
That’s pretty homosexual if there is no upside down, even if it’s just on the one map
---
Whether you decide to tunnel or not is up to you. You can always bring Franklin's and possibly easily kill the key holder because of their desire to find their key. I literally watched a Nea set herself up for death because she was too focused on getting her item after I unhooked her. 
---
Moris aren't free kills, you still have to catch and hook a survivor to use it.  But they are far more frequent than a key. And I guarantee you, as soon as people realize you have a mori, they'll try even harder to avoid you. I'm not saying it doesn't suck to be mori'd, especially if the killer tunnels you. But mori's are a lot better now than they used to be.
---
How did you take that photo??
---
&gt;Except for all the quality of life fixes that come out every update 
---
Oh yeah, like the last one that reduced the distance of pallets back to 8 meters for some reason which makes looping more annoying. That was a fantastic idea. And still nothing that address how quickly gens go. Still nothing that addresses how broken SWF is. Still nothing on Instant Heal nerfs that they talked about almost a year ago. Etcetera and etcetera. Modifying the Elm Street map to be less cancer is one thing but by no means did they "fix" it. The school is still a horrible loop spot and the changes they made to pallets has been for the worst. 
---
&gt; and constant communication with the fan base,
---
They'll participate in your little meme bullshit and engage in anything harmless like Bunny Feng. But they refuse to address issues with game balance.
---
&gt; as well as bug fixing being a different team than content building...
---
That's not an excuse. You white knights keep using this as an excuse but it isn't an excuse. Does it not send a terrible message to ignore horrific issues with the game and keep promoting more DLC?
---
Same with The Pig
---
Yes daddy
---
With my phone haha. Sorry that you can see my hand. I didn't know how else to hold it.
---
Monstrous size has no intrinsic merit,unless inordinate exsanguination be considered a virtue. ;)
---
LOL
---
Doc can be annoying but people who DC are the scum of this community
---
Pyramid Head would be cool, but they still haven’t added Jason and he is a much better fit than Pyramid Head
---
💙💙💙
---
Crouch before you leave. Seems to work for me and the Gen doesn't blow.
---
this NEEDS to happen. The killer can be the jacked up Scrappy doo from the movies.
---
I'm still hoping for unique chase music for everyone. At the time I could understand how only Michael had it and I guess to an extent technically Freddy and Huntress have their own twist to their TR with lullabies, but as it is now, I think BHVR has enough resources to give everyone their own chase music, even if it is the same beat between the couple that we have but with just a single change or addition to an instrument like how their menu music works.
---
Our 5 most recent killers already have their own menu music, despite the base song being the same. I think this just falls under wishing BHVR would go back to before Chapter 8 (Clown/Kate) and just do a huge QoL update to all past killers and survivors and add more distinct facial animations, updated rigs, postures, etc. to make them all look more up to date. Since it was from that chapter on where BHVR started having a bit more creative freedom (I believe it's where they bought all the rights to DBD from starbreeze if I'm not mistaken).
---
It fits pretty good
---
Try to practice rotating L3/R3 in opposite (sometimes the same, but one quicker) directions in the beginning of your matches if you have some space. Adjust Controller Sensitivity to affect how quickly the camera will rotate as well. I'm not great at it but I've been getting a little better. Hope this helps!
---
Why does he only have 4 petals ingame instead of 6 i know its a little thing but its bugging the shit out of me

This is either b8 or you're incredibly simple.

Haha, that sounds dangerous

It's a beta player test beta
---
If ghost face happened, anything is possible
---
The music is from Yoshi’s Island and usually plays when something or someone is “screaming” that’s about it.
---
Yea, nea and Claud. The next thing you might want to do is get an exhaustion perk like Sprint Burst or Dead Hard to increase your survivability. You can get those from Meg and David King respectively. If you want, you can also grab We Are Gonna Live Forever from David too to speed up the grind
---
low rank survivors are deathly afraid of being found and Doc finds people
---
Sucks the navy? Thats alot of sucking
---
He also goes to the campfire. Only one is a lot more painful for him.
---
Also me: D2 Shadowkeep HYPE!
---
(Yeah it’s later, but just roll with it)
---
Than its cutting off 36000 shards off the grind which you can than use to get other characters.
---
Aight, thanks bro!
---
Thank god I won't have to deal with how good you'll get lol. With the nurse I know there is a trick to teleporting for the noise but you can do so in a way of staying in the same spot. Helps fake out the survivors.
---
#waluigi noises

---
Yeah they may be improving but at the same time they're still dividing their money and time incorrectly. Instead of giving us countless unnecessary cosmetics (half of which nobody uses, I mean come on when was the last time you saw someone wear the Fog Traveller's Strongman cosmetic on The Trapper?), they should be far more focused on the basic game and bugs that come from it.
---
My issue is that they care far more about how much money they can make from shitty cosmetics  rather than the game itself and that's poor game development in my eyes.
---
Aiming downwards?
---
I assume PTB will be next Tuesday?
---
A Dead Meat viewer. :o
---
So I'm not the only one! :o
---
Ah, yes.  
---
How many people do you think'll be pulled in because of this?
---
Disney owns the Alien franchise, good luck getting anything licensed from them
---
Recently took a HUGE SHIT. Best ive ever taken.
---
Best comment. I'm dying 😂
---
Wait... why have I realized Jonathan could play Leon Kennedy?
---
Shh, you're going against the circlejerk
---
We get a few good survivors perks, it's just outweighed by people complaining about the shit ones.
---
For every comment praising borrowed time i see twenty complaining about his generator perk.
---
I just want perks that fill a niche without being temporary fixes to long term game problems, like tunneling or camping.
---
Actually the opposite for me. They always break hg first.
---
^ adrenaline was bugged against Freddy to work like in the movies, but adrenaline realllly hurt old Freddy
---
Technically without cleansing she becomes an infinite instadown killer. Like tuft hair micheal but instead of lunge you get much easier survivor tracking becauase of how much they cough.
---
When's there miscarriage reveal? .......
---
Ikr I swear as soon as I saw it the trailer with the music I knew that this would work but I didn’t know it would fit with the Stranger Things intro so.... 💯💯😂🔥😇
---
Shaggy would be immortal
---
I'm not sure if this question can have a real, specific answer. But, this is tied to XP, so here's something on that, if it helps! Depending on your skill level/how you play, try looking up the rewards and amount of experience points needed for each consecutive level-up. 
---
You get a daily bonus each day for your first killer and survivor matches. 
---
Also, look out for perks/offerings that increase your BP payout. Sometimes, a little motivation can go a long way. Good luck!
---
I first wanna grab bbq tho, since i mostly play killer zo far, but after that i'll try and learn to play survivor, i watched a lot of noob3 videos, so i learned a bit from that aswell
---
Oh very nice! I like that. I love learning new things about the game.
---
I don't get it
---
My blood valentine?
---
It could be bc of the item u have to.. I know some killers will tunnel if a survivor has a flashlight, key, sometimes even a map if they have ruin or another hex
---
Fs for the console bois.
---
Possibly. I'm on ps4 and have never played her but have seen many pc nurses do that. Just know nurse is top 3 I believe on pc right now.
---
God bless this community. Please god. It needs you. Really bad.
---
Um, I actually think it's looked and been running a lot smoother lately since the bigger updates. They'll always have kinks to iron out, but I truly don't see what all the commotion is about.
---
Sigh.. in original scene Steve actually yells 'Henderson' for Dustin Henderson, i changed it to Denson for Kate Denson
---
Lol Santa want to give you a finger
---
Wasn’t a locker reference more so a reference to all new players playing Dwight lol
---
NO
---
Tutorials also give you Bloodpoints the first time, so make sure you use them wisely.
---
They don’t really get to “pick” Stranger Things was making deals with tons of video game companies and BHVR was one of them
---
Then he’ll take a finger
---
I wanna buy 50. I love spirit so much!!!! 
---
I'd buy another 50 of Trapper boi if you ever make more x)
---
Haha 👻
---
except literal nobody plays it.
---
I  n e e d
---
Not even ashamed to admit. Im basically only gonna play Steve when he drops.
---
The dash is pretty fun to play with on certain loops! :D
---
Yes for it to then be nerfed a few weeks after 🙂
---
I believe she is the number 1
---
This is a general rule for many developers. You can never kill kids. I mean that's just fucked up.
---
Me tooooo! Trapper must be next!
---
Best comment 😂
---
Ohh I didn't know she was kate denson
---
Thx bro
---
I am usually able to get a pip if she isn't using prayer beads. On Xbox I do pretty well, on PC my escape rate is probably lower, but I've only been on PC a little while now, the tactics are still the same.
---
Goodbye sexy David, hello sexy Steve
---
I want Nancy
---
I havent seen the show yet i think its really cool. It helps the game devs, gives us two new surviviors, a really cool and hopefully unquie killer, and an indoor map.
---
When’s the last time we’ve gotten an actual meta survivor perk? Deliverance is all I can think of and that came out last year. The reason why people talk about crappy survivor perks is because there’s oceans of them in the game and the meta for survivors hasn’t changed at all. Infectious fright, discordance and spirit fury has changed up killer meta but survivor meta has stayed the same which is super boring.

Confirmation bias
---
He'll have to catch me first
---
That’s more reasonable than your other posts and a fair point. +1
---
To be fair, licnsed content gives the devs more money to help them make the game better, and brings in more players. So i think a mix of both is good.
---
How you feel about Ghost Face then?
---
Would not surprise me. Billy is 2 I believe. Good luck though, I hope it goes well.
---
Soon...
---
So either a stream or overview video and then PTB dropping right after.
---
Exactly like who cares if it's something licensed it's brand new stuff being breathed into the game
---
Ok but there is no spoiler in this post lmao
---
That's the spirit!
---
Here's some advice: try to get as close to chases as possible. Either by being chased or by looking at someone getting chased (This doesn't mean you should stand by and watch someone getting chased though). Playing immersed (Aka overly stealthy) will only lead you to panicking once you get found. I found the best solution to be learning how to loop and juke from my chases and from.other people's to have a base to rely.on if i get found.
---
Throws a bottle that poisons you *kobe*
---
Don’t you have a locker to hide in

Sincerely, a Nea main (pls no killer jokes thx)

If it was just teleporting through what looks like tunnels, it'll be a lesser Freddy 2.0. The Demigorgon has to have something else.
---
If they ever do a Rated R Scooby Doo movie then fuck yeah
---
Only if she manages to get you sick  but yea I get your point and agree
---
Bubba can CUURRVVEEE around those trees and hit those pesky survivors. Billy just bumps into shit.
---
Timing does matter. Alien is great, but they don't currently have an insanely popular TV show with mass appeal. It makes much more sense for them to capitalize on what's popular right now
---
Hell no, we don't need another Nurse tier character. Nurse completely breaks the game and has no counterplay if the person playing her is competent.
---
Closest thing we have to Nurse power wise is Spirit and she also suffers from lacking reliable counterplay. If anything we need something like Billy or Huntress again, something that's strong but can be played around if the players are good enough.
---
I can’t imagine “piano melody” as anything other than Giorno’s theme. Maybe I spend too much time looking at jojo memes

Yall remember when we couldn't kick Gens?

Thanks &lt;3
---
I dare guessing that atleast 10 people are going to permanently stay and the others are going to run away when they go against most of you toxic assholes.
---
Something similar to Myer's Evil Within except more focused on brute strength than chasing
---
Use a good headset especially on Killer. Your ears tell you a ton about what survivors are doing. At lower ranks they will hop in to lockers and all kinds of stuff way too close to you, and you can hear them clear as day. It will help you track them down when they are injured and healing too. 
---
Realize the goal as the killer is to slow the progress of the game down so you can catch and kill the survivors. Camping doesn’t help you much and only teaches you bad habits early on when playing as the killer and you lose bloodpoints being too close to the hooked survivor so it’s counter productive. You want to try and control the map, keep them off generators and slow their generator progress. Playing killer requires patience. It is a slow burn to victory.
---
And if thats the case i imagine it will have some kind of second power, much like freddies traps. But i have no idea what
---
I always mute my tv and have youtube playing with my fav theme.
---
That's what I'm thinking, but it's not enough. I'm thinking it might also have the power to implant children demigorgons into a survivor and they would work as trackers. The survivor has the ability to take the baby out but at the trade off of a health state.
---
We dont know if the teleport is his only power which i highly doubt it is.
---
Lots of people come for the licensed content so it's always good to see some because it means there's going to be some fresh faces by the campfire
---
Holy shit I'm going to make this meme you genius
---
How in the fuck is this not a spoiler?

Anything directing somebody to research through the gamepedia is going to be a lot of help, honestly. I always recommend this site to anyone who starts.

Unrelated, bless Peanits for now and ever more.
---
I have a decent headset with crystal clear quality, so sound should be no problem, after i pockednip spirit, i learned (and still am) how to follow scratch marks better. That leads to lockers etc as well.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
My name is yoshikage kira
---
That's actually a super helpful response, thank you!
---
Its new content, brings new users to the game, helps the devs get more money to make it easier to support the game. Orginal or not, does it matter? They could just reuse the same powers from same Myers or Freddy on a unquie killer anyway
---
I'm confident they can. I just hope it's good/fun to use.
---
there’s a tutorial.
---
I also hate camping, so i never do that, only when i think they will get rescued i look back and if i see movement i go back.
---
Oh my god I want this DLC
---
Lmao it means you bad at game
---
Glad I waited in a lobby for x minutes just to die on 1st hook cause of an asshat. Yippeeee
---
I, Michael Myers, have a dream
---
I feel nothing towards the f13 devs they are the true lazy useless ones even before the lawsuit dropped. Yet here people do criticizing behavior as the bad ones even though they actually work on their game.
---
What does it spoil?? They they are eventually tied up in a room? There is no context.
---
If they did this to a xenomorph.. no crawling people would lose their minds. Literally looks like vortigaunt from half life. "extra terrifying"
---
I thought it was going to say. "My name is Jeff".
---
It's an old meme but I remember it fondly, lol.
---
disturbed vision
---
But if another survivor is literally walking into you and you don’t swing? Wouldn’t you rather have 2 injuries survivors that you could potentially chase rather than one? Statistics don’t add up
---
You just linked me like a 10 page long topic, about people complaining about SWF being a massive advantage, and ruining killer experiences....
---
With a comment of a dev, saying that voice coms isn't bannable... 
---
If he has a different comment somewhere in that 10 pages, feel free to quote it. I honestly don't feel like digging for it.
---
Jane checking her mani like "Damn... He really snacking on these shits?"
---
It would’ve made so much sense to put Billy in this dlc
---
What I mean is, his power is fair, because it's trade off for later pay off
---
you don't have to attack another content creator because a vid didn't get #1 on trending
---
I would legit become a survivor main for any one of these guys
---
*Laughs in hag main*
---
Granted I call myself a "dailies main" because of the shit wait times for killer and complete bullshit that is solo queue survivor.
---
Dunno why your being downvoted your not wrong. It was nothing but a patreon or whatever they used to get support to begin with then they turned it into a cash grab and dipped.
---
LMFAOO everyone in that thread is so sad. Why the hell are they so pissed off? Half of them are probably ass and get flashbacks to when they couldn't catch a survivor the whole game and he was t bagging them.
---

---
Your power is shit, I mean. You can't even hit survivors, all you can do is help them repair generators. Worst killer in the game.
---
^^^^^If ^^^^^you're ^^^^^gonna ^^^^^make a Locker Dwight joke, I think it's fair to be hit right back with a Killer Nea joke.
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
That’s kind of setting them up for disappointment when people finally quit and the “not being toxic”
---
DBD is toxic, it’s in its very DNA. New players or not it will be. Besides most of them aren’t gonna stick around and even still most of the viewers won’t play the game at all.
---
If it actually happens I'm inviting going to sacrifice all of my items,add-ons and offering on all survivors to the entity
---
Lolol yeah cuz the killer doesn’t have all the strengths in the world to catch a survivor they tunnel
---
I don’t get it
---
Grow up already. The chapters happening like it or not. I'm sure youd be posting about it if it was some other licensed character you wanted.
---
As nice as it would be for my childhood to have Shaggy in the game, it’ll be more devastating for my childhood to see him murdered and put on a meathook
---
Spicy saves.
---
Props to him for at least not DC'ing as soon as he hit that wall lmao
---
So when he gets rage mode all form of stuns like the Shotgun and Flare gun is just useless now? Man that is shit, Rage mode should just reduce stun times not negate it completely.
---
Even if people are throwing themselves at you to stop the tunnel? Like cmon now
---
I want to hear Velma....SCREAM.
---
I know but I hear locker and Dwight in the same sentence and couldn't help myself xD
---
King boo from the nintendo's "horror game" luigi's mansion
---
It's one of those moments when someone tries to meme and fails. Pretty embarassing.
---
all the poor baby Nancy’s and Steve’s that are going to die XD
---
Damn, what kind?
---
Nea is getting sunglasses?
---
Oooo like the killers are so interesting. Half the interesting stories are licensed chapters anyway.
---
No worries, you learn this stuff as you go
---
I like how we have to give killers props for not being a total bitch and ending the entire match for everyone... survivors are just as bad but at least it doesn't literally end the game if 1 of em DCs lol
---
Even when other survivors are throwing themselves at you trying to stop the tunnel? Wouldn’t you rather have multiple people injured?
---
I don’t own Netflix, so I haven’t watched it either! Though my friend now INSISTS he give me his account so I can watch it so... :P
---
Licking fingers now?
---
It'll probably still just blind it.
---
Nurse has her eyes always covered and can still be blinded.
---

Doesn't look like it, m8.

Probably got ran around all game and needed this sacrifice.  I love when it gets denied.
---
Ah, didn’t realize that was a fairly recent acquisition
---
Fortnite got a Stranger Things crossover before us. Now we are getting it. Fortnite also had a John Wick skin. Soon we will be getting it!

Well i guess i learned my lesson about saying my opinion on the internet i might as well kill myself next time i say something is dumb fuck this i worked for all my karma then one post about me saying a dlc is dumb and i get fucked over thanks r/deadbydaylight ill make sure next time before i call a dlc one of the tamest words in the english language ill think about you toxic fucks
---
They come up with good idea for perks but purposely make them so weak its unusable.
---
For example, peddle is a good idea in theory but its so weak.
---
more likely as a killer ...
---
I don't really like it if I'm going vs it, it's good if I'm the one playing him.
---
He was super ez to reveal on the ptb, so they fixed that and made it harder to reveal him. Thing is that it's awfully buggy, sometimes you can stare at him and not reveal him while you are getting exposed, othertimes you will reveal him when he's hiding behind a wall. That makes it occasionally really frustrating for both sides.
---
It's easy for him to stalk you, while it is hard for you to reveal him. It makes the stalk denying thing pretty one-sided, which I am not a fan of. Also him being able to 99% stalk you and you keeping that 99% seems pretty unfair to me. If myers 99% his power he has to spend it all during those 60 seconds, GF doesn't have to deal with any of that, if he stalked you before then you're 100% getting exposed next time you run into him, which is kinda ass cheeks to experience.
---
So was Ash :/
---
You’re too nice of a person to be playing this salt infested game lol
---
You being ironic?
---
You know this billy was screaming when this shit happened, and I love it.
---
and a new haircut
---
Followed up by a gen explosion 🤣🤣
---
Yeah I am on pc and still don’t do PTB. I’m okay with waiting!
---
I'm actually cool with just watching videos showcasing things. It won't take away from the hype of the actual release
---
Wouldn’t you agree, Jake Park?
---
More like he was rightly compensated, then saw what a profit a product he didn't belive in (and that's why he got upfront payment for) made, and wanted more. Same thing that happened with the witcher basically
---
Ace is Steve's uncle. Its staring us all in the face!
---
There is a magical fix tho.... crossplay. 
---
Sadly, its just a wild dream lol.
---
Why? Most placeable killer objects can be messed with why shouldn't this one?
---
For sure, but there’s no point getting salty at them. They just feed off it. Just sent him a message saying something like “gg, didn’t realize that was an add-on. It’s pretty cool.”
---
They are teenagers.
---
If the demogorgon is low tier I will cry myself to sleep, but hey atleast we will have S T E V E
---
They could never put shaggy in, everyone would be too afraid to kill him. The entity would have to put him under binds to limit his power. And he wouldn’t make a good killer either, because shaggy would bend his knee to no man, creature, or deity.
---
They are having a live stream talking about the Stranger Things chapter. Pretty sure PTB will be next tuesday.
---
Finally, somebody who’s got their priorities straight
---
Just think, 2 weeks before the release date, which is Sept 10-11.
---
Time to checkout ScorpionZ on YouTube.  It only is pig viable, but without Ruin! GASP
---
I think the theorized date is next tuesday so the 27th? Theres a dev stream this Thursday though so they might announce it then for certain.
---
Mate the fackin pinned post in stranger things
---
Thank you very much!
---
Im only in rank 18 as a killer, I started playing the game a few days ago and in half of my matches people has cleansing as their top priority and in the other half nobody cleanses, and another question, is it recommendable to use Infectious Frigh + Distressing?
---
Lol yes
---
Yeah, especially considering how Scooby Doo was inspired by different horror and mystery medias and has indirectly inspired more of them. What costumes would you hope to see?
---
I used the search bar and switched to new post for this answer. Not trying to be a douche, but there are a bunch of post with the same question.

---
Except you do because once the survivors reach a high enough skill level they are literally untouchable by all but the top three killers. Skill doesn't matter for killers except when playing those since they rely on survivors making mistakes.
---
Is it 7 a chapter? Then it will probably still be 11 or maybe even 10 for this chapter. It's pricing is a difficult thing to do on anything
---
It's not about that it's the way they divide their money and people working on the team. You cannot honestly tell me that they need to spend so much money on making new cosmetics that aren't even that good instead of having a bigger team working on fixing bugs and testing things before they release a patch.
---
*chuckie chuckles*
---
looks like the person saying there were portals to the upside down was right. he said hooks were there and gens in irl. let’s see how right he is
---
Exactly lmao
---
They probably want to show killer gameplay and survivor stuff on their live stream this Thursday THEN let it playable on test server next Tuesday so people have better understanding of the killer and perks
---
Probably your internet. But i dont know how to fix it.
---
Have you contacted the devs?
---
F (or X, if you're on console)
---
that is god damned adorable.
---
Captain Ahab or Redbeard, so people will finally get a pirate killer.
---
and september has a friday 13th
---
Oh these are super nice and pretty. I love them!
---
I like it here.
---
I stand by my statement
---
It's so weird, because yesterday I waited literally one minute and I got into a lobby as killer and today it took me almost half an hour...
---
why would that happen any soon tho
---
Yeah! I wanna floss whenever I stun the killer and get flossed on while I'm on the hook.
---
Thats a theory i also have, maybe its my internet but i've had the game working perfectly fine with the same WiFI i have currently, and no i've not contacted the devs yet but im planning to do so
---
Big ass sky spider makes sense
---
Next Q&amp;A we should all ask them that
---
when does it come out on ptb?
---
Huh downvoted with no comments must be my birthday.
---
Nancy gang clocking in
---
You're definitely right lol
---
I cant wait to see demogorgons ability
---
I was under the impression that the John Wick movies weren't really horror, so he wouldn't really fit in DBD. I haven't seen them so feel free to correct me
---
Just because survivors can stop the power doesnt auto mean its weak. Freddy is still close to top tier, and for all we know it can take like 20 seconds to close a portal thus wasting alot of time
---
You get the feel for where it is after a couple games
---
might just be you
---
I think there comes a point when you're actually not new anymore, you're just not a veteran yet.
---
b r i e f l y
---
I'd suck the killer off and hope he takes mercy on me
---
We both know they started drawing as soon as the teaser got out.
---
If you want to stay stealthy and do gens you might wanna use poised, it makes it so you don’t leave scratch marks after doing a generator
---
Hope it was fun
---
I always liked the killers stories. The doctors story is classic horror
---
I hope not, that would just make the SWF gen-rushing absolutely terrible
---
I find Bond the most helpful of the 3. Alert would be helpful, but I think you get more usage per game out of bond. You can tell when someone is running around like crazy and throwing pallets that they are being chased just as well as with empathy or alert. And you can see what is going on more of the time than with empathy.
---
This sub is nothing but dated memes driven into the ground and made unfunny
---
Is benevolence medal broken right now? I'm getting a red medal every game regardless of my performance.
---
Yeah, there’s a possibility that it could be something that debuffs them when they interact with it or perhaps a trap of some kind
---
Yea I think Ghost Face is a high tier killer. Like he is a better Wraith for starters. He can attack during Night shroud without needing to uncloak, so he can sneak up on them especially maps like the game or Lery's.
---
Bruh, I cant understand half of what you typed. Basic grammar is a must. Also seems far too complex for new players to understand.
---
I think you're gonna get more than just "making out" if you ask there.
---
perhaps its a teleport thing. like the demigorgon can place a few of those around the map and then when he hops in one he can instantly crawl out at another
---
and the survivors can destroy them but it takes time
---
I like urban evasion, self care, dead hard, spine chill
---
Oddly enough OPs video is also a huge shit!
---
It changes when you change your killer to their theme.
---
If you want to be a ninja you'll need sprint burst with that urban evasion. 
---
Out of the 3 i'd use empathy, because it's map wide and you can see the chase most of the time, and see if the killer breaks chase, and lastly give someone rubs instead of them wasting time selfcaring
---
you misspelled N A N C Y
---
Seconded if you’re emphasizing on gens. Alert could probably go well with it too. Most killers perform break actions many times a match- save tryhard nurses. It will give you plenty information like where they are in the first place, where they’re going, they might put a trap nearby- etc.
---
Shaggy the interdimensional god as a killer? ALL my yes!
---
Prepare for the almighty ZOINKS!
---
Why even care..hmm, maybe because against rank 1 tryhards killer's tier means something?
---
I’m surprised we still don’t have a survivor perk to make bleeding disappear faster.
---
You could just not flashlight her
---
Trapper.
---
Ghostface was Ash's killer
---
He literally didnt even post a link, I couldn't compliment it if I wanted to
---
Poor Jason
---
Saaaame, I always thought the noise in the bloodweb was part of the song until I realized it wasn’t. It’s a weird memory but whatever lol
---
Why not, I'm opened towards new survivors' perks that ARE NOT FUCKING ZERO BRAIN CRUTCHES LIKE DS OR MOM.
---
...Today?
---
We'll make it.
---
It exists.
---
Wham bam thank you ma’am for the clam slam
---
I think it’d need to have another bonus effect to be worth it tbh. But that’s just me.
---
I love David and I love this perk, and it would be fantastic if it were reworked like this to actually give the perk some use besides building blood points. I'd no longer have to choose between making bank and wasting a slot, or getting only about 20k and having four perks
---
Why is this so funny😭
---
They've patched the exit gate bug, but it returns. In the last patch notes I believe they stated they added additional logging to try to determine what triggers the bug.
---
They're working on that one.
---
Theres like 2000 recent posts talking about Steve lol....
---
So is Alien :/
---
 I know what it is, I’ve watched the show I haven’t watched the new season but the demigorgon was a forgettable monster in the face of the main characters (I thought they were pretty good)
---
The shotgun, Pamela's sweater and knives still stun him. In other words, the 3 rarest stuns in the game, but everything else just bounces off of him while in Rage.
---
I mean, losing the killer easier and combo with iron will or dance with me seems pretty decent.
---
I’d say she’s a keeper, because I fear what may happen if you decide otherwise
---
They’re not gonna do that cuz we’ll make it exists. They won’t entirely kill a perk to improve another
---
s h ip
---
That is just the regular McMillan Estate. I don’t see any difference in the ground or fog. 
---
I googled the McMillan estate DBD and didn’t see any differences I could notice in the pics. 
---
Am I missing something?
---
They'll pretend he has eyes but we don't see them.
---
Mah boi Big brain with the even bigger plays.
---
I know right. I love extra bloodpoints but wasting an entire perk slot just to get extra bp doesn’t always seem worth it. Hopefully they’ll rework it soon.
---
I love it, I'd replace dead hard with  sprint burst on a stealth build to get the burst away from the killer so at the end when I'm out of sight I'd urban evasion around some rubble to hide and go back to the gen
---
PTB - No confirmed date, most likely next week.
---
DLC - No confirmed day but will be out in September.
---
not sure if its a good thing or bad thing... but yes...
---
Have you escaped yet?
---
Finally a decent shitpost
---
I bought the game with the DLCs for The Doctor, Leatherface and Michael Myers but Im leveling the Plague first of all.
---
Thank you again!
---
I get that a lot to. Depending on the console it can worse. Xbox has been really bad due to the game being on gamepass and the excuse most killers are giving now is the classic "I know it's toxic, I'm just trying to get better". I hardly touch Playstation anymore. 
---
Killers are just really bad in general on consoles. PC has it's moments, but I find them to be far more skilled and better at playing the game within the game.
---
OP is a sweet summer child and expected today to be different than any other day.
---
Is there a weekly thread of LFG on fridays? I'm not insanely active on reddit and even less so this subreddit. I just want a group to play with but saw in the rules that there is a thread for those weekly.
---
She does keep humming this weird lullaby each night..
---
Don't work on a gen right away, gen repair noises are loud, wait for him to either do his first pass or start chasing someone else first
---
I find funny that this guy gets downvoting for expressing his feelings and giving his opinion without any aggression or hatred about upcoming chapter. You disgust me, people.
---
This is my last stand, i would like to say to all people who have commented on this post. STOP. Please, youve done enough damage
---
Omg this is so adorable
---
Dwight's perks are already swf nightmare fuel
---
Someone tweet this to bhvr
---
Of course if they where gonna release a stranger things dlc now if not even earlier.
---
I don't get mad at the butt dance. I interpret the gesture as a way of telling me you want my attention, so I'll give it all to you while you hang from the hook.
---
Shut up and be nice
---
What's your channel my man
---
He won't escape. I won't let him.
---
David/Huntress’s chapter is free meaning it’s essentially a base perk. We’ll Make It isn’t a teachable and can be flat out removed if the devs want to. There’s literally zero reason to not want this change if you like We’ll Make It or WGLF, if anything it’s a buff.
---
☺️💙
---
I. NEED. SUSIE!!!
---
She's throwing hatchets at me each time I try to go to the living room, so I'm having slight troubles. My roommate is probably hiding in a locker too, so thats not helping.
---
Imo it looks like they are tearing something off of the portal, which makes it look like they are trying to open it, at least to me. If they were breaking it wouldn’t it have the glowing orange stuff?
---
Chuckie, new killer confirmed
---
I'm only like level 15 survivor and I have Meg at ~30, Claud at 38, David at 35, and I have about 100 hours. The grind is real
---
“a part”* two words
---
And I...  Am a smurf swf at red ranks.
---
It needs to be easier to get tokens, but it should not get an extra benefit like BBQ has.
---
You husband now.
---
Aww thanks! Will do 💙
---
Demogorgan looks like he’s about to trip in this shot
---
Why exactly?
---
Hell yeah! I'd main the fuck out of Space Kook!
---
Imagine if the game had some killers be able to crawl on walls like spirit walking like the ring
---
I don't use NOED, waste of a perk slot, but yeah, I'd totally take that trade.
---
Probably that just seems a little scummy to me
---
Maybe you need to rethink your strat. I always lay low at the start of a match until something happens
---
Perk idea for Steve: You have a chance of not alerting the killer if you unhook a survivor vault a window or pallet etc. the chances are 20%/30%/40%.”I’m stealthy, like a ninja.” Steve Harrington
---
That's what I always do and it consistently saves my ass
---
Well, it would be nice if you could provide a link so I can dislike it.
---
Likely only has that when the killer uses it. The glowing hide would signal the animation of the killer coming through. 
---
It just looks like the same type of thing they did with Freddy with the gens spewing blood.
---
I'm kinda curious about the arguments used by both sides
---
When I first saw that trailer I thought Robin wasn't gonna matter at all
---
I miss the 2017 Halloween music... By far the best of them all
---
Awoo

---
An opinion is an opinion, you didn't force that opinion on others (supposedly) so there should be no problem at all?
---
Her head looks kind of big for her body, thats just my two cents
---
This reminds me of my favorite card in hearthstone, which is also blue
---
And now everyone becomes a sandbagger for points. BBQ works really well cuz it makes it promotes a healthy non camping environment and gives points for not being a camper. This will promote sandbagging toxicity no thank you.
---
Are you open to anyone joining this group? I also play on xbox and need some buddies to play with
---
Git gud.
---
We did get Ash before GF, but yea not getting Sidney sucks.
---
Im not a fan of ST comin to dbd either but alot of people want it and are excited for it so people are gonna downvote and talk trash on anything against ST
---
Jonathan is a hotty fuck off
---
Telling someone to shut up is not nice.
---
Its because I've been watching it non-stop
---
Cant believe he teabagged because he got lucky. Teabagging because you seriously outplayed a killer of your equal rank is one thing, but teabagging because that somehow stunned the killer is just wrong
---
BBQ is already a meta perk without the bp bonus, it only makes sense to give WGLF a bonus effect as well even if it isn’t meta. It’d make the grind a lot easier for new players and make it more viable at higher ranks.
---
Yeah only got finalised earlier this year. 
---
Will interesting to see if they make another Alien film/game under the Disney banner.
---
So what's the tax like on toxicity?
---
You criticized the new chapter despite never having seen the show. Also, it was pretty much just bait considering you just said you think it's dumb but never said why you think that. If you had just said why you think it's dumb you wouldn't have gotten nearly as many hate comments
---
True, I haven't watched stranger things either, nor do I plan too, but the killer looks cool, but Scooby Doo is one of those cartoons lots of people grew up with, and even if it's a children show some of the monsters were actually pretty cool
---
NOED deserves hate, it is in the survivor rulebook. I suggest you read it.
---
Dead meme but you do you my man
---
I’m not a huge fan but I’m getting it. 4 new killer perks and 8 survivor ones
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
You are only a threat in your immediate area and has no true mobility to compensate for that.
---
I know atleast until the new alien movie closer it’s unlikely we will see practically anything Alien in games and media unfortunately.
---
Damn, I thought it was just "screw will smith" and was happy with that.
---
This doesn’t really make sense mate
---
People probably disliked your opinion because your argument was that the DLC was "dumb" because you've never seen the show.
---
Are those marshmallows in the ice cream?
---
Thanks for the feedback! I think that the reason ghostface marked needed to be buffed was because of pallets and windows, so having something that removes those should be pretty short, and as for the Wendigo primary power, that's a good point, I suppose if this were to ever be put into the game (which is unlikely), he would need to either have a smaller terror radius or some way to remove it when he uses his power. Looking back, I agree with you about Pacify, there should probably be a longer time needed to be chased for that to work, and maybe only be able to be used when they are not being chased, so as to make it meant to help other survivors, rather than just a MOM clone.
---
Praise!

**TOP TEN MOST RIGHT THINGS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD**
---
-
---
Yup. They were even partnered with a smaller indie company called Night School Studio to do a smaller game that would run parallel to the Telltale game.
---
What's that disgusting creature on the far left
---
Did this the other day lol.  My girlfriend and I were playing around as Bill since he just came to console and we were both low levels but happened to have a Shattered Glasses offering.  We both used one while the killer used a “Game” offering and we took him to Lery’s as scratched mirror.  Was not a fun game lol
---
Well they did there are many things cheaper to get licensed but with the timing BHVR made the right decision to use Stranger Things in a attempt to gain new players. We will prolly see a sale/free weekend in when the dlc launches
---
It’s one of those endless cycles, one guy starts being toxic so now the killer is mad and will be toxic making more toxic survivors etc etc
---
Halloween event and winter solstice was the shit back in '17. Glad they at least brought the winter one back.
---
I don't know
---
Shoutouts to simpleflips
---
Blood loss seems nice
---
Yeah i got a little mad about my karma
---
Also me with Borderlands 3.
---
 *Hyperventilating intensifies*
---
Yeah, but in low ranks they do, and her base power doesn't get negated when pallet stunned (only corrupt purge, but if you get stunned in this state you are pretty stupid) and with legion you still can heal, what you can't otherwise if you are fully sick.
---
Hey! Don't judge. It helps me sleep at night. That way I can barely hear the voices in my head. And you pass out and get your much needed rest.
---
Kinda sounds like legion
---
Sandbagging the killer isn’t toxic. It requires coordination and is risky. BBQ doesn’t give points for not camping. It just has a side effect which encourages them not to. The “We’ll Make It” bonus encourages teamwork.
---
I was definitely suggesting Langenkamp's Nancy, not Mara's!
---
At equal skill levels no single survivor should be able to completely play around any killer. Nurse has add ons that are a bit much. Spirit is about the power level we need more killers at.
---
flashlights are a big part of the game and i dont think having a perk that makes an item you bring in completely useless is good game design.
---
it's really hard to tell that it's a hard dick at first, I kept seeing a skateboard
---
They did that when the game first came out, but it left killers at a disadvantage because survivors could figure out what killer it was by just looking at the hooks
---
You putting the Demogorgon as a M1 killer when you didn't see actually gameplay footage or have yet to try them? Noice.
---
\[Testing\]([https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Furtive\_Chase](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Furtive_Chase))

Do I detect a fellow RWBY Chibi fan? 
---
Blake: Ruby...can I have my pictures of Myers back?
---
Ruby: LATER!
---
well you cant blame your team for your own bad performance and misunderstanding of a character can you?
---
I actually don’t agree because it’s nice to hear the game evolving as every dlc comes out, luckily you can literally just queue up as the killer and get their music playing so...
---
Lightborn practically already does that, but it's still normally not good enough to bring in unless it's a swf with all flashlights.
---
all of this persons posts are staged
---
Feng - Velma, Dwight - Shaggy, Kate - Daphne, David - Fred.
---
Not to mention evem with the best addons you can't get your uncloak time to over a 20% reduction. That's two addons.
---
All perks are teachable at levels 30, 35, and 40. Adrenaline shows up at 40.  I don't know what happens if you "miss" a teachable.
---

---
Sounds good to me
---
Good work! I was going to make a joke about squatting practice for teabagging but you apparently have the whole fitness thing in check lol.
---
You going to bring an item too?
---
Steve looks SO WRONG omfg
---
Any tips, brother?
---
True, but it's a price I'm willing to pay in order to have a full sfw squad dressed as the gang from scooby doo
---
I haven't watched more than first 3 episodes. But I am excited for this DLC because it is current and will likely attract a lot of knew players. Part of me dreads the idea of a huge surge of player and the toxicity that it can bring. But new players = more money which if allocated correctly can be used to increase the devs who work on the programming for actual gameplay and fixing bugs. 
---
To also include I complain I feel the least about bugs. I have close 2k hours on it (PC) and have rarely encountered any bugs. When I do they are not consistently happening to me. I am also not taking away the validity for people who have several bugs and issues.
---
No I think of the characters when thinking of the show not the monster because the characters are great but the monster was boring and was not the centrepiece of the show at all which I think it worked in the favour of the show. 
---
The monster was forgettable, the design was cool but not exactly unforgettable cool.
---
Suddenly stranger things isn’t so exciting....
---
Who the fuck is heather I just wanna know
---
What the fuck is scp 096 doing in dbd
---
I just plain don't like anyone in this community,  some of the streamers seem nice but honesty you're all scum to me :)
---
Aah shit didnt know that. I saw two appearing so I thought the other one will appear too lol. Thank you^^
---
Yes ! Im gonna make a flashlight. I’m actually streaming rn with my cosplay as it currently is if you’re curious :3 twitch.tv/ladyspideypool
---
Yeah I'd love to have them in the game too. This game is trying to scoop up as many iconic horror figures as it can, how can you leave out the OGs?
---
You really haven't really played Bubba, have you? It's extremely hard to rank up with him even with 3k. The higher you get, the harder it is. And against high ranked SWF you don't stand a chance with killers like Bubba or Legion.
---
How about you play both? When you wanna play Ash, play him and take a break from playing Steve. Then when you wanna play Steve, play him and take a break from playing Ash.
---
Lightborn doesnt make it useless and then comeback around to bite you in the ass. All lightborn does is make it take a little longer for the blind which give the killer a better chance of landing a hit. I may have misread the initial idea for the perk looking back, however you can still combo with lightborn and it would be op as fuck. Hell even without lightborn or any kind of flash effectiveness change i still think it would be op because it just hands out exposure for someone using a flashlight.
---
Most survivors just expect you to farm if they get a DC since they're at a pretty big disadvantage. You don't have to though so I wouldn't worry about it
---
Thank youu!!
---
What colorblind people see:  
---
\*it does sound like a neat idea, but it would suck for blind people, as it would probably highlight stuff in\*
---
Bruh ghostface so much fun
---
We need the themes to the licensed characters. Like Lauries theme, Halloween theme, NoES theme, Hello Zepp, etc
---
Toxic Kids gonna Toxic
---
Dude at that lv people dc when they get downed after a nurse teleports past a pallet they just dropped
---
I, Erwes7 have a dream, I want to turn this shitty meme into a comunity movement that will eventuly lead to BHVR listening and giving us a Scooby Doo DLC
---
that gave me the dumbest idea ever. Common flashlights hurt more than the other flashlights
---
A steriotypical zombie mummy or vampire would be a good killer for them classic monsters for classic survivors
---
WOWO THE KILLER CAN MOVE UNDERGROUND?!
---
Doctor used to be my main and my favorite killer to play but i got spirit a few days ago and man, she is so much fun, and shes a top tier killer second only to the nurse when you know how to play her.
---
And t bag and flashlight and loop and pallet and insult in post game chat
---
predator is made by the devs who made F13... so yeah its gonna suck and die really fast
---
If we turn this into a comunity-wide meme like how "ghost face never" was then maybe we'll actually pull it off, so spread the word my fellow killers and survivors
---
Uff we have salty downvoters
---
Nah I’d rather have cashier carl instead of Nancy wheeler
---
Tier 1 Michael: am I a joke to you?
---
Never apologize for greatness.
---
Dwight Fairfield
---
:(
---
Okay I don't really care dude it's a concept and won't be added anyways, balance it however you want. I couldn't care less.
---
Google it
---
What did they do to you bender
---
"why are Surviviors so toxic" 
---
*Is the first one to throw an insult*.
---
what how
---
there's no info whatsoever on it. Not a wiki article, only a few screenshots.
---
But billy ez 4k’s
---
I’ve been playing both games for a long time and I love how they update at around the same time
---
As a new guy that's always been interested in the game but never played, what should I expect and how can I be a good team mate? This announcement (and games pass) made me want to start playing
---
Sorry, but I find all the "toxic survivors" "toxic killers" "blame this blame that" all so annoying,  even the memes. It's a game.  At the end of the day, who f-ing cares
---
pinhead would be awesome but the real question is what would his power be?
---
And hooking a survivor for a stack isn t hard?
---
We really don’t need another nurse tier killer
---
That's too bad, but we can still hope
---
The Demogorgon looks somewhat silly here, especially in the first screenshot. A cartoonish rendering and bright colours you'd expect from the Fortnite model. What's with that distinct blue and red? It looked a lot cooler in the trailer, as so often. Hope there will be more detail and grime to the in-game model than these screenshots let on.
---
Other than that, I'm pretty excited for the Chapter, and especially the prospect of potentially 6 new survivor perks - twice the chance that BHVR actually finally ends up giving survivors something good again!
---
If the killer ability really is only placing portals around the map through which it can travel and that survivors can destroy, that would be pretty lacklustre: another derivative, mediocre ability with questionable in-chase value and unengaging "hold M1" interactions of tampering with the portals. And no cool "Upside-Down" visuals, either (unless in first-person perspective at least the Demogorgon actually travels through the Upside-Down). But maybe what we are seeing here is not the survivors destroying a portal - what if instead of hooking survivors, the Demogorgon drags survivors into the Upside-Down, from which they have to struggle their way out of, or get rescued by other survivors? Doubtful, but that would be a lot cooler, and also a lot less silly than the idea of this animalic, vile creature carrying and hooking survivors. Then again, planting the Upside-Down into the Entity's realm would be pretty weird in itself, it being another dimension altogether and all. Maybe the portals are just literal tunnels, like in Season 2? ...In either case, I hope this ability will be useful in chases, or that there will be a secondary ability to provide chase tools.
---
The map will be indoors again, and I personally like the existing indoor maps, so I'm fairly excited for that, as well.
---
I don’t know but it worked out for them cause they finally got me down and I ended up dying
---
Just wait to see Hag eating all their guts...
---
I'm with everyone else, secretly sell me a legion susie. this is too cute.
---
Blind people wouldn’t be able to play in the first place🤔
---
Legacy Claudette IV
---
*small game sounds off*
---
I want Meg with this hair in the game
---
I'm gonna lick so many fingers
---
Lmao, i love this
---
it's terrible on controler because the buttons are ridiculously fragile to button mashing
---
Yes the different hairs would be awesome! :) Im super hopful on the outfit variants
---
It works sometimes, it doesn't work others, but you're still singling someone out and saying 'you're not allowed to play, back to the queue with you'. Whether it's rude or not depends on whether the player actually got to play prior to it
---
This ni🅱️🅱️a eating beans lol
---
A PTB is just normal DBD but with even worse balance and connection issues
---
Didn’t even think of that, that does sound worse.
---
You better ruin her later tonight
---
I always find it interesting nobody mentions Pig as scary. Why is that?
---
Asking the Dead By Daylight community not to be dickish is like asking fish not to swim.
---
This is the link to the DLC page, it mentions the two cosmetics that will be coming out with them.  Steve’s Scuffed Rolled Sleeves and Nancy’s Torn Sweatshirt. Sadly doesn't look like there will be an awesome Scoops outfit, but hopefully in the future!

---
MARRY HER! STAT!!!!
---
I think it puts down tunnels and survivors can open it, the demogorgen will get a notification and the survivor can enter the tunnels, it causes a timer and you will get a blindness affect, if the timer is up the survivor gets downed.
---
Why does this have so many downvotes lmao
---
Ultra Instinct Shaggy
---
Go for hag slap on ruin if it stays for atleast 25 percent of the match if ur still in  white ranks u will have. An extra 5-10 mins of running around lol 
---
And place hag traps at gens and pallet loops of u know any lol when u hook someone I ten to place a few traps to slow down survivors escaping but dumb people run in to it at low ranks 
---
Sorry if I didn’t help lmao 
---
U could also try. Leather face  for the sole purpose of bbq which is prob the best perk. It gives you insane blood points and and god tier 
---
X-ray like  when you hook someone   
---
Also u could try doctor trapper or wraith as there m1 killers with fun abilities   
---
Wraith being my fav cause bing bong lol
---
 U can use pig  for her jump scares I guess
---
I suppose. Although I think it’s less of a dbd problem and more of a problem with the asymmetric multiplayer genre.
---
Winning as a team sometimes means losing as an individual. In a perfect world, a survivor being camped would be very happy for their teammates as gens get done all around them and their teammates get an easy victory. Obviously it doesn’t always work like that though.
---
Hillbilly walking his dogs in the fog
---
There has been way too many Megs saying how bad this DLC is going to be, how it doesn't fit in, how killers are getting screwed because survivors are getting 6 perks. I could seriously go on forever with the weird complaints i have seen.
---
Plot twist : scrappy is the killer
---
[What's with all of these complaints, it's like the didn't watch the S3 Finale](https://youtu.be/TvUhA8ahJkc?t=80)
---
“Is he here?”
---
*No*
---
“Where is he?”
---
*Somewhere with Nancy*
---
Well here's hoping for 115% speed
---
Lot if killers can be an awesome addition in the game. I’m just glad the devs are listening and and deliver too. 
---
Too bad no dev can do anything about the toxic part of the community in their gam.
---
I know. This community sucks dick sometimes.
---
Roomba mode engage
---
Easy (one quarter of the circle?) skill checks to lower the frequency of mashing but still require attention?
---
Lots of DBD lore seems to be up to interpretation, but my interpretation for those that you listed is that the Entity saved them from the clutches of death before they actually died. 
---
The Entity also has super specific requirements to function. To feast it has to run this little game in circles and to pull new victims into its world it needs an atrocity/violence to occur to manifest (from my understanding). Honestly it seems like the Entity is a god in its world, but thats because the Entity's realm is basically its own body and outside of that, in the real world it probably has very little to no influence.
---
Scrappy doo was a bad guy in one of the movies...
---
lmao let's get this post to hot
---
Omg he dealted his account lol
---
I think going against noob killers who face camp/tunnel and noob survivors who miss every single skill check/hide in the locker all match killers/survivors rage quitting are gonna be more discouraging for new players than going up against players with experience. I rage more playing survivor when I've ran the killer the entire map for a few minutes and not a single gen has been done(with no ruin equipped). And when I'm finally hooked, they're on the opposite side of the map, crouched or hiding in a locker.
---
Oh didnt even notice thanks man im bugged less
---
Honestly people should stop nagging about Jason, there's a game that's literally all about Jason already.
---
I usually play as a survivor, but I would be interested in the rules for killers too.
---
I feel like it'd either be the Lament Configuration or the chains.
---
Woah man actually it’s “The Ghost Face”
---
We don’t want to get sued
---
It took me 2 weeks to go from brand new to rank 7 killer. I think this game is pretty simple. Not a lot to learn at all compared to most competitive games.
---
but they really would be unable to justify it, without completely tanking their game, unless it were for the added bonus.
---
If Steve says that I might cream my pants. Sorry Steve.
---
I like that idea to just label it chapter 14. But if we ever do get jason say itd be chapter 24 would they call it chapter 13?
---
It’s always nice to give a light tbag after a random heals you
---
And that game is a glitchy mess with no future updates ever coming out. It turned out shit. But that's not what matters, the fucking legal battle over that hockey masked fuck is gonna go on for a while.
---
I was thinking this too. Like quarter or third. I’ve brought it up with multiple and no one seems to get as pissed as I do with it. I can’t believe it’s still a mechanic.
---
RiN YaKomOTa moTheR HatErS
---
There really arent any, there are imaginary rules that survivors have made that they expect killers to follow, that make absolutely no sense.
---
what's the absolute best perk
---
I've been thinking about this for a month now, everytime I see a couple survivors sneaking it reminds me of the old scooby doo cartoons
---
Cant wait for the new DLC to drop
---
Tunneling and camping people as the killer is hated and frowned on although it’s not always black and white to people what those terms mean. 
---
Bad manner stuff like teabagging, flashlight clicking, hitting people on the hook as the killer. 
---
Betraying other survivors by giving away their position to the killer. 
---
Basically don’t be an asshole. Most people don’t mind losing if you’re not a dick about it. Contributing to the toxicity in this game doesn’t help anybody.
---
10$ if we're lucky.
---
Get shirtless daddy david x)
---
Trapper was just an enforcer, Myers is just pure evil, Doctor just wanted to continuing working towards success, Huntress is a clueless child, the DbD Freddy is a diddler who wants revenge, Pig is just creating games that make people realize how special their life is, but yeah Ghostface is a serial killer who just does it for lulz.
---
Universal:
---
* don't stall the game when not needed
---
Survivor:
---
* don't tbag 
---
* don't flashlight spam
---
* If the exits gates are open and you aren't waiting around to insure your friends safety, just leave
---
Killer:
---
* don't facecamp (staring at the hooked survivor from 1 foot away while head nodding or hitting them)
---
* (Optional) if you feel like it was a good game and you have 3 survivors killed, it's considered a courtesy to give the last survivor the hatch
---
A my bloody valentine dlc would be amazing
---
nancy needs a voiceline too. also i want a scoops ahoy skin for nancy just like Robin .
---
This game has no fake rules, play howerer u want and dont let other people to tell u how to play like they like
---
Must be a higher rank issue. Games last ten to fifteen minutes and it's mostly running between gens
---
The only ones that I actually think are okay "rules" are don't camp (stay near a survivor after you've hooked them and don't tunnel (only go after one survivor). All in all, play how you want and don't let other players bully you.
---
What killer? I think I might’ve been in that game
---
this is what my sleep paralysis demon looks like
---
This is hilarious, great and makes sense.
---
Wiggling has given me stick drift on one side. -_-
---
I'm sorry but Jason is never getting into this game. Aside from having his own game, the rights to him are a legal disaster.
---
The only real Unwritten Rule is "Try not to be a dick".
---
A lot of Survivors are going to tell you how you should play as Killer. Ignore them. There's a reason why the joke goes "Survivors think Killers are Camping the hook if they stay on the map", and the latest Parody video had "The Survivors Rules for Playing Killer" as a punchline. No matter what you do salty survivors are going to say you played wrong and you're just going to have to  toughen up or get rid of post-game chat.
---
If you're playing Survivor, Killers are going to tell you how to play. Ignore them. A lot of Killers think survivors doing anything other than run in a straight line is toxic, and you'll never be able to please them all. Just try to survive, get out of the trial, and move on to the next game.
---
Also, while t-bagging and pissing off the killer are viable strategies to escape if the skill discrepancy is high enough (and I say this as a Killer), don't taunt the killer and then bitch about it when you get smacked in the mouth. It's tacky.
---
Wow, this sub is actually a thing. Someone must have really hated Dvorah.
---
i guess the chains could be a trap which could hold survivors in place, but then he would just be a cheap trapper imitation. 
---
the lament configuration just has endless potential but i dont know how they would put it into the game. freddy's dream powers are just turned into a slow down ability and teleporting
---
Im don't want to be that guy that points it out...
---
But since you don't care anyway fuck it
---
You're
---
Also you're the one who threw it into the fire
---
Nah, Nancy should get her prom dress instead. Scoops is Steve/Robin's thing.
---
Plus the picture itself is more beautiful than any picture I could make.
---
I don't like F13 at all, but it annoys me when people keep complaining about it/mentioning it. I'm just saying if people are that desperate then hop on over there.
---
Exactly.
---
Jason could come after Chapter 50. He could come after Chapter 22. He could come after Chapter 37. 
---
But he's always gonna come in Chapter 13.
---
That has absolutely nothing to do with it
---
It might go on for a while, but we'll be waiting.
---
dbd has so much potential, dude
---
Alright cool thanks
---
That’s freaking awful! That’s a similar mechanic that also sucks a lot, but at least it dosnt mean you lose the game if you fail....unless it’s death hook haha.
---
Haida papi, că ne faci rost de copilărie in jocul asta care seacă suflete
---
Slippery meat
---
Lol dude looks like YOU'RE the toxic one
---
Oh my GOD. I LOVED NAUGHTY BEAR. I had no idea!!!
---
I'm going to derank to rank 20 and try to ease them into the game
---
Im sure we will get jason eventually itll just be a long time. And if we dont thats because the games dead by the time the lawsuits over lol
---
Hecc yeah
---
My Lisa had found love ❤
---
what rank? I’m on PS4 and I only get tunneled maybe 1/6-7 matches
---
For like 10 more years
---
Well for dimensions not a lot of monsters but any monster deriving from hell and heaven, Freddie he can manipulate the real world to an extent.  Many SCPs for other dimensional monsters personal fav the submarine/mist. the flower mouth is not exclusive to demigorgon, Particularly Zelda: Skyward Sword, the Deku-Baba. 
---
None with the combination of flower head and extra dimensional I would be concerned if there was as it would make the Demigorgon all the more forgettable.
---
Pennywise was a bitch compared to the entity. And pennywise isnt immortal considering they actually killed pennywise wise guy.
---
hey you stole my idea! /s
---
I personally haven't seen one in a while. I know it was a recent addition but unsure if it's still ongoing. You could try the discord though?
---
For starters the first text is meant to be in the first screen, not the middle and the second one is meant to be in the second screen, not the third.
---
We dont talk about that
---
Hot damn, you're fine.
---
As killer you don’t see the timer, the timer also doesn’t decrease when they are in your terror radius,
---
To put it nicely, Franks mixtape may be a rare addon but it’s pure trash don’t use it, ever,
---
Can you hook me up with a link? I dont have a computer.
---
That is your opinion and that is fine, but I don't find anything interesting about the entity. In fact, I find that it detracts from the killers and makes them completely unintimidating.
---
Ty
---
You cant see the bleedout timer go down anymore
---
only if we get the laugh in game
---
I bought my first award to give to you because that was the best responseI’ve ever seen here. I Am Afraid
---
Gordon Ramsay survivor would be epic
---
The original creator of this format did the last on in third panel and I'm doing both since I got the killers attention that's why they looked behind cause they got noticed and the lights going off is the cue that its Franklin's and they run away
---
I can't tell you because then they'd be written.
---
Steve? That's Andrew Garfield
---
yay, useless killer in swf. would nobody know someone’s hooked? that would result in 1 hooks all game. thing will never work as long as SWF exists, they could do it so you only play against thing if you’re solo queuing but that would absolutely fuck queue times since like 20 percent is SWF.
---
The mouse movement isn't really required. It makes no difference to the actual spin aside from your own perspective appearing faster so it feels smoother and easier. It looks the same from a killer POV.
---
I just now noticed that there’s teenagers in the reflection of Michael’s knife
---
And Apex Legends be like *charging $7 for lootboxes noises*
---
Awww, that made me smile, thank you :D

---
Really? Bond isn't that useful in a SWF group since with comms people should know where each other are anyway. Leader works just as much solo as it does SWF because the main actions that need speeding up are healing and unhooking. If you're talking about Prove Thyself, it's really not good at all. It saves at _most_ 4/5/6 seconds for 2/3/4 survivors on a generator.
---
But doesn't the Demigorgon use humans as human cocoons for their young. For example Barb was dead in the upside down and something came out of her, just like something came out of Will when he got out of the upside down. Dustin grew one of those things up into a Demigorgon.
---
Welcome, and hopefully you enjoy your stay! If you ever get the game, just a heads up, the in-game tutorial isn't very good at the moment (IRC they are changing it in the future) so I recommend watching some video guides beforehand. Still do the in-game tutorial though, since you get free bloodpoints from them.
---
Yeah, diversion needs a buff.
---
Just run No Mither lol
---
I get the idea but it's ultimately pointless and not really worth it.
---
It looks fine to me 🤡
---
You...don't know anything about Pennywise, do you?
---
Pennywise is still alive. The only thing that died was his physical incarnation that you see in the stories. The real Pennywise, the deadlights, is a cosmic multiverse being that feeds on fear and devours entire worlds. It is also renowned for having spiderlike qualities.
---
Hmm...wonder where Behavior got their inspiration for the soulless "entity".
---
In third panel nancy says let's get out of here so I thought why not put Franklin's their and the first text in the both up top since their running away yet just got noticed anyways thanks for the talk
---
YOu should be
---
Watch the show and u’ll change ur opinion about him, he is one of the best characters
---
I mean wonder where they got inspiration for their first two killers. Trapper and Jason Hillbilly and Leatherface.

your a cool guy I like you for taking the time have a great chapter

That’s trash
---
kthx
---
I think it's pretty fun
---
Those are steam purchase exclusives. It’s Steve and Nancy’s torso but all fucked up. They’ve said nothing about store cosmetics.
---
What you play on?
---
Oh ok will do this was kind of an immediate upload, there visual proof after 8:35. But my friend has the other part where the random is blocking my friends hook when I was getting chased.
---
Jane looks like she isn't nervous at all
---
I’m so fucking hyped
---
After the nerf you cant see the bleedout timer for any killee anymore. Also when in a chase it doesnt go down in your terror radius. They did q dev stream on it awhile ago.
---
ITS ONLY ON PC???!? aw..
---
hopefully she looks better ingame
---
They need to do silent hill
---
Thanks! I’ll be sure to check out the page on steam and consider buying the game!
---
I maintain that Pinhead from Hellraiser would be amazing.
---
shoutouts to todd from mario cart
---
Indeed, but at least trapper and hillybilly have some level of personality accentuated by their mechanics, animations, etc.
---
What exactly does the entity bring? Plot device. Oh grand, truly interesting and breathtaking by comparison. Totally not replaceable by any scribbled down random cosmic event.
---
pc
---
I play pc here and their dont let toxicity get to your head doesn't matter if you pip or not have fun meme around with builds have fun bud
---
I like Pennywise but he wouldn't fit in this game. He's like a god
---
I wasn’t even thinking about the scoops ahoy being separate 👍🏼
---
That is terrifying
---
Definitely Babysitter and Search Party for me.
---
😶
---
Zombie Ed as the killer of course.
---
I mean if you can call sounds and an ability personality than fuck it. But considering the devs treat half of hillbilly cosmetics as a joke while trapper gets mostly intimidating things it says a thing or two about the character.
---
As others have said you can't see the timer go down when you hit them again, ultimately making it pointless. I really wish out of all the Legion changes, they'd at least revert this one. Maybe just make it exclusive to Frank's.
---
How do we know Steve’s not the killer?
---
Just have a great dam good one see ya hopefully I find you in a game
---
Dude I remember when 99ing was a thing.
---
Think you might have missed...
---
Thank you for telling me this. I appreciate this.
---
Same, always liked the killer stories and doctors isn't just classic horror, it is based on a real life doctor from China.
---
These, to me, have **always** been more interesting than the "the entity".
---
*waits 8 minutes to get in a lobby*
---
*someone doesn't connect and the match is canceled*
---
*reapeat*
---
I know I mean I don't know what they could've done with jason now
---
The council will decide your fate.
---
People complain too much, i'm happy with any content that they come up with.
---
just went through my entire history and checked
---
damn I was a normie
---
My predictions out of the 6 survivor perks.
---
2 shit/meh perks that are just ok but not really meta. 
---
3 Good perks that won't be meta but will see some use even at high ranks in certain builds. 
---
1 EXTREMELY good, gamechanging meta perk.
---
With the "Oblivious" status effect, I am very curious if one of the survivor perks will be a double edged sword that makes it so you're not affected by the terror radius. You can't hear the killer coming and can't proc stuff like borrowed time or stake out but you're immune to stuff like Doctor's passive insanity AOE, Unnerving Presence, Coulrophobia, Infectious Fright, etc.  
---
And for the killer perks.
---
1 Chase Perk.
---
1 Detection Perk.
---
1 absolutely meme-tier perk that is extremely niche, but fills the niche very well and while it won't be that great on the demogorgon, will be absolutely nuts on a certain killer or combo'd with a certain specific perk build. I predict it'll be a TR related perk and it'll be the final piece for the ultimate Doctor 3-gen build.
---
there's ai in the tutorial already
---
it's mandatory for some reason on consoles but it's an option for pc as well
---
Steve most likely protection/fighting back, Nqncy probably qround investigation/knowledge.
---
Hehe, you ain't see nothing yet, so many people want literal beheading, dismemberment, etc. People were sad that Billy and lf didn't literally cut someone in half.
---
Now this... is art!
---
And I am fine with that, still more personality than the spider plot device that is supposed to be this "big", "bad", "powerful" cosmic horror that can rip time and space and pull people from their respective cashcow franchises, but can't sustain itself without the hopes and despairs of mortal college students that forgot their camping gear.
---
if you ever diss my baby best for last again you better lock your fucking doors you absolute fuck
---
Zoom in on the 3rd image, I never remember seeing anything like that.
---
b00n96
---
You put on a wig and a face mask and the rest looks nothing like it. Do you need attention?
---
A completely indoors map, like an abandoned mansion. Not sure where the exit gates would go but it can still be done
---
I mean ehhhh legion and spirit can be considered college students considering their backstory
---
hag with ruin. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm if anything TS and DH would just protect it more
---
Thanks for the copy pasta friend.
---
It would be awesome, maybe they could replace the front and the back doors?
---
Yeah that went over her left shoulder (your right)
---
1-  If I win, you suck and should uninstall.
---
2-  If I lose, you’re a cheating bitch and should uninstall.
---
3-  I decide what winning and losing is.
---
Other than the portal, the ground and fog look normal.
---
It’ll just be the “Steve” survivor with glowing eyes
---
Horrifying
---
Ok this one got me
---
This would be amazing
---
I think it'd be cool to have a Lery's that is mostly outside. I think the snowy atmosphere is interesting and is very much left unexplored. Perhaps have the actual institute on one side of the map and have the rest be a sort of yard for the patients?
---
For me it was summer bbq
---
Well if they are walking into me maybe but I mean if they run off obviously
---
Doesnt mean the grind isnt ridiculous though. The game could be free and the grind would still be too much. Luckily they are fixing is soon
---
Survivors will complain if you don't go completely across the map when you hook someone, use a mori, kill sufferings without having hooked every other player twice, or if you use certain perks. 
---
Killers will complain if you use any items, if you tea bag, if you fix generators too quickly, if you run in circles, or use certain perks. 
---
Ignore everyone and play how you like.
---
Well I love how "precise" you can be on console, yet PC hits 10 feet behind them.
---
Great game, totally recommended!

I want to play with my friends dressed up as the scooby gang so badly
---
Okay?
---
I binged season 1 yesterday and it is really good. 80s-cold-war-CIA-conspiracies meets horror.
---
Ooohhh..
---
Velkommen til Nøkkens Sævik.
---
Normal people.
---
I spit out my drink laughing. Beautiful.
---
Soon as I get out of work I will add you. Im Central US time, if that has any impact on when we can play.
---
Still a more interesting story than the entity.
---
i imagine something similar with the nurse's ward, but with snow and some buildings scattered around the map.
---
300 hours in ... wouldn’t say that is new to any game.
---
This is a repost, but, considering the circumstances, I'm all on board.
---
Welcome! This game is very hard in the beginning but with some patience and hard work you’ll  be having lots of fun :)
---
First time?
---
800 hours in 3 months? I play games a lot but damn. You play like 16 hours a day?
---
Because I've seen how BHVR operates.  In fact, the screens on the steam page that released today shows Survivors working on the tunnel that he was shown coming out of in the screenshots before.
---
you can get it from my profile posts, the original is there.
---
I ain’t never gonna stop loving you...
---
Yeah, Aliens have always been a mix of Bipedal and Quadrupedal. It's my understanding that they use Quadrupedal locomotion for speed and to get through smaller spaces, and Bipedal to scan the area and use their arms to grab victims etc.
---
So I haven’t played since before legion so i was wondering if any of the new dlcs is worth getting (on console) Both in killer power and perks available.
---
Make this Miner 49er, and we can get Shaggy as a survivor
---
Mr. Myers on steam, would love to help out

This is a cursed image
---
While I can’t think of any way to make either thematically work (imagine the animation for repairing from the ground lmao) those are actually both really nifty ideas tbh.
---
*Ahem*. Mobile? THAT EXISTS?
---
Predator is low tier trash, if anything it an make scratchmarks easier to lose
---
Dude don’t leak the power yet!
---
They’re obviously ironic tho
---
Y'all are playing scratched mirror without a lery's offering?
---
Id buy one too
---
“Gg 2 ez noob!!!!” Followed by approximately 30-40 laughing emojis (Xbox is a wonderful place, where little kids think I take them seriously with that many emojis)
---
They arent far off that to begin with
---
Spirit is broken? (Haven't played in a while) What happened?
---
What about MacMillan estate BOY
---
Listen my guy, we've tried this for years and it hasnt stopped. What mkes you think cause we get new players it will stop? Deal with the community like the rest of us.
---
Wanna win ez? Main spirit
---
This whole chapters makes me hopeful because first off it’s a really popular property that will get lots of attention. It’s the first monster killer we’ve got and opens up the fire for more monster killers. And we got two survivors hopefully that becomes a theme in the future and maybe we could ft two killers in a chapter one day
---
Finally, they're adding Exodia the Forbidden One.
---
Could make for a nifty add-on, “extended blade/saw/axe” etc. since LF is the only one with true AOE at the moment
---
Literally had this but i wanted the claud to open the exit gate and instead she ran away.... EGC =(
---
Give me that Halloween music from two years ago
---
The camera angle is definitely a mori
---
I’m not gonna lie, i kinda hope they don’t. I’ve never been a big fan of the series (just never watched it much, didn’t dislike it) but Disney has a habit of ruining series recently. I mean, look what they did to Star Wars
---
Spirit is where i got my first hate mail. Apparently its toxic to use just here perks to get the achievement
---
Nope never had a problem with it.
---
Crows are always nice my dude.
---
Can’t wait for the Thanos killer
---
Ah this makes me sad now. Oxenfree was a fucking great game and they would have done great with an ST title
---
What is exactly is cheating here?
---
i have p3 bubba and am a red rank killer so from experience i can tell that you’re just not good at the game
---
This game has a very steep learning curve. I would have considered myself clueless even at 40 hours. But I started watching videos, notably Tydetyme at the time (say what you want but now but he did helped me immensely when I was learning), and I got exponentially better than I did trying to learn on the go. 
---
Watch some Youtubers like Monto, Noob3, Tru3Ta1ent for both killers and survivor gameplay. Try to imitate what they are doing and incorporate it into your gameplay. It doesn’t matter who as long as they are decent and you enjoy watching them. I’d would highly recommend Varrix though since his videos are sooooo good at explaining how to play.
---
BWAAAHHHH BWAAAHHHH BWAAAHHHH BWAAAHHHH DUN DUN dun dun DUN DUN dun dun
---
Can't wait for the new killer *The Kook*
---

---
This thing honestly scared the crap out of me as a kid, and it would be great/hilarious to have this thing chasing you in DBD
---
I don’t see it as such. The number 13 is supposed to be a cursed number — that’s why we have the Friday the 13th series — and by having a “lost chapter” by the 13th adds atmosphere, as if the entity itself is saying “even I won’t allow this”
---
I only say that because I know people with thousands of hours, i feel inferior in comparison! i still feel new, I've only ever got to rank 5 currently
---
Can i please get the demogorgon done this way? I think it sounds neato burrito.
---
Basically i have 2 ideas, first of which is when you play as the Demogorgon, it has terrible eyesight since it lives in darkness and you know, has no eyes, so the world is a dark grey, but instead of seeing scratch marks, you see scent in a bright yellow, and it fades depending on how old the trail is, people also have a glow to them, think of it like how you see things like this done in movies, the creature cant actually see but like with sonar, it can map out its surroundings and see in its mind
---
Second idea is to just have this be its ability, like a hunting mode, that lasts 30 seconds or so.
---
Also on the note of injured survivors, i think the scent thing would work especially well will the lore of ST considering demogorgons rely heavily on smell and nancy even compares it to a shark by saying it smells blood
---
idk im just spitballing but i think it would be really cool and it would add a new layer onto being this particular killer
---
What if they license Hellraiser?
---
11am Pacific Time
---
yeah, it's currently in beta. If you are on ios, just switch your app store country to Finland and if you are on android, use taptap to download it. On ios it even runs on iphone 5s and ipad mini 2, on android however you will need 3gb ram and a decent processor, though it is completely playable on snapdragon 660.
---
2nd best killer in the game.
---
I’d assume no altruism because no one got hooked
---
Fuck the aesthetics and lore. We've got corporate partners.
---
YoU DidN’T REscuE EnOugh. The rank system is a little whack, and dependent on the skill of your opponents.
---
Technician still. Only elite players use Technician
---
Don't listen to everyones BS. The only rule is have fun.
---
Tbh I always see it more as a humanoid creature, and I'd like to see it move like an animal, but running is fine too
---
I am ok in general with upping the points. Not only is it harder to get points, it is harder to get stacks of WGLF for point bonuses. 
---
Any conversation that keeps this topic up is good. 
---
We will have a bunch of new survivors soon that will need to grind up.
---
Yeah those are my personal favorites aswell. Babysitter would suffice for me because its the same jacket and everything but i would love to have that headgear.
---
What the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land
---
More like terrifying, but still great
---
Oh and also you can double t bag as a thank you when a survivor heals or unhooks you
---
Whenever he hits someone he does the laugh
---
Damn I expected a picture
---
S+ perk
---
I love how Layers has a max speed buff of 75%, meaning you'd have to get hit by 25 pallets.
---
Looking at you not posting the entire chat log shows you were the toxic one OP.
---
Or when he gets pallet stunned
---
Lmfaoo. I just figured those who knew would know what I meant.
---
I won't unless they miss every skillcheck. I got bullied when I started bc of that so I'm returning the favor
---
it will happen
---
Yup, hate it.
---
Payday 2 allows it
---
Love this
---
You get over there and save that Dwight!
---
Body block, flashlight, butt dance, point menacingly.
---
Overweight killer
---
This is that maximum overdrive plankton was talking about
---
I actually hate the people who are complaining about the chapter because they don’t like stranger things like seriously I doubt half the people who’ve played Pig have seen Saw and know anything about Amanda young you don’t need to like the property to like the killer it’s from I’ve seen like only half of season one of Stranger Things and I’m still hyped for this chapter
---
Scrappy as the killer
---
SHIRTLESS DAVID
---
We bouta get some new content babies
---
Damn, never thought of the Shining! It'd be hella scary for Jack Torrance to be there with his fireaxe. Imagine if he could destroy vault points and unused pallets as part of his power.
